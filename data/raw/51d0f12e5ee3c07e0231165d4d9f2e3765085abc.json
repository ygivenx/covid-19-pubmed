{"title": "VIRAL DISEASES", "body": "The influenza virus belongs to the family Orthomyxoviridae, which is divided into three types ( Fig. 14-1) . The pleomorphic viruses are enveloped and measure 60 to 120 \u00b5m in diameter. The genome consists of single-stranded ribonucleic acid. Influenza A virus is the only type of veterinary significance. Influenza viruses possess two surface antigens that are important to identify and control. The most important is hemagglutinin (H), which is responsible for the virus's ability to agglutinate erythrocytes and to attach and penetrate host cells. The other surface antigen is neuraminidase (N), which is involved in the release of newly formed viral particles from host cells. Influenza A viruses are classified into 16 antigenically distinct HA (H1-H16) and 9 NA (N1-N9) subtypes. Few subtype combinations have been isolated from mammalian species, but all subtypes in most of the possible combinations have been found in birds (World Health Organization, 1980; Spielman et al., 2004) . Subtypes H5, H7, and H9 possess a high pandemic potential (Webster and Hulse, 2004) and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) isolates are restricted to subtypes H5 and N7. Aquatic birds, particularly ducks, are the reservoirs of influenza A virus, providing a source of novel subtypes that may one day infect mammals. The virus is often disseminated by migratory birds. It replicates in the intestinal tract of birds, which can result in fecal-oral transmission (Markey et al., 2013) . Detection of the virus of the H5 and H7 serotypes in avian species is notifiable to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). Influenza viruses are relatively stable when outside the host, particularly in pond or lake water. In a cool environment, the virus remains infectious in feces for over a month. It can be destroyed in minutes by extremes in pH, heating to 56\u00b0 C, exposure to sunlight, and by most detergents and disinfectants.\n\nThe best known disease caused by an avian influenza virus (AIV) is fowl plague, which is now known as HPAI and is a listed disease by the OIE. Work with HPAI isolates should be performed in high-security laboratories. Fowl plague was first reported in 1878 and 1901, causing using reference influenza A antisera. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques and real-time PCR, which are rapid assays, have been developed for the detection and subtype identification of virus in clinical samples. Commercial antigen-detection immunoassays have also been used for fast diagnosis. These tests detect any influenza A virus and are generally based on monoclonal antibodies. They should be used for screening because they lack sensitivity (see . In several occasions the test was positive only after culture in embryonated eggs or in cells. Serologic testing for antibodies to influenza virus can be performed using different serologic methods like the agar gel immunodiffusion test, hemagglutination inhibition test, or competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.\n\nAvian influenza is not eradicable and prevention and control are the only realistic goals. The Hong Kong outbreak of H5N1 was controlled by extensive culling together with well-managed surveillance and vaccination.\n\nThe following recommendations should be initiated: \u2022 Monitor movement of poultry between farms and markets. \u2022 Monitor birds in live markets and exports/imports. \u2022 Improve biosecurity measures (e.g., prevent contact with wild aquatic birds). \u2022 Separate land-based poultry, pigs, and aquatic avian species in farms and markets. \u2022 Close live bird markets and keep all poultry indoors while HPAIV is circulating in the region. \u2022 Conduct serologic and other epidemiologic studies in wild birds to determine whether HPAIV has become established in wild populations. \u2022 Only allow controlled, effective vaccination in response to virulent outbreaks. Attenuated subtype-specific vaccines are used in domestic fowl; however, these vaccines have limited application because of the speed of antigenic drift and reassortment.\n\nThe family Paramyxoviridae contains some of the most important pathogens of domestic animals and humans ( Fig. 14-7) . The Newcastle Disease virus (NDV; Figs. 14-8 to 14-11), one of the most important diseases of poultry worldwide, belongs to the genus paramyxovirus and is recognized as serotype paramyxovirus 1 (PMV1). Nine avian paramyxovirus (APMV) serotypes have been differentiated so far (Box 14-1), and few strains have been isolated that could not be grouped (Telbis et al., 1989) . ND was first recognized in 1926 after large outbreaks in Java and Newcastle, UK. ND is a World Organization for Animal Health listed disease. APMV1 is divided into two classes based on genetic analysis. Strains of class II have been isolated from wild or domestic birds and include virulent and avirulent isolates, whereas class I strains are avirulent, and both have been found in wild birds (Briand et al., 2014) .\n\nThe virions of members of the family Paramyxoviridae are pleomorphic, roughly spherical enveloped particles with one large molecule of single-stranded RNA. Two glycoproteins from the surface projections possess both hemagglutinin and neuraminidase activities. NDV is relatively heat stable. It remains infectious in bone marrow and muscles of slaughtered chickens for at least 6 months at \u221220\u00b0 C (\u22124\u00b0 F) and up to 134 days at 1\u00b0 C (33.8\u00b0 F). It can survive for several years in dried mutes. Quaternary ammonium compounds, 1% to 2% Lysol, 0.1% cresol, and 2% formalin, are used for disinfection (Fenner et al., 1987) .\n\nND infects most avian species (Table 14 -2), producing unapparent or mild disease in many and severe and lethal disease in others, indicating a great variety in its virulence. Differences in pathogenicity, efficacy of viral RNA replication, and humoral immunity even indicate different susceptibilities between one host species. Virulence is measured as a \"neuropathic index\" (NI) determined by intracerebral inoculation of day-old chicks. Lentogenic (NI 0.25: avirulent or mildly virulent), mesogenic (NI 0.6-1.8: intermediate virulence), and velogenic (NI 2.0: highly virulent) strains are differentiated. Paramyxovirus type 2 and 3 infections have been described in Passeriformes and parakeets with respiratory, enteric, and central nervous signs similar to those seen with PMV1.\n\nThree panzootics of ND occurred throughout the world between 1940 and 1948, between 1968 and 1972 , and during the 1980s, primarily involving racing pigeons (Kaleta and Hettels-Resmann, 1992 ). However, a wide range of domestic and wild bird species are susceptible to PMV including chickens, turkeys, pigeons, ducks, geese, and pheasants. Changes in global climate and the speed of modern transport to any location of the globe may explain the recent finding of NDV and 33% seroprevalence in penguins in Antarctica (Thomazelli et al., 2010) .\n\nThe clinical signs seen in birds infected with NDV vary widely and are dependent on many different factors (Alexander, 1995) . One important factor is the variability of the virus' virulence. ND ranges from unapparent to severe to fatal. Although none of the clinical signs can be regarded as pathognomonic, certain clinical signs do appear to be associated with particular ND isolates. This has resulted in the grouping of NDV into five pathotypes based on the predominant signs in affected chickens (Alexander, 1995) : 1. Viscerotropic velogenic: High mortality with swelling of tissues around the eyes, bloody diarrhea, and hemorrhagic lesions in proventriculus and intestines.\n\n2. Neurotropic velogenic: High mortality followed by respiratory and nervous signs, characterized by paresis of limbs, wings, ataxia, torticollis, circling movements, and tremors. 3. Mesogenic: Respiratory signs, occasional nervous signs, head tics (falcon), and mortality is moderate to low. 4. Respiratory lentogenic: Mild or subclinical respiratory infection. 5. Asymptomatic enteric: Subclinical enteric infection. These five groupings are by no means clear cut. In all bird species overlapping does occur. Acute and subacute disease associated with mesogenic and lentogenic virus strains are most common in developed countries with modern poultry industries (Fenner et al., 1987) .\n\nDisease in chickens may consist of signs of depression, diarrhea, and nervous signs such as paralysis and torticollis. In layers, a drop in egg production to complete cessation of egg laying may follow the disease (Mayr, 1993) . In pigeons, quail, and houbara bustards, Wernery et al. (1995) and Wernery and Manvell (2003) reported viscerotropic very rarely, torticollis (Wernery et al., 1992) . It is known that virulent strains may still replicate in vaccinated birds but the clinical signs will be greatly diminished in relation to the antibody level achieved (Alexander, 1995) .\n\nLesions are highly variable, reflecting the variation in tropism and pathogenicity of NDV. As with clinical signs, no gross or microscopic changes are pathognomonic for any form of ND. Gross pathologic findings include hemorrhagic lesions throughout the intestines with typical petechiae in the proventriculus. Hemorrhagic changes and congestion are seen in the respiratory tract when respiratory signs are present. In birds showing neurologic signs before death, there is no evidence of lesions in the brain. In falcons with clinically reported gastrointestinal signs, the crop, proventriculus, ventriculus, and enteral tract are usually empty, apart from a considerable amount of bile, which stains parts of the duodenal and jejunal mucosa. In falcons with head tics and paralysis no gross lesions are detected.\n\nMicroscopic lesions have no diagnostic significance. In most tissues and organs where changes occur, hyperemia, necrosis, and edema are found. In the central nervous system nonpurulent encephalomyelitis may occur. In many birds mild to severe demyelinization in the cerebrum is observed.\n\nBecause clinical signs and pathologic lesions are relatively nonspecific, diagnosis must be confirmed by virus isolation and to a lesser extent by serology. It is necessary to isolate NDV from infected birds and characterize the virus to exclude viruses of low virulence, which are ubiquitous in feral birds throughout the world, and live vaccines. The virus may be isolated from spleen, brain, or lung by allantoic inoculation of 10-to 12-day-old embryonated eggs or through infection of tissue culture chicken embryo fibroblasts. NDV is differentiated from other viruses by hemagglutination and hemagglutination inhibition and neurotropic pathotypes with diarrhea and nervous signs. Falcons suffering from PMV1 infections initially show gastrointestinal signs such as anorexia, vomiting, and paralytic ileus. Later in the course of the disease central nervous system signs develop. These signs are associated with ataxia, head tics, tremors, wing and leg paralysis and, tests using polyclonal antisera. An assessment of the virulence of an NDV isolate is important and a number of in vivo tests are available like the intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) and the intravenous pathogenicity index performed on specific pathogen-free chicken of different ages (Hitchner et al., 1980) . The mean death time, which is performed by inoculating the allantoic cavity of 9-to 10-day-old embryos, classifies isolates as velogenic (less than 60 hours to kill), mesogenic (60-90 hours to kill), and lentogenic (more than 90 hours to kill). Molecular techniques like real-time RT-PCRs have been used to detect NDV in clinical specimens such as oropharyngeal or fecal swabs.\n\nAirborne infections are an increasingly important factor in veterinary centers, quarantine units, and breeding facilities. People who work in these centers are also susceptible to some airborne infections that can develop within them. Aspergillosis, mycoplasmosis, chlamydiosis, ND, and influenza are the common airborne infections, the source of which may be the birds themselves, the facility's staff, the facility itself, and built-in air-conditioning systems. A new mobile air-cleaning device/ infection control unit is available that significantly reduces and even eliminates airborne pollution (Mattei et al., 2002) . ND is a notifiable disease in most countries. Where the disease is enzootic, control can be achieved by proper hygiene combined with immunization. Live virus vaccines of naturally occurring lentogenic strains with an ICPI of less than 0.4 are commonly used. They are administered via drinking water, which must not contain chlorine or disinfectants, and via spraying. Vaccinated birds may shed the vaccine virus up to 15 days after vaccination.\n\nImmunization of exotic birds with live vaccines via drinking water is not useful because of the poor serologic response. Inactivated vaccines administered subcutaneously are usually used for pigeons, houbara bustards, pheasants, quail, and falcons. It might be more effective to use vaccines from locally derived strains (Wernery et al., 1995) .\n\nA killed vaccine, manufactured specifically against ND in falcons and containing strains from four different avian species, has been produced by the Central Veterinary Research Laboratory, Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The vaccine is widely used in falcons and has dramatically reduced PMV1 in hunting falcons.\n\nBackyard poultry production makes a significant contribution to poverty alleviation and food security in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the South Pacific. This is often threatened by severe outbreaks of ND and immunization of backyard poultry in rural and periurban areas is critical for maintaining healthy flocks to provide adequate nutrition and income for small families. A new ND vaccine can be directly administered in feed, drinking water, or reconstituted for ocular administration. The price of this new NDV-FDT vaccine is low, and the vaccine is stable at ambient temperatures (Lal et al., 2014) .\n\nPneumovirus infections have been observed with severe rhinotracheitis in turkeys and decreased egg production and \"swollen head syndrome\" in chickens. Pheasants, guinea fowl, and ostriches exhibit mild disease. Infections in turkeys and chickens are associated with sneezing, swelling of infraorbital sinuses, and conjunctivitis. The disease resembles mycoplasmosis. For the diagnosis of this disease, a commercial avian pneumovirus antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (FlockChek APV Test Kit) is available from IDEXX Laboratories containing the three serotypes A, B, and C.\n\nAlexander DJ: Newcastle disease, State Vet J 5: 21-24, 1995. Briand F-X, Massin P, Jestin V: Characterisation of a type 1 avian paramyxovirus belonging to a divergent group, Vet Microbiol 168: 25-33, 2014 . Fenner F, Bachmann PA, Gibbs EPJ, et al: Veterinary virology, New York, 1987 \n\nMore than 100 herpesviruses have been characterized and found in fish, amphibians, reptiles, humans, and in virtually every species of bird and mammal that has been investigated (Figs. 14-12 to 14-14). Their ubiquitous nature, evolutionary diversity, and involvement in many important medical and veterinary diseases make this group one of the most important global viruses. The classification of viruses within the family Herpesviridae is complex and not yet fully resolved. The family is divided into three subfamilies: Alphaherpesvirinae, Betaherpesvirinae, and Gammaherpesvirinae. All classified avian herpesviruses are within the genus Mardivirus and Iltovirus in the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae (Table 14-3) . Herpesviruses not assigned to a genus are listed in Table 14 -4. Classification into genera on the basis of the genome arrangement and serologic reactivity has just begun. The characteristic property of all herpesviruses is their lifelong persistence in the organism. They survive from generation to generation by establishing latent infections from which virus is periodically reactivated and shed. recently described in magnificent frigatebirds, which is named Fregata magnificens herpesvirus. Some of the herpesviruses have not even been listed by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (Box 14-2; Sandmeier, 2011).\n\nHerpesvirus characteristics, pathogenicity, and host specificity and the antigenic relationship among them are poorly understood (Mayr, 1993) . Avian herpesviruses are only pathogenic to birds and vary widely in their virulence. The viruses are highly adapted to their natural hosts as a result of coevolution. A number of herpesviruses such as Marek's disease virus (gallid HV-2, GaHV-2) have been implicated in neoplastic transformation. The herpesvirus virion is enveloped by an icosahedral capsid consisting of 162 capsomers. Within the core of the nucleocapsid lies the genome, a single molecule of linear double-stranded DNA.\n\nHerpesviruses are readily grown in cell cultures derived from their natural host species. Alphaherpesvirinae produce a rapid cytopathic effect whereas Betaherpesvirinae and Gammaherpesvirinae are slowly cytopathogenic in cell culture but produce similar intranuclear inclusion bodies. Intranuclear inclusion bodies are characteristic of herpesvirus infections and can usually be found in tissues from herpesvirus-infected birds and in appropriately fixed and stained cell cultures. Free herpesviruses are very sensitive to all disinfectants with virucidal properties and a temperature of 55\u00b0 C (131\u00b0 F) inactivates herpesviruses within seconds (Fenner et al., 1987) .\n\nAvian herpesviruses in Table 14 -3 cause hemorrhagic or neoplastic diseases and are of great importance to the commercial poultry industry. Many herpesviruses cause necrotic lesions, mainly in the liver and spleen, but some do cause hemorrhagic or neoplastic lesions, whereas others seem to be nonpathogenic (Table 14 -5). Some of the important herpesvirus diseases are discussed separately and, for completeness, herpesvirus that do not cause disease are mentioned at the end of this chapter.\n\nIn 1907 the Hungarian physician-pathologist J\u00f3zsef Marek described paralysis associated with a polyneuritis affecting some domestic fowl kept in his backyard. For about 50 years Marek's disease was considered to be part of a large group of diseases referred to as the avian leukosis complex. The specific herpesvirus etiology of Marek's disease, however, was established in 1967.\n\nMarek's disease is a contagious, lymphoproliferative disease of chickens caused by Marek's disease virus (MDV) and is prevalent wherever domestic poultry industry is found. It is a World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) listed avian disease occasionally detected in pheasants, turkeys, quail, and francolins (Mayr, 1993) . The virus is slowly cytopathic and remains highly cell associated, so cell-free infectious virus is virtually impossible to obtain. MDV is an oncogenic herpesvirus, named GaHV-2. The virus is immunologically unique and is closely related to the herpesvirus of turkeys (HVT Note the multiple miliary necrotic lesions in the liver. An attenuated herpesvirus vaccine for falcons has been produced by CVRL, Dubai. Many of the avian herpesviruses are not assigned to a genus. Internal papilloma disease in psittacines is also most probably caused by psittacid herpesvirus 1 (PsHV-1), and a new herpesvirus in African grey parrots (Psittacus erithacus) has been described and tentatively named psittacid herpesvirus 2 (PsHV-2). A new herpesvirus has been Marek's disease is a progressive disease with variable signs. Four overlapping syndromes are described (Fenner et al., 1987) : \u2022 Neurolymphomatosis (classical Marek's disease) is an asymmetric paralysis of one or both legs or wings-one leg is held forward and the other backward. \u2022 Acute Marek's disease occurs in explosive outbreaks in which a large proportion of birds in a flock shows depression followed after a few days by ataxia and paralysis; there are no localizing neurologic signs. \u2022 Ocular lymphomatosis is recognized when the iris of one or both eyes is gray in color because of lymphoblastoid cell infiltration; there may be partial or total blindness. \u2022 Cutaneous Marek's disease is readily recognized after plucking, when round nodular lesions up to 1 cm in diameter are observed, particularly at feather follicles.\n\nMarek's disease is characterized by a mononuclear infiltrate within peripheral nerves and other tissues and organs. In the vast majority of cases a diagnosis can be made if the celiac, cranial, intercostal, mesenteric, brachial, sciatic, and greater splanchnic nerves are examined. In diseased birds, these nerves are up to three times their normal diameter.\n\nLymphomatous lesions, indistinguishable from those of avian leukosis, appear in the gonads, heart, proventriculus, and lungs but are seldom found in the bursa of Fabricius, which in cases of avian leukosis, is the site of most tumor development. Many apparently healthy birds are lifelong carriers and shedders of the virus. The virus is not transmitted in ovo. Marek's disease and avian leukosis are usually present in the same flock and both diseases also may occur in the same bird. The two diseases were long confused but can be differentiated by clinical and pathologic features (Table 14-6) and by specific viral and antibody tests. Congenital infection does not occur and chicks are protected by maternal antibodies for the first few weeks of life. They then become infected by inhaling virus dust. Epizootics of Marek's disease usually involve adult birds 2 to 5 months old and there is a high mortality rate of about 80%.\n\nDiagnosis of MD should be based on a combination of clinical signs, gross and microscopic pathology, and laboratory testing including MDV isolation, PCR, or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Differentiation of Marek's disease from lymphoid leukosis The production of chickens on the \"all-in, all-out\" principle would improve the efficacy of vaccination as a control measure, and a combination of three methods is used to control Marek's disease: vaccination, isolation and sanitation procedures, and breeding of resistant stock.\n\nThis Alphaherpesvirus infection was first recognized in 1923 in the Netherlands, where it was initially diagnosed as influenza; subsequently, it was recognized as a major disease in North America, China, India, and Europe. In addition to domestic ducks, free-living ducks, geese, swans, and other waterfowl are equally susceptible (Fenner et al., 1987) . Major epizootics occur worldwide, and migratory waterfowl may contribute to outbreaks within and among continents. Duck viral enteritis is an OIE-listed disease.\n\nVirus strains vary in their virulence, although only a single antigenic type has been recognized. The virus grows on the chorioallantoic membrane of embryonated duck eggs and in duck embryo fibroblasts but poorly or not at all in chicken cells. As with members of this family, there is evidence that this virus can establish a latent infection.\n\nClinical signs of duck enteritis include depression, a drop in egg production, ruffled and dull feathers, ocular and nasal discharge, anorexia, labored breathing, watery diarrhea, extreme thirst, and ataxia followed by death. Morbidity and mortality vary from 5% to 100%. Lesions seen at necropsy are typical of vascular damage. Blood is present in the body cavities including gizzard and intestinal lumens. Petechial hemorrhages and focal necrosis are present in many tissues. Herpesvirus inclusions are most readily demonstrated in hepatocytes, intestinal epithelium, and lymphoid tissues, which can be used for diagnosis in combination with fluorescent antibody (FA) technique, virus isolation, and PCR.\n\nIngestion of contaminated water is thought to be the major mode of transmission, although the virus may also be transmitted by contact. is important and is usually based on the age of birds affected, incidence of disease, and histopathological findings. Serum antibodies to GaHV-2 may be detected using agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID), ELISA, indirect immunofluorescence, and virus neutralization. The current vaccination programs for Marek's disease have effectively decreased its natural incidence, but the eradication of Marek's disease from flocks of chickens is impossible. The vaccination prevents the development of the disease but not MDV infection. It is certain that there are no chicken flocks in the field that are completely free of MDV. Therefore isolation of MDV or antibody detection in such flocks is not a valid criterion for a diagnosis (Castro and Heuschele, 1992) .\n\nMarek's disease vaccines are injected in ovo at the 17th or 18th day of embryonation or subcutaneously at hatch. Avirulent strains of MDV are used as vaccines, but the antigenically related turkey Gammaherpesvirus is the preferred vaccine strain because it infects cells productively. Chicken or duck embryo attenuated strains are used for immunization in combination with hygiene measures.\n\nThis viral disease of domestic fowl is an OIE-listed disease that was first observed in the United States in 1926. It occurs among chickens worldwide, and it is rarely recognized as a cause of disease in other avian species (Fig. 14-17 ). It is caused by the gallid herpesvirus 1 (GaHV-1). Strains of the virus vary considerably in virulence but are antigenically homogenous. Infectious laryngotracheitis is an acute, highly contagious respiratory disease of domestic fowl characterized by distressed breathing with loud gasping, coughing, and expectoration of bloody mucus. However, signs and lesions can vary from peracute to mild. Birds of all ages are susceptible but disease is most common in those aged 4 to 18 months. In peracute infectious laryngotracheitis mortality can exceed 50% of the flock, and in acute infectious laryngotracheitis mortality is reduced to 10% to 15%, although morbidity is as high as in the peracute form. Chronic or mild infectious laryngotracheitis forms are of low morbidity and mortality (2% to 5%). The disease is always accompanied by lowered egg production. In infectious laryngotracheitis, there is severe laryngotracheitis characterized by necrosis, hemorrhage, ulceration, and the formation of diphtheritic membranes. Bloody mucoid pseudomembranes (casts) along the trachea lead to death through asphyxiation. The extensive diphtheritic membrane formation and death from asphyxia prompted the designation \"fowl diphtheria.\" Infections with infectious laryngotracheitis virus are transmitted by direct or indirect contact but are not transmitted within eggs from infected chickens. The virus is shed through conjunctival excretions, tracheal mucus, and feces. The virus can become latent in the trigeminal ganglia of infected birds. Carrier birds shed the infectious laryngotracheitis virus intermittently throughout their lives.\n\nClinical and necropsy findings are characteristic for infectious laryngotracheitis. FA staining of smears and tissues and isolation of the virus from tracheal mucus, either by inoculation on the chorioallantoic membrane of embryonated eggs or cell cultures, confirm the diagnosis. Giemsa staining for infectious laryngotracheitis intranuclear inclusion bodies in virus-infected syncytial cells of the tracheal epithelium is another method of diagnosing infectious laryngotracheitis. Immunofluorescence tests for viral antigens using tracheal scrapings, AGID with tracheal exudates, ELISA assays detecting viral antigen, and PCRs are also important diagnostic test methods.\n\nFor control, site quarantine and hygiene measures should be the first approach. Immunization with attenuated live-virus vaccine via instillation of eye drops, spray, or drinking water protects birds against clinical disease but does not protect against infection with virulent virus or the development of a latent carrier status for either the virulent or the vaccine viruses. Despite a proper vaccination program it is to be expected that virulent virus persists in flocks and that some losses caused by infectious laryngotracheitis, either alone or in combination with other pathogens, will continue. There have been recent promising studies in the efficiency of a genetically engineered vaccine.\n\nPacheco disease was first detected in 1929 in psittacine birds from a zoologic park in Brazil and confirmed as an avian herpesvirus in the United States. The disease is characterized by depression, biliverdinuria, and diarrhea and in some birds neurologic signs also were observed. The disease causes high mortality and is highly contagious. When necropsied there are often no gross pathologic alterations, but on histopathology necrotizing lesions and hemorrhages are observed in liver and other organs. So far four genotypes and five serotypes are known (Table 14-7) . It seems that papillomas often found in psittacines are also caused by PsHV-1.\n\nClinically healthy but persistently infected birds can be identified by herpes PCR testing of choanal and cloacal swabs and blood.\n\nThree distinct herpesviruses causing hepatosplenitis have been isolated from raptors: \u2022 Inclusion body hepatitis of falcons: falconid HV-1 (FaHV-1).\n\n\u2022 Inclusion body hepatitis of owls: strigid HV-1 (SHV-1).\n\n\u2022 Inclusion body hepatitis of eagles: accipitrid HV-1 (AHV-1). Raptor herpesviruses cause a fatal disease in birds of prey characterized by multifocal necrosis of the liver and spleen (Wheler, 1993) . Clinical signs are nonspecific and range from sudden death to severe depression, anorexia, regurgitation, and weakness followed by death (Wheler, 1993; Remple, 1995) . Very typical of the disease is the appearance of lime green urates in the feces. Microscopic lesions in liver and spleen reveal necrotic foci without any inflammatory response.\n\nIt has now been proven through sequence comparison that FaHV-1 and SHV-1 are identical to pigeon herpesvirus 1 (Gailbreath and Oaks, (Wernery and Kinne, 2004) . Diagnosis of this disease is confirmed by typical necropsy findings and by virus isolation from liver and spleen in chicken embryo fibroblasts followed by serologic identification. A cytopathic effect develops after 3 to 4 days that is characterized by foci of round refractile cells in the monolayer with subsequent formation of syncytia.\n\nHerpesvirus infections in falcons are a constant threat to falconry ( Fig. 14-18 ). The majority of herpesvirus infections occur in gyrfalcons and hybrids of this species, and it seems that this species has a greater susceptibility to the virus than other falcon species. Preliminary investigations have shown that falcons do not contract the infection orally but most probably ocularly and/or nasally (Wernery and Kinne, 2004) .\n\nNo commercial vaccine is available but scientists at the Central Veterinary Research Laboratory, Dubai, have developed an attenuated herpesvirus vaccine, the efficacy and safety of which have been proved in different vaccination trials (Remple, 1995; Wernery and Manvell, 2003; Wernery et al., 2001 Wernery et al., , 2003 .\n\nThese viruses include herpesviruses of cormorants, turkeys, and penguins. The phalacrocoracid HV-1 was isolated in 1951 from a single nesting cormorant on Lake Victoria, Australia. It is unrelated serologically to any of the other avian herpesviruses. No clinical, gross, or microscopic lesions have been associated with natural infections with turkey herpesvirus, which is serologically related to MDV. In two adult black-footed penguins that suffered from loss of condition and respiratory distress with microscopic lesions resembling infectious laryngotracheitis, inclusion bodies were detected in syncytial cells of the sinuses, trachea, and bronchi (Ritchie, 1995) . A herpesvirus has been recently isolated from the liver of a houbara bustard, but when the virus was subcutaneously injected into the same species no sickness was detected. \n\nThe poxviruses are a large family of complex viruses infecting many species of vertebrates, as well as arthropods , and members of the three genera (Orthopoxvirus, Yatapoxvirus, and Parapoxvirus) have zoonotic potential. However, infections of humans are generally associated with localized lesions rather than life-threatening illness, although severe diseases have occurred in immunocompromised patients. The most famous Orthopoxvirus infection is the cowpox, which has been exploited for the pivotal role of vaccination strategies and hence the global eradication of smallpox. Although the genus Avipoxvirus (Figs. 14-20 to 14-30) is divided into 10 defined species (Box 14-3), many avian pox isolates are not clearly classified, and their status within the genus is unclear or not known. It is, for example, not yet clear whether the turkeypox virus and eventually also the pigeonpox virus are only variants or serotypes of the fowlpox virus (Mayr, 1993) , which is the prototype of the avian poxviruses. Fowlpox is a term that describes a pox disease, particularly in chickens and turkeys. It is a World Organization for Animal Healthlisted disease.\n\nThe poxviruses are the largest and the most complex of all viruses. Avian poxviruses are only distantly related at the antigenic level to other poxvirus genera (Binns and Smith, 1992) . Fowlpox, pigeonpox, and turkeypox viruses are closely related and not strictly host specific. Under natural conditions they produce a disease in avians only, and their virions are larger than those of other poxviruses. The virions are typically brick shaped with dimensions of about 330 \u00d7 280 \u00d7 200 nm. The genome consists of a linear, nonsegmented, and covalently closed, double-stranded DNA, which encodes for about 150 to 300 different proteins. Avian poxviruses are antigenically and immunologically distinguishable from each other to an extent, but various degrees of cross-relationships exist. The genetic profiles of fowlpox, pigeonpox, and juncopox viruses appear similar, but the genetic profiles of quailpox, canarypox, and mynapox viruses are fairly different from that of fowlpox.\n\nPoxviruses are resistant to ambient temperatures and may survive many years in dried scabs. Orthopoxviruses and most avipoxviruses are ether resistant, but parapoxvirus, capripoxviruses, and leporipoxviruses are ether sensitive (Fenner et al., 1987) . Fowlpox virus is inactivated by 1% caustic potash. It withstands 1% phenol and 1 : 1000 formalin for 9 days.\n\nAvian pox is a common viral disease of domestic and free-living birds that occurs worldwide. The disease has been reported in more than 70 species of free-living birds representing 20 families (Castro and Heuschele, 1992) .\n\nAvian pox is a relatively slow-spreading viral disease characterized by the development of two major forms and one minor form. The cutaneous form occurs through bites of arthropods that serve as vectors for the transmission of the virus. The diphtheric form is caused by inhalation or ingestion of the virus. It is associated with higher mortality and more severe lesions. A third, pneumonia-like form has been observed in canaries. Unfortunately, despite the complete sequencing of the direct contact with infected birds or their fomites. Poxviruses cannot pass intact skin and must enter the body through abrasions or cuts.\n\nIn the diphtheritic or wet pox form, the lesions occur on the mucous membranes of the mouth, nares, pharynx, larynx, esophagus, or trachea. This form is probably caused by aerosol infection. Tracheal lesions can cause difficulties in breathing, and the signs can resemble those of infectious laryngotracheitis in chickens and vitamin A deficiency. The diphtheric form often turns into a septicemic or systemic form, as recently reported in waterfowl (Anonymous, 2004) and houbara bustards (Kinne et al., 2007) .\n\nDuring the septicemic form of the disease, only general clinical signs such as somnolence, cyanosis, and fatigue are observed in infected birds (canaries) without any cutaneous lesions. In these cases the virus may be found in the lungs. Areas of necrosis in the myocardium are also described (Mayr, 1993) .\n\nThe virus multiplies at the site of entry resulting in formation of primary lesions. Pox lesions in the skin follow a typical developmental sequence. They commence as erythematous macules and become papular and then vesicular. The vesicles develop into pustules with a depressed center and raised, often erythematous edges. These lesions are the so-called pocks. The pustules rupture and a crust forms on the surface, and dry crusts fall off and leave residual scars. Histologically, pox lesions start as epidermal cytoplasmic swelling, vacuolation, ballooning degeneration, and production of intraepithelial vesicles affecting the cells of the outer stratum spinosum. Additional dermal lesions include edema and vascular dilatation and, at a later date, perivascular mononuclear and neutrophilic cell infiltration. Mucosal lesions are briefly vesicular and develop into ulcers rather than pustules.\n\nDuring outbreaks of wet and systemic pox in houbara bustards and waterfowl, multiple discrete, pale yellow/cream-colored, raised necrotic lesions were irregularly distributed across the oropharyngeal mucosa, which can be easily confused with trichomoniasis. Mucoid rhinitis and tracheitis were also observed. Additionally, the birds had a focal bronchopneumonia with miliary necroses; a swollen, hemorrhagic and enlarged pancreas; and hepatomegaly. It is believed that inhalation or ingestion of virus-contaminated material may cause the diphtheritic canarypox and fowlpox genomes little is known about the phylogenetic relationship between the two sequenced poxviruses and the other avipoxviruses and how this may relate to pathogenicity, epidemiology, and host range.\n\nThe cutaneous or dry pox form is characterized by the appearance of nodular scabs on various parts of unfeathered skin. The lesions vary in size and appearance. Removal of scabs leaves a hemorrhagic moist surface. When the crusts are dry they drop off, leaving scars. Mechanical transmission of the avian poxvirus by arthropods, especially mosquitoes, provides a mechanism for transfer of the virus between varieties of different bird species. The cutaneous form, which is most common, probably results from infection by biting arthropods or by form of avian pox. Malnutrition, stress, or concurrent disease may contribute to outbreaks.\n\nAlthough pox lesions are easy to recognize, laboratory tests should be performed to confirm the diagnosis. Because of the large size and distinctive structure of poxvirus virions, electron microscopic examination of scab material or other lesions is the preferred method of laboratory diagnosis. Avian poxviruses produce pocks on the chorioallantoic membrane of embryonated hen's eggs, and viruses grow productively, but also abortively, in avian cell lines (Samour et al., 1996) . The virus multiplies in the cytoplasm of infected cells with the formation of inclusion bodies (Bollinger bodies) or elementary bodies (Borrel bodies), which can be stained with different staining methods. The specificity of the viral inclusions can be determined by fluorescent antibody and immunoperoxidase methods. Suitable serologic tests for the detection of antibodies include passive hemagglutination, agar gel immunodiffusion test, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.\n\nThe vaccinia virus has become famous as a vector for expressing heterologous genes into its genome and using it for the production of recombinant vaccines. This is a relatively new approach with a potentially wide application in veterinary medicine. Avian poxviruses are not yet being used in this new method.\n\nFor prophylactic immunization against avian pox, live attenuated vaccines are commercially available. Chickenpox, pigeonpox, and turkeypox virus strains are used to protect many different avian species with varying degrees of success. Pigeonpox vaccines are less immunogenic and their immunity does not last very long. Pigeonpox vaccines and turkeypox vaccines are used in falcons with varying degrees of success. An attenuated falconpox vaccine has been successfully used in the Middle East for several years (Kaaden et al., 1995, Wernery and Manvell, 2003) . A canarypox vaccine has also been established for the vaccination of pet birds and an attenuated houbara bustard pox vaccine protects against dry and wet pox (Wernery et al., 2007) .\n\nVaccination procedures are often used in combination with insecticide spraying to reduce the number of arthropods. The live attenuated vaccines are administered either subcutaneously (wing web method) or intramuscularly (canarypox).\n\nChlamydiosis is an infectious disease caused by a gram-negative obligate intracellular organism (Figs. 14-31 to 14-33 and Table 14-8).\n\nThe etiologic agent is Chlamydia psittaci. The species is divided in serotypes (genotypes).\n\nThe infection occurs worldwide.\n\nPsittacines: Genotype A (considered the major genotype for human psittacosis) Bacterial Diseases\n\nImpression smears of organs (spleen, lung, liver, and intestinal contents) and lesions, stained with Stamp, give a first impression. Cultivation methods are laborious, time-consuming, and replaced by serologic techniques. Serologic tests are available. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test is fairly sensitive, although it only indicates previous contact with the agent and false-negatives are possible. The prevalent method is the outer membrane protein A (ompA) genotypespecific real-time polymerase chain reaction. Materials to be sent (before treatment with antimicrobial agents) for testing include: 1. Whole blood submitted in a heparin ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid containing tube (0.2 cc minimum). 2. Cloacal swab (collected on cotton-tipped wooden sticks and shipped in a specific transport medium) 3. Feces sample submitted in a sterile container\n\nThe therapeutic regimen should be meticulously and conscientiously followed to reach a favorable result.\n\n\u2022 Enrofloxacin 10 to 15 mg/kg bodyweight. \u2022 Doxycycline 75 mg/kg intramuscularly (IM) in the breast musculature, 9 injections at 5-day intervals. \u2022 Chlortetracycline (CTC) 10 mg/kg orally daily over 45 days. CTC can also he dosed orally with specific medicated food or as a selfmade prescription of a boiled mixture of seeds, rice, and water (2 : 2 : 3), to which 5% CTC is added. \u2022 Stress must be minimized in the infected bird or flock. Breeding must be stopped. Any concurrent disease must be treated. If medicated pellets are to be used, the bird should be gradually converted to a pelleted diet. Supportive therapy, especially with multivitamins, is indicated. \u2022 Prevention in the clinic or laboratory with 1 : 1000 dilution of quaternary ammonium compounds (alkyldimethylbenzylammonium chloride, e.g., Roccal or Zephiran) is effective, as well as 70% isopropyl alcohol, 1% Lysol, 1 : 100 dilution of household bleach (2 1/2 tablespoons per gallon), or chlorophenols.\n\nGeneralized chronic disseminated, granulomatous infectious disease caused by acid-fast bacteria (Figs. 14-34 to 14-41 and Table 14-9).\n\nThe etiologic agent is Mycobacterium avium complex; i.e., M. avium, M genavense, M. intracellulare, and other strains. In some regions, M. genavense outnumbers the cases of M. avium (Tell et al. 2001) .Various serotypes of M. avium occur. Geographic differences in the distribution of serotypes exist. In psittacines and wood pigeons (Columba palumbus) a specific enteric infection occurs that resembles paratuberculosis. On the basis of DNA analysis the \"wood pigeon\" mycobacteria are classified as M. avium subsp. columbae (Saxegaard and Baess, 1988) .\n\nThe infection occurs worldwide.\n\nIn principle all birds are susceptible to M. avium/intracellulare and M. genavense; however, the disease is rare in budgerigars and psittacines. Both species reveal a characteristic ingestion infection. The lesions are \n\nRespiratory infections are especially important in the spread of the disease because nasal secretions may be rich in organisms, and feces also may contain large numbers of organisms. Other infective materials include tears, ocular exudate, and crop food or crop milk. Direct infection from bird to bird is accomplished through crop milk in pigeons. Indirect infection occurs via inhalation of droplets of nasal secretion or dried fecal particles. The new host is infected via the epithelia of either the respiratory or the digestive tract. When birds are caught in an aviary, whirling dust mixed with dried feces and feather particles is inhaled deeply both by birds and humans. Additional stress can evoke a manifest disease in latent carriers. primarily located in the intestinal tract, liver, and spleen, to be distributed to all organs at a later stage. In canaries and, in particular, Gouldian finches the lesions are located especially in the lungs. Woodpeckers showing an enlarged abdomen revealed an even distribution of acidfast organisms accumulated in large numbers in macrophages. M. avium subsp. columbae is found in wood pigeons and psittacines located primarily in the intestinal villi.\n\nTransmission is mainly by oral uptake, especially in open tuberculosis (shedding via feces). Infection by aspiration is extremely rare in birds. It occurs especially in ducks when a fountain sprouts mud loaded with the bacteria. Infection is by direct contact, (i.e., conjunctivitis in ducks searching for food in the bacilli-loaded floor of a pond).\n\nRadiologic examination (Psittaciformes) reveals enlarged liver, spleen, and/or small intestine. Diagnosis is made by endoscopic examination of parenchymatous organs with biopsy and examination for acid-fast organisms. Fecal examination is performed for acid-fast organisms (episodes of nonshedding may occur). Examination of blood reveals leukocytosis and heterophilia. Blood test with ELISA is especially suitable for flock diagnosis. At postmortem impression, smears of lesions stained with Hemacolor, Giemsa, or a comparable stain may reveal macrophages with rod-shaped blank spaces in the protoplasm, representing the unstained mycobacteria.\n\nIn view of the zoonotic capacities of the various mycobacterium species involved, therapy is not applied. Prevention is long-duration quarantine (3 to 5 months) for birds to be introduced into a colony.\n\nGeneralized disseminated infectious disease caused by gram-negative bacteria (Figs. 14-42 and 14-43 and Table 14-10).\n\nThe etiologic agent is Yersinia pseudotuberculosis (serotypes 1 and 2).\n\nThe infection occurs worldwide.\n\nA wide variety of Passeriformes are susceptible, in particular aracaris and toucans. The disease is rare in budgerigars, Psittaciformes, and pigeons.\n\nTransmission is by fecal contact and by food contaminated by feces from small rodents. \n\nTreatment includes antibiotics (bactericidal, e.g., ampicillin 1000-2000 mg or amoxicillin 200-400 mg per liter of water) over a period of 14 days and eventually longer and third-generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones. In canaries, enrofloxacin offers promising results (Haesebrouck et al., 1995) . Prevention includes good hygiene. Prevent contact with free-living birds. Stores for seeds used as food should be rodent proof. Mice, offered as food to larger birds, should be laboratory bred. Larger birds (toucans) can be vaccinated with a killed vaccine (Zwart et al., 1981) .\n\nSalmonellosis (Figs. 14-44 to 14-47 and Table 14 -11) is a contagious infection caused by a gram-negative coccobacillus.\n\nThe etiologic agent is Salmonella spp. and in general is S. enterica serovar Typhimurium (Porwollik et al. 2004 ). In racing pigeons, it is the serotype Typhimurium var. Copenhagen (which lacks the antigen 05).\n\nSalmonellosis occurs worldwide, especially in outdoor aviaries. Newly arrived individuals can introduce the disease. \n\nSusceptible species include racing pigeons and Passeriformes with occasional infections in Psittaciformes (including the budgerigar). Young pigeons and weakened birds in general are susceptible. Deficient feeding (old seeds and rancid vitamin preparations on an oil base); overcrowding; and a cold, humid climate are predisposing factors.\n\nThe infection is most often transmitted by oral uptake, either during crop feeding or via contaminated foods, or by birds roosting in the aviary. Aerogenic transmission is known. Birds may become infected by carrier birds and occasionally by humans.\n\nDiagnosis is made from clinical signs (especially arthritis [pigeon]), postmortem findings, and bacteriologic examination (use enrichment media).\n\nClinically ill animals are separated and eventually euthanized (Passeriformes, budgerigars, and pigeons). According to the resistance test, antibiotics are used over a period of 14 to 21 days. The result of the therapy is checked by culture between 3 and 6 weeks after treatment is finished. Occasionally therapy must be repeated. Hygiene is essential, especially in caged and aviary birds (Passeriformes, budgerigars, and pigeons).\n\nTo prevent spread from other infected flocks, owners should be warned not to participate in bird exhibitions during the season because of the risk of carriers.\n\nColibacillosis (Figs. 14-48 and 14-49 and Table 14-12) is a contagious infectious disease caused by a gram-negative bacterium.\n\nThe etiologic agent is E. coli (various serotypes), eventually in association with other Enterobacteriaceae or Candida spp. infections (Prattis et al., 1990) .\n\nThe infection occurs worldwide.\n\nAlmost all species of bird at a given time may suffer from colibacillosis.\n\nThe infection is transmitted by oral uptake of E. coli from the environment and excreters. Poor hygiene, overcrowding, stress factors, nutritional deficiencies, and concomitant infections are important factors in outbreaks.\n\nDiagnosis is made postmortem and with bacteriologic examination. If possible serotyping of the E. coli is done. In seed-eating Passeriformes, budgerigars, and other Psittaciformes, a fecal smear stained with Hemacolor will reveal large numbers of rod-shaped bacteria. In contrast, healthy birds in the groups previously mentioned that have little contact with feces harbor only minimal numbers of bacteria in the intestinal tract. \n\nPasteurellosis (Table 14 -13) is a contagious infectious disease caused by a gram-negative bacterium.\n\nThe etiologic agent is Pasteurella multocida (several serotypes) and occasionally P. gallinarum.\n\nThe infection occurs worldwide.\n\nThe disease occurs with low frequency in canaries and budgerigars and is very rare in pigeons. Weakened young and old individuals develop the disease.\n\nThe disease is transmitted by bites of cats and rats. Contact with contaminated rodent feces is also considered in the transmission of the disease.\n\nDiagnosis is made with clinical signs, bite wounds, bacteriologic examination of secretions, and postmortem examination. Blood smear reveals large numbers of bipolar bacteria. \n\nTreatment includes wound care. Antibiotics are dosed according to sensitivity test. If such a test is not available, then doxycycline (75 to 100 mg/kg IM every second day over a period of 6 to 8 days) may prove to be effective. Prevention is by hygiene and cat- and ratproof construction of aviaries.\n\nDifferent species of bacteria may cause small epidemics or disease among the birds under consideration (Figs. 14-50 to 14-52 and Table  14-14) .\n\n\u2022 Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae \u2022 Listeria monocytogenes \u2022 Streptococcus spp. and Staphylococcus spp.; in pigeons, especially Streptococcus bovis (Devriese et al., 1990) \u2022 Helicobacter jejuni \u2022 Klebsiella spp.\n\n\u2022 Pseudomonas/Aeromonas spp.\n\nThese infections are widespread.\n\n\u2022 E. rhusiopathiae is very rare in Passeriformes, budgerigars, Psittaciformes, and pigeons. Pseudomonas aeruginosa in lymph vessels situated around the blood vessels, a consequence of nebulizing water containing the microorganism in a canary. H&E, \u00d7400.\n\n\u2022 Canaries, pigeons, and parrots are susceptible to L. monocytogenes.\n\n\u2022 Streptococci and staphylococci are frequent in Passeriformes, budgerigars (especially birds in poor condition), and Psittaciformes, and enteric infections with S. bovis are especially seen in pigeons..\n\nies. Rare in budgerigars, Psittaciformes, and pigeons. \u2022 Klebsiella spp. occur occasionally in canaries; frequently in ornamental finches and other Passeriformes; and very rare in budgerigars, Psittaciformes, and pigeons. \u2022 Pseudomonas/Aeromonas spp. occur occasionally in Passeriformes and in immunosuppressed (antibiotic treatment) budgerigars, but are rare in pigeons.\n\n\u2022 E. rhusiopathiae is transmitted orally by contact with contaminated food or water; trauma will occasionally provide an entry. \u2022 L. monocytogenes is believed to be transmitted by contact with rats. \u2022 Streptococci and staphylococci enter via lesions of the mucosa in the oral cavity, digestive tract, respiratory tract, and/or conjunctiva. \u2022 H. jejuni is likely to be transmitted by oral contact. Birds with diminished resistance are especially susceptible. This is generally caused by poor-quality food (lack of animal protein, vitamins, and minerals) or poor management (overcrowding, humidity, and cold environment \n\nThis fungal disease of the respiratory system (Figs. 14-53 to 14-74) is the most commonly occurring disease among wild birds held in captivity and is an occasional, but always possible, problem in companion birds. Rarely, it occurs among free-living birds that have become otherwise debilitated through injury or inanition. Although it may occur in individuals of virtually any species, there are clearly species predilections. Among North American raptors, goshawks (Accipiter gentilis), gyr falcons (Falco rusticolus), immature redtailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis), golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos), and snowy owls (Nyctea scandiaca) are more likely to develop the disease. There is a tendency for raptors originating from arctic or subarctic climates to be more susceptible. A very useful and comprehensive review of aspergillosis in birds was published by Beernaert et al. (2010) . Several species of Aspergillus (A. nigricans, A. terreus, A. nidulans, A. glaucus, and A. flavus) may be involved in any of the common forms of this disease. In most clinical presentations among captive companion and falconry birds, A. fumigatus is by far the most commonly encountered organism. However, the occurrence of other species can lead to some of the variations seen in pathogenesis and response to treatment. Additionally, available serologic tests are highly specific for A. fumigatus and do not necessarily detect antibodies formed in response to one of the other species.\n\nText continued on p. 468 Fungal Diseases FIGURE 14-53 In one actual case of acute aspergillosis, a gyrfalcon (Falco rusticolus) was housed in a chamber adjacent to another in which a pointer dog was kept, separated by a short divider. A few days after straw was spread on the floor for the dog, the falcon succumbed to acute aspergillosis.\n\nThis pair of lungs was removed from a juvenile golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) that was admitted in severe respiratory distress and showing signs of an encounter with a porcupine. It was speculated that, in attempting to subdue the quilled prey item, the eagle inhaled a large number of spores that were present in leaf litter or other ground detritus. (Courtesy The Raptor Center, University of Minnesota.) FIGURE 14-55 These lungs were removed from a gyrfalcon that was housed in a mews adjacent to a hayfield. The hay had been cut, but was rained on before being baled. After a week, the hay was turned with a hay rake and baled. A few days later the gyrfalcon succumbed acutely to aspergillosis. The lungs were hard and studded with thousands of miliary granulomas from which Aspergillus fumigatus was cultured. (Courtesy The Raptor Center, University of Minnesota.) FIGURE 14-56 Chronic aspergillosis lesions removed from the air sacs of a gyrfalcon and displayed as they appeared in situ. The large mass anterior to the heart was found in the interclavicular air sac, a site that is more often affected in gyrfalcons than in other raptors. (Courtesy The Raptor Center, University of Minnesota.) The exudative lesion was secondary to an extensive lacerating wound, which had previously been treated with a hydroactive vapor seal dressing. The lesion eventually responded to daily application of enilconazole (dilution 10 : 1). Marked improvement occurred after 7 days and complete resolution within 12 d. It was necessary to debride the lesion extensively before each application. (Courtesy N.A. Forbes.)\n\nSubtle changes in behavior such as a decrease in preening activity, failure to bathe, or otherwise engage in routine activities are sometimes the first signs of the development of aspergillosis.\n\nAnother early sign of developing aspergillosis is partial anorexia. Affected birds may vigorously grasp a food item, pluck a few feathers from it, then sit with it clenched in their talons. If offered small pieces of meat by hand, they will take them in their beak and fling them away. Such behavior also may reflect gastrointestinal disease of other etiologies.\n\nLoss of stamina or ability to pursue quarry may be an early sign of developing aspergillosis.\n\nThe affected bird may mount to a regular pitch and begin its stoop when quarry is flushed, but quickly give up the chase and alight on the ground or an elevated perch, clearly out of breath.\n\nTracheal culturing is conducted by passing a small nasopharyngeal swab deep into the trachea. This may be done with or without anesthesia. The material recovered on the swab is transferred immediately to Sabouraud dextrose agar and cultured at 37\u00b0 C (98.6\u00b0 F). Growth is typically apparent in 48 hours, but may require up to a week. Alternatively saline, at the rate of 3 cc/kg, may be flushed into the trachea, recovered by aspiration, and cultured in similar fashion. Cytologic examination may also be conducted on recovered material. Fungal Diseases FIGURE 14-65 Air sacs may be cultured by irrigation and recovery of saline: 3 to 5 mL/kg may be injected through the body wall into the last intercostal space and recovered by aspiration with a urinary catheter or similar device. The recovered material is cultured and/or examined cytologically. In early stages of growth the surface of the plaque has a fuzzy white appearance but it will later turn blue-green. Spores borne on these plaques can cause development of secondary sites of infection within the respiratory system. Finding such growths in the coelomic cavity and/or air sac system confirms a diagnosis of clinical aspergillosis. (Courtesy Barbara Barca-Ruibal.)\n\nThe indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay is a useful aid for detecting antibodies to Aspergillus fumigatus. The enzyme-labeled second antibody (conjugate) detects antibodies bound to antigen, which is attached to a solid phase such as the well of a microtiter plate. A commercially available goat antiturkey conjugate adequately recognized immunoglobulins from Buteo species of raptors; however, specific conjugates must be made for use in falcons, accipiters, owls, or psittacines. ( The route of infection is inhalation, rendering the respiratory system the main target organ. Direct deposition of spores in the air on exposed vulnerable surfaces may also occur. Among parrots, and occasionally raptors, the upper respiratory system is often affected (sinuses, larynx, and syrinx). The most serious disease occurs with infection of the lower respiratory system (lungs and air sacs). Spores in the lower respiratory system can migrate widely throughout the coelomic cavity by the ramifying and interconnecting air sac system that reaches into every part of the body. Consequently, lesions may be found in the pericardium, on the kidneys, in the mesenteries, and among the vertebral bodies of the spinal column. Although the respiratory system provides an ideal environment in which the thermophilic, oxyphilic Aspergillus fungus can grow, the organism is an opportunist and may colonize on superficial damaged epithelial and mucosal tissues. Mycotic keratitis and intraocular infections caused by A. fumigatus have been reported, and the author, on several occasions, found A. fumigatus colonizing skin wounds covered by a bandage.\n\nAspergillosis occurs typically as a result of inhalation of the ubiquitously available spores. Multiple infections in a single facility imply common exposure rather than bird-to-bird spread. Infection can be overwhelming and acute, such as when a bird is exposed to a point source of heavy spore contamination, or it can occur as a result of low-level ambient exposure coupled with compromised immune function in the host. Some factors implicated as causal in the development of aspergillosis include: \u2022 Recent capture \u2022 Change of ownership \u2022 Poor ventilation \u2022 Neonatal and geriatric conditions \u2022 Birds subjected to multiple doses of corticosteroids, especially dexamethasone \u2022 Exposure to respiratory irritants such as cigarette smoke or ammonia \u2022 Lead poisoning. However, aspergillosis is also seen to occur, but with much lower frequency, in apparently well-adjusted trained birds for unapparent or undetermined reasons.\n\nAcute, chronic, and localized forms of the disease are recognized. An acute form occurs when a bird is exposed to a large number of spores from a point source. Hundreds of miliary foci of inflammation develop, mostly in the lung. This form is known as \"brooder pneumonia\" when it affects neonatal poultry, and it arises as a result of environmental contamination in the hatcher or brooder. In adult birds, it occurs from exposure to clouds of spores in poorly kept food or bedding, or other environmental sources. Moldy silage, leaf piles, bales of straw or shavings, and eucalyptus bark have been implicated as sources. In one situation, it was felt that the source of the spores was a mown field of alfalfa, adjacent to and downwind of the weathering yard in which a gyr falcon was housed, which had been rained on before it was finally raked and baled. The affected falcon became ill within a few days of the harvesting activity and died acutely with lungs studded with miliary granulomas. Other similar occurrences have been encountered when breeding chambers of falcons were cleaned without the birds being removed from the chamber.\n\nOther forms of aspergillosis are more chronic and include focal lesions in the lungs and air sacs, pericardium, trachea, or syrinx, and occasionally the brain or anterior chamber of the eye. In all chronic forms, host immunosuppression is implicated in the pathogenesis. Localized forms involve granuloma formation in the syrinx or the sinuses.\n\nAspergillosis in gyr falcons is a serious problem for falconers. Historically in falconry, it is well established that the gyr falcon is highly impacted by this disease. With the large-scale production of gyr falcons and gyr hybrids through captive breeding and used in falconry, the number of encounters of birds with this disease have increased markedly in the last two decades. The disease most often becomes apparent at about the time the birds are becoming hard-penned, at approximately 10 weeks of age. Postmortem examination reveals extensive involvement of the air sacs and lungs, suggesting that the process has been ongoing for several weeks. The premise of immunosuppression or exposure to large numbers of spores from a point source does not appear to apply, as affected birds are typically raised in carefully monitored and managed facilities, provided with an abundance of nutritional food, and raised without overt evidence of stress. It is possible that the juvenile gyr falcon is constitutionally unable to defend itself against ambient exposure to Aspergillus spores. Other possibilities may include immunosuppression by exposure to high ambient temperatures occurring in temperate zones (where the majority of propagation occurs) in late July and early August when the greatest number of cases are seen, or exposure to some immunosuppressive, clinically unapparent viral agent. Another possibility is that the captive-raised gyr falcon is affected by unrecognized psychological stresses arising from a mismatch between the normal development it would experience in the wild in an Arctic environment and containment, relocation, or other artifacts of rearing in captivity. Research into these issues is necessary to reduce the incidence of this disease in young gyr falcons.\n\nThe management and diagnosis of aspergillosis is challenging because of the following: \u2022 Variability and subtleness of the signs of the disease at onset \u2022 Advanced state of the disease when clearly recognizable signs become apparent; immunologically suppressed birds may elicit a poor antibody response, rendering antibody-based diagnostic tests less useful \u2022 The role played by immunosuppression in the pathogenesis: the host often puts up little defense and gives little help in the treatment, and in many instances the apparent causes of the immunosuppression appear to be very small and relatively innocuous events, such as a change of management of the bird\n\nThe disease is typically seated in the respiratory system, although lesions may occur in other parts of the body. However, the early clinical signs of the chronic forms do not necessarily, and most often do not, result in expression of respiratory signs. Rather the early signs are subtle, nonspecific, and include:\n\n\u2022 Change in behavior, especially a reduction in overall or expected levels of activity \u2022 Change in voice \u2022 Food flicking or anorexia \u2022 Slight loss of stamina or willingness to chase quarry \u2022 Apparent respiratory signs or weight loss-at this point the disease is extensively developed\n\nThe battery of tools to be used in establishing a diagnosis include:\n\n\u2022 Clinical suspicion (signs, species, sex, time of year, and present and recent circumstances) \u2022 Antibody detection with a high-level sensitivity test such as an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) a or an antigen capture test b \u2022 Tracheal culture and/or washes \u2022 Air sac washes \u2022 Hematology analysis characterized by heterophilic leukocytosis, toxic heterophils, and varying degrees of monocytosis; protein electrophoresis may exhibit a characteristic increase in \u03b2 and \u03b3 globulins strongly associated with aspergillosis or other granulomatous disease \u2022 Endoscopy is the single most useful tool in establishing a diagnosis of aspergillosis in clinically suspected cases \u2022 Radiology is generally of limited value as a diagnostic tool during stages of development at which treatment is a reasonable possibility, but may yield useful information Organisms recovered from swabs or washes are cultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar. Identity can be readily confirmed from wet mounts prepared with lactophenol aniline blue stain or other methylene bluebased stain.\n\nClinical suspicion coupled with positive tracheal culture (taken from deep within the trachea with a nasopharyngeal swab c ) and an elevated white cell count (25,000 to 100,000 cells/mm 3 +) is taken as circumstantial evidence of occurrence of aspergillosis and the basis on which to commence treatment. Endoscopy is invaluable because it allows examination of the trachea and the air sacs for lesions referable to aspergillosis. Whereas well-developed granulomas or lesions sprouting fungal hyphae leave little doubt, in many early cases only vascularized air sacs are seen. These should be regarded as strong evidence of an inflammatory response by the air sacs.\n\nHigh-sensitivity serologic tests specifically for aspergillosis have limited global availability; however, where applied they have been very useful for assessing a patient's status regarding aspergillosis. The indirect ELISA measures the presence of antibody. A positive result indicates active infection, long-term exposure, or an elevated antibody level resulting from a previous infection. A negative result indicates no antibodies, either as a result of lack of disease or the inability to produce the antibodies. At The Raptor Center, University of Minnesota, three categories of response are used:\n\n\u2022 Below cut-off, which implies no detectable antibodies, and is a category in which false-negatives have been encountered only in circumstances where the patient, in addition to having aspergillosis, had another debilitating condition such as tuberculosis or lead poisoning. \u2022 Midrange (gray zone), which implies exposure and low-level antibody production caused by (1) ongoing exposure with no clinical disease, (2) low-level or early stage disease development, or (3) poor immune response to severe disease. \u2022 High-range, which is associated with vigorous immune response and may bode well for recovery. An affected bird often yields a midrange response early in the disease that increases into the high range during the second to fourth week of treatment. Failure to show increasing optical density readings during treatment may imply lack of antibody response and be indicative of a guarded prognosis. ELISA is a good screening test and, when used in conjunction with other parameters, aids the clinician in establishing a diagnosis. Its availability is presently limited and it is species or group specific, depending on immunoprotein recognition by antibodies produced in goats or rabbits. As such, a specific custom-made conjugate-labeled antibody is needed for psittacines, falcons, and accipiters, whereas immunoglobulins of other species of diurnal raptor cross-react well with a commercially available goat or rabbit antiturkey conjugate. A conjugate antibody has not been made for owls, and the other conjugates do not have sufficient cross-reactivity with owl serum to render them effective in antibody detection with this test.\n\nThe need for species-specific conjugates may be circumvented by the development of antigen capture tests, which detect molecular elements of the Aspergillus organism that may be present in the bloodstream. While the extent to which antigen may be present from nondisease-causing exposure compared with active infection is not yet clear, these tests nevertheless represent another potentially valuable means of assessing a patient's status regarding this disease. There is one polymerase chain reaction-based test available in the United States, which is useful when used on aspirates/washes taken from the trachea or air sacs or on serum (Dalhausen R, personal communication).\n\nThe treatment options for aspergillosis are limited. Drugs used have included 5-fluorocytosine (5FC), d itraconazole, e fluconazole, f clotrimazole, g enilconazole, h voriconazole, i terbinafine HCl j , and amphotericin B. k The last two are fungicidal. Amphotericin B is the gold standard against which other antifungal agents are compared in vitro. Amphotericin B, along with 5FC, itraconazole, and clotrimazole, and particularly the last two in combination, is efficacious in treating known cases of aspergillosis; fluconazole appears to be ineffective. Enilconazole and ketoconazole have also been used with a modicum of success by individual clinicians. Itraconazole is the most widely used antifungal agent at present, but work done in 2004 with voriconazole indicates that this recently available compound may have greater clinical utility than other forms of treatment (Di Somma et al., 2004) . This drug was found to be effective in treating clinical cases of aspergillosis in falcons when dosed at 12.5 mg/kg (twice a day for 3 to 5 days in heavily infected birds and then once a day for 3 to 6 weeks depending on severity), although further work has suggested that multiple doses may need to be given to maintain inhibitory concentrations throughout the day (Scope et al., 2005) . Much more research is needed, first to establish a means of assessing the antifungal sensitivity of recovered strains of Aspergillus spp. at the beginning and during courses of clinical treatment, and second to assess the efficacy of different drugs and treatment protocols in a laboratorycontrolled infection model.\n\nA representative treatment regimen for aspergillosis consists of amphotericin B administered intratracheally (1.5 mg/kg in a 1 cc volume of sterile water, twice a day) and intravenously (1 mg/kg given by bolus injections every 8 to 12 hours) for the first 3 to 4 days. Itraconazole is administered at 5 to 15 mg/kg twice a day, orally, for the first 5 days, then once daily thereafter for the duration of treatment, usually 3 to 4 months. Amphotericin B is replaced by nebulized clotrimazole (5% to 10% solution in polyethylene glycol with 5% dimethylsulfoxide [DMSO], obtained from a compounding pharmacy). Nebulization schedules vary widely; however, we typically provide two 1-hour sessions per day separated by a 12-hour interval (Redig, 1996) . Most recently, voriconazole has come to the forefront as a clearly improved agent for treating aspergillosis (Di Somma et al., 2004 , Scope et al., 2005 . Dosed at 12.5 mg/kg by mouth twice a day for 4 days, followed by once daily, the drug is best absorbed with little or no food in the gastrointestinal tract. A liquid form is also available that can be concurrently nebulized. Because of the varying sensitivities of various strains of A. fumigatus to these agents, and uncertainties regarding pharmacokinetics in various species, combination therapies are recommended. Nebulization therapy should be undertaken with the realization that it will deliver material only to those areas of the respiratory system where there is airflow, and that its utility therefore may be limited.\n\nAggressive treatment of severe aspergillosis may be undertaken by a method of endoscopic laser ablation of granulomas and direct installation of antifungal agents into accessible granulomas. Methods for more expansive access to the thoracic cavity and respiratory system for such ablative procedures have been described (Hernandez-Divers, 2002) .\n\nFrom a prognostic and treatment perspective, aspergillosis can be categorized into four levels: \u2022 Class I: A patient in this category may express vague signs of illness such as reduction in appetite, slight weight loss, decreased activity such as not flapping its wings as vigorously as usual when bathing, or loss of stamina. In the absence of endoscopic confirmation, or where endoscopic results are inconclusive, if two other indicators are positive (e.g., elevated white cell count and vague signs of illness, especially in a high incidence species), initiate treatment with a 2-to 3-week course of itraconazole (5 to 10 mg/kg twice daily for 5 days, followed by once daily at the same dose oral) or voriconazole (12.5 mg/kg once or twice daily, oral). Some individual birds may exhibit anorexia and vomiting after a few days at the higher dosages of itraconazole. Monitor white cell picture, tracheal culture, and patient condition. Typically, the prognosis is excellent.\n\n\u2022 Class II: A patient in this category has discrete clinical signs referable to aspergillosis (respiratory difficulty), positive tracheal culture, and endoscopic confirmation of lesions or at least vascularized air sacs. Full-scale treatment should be undertaken as described in Class I. Prognosis is fair to good. \u2022 Class III: In this category the patient presents with severe clinical signs (dyspnea, anorexia, vomiting, and notable weight loss), radiographically visible lesions, endoscopically visible lesions and, often, a low antibody response. In this case aggressive treatment is aided by surgical debulking of masses in air sacs with exploratory surgery. Prognosis is poor in goshawks and red-tailed hawks and guarded in large falcons. \u2022 Class IV: This category is syringeal aspergillosis as detected by endoscopic evaluation of the trachea. In some, but not all, cases the lesion can be removed through an incision in the lower trachea, proximal to the syrinx. An air sac cannula is very helpful for administering anesthesia during such surgery. Following removal, the patient is treated with intratracheal amphotericin B for 5 days and itraconazole or voriconazole by mouth for about 3 weeks. The patient parameters of white cell count and distribution and its antibody status (ELISA) are monitored. If there is no further involvement of the respiratory system, the prognosis is excellent. Depending on the site of the lesions and the severity of the disease, there are many aspects to treatment. The total treatment program typically extends over 3 months, but if recovery is likely, an initial favorable response to treatment is seen within 7 to 10 days.\n\nClearly aspergillosis is to be prevented. Protection from exposure to aerosols that may contain spores is paramount. Prophylactic treatment with 5FC or itraconazole/voriconazole is recommended for newly captured or newly admitted birds of species that have an established track record of susceptibility, especially gyr falcons. The recommended protocol is to administer an antifungal (itraconazole or voriconazole) for 3 weeks. Gyr falcons will tolerate itraconazole only up to a dose of 8 mg/kg. The course of treatment may be extended if clinical indications warrant. This approach also should extend to individuals of highly susceptible species that are undergoing a change of management (e.g., transfer to new owner or new enclosure), regardless of age or other circumstance. Treatment for 1 week before the move and 2 weeks after is recommended. Domestically reared gyr falcons and gyr hybrids should be provided with this prophylactic regimen from a period beginning at 45 days of age through 75 to 90 days of age. If extreme heat conditions prevail during the months of August and September in any given locale, young gyr falcons should be provided with extended prophylactic treatment during this time. The tendency for these prophylactic regimens to induce drug-resistant strains of Aspergillus is unknown.\n\nAspergillosis is the most challenging medical problem affecting avian species. There are many tools available for diagnosis and treatment but no formulaic protocols that will guarantee success. Each case must be evaluated on its own merits and it is up to the clinician to select the proper tools and apply them effectively to achieve success. Prevention and prophylaxis are vital. \n\nCandidiasis (Figs. 14-75 to 14-77) is one of the most common fungal diseases in birds. It is usually confined to the upper alimentary tract but can also invade the nasal cavity and sinuses. This disease is caused by fungi of the genus Candida. Candida albicans is the most common pathogenic species isolated from clinical specimens. However, C. krusei and C. tropicalis also have been reported from clinical cases. Candidiasis has been reported in several avian species including falcons, pigeons, parrots, pheasants, chickens, and turkeys. This disease is usually associated with malnutrition, inhibition of normal bacterial flora caused by prolonged use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, and poor husbandry, but mainly by repeated over-retention of food in the crop for a period of time (Samour and Naldo, 2002) .\n\nClinical signs are nonspecific and varied. Infected fowl chicks show inadequate and retarded growth, are apathetic, and their feathers are ruffled. In young turkeys, the symptoms include listlessness and diminished appetite, but especially noticeable is the way in which the head drops backward between the shoulder blades and the sunken breast. The eyes sink deep into their sockets and the head of the bird has a disheveled appearance. Candida spp. infection in birds is usually manifested by the presence of lesions in the oropharynx and crop, characterized by white circular ulcers with raised surface scabs causing thickening of the mucosa. In most cases, pseudomembrane and inflammatory changes, such as exfoliation of epithelial cells, are common. In certain chronic cases, beak rot, tongue rot, and enteritis are also observed. If the infection invades the intestinal mucosa, a malabsorption syndrome may develop. Affected falcons commonly showed amorphous diphtheritic membranes, from white-gray to gray-green in color, affecting the crop. On endoscopic examination the mucosal membrane of affected areas has a typical \"Turkish towel\" appearance ( Fig. 14-78) . On external examination, through palpation, the affected areas appear thicker to the touch (Samour and Naldo, 2002) . Clinical signs include reduced appetite, anorexia, regurgitation, shredding and flicking of the food, and subsequent progressive weight loss.\n\nDirect phase-contrast microscopic examination of sample suspension in normal saline is a quick and easy method of detecting the presence mouth every 12 hours for 7 to 21 days (Bauck, 1994; Boydell and Forbes, 1996) , and fluconazole 2 to 5 mg/kg by mouth every 24 hours for 7 days (Bauck, 1994; Oglesbee, 1997) . The latter is postulated as the most effective antifungal agent for the treatment of tissue-based yeast infections in birds (Flammer, 1993) . Nystatin suspension, 2 to 5 mL (100,000 IU/mL)/kg (weight of the bird) has also been used, applied directly to the mucosal membranes of the mouth of raptors (P.T. Redig, personal communication) . The use of a miconazole gel preparation (Daktarin oral gel, Janssen-Cilag Ltd., UK) was successfully used in the treatment of upper digestive tract candidiasis infections in falcons (Samour and Naldo, 2002) . This pharmacologic miconazole presentation may prove useful for similar infections in other avian species.\n\nof Candida spp. The sample can also be examined by direct light microscopy with the help of lactophenol aniline blue stain. C. albicans is an oval, budding yeast that produces pseudohyphae, both in tissue and exudates and in broth culture. Eosin and methylene blue stain (Neat stain and Rapi-Diff) is also used for the detection of exfoliated epithelial cells and Candida spp. in the smear. In Gram-stained smears, Candida spp. appear as a gram-positive, oval budding yeast measuring 2 to 3 \u00d7 4 to 6 \u00b5m, and elongated budding cells resembling hyphae called pseudohyphae. Culture or serologic studies are necessary for the species identification. Culture studies are the most widely used diagnostic method for detecting Candida spp. These fungi grow well in yeast mold agar (Oxoid, UK) after 48 to 72 hours of incubation at 37\u00b0 C (98.6\u00b0 F). Media used for the primary isolation and identification of Candida spp. include Candida BCG agar, corn meal peptone yeast agar, and Sabouraud agar; corn meal agar, LIU Newton agar, rice infusionoxgall-Tween 80 agar, and rice-Tween agar are used to detect the production of chlamydospores of C. albicans. BiGGY agar (Nickerson Medium) is used for the selective isolation, differentiation and presumptive identification of C. albicans and C. tropicalis.\n\nThe identification of Candida spp. is based on morphologic appearance by microscopic examination, cultural characteristics on primary and selective media, and biochemical reactions, which include assimilation and fermentation of carbohydrates. Vitek 2 YST ID card, MUAG Candi test, and Flow Uni-Yeast-Tek wheel are commercially available kits used for the identification of yeast from clinical specimens by assimilation and fermentation reactions. Germ tube test is used for the detection of pseudohyphae production of C. albicans. Serologic testing by agglutination reaction with specific antisera is also used for the diagnosis of Candida spp.\n\nThe treatment for candidiasis in the upper digestive tract of birds includes the use of nystatin 200,000 to 300 000 U/kg by mouth every 12 hours for 7 to 10 days (Bauck, 1994; Boydell and Forbes, 1996; Oglesbee, 1997; Redig and Ackermann, 2000) , ketoconazole 10 to 30 mg/kg by mouth every 12 hours for 7 days (Bauck, 1994; Boydell and Forbes, 1996; Oglesbee, 1997) , itraconazole 5 to 10 mg/kg by \n\nMacrorhabdus ornithogaster is an anamorphic ascomycetes yeast that has only been found to grow at the junction of the proventriculus and ventriculus in birds (Tomaszewski et al., 2003) . It was first recognized in the early 1980s in the United States in budgerigars and was thought to be a yeast (Hargreaves, 1981) . Concurrent investigations in the Netherlands described it in canaries and incorrectly concluded it was a bacterium, giving it the name Megabacterium, which continues to be used improperly (van Herck et al., 1984) . A subsequent study claimed to be able to isolate the organism from budgerigar stomachs using traditional bacterial isolation methods; however, they did not characterize their isolate sufficiently and subsequently it was shown that the isolate that was described in this study was a bacterium and not M. ornithogaster (Phalen, 2013) .\n\nThe true nature of M. ornithogaster was only recently conclusively demonstrated. Studies in Australia demonstrated that it was not sensitive to antibiotics, but it was sensitive to amphotericin, suggesting that it was in fact a fungus (Filippich and Perry, 1993) . It was shown to stain for chitin, a protein that is only produced by eukaryote organisms, proving that it was not a bacterium. Investigators were then able to purify the organism and sequence portions of the DNA that code for ribosomal RNA. Comparing this sequence to other known yeast it was then shown that M. ornithogaster was not only a novel species of yeast, but in fact was the only known representative of an entirely new genus of yeasts (Tomaszewski et al., 2003) .\n\nM. ornithogaster can infect many species of birds (Phalen, 2013). There is convincing evidence that it can cause disease in its host, but it is also clear that many birds live with this organism without obvious signs. The only effective treatments for M. ornithogaster are a few antifungal drugs, and these drugs do not always lend themselves to large-scale flock treatment. Because M. ornithogaster was thought to be a bacterium (Megabacteria) for more than 20 years many assumptions about this organism's biology have subsequently proven to be untrue. Continued referencing of some of these flawed studies and anecdotal reports often creates confusion for veterinarians and bird owners alike (Phalen, 2013).\n\nThe reported host range of M. ornithogaster includes a wide range of psittacine birds, passerine birds, poultry, and other species. It has a worldwide distribution and is found in both wild and captive birds (Martins et al., 2006; Phalen, 2013) .\n\nThe species of psittacine birds most commonly infected with M. ornithogaster are budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus), lovebirds (Agapornis sp.), and to lesser extent cockatiels (Nymphicus hollandicus). Infection has also been reported to be common in parrotlets (Forpus sp.). In wild Australian birds, the organism is commonly found in recently fledged galahs (Eolophus roseicapilla) and corellas (Cacatua sp.) with chronic diarrheal disease and weight loss. These birds have other intestinal parasites and at least some have concurrent infections with the psittacine beak and feather disease virus. The full host range of M. ornithogaster in psittacine birds is unknown and infection should be considered in any species of psittacine bird presenting with gastrointestinal signs (Phalen, 2013) .\n\nPasserine species infected with M. ornithogaster include pet canaries (Serinus canaria), zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata), and Gouldian finches (Erythrura gouldiae). It has also been found in a range of wild European finches and the siskin (Carduelis spinus), and in feral European goldfinches (C. carduelis) and wild caught feral European goldfinches and green finches (C. chloris) captured for the pet trade in Australia (Phalen, 2013).\n\nM. ornithogaster infections have now been reported in chickens (Gallus gallus) in Europe, North and South America, and Australia. Other gallinaceous birds reported to be infected with M. ornithogaster include the gray partridge (Perdix perdix), the Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica), domestic turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), chukar partridge (Alectoris chukar), and guinea fowl (genus and species not reported). Infection has also been reported in ducks, geese, and ibises, although no supporting evidence on how the diagnosis was made in ibises was provided. Recently M. ornithogaster has been reported in captive raised greater rheas (Rhea americana). Morphologically, these organisms are consistent with those that have been reported in other species; however, they still remain to be characterized by molecular techniques (Martins et al., 2006; Phalen, 2013) .\n\nThere are two reports of an organism resembling M. ornithogaster infecting the upper respiratory tract of a dog and a cat. These organisms were never described, and because M. ornithogaster is microaerophilic, its growth on respiratory epithelium does not seem plausible. Recent infection attempts in mice provide additional evidence that M. ornithogaster cannot grow in mammals (Hanafusa et al., 2013) .\n\nIsolation attempts from stomach contents of greater rheas using growth conditions inconsistent with the metabolic requirements of M. ornithogaster have resulted in the isolation of a small motile organism, which the investigators suggest is M. ornithogaster. This uncharacterized organism has been shown to colonize the stomach of mice. Because this organism grows in conditions incompatible for M. ornithogaster growth, because it has morphologic characteristics never seen in M. ornithogaster either in vivo or in vitro, and because it has never been characterized genetically, it is the author's opinion that identifying this organism as M. ornithogaster is premature and is likely to be incorrect (Hanafusa et al., 2007) .\n\nThe signs of M. ornithogaster in birds include vomiting, regurgitation, diarrhea, and chronic weight loss (Fig. 14-79 ). It has been seen in young and adult birds. Disease in budgerigars is most common in middle-aged birds. An acute hemorrhagic disease has been reported in parrotlets. Weight loss, anorexia, melena, and anemia are commonly seen in cockatiels and occasionally in other species that have gastric ulceration secondary to M. ornithogaster infection. Canaries and other finches with M. ornithogaster infections are often found dead with no premonitory signs, but are generally emaciated, suggesting that they had been ill for at least a few days before death (Phalen, 2013).\n\nDetection of M. ornithogaster infection in the live bird is most often done by microscopic examination of the feces. Feces made into a slurry with water or saline can be scanned for M. ornithogaster using 40\u00d7 magnification. Alternately, fecal smears can be stained with a quick stain or Gram stain. A rapid way of concentrating M. ornithogaster and separating it from other solid matter in the feces is to homogenize a dropping with approximately 20 times its volume of physiologic saline in a small tube, let it sit for 10 seconds, and then examine a small drop of the suspension collected from the meniscus. Because M. ornithogaster take longer to settle than most other material in the feces, it is more easily seen in wet preparations after this treatment (Phalen, 2013) . A PCR assay to detect M. ornithogaster in the feces is also available in North America (Veterinary Molecular Diagnostics, Milford, OH).\n\nM. ornithogaster are long, slender, straight stiff rods with rounded ends when found in feces (Figs. 14-80 and 14-81). In some circumstances the long rods may bend slightly in a gentle curve. Y-shaped organisms can be seen (see Fig. 14-81 ), but these are extremely rare. Viewed directly in a wet mount, small oblong refractile structures (nuclei) found at regular intervals are readily seen. The nuclei stain with Giemsa. M. ornithogaster range in length from 20 to 80 \u00b5m and are consistently 2 to 3 \u00b5m across. They often stain poorly with quick and Gram stains and instead of staining uniformly they only pick up small droplets of the stain. When they do stain well, they are gram positive and stain dark blue with quick stains (Fig. 14-82) . Unlike bacteria and other yeasts, the contents of the cell stain but not the cell wall. It is the author's impression that they do not stick well to glass slides unless the slide has been heat fixed. It is also the author's impression that heat fixing makes them more likely to stain uniformly.\n\nBirds infected with M. ornithogaster may shed the organism in low numbers, in large numbers, or not at all. It has been the author's experience that the majority of birds exhibiting disease as the result of M. ornithogaster infection shed large numbers of organisms. However, this may not always be the case, and the absence of M. ornithogaster in the feces does not completely rule out infection (Phalen, 2013). There can be other things in the feces that resemble M. ornithogaster (Fig. 14-83 ). An unknown structure commonly seen by the author in the droppings of many birds is approximately the size of Macrorhabdus, but has a straight and not rounded terminal end that appears to be the result of the structure breaking off of something larger. M. ornithogaster always has rounded ends. Filamentous gram-positive bacteria can also approach the size of M. ornithogaster. These bacteria, however, are often segmented, are thinner than M. ornithogaster, and generally curve back and forth and thus are readily distinguished from M. ornithogaster.\n\nA saline preparation of a scraping of junction (isthmus) of the proventriculus and the ventriculus demonstrates the organisms, which are generally abundant. M. ornithogaster is also readily demonstrated in H&E stained sections of the isthmus. They are eosinophilic and are found forming the characteristic log-jam patterns on the surface of and between the mucosal glands . Because they are a fungus, they stain with silver stains and the periodic acid-Schiff stain (Tomaszewski et al., 2003) .\n\nShowing that the M. ornithogaster infection contributed to the cause of the bird's death, however, requires more proof than just finding the organism. Budgerigars and passerines with disease caused by M. ornithogaster will grossly have a thickened mucosa of the proventriculus and there will be increased mucus in the lumen. Some birds may have one or more bleeding ulcers of the proventriculus. In birds with clinical signs caused by M. ornithogaster infection, growth extends beyond the isthmus into the proventriculus and the koilin of ventriculus and may disrupt the structure of the koilin. A lymphoplasmacytic inflammation is common in birds with heavy M. ornithogaster growth, but is less likely in birds with minimal superficial colonization of the organism (Phalen, 2013).\n\nM. ornithogaster is readily grown in vitro given the correct substrate and conditions. It must be provided with a microaerophilic environment and grown in a medium with a pH between 3 and 4. Traditional cell culture media containing up to 20% fetal bovine serum and 1% to 5% glucose or sucrose have been shown to support its growth. Its optimal growth temperature is 42\u00b0 C. Addition of antibiotics to the growth media is recommended to prevent the overgrowth of bacteria. It can be cultured from isthmus scrapings or from feces (Hanafusa et al., 2007) .\n\nThere are few treatment trials that have been done in birds with M. ornithogaster infection (Phalen, 2013) . In many of these trials, the measure of successful treatment was the cessation of M. ornithogaster shedding in the feces, as opposed to the less common trial where treated birds were killed and the stomach examined directly (Filippich and Perry, 1993; Kheirandish and Salehi, 2011; Phalen, 2013) . While it is likely that the cessation of shedding may be the result of a cure, it is also possible that some of these treated birds may have remained infected at low levels. Amphotericin B is used widely to treat M. ornithogaster and appears to be effective and safe when administered orally by gavage and in some circumstances in water. Various doses have been recommended. The author has used 100 mg/kg twice a day for 14 days with direct oral administration, but has been gradually reducing the amount and is now using 25 mg/kg twice a day for 14 days with apparent success. Success of treatment has been judged by the rapid cessation of M. ornithogaster shedding and resolution of signs. Amphotericin B can be purchased as a powder (Gallipot, St. Paul, MN) and compounded into a formula that can be given orally. The 2.5% water-soluble powder from Vetafarm (Wagga Wagga, New South Wales, Australia) that has been used extensively in the past is no longer available. There is one report of M. ornithogaster resistant to amphotericin B. How widespread the resistance may be is not known (Phalen, 2013) .\n\nThe ability of nystatin to kill M. ornithogaster may vary from strain to strain. In vitro trials by Bradley et al. (2005) , showed that M. ornithogaster was sensitive to nystatin at concentrations of 0.1 U/mL. In one clinical trial the authors also saw a cessation of M. ornithogaster shedding after treatment with nystatin. In a recent study a flock of budgerigars was treated with nystatin at 3,500,000 IU/L of drinking water for 2 days then 2,000,000 IU/L for 28 days (Kheirandish and Salehi, 2011) . Some birds in this study were euthanized after the end of treatment and were found free of infection. Resistance to nystatin by some strains of M. ornithogaster is likely based on clinical trials done by others.\n\nResearch done by Bradley et al. (2005) showed that cultured M. ornithogaster in vitro are highly sensitive to sodium and potassium benzoate and sodium sorbate. Treatment attempts with trials of sodium benzoate in drinking water in live birds have been performed by the author and others. The author's experiences have not been uniformly successful, and in many cases, shedding and clinical signs have not resolved (Phalen, 2013) . The reason for the failure of treatment in these instances is not known, but adequate consumption of the treated water may be to blame. In another trial where a flock of breeding budgerigars was treated, M. ornithogaster shedding stopped but some of the treated birds died. The cause of the deaths was not determined but could have been the result of sodium toxicity. Water consumption in the treated budgerigars was very high because they were feeding young and it was the middle of the summer and daytime temperatures were very high (Phalen, 2013). Trials of potassium benzoate have not been performed, but it may be safer than sodium benzoate because it is more difficult to get potassium toxicity from ingested potassium than it is to get sodium toxicity from ingested sodium. The use of any of these chemicals requires additional research before they can be recommended for routine use. There are many potential sources of sodium and potassium benzoate. The product used by the author is purchased as a 99% pure product (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).\n\nFluconazole has been used to effectively treat M. ornithogaster in experimentally infected chickens at a dosage of 100 mg/kg. In trials in budgerigars, this dosage was found to be toxic and a lower dosage was not effective. Gentian violet was found to prevent M. ornithogaster growth in vitro. Gentian violet at moderate concentrations, however, was found to be toxic to budgerigars (D. Phalen, unpublished information).\n\nM. ornithogaster is found in many species of birds around the world. It can be a significant cause of both morbidity and mortality. Detecting the infection in the live bird requires the direct observation of the organism in the feces or its detection by PCR; however, these assays are not sufficiently sensitive that a negative result rules out infection. Diagnosis is readily made at postmortem by examination of scrapings of the isthmus and histopathology of the proventriculus \n\nFavus or ringworm infection is a dermatophytosis seldom reported in birds (Figs. 14-82 to 14-87). The infection is caused by invasion of the keratinized layers of the skin and appendages by dermatophytes or ringworm fungi (Keymer, 1982) . Pathogenic dermatophytes appear to have a worldwide distribution.\n\nThe infection occurs occasionally in free-living passerines, and is reported mostly in the UK (Blackmore and Keymer, 1969) . In captivity, the disease is relatively uncommon. It is mostly seen in Psittaciformes, Columbiformes, and Passeriformes. Other orders of birds in which the infection has been recorded include Struthioniformes, Anseriformes, Falconiformes, and Galliformes. \n\nAccording to Perry (1987) there are more than 20 species of pathogenic dermatophytic fungi. The most commonly isolated microorganism is Microsporum gallinae; however, M. gypseum and Trichophyton simii and T. megninii have also been recorded (Baron and Doneley, 2014 \n\nMost commonly affected are the unfeathered areas of the skin of the head and, when present, also the comb and wattles. Less frequently, lesions affect other parts of the body such as the neck, the legs, and the leading edge of the wings. However, Baker (1996) recorded unilateral feather loss of the body caused by a Trichophyton sp. in a budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulatus). In most cases partial or complete alopecia is present and the skin becomes thickened and corrugated, grayish white or yellowish in color, and sometimes with the formation of encrustations and scabs. Crusty exudates may occur around the feather follicles. Sometimes the skin lesions are rough and porous in appearance. Usually there is little evidence of pruritus. Tudor (1983) isolated a Paecilomyces sp. and Mucor circinelloides from the feather shafts of pigeons (Columba livia) and various psittacines, which he regarded as the cause of pruritus and feather pulling. Some mycotic infections were associated with bacteria. In a recent report, a 16-month-old black Orpington hen (Gallus gallus domesticus) was taken to a veterinarian with clinical signs of intense pruritus and progressively worse feather loss for a month. At examination, the head showed considerable feather loss and white crusting on the unfeathered areas of the skin including typical scutula around the base of the feather follicles. These are saucer-like crustings that are characteristic of favus infections. The aural cavity was inflamed and contained a large amount of caseous exudates. The rest of the body, including the neck, underneath the wings, and on the legs, also showed considerable feather loss. Histopathology of biopsies obtained from the head and neck revealed follicles with multifocal suppurative folliculitis with intralesional fungal organisms, follicular keratosis, multifocal epithelial cell degeneration, and severe chronic lymphoplasmacytic and histiocytic perifolliculitis. On PAS staining, multifocal aggregates of variable-sized, pink-stained round conidia 0.5 to 1 um in diameter were observed. Based on the morphologic characteristics, the fungal bodies observed in the sample were most likely Microsporum sp. The hen was treated with grisovin 125 mg once a day for a period of 3 months, making significant improvement (Baron and Doneley, 2014) . Hine et al. (1990) recorded candidiasis of the uropygial gland of chinstrap penguins (Pygoscelis antarctica). Forbes (personal communication, 1997) also encountered Malassezia sp. (a yeast-like fungus) associated with feather loss and greasy skin in Harris's hawks (Parabuteo unicinctus) and found Candida and Aspergillus spp. to be relatively common secondary infective agents in chronic bumblefoot, especially when the foot remains bandaged for long periods with infrequent dressing changes. Sartory (1942) recorded Aspergillus fumigatoides var. roseus n. sp. as pathogenic to the feathers of pigeons (C. livia). Krautwald-Junghanns (1990) described favus in parrots (Amazona spp.) associated with Aspergillus spp., namely A. fumigatus and A. niger. She also described pruritus caused by Mucor spp. in African grey parrots (Psittacus erithacus), small parakeets, and other species. She said that in these infections the fungi may spread to the respiratory system and cause death. According to Perry (1987) Helminthosporium spp. infection of the skin and feathers in psittacines can cause extensive feather loss.\n\nLesions are usually superficial and confined to the epidermis, dermis, and base of the feathers. Hyperkeratosis is associated with infiltration of the keratinized layers of the skin and feather follicles by fungal hyphae; acanthosis, acantholysis, and hydropic degeneration of cells in the stratum spinosum may also occur with infiltration of the underlying dermis by mononuclear cells (Droual et al., 1991) .\n\nThe disease can be suspected from the macroscopic appearance of the lesions. The presence of septate hyphae on microscopic examination of skin scrapings, softened and cleared by crushing and soaking in aqueous potassium hydroxide (10% to 20% KOH w/v) for about 30 minutes, confirms the diagnosis when associated with histopathological lesions. Frequently, the fungi prove difficult to isolate and identify, even when using special culture media. Some species of normally saprophytic fungi may be found in association with the lesions, making it difficult to determine their significance. It is believed that sometimes mycotic infections may be secondary to immunosuppressive disorders. Perry (1994) stated that dermatophytes of birds do not fluoresce under ultraviolet light.\n\nThe disease is most likely to be confused with skin lesions caused by epidermoptic, cnemidocoptic, or Neocheyletiella mites. Malnutrition, especially hypovitaminosis A, affecting the health of the skin, may be a predisposing cause in some cases. Perry (1987) described \"pseudofavus\" as a nonspecific disorder of unknown etiology affecting birds in late summer and early autumn. It closely resembles favus but microscopic examination reveals no evidence of fungal involvement. Parasites\n\nA good standard of hygiene and avoidance of malnutrition are essential prophylactic measures. Tudor (1983) recommended STA (salicylic acid 3 g, tannic acid 3 g, and ethyl alcohol qs 100 mL) or copper sulfate (1 : 2000 dilution) applied to affected areas of the skin as safe and effective for fungal infections. However, since then, several other fungicidal agents have been developed. For example, Broadbent (1994) reported the successful treatment of T. mentagrophytes infection of an ostrich (Struthio camelus) using three treatments with natamycin (Mycophyt, Mycofarm) at 4-day intervals followed by \"three soakings\" with an enilconazole emulsion (Imaverol, Janssen Pharmaceuticals) at 3-day intervals. The natamycin only reduced the scabbing, but subsequent use of enilconazole produced total resolution. Forbes (personal communication, 1997) described treatment of cutaneous aspergillosis in a goshawk (Accipiter gentilis; Fig. 14-11) . Hine et al. (1990) satisfactorily treated candidiasis of the uropygial gland of penguins by feeding them fish containing itraconazole (Sporanox, Janssen Pharmaceuticals) at a dosage rate of 10 mg/kg/day for 20 days. For the treatment of favus caused by M. gallinae, Bradley et al. (1995) recommended miconazole nitrate 2% (Micatin, Advanced Care Products). It should be remembered that oil/ lipid-based products for topical application are contraindicated in birds because they mat the plumage and lead to excessive preening.\n\nThe author would like to acknowledge the contribution of Dr. Ian Keymer to this section in the previous edition of this book; I would like to profusely thank Robert Doneley for his unstinting assistance with the preparation of this section.\n\nParasites are living creatures that live permanently or temporarily in or on other living organisms (hosts) for the purpose of nutrition, development, and reproduction. In addition, they also benefit from transportation (phoresy) and distribution. In contrast to commensalists, mutualists, and symbionts, the parasite harms its host. Parasites are a heterogenic group of organisms consisting of protozoans, helminths, and arthropods. Depending on their location parasites can be divided into ectoparasites, living on the surface of the host (on the skin and in feathers) and endoparasites, living in the host's organs, blood, or tissues. Most avian arthropods are ectoparasites whereas protozoans and helminths are endoparasites. Temporary parasites have only short contact with the host, mainly for feeding (mosquitoes, fleas, and ticks), and steady parasites spend their whole life or a considerable span of the life cycle on or in the host (protozoa, helminths, and lice). A division between periodic and permanent parasites is useful for ectoparasites. The life cycle of parasite species may include free-living stages. These species are called periodic parasites (fleas, mosquitoes, chigger mites, and myiasis flies). Contrary to this, species where all stages have a parasitic lifestyle are called permanent parasites (ticks, most of the mites, lice, and bugs). Host-specific parasites can be grouped into stenoxenous (with a narrow host range: Eimeria spp., lice, feather mites, louse flies) and euryxenous species (with a broad host spectrum: Isospora lacacei, bed bugs). Life cycles can be simple, including only one host (homoxenous parasites) or complex by involving one or more intermediate hosts before reaching the definitive host, where maturation and sexual development occurs (heteroxenous parasites). Usually parasites are considered as pests, but parasites with complex life-cycles are sensitive to environmental changes and can therefore be indicators for the integrity of habitats.\n\nProtozoans are eukaryotic single-cell organisms possessing a real cell nucleus. Parasitic protozoa of major importance for birds are united into three classes: Trichomonadea (Trichomonas and Histomonas), Coccidea (Eimeria, Caryospora, Isospora, Sarcocystis, and Toxoplasma), and Haematozoa (Haemoproteus, Leucocytozoon, and Plasmodium).\n\nTrichomonas gallinae is a parasitic flagellate that inhabits the upper digestive and respiratory tracts primarily of columbiform and psittaciform birds, raptors, and captive bustards and causes canker or roup (in pigeons) and frounce (in raptors). The parasite is pear-shaped to round and measures 10 to 20 \u00b5m. It has four anterior flagella and an axostyle (recurrent flagellum)-directed posterior. The undulating membrane does not reach the posterior end of the trophozoite. T. gallinae causes clinical illness mainly in young birds, while adult birds may be latently infected without showing clinical symptoms. The life cycle of T. gallinae is direct from one host to the next without resistant cyst stages. Pigeon nestlings become infected via feeding on \"pigeon milk\" produced in the crop of the adults and raptors become infected when feeding on infected prey. T. gallinae can reach other birds (turkeys, chickens and passerines) via contaminated drinking water when infected pigeons and other wild birds have access to the same water source. The parasites enter the water from the mouth of the infected host.\n\nClosely related Tetratrichomonas gallinarum, Tritrichomonas eberthi, and Chilomastix gallinarum are dwellers of the ceca of chickens, turkeys, and related birds. Tetratrichomonas anatis, T. anseris, and Cochlosoma anatis inhabit the caeca of water fowl. These flagellates are considered apathogenic and have a worldwide distribution. Other intestinal flagellates are Spironucleus columbae in pigeons, S. meleagridis in turkeys and chickens.Histomonas meleagridis is the pathogen that causes the infectious typhlohepatitis or blackhead disease in galliform birds (mainly turkeys, but also pheasants, partridges, and chickens). The morphology of the parasite depends on the location and the stage of the disease. It is round or amoeboid with clear ectoplasm and granular endoplasm from 4 to 30 \u00b5m. A single flagellum may be present when trophozoites are in the cecal lumen. Parasites in lesions of the cecal wall or in mucosal tissue of the liver lack flagellum. Shed with feces of infected birds, trophozoites of H. meleagridis do not survive because the parasite does not form cysts. Heterakis gallinarum, a cecal nematode of galliform birds, plays a role in the transmission of H. meleagridis.\n\nTogether with the haematozoans (Haemosporida and Piroplasmida) coccideans belong to the phylum Apicomplexa-a large group of obligate, intracellular parasitic protists that possess a unique organelle, called an apicoplast, and an apical complex involved in penetrating a host cell.\n\nBirds are hosts of three Coccidea families: Eimeriidae, Cryptosporidiidae, and Sarcocystidae. Representatives of the genera Eimeria, Isospora, Tyzzeria, and Caryospora are typical pathogens belonging to the family Eimeriidae. They are host-specific parasites of epithelial cells, mainly of the intestine. The life cycle of Eimeria, Isospora, and Tyzzeria is direct and does not require intermediate hosts but is characterized by an alteration of asexual and sexual multiplying generations. In life cycles of Caryospora species intermediate hosts may be involved. Caryospora sporozoites invade host tissues but stay dormant. In a database on avian Eimeriidae compiled by Duszynski et al. (1998) , 224 Eimeria and 401 Isospora species were mentioned. Most of the Eimeria species (n = 68) were described in galliform birds, while passeriform birds had the greatest variety of Isospora species (n = 347). The same source listed 21 avian Caryospora species; most of them were described in birds of prey and owls. Of the 11 known species of the genus Tyzzeria, six occur in birds. The status of two Wenyonella species described in ducks in India is uncertain. Despite the large number of above mentioned pathogens coccideans in free-ranging birds usually are not of clinical importance. The main morphologic differences in oocysts between the above mentioned genera can be seen after sporulation: 1. Eimeria: Four sporocysts with two sporozoites in each (quadrosporocystic, diplosporozoit) 2. Isospora: Two sporocysts with four sporozoites in each (diplosporocystic, tetrasporozoic) 3. Caryospora: One sporocyst with eight sporozoites (monosporocystic, octosporozoit) 4. Tyzzeria: No sporocyst, eight sporozoites in oocyst (asporocystic, octosporozoit) 5. Wenyonella: Four sporocysts with four sporozoites in each (quadrosporocystic, quadrosporozoit) According to Yabsley (2008) , 197 known avian Eimeria species parasitize 162 avian hosts. Most of the known species occur in galliform followed by anseriform, charadriiform, and gruiform birds. Ten bird orders do not contain any Eimeria host. The homoxenous life cycle of Eimeria coccidia has been intensively studied in species infecting commercial poultry and consists of endogenous schizogony followed by gamogony (Fig. 14-88 ) and exogenous sporulation resulting in the formation of sporulated oocysts (Fig. 14-89) . Most of the avian coccideans complete their life cycle in the alimentary tract and only a few cases of an extra intestinal location of development stages are known (Table 14 -15).\n\nIsospora species occur in a number of free-living songbirds; in cage birds, especially in estrildid finches (zebra finches, strawberry finches, and red-cheeked cordon bleu finch); and in canaries. Compared with the genus Eimeria, avian Isospora species are less host specific. Thus I. lacacei has been described in more than 100 passerine birds and intrafamiliar host specificity is suggested for the Isospora genus. Most of the descriptions of avian Isospora species were based on the morphology of their oocysts and because oocysts were excreted with host feces, it was assumed that these species have strictly intestinal cycles similar to those of Eimeria spp. Extraintestinal development stages found in macrophages in canaries and in the viscera of sparrows with concurrent Isospora infection were allocated to new genera, Atoxoplasma and Lankesterella, respectively. However, it was shown experimentally that these parasites could not be transmitted by blood transfusion but only by ingestion of Isospora oocysts. Using the example of canary Isospora, it was shown experimentally that the development of some species (I. canaria) is restricted to the intestinal epithelium, while sporozoites of others (I. serini) penetrate into macrophages within the intestinal mucosa and are transported to various organs where further multiplication takes place. Because the above mentioned extraintestinal forms were developmental stages of Isospora and did not belong to other parasites, the recognition of Atoxoplasma and Lankesterella could no longer be justified and they are now treated as junior synonyms. Thus independent of the course of the life cycle all coccideans with diplosporocystic, tetrasporozoite oocysts and a single polar Stieda body were assigned to the genus Isospora (Fig. 14-90) . Coccidia of the genus Caryospora are phylogenetically old parasites with most of the species occurring in reptiles. Among the 15 Caryospora species identified in raptors and owls, six are found exclusively in the Falconidae family (Table 14-16). Their oocysts are large and spherical to ovoid without a micropyle. Their sporocysts lack Stieda bodies and enclose eight stubby sporozoites and a residuum (Fig.  14-91) . Caryospora species have a facultative diheteroxenic (predatorprey) life cycle where facultative intermediate hosts (mainly rodents) become infected by ingesting sporulated oocysts. It is assumed that sporozoites invade extraintestinal tissues of the intermediate host, stay dormant as hypnozoites, and do not undergo multiplication. Feeding experiments using C. kutzeri revealed a slightly shorter prepatent period compared with direct transmission. Along with raptors and owls, Caryospora species were detected in gulls (C. argentati and C. undata), in the European robin (C. jiroveci), and in the Cuban blackbird (C. gloriae). Another undescribed species was recently found in farmed African houbara bustards (R. K. Schuster, unpublished information).\n\nCryptosporidiidae are small intracellular but extraplasmatic euryxenous parasites that were recently recognized as significant pathogens of humans and of a large number of other vertebrate hosts. Three avian species, Cryptosporidium baileyi, C. meleagridis, and C. galli (Table  14 -17) are recognized and at least 10 other avian genotypes of other Cryptosporidium species have been identified in more than 30 bird species. C. baileyi is the most frequent avian species but C. meleagridis is able to infect humans, as well as causing up to 10% of cases of human cryptosporidiosis. Two other species, C. anserinum from geese and C. tyzzeri, were not adequately described and are considered nomina nuda. Avian cryptosporidiosis manifests in respiratory disease, enteritis, and renal disease. The route of infection is orally with a life cycle similar to Eimeriidae including merogony followed by gamogony. A certain proportion of the oocysts is not excreted and causes autoinfections. C. baileyi can enter the host when oocysts are placed on the conjunctiva. Cryptosporidium oocysts are small and contain four naked sporozoites. They can be diagnosed in carbol fuchsin-stained fecal smears or mucosal scrapings from respiratory organs (Fig. 14-92 ). Molecular tools are used to confirm the exact species affiliation.\n\nThe coccidia of the genera Sarcocystis and Frenkelia belong to the class Sporozoea (subclass: Coccidia). These protozoan parasites live in the mucosal layers of the intestine, where they sexually reproduce resulting in diplosporocystic tetrasporozoic oocysts. Oocysts occur in feces sporulated and are surrounded by a thin wall that often ruptures releasing sporocysts (Fig. 14-93 \n\nWith more than 2500 genera in more than 140 families, the subclass Digenea (digenetic trematodes) is a large group of obligate endoparasites of vertebrates known as flukes. Their body is bilaterally flattened and contains a primitive alimentary tract with blind-ended intestinal branches, primitive protonephridial excretory and nervous systems, and reproductive organs (Fig. 14-94) . With the exception of representatives of the family Schistosomatidae (Fig. 14-95) , all avian trematodes are hermaphrodites. Most of the species possess an oral sucker and an acetabulum functioning as attachment organs. The size of avian fluke species varies between less than 1 mm (Centrocestus armatus in cormorants) and several centimeters (Cathemasia hians in storks). The majority of flukes inhabit the intestinal tract, but some have adapted to other organs/cavities. All Schistosomatidae species, e.g., occur in the circulatory system (Fig. 14-96) . Collyriclum faba is found in pairs in subcutaneous cysts located around the vent of songbirds in Eurasia and America. four for the Strigiformes. He also declared the genus Frenkelia to be a synonym of Sarcocystis not only because of their same morphology but also because of their developmental features. Flukes have a diheteroxenic or tetraheteroxenic (mostly aquatic or semiaquatic) life cycle where mollusks are the compulsory first intermediate hosts (Table 14-18) . Polyheteroxenic cycles are rare in avian species. However, some species (i.e., Strigea falconispalumbi) have developed the most complex life cycles among the parasites with raptors as definitive hosts (Krone 2007) . Dicrocoeliidae, Brachylaimidae, and Leucochloridiidae species have land snails as intermediate hosts. Life cycle stages consist of eggs, miracidia, sporocysts, rediae, cercariae, metacercariae, and marita (adult worm). Birds become infected by ingesting infective metacercariae attached to substrates (water plants, snail shells, etc.; or are located in tissues or organs of second intermediate hosts (Fig. 14-98 ) or by transcutaneous penetration of schistosomatid furcocercariae (Fig. 14-99) .\n\nAdult flukes inhabit those sites of the body with a connection to the outer world so they can pass their eggs into the environment. The \n\nActive penetration majority of avian trematodes dwell in the digestive system. These are representatives of the families Brachylaimidae, Leucochloridiidae, Leucocloridiomorphidae, Clinostomidae, Echinostomatidae, Echinochasmidae, Parorchiidae, Psilostomidae, Notocotylidae, Plagiorchiidae, Eumegacetidae, Microphallidae, Pleurogenidae, Heterophyidae, Galactosomatidae, Strigeidae, Bolbocephalidae, Diplostomidae, and Cyathocotylidae. Most of the species inhabit the small intestines and ceca, but specialized trematodes can be found in the mouth cavity (Clinostomum spp. in herons), in the esophagus (Cathemasia hians in storks), in the rectum (Pittacium spp.), in the bursa of fabricii (Prosthogonimus), and even on the rim of the cloaca (species of genera Cloacitrema, Pygorchis, and Stomylotrema). The Trichobilharzia spp. live in the nares of waterfowl and can cause the disease \"swimmers itch\" in humans Other location sites are bile ducts and the gallbladder (Opisthorchiidae, Dicrocoeliidae, and Gymnophallidae), eyelids (Philophthalmidae), respiratory system (Cyclocoelidae and Orchipedidae), excretory system (Renicolidae and Eucotylidae), or oviduct (Prosthogonimidae). Collyriclum faba is located in subcutaneous tissue cysts around the cloacal opening. Bird schistosomes inhabit venous blood vessels mainly of the gut. Their eggs must break through to reach the intestinal lumen. Strigea falconispalumbi, an intestinal fluke of raptors, can use birds as paratenic hosts. In this case metacercariae are located in connective tissues under the skin or between muscles (Fig. 14-100 ).\n\nWith representatives in more than 240 genera in two orders, birds have the most diverse cestode fauna (Table 14-19) . The order Pseudophyllidea has only one family (Diphyllobothtriidae) with avian hosts. \n\nIn Mammals (Only)\n\nIn Amphibians (Only) Diphyllobothrium dendriticum, Digramma interrupta, Schistocephalus solidus, and Ligula intestinalis occur in the intestines of fish-eating birds (gulls, grebes, and cormorants). Within the order Cyclophyllidea, six cestode families consist exclusively of avian-specific species, but only two cestode families contain genera species that can be found in both birds and mammals. All Amabiliidae occur in grebes with the exception of the genus Amabilia, which is found in flamingos.\n\nRepresentatives of the Progynotaeniidae parasitize charadriiform birds and flamingos, whereas tapeworms of families Acoleidae and Dioecocestidae are found only in charadriiform birds. Within the family Anoplocephalidae avian, species are restricted to the subfamily Anoplocephalinae. Most of these species were found in psittacid birds. Cestodes are gut-dwelling platyhelminths with a white to yellowishcolored body divided into scolex, neck, and a segmented strobila (Fig. 14-101) . Their size varies from several millimeters (Davainea proglottina) up to 50 cm (Otiditaenia conoides). The scolex, the holdfast organ of tapeworms, has four suckers and most of the species are equipped with an armed rostellum (Fig. 14-102 ). Very few species lack an armed rostellum. The rostellum in many hymenolepid and dilepidid species is retractile into a rostellar sheet. Size and shape of rostellar hooks can be used for determination. In some cestodes (Raillietina spp.) suckers also can be armed (Fig. 14-103 (Fig. 14-104) . Paruterinid cestodes of the genera Cladotaenia and Paruterina, cestodes of raptors and owls, use rodents as intermediate hosts. Their larval stage called cladothyridium (Fig. 14-105) is located in the liver of intermediate hosts. Both cysticercoids and cladothyrids already have the scolex of the adult cestode.\n\nBirds mainly act as final hosts for tapeworms, but few cases of cestode larvae (tetrathyridia of Mesocestoides spp.) discovered in the \n\nBirds are hosts to a large variety of nematodes located mainly in the alimentary and respiratory tracts. Some spirurids use birds as paratenic hosts. The length of avian nematodes varies from several millimeters up to 35 cm (Serratospiculum sp.; Fig. 14-106) . Most of the species have a cylindrical form, tapering at either end, and are round at the cross section. Male and female nematodes have a similar appearance, except the genera Tetrameres and Microtetrameres where females are nearly spherical (Fig. 14-107) . Depending on species, the cuticle forms various structures, such as cervical and caudal papillae, alae, cordons, and a copulatory bursa (Fig. 14-108) in male bursate nematodes. The digestive system of nematodes is tubular with a mouth opening that may be surrounded by lips (Fig. 14-109) . In some species the mouth opens into a buccal cavity. The esophagus in many of the nematodes is divided into a muscular and glandular part. It is followed by the intestine that opens at the posterior end. In ascarids, both esophagus and intestine at their junction may have blind-ending appendices. The esophagus of hairworms has a capillary form surrounded by a single column of cells known as stichosome. Nematodes are unisexual parasites. The female reproductive system comprises an ovary, oviduct, and uterus which may be paired. The male organs consist of a single testes and a vas deferens terminating in an ejaculatory duct into the cloaca. Spicules and gubernaculums are chitinous accessory male organs used during copulation.\n\nThe basic life cycle of nematodes includes eggs and four larval stages. The majority of avian nematode species (Contracaecum, Porrocaecum, Eustrongylides, Trichinella, Histriches, and all spirurids) have an indirect life cycle (biohelminths) that involves a variety of avertebrates (mainly arthropods) as intermediate hosts. The rest are soiltransmitted geohelminths with a direct life cycle (Trichostrongylus, Amidostomum, Epomidiostomum, Heterakis, Ascaridia, and Subulura).\n\nIn some nematodes with a primarily direct life cycle (Syngamus and Cyathostoma) paratenic hosts (earth worms) may enhance the chance of contact of the parasite and its avian host. Filaroid nematodes are vectorborne parasites and are transmitted by blood-sucking arthropods.\n\nAvian nematodes are mainly found in the digestive tract ( Fig.  14-110) . Some of them also inhabit the respiratory system (Fig. 14-111 and Table 14 -20) . Apart from digestive and respiratory systems adult filarioid nematodes in birds (16 genera) can be found in subcutaneous and connective tissues, in the body cavity, or in heart and blood vessels. These are Pelecitus fulicaeatrae in tendons of the legs of coots, Eulimdana spp. in the neck of waders and gulls, or Sarconema eurycerca in the heart of swans. Their microfilariae circulate in the circulatory system or inhabit the skin of the host (Fig. 14-112) . Larval nematodes, such as Physocephalus spp., Spirocerca lupi, or Paraspiralatus sakeri encyst in the wall of the alimentary tract or under the skin and between Parasites muscles (Fig. 14-113) . Trichinella pseudospiralis in its larval stage is another extraintestinal parasite that might infect birds of prey. Its larvae are located in muscle fibers (Fig. 14-114 ).\n\nAcanthocephalans, also known as thorny-headed or spiny-headed worms, belong to a relatively small group of obligatory endoparasites in the alimentary tract of vertebrates. The length of avian species varies from several millimeters to greater than 10 cm. At adult stages acanthocephalans are gut dwellers. The fixatory organ (proboscis) is deeply inserted into the intestinal wall (Fig. 14-115 parasites of ducks, Sphaerirostris embae (Fig. 14-116) and Empodius taeniatus (Fig. 14-117 ) occur in bustards, and a number of Centrorhynchus species parasitize birds of prey and owls.\n\nLeeches are bloodsucking parasites and predators in freshwater, marine, and moist terrestrial ecosystems. Leeches are hermaphrodites. Their segmented body consists of head segments containing the anterior brain and the sucker, midbody segments with ganglia and reproductive organs and posterior segments that are fused together posterior to the sucker. Of the 12 known families, four (Glossiphoniidae, Ornithobdellidae, Hirudinidae, and Haemadipsidae) with 33 species have been found to parasitize birds. Nasal leeches of the genus Theromyzon are specialized to feed on waterbirds. Their preferred feeding sites are nasal cavities, trachea, and beneath the nictitating membrane of the eyes. \n\nThe phylum Arthropoda consists of two major groups that contain parasites of birds. These are the arachnids with the subclass Acari (ticks and mites) and Mandibulata with the class of insects. Most of the arthropods are ectoparasites. However, some mites or at least their development stages (nest mites, air sac mites, burrowing mites) and larvae of myiasis flies are well adapted to endoparasitic lifestyle. The systematic position of pentastomids is unclear as they are situated somewhere between helminths and arthropods.\n\nThe class Arachnida unites the Acari (ticks and mites) with representatives of 13 other subclasses of joint-legged invertebrates (spiders, cave spiders, solifuges, scorpions, pseudoscorpions, etc.). Except larval stages, which are hexapod, acari have four pairs of legs and the cephalothorax and abdomen are fused together. Mouthparts consist of paired pedipalps and chelicerae. In addition, ticks possess an unpaired hypostome. The supraorder Anactinotrichida (formerly: Parasitiformes) consists of the two orders Metastigmata (ticks) and Mesostigmata (parasitiform mites), while the supraorder Actinotrichida (formerly known as Acariformes) combines the two orders of prostigmatic (formerly: Trombidiformes) and astigmatic mites (formerly: Sarcoptiformes).\n\nTicks belong to the suborder Metastigmata (Ixodida) with about 800 known species. Hard ticks (Ixodidae) are of minor direct disease importance for birds because only larvae and nymphs of three host species attack birds, and adults are mainly found on mammals (Fig.  14-118) . Nevertheless, birds, especially migrating species, play a role in the life cycle and distribution of ticks of the genera Ixodes, Amblyomma, and Hyalomma and may be of importance in the epidemiology of tickborne diseases. Of the more than 50 described species of the genus Argas, three species are of major importance for birds. A. reflexus (Fig. 14-119) and A. polonicus can be found mainly on pigeons, whereas A. persicus is more often associated with chickens. In the absence of preferred hosts, these ticks will infest other birds and can affect humans as well. Female Argas spp. are up to 11 mm in length and up to 8 mm wide; males are smaller. The egg-shaped body is dorsoventrally flattened with defined margins. The surface cuticle has a leather like and unsclerotized structure. The capitulum with mouthparts can be seen only from the ventral side. Like all argasids, Argas species are nocturnal. They shelter in cracks and cleaves and they leave only for blood meals. Soft ticks have a multihost life cycle including adults, eggs, and one larval and up to four nymphal stages. The whole life cycle depends on environmental conditions and the availability of hosts and lasts between 3 and 6 months and up to 3 years. In the absence of hosts, adult soft ticks can fast for several years. Apart from blood feeding, these parasites are vectors and can transmit Borrelia anserina and Aegyptianella pullorum. In the absence of preferred hosts, avian soft ticks also attack humans and become pests, especially in cities with feral pigeon problems.\n\nRepresentatives of this group of mites are bloodsucking parasites with relatively long legs. Avian species belong to the families Dermanyssidae, Macronyssidae, and Rhinonyssidae. The life cycle includes adults, eggs, and hexapode larval and two octopode nymphal stages. Three species of these mites are avian ectoparasites. The red mite or poultry mite, Dermanyssus gallinae, is a stationary periodical, nocturnally active, euryxenous pest that shelters at daytime in hideaways (cracks and cleaves in poultry houses, below perches, bird nests, etc.) and attack their host in the dark to suck blood. In the absence of hosts these mites can survive up to 5 months. The northern fowl mite, Ornithonyssus sylviarum of the family Macronyssidae is a serious pest of poultry and wild birds in northern Europe and America, while the tropical fowl mite, O. bursa, is widely distributed in warmer climates (Fig. 14-120) . Both Ornithonyssus spp. are stationary permanent parasites that can survive only 3 weeks when separated from their hosts. In the absence of avian hosts D. gallinae and Ornithonyssus spp. can attack mammals and even humans. Another mesostigmatic mite, Sternostoma tracheacolum, of the family Rhinonyssidae, is a bloodsucking mite of the respiratory passages of canaries and finches. It has been also found in a wide range of wild and domestic birds.\n\nProstigmatic mites have a relatively big body and a well-developed gnathosoma (capitulum) with mouthparts (chelicerae) constructed to grab or to pierce and pedipalps suitable to feel or to grab. Representatives of the families Cheyletidae, Harpyrhynchidae, Syringophilidae, and Trombiculidae are avian parasites. Of the large family Cheyletidae only a few species are of parasitologic interest because most of them are free-living predators. More than 25 species of the genus Ornithocheyletia have been described mainly in wild birds. O. hallae parasitizes pigeons and doves. This mite pierces the surface layers of the skin and causes itching reactions. Many Cheyletidae species are predators. Members of the genera Cheletosoma, Cheletoides, and Cheletopsis can also be found on birds where they prey on quill mites.\n\nSeveral species of the genus Harpyrhynchus parasitize birds of different orders. These mites are less than 500 \u00b5m in length and live in colonies in the follicles at the basis of feathers and are transmitted by contact. Female mites drill into the intact skin and lay eggs. H. nidulans is one of these species found in pigeons. Mites cause inflammation and formation of bean-sized inflammatory nodules that contain hundreds of adult mites, larvae, and eggs, resulting in feathers falling off.\n\nQuill mites of the family Syringophilidae invade the calamus, the lower part of the quill. More than 100 species have been described worldwide. Syringophilus bipectinatus and Peristerophila columba are found in chickens and pigeons, respectively. These slender mites seem to be apathogenic. At molt, mites leave the quill and enter freshly developing feathers.\n\nChigger or harvest mites of the family Trombiculidae have a worldwide distribution and consist of approximately 1600 species. In these mites, only the hexapod larvae live a parasitic lifestyle (Fig. 14-121) . Protonymphs and tritonymphs are aphagous resting stages while deutonymphs and adults are predators of soil avertebrates. Representative of the genus Neotrombicula, N. autumnalis, N. carpathica, and N. inopinata are the best investigated species. In birds, the yellow to orange-red colored egg-shaped larvae (up to 500 \u00b5m long) can be found between feathers of the belly and upper legs and also in the upper respiratory tract. Chigger mites are also important for their role as vectors for Orientia tsutsugamushi, Coxiella burnetii, and Anaplasma phagocytophilum (formerly Ehrlichia phagocytophilum).\n\nThe order Astigmata is characterized by missing spiracles. Gaseous exchange takes place over the whole surface of the mite. These mites are relatively small, and avian representatives can be found in the families Hypoderidae, Analgidae, Dermoglyphidae, Epidermoptidae, Pterolichidae, Knemidocoptidae, and Laminosioptidae.\n\nNest mites of the family Hypoderidae spend a part of their life cycle as subcutaneous parasites (hypopi) in pigeons and wild birds (Fig.  14-122) . Deutonymphs of Hypodectes propus can enter subcutaneous adipose tissues and leave the host after growing up. The process of entering and leaving the host's skin causes restlessness, dermatitis, and may lead to abnormal molt and loss of feathers. Adult mites are free living.\n\nFeather mites of the family Analgoidea (Fig. 14-123) is a diverse group of strongly stenoxenous parasites counting more than 2000 different species in more than 20 families. Members of Falculiferidae and Analgidae dwell on the surface of feathers, Dermoglyphidae species also inhabit feather quills and Epidermoptidae species live on the skin (Table 14-21). Most of these mites have a size of around 500 \u00b5m, but deutonymphs of Falculifer rostratus can reach a length of 1.3 mm. The life cycle of feather mites consists of oviparous adults one larval and two nymphal stages. Birds become infected with teleonymphs by contact. In the past feather mites were considered to be apathogenic, but under conditions of high host concentrations, they can cause skin and feather alterations.\n\nBurrowing mites of the family Knemidocoptidae seen in birds (Fig. 14-124) are closely related to Sarcoptidae species in mammals. Seven species of these are stationary permanent parasites known to parasitize on birds (Table 14-22) . Depending on the site of alterations they are called scaly face mites, scaly leg mites, or depluming mites. These mites are relatively small (males are up to 170 \u00b5m and females are up to 480 \u00b5m) with a circular to oval body and short stubby extremities bearing long unsegmented pedicles with stalked pulvilli and claws in male and female specimens, respectively. Fertilized females Pigeon Skin at the base of feathers on back and head bore hollows into skin folds or into the plain epidermis resulting in a comb like meshwork. Mites are transmitted by contact. The life cycle of the viviparous parasites consisting of adults and one hexapod larval and two octopod nymphal stages is completed in 20 and 26 days for males and females, respectively. Under favorable conditions they can survive isolated from their hosts for up to 2 weeks. Mites of the Family Cytodidae are parasites of the respiratory tract of birds, rodents, and bats. The air sac mite, Cytodites nudus, parasitizes the airways, lungs, and air sacs of galliform birds and has been found in canaries. The males of these oval-shaped mites are up to 575 \u00b5m long and females reach a length of up to 650 \u00b5m. The smooth cuticle bears delicate striations and is covered with sparse short hairs and extremities end with unsegmented pedicles with stalked pulvilli.\n\nThe fowl cyst mite, Laminosioptes cysticola (Laminosioptidae), is an internal parasite that invades subcutaneous tissues of the neck, breast, flanks, and abdomen of galliform birds and pigeons. The cylindrically shaped male and female mites are relatively small and reach a length of up to 230 and 260 \u00b5m, respectively. The smooth and nearly hairless body bears only few long bristles and the legs are short. The first and second pair of legs bear claws and the third and fourth pair end with short unsegmented pedicles with stalked pulvilli. These mites may enter superficial muscle layers and get encapsulated by connective host tissues and become calcified forming yellowish white nodules up to 1 mm.\n\nUniting more than one million species, insects are by far the most diverse class in the Animal Kingdom and it is estimated that more than 370,000 insects have a parasitic lifestyle. Entire orders among insects consist only of parasitic species (Anoplura, Mallophaga and Siphonaptera) and other orders, like Diptera, contain bloodsucking representatives that harm not only by hematophagia but play an important role as vectors. Parasitic insect groups of importance for birds are bugs, biting lice, mosquitoes, blackflies, biting midges, myiasis-causing flies, louse flies, fleas as true parasites and beetles as pests. Beetles are also important intermediate hosts for Serratospiculum spp. (Samour and Naldo, 2001 ) and related nematodes. Insects differ from ticks and mites by the presence of three pairs of legs and the clear division of the body into caput, thorax and abdomen. Their mouthparts consist of paired mandibles, maxillae, labrium and unpaired labrum and hypopharynx. Depending on lifestyle and food uptake they can be modified as bitinglicking (biting lice), licking-sucking (housefly), or piercing-sucking (sucking lice, bugs, and fleas). With very few exceptions insects are oviparous. Most insects have a holometabolic development that consists of egg, larva, pupa, and imago. Lice and bugs and some other groups undergo a hemimetabolic development (incomplete metamorphosis), where larval stages are similar to adults and a pupal stage is missing. Temporarily periodic bloodsucking insects differ in their main activity. Diurnal species are active during the day while nocturnal species are active during the night. Crepuscular insects prefer the twilight as the main activity period.\n\nThe order Hemiptera (true bugs) with more than 80,000 species is widespread throughout tropical and temperate regions. Veterinary important species are restricted to the families Cimicidae and Reduviidae. Reduviid bugs, especially from domestic and peridomestic environments, are not host specific and may get their blood meal from a large variety of hosts, including birds. In contrast to reduviid bugs, most of the cimicid bugs or bed bugs are associated with avian hosts and some of them (Cimex lectularius, C. hemipterus, C. columbarius, Haematosiphon inodorus, and Ornithocoris toledoi) are economically important pests of poultry. Cimicid bugs (Fig. 14-125) are wingless, temporarily permanent, hematophagous, euryxenous, and nocturnal active parasites. The size of the dorsoventrally flattened insects ranges from 3 to 6 mm. They puncture cutaneous blood vessels of the host with their mandibular stylets. After precedented blood meals female bed bugs lay clutches of three to five eggs (a total of 200) in cracks and crevices of houses and outbuildings, dovecots, nest boxes, etc. Firststage larvae hatch after a 2- to 3-week incubation period and the whole development includes five larval stages completed in 6 weeks. The entire life span lasts up to 18 months. Bed bugs can fast for more than 12 months.\n\nMallophaga (biting or chewing lice) is a group of obligatory ectoparasites mainly of birds and to a lesser extent (only 12%) of mammals. The large diversity of avian mallophaga of more than 3800 different species in 253 genera can be explained by the strict stenoxeny of most species and their presence in nearly all bird species. Up to 20 different lice species can be found on a single bird species. Depending on species, size varies between 0.5 and 14 mm. The body of the wingless insects is dorsoventrally compressed and clearly divided into caput, thorax, and abdomen. Mallophages are divided into two morphologically distinct suborders, Amblycera and Ischnocera, containing 30% and 70% of all avian species, respectively. Examples for avian amblyceran genera are Menopon, Eomenacanthus, Menacanthus, Hohorstiella, Bonomiella, Trinoton, Colpocephalum, and Neocolpocephalum (Fig. 14-126) . Representatives of this group feed by chewing soft areas of the skin causing an area of localized bleeding from where they drink. Ischnoceran genera, like Goniocotes, Chelopistes, Stenocrotaphus, Campanulotes, Coloceras, Lipeurus, Cuclotogaster, Anatoecus, Columbicola and Anaticola, parasitize domestic birds (Fig. 14-127) . Ischnocera species are restricted to feathers and feed on feathers and dead skin dandruff. Mallophages are stationary permanent parasites with a paurometabolic development. The whole life cycle includes eggs (Fig. 14-128) , three larval instars, and the adult stage on the host. Larvae hatch after a 4- to 10-day incubation of eggs and each larval stage is completed within 3 to 12 days. Adults live up to 1 month and females lay one egg per day after fertilization. Transmission of biting lice is mainly by contact horizontally and vertically, but it is also known that Ischnoceran lice can be transmitted via phoresis on hippoboscid flies.\n\nThe suborder Nematocera consists of four important families of bloodsucking insects: mosquitoes (Culicidae), blackflies (Simuliidae), biting midges (Ceratopogonidae), and sandflies (Phlebotominae) as one subfamily of moth flies (Psychodidae). Females of all these holometabolic insects are temporarily periodic parasites and their role as avian parasites is underestimated (Table 14-23) . The mentioned Phlebotominae species are not really ornithophilic but are known to suck blood on avian hosts. \n\nMyiasis is the infestation of healthy or necrotic tissues of the live body with dipteran larvae. Obligate myiasis is caused by larvae of fly species that require a living host as part of their life cycle. Facultative myiasis maggots normally develop in decaying organic matter and occasionally infest necrotic wounds. Avian myiasis is mainly diagnosed in nestlings of nest-dwelling birds (Passeriformes, Falconiformes, Strigiformes, Coraciiformes, and Columbiformes) and handicapped birds. It is caused by species of Calliphoridae (Protocalliphora), Muscidae (Philornis, Passeromyia, and Mydaea), and Neottiophilidae (Neottiophilium and Actinoptera). Protocalliphora species with more than 30 representatives can be found in Europe, North America, northern Africa, and temperate Asia. Philornis is reported from South America and Passeromyia and Mydaea from Asia and Australia. Nestskipper flies of the genus Neottiophilium are found in the Palearctic. Other calliphorids associated with avian myiasis include Calliphora and Lucilia species in Europe. Also Wohlfahrtia magnifica in the Old World and W. opaca in the New World can cause myiasis in birds. Females of calliphorid and muscid species are attracted by odor and lay eggs whereas sarcophagid flesh flies deposit their larvae on the body of their hosts. The parasitic stage lasts up to 1 week and larvae leave the host to pupate.\n\nLouse flies (family: Hippoboscidae) are a relatively small group of dorsoventrally flattened, dark-colored, obligate hematophagous viviparid flies of 2 to 10 mm in length with piercing-sucking mouthparts. Their larval development takes place in the uterus and the female gives birth to fully developed larvae ready to pupate. The family has three subfamilies consisting of approximately 213 different species. While all species of the subfamily Lipopteninae parasitize mammals, most of the Ornithomyinae species parasitize birds. Ten of the 16 genera of this subfamily have species associated with birds. The best known are Crataerina hirundinis, parasites of swallows and martins; C. acutipennis, C. melbae, C. pacifica, and C. pallida, parasites of swifts; and the pigeon louse fly, Pseudolynchia canariensis (Fig. 14-129) . The life cycle of stenoxenous Crataerina species of migrating birds appears to be temperature mediated and associated with the presence of hosts at nesting sites. On return from winter habitats swifts are louse fly free and become infected with freshly hatched parasites. At the beginning of the season, transmission seems to be horizontal, and during the breeding season transmission is undoubtedly vertical from adults to nestlings. Hippoboscids have a low fecundity and produce only 12 to 15 larvae deposited in the nest. Most of the pupae are produced during the nesting period. Pupae remain in diapause until the following spring. C. pallida takes blood meals of 20 to 40 mg every 5 days. They feed on the lower rump of nestlings. On adults they are often found feeding on the belly and neck. P. canariensis was found on a wide range of avian hosts (13 families in eight orders) but columbiform birds are the main hosts. The main distribution of pigeon louse flies is in tropical, subtropical, and temperate areas with mild winters. In contrast to C. pallida, its pupae die at low temperatures. The longevity of pigeon louse fly imagines was determined experimentally and lasts 17 days when fed at 24-hour intervals. During this time, a female produces an average of nine pupae. P. canariensis can transmit Haemoproteus columbae. The infection with this hemoparasite is tolerated by adult pigeons but may be fatal in nestlings. H. turtur is another species transmitted by the vector. It is very host specific for turtle doves. Mallophages and a number of avian-associated mites are found to be phorets on P. canariensis. The subfamily Hippoboscinae contains one avian species, Struthiobosca struthionis, a parasite of ostriches (Struthio camelus) in East and South Africa.\n\nThe order Siphopnaptera consists of approximately 2500 described species in 239 genera and 19 families. Fleas are small, wingless, and obligate hematophagous parasites of warm-blooded vertebrates. Their size ranges from 1.6 to 9 mm. The compact, laterally compressed body bears caudal-directed spines and bristles in a species-specific pattern and most species are equipped with combs of spines. Males are usually smaller than females and sexes differ in the structure of antennae. In veterinary important species, the third pair of legs is stronger than the others and is well adapted for jumping. Both sexes are hematophagous with piercing-sucking mouthparts. Fleas have a holometabolic development. Female flies deposit eggs on substrates in the environment of the host. Three worm-like instars have chewing mouthparts and feed on organic substrates (hair, dandruff, and dead insects). Feces of the adult fleas that contain undigested dry blood may be a requirement for the development of some species. Larvae pupate on the ground covering themselves in a silk cocoon to which, with dust and other fine particles, they adhere. After 1 to 2 weeks fleas are ready to hatch stimulated by vibration that signals the presence of a suitable host. The vast majority of fleas have mammals as hosts and only 6% of the species prefer avian hosts. Only five families (Ceratophyllidae, Leptopsyllidae, Pulicidae, Pygiopsyllidae, and Rhopalopsyllidae) contain avian-related species. Fourteen species of the genus Ceratophyllus (Fig. 14-130) were detected in bird nests in Europe. Of these, C. gallinae, C. tribulis, and C. garei were found to have a broad host spectrum including 20 to 60 birds. C. sciurorum has rodents (dormice, tree squirrels, and yellownecked and wood mice) as main hosts but also has been detected in nests of more than 30 bird species. The moorhen fly, Dasypsyllus gallinulae, which originally was distributed in South America, was also detected in Europe and is considered low host specific. Species with a narrow host range were C. fringillae, C. styx, C. hirundinis, C. borealis, C. rossittensis, C. rusticus, C. vagabundus, C. columbae, and Ornithophaga mikulini of the family Leptopsyllidae. Echidnophaga gallinacea (Fig. 14-131) , known as the hen flea, belongs to the family Pulicidae and has a cosmopolitan distribution. It is one of the 21 species of sticktight fleas more commonly seen on mammals. The host spectrum of hen fleas is not restricted to avian hosts; it can also be found on carnivores, rodents, horses, and even humans. Contrary to the abovementioned species, females of E. gallinacea are stationary periodic parasites (Fig. 14-132) . Fluke-armed ledges on their maxilla allow sticktight fleas to be attached to the host as long as 3 weeks.\n\nPentastomida is a group of about 100 species of parasites of the respiratory system. Their systematic affiliation between helminths and arthropods is unsolved. Because of the resemblance of the genus Linguatula \n\nBlood parasites occur in nearly all species of birds, but those living in extreme climatic conditions and in areas where vectors are absent are to a tongue, these parasites are called tongue worms. Most species occur in reptiles and only two species of the genus Reighardia, R. sternae and R. lomviae, are known to utilize marine birds (gulls and alcids) as an avian-definitive host (Fig. 14-133) . In contrast to all other species with an indirect life cycle, the genus Reighardia has a direct bird-to-bird transmission. In a relatively recent publication mature Raillietiella trachea were described in vultures in Punjab, Pakistan (Riley et al., 2013) .\n\nusually found to be infected only when transferred to other locations such as exhibits in zoologic collections or captive breeding programs or as pets. These birds are frequently totally susceptible to infection by a wide range of parasites, many of which may be pathogenic (Peirce, 1989) . The extent of mortality in wild populations caused by hemoparasites is difficult to gauge. Unless there is a noticeable die-off in a specific population where a veterinary diagnosis confirms the involvement of hematozoa either as sole infection or as a component of concomitant infection with other disease agents, most sick or dead birds rapidly become prey to predators and scavengers. Thus nearly 90% of all records of mortality and pathogenicity caused by avian hematozoa have been described from domestic species (chickens, turkeys, ducks, and geese) and only 5% from free-living birds (Bennett et al., 1993b) .\n\nWith the exception of microfilariae (the immature stages of filarial worms) and Aegyptianella, most blood parasites are protozoa. Diagnosis is dependent on Giemsa-stained thin smears of peripheral blood, but for the more common genera, molecular techniques are being used more frequently (Perkins, 2014) . Although most postmortem blood smears are of little value taxonomically, they are still valuable in identifying parasites, at least to the generic level, and in correlating endogenous stages that may be found on histopathology examination.\n\nThe genus Plasmodium (Figs. 14-133 to 14-139) is an apicomplexan parasite closely related to Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon. Bennett et al (1993a) recorded approximately 34 species of Plasmodium from birds, but this number has nearly doubled based on the application of molecular techniques (Perkins, 2014) . These species can be grouped into five subgenera (Table 14 -24) according to specific morphologic characteristics such as size and shape of gametocytes and schizonts. More recently an additional subgenus, Bennettinia, has been established to accommodate the single species P. juxtanucleare (Perkins, 2014) .\n\nWith the one known exception of Plasmodioides, which is transmitted by Anopheles spp., all other subgenera and species are transmitted by culicine mosquitoes. When an infected vector bites a new host, parasite sporozoites are passed into the blood, where they eventually reach the liver and undergo development into preerythrocytic schizonts. These produce merozoites, which enter the erythrocytes and develop into macrogametocytes (female) or microgametocytes (male) or segmenters (asexual schizonts). All stages contain melanin pigment granules. The merozoites produced from asexual schizonts repeat the erythrocytic cycle. The intraerythrocytic merogony cycles continue indefinitely unless the host's immune system or death intervenes. Thus there is a potential for persistence of infection with frequent relapses. Second-generation and subsequent generations of exoerythrocytic schizonts may occur in tissues other than the liver. In early infections, only trophozoites and schizonts may occur in erythrocytes, so specific diagnosis is difficult. Likewise, in established infections only gametocytes may be present and if these are of a species with an elongated form they can easily be confused with those of Haemoproteus. In these situations molecular techniques may provide a more definitive diagnosis. Some avian species of Plasmodium are known to occur only in the type host from which the parasite was originally described. Other Plasmodium spp. are found in a wide range of hosts and families and often the morphology is markedly different. This frequently makes a definitive diagnosis to species level difficult unless tissue stages and vectors are also known. Specific clinical signs of Plasmodium infection are lacking, but listlessness, lethargy, and anemia may be indicators of the disease. Generally Plasmodium spp. are more pathogenic in domestic birds: P. gallinaceum in chickens (frequent involvement of brain schizonts), P. durae in turkeys, and P. circumflexum in ducks and geese. The species that occurs most in free-living birds is P. relictum, which has been recorded in over 380 hosts from 74 families. This parasite and P. elongatum are frequent causes of mortality in penguins in zoological collections.\n\nP. vaughani has been recorded from 270 hosts and is particularly common in passerine species, and P. circumflexum occurs in approximately 140 avian hosts. Other species of Plasmodium are less common and are considered to be of little clinical significance, with the possible exception of P. juxtanucleare in chickens.\n\nMixed infections with two species of Plasmodium are not uncommon, complicating diagnosis even further. The application of molecular techniques can often separate these species where morphology alone is insufficient. Xenodiagnosis, by blood inoculation into laboratory birds such as canaries, is possible for many Plasmodium spp. Color illustrations of the more common species can be found in Garnham (1966) .\n\nSpecies of Haemoproteus (Figs. 14-140 to 14-145) differ from those of Plasmodium in that the erythrocytic stages produce only gametocytes. Macrogametocytes and microgametocytes can be differentiated in Giemsa-stained thin blood smears. Generally, the nucleus of macrogametocytes is more compact and the cytoplasm denser. Melanin pigment granules tend to be evenly distributed in macrogametocytes but more clustered in polar positions in microgametocytes. The pigment granules are similar to those of Plasmodium but are frequently larger. There are approximately 169 species of Haemoproteus (Peirce, 2005 and unpublished observations), the majority of which are host specific to the family level and can be divided into five distinct morphologic forms (Bennett and Peirce, 1988) : microhalteridial, halteridial, circumnuclear, rhabdosomal, and discosomal. Halteridial species are most common and account for the largest group (65%). The vectors are known for only 12 species, and 10 of these are transmitted by Culicoides spp. Only two are transmitted by hippoboscids. Schizonts of Haemoproteus occur in a wide range of organs but are usually most frequent in the lung and liver tissue. Few species of Haemoproteus are known to be pathogenic; H. meleagridis in turkeys, H. nettionis in ducks and geese, and H. columbae in pigeons and doves are the general exceptions. No definitive clinical signs of haemoproteid infection are applicable, but the general observations pertaining to Plasmodium infections also can be considered to apply to Haemoproteus. A clinically sick emerald-spotted wood dove in Zambia with mixed infection with H. columbae and Leucocytozoon marchouxi was 25% under average weight (Peirce 1984) .\n\nMixed infections with Haemoproteus and Plasmodium are common and multiple invasion of erythrocytes can occur. Differential diagnosis is required but may not always be possible when parasitemias are low. Some species of Haemoproteus (e.g., H. enucleator) may completely expel the host cell (erythrocyte) nucleus, similar to some Plasmodium spp. (e.g., P. relictum). Some species of Haemoproteus contain reddishpurple volutin granules, which can often be quite large. The exact significance of these granules is not clear but they may represent strain differences. They have often been mistaken for schizonts of Plasmodium, from which differential diagnosis is required.\n\nSpecies of Leucocytozoon (Figs. 14-146 to 14-150) have a life cycle similar to that of Haemoproteus. In some species, the gametocytes develop in erythrocytes, in others in monocytes and lymphocytes. Although the macrogametocytes and microgametocytes of Leucocytozoon can be differentiated on similar characteristics from those of Plasmodium and Haemoproteus, they lack the presence of melanin pigment seen in the other two genera, although small reddish granules are often present.\n\nAs the gametocytes develop they cause considerable distortion of the host cell. Two distinct morphologic forms occur: round and elongated (fusiform). In some species, only one type of morph occurs, but in others both may occur. In species with both morphs, the round ones arise from the first-generation hepatic schizonts and the fusiform morphs from second-generation megaloschizonts (Fallis et al., 1974 ). The precise significance of megaloschizonts is not known, because they also occur in species with only round morphs.\n\nThere are approximately 86 species of Leucocytozoon (Peirce, 2005 and unpublished observations), most of which are host specific at least to the family level and, with the exception of L. (Akiba) caulleryi, which is transmitted by Culicoides, the vectors are all simuliids. Pathogenicity caused by Leucocytozoon is generally more common than with Haemoproteus. High levels of mortality have been recorded with L. (Akiba) caulleryi in chickens, L. smithi in turkeys, and L. simondi in both domestic and free-living ducks and geese. Until recently, there was little evidence of pathogenicity with L. marchouxi in pigeons and doves (Peirce, 1984) , but recent studies have shown this species to be pathogenic in the endangered pink pigeon (Columba mayeri) in Mauritius, with recorded mortality in squabs. It has also been shown to be a species producing megaloschizonts, although only round morphs occur. There is also some evidence that L. danilewskyi may be pathogenic in certain species of owls.\n\nThe endogenous stages (schizonts) occur in nearly all organs and muscle, causing severe damage and necrosis (Peirce et al., 2004) . It is the degree of tissue damage that causes mortality rather than the gametocyte parasitemia. Very high levels of parasitemia have been observed in some hosts without any obvious clinical signs of disease. Outward clinical signs of the disease are similar to those of Plasmodium together with weight loss, as birds become too sick to feed.\n\nMixed infections with Plasmodium and/or Haemoproteus are common and differential diagnosis is required. It is often in cases of concomitant infection that the usually benign single infections may become pathogenic.\n\nTrypanosomes (Figs. 14-151 to 14-153) are very pleomorphic and of the approximately 98 species described from birds probably no more than 8 to 10 are valid. They are transmitted by a variety of vectors, including mosquitoes, hippoboscids, simuliids, and mites. Very high parasitemias are not uncommon, but there is no evidence to indicate that any species is pathogenic. There is very little evidence of host specificity. Detection by examination of Giemsa-stained thin blood smears will only illustrate trypanosomes when present in the host at reasonable levels. A more reliable method is to use the microhematocrit tube and prepare a smear from the buffy coat formed after centrifuging. Trypanosomes are frequently observed in mixed infections with other hematozoa. \n\nThere are 17 species of Hepatozoon (Figs. 14-154 and 14-155) described from birds (Bennett et al., 1992; Peirce, 2005) . The parasites normally invade monocytes but occasionally lymphocytes may be targeted. The full life cycle is unknown for any of the avian species but an argasid tick and a flea have been shown as probable vectors for H. atticorae of swallows. Ixodid ticks and mites and other arthropods may also be involved in transmission. In general none of the avian species are considered to be pathogenic with the exception of H. kiwii. The genus probably has a far more common distribution than current records suggest, but is most likely overlooked in screening blood smears. Known hosts range from the tropics to Antarctica.\n\nThere are approximately 16 species described of the avian piroplasm Babesia (Fig. 14-156) . The group was reviewed by Peirce (2000) . The parasites invade erythrocytes, where the trophozoites multiply by binary fission forming pairs or by schizogony forming tetrads. Until recently only B. shortti occurring in Falconiformes was thought to be pathogenic (Samour and Peirce, 1996) , but B. kiwiensis from Apterygidae also is pathogenic in kiwi chicks (Peirce et al., 2003) . The disease in birds follows a similar pattern to that in mammals, where multiple invasion of erythrocytes leads to destruction of cells, anemia, jaundice, and death.\n\nNone of the vectors of avian Babesia spp. are known but they are assumed to be ixodid ticks, although an argasid tick of the genus Ornithodoros has been suggested as a possible vector of B. shortti in prairie falcons.\n\nRemoval of ticks from birds and prevention of reinfestation is required to control Babesia infections. Differential diagnosis between Babesia and the trophozoite stages of Plasmodium and early gametocytes of Haemoproteus is required. The tetrads of Babesia are morphologically similar to the small schizonts of some Plasmodium spp. (e.g., P. rouxi). The main differential characteristics of Babesia are the absence of melanin pigment granules and the distinctive white vacuole.\n\nThe prevalence of Babesia in birds is probably greater than records would suggest. The small number of records is no doubt from misdiagnosis of Plasmodium or Haemoproteus. The occurrence of mixed infections should also be considered. Experience with B. shortti infections in falcons indicates that an early diagnosis is required if appropriate chemotherapy is to be successful.\n\nThe life cycle and taxonomic position of Atoxoplasma parasites (Fig.  14-157 ) has been the subject of much discussion and confusion. It is now generally accepted that the genus is a member of the Eimeriidae family and is closely related to Isospora. Separation of the two genera requires molecular techniques. Extraintestinal stages result from the ingestion of Isospora-like oocysts, where the parasites invade mononuclear leukocytes. The parasites are particularly common in passerine birds and about 19 species have been described.\n\nHigh parasitemias are common in nestlings and young birds but are rarely pathogenic, because most infections are subclinical. Recent studies, however, have shown that, with some species, mortality can occur in adult birds, particularly when kept in captivity (McGill et al., 2010) . Postmortem Giemsa-stained impression smears of liver and spleen (Fig. 14-158) frequently reveal large numbers of parasites. There are a few reports attributed to Atoxoplasma sp. where specific clinical signs have been described. The parasite has been implicated as a cause of these records are probably of closely related species. Aegyptianella botuliformis has been described from guinea fowl in South Africa (Huchzermeyer et al., 1992) and more recently A. minutus from passerine birds in Malaysia (Peirce, 1999) .\n\nDifferential diagnosis is required to separate Aegyptianella from early trophozoites and gametocytes of Plasmodium and Haemoproteus, respectively. The absence of melanin pigment is usually indicative of Aegyptianella and in higher parasitemias the morphology is more varied.\n\nMicrofilariae are the larval stages of filarial worms, of which there are many genera and species occurring in birds. The morphology varies considerably from short and stumpy to long and thin (Fig. 14-160) . The larvae usually demonstrate a circadian rhythm coinciding with vector activity. During this time large numbers may be present in peripheral blood. The majority of species appear to be benign but, where concomitant infection with other parasites or diseases occurs, large numbers of larvae may cause some degree of morbidity.\n\nThe accurate diagnosis of blood parasites requires good quality, Giemsa-stained, thin blood smears. Smears prepared postmortem are useful in indicating the presence of parasites, even if this is restricted of \"going light\" in greenfinches (Cooper et al., 1989) and as a cause of inappetence and \"fluffed-up feathering\" in 4-to 8-week-old bullfinches. Histopathology of one bird with enlarged liver and spleen revealed various pathologic changes including encapsulated granulomata with necrotic areas and general hepatic congestion (McNamee et al., 1995) . Preventive measures recommended are good aviary hygiene, especially frequent replacement of drinking water and bathing bowls to prevent ingestion of sporulated oocysts.\n\nParasites of the genus Aegyptianella (Fig. 14-159 ) are rickettsias with close affinities to Anaplasma, Eperythrozoon, etc., all of which are grouped in the family Anaplasmataceae. In domestic poultry A. pullorum is pathogenic. The intraerythrocytic parasites cause severe anemia, jaundice, and frequently death. The vector of A. pullorum is the argasid tick Argas persicus and the control of this tick is essential in preventing exposure of chickens to the disease. Parasites resembling A. pullorum have been recorded from turkeys, ducks, geese, and other hosts, including psittacines from South America and East Africa. Many to the generic level, only because of the morphologic distortion that rapidly occurs following death. If a bird has been dead for a few hours, it is still possible to produce slides by opening up the heart (usually the last area to clot) and scraping the blood clot with the edge of a microscope slide, which will release sufficient blood cells to make a reasonable thin smear. Without the back-up of blood smears it is often difficult to correlate tissue stages of parasites present on histopathology examination. The use of molecular techniques is becoming more frequent as an adjunct to morphologic diagnosis.\n\nPrevention and control of many blood parasites is difficult and in some cases is almost impossible. Parasites such as Babesia, Aegyptianella, and probably Hepatozoon can be controlled to some degree by eliminating tick vectors by use of safe acaricides. However, those parasites transmitted by flying insects, especially hemosporidia, are more difficult to control unless the birds are maintained in fly-proof cages or aviaries, which is both costly and inconvenient. An added problem is that this approach renders birds reared under such conditions as totally susceptible to infection if released into the wild as part of a captive breeding or rehabilitation program.\n\nNo specific recommendations for chemotherapy of infections have been included, for several reasons. First, there are few, if any, drugs licensed for use in exotic avian hosts. Many birds can react severely to certain drugs and the treatment often causes more problems than the disease itself. A misdiagnosis can result in the administration of a drug that has no effect on the disease present. In cases where drug therapy is deemed necessary, appropriate chemotherapy and dose rates are at the discretion of the veterinarian responsible.\n\nAs seen from available evidence, the more pathogenic parasites generally occur in domestic species, and treatment of whole flocks is usually undertaken with established prophylactics for specific disease entities. In birds exposed to infections not encountered in their normal host range, the resulting disease picture can be totally different. For example, penguins may die of Plasmodium infection without the detectable presence of any erythrocytic stages, because the damage is caused by exoerythrocytic schizonts in the tissues.\n\nThe majority of hemoparasites occurring in birds within their normal host range are usually benign and it is not exceptional to find infections with six or more different parasites in a single host without any signs of ill effect. Many parasites cause seasonal relapses, often associated with the onset of breeding in the avian host and an increase in vector availability. Such relapses in free-living birds do not appear to cause any significant problems. When such birds are suffering with other concomitant disease agents or are under stress, normally benign parasites may become pathogenic. These factors are particularly important in monitoring the disease status of endangered species as part of a captive breeding program and in pet or collection birds not bred in captivity.\n\nThe spectrum of blood parasites to which both domestic and freeliving birds can be exposed is wide and varied. Traditionally, textbooks of avian medicine have concentrated on the postmortem histopathology changes often associated with specific parasitic diseases and their prevention and treatment. The emphasis in this section has been to present pointers to differential diagnosis of the peripheral blood forms to aid in the correct identification and subsequent treatment when necessary. \u2022 The first group includes coccidia in which the entire life cycle is confined to the intestine i.e., the majority of Eimeria, Isospora, and Caryospora. \u2022 The second group contains species in which part of the life cycle (all or part of merogony) is located in various extraintestinal locations (some Eimeria and Sarcocystis species, Toxoplasma, and all Atoxoplasma; Fig. 14-161 ). Cryptosporidia may reproduce in epithelial cells lining gastrointestinal (GIT), urogenital, and/or respiratory tract (location depends on the parasite species). Sporulated coccidian oocysts differ in their size and morphology ( Fig.  14-162) . The detailed measurements, number of sporocysts and sporozoites per oocyst, together with their structural features have been used for decades for species determination. This is, however, seldom used in clinical practice. Currently with the advent of molecular analysis methods, many coccidia species can be specifically identified using polymerase chain reaction.\n\nAlthough coccidia are widespread among birds worldwide, the best-studied avian coccidia belong to Eimeria spp., which cause disease in poultry, generating very high financial losses to the industry each year (Figs. 14-163 and 14-164). Studies on poultry coccidiosis provide a wealth of information about the biology, pathology, immunity, and treatment of avian coccidiosis in general. Current methods of coccidiosis prevention in poultry includes use of highly advanced techniques such as subunit or in ovo vaccination with live attenuated vaccine against several economically important species of Eimeria.\n\nThe life cycle of typical intestinal monoxenous coccidia (i.e., Eimeria) can be divided into three steps: sporogony, schizogony, and gametogony. The average life cycle of intestinal coccidia takes about 7 days to complete and in contrast to other pathogens (bacteria, viruses), it has a selflimiting nature. There is no known cross-immunity between different species of coccidia, i.e., infection with one species of Eimeria does not protect against infection and diseases caused by another Eimeria spp.\n\nDistribution is worldwide. in the small intestine of the backyard chicken (Gallus domesticus). Black and white spots (plaques and petechiae) are associated with schizogony (second-generation schizonts). In this species, no oocysts but characteristic clusters of large schizonts will be found in the microscopic preparation of the mucosa scrapings from the small intestine.\n\nlocation and type of lesions. Gross lesions in affected small intestine and/or ceca may include: \u2022 Dilatation \u2022 Petechiation and hemorrhage \u2022 Discoloration \u2022 Formation of species-specific macroscopic lesions visible on mucosal or serosal surfaces of the small intestine and/or ceca (i.e., transversely arranged gross white plaques in duodenal mucosa-Eimeria acervulina or enlargement and distention of ceca with clotted blood in Eimeria tenella, in chickens). Very often there are mixed species infections with two or more coccidia species producing lesions in different locations along the GIT. \u2022 Excessive production of mucus, crust lesions, pseudomembranes, and cores (especially in ceca). \u2022 All abovementioned lesions may be complicated with other pathogens such as bacteria (especially anaerobic), yeasts, and protozoa. \u2022 Gross lesions in birds from clinical cases may be obvious, subtle, or virtually absent.\n\nRenal coccidiosis is seen in Sphenisciformes, Procellariiformes, Pelecaniformes, Anseriformes, and Apterygiformes. Depending on intensity of the infection, enlargement and discoloration of the kidneys with or without pale streaking and mottling and nodulation are seen.\n\nDisseminated coccidiosis is seen in wild and captive cranes, but not reported in Balearica spp. cranes.\n\n\u2022 Orange-white granulomas in various organs: trachea, esophagus, GIT, liver, heart, kidney, spleen, thymus, bursa, and others \u2022 Pneumonia \u2022 Congestion of lungs \u2022 Enteritis \u2022 Splenomegaly and hepatomegaly\n\nSarcocystis has wide variety of avian hosts (Fig. 14-165) . Intermediate hosts are especially pathogenic for Old World psittacines. \u2022 Lung congestion and edema \u2022 Hemorrhage \u2022 Enlargement of kidneys, liver, and spleen \u2022 Development of sarcocysts in skeletal muscles (\"rice breast disease\")\n\nToxoplasmosis has a wide variety of avian hosts (Figs. 14-166 and 14-167).\n\n\u2022 Pneumonia \u2022 Enlargement of liver and spleen often with pale foci throughout the parenchyma \u2022 Pericarditis and myocarditis \u2022 Ocular lesions (especially in canaries) \u2022 Enteritis, and in acute cases necrosis of the intestine and death \u2022 Encephalitis\n\nDiagnosis of coccidiosis relies on observation of clinical signs and finding oocysts and/or developmental stages together with gross and/ or microscopic lesions. In avian intestinal coccidial diseases the diagnostic tools include: \u2022 Fecal examination for the presence of oocysts (direct or concentrated). Especially in passerines, feces for examination should be pooled from evening and night because of increased oocyst \n\nAtoxoplasmosis is a protozoal disease of certain passerine birds caused by a coccidian parasite belonging to the genus Isospora. Atoxoplasma is now considered a junior synonym, but it will be used in this section to ease comprehension and for the benefit of the reader.\n\nSynonyms include visceral coccidiosis, thick liver disease, big liver disease, black spot disease, and going light. The last two names are often used as synonyms of circovirosis and infection with Macrorhabdus ornithogaster, respectively, leading to much confusion among fanciers and breeders.\n\n\u2022 Coccidian parasite Atoxoplasma is an etiologic agent. \u2022 Atoxoplasms possess a simple life cycle in which part of the asexual (two schizogonies) and entire sexual phase (gametogony and oocyst production) takes place in the small intestine, while the majority of asexual reproduction (five schizogonies) occurs in the mononuclear cells in various extraintestinal locations, i.e., lungs, liver, spleen, and brain. \u2022 Ingested infective oocysts release sporozoites that penetrate the intestinal mucosa and leave the intestine by means of mononuclear cells, in which they undergo few rounds of asexual reproduction outside the intestine. Merozoites finally migrate back to the intestine to complete their asexual development and go through the sexual phase, which will terminate in the production of unsporulated oocysts. These are shed in feces in relatively low numbers (100 to 200 every 24 hours, in contrast to intestinal species of coccidia), and sporulate in the environment.\n\nDistribution is worldwide, except Antarctica.\n\nSusceptible species include passerines, especially in the families Fringillidae and Sturnidae. Canaries, European finches, starlings, and mynahs most commonly present with clinical atoxoplasmosis. It is believed that atoxoplasms possess a high level of host specificity (i.e., Isospora serini infecting only canaries). According to some publications, intraleukocytic stages (merozoites) of Atoxoplasma spp. have been found in at least 58 bird families.\n\n\u2022 Weight loss \u2022 Respiratory distress with or without respiratory sounds (rales, clicking sounds, and whistling) \u2022 Hepatomegaly, visible through the abdominal wall (Fig. 14-168) shedding at roosting time, which favors transmission of the parasite between birds. \u2022 Direct examination of intestinal mucosa scrapings for the presence of developmental stages (schizonts, merozoites, and oocysts). \u2022 Cytology, histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and molecular methods. Standard identification of coccidia species requires sporulation of the oocysts (sporulation time is an important feature), and detailed analysis of their morphologic characters such as size and shape of oocyst and sporocysts (length and width), oocyst color, number of sporocysts and sporozoites, and their detailed morphologic characters (presence or absence of Stieda body, residuum, micropyle cap, polar bodies, etc.). Today it is often replaced by the use of molecular methods. Other coccidial diseases in which the development forms of the parasite are located in various visceral organs and cryptosporidia often require cytology, histopathology, immunohistochemistry, or other methods (serologic and/or molecular) for diagnosis.\n\nInfectious forms of avian coccidia are ingested orally.\n\nTreatment of coccidial diseases often requires combining the medical treatment, revision of the management system, and thorough disinfection. Coccidia tend to thrive in young and immunologically naive individuals kept in overcrowded and wet conditions with high infective pressure from the environment. Taking care to provide the birds with a dry and clean environment (i.e., use of the grid floor) where they cannot contact large numbers of infective oocysts substantially lowers the risk of developing the clinical coccidiosis and other stress-and density-related diseases.\n\nSubstances used to combat coccidiosis can be divided into two major groups: coccidiocidals and coccidiostats, which kill and suppress the development of parasite, respectively.\n\nThe commonly used drugs include: \u2022 Sulfonamides and trimethoprim potentiated sulfonamides: They have a coccidiostatic effect by inhibiting the synthesis of folic acid. \u2022 Triazines i.e., toltrazuril: This realizes a coccidiocidal effect by disruption of nuclear division and functioning of mitochondria. \u2022 Amprolium (coccidiostat): A thiamine antagonist used alone or in combination with folate antagonists, i.e., ethopabate. \u2022 Coccidiostats less commonly used outside poultry:\n\n\u2022 Synthetic coccidiostats, i.e., robenidine, decoquinate, and nicarbazin \u2022 Ionophore coccidiostats (altering levels and transport of cations Na + , K + , Ca 2+ , and Mg 2+ in and out of the parasite cells), i.e., salinomycin, monensin, narasin, maduramycin, semduramicin, and lasalocid. Coccidia differ in their productivity from low to very high. Ingestion of one sporulated oocyst may result in the production of several thousand up to several millions of next-generation oocysts. This clearly shows the necessity of appropriate disinfection during and after the outbreak of the disease to reduce the infective pressure from the environment where under appropriate conditions oocysts can survive several months. There are very few toxic substances used for killing oocysts in the environment and these include ammonia water or formaldehyde fumes, and wet flaming (flaming previously wetted surfaces) is probably still the method of choice as it gives the best results.\n\n\u2022 Sound hygiene practices including maintaining clean, dry environment with proper ventilation.\n\n\u2022 The intestines, mostly duodenum and proximal jejunum, are often dilated with thickened walls and marked hemorrhages visible on the serosal surface ( Fig. 14-170 ). \u2022 Lungs and bronchi are grossly unaffected even in the presence of clinical respiratory signs. \u2022 Skeletal muscles and myocardium may be also affected.\n\n\u2022 A tentative diagnosis can be made on the basis of anamnesis; however, definite diagnosis can only be made by finding Atoxoplasma merozoites in the cytoplasm of leukocytes from blood or internal organs, which requires the use of cytology or histopathology. \u2022 In air-dried, Romanowsky-stained (Diff-Quik or Hemacolor) cytologic preparations of lung, liver, and spleen impressions or buffy coat smears of atoxoplasm, merozoites are fairly large (often exceeding the size of red blood cell nuclei) inclusions found in the cytoplasm of mononuclear cells. These inclusions are whitish colored, ovoid structures with a diffuse pink or purple center, and often displace the nucleus of a host cell or mold it into a crescent shape. Merozoites may occur single or in clusters (meronts), contrasting well with the blue cytoplasm of their host cells (Fig. 14-171 ). \u2022 Finding unsporulated coccidian oocysts in fresh feces is not diagnostic for Atoxoplasma spp., even in the presence of suggestive clinical signs. Also examination of oocyst morphology for identification of parasite genus or species is impractical in clinical conditions. \u2022 There are available molecular methods for detection of Atoxoplasma spp. in clinical samples.\n\nTransmission is through the fecal-oral route. To become infected, susceptible hosts need to ingest infective sporulated oocysts.\n\nDifferent anticoccidials have been used in the treatment of atoxoplasmosis with varying results. Intraleukocytic stages are generally considered nonresponsive to treatment; however, long use of sulfonamides (5 days a week for several months) and/or toltrazuril (2 days a week for several months) suppress oocyst shedding and aid in control of the disease at least by lowering the infective pressure from the environment.\n\n\u2022 Central nervous signs (up to 20% of affected birds): loss of balance, seizures, circling, nystagmus \u2022 Enteritis (enlarged abdomen with dilated intestines, often red colored) \u2022 Diarrhea \u2022 Mortality (up to 80%), especially in young birds during stressful periods i.e., weaning and molting, sometimes acute deaths without premonitory signs. \u2022 Many susceptible hosts necropsied for other reasons often show a few Atoxoplasma spp. merozoites in leukocytes mostly from lung imprints, which suggest that there is a high rate of asymptomatic infections and latency in healthy-looking birds from all age groups.\n\n\u2022 The majority of necropsied birds from atoxoplasmosis cases show hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and enteritis. The liver may be enlarged to various extent, sometimes with necrotic foci throughout the parenchyma, and the spleen may be severely enlarged (Fig. 14-169) . \n\nTrichomonosis is caused by the parasitic flagellate Trichomonas gallinae.\n\nSynonyms include canker, roup, and frounce (in raptors). The term trichomonosis refers to a clinical form of the disease, whereas trichomoniasis depicts a carrier stage in which no signs of the disease can be recognized.\n\nTrichomonas gallinae are small, 5 to 20 \u00b5m size, oval to pea-shaped flagellates with four free, anteriorly placed flagella, axostyle protruding from the posterior end, and an undulating membrane. \n\nDistribution is all over the world except Antarctica, Greenland, and the northern parts of North America, Europe, and Asia.\n\nSusceptible species include birds in orders: Columbiformes, Falconiformes, Psittaciformes, Passeriformes, Galliformes, Anseriformes, and Gruiformes. Color canaries, suffering from hypervitaminosis A, often caused by massive administration of coloration, are extremely sensitive (Fig. 14-172) . \n\n\u2022 Clinical symptoms vary widely and may include unspecific signs such as weight loss, listlessness, and ruffled and matted feathers. \u2022 Signs suggestive of trichomonosis, especially in susceptible hosts, may include deaths and poor growth of nestlings; stasis; delayed emptying time and foul-smelling crop contents; excessive salivation; problems with swallowing; regurgitation; diarrhea; palpable or visible caseous lesions in the oral cavity, bursa of Fabricius, and umbilicus; swelling of sinuses and facial region; respiratory rales; dyspnea; conjunctivitis; and death of severely affected individuals.\n\n\u2022 These vary depending on the virulence of the trichomonad strain and susceptibility of the host and may range from mild to severe catarrhal inflammation of the oral cavity, throat, and the crop mucosa to ulcerative and caseous lesions of various extent in the upper digestive tract (mouth, throat, crop, and thoracic esophagealproventriculus junction; Fig. 14-173) , upper respiratory tract, and \u2022 In susceptible species and in problematic collections regular health checks and cleanups with appropriate medication may help control the disease.\n\nAscaridiosis is caused by parasitic nematodes of the genus Ascaridia.\n\nSynonyms include ascaridiosis and ascarosis.\n\nAscaridia spp. (approximately 40 species have been reported in birds) are one of the most common nematodes in birds. They are large (16 to 120 mm), thick yellowish-white worms parasitizing the small intestine and sometimes the ceca of susceptible hosts. Females are often larger than males. Ascarids have a simple, direct life cycle. Nonembryonated, elliptical thick-walled single-cell eggs with fine granular brownish contents and colorless shell (approximately 80 \u00d7 50 \u00b5m) are shed in feces and embryonate in the environment with appropriate humidity and temperature in 2 to 3 weeks. Infective eggs hatch in the proventriculus or duodenum of the susceptible host releasing second-stage larvae that will invade small intestine mucosa where they molt to L3. Depending on the species and host, larvae either return to the intestinal lumen where they molt and mature into adult worms or they may arrest their development at certain stage (i.e., L3) to become the predominant form of the parasite and become its reservoir throughout the life of the host. Ascarids may use transport or paratenic hosts, such as earthworms or grasshoppers, but they do not develop or accumulate in them.\n\nDistribution is in all continents, except Antarctica.\n\nAscarids have been reported in 139 host species in orders Struthioniformes, Tinamiformes, Ciconiiformes, Anseriformes, Falconiformes, Galliformes, Gruiformes, Columbiformes, Psittaciformes, Cuculiformes, Strigiformes, Caprimulgiformes, and Passeriformes. Ascarid species vary widely in their host specificity and distribution from cosmopolitan to restricted to certain geographic region and host species. Young birds are more susceptible to infection than adults, which develop some resistance and immunity.\n\n\u2022 Suggestive for Ascaridia is weight loss, emaciation, matted feathers, slimy green feces, and vomiting. \u2022 Nonspecific symptoms include weakness, anemia, diarrhea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, growth retardation, soiled vent, lameness and leg paralysis, and sudden deaths.\n\n\u2022 Ascarids inhabit the small intestine, in particular the duodenal loop, but can be found in the esophagus, crop, gizzard, body cavity, liver, bile and pancreatic ducts, oviduct, and egg. \u2022 Adult nematodes and their larvae irritate the intestinal mucosa, which may result in edema, hyperemia, hemorrhage, destruction of villi, dilatation of crypts, and nodulation. Heavy infections may cause intestine occlusion, intussusception, or perforation ( Fig. 14-175 ). \u2022 Ectopic migration of larvae through intestinal wall, liver, lung, and mesenteries may provoke intensive leukocyte infiltration around larvae and elicit granulomatous lesions (Figs. 14-176 and 14-177).\n\nhead (sinuses, skull, skin of the neck, and trachea). In very virulent strains the liver, lungs (Fig. 14-174) , pericardium, air sacs, and pancreas are affected. \u2022 Especially in young pigeons, white cheesy masses can be found in the umbilicus and bursa of Fabricius. \u2022 Trichomonosis can mimic various diseases of which the most important in differential diagnosis are candidiasis, capillariidosis, pox, herpesvirus infections in pigeons and raptors, and vitamin A deficiency. All listed differentials are often complicated by trichomonads alone or together with bacteria and yeasts.\n\n\u2022 Finding characteristic motile trophozoites in fresh wet preparations of crop contents and swabs taken from the oral cavity, conjunctivae, and cloaca, observed under light microscopy (100\u00d7 or 400\u00d7 magnification). \u2022 When direct microscopic examination of fresh samples cannot be performed or when fresh sample lacks motile trophozoites, diagnostic methods may include cytology, histopathology, molecular diagnosis, and culturing of the organism.\n\nTrichomonads may be transmitted directly via crop milk and saliva through billing and courtship feeding and via drinking water, moist grain (able to survive several days), and feces (especially in \"wet nests\").\n\nVarious drugs from the nitroimidazole family, ronidazole, and metronidazole are most commonly used. Advanced lesions often need to be treated surgically together with appropriate chemotherapy.\n\n\u2022 Identification and treatment of carrier birds, cleaning and regular disinfection of drinkers and drinking water; wild birds should have no access to water, feed, and birds in the collection. \u2022 In case of raptors, prevention is through feeding deep-frozen, cleaned, or parasite-free pigeons (trichomonads are able to survive 48 hours in pigeon carcass). \n\nDirect ingestion of embryonated eggs, larvae, or transport/paratenic hosts carrying infective eggs.\n\nBenzimidazole anthelmintics, levamisole, ivermectin, moxidectin, pyrantel pamoate, and others, followed by vitamin A supplementation and thorough sanitation.\n\nInfection requires ingestion of embryonated eggs or larvae; therefore, successful treatment should combine expelling the adult worms from the intestine and destruction of eggs in the environment or disrupting the cycle by prevention of birds contacting infective eggs by use of grid floors or providing a dry and clean environment. Ascarid eggs are resistant to many commonly used disinfectants; steam cleaning or flaming are the most effective disinfecting methods.\n\nCapillariidosis is caused by nematodes belonging to the genera Baruscapillaria, Capillaria, Echinocoleus, Eucoleus, Ornithocapillaria, Pterothominx, and Tridentocapillaria, collectively named as Capillarids.\n\nSynonyms include capillariidosis, capillariosis, cropworm, hairworm, threadworm, and wireworm.\n\nAvian capillarids are a heterogeneous group of nematodes belonging to seven genera, all in the family Trichuridae, subfamily Capillarinae. Their taxonomy is complicated and often leads to confusion, with single species often listed under various names, synonyms, or arranged into a complex of species under one name. Capillarids are small, 8 to 60 mm long, and thin (less than 100 \u00b5m wide) nematodes burying in the mucosa of the GIT. They are almost impossible to see with the naked eye (thus the name hairworm). Freshly passed, unembryonated eggs are characteristically double operculated with distinctive, big plugs at both ends ( Fig. 14-178 ). Ova may be symmetric or asymmetric (long axis through one plug not meeting opposite plug). They, are single cell with fine granular contents, various patterns of shell and coloration (colorless, golden brown, and bile green), measuring on average 55 \u00d7 25 \u00b5m. Egg morphology is not sufficient for identification of genus or species of the parasite. Different species inhabit various segments of the avian GIT, from the oral cavity to the distal small intestine and less often the ceca. Mixed infections are not rare, with one host infected with several species parasitizing at different locations. Capillarids may have direct or indirect life cycles. \u2022 In species with a direct life cycle (homoxenous), unembryonated eggs voided with feces embryonate under favorable conditions in the environment (Eucoleus contortus: 24 to 40 days, Baruscapillaria obsignata: 3 to 13 days), and after reaching L1 stage they become infective to the susceptible avian hosts. Ingested infective eggs hatch in the GIT of the bird and liberated larvae undergo further central nervous system signs. Capillariosis often presents in three forms: oropharyngeal, esophageal, and intestinal.\n\n\u2022 Signs suggestive of oropharyngeal capillariosis include mucoidstringy deposits, yellowish-white plaques, granulomas, and abscesses in the pharynx, tongue, and rictus. \u2022 Esophageal form includes palpable masses in the esophagus and crop, problems with swallowing and contractility of the crop. \u2022 Very sticky, scant, and dark green feces, sometimes containing blood, are suggestive for the intestinal form of capillariosis. Heavy infections result in poor digestion and absorption.\n\nCapillarids inhabit various parts of the avian GIT. Eucoleus annulatus and E. contortus live in the mucosa of oral cavity and crop, Baruscapillaria obsignata, Pterothominx caudinflata, P. bursata in small intestine , and Capillaria anatis and Baruscapillaria obsignata in the ceca. They burrow tunnels in the mucosa and sometimes submucosa, where gravid females lay eggs, which are shed into the gut lumen together with sloughed epithelium. Upper gastrointestinal capillarids are considered more pathogenic than intestinal-dwelling species. They may cause inflammation, exudation, ulceration, hyperkeratosis, and thickening of the mucosa from the oral cavity to the proventriculus, dilatation of the crop, and squamous metaplasia of mucous gland in the esophagus. Secondary bacterial or fungal colonization are common and lead to complicated lesions in the form of fibrinonecrotic plaques, diphtheritic membranes, and large caseous masses, sometimes involving underlying bones. In severe cases parasites may penetrate into the muscularis. Intestinal species cause thickening, erosions, and ulceration of intestinal mucosa. Severity of lesions varies according to parasite species and intensity of infection. Lesions may be more severe in aberrant hosts.\n\nDiagnosis is made after finding and identifying adult worms and/or their eggs.\n\nTransmission occurs in monoxenic species by direct ingestion of embryonated eggs or paratenic hosts carrying infective eggs. In In some, larvae are infective already after hatching in the earthworm intestine; in others they require further development. Depending on the capillarid species, birds become infected by ingestion of infective eggs, free or carried by paratenic hosts (direct life cycle) or obligate intermediate hosts (complex life cycle) carrying infective eggs or larvae. In some capillarids, rodents are suspected to serve as transport hosts (Baruscapillaria falconis and Capillaria tenuissima). Among avian capillarids one species P. philippinensis is zoonotic.\n\nDistribution is worldwide.\n\nCapillarids have been reported in orders Struthioniformes, Tinamiformes, Gaviiformes, Podicipediformes, Pelecaniformes, Ciconiiformes, Anseriformes, Falconiformes, Galliformes, Gruiformes, Charadriiformes, Columbiformes, Psittaciformes, Strigiformes, Caprimulgiformes, Apodiformes, Piciformes, and Passeriformes. Some capillarid species such as Eucoleus contortus are known to infect a wide variety of avian hosts from at least nine orders, whereas some species infect only a single host, i.e., Pterothominx moraveci is found only in Port Lincoln Parrots (Barnardius zonarius).\n\nClinical symptoms vary according to the intensity of infection, parasite species, and susceptibility of the host. Some affected birds may show no or minimal clinical signs. Nonspecific clinical signs include poor performance, weight loss, anemia, diarrhea, ruffled feathers, and Birds may contract an infection in different ways: \u2022 Directly by ingesting embryonated infective eggs and free-living infective larvae \u2022 Indirectly by eating paratenic host containing encysted or free larvae When ingested by a suitable host, the infective eggs hatch in the small intestine and penetrate its wall. The majority of larvae are transported to the lungs, most likely via the portal blood, but some also migrate directly through the tissues. The larvae reach the lungs as early as 4 hours after infection. Worms can be detected in the lungs in 7 days, in the trachea at 11 days, and fertile females can be found at 14 days post infection. The life cycle is simple, direct, or indirect.\n\nSyngamus spp. has been reported in Europe, Asia, and North America, but its range may be worldwide.\n\nSusceptible species are primarily birds that feed on the ground, most commonly Galliformes and Passeriformes. Prevalence varies greatly by host species and age. Adult birds have generally less intensive infections, and in some occasions are able to expel the worms. Young birds of susceptible species may virtually perish.\n\n\u2022 Suggestive symptoms for syngamosis in highly susceptible hosts (i.e., gamebirds, peacocks, corvids) include gasping for air, coughing, head shaking, stretching neck, open mouth breathing, and producing grunting sounds. \u2022 Nonspecific signs include weakness, weight loss, and emaciation often together with respiratory distress. Heavily affected birds eventually die of suffocation.\n\n\u2022 Worms attach to the mucosal lining of the trachea and bronchi causing their inflammation through mechanical damage, irritation, and possibly parasite secretions. Male worms are attached permanently to the mucosa or tracheal ring cartilage, which in certain species (especially turkeys and pheasants) may cause nodulation on the internal and external surface of the trachea. \u2022 In seriously affected birds, worms can block the tracheal lumen causing suffocation (Fig. 14-181 ). \u2022 Pneumonia in young birds is the result of host response to migration of larvae through lungs (Fig. 14-182 ). \u2022 Adult gapeworms feed on blood, but the overall loss of blood caused by their parasitism is minimal.\n\n\u2022 Finding and identifying adult worms in the trachea and bronchi, endoscopically or during necropsy \u2022 By transillumination of the trachea (Fig. 14-183) \u2022 Clinical symptoms and finding characteristic eggs in feces and/or in the mouth cavity\n\nDirect ingestion of infective eggs, free-living infective larvae, or transport/paratenic hosts carrying encysted or free larvae.\n\nGapeworm infections can be treated by various anthelmintics with fenbendazole, flubendazole, and ivermectin are most commonly used. During and after treatment birds can show severe respiratory symptoms because the tracheal worms have to be coughed out. \n\nSee Ascaridiosis.\n\nSyngamosis is caused by the parasitic nematode Syngamus spp.\n\nSynonyms include syngamiasis, gapeworm, gapes, redworm, tracheal worm, and forked worm.\n\nSyngamus spp. are strongylid nematodes infecting the respiratory tract of susceptible avian hosts. Adult S. trachea are bright red worms locked in copula in a characteristic Y shape ( Fig. 14-180 ). Females are much larger than males measuring 5 to 40 mm and 2 to 6 mm in length, respectively. Small males are permanently affixed to the tracheal mucosa, whereas females attached permanently to males but not to trachea are able to attach and detach to feed at different locations around the anchoring site of their male. Adult females lay eggs into the tracheal lumen, which are then coughed up, swallowed, and passed in feces to embryonate in the environment. Eggs are bipolar, ellipsoidal, and double operculated. They are 90 \u00d7 50 \u00b5m in size, with a smooth thin shell containing eight cell morula, when passed freshly. Optimal temperature for development of S. trachea eggs is 29 \u00b0 C. Under these conditions it takes only 7 days for the larva to develop inside the egg into the infective third stage. The development of eggs does not take place in temperatures at or below 16\u00b0 C, and at 17\u00b0 C the eggs will become infective in 42 days. Infective larvae (L3) may hatch spontaneously and live free in wet soil for some time. \n\nLarvae encysted in the earthworms may remain infective for 4.5 years; therefore control of infections must rely on reduction of infected paratenic hosts in the bird's environment by destroying earthworms, snails, and other transport hosts that transfer the parasite or by alternating the rearing pens. Gapeworms are most dangerous to young birds, therefore, susceptible species in problematic areas should be regularly dewormed in 2-to 4-week intervals, especially during hot months.\n\nInfestation of birds with the northern mite Ornithonyssus sylviarum or the red mite Dermanyssus gallinae.\n\nFor O. sylviarum they include northern mite, white mite, and northern fowl mite. For D. gallinae: they include red mite, chicken mite, poultry mite, and roost mite.\n\n\u2022 Northern mite (O. sylviarum, Family: Macronyssidae) is a common ectoparasite of cage birds and poultry. Northern mites are dark colored (red to black), flattened eight-legged (nymphs and adults) parasitic arthropods, approximately 0.7 to 1 mm in length and 0.4 mm in width. They spend the entire life cycle on their avian hosts (c.f., red mite). Five developmental stages have been described: egg, larva, protonymph, deuteronymph, and adult. Only protonymphs and adults are hematophagous. The life cycle (from egg to egg-laying female) can be completed in 5 to 7 days under favorable conditions (18 to 20\u00b0 C; northern mites prefer lower temperatures than red mites). Adult females lay two to five eggs at the base of feathers (especially in the vent or back) about 2 days after feeding on blood. Birds are the only suitable hosts for northern mites, but parasites can bite and parasitize (but not reproduce) on other animals and humans. Depending on the source, northern mites are reported to stay alive in the environment, outside their host, for several days up to 2 months. \u2022 Red mites (D. gallinae, Family: Dermanyssidae) are small (1 mm length, 0.4 mm width), whitish-gray colored mites that turn red when engorged with blood. The main difference in clinical importance between northern and red mites is that the latter enter birds only for feeding during the night, while the rest of their life cycle takes place outside the host (it is considered a temporary parasite). The white (0.4 \u00d7 0.25 mm) eggs are laid in hiding places including all kinds of nooks and crannies in aviaries and cages, nests, and nesting material but also dry manure and litter. Depending on the temperature and humidity (red mites prefer temperatures of 25\u00b0 C or more and high humidity) eggs hatch in 2 to 3 days. Developmental stages are the same as in the northern mite, and the life cycle may be completed in 7 to 10 days. Protonymphs, deuteronymphs, and adults are hematophagous. The mites feed for about 60 minutes every 2 to 4 days. The majority are active and feed after dark, but some may remain on the host during the daytime. Red mites enter birds from perches but they may also drop from the ceiling. They are attracted to birds because of their high temperature and skin lipids.\n\nDistribution is worldwide. Parasitic Diseases Diagnosis \u2022 Northern mite: Includes finding dark colored mites, mite debris (shed skins, dried blood, and mite feces), and masses of eggs (attached to the base of feathers, especially on vent and rump) on live or dead birds. In passerine birds the neck apterium is a particularly useful site to examine for the presence of northern mites. In poultry, the best site is the vent area. Sometimes eggs can be found on the base of the feathers (Fig. 14-186) . The tape strip method can be very useful to detect the parasites on a living bird (Fig. 14-187 ). \u2022 Red mite: Includes finding red-colored mites (red when gorged with blood, white when fastened) during the nighttime on birds and during daytime in hiding places. Red mites are often found accidentally by finding smudges of blood on the underside of perches or furnishing from accidentally crushed parasites when exposed during cleaning (especially detaching perches, feeders, etc.). When facing anemia, respiratory distress, and deaths, especially in nestlings, even without visible presence of parasites on birds, red mites should always be considered as possible culprits. \u2022 Mites (northern and red), their excrements, and dried blood can be found in the nesting material and under the nests. Nestlings may\n\nAll species of birds are susceptible. \n\n\u2022 Birds affected with bloodsucking mites often show anemia (a high number of red mites can drink up to 6% of blood volume a day; data from chickens) and poor body condition. \u2022 Apart from the presence of adult mites and/or their eggs on the plumage of living or dead birds (Figs. 14-184 and 14-185), sometimes it is possible to find pinprick size bites on the skin (especially under the wings and on the bare skin of nestlings). \u2022 Mites and their eggs can sometimes be found during postmortem examination in the crop or in the intestine contents, but also during standard microscopic fecal examination. \u2022 Bloodsucking mites are successfully transmitting several infectious diseases (several arboviruses, fowlpox, Salmonella enteritidis, Pasteurella multocida, Coxiella burnetii, and Borrelia anserina). \n\nshow pinprick bites with dried blood, especially under the wings. Some breeders cover the cages with white cloth at night and examine it in the morning for the presence of hidden red mites.\n\nTransmission is direct, from bird to bird, by active movement of mites between cages and closely situated aviaries, through fomites but also people, rodents, and wild birds. During heavy infestation the mites can be found everywhere in the aviary (on birds and in their surroundings) and will readily crawl on humans, causing considerable itching. There may be literally an explosion of mites, when in a few days their number can rise into tens of thousands. With red mites this takes place in hot weather conditions (when their eggs hatch in 2 to 3 days). With northern mites predisposing factors include stressful conditions, with a large number of birds grouped in a small area, such as during shows or exhibitions.\n\nIt is important to acknowledge that the entire life cycle of the northern mite takes place on the host, whether red mites reproduce in the environment, and enter their hosts only for feeding at night (they are photophobic). Northern mites are reported to be able to survive up to 2 months outside their hosts, whereas red mites can survive up to 8 months in their hiding places. Most of the mites will die fast if they are devoid of hiding places that protect them from direct sunlight and in conditions with low humidity (less than 35%). Treatment of mite infestation should always include both birds and their environment, should be performed scrupulously (it may be necessary to get rid of all furnishings), and often repeatedly to kill larvae and nymphs from recently hatched eggs (which are not affected by chemicals).\n\nDrugs used for treating the birds can be delivered parenterally (intramuscularly and subcutaneously), as a spot-on, dusting, or spraying. A force bath can be added to the drinking or bath water. Drugs include amitraz, avermectins (doramectin, ivermectin, Moxidectin), carbaryl, coumaphos, malathion, phoxim, pyrethroids spinosad, or tetrachlorvinphos. For detailed information on dosages and route of administration of specific substances please consult the formulary in Appendix 6.\n\nMites can develop resistance against used chemicals. Sulfur, diatomaceous earth, and synthetic amorphous silicas have been used for treatment of mite infestations with good results without development of resistance (different mode of action-causing desiccation of mites through destroying a waxy cuticle).\n\n\u2022 Prophylactic use of acaricides in the environment and on birds, especially before the breeding season \u2022 Inspection and prophylactic treatment of new birds entering the collection \u2022 Control of mite vectors (infected birds, wild birds, rodents, material, etc.) \u2022 Regular examination of birds for the presence of mites."}
