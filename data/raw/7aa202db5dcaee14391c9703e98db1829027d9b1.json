{"title": "Equilibrium Unfolding Pathway of an H-type RNA Pseudoknot which Promotes Programmed \u00c01 Ribosomal Frameshifting", "body": "Our understanding of the role of RNA in biological systems has continued to expand as more catalytic RNAs, RNA structural motifs, and noncanonical interactions have been discovered and characterized (for a review, see Conn & Draper, 1998) . It has become clear that mRNAs contain secondary and tertiary structures both in the coding and non-coding regions and that these interactions are critical to regulation of translation in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems. mRNA structures can regulate translation during initiation, elongation, and termination or by affecting the rate of mRNA degradation. Regulation of translation initiation has been observed when proteins interact with 5 H untranslated region (UTR) mRNA structures: for example, a hairpin in the case of the iron-responsive element (IRE) on the ferritin mRNA and an RNA pseudoknot in the case of the Escherichia coli a operon (Tang & Draper, 1990) . Hairpins and pseudoknots have also been implicated in ribosomal frameshifting and hopping during elongation, stop codon readthrough at termination and regulation of mRNA degradation (for a review, see .\n\nRNA pseudoknots are simple tertiary structures composed of single-stranded loop regions and helical stems. The H-type or hairpin-type pseudoknot consists of a hairpin that forms the 5 H helical stem of the pseudoknot and the \u00aerst loop of the pseudoknot. This is followed by a single-stranded region which forms the second loop of the pseudoknot and a region complementary to part of the hairpin loop sequence, forming the second helical stem of the pseudoknot (Figure 1 ). The lengths of the loops and stems vary, with certain minimal loop lengths required to span speci\u00aec helical stem lengths (Pleij et al., 1985; Wyatt et al., 1990) . The helical stems can be coaxially stacked Holland et al., 1999) or bent Su et al., 1999) with respect to one another.\n\nRibosomal frameshifting occurs when a translating ribosome changes reading frame at a speci\u00aec site in an mRNA causing the synthesis of an altered protein product. Frameshifting can occur in either direction to the \u00c01, \u00c02, or 1 frames (Matsufuji et al., 1996; Farabaugh, 1996) . The \u00c01 ribosomal frameshifting is a common mechanism used by RNA viruses to regulate the synthesis level of certain proteins and to ensure packaging of pol and pro gene products by expressing them as fusion proteins with the gag gene capsid protein.\n\nThe frequency at which frameshifting occurs is variable, from 1-5 % in some plant viruses up to 50 % in the dnaX frameshift site of E. coli (Larsen et al., 1997) with typical retroviral ef\u00aeciencies between 15 and 30 % (Brierly, 1995) . The \u00c01 ribosomal frameshift site is typically composed of a heptameric nucleotide sequence X XXY YYZ in the zero coding frame. The identities of the nucleotides vary in different sites and between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The primary sequence requirement appears to be that at least two of the three mRNA codon-tRNA anticodon base-pairing interactions can be maintained in the new frame (XXX YYY Z). The simultaneous slippage model was proposed to describe the mechanism of \u00c01 ribosomal frameshifting from studies of the gag-pol junction frameshift site in Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) (Jacks et al., 1988) . In this model, both the A and P sites of the ribosome contain tRNAs and the frameshift occurs when both the A and P-site tRNAs slip into the \u00c01 frame on the slip site heptamer. Sites with high frameshifting ef\u00aeciencies typically have mRNA structures required for maintaining high ef\u00aeciency located three to nine nucleotides downstream of the slippery heptamer. In many, though not all cases, the structural element downstream of the slippery site is proposed to form an H-type RNA pseudoknot. One explanation is that these RNA structures simply slow or stall the ribosome temporarily, increasing the amount of time the ribosome spends on the slippery sequence, and (Fehrmann et al., 1997) . The slip site heptamer is enclosed in a box and the pseudoknot structural elements are annotated. The structure of this pseudoknot has yet to be determined. The adenosine at the junction (A15), shown unpaired in this model, may be paired with the \u00aenal uridine in loop 2 (U31) and it is not clear which of the two adenosine bases (A35 and A36) in stem 2 is paired with U11. (b) Mutations incorporated in the mIAP pseudoknot sequence. The double mutant, \u00c1A35A15 RNA, is indicated by the open circles. thereby increasing the probability of a frameshifting event.\n\nRibosomal pausing mediated by RNA structure has been observed for the pseudoknots in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae virus (ScV) at the cap-pol junction (Tu et al., 1992) and also in the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) at the 1a-1b junction (Somogyi et al., 1993) . In ScV, ribosomal pausing was assayed using``heelprinting'' to locate regions of the mRNA protected from nuclease digestion in the presence of translating ribosomes. Ribosomal pausing was monitored at the IBV frameshift site by examining the size and distribution of incomplete polypeptide intermediates generated from initiation-synchronized in vitro translation over time. Pausing was shown to correlate well with frameshift ef\u00aeciency but both studies observed structures with normal pausing but no detectable frameshifting. This suggests that ribosomal pausing is necessary, but not suf\u00aecient, for frameshifting. In addition, thermodynamic stability of the RNA structure alone apparently cannot account for frameshifting ef\u00aeciency at the ScV and IBV frameshift sites, although this point has not been thoroughly investigated.\n\nStructurally, the most well-characterized frameshifting pseudoknot occurs at the gag-pro frameshift site in mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV). This pseudoknot has been subjected to mutational analysis and structure probing (Chamorro et al., 1992; Chen et al., 1995) and the solution structure has been solved by NMR . In addition, the structures of frameshifting and non-frameshifting variants have also been determined (Chen et al., 1996; Kang et al., 1996; Kang & Tinoco, 1997) . Frameshifting ef\u00aeciency in these MMTV pseudoknot derivatives was found to correlate with a speci\u00aecally bent conformation, where the two helical stems were prevented from coaxially stacking by a single unpaired adenosine at the helical junction. An extensive mutational study was also performed on the pseudoknot at the gag-pro frameshift site in simian retrovirus 1 (SRV-1) (ten Dam et al., 1995) . The frameshifting ef\u00aeciency of base-pair substitutions in the second stem of the pseudoknot correlated qualitatively with the predicted thermodynamic stability of that stem. NMR evidence suggests that the closing A-U base-pair in stem 2 at the helical junction is formed while mutational analysis suggests that the identity of the two nucleotides and their ability to base-pair have no affect on frameshifting ef\u00aeciency (Chen et al.,1996; Sung & Kang, 1998) , prompting these authors to hypothesize that the SRV-1 pseudoknot is also bent, like in MMTV.\n\nThese studies reveal that a detailed investigation of a number of closely related frameshifting pseudoknots will be required to map the general determinants of frameshifting ef\u00aeciency. Here, we have examined the thermodynamic stability of the pseudoknot which promotes ef\u00aecient \u00c01 frameshifting from the gag-pro frameshift site of mouse intracis-ternal A-type particles (mIAP) (Fehrmann et al., 1997) . The proposed pseudoknot shares some similarities with the SRV-1 and MMTV pseudoknots, including potential structural ambiguity at the junction of the two helical stems in which A15 may or may not base-pair with U31 in loop 2 (Figure 1(a) ). mIAP is an endogenous mouse retrovirus which phylogenetic analysis of the nucleic acid and amino acid sequences of the pol gene reveals is a member of a closely related subclass of retroviruses that includes both SRV-1 and MMTV (Li et al., 1995) . Study of mIAP will therefore allow us to examine the general structural and stability features of this group of retroviral frameshifting pseudoknots.\n\nIn order to de\u00aene the thermodynamics of unfolding for the mIAP frameshifting pseudoknot, the compensatory base-pair substitution and deletion mutants shown in Figure 1 (b) were prepared and subjected to thermal denaturation. Unless otherwise indicated, all thermal melts were collected in 50 mM monovalent K and no added divalent cation, so that the complete melting pro-\u00aele could be obtained in the accessible temperature range (5-120 C).\n\nOptical melting profiles of the wild-type mIAP pseudoknot and stem 1 hairpins\n\nThe optical melting pro\u00aeles acquired at 260 nm and 280 nm (plotted as dA/dT versus T) (Banerjee et al., 1993) for the wild-type 41-nucleotide mIAP pseudoknot and two stem 1 hairpins in the absence of exogenous Mg 2 are shown in Figure 2 (b) with the thermodynamic parameters compiled in Table 1 . Unless otherwise noted, the experimental data are presented in the left-hand side of each panel and are superimposed with a continuous curve which describes an optimized non-linear least-squares \u00aet to an unfolding model consisting of a set of sequential, interacting, two-state transitions. The individual transition \u00aets are shown on the right-hand side of the Figure for clarity. Initially, melts were collected on a wild-type mIAP pseudoknot and mIAP-HP with a short singlestranded 5 H tail. The 5 H single-stranded tail was omitted from the mIAP wild-type pseudoknot RNA and subsequent mutant RNAs when it was observed that it did not signi\u00aecantly affect the stability of the pseudoknot as determined from optical melting pro\u00aeles (data not shown).\n\nThe wild-type mIAP pseudoknot optical melting pro\u00aele is shown in Figure 2 (b). The pro\u00aele exhibits hyperchromicity in two transitions, a broad low intensity transition between 30 and 50 C and a sharper, higher intensity transition above 80 C, both with signi\u00aecant hyperchromicity at 280 nm as expected for the high G-C content of the two helical stems (Fresco et al., 1963) . Even though initial inspection gives the appearance of only two tran-sitions, it was necessary to \u00aet the data to four sequential two-state transitions in order to eliminate the periodic deviation in the residuals observed when \u00aetting to fewer transitions. Turner rules compiled at 1 M NaCl predict an enthalpy of 68 and 77 kcal mol \u00c01 for the melting of stems 1 and 2, respectively, provided seven base-pairs are formed in stem 2 and the 3 H single-stranded nucleotide stacks against the stem (Turner et al., 1988; He et al., 1991; Xia et al., 1998) . The predicted stabilization due to stacked Watson-Crick base-pairs was calculated using the modi\u00aeed individual nearest-neighbor model (INN-HB) parameters which account for the difference in stabilization between internal and closing A-U base-pairs (Xia et al., 1998) . The thermodynamic parameters for hairpin and bulge loops reported by Turner et al. (1988) were used. In good agreement with these predictions, the \u00aerst two transitions have a combined \u00c1H 75 kcal mol \u00c01 and the \u00aenal transition has an \u00c1H 66.7 kcal mol \u00c01 , suggesting that stem 2 unfolds \u00aerst in two steps with stem 1 unfolding at much higher temperature.\n\nTwo stem 1 hairpin RNAs were constructed to unambiguously de\u00aene the optical signature of stem 1 unfolding: these are mIAP-HP RNA, which consists of the \u00aerst 23 nucleotides of the mIAP pseudoknot sequence, and AA-HP RNA, a variant of the mIAP-HP RNA in which the hairpin loop nucleotides 9 and 10 were converted from guanosine to adenosine as shown in Figure 2 (a). Unexpectedly, the optical melting pro\u00aele of the mIAP-HP shows three distinct transitions. The \u00aerst transition is unusual in that it has signi\u00aecant hyperchromicity (dA/dT) only at 260 nm with a very high enthalpy (\u00c1H 76 kcal mol \u00c01 ) at t m 47 C. The second transition has an \u00c1H 42 kcal mol \u00c01 and an (dA 260 /dT)/(dA 280 /dT) value (A 260 / A 280 ratio) of %0.26, while the third transition is characterized by \u00c1H 57 kcal mol \u00c01 and A 260 / A 280 % 0.36. The melting pro\u00aele was superimposable in both the folding and unfolding directions (data not shown). The combined enthalpy of these transitions is 175 kcal mol \u00c01 , much larger than would be predicted from the nearest-neighbor model for the stem 1 hairpin (64 kcal mol \u00c01 ). The molecular origin of the \u00aerst unfolding transition is unknown; however, it is observed calorimetrically as well with essentially identical van't Hoff thermodynamic parameters (data not shown). The second transition shows a concentration dependence over the 2-55 mM range consistent with predictions for formation of some kind of intermolecular structure. The high enthalpy and t m and low A 260 /A 280 ratio of the third optical transition are consistent with predictions for the unfolding of a stem consisting of six G-C basepairs.\n\nIn an attempt to simplify the hairpin melting pro\u00aele, a second stem 1 hairpin (AA-HP) was constructed with the 5 H single-stranded tail eliminated and two G 3 A substitutions in the hairpin loop to potentially disrupt any loop structure. As shown in Figure 2 (b), the melting pro\u00aele is simpli-\u00aeed with the complete disappearance of the \u00aerst mIAP-HP transition and a signi\u00aecant reduction in the intensity of the second unfolding transition. The optical signature of the \u00aenal transition was identical in the two hairpin RNAs and in the wildtype mIAP pseudoknot and was therefore assigned to the unfolding of stem 1. We interpret the penultimate transition as some type of unstacking in the loop, the intensity of which is strongly affected by the identity of the loop purines.\n\nDifferential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed on the wild-type mIAP pseudoknot and compared to that obtained for a nucleotide deletion mutant, termed \u00c1A35 RNA, in which a stem 2 unpaired adenosine is deleted and all seven possible stem 2 base-pairs are predicted to form (Figure 1(b) ). Comparisons of the optical and calorimetric melting pro\u00aeles for these two RNAs are shown in Figure 3 with the \u00aetted thermodynamic parameters from the optical and calorimetric data presented in Table 2 . The calorimetric and optical melting pro\u00aeles were \u00aet independently and returned internally consistent thermodynamic parameters for the individual unfolding transitions, with the caveat that the enthalpies and t m values of the \u00aenal transitions are more accurately determined from calorimetry, since the optical data could only be collected to 95 C.\n\nThe optical and calorimetric melting pro\u00aeles of the \u00c1A35 RNA (shown in Figure 3 (b)) were \u00aet to three sequential transitions. The second and third transitions were observed to be consistent with the hairpin loop unstacking and stem 1 unfolding transitions previously assigned in the wild-type pseudoknot. The \u00aerst unfolding transition at 63 C is assigned to unfolding of stem 2. Comparing the wild-type mIAP and \u00c1A35 RNAs, the transitions observed at lower t m differ signi\u00aecantly in hyperchromic intensity. However, the \u00aerst \u00c1A35 RNA transition and the combined \u00aerst and second mIAP RNA transitions return the same total calorimetric enthalpy as determined by the area under the curve. The calorimetric enthalpy observed for these two molecules con\u00aerms that stem 2 unfolding in the wild-type mIAP pseudoknot occurs in two tightly coupled transitions with base stacking interactions similar to that observed in the \u00c1A35 RNA. More importantly, the van't Hoff. Enthalpics determined for each transition from calorimetry and from optical melts are in excellent agreement with one another and, whem summed, agree well with the osberved total calorimetric enthalpy. This suggests that \u00c1C p for the overall unfolding process is small. As discussed below, the impact of this A35 deletion on the global stability of the molecule is essentially as predicted for an extrahelical, unpaired nucleotide.\n\nIn order to deconvolute the two stem 2 unfolding transitions of the mIAP pseudoknot and assign each to the unfolding of one of the two substems Enthalpy is in kcal mol \u00c01 and t m is in C. \u00c1H T vH is the total van't Hoff enthalpy summed over all four transitions. a The 260/280 ratio represents (dA 260 /dT)/(dA 280 /dT), the ratio of the hyperchromic effect at 260 and 280 nm. b 260/280 ratios in parentheses indicate that hyperchromicity was observed only at the wavelength in parentheses. c The \u00c1 tail data are shown at 0 and 5 mM Mg 2 as the enthalpy of the \u00aerst transition increased with Mg 2 concentration. At 5 mM Mg 2 , the \u00aenal transition is off-scale and cannot be measured optically.\n\nof stem 2 (Figure 1(b) ), an RNA in which the 3 H \u00aeve nucleotides (C37 to U41) were deleted, \u00c1 tail, was prepared. In addition, two stem 2 base-pair substitution RNAs were constructed as well (Figure 1(b) ). The stem 2 variants were A33 U13 RNA, which substitutes an A-U base-pair for a G-C base-pair above the unpaired adenosine base, and U37 A10 RNA, which substitutes an A-U basepair for a G-C base-pair below the unpaired adenosine base. The optical melting pro\u00aeles acquired at 260 nm and 280 nm for the stem 2 variants and the wild-type mIAP pseudoknot in the absence of exogenously added Mg 2 are shown in Figure 4 with the thermodynamic parameters compiled in Table 1 . As expected, in all three cases the compensatory stem 2 mutations primarily affect the low temperature transitions with the hairpin loop and stem 1 unfolding transitions essentially as observed in the wild-type pseudoknot.\n\nThe 3 H base-pair substitution mutant RNA, U37 A10, has a signi\u00aecantly different melting pro\u00aele relative to the wild-type pseudoknot in the stem 2 transition region. The enthalpies of both transitions are decreased by 6-8 kcal mol \u00c01 . The \u00aerst transition in U37 A10 occurs at a lower t m and has an inverted 260/280 ratio compared to the wild-type RNA as well as a signi\u00aecantly lower intensity. The second transition occurs at a higher t m than wildtype RNA also with a slightly increased 260/280 ratio. Turner rules predict an enthalpy of 75 kcal mol \u00c01 for the substituted stem 2, 12 kcal mol \u00c01 more than is observed experimentally for the sum of the \u00aerst two transitions (Turner et al., 1988; Xia et al., 1998) . This mutation therefore destabilizes the \u00aerst transition both enthalpically and entropically, suggesting that the \u00aerst transition corresponds to unfolding of the substem 3 H to the unpaired adenosine base in stem 2. The entropic destabilization of the second transition is likely due to the tight coupling of the \u00aerst two transitions on the temperature coordinate, since it reports on the unfolding of the same secondary structural unit.\n\nLike the U37 A10 RNA, unfolding of the A33 U13 RNA shows signi\u00aecant perturbation of both stem 2 transitions. Although modi\u00aeed Turner rules predict an enthalpy of 73 kcal mol \u00c01 for Enthalpy is reported in kcal mol \u00c01 and t m is reported in C. For each RNA, thermodynamic parameters determined from optical melting (UV) are presented in the \u00aerst row and from calorimetry (cal) in the second. \u00c1H T vH is the total van't Hoff enthalpy summed over the four transitions.\n\na H cal is a model-independent enthalpy derived from the differential scanning calorimetry data. b The 260/280 ratio represents (dA 260 /dT)/(dA 280 /dT), the ratio of the hyperchromic effect at 260 and 280 nm. Unfolding Thermodynamics of a Frameshifting Pseudoknot the melting of stem 2 (Xia et al., 1998) , only 53 kcal mol \u00c01 are recovered experimentally under these conditions. Both transitions show a decrease in van't Hoff enthalpy by %10 kcal mol \u00c01 and a decrease in t m by 10 deg. C with respect to the wild-type RNA. The resolved A 260 /A 280 ratios of both transitions are signi\u00aecantly affected, increasing in the \u00aerst transition and decreasing in the second. One explanation for the effect this mutation has on both transitions is that the lower half of stem 2 is stabilized by stacking interactions with the upper half as exhibited by the tight coupling of the two transitions on the temperature coordinate. Destabilization of the upper half of the stem as measured in the second optical unfolding transition would cause an observed destabilization of transition 1 and the lower half of the stem due to the cooperativity of unfolding the helical stem.\n\nThe 3 H tail deleted molecule, \u00c1 tail RNA, is predicted to have a single transition at low t m and should model the unfolding of the upper substem of stem 2 as the base-pairs derived from the lower half of stem 2 cannot form. The enthalpy and A 260 / A 280 ratio are consistent with those observed for the second pseudoknot unfolding transition although the t m is lower. The predicted enthalpy for three G-C base-pairs, an A-U base-pair, and a stacked 3 H adenosine base is 40 kcal mol \u00c01 . The enthalpy of the \u00aerst transition in this molecule increases from 28 to 38 kcal mol \u00c01 when 51 mM Mg 2 is added, in accord with predictions. The unfolding enthalpies of the wild-type pseudoknot transitions are not Mg 2 -dependent up to 1 mM Mg 2 (data not shown).\n\nOur detailed investigation of the stem-assignment mutant and stem 1 hairpin RNAs make it possible to assign a temperature-induced equilibrium unfolding pathway for the mIAP gag-pro frameshifting pseudoknot as shown in Figure 5 . The unfolding proceeds through four optically and calorimetrically de\u00aened steps. The fully folded pseudoknot (F) unfolds initially at the four 3 H basepairs of stem 2 below the unpaired adenosine (S1 J), followed by the rest of the helical stem 2 to form an intermediate (I), which consists of the stem 1 hairpin and some structure in the hairpin loop. The hairpin loop structure is then unfolded to give the stem 1 hairpin (S1) and \u00aenally the fully unfolded form (U):\n\nF D S1 J D I D S1 D U The stability of the hairpin loop structure is not expected to contribute to the overall pseudoknot stability as the loop structure must be disrupted in order to form the stem 2 base-pairing in the pseudoknot.\n\nMg 2 -dependence of the thermodynamics of unfolding of the mIAP pseudoknot All of the above unfolding experiments were carried out in 50 mM KCl (pH 7.0) in the absence of added divalent cation. Under these conditions, all of the RNA molecules studied here appear fully folded, since the total recovered unfolding enthalpy is comparable to nearest-neighbor predictions and does not change greatly with added Mg 2 ( Table 2) . To further probe the stabilization of the wild-type mIAP pseudoknot by Mg 2 , optical melts were collected over a wide range of Mg 2 concentrations (50 mM-50 mM) in this background of 50 mM KCl. The data are shown in Figure 6 for the F 3 S1 J and S1 J 3 I transitions in the format of a 1/t m versus log[Mg 2 ] plot. Given the non-linear dependence of 1/t m on log[Mg 2 ] for these two unfolding transitions, the data were \u00aet to a non-speci\u00aec binding model for divalent ions in which the folded and unfolded forms of the RNA participating in the transition have non-negligible af\u00aenities for Mg 2 Nixon & Giedroc, 1998; Gluick et al., 1997) . The number of phosphate groups participating in these two unfolding steps was \u00aexed at 8 and 6, respectively. The magnesium binding af\u00aenities for the folded (K f ) and unfolded (K u ) forms were found to be 3500(AE200) M \u00c01 and 500(AE40) M \u00c01 , respectively, for the \u00aerst transition and 3500(AE600) M \u00c01 and 700(AE150) M \u00c01 for the second transition. The non-speci\u00aec model \u00aets the data extremely well with a total of %2.3 Mg 2 released upon unfolding of the pseudoknot to the partially folded stem 1 hairpin intermediate at 0.4 mM Mg 2 . For comparison, the unfolding of a seven base-pair hairpin releases %1 Mg 2 at slightly higher monovalent salt (0.10 M K ), suggesting that the fully and partially folded Figure 5 . The proposed equilibrium unfolding pathway of the mIAP pseudoknot based on a multiple, interacting, sequential two-state transition analysis of the optical and calorimetric unfolding data. pseudoknot sequesters slightly more Mg 2 than do similarly sized RNA hairpins (Nixon et al., 1999) .\n\nThree unpaired adenosine deletion molecules were characterized to determine the extent to which these nucleotides contribute to the thermodynamic stability of the mIAP frameshifting pseudoknot. These mutations are \u00c1A15 RNA, where the putative unpaired adenosine base at the junction has been removed, \u00c1A35 RNA, where the extrahelical adenosine base in the discontinuous seven base-pair stem 2 has been removed, and the double-mutant, \u00c1A35A15 RNA, in which both adenosine bases are removed. Optical melting pro-\u00aeles for these RNAs are shown in Figure 7 with optical and calorimetric data compiled in Table 2 .\n\nThe \u00c1A15 mutation occurs at the junction of the two stems and it was therefore not possible to predict the affect that this mutation would have on the stability of the pseudoknot structure. The mutation could be stabilizing if the deletion allows coaxial stacking across the junction otherwise not present, neutral if A15 has no affect on pseudoknot stability, or destabilizing if A15 is involved in stacking of the helical stems, tertiary interactions, or maintenance of the correct junction conformation through an A15-U31 base-pair or other interactions. This is a particularly interesting mutant, since the analogous adenosine residue in the MMTV gag-pro pseudoknot is wedged between the two pseudoknot stems leading to a bent structure .\n\nThe melting pro\u00aele of the \u00c1A15 RNA is very similar to that of the wild-type pseudoknot. The optical pro\u00aele shows a small reduction in the enthalpy and t m of both stem 2 transitions. The calorimetry data also show some destabilization of the \u00aerst two transitions re\u00afected in both t m and enthalpy, with a total 10 kcal mol \u00c01 decrease in the calorimetric enthalpy of the \u00c1A15 RNA (Table 2) and a free energy difference \u00c1\u00c1G (37 C) 1 kcal mol \u00c01 (Table 3 ) compared to the wild-type RNA. This suggests that A15 plays a small role in stabilization of the pseudoknotted structure. In addition, investigation of the Mg 2 -dependence of the unfolding of the \u00c1A15 RNA reveals that the binding af\u00aenities for Mg 2 determined for the \u00c1A15 RNA are virtually identical with those observed for the wild-type mIAP RNA, with the same net release of Mg 2 upon unfolding of stem 2 (data not shown).\n\nThe \u00c1A35 deletion RNA was predicted to allow stacking of both substems of stem 2, which could then potentially unfold in one cooperative unit exhibiting a single optical transition with a predicted enthalpy of 81 kcal mol \u00c01 in 1 M NaCl. Both calorimetry and optical melting data reveal that this transition melts in a single cooperative transition at 63 C with an enthalpy of 65-70 kcal mol \u00c01 measured in 50 mM KCl (pH 7.0), qualitatively in accordance with predictions.\n\nAs expected, the double deletion mutant RNA, \u00c1A35A15 RNA, shows a single stem 2 transition, similar to the single mutant \u00c1A35 RNA. Interestingly, both stem 2 and stem 1 are destabilized enthalpically and in t m compared to the \u00c1A35 deletion alone. In particular, stem 2 in the double mutant appears enthalpically destabilized by %12 kcal mol \u00c01 with the total calorimetric enthalpy for the pseudoknot transitions 23 kcal mol \u00c01 less than observed for the \u00c1A35 RNA. This suggests that the junction of the two stems causes a somewhat larger enthalpic destabilization of stem 2 in the context of the \u00c1A35 mutation than that observed in the wild-type pseudoknot; however, in free energy, the overall effect is comparable in magnitude to the \u00c1A15 mutation.\n\nOptical melting pro\u00aeles were collected in the presence of urea to more completely determine the thermodynamic parameters for unfolding for, in particular, the high temperature transitions. Urea was used to decrease the t m of the transitions in a pseudoknot involved in stop-codon readthrough at the gag-pol junction in the Moloney murine leukemia virus mRNA (MuLV) (Gluick et al., 1997) . In that study, a linear and shallow dependence of the t m on the urea concentration was observed, while the van't Hoff enthalpies were found to decrease by only a small extent. When the wild-type and \u00c1A15 Figure 6 . Effect of [Mg 2 ] on the t m for the \u00aerst two unfolding transitions in the wild-type mIAP pseudoknot. The dependence of 1/t m on [Mg 2 ] for the \u00aerst transition (F 3 S1 J) is shown at the top and for the second transition (S1 J 3 I) at the bottom (see Figure 5 ). The continuous line represents the \u00aet of the experimental data to a non-speci\u00aec binding model (Nixon & Giedroc, 1998) .\n\nUnfolding Thermodynamics of a Frameshifting Pseudoknot pseudoknots were thermally denatured in the presence of increasing concentrations of urea, signi\u00aecant differences in their melting pro\u00aeles were observed as shown in Figure 8 . In the wild-type pseudoknot, the two low temperature transitions remain tightly coupled and appear to move together to lower t m , although ureainduced destabilization of stem 2 is considerably more pronounced than that of stem 1. In the \u00c1A15 RNA, both stem 2 unfolding transitions move to lower t m at low urea concentrations; at greater than 20 % (w/v) urea, the \u00aerst transition continues to move to lower t m , while the second transition appears to stop, allowing clear separation of the two stem 2 transitions on the temperature coordinate. Although the molecular origins of these effects of urea are unknown, these data provide additional evidence that the helical junction regions of these two pseudoknots may well be different, with the \u00c1A15 deletion modestly destabilizing at low urea and ultimately stabilizing in high urea.\n\nFinally, a loop 2 substitution mutant RNA, L2U, was constructed to determine if the sequence of loop 2 contributes in any signi\u00aecant way to pseudoknot stability. The nine nucleotide loop sequence was changed to uridine bases as outlined in Figure 1(b) , which would be expected to eliminate any signi\u00aecant helix-single-strand tertiary contacts . The optical and calorimetric pro\u00aeles for L2U are shown compared to the wild-type pseudoknot in Figure 9 with the thermodynamic data compiled in Tables 2 and 3 . This substitution has a dramatic impact on the appearance of the melting pro\u00aele of the molecule. Analysis of the optical melting pro\u00aele shows that the F 3 S1 J transition is signi\u00aecantly destabilized with the van't Hoff enthalpy and t m decreased by 17 kcal mol \u00c01 and 15 deg. C, respectively, while the \u00c1H vH and the t m of the S1 J 3 I transition appear to increase by 12 kcal mol \u00c01 and 8 deg. C, respectively. The calorimetric data show Enthalpy and free energy are reported in kcal mol \u00c01 for the sum of unfolding transitions 1, 2 and 4. \u00c1G values are calculated at 37 C. Parameters determined from calorimetry data are shown in parentheses.\n\na The two stem 2 transition enthalpies are summed for mIAP, \u00c1A15, and L2U. b Does not include a contribution from the helical junction (\u00c1H 10.6 kcal mol \u00c01 ) but does include a contribution from the 3 H stack.\n\nc Calculated at 1.0 M Na . Incorporates a \u00aexed value of 9 kcal mol \u00c01 for the pseudoknot loop closing entropy estimated from the unfolding of H-type pseudoknots previously studied (Theimer et al., 1998; Nixon & Giedroc, 1998) . Previous studies show that the free energy calculated for a simple hairpin at 100 mM KCl is 2-4 kcal mol \u00c01 smaller than that observed at high Mg 2 (equivalent stabilization to high monovalent concentrations) (Theimer et al., 1998) ; thus, the experimental \u00c1G values are in good agreement with predicted \u00c1G values. Unfolding Thermodynamics of a Frameshifting Pseudoknot trends that mirror the optical data and emphasize the strong, largely entropically derived destabilization of the 3 H substem of stem 2 (compare Figures 3(a) and 9) . This is the only mutant RNA for which the F 3 S1 J and S1 J 3 I unfolding steps are not tightly coupled on the temperature coordinate at 0 mM Mg 2 . The simplest interpretation of the effects of the L2U substitution is that the entropic penalty for pseudoknot loop closure is signi\u00aecantly larger in this mutant relative to the wild-type pseudoknot.\n\nThe equilibrium unfolding pathway of the mIAP pseudoknot proceeds in four discreet steps\n\nThe temperature-induced equilibrium unfolding pathway for the mIAP gag-pro frameshifting pseudoknot proceeds through four optically and calorimetrically de\u00aened steps. The fully folded pseudoknot (F) unfolds initially at the four 3 H basepairs of stem 2 below the unpaired adenosine to form a non-native pseudoknot intermediate (S1 J). This is followed by the unfolding of the remainder of the helical stem 2 to form an intermediate (I) which consists of the stem 1 hairpin with some as yet unknown structure in the hairpin loop. The hairpin loop structure is then unfolded to give the stem 1 hairpin (S1), which is denatured to the fully unfolded form (U):\n\nF D S1 J D I D S1 D U Interestingly, the two RNAs in which A35 has been deleted follow this pathway, in spite of the fact that the seven base-pair 3 H helical stem 2 of this pseudoknot is predicted to be more stable than the six base-pair 5 H helical stem 1. This general unfolding behavior was also observed for the gene 32 autoregulatory H-type pseudoknot from bacteriophage T2 (Nixon & Giedroc, 1998) in which the 3 H helical stem, predicted to be more stable thermodynamically, unfolds \u00aerst in two discernable transitions, followed by the 5 H helical stem. The mIAP pseudoknot therefore appears to unfold in an obligate pathway in which the 3 H stem 2 is considerably less stable in the context of the pseudoknot than is stem 1.\n\nThe role of Mg 2 in the stability of the mIAP pseudoknot\n\nThe observed and predicted enthalpies for the two stems in mIAP indicate that the observed van't Hoff enthalpy (in the absence of Mg 2 ) is suf\u00aecient to account for all or nearly all of the predicted secondary structure in the pseudoknot (Table 2) . Tertiary structure in RNA is folded after and unfolded before secondary structure (Draper, Figure 9 . Melting pro\u00aeles of the wild-type mIAP pseudoknot compared to the loop 2 substitution mutant, L2U RNA. On the left, the composite \u00aets are superimposed on the experimental data. On the right, the individual transitions of the composite \u00aet are shown for clarity. Black (*) and gray-scale () correspond to dA/dT monitored at 260 and 280 nm, respectively. The composite \u00aet is superimposed on the L2U calorimetry data (*) on the left, with the individual transitions shown for clarity on the right with the composite \u00aet shown with a broken line. 1996). If Mg 2 induces tertiary structure in the pseudoknot, the unfolding of the tertiary structure would be expected to occur before, or concomitant with, the unfolding of the secondary structure. The van't Hoff enthalpy observed for the two stem 2 transitions in the wild-type mIAP does not increase with increasing [Mg 2 ] 5 1.0 mM and no new unfolding transitions are observed, suggesting that Mg 2 does not induce the additional folding or energetically signi\u00aecant loop-stem interactions found in more complex RNAs (Draper, 1996) . Thermodynamic analysis of the unfolding of other simple H-type RNA pseudoknots suggests that this may be a general property of these molecules (Gluick et al., 1997; Nixon & Giedroc, 1998; Theimer et al., 1998) . Consistent with this, the studies reported here suggest that the unfolding of these RNAs does not seem to be accompanied by a large change in the total heat capacity of the system, given the excellent agreement between the van't Hoff enthalpies determined from optical and calorimetric experiments ( Table 2) .\n\nThe calculated and predicted thermodynamic parameters for the wild-type mIAP and selected mutants are summarized in Table 3 . The mIAP pseudoknot shares some similarities with the SRV-1 and MMTV pseudoknots including structural ambiguity at the junction of the two helical stems. Deletion of the junction adenosine base in the mIAP pseudoknot, A15, is only slightly destabilizing with \u00c1\u00c1G (37 C) % 1 kcal mol \u00c01 . This destabilization is smaller than would be predicted for the loss of an A-U base-pair and coaxial stacking on stem 1. The close approach of backbone phosphate groups at the helical junction in RNA pseudoknots sometimes creates a region high in negative electrostatic potential which has been suggested as a possible location for chelation of divalent metal ions with higher af\u00aenity than duplex RNA (Gluick et al., 1997; Puglisi et al., 1990; Nixon & Giedroc, 1998) . Therefore, mutations at the helical junction might destabilize an RNA pseudoknot by signi\u00aecantly altering higher af\u00aenity divalent binding sites. The wild-type mIAP and \u00c1A15 pseudoknots were studied over a wide range of Mg 2 concentrations (50 mM-50 mM), and the dependence of t m on [Mg 2 ] for the F 3 S1 J and S1 J 3 I transitions \u00aet to a non-speci\u00aec binding model for divalent ions (Figure 6 ). The magnitude of K f and K u , which represent the average af\u00aenities of the RNAs for Mg 2 , were found to be reasonable for non-speci\u00aec binding in a background of 50 mM KCl compared to the magnitudes of K f and K u values determined for the pseudoknot from bacteriophage T2 gene 32 mRNA at 100 mM KCl (Nixon & Giedroc, 1998; Nixon et al., 1999) . More importantly, the Mg 2 binding af\u00aenities were found to be virtually identical for these two RNAs, suggesting that it is unlikely that the A15 deletion causes the loss of a speci\u00aec ion binding site or results in differential accumulation of ions in the pseudoknot. The uncoupling of the two stem 2 transitions in the \u00c1A15 molecule in the presence of urea (Figure 8) , with the region of stem 2 closest to the junction becoming stabilized toward urea denaturation compared to the mIAP pseudoknot, however, suggests that the helical junction in the F and S1 J conformations of the \u00c1A15 pseudoknot may be better stacked than in the wildtype mIAP pseudoknot.\n\nPreliminary 2D NMR experiments suggest the presence of only one A-U base-pair in the mIAP pseudoknot (C.A.T., D. Hoffman & D.P.G., unpublished observations). In combination with the small destabilization observed upon deletion of A15, these data suggest that A15 is unpaired or not strongly paired. Structure probing experiments indicate that the unpaired adenosine base in stem 2, A35, and the adenosine bases in loop 2 are substantially more susceptible to DEPC modi\u00aecation than is A15 in the wild-type mIAP pseudoknot (T. Young & C.A.T., unpublished results). The reduced susceptibility of A15 to both chemical modi\u00aecation and enzymatic cleavage may suggest that some or all of the A15 nucleotide is not totally exposed to solvent; additional structural insight will have to await further structural studies. Analogous thermodynamic studies of the structurally characterized MMTV-vpk pseudoknot suggest that the unpaired adenosine base at the junction does not contribute exceptional stability to the pseudoknot and in fact provides stabilization equivalent to that predicted for a 3 H single-stranded nucleotide stacked on the junction base-pair of stem 2 (unpublished results).\n\nThe thermodynamic effects of deletion of A15 and A35 are very nearly additive Three RNAs, \u00c1A15, \u00c1A35, and \u00c1A35A15, were prepared to examine the contribution that the unpaired adenosine bases make to the thermodynamic stability of the mIAP frameshifting pseudoknot. Deletion of A35 is predicted to be stabilizing, allowing the formation of an uninterrupted stem 2, which would unfold in a single cooperative transition. A15 and A35 were both deleted in the \u00c1A35A15 RNA, to determine if the A15 deletion, which is only modestly destabilizing in the context of the wild-type pseudoknot, has the same effect in the context of a continuous stem 2. The calculated and predicted thermodynamic parameters for the \u00c1A35 and \u00c1A35A15 RNAs are summarized in Table 3 . The \u00c1A35 RNA stabilizes the mIAP pseudoknot by 3.2 kcal mol \u00c01 , exactly as expected for the elimination of the entropic destabilization predicted for a single nucleotide bulge in a helical stem (Turner et al., 1988) . Although the molecular origin may well be different, deletion of A15 in the context of the \u00c1A35 deletion reveals that the free energy of unfolding of stem 2 is also %1 kcal mol \u00c01 smaller than \u00c1A35 RNA, coupled with a small perturbation in the stability of stem 1. These results suggest that the thermodynamic impact of these two deletions are very nearly additive, suggesting that it is unlikely that the unpaired adenosine bases cooperate in some way to globally stabilize the molecule.\n\nIn pseudoknots that promote frameshifting and stop codon readthrough, the sequence and length of loop 2 has been shown in some cases to be functionally signi\u00aecant. For example, sequences in loop 2 seem to be important for stop codon readthrough at the UAG terminator between gag and pol in Moloney murine leukemia virus (MuLV) (Wills et al., 1991 (Wills et al., , 1994 . On the other hand, the entire loop 2 sequence in the gag-pro frameshift site in SRV-1 can be changed with essentially no effect on frameshifting, and reducing the length of loop 2 actually increases frameshifting activity (ten Dam et al., 1995) . The effect of loop 2 sequence and length on the stability of the pseudoknot cannot be predicted from known thermodynamic parameters although the minimum loop length requirements have been experimentally examined (Pleij et al., 1985; Wyatt et al., 1990) . The substitution of the loop 2 sequence with uridine bases in the mIAP pseudoknot uncouples the F 3 S1 J and S1 J 3 I unfolding events, destabilizing the 3 H substem and stabilizing the junction substem. The combined enthalpy of the \u00aerst two stem 2 transitions is close to that predicted for the entire helical stem, and the overall destabilization compared to the mIAP pseudoknot \u00c1\u00c1G (37 C) is 1.2 kcal mol \u00c01 from optical melts and 3.0 kcal mol \u00c01 determined calorimetrically. Interestingly, the L2U mutant melting pro\u00aele bears a striking resemblance to the effect of 20-25 % urea on the melting pro\u00aele of the \u00c1A15 RNA pseudoknot (Figure 8 ). This suggests that the origin of this perturbation of the stability of the molecule by uridine substitution of loop 2 may be similar to that induced by low concentrations of urea. The mechanism by which urea destabilizes RNA is not known, but hydrogen bonding to RNA functional groups or a change in solvent ordering are two possibilities. In any case, both effects are likely transmitted through a selectively weakened junction region. These \u00aendings suggest that caution must be exercised in ascribing changes in frameshifting ef\u00aeciency to nucleotide sequence effects, due to the possibility of a change in the global stability of the molecule.\n\nHere, we have determined the equilibrium unfolding pathway and quanti\u00aeed the thermodynamic effects of deletions of unpaired adenosine nucleotides and loop 2 sequence substitution on the stability of an H-type RNA pseudoknot involved in programmed ribosomal frameshifting using thermal denaturation monitored by UV hyperchromicity and differential scanning calorimetry. We have determined that (1) the unfolding pathway proceeds in four de\u00aenable steps, (2) the unfolding thermodynamics suggest that \u00c1C p is small in this system, (3) stabilization by Mg 2 can be fully accounted for by the impact of delocalized, non-speci\u00aecally bound ions, (4) the unpaired adenosine base at the helical junction A15 is only modestly stabilizing, and (5) substitution of the loop 2 nucleotide sequence with uridine bases is destabilizing in the context of the mIAP pseudoknot. Experiments are in progress in this laboratory to characterize the structures and frameshifting activity of these molecules. These experiments will allow us to systematically explore the relationships between thermodynamic stability, frameshifting activity, structure, and dynamics and help us to clarify the role of downstream pseudoknots on programmed ribosomal frameshifting.\n\nRNAs with the sequences shown in Figure 1 (b) were prepared by in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase and partially double-stranded templates as described (Qiu et al., 1996; Du et al., 1996) . Crude RNAs were puri\u00aeed by denaturing PAGE, visualized by UV shadowing and electroeluted using an S&S electroeluter. The recovered RNA was loaded onto a C18-cartridge (Alltech), eluted with a 50 % (v/v) methanol wash, taken to dryness and subjected to exhaustive dialysis against 10 mM Mops (pH 7.0), 50 mM KCl. The \u00aerst change of dialysis buffer contained 10 mM EDTA, with the subsequent (two or three) changes containing no EDTA. RNAs were stored at \u00c020 C. Samples were prepared for thermal denaturation by diluting into \u00aenal dialysis buffer, heating at 90 C for \u00aeve minutes, slow cooling to room temperature, and then adding the appropriate concentration of MgSO 4 . This procedure was found to be most effective at removing RNA dimers formed at the stock solution concentration. Melt samples which contained urea were prepared by diluting into \u00aenal dialysis buffer, adding the appropriate concentration of urea, heating at 65 C for 20 minutes, and then slow cooling to room temperature. Dimer formation was substantially reduced in the presence of urea.\n\nAll RNA melts were collected on a temperature controller equipped Cary 1 spectrophotometer operating in double beam mode. All melts were collected in 10 mM Mops (pH 7.0), 50 mM KCl with the indicated concentration of MgSO 4 or urea added. Capped cells were used and percentage transmittance was recorded as a function of temperature at both 260 nm and 280 nm simultaneously. Samples were loaded into room temperature cuvettes and the cells allowed to equilibrate at 5 C for 30 minutes. The temperature controller was ramped at a rate of 0.3 deg. C/minute from 5-100 C. Data points were collected every 0.3-0.4 deg. C as determined by a temperature probe inserted into a cuvette containing \u00aenal dialysis buffer.\n\nCary 1 report \u00aeles were converted from percentage transmittance to absorbance and subjected to piecewise linear interpolation. The interpolated sets of data were then smoothed over a 4 deg. C window and the melting pro\u00aele was generated by taking the \u00aerst derivative of absorbance with respect to temperature (dA/dT) and plotted as a function of temperature. Melting pro\u00aeles were subjected to non-linear leastsquares parameter estimation of t m,i , \u00c1H i , and A i , for each ith sequential unfolding transition via application of an unfolding model involving interacting sequential two-state unfolding transitions using the t-melt program running on an SGI O 2 Unix workstation as described (Theimer et al., 1998) . The van't Hoff analysis of the UV melting data assumes that \u00c1C p is zero, which is a reasonable approximation given the observed agreement between the UV and calorimetric melting data.\n\nIn the t-melt algorithm, each optical melting transition is assumed to be two-state and is characterized by an equilibrium constant, K i , that is a function of the enthalpy of the transition, \u00c1H i , and the melting temperature for that transition, t m . All species in the solution at temperature T are described by the partition function q:\n\nwhere NTRANS is the total number of unfolding transitions. We de\u00aene z n as the sum of the terms in which an individual transition, n, participates. The absorbance at a given temperature is therefore the sum over all transitions of the contribution of each transition, z n , multiplied by its intrinsic amplitude, A n , divided by the partition function for the system as a whole, q: signal NTRANS n1 A n z n q NTRANS n1 e q 2 T 2 R I g g g g g g e\n\nAll calorimetry scans were collected on a Microcal VP-DSC. RNA concentrations in the sample cell varied between 15 and 50 mM in a 0.5 ml cell. Samples prepared for calorimetry were subjected to exhaustive dialysis against 10 mM Mops (pH 7.0), 50 mM KCl and the \u00aenal dialysis buffer was used for dilutions and references. Samples were diluted into \u00aenal dialysis buffer, heated at 90 C for \u00aeve minutes, slow cooled to room temperature, and degassed. Samples were then loaded into room temperature cells, cooled to 1 C, and allowed to equilibrate for 30 minutes. The temperature was ramped at a rate of 1 deg. C/ minute from 1-120 C. Baseline scans were run under identical conditions using \u00aenal dialysis buffer in both the sample and reference cells.\n\nAnalysis of differential scanning calorimetry data VP-DSC data \u00aeles were analyzed using the program Origin from Microcal. The collected buffer baseline scan was subtracted from the RNA sample scan and the data corrected for the concentration of RNA in the cell. Data were then subjected to a linear baseline correction, and the calorimetric enthalpy, H cal , calculated from the area under the baseline-corrected curve. van't Hoff enthalpies and t m values were determined utilizing a sequential two-state unfolding model \u00aet and the \u00aet minimized to represent the experimental data and also minimize the difference between the sum of the van't Hoff enthalpies and the total calorimetric enthalpy, H cal Multiple baseline correction routines were applied to ensure that subtle variations in baselining the data did not have large effects on the observed parameters.\n\nThe sequential unfolding model used for \u00aetting the calorimetry data is identical with that used for the optical data with the equilibrium constants, K i , the partition function, q, and the sum of the terms in which an individual transition participates, z n , described in the same way. Instead of an absorbance change, the signal observed is a change in the total molar heat content of the system, which is a function of the molar enthalpy, \u00c1H n , which changes for each individual transition, n. This function can be expressed as the sum over all transitions of the contribution of each transition, z n , multiplied by its intrinsic molar enthalpy, \u00c1H n , divided by the partition function for the system as a whole, q: This equation can then be differentiated with respect to temperature to obtain the system heat capacity, C p , which gives an equation identical in form with the dA/dT equation for \u00aetting the derivative of the optical data in which intrinsic molar enthalpy, \u00c1H n , is substituted for the intrinsic amplitude parameter, A n ."}
