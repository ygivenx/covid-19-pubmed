In recent years new metal complexes have been identified as a very promising class of anticancer active compounds [6e8] . Metals bound to atoms such as N, O and S can form a chelate ring that binds the metal more tightly when compared to the nonchelate form. Large biological molecules (proteins, enzymes, DNA etc.) are electron-rich but metal ions are electron-deficient. Therefore, interactions occur between metal ions and many important biological molecules. This event has led to the use of metals or metalcontaining agents to modulate biological systems [9] . Organometallic compounds have gained importance as enzyme inhibitors due to the capability of binding large biological molecules more strongly than metal-free organic compounds [10] .\n\nMetal complexes can inhibit metalloenzymes by chelate substitution and also inhibit non-metalloenzymes by coordinating to their active site. The other property of metals is to catalyze the formation of reactive oxygen species [11] . The anticancer potential of metal containing agents, from main group elements to early transition metals, have been evaluated [12e14] . Especially organoplatinum compounds such as cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin are metal-based drugs that are among the most active and widely used clinical drugs in cancer chemotherapy [15e17] . These platinum complexes react in vivo, binding to and causing crosslinking of DNA which finally activates programmed cell death [18] . However, the clinical utility of these drugs is limited to a relatively narrow range of tumors (sarcomas, small cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer, lymphomas and germ cell tumors) because of primary resistance and the development of resistance secondary to the initial treatment [19, 20] . Therefore, unconventional platinum complexes, that could be used in cisplatin-resistant tumors are made by different research groups [21e24] .\n\nLipophilicity that controls the rate of entry into the cell is altered by metal-coordination and some side-effects can be reduced by complexation. Moreover, metal complexes can exhibit biological activities more than free ligand [6] . Recently, thiosemicarbazones and their metal complexes have achieved importance due to their application in pharmaceutical chemistry and proved to be chemotherapeutic agents potentially useful for inhibiting the activities of cancer cells [25, 26] . For example, 3-aminopyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone (Triapine \u00d2 ; Vion Pharmaceuticals Inc. New Haven, CT) inhibit the biosynthesis of DNA in leukemia L1210 cells by blocking activity of ribonucleotide reductase [27] . Many heterocyclic thiosemicarbazone derivatives and their platinum and palladium complexes have a wide range of pharmacological activities, such as antituberculosis [28] , antibacterial [29] , antitumor [30] , antiprotozoal [31] , antimalarial [32] , antimicrobial [33] , antiviral [34] , antifungal [35] , anticonvulsant [36] and anti-trypanosomal [37] activities.\n\nIn our present work, the synthesis and characterization of thiosemicarbazones derived from 5-substitutedthiophene-2carboxaldehydes and their platinum(II) and palladium(II) complexes are reported. The results of in vitro antiviral and cytostatic/toxic activities of ligands and their platinum and palladium complexes have been evaluated.\n\nThe precursors phenyl isothiocyanate and 4-nitrophenyl isothiocyanate were synthesized from aniline and 4-nitroaniline according to the method described in the literature [38] . N-phenylhydrazinecarbothioamide and N-(4-nitrophenyl)hydrazinecarbothioamide were prepared by stirring isothiocyanates with hydrazine monohydrate in diethyl ether at room temperature according to Ref. [39] . The ligands 1e5 used in this work were obtained by refluxing in methanol (20e30 mL) an equimolar amount of 5-substituted-2-thiophene carboxaldehydes with thiosemicarbazides according to Refs. [35,40e42] . The chemical structures of the ligands are given in Scheme 1. All thiosemicarbazone derivatives synthesized were characterized by UVeVis, IR, 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR, MS spectral data and elemental analysis.\n\nThe platinum(II) and palladium(II) complexes of thiosemicarbazone derivatives 1ae5a and 1be5b were prepared by exposing a solution of the K 2 PtCl 4 or K 2 PdCl 4 in water to a solution of the appropriate ligand in ethanol in a 1:1 M:L molar ratio [43] . The structures of Pt(II) and Pd(II) complexes were confirmed by elemental analysis, UVeVis, IR, 1 H NMR, MS spectroscopies, elemental analyses and TGA thermogram and are given in Fig. 1 . The elemental analysis data of the ligands and their Pt(II) and Pd(II) complexes are presented in Table 1 .\n\nAll of the newly synthesized metal complexes 1a-5a and 1b-5b are solids and decomposed above ca. 200 C. They are insoluble in organic solvents such as acetone, chloroform and methanol but soluble in DMF and DMSO. The elemental analyses data of the thiosemicarbazones and their platinum and palladium complexes ( Table 1) were compatible with the structures of the ligands shown in Scheme 1. and the formulas of the complexes are shown in Fig. 1 .\n\nThe study of the electronic spectra in the ultraviolet and visible (UVeVis) ranges for the ligand and metal complexes was carried out in DMF. Solid-state electronic spectra of all thiosemicarbazone derivatives reveal similar patterns, exhibiting two bands in the 433e344 nm and 28e258 nm regions. An intense band at ca. 433e344 nm is attributed to the n / p * transitions of C]S group, C]N group and thiophene ring, which are overlapped. The p / p * transitions of the thiophene ring and thiosemicarbazone imine function are rather weak, and observed at ca. 281e258 nm. These two bands are shifted to lower energies (bathochromic shift) after complexation (467e371 nm, 344e264 nm). Such observations have also been reported earlier in other platinum(II) and palladium(II) complexes of similar ligand systems [44] .\n\nIR spectral data of all thiosemicarbazones and their Pt(II) and Pd(II) complexes showed a holding the 5-substitutedthiophene-2carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone moiety in all complexes. IR spectra were compared with free ligands and their Pt(II) and Pd(II) complexes and given in Table 2 .\n\nAlthough thiosemicarbazone derivatives are capable of interacting with metals in different ways, they usually behave as neutral NS donor bidentate ligands. The thiosemicarbazones can exhibit thione-thiol tautomerism in solution because of the thioamide (NHeC]S) function. The n(SH) band at ca. The 2500e2600 cm \u00c01 region is absent from the IR spectra of the ligands but the v(NH) band at 3115e3140 cm \u00c01 and the strong band due to v(C]S) at 783e825 cm \u00c01 are present, suggesting that in the solid phase the thiosemicarbazones remain as the thione form [45] . These bands are shifted to lower wavenumbers (13e66 cm \u00c01 ) indicating the coordination of metal through thione/thiol sulfur in all complexes. This coordination is approved by the presence of two new bands at the 502e521 and 400e418 cm \u00c01 region due to v(PteN, PdeN and PteS, PdeS), respectively [46] . The band due to v(CeSeC) of the thiophene ring remains unaltered in complexes (1ae5a and 1be5b), indicating non-participation of the thiophene ring in coordination. The azomethine stretching vibrations n(C]N), characteristic of a Schiff base are observed at 1582e1595 cm \u00c01 [7] . The negative shift (30e78 cm \u00c01 ) of the C]N band was observed in all complexes which exhibit the involvement of azomethine nitrogen upon complexation. On the other hand, the shift to higher wavenumbers of the v(NeN) band, observed for the platinum and palladium complexes, have also been related to the electronic delocalization and occurred as a consequence of coordination through the azomethine nitrogen atom and deprotonation of thiosemicarbazones [47] . Finally, the ligands 1e5 coordinate to platinum(II) and palladium(II) as NS bidentate.\n\nThe chemical structures of all thiosemicarbazones and their complexes were characterized by 1 H NMR spectroscopy and given in Table 3 . Platinum(II) and palladium(II) complexes exhibited similar 1 H NMR spectra and behavior. Results of the 1 H NMR integrations and signal multiplicities were in agreement with the proposed structures and other spectral data. 1 H NMR spectra of all thiosemicarbazones (1e5) recorded in DMSO-d 6 exhibited a sharp singlet peak at d 9.81e10.23 ppm due to the PhNH proton and at d 11.83e12.19 ppm due to the \u00bc NeNH proton, which indicate that even in a polar solvent they remain in the thione form. A singlet peak at d 8.24e8.40 ppm due to the HC] N group was in accordance with the literature [48e50]. The \u00bc NeNH proton signals disappeared in the 1 H NMR spectra of the platinum(II) and palladium(II) complexes indicating the deprotonation of the \u00bc NeNH group, while the signals of the other NH (PhNH) protons were observed at the same field (d 9.80e10.69 ppm). The signals of the HC]N protons shift to downfield in all complexes and appeared at 8.48e9.09 ppm. This information indicates the coordination of the metal center to the azomethine nitrogen and the thioamide sulfur and the PhNH group is not coordinated to the metal ion [51] . All aromatic protons were observed at the expected region (d 7.15e8.25 ppm) in the NMR spectrum of the thiosemicarbazone ligands. These signals do not afford relevant changes in the chemical shifts for the platinum(II) and palladium(II) complexes.\n\nFurthermore, the 13 C NMR spectra of the ligands were recorded in DMSO-d 6 and gave the spectral signals in good agreement with the probable chemical structure. All ligands exhibited two important signals at d 174.22e176.21 and d 137.28e140.65 ppm assigned to the thioamide (C]S) and imine (C]N) carbon atoms, respectively [52] . The signals at d 123.60e156.22 ppm were observed in the spectra due to the aromatic carbons.\n\nThe MS spectra of the free ligands (1e5) and their complexes (1ae5a and 1be5b) were recorded by electro spray impact (ESI) in positive ion mode. The mass fragmentation routes of compound 2 is given in Scheme 2.\n\nThe mass spectrum of compound 2 confirms the proposed molecular structure by showing a peak at m/z 296 corresponding to the molecular ion [M \u00fe H] \u00fe . The other thiosemicarbazone derivatives also showed the similar fragmentation pathway as given in Fig. 2 .\n\nA general splitting pathway with the characteristic peaks was observed by the platinum(II) and palladium(II) complexes 1ae5a and 1be5b. The spectra of all complexes showed several informative fragment ions confirming their molecular weights. The molecular ion peaks were conformed to [M] \u00fe or [M \u00fe H] \u00fe and the major fragmentation pathway involved the leaving of PtCl 2 or PdCl 2 [53] .\n\nTGA thermograms of complexes (1ae5a and 1be5b) were recorded under nitrogen with a heating rate of 10 C/min between 30 C and 900 C. All complexes did not lose weight up to 230 C. Further increment of the temperature causes decomposition of these complexes in two steps [54] . The first step being 250e415 C for the palladium(II) and platinum(II) complexes where losses of mixed fragments are observed. The second step starts after the first step and continues until complete decomposition of the ligands and formation of MS [where, M \u00bc Pd(II) and Pt(II)]. The total weight loss of all complexes depends on the loss of the respective ligand, after one sulfur atom moving to the metal ion and residues conversion to the palladium sulfide and platinum sulfide.\n\nThe biological activity of the newly synthesized complexes were tested in terms of cytotoxic and antiviral activity compared with the free ligands.\n\nThe all compounds were examined for their cytostatic activity against human lymphocyte (CEM), human cervix carcinoma (HeLa), Crandell feline kidney (CRFK), Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) and human lung fibroblast (HEL) cells and their activity results were given Table 4 .\n\nAmong (Table 4) .\n\nRegarding toxicity, it is striking that the ligands 2e5 (IC 50 :\n\n2.4e163 mM) and their platinum complexes 1ae5a (IC 50 : 1.7e105 mM)\n\nwere consistently more cytostatic than palladium complexes 1be5b (IC 50 : 13.3e385 mM). Also, these compounds are clearly cytostatic (inhibition of cell proliferation) rather than cytotoxic (microscopically visible alteration of cell morphology).\n\nThe compounds 2e5, platinum(II) complexes 1ae5a and palladium (II) complexes 1be5b were also evaluated for their antiviral activity against a wide variety of DNA and RNA viruses, including herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) (strain KOS), HSV-2 (strain G), vaccinia virus, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV) strains OKA and 07/1 and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) strains AD-169 and Davis in HEL cell cultures, VSV, Coxsackie B4 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in HeLa cell cultures, parainfluenza-3, reovirus-1, Sindbis virus, Coxsackie B4 and Punta Toro virus in Vero cell cultures, influenza A (H1N1, H3N2) influenza B virus in MDCK cell cultures and feline coronavirus (FIPV) and feline herpes virus in CrFK cell cultures and their activities were compared with those of ganciclovir and cidofovir. Unfortunately, none of the compounds tested were endowed with appreciable inhibitory activity at subtoxic concentrations except for compound Therefore, the observed anti-HCMV activity may well be due to an indirect cytostatic activity of the compounds rather than a specific antiviral activity. No specific antiviral effect was noted for any compounds evaluated against other viruses (data not given). \n\nWe have prepared a series of 5-substitutedthiophene-2carboxaldeyhde thiosemicarbazones and their platinum(II) and palladium(II) complexes. In conclusion, none of the new compounds showed antiviral potency at subtoxic concentrations except for 1b that showed slight inhibitory activity against HCMV at 2.9e15.3 mM.\n\nSeveral compounds in particular 4a were endowed with significant cytostatic potency (IC 50 : 1.7 mM for HeLa cell cultures) and can be viewed as new lead compounds for further modifications. The other ligands and their platinum complexes were showed only moderate cytostatic activity in the lower micromolar range.\n\nAll reactions were monitored by thin layer chromatography (TLC) using Merck silica gel 60 F 254 plates. Chemicals and solvents purchased from Aldrich, Fluka and Riedel de Haen. Melting points were determined by EZ-Melt melting point apparatus and were uncorrected. Electronic spectra were recorded in DMF on a PG Instruments T80\u00fe UVevisible Spectrophometer. IR spectra on KBr disks were recorded on a Perkin Elmer 1620 model FT-IR spectrophotometer. Elemental analyses (C,H,N,S) were performed on a VarioMICRO elemental analyzer. 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra were obtained at room temperature with a Brucker AVANC-DPX-400 MHz NMR spectrometer in DMSO-d 6 using TMS as an internal standard. The chemical shift values are given in ppm and following abbreviations were used: s \u00bc singlet, d \u00bc doublet, dd \u00bc double doublet, t \u00bc triplet, m \u00bc multiplet. The coupling constants (J) are given in Hertz. The mass spectra of all compounds were recorded on an Agilent 1100 MSD spectrometer in the electro spray mode. Thermogravimetric analysis of the complexes were performed by a Shimadzu TGA 50 thermogravimetric analyzer under nitrogen atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 C/min.\n\nTo a hot solution of 4-substituted-N-phenylthiosemicarbazide (5.98 mmol) in methanol (30 mL) was added dropwise a solution of the corresponding 5-substituted-2-thiophene carboxaldehydes (5.98 mmol) in methanol (5 mL) during 15 min. The reaction mixture was refluxed and the progress of the reaction was followed by TLC (about 10 h) and cooled. After cooling the product was filtered and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude product was recrystallized from methanol.\n\nYellow solid (methanol). Yield: 85%. m.p.: 188e190 C. Anal. calc. \n\nThe antiviral assays were based on the inhibition of virusinduced cytopathicity in confluent cell cultures, and the cytostatic assays on inhibition of tumor cell proliferation in exponentially growing tumor cell cultures according to previously described methodology [55e57].\n\nThe antiviral assays, other than the anti-HIV assays, were based on inhibition of virus-induced cytopathicity in HEL [herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) (KOS), HSV-2 (G), vaccinia virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV)], Vero (parainfluenza-3, reovirus-1, Sindbis virus and Coxsackie B4), HeLa (vesicular stomatitis virus, Coxsackie virus B4, and respiratory syncytial virus), MDCK [influenza A (H1N1; H3N2) and influenza B] or CrFK (feline coronavirus (FIPV) and feline herpes virus) cell cultures. Confluent cell cultures (or nearly confluent for MDCK cells) in microtiter 96-well plates were inoculated with 100 CCID 50 of virus (1 CCID 50 being the virus dose to infect 50% of the cell cultures) in the presence of varying concentrations (100, 20, 4, . mM) of the test compounds. Viral cytopathicity was recorded as soon as it reached completion in the control virus-infected cell cultures that were not treated with the test compounds. The minimal cytotoxic concentration (MCC) of the compounds was defined as the compound concentration that caused a microscopically visible alteration of cell morphology. The inhibitory concentration-50 (IC 50 ) was defined as the compound concentration required to inhibit cell proliferation by 50%. The methodology of the anti-HIV assays was as follows: human CEM (w3 \u00c2 10 5 cells/cm 3 ) cells were infected with 100 CCID 50 of HIV(III B ) or HIV-2(ROD)/ml and seeded in 200 mL wells of a microtiter plate containing appropriate dilutions of the test compounds. After 4 days of incubation at 37 C, HIV-induced CEM giant cell formation was examined microscopically. Antiviral activity was expressed as the concentration required to reduce virus-induced cytopathogenicity by 50% (EC 50 ).\n\nCytostatic activity against CEM (human T-lymphocytes) and HeLa (human cervix carcinoma) cell lines were measured essentially as originally described for the mouse leukemia cell lines [8] . Human lymphocyte CEM and human cervix carcinoma HeLa cells were seeded in 96-well microtiter plates at 75,000 (CEM) or 20,000 (HeLa) cells per 200 mL-well in the presence of different concentrations of the test compounds. After 3 (CEM) or 4 (HeLa) days, the viable cell number was counted using a Coulter counter apparatus. The 50% cytostatic concentration (CC 50 ) was defined as the compound concentration required to inhibit tumor cell proliferation by 50%.\n\nCytotoxicity measurements were based on the inhibition of MDCK, HEL, CRFK, Vero and HeLa cell growth. Cells were seeded at 5 \u00c2 10 3 cells/well into 96-well microtiter plates. Then, medium containing different concentrations of the test compounds was added. After 3 days of incubation at 37 C, the alteration of morphology of the cell cultures was recorded microscopically. Cytotoxicity was expressed as minimum cytotoxic concentration (MCC) or the compound concentration that causes a microscopically detectable alteration of normal cell morphology."}
