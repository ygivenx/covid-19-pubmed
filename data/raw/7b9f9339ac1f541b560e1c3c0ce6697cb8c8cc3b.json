{"title": "Viruses causing lower respiratory symptoms in children younger than 2-years of age: 1 findings from the ORChID birth cohort. 2", "body": "Supplementary Text 1: Details of specimen collection, processing, polymerase chain reaction 21 assays, quality control measures, and assay parameters used to identify respiratory viruses. 22 Supplementary Text 2: Calculation of attributable fraction in the exposed (AFE). Each swab was resuspended in 2mL of phosphate buffered saline from which 200\u00b5L was used for 52 nucleic acid extraction. After being spiked with EHV, samples were extracted on the QIAxtractor 53 automated high-throughput extraction platform using DX reagents according to the manufacturer's 54 instructions (Qiagen, Australia). Total DNA and RNA were eluted into 150\u00b5L of elution buffer. polyomaviruses WU/KI, and human bocavirus-1) used an identical set of master mix and cycling 59 conditions. In brief, 8pmol of each primer, 3.2pmol of the respective probe(s), and 2\u00b5L of template 60 were made in a 20\u00b5L final reaction volume using the Bioline Sensi Mix II Probe PCR mix kit 61 (Bioline, Australia), and followed cycling conditions of: activation at 94\u00b0C for 2-minutes, followed 62 by 45 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15-seconds and 60\u00b0C for 60-seconds.\n\nFor RNA viruses, real-time one-step reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) assays were used 65 following a common protocol for all, but influenza and human rhinovirus (HRV) assays. In brief, 66 8pmol of each primer, 3.2pmol of the respective probe(s), and 2\u00b5L of template were made in a 67 20\u00b5L final reaction volume using the Bioline SensiFAST Probe One-Step RT-PCR kit (Bioline, 68 Australia), and followed cycling conditions of: 45\u00b0C reverse transcriptase incubation for 69 20-minutes, 95\u00b0C activation for 2-minutes, followed by 45 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15-seconds and 60\u00b0C 70 for 60-seconds. The single deviation from the common RT-PCR protocol in the influenza A/B 71 reaction was use of asymmetric amounts of influenza A and B probes (6.4pmol and 3.2pmol, 72 respectively).\n\nA concentration of 16pmol of each primer, as well as magnesium chloride additive of the same 75 concentration, were utilised along with 2pmol of the respective probe in the HRV assay. The 76 cycling conditions for the RT-PCR were as follows: 45\u00b0C reverse transcriptase incubation for 77 20-minutes, 94\u00b0C activation for 2-minutes, followed by 55 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15-seconds to 78 denature and 60\u00b0C for 60-seconds for the annealing step. Reactions were performed on ABI 7500 and Viia7 instruments (Life Technologies, Australia), as well as the Qiagen Rotorgene Q (Qiagen 80 Australia).\n\nSamples positive for HRV were genotyped using methods described previously. 4,5 Briefly, this 82 involved sequencing the variable region of VP4/VP2 genes using a nested PCR assay with two sets 83 of primers. 6 Samples that could not be amplified twice by the VP4/VP2 assay were further 84 investigated by amplifying a 390 nucleotide fragment from the 5'UTR segment. 7 PCR products 85 were purified (QIAquick PCR purification kit, Qiagen, Australia) and submitted for DNA The risk of having symptoms given that a child is virus-positive = a/(a+b)\n\nThe risk of having symptoms given that a child is virus negative = c/(c+d)\n\nThe risk ratio of having symptoms if a child is virus-positive compared to if they are virus-141 negative is a/(a+b)/c/(c+d)\n\nAttributable fraction in the exposed is 100% * (a/a+b)-(c/c+d)\n\n(a/a+b)\n\nThe AFE can also be written in terms of the risk ratio ( \n\nvalues >38 excluded (n=7,856).\n\nRisk ratio a (95% CI)\n\nAttributable fraction in the exposed (%)\n\nAttributable fraction in the exposed (%) Single new detections All HRV Table 3 "}
