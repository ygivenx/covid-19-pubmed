Comparative numbers of virus particles in purified preparations of HCoV-OC43 and BCoV as determined by quantitative EM and plaque assay (each for equivalents of 15 mU esterase) and by semiquantitative real-time RT-PCR (relative genome content). All measurements are based on independent experiments performed at least in triplicate.

Supplemental Experimental Procedures pNPA assay. HE esterase activity towards 4-nitrophenyl acetate (pNPA) was determined by detection of the chromogenic p-nitrophenolate anion (pNP) that is formed upon hydrolysis (Vlasak et al., 1987) . Briefly, 50 ng HE was incubated with 1 mM pNPA in PBS and the amount of pNP was determined spectrophotometrically at 405 nm every 20 sec for 15 min. Assays were corrected for spontaneous hydrolysis of pNPA. One unit was defined as the amount of enzymatic activity resulting in the cleavage of 1 \u00b5mol of pNPA per min. The specific activities of the varies HE + -Fc proteins were expressed in mU/\u00b5g of protein and shown in graphs as percentages of wildtype BCoV HE + -Fc activity. USA/1967 were constructed by targeted RNA recombination (Kuo et al., 2000) and propagated in LR7 cells (Lissenberg et al., 2005) . BCoV strain Mebus and OC43 strain USA/1967, obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, were propagated in HRT-18 cells.\n\nstocks of purified viruses were prepared by inoculating cell monolayers at an MOI of 0.01 PFU/cell for 1 hr. Virus-containing cell culture supernatants (Opti-MEM; Gibco), harvested at 18 hr (rMuCoVs) or 72 hr after infection (BCoV-Mebus and OC43 USA/1967), were clarified by consecutive centrifugation at 1200rpm, 4\u00b0C for 5 min and at 4000 rpm, 4\u00b0C for 10 min. Virions were purified and concentrated by their centrifugation through 20% (w/v) sucrose cushions (80,000g, 2 hr, 4\u00b0C), and resuspended in PBS. Aliquots were stored at -80\u00b0C. BCoV and OC43 preparations were assessed for particle content by qPCR (SYBR Green real-time PCR (Life Technologies) using primers 5'-TGCAAATTACGCGGCAAG-3' and 5'-AACCAATGCCAGCAACACTAGC-3', plaque assay in HRT18 cells, quantitative latex bead ratio electron microscopy (EM) , and by pNPA esterase activity assay.\n\nCrystallization and X-ray data collection. OC43 NL/A/2005 HE crystals with P3 2 21 spacegroup were grown at 20\u00b0C using sitting drop vapor diffusion against a well solution containing 0.2M NaCl, 10mM KCl, 0.1M NaAc pH 5.0 and 20% PEG6000 (w/v). Crystals were cryoprotected in well solution containing 20% (v/v) glycerol before flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data to 2.45 \u00c5 resolution were collected at the Swiss Light Source (Villigen, Switzerland) on the PX beamline and integrated with Mosflm (Leslie and Powell, 2007) . Integrated diffraction data were further processed using the CCP4 package (Winn et al., 2011) . The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the BCoV-Mebus HE structure (PDB ID: 3CL5) as search model (Zeng et al., 2008) .\n\nModels were refined using REFMAC (Vagin et al., 2004 ) alternated with manual model improvement using COOT (Emsley et al., 2010) . Refinement procedures included TLS refinement using one TLS group for each of the HE monomers in the asymmetric unit.\n\nThe resulting crystal structure had R work and R free final values of 21.2% and 25.0%.\n\nStatistics of data processing and refinement are listed in sTable 1."}
