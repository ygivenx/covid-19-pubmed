{"title": "Original Article", "body": "In 1998, a triple-reassortant swine influenza virus from human, swine, and avian genomes was identified in the USA [1] . Ten years later, humans were found to be infected with these influenza viruses [2] . A novel human influenza A (H1N1) virus caused a worldwide respiratory disease outbreak in April 2009. The major transmission route for influenza virus is via respiratory droplets released while coughing [3e5] . Influenza virus replicates in the epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract, which destroys the host cells, further spreading to infect other cells. The clinical manifestations of influenza are fever, headache, myalgia, fatigue, rhinorrhea, sore throat, and cough. The impact of influenza outbreaks is much higher in children than in adults. Most healthy adults will recover after 3e7 days [6e8] . Influenza A/H3N2 was the predominant serotype during the 2010e2011 season, whereas the A/H1N1 2009 virus still cocirculated with the A/H3N2 and influenza B strains [9] . The pandemic influenza A/H1N1 outbreak resulted in over 18,449 deaths in over 214 countries until 2012 [10, 11] .\n\nConventional diagnostic testing of influenza virus included virus incubation and nucleic acid amplification test. Virus incubation is the first method used to diagnose virus infections, while it takes about 7 days to amplify the virus in the host cells. A nucleic acid amplification test is the most sensitive method to detect virus infection, but pretreatment of the sample, including virus isolation and nucleic extraction, still requires about 1 day. The above methods are not suitable for the rapid screening of influenza virus [12] . In vitro diagnostic devices (IVDs) play crucial roles in disease diagnosis because of their rapid and convenient properties. Diagnostic accuracy of IVDs is dependent on their sensitivity and specificity. A previous study evaluated the 3M rapid detection test for the respiratory syncytial virus, and found the sensitivity and specificity of the device to be 74% and 100%, respectively [13] . In April 2011, a study conducted by Iregbu et al [14] on the performance of Dual Path Platform testing kits revealed a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 99.5%. By contrast, a study by Shrivastava et al [15] reported that the commercial Dengue NS1 antigen kit had a sensitivity of 26% against 91 clinical samples. Few studies have reported the sensitivity of influenza IVDs (Flu-IVDs) in detecting influenza A. These previous studies used four commercialized rapid test kits [16e20].\n\nFlu-IVD rapid test kits are based on immunochromatographic tests. This type of IVD is designed for easy and fast operation, which enables physicians to obtain results at the primary influenza screening sites. The Flu-IVD rapid test kits have been classified into a low-risk class I device according to the medical device regulation and risk assessment in Taiwan. They are applied and approved by the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for pre-market approvals via the fast tract pathway, that is, they are exempt from the substantial performance review.\n\nIn this study, we collected Taiwan-FDA-approved Flu-IVDs from the Taiwanese market and evaluated their performance. The standard antigens prepared from viral cultures and purified hemagglutinins (HAs) were used to evaluate the analytical sensitivity and specificity of the Flu-IVDs. The results represent the actual responses of these rapid test kits and provided references for future amendments in regulations. \n\nFlu-IVDs were purchased directly from the manufacturers and local distributors in 1e3 different lots. The product name, lot number, and manufacturing country of each Flu-IVD are listed in Tables 1 and 2.\n\nThe appearance of the products and the labels on the Flu-IVDs were compared with information on their licenses, including Chinese and English names, license numbers, name of manufacturer, address of manufacturer, and expiration dates.\n\nSensitivity was assayed as described previously, with modifications [21] . The sensitivity of the collected Flu-IVDs was specified as HA concentrations or CCID 50 . The HA standards consisting of Influenza Antigens A/California/7/2009 (H1N1), A/Victoria/210/2009 (H3N2) and B/Brisbane/60/08 were diluted individually to 0.25e50,000 ng/mL, 0.25e13,000 ng/mL, and 0.25e13,500 ng/mL, respectively, with the dilution buffer provided in the Flu-IVDs. Additionally, the influenza A/ Taiwan/9042/2008 (H1N1) and A/Taiwan/439/2009 (H3N2) viruses were prepared from infected rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells and diluted to concentrations of 101.3e105.3 CCID 50 /mL and 101.23e107.23 CCID 50 /mL, respectively, with minimum essential medium (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA). The sensitivity assay of each Flu-IVD, including the positive and negative controls, was carried out by following the instructions in j o u r n a l o f f o o d a n d d r u g a n a l y s i s 2 2 ( 2 0 1 4 ) 2 7 9 e2 8 4 the operation manuals. Two independent and well-trained technicians performed the experiments.\n\nHCoV-OC43 was prepared from infected MRC-5 cells. The extract containing 1 \u00c2 107 CCID 50 /mL of virus was used to evaluate the specificity of Flu-IVDs. The experimental protocol was carried out in accordance with the operation manuals of each Flu-IVDs. Two independent and well-training researchers carried out the experiments.\n\nFlu-IVDs are classified as class 1 medical devices, indicating that the license could be easily obtained through document reviews. Therefore, the quality of Flu-IVDs needs to be investigated and monitored. In Taiwan, suspected influenza patients are immediately tested with Flu-IVDs at the primary screening site in epidemics areas. The therapeutic strategies are divided into two parts based on the test results. If the test result is positive and the patient exhibits influenza-like symptoms, the patient is immediately administered antiviral drugs such as osletamivir (Tamiflu) and continuously monitored with Flu PCR test kits. However, negative test results indicate that the patient only has a common cold, and no antiviral drug treatment is given. The use of Flu-IVDs plays a crucial role in controlling influenza epidemics. Hence, falsepositive outcomes may cause inappropriate administration of osletamivir, which could lead to future challenges in the prevention of influenza. Prior to 2009, several commercial Flu-IVD rapid test kits were approved in Taiwan. However, after the influenza A/H1N1 pandemics in 2009, the Taiwan FDA issued many licenses for similar products. We thus aimed to examine the analytical sensitivity and specificity of Flu A-IVDs used in Taiwan.\n\nA total of 38 products with 19 Flu-IVD licenses were collected, of which seven were domestic and 31 were imported Flu-IVDs. Product labels of 20 samples did not comply with the regulations in Taiwan FDA. For example, those with unsatisfactory product labels lacked a product name and/or license number on the packaging or buffer containers. Some products had no package insert in them, and some package inserts did not indicate the sensitivity of the product. The percentage of unsatisfactory product labels in domestic and imported kits was 43% (3/7) and 55% (17/31), respectively.\n\nBased on the reaction principles, the detecting targets of the collected samples were grouped as HA and viral particles. The Flu-IVDs belonging to the HA group were evaluated for their analytical sensitivity with the World Health Organization (WHO) international standard Influenza Antigens A/California/7/2009 (H1N1), A/Victoria/210/2009 (H3N2), and B/Brisbane/60/08. As shown in Table 3 , seven products of three Flu-IVD licenses (AeC) that were manufactured in the USA and Spain used HA concentrations as their sensitivity label. The analytical sensitivity of these Flu-IVDs against A/H1N1, A/ H3N2, and Flu B was 500e1000 ng/mL, 1000 ng/mL, and 1000 ng/mL, respectively. For A/H1N1 detection, products A j o u r n a l o f f o o d a n d d r u g a n a l y s i s 2 2 ( 2 0 1 4 ) 2 7 9 e2 8 4 and B displayed higher analytical sensitivity than product C. The sensitivity results for A/H3N2 and Flu B were identical in these samples. We obtained seven products from three domestic Flu-IVDs (DeF) and 17 products from eight Flu-IVDs (GeN) imported from China, the UK, Finland, Singapore, USA, and Korea with CCID 50 labels. In the past 5 years, type A/ Taiwan/439/2009 (H3N2) and type A/Taiwan/9042/2008 (H1N1) were the two main strains of influenza outbreak in Taiwan. Hence, these two virus strains were used as influenza viral particle standards for CCID 50 test [22] . The averages of A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 sensitivity were log 10 5.8 AE 0.5 CCID 50 /mL and log 10 6.6 AE 0.5 CCID 50 /mL, respectively. In Fig. 1 , the unbroken, broken, and dotted lines represent the mean, mean AE 1 standard deviation (SD) and mean AE 2 SD in the sensitivity tests, respectively. For A/H1N1, the sensitivity of all products was within mean AE 1 SD (Fig. 1A) . As to A/H3N2 sensitivity, however, the products E, I, L, and M fell into the mean AE 2 SD range (Fig. 1B) . Seven products from five imported Flu-IVDs did not have test sensitivity labeling. Therefore, HA concentrations were used to determine their sensitivities. In Table 4 , the sensitivities of these seven samples against H1N1, H3N2, and Flu B were 500e1000 ng/mL, 500e3250 ng/mL, and 1000e6750 ng/mL, respectively. Previous researchers have used clinical specimens to monitor the clinical performance of Flu-IVDs. A study by Drexler et al [17] found that BinaxNow Influenza A&B Rapid Test Kits had a poor clinical sensitivity; the sensitivity was 11.1% for the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus (16 positive cases against 144 polymerase-chain-reaction-confirmed cases). A study by Uyeki et al [20] also showed that the QuickVue Influenza A \u00fe B Test had a low sensitivity (27%) for the detection of both influenza A and B viruses. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention screened 45 specimens with positive results for novel influenza A (H1N1) using Directigen EZ Flu A \u00fe B and obtained a sensitivity of 49% [23] .\n\nWe assumed that one of the reasons for the discrepancies was that the human epidemic strains of influenza viruses used in the Flu-IVDs did not match the current influenza virus outbreak strains. Pandemic influenza virus strains varied from year to year and from country to country. For example, the influenza A/Texas/1/77 strain was used as the master influenza virus strain to develop the monoclonal antibodies in the BinaxNow Influenza A&B Rapid Test; however, the major virus strain that caused the influenza outbreak in Taiwan was the type A/Taiwan/439/2009 (H3N2) and type A/Taiwan/9042/ 2008 (H1N1). Other Flu-IVDs failed to mention the master influenza virus strain used in their preparations. Therefore, inappropriate master influenza virus strains used in the Flu-IVD preparations may contribute to the low detection sensitivity. Moreover, studies have shown that analytical sensitivity did not directly reflect the clinical sensitivity on patient specimens. The analytical sensitivity of influenza H5N1 detection and seasonal influenza was the same, although their clinical performances were poor [23, 24] . Manufacturers j o u r n a l o f f o o d a n d d r u g a n a l y s i s 2 2 ( 2 0 1 4 ) 2 7 9 e2 8 4\n\nshould follow WHO recommendations for the annually pandemic influenza virus strains to be used in their preparation of the Flu-IVDs in order to improve the quality. We also suggest that the class level for Flu-IVDs in Taiwan for government regulations be elevated so that the government can monitor the quality of IVDs using a lot release system. Furthermore, Taiwan FDA should establish a reference or proficiency panel to evaluate in vitro Flu-IVDs in the near future.\n\nPatients suffering from respiratory illness such as cough, asthma, and emphysema are usually diagnosed with acute respiratory tract infections. Viruses such as influenza virus, coronavirus, and respiratory syncytial virus commonly cause respiratory tract infections [25] . Several studies have conducted a specificity test by real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis for different respiratory-tract-infection-related viruses [26, 27] . The specificity of Flu-IVDs played an important role in the selective interaction of influenza A and B viruses.\n\nAccording to the epidemiological studies, HCoV caused >15% of common colds in adults, of which OC43 was the most common [28] . Hence, we used the common HCoV-OC43 to determine the specificity of Flu-IVDs in this study and the result showed that not all Flu-IVDs cross-reacted with HCoV-OC43, suggesting good specificity (Table 5 ).\n\nIn conclusion, seven domestic and 31 imported Flu-IVDs were collected to analyze the sensitivity and specificity. Analytical sensitivity of Flu-IVDs for A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and Flu B was 500e1000 ng/mL, 1000 ng/mL, and 1000 ng/mL, respectively. Average sensitivity of A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 for Flu-IVDs was log 10 5.8 AE 0.5 CCID 50 /mL and log 10 6.6 AE 0.5 CCID 50 /mL, respectively. No products cross-reacted with HCoV-OC43. Our results could provide more information for future policymaking strategies and preparedness against seasonal and pandemic influenza.
