{"title": "Fatal measles pneumonitis during Hodgkin's lymphoma", "body": "The treatment of measles pneumonitis in immunocompromised adults is not established. We describe a patient with Hodgkin's lymphoma who developed acute pneumonia during a measles infection. On day 13, intravenous ribavirin and immunoglobulins were administrated. On day 18, the patient developed acute respiratory failure. An examination of transbronchial pulmonary biopsies showed Warthin-Finkeldey giant cells that are pathognomonic of measles pneumonitis. The patient died despite aggressive supportive care. Our case and a review of literature show that measles pneumonitis is routinely fatal in patients with cancer. We suggest that antiviral drugs should be considered as soon as the diagnosis has been established.\n\nFrom 2008 to 2011, more than 30 000 cases of measles were reported in Europe. 1 In 2012, the epidemics was still ongoing with 8230 cases reported to the European Center for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC). 1 France, Italy, Romania, Spain and the UK accounted for 94% of the cases. In 2013, outbreaks have been reported in Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Italy, the UK (England and Wales), Lithuania and The Netherlands. 2 In France, most cases occurred in children and young adults. 3 Overall, about 4980 patients were hospitalised, including 1023 for severe pneumonia and 27 for encephalitis/myelitis, and 10 patients died. 3 In adults with cancer, measles is frequently atypical and leads to progressive giant cell pneumonia, encephalitis and death. 4 5 Two fatal cases of measles pneumonitis have been reported in adults with cancer but none of them received any antiviral drug. We report on a case of measles pneumonitis in a patient with Hodgkin's lymphoma who received ribavirin as well as immunoglobulins.\n\nA young man in his early 20s was admitted to our hospital for a suspected measles. He had no history of measles vaccination. Three months earlier, he had been diagnosed with stage IV Hodgkin's lymphoma with mediastinal lymph nodes and pulmonary excavation in the left apical lobe. Cultures of respiratory samples were negative for bacteria, mycobacteria and fungi and no respiratory viruses were detectable (influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, coronavirus and adenovirus). After completion of a first BEACOPP escalated (bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine and prednisone) chemotherapy cycle, the patient was discharged home.\n\nTwo days after starting the second cycle of chemotherapy, the patient experienced fever (38-39\u00b0C) with sore throat and conjunctivitis (day 1 of characteristic illness) ( figure 1 ). An erythematous rash rapidly spread from the face to the trunk. No Koplik's spots were observed. A diagnosis of measles was considered and the patient was referred to the Infectious Diseases Unit.\n\nSerological studies were negative for IgG and IgM antibodies to measles. The measles virus (MVs/ Villejuif.FRA/20.10(D4)) was detected from nasal swabs by real time reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR. After sequencing 456 base-pairs of the nucleocapsid gene, the strain was indistinguishable from the genotype D4 (MVs/Montaigu.FRA/43.08) circulating in France.\n\nOn day 3, febrile neutropenia occurred with a nadir at 100/mm 3 . Piperacillin/tazobactam was started. On day 8, the neutrophil cell count increased to >500/mm 3 and the patient experienced progressive shortness of breath. A chest-CT scan visualised a bilateral interstitial infiltrate. On day 10, a fibreoptic bronchoscopy showed bronchial inflammation. A microscopical examination of the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid showed leucocytes at 150/mm 3 Because of worsening of the respiratory failure, the patient was ventilated in a prone position, received inhaled nitric oxide and finally required veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) on day 22. Ribavirin was stopped after 12 days of therapy because of its lack of efficacy on the course of the disease and the occurrence of haemolytic anaemia. On day 31, a ventilated-associated pneumonia was suspected. Culture of BAL grew P aeruginosa; MV was still detectable by PCR amplification. Ceftazidime and amikacin were started. On day 41, the patient died from an unexplained refractory hypotension associated with renal failure and severe metabolic acidosis attributed to propofol (propofol-related infusion syndrome) used at high doses for sedation under ECMO.\n\nWe report on a case of measles pneumonitis during the treatment of an advanced-stage Hodgkin's lymphoma. Intravenous administration of ribavirin and immunoglobulins, 5 days after the onset of the pneumonitis, did not prevent a subsequent fatal outcome.\n\nIn severe immunocompromised adults, only five cases of measles pneumonitis have been reported, including four deaths (case death of 80%). 4 6-8 The underlying diseases were advanced HIV infection (n=3), lymphoma (n=1) and chemotherapyinduced neutropenia for rhabdomyosarcoma (n=1). Factors predicting a poor outcome have not been examined in the literature. In our patient, the following conditions may have predisposed to a fatal outcome: (1) Hodgkin's lymphoma unresponsive to chemotherapy; (2) profound chemotherapy-induced neutropenia at the onset of the rash; and (3) sustained MV-induced immune suppression that was responsible for prolonged lymphocyte depletion (<250/mm 3 ) for 24 days worsening the patient's immune status.\n\nOur patient was unable to mount an adequate immune response, as shown by the negative serological tests on day 10. Therefore, measles were diagnosed using a real time RT-PCR validated to detect MV in clinical specimens but not for patient management. 9 The shedding of the MV into the lungs of immunocompromised patients has not yet been reported. 10 Although our RT-PCR was designed for diagnosis but not to quantify the viral load, the results of analyses suggest that the treatments lacked efficacy. Indeed, that viral shedding lasted for weeks at a significant concentration despite aggressive treatment. Figure 1 Clinical events, evolution of biological markers and treatments given to a patient with measles and advanced Hodgkin's lymphoma. The horizontal line shows an absolute neutrophil count of 500 cells/mL which is a major risk factor for invasive aspergillosis. BAL: bronchoalveolar lavage. Our patient received ribavirin as well as intravenous immunoglobulins. None of the two previously reported patients with malignant diseases received any antiviral drugs. A patient with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and a patient with rhabdomyosarcoma died from pneumonia. 4 7 Conversely, all three HIV-infected patients were treated with ribavirin and/or immunoglobulins. 6 8 One patient, who was treated with ribavirin before respiratory deterioration and immunoglobulins after endotracheal intubation, survived the disseminated measles, 8 while the other two, who received ribavirin after mechanical ventilation, had fatal outcomes. 6 These cases and ours suggest that ribavirin and immunoglobulins should be considered for use in patients with severely impaired cellular immunity as soon as the diagnosis of measles is established.\n\nVaccination is the best way to prevent measles, but the live-attenuated virus vaccine is contraindicated in immunocompromised patients, such as those with malignant tumours or receiving immunosuppressive therapies. Immunity to measles should probably be checked in patients with immune deficiency in the context of epidemics. Those without circulating neutralising antibodies should be advised to seek prompt medical attention if they suspect or have evidence of exposure to measles to receive postexposure prophylactics with intravenous immunoglobulins. Although treatment efficiency of measles pneumonitis in severely immunocompromised patients has not been established, the high likelihood of a fatal outcome may justify early treatment.\n\n\u25b8 Measles pneumonitis is frequently fatal in immunocompromised hosts. \u25b8 Given the mostly fatal outcomes when measles occur in immune compromised patients, treatment should be tried as soon as possible. \u25b8 Vaccination should be administered at least 4 weeks before the initiation of immunosuppressive therapy."}
