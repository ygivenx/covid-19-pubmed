{"title": "Oseltamivir-Resistant Influenza Viruses A (H1N1) during 2007\u20132009 Influenza Seasons, Japan", "body": "Influenza sentinel clinics send clinical specimens to local public health laboratories for virus isolation. Several culture tissues, including MDCK, Caco-2, and LLC-MK2, are used for virus isolation. Without successful viral isolation, clinical specimens are analyzed directly. Influenza viruses were collected from all 47 prefectures in Japan for this study; 1,734 samples of influenza A (H1N1) were isolated during the 2007\u201308 season (September 2007\u2013August 2008) and 1,482 samples of influenza A (H1N1) were isolated in the 2008\u201309 season (September 2008\u2013April 2009). During the 2007\u201308 season, viruses were isolated primarily after December 2007. All influenza viruses A (H1N1) were subjected to full or partial (nt 615\u20131076) NA sequencing to detect H275Y substitution on the N1 NA protein. Representative influenza viruses A (H1N1), including ORVs and OSVs, were subjected to NA inhibition assay (number of tested viruses isolated during the 2007\u201308 and 2008\u201309 seasons was 306 and 58, respectively), full NA sequencing (891 and 83), hemagglutinin (HA) 1 sequencing (299 and 83), M2 sequencing (288 and 79), and hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) test (187 and 59).\n\nThe phylogenetic tree of NA and HA1 genes was constructed by neighbor-joining methods. The phylogenetic tree was described by representative ORVs and OSVs isolated from several prefectures in Japan. Sequence information for isolates from other countries was obtained from the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data and the Los Alamos National Laboratory database. All amino acid positions in the phylogenetic tree were described by N1 numbering.\n\nThe chemiluminescent NA inhibition assay was performed by using the NA Star Kit (Applied Biosystems, Tokyo, Japan) with slight modifications of the instructions provided by the manufacturer. The final drug concentration ranged from 0.03 nmol/L to 6,500 nmol/L for oseltamivir and from 0.03 nmol/L to 12,500 nmol/L for zanamivir. Chemiluminescent light emission was measured by using an LB940 plate reader (Berthhold Technologies, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Drug concentrations required to inhibit NA activity by 50% (IC50) were calculated by a 4-parameter method using MikroWin 2000 version 4 software (Mikrotek Laborsysteme GmbH, Overath, Germany).\n\nThe HI test was performed to evaluate the reactivity of ferret antiserum against 2008\u201309 vaccine strain A/Brisbane/59/2009, as described by the WHO manual (17). Antiserum was treated by receptor-destroying enzyme II (Denka Seiken, Tokyo, Japan) and adsorbed with packed turkey erythrocytes before testing to prevent nonspecific reaction. A 0.5% suspension of turkey erythrocytes was used for the HI test. Viruses with >8-fold reduced HI titer to the homologous titer of A/Brisbane/59/2009 antiserum were regarded as antigenic variants.\n\nTo determine the cutoff value between NAI-resistant (outlier) and -sensitive viruses, box-and-whisker plots were used. The cutoff value was defined as upper quartile + 5.0\u00d7interquartile range from the 25th to 75th percentile. In this study, ORVs with H275Y were excluded from the overall population for statistical analysis. Outliers were excluded from the calculation of mean values and standard deviations for IC50.\n\nTo estimate the frequency of influenza A (H1N1) ORVs in each prefecture of Japan, 1,734 isolates during the 2007\u201308 season and 1,482 isolates during the 2008\u201309 season were collected from all prefectures and examined by NA sequencing to detect the H275Y mutation in NA protein. In the 2007\u201308 season, 45 viruses possessing H275Y mutation (total frequency of ORVs 2.6%; Figure 2, panel A) were observed in 10 prefectures, indicating that the frequency of ORVs was significantly lower than that in countries in Europe and the United States (8,11\u201314). In Tottori prefecture, however, 22 of 68 influenza viruses A (H1N1) tested possessed H275Y, showing a markedly higher frequency (32.4%) than that in other prefectures. In the 2008\u201309 season, however, ORVs were observed nationwide. Of 1,482 influenza viruses A (H1N1), 1,477 viruses possessed a H275Y mutation, for a total frequency of 99.7% (Figure 2, panel B). These data show that ORVs increased dramatically in Japan from the 2007\u201308 season to the 2008\u201309 season.\n\nInfluenza viruses A (H1N1) during 2007\u201308 fell into either clade 2B, including the current vaccine strain A/Brisbane/59/2007, or clade 2C, and almost all influenza viruses A (H1N1) during 2008\u201309 fell into clade 2B. Most ORVs with H275Y belong to clade 2B, which can be further divided into 2 distinct lineages by an aspartic acid to glycine substitution at aa 354: a Northern-Eu lineage sharing 354G, which was first isolated from countries in northern Europe and now represents most ORVs worldwide; and a Hawaii lineage sharing 354D, which was first detected in Hawaii and was rarely isolated in a few countries during the 2007\u201308 season (Appendix Figure). In the 2007\u201308 season, of 45 ORVs, 1 virus (A/Yokohama/91/2007) isolated in November 2007 belonged to clade 2C, and 44 viruses fell into either the Hawaii lineage or Northern-Eu lineage. Conversely, in the 2008\u201309 season, all ORVs belonged to the Northern-Eu lineage, indicating that ORVs of the Northern-Eu lineage dominated in the 2008\u201309 season in Japan.\n\nIn the Hawaii lineage, OSVs genetically close to ORVs were observed. The NA gene of some ORVs had only 1 nucleotide difference from that of OSV counterparts (i.e., A/Tochigi/8/2008 and A/Tochigi/9/2008, A/Nagano/1100/2008 and A/Nagano/1071/2008, A/Yamagata/68/2008 and A/Yamagata/41/2008, respectively), and the other ORVs are also genetically close to OSVs from Japan (Appendix Figure). These HA genes were also genetically identical or close together (Appendix Figure), suggesting that almost all ORVs from Japan with the Hawaii lineage are derived from OSVs from Japan. On the other hand, in the Northern-Eu lineage, OSV counterparts were not observed, but foreign ORVs genetically close to ORVs from Japan were observed. During the 2007\u201308 season, the NA gene of ORVs from Japan was close to that of ORVs isolated from countries in Europe (i.e., A/Paris/0341/2007 and A/England/26/2008). During the 2008\u201309 season, the ORVs from Japan, which shared A189T on HA protein, were further divided into 4 subclades (C-1 to C-4) by common amino acid changes on HA and/or NA (Appendix Figure). ORVs from Japan in C-2 and C-3 were genetically close to the ORVs isolated from North America or Hawaii (e.g., A/Memphis/03/2008 and A/Hawaii/19/2008), whereas ORVs in C-1, representing most influenza viruses A (H1N1) from the 2008\u201309 season in Japan, and ORVs in C-4 were close to ORVs isolated from South Africa and Australia in the Southern Hemisphere (e.g., A/Kenya/1432/2008 and A/Victoria/501/2008). All ORVs except C-3 were isolated before the emergence of ORVs from Japan in each subclade. These findings suggest that ORVs from Japan within a Northern-Eu lineage would not have emerged domestically but instead may have been introduced from various countries.\n\nOf the 364 viruses (306 isolates in the 2007\u201308 season and 58 isolates in the 2008\u201309 season) tested by NA inhibition assay, 101 possessed a H275Y substitution. With the NA inhibition assay, although precise IC50 values were calculated from a normal sigmoid curve (Figure 3, panels A and B), some viruses generated 2 types of unusual sigmoid curves (Figure 3, panels C and D) resulting from the mixed population of NAI-resistant and -sensitive viruses, as previously reported (18). Tentative IC50 values were calculated from type A curves (Figure 3, panel C) and included in overall statistical analysis, but values could not be calculated from type B curves (Figure 3, panel D). Later viruses were regarded as resistant candidates.\n\nIn the NA inhibition assay for oseltamivir, OSVs showed a mean IC50 \u00b1 SD of 0.10 \u00b1 0.05 nmol/L (range 0.01\u20130.35 nmol/L), and ORVs had a mean \u00b1 SD IC50 of 67.7 \u00b1 44.1 nmol/L (range 26.1\u2013239.2 nmol/L), showing a reduction of >260-fold in susceptibility to oseltamivir. One OSV identified as a statistical outlier (cutoff IC50, >0.40 nmol/L; upper quartile + 5.0\u00d7 interquartile range) showed a D151E substitution on the NA protein (Table 1).\n\nIn the NA inhibition assay for zanamivir, statistical analysis showed that 341 viruses were regarded as the zanamivir-sensitive viruses, with a mean \u00b1 SD IC50 of 0.40 \u00b1 0.26 nmol/L (range 0.01\u20131.92 nmol/L), and 16 viruses (10 ORVs and 6 OSVs) were identified as outliers (cutoff IC50, >1.99 nmol/L) (Table 1). Seven viruses (2 ORVs and 5 OSVs) were regarded as resistant candidates from curve fit patterns. NA-sequencing for these 23 viruses (12 ORVs and 11 OSVs) showed 2 types of amino acid changes on the NA protein. One virus, A/Tottori/16/2008 (OSV), possessed a Q136K substitution, showing a high IC50 (41.89 nmol/L), and 19 of the other 22 viruses displayed an amino acid change G, N, or V at the D151 position (Table 1). These data suggest that D151 changes have a substantial effect on sensitivity to zanamivir (and oseltamivir). Moreover, A/Tottori/44/2008 with H275Y and D151D/G substitutions conferred high-level resistance to both NAIs (Figure 3, panels A and B). However, a recent study reported that a D151E change was detected only after virus propagation in cell culture, but not in the original clinical specimen (19), suggesting a possible role of cell culture in selecting these D151 variant viruses. To further investigate D151 variants, available original clinical specimens of viruses with D151 variation were subjected to NA sequencing, so that all D151 variations (D151G/E/N) were not detected in the original clinical specimens (Table 1). We thus concluded that D151 variants might not have emerged as a natural occurrence and all recent ORVs would retain sensitivity to zanamivir.\n\nSusceptibility to M2 inhibitors was determined to find established-resistant markers by M2-sequencing. The 367 viruses (288 isolates in the 2007\u201308 season; 79 isolates in the 2008\u201309 season) including 123 ORVs (45 and 78, respectively) and 244 OSVs (243 and 1, respectively) were tested. Viruses belonging to clade 2B were sensitive to M2 inhibitors, and viruses belonging to clade 2C were resistant to M2 inhibitors, so all ORVs except A/Yokohama/91/2007 were sensitive to M2 inhibitors. A/Yokohama/91/2007 belonged to clade 2C and was the only virus resistant to both oseltamivir and M2 inhibitors.\n\nTo estimate the reactivity of ORVs and OSVs to ferret antiserum against 2008\u201309 vaccine strain A/Brisbane/59/2009, the HI test was performed. Good inhibition was achieved in 76% of OSVs and 69% of ORVs by A/Brisbane/59/2009 ferret antiserum, and 22% of OSVs and 28% of ORVs showed a 4-fold reduction in HI titer to the homologous titer, respectively (Table 2). Only 2% and 3% of OSVs and ORVs showed a >8-fold reduction in HI titer to A/Brisbane/59/2009 ferret antiserum. These data demonstrated that OSVs and ORVs were anitigenitically indistinguishable from each other and were similar to the 2008\u201309 vaccine strain A/Brisbane/59/2009.\n\nTottori Prefecture is located in the western part of the main island of Japan. Comprising 19 cities and geographically divided into 3 areas, this prefecture has the lowest population in Japan (Figure 4, panel B). Despite a low frequency of only 2.6% in Japan during 2007\u201308 season, an unexpectedly high frequency (32.4%) of ORVs was observed in Tottori prefecture (Figure 2, panel A). ORVs from Tottori were collected from 4 cities in 2 areas with no systematic bias apparent in the sampling process (Figure 4, panel B).\n\nPhylogenetic analysis of NA genes showed that these ORVs formed 3 subclades (Figure 4, panel A): the first with a Northern-Eu lineage sharing V75A and D354G (T-1); the second with a Hawaii lineage without common changes (T-2); and the third with a Hawaii lineage and sharing M188L (T-3). Among these, only OSVs genetically close to ORVs were observed in T-2, suggesting that ORVs in T-2 would be derived from OSVs in Tottori prefecture.\n\nA mapping study for ORVs showed that all ORVs in the Hawaii lineage were collected from Tottori city only, primarily at the end of January, whereas ORVs with the Northern-Eu lineage were collected from 4 cities, including Tottori city, during February and March. Genetically diverse ORVs belonging to T1-T3 were cocirculating only in Tottori city in the eastern area (Figure 4, panel B). The Tottori case raised concern about the possibility that these Tottori ORVs could survive to become an origin ORV for the 2008\u201309 season in Japan. However, phylogenetic analysis showed that all ORVs isolated during the 2008\u201309 season were not genetically close to ORVs from Tottori (Appendix Figure). As a result, all ORVs from Tottori seemed to have been eliminated in the 2007\u201308 season, and ORVs that may have been introduced from other counties were circulating during 2008\u201309 in Japan.\n\nOur study demonstrated that ORVs dramatically increased in Japan from the 2007\u201308 season (2.6%) to the 2008\u201309 season (99.7%). All tested ORVs showed a reduction of >260-fold in susceptibility to oseltamivir by NA inhibition assay. On the other hand, almost all ORVs remained sensitive to the other antiviral-drugs, e.g., zanamivir, and M2 inhibitors. HI testing suggested that the current vaccine, A/Brisbane/59/2008, would be effective against recent ORVs. In addition, recent studies have reported that symptoms and hospitalization rates of patients infected with ORVs are no different from those seen with OSVs (14,20).\n\nJapan has the largest per capita use of oseltamivir (>70%) in the world (10). Because this use could cause efficient selection of ORVs in individual patients, Japan might be the initial site of worldwide spread of ORVs. However, long-term NAI surveillance in Japan during 1996\u20132007 and recent surveillance showed a low frequency of NAI-resistant viruses for any strains and subtypes (10,21,22), suggesting that transmissibility of ORVs selected by drug pressure was remarkably decreased. In addition, previous NAI surveillance (5\u201310) and several animal studies (23\u201326) also suggested that NAI-resistant viruses would become defective viruses with attenuated infectivity and transmissibility to human. In contrast, despite little NAI use, a high emergence of ORVs has been detected in several countries in Europe since November 2007. These ORVs had as efficient transmissibility as OSVs in human-to-human transmission, resulting in worldwide spread in a short period of time. Although whether the initial ORV detected in Norway in the 2007\u201308 season appeared because of NAI drug pressure is unknown, those ORVs may have obtained amino acid changes on NA and/or other proteins to compensate for the defect, in addition to the H275Y substitution on the NA protein. Most ORVs belong genetically to the Northern-Eu lineage in clade 2B, suggesting that the gene constellation may contain a big advantage to retain infectivity and transmissibility.\n\nAn interesting question arose as to where the ORVs in Japan originated. In the Hawaii lineage, almost all ORVs in Japan would be derived from OSVs in Japan because the NA gene of ORVs was similar to OSV counterparts isolated at similar times or from similar regions (Appendix Figure). On the other hand, in the Northern-Eu lineage, ORVs in Japan would have been introduced from other countries. In 2007\u201308, almost all ORVs would be imported from countries in Europe. In 2008\u201309, the ORVs in C-1, which comprised most isolates in 2008\u201309, and ORVs in C-4 were genetically similar to ORVs isolated from the Southern Hemisphere. Because influenza activity in the Southern Hemisphere occurs half a year earlier than that in the Northern Hemisphere, most ORVs in Japan conceivably could have been imported from the Southern Hemisphere. ORVs in C-2 and C-3 were genetically similar to ORVs isolated in North America and Hawaii, but the collection month of ORVs in C-3 were similar to each other, suggesting that ORVs in C-3 might be derived from an unknown common origin ORV. The ORVs obtained during 2008\u201309 were not genetically similar to any ORVs isolated in Tottori during 2007\u201308, indicating that ORVs from Tottori had been eliminated and had not formed the origin ORVs for the 2008\u201309 season in Japan. As for A/Yokohama/91/2007 belonging to clade 2C, the patient from which this virus was isolated was known to have taken oseltamivir before sampling (22), indicating that selective drug pressure in this person might have selected for this ORV.\n\nIn the NA inhibition assay for zanamivir, some viruses, including ORVs and OSVs, showed reduced sensitivity to zanamivir. NA sequencing of these viruses showed 2 types of amino acid changes. One virus, A/Tottori/16/2008 (OSV), possessed a Q136K substitution, which reportedly confers resistance to zanamivir (27,28). Conversely, most of the other viruses possessed D151 G/V/N. The amino acid changes D151 to N or E among subtype H1N1 viruses and to A, G, E, N, or V among H3N2 have been reported (7,8,19), and viruses with D151 substitutions often exhibit reduced sensitivity to NAIs (8,19,29). However, a recent study reported a possible role for cell culture in selecting these D151 variant viruses (19). In the present study, D151 variations (D151G/E/N) also were not detected from available original clinical specimens (Table 1), supporting the previous finding. We thus concluded that viruses with D151 variations would not have emerged naturally, and all ORVs would remain sensitive to zanamivir.\n\nBy sequencing of M2 gene, we confirmed that almost all Japanese ORVs belonging to clade 2B retained sensitive genotype to M2 inhibitors, consistent with previously reports that recent clade 2B viruses are sensitive to M2 inhibitors, but clade 2C viruses are resistant (27).\n\nDuring the 2007\u201309 seasons, we also addressed NAI surveillance for A/H3N2 and type B circulating in Japan and identified no viruses resistant to both NAIs. Conversely, in March and early April 2009, a new swine-origin influenza virus A (H1N1) (now known as pandemic [H1N1] 2009 virus) emerged in Mexico and the United States and spread rapidly to many countries, including Japan (30\u201333). In June 2009, detection of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus with H275Y on the NA protein was reported from Denmark, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, People\u2019s Republic of China, and Japan, but all ORVs of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus emerged as sporadic cases with no evidence of efficient human-to-human transmission (34). Although oseltamivir remains a valuable drug for treatment of pandemic (H1N1) 2009, many ORVs were isolated after prophylaxis with a half dose of the drug. Therefore, prophylaxis with oseltamivir may not be recommended as stated by WHO (35). Rapid and continuous monitoring of NAI-resistant viruses, including pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus, and dissemination of the findings in timely manner remains essential."}
