{"title": "Viral aetiology of common colds of outpatient children at primary care\nlevel and the use of antibiotics", "body": "The study was conducted from 1 March 2008-28 February 2009 at a primary care facility in\nS\u00e3o Paulo, Southeast Region of Brazil. Children of less than 12 years of age were\nattended by paediatricians and the clinical diagnosis was coded using the International\nClassification of Disease, 10th Revision. All children seen on Tuesday's and Friday's\nmornings with the diagnosis of common cold (J00) or acute upper respiratory infections\nof multiple and unspecified sites (J06) with symptoms starting in the last five days\nwere included in the study sample. Patients with any associated codes for sinusitis,\notitis media, bacterial pharyngitis, pneumonia or who had underlying chronic heart or\nlung disease or any other chronic health problem or immune disorder were excluded.\nPatients who had used antibiotics in the last five days were also excluded. The study\nwas approved by the Ethical Committee of S\u00e3o Paulo Federal University (CEP 0670/08) and\nwritten informed consent was obtained from parents or guardians before enrollment of\neach patient.\n\nAn independent paediatrician who was not responsible for any clinical intervention\nfilled out a standardised case report form that included information on demographic\ncharacteristics and clinical syndrome for each enrolled patient. Data of follow-up were\nobtained in medical records of subsequent office visits and also by regular telephone\ncalls to the parents every two or three days. All data were entered on the form until\nthe resolution of the respiratory illness. Data about medical prescription of\nantibiotics, symptoms on the day of antibiotic prescription, laboratory tests and X-ray\nexams reports were recorded on the form. The use of antibiotics was considered\nappropriate for all patients with signs and symptoms of secondary bacterial infection\ndiagnosed as AOM, bacterial sinusitis or pneumonia with evidence of parenchymal\ninfiltrates in the chest X-ray exam. For patients with the diagnosis of sinusitis, the\nuse of antibiotics was considered appropriate in cases of symptoms of rhinosinusitis and\ncough without improvement for more than 10-14 days or more severe upper respiratory\ntract signs and symptoms, i.e., fever \u2265 39\u00baC, facial swelling, facial pain (Dowell et\nal. 1998a).\n\n\nLaboratory tests - A sample of nasopharyngeal wash was obtained from\neach patient at the enrollment visit. The median time from the onset of symptoms to the\ncollection of nasal washings was three days (1-5 days). Samples were collected and\nprocessed using previously published procedures (Carraro\net al. 2007) and immediately transported to the laboratory for respiratory\nvirus testing.\n\nRespiratory samples were tested first with the commercial panel SimulFluor Respiratory\nScreen (Chemicon International, USA) for detection of seven respiratory viruses:\nrespiratory syncytial virus, influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza virus types 1-3\nand adenovirus, as described previously (Bellei et al.\n2007, Carraro et al. 2007). Original\nspecimens were then stored at -80\u00b0C for further analysis and as polymerase chain\nreaction (PCR) tests became available in our laboratory, the viral RNA and DNA were\nextracted from each sample using QIAamp Viral RNA and DNA extraction Kit (Qiagen, USA)\naccording to the manufacturer's instructions. Nucleic acid extracts were tested by PCR\nfor the detection of respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A and B viruses, adenovirus,\nrhinovirus, metapneumovirus, bocavirus, coronavirus and enterovirus, according to\npublished methods (Allard et al. 2001, Savolainen et al. 2002, Erdman et al. 2003,Falsey et al.\n2003, Allander et al. 2005, Brittain-Long et al. 2008, Vijgen et al. 2008, CDC\n2009).\n\n\nStatistical analysis - Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS\n20.0 and Stata 12 statistical softwares and the statistical significance level for all\ntests was 5%. The existence of associations between two categorical variables was\nverified using the chi-square test or the Fisher's exact test depending on the sample\nsize. The Student's t test was used to perform comparisons of averages\nbetween two groups of data in cases of independent samples. To compare more than two\naverages, the analysis of variances (ANOVA) was used. Normal distribution of data was\npreviously verified using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Nonparametric Mann-Whitney\nU and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare the averages of\nsamples that did not meet the normality assumption. If differences were found between\naverages, multiple comparisons were performed to localise such differences. For the\npairwise comparisons of groups, adjustments in the descriptive levels were made so that\nthe overall significance was 5%.\n\nDuring the whole study, 3,282 medical consultations were carried out, 29% (955/3282) of\nwhich were coded as common cold or acute upper respiratory infections of multiple and\nunspecified sites. Of these 955 common cold cases, a sample of 134 patients who met the\ninclusion criteria was obtained, median age 2.9 years (0.1-11.2 y), 49% male. The most\nfrequent symptoms were coryza (91.8%, 123/134), cough (90.3%, 121/134), fever (56%,\n75/134) and wheezing (46.3%, 62/134). Respiratory viruses were detected in 73.9%\n(99/134) of nasopharyngeal wash samples (1 sample per patient) with a coinfection rate\nof 30.3% (30/99). The laboratory tests findings are described in Table I.\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall, the antibiotic prescription rate was 39.6% (53/134), among which 60.4% (32/53)\nwas amoxicillin, 22.6% (12/53) macrolides, 9.4% (5/53) cephalosporins and 7.6% (4/53)\namoxicillin plus sulbactam (Table II). Of 53\npatients who received antibiotics during the follow-up, only 30.2% (16/53) received them\njudiciously and the other 69.8% (37/53) received them inappropriately. Among these 37\ncases with inappropriate use, the clinical justifications for prescription of\nantibiotics were: in 37.7% (20/53) to treat nasal or postnasal discharge during the\nfirst week of common cold symptoms in patients without fever, in 18.9% (10/53) to treat\npersistence of cough during the first week of symptoms, in 11.3% (6/53) to treat common\ncold and in 1.9% (1/53) to treat wheezing symptom.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong 75 children who had fever at the onset of symptoms, 45.3% (34/75) were prescribed\nantibiotics whereas 32.2% (19/59) of those who did not have fever at the onset of\nsymptoms received antibiotics. Thus, there was no difference in the proportion of\nantibiotic prescriptions between children who had fever at the onset of symptoms and\nthose who did not (p = 0.123).\n\nOf a total of 53 children who received antibiotics, 34 presented fever at onset of\nsymptoms and of these, 29.4% (10/34) received judicious prescription of antibiotics. Of\nthe remaining 19 children who did not have fever at the onset of common cold symptoms\nand received antibiotics, 31.6% (6/19) were prescribed antibiotics judiciously. Thus,\nthere was also no difference for judicious prescription of antibiotics between children\nwith fever and those without fever at the onset of common cold symptoms (p = 0.869).\n\nThe average time to the resolution of symptoms of children with signs of secondary\nbacterial infection was of 16.7 days and, within this group, all children received\nantibiotics. Among children with no signs of bacterial infection, the average time to\nthe resolution of symptoms was 8.9 days for the group that received antibiotics and 7.0\ndays for the group that did not.\n\nAmong patients with respiratory virus monoinfection, all patients with influenza\nreceived antibiotics inappropriately (10/10), whereas those with respiratory syncytial\nvirus were prescribed antibiotics inappropriately in 60% (3/5) and those with rhinovirus\nwere prescribed antibiotics inappropriately in 44.4% of cases (5/9) (p = 0.016). Also,\nof seven patients coinfected with influenza, 71.4% (5/7) received antibiotics\ninappropriately, as showed in Table II. None of\nthe patients were vaccinated against influenza by the time of the study.\n\nInappropriate use of antibiotics for viral common colds is an important problem\nworldwide but, until now, we did not have clinical studies addressing this problem in\nBrazil. During the clinical course of a common cold, secondary bacterial infections may\noccur, however, antimicrobials are frequently used inappropriately for events that are\nnormal during the clinical course of a viral infection (Dowell et al. 1998b). In our\nstudy, this practice was particularly evident in cases of viral rhinosinusitis, since\n37.7% (20/53) of patients received antibiotics for the presence of nasal or postnasal\ndischarge during the first week of common cold symptoms without fever. During childhood,\n20-40% of common colds can be complicated by AOM (Wald\net al. 1991, Chonmaitree et al. 2008)\nand although current recommendations on management of AOM encourage the initial\nobservation of nonsevere AOM cases in selected children (i.e., \u201cwatchful waiting\u201d)\n(AAP 2004), there are still controversies\naround the diagnosis and management of AOM (Hoberman et\nal. 2011,Shaikh et al. 2011). In\nroutine practice, the over diagnosis of AOM is frequent but, considering that there are\ndifficulties in confirming the diagnosis, in our study we considered all indications of\nantibiotic for AOM as adequate regardless of the patients' age, severity of symptoms and\ncertainty of diagnosis. We believe that rates of inappropriate use of antibiotics could\nbe even greater if stringent diagnostic criteria were applied for AOM diagnosis.\n\nAmoxicillin was the first choice for antibiotic therapy accounting for 60.4% (32/53) of\nall prescriptions but, on the other hand, the second most prescribed antibiotics were\nmacrolides (22.6%, 12/53) which is not in accordance with current guidelines (Bradley et al. 2011). Predominantly in the paediatric\noutpatient population, the growing emergence of bacterial resistance to macrolides is\nrelated to delayed cure and is responsible for a great proportion of costs currently\nassociated with antibiotic resistant pneumococcal infections (Kawai et al. 2012, Reynolds et al.\n2014). Continuing medical education programs aimed not only to reduce the\ninappropriate use of antibiotics, but also to teach the best practices of antibiotic\ntherapy could be of great help to improve this scenario.\n\nDiagnostic uncertainty, which is defined as the difficulty in distinguishing a\nself-limited viral infection from a bacterial infection requiring antibiotic therapy is\nidentified by researchers as a factor that contributes for antibiotic overuse (Arnold et al. 2005). Thus, the difficulty in\npredicting a bacterial infection in febrile children could lead to the misuse of\nantibiotics. Bacterial infections are associated with worsening of clinical conditions\nwith a consequent longer time for the resolution of symptoms. However, common colds\nwithout secondary infections follow a self-limited course of seven-10 days with no\nreduction of the duration of symptoms with the use of antibiotic, as it was observed in\nthis study and as reported elsewhere in the medical literature (Kaiser et al. 2001, Brandileone et\nal. 2006, Li et al. 2009, Carranza-Martinez et al. 2010).\n\nAlthough our study was not designed to evaluate the influence of fever in medical\ndecision to prescribe antibiotics, we observed that there was no difference in the\nproportion of antibiotic prescriptions for patients who had fever at the onset of\nsymptoms and for those who did not, as well as in the proportion of judicious\nprescription of antibiotics for these two groups of patients. Additional research is\nneeded to identify the local factors that are determinants of antibiotic misuse.\n\nAlthough it is well known that influenza vaccination is the primary strategy to prevent\ninfluenza, the Brazilian Health Ministry started public vaccination campaigns against\ninfluenza for children in 2010 so that part of the population had no access to influenza\nvaccine by the time of the study. None of the patients of the study were vaccinated\nagainst influenza and this fact could explain the high frequency of influenza infection\nin our patients (23.1%; 31/134), as showed in Table\nI.\n\nAntiviral treatment also plays an important role in decreasing influenza-related\nmorbidity and mortality, but none of 33 patients with laboratory confirmed influenza\ninfection received antiviral therapy, whereas all patients with influenza monoinfection\nreceived antibiotics inappropriately (10/10) and those coinfected with influenza and\nother viruses also received antibiotics inappropriately in a great proportion of cases\n(71.4%; 5/7). A recent study in the United States of America reported that during\n2012-2013, antiviral medications were underprescribed and antibiotics may have been\ninappropriately prescribed to a large proportion of outpatients with influenza (Havers et al. 2014). The referred study emphasises\nthat the use of sensitive and specific tests for the rapid diagnosis of influenza and\nother respiratory viruses is strongly recommended and could decrease antibiotic use and\nguide appropriate use of antiviral agents in both outpatient and inpatient settings\n(Bradley et al. 2011). In Brazil, diagnostic\ntests for respiratory virus are still expensive and are not easily available for the\nvast majority of the population, especially for low income people.\n\nThis study was conducted at one primary care facility and it is not possible to\ngeneralise the results to all Brazilian primary health care services, however, these\npreliminary data will help us to better understand antibiotic misuse among children with\ncommon cold viral infections. We believe that continuing education on appropriate\nantibiotics and antivirals use as well as accessibility to influenza vaccination,\nsensitive and specific tests for the rapid diagnosis of respiratory viruses and\nantiviral medication are essential to improve primary healthcare quality."}
