{"title": "", "body": "(regions) draw up their own national (regional) classification of microorganisms, by risk group, taking into account:\n\nworkplace. The biosafety level assigned for the specific work to be done is, therefore, driven by professional judgment based on a risk assessment, rather than by automatic assignment of a laboratory biosafety level according to the particular risk group designation of the pathogenic agent to be used. Table 18 .3 summarizes the facility requirements at the four biosafety levels.\n\nThus, the assignment of a biosafety level takes into consideration the organism (pathogenic agent) used, the facilities available, and the equipment practices and procedures required for conducting work safely in the laboratory.\n\nThe concept of biological safety (or biosafety) has paralleled the development of the science of microbiology and its extension into new and related areas including tissue culture, recombinant DNA, animal studies, molecular biology, synthetic biology, and biotechnology. The knowledge and skill gained by microbiologists that is necessary to isolate, manipulate, and propagate pathogenic microorganisms required parallel development of containment principles, facility design, and practices and procedures to prevent occupational infections in the workplace or release of the organisms to the environment. Biosafety entails safe microbiological practices and procedures and proper use of containment equipment and facilities. To be prudent in biosafety, one must develop knowledge of the principles of epidemiology, disease transmission patterns, risk assessment and risk management, disinfection and sterilization, disease prevention, aerobiology, and environmental control. The particular proficiencies a biosafety professional should possess as described by American Biological Safety Association (ABSA, http://www.absa.org/) in the following areas are:\n\n1. Disinfection, decontamination, sterilization. What is the difference between sterilization, decontamination, and disinfection? When and/or where do you apply these eradication technique?

Verify that facilities as built meet minimum biosafety design criteria.\n\nBefore leaving this topic of biohazard, we should emphasize that biohazards or, more specifically, hazards of biological organisms, are relatively slow moving in space and have varied standards of handling biohazards in different countries. Containment is the first line of defense in combating biohazards. While dealing with a specific threat, the methods are similar in dealing with reactive hazards, as we will learn in sections that follow.\n\nBiohazards or, more specifically, hazards of biological organisms can be relatively slow moving and have varied standards regarding handling biohazards in different countries. In comparison, chemicals hazardous to the living can be fast moving, dramatic, and sudden. While containment is the first line of defense in combating biohazards, containment alone is not effective in the prevention of reactive hazards. No containment is perfect and breaching of barriers can occur, becoming what we term \"accidents.\" After fires and explosions, the major accident that can occur in chemical processing is the release of a chemical that is hazardous to humans. Recall that one of the green chemistry tenets is to eliminate or reduce the use of toxic chemicals in a process. Benign solvents, such as air, water, carbon dioxide, and low-volatility solvents (eg, ionic liquids and molten salt), are preferred. Still, the products we seek or produce are also commonly harmful substances when improperly released. Air and water can become contaminated with chemicals that cause harm. These hazards can be acute (causing immediate and critical harm to people, as in the Bhopal chemical plant toxic gas accident in India) or chronic (groundwater contamination, which can require years and millions of dollars for cleanup).\n\nTo avoid inappropriate handling as well as emergency response to accidents, chemicals need to be properly labeled. Chemicals are labeled following standardized systems. However, different countries and/or agencies have different standards. For example, the Hazardous Materials Identification System (HMIS) is a numerical hazard rating that incorporates the use of labels with color developed by the American Coatings Association as a compliance aid for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Hazard Communication Standard. OSHA is an agency of the United States Department of Labor. Similarly, the fire diamond, created by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), is also a numerical hazard rating. HMIS and NFPA identifications are shown in Table 18 .4. The hazards are divided into three main categories: health, flammability, and physical. The labeling is visual and easy to understand.\n\nAlthough there are differences among agencies and countries, the general messages are similar. To avoid confusion and promote trade, the United Nations created in 1992 a universal identification system, the global harmonized system (GHS) of classification and labeling of chemicals. Fig. 18 .2 shows a sample GHS chemical label. The GHS label includes the substance name, ID, eye-catching pictograms to show the potential dangers, warnings, and descriptions on how to handle it. Table 18 .5 contains pictograms of the different hazard classes. As shown in Table 18 .5, the GHS hazard classification also includes three categories: physical, health, and environment. As compared with HMIS and NFPA labeling, GHS combined the The physical hazards are assigned to nine different hazard classes largely based on the United Nations Dangerous Goods System. These include:\n\n1. explosives, which are assigned to one of six subcategories depending on the type of hazard they present, as used in the UN Dangerous Goods System; which are dangerous if they can be easily ignited by brief contact with an ignition source, such as a burning match, and if the flame spreads rapidly. They are further divided into (a) flammable solids, (b) polymerizing substances, and (c) self-reactive substances, ie, thermally unstable solids liable to undergo a strongly exothermic thermal decomposition even without participation of oxygen (air) other than materials classified as explosive, organic peroxides or as oxidizing. Spontaneously combusting solids or pyrophoric solids are solids that, even in small quantities, are liable to ignite within 5 min after coming into contact with air. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to a single hazard category on the basis of the outcome of the UN Test N.2. Self-heating substances are solids or liquids, other than a pyrophoric substance, which, by reaction with air and without heat supply, is liable to self-heat. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to one of two hazard categories on the basis of the outcome of the UN Test N.4. Substances that on contact with water emit flammable gases are liable to become spontaneously flammable or to give off flammable gases in dangerous quantities. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to one of three hazard categories on the basis of the outcome of UN Test N.5, which measures gas evolution and speed of evolution. Flammable aerosols can be classified as Class 1 or Class 2 if they contain any component that is classified as flammable.); 5. oxidizing substances and organic peroxides, which contain category 1 oxidizing substances and category 2 organic peroxides, organic liquids or solids that contain the bivalent -O-Ostructure and may be considered a derivative of hydrogen peroxide, where one or both of the hydrogen atoms have been replaced by organic radicals (The term also includes organic peroxide formulations (mixtures). Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to one of seven \"types,\" A to G, on the basis of the outcome of the UN Test Series A to H.); 6. toxic and infectious substances; 7. radioactive substances; 8. substances corrosive to metal, which are substances or mixtures that by chemical action will materially damage, or even destroy metals (These substances or mixtures are classified in a single hazard category on the basis of tests [Steel: ISO 9328 (II): 1991-Steel type P235; Aluminum: ASTM G31-72 (1990)-nonclad types 7075-T6 or AZ5GU-T66]. The GHS criteria are a corrosion rate on steel or aluminum surfaces exceeding 6.25 mm per year at a test temperature of 55\u00b0C.); 9. miscellaneous dangerous substances, which include environmentally dangerous substances.\n\nThe health hazards are classified based on 12 areas listed here.\n\n\u2022 Acute toxicity includes five GHS categories from which the appropriate elements relevant to transport, consumer, worker, and environment protection can be selected.\n\nSubstances are assigned to one of the five toxicity categories on the basis of LD 50 (oral, dermal) or LC 50 (inhalation). \u2022 Skin corrosion means the production of irreversible damage to the skin following the application of a test substance for up to 4 h. Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to a single harmonized corrosion category.\n\n\u2022 Skin irritation means the production of reversible damage to the skin following the application of a test substance for up to 4 h. Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to a single irritant category. For those authorities, such as pesticide regulators, wanting more than one designation for skin irritation, an additional mild irritant category is provided. \u2022 Serious eye damage means the production of tissue damage in the eye, or serious physical decay of vision, following application of a test substance to the front surface of the eye, which is not fully reversible within 21 days of application. Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to a single harmonized category. \u2022 Eye irritation means changes in the eye following the application of a test substance to the front surface of the eye, which are fully reversible within 21 days of application. Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to a single harmonized hazard category. For authorities, such as pesticide regulators, wanting more than one designation for eye irritation, one of two subcategories can be selected, depending on whether the effects are reversible in 21 or 7 days. \u2022 Respiratory sensitizer means a substance that induces hypersensitivity of the airways following inhalation of the substance. Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to one hazard category. \u2022 Skin sensitizer means a substance that will induce an allergic response following skin contact. The definition for \"skin sensitizer\" is equivalent to \"contact sensitizer.\" Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to one hazard category. \u2022 Germ cell mutagenicity means an agent giving rise to an increased occurrence of mutations in populations of cells and/or organisms. Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to one of two hazard categories. Category 1 has two subcategories. \u2022 Carcinogenicity means a chemical substance or a mixture of chemical substances that induces cancer or increases its incidence. Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to one of two hazard categories. Category 1 has two subcategories. \u2022 Reproductive toxicity includes adverse effects on sexual function and fertility in adult males and females, as well as developmental toxicity in offspring. Substances and mixtures with reproductive and/or developmental effects are assigned to one of two hazard categories, \"known or presumed\" and \"suspected.\" Category 1 has two subcategories for reproductive and developmental effects. Materials that cause concern for the health of breastfed children have a separate category, \"Effects on or via Lactation.\" \u2022 Specific target organ toxicity (STOT) category distinguishes between single and repeated exposure for target organ effects. All significant health effects not otherwise specifically included in the GHS that can impair function, both reversible and irreversible, immediate and/or delayed are included in the nonlethal target organ/systemic toxicity class. Narcotic effects and respiratory tract irritation are considered to be target organ systemic effects following a single exposure. Substances and mixtures of the single exposure target organ toxicity hazard class are assigned to one of three hazard categories. Substances and mixtures of the repeated exposure target organ toxicity hazard class are assigned to one of two hazard categories.\n\n\u2022 Aspiration hazard includes severe acute effects such as chemical pneumonia, varying degrees of pulmonary injury, or death following aspiration. Aspiration is the entry of a liquid or solid directly through the oral or nasal cavity, or indirectly from vomiting, into the trachea and lower respiratory system. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to one of two hazard categories on the basis of viscosity.\n\nAnd the environmental hazards are classified in two areas:\n\n\u2022 Acute aquatic toxicity means the intrinsic property of a material to cause injury to an aquatic organism in a short-term exposure. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to one of three toxicity categories on the basis of acute toxicity data: LC 50 (fish) or EC 50 (crustacean) or ErC 50 (for algae or other aquatic plants). In some regulatory systems these acute toxicity categories may be subdivided or extended for certain sectors. \u2022 Chronic aquatic toxicity means the potential or actual properties of a material to cause adverse effects to aquatic organisms during exposures that are determined in relation to the lifecycle of the organism. Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to one of four toxicity categories on the basis of acute data and environmental fate data: LC 50 (fish) or EC 50 (crustacea) or ErC 50 (for algae or other aquatic plants) and degradation or bioaccumulation.\n\nIn addition to chemical labeling, detailed data must be provided for safe handling of the particular chemical. The safety data sheet (SDS, formerly known as material safety data sheet or MSDS) is specifically aimed at use in the workplace. It provides relevant and accurate information about the chemical product so workers can manage risks surrounding the chemical. The SDS contains 16 sections. While there are differences in existing industry recommendations and requirements of countries, there is widespread agreement on a 16-section SDS that includes the following headings in the order specified:\n\n1. Identification 2. Hazard(s) identification 3. Composition/information on ingredients 4. First-aid measures 5. Firefighting measures 6. Accidental release measures 7. Handling and storage 8. Exposure control/personal protection 9. Physical and chemical properties 10. Stability and reactivity 11. Toxicological information 12. Ecological information 13. Disposal considerations 14. Transport information 15. Regulatory information 16. Other information The GHS SDS headings, sequence, and content are similar to the ISO, EU, and ANSI MSDS/ SDS requirements. The SDS provides a clear description of the data used to identify thazards.\n\nThe current industry consensus defines chemical reactivity hazard as a situation where an uncontrolled chemical reaction could result directly or indirectly in serious harm to people, property, or the environment.\n\nThe US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued an alert in 2004 (EPA 550-F-04-004 [5104A] www.epa.gov/ceppo) as part of its ongoing effort to protect human health and the environment by preventing chemical accidents. EPA is striving to learn the causes and contributing factors associated with chemical accidents and to prevent their recurrence. Major chemical accidents cannot be prevented solely through regulatory requirements. Rather, understanding the root causes, widely disseminating the lessons learned, and integrating these lessons into safe operations are also required. EPA publishes alerts to increase awareness of possible hazards. It is important to review this information and consider whether additional action is needed to address the hazards.\n\nThe purpose of this 2004 alert is to introduce small-and medium-sized facilities to a simple method, developed by the Center for Chemical Process Safety (CCPS), made up of essential practices for management of and screening for chemical reactivity hazards. The CCPS preliminary screening method (see Fig. 18 .3) is a tool to help one identify where chemical reactivity hazards are likely to occur and may be applicable to a wide range of activities including warehousing, repackaging, blending, mixing, and processing.\n\nMany materials used in industrial facilities can pose chemical reactivity hazards. These hazards may not be as easy to identify as other hazards such as toxicity or corrosiveness. A facility is at a higher risk of having an uncontrolled release if all the existing chemical reactivity hazards are not identified. Table 18 .6 shows the typical causes of reactivity incidents. One can infer that chemical reactivity hazards can be categorized as follows:\n\n1. Self-reacting or unstable chemicals. A single unstable compound can undergo uncontrolled decomposition, rearrangement, or polymerization. For example, organic peroxides can pose fire and explosion hazards. 2. Runaway reactions. Intended reactions of chemicals to produce desired products can become uncontrollable. For example, the reaction of phenol with formaldehyde to produce phenolic resins is subjected runaway. 3. Incompatibilities. Inadvertent mixing of two or more process chemicals may lead to an unintended chemical reaction. For example, mixing acids with cyanide salts generates highly toxic hydrogen cyanide gas, and mixing silver salts with ammonia in the presence of a strong base may generate an explosively unstable solid. Also, process chemicals may react with materials present in the process such as water, air, materials of construction, lubricating oils, utility fluids, and so on. For example, acetylene reacts with copper to form explosive compounds, and phosgene reacts corrosively with stainless steel, which may result in loss of containment. Incorrect sequence of addition of chemicals Incorrect or loss of control of process parameters and conditions (pH, level, vacuum, venting, etc.) Process steps performed too soon, too late, out of sequence, or omitted\n\nPresence of incompatible materials, eg, lubricants, sealants, packing, utility fluids, materials of construction, rust, etc.\n\nIngress of materials such as water, air, and utility fluids through containment penetrations or leaks Exposure of process chemicals to the atmosphere (moisture, oxygen, etc.)\n\nIncorrect chemicals delivered Incorrect chemicals charged Chemicals loaded or transferred to wrong vessels Breached containment Most chemical reactions release heat, and many reactivity incidents involve the sudden release of heat in quantities or at rates too high to be absorbed by the immediate soundings. Potential consequences or reactivity incidents include 1. overpressurization and rupture of closed containers and vessels, which can result in an explosion and projectiles that can cause injuries and property damage and/or the dispersal of hazardous materials and toxic exposures, fires, and violent explosions; 2. generation of gases (toxic or combustive) or other hazardous materials (eg, the generation of hydrogen sulfide by the inadvertent mixing of an acid with a sulfide solution); 3. generation of heat that causes thermal burns and ignition of combustible materials; 4. fire in the absence of an additional ignition source; 5. initiation of other chemical reactions.\n\nIn order to avoid or manage the chemical reactivity hazard, the first step in managing chemical reactivity hazards is identifying those facility operations and chemicals that represent a potential chemical reactivity hazard. Fig. 18 .3 shows a schematic flow diagram of steps to follow in identifying chemical reactivity hazards in a given facility. The screening method is based on a series of 12 \"yes-or-no\" questions to help one determine if there are chemical reactivity hazards in the facility.\n\nOnce the chemical reactivity hazards are identified in the facility, a hazard management system can be set up to properly address them. Regulatory process safety and risk management systems, such as the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP), incorporate elements that are applicable to the management of reactive chemicals and can be used as a basis. EPA believes that facilities have a general duty to address significant reactive chemical hazards under the general duty clause of section 112(r)(1) of the Unites States Federal Government's Clean Air Act.\n\nA first step in accident prevention is to examine how the reactor perform under all possible feed conditions. What are the possible ranges of pressure, temperature, feed rate, feed compositions, and other variables that the system may possibly experience, and what will be their responses in the reactor and effluent? The bioprocess engineer needs to be aware constantly of these upsets or drifting away from the desired set point(s).\n\nEfficient handling of upsets requires the knowledge of steady-state and transient behaviors of the reactor system. We have discussed only steady-state behavior except for brief considerations in Chapters 4, 11, 12, and 15, and feed and thermal transients in Continuous Stirred Tank Reactors (CSTRs) in Chapter 15. Numerical tools, such as ODEXLIMS as shown in Chapters 4 and 6, are useful in aiding the analysis.\n\nIt is important to build a model of the bioprocess early in process design and use this model to simulate all possible upsets. The bulk of this text deals with the kinetics, or kinetic model, of chemical transformations and biotransformations, and thus there is no excuse for not being able to establish a reasonable mathematical model for the process under concern. After each possible upset has been examined individually, combinations of upsets need to be considered. What would happen should pressure, temperature, and feed substrate concentration suddenly rise at the same time?\n\nFires and explosions are involved in most industrial accidents. Later in this chapter we will examine some of the major issues that need consideration in accident prevention. Where are the most likely trouble spots, and what are the consequences of an incident?\n\nHeat, fire, explosion, and pressure generation are all features of undesired reactions. Reactive chemicals and materials, monomers, resins, peroxides, application interface's batteries, and explosives all have the potential to produce heat by exothermic and typically unwanted reactions. If the heat is not removed, there is the potential for a runaway reaction.\n\nWe need to understand the likelihood and to assess the impact of undesired reactions. This can be done in the laboratory on a small scale with the aim to simulate what can happen in real life on the large industrial scale. Such an understanding of heat release from chemical reactions and the potential for runaway reactions is vitally important in many branches of the chemical and allied industries. Problems occur when heat generated by a chemical process is greater than the possible heat removal, causing the temperature to rise with perhaps catastrophic effect. An example is provided at the end of the chapter to illustrate the importance of heat removal.\n\nToday, you are equipped with the ability to conduct detailed reactor analysis that can simulate unanticipated exothermic runaway reactions, mimicking what can happen on a largescale and giving worst-case data obtained under zero-heat loss conditions. In the event a chemical or system self-heats, initially (near onset of self-heating), this reaction will be slow. In chemicals this gives a loss of yield, a shelf-life issue. At this stage, heat loss is likely to pose little potential of a runaway or explosion. However, should the reaction accumulate heat, it will accelerate and as temperature rises the rate of reaction will also increase. Keeping the reaction under control is essential to avoiding a severe safety problem. It is necessary to remove this heat of reaction to control the reaction. To maintain control, heat loss must be greater than heat production.\n\nA schematic of a simple reactor system appears in Fig. 18 .4. Heat-exchanging capability is illustrated with a jacketed reactor having a cooling (or heating) fluid passing through. If the reaction mixture volume is constant, we obtain from the first law of thermodynamics (see Eq. 3.113) similar to that in Chapter 15,\n\nThe energy of stirring is dissipated into the reaction mixture, _ W s 0. Heat transfer into the reactor is accomplished by the jacket.\n\nwhere (T a \u00c0 T) m is the mean heat transfer temperature difference. Normally, log mean temperature difference is used.\n\nAssuming that the heat capacities are constant, we have 18.5) and the heat generation\n\nEq. (18.1) can be reduced to\n\nThe temperature will rise if the heat removal is not sufficient (as compared with the heat generation). At steady state,\n\nAs the rate of reaction r increases with temperature exponentially (Arrhenius law), Eq. (18.6) predicts that the heat produced will increase exponentially with temperature. However, the heat loss from vessel will only increase linearly with temperature as predicted by Eq. (18.5) .\n\nScales of reaction and/or amount of individual chemicals are different in R&D process developments, manufacturing plants, and in the transportation storage sites. The difference in the amount of chemicals poses different levels of dangers. A small amount of any chemical may not be of acute danger to humans and environment, whereas large amount of any chemical can cause significant harm. The 2015 explosion in the port city of Tianjin, China, for example, shows improper storage of chemicals (in this case, nitrocellulose and ammonium nitrate) can cause extreme harm. Over 100 lives lost to the explosion. For all potential runaway reactions, heat loss possibility and environmental conditions are important, and therefore, scale is important. A small vessel will lose more heat than a large vessel due to the available heat transfer area per volume of the reaction mixture; the large vessel is more adiabatic. A reactive material in a smaller vessel will be stable to a higher temperature than the same material in a larger vessel. The same sample may be safe in a beaker or drum, but may run away in a tanker causing an explosion. A battery may be stable as a single unit, but as a battery pack in a black-cased notebook alongside heat-producing electronic components, heat output may raise the battery temperature causing disintegration and fire. To simulate the real-life or largescale scenario, the sample under investigation must be in an environment without heat loss (or gain). The temperature where the heat production exceeds the heat loss is the temperature of no return (TNR). There is not just one TNR, this value will change as heat-loss potential changes. Vary the environment, and the TNR can be reduced significantly.\n\nThere is a large body of literature on accidents and loss prevention in the chemical industry. This involves extensive use of statistics and probabilities in assessing damage and probable outcomes, which are beyond what can be covered in this text. The journal Chemical Engineering Progress runs a section of process safety each issue, allowing readers to keep up with current developments. Safety consideration is a life-long learning process that needs constant updating as we understand more.\n\nIt is paramount to design a chemical process plant with sufficient redundancy to respond to fluctuations that may occur. As a primary issue in reactor design is minimization of costs, any redundancy will clearly add cost and complexity to the process. Design with transients and accidents in mind is clearly a complex subject. It requires careful analysis and consultation before deciding on a final design of a process.\n\nIt is also important to determine the possible outcomes that could arise if the worst possible sequence of events should occur. Weather events, such as hurricanes, allow advance planning for response since weather forecasts are generally able to predict them. However, earthquakes and tornadoes are more difficult because there are no reliable forecasts available early enough to implement a procedure to shut down a plant. Sabotage and intentional damage caused by insiders are very difficult to factor in. They require a response to conscious damage by people who are potentially well qualified to understand the maximum damage that could occur. How should one respond to a terrorist attack or a deliberate bombing act? Equipment design alone is not enough and training of personnel must be included.\n\nOne of the most spectacular chemical plant accidents ever appears in Fig. 18 .5. It occurred at an ammonium nitrate (fertilizer) factory in Ludwigshafen, Germany, on September 21, 1921. \n\nThe concept of chain reactions was discussed in Chapter 6. Also, free-radical reactions, polymerization, and depolymerization/hydrolysis chain reactions were depicted in Chapters 6 and 8. As mentioned there, the essence of these reactions are their three characteristic steps:\n\n(1) initiation, (2) propagation, and (3) termination. Combustion processes are fast and exothermic reactions that proceed by free-radical chain reactions. Combustion processes release large amounts of heat, and they have many applications in the production of power and heat, in incineration, automobiles, and even in rockets.\n\nThese processes combine many of the complexities discussed in previous chapters: complex kinetics, mass transfer control, and large temperature variations. They also frequently involve multiple phases because the oxidant is usually air, while fuels are frequently liquids or solids such as coal, wood, and oil drops.\n\nIn addition to the importance of combustion reactors in chemical processes, uncontrolled combustion reactions create the greatest potential safety hazard in nature and the chemical industry. Therefore, all bioprocess engineers need to understand the basic principles of combustion reactors to recognize the need for proper management and to see how improper management of combustion can cause disasters.\n\nWe introduced chain reaction in Chapter 6, Section 6.4, with a classic example of the decomposition of acetaldehyde to methane and carbon monoxide, Eq. (6.59). In this chapter, we choose another example, the decomposition of diethyl ether.\n\nC 2 H 5 OC 2 H 5 ! C 2 H 6 + CH 3 CHO (18.9) This reaction has an apparent rate expression of\n\nOne may mistake the reaction as \"elementary\" as the rate law \"agrees\" with the stoichiometry. However, the reaction is in fact a complex reaction with free radicals. This is indeed a simple chain reaction, and it is a prototype of many chain reactions. The mechanism by which this reaction proceeds is thought to involve four major steps:\n\nReaction (18.11 ) is the initiation step, where two free radicals are generated. Naturally, this is the slow step, requiring the breakage of a methyl bond from the diethyl ether. For a chain/ radical reaction, the initiation step is important as it is the starting point. Radicals are generated in the initiation step to allow the reaction to occur. In many applications, the initial radicals can be generated elaborately by using an initiator or substance that requires low energy to break into radicals. UV irradiation, reactor wall surface construction, and high temperature (or heat) are common methods of promoting the initiation step. Table 18 .7 shows some of the bond energies that can be exploited for free-radical initiation. The carbon-iodate bonds are generally weak. The tertiary CdH bond in isobutane is fairly weak (404 kJ/mol) compared to other bonds in the molecule. Allyl and the benzyl bonds are of the lowest energy compared with others due to their \u03c0-electron sharing capabilities.\n\nSteps (18.12) and (18.13) are propagation steps, with reactions occurring but a different free radical is produced while consuming one. The free radicals are not reduced by these reactions. The propagation steps are generally fast. Therefore, it is known that chain reactions are unlikely to stop until the reactants are exhausted.\n\nThe last step, Eq. (18.14), is the termination step, when two free radicals are combined to form a stable molecule. In this case, the termination step is the reverse step of the initiation step.\n\nWhile the free radicals in the chain reactions are unstable and very active, there are substances that can adsorb free radicals and stop them from propagation. These substances are known as scavengers. Scavengers can be employed to stabilize chemicals that tend to decompose through chain reactions.\n\nChain reactions can also be very sensitive to the materials used for constructing the walls of the reactor because the adsorption and reaction properties of the walls in promoting or retarding termination and initiation steps depend on the nature of these surfaces. These effects have caused much difficulty in establishing the true rates of chain reactions and, more important, have led to accidents when chain reactions propagated unexpectedly because of unpredicted kinetics, which can be quite different from those obtained in a small lab reactor. One common difference is that lab data are frequently obtained in glass-walled vessels, which are quite unreactive, while large-scale reactors are frequently made of steel, whose walls have different reactivities.\n\nBioprocess engineers need to be strongly aware of the size effects in scaling up any process that might involve chain reaction processes, for example, pyrolysis, gasification, and the more simple ones discussed earlier. The lab data, even if carefully obtained, may not explain large reactor behavior. For a given reactor geometry, the wall surface area per volume is higher for smaller reactors. The rate of a chain reaction may be much higher in a large reactor. This might be good news unless the rate is too high and results in reactor runaway, where the temperature cannot be controlled. Similarly, one may be planning to run a process that does not occur by chain reactions, but in a large reactor, a side reaction that occurs by a chain reaction could take over and dominate the process. Combining complicated kinetics with the possibility of thermal runaway can make engineers old before their time.\n\nEveryone who works in a bioprocess or chemical laboratory is warned that organic chemicals should never be stored for long times because they can explode without warning or apparent provocation. Bottles of organic chemicals should always be disposed of within a few years, and, if a chemical is found that might be very old, a \"bomb squad\" of safety experts should be called to remove it and properly dispose of it. Why do all organic chemicals just sitting around the laboratory at room temperature have the potential to explode spontaneously? The answer is that they can react with oxygen, in the air at room temperature in chain reactions to form organic peroxides, which can spontaneously react explosively upon shaking or opening the cap. Organic peroxides are examples of compounds that have fuel (C and H atoms) in the same compound with the oxidant, and these are solid and liquid explosives similar to dynamite and TNT.\n\nIn this section we will consider the mechanism by which a harmless organic molecule can react with oxygen at room temperature to form a potentially lethal system. Then we will discuss positive applications of this process, which are the primary processes by which such common chemicals such as acetone, phenol, isobutylene, styrene, and propylene glycol are made commercially.\n\nConsider any organic molecule, which we will call RdH, where R\u2022 could be an alkyl or any fragment containing C, H, and O atoms. In the presence of O 2 , this molecule can undergo the autooxidation reaction R \u00c0 H + O 2 ! ROOH (18.15) This reaction never happens significantly as a single step at any temperature because the RdH bond strength is >330 kJ/mol for any CdH bond as shown in Table 18 .7. However, consider the chain reaction sequence\n\nIf we add the second and third steps, we obtain the chain reaction (18.15) R \u00c0 H + O 2 ! ROOH (18.15) by which a hydrocarbon is converted into a peroxide. The first step is a very slow dissociation step, with an activation energy >330 kJ/mol. However, once the radical R\u2022 is made, it will rapidly react with O 2 to form the alkylperoxy radical, which is also very reactive and can abstract an H atom from any organic molecule in the solution to form the relatively stable (until someone shakes the bottle) alkyl peroxide.\n\nWe call this type of reaction autooxidation because it is an autocatalytic process (the reaction generates radical intermediates that propagate chain reactions) and it is an oxidation that converts alkanes into alkyl peroxides.\n\nThis chain reaction is just like those discussed previously, except now the reactants are an organic molecule and O 2 , and the product is a potentially explosive hydroperoxide. It can be sketched as a chain in Fig. 18 .6.\n\nThe features of this chain reaction that make it so explosive are:\n\n1. Organic peroxides have high exothermic heats of decomposition because they carry both fuel and oxidant in one molecule. We will discuss this part of the process (the explosion) later in this chapter.\n\nsafe for centuries if the cap is impermeable to oxygen and is kept tightly fastened. (A cork is not a suitable cap.) However, one never knows whether someone may have left the cap off or loose for some time to allow the peroxide to form significantly. 3. This reaction depends crucially on the initiation step, and different molecules have vastly different capabilities of dissociation. The major problem here is that the initiation step can be initiated by a trace amount of an impurity that no one knows is in the bottle. As examples, all tertiary CdH bonds are fairly weak, as are the CdH bonds in aldehydes and alkenes. The reaction can be initiated by traces of these compounds, and the chain is propagated throughout all molecules in the otherwise quite unreactive liquid. 4. The initiation step can be photoinduced. If a bottle is sitting in sunlight, UV photons (fluorescent lights are also more dangerous than incandescent lights) can cause photodissociation to initiate the chain reaction much faster than in the dark. This is the reason why many chemicals are sold in brown bottles.\n\nSince one cannot be sure about the history of any old bottle of a chemical in a common laboratory, one should always dispose of old chemicals very carefully.\n\nAlthough not as dramatic as explosion, spoilage of food is a very important bioprocess issue in the food industry. This has two main forms: biological organism (bacterial, fungi, or yeast) growth, and oxidation.\n\nIn biological organism growth, improper sterilization during processing leaves organisms that reproduce and cause problems by creating large concentrations of organisms that taste bad or, even worse, make the consumer sick. In fact, as we learned in Chapter 17, no sterilization is absolute or 100% effective. Living organisms grow exponentially, so the concentration of microorganism biomass in foods is inherently unpredictable. These organisms have two varieties, aerobic and anaerobic, signifying growth with or without oxygen. Aerobic microorganism growth is basically an oxidation process, but the organism can be regarded as a catalyst for oxidation. Anaerobic organisms are in fact more dangerous than aerobic organisms because they tend to produce more dangerous toxins, such as botulism and salmonella.\n\nAnother significant spoilage mechanism of food is autooxidation. Here O 2 from air at room temperature causes oxidation of ingredients in food to produce molecules such as aldehydes and organic acids, both of which generally taste bad, although they are not usually toxic. The mechanism of food turning rancid is the same as we discussed earlier: peroxide formation, which is autocatalytic, leading to rapid propagation. As in all of these processes, the rate is controlled by traces of particular compounds that initiate peroxide formation, which then propagates throughout the food sample.\n\nNo amount of sterilization will prevent or even slow autooxidation, and there are only two defenses: removal of O 2 and addition of inhibitors. Oxygen barriers in food packaging are a major topic in the engineering of polymer films. The barrier properties of various polymers are very important in food applications, and many of these are multilayer polymers that have a thin layer of an impermeable polymer (such as polyacrylonitrile and ionic polymers) on a cheaper but O 2 -permeable polymer such as a polyolefin, which gives mechanical strength to the film.\n\nThe other method of oxidation prevention in foods is the addition of antioxidants. Nitrite solutions on meat or lettuce preserve the red or green color and make the package look fresher. The long lists of additional ingredients on packages of foods are either antioxidants or chemicals that inhibit bacterial growth. The phrase \"all natural ingredients\" on a package means that you need to be especially careful regarding spoilage.\n\nOne example of autooxidation you have experienced is the room temperature oxidation of alcohol in wine. Within days and sometimes within minutes of opening a bottle of wine, the taste begins to deteriorate because of autooxidation. This converts the ethanol into acetaldehyde and to acetic acid. Wine lovers talk about letting the wine \"breathe\" after opening; so apparently some oxidation actually improves the taste. Distilled vinegar is made by the intentional oxidation of the alcohol in fermented apple juice into acetic acid, which can then be distilled from the juice and pulp.\n\nBoth biological reactions and autooxidation reactions in food are complex problems because both are highly autocatalytic. Their occurrence is therefore quite variable between nominally identical samples of food. When a reaction is both unpredictable and intolerable, the bioprocess engineer must be especially alert.\n\nThere is considerable hype in the popular culture about the role of antioxidants in promoting human health, from preventing cancer to slowing aging. These molecules presumably act to prevent autooxidation within our bodies. The processes are very complex and not well understood because they are different in different regions of our bodies and because the foods and additives we consume may be rapidly transformed into other molecules that may or may not be antioxidants. These molecules act as free-radical scavengers within our bodies, which prevent the chain reactions of autooxidation. Because these processes are so complex, no one knows how a particular chemical will act when ingested, and therefore additives can be sold that have no beneficial effect.\n\nRoom temperature oxidation processes supply the energy by which we exist. However, it is important that only the proper oxidation reactions occur in our bodies and not the ones that cause our skin to wrinkle and our brains to perform badly on exams. If you could come up with a chemical to assist in either of these, you could become very wealthy.\n\nWe will next consider the complexities of combustion, which are caused by the fact that combustion reactions are chain reactions. Combustion reactions are extremely fast and exothermic, and, therefore, once the reaction is ignited, the process proceeds very quickly and becomes very nonisothermal. We will consider two exothermic chain reactions involving gases-the oxidation of H 2 and alkanes. Then we will consider combustion of liquid and solid fuels, a gas-liquid process. These processes all occur very rapidly and at very high temperatures.\n\nA simple prototype of combustion reactions is hydrogen oxidation, Table 18 .8. Listed in Table 18 .8 are the rate coefficients of the forward reactions shown. Rate constants are given in the form\n\nAll reactions are bimolecular. The 19 reverse reaction rate coefficients k \u00c0 are found from the equilibrium constants k \u00c0 \u00bc k/K eq .\n\nA simplified reaction scheme captures many features of this reaction. First, the reaction is initiated by generation of free radicals, with the lowest activation energy process being H 2 dissociation,\n\n\u00c1 , E \u00bc 435 kJ=mol (18.21) which is reaction 8 in These three reactions are propagation reactions involving a free radical attacking a parent to form another free radical. Note that only the last reaction produces the stable product H 2 O.\n\nIf we add another reaction 18.25) and add all four of the propagation reactions, we see that all the radical species cancel, leaving only the simple reaction 18.26) which is the stoichiometric reaction producing water from hydrogen and oxygen at high temperatures, although hydrogen peroxide H 2 O 2 is also produced in measurable amounts in low temperature processes. The reactions in this chain reaction are shown in Fig. 18 .7. This reaction sequence is similar to that described for diethyl ether decomposition to ethane and acetaldehyde. Reactions that produce stable products actually occur only through radicals attacking the parent and eventually producing the stable products (C 2 H 6 , CH 3 CHO, and H 2 O in these examples). However, the complete reaction mechanism of the hydrogen oxidation reaction is much more complex, both in its number of reaction steps, number of intermediates (OOH and H 2 O 2 ), and observed behavior. A mixture of H 2 and O 2 can sit in a dry bulb for many years with absolutely no H 2 O detected. However, if water is initially present, the reaction will begin, and if a spark is ignited or a grain of platinum is added to the mixture at room temperature, the reaction will occur instantly and explosively.\n\nThe reaction cannot begin without initiation of free radicals, and H 2 dissociation is very slow. Therefore, the few H atoms produced by the initiation steps may diffuse to the walls of the vessel and recombine before they can begin chain reactions. However, the presence of H 2 O accelerates the rate of the reaction because it causes formation of traces of H 2 O 2 , which easily dissociates and forms more H\u2022 and \u2022OH, which initiate the reaction by attack of H 2 and O 2 , and these reactions rapidly produce more radicals, which strongly accelerate the process.\n\nA spark generates many radical species in the spark gap, and these can propagate radicals throughout the vessel. A platinum surface catalyzes the reaction (H 2 and O 2 readily dissociate on a Pt catalyst surface to begin the reaction), and the surface reaction then heats the Pt to a high temperature, where homogeneous reaction begins rapidly. Thus, we see that premixed H 2 and O 2 mixtures behave very unpredictably. They are usually quite unreactive, but moisture or a trace chemical such as H 2 O 2 , a spark, a trace of a catalyst (perhaps undetectable), or a hot surface can cause rapid and uncontrolled reaction.\n\nThe explosion limits of the H 2 + O 2 reaction have been studied thoroughly, and these limits exhibit an interesting variation with pressure. At low pressures, the reaction is stable because radicals diffuse to the walls of the chamber and prevent chain branching, which leads to an explosion. At very high pressure, radical quenching by diffusion to the walls is slowed down, and the heat released by the reaction leads to a thermal explosion (Fig. 18.8) .\n\nThe boundaries between stable flames and explosions are very fuzzy because they depend on traces of chemicals in the vessel, which may act as initiators or scavengers, and they P, Torr depend strongly on the size and composition of the walls of the vessel. These diagrams are shown to illustrate the complexities in predicting the behavior of any chain reaction, even a simple one such as H 2 + O 2 .\n\nIn the reaction steps for H 2 oxidation, the first two reactions are chain-branching reactions with one radical species producing two other radicals every time a reaction event occurs. The first of these probably proceeds by the steps (18.27) and the hydroperoxy radical \u2022OOH reacts immediately at high temperatures but can be observed in finite concentrations at low temperatures.\n\nNote that this reaction produces two reactive free radicals from one. We call these chainbranching reactions because the propagation steps produce more radical species than they start with. Thus, the propagation steps can also increase the concentration of free-radical species, and further destabilize the kinetics. We call a propagation step in which one radical species is produced for each radical reacting a linear chain, while a process that produces more radicals is called a branched chain. These are sketched in Fig. 18 .9.\n\nMost combustion reactions involve chain-branching reaction steps. Under conditions where these steps are less significant than linear chain reactions, the reaction appears to be stable; but when the chain-branching steps dominate, the overall reaction rate can accelerate uncontrollably.\n\nRecall that in the previous autooxidation discussion, hydroperoxide species were sufficiently stable at low temperatures so that only linear chains formed. When the bottle of peroxides explodes, chain-branching steps such as ROOH ! R \u00c1 + \u00c1 O + \u00c1 OH (18.28) begin to become significant. This is a chain-branching reaction because one radical-prone molecule produces three radicals. The rapid rise in the concentration of radical species can accelerate the decomposition reaction of a bottle containing peroxide rapidly and catastrophically.\n\nOne of the most important combustion reactions in industry and in home heating is natural gas combustion,\n\nwhere the propagation steps produce more than one radical so that the process tends to grow exponentially, leading to a rapid acceleration of the reaction and possibly a chain-branching explosion.\n\nThe transportability of natural gas in pipelines and the clean combustion in its oxidation make it the fuel of choice in many applications.\n\nAs one might guess from our previous example of H 2 oxidation, this reaction is extremely complex. The standard model involves over 300 reaction steps among approximately 30 chemical species. Here even the stable product species can be complex, with CO, HCHO (formaldehyde), and soot (carbon) being among the highly undesired pollutants in CH 4 combustion. Since H 2 , O 2 , and H 2 O are involved as intermediates and products, the 38 reaction steps in the H 2 + O 2 reaction listed in Table 18 .8 (the 19 reversible reactions) are in the set of the reactions that are involved in CH 4 oxidation.\n\nWe will not attempt to describe the mechanism of this process except to note that an important initiation step is CH 4 dissociation, CH 4 ! \u00c1 CH 3 + H \u00c1 , E \u00bc 438:9 kJ=mol (18.30) with the H\u2022 and the \u2022CH 3 active to attack O 2 and begin propagation steps.\n\nMixtures of natural gas and air are similarly unpredictable, being quite stable and unreactive until a spark or a hot surface ignites reaction, and then thermal and chainbranching autocatalysis takes off and so does the building.\n\nSimilar but even more complex mechanisms operate in the combustion of higher hydrocarbons. Initiation is easier because the CdH bonds can be weaker. The CH 4 + O 2 reactions are a subset of all hydrocarbons since CH 4 is one of the possible decomposition products of higher hydrocarbons.\n\nOne much employed example is combustion of gasoline in the engine cylinders of an automobile. Here the fuel is injected into the combustion chamber as a vapor with air at nearly the stoichiometric composition for complete combustion, and a spark ignites the mixture to create pressure, which forces the piston down. Details of ignition reactions determine issues such as engine knock or flooding, with branched aliphatics and small fuel molecules being advantageous for both of these problems. High-octane alkanes produce fewer chainbranching radicals during the compression of the air-fuel mixture, and this avoids engine knock, which will occur if ignition occurs spontaneously before the spark plug fires to ignite the alkane-air mixture at the start of the power stroke.\n\nIn the diesel engine, the jet engine, and kerosene combustion, liquid fuel is sprayed into the combustion chamber with air, and the liquid is not totally vaporized before ignition. Therefore, in drop combustion there are flames around the liquid drops that shrink as the reaction proceeds. This and wood and coal combustion are examples of the shrinking sphere problem of Chapter 17.\n\nWe note finally that for most of these processes no one knows their kinetics. Rates have been measured with great precision in the laboratory under specific conditions, but in engineering applications, the processes are so complex that these kinetics are not useful. In almost all situations, the rates of reaction are controlled by mass and heat transfer rates, and the fluid flow is turbulent. As the actual reaction steps depend on mass transfer (ignition by initiators and termination reactions at surfaces), it is a very complicated problem.\n\nThe complexity and importance of combustion reactions have resulted in active research in computational chemistry. It is now possible to determine reaction rate coefficients from quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics using the ideas of reaction mechanisms as discussed in Chapter 6. These rate coefficient data are then used in large computer programs that calculate reactor performance in complex chain reaction systems. These computations can sometimes be done more economically than carrying out the relevant experiments. This is especially important for reactions that may be dangerous to carry out experimentally, because no one is hurt if a computer program blows up. On the other hand, errors in calculations can lead to inaccurate predictions, which can also be dangerous.\n\nMost chemical accidents have occurred because some of these effects were not expected or accounted for, and most of the research on combustion processes originated in an effort to explain the unexpected and potentially hazardous. Thermal ignition contributes another safety hazard in combustion processes.\n\nOur first example of a chain reaction, the decomposition of diethyl ether to ethane and acetaldehyde, is endothermic; so the reactor tends to cool as reaction proceeds. However, the oxidation of H 2 is exothermic by 238 kJ/mol of H 2 , and the oxidation of CH 4 to CO 2 and H 2 O is exothermic by 803 kJ/mol of CH 4 . Thus, as these reactions proceed, heat is released and the temperature tends to increase (strongly!). Thus, thermal ignition is very important in most combustion processes.\n\nIn addition to ignition of gases, liquids and solids can also exhibit ignition phenomena. A classic example is the \"spontaneous combustion\" of oily rags containing paint solvents or automobile oil. One does not want to store large quantities of these rags together, because they can suddenly heat up and catch fire. Another example is the spontaneous combustion of coal piles and of underground coalfields. A large pile of coal will almost inevitably catch fire and burn, and barges of coal must be transported and unloaded quickly or the barge will begin to burn, a quite unpleasant experience for the sailors, especially if far from port.\n\nFor a pile of wood, coal, or hay, the burning stability is dependent on the temperature, moisture, and spark. Assuming that the pile is reasonably large, the limitation would be oxygen availability. Fig. 18.10 shows some examples of uncontrolled or open biomass burning. In this case, one could use a simple CSTR model to describe the burning of a pile of biomass or coal. The feed (reactant) to the reactor is air or O 2 , and the products are CO 2 , CO, and H 2 O.\n\nWe have already dealt with nonisothermal reactors and their effects in Chapter 15 and a brief review in Section 18.3. The major and potentially most dangerous application of these effects is in combustion reactors. Consider our standard CSTR with parameters as indicated in Fig. 18 .11.\n\nRecall from Chapter 15 that the steady-state energy-balance equations in a CSTR can be reduced to a single equation, which we wrote by considering the rates of heat generation and removal. We wrote these, from Eq. (18.7), as runaway   FIG. 18.11 Heat generation and removal for combustion reaction in a CSTR. When the feed temperature increases (or feed rate decreases) slightly, the rate can go from nearly zero to nearly completion when the heat removal (straight) line becomes tangent to the heat generation curve and the steady-state temperature jumps to a high value.\n\nwhere U is the effective heat transfer coefficient, A H is the heat transfer area, A B is the surface area of the biomass (or coal) pile, r 00 is the rate of reaction based on surface area, and reactant (or species) A refers to oxygen (O 2 ). We then rearranged this equation to become Eq. (18.5) or (18.32) and we constructed a graphical solution by plotting the left-hand side H R (T) and the righthand side H G (T) versus T, as repeated in Fig. 18 .11. Consider an oxidation reaction in this CSTR. Suppose we begin at the lower steady state, where the reaction rate and the rate of heat generation are very low. If the feed temperature T 0 and the wall temperature T a are low, there is little reaction, and we would detect negligible temperature change. However, if we increase T 0 or T a , slightly (and the straight line moves rightward in parallel as shown in dashed line), the system can jump to the upper steady state. Alternatively, if the feed rate is decreased and the straight line has decreased slope (also shown as dashed line passing through T 0 ), the system jumps to the upper steady state. These situations have been discussed in Chapter 15.\n\nIf this is a combustion process in which the rate has a very large effective activation energy, H R is very large and negative, and Q\u03a3C j0 C Pj is small (undiluted gases), then these effects become very large. One therefore observes a situation where the rate is effectively zero for one temperature because the effective activation energy is very large. A slight change in any parameter can cause the system to jump to the upper steady state, where the reaction goes to completion and the temperature goes to the adiabatic flame temperature.\n\nFor H 2 or CH 4 in air near stoichiometric compositions (28% H 2 , in air, and 9.5% CH 4 , in air, respectively), the temperature jumps from ambient to >2000\u00b0(it does not make much difference whether one uses\u00b0C or K units for this calculation), and the reactor almost certainly explodes.\n\nFor a coal pile, a dry wood pile, or a barrel of oily rags, there is a slow flow of air through the pile or reactor with a large residence time, and processes are slow enough (an autooxidation process) that the composition is nearly uniform. A slight increase in temperature (perhaps a warm day) can cause the rate of oxidation of the alkane in the oil or the carbon in the coal or the biomass in wood to oxidize, and at some T 0 , the \"reactor\" will suddenly ignite and burn. Once this happens, natural convection forces air rapidly through the barrel or coal pile and \"fans\" the flame. Underground coalfields are especially difficult to extinguish because there are many holes in the ground that act as inlets and outlets for the \"reactor.\" While the CSTR model is extremely primitive, the ideas of size dependence and differences in rate for air flow before and after ignition explain many of the features of these troublesome chemical reactors.\n\nSo far we have seen examples of thermal and chemical autocatalysis in Chapters 8, 11, and 15. The thermal autocatalysis can be viewed through the Arrhenius law,\n\nwhere reaction rate (constant) increases exponentially with increasing temperature. When heat is generated (exothermic reactions), temperature rises in the reactor and thus increases the reaction rate. In return, faster heat generation is expected. This is the thermal autocatalysis.\n\nIn the hot-water extraction example described in Chapter 8, the catalyst proton H + (or H 3 O + ) was generated during the extraction reactions. In Chapters 11 and 12, we examined the cell growth. Cell is produced and it is also the catalyst for more growth. These reactions can be modeled as A + R ! 2R (18.34) because the reaction generates the catalyst after we added the catalyst to initiate the process. Another example was the chain-branching reaction, such as (18.22) H \u00c1 + O 2 ! OH + O \u00c1 (18.22) just described in hydrogen oxidation. The bioreactions were nearly isothermal, but combustion processes are both chain branching and autothermal, and therefore they combine chemical and thermal autocatalysis, a tricky combination to maintain under control and of which bioprocess engineers should always be wary. This suggests immediately the definition of autocatalysis. A reactive intermediate or heat can act as a catalyst to promote the reaction or, more precisely, increase reaction rate. However, in contrast to conventional catalysis, we do not add the catalyst from outside the system, but the catalyst is generated by the reaction. We may add promoters or heat to initiate the process, which then accelerates by autocatalysis. Conversely, we may add inhibitors or cool the reactor to prevent both types of autocatalysis.\n\nThe best inhibitor of autocatalysis is to have a small system. Surfaces act as both sinks of free radicals to increase termination and as sinks of heat (larger heat transfer area) to prevent thermal runaway, and small systems have large surface-to-volume ratios to prevent these runaway possibilities.\n\nIn this section we consider the combustion of premixed gaseous fuel and air mixtures. Consider first the laboratory Bunsen burner one can see frequently in a biosafety cabin/workstation, shown in Fig. 18 .12. Natural gas from the gas supply system enters the bottom of the burner, where it is mixed with air, with flow rates adjusted by the gas valve, and holes in the bottom of the burner allow air to be sucked in by natural convection. The premixed gases travel up the barrel of the burner (a tubular reactor), and, if flows are suitably adjusted and a match has been used to ignite the mixture, a stable flame forms at the top of the tube. If the flow rate is too low, the flame will flash back and propagate back up the tube to the mixing point and extinguish. If the flow rate is too high, the flame will lift off the top of the tube and either extinguish or burn as a turbulent lifted flame.\n\nYou have probably noticed that is it nearly impossible to maintain a stable flame within the tube of a Bunsen burner; it will either burn at the top or flash back to the mixing point. There is usually no stable steady state for a flame reaction in a straight tube.\n\nThis points out major characteristics of premixed flames: (1) They cannot be controlled stably within a constant-diameter tubular reactor configuration; and (2) the chain-branching reactions and the heat release tend to make them either blow out or flash back into the tube and extinguish.\n\nFlames are characterized by a flame velocity u F , which is the velocity with which a flame front will move down a tube containing stagnant premixed gases. The upper and lower compositions where the flame velocity goes to zero are called the flammability limits, and the flame velocity is usually its maximum near the stoichiometric composition for CO 2 and H 2 O formation.\n\nThe reason why it is difficult to sustain a flame within a tube is that the flame will be stable only if u \u00bc u F (18.35) where u is the flow velocity for the PFR (plug flow reactor). It is virtually impossible to adjust the flow velocity to be exactly u F . Even if this occurs, the flame is only neutrally stable; it will drift up or down the tube. Flow in the tube will be parabolic if the flow is laminar (Re < 2100), and thus gases near the center of the tube may propagate downstream, while gases near the wall propagate upstream toward the mixing point. This further destabilizes a premixed flame within a tube.\n\nPremixed flames can only be stabilized by providing an expansion section in the tube where the cross section increases so that u slows, creating a zone where u \u00bc u F and a flame is stable. In a Bunsen burner, this is achieved quite simply by having the flame height vary as u changes within the tube so that a burning surface (roughly a cone) is maintained stable over a large range of flow rates. At the exit of the tube, the flow velocity decreases over a wide range so that the flame is quite stable.\n\nThe other stabilizer of flames is cold surfaces. These act to lower u F in the region of the surface and thus create a stable edge to the flame at the wall of the burner. This occurs both by thermally quenching the reaction near the surface and by quenching free radicals by adsorption on the surfaces, which stops the combustion reactions.\n\nOne very important device that uses this principle is the flame arrestor, which is inserted in pipes to prevent flames from propagating between pieces of gas-handling equipment. These are usually metal shavings (steel wool) inserted in tubes at strategic distances to stop any flames that may travel down the tube.\n\nWhen the air inlet is shut off in a Bunsen burner, the flame can still be maintained, but it switches from the blue color of a normal CH 4 flame to the yellow of a diffusion flame. This is the situation of a gas stove. Pure CH 4 flows up the tube, and the O 2 from outside the tube is mixed with CH 4 just above the tube, with flow of air driven by natural convection below the hot product gas mixture. This burner, a butane lighter, a candle, a burning log, and a match (after ignition) are all examples of diffusion flames where one generally provides the fuel and relies on natural convection of air to provide the oxidant.\n\nDiffusion flames are much more stable than premixed flames because the rate of the reaction is limited by the supply of air and its diffusion into the fuel region to form the flame front. Several examples of diffusion flames are given in Fig. 18 .13. These all typically have cylindrical symmetry, with air surrounding the fuel in the center. The cylindrical laminar flame is simplest to sketch because it is two dimensional in composition (direction of flow z and radial position from the center r), with composition profiles as shown in Fig. 18 .14. Gaseous fuel and air are admitted through separate slots, and the reaction proceeds along the line of contact. The gases are convected in the vertical flow z-direction, and horizontal diffusion (x) between the fuel and air create the flammable mixture.\n\nOne can model this system in principle using the differential mass-and energy-balance equations written with the principles shown in Chapter 3 with flow in the z direction and diffusion in both the flow direction and the lateral x direction to obtain profiles of C A (z, x) and T(z, x). One can see immediately that this will be a very complex mathematical problem to solve because there are many species (at least 30 for natural gas flames), but the problem will be made even more complex because of natural convection. Since the temperature in the flame varies from 25\u00b0C to >2000\u00b0C in short distances, the density in and above the flame decreases dramatically (by nearly a factor of 10), and this causes large buoyancy effects, which accelerate the gases in the vertical direction. This provides the air flow in many diffusion flames, but it can also create turbulence, which causes greatly enhanced mixing or flowinduced diffusion/dispersion above that which would occur by molecular diffusion.\n\nThere is another distinction between flames: laminar versus turbulent. Small flames are generally steady and laminar, while large flames exhibit visible turbulent eddies. Candles and fireplaces are well-known examples where in still air the flame is steady, but, when there is wind or one blows on the flame, the flame flickers.\n\nOne can describe these phenomena through the Reynolds number (forced convection) and Raleigh number (natural convection), but the reader can see immediately that the situations are so complicated that correlations in elementary texts on fluid flow are not easily applicable to predicting flame behavior. Reactive flows are among the most complex problems in modern engineering.\n\nHeat considerations give the first estimate of the characteristics of combustion. As discussed in Chapters 3 and 4, the adiabatic reaction temperature (frequently called the adiabatic flame temperature) gives an approximation to the final temperature,\n\nWe need to be especially careful in using this equation to try to describe combustion accurately. Since the final temperature is so large, the heat capacity C P is not at all constant. Further, there are many reactions and products in flames, and one has to use the multiplereaction version of this equation for accurate calculations. The intermediates, which are at negligible concentrations at low temperature, have significant concentrations at high temperature. For example, the water dissociation reaction (18.37) has an equilibrium constant that predicts considerable H\u2022 and \u2022OH in the high temperature of most flames.\n\nAnother consideration in flames is radiation. The light that one sees in a flame is mostly fluorescence from the radiation of particular radical species formed in electronically excited states. (The blue color from CH 4 flames is CH\u2022 emission.) Gases also radiate blackbody radiation, primarily in the infrared. The glow from burning wood or coal is blackbody emission radiated from the surface.\n\nThe emission observed from cracks in a burning wood surface is brighter because the emission from a cavity has the equilibrium blackbody distribution, which is independent of the emissivity of the surface. Also, most of the heat from a campfire is from radiation if you are beside the fire. The air beside the campfire is close to the ambient temperature because natural convection is drawing it up into the rising flame. Most of the emission from combustion processes is in the infrared and is not visible, but a large fraction of the energy carried off from combustion processes is in the form of radiation heat transfer.\n\nIn practice, there is only a certain range of compositions where premixed gases will burn. There is obviously a great deal of interest in this composition because it sets the limits of operation of many processes. The ignition limit is only loosely defined because it depends sensitively on temperature, flow conditions, and the presence of trace chemicals in the fuel, which can act as flame initiators or inhibitors by enhancing or slowing either rate of initiation or rate of termination.\n\nA very important consideration in flammability is the presence of surfaces. Cold surfaces act as free-radical quenchers and maintain the gas temperature below the ignition temperature, while hot surfaces can act as igniters.\n\nMany of the industrial accidents in the chemical industry originated from reaction systems that were quite stable in small containers but exploded when larger reactors were used.\n\nOne of the traditional ways of generating heat and power for human use is by burning a fuel. Solid wood and coal have been very important fuels since our cave-dwelling ancestors, and both are still important fuels in heating and power generation. Their combustion has characteristics that are common to most solids combustion processes.\n\nThe first step when coal or wood particles (we call them chunks or powder and logs or chips, respectively) burn is pyrolysis, in which heat causes the water and volatile organics to evaporate. These gases then burn in oxygen in the boundary layer in the first stage of burning.\n\nCoal and wood decompose to give many small organic molecules such as alkanes, aromatics, alcohols, aldehydes and ketones, and organic acids. As an example, methanol is still sometimes called wood alcohol because it was first obtained by heating wood in a kiln and condensing the products, one of which was methanol. In the 19th century, coal and wood were the major sources of many chemicals such as acetic acid and acetone, and coal was a major source of chemicals such as benzene. As noted previously, among the products from coal were chemicals called coal tars, from which highly colored dyes could be extracted. The demand for reliable and cheaper dye sources prompted the development of organic chemistry for the systematic search for new colored dyes, and this led to the giant European chemical companies such as AkzoNobel and BASF.\n\nPyrolysis of biomass has gained interest again in the 21st century with the public awareness of CO 2 and climate change. Biomass can be pyrolyzed to produce liquefied carbohydrates, which can be further converted to liquid fuel and chemicals. Slow pyrolysis carbonizes more while fast pyrolysis produces more vapor products, as shown in Fig. 18 .15.\n\nWoody biomass has an approximate stoichiometry of CH 1.4-1.6 O 0.65-0.7 . It still requires oxygen to burn. In the biomass energy applications studied today, the energy value is desired to be kept in the final products and thus less oxygen addition is required. Addition of oxygen is used only to provide heat to raise the system temperature. Thermal or hydrothermal treatment of woody biomass can be applied in wide temperature ranges. Torrefaction occurs between 200\u00b0C and 320\u00b0C, when the solid material is partial carbonized by devolatilizing the biomass. Commercial pyrolysis is normally carried out under oxygen-lean environment, below a temperature of 600\u00b0C. As the temperature is increased, more gas products are produced. Gasification is normally conducted between 700\u00b0C and 1000\u00b0C.\n\nPyrolysis of woody biomass produces char (solid residue), liquid (biooil or oil), and gas (or syngas). Fig. 18 .15 shows the typical yields of pyrolysis as a function of pyrolysis temperature. Table 18 .9 shows typical compositions and yields of pyrolysis of switchgrass. For char (solid fraction) productions, the pyrolysis is under low temperature (usually < 400\u00b0C) with long residence time, whereas fast pyrolysis (<1 s) at about 500\u00b0C is ideal for liquid (\"oil\") production.\n\nDuring pyrolysis, each component pyrolyzes differently. Cellulose undergoes cracking of glycosidic bonds to produce levoglucosan and isomers (up to 80% conversion in the absence of alkali metals) as well as ring-opening and reforming to produce low-molecular-weight oxyginates (acids, aldehydes, ketones), furfural and 5-hydroxylmethyl furfural, heterocyclic compounds, and so on. Hemicellulose thermal cracks to furans and to sugars in the absence of alkali metals. Lignin is rendered to pyrolytic lignin (relative large molecules). Pyrolysis reactions of biomass are catalyzed by alkali metal salts. One can expect less liquid production when alkali metal salts are present. Table 18 .10 shows the elemental composition of the whole pyrolysis oil (aqueous phase + oil phase) as well as those of the original switchgrass. One can observe that the oil is slightly less oxygenated than the switchgrass itself. The two phases of the oil have very different densities: 1100 kg/m 3 for aqueous phase and 920 kg/m 3 for oil phase.\n\nThe composition of the char varies with temperature and residence time as well during the pyrolysis. Table 18 .11 shows that as the pyrolysis time increases from 1 to 3 h, the concentration carbon increases in the char. As the pyrolysis temperature is increased, there is a marked increase in the carbon concentration in the char and a decrease in the concentrations of hydrogen and oxygen. Fig. 18 .16 shows that the stoichiometry of the (residue) solid material after pyrolysis of biomass is close to that of coal as pyrolysis temperature and residence time increases.\n\nOnce the volatile products have been pyrolyzed, one is left with a material that is mostly carbon, and the residual solid is called coke (from coal or wood) and charcoal (from slow pyrolysis of wood). Coke was used in blast furnaces to make iron (the volatiles would make the process less reproducible in reducing Fe 2 O 3 ) by our ancestors, while charcoal was used in soap (mainly the alkalis in the ash) and as an adsorbent. Coke and charcoal are highly porous, coke forms from wood with the holes left behind when the volatile components evaporate, and charcoal remains from the cellular framework of wood fibers. Addition of limited air in pyrolysis produces more volatile products and makes a more porous carbon residue. Active carbon is made this way.\n\nThese carbon residues then can be burned with air in the second stage of combustion. There are two modes of carbon combustion, with and without flames. If there is no flame over the carbon, then reaction occurs by surface reaction. There are multiple steps for the surface reaction: mass transfer of oxygen to the surface, (dissociative) adsorption of oxygen on the carbon active centers (C \u03c3 ), reaction or transformation to form a CO or CO 2 molecule, and release of the gas molecule into the surroundings (exposing carbon active centers from below). (18.39) or to CO 2 2C \u03c3 \u00c1 O ! C \u03c3 + CO 2 g \u00c0 \u00c1 (18.40) if the reaction is deficient in O 2 . When there is a flame, burning is by both surface and homogeneous reactions. The surface reaction is primarily Eq. (18.39) and the homogeneous reaction is primarily CO + 1=2O 2 ! CO 2 (18.41) although this is in fact a free-radical chain reaction with many steps. This creates a reacting boundary layer over the coke or charcoal particle with reactant and product composition profiles as illustrated in Fig. 18 .17.\n\nThere is therefore typically a progression of burning of solids involving first a homogeneous reaction, where volatile gases are driven off and burn, followed by a homogeneousheterogeneous reaction, where both homogeneous and surface reactions occur in a boundary layer, followed by a surface reaction, where glowing coals react only on the surface.\n\nAlmost everyone has seen a campfire or charcoal grill. When a log is placed in a campfire, it first sputters and pops when water trapped within the solid is released as the temperature rises. Then, flames are observed around the log when flame jets form as the organics escape from cracks in the log, but the surface remains dark. After most of these organics have escaped, the wood surface starts to glow as the surface reaction begins with the flame continuing. Finally, after the fire has died down, one observes no flame at all but just the glowing embers due only to surface reaction. Stirring the coals or blowing on the fire causes the flame to reignite for a while until it returns to the pure surface reaction mode. Finally, the heat release is too small to sustain reaction or the wood turns completely to ashes.\n\nThe burning process as one can observe from a campfire or charcoal grill is a perfect example of the pyrolysis, combustion, and/or gasification. In order for the reactions to occur, high temperature is needed. Burning provides heat to raise the \"solid fuel\" temperature. While energy is needed to raise system temperature, pyrolysis and gasification processes are usually desired to keep more energy content in the final product (solid, liquid, or gases).\n\nWhile less common today, solid wood and/or coal fueled home heating prior to the 1960s. Today wood and coal are burned in electric power plants, where fast and efficient combustion is desired. Therefore, coal plants grind large coal chunks into fine powder and then blow it with air into burner jets, where it reacts with O 2 first by pyrolysis. Then the remaining coke burns, leaving behind an ash, which is a few percent of the weight of the original coal.\n\nMost of us have never seen the inside of a coal-fired boiler, but the sparks rising from a campfire are very similar to the second stage of a coal-burning process. When a campfire is stirred, small particles of charcoal are broken off the log, and buoyancy carries them upward. They glow brightly by the heat released by heterogeneous carbon oxidation for several seconds until the carbon is all consumed.\n\nIn these processes, the reactant O 2 flux is mass transfer limited around the reacting solid sphere, and the temperature of the particle is determined by heat transfer around the sphere, as shown in Fig. 18 .17.\n\nExample 18.1: Burning of Wood Most of us have poked a campfire or sat by a fireplace at night and watched the sparks fly up. They glow a bright red, which indicates that they are emitting blackbody radiation from a source with a surface temperature of 1000-1200\u00b0C. You have also noticed that their color does not change until they suddenly disappear. The time for this reaction varies, but they seem to glow for a few seconds and then suddenly disappear.\n\n1. Estimate the temperature of a campfire spark. 2. How long does it take to consume a \u03d50.2 mm \u00c2 1 mm pinewood fiber (particle)?\n\nLet us construct mass and energy balances on the particle, which we assume to be a cylinder of dry pinewood particle of radius R. The reaction is The degree of reduction for pinewood is given by\n\nwhere the area 2\u03c0RL can be omitted from each term, showing immediately that the temperature is independent of the particle size, as you knew already since there must be a range of particle size in the sparks, and all have the same temperature. If we ignore the radiation term rearranged to yield\n\nBefore we proceed, note that these equations look identical in form to the adiabatic CSTR equations of Chapter 15,\n\nTherefore, we immediately suspect that the carbon particle can exhibit multiple steady states, ignited and extinguished.\n\nReturning to Eqs. (E18.1.8) and (E18.1.9) describing the particle, we have\n\nwhere we have assumed that C O 2 \u226a C O 2 b , meaning that the oxidation of the carbon particle is mass transfer limited. Note that the reaction rate coefficient k R has disappeared from the equation, as expected if the reaction is very fast. Now we need k c and h, the mass and heat transfer coefficients around a cylinder. These come from Sherwood and Nusselt numbers, respectively, for flow around a cylinder, Since the fluid (air) is nearly stagnant, Sh % Nu % 3.66. Therefore, we have\n\nwhere D O 2 , is the diffusivity of O 2 in air at atmospheric pressure, D O 2 \u00bc 0.1 cm 2 /s, and k T is the thermal conductivity of air at atmospheric pressure, k T \u00bc 0.026 W/(m K). As the wood particles burn, and the surface carbonize and thus one can assume black body radiation, that is, \u03b5 % 1, and \u03c3 \u00bc 5.6703 \u00c2 10 \u00c08 Wm \u00c02 K \u00c04 . We can now solve our problem.\n\nIn Section 5.3, we learned that syngas can be employed to synthesize alkanes. Coal gasification and liquefaction were evaluated in the 20th century especially during the petroleum crises. Biomass gasification is gaining prominence in the 21st century. Gasification is a versatile technique for biomass conversion. Gasification of biomass is usually carried out between 700\u00b0C and 1200\u00b0C in a fraction of a second. Fig. 18 .18 shows schematics of typical gasification reactors. During the gasification process, the biomass undergoes drying/torrefaction and pyrolysis before gasification (oxidation of the carbonized materials). The principles of these processes have been discussed earlier in this section. The process can be semibatch as shown in (A) updraft and (B) downdraft reactors, or continuous as shown in (C) fluidized bed gasifiers.\n\nThe importance of gasification in a future economy lies in its potential to facilitate the use of biomass in the existing petroleum-based industry. Fig. 18.19 shows some of the commodity chemicals can be produced through gasification of woody biomass. Besides these catalytic routes, syngas has been subjected to bioconversion as well. Certain bacteria, or enzymes, can be applied to convert syngas to chemicals similar to sugars. Therefore, gasification has been a well-studied method in thermochemical conversions. However, as expected, the bioconversion efficiency is much lower for gaseous substrates than solid/liquid substrates. Table 18 .12 shows the typical compositions of gases in syngas as a function of the oxygen addition. In anaerobic conditions, the gasification process is endothermic. Large amounts of heat are needed to maintain the high temperature (700-1000\u00b0C) as well as to provide energy for breaking the polymer binds. The benefit of anaerobic gasification is the high heating (or energy) value of syngas. Table 18 .12 shows that the low heating value (LHV) of syngas produced with steam as heating medium is 12-14 MJ/Nm 3 , while it is only 4-6 MJ/Nm 3 for syngas produced by partial burning with air. The high energy content in the syngas is desirable. The energy requirement of gasification can be satisfied by adding oxygen in the feed. When oxygen is available, biomass will burn or partially burn to provide energy to the system. However, the burning of biomass will reduce the energy content in the final product gas stream. Therefore, oxygen content should be controlled at low level, just enough to provide heat to maintain the desired gasification temperature.\n\nIn combustion of solids such as charcoal, a reaction occurs between carbon and O 2 from the air in diffusion-limited reactions. In the year AD 142, a Chinese scientist named Boyang Wei wrote that when charcoal was combined with sulfur and potassium nitrate (obtained by crystallizing liquid animal wastes in a process too messy to describe), the mixture of solids when ignited had quite different characteristics. This mixture would fizz with a flash of light. Thus were born explosives, which Westerners were the first to turn into materials of warfare in the 15th century. As mentioned previously, the animal waste sources of fixed nitrogen were too limited for conducting a large-scale war, and chemical engineers developed the Haber process for making ammonia from N 2 and the Ostwald process to oxidize NH 3 into NO and thus to HNO 3 . The explosives business then evolved through nitroglycerine, nitrocellulose, and TNT to the modern plastic explosives and rocket fuels.\n\nA solid or liquid explosive is simply a chemical or a mixture of solids that contains fuel and oxygen in the condensed state so that no diffusion processes slow the rate. The reaction of TNT can be written approximately as CH 3 C 6 H 2 NO 2 \u00f0 \u00de 3 ! 6CO + C s \u00f0 \u00de + 5=2H 2 + 3=2N 2 , \u0394H R \u00bc \u00c01268 kJ=mol (18.42) which produces a lot of heat and gases. There is not enough oxygen in the molecule to convert all C to CO 2 or H to H 2 O, but the products quickly are heated to sufficient temperatures that they react instantly with O 2 at contact. If the solid is in an open container, the reaction just fizzes, but if it is confined long enough to build up pressure, it generates a pressure wave, which causes accelerated propagation of the combustion wave, which is heard as a bang. If the container is confined on all but one side (the nozzle), the reaction creates a rocket.\n\nThe art and engineering of propellant and explosive manufacture consists of finding suitable combinations and treatments of solids that will produce a stable compound that will not ignite until desired and will then burn with the appropriate rate to produce the desired blast wave or thrust. Obviously these are dangerous experiments, and they should be attempted after one figure out all the possibilities and what to do about them.\n\nSince an explosive solid contains fuel and oxidant in close proximity, the exothermic reaction can occur very quickly and without diffusion control, just as for separate fuel and oxidant systems. Premixed flames and explosions with gases involve the same basic idea with both fuel and oxidant mixed before reaction begins (and potentially disastrous consequences if they are ignited with inappropriate mixtures and confinement).\n\nAnother potentially explosive class of compounds is multiply bonded hydrocarbons. Early in the 20th century, chemical engineers learned by disastrous accidents that pure acetylene itself can detonate because the reaction\n\nis highly exothermic. Many acetylene tanks and pipes exploded before we learned to add stabilizers (chemicals such as acetone, which scavenge free radicals, which would otherwise promote chain-branching reactions). Even then, acetylene is sufficiently dangerous that it is seldom used in large quantities in the chemical industry. Acetylene is widely sold as the fuel for welding torches, and it is stored in large cylinders at high pressures in many welding shops. In fact, this acetylene is mixed with acetone, which has been found to be an effective scavenger of acetylene decomposition, so that these tanks are relatively safe. Table 18 .13 lists the formation heats of some potentially dangerous hydrocarbons.\n\nIn the previous section, we described one type of reaction that can cause an explosion, the situation where fuel and oxidant are mixed in solids or liquids that can release large amounts of energy very quickly. These processes can also occur in premixed gases.\n\nAn example of useful explosions in gases is the repeated explosions that occur in the automobile engine. However, most examples of explosions in gases are in fact disasters in which products burst walls of containers and cause havoc.\n\nAn explosion is as a fast, transient, exothermic reaction. It needs exothermicity to generate energy and must be fast to generate this energy very quickly in a transient pulse. We can distinguish between events in which the reaction propagates at subsonic velocity (an explosion) and one in which the reaction propagates with sonic or supersonic velocity (a detonation).\n\nIn practice, we call an explosion a reaction that makes noise. This can be a \"whoosh,\" a \"thump,\" or a \"bang\" in order of increasing rate of energy release and time of confinement. The bang is caused by a buildup of pressure that is released very quickly as the confinement system ruptures or the reactor ruptures. The parameter that distinguishes these characteristics is the flame velocity u F , which is the velocity with which the reaction front propagates down a tube or across a container. The velocity of sound in air at 300K is approximately 1100 f/s or 300 m/s. If the velocity of propagation is less than the velocity of sound, the wave is called a deflagration. If it is at or above the velocity of sound, it is called a detonation. Detonation can do much more damage because of the shock wave. We call a subsonic reaction wave a deflagration and a supersonic wave a detonation.\n\nIf CH 4 and air at the stoichiometric ratio (9.5% CH 4 in air) at atmospheric pressure are ignited at one end of a pipe, the pressure will ultimately rise by a factor of $10, and this pressure wave will travel at 300 m/s down the pipe. The heat of reaction is \u00c0803 kJ/mol of CH 4 , and all this heat will be released and the pressure will rise very quickly.\n\nExplosions can be even more violent in solids and liquids than in gases because the energy content per mole is comparable, but the density of solids and liquids is approximately 1000 times the density of gases at atmospheric pressure. Therefore, accumulation of dust in grain storage, grain processing facilities, and metal processing facilities can lead to spectacular explosions that are very dangerous.\n\nThese considerations underestimate the damage an explosion can cause as the flame speed becomes sonic and generates a shock wave. The pressure wave travels so fast that it carries considerable momentum, and this can burst walls even more effectively than a static The Texas City Disaster was perhaps the first modern chemical disaster, and it is still the US chemical accident with the most casualties. It occurred when a barge of ammonium nitrate (NH 4 NO 3 or AN) fertilizer was being unloaded in Galveston Bay near Texas City. A fire started in the crew quarters of the barge. The fire department was spraying water on the fire, and many people on the shore were watching the action. Suddenly the barge exploded, taking with it a sister barge, a sulfur plant on the shore, and two airplanes flying overhead. No one expected this disaster, and all procedures were being followed according to the standard safety practices of 1947. AN was a fertilizer, not an explosive! No one had \"done the experiment\" until the fire happened to get hot enough with a large enough quantity of AN to cause its detonation.\n\nBy current practice, large quantities of AN are never accumulated or exposed to heat or fires. However, fertilizer storage warehouses still explode occasionally; and AN has become a popular, inexpensive, and readily available material for terrorists, for example, in the World Trade Center bombing in New York City in 1992 and the Oklahoma City bombing of 1995.\n\nA second explosion occurred in a chemical plant in Texas City, Texas, some years laterthe Texas City Disaster II. This explosion occurred when a distillation column used to purify butadiene from other C4 hydrocarbons was operating improperly and the feed was shut off, as was the product stream from the reboiler. The column suddenly blew up, sending the column, like a rocket, a mile into the town. After some investigation, it was surmised that the reboiler accumulated a high concentration of vinyl acetylene, which is a strongly endothermic compound. The initial explosion was the reaction\n\nThe hydrogen pressure burst the reboiler and the contents of the column then ignited, turning the distillation column into a primitive but effective rocket that took off. Fortunately, no one was around at either the launch site or landing site. However, the loud explosion caused much anxiety as they had been highly sensitized from the previous one when the AN barges blew up a few years before.\n\nThe third Texas City disaster came with a refinery explosion on March 23, 2005, when a hydrocarbon vapor cloud exploded at the isomerization process unit at BP's Texas City refinery, killing 15 workers and injuring more than 170 others. The ISOM plant isomerization at the site was designed for the conversion of low octane hydrocarbons, through various chemical processes, into higher octane rating hydrocarbons that could then be blended into unleaded gasoline. The leakage of a large quantity of hydrocarbon into the air caused the explosion.\n\nSugars, too, can explode. The February 7, 2008, Georgia sugar refinery explosion was an industrial disaster that occurred in Port Wentworth, Georgia. Fourteen people were killed and 42 injured when a dust explosion occurred at a sugar refinery owned by Imperial Sugar.\n\nFlixborough, the Phillips polyethylene plant explosion, Norco Shell refinery explosion, and the Texas City refinery explosion were vapor cloud explosions (VCE) of hydrocarbons that escaped through leaks in chemical reactors. In Flixborough disaster near the village of Flixborough, North Lincolnshire, England, Nylon 6 was being made by oxidation of cyclohexane to produce caprolactam.\n\nIn the Phillips plant, low-density polyethylene was being produced in a process that uses isobutane solvent at very high pressures. These liquids escaped and vaporized without combustion because no ignition sources were nearby. After the hydrocarbon vapors had spread large distances and had become diluted with air (O 2 ), a cigarette or pilot light somewhere ignited the premixed alkane-air mixture creating a VCE, with disastrous consequences to the plant, to the neighborhood, and to people.\n\nBhopal, the site of the largest chemical accident in the past 50 years, was not an explosion but rather an uncontrolled reaction. The plant in Bhopal, India, owned jointly by Union Carbide and the Indian government, was producing methyl isocyanate as an intermediate for a pesticide. Water was admitted into a storage tank containing this chemical, which caused it to hydrolyze and produce CO, HCN, and unreacted MIC, which spread downwind into a crowded slum nearby and caused many deaths and casualties. The desired reaction to synthesize MIC was CH 3 HN 2 + OCl 2 ! CH 3 NCO + 2HCl (18.45) and the very undesired hydrolysis reactions were CH 3 NCO + H 2 O ! CO + HCN (18.46) all of which are highly toxic. The Bhopal chemical plant was used to produce agricultural pesticides and herbicides. These chemicals are important in agriculture to control insect and weed populations so that crop yields can be improved. One wants to produce pesticides and herbicides that are very selective in destroying a particular insect or plant but are not also toxic to other organisms. Here the objectives are to produce a chemical that is toxic to specific plants or animals but not to others. Some desirable characteristics of these chemicals are that they (1) attack only the target pests, (2) do not decompose during storage and shipment, and (3) decompose soon after application so that pesticide residues do not remain on food or contaminate groundwater. Considerable creative engineering goes into formulating and testing these agricultural products.\n\nAt Bhopal, they were manufacturing SEVIN, also called carbaryl, a broad-spectrum insecticide that was and still is used on many crops throughout the world. The reaction is normally carried out at 175\u00b0C and about 500 psi. The ambient temperature of the cooling water in the heat exchanger is 25\u00b0C. The reactor temperature could be changed by adjusting the coolant rate. At the plant setting, the reactor temperature could be maintained at 175\u00b0C at the maximum coolant rate if the ambient temperature of 25\u00b0C could be maintained throughout the heat exchange.\n\nOn the day of the accident, two changes in normal operation occurred:\n\n1. The reactor was charged with 9.044 kmol of ONCB (nearly three times the normal 3.17 kmol), 33.0 kmol of NH 3 (instead of 43 kmol in normal operations), and 103.7 kmol of H 2 O (about the same as the normal of 103.6 kmol). 2. The reaction is normally carried out isothermally at 175\u00b0C over a 24-h period.\n\nApproximately 45 min after the reaction was started, cooling to the reactor was turned off for 10 min. It was not unusual not to cool in that 10 min or so on period when the normal charge of 3.17 kmol of ONCB was used and no ill effects occurred.\n\nThe reactor had a safety relief valve with a disk rupture pressure of about 700 psi. Once the disk ruptures, the water would vaporize, and the reaction would be cooled (quenched) by the release of the latent heat of vaporization.\n\nPlot the temperature-time trajectory up to a period of 125 min after the reactants were mixed and brought up to 175\u00b0C. Show that the following three conditions had to have been present for the explosion to occur: (1). Increased ONCB charge; (2) reactor cooling stopped for 10 min; and (3) relief system failure.\n\nAdditional information: The reaction rate is \u00c0r ONCB \u00bc k C ONCB C NH 3 , with k \u00bc 0:00017 m 3 = kmol \u00c2 min \u00f0 \u00de at 188\u00b0C\n\nThe reactant volume for the charge of 9.044 kmol of ONCB is 3.265 m 3 ONCB/NH 3 + 1.854 m 3 H 2 O \u00bc 5.119 m 3 .

C + D (E18.2.1)\n\nA sketch of a batch reactor is shown in Fig. E18 .2.1. Mole balance of reaction mixture in the reactor as a whole leads to\n\nSubstituting the parameters, one obtains f A \u00bc 0.0336 at t \u00bc 45 min. At exactly 45 min, the heat of generation as defined by Eq.

One can conclude that the explosion would not have happened if the cooling were not turned off. Fig. E18 .2.2 shows the simulated temperature profile for the reactor operation. We can observe that the temperature continued to rise. More clearly, from Fig. E18.2. 3, by 110 min (or 10:45 pm), the reactor temperature had reached 515.49 K or 242.3\u00b0C. The temperature began increasing even more rapidly after this point. One can observe that 120 min after the batch reactor was started, the temperature increased sharply and the reactor exploded at a few minutes before midnight. If the mass and heat capacity of the stirrer and reaction vessel had been included, \u03a3n i C Pi term would have increased by about 5% and extended the time until the explosion occurred by 15 min or so, which would predict the actual time of the explosion at 12:18 am.\n\nWhen the temperature reached 300\u00b0C, a secondary reaction, the decomposition of nitroaniline to noncondensable gases, such CO, N 2 , and NO 2 , occurs releasing even more heat. The total energy released was estimated to be 6.8 \u00c2 10 9 J, which is enough energy to lift the entire 2500 Mg building 277 m straight up.\n\nThe pressure relief disk should have ruptured when the temperature reached 265\u00b0C or 538.15 K (ca. 700 psi), but it did not and temperature continued to rise. If it had ruptured, the liquid water would have vaporized, a maximum of 10 6 kcal would have been drawn from the reaction mixture, thereby lowering the temperature and quenching it.\n\nIf the disk had ruptured at 265\u00b0C (700 psi), the maximum mass flow rate out of the 2-in orifice to the atmosphere (1 atm) would have been 830 kg/min at the time of rupture. This leads to a maximum heat removal of \n\nChemical transformation and biotransformation are the discussions of this text. Transformation results in changes, and changes have irreversible consequences. Managing the changes can help us, but can also be harmful. Therefore, safety is of paramount concern when dealing with transformations. The first line of defense on any potential changes or transformations is containment. Large-scale quarantine (or containment) on biohazards has been practiced since ancient times. Various regulations by different governments today are based on containment when unknown organisms are to be introduced. For biosafety, stringent regulation and containment are needed. Bioprocess engineers usually deal with microorganisms in processes. The scales or space are usually \"small\" and containment is local.\n\nDifferent governments have different rules or regulations. WHO defines four risk groups of biosafety levels. Biosafety levels I and II are basic, meaning having minimum risk to the public and/or personnel handling it. Biosafety levels III and IV require strong containment in place. For bioprocess engineers to be proficient in biosafety practice, there are six key knowledge bases as defined by the American Biological Safety Association (ABSA). These areas of proficiency include: (1) disinfection, decontamination, sterilization; (2) work practices and procedures; (3) risk assessment and hazard identification-infectious and recombinant DNA; (4) regulatory aspects, standards, and guidelines; (5) equipment operation and certification; and (6) facility design.\n\nTo avoid inappropriate handling as well as emergency response to accidents, chemicals need to be properly labeled. Chemicals are labeled following standardized systems. However, different countries and/or agencies have different standards. For example, the Hazardous Materials Identification System (HMIS) is a numerical hazard rating that incorporates the use of labels with color developed by the American Coatings Association as a compliance aid for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Hazard Communication Standard. OSHA is an agency of the US Department of Labor. Similarly, the fire diamond, created by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), is also a numerical hazard rating. The hazards are generally divided into three main categories: health, flammability, and physical. The labeling is visual and easy to understand. In 1992, to avoid confusion and promote trade, the United Nations created a universal identification system, a GHS of classification and labeling of chemicals. The GHS label includes the substance name, ID, eye-catching pictograms to show potential dangers, plus warnings and descriptions on how to handle it. GHS hazard classification also includes three categories: physical, health, and environment. As compared with HMIS and NFPA labeling, GHS combined the flammability hazards into a physical hazard category while one additional category is added for environmental hazard.\n\nChemical reactivity hazard is defined as a situation where an uncontrolled chemical reaction could result directly or indirectly to seriously harm people, property, or equipment. One common reactivity hazard is fire and explosion, which usually involves strong exothermic reactions. To safeguard processes and facilities, one needs to first identify the threat, or screen for reactivity hazards. When the threats are identified, one can then determine specific remediation by adding barriers or changing the design.. Bioprocess engineers commonly use a design criterion of minimizing the cost or maximizing the profit. Putting up barriers to perceived threats or potential failures ultimately will increase the cost and footprint of the facility.\n\nChain reaction is one of the potential chemical reactivity hazards. It is a common type of chemical reaction, which chemical engineers need to be able to handle. They also need to be aware of how different a chain reaction can be from a standard reaction, A ! products, r \u00bc kC A , or its variants. Chain reactions are involved in autooxidation, combustion, and polymerization. A chain reaction process is composed of a sequence of reaction steps whose rates can vary by large factors. Some of these reaction steps slow the overall process, and some accelerate it. Some of these slow steps can have alternate paths.\n\nIn combustion processes, the reaction is also highly exothermic, and, combined with high effective activation energy of the combustion process, leads to large temperature dependence. The overall reaction products can also vary (partial oxidation versus total oxidation), and this factor must be considered when dealing with combustion processes.\n\nBecause of these factors, chain reactions are inherently unpredictable. Chemical and thermal autocatalysis make the overall rate not a simple function. Chain reactions can also be very fast so that the reaction may be limited by mass transfer processes.\n\nPartial oxidation reactions are important in the chemical industry. Pyrolysis and gasification, for example, are useful technologies in biomass conversion. We frequently do not have reliable reaction rate expressions for chain reactions, but we can compensate for this lack by designing and operating the reactor to manage the overall course of the reaction by properly dealing with mixing, mass transfer, promoters and inhibitors, and the presence of surfaces.\n\nAn explosion can be defined as a fast, transient, exothermic reaction. It needs exothermicity to generate energy and must be fast to generate this energy very quickly in a transient pulse. We can also distinguish between events in which the reaction propagates at subsonic velocity as an explosion and one in which the reaction propagates with sonic or supersonic velocity as a detonation. Unintended and accidental explosions can occur due to (1) the accumulation of reactive chemicals (gas, liquid, or solid) in confined space; (2) leakage of a significant amount of reactive chemicals (gas, liquid, or solid) to the atmosphere or environment; or (3) reactor runaway. As a bioprocess engineer, you will be responsible for creating safe processes and protecting the lives and health of your colleagues and community.\n\nreactor would explode at the actual time of 18 min after midnight? Find a set of parameter values that would cause the explosion to occur at exactly 12:18 am. For example, include heat capacities of a metal reactor and/or make a new estimate of UA H . Finally, what if a \u00bd-in rupture disk rated at 800 psi had been installed and did indeed rupture at 800 psi (270\u00b0C)? The explosion still would have occurred. (Note: The mass flow rate varies with the cross-sectional area of the disk. Consequently, for the conditions of the reaction, the maximum mass flow rate out of the \u00bd-in disk can be found by comparing it with the mass flow rate of 830 lb/min of the 2-in disk."}
