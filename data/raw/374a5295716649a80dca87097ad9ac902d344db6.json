This review is the first to describe variation in outcomes, outcome measurement instruments and outcome measurement time reporting in clinical trials for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n\n2. All the database of ICMJE-accepted clinical trial registry platform were searched, and randomized controlled trials and observational studies were considered.\n\n4. The aim of this review was to provide a list of outcomes for clinical trials of COVID-19, both interventions of Traditional Chinese Medicine and western medicine were considered. 5. When the searching was conducted, no clinical trials were registered by countries out of China, so all of included protocols were from China.\n\nshown in Figure 1 .

These outcomes are reported between 1 and 36 times, and the median outcome reporting time is 1. Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal outcomes included the largest number of outcomes, which includes 31 outcomes; chest imaging is reported more frequently than other outcomes. The number of outcomes in different outcome domains in protocols of western medicine clinical trials is shown in Figure 7 .\n\nThis review is the first to evaluate the outcome reporting of protocols of TCM and western medicine clinical trials for treating COVID-19. The results showed variations in the outcome reporting. For outcome measurement instruments/outcome definitions and outcome measurement time, there is also heterogeneity. However, many primary investigators did not provide outcome measurement instruments/outcome definitions or outcome measurement time. It is difficult to predict results of clinical trials now. But it is obvious that these problems may result in the exclusion of some studies from systematic reviews/meta-analyses due to the heterogeneity of outcomes or outcome measurements. It is a waste.\n\nIn this review, we find that there are more than 40 duplicated outcomes between protocols of TCM and western medicine clinical trials. No matter for clinical trials of TCM or western medicine, etiological test, chest imaging, respiratory symptoms, temperature, mortality/survival and adverse events are very important. These outcomes are relevant to the prognosis of disease and safety of therapy.\n\nBecause of no specific therapy can be used in the treatment of COVID-19, it is necessary and urgent to conduct clinical trials, no matter what the interventions are. We believe that it is important to develop a COS for clinical trials of TCM and western medicine for treating COVID-19, so that the efficacy of different interventions can be compared and merged in systematic review/meta-analysis.
