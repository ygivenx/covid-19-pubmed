{"title": "Journal Pre-proof Infection control in the medical imaging department during the COVID-19 pandemic", "body": "With the extensive application of chest CT examination in the diagnosis of COVID-19, measures to avoid the infection of radiographers during the examination are very important [4] .\n\nMany health workers were also infected during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak [5] .To reduce the risk of radiographers being infected during the examination, it is recommend that the medical imaging department pay attention to the following points ( Figure   1 ):\n\nFirst, an emergency prevention and control team for COVID-19 should be set up include the department director, radiologists, radiographers, nurses, and clerical staff. Based on the guidelines and on protection experience, this radiologist-nurse-radiographer interactive emergency management program (RNRIEMP) is designed to optimize the examination process for patients with fever.\n\nSecond, according to function, the radiology examination area should be divided into a clean area, a semi-polluted area, and a polluted area; isolated digital radiography (DR) and CT examination rooms and a dedicated fast track and elevator for patients with fever should be set up.\n\nThird, central air conditioning should be turned off immediately before the suspected patients arrive. A study found that the air flow in central air-conditioning systems could spread the virus (the space of the Diamond Princess cruise ship was relatively closed, its dependence on the central air-conditioning system was high, and the isolation effect was poor, leading to a large-scale COVID-19 infection) [6] .
