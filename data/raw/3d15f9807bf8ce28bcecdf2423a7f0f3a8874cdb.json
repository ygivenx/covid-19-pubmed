{"title": "Systematic review Assessing the potential of upper respiratory tract point-of-care testing: a systematic review of the prognostic significance of upper respiratory tract microbes", "body": "Point-of-care tests used by primary care clinicians to target antimicrobial prescribing could revolutionize the treatment of respiratory tract infections (RTI), improving patient outcomes and reducing drug side-effects and antimicrobial resistance. Primary care clinicians are responsible for the majority of human antibiotic use in the UK, USA and Europe. Paediatric RTI is the most common presentation managed by primary care physicians [1, 2] . Antibiotics are prescribed at up to 67% of RTI consultations [3] , yet there is strong evidence that a large proportion of these prescriptions are unnecessary [4, 5] . Antibiotic overprescribing has been partially attributed to uncertainty described by clinicians in identifying patients who may subsequently develop serious illness and require hospital intervention [6] . Policy makers, primary care clinicians and the research community are calling for evidence to help differentiate patients who would benefit from antimicrobials from those who would not [5, 7, 8] .\n\nThere is currently no way for a primary care clinician to distinguish viral from bacterial aetiology for respiratory infections in a timely manner. The burden placed on primary care means that evidence-based algorithms and tests are actively being sought; for example, an algorithm to identify children at risk of hospitalization has recently been developed in a large observational study [9] . However, this algorithm does not differentiate bacterial from viral infection. Additionally, C-reactive protein blood testing to target prescribing in adults and children is being investigated [10] but is not routinely used in the UK. A third possible strategy, and the subject of this review, is to rapidly test respiratory microbiological samples. Point-of-care test technology is rapidly developing: test devices are now able to detect common respiratory tract microbes in 20 min to 2 hr [11] , and could therefore be of value in primary care.\n\nUpper respiratory tract samples are acceptable to patients and are easily obtained in primary care [9] . Recent evidence suggests that specific microbes are weakly associated with clinical characteristics of children with RTI at presentation to primary care and may be aetiological [12] . However, the association between the detection of these microbes and (a) patient prognosis and (b) patient response to antimicrobial treatment is unknown. If detection of specific microbes from the upper respiratory tract was associated with response to antimicrobial treatment, tests for these microbes could be used to target antimicrobial prescribing.\n\nThe aim was to determine whether specific microbes detected from the upper respiratory tract are associated with the prognosis in patients of all ages presenting to all healthcare services with RTIs. Secondary questions were whether prognosis is affected by prescription of antimicrobials or the resistance status of the microbes detected.\n\nStudies eligible for inclusion were peer-reviewed, quantitative studies reporting microbiological and prognostic data from patients of all age groups presenting to a healthcare service or research team in an Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development member country, with diagnosis or symptoms of RTI. Studies recruiting from primary care, secondary care and community settings such as hospital outpatient or community research clinics were included. Studies were excluded where participants were recruited solely from intensive care or from a population with a high prevalence of pre-existing chronic disease or immune incompetence. Full inclusion and exclusion criteria are given in Table 1 .\n\nOur search strategy was designed to identify studies and systematic reviews that reported the relationships between microbes sampled from the upper respiratory tract in patients with respiratory tract infection, and prognostic outcomes. MEDLINE and Embase databases were searched using the OVID platform to 15 March 2018.\n\nThe MEDLINE search strategy is presented in Appendix I and used combinations of MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) terms and text words for clinical diagnoses of respiratory infection; 20 different microbes implicated in respiratory tract infection (identified by consultant microbiologists and used in previously published work) [13] ; and MeSH terms and text words for prognosis. The search excluded papers focusing on cystic fibrosis and tuberculosis. This search strategy was developed, extensively tested and refined using an iterative process with input from the University of Bristol subject librarian and search expert, and was subsequently adapted for use in Embase. The search was limited to humans, and no time restrictions were applied. Reference lists of all included full-text articles were also screened.\n\nTitles and abstracts of all identified studies were assessed for eligibility by one author (H.T.) and those which did not fulfil the inclusion/exclusion criteria were excluded. Full-text copies of included articles were independently reviewed. Dual screening was performed for 20% of all records by three authors (I.L., A.B. and C.H.) and eligibility disagreements resolved by discussion.\n\nData were extracted from full texts using a purpose-designed Access form. Descriptive variables were country of recruitment; study setting (e.g. primary/secondary care), study design, anatomical respiratory tract sampling location, laboratory methods, microbes identified, diagnoses of participants, number of participants, participant age inclusion criteria, type of prognostic outcomes reported, and whether results were stratified by antibiotic prescribing or consumption. Outcome data extracted were any measure of prognosis, including but not limited to symptom duration, hospitalization and length of hospital stay. The number of outcomes reported by studies for each microbe, and any association found between microbe and outcome, was recorded and reported in a 'vote count' table. Where the same outcome was reported for the same microbe by three or more studies, with means and standard deviations, random-effects meta-analysis was carried out using STATA (Stata Statistical Software, Release 13; StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA) using the 'metan' command. Quality assessment was conducted for all studies included in the review using the QUIPS tool [14] .\n\nOur search identified 5156 articles of which 754 were duplicates ( Fig. 1 ). Of the 4402 remaining, 3829 were excluded on the basis of title and a further 429 on the basis of abstract. Full texts of 144 articles were screened and 21 were eligible for inclusion in the review.\n\nCharacteristics of the 21 studies included in this review are summarized in Table 2 . The most common recruitment setting was Table 1 Inclusion and exclusion criteria Inclusion criteria 1. Peer-reviewed quantitative studies reporting individual-level microbiology from upper respiratory tract samples 2.

Studies of nosocomial infections 5. Full text not available in English 6. Recruitment in a non-OECD member [20] country hospital inpatients (13 studies; 62%), followed by hospital outpatient/community research clinics or primary care centres (five studies; 24%) and emergency departments (two studies; 10%). One study recruited in both primary care centres and an emergency department. The majority of studies (16; 76%) recruited only children, with eight recruiting children aged less than 2 years.\n\nMost studies used a prospective observational design (17, 81%). Several upper respiratory sampling methods were used: nasopharygeal wash/aspirate (13 studies, 62%); nasopharyngeal swabs (four studies, 19%); combinations of nasal, throat, nasopharyngeal swabs and aspirates (three studies, 14%); and a rhinopharyngeal swab (one study, 5%). Laboratory methods also varied between studies, with 11 (52%) using polymerase chain reaction techniques, three (14%) using immunofluorescence and the remainder using mixed/other methods.\n\nData were reported for 15 microbes/groups of microbes, including four bacteria, ten viruses and a combined Influenza A/B category. A full list of reported microbes is given later in Table 4 . The most data were reported for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (15 associations with prognosis investigated), rhinovirus (six) and influenza (six). The majority (13, 62%) reported data only for participants who were positive for the microbe(s) of interest; there is therefore a paucity of 'control' data from participants without detected microbes. None of the studies quantified microbial load, and no study reported outcomes stratified by antibiotic consumption or antimicrobial resistance.\n\nQuality assessment is summarized in Table 3 . No study had high risk of bias in the domain assessing attrition. The domain assessing confounding showed high risk of bias, commonly because studies measured limited numbers of microbes such that results could have been confounded by the presence of an untested microbe. High risk of bias was observed in three other domains for at least one study. Three studies had low risk of bias in all domains; ten had high risk of bias in at least one domain.\n\nPrognostic outcomes are listed in Table 4 , which shows a 'vote count' of associations examined between reported microbes and outcomes, and whether associations were reported by the primary study authors as statistically significant. In total, 26 differently measured outcomes were reported, the majority of which fell into three categories: (a) hospitalization duration (nine measures); (b) symptom duration (eight measures); and (c) healthcare use (six measures).\n\nThe most commonly reported outcome was duration of hospitalization, which was reported by at least one study for all microbes (Table 4 ). Symptom duration was reported using at least one measure for ten out of 15 microbes, and healthcare use was reported using at least one outcome for nine out of 15 microbes.\n\nThe 26 outcome and 15 microbe categories reported in Table 4 give a total of 390 possible associations. Of these, 99 (25%) were examined by one or more study, with a total of 134 associations reported by all studies. There were an additional five microbes for which we sought data, but identified no relevant studies. Statistical tests were used to assess relationships between microbe detection and outcomes for 107 out of 134 outcomes. These were reported by the study authors to be statistically significant (p < 0.05) in 38 out of 107 (36%). Twenty-seven associations were reported in which the authors did not use statistical tests, but reported raw data.\n\nOwing to the diversity of outcome measures reported, opportunities for meta-analyses were limited. We considered use of methods designed for synthesis of diversely reported outcomes including the albatross plot [15] , but were unable to proceed due to insufficient primary data.\n\nMeta-analysis was possible for duration of hospitalization. Means and standard deviations were provided by seven studies for RSV and three for adenovirus. Data were also available from three studies, pooling results for influenza A and B. A forest plot for these analyses is given in Fig. 2 . Significant heterogeneity was observed for all three pooled estimates and as such they should be interpreted with caution.\n\nOne additional study (Laundy et al. [16] ) provided mean duration of hospitalization for patients with RSV and influenza A, but could not be included in the meta-analysis as no standard deviation was reported. When compared with the results of the metaanalysis, the mean duration of hospitalization for RSV (2.2 days) and influenza A (6.0 days) do not fall within the confidence intervals for the pooled estimates. However, the Laundy study was small, with eight participants identified with influenza A and nine with RSV, which means the contribution of the study, if incorporated into meta-analysis, would be low.\n\nIt was not possible to examine whether antibiotic prescribing or antimicrobial resistance status influenced prognosis as the studies did not report results stratified by these factors.\n\nOur review highlights a paucity of evidence for the prognostic value of upper respiratory tract microbes: of the potential 390 possible associations only 27% have been investigated. That said, of those that have been tested, 36% were reported as significant.\n\nOur meta-analysis suggests hospitalization duration is longer for patients with respiratory syncytial virus than adenovirus and influenza, but we found significant heterogeneity between studies. This is likely to result from the differences in study recruitment setting, country, laboratory methods and participant diagnoses described in Table 2 .\n\nPrevious work has demonstrated that some specific bacteria and viruses are present more often in the throats of children with acute cough and RTI than in asymptomatic children [12, 13, 17] , providing some evidence that acute cough alters the flora of the upper respiratory tract and microbes detected there may be aetiological. However, we have also demonstrated here that there is an absence of evidence as to whether targeting antimicrobial treatment to the results of upper respiratory tract microbial testing would lead to improved outcomes.\n\nThis review was rigorously conducted and reported according to Cochrane and PRISMA guidelines [14, 18] Statistical analysis  and reporting   Lau 2006  2  1  1  2  3  2  Shaikh 2014  1  1  1  1  3  1  Laundy 2003  1  1  2  2  2  3  Lambert 2007  1  1  1  2  1  2  Mansbach 2008  1  1  1  1  3  2  Bennet 2007  1  1  2  1  2  2  Chan 2007  1  1  2  1  3  2  Garcia-Garcia 2017  1  1  1  1  2  1  Marguet 2009  1  1  1  1  1  1  Tsung 2010  2  1  1  1  2  2  Franz 2010  1  1  1 (3), moderate (2) or low (1).\n\nVote count of associations sought between clinical outcomes and microbes reported by studies was designed by subject experts and the quality of included studies assessed using the appropriate QUIPS tool [14] . We used a 'vote count' table as the most succinct way to present the overall results of the review, though this does mean that small studies lend as much visual weight to results as their larger counterparts [19] . It is possible that by restricting inclusion, we could have reduced the heterogeneity between studies. However, doing so would have limited our results to a focused population or outcome, limited opportunities for meta-analysis even further and reduced generalizability of any findings to the broader population.\n\nTwenty-six different prognostic measures were identified in the literature. At present, no core outcome set exists for RTI, which leads different studies to measure slightly different outcomes. We aimed to capture all relevant published data in this review, yet had studies (and hence this review) focused on an internationally agreed set of outcomes, it is likely that the percentage of potential associations investigated would have been higher. The large number of associations reported is both a finding in itself, and a limitation of this work.\n\nWe were unable to assess the impact of antimicrobial use or antimicrobial resistance on prognosis for patients with/without bacterial detection as studies did not report results stratified by antibiotic use or resistance status.\n\nOur results suggest significant potential for using upper respiratory tract microbes as the target of future POCT studies.\n\nThe currently un-investigated microbial-prognosis associations should be urgently subjected to rigorous research, which should include assessments of the impact of microbial load, antibiotic use, resistance status and the value of negative results. Despite a rigorous search, we identified few studies that reported prognostic data for bacterial identification, with the majority of data reporting viral infections. Future studies should also seek and report as large a range of microbes as possible, to minimize confounding by the presence of an untested microbe, and more studies are needed in the primary care setting.\n\nA quarter of potential prognostic associations have been investigated, and of these a third were significant, suggesting considerable potential for POCT. Future research should investigate the prognostic value of both positive and negative tests in both primary and secondary care, and look for interactions between test results, use of antimicrobials and microbial resistance.\n\nNo conflicts of interest declared.
