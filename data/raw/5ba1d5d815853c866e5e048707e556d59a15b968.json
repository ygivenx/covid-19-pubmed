{"title": "", "body": "T he 2009 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic highlighted the need for disease surveillance to monitor severe respiratory disease to support pandemic preparedness as well as seasonal influenza prevention and control. 1,2 Information generated from this type of surveillance enhances our understanding of how epidemiology and etiology differ between countries and regions of the world. The accumulated data collected in a standard and consistent way will allow rapid assessment for each influenza season and future pandemics within and among countries. 2 The 2009 pandemic and seasonal influenza epidemics demonstrated the importance of having an established real-time respiratory disease surveillance Implementing hospital-based surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections caused by infl uenza and other respiratory pathogens in New Zealand system in the southern hemisphere to inform the northern hemisphere countries about newly emerging pandemic or seasonal influenza. 3,4 A surveillance system can provide critical data on the epidemiology, burden, impact, circulating influenza, other respiratory pathogens and effectiveness of influenza prevention and control measures at a time when similar data in the northern hemisphere are not available.\n\nNew Zealand is an excellent location for populationbased research with its predominantly public funded health-care system. All New Zealanders are assigned a unique identifier allowing tracking of health-care utilization over time and linkage to multiple databases. Primary-care providers have highly computerized information systems Huang et al Hospital-based surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections, New Zealand SARI cases, including intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and in-hospital deaths;\n\n(2) understand influenza's contribution to those assessed patients not meeting the SARI case definition;\n\n(3) measure incidence, prevalence, demographics, clinical spectrum and outcomes for SARI and associated influenza cases;\n\n(4) identify etiologies of SARI cases attributable to influenza and other respiratory pathogens;\n\n(5) compare surveillance data with the data generated from New Zealand's hospital discharge coding system; and (6) describe any possible increased risk of influenzarelated hospitalization.\n\nAll residents from ADHB (central Auckland) and CMDHB (east and south Aukland) were under surveillance. Cases were reported from Auckland City Hospital and the associated Starship Children's Hospital and Middlemore Hospital and the associated Kidz First Children's Hospital. These four hospitals serve all residents of ADHB and CMDHB, have emergency departments and inpatient general and speciality medical services and provide all inpatient care for acute respiratory illness. The age, ethnicity and socioeconomic distribution of the urban population of 838 000 under surveillance were broadly similar to the New Zealand population ( Table 1) .\n\nCases included in the surveillance were overnight inpatients with suspected respiratory infections. An overnight admission is defined as: \"A patient who is admitted under a medical team, and to a hospital ward or assessment unit.\" 7 These cases were further identified as those meeting the SARI case definition and those not meeting the SARI case definition (non-SARI). All SARI cases and a subset of non-SARI cases were enrolled. and patient records with detailed demographic, risk factor and immunization information. The New Zealand population is extremely well characterized regarding demographic structure, particularly by ethnicity and socioeconomic status. Indigenous Maori and Pacific peoples (collectively about 20% of the population) are particularly vulnerable to influenza and other respiratory infection-related hospitalizations. A major component of the SHIVERS project is to conduct hospital-based surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI). This report describes the implementation of this hospital-based surveillance system and provides some preliminary results from the first influenza season of its operation.\n\nThe specific aims of the hospital-based surveillance are to: 7\n\n(1) establish active, prospective, continuous, population-based surveillance for hospitalized \u2022 onset within the past 10 * days, AND\n\n\u2022 requiring inpatient hospitalization.\n\n* Note: onset within the past seven days was used in the 2012 study protocol.\n\nThe discharge data for hospitalized patients in ADHB and CMDHB during the period 2006-2010 showed that the average annual number of overnight respiratory disease admissions (ICD-10 J00-99) was 9431 and influenza and pneumonia and acute lower respiratory tract infections (ICD-10 J09-22) was 5033 ( Table 2) . Thirty-six per cent of these admissions occurred for children under 15 years. Based on an average annual increase in respiratory disease admissions of 2.6% from 2006 to 2010, it was expected that the number of respiratory disease hospitalizations would increase by ~10% in 2012. Therefore, it was estimated that in 2012, 10 374 patients (ICD-10 J00-99) and 5537 patients (ICD-10 J09-22) would be admitted overnight with respiratory diseases.\n\nWhile it was difficult to accurately predict the expected number of annual SARI cases based on discharge data, an early study in the Starship Children's hospital indicated that approximately 50% of the preschoolaged children with a discharge diagnosis of pneumonia or bronchopneumonia met the WHO case definition for pneumonia. 8 The ADHB laboratory data during 2010-2011 showed that 15.2% (175/1145) of respiratory specimens were positive for influenza virus. 9\n\nAn average of 5500-10 000 annual cases of hospitalized respiratory diseases with 50% meeting the WHO SARI case definition would result in ~2800-5000 hospitalized SARI cases. Based on the ~10% positive detection rate, about 280-500 laboratory-confirmed influenza cases would be expected among these hospitalized SARI patients.\n\nCase ascertainment followed a surveillance algorithm. The presence of the components of the case definition was determined by reviewing clinicians' admission diagnoses and interviewing patients. Records of all acutely admitted patients were reviewed daily to identify The WHO SARI case definition was used for all age groups: 2\n\nAn acute respiratory illness with:\n\n\u2022 a history of fever or measured fever of 38 \u00b0C, AND\n\n\u2022 cough, AND \n\nSampling and testing for respiratory bacteria was based on the hospital clinical management and diagnostic protocols.\n\nUrinary antigen tests (a rapid immunochromatographic test) from Binax (Auckland, New Zealand) were used for all strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1.\n\nany overnight inpatient with a suspected respiratory infection. These patients were categorized into one of 10 admission diagnostic syndrome groups. Research nurses interviewed these patients, documented the components of the case definition that were present and differentiated patients into SARI and non-SARI cases.\n\nA case report form for each assessed patient captured patient demographics, presenting symptoms and illness, pre-hospital health care, medication usage, influenza vaccination history, co-morbidities, disease course and outcomes, epidemiological risk factors and laboratory results.\n\nClinical specimens were taken from all SARI and some non-SARI patients (for clinical management purposes) (Figure 1) . The preferred respiratory specimens for adult and paediatric patients were nasopharyngeal swabs and nasopharyngeal aspirates, respectively. Where possible, at least one lower respiratory tract sample (tracheal aspirate, bronchial wash or bronchoalveolar lavage) was collected from all ventilated patients.\n\nThe ADHB laboratory and ESR used US-CDC's real-time RT-PCR protocol for influenza virus. 10 CMDHB Table 2 \n\nThe total number of all hospital acute admissions and assessed and tested patients, including ICU admissions and deaths and census data, were collected. This allowed \n\nThe WHO SARI case definition, based on clinical symptoms and signs, will miss some illnesses caused by influenza infection and include some illnesses caused by non-influenza infections. 2, 17 The SHIVERS SARI surveillance system provides a comprehensive and thorough algorithm for case ascertainment and testing for all SARI and some non-SARI cases. It offers a unique opportunity to define cases of influenza not captured currently from patients who do not meet WHO SARI case definition, thus enabling further refinement of the WHO case definition. Additionally, the SHIVERS SARI surveillance system offers an opportunity to evaluate sensitivity and specificity of the WHO SARI case definition and predicting symptoms for capturing noninfluenza respiratory viruses.\n\nSARI surveillance is limited in identifying influenza virus-infected patients with atypical clinical presentations (respiratory and non-respiratory). Influenza infection can lead to more severe illness and complications such as primary viral pneumonia, secondary bacterial pneumonia, cardiac complications and neurological complications. Influenza infection can also cause exacerbations of underlying diseases such as chronic lung disease or cardiovascular disease. Some of the complications and exacerbations may occur after typical influenza-related clinical symptoms have resolved, and influenza infection may not be suspected as a cause in these complications.\n\nSARI surveillance can characterize sociodemographic risk factors (age, sex, ethnicity and socioeconomic deprivation) as the distribution of these characteristics is well defined in census data in New Zealand. For other more specific risk factors, there are limited data available on their distribution in the population. As SARI surveillance is a case-finding respiratory pathogen cases, and antigenic, genetic and antiviral characterization of influenza viruses.\n\nEthics approval was obtained from the Northern A Health and Disability Ethics Committee (NTX/11/11/102 AM02). Written consent is not necessary for non-sensitive data from routine in-hospital clinical management and diagnostic testing. Verbal explanation of the reason for additional information and its use was given to each patient, consistent with the New Zealand Code of Health and Disability Services Consumers' Rights (Right 6: Right to be fully informed). 15\n\nFrom 30 April to 30 September 2012 there were 59 124 acute admissions to ADHB and CMDHB hospitals. A total of 4417 (7.5%) patients with suspected respiratory infections were assessed. Of these, 2023 (45.8%) met the SARI case definition. Of the 1430 SARI cases from whom nasopharyngeal specimens were collected, 324 (22.7%) had influenza viruses. A small proportion of influenza-positive cases (7.1%, 21/294) were identified from patients with onset in the past seven to 10 days, so the case definition was expanded to onset within the past 10 days for subsequent study years (2013-2016). A small proportion (8.8%, 37/419) of influenza-positive cases was from non-SARI cases tested for clinical purposes.\n\nHospital-based SARI surveillance has been implemented and fully functioning in New Zealand since 30 April 2012. WHO is encouraging Member States to establish SARI surveillance that meets WHO global standards. 2 To our knowledge, New Zealand is among the first developed countries to do this, providing better understanding of the epidemiology, transmission and impact of influenza locally and globally.\n\nNew Zealand's existing hospital-based disease surveillance is well suited to strategic surveillance functions. 16 However, such systems are not suited to control-focused surveillance where it is necessary to identify and respond in a timely manner to individual surveillance for hospitalized inpatients, it is limited to quantify the impact of these specific risk factors for SARI-related influenza infections without their baseline distributions. Consequently, it is necessary to identify a suitable comparison/control population. During 2013, a hospital-based control population without respiratory illness will be added to investigate specific risk factors for influenza and other respiratory diseases.\n\nThe case report form captures information by interviewing patients/caregivers through their recall, which generates bias. An important example is influenza vaccination status, which is crucial for estimating vaccine effectiveness. The Ministry of Health in New Zealand plans to add influenza vaccination to its national immunization register in 2014, providing more accurate vaccination history for SARI cases than patient/caregiver recall.\n\nNone declared.\n\nThe SHIVERS project is funded by US CDC (1U01IP000480-01). The hospital-based surveillance is a key component of the SHIVERS project. The project is a five-year research cooperative agreement between ESR and US CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases Influenza Division."}
