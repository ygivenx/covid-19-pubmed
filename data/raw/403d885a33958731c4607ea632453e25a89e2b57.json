{"title": "Novel ionophores active against La Crosse virus identified through rapid 1 antiviral screening 2 3", "body": "daptomycin, among others. More closely related to LACV, a RVFV screen highlighted azauridine 86 and mitoxatrone 16 . The ability to rapidly screen molecules highlights an opportunity to identify both 87 unique virus-specific and broad-spectrum antivirals, as these reports have highlighted. 88 4 viral processes has several benefits, including potential for broad-spectrum activity and a 92 heightened requirement for antiviral resistance beyond minor mutations in the virus. Additionally, 93 numerous approved and available drugs are already available that can be repurposed as 94 antivirals 18, 19 . While significant work remains to be done to identify and verify such antivirals, 95 rapidly screening compounds can provide insight. 96 97 Using the NIH's Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP), we obtained and screened >500 98 compounds for activity against LACV. We identified several known antivirals, including 99 deoxyuridine and quinonone. Importantly, we also identified a variety of novel classes of antivirals, 100 including metal ion chelators. Valinomycin, a top hit in our screen, functions by transporting 101 potassium ions against the electrochemical gradient. We investigated the antiviral activity of 102 valinomycin, observing that valinomycin exhibits antiviral activity in several cellular systems, in a 103 dose-dependent manner and independent of treatment time. We also found that valinomycin does 104 not directly inactivate viral particles, highlighting a cellular role for potassium ions in virus infection. 105\n\nWe expanded our results to additional ionophores, observing that some but not all effectively 106 blocked LACV replication. Finally, we determined that valinomycin is broadly antiviral, as it 107 reduced replication of several viruses from diverse families, including flaviviruses and 108 enteroviruses. Together, these data highlight the utility in rapid screening of antiviral molecules 109 as well as a crucial role for potassium ions in LACV infection. 110\n\nDevelopment of rapid screening of NIH DTP compounds active against LACV. We 113 developed a simple, rapid assay to measure antiviral activity in Huh7 cells ( Figure 1A ). We plated 114\n\nHuh7 cells to confluency in 96-well plates, to which we added 2 \u00b5M drug from the NIH NCI Importantly, any cytotoxic molecule would not stain with crystal violet; thus, stained cells indicate 120 antiviral molecules that are not cytotoxic at 2 \u00b5M. Crystal violet stain was subsequently 121 resuspended in 10% acetic acid and absorbance read at 595 nm. To control for inter-plate 122 variability, each plate contained an untreated and infected (low survival), untreated and uninfected 123 (high survival), and ribavirin-treated (400 \u00b5M) control (high survival). Absorbances of drug-treated 124 and infected wells ( Figure 1B ) were compared to untreated and uninfected controls by dividing 125 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

This ratio highlighted several candidate antivirals, including 126 lagistase, lapachol, superacyl, and valinomycin. Interestingly, we identified several known 127 antivirals in our screen, including deoxyuridine and nelarabine (summarized in Table 1 ). Thus, 128 our assay identified molecules with novel activity against LACV, including some recognized 129 antivirals. 130 131 Valinomycin restricts LACV replication. We focused on valinomycin, as the molecule was a 132 prominent hit in our screen, had a known mechanism relevant to LACV infection, and was not 133 previously described to have antiviral activity against LACV. As an initial consideration of its 134 antiviral activity, we performed secondary screening on Huh7 cells. Cells were seeded to 135 confluency, treated with increasing doses of valinomycin, from 1 to 64 \u00b5M, and infected at MOI 136 0.1. At 48h, cells were fixed and stained with crystal violet, and stain was quantified by absorbance 137 reading. We observed that valinomycin exhibited antiviral activity at doses above 10 \u00b5M, as crystal 138 violet staining was stronger, suggesting more surviving cells (Figure 2A ). Doses as high as 64 \u00b5M 139 did not affect crystal violet stain, suggesting that cellular viability was not compromised. To 140 confirm this phenotype with titers, we treated cells with increasing doses of valinomycin 2h prior 141 to infection at MOI 0.1 and measured titers by plaque assay at 48 hpi. We observed that viral 142 titers were significantly decreased compared to untreated controls ( Figure 2B , dotted line) at 143 concentrations above 1 \u00b5M. In fact, viral titers were reduced over 100-fold at 10 \u00b5M. We calculated 144 an IC50 value of 1.4 \u00b5M. To confirm that cellular viability was not compromised, we used a 145 fluorescent assay to measure cellular ATP content after treatment with increasing doses of 146 valinomycin. We observed cellular toxicity at doses at and above 16 \u00b5M ( Figure 2C , CC50 value 147 of 14 \u00b5M), though no toxicity was observed either by cellular morphology or fluorescent ATP assay 148 below 10 \u00b5M. 149 150 As further confirmation of valinomycin's antiviral activity, we measured cell-associated viral 151 genomes. Huh7 cells were treated and infected as above and cell-associated RNA was collected 152 at 48 hpi. RNA was purified, reverse transcribed, and analyzed via qPCR for Small, Medium, and 153\n\nLarge genome segments, normalizing to cellular \u03b2-actin. Paralleling our titer data, valinomycin 154 treatment reduced viral genome content in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 2D ). Viral genome 155 content was reduced upwards of 100-fold with 10 \u00b5M valinomycin treatment. To extend these 156 results to other cell types, we treated and infected Vero-E6 cells as above and determined viral 157 titers by plaque assay at 48 hpi. Again, we observed a significant reduction in viral titer with an 158 in multiple cell types, reducing both viral titers and cell-associated viral genomes in a dose-160 dependent manner. 161 162 Valinomycin is antiviral over multiple rounds of infection. Our initial assays were performed 163 at low MOI and viral titer measured at 48 hpi. To determine if valinomycin was antiviral over 164 several rounds of replication, we treated Huh7 cells with 2 \u00b5M valinomycin two hours prior to 165 infection at MOI 0.1 and subsequently collected samples to titer every 8h for 56h total. We found 166 that LACV titers were significantly reduced at all times after 8 hpi ( Figure 3A ); in fact, virus failed 167 to replicate above input virus titers (0h). To confirm that valinomycin was reducing virus 168 replication, we measured viral RNA genomes. To this end, we treated cells with increasing doses 169 of valinomycin, infected with LACV and collected cell-associated RNA in Trizol at 24 hpi. After 170 purifying and reverse-transcribing, we performed qPCR using primers specific to the small, 171 medium, and large genome segments. We observed that treatment with valinomycin significantly 172 reduced the number of viral genomes by >90% with treatment and that no individual genome 173 segment was affected more than another ( Figure 3B ). Together, these data suggest that 174 valinomycin blocks virus replication and reduces viral RNA accumulation. 175 176 Valinomycin does not reduce viral particle infectivity. Because we observe significant 177 reductions in LACV titers with valinomycin treatment, we hypothesized that valinomycin might be 178 directly affecting cellular processes to reduce virus infection. Nonetheless, valinomycin is a cyclic 179 peptide and could potentially directly inactivate viral particles, as seen previously 20 . To test 180 whether valinomycin directly reduced virus infectivity, we directly incubated LACV with 2 \u00b5M 181 valinomycin for 24h and directly titered the surviving virus at regular intervals. We found that 182 valinomycin did not significantly alter viral titer over the time examined ( Figure 4A ), suggesting 183 that valinomycin is not directly inactivating viral particles. We further examined the capacity of 184 valinomycin to inactivate particles by incubating with increasing doses, up to 10 \u00b5M valinomycin, 185 for 24h prior to directly titering. As in our timecourse, we observed no significant change in viral 186 titers at any dose ( Figure 4B ), again suggesting that valinomycin does not directly inactivate LACV 187 particles. As final confirmation of this phenotype, we measured viral RNA in viruses exposed to 188 increasing doses of valinomycin. We then compared the relative number of genomes to the titer 189 to calculate the genome-to-PFU ratio. We observed that this number did not change with 190 valinomycin treatment, suggesting no change in specific infectivity ( Figure 4C ). In sum, these data 191 suggest that valinomycin does not affect virus infectivity by directly acting on the virion. 192 193 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

We thus hypothesized that valinomycin's antiviral 194 activity was due to its effect on the cell. The role of potassium in bunyavirus infection has been 195 well-documented, and bunyavirus entry is potassium dependent 21, 22 . To test if valinomycin was  196   affecting the cell rather than the virus, we treated Huh7 cells with 2 \u00b5M valinomycin and,  197 immediately before infection, we washed away the drug. As a control, we maintained valinomycin 198 on cells or replaced the valinomycin after washing away the initial treatment. We observed that 199 even after removing and washing valinomycin from the cells, the antiviral activity persisted, as 200 viral titers remained reduced to the same level as when valinomycin treatment is concurrent with 201 infection ( Figure 4D ). Together, these data suggest that valinomycin does not directly inactivate 202 viral particles but that treatment of cells reduces LACV infection, potentially by disrupting 203 potassium-dependent entry. 204\n\nIonophores are selectively antiviral. Given that valinomycin is a potassium ionophore, we 206 wished to investigate whether other ionophores, for potassium or otherwise, were antiviral. 207\n\nPotassium ions play a crucial role in cellular entry; however, a role for sodium or calcium ions is 208 not as well described. Marituba virus (MTBV) infection results in a sodium ion influx 23 , but the 209 origin or function of these ionic changes are not known. To determine if other ionophores might 210 exhibit antiviral activity, we treated cells with increasing doses of nonactin (potassium and sodium 211 ionophore), nigericin (hydrogen and potassium ionophore), calcium ionophore I, and sodium 212 ionophore III ( Figure 5A ). Two hours later, we infected with LACV at MOI 0.01 and measured viral 213 titers at 48 hpi. Both nonactin and nigericin exhibited significant antiviral activity, and viral titers 214 were not measurable above 4 and 1 \u00b5M, respectively ( Figure 5B ). Treatment with sodium 215 ionophore III resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in viral titers, and virus was not recovered 216 above 10 \u00b5M. Interestingly, treatment with calcium ionophore I showed no changes in viral titer, 217 even at the highest dose. Thus, we observe that LACV replication is disrupted by several 218 ionophores, especially potassium ionophores, highlighting the role for potassium in virus infection.
