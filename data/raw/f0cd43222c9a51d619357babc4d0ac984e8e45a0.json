TTX treatment had no effect on virus titer in the neurite 172 compartment at 17 or 24 hpi, and KCl treatment caused an ~1 log reduction in 173 neurite compartment titer at 17 hpi.\n\n175 Neuronal activity does not promote PRV spread from neuron to neuron.\n\n176 To determine whether neuronal activity affects spread of PRV from neuron to 177 neuron, we prepared tri-chamber cultures with SCG neurons as recipient cells.\n\n178 We first cultured SCG neurons in the left soma compartment of Campenot tri-179 chambers for 3 weeks, to allow axon extension into the right neurite 180 compartment. We then seeded additional freshly-prepared SCG neurons onto 181 the axons in the neurite compartment and maintained these cultures for an 182 additional 1 week ( Fig 3A) . The Banker laboratory previously described such 183 \"heterochronic cultures\" (i.e. co-culture of neurons of different ages) and\n\n184 observed synapses forming between hippocampal neurons within 1-3 days [24] . 188 To ensure that newly-added recipient SCG neurons cannot extend axons though 189 the chamber barriers into the left soma chamber within 1 week, we added the 190 lipophilic far-red fluorescent dye DiD to the left soma chamber (Fig 3B-C The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

Greater than 80% of neuronal cell bodies expressed ChR2-219 mCherry red fluorescence (Fig 4A-B) . Without blue light stimulus, neurons 220 exhibited an average spontaneous spiking frequency of 4 Hz. Neurons were then 221 exposed to blue light pulsed at approximately 12 Hz. With blue light stimulation, 222 neuron activity was synchronized to the pulsed blue light, with a measured 223 average spiking frequency of 11 Hz. Light stimulation also increased peak-to-224 peak spike amplitude from an average of 70 \uf06dV to 108 \uf06dV (Fig 4C-D) .\n\n225 To determine whether optogentically-controlled neuronal activity affects spread of 226 PRV, we prepared tri-chambers with SCG neurons in the left soma chamber, and 227 transduced with an AAV vector to express ChR2-mCherry. We screened neurons 228 by fluorescence microscopy to ensure ChR2-mCherry expression in >80% of 229 cells. At 4 weeks in vitro, we seeded PK15 recipient cells in the right neurite 230 compartment, infected with PRV Becker, and pulsed with blue light beginning at 231 1 hpi ( Fig 4E) . In the experimental condition, where neurons were transduced 232 with ChR2 and pulsed with blue light, neurite compartment titers were slightly 233 less than controls at 17 and 20 hpi, but not significantly different by 24 hpi 234 (p>0.05) (Fig 4F) .\n\n.

Finally, Rab3a, which 306 mediates the trafficking and Ca 2+ -regulated exocytosis of synaptic vesicles in 307 neurons, also does not appear to be associated with virus particle exocytosis (Fig   308 5I) . Altogether, these results are consistent with PRV particles using the 309 constitutive secretory pathway, not Ca 2+ -regulated synaptic vesicle-like secretory 310 mechanisms, even in neurons.
