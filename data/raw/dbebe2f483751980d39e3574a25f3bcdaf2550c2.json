{"title": "Identification of an HLA-DPB1*0501 Restricted Melan-A/MART-1 Epitope Recognized by CD4 + T Lymphocytes: Prevalence for Immunotherapy in Asian Populations", "body": "In 2008, Hunder et al 14 demonstrated the development of an in vitro method for isolating and expanding autologous CD4 + T-cell clones with specificity for the melanoma-associated antigen NY-ESO-1. They infused these cells into a patient with refractory metastatic melanoma who had not undergone any previous conditioning or cytokine treatment. The infusion of the autologous CD4 + T-cell clones caused complete tumor regression of a patient with refractory metastatic melanoma. The adoptively transferred NY-ESO-1-specific CD4 + T-cell clones were detectable for several months in vivo, and mediated a long-term complete clinical remission. Importantly, the infused clonal population of CD4 + T cells could induce T-cell responses to other tumor-associated antigens of his tumor. These observations supported that CD4 + T lymphocytes are also essential for the persistence of a long-lasting antitumor responses and generation of effective, nontoxic immune therapies for cancer.\n\nRecently, a study transferred small numbers of naive tyrosinase-related protein-1-specific CD4 + T cells into lymphopenic recipient mice bearing large established melanoma. Therapy was independent of vaccination, exogenous cytokine support, CD8 + , B, natural killer, and natural killer T cells. Transferred CD4 + T cells expanded and differentiated into cytotoxic CD4 + T cells that could eliminate melanoma cells directly. This study confirmed that tumorspecific CD4 + T cells could cause tumor regression in adoptive immunotherapy against melanoma. 15 Melan-A/MART-1 is a transmembrane protein with 118 amino acids, and is expressed specifically on normal melanocytes and tumor cells of 75% to 100% of melanoma patients. 16 The Melan-A/MART-1 gene product was identified as a tumor-associated antigen by 2 different groups in 1994, simultaneously. Coulie et al 17 identified Melan-A as a melanoma antigen recognized by autologous cytotoxic T-cell clones from peripheral blood lymphocytes, showing a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2 restriction. Kawakami et al 18 analyzed the target antigen of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes of HLA-A2 + melanoma patients by cDNA expression cloning, and cloned the same gene, designated MART-1. All of the tumor-reactive CTLs from both groups were observed to recognize the region encompassing residues 26 to 35 of Melan-A/MART-1 in association with HLA-A2. 1 . In 1995, Castelli et al 19 identified a naturally processed Melan-A/MART-1 peptide containing residues 32 to 40 and binding to HLA-A2.1 with tandem mass spectrometry. Subsequently, epitopes restricted by other HLA class I molecules including HLA-B45, 20 HLA-B35, 21 and HLA-Cw7 22 were described.\n\nAccording to the cancer immunity peptide database (http://www.cancerimmunity.org/ peptidedatabase/Tcellepitopes.htm), there are 7 known MHC class II restricted epitopes of Melan-A/MART-1, in association with HLA-DR1, 23, 24 HLA-DR3, 23 HLA-DR4, 25 HLA-DR11, 26 HLA-DR52, 26 and HLA-DQ6. 23 To identify novel MHC class II-restricted epitopes of Melan-A/MART-1 and exploring epitopes more suitable for cancer immunotherapy for Asian population, in this study, we used a pool of synthetic peptides spanning the entire Melan-A/MART-1 protein sequence to stimulate enriched CD4 + T-cell populations from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of healthy donors (HDs). Here, we reported the successful isolation, expansion, and characterization of CD4 + T-cell clones, which specifically recognized Melan-A/MART-121-50 peptide. We further demonstrated that these CD4 + T-cell clones recognized this epitope in 12 of 20 PBMCs of HDs in a HLA-DPB1*0501 restricted manner. Finally, we demonstrated that this epitope is naturally processed and presented by DCs pulsed with Melan-A/ MART-1 protein or lysates of melanoma cell lines. HLA-DPB1* 0501 is frequently expressed in Asian population (44.9% to 73.1%). 27 Therefore, this epitope could provide a new tool and could significantly increase the percentage of melanoma patients that can benefit from cancer immunotherapy.\n\nPeripheral blood was obtained from HDs (PLA 307 hospital, Beijing, China) after obtaining informed consent. Melanoma cell lines, A375, A875, and SK-MEL-1, were purchased from basic medical cell center of China Union Medical University, and were maintained in RPMI 1640 (GIBCO Invitrogen Corp., Rockville, MD) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (GIBCO Invitrogen Corp.). Culture medium for lymphocytes was MXFT Medium (IMMUNOTECH UK LTD.) supplemented with recombinant human (rh) IL-2 (Satellite Biological Products Research Institute, Liaoning, China) and, where indicated, rhIL-7 (Peprotech Inc., Rocky Hill, NJ). Every 18 to 20 days, cells were restimulated with allogeneic irradiated PBMCs, 1 \u03bcg/mL phytohemagglutinin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and 100 IU/mL rh interleukin (IL)-2.\n\nPeptides were synthesized by Jill biochemical Co., LTD. (Shanghai, China) by standard solid-phase chemistry on a multiple peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems) using F-moc for transient NH 2 -terminal protection and were analyzed by mass spectrometry. All peptides were >90% pure as indicated by analytic high performance liquid chromatography. Lyophilized peptides were diluted in phosphate buffer saline-10% dimethyl sulfoxide or 100% dimethyl sulfoxide at 2mM and stored at \u221220\u00b0C.\n\nIn vitro stimulation of Melan-A/MART-1-specific T cells was conducted as described previously. 28 In brief, 1\u00d710 7 to 2\u00d710 7 CD4 + T cells, highly enriched (>95%) from PBMCs using anti-CD4 microbeads and a Mini-MACS device (Miltenyi Biotec Inc.), were stimulated with irradiated (25 Gy) or mitomycin C (25 \u03bcg/mL)-treated autologous CD4 \u2212 cells in the presence of a mixture containing 28 to 30 amino acid long and partially overlapping peptides (2 \u03bcM each, Jill biochemical Co., LTD, Shanghai, China) spanning the entire Melan-A/ MART-1 protein sequence in MXFT Medium containing rhIL-2 (20 IU/mL) and rhIL-7 (10 ng/mL). After 1 or 2 weeks of in vitro stimulation, cultures were tested for the presence of specific CD4 + T cells using the same pool of peptides (2 \u03bcM each) in an intracellular interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 secretion assay as follows. T cells were stimulated for 4 hours at 37\u00b0C in the absence or in the presence of the peptide pool and GolgiStop protein transport inhibitor (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) according to the manufacturers' protocol. After incubation and washing, cells were then stained with anti-CD4 mAb (BD Biosciences) for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0C, fixed and permeabilized with fixation/permeabilization solution (BD Biosciences), stained with anti-IFN-\u03b3 mAb (BD Biosciences). Samples were analyzed by flow cytometry on FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Data analysis was performed using FACSDako software. CD4 + T cells producing IFN-\u03b3 in response to peptide pool stimulation were isolated by cytokine secretion-guided magnetic cell sorting using a cytokine secretion detection kit (Miltenyi Biotec Inc.) and cloned by limiting-dilution culture in the presence of phytohemagglutinin (Sigma-Aldrich), allogeneic irradiated PBMCs, and rhIL-2 (100 IU/mL) as described. 28 Clones were subsequently expanded by periodic stimulation (every 3 to 4 wk) under the same conditions.\n\nTo assess the fine specificity of antigen recognition, growing CD4 + T-cell clones (10,000/ well) were incubated in the absence or presence of each Melan-A/MART-1 peptides (2 \u03bcM) in 200 \u03bcL/well of MXFT Medium in 96-well round-bottom plates. Where indicated, antibodies to HLA-DR (clone L243, BD Biosciences), HLA-DP (clone B7/21, abcam, Cambridge, MA), or HLA-DQ (clone SPVL-3, abcam) were used to specifically block MHC class II recognition by specific CD4 + T-cell clones. For recognition of none-related HDs as antigen presenting cells (APCs), equal numbers of cells were preincubated or not with indicated peptide (2 \u03bcM) for 1 hour, extensively washed, and then added to T cells. To assess recognition of the native antigen, DCs were incubated with protein (10 \u03bcg/ mL) or tumor lysates for 16 hours, intensively washed and used as APCs. After 24 hours of incubation at 37\u00b0C, culture supernatants were collected, and the concentration of IFN-\u03b3 released in response to antigen stimulation was assessed by ELISA (dakewe biotech Co., LTD, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, China) following the manufacturer's instructions.\n\nMonocyte-derived DCs were generated by isolating CD14 + monocytes from PBMCs by magnetic cell sorting using a miniMACS device (Miltenyi Biotec). Highly enriched CD14 + cells (>95%) were cultured in Iscove Modified Dulbecco Medium (IMDM) (GIBCO Invitrogen Corp.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 1000 IU/mL rh granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (Beijing medical university united pharmaceutical Co., LTD, Beijing, China) and 1000 IU/mL rhIL-4 (Peprotech Inc.) for 6 days.\n\nMelan-A/MART-1 proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli as full-length proteins with a 6-histidine tag at the amino terminus as described previously. 29 The proteins were purified from washed and solubilized inclusion bodies by nickel chelating affinity chromatography using a pH gradient. Proteins were eluted in 8M urea, 100mM phosphate, and 10mM Tris at pH 4.5, followed by step gradient dialysis to 2mM urea in phosphate buffer saline. The purified proteins were reactive with anti-Melan-A/ MART-1 mAbs A103 by western blot analysis; purity was >80% by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.\n\nTumor cells (2\u00d710 5 ) were lysed in 200 \u03bcl of Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 medium by 10 cycles of rapid freezing and thawing. For antigen loading using peptides, DCs were activated at day 6 with tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (1000 IU/mL). After 24 hours (day 7), mature DCs were pulsed with indicated peptide (2 \u03bcM) for 2 to 4 hours. For antigen loading using proteins (10 \u03bcg/mL) or tumor lysates (at the equivalent of 3 tumor cells/DC), which required antigen processing, DCs were loaded with antigen at day 5. After overnight incubation, DCs were activated at day 6 with tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (1000 IU/mL) for 24 hours. Mature DCs were washed twice in complete media before their use in stimulation or antigen recognition assay.\n\nTo assess the Melan-A/MART-1 expression of tumor cell lines, indirect immunofluorescence labeling was performed. Tumor cell lines were cultured to logarithmic growth phase, then dissociated to single cells by 0.25% trypsin digestion, fixed and permeabilized with fixation/ permeabilization solution (BD Biosciences) for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0C, and rinsed with perm/wash buffer (BD Biosciences). Mouse anti-Melan-A/MART-1 mAb (40 to 2300, Zymed Laboratories, Inc., South San Francisco, CA) was used as the primary antibody, and diluted at a concentration of 1 \u03bcg/mL. Normal mouse IgG 1 was used for the isotype control. The duration of the primary mAb staining was 1 hour, followed by the secondary antibody, 1:1000-diluted goat antimouse IgG 1 -FITC (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA) staining for 45 minutes both at room temperature. Samples were washed 3 times with perm/wash buffer for 5 minutes each, and were analyzed by flow cytometry on FACSCalibur. Surface expression of HLA-DP was determined by staining using specific mAb (clone B7/21, Abcam) and flow cytometry analysis.\n\nTo assess the response of Melan-A/MART-1-specific CD4 + T cells in healthy individuals, we isolated CD4 + T cells from PBMCs of 8 HDs using magnetic cell sorting and stimulated in vitro with a pool of 10 peptides spanning the entire Melan-A/MART-1 protein sequence. These peptides were 28 to 30 amino acid long and partially overlapped by 20 amino acids (Fig. 1A) . Autologous irradiated CD4 \u2212 cells were added as APCs. After 1 or 2 rounds of stimulation, the presence of Melan-A/MART-1-specific CD4 + T cells was assessed by intracellular staining with IFN-\u03b3 and CD4-specific mAbs after stimulation in the presence or in the absence of the Melan-A/MART-1 peptide pool. Data obtained after this analysis for the responding donors are shown in Figure 1B and data obtained for all donors are summarized in Figure 1C . IFN\u03b3 + and CD4 + T cells were detected in 4 of the 8 HDs. After the first cycle of in vitro stimulation, specific responses to the Melan-A/MART-1 peptide pool were detected for 2 (HD 005 and HD 106) of 8 health donors. After the second cycle of in vitro stimulation, specific responses could be detected for 2 more HDs (HD 006 and HD 108). For these 4 responding HDs, the frequency of IFN-\u03b3 producing CD4 + T cells was 2.5 approximately 7-fold (average 4.6\u00b11.9) higher than the control group (without the Melan-A/ MART-1 peptide pool). The IFN-\u03b3-secreting CD4 + T cells in response to stimulation with Melan-A/ MART-1 peptide pool were isolated by cytokine secretion-guided magnetic cell sorting. The purified fraction was either stimulated as a polyclonal population or was further cloned under limiting dilution conditions by stimulating with phytohemagglutinin in the presence of rhIL-2 (100 IU/ mL) and irradiated feeder cells. Five clones, derived from HD 106, were obtained. They specifically recognized the Melan-A/MART-1 peptide pool. Clone 5 and 7 had enough cell number and were selected for further study.\n\nTo determine whether the CD4 + T-cell clones recognize a single peptide, individual peptide was directly pulsed to the 5 CD4 T-cell clones at 2 \u03bcM concentration. Twenty-four hours after pulsing, the recognition was measured by IFN-\u03b3 production by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). As shown in Figure 2A , 5 clones from HD 106 specifically recognized Melan-A/MART-1 21-50 , whereas no significant activity was detected in response to the partially overlapping peptides in the neighboring regions. Peptide titration curves for the active peptide of clone 5 are shown in Figure 2B . Data were shown as mean of triplicate values. Each graph is representative of at least 3 independent experiments giving comparable results. This study demonstrated that Melan-A/MART-1 21-50 contains the active epitope that could be recognized by CD4 + T-cell clone 5.\n\nThe CD4 + T-cell clone 7 yielded similar results (data not shown).\n\nMelan-A/MART-1 21-50 contains 2 already known HLA class II epitopes, Melan-A/ MART-1 [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] and Melan-A/MART-1 [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] . To determine whether any of the 2 epitopes could be recognized by the CD4 + T-cell clones, these 2 epitopes were synthesized and pulsed to the CD4 + T-cell clone 5 at 2 \u03bcM concentration. Twenty-four hours after pulsing, the recognition was measured by IFN-\u03b3 production by ELISA. As shown in Figure 3 , clone 5 did not recognize Melan-A/MART-1 [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] and Melan-A/ MART-1 [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] as no significant activity was detected. This study demonstrated that Melan-A/MART-1 21-50 contains an active epitope that had not been reported previously. The CD4 + T-cell clone 7 yielded similar results (data not shown).\n\nTo identify the MHC class II restricting element(s) of Melan-A/MART-1 21-50 -specific CD4 + T-cell clone from HD 106, the recognition of peptide Melan-A/MART-1 21-50 was carried out in the presence of either anti-HLA-DR-specific, anti-HLA-DP-specific, or anti-HLA-DQ-specific antibodies. A significant reduction of IFN-\u03b3 production was seen with anti-HLA-DP antibody. In contrast, no significant inhibition was observed in the presence of antibodies against anti-HLA-DR antibody. Anti-HLA-DQ antibody and anti-HLA-A, B, C antibody demonstrated little inhibition that was within experimental variations (Fig. 4A) . Thus, the Melan-A/MART-1 21-50 -specific CD4 + T-cell clone from HD 106 recognized the peptide in an HLA-DP-restricted manner.\n\nEach healthy individual contains 2 HLA-DP alleles, and there are more than a dozen HLA-DP alleles reported. We first determined the HLA-DP alleles of HD 106. As assessed by molecular typing, HD 106 was an HLA-DPB1* 0501 homozygote. This suggests that DPB1*0501 is the presenting molecule of HD 106.\n\nTo further investigate the association of DPB1*0501 with clone 5 peptide recognition, PBMCs from 20 HDs were randomly selected and tested. Twelve of 20 PBMCs analyzed were able to present Melan-A/MART-1 21-50 to clone 5 as measured by ELISA (Fig. 4B, C) . The 20 HDs were molecularly typed for their HLA-DP alleles. As illustrated in Figures 4B and C, the 12 HDs, which had the ability to present Melan-A/MART-1 21-50 to specific CD4 + T-cell clone 5, all expressed the DPB1*0501 allele, whereas the remaining 8 health donors did not. It suggested a frequency of the presenting allele in the test population (Chinese) was approximately 60%, which was consistent with the prevalence of DPB1*0501 in Chinese populations.\n\nIn conclusion, these results showed that Melan-A/ MART-1 21-50 -specific CD4 + T-cell response detected in HD 106 was restricted to HLA-DPB1*0501, which is expressed by 44.9% to 73.1% of the Asian population. 27\n\nWe then assessed the ability of Melan-A/MART-1 21-50 -specific HLA-DPB1*0501restricted CD4 + T-cell clone to recognize the naturally presented antigen on the surface of professional APCs. As illustrated in Figure 5A , >99% of A375, A875, and SK-MEL-1 cell lines expressed Melan-A/ MART-1 protein as detected by flowcytometry. The processing and presentation of Melan-A/MART-1 antigen by DCs after incubation with lysates from tumor cell lines A375, A875, SK-MEL-1 (Melan-A/MART-1-expressing), or A549 (Melan-A/MART-1-negative) was assessed by ELISA measurement of IFN-\u03b3 secretion in the culture supernatant (DCs:T cells=1:10). As shown in Figure 5B , Melan-A/ MART-1specific CD4 + T cells efficiently recognized the Melan-A/MART-1 native antigen that is present in the tumor lysates from 3 tumor cell lines upon processing and presentation by professional APCs. This result suggests that clone 5 recognized an epitope that was present in Melan-A/ MART-1 positive tumor cells and was naturally processed. To further investigate the specificity of clone 5, soluble recombinant Melan-A/MART-1 protein at the indicated dose was pulsed to monocyte-derived DCs (DCs:T cells= 1:10). Recognition was assessed after 24 hours of incubation by ELISA measurement of IFN-\u03b3 secretion in the culture supernatant. Autologous DCs were able to more efficiently process the recombinant Melan-A/MART-1 protein produced in Escherichia coli and present the relevant epitope to theMelan-A/MART-1-specific CD4 + T-cell clone, in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5C) , whereas no significant recognition was obtained using NY-ESO-1 protein used as an internal control, or using paraformaldehyde-fixed DCs pulsed with the Melan-A/MART-1 protein. Specific antigen presentation was also obtained at the different DCs:T cells ratio (Fig. 5D) . These results show that the T-cell epitope recognized by Melan-A/MART-1specific CD4 + T cells from HD 106 is efficiently processed and presented by professional APCs. Recognition of tumor cell lines endogenously express Melan-A/MART-1 antigen by HLA-DPB1*0501-restricted CD4 + T cells could not be assessed because of unavailability of appropriate tumor cell lines that could both express Melan-A/MART-1 and matched HLA-DP molecule.\n\nIn this study, we used a peptide pool of 28 to 30 amino acid long peptides spanning the entire Melan-A/MART-1 protein sequence and overlapping by 20 amino acids to stimulate enriched CD4 + T cells from a group of 8 HDs with autologous irradiated CD4 \u2212 cells. After 1 or 2 rounds of stimulation, the same pool of peptides was used for screening the cultures for the presence of Melan-A/MART-1-specific CD4 + T cells by intracellular staining with IFN\u03b3 and CD4-specific mAbs. We could detect IFN-\u03b3 + and CD4 + T cells in 4 of the 8 HDs, thus indicating that about half of HDs mount such T-cell responses.\n\nCD4 + T cells producing IFN-\u03b3 in response to peptide pool stimulation were isolated using a cytokine secretion-based magnetic cell sorting and were cloned under limiting-dilution conditions by mitogen. From the growing CD4 + T-cell clones, we identified a new Melan-A/ MART-1-derived immunodominant epitope recognized in the context of HLA-DPB1*0501 molecules by a CD4 + T-cell clone. Until recently, HLA-DP-restricted epitope has been poorly characterized. The HLA-DPB1*0501 allele is the most frequent (44.9% to 73.1%) allele at the DPB1 locus found in the Asian population. 27 As consistent with the prevalence of DPB1*0501 in Chinese populations, PBMCs from 12 of 20 HLA-unselected HDs were able to present the Melan-A/ MART-1 epitope to specific clonal CD4 + T cells. The later molecular typing results showed that the 12 HDs, which had the ability to present Melan-A/ MART-1 21-50 to specific CD4 + T-cell clone, all expressed the DPB1*0501 allele, whereas the remaining 8 HDs did not. In contrast with the high expressing frequency in the Chinese population, HLA-DPB1* 0501 allele is rare in whites (2.6% to 5.3%). 27 This big difference in the allele frequency among different ethnic groups may contribute to explain why HLA-DPB1*0501 restricted epitopes have been reported less frequently in whites than in Asians. As approximately 44.9% to 73.1% of individuals express HLA-DPB1*0501, 27 the identification of this epitope significantly increase the percentage of melanoma patients that can benefit from anticancer immunotherapy.\n\nThe peptide recognized by the HLA-DPB1*0501 restricted CD4 + clone is Melan-A/ MART-1 , encompassing the sequence of the previously defined HLA-A2-restricted (Melan-A/MART-1 26-35 18 Melan In conclusion, the identification of new epitopes in this study may significantly expand the spectrum of frequently expressed Melan-A/MART-1-derived sequences recognized by specific CD4 + T cells and will be highly instrumental for the evaluation of Melan-A/ MART-1-specific CD4 + T-cell responses in cancer patients. Recognition of 2 already known HLA class II epitopes by Melan-A/MART-1 specific CD4 + T-cell clone. Peptide recognition by Melan-A/MART-1 specific CD4 + T-cell clone 5 from healthy donor 106 was assessed by stimulating culture aliquots with synthetic peptides (2 \u03bcM). IFN-\u03b3 secretion in the culture supernatant was measured by ELISA 24 hours after stimulation. Data were shown as mean of triplicate values. Each graph is representative of at least 3 independent experiments giving comparable results. ELISA indicates enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; IFN, interferon; HLA, human leukocyte antigen. "}
