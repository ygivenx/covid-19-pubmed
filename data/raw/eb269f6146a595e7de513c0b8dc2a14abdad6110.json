{"title": "Aetiology of childhood pneumonia in a well vaccinated South African birth cohort: a nested case-control study of the Drakenstein Child Health Study", "body": "The incidence of childhood pneumonia has declined in the past decade, contributing to a substantial reduction in childhood mortality. 1 However, pneumonia remains the major cause of death in children outside the neonatal period, accounting for about 17% or 1 million deaths annually, with the burden heavily skewed to low-income and middle-income countries. 1 Reductions in pneumoniaassociated mortality have been achieved through improved strategies to prevent and treat childhood pneumonia. 2 New vaccines, particularly pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) and Haemophilus infl uenzae type b vaccine, have been a major advance in reduction of incidence and severity of childhood pneumonia. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] After PCV introduction in national immunisation programmes, reductions in the incidence and severity of childhood pneumonia have been reported in highincome countries 4, 6 and in Latin America. 5 However, the eff ect of these programmes on childhood pneumonia and child health in Africa, where a large burden of pneumonia exists, is not well studied outside of vaccine trials. Identifi cation of pneumonia causes in the context of robust immunisation programmes is an ongoing priority for child health. Case-control studies undertaken in high-income countries have reported viral pathogens, particularly respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), to be a major cause of pneumonia in children vaccinated with 13-valent PCV (PCV13), 7, 8 but data are few from low-income and middle-income countries. Furthermore most causal data comes from crosssectional samples of pneumonia cases admitted to hospital, but cause might vary with patient age or severity of disease.\n\nDevelopment of improved methods for specimen collection in children and advances in molecular diagnostics have strengthened the ability to identify potential pathogens. 9 Sputum induction has been reported to be feasible in infants and eff ective for microbiological confi rmation of childhood tuberculosis, 10 but few studies have assessed its use in childhood pneumonia. 11 Better specimens and increasingly sensitive detection methods allow for identifi cation of a broad range of pathogens and for comparison of cause by disease severity.\n\nIn 2015, we reported a high incidence of pneumonia and severe disease in children enrolled in the Drakenstein Child Health Study, 12 a South African birth cohort study, despite high immunisation coverage including PCV13. In this study, we aimed to longitudinally investigate the causes of pneumonia in this cohort using a novel design.\n\nWe did a nested case-control study of children included in the Drakenstein Child Health Study 12 who developed pneumonia from May 29, 2012 , to Dec 1, 2014. The Drakenstein Child Health Study 12 was undertaken at two public, primary health-care clinics located about 2 km apart in Paarl, a periurban area in South Africa. One clinic (TC Newman) served a mixed-race population and the second clinic (Mbekweni) a black African population. Pregnant women aged 18 years or older, at 20-28 weeks' gestation, attending one of the two clinics for antenatal care, and remaining in the area for at least 1 year were enrolled. Ethics approval was obtained from the University of Cape Town Faculty of Health Sciences Research Ethics Committee, and the Provincial Research committee approved the study. Mothers provided written informed consent at enrolment and provided consent after the fi rst year.\n\nAll births occurred at Paarl hospital. Follow-up of children was done from May 29, 2012, through early childhood 13 and paralleled routine child health visits at 6, 10, and 14 weeks and 6, 9, 12, 18, 30, and 42 months. An additional study visit was done at 6-10 weeks at Paarl hospital.\n\nAll children were given primary health care and immunisations at the two clinics including four doses of a fi ve vaccine combination (diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, H infl uenzae type b, and inactivated polio vaccine) at 6, 10, and 14 weeks and 18 months; the measles vaccine at 9 months and 18 months; and the PCV13 at 6 weeks, 14 weeks, and 9 months.\n\nContinuous pneumonia surveillance was implemented at all local clinics and at Paarl hospital. Mothers were given a mobile phone number if they needed to contact the study team at any time. Mothers were counselled regarding key respiratory symptoms and advised to attend or contact study staff whenever a child developed cough or diffi culty breathing. Primary health nurses and study staff were trained to recognise WHO-defi ned pneumonia or severe pneumonia. 14 Study staff reviewed patient records at catchment clinics (Phola Park, Thokoza;\n\nWe searched PubMed for articles published in English from Jan 1, 2000, to Aug 31, 2015, with the search terms \"child\", \"pneumonia\", \"aetiology/etiology\", and \"pneumococcal conjugate vaccine\". We identifi ed case-only, cross-sectional, or case-control studies predominantly from high-income countries. These studies reported reductions in admissions to hospital for pneumonia during childhood after introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination (PCV) with viral pathogens commonly detected. However, scarce comprehensive causal data are available after 13-valent PCV (PCV13) introduction, especially in low-income and middle-income countries where the predominant burden of pneumonia occurs. Furthermore, available data focus on cases admitted to hospitals, are cross-sectional, seldom include comparison with a carefully selected control group, and rarely investigate comprehensively for potential bacterial and viral pathogens in diff erent specimens.\n\nWith a unique design we did a nested case-control analysis of organisms associated with pneumonia in an African birth cohort study, using state-of-the-art diagnostic techniques.\n\nVaccination coverage, including for PCV13, was high. The incidence of pneumonia was high, especially for children in the fi rst 6 months of life with about a third of cases requiring admission to hospital. Several organisms were identifi ed at the time of pneumonia onset. Respiratory synctial virus was the predominant pathogen and occurred early in infancy. Other organisms strongly associated with pneumonia were Bordetella pertussis and infl uenza virus, whereas bocavirus, adenovirus, parainfl uenza viruses, Haemophilus infl uenzae, and cytomegalovirus were less strongly associated with pneumonia. Testing of both induced sputum and nasopharyngeal specimens identifi ed the presence of signifi cantly more potential pathogens, including B pertussis and some viruses compared with testing only nasopharyngeal specimens.\n\nChildhood pneumonia remains an important public health problem despite the introduction of PCV13. Several organisms might cause this disease. An induced sputum specimen adds value to the diagnostic work-up even in young infants. New vaccines and novel strategies to prevent pneumonia, such as immunisation of pregnant women against respiratory synctial virus, are needed.\n\nJJ du Preez, Paarl; Klein Nederburg, Paarl, South Africa) and Paarl hospital, and performed surveillance for any missed pneumonia episode. All admissions to hospital were at Paarl hospital, the only hospital serving this population. Children were followed throughout their duration in hospital, and at 2 days and 6 weeks after discharge or after an ambulatory episode.\n\nLongitudinal measurement of risk factors (nutrition, environment, vaccinations received, and child and maternal factors) was done at study visits and at case presentation. Infant anthropometry and maternal smoking or passive smoke exposure were measured by urine cotinine longitudinally and at case presentation. 15 Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected every 2 weeks for the fi rst year in a subgroup (intensive cohort); enrolment in the intensive cohort was at the participant's discretion. All children had nasopharyngeal swabs taken every 6 months. A chest radiograph was done in infants with pneumonia who had been admitted to hospital. Laboratory staff were masked to case-control status.\n\nCases were any episode of pneumonia, irrespective of severity, excluding congenital pneumonia (defi ned as presentation before postnatal discharge).

By design, controls could be sampled more than once, but this occurred only infrequently. We did separate analyses of cases compared with asymptomatic controls and with controls with symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection (ie, cough, runny or blocked nose, or sore throat).\n\nFor every case, two nasopharyngeal swabs (FLOQSwabs, Copan Diagnostics, Murrieta, CA, USA) and an induced sputum specimen were obtained. 10 The fi rst nasopharyngeal swab taken was immediately transferred into nucleic acid preservation medium (PrimeStore, Longhorn Vaccines and Diagnostics, San Antonio, TX, USA), the second swab was placed into 1 mL of skimmed milk-tryptone-glucose-glycerol (STGG) transport medium. Swabs were transported on ice to the laboratory and frozen at -80\u00b0C for batch testing. The swab in STGG was cultured for bacteria; total nucleic acid was extracted from the swab in nucleic acid preservation medium with mechanical lysis on a Tissuelyzer LT (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) followed Data are median (IQR), n (%), or N.

Every induced sputum specimen was transported to the laboratory on ice and split into two aliquots. The fi rst underwent nucleic acid extraction and testing with FTDResp33, as previously stated; the second was cultured for bacteria. A blood culture for bacteria was obtained in cases admitted to hospital.\n\nFor control children, two nasopharyngeal swabs were collected at each visit and stored for later retrieval and processing as described for case swabs. Laboratory staff were masked to case-control status.\n\nWeight-for-age and height-for-age Z scores were derived from WHO child growth standards. 16 Socioeconomic status comprised a composite of asset ownership, household income, employment, and education. 13 We compared data from cases and controls with conditional logistic regression. Dependent variables of interest were organisms from FTDResp33, analysed as binary (present or absent) and continuous (log copies or specimen) values. Model building examined potential confounding factors identifi ed a priori from demographic and clinical measures of child's sex, in-utero HIV exposure, maternal age, maternal smoking, and socioeconomic status; because no clear confounding factors were consistently identifi ed based on appreciable changes in the point estimate for pathogen-pneumonia associations, models presented account for matching factors only. Because children might have had more than one episode of pneumonia (and thus participate in more than one case-control set), we also examined mixed-eff ects models with children and casecontrol sets as random or fi xed eff ects, and also conditional logistic regression models restricted to fi rst case episodes. We based co-organism analysis on matched casecontrol pairs, investigating the presence or absence of two organisms at a time. Of 16 possible response patterns, seven involved co-occurrence, with the less than one, one, or more than one pattern of co-occurrence in both cases and controls not adding information that diff erentiated cases from controls. The observed frequencies of the remaining six response patterns were compared with their expected values based on the hypothesis of random cooccurrence with a Pearson \u03c7\u00b2 test. Multiple p values for diff erent organism pairs were corrected with use of the Benjamini-Hochberg correction for false discovery rate. We did subsidiary analyses to stratify case-control comparisons on pneumonia severity and control children's symptoms. Throughout, regression diagnostics followed standard procedures, and all statistical tests were two-sided \n\nThe sponsors of the study had no role in the study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. All authors had full access to all the data and had fi nal responsibility for the decision to submit for publication. Table 1 shows characteristics of cases and controls. 967 children accrued 1145 child-years of follow-up. 719 (74%) children were enrolled in the intensive cohort (with nasopharyngeal swabs collected every 2 weeks for the fi rst year). Cohort retention was high with only 130 (13%) of 967 children lost to follow-up.\n\nTobacco smoke exposure was common (table 1) . 242 (25%) mothers smoked during pregnancy and 374 (39%) had passive smoke exposure. Although 198 (20%) mothers had HIV infection, only two children had HIV infection (one case, one control). Although 762 (79%) mothers initiated breastfeeding, only 342 (46%) were exclusively breastfeeding by 6-10 weeks, and 165 (26%) by 6 months (table 1) . Immunisation coverage was high at 6, 10, and 14 weeks and 9 months (table 1) . However, vaccines were delayed by more than 2 weeks in 55 (7%) of 790 children at 6 weeks, 105 (14%) of 745 children at 10 weeks, 165 (23%) of 719 children at 14 weeks, and 88 (16%) of 539 children at 9 months (table 1).\n\n24 infants had congenital pneumonia and were excluded from this present analysis. There were 314 cases of pneumonia, an incidence of 0\u00b727 episodes per child-year (95% CI 0\u00b724-0\u00b731) with similar incidences at each clinic. 30 pneumonia cases were excluded with incomplete specimen collection. The highest incidence was in children aged 1-6 months (0\u00b754 episodes per child-year [95% CI 0\u00b746-0\u00b762]) and in winter (0\u00b751 episodes per child-year [0\u00b743-0\u00b761]; appendix p 1). Male sex, low socioeconomic status, HIV exposure, lack of breastfeeding, more than two household smokers, lower birthweight, and delayed vaccinations were associated with an increased risk of pneumonia (table 1) . In multivariate analysis, only male sex, birthweight, and socioeconomic status were signifi cantly associated with pneumonia (data not shown). Most cases (205 [72%] of 284) of pneumonia were fi rst episodes and 79 cases (28%) were repeat episodes, of which most (51 [65%]) were second events. 60 (21%) pneumonia cases were severe (incidence 0\u00b705 episodes per child-year [95% CI 0\u00b704-0\u00b707; appendix p 2). Almost a third of children (92 [32%]) were admitted to hospital, and 45 children (16%) received oxygen therapy (appendix p 2). Median age of children with pneumonia was 5 months (IQR 3-9), whereas the median age of children with severe pneumonia was 2 months (1-4; p=0\u00b7001; appendix p 2). Most cases (237 [84%]) received antibiotics (87 [95%] children admitted to hospital and 150 [78%] in ambulatory care). Chest radiographs, available for 80 (87%) of 92 children with pneumonia who were admitted to hospital, had radiological changes of pneumonia in 60 (75%). Median duration of hospital stay was 3 days (IQR 2-5; appendix p 2). Of the children admitted to hospital, there were three deaths due to pneumonia, a case fatality rate of 1%. Two control children died-one from liver failure and one from sudden infant death syndrome.\n\nBlood cultures were available from 90 (98%) of 92 children with pneumonia admitted to hospital; cultures were only positive and grew S pneumoniae from an infant aged 1 month who had not received PCV13.\n\nA total of 284 pneumonia cases and 418 age-matched and site-matched controls (selected from the 719 intensive cohort who had nasopharyngeal swabs taken every 2 weeks) were included in case-control analysis from nasopharyngeal swabs. A median of fi ve organisms (IQR 4-6) were reported in cases and controls. An organism was detected in about 97% of swabs from cases or controls; both viruses and bacteria were detected in ; table 2 ). The associations were strongest when comparisons were restricted to asymptomatic controls, compared with those with upper respiratory tract infection symptoms (appendix p 5). C pneumoniae was not detected. These organism-specifi c associations persisted when cases were stratifi ed by disease severity; however, RSV was more strongly associated with severe pneumonia (OR 25\u00b730, 95% CI 3\u00b730-191\u00b761) than with pneumonia (appendix pp 6-7). In severe pneumonia, quantitative load of S aureus and of M catarrhalis was signifi cantly lower in cases than controls, but no other signifi cant diff erences were reported (appendix p 7).\n\nOf viral organisms, signifi cant diff erences were noted in the age of cases, seasonal distribution, and clinical features (table 3) . RSV or infl uenza were detected in younger children than in those with parainfl uenza, adenovirus, or bocavirus (table 3) . Age-specifi c incidence of RSV was highest for ages 1-6 months (0\u00b715 episodes per child-year [95% CI 0\u00b711-0\u00b720]); incidence in those aged younger than 1 month was 0\u00b704 episodes per child-year (0\u00b701-0\u00b711), 0\u00b705 episodes per child-year (0\u00b703-0\u00b709) in infants aged 6-12 months, and 0\u00b703 episodes per child-year (0\u00b701-0\u00b706) in those aged 12-18 months. RSV, infl uenza virus, and bocavirus were more common in winter, whereas adenovirus and parainfl uenza virus occurred predominantly in spring (table 3) . RSV was associated with a higher prevalence of wheezing, greater prevalence of lower chest wall indrawing, and a higher median respiratory rate compared with other viruses (table 3) .\n\nDespite several organisms being present in both cases and controls, patterns of co-prevalence (of any two organisms) were similar. No signifi cant diff erences were noted between cases and controls in co-prevalence of any two organisms (appendix pp 8-10).\n\nIn 251 (88%) cases, a matched nasopharyngeal swab and induced sputum sample were obtained; a median of six organisms (IQR 4-7) were detected on induced sputum compared with fi ve (4-7) on nasopharyngeal swabs (p=0\u00b748). There was an increased yield from testing induced sputum for several organisms and all viruses, most notably for B pertussis ( \n\nThis study showed that pneumonia is a major cause of illness and admissions to hospital, particularly in the fi rst 6 months of life, despite excellent immunisation coverage including PCV13. Several viruses, most strikingly RSV, were strongly associated with pneumonia. B pertussis was strongly associated with pneumonia, but occurred in a small number of children; H infl uenzae was less strongly associated with pneumonia but was common. Induced sputum samples provided an increased yield for detection of potential pathogens compared with nasopharyngeal swabs. Despite high severity of disease, we recorded a low case fatality attesting to good access to care and a strong primary health-care programme.\n\nSeveral potential pathogens were identifi ed in children with pneumonia, adding to evidence that childhood pneumonia and severe disease might often not be due to a single organism. 7, 8 RSV, the most identifi ed organism, was associated with severe disease but not with high mortality, which is consistent with global and African data preceding use of PCV that reported RSV to be the most common pathogen in children with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). [17] [18] [19] These results are similar to those from a 2015 meta-analysis 20 of case-control studies in childhood in which RSV was most strongly associated with LRTI, with infl uenza, parainfl uenza, and human metapneumovirus also important causative organisms. 20 With increasing uptake of PCV in lowincome and middle-income countries, the proportion of LRTI due to viruses-particularly RSV-could be expected to increase. 21 In South Africa, in view of these incidence rates, about 324 000 pneumonia cases might be expected in infants annually, with almost 71 300 cases due to RSV. In our study, many children had wheezing associated with RSV, raising the question of whether these were cases of pneumonia or of bronchiolitis. In our study we applied WHO pneumonia defi nitions because they are widely used for their high sensitivity. Furthermore, pneumonia and bronchiolitis are a spectrum of LRTI, representing diff erent manifestations of infection or host response. Of note, RSV occurred in young infants with the peak incidence in those younger 6 months, as has been previously reported. 17 Maternal immunisation against RSV during late pregnancy might therefore be an attractive novel strategy to prevent disease in young infants. 22 Bacterial-viral co-infections have been reported to be important, especially in severe pneumonia. 23 In an African PCV9 trial, 24 immunisation reduced hospital admissions for viral LRTI by a third, suggesting that pneumococcal-viral co-infection leads to severe pneumonia. Another study 23 reported that an increasing number of co-infections was associated with more severe disease and higher mortality in children admitted to hospital with LRTI. However in our study, the only bacteria associated with pneumonia were B pertussis and H infl uenzae. B pertussis occurred in young infants and mostly before completion of the three immunisations; immunisation of pregnant women with B pertussis might be eff ective to prevent this burden. 25 The observed association between H infl uenzae and pneumonia supports recent evidence suggesting that non-typeable H infl uenzae might be an important pathogen in pneumonia. 26 Although the strength of the association was relatively weak, since H infl uenzae was identifi ed in more than half of cases the contribution of this organism to pneumonia might be substantial. The absence of an association of other bacteria with pneumonia could refl ect several possibilities. High PCV13 coverage reduces pneumonia incidence, as described in other settings. 4,6,27 In a USA case-control study 7 of children admitted to hospital for pneumonia who had received PCV, more than two-thirds were reported to be due to viral causes (with RSV predominating) whereas only 7% of children had bacterial-viral co-infection. Additionally, bacterial-viral co-infection has been predominantly associated with severe or very severe pneumonia, 23,24 but in our study most cases were non-severe pneumonia. Finally, bacterial causes might be especially diffi cult to ascribe because of high rates of colonisation. Specimens from the upper respiratory tract might be of little use to establish bacterial causes. Research is needed to understand interactions between organisms and the role of several potential pathogens.\n\nDefi ning the aetiology of pneumonia might be challenging. To obtain a representative sample from the lower respiratory tract might be diffi cult in young children and contamination with colonising organisms, such as S pneumoniae, could occur. 11 This contamination might lead to an underestimation of the contribution of bacteria causing pneumonia. Similarly, although new molecular diagnostics enable detection of many respiratory viruses and less easily culturable bacteria, distinguishing live pathogenic organisms from those colonising or infecting the upper respiratory tract or residual nucleic acid from previous infections is diffi cult. 9 Taking samples from the upper respiratory tract, therefore, restricts inferences of causality regarding lung disease. Furthermore, multiplex PCR identifi es a broad range of potential pathogens, but the sensitivity for individual pathogens might be lower than a singleplex PCR. Sample quality is another key determinant of the accuracy of a diagnostic test, but we could not verify the quality of samples, or normalise quantitative results to a host target. A strength of this study is the use of diff erent or several specimens, which increases detection of organisms. In a pre-PCV Kenyan study 18 of children admitted to hospital with pneumonia, culture or PCR of blood, induced sputum, oropharyngeal, and nasopharyngeal specimens led to incremental detection of organisms. However, with a case-control analysis of nasopharyngeal swabs, RSV was the only signifi cantly associated pathogen. 18 Similarly, although our study was able to detect several potential pathogens through intensive specimen collection and use of sensitive assays, the case-control analysis showed signifi cant associations with pneumonia for only B pertussis, H infl uenzae, RSV, infl uenza virus, parainfl uenza, adenovirus, bocavirus, and cytomegalovirus.\n\nThis study is, to our knowledge, one of the fi rst to show that use of induced sputum samples might improve diagnostic yield, especially for specifi c organisms. Of note, induced sputum was obtainable in young infants and in those with severe pneumonia. Although the value of induced sputum for microbiological confi rmation of tuberculosis in children has been shown in large studies, 10 in our study its use showed a substantial incremental yield for B pertussis and for some viruses associated with pneumonia. A Kenyan study 18 found induced sputum increased the yield of potential bacterial pathogens compared with blood culture, and detected a virus in more than half of children admitted to hospital with pneumonia. However, there was discordance between results from induced sputum and blood culture samples. 18 A Finnish study 28 reported that a potential bacterial or viral pathogen was detected by PCR in 97% of children admitted to hospital with pneumonia with an adequate induced sputum sample. Accurate detection of a pathogen-eg, B pertussis-enables timely appropriate treatment, infection control, and could help to reduce morbidity. Use of induced sputum samples should be further investigated for causal diagnosis of childhood pneumonia.\n\nWe found quantitative analysis of organism load unhelpful for distinguishing colonising from pathogenic organisms, except for RSV. However, since RSV was strongly associated with pneumonia its quantifi cation did not provide additional information. Our study highlights the need for better diagnostics in childhood pneumonia to distinguish colonisation from pathogenic organisms, particularly for potential bacterial pathogens. Until more specifi c tests for bacterial causes are available, no changes can be made to WHO's recommended empirical therapy with antibiotics. 14 Several features of our study strengthen our results. First, selection of cases and controls from a large prospective cohort allows inferences that extend beyond those aff orded by case-only designs, while minimising for selection biases in previous studies of pneumonia causes. Second, investigation of causes by pneumonia severity (including ambulatory cases and cases admitted to hospital) and control symptomatology allows more defi nitive examination of pathogen associations. However, our study is still limited by absence of data for longitudinal nasopharyngeal colonisation to attribute causes at the time of pneumonia onset. Longitudinal analyses are underway to address this issue and to further study co-pathogens. Although we might have missed some cases of pneumonia, the pneumonia surveillance systems, longitudinal review of patient records, and excellent cohort retention ensured that this was extremely rare. These results might not be generalisable to low-income and middle-income countries with lower levels of immunisation coverage or in countries where H infl uenzae type b or PCV are not included in immunisation programmes. However, the uptake of H infl uenzae type b and PCV globally including in Africa has increased, 29 so these results are likely to be widely applicable in low-income and middle-income countries. Our study provides important new information on the association between specifi c organisms and pneumonia after children have received PCV in a middleincome country, but also highlights the complexities in ascribing causality and in defi ning the role of several organisms in childhood pneumonia."}
