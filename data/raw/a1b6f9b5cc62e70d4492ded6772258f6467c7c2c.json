{"title": "TRANSPORT OF VIRAL GLYCOPROTEINS AND ITS MODULATION BY MONENSIN 1 APPEARANCE OF NEWLY-SYNTHESIZED HEMAGGLUTININ AT THE APICAL SURFACE OF INFLUENZA VIRUS-INFECTED CELLS We used a surface immune precipitation procedure (4) to examine the effect of monensin on the kinetics of transport of", "body": "FIRELLI V. ALONSO-CAPLEN ET AL. influenza virus HA protein to cell surfaces. The HA protein was detected on surfaces of untreated or monensin-treated cells infected with influenza virus (A/WSN strain) as early as 20 min after synthesis (Fig. 1) . However, there was a dramatic difference in the rate of cleavage of HA since the HA. protein, a cleavage product, was present on the surface of monensin-treated cells only after 60 min, whereas the HA. protein in controls was detected after a 20min chase period. In addition, the incorporation of H-mannose into HA protein in monensin-treated cells was markedly higher than in controls, suggesting an inefficient trimming of mannose residues during processing of the HA protein in the presence of the ionophore. With another virus strain (A/USSR), HA had a faster electrophoretic mobility in monensin-treated cells (Fig. 2) , but was detected at surfaces of control or monensin-treated cells after a 20min chase. The incorporation of H-mannose into HA protein in monensin-treated cells was also significantly higher when compared to untreated cells. These results indicate that the HA protein is transported to the apical surfaces of monensin-treated MDCK cells at a rate similar to that of controls. \n\nPrevious reports indicated that the directional transport of viral glycoproteins is a characteristic not only of singly-but also of doubly-infected MDCK cells (5) . We therefore wished to determine the effect of monensin on transport of HA and G proteins in MDCK cells simultaneously infected with influenza virus and VSV. No significant differences were observed in the levels of HA expression on surfaces of untreated or monensin-treated doubly-infected MDCK cells (Fig. 3 A) . The level of expression of neuraminidase (NA) protein on surfaces of control or monensin-treated cells was also found to be similar (Fig. 3B ). In contrast, the amount of G protein present in the plasma membrane of controls was markedly greater than on surfaces of cells cultured in the presence of the ionophore (Fig. 3C ). The level of fluorescence with antibody to G protein in monensin-treated doubly-infected cells was higher than in VSV-infected cells treated with the ionophore; however, similar fluorescence intensities were observed when cells singly infected with influenza virus were stained with anti-G antibody, indicating that the observed fluorescence represents a higher background level. (Table 1) . Infectivity titeyrs of influenza virus were not significantly affected even at a 10\" M concentration of monensin. In cpntrast, yields of VSV showed greater than a 99% decrease at 10\" M or 10\" M monensin when compared to controls. These results indicate that the differential effect of monensin on influenza and VSV replication is similar in singly-and doubly-infected MDCK cells. \n\ninhibited by 90% or more at 10\" or 10\" M monensin (Fig. 4A) . Similarly, yields of cell-associated IBV virions were significantly reduced, indicating that monensin is not merely blocking exocytosis of infectious particles but the production of virus particles as well. As shown in Fig. 4B , viral protein synthesis was observed at 10\" M monensin, where infectious virus yields were reduced by over 90% as compared to controls. This suggests that monensin inhibits the assembly and release of infectious IBV particles under conditions where no effect on viral protein synthesis is observed. At 10\" M monensin, there was a significant decrease in viral protein synthesis, but this concentration may be toxic to the host cell. In a recent report (9), it was shown that monensin blocked the release of a murine coronavirus from infected cells. However, virus assembly at the membranes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum was not inhibited by monensin, and there was an apparent accumulation of cell-associated virions. It will be of interest to determine whether the differences in these results may be related to the differences in glycosylation processes of murine and avian corona viruses (9, 12) . When yields of released and cell-associated SSH virions were examined (Fig. 5A) , it was found that monensin did not block virus assembly or the release of SSH particles into culture supematants. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analysis of SSH-infected BHK21 cells treated with the ionophore (Fig. 5B ) revealed the synthesis of all viral proteins. In contrast, other investigators (10, 11) have reported that monensin inhibits the replication of LaCrosse (LAC) virus, another bunyavirus.\n\nInfectious virus yields were greatly reduced but the synthesis of viral proteins was not affected (10); in addition, there was an accumulation in monensin-treated cells of an incompletely processed form of Gl, one of the two envelope glycoproteins of LAC (11)\u00b7 The difference between these results may be related to the slower replication cycle of LAC in BHK21 cells as compared to SSH. \n\nOur results indicate that systems for the intracellular transport of viral membrane glycoproteins in MDCK cell monolayers differ in sensitivity to monensin. Influenza virus glycoproteins, HA and NA, are transported to the free apical surfaces via a monensinresistant pathway, whereas the targeting of VSV G protein to the basolateral membrane domain involves a monensin-sensitive route. These distinct transport pathways are functional not only in singlyinfected but also in doubly-infected MDCK monolayers.\n\nOur findings suggest that sorting of viral glycoproteins occurs at the stage when they exit from the Golgi apparatus enroute to the plasma membrane, since monensin is thought to block glycoprotein transport at the level of the Golgi complex. We have also observed a differential effect of monensin on enveloped viruses which assemble at intracellular membranes. The replication of IBV and its release from the membranes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum are inhibited, whereas monensin treatment of host cells has no effect on the formation of SSH virions. Possibly, the actual budding process of IBV may be more easily affected than that of SSH by changes in ionic gradients within the host cell that may occur as an effect of monensin treatment."}
