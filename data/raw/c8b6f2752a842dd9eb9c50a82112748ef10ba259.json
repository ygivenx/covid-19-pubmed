{"title": "", "body": "The outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was reported in Wuhan, Hubei, China. According to the World Health Organization on February 24th 16, about 77,269 viral infected patients and at least 2596 deaths were confirmed globally.\n\n2019-nCoV genome shows high similarity some bat coronaviruses as well as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) which has caused two large-scale pandemics in the last two decades . They all belong to betacoronavirus genus, which is a type of positive-stranded RNA viruses (Wu et al., 2020a; Zhou et al., 2020) .\n\nLike SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, 2019-nCoV can spread from the human to human and cause fever, severe respiratory illness, and a series of unidentified pneumonia disease (Chan et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) .\n\nComparing with SARS-CoV and MERS, 2019-nCoV seems to be more readily transmitted from human to human, spreading to multiple countries and regions and leading to the WHO declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (Chan et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020b) .\n\nCoronaviruses utility the spike (S) proteins to select and enter target cells.\n\nSARS-CoV S protein and 2019-nCoV S protein engages angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as their entry receptor (Li et al., 2003; Zhou et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020) . ACE2 is the cellular entry receptor of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV, which plays an indispensable role for SARS-CoV infection (Li et al., 2003; Zhou et al., .

ACE2 is a type I membrane protein expressed in the lung, heart, kidney, and intestine . Enhanced expression of ACE2 accelerates SARS-CoV infection and spread, while silencing of ACE2 blocks its entry into cells (Li et al., 2003) . Organs and tissues with high ACE2 abundance like the lung, kidney and small intestine are the infection targets of 2019-nCoV . Taken together, these findings reveal that the expression level of ACE2 is extremely important for the successful infection of SARS-nCoV and 2019-nCoV. Here we analyzed the various microarray database of virus infected-or inflammatory stimulated-animals and cells, and clearly show that virus infection including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can obviously upregulate ACE2 expression, which suggests that 2019-nCoV may use similar strategies to augment its infection and spread.\n\n.

Briefly, target cells were washed twice with 37\u00b0C DMEM medium, then virus that diluted in serum-free medium were added to the cells.

ACE2 expression is upregulated in human primary keratinocytes exposed to IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3. Primary keratinocytes from 3 donors were either untreated (control) or exposed to cytokines IFN\u03b1, IFN\u03b3. 24 hrs after treatment, total RNA was extracted for subsequent microarray analysis.

TRIF, an adaptor protein of TLR3 pathway, also induce the expression of ACE2 in HEK293 cells (Figure 3 ).\n\nWe retried microarray database submitted in NCBI and analysis ACE2 expression levels during virus infection.

From the microarray database, we observed that ACE2 expression can also be stimulated by type I IFNs including IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b2 and type III IFN such as IFN\u03b3. In human bronchial epithelial cells stimulated by IFN\u03b2 (1000U/ml), ACE2 is significantly upregulated at 6, 8, 12, and 18 hours post treatment, especially at 18 hours (Figure 7) , ACE2 is increased more than 4-folds comparing with the mock group (Shapira et al., 2009) . We also found that ACE2 can be significantly induced by IFN\u03b3 treatment in human primary keratinocytes (Figure 8) . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

Acute kidney injury is a predictor of high mortality in SARS patients (Chu et al., 2005) . In the lung, human ACE2 is primarily existed in type II and type I alveolar epithelial cells. ACE2 is mainly expressed in AT2 cells and also detected in AT1 cells, airway epithelial cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and macrophages (Wei et al.\n\nAs the cellular receptor of SARS-CoV and 2019-CoV, ACE2 plays an essential role during these virus infections (Li et al., 2003; Zhou et al., 2020) . The ACE2 level is the decisive factor for 2019-nCoV infection . These observations drive us to explore whether ACE2 is a virus infection responsive gene. Here we analyzed the database of virus infected-or inflammatory cytokine-stimulated cells or tissues and clearly show that ACE2 can be upregulated by virus infection and inflammatory cytokine-stimulation. However, whether the upregulation by ACE2 by . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

We already notice that the promoter region of ACE2 exists several immuneand cytokine-responsive transcript factor binding sites such as JUN. Next, we will evaluate whether ACE2 is upregulated by JNK signaling cascades. Importantly, the inducibility of ACE2 by inflammatory cytokines also implies that \"cytokine storm\" caused by 2019-nCoV not only damage host tissues but also may accelerate virus spread (Chen et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020) .\n\nOverall, this study provides the first evidence that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and maybe 2019-nCoV can upregulate its cellular receptor ACE2 to facilitate their infection and spread. Thus, reducing ACE2 expression by siRNA or other drugs may be a direction for drug development. Because this cluster of viruses uses the same cellular receptor ACE for entering, thus preparation drugs which can reduce ACE2 expression may be useful for the future emerging infectious diseases. Our study also suggests that people infected by other viruses such as influenza or with high inflammatory cytokines may more susceptible to 2019-nCoV. This study also indicated that targeting the expression of ACE2 is a direction for drug development and infection control.
