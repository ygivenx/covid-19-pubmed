{"title": "Fusion Resistance and Decreased Infectability as Major Host Cell Determinants of Coronavirus Persistence", "body": "Within the past few years considerable progress has been made towards characterizing, in molecular terms, some of the events involved in the coronavirus replication cycle. Murine coronaviruses, exemplified by mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), are now known to contain three major structural proteins (Cheley and Anderson, 1981; Sturman, 1977) , of which the intravirion localizations (Sturman et al, 1980 ) as well as some intracellular activities (Collins et al, 1982; Holmes et aI., 1981) have been documented. In addition, significant advances have been made concerning the steps involved in RNA transcription, including the characterization of genomic and messenger RNA species (Cheley et aL, 1981a, b; Lai et aL, 1981; Leibowitz et al, 1981; Spaan et al, 1981; as well as the assignments of virus-specified structural and nonstructural polypeptides to individual messenger RNAs (Leibowitz et ah, 1982; Rottier et uZ., 1981; . Complementary DNA (cDNA) probes are now available (Cheley et uL, 1981a, b; Leibowitz and Weiss, 1981) which may be used for the detection and analysis of MHV RNA.\n\nWith these newly gained insights into coronavirus replication, it is now possible to investigate individual parameters in the infectious cycle to determine which factors play a key role in determining the outcome of infection. A number of strains of MHV have received much interest as a result of their demonstrated ability to become persistent under certain conditions, both in vivo and in vitro (Lucas et al, 1977 (Lucas et al, , 1978 Robb and Bond, 1979; Sorensen et cd, 1980) . A variety of mechanisms implicated in in vitro MHV persistence have been reported in the literature, involving the generation of temperature-sensitive (Holmes and Behnke, 1981) , cold-sensitive (Stohlman et uk, 1979) , and small plaque (Hirano et al, 1981) virus mutants. Studies by Lucas et al. (1977 Lucas et al. ( , 1978 , however, demonstrated that MHV persistence in a number of cul-407 0042-6822/83 $3.00\n\nCopyright 0 1983 by Academic Press, Inc. All rights of reproductmn I\" any form reserved tured cell lines did not entail the production of detectable virus mutants, suggesting that these were not mandatory for establishment of the persistent state. The present report describes some characteristics of a persistent MHV infection in a subline of mouse LM fibroblasts, in which persistence is host cell-regulated and does not involve any apparent change in the input wild type virus. The results strongly suggest that, in this system, persistence is due not to suppression of virus replication but rather to an ability of the host cell to resist infection and to withstand cytopathic effects, i.e., cell fusion.\n\nCeUs and wirus. The A59 strain (Manaker et d, 1961) of MHV was used for these studies. Cells used were the L-2 line (Rothfels et al, 1959) , here designated L, and the thymidine kinase-deficient LM line (Kit et al, 1963) , here designated LM-K. This latter cell line is not the same as the LM cells (Merchant and Hellman, 1962) used in previous studies (Anderson and Bilan, 1981; Cheley et aL, 1981b) . For comparison, LM-K cells were found to be more infectible by MHV and gave rise to higher virus titers than LM cells (unpublished).\n\nIn&e&&m an& culture conditions. Cells were propagated in Eagle's minimal essential medium (MEM), supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS). Monolayers of either L or LM-K cells were inoculated with pretitered stocks of MHV, adsorbed 30 min at 32.5\", washed three times with MEM, and then incubated at 37\" in MEM containing 5% FCS. For long-term culture studies, medium was changed on a daily basis. Aliquots were removed from culture media at various time intervals for analysis of virus yields by plaque assay on L cells (Lucas et al, 1977) .\n\nIrlfectious center assay. To determine the number of infected cells in MHV-inoculated cultures, cells were harvested at 2 hr postinoculation (p.i.) by trypsinization after thrice washing with citrate saline. Harvested cells were freed from trypsin by centrifugation (2 min at 600 9) and resuspended in MEM supplemented with 5% FCS. Aliquots of the resuspended cells and dilutions therefrom were plated on monolayers of L cells, allowed to attach for 2 hr at 32.5\", then overlaid with MEM containing 5% FCS and 0.5% methylcellulose (4000 cps). Plaques were read after 24 hr at 37\".\n\nAssay for ceU surface fusion activity. Sparse cultures of L and LM-K cells (lo5 cells/35 mm plate) were inoculated with MHV at a multiplicity of inoculation (m.o.i.) of 0.01 and 10, respectively (to produce roughly equal infectious centers). After adsorption and washing as above, cultures were incubated 5 hr at 37\". At this time lo6 uninfected L or LM-K cells were added to the cultures to fill in the spaces left unoccupied by the original, sparsely seeded cells. Cultures were photographed and scored either positive or negative for syncytial formation after 3 hr incubation at 37'.\n\nRNA extraction and semiquantitation bp clot blotting. Cell monolayers (lo6 cells in 35 mm plates) were harvested with a modified guanidine hydrochloride (Strohman, 1977) procedure. Cells were solubilized with 1 ml of 7.6 M guanidine-HCl in 0.1 1M potassium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, and the viscous mixture was homogenized by aspiration five times through a l-ml sterile plastic syringe (Yale) fitted with a 21-gauge needle. Samples were transferred to tissue culture tubes (Falcon), mixed with 0.6 vol of 95% ethanol, cooled for 12 hr at -2O\", and centrifuged at 5000 Q for 20 min to pellet RNA. RNA pellets were dissolved in 250 ~1 7.6 M guanidine-HCl in 0.1 1K potassium acetate, pH 5.0, to which was added 250 ~120 X SSC (1 X SSC (standard citrate saline) is 0.15 M sodium chloride, 0.015 M trisodium citrate). Samples were subsequently heated for 15 min at 50\". For dotblot hybridization, 50-~1 aliquots of the samples or of serial lo-fold dilutions therefrom were applied in a Schleicher and Schuell \"Minifold\" filtration apparatus to nitrocellulose sheets (0.45 pm, Millipore) supported on three layers of slab dryer filter paper (Bio-Rad). Both nitrocellulose sheets and filter paper had been previously equilibrated with 10 X SSC. After sample application, sheets were dried at SO\" for 1 hr. Sheets were nreannealed, annealed with   TABLE 1 p2P]cDNA (prepared as described (Cheley et ok, 1981a) against MW nucleocapsid protein mRNA), and washed essentially according to the procedure of Thomas (1980) . The ability of this cDNA to detect all positive-sense MHV-specific RNAs identified to date has been documented (Cheley et aL, 1981a, b) . The annealed and washed sheets were autoradiographed to yield the dot blots. Densitometric scanning analysis was performed on selected sample dots for which autoradiographic intensities were less than saturated. MHV(A59) antiserum. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and autoradiography as previously described (Cheley and Anderson, 1981) .\n\nTo perform the comparisons documented in subsequent sections of this report, it was initially necessary to standardize results on an infected cell basis. Toward this end, cultures of L or LM-K cells were inoculated at m.o.i.'s ranging from 0.01 to 10 and, following a Z-hr incubation period, numbers of infected cells determined by infectious center assay. Under nonsaturating conditions (i.e., when the m.o.i. is less than l), LM-K cells were found to be approximately 500-fold less infectable than correspondingly inoculated L cells. Also evident from Table 1 is the observation that comparable numbers of infected cells are produced when L cells are inoculated at an m.o.i. of 0.01 and LM-K cells are inoculated at an m.o.i. of 10. The basis for the differential infectibility of the two cell types is currently under investigation but appears to involve an early event, within the adsorp-Virus Yield.sfiom MHV-Infected L and LM-K Cells are Comparable\n\nSince infectious center assays showed that a much higher inoculum was necessary to produce comparable numbers of infected LM-K as L cells, virus yields were determined on cultures inoculated with a range of m.o.i.'s. If L and LM-K cells were equally efficient virus producers, virus outputs from the two cell types would be comparable, once cultures were standardized on the basis of equal numbers of infectious centers. On this basis, virus production from LM-K cells (m.o.i. = 10) would be expected to most closely parallel virus production from L cells inoculated at an m.o.i. of 0.01. In fact, in terms of both virus yields and chronological similarity, the LM virus titration curve appeared most comparable to that of L cells inoculated at an m.o.i. of 0.1 (Fig. 1A) . Hence, on an infected cell basis, LM-K cells are at least as efficient as L cells in producing infectious progeny MHV.\n\nIn contrast to MHV-infected L cells, cultures of MHV-infected LM-K cells continued to produce progeny virus in an undulating fashion over the 7-day period of study (Fig. 1B) . Longer-term studies (data MIZZEN ET AL. not shown) have shown that infected LMfected cell lines (Lucas et d, 1978) . Periodic K cell cultures continue to produce progeny infectious center assays of long-term culvirus over a period of several weeks, in a tures showed that between 1 and 10% of cyclical fashion similar to that previously the cells were infected at any given timedescribed for a number of persistently inpoint, suggesting that MHV persistence in LM-K cells is mediated by a carrier-culture mechanism, involving virus propagation and transmission among a relatively small fraction of the total cell population.\n\nVirus isolated from infected LM-K cells showed no appreciable temperature sensitivity when assayed for growth in L cells at 32.5,37, or 39.5\". Plaque morphology on L cells was also unaltered from that seen with stock MHV. As with previously described persistent MHV infections (Lucas d a& 1978) , it therefore seems unlikely that MHV persistence in LM-K cells necessitates the production of ts virus mutants.\n\nSupernatant MHV-infected LM-K culture fluids, which had been freed from virus by centrifugation at 100,000 g for 1 hr had no inhibitory effect on MHV replication when incubated with MHV-inoculated L cells. Therefore, no evidence was found for the production of soluble antiviral factors which might suppress virus production and contribute to persistence. \n\nUsing an MHV-specific =P-labeled cDNA probe (Cheley et aL, 1981a) the relative amounts of positive-sense viral RNA were determined in MHV-infected L and LM-K cells by dot blotting. For each timepoint assayed, aliquots were taken from three serial lo-fold dilutions of the RNA extracted from lo6 cells. In this way nonsaturating autoradiographic images of the viral RNA in at least one dilution of each sample could be obtained by the dot-blotting technique. In all cultures examined, background levels of viral RNA, i.e., up to 2 hr p.i., were extremely low (Fig. 2) , attesting to the high specificity of the probe for MHV-RNA. L cells inoculated at an m.o.i. of 10 showed significant viral RNA at 4 hr p.i.; this increased considerably by 6 hr p.i. before dropping off somewhat by (Fig. 2, lanes 2-5) . LM-K cultures inoculated with an m.o.i. of 10 showed a pattern of viral RNA synthesis most closely resembling that seen in L cells inoculated with an m.o.i. of 0.01, i.e., a lOOOfold lesser inoculum than that used for the LM-K cells. This value is in reasonably good agreement with the difference in infectability of the two cell lines as determined by infectious center assay (Table 1) . There would, therefore, appear to be no great difference in the levels of viral RNA synthesis, on an infected-cell basis, between the two cell lines. The similarity in viral RNA levels between LM-K (m.o.i. = 10) and L (m.o.i. = 0.01) cells is most striking during the first 16-20 hr p.i., which approximately represents the time required for one cycle of virus growth (Cheley et al, 1981b) . Densitometric analysis of the dot blots for these two cultures showed, in fact, levels of viral RNA comparable to within 40%, for each of the time points assayed between 6 and 20 hr p.i.\n\nAn extended term analysis of viral RNA in LM-K cells (Fig. 2b) demonstrated a somewhat cyclical variation in RNA levels over a period of 7 days. While viral RNA persisted in the LM-K cultures for the duration of the 7-day experiment, the most long-lived L cell infection (i.e., that inoculated with an m.o.i. of 0.01) showed viral RNA only for 2 days, after which time cell lysis and lifting of the fused monolayer terminated the culture. Moreover, the level of viral RNA was seen to drop dramatically between Day 1 and Day 2 in the L cell culture (by 99% by densitometric analysis) consistent with rapid decline of integrity of the culture.\n\nBoth size and spread of virus-induced syncytia were found to be much reduced in cultures of MHV-infected LM-K cells as compared to MHV-infected L cells. L cells inoculated at m.o.i.'s of 10, 1, 0.1, or 0.01 showed complete fusion of the monolayer at 8,10,20, or 24 hr pi., respectively; thereafter, the fused monolayer began to detach from the plastic substrate. In contrast, LM-K cells inoculated at an m.o.i. of 10 showed only ea. 20% of the monolayer fused after --100  20  48  ----20  72  ----20  96  ----10  120  ----20  144  ----20  168  ---20 o Expressed as area percent of total monolayer. Dashes indicate detachment of the fused monolayer from the plastic petri plates. 24 hr p.i. (Table 2) . Moreover, in the infected LM-K culture, there was no increase in this level of fusion with time; rather, cell fusion declined slowly (to ea. 10% of the monolayer by Day 4), followed by an increase (to ea. 20% by Day 7). Cyclical variations of cell fusion over periods of several weeks have been a common feature of MHV-infected LM-K cultures maintained in our laboratory.\n\nSyncytial morphology is also indicative of depressed fusion levels in infected LM-K as opposed to infected L cells (Fig. 3) . Individual syncytial foci in infected L cell cultures (m.o.i.'s of 0.01 or 0.1) were roughly circular and rapidly expanding, suggesting facile recruitment of neighboring uninfected cells. In contrast to those observed in infected L cells, LM-K cell syncytia showed little radial expansion. Rather, they tended to remain narrow and anastomotic in appearance, thus preserving relatively large areas of uninfected cells. This observation is highly suggestive of a dynamic balance between infected and uninfected cells in MHV-infected LM-K cultures, which would contribute to a persistent state.\n\nTo test for the presence of viral structural proteins, including the protein responsible for cell fusion (Collins et al, 1982) , in MHV-infected L and LM-K cells, immunoprecipitation was performed on extracts prepared from cultures labeled with [35S]methionine at 8 hr p.i. As shown in Fig El (and precursor PEl), E2, and N, were present in both L and LM-K cells, in roughly similar proportions. Thus, the observed lack of fusion in MHV-infected LM-K cells is not likely due to defective synthesis of viral fusion protein. This viral fusion protein has been shown by Collins et al (1982) to be the E2 polypeptide. The addition of indicator L cells to sparse cultures of either infected L or LM-K cells resulted in rapid spread of fusion throughout the indicator cells. However, when LM-K cells were used as indicators, no fusion was observed (Fig. 5) . This experiment shows that there is no lack of viral fusion protein at the LM-K cell surface. We, therefore, conclude that the difference in syncytial formation between infected L and LM-K cultures is due to resistance of uninfected LM-K cells to fusion with infected neighboring cells. This resistance must be due to an inherent property of the LM-K cell membrane. Such a conclusion is also inferred by observations made earlier (Fig.  3) , namely that syncytia in infected LM-K cultures remain narrow and show little radial expansion when compared to infected L cultures. tent infection of MHV: a reduced level of infectability and a resistance to undergoing syncytial formation, when in contact with MHV-infected cell neighbors. It is apparent that MHV persistence in LM-K cells involves a dynamic balance between infected and noninfected cells. Persistence is, therefore, a feature of the entire culture and not of individual cells. The observed reduced levels of cell fusion in MHV-infected LM-K (as contrasted with L) cell cultures would act as a dissemination-limiting factor, thus contributing to the continued survival of remaining uninfected cells. Survival of uninfected cells is also assured as a result of the relatively higher resistance of LM-K cells to MHV infection. Results presented in this study show that MHV, even at an m.o.i. of 10 (determined on L cells) can only infect about 1% of inoculated LM-K cells. Levels of circulating virus (of the order of 10' PFU/ml) would, therefore, be inadequate to ensure infection of a substantial proportion of all LM-K cells in culture (ca. lo6 cells/culture in the present study).\n\nDespite the documented differences in infectability and manifestation of fusion between L and LM-K cells, it is clear that the two cell lines do not differ much in synthesis of viral RNA or in the production of infectious progeny. Although viral protein was not quantitated in the present study, it is apparent that sufficient quantities are produced in LM-K cells to yield normal virus outputs (compared to L cells). In addition, all three MHV structural proteins are present in infected LM-K cells as well as L cells, as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation. It is also apparent that adequate amounts of viral fusion protein are synthesized and expressed on the surface of infected LM-K cells to induce cell fusion with a \"fusion-permissive\" cell line, i.e., the L cell. Thus, the reduced incidence of cell fusion in the LM-K culture is likely due to inherent resistance of the LM-K cell Effects on membrane properties as determined by membrane to MHV-induced fusion. virus probes.
