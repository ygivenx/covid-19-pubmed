{"title": "", "body": "f f Clarification on mask use during droplet precautions I am writing in reference to the Clinical Issues response on the topic of \"Implementing droplet precautions\" (January 2011, Vol 93, No 1) . Near the end of the response was the statement, \"For a patient with Staphylococcus aureus in the nares, the health care provider or visitor should place a mask on his or her face within 4 feet of the patient.\" 1(p170) The 2007 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) document Guideline for Isolation Precautions: Preventing Transmission of Infectious Agents in Healthcare Settings 2 is cited as the source of the information for the response. However, it is concerning that the information was not applied correctly in response to the droplet precautions question in distinguishing S aureus colonization from active infection.\n\nIn Appendix A of the CDC document, \"Type and duration of precautions recommended for selected infections and conditions,\" S aureus is listed as requiring standard precautions. 2 (1996) , which are cited as references 118-120 in the CDC document, this might explain why she instructed mask usage for S aureus.\n\nRecommended practices for infection prevention and control do not suggest routinely donning a droplet mask when treating patients with S aureus in the nares. Strong relationships should be formed between OR and infection prevention staff members to provide education, clarification, and guidance regarding isolation precautions. This will reduce transmission of organisms and unnecessary waste of personal protective equipment as well as eliminate confusion with practices."}
