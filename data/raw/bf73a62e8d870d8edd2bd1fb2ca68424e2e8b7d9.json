{"title": "Public antibodies to malaria antigens generated by two LAIR1 insertion modalities", "body": "individuals living in malaria-endemic regions. We report that 5-10% of malaria-exposed individuals, but none of the European blood donors tested, have high levels of LAIR1-containing antibodies that dominate the response to IEs without conferring enhanced protection against febrile malaria. By analyzing the antibody-producing B cell clones at the protein, cDNA and gDNA level, we characterized additional LAIR1 insertions between the V and DJ segments and discovered a second insertion modality whereby the LAIR1 exon encoding the extracellular domain and flanking intronic sequences are inserted into the switch region. By exon shuffling, this mechanism leads to the production of bispecific antibodies in which the LAIR1 domain is precisely positioned at the elbow between the VH and CH1 domains. Additionally, in one donor the gDNA encoding the VH and CH1 domains was deleted, leading to the production of a camellike LAIR1-containing antibody. Sequencing of the switch regions of memory B cells from European blood donors revealed frequent templated inserts originating from transcribed genes that, in rare cases, comprised exons with orientation and frame compatible with expression. Collectively, these results reveal different modalities of LAIR1 insertion that lead to public and dominant antibodies against IEs and suggest that insertion of templated DNA represents an additional mechanism of antibody diversification that can be selected in the immune response against pathogens and exploited for B cell engineering.\n\nLAIR1-containing antibodies were initially isolated from two Kenyan donors who were selected from a large cohort of more than 500 individuals for their capacity to produce broadly reactive antibodies to P. falciparum-IEs2. To establish the prevalence of LAIR1containing antibodies among malaria-exposed individuals, we screened plasma samples from two large cohorts in Tanzania3 and Mali4. To identify LAIR1-containing antibodies irrespective of their specificity for parasite isolates, we developed a two-determinant immunoassay using beads coated with anti-LAIR1 or a control antibody. Six out of 112 Tanzanian donors (5.4%) and 57 out of 656 Malian donors (8.7%) had detectable levels of LAIR1-containing IgG (Fig. 1a ). In addition, 2-4% of African donors had LAIR1-containing IgM, with no or variable levels of LAIR1-containing IgG (Fig. 1b, c) . In contrast, only 3 and 4 out of 1043 European blood donors showed a low positivity in the IgG and IgM LAIR1 assay, respectively. The presence of LAIR1-containing antibodies was confirmed by the isolation of 52 immortalized B cell clones from seven East and West African donors (Extended Data Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1 ), while we were not able to isolate LAIR1-containing monoclonal antibodies from four European donors that showed serum reactivity. The finding that 5-10% of individuals living in malaria-endemic regions produce LAIR1-containing antibodies is suggestive of a public antibody response.\n\nTo investigate the contribution of LAIR1-containing antibodies to the response to IEs, we dissected this response at the polyclonal and monoclonal level. Staining of IEs with plasma from selected individuals with LAIR1-containing antibodies revealed that the majority of IEs was recognized by the LAIR1 antibodies, while only a minority of IEs was recognized by conventional IgG (see examples in Fig. 1d) . Furthermore, when the immortalized memory B cell clones from four donors were analyzed for reactivity to IEs and for the presence of LAIR1, all of the anti-IE monoclonal antibodies from three donors and most of the antibodies from the fourth donor contained the LAIR1 insert (Fig. 1e ). These findings dominated by LAIR1-containing antibodies, a finding that may be explained both by their breadth and by clonal expansion.\n\nTo investigate the nature of the LAIR1 insertion, we sequenced cDNA and gDNA from B cell clones isolated from different individuals. As previously reported for the first two Kenyan donors2, the B cell clones isolated from four Malian and Tanzanian donors (E, F, O and Q) contained an insertion of the LAIR1 exon with flanking intronic sequences between the V and DJ segments, positioning the LAIR1 domain in the CDR3 loop ( Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 1 ). The size of the insert and the partial splicing of the upstream intronic region differed between donors, but were identical in the sister clones isolated from each individual, indicating that in each donor the LAIR1-containing antibody response is monoclonal.\n\nStrikingly, B cell clones from three additional donors showed a different insertion modality ( Fig. 2b-d) . The cDNA of clones isolated from donors M (Malian) and J (Tanzanian) contained only the LAIR1 exon, which was precisely located between the JH and CH1. In both cases, gDNA analysis revealed that a DNA fragment comprising the LAIR1 exon flanked by intronic sequences was inserted into the switch \u03bc region (Extended Data Fig. 2 ) and, by alternative splicing, gave rise to two mRNA variants with or without the LAIR1 insert. This was confirmed by the production of antibodies with or without LAIR1 in similar proportions by a single B cell clone (Fig. 2e) . Another example of LAIR1 insertion into the switch region was observed in donor B (Kenyan), from whom we isolated a B cell clone (MGB47) producing a truncated LAIR1-containing IgG3 heavy chain without an attached light chain (Fig. 2f, g) . In this clone, the gDNA carried multiple deletions that removed most of the VDJ and the entire CH1 region, leading to the production of a camel-like antibody5 (Fig. 2d ). Taken together, the above findings highlight a new modality of exon insertion in the switch region that can add an extra domain to an antibody.\n\nThe two insertion modalities result in the production of antibodies with non-conventional structures in which an additional domain is inserted in the CDR3 or in the elbow between the VH and CH1 (Fig. 3a) . To investigate the effect of the insert position on antibody specificity, we designed different constructs in which unmutated LAIR1, mutated LAIR1 or other Ig-like domains were inserted into the CDR3 or into the elbow region of an antibody of known specificity that was used as a scaffold (Fig. 3b) . Antibody constructs carrying LAIR1 stained IEs and were recognized by an anti-LAIR1 antibody, independent of the LAIR1 position in the scaffold. While insertion of LAIR1 into the CDR3 of an antibody specific for the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)6 abolished binding to GM-CSF, insertion of LAIR1, programmed cell death-1 (PD1), or signaling lymphocytic activation molecule family member (SLAM) Ig-like domains into the elbow region did not affect binding to GM-CSF. This indicates that the VH-CH1 elbow is permissive for insertions of different domains without affecting the original antibody specificity and may therefore be suitable for the generation of bispecific antibodies.\n\nTo analyze the role of somatic mutations we aligned and compared the LAIR1 sequences of 52 antibodies (Extended Data Fig. 3 and Extended Data Table 1 ). LAIR1 inserts between the positions 67, 77 and 102 that determined distinct patterns of reactivity with parasite isolates, as well as loss of collagen binding (Fig. 3c) . In contrast, LAIR1 inserted into the switch region carried only a few substitutions, which were however sufficient to abolish collagen binding. In particular, the camel-like antibody MGB47, which had the highest level of amino acid substitutions among those with inserts in the switch region, showed a considerable breadth since it stained 8 out of the 9 parasites tested. Interestingly, we found that unmutated LAIR1 bound to a few isolates when tested at 1 \u03bcg ml -1 and to all parasites when tested at a 100-fold higher concentration (Fig. 3c) . We conclude that the unmutated LAIR1 domain binds with low affinity to most parasite isolates and that mutations can increase affinity and modify the spectrum of cross-reactivity. Furthermore, the finding that collagen binding is lost even in cases where the somatic mutation mechanism is less effective, as in the case of insertions into the switch region, suggests that there is strong pressure to \"redeem\" this BCR from autoreactivity7.\n\nThe insertion of an extra exon in the switch region represents a new modality of antibody diversification, analogous to exon shuffling8,9, that has the potential to generate a panoply of bispecific antibodies. To ask how generally and how frequently templated DNA sequences are inserted in the switch region, we isolated gDNA from switched memory B cells of European blood donors, amplified the switch regions and sequenced them using the Illumina platform (Extended Data Fig. 4 ). Using a bioinformatics pipeline, we identified templated inserts at a frequency of approximately one in >10 3 B cells, with the length of the inserts ranging from <100 to >1000 nucleotides (Fig. 4a , Extended Data Fig. 5 and Supplementary Tables 2-4). Switch region inserts could also be detected using long-read MinION sequencing of intact amplicons, which provided a suitable platform for insert identification, in spite of its high error rate10. Using MinION, we confirmed the identity of several inserts using biological replicates and estimated a higher frequency of templated inserts in the range of one in a few hundred switched memory B cells ( Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 6 ). In contrast, no insert was detected in the switch region of na\u00efve B cells (Fig  4c) . Interestingly, most of the inserts were derived from genic regions from all chromosomes and in particular from genes expressed in B cells, such as PAX5 and EBF1 (Fig. 4b ,e,f and Extended Data Fig. 7) . The genic inserts, which account for 75% of all inserts, were derived from introns, exons and, in some cases, comprised an entire exon with preserved splice sites (Fig. 4d) . A fraction of the latter had the correct frame and orientation for the potential expression of an extra protein sequence in the Ig elbow (Extended Data Fig. 8 ). Taken together, the above findings indicate that templated inserts derived from transcribed genes are frequently found in the switch regions of memory B cells.\n\nWe have shown that LAIR1-containing antibodies are produced by two insertion modalities and have a prevalence of 5-10% of individuals exposed to malaria infection, suggesting that they may contribute to acquired immunity to blood-stage parasites. However, in spite of their breadth and opsonizing activity2, the presence of LAIR1-containing antibodies did not confer improved protection against febrile malaria (Extended Data Fig. 9 ), a finding that may be explained by the fact that the LAIR1-containing antibodies recognize only a fraction of cultured parasites and may allow the selection of escape mutants. A thorough investigation of the role of the LAIR1-containing antibodies in vivo will require the isolation of autologous parasites from the individuals who possess these antibodies.\n\nIt is unusual that in all cases observed so far, the LAIR1-containing antibodies are produced by a single expanded B cell clone that dominates the antibody response to IEs in these individuals. The finding that unmutated LAIR1 has the inherent ability to bind to IEs explains how the insertion of this domain results in the generation of public antibodies with a common specificity. Furthermore, the fact that this domain binds to all parasite isolates tested, albeit with low affinity, suggests a mechanism for the extraordinary clonal expansion and selection of mutated antibody variants with improved affinity and breadth by repeated infections with different P. falciparum parasites. These findings illustrate, in a biologically relevant system, the power of clonal selection driven by both antigen binding and loss of self-reactivity. Furthermore, the binding of IEs to LAIR1 suggests the possibility that the parasite might target this inhibitory receptor to modulate the host immune response.\n\nThe LAIR1 insertion in the switch region resulting in the expression of a new domain in the elbow between the VH and CH1 domains represents a new and possibly general example of protein engineering by exon shuffling8,9, as suggested by the frequent occurrence of templated inserts. While insertions in the CDR3 loop result in monospecific antibodies, insertions in the switch region do not affect the specificity of the original antibody but rather add a second specificity which is found in approximately half of the antibodies produced due to alternative splicing. We are not aware of deliberate attempts to engineer the antibody elbow, and in this context, nature has shown considerable ingenuity by taking advantage of the exon shuffling principle.\n\nIt has been reported that in mice, chronic P. chabaudi infection promotes genomic instability leading to chromosomal translocations involving the switch region11. Although we cannot exclude that the LAIR1 insertions in the switch region observed in African donors may have been promoted by malaria infection, the frequent templated insertions found in European blood donors would be consistent with a general mechanism that does not necessarily rely on malaria infection. Nevertheless, the data suggest that it is the exposure to the malaria parasite that selects the rare B cells with a LAIR1 insertion in the VDJ or switch region. Finally, it remains to be established whether chromosomal translocations and templated insertions share a common mechanism.\n\nThe finding of templated inserts in the switch region of switched memory B cells, but not na\u00efve B cells, suggests that the insertions occur in germinal centers as a consequence of unconventional repair of AID-induced double-strand DNA breaks. Similarly, repair of RAGinduced double-strand breaks during B cell development in the bone marrow may give rise to insertions in the CDR3. Our finding that switch region inserts are derived from transcribed genes suggests an involvement of nascent RNA as an insert template and recent publications have shown that nascent RNA12,13 as well as foreign RNA14,15 can be used to repair double-strand DNA breaks. Furthermore, multiple templated inserts from transcribed genes have been observed in engineered double-strand breaks in a human cell line and mouse pro-B cells14,16. However, we cannot exclude accessible DNA as a primary substrate. The possibility of inducing human na\u00efve B cells to switch in vitro offers an opportunity to study the mechanism of templated insertions and to engineer B cells by manipulating the factors involved in DNA repair and by offering different substrates. \n\nKenyan plasma samples were obtained from adults living in a malaria-endemic region within Kilifi County. Tanzanian serum and plasma samples were obtained from healthy male volunteers, malaria negative at study enrolment and during PBMC collection, HIV and Hepatitis B and C negative, age 25.4 \u00b1 2.8 (mean +/-SD)3. The Mali study was conducted in the rural village of Kalifabougou where intense P. falciparum transmission occurs from June through December each year. 610 individuals (310 males and 300 females) were enrolled, age ranging from 1 to 26 years (mean 9). The cohort has been described in detail elsewhere4. Smaller numbers of sera were also obtained from adults in the Fulani and Dogon ethnic groups in Mant\u00e9ourou, Mali. 48 individuals (28 males and 20 females) were enrolled, age ranging from 21 to 57 years (mean 39.7).\n\nIn all cases, written informed consent was obtained from the participants (or guardians of participating children) before inclusion in the study. \n\nP. falciparum parasites were initially obtained from children who were diagnosed with malaria in Kilifi County, Kenya. The parasites were adapted to in vitro culture and cultivated using standard protocols17. The P. falciparum laboratory line 3D7 was also cultured under the same conditions. 3D7 D21 is derived by enrichment of 3D7 parasites reactive with the LAIR1-containing monoclonal antibody MGD21. Parasites were cryopreserved at the late trophozoite stage in small aliquots for subsequent use in assays.\n\nSera or plasma were tested for the presence of LAIR1-containing antibodies using a twodeterminant bead-based immunoassay. Anti-goat IgG microbeads (Spherotech) were coated with goat anti-human LAIR1 (R&D Systems, AF2664) and 40\u00d7 SYBR Green I (ThermoFisher Scientific) or with goat anti-human EGF (R&D Systems, AF-259-NA) without SYBR Green I for 20 min at room temperature. The beads were washed, mixed, and incubated with the sera at a 1/30 dilution for 1 h at room temperature under shaking conditions. Beads coated with anti-LAIR1 were differentiated from control beads coated with anti-EGF based on SYBR Green staining. Serum antibody binding was detected using 2.5 \u03bcg ml \u22121 Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated donkey anti-human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 709-606-098) or Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated donkey anti-human IgM (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 709-606-073). FACS Diva (version 6.2) was used for acquisition of samples and Flow-Jo (version 10.1) was used for FACS analysis. Delta MFI (median fluorescence intensity) was calculated by subtracting the MFI of the anti-EGF control beads from that of the anti-LAIR1 beads in the IgG or IgM channel.\n\nIgM or IgG memory B cells were isolated from frozen peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by magnetic cell sorting with anti-CD19-PECy7 antibodies (BD, 341113) and mouse anti-PE microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-048-081), followed by FACS sorting using goat Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated anti-human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 109-606-170) or anti-human IgM (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 109-606-129) and PE-labeled anti-human IgD (BD, 555779). As previously described18, sorted B cells were immortalized with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and plated in single cell cultures in the presence of CpG-DNA (2.5 \u00b5g ml \u22121 ) and irradiated PBMC-feeder cells. Two weeks post-immortalization, the culture supernatants were tested (at a 2/3 dilution) for the presence of LAIR1-containing antibodies using the bead-based immunoassay described above. For several donors, the culture supernatants were also tested for the ability to bind to IEs from a mixture of four parasite isolates (3D7-MGD21 + , 9106, 9605 and 11019) by flow cytometry. Briefly, cryopreserved IEs were thawed, stained with 10\u00d7 SYBR Green I for 30 min at room temperature, and incubated with the B-cell supernatants for 1 hour at 4\u00b0C. Detection of antibody binding was done with 2.5 \u03bcg ml \u22121 Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated goat anti-human IgG.\n\ncDNA was synthesized from selected B-cell cultures and both heavy chain and light chain variable regions (VH and VL) were sequenced as previously described19. The usage of VH and VL genes and the number of somatic mutations were determined by analyzing the homology of VH and VL sequences of monoclonal antibodies to known human V, D and J genes in the IMGT database20. Antibody-encoding sequences were amplified and sequenced with primers specific for the V and J regions of the given antibody. Sequences were aligned with Clustal Omega21.\n\nThe number of somatic mutations in the LAIR1 inserts was obtained by analyzing the homology of the inserts to the original LAIR1 genomic sequence (sequence from Ensembl genome database: ENSG00000167613). Amino acid sequences of LAIR1 inserts of all the antibodies discovered were grouped for each donor and aligned to the original unmutated LAIR1 sequence using Clustal Omega21. The replacement to silent mutation ratio (R/S) values were calculated at each codon for each donor. Mean (R/S) values above 2.9, indicative of positive selection, were used to highlight hot spots in the LAIR1 extracellular domain (PDB 3RP1) using the BioLuminate software (Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC, New York, NY, 2016 v2.4).\n\nAntibody heavy and light chains were cloned into human IgG1, Ig\u03ba and Ig\u03bb expression vectors and expressed by transient transfection of Expi293F Cells (ThermoFisher Scientific) using polyethylenimine (PEI). Cell lines were routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination. The antibodies were affinity purified by protein A chromatography (GE Healthcare). Variants of the GCE536, MGD21, MGM1 and MGJ5 antibodies were produced by inserting or exchanging the mutated or unmutated LAIR1 sequences or by substituting these sequences with the Ig-like domains of PD1 and SLAM genes (sequences from Ensembl genome database: ENSG00000188389 and ENSG00000117090, respectively). The antibody constructs were tested for staining of 9215 IEs and binding values (%) at 1 \u03bcg ml \u22121 antibody concentration were calculated by interpolation of binding curves fitted to a sigmoidal curve model (Graphpad Prism 7).\n\nGenomic DNA was isolated from B-cell clones with a commercial kit (QIAGEN). For analysis of the camel-like antibody MGB47, 3'RACE22 with the CH2-\u03b3-REV1 primer (gagaccttgcacttgtactccttgcc) was used for amplification of truncated heavy chain mRNAs. Heavy-chain variable to constant gDNA of MGB47 was amplified using an upstream 5' VH3-21 primer (gggtccatattgtgatcctgagtctggg) and CH2-\u03b3-REV1 as the reverse primer. After PCR amplification with LongAmp Taq Polymerase (New England Biolabs), the 6000bp amplicon was cloned into a vector using the TOPO XL PCR cloning kit (ThermoFisher) and sequenced by plasmid-NGS-sequencing (Microsynth, Switzerland). All other LAIR1 switch and V-DJ inserts were analyzed by PCR amplification of gDNA and Sanger Sequencing using donor-specific forward and universal reverse primers: donE_FW (cctggagggtcttctgcttgctggc), donF_FW (cctcctgctggtggcagctccc), donJ/M_FW1 (atggagtttgggctgagctgggttttcc), donJ_FW2 (gtgagtgaacacgagtgagagaaacagtgg), donM_FW2 (gagtgaacatgagtgagaaaaactggatttgtgtgg), donO/Q_FW (atgaaacatctgtggttctt), 3'J6_REV (ggcatcggaaaatccacagaggctcc), IgG_CH1_REV1 (tcttgtccaccttggtgttgct), IgG_CH1_REV2 (gtagtccttgaccaggcagc), IgM_CH2_REV1 (ggacacctgaatctgccggggactgaaaccc), and IgM_CH2_REV2 (ctggtcaccttgtaggtcgtgggcccag).\n\nGenomic DNA (gDNA) was isolated from FACS-sorted human na\u00efve (CD19 + CD27 -IgM + ) or memory B cells (CD19 + CD27 + IgG + /IgA + ) using a commercial kit (QIAGEN). Switch region PCRs on memory B cell gDNA were performed using LongAmp Taq Polymerase (New England Biolabs) in 50 \u00b5l reaction volumes with incubation for 3 min at 95\u00b0C, followed by 30 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 40 s, 60\u00b0C for 30 s, 65\u00b0C for 3 min and a final extension for 10 min at 65\u00b0C. The upstream switch-\u00b5 forward primer S-\u00b5-FW (cacccttgaaagtagcccatgccttcc) was combined with different reverse primers. IgG-switched B cell DNA was amplified using S-\u03b3-REV (cctgcctcccagtgtcctgcattacttctg)23 , which binds 3' of switch-\u03b3-regions, or CH2-\u03b3-REV1, which binds in the IgG-CH2 constant region, to allow amplification of alleles carrying a CH1 deletion. DNA deriving from IgA + sorted cells was amplified with primer S-\u03b1-REV (ctcagtccaacacccaccactcc). All reverse primers mentioned were designed to allow amplification of various IgG and IgA subclasses. The switch-\u00b5 region of na\u00efve B cell gDNA was amplified combining the S-\u00b5-FW primer with S-\u00b5-REV (ggaacgcagtgtagactcagctgagg). The PCR reaction was performed using Herculase II Fusion DNA Polymerases (Agilent) with 1 M betaine and 3% DMSO in a 50 \u00b5l volume at 98\u00b0C for 4 min followed by 30 cycles of 98\u00b0C for 40 s, 58\u00b0C for 30 sec and 72\u00b0C for 4 min, with a final extension for 10 min at 72\u00b0C. Size-selected, purified switch amplicons were sent to GATC Biotech (Germany) for library preparation, barcoding, and Illumina MiSeq sequencing.\n\nOxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) was used to generate biological and technical replicates of Illumina MiSeq sequencing runs. For biological replicates, barcodes (BC) were introduced by the addition of recommended BC-sequences to S-\u00b5 and S-\u03b3 primers and PCR amplification. The sequencing library was prepared using the Nanopore 2D sequencing kit SQK-LSK207, followed by loading onto Nanopore flow cells FLO-MIN106 and sequencing with the MinION Mk1B sequencer for up to 20 h.\n\nRecombinant monoclonal antibodies were produced in 293 Expi cells and tested for the ability to stain 3D7-MGD21 + and eight Kenyan parasite isolates2 by flow cytometry. Cryopreserved IEs were thawed, stained with 10\u00d7 SYBR Green I for 30 min at room temperature, and incubated with serial dilutions of the recombinant antibodies for 20 min at room temperature. Antibody binding was detected with 2.5 \u03bcg ml \u22121 goat Alexa Fluor 647conjugated anti-human IgG.\n\nSelected sera were screened for the presence of LAIR1-containing antibodies that could bind to IEs. A mixture of four parasite isolates (3D7-MGD21 + , 9106, 9605 and 11019) was stained with 10 \u03bcg ml \u22121 DAPI for 30 min at room temperature and incubated with test sera at a 1/30 dilution for 20 min at room temperature. The IEs were then incubated with goat anti-human LAIR1 (R&D Systems, AF2664) for 20 min at room temperature. The binding of LAIR1-containing antibodies to the IE surface was detected by the simultaneous addition of Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 705-546-147) and Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated donkey anti-human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 709-606-098).\n\nTotal IgGs were quantified using 96-well MaxiSorp plates (Nunc) coated with goat antihuman IgG (SouthernBiotech, 2040-01) using Certified Reference Material 470 (ERMs-DA470, Sigma-Aldrich) as a standard. To test specific binding of antibody constructs, ELISA plates were coated with 2 \u03bcg ml \u22121 of type I recombinant human collagen (Millipore, CC050), 2 \u03bcg ml \u22121 of an anti-human LAIR1 antibody (clone DX26, BD Biosciences 550810), 1 \u03bcg ml \u22121 of recombinant human GM-CSF (Gentaur), 2 \u03bcg ml \u22121 of an anti-PD1 or an anti-SLAM antibody (R&D Systems, AF1086 and AF164). Plates were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and incubated with titrated antibodies, followed by APconjugated goat anti-human IgG, Fc\u03b3 fragment specific (Jackson Immuno Research, 109-056-098). Plates were then washed, substrate (p-NPP, Sigma) was added and plates were read at 405 nm.\n\nB cell supernatants containing secreted antibodies were diluted in H 2 O, 4x sample loading buffer (Life Technologies) and 10x sample reducing agent (Life Technologies) and loaded onto precast gels with a 4-12% acrylamide gradient (Invitrogen). The iBlot2 apparatus (Life Technologies) was used for protein transfer to PVDF membranes followed by blocking for 1 h at room temperature with 3% BSA in TBS. The membrane was incubated with different combinations of primary and secondary antibodies diluted in TBS/1% BSA for 1 h at room temperature with 2 sequential TBS incubations to wash the membrane between incubations. For detection of IgG, anti-human IgG-biotinylated antibody (Southern Biotech, 2040-08) was used at 1 \u00b5g ml -1 , followed by 25 ng ml -1 streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 016-030-084). IgM isotypes were stained with 10 \u00b5g ml -1 unlabeled goat anti-human IgM (Southern Biotech, 2020-01) and 8 ng ml -1 donkey anti-goat HRP (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 705-036-147). To detect LAIR1-containing antibodies, a polyclonal goat anti-human LAIR1 antibody (R&D) at 2 \u00b5g ml -1 was combined with secondary donkey anti-goat HRP. Membranes were developed with ECL-substrate on a Las4000 imager (General Electric Company). \n\nWe generated a computational pipeline to analyze targeted amplicons of 300 bp paired-end (PE) reads obtained by MiSeq Illumina sequencing methodology (Extended Data Fig. 5 ). Raw sequences reads were trimmed to remove adapter contamination and poor-quality base calls using Trim Galore (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/, v0.4.2, parameters --Illumina --paired -q 20 --length 99). In addition, assessment of the PE reads was performed by average quality score per base position, using FastQC (http:// www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). Trimmed reads were aligned in paired-end mode to the GRCh37 human genome assembly using Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (v0.7.12, parameters: bwa mem)24 . The switch region of the IgH locus was defined on GRCh37, with the following coordinates: chr14:106050000-106337000. To find insertions in the IgH switch region locus, we selected genomic ranges when sequence coverage was above 2 reads and/or above 40 reads, thus, generating two respective and separated workflows, with a sequence length comprises between 50 bp and 2000 bp. Genome coverage was processed by Bedtools (http://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ index.html, v2.26.0) and a dedicated python script using pysam (https://github.com/pysamdevelopers/pysam) was written to identify potential insert. Briefly, in both workflows (2 and 40 reads), potential inserts were assigned if they fulfilled the following criteria: (i) one mapping read in 5' end is chimeric with the switch region (ii) one mapping read in 3' end is chimeric with the switch region (iii) two discordant reads have their mates read mapped in the switch region. Afterwards, inserts coming from 2 and 40 minimum reads coverage were merged according to the following rule: if the difference between two inserts that overlap was equal or below 10 bp, we kept the shortest one, otherwise the longest one is kept. The list of potential inserts was annotated using GENCODE v1925 and BEDOPS tools26 and individually validated by a de novo assembly of the contig sequence. Non-chimeric, but\n\nproperly paired reads mapping the insert coordinates and chimeric reads corresponding to the encompassing mate pairs and spanning mate pairs, were extracted using SAMtools27. Reads mapping to the switch region were extracted only if they were spanning mate pairs related to the insert coordinates. Selected reads were uniquely mapped to the region of interest (no XA tag), with a minimum mapping quality of 5. Original reads sequences were retrieved, pull together and used as input files to perform a de novo assembly using the Trinity software28. Finally, to validate a contig sequence for each insert, we used BLAST29 (command-line version, v2.5.0+). The consensus insert sequences were \"blasted\" against the switch region and we removed the inserts that had an alignment with at least half of their sequence length at a minimum 80 % identity (parameters: -task megablast -dust no -perc_identity 80). Then, we blasted each contig sequence against the switch region sequence and the consensus insert sequence (parameters: -task blastn -dust no -perc_identity 70) to confirm if the contig was made of the complete insert sequence and if the contig contained two flanking sequences of at least 50bp that matched the switch region. The shortest contig that fulfilled the criteria mentioned above was selected for each insert.\n\nTo analyze targeted amplicon 2-4 kb reads obtained by ONT sequencing methodology, we developed a pipeline (Extended Data Fig. 6 ). Raw sequences reads were quality-filtered using Metrichor basecaller (https://metrichor.com/s/). 2D reads with a sequence length above 1000bp (or 2000bp depending on the primers used for the amplification) were aligned against GRCh37 human genome assembly with LAST software30 (parameters: last-train and lastal -p ONT_fasta_sequences.par last-split -m1e-6). Then we parsed LAST output and selected reads that contain an insert (minimum 50 bp length), two flanking regions of minimum 100 bp mapping to the switch region (switch locus defined as chr14:106050000-106337000) and allowing a gap of 100 bp maximum between the insert and the switch region. Finally, we merged the insert coordinates of the overlapping inserts with bedtools and annotated the inserts list with GENCODE v1925 using BEDOPS tool26. Scripts are available at MinION and Illumina inserts coordinates were merged with Bedtools (merge command with default parameter). The circular genomic representation of the inserts has been generated using the Circos software31. Switch inserts with genic (intron or exonintron) origin were subjected to an enrichment analysis using EnrichR and the Human Gene Atlas as the gene-set library32,33.\n\nThe number n described in the figure legends refers to the number of independent experiments. The analysis of the relationship between the presence of LAIR1-containing antibodies and protection from malaria was performed in the R statistical environment (v3.2.5). Two-tailed Fisher's exact tests were performed to investigate the association between LAIR1-containing antibodies and protection from febrile malaria.\n\nScripts for Illumina and MinION sequence analysis are available at https://bitbucket.org/ mathildefog/switchillumina and https://bitbucket.org/mathildefog/switchminion, respectively.\n\nSequence data of the monoclonal antibodies isolated in this study have been deposited in GenBank (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) with the accession codes indicated in Supplementary "}
