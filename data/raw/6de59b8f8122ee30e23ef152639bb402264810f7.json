{"title": "The inhaled corticosteroid ciclesonide blocks coronavirus RNA replication by targeting viral NSP15", "body": "The COVID-19 outbreak began on December 2019 in Wuhan, China (1), and the causative virus, SARS-CoV-2, has rapidly spread into 43 countries as of February 27, 2020. The number of infected patients exceeds 81,000, and the death toll exceeds 2,700. Several drugs, including lopinavir, remdesivir, and chloroquine, have been reported to be presumably effective in treating this disease (2, 3) .\n\nSystemic treatment with corticosteroids is contraindicated for the severe pneumonia caused by viruses such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, as steroids suppress the innate immune system, resulting in increased viral replication. In fact, for SARS in 2003 and MERS in 2013, treatment with corticosteroids was associated with increased mortality (4, 5). In the present study, we reconsider the use of inhaled corticosteroids, which have been excluded from the treatment of pneumonia caused by coronavirus.\n\nSteroid compounds, which are expected to have dual functions in blocking both coronavirus replication and host inflammation, were screened from a chemical library. The cytopathic effect caused by MERS-CoV infection was measured to evaluate viral replication. Four steroid compounds, ciclesonide, mometasone furoate, mifepristone, and algestone acetophenide conferred a greater than 95% cell survival rate (Fig. S1 ).\n\nNext, concentration-dependent viral growth suppression and drug cytotoxicity were assessed. Ciclesonide exhibited low cytotoxicity and potent suppression of viral growth (Fig.   1a ). Cortisone and prednisolone, which are commonly used for systemic steroid treatment, dexamethasone, which has strong immunosuppressant effects, and fluticasone, a commonly used inhaled steroid, did not suppress viral growth (Fig. 1a) .\n\nThe antiviral effects of steroids against various species of viruses were tested by quantifying propagated virus in culture medium. Ciclesonide and mometasone also suppressed replication of other coronaviruses, HCoV-229E and SARS-CoV, but not replication of RS virus or influenza virus (Fig. S2 ). In addition, ciclesonide slightly but significantly inhibited rubella virus (having positive strand RNA genome) replication (Fig. S2 ), suggesting that ciclesonide interacted with the replication site of positive-strand RNA virus intracellularly.\n\nTo identify the drug target of virus replication, we conducted 11 consecutive MERS-CoV passages in the presence of 40 \u03bc M ciclesonide or 40 \u03bc M mometasone. A mutant virus that developed resistance ciclesonide was generated (Fig. 1b) , but no resistant virus to author/funder. All rights reserved.

Next-generation sequencing identified that an amino acid substitution at A25V (C19647T in the reference sequence NC_019843.3) in nonstructural protein 15 (NSP15), coronavirus endoribonuclease (6-8), was the predicted mechanism for viral resistance to ciclesonide. A recombinant virus carrying the A25V amino acid substitution (Re-Nsp15-A25V) was generated from the parental MERS-CoV/EMC strain (Re-EMC/MERS) with a BAC reverse genetics system (9), which overcame the antiviral effect of ciclesonide (Fig. 1c) . Interestingly, the mutant virus was inhibited by mometasone, suggesting that the antiviral target of mometasone was different from that of ciclesonide.\n\nNext, the effect of ciclesonide on SARS-CoV-2 infection was evaluated. VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells(10) were infected with authentic SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of steroids or other inhibitors. At 6 h post-infection, cellular RNA was isolated, and real-time PCR was conducted to quantify the amount of viral RNA (11). Ciclesonide and mometasone suppressed viral replication with a similar efficacy to lopinavir (Fig. 2a) . For comparison, viral cell entry inhibitors were tested. E64d substantially reduced viral RNA levels, but nafamostat and camostat had only modest antiviral effects, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 primarily utilized the cathepsin/endosomal pathway of cell entry rather than the TMPRSS2/cell surface pathway to enter TMPRSS2-expressing cells, consistent with a recent study (12). author/funder.
