{"title": "3D Tissue-Like Assemblies: A Novel Approach to Investigate Virus-Cell Interactions", "body": "Three-dimensional (3D) tissue culture systems are used in cell biology and physiology, immunology, cancer research, microbiology (bacteriology and virology) and tissue engineering to facilitate investigations in a more physiological setting than is obtained with 2D-tissue culture systems. Many bioreactor systems and other experimental devices have been used to establish 3D tissues that emulate properties similar to human and mammalian tissues in vivo [1] [2] [3] . Here we describe our approach to establish an optimized 3D tissue culture system using a rotating wall vessel (RWV) reactor to study viral infections and virus/ host interactions.\n\nTissue culture explant models were established in the 1920s, which allowed maintenance and expansion of organ tissues in culture or on filters [4, 5] . For certain tissues (e.g. skin), it was critical to keep the cultures at the air-liquid interface, thereby providing conditions similar to the in vivo environment [6] . To maintain native tissue architecture, 1-5 mm 2 tissue explants were grown on collagen-coated cellulose sponges surrounded by plasma clots in roller tubes [2, 7] . A number of these systems are well established and widely used in contemporary research. However, the disadvantages of explant systems are that ex vivo tissues from humans are limited and often difficult to obtain. Explant cultures are also short lived and prone to necrosis due to insufficient nutrient and oxygen transfer within the tissue. Furthermore, it remains almost impossible to genetically modify primary tissues, while cultured cells can be readily modified using various targeted genome-editing techniques such as transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENS) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR/Cas9) [8] [9] [10] . To circumvent these limitations, culture systems have been established that allow de novo assembly of analogue 3D tissues for a variety of applications.\n\nThe establishment of high-density 3D tissues in vitro using mammalian cells is challenging due to shear forces, turbulence, inadequate oxygenation and restricted nutrient transfer that can disrupt or damage the cultures. Peripheral cells commonly grow readily while cells in the center of the tissue undergo necrosis due to nutrient and oxygen deprivation. To provide a constant source of nutrients, chambers were developed that allowed metabolic exchange between a pool of medium and the culture chamber by diffusion across a membrane. This histo-physiological gradient mimics to some degree, the diffusion of essential nutrients in tissues [7, 11] . To enhance the establishment of 3D tissues in vitro, Nandi and colleagues embedded the cultures in collagenous gels providing a scaffold for tissue growth [12] . The collagen gels allow establishment of mammary-like tissue with ductile structures from mammary cells. These cultures show sustained growth for several weeks and closely resemble the corresponding tissue in vivo [12] . Taken together, the early advances allowed the maintenance of tissue explants and de novo assembly of 3D tissues, while retaining their normal shape and special associations [2] .\n\nTo improve the 3D tissue culture systems, bioreactors were introduced. Bioreactors are commonly used to produce pharmaceutical proteins such as interferon, growth hormones, and insulin molecules and to allow the maintenance of stable growth conditions over a long time period. In addition, bioreactors can provide defined culture conditions at exact time points, which is often required for the assembly and differentiation of 3D structures. Basic steps involved in construction of 3D tissue structures include tissue assembly, growth, formation of extracellular matrix (ECM) and basement membranes. Cell differentiation is associated with cellular specialization and vascular (or pseudo-vasculature) formation and is required for the establishment of an ex vivo tissue comparable to their in vivo counterparts ( Fig. 1) . To achieve this, each 3D tissue structure must be optimized for the following parameters (i) co-location of particles (tissues) of different sedimentation rates, (ii) threedimensional spacial freedom that maximizes cell-to-cell and cell-to-microcarrier adherence required for assembly of the complex tissues, (iii) extremely low fluid shear stress and turbulence and (iv) oxygenation by active or passive diffusion with the exclusion of all air bubbles and permitting only dissolved gasses to enter/exit the bioreactor chamber thereby yielding a vessel devoid gas/fluid interface (zero headspace) [13, 14] . Standard vertically oriented bioreactors allow minimal assembly of complex functional mammalian tissues; however, the normal fluid mechanical effects in these systems often leads to excessive shear forces, turbulence and in many cases, inadequate oxygenation and nutrient transfer that cause cell death and pose critical barriers to the establishment of the functional 3D culture systems (Fig 1) .\n\nTo overcome these problems, NASA engineers and scientists developed the integrated rotating-wall vessel (RWV; US patent 5,026,650; Fig. 2A and B) that allows establishment of 3D tissues on microcarriers or other matrices under near neutral buoyancy, controlled oxygenation, low shear stress and minimal turbulence [13, 15, 16] . The microcarriers serve as structural support for assembly and growth of 3D tissues [17] . Cells efficiently form beadto-bead or matrix-to-matrix bridges in the RWV bioreactor at low agitation rates [18] , typically resulting in aggregates of approximately 12-15 microcarrier beads. The RWV system eliminates excessive agitation from stirring (vertical bioreactors) and minimizes other shear forces that damage the microcarrier 3D tissues [19, 20] . RVW systems are available in various commercially available volumes and can be scaled up to 1 liter.\n\nOne advantage of the RVW system is the high reproducibility and efficiency of establishing 3D tissue-like assemblies (TLAs) with characteristics of human tissues. Numerous publications confirm the similarity of structural organization and biomarker expression on the surface of the TLAs with their in vivo counterparts [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . For example, we selected both DNA (VZV) and RNA (RSV, PIV3 and SARS-CoV) viruses to infect neuronal or respiratory TLAs, respectively, that were shown by transcript and protein analysis to reflect their physiological counterparts [26] [27] [28] [29] . The unique feature of the RWV system maintains cell viability of the virus-infected TLA tissues for longer time periods than their 2D-tissue culture counterparts. Importantly, high-titer, cell free virus (1\u00d710 5 -10 7 /ml; Hepatitis C, 1\u00d710 5 -10 7; RSV; and 1\u00d710 7 /ml, PIV3 5\u00d710 6 ) [25, 28, 30, 31] can be obtained from the supernatants of infected TLAs. Cytopathic effects (CPE) were detected in TLAs infected with SARS and RSV; however, this CPE did not impair the ability of the RWV cultures to replicate. In the case of VZV we succeeded in our objective to construct and infect neuronal TLAs with the virus that remained viable for months during which time the virus/host interaction was monitored [27] . Here we describe the establishment of neuronal and lung (TLAs) in the RWV system that can be infected with various viruses.\n\nRWV bioreactors are available as batch fed or continuous flow, and allow tissue growth under 3D conditions in an optimized fluid suspension environment. The system is based on a rotating cylinder completely filled with fluid. Shortly after the cylinder begins to rotate, the fluid in the cylinder becomes coupled to the wall and rotates at the same speed as the vessel and TLAs rotate at the same speed (angular velocity) as their supporting fluid. Since TLAs have a slightly higher density than the fluid, they become suspended without stirring and with extremely low shear (0.15 dynes/cm 2 ). Oxygenation is achieved by passive diffusion to avoid gas bubbles and associated shear forces [14] . 3D cultures in the RWV system ( Fig. 2 ) require the following equipment, materials, media and supplies.\n\nRequired-Inverted microscope, hemacytometer Reichert, tissue culture incubator with sufficient air flow to dissipate heat (e.g. ThermoForma Model 3950) 1 , laminar flow hood, fume hood; autoclave; bench top 4\u00b0 refrigerated centrifuge, iStat handheld blood gas analyzer 2 , RWV bioreactor and power supply, model number RCCS1, Synthecon 3 , Milli-Q water system 4 , 50-micron polyester mesh, no. 7-51/36 5 \n\nT-75 (Corning 430641U)*, T-150 (Corning, 430824)* and T-225 (Nunc-159933)* culture flasks 1 ; 50-ml (14-375-150)* and 15-ml (S50712)*, polypropylene, sterile, Fisherbrand conical tubes 1 , Fisherbrand 1, 2, 5, 10, 25 and 50ml, sterile, single pack serological pipettes 1 ; Corning 9 1L disposable Filter units, (431096) 1 *; Fisherbrand disposable borosilicate Glass 9-in. disposable pipettes, (1367820C) 1 *; Pyrex Glass 6-liter beaker, (4980-6L) 1 ; 1 (309628), 3 (309657), 5 (309646), and 10 ml (NC9590365), single, sterile, luer lock syringes (Becton-Dickinson) 1 ; #10 Feather Disposable Scalpel (NC9999403, Feather) 1 ; Pyrex 50ml reusable glass jars with polypropylene caps, autoclavable (139550, Corning) 1 *, alcohol prep pads no. 0110 10 , Cytodex-3 (C3275) or Cultispher G standard porosity (M9418) microcarriers 11 *.\n\nWe developed a unique media for all cultures and tissue engineering described in this article termed GTSF-2 [32] (patented) that is commercially available at GE Healthcare LifeScience 12 . It consists of 40% MEM (Alpha Mod), 60% L-15 Leibovitz Medium, with HEPES (SH3A099 12 ) supplemented with NaHCO 3 1.35 g/liter Sigma/S-5761 11 , HEPES 3.0 g/liter Research Organics/6003H-2 13 , Folic acid 6.667 \u03bcg/liter Sigma/F-8758 13 , 0.5% Nicotinic acid 0.667 ml/liter Sigma/N-4126 11 , Bactopeptone 0.6 g/liter Difco/0118-01 1 , ilnositol 0.024 g/liter Sigma/l-5125 11 , Fructose 0.1 3 g/liter Sigma/F-3510 11 , Galactose 0.25 g/liter Sigma/G-5388 13 , D-Glucose 0.25 g/liter Sigma 11 , 300 mM L-Glutamine 10 ml/liter Sigma/G-5763 11 , 10 ml/liter penicillin-streptomycin, no. 15140-122 Gibco/life technologies 14 , ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA 1 ), Fungizone 2 ml/liter 15290-018 Gibco/Life Technologies, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA 1 , Insulin-transferrinsodium-selenite 5 ml/liter Sigma/l-1884 11 and 7-10% fetal bovine serum Hyclone 12 \n\nPrimary cells and stable cell lines were used to establish various 3D tissues as shown in Table 1 [15, 17, 21, 22, 27] . Human lung TLAs were established using primary human bronchio-tracheal cells (HBTCs) 18 (Cambrex BioWittaker, San Diego, CA) and BEAS-2B cells, an SV-40 transformed human bronchial epithelial cell line from ATCC 19 (Rockville, Md). Cells were propagated in GTSF-2 media as described previously [15] . For the establishment of human neuronal TLAs, we used normal human neural progenitor (NHNP) cells (Lonza 20 ; Walkersville, MD, USA). NHNPs from multiple donors were initially propagated in GTSF-2 on human fibronectin-coated flasks 21 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and pooled from at least five donors as described previously [32] (US patent 5,846,807 and 5,858,783). Stock cultures were prepared, tested for viral contaminants as described by the manufacturer and stored in liquid nitrogen. All cells and viruses used to infect RWV 3D tissues were either generated by us (VZV) [27, 33, 34] or obtained through ATCC Rockville Md 19 (SARS-CoV, RSV and PIV3).\n\nMicrocarriers are prepared two days before initiation of an RWV experiment. Prepare four 50-ml autoclavable corning tubes with a 20 mg/ml stock suspension of Cytodex-3 11 or 3 mg/ml Cultispher 11 microcarriers for each bioreactor. Steps 3 to 7 are performed in a laminar flow hood to avoid contamination.\n\nFill RWV completely with growth media.\n\nRemove air bubbles in the RWV by gentle tilting to push bubbles beneath syringe ports and use empty syringe to pull bubbles out.\n\nOnce bubbles are removed, apply slight head pressure to RWV using syringe with media to restore the culture volume.\n\nOnce slight head pressure achieved, close both syringe ports and thoroughly examine if RWV assembly has any leaks. Transfer vessel from laminar flow hood to humidified CO 2 incubator and screw onto base. Set initial rotation speed to 18-20 rpm. Check again after one hour for appropriate rotation speed, potential leaks and lack of bubbles.\n\nMonitor vessel metabolism every 24 h using the iStat handheld blood gas analyzer 2 according to the manufacturer's instructions. The following 13 basic physiological parameters were analyzed: glucose concentration, Cl/Na/K ion concentrations, pH, partial pressure of CO 2 (PCO 2 ), bicarbonate concentration (HCO 3 ), total CO 2 (TCO 2 ) anion gap, base excess, hematocrit (Hct), haemoglobin (Hgb), blood urea nitrogen (BUN). These metabolic levels should be stably maintained at physiologic levels.\n\nHBTCs were injected at a density of 2.5 \u00d7 10 5 /ml in 1.0 ml along with 3 mg/ml Cultispher G microcarriers, into a 55.0 ml NASA RWV bioreactor and allowed to attach and assemble for 48 hours at 18-20 rpm. The Cultispher G beads functioned as support matrix for the attachment of the HBTCs, which provide a mesenchymal and endothelial cell (basal cell layer). At 48-72 h post HBTCs inoculation, 3.5 \u00d7 10 5 BEAS-2B cells were added to the RWVs. The BEAS-2B cells adhered to the existing bead-cell matrix and the co-culture continuously develops until the TLAs reach a size of 3-5 mm. Cultures were then ready for infection with either SARS-CoV [29] , human parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV3), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [21, 22, 26, 28] .\n\n3D NHNP TLAs were generated by seeding 3.5 \u00d7 10 5 NHNP cells/ml and 3 mg/ml Cultispher 11 beads into a 55 ml RWV and grown at 37\u00b0C under a 5% CO 2 . Cells were allowed to attach to the beads for 48 h in the bioreactor before re-feeding with GTSF-2 containing 10% FBS. To maintain the TLA cultures within normal human physiological blood chemistry parameters (80-120 mg/dL glucose and pH 7.2), 20-90% of the media was replaced as required with fresh GTSF-2 media every 24-48 h, thus facilitating efficient TLA tissue growth. All metabolic determinations were made using an iStat analyzer as described above.\n\nTurn power off. Remove vessel from base and place in laminar flow hood. Stand vessel on the threaded end to allow all cell/bead aggregates to settle at the bottom.\n\nRemove empty syringe, and discard. Wipe ports with sterile alcohol pads.\n\nRemove fill cap and place in a sterile dish. Aspirate medium through fill port with sterile Pasteur pipette without disturbing the settled microcarriers/cells. Aspirate air bubbles from syringe ports without breaking the tip of the pipette.\n\nFill vessel with growth medium using sterile pipette. It is important to fill vessel slowly that the cell/bead aggregates are not disturbed. This is accomplished by allowing the medium to flow down wall of vessel.\n\nWipe fill ports with sterile alcohol pads and replace fill cap.\n\nFill 20-ml sterile syringe with growth medium and attach to one syringe port. Attach 5-or 10-ml sterile syringe to other syringe port.\n\nGently rock RWV to expel air bubbles that are often present at the sample ports. Maneuver air bubbles under empty syringe. With valves open, gently press on syringes to replace air bubbles with medium.\n\nWhen all bubbles are expelled, apply slight head pressure, close syringe valves. Discard one syringe, wipe port with alcohol pad and replace protective cap. The second syringe filled with growth media remains in the other port to compensate for evaporation through the oxygenator.\n\nScrew vessel onto rotating base and turn power on. Rotation speed must be increased for increasing cell/bead aggregate sizes. Check rotation speed and adjust as necessary.\n\nTurn off the power to stop vessel rotation. Remove syringe port cap and place in sterile petri plate. Attach either a 10-ml sterile syringe to the Luer lock sample valve and open syringe port valve. The vessel can remain in the incubator for this procedure.\n\nTurn power on and allow vessel to rotate until cell/bead aggregates are evenly distributed (approximately 2 min). Gently press on compliant syringe originally placed on vessel at time of inoculation and pull on empty sample syringe to remove sample (two syringes). This step must be done while vessel is rotating to prevent sedimentation of the TLAs during sampling; therefore, care must be taken to prevent syringes from detaching from the vessel.\n\nWhen desired volume of sample has been removed and replaced with equal volume of fresh medium from compliance syringe, turn off power. Close valve on sampling syringe port and remove sampling syringe. Repeat this step if multiple samples are required.\n\nReplace Lure lock cap and turn on rotator power. Note: we routinely take samples every 24 to 48 h and analyze them by light microscopy, RT-PCR, proteomics (Luminex), SEM or ESEM. In addition, cells can be dissociated from microcarriers to determine viability and concentration.\n\nTLA Culture Monitoring procedure 3D TLA cultures are monitored daily using the iStat as described above.\n\nAll virus cultures in this article were prepared by a similar protocol. Cell-free virus SARS-CoV, RSV, PIV3 and VZV [27, 35, 36] \n\nTLA constructs in the RWV were infected with cell-free virus. Multiplicities of infection (MOI) varied for each virus from 0.01 (RSV, PIV3 and SARS) to 0.1 (VZV) determined by plaque assay and cell counts [26] [27] [28] [29] 34 ].\n\nFor the inoculation, follow the protocol outlined in section 4.3. At step 4.3.4 the inoculum is injected into the bioreactor before replacing the removed volume with fresh media.\n\nusing a hole punch. Cut 50-micron polyester mesh in 4 cm 2 squares (two squares per capsule). Attach a punched cap on one end and cover the other with a piece of the mesh.\n\nTo prepare for scanning place the SEM-fixed sample at room temperature in 0.1 M cacodylic buffer and put sample inside modified BEEM capsule.\n\nCover the end of capsule and attach hole punched cap. Repeat for all samples. Place capsules in 50-ml tube. Add 10 ml of OsO4 solution to each tube and allow to fix for 45 to 60 min. Swirling tube intermittently to move the solution. Cover with foil to protect from light. Rinse sample very well with deionized water.\n\nNext add 10-ml filtered 1.0% TCH solution to sample tubes and as before swirl tube and allow to fix for 10 min. Again, protect from light. Then rinse 5x times for 5 min each with deionized H2O.\n\nFix samples again for 10 min by adding 10 ml of Os04 solution while protecting from light and rinse 4x for 5 min each with deionized H2O\n\nPerform sequential dehydration using increasing concentrations of ethanol as follows: 20% for 5 min, 50% for 5 min, 75% for 5 min, 95% for 5 min, 100% 2x 5 min. Samples are ready for dehydration with hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) or critical-point drying. Fig. 4) \n\nAliquot desired cell sample volume and add an equal volume of 2X ESEM fix for a final 1X concentration (2% gluteraldehyde/3% formaldehyde final concentration). 2X ESEM Fix 4% gluteraldehyde, 6% formaldehyde prepared in filter/sterilized PBS pH 7.4\n\nFix samples for a minimum of 30 min at room temperature or leave in fix at 4\u00b0C overnight.\n\nFor large cell aggregates transfer several aggregates to a new tube and fill tube with filter/sterilized Milli-Q; allow cells to settle to the bottom and remove supernatant. For single cell/bead samples or very small aggregates skip to step 6.\n\nRepeat step 3, 3-4 times to remove any fixative. Ensure that all fixative/buffer is removed to avoid crystal formation during sample drying as this will interfere with the imaging).\n\nLoad aggregates on to a T-stub with a silicon wafer chip sitting on double-sided carbon tape. Sample can immediately be loaded into the ESEM chamber for image analysis.\n\nLoad 50-75\u03bcl cell suspension at a concentration of 2 x106 cells/ml onto a 2\u03bcm TSTP filter paper loaded into a filter unit and rinse with 1 ml of 1x PBS (at least the sample volume) to allow for even dispersal of sample.\n\nRinse with 1 ml of 0.2\u03bcm filtered Milli-Q to remove 1x PBS crystals before dehydration.\n\nDehydrate samples with increasing dilutions of Ethanol (25%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% and 100%) by running 0.5 to 1ml of each dilution into the filter housing unit and allowing it to filter by gravity at room temperature. Note: prepare fresh ethanol solutions using absolute ethyl alcohol and Milli-Q water, filter sterilized.\n\nDehydration: Steps: Dehydrate samples sequentially with 25% 2 times, 30 min each, then 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100% ethanol, 2 times, 10 min each.\n\nPlace double-sided carbon tape on stub. Remove filter from housing and place sample side up on carbon tape.\n\nAir dry (or place in ESEM chamber to dry).\n\nOptional: Sputter coat with Platinum (recommend 2nm coating) for best results in viewing small structures Figure 4 . Fig. 5 17 and allow to stand overnight at 4\u00b0C.\n\nThe fixed tissue was washed 3X in buffer, and then post-fixed stained in 0.3 M tannic acid in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate pH 7.4 for 3 hours at room temperature.\n\nThere after TLAs were washed 3X in buffer, and fixed again in 1.0 M OsO4 for 1.5 hours at room temperature. Samples were dehydrated in a series of graded ETOH baths (as outlined previously), and then embedded in Spurs resin.\n\nSamples were sectioned at silver-gray 6 (100 -300 \u03bcm), mounted on Ni grids, and examined using a JEOL-JEM 1010 transmission electron microscope (JEOL, USA) at 80 kV Figure 5.\n\nSeed appropriate number of MeWo (VZV) or Vero cells (SARS, RSV, and PIV3) into 6-wells and allow them to adhere overnight.\n\nInoculate MeWo or Vero cells with 10-fold dilutions of supernatant from virus infected TLAs at various times post infection.\n\nAllow the virus to adsorb for 1-2 h at 37\u00b0C.\n\nAspirate the supernatant and add fresh culture media (GTSF-2 or 1x MEM supplemented with 10 % FBS)\n\nIncubate at 37\u00b0C for 3-4 days until CPE is visible.\n\nIf fluorescent virus were use, analyze the plaques by fluorescent microscopy. Otherwise continue.\n\nFix cells with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS and incubate for 15 min.\n\nWash cells 3x with PBS.\n\nAdd pathogen specific antibodies and incubate for 30-60 min.\n\nWash cells 3x with PBS.\n\nAdd fluorescently labelled secondary antibodies and incubate for 30-60 min.\n\nAnalyze the plaques by fluorescent microscopy.\n\nThe TLA models for human lung and neuronal tissues using RWV bioreactors provide a very versatile tool. The tissues can be maintained for several months and allow the infection with a number of viruses. Both DNA (VZV) and RNA (SARS-CoV, PIV3 and RSV) viruses have been used to infect these systems to analyze infection in a more physiological setting [26] [27] [28] [29] . We recently demonstrated that VZV can establish a persistent infection in these NHNP TLAs, which can be maintained for at least 3 months [27] . This system will provide the basis for future studies to decipher the establishment of VZV latency and reactivation. The use of genetically modified NHNP cells would provide a suitable system to address the cellular factors that influence VZV latency. Similarly, neuronal TLAs could be used as a system to study other neurotropic viruses such as herpes simplex (HSV), Dengue and West Nile viruses. Similarly, lung TLAs can be infected with SARS for up to 10 days proving a system that more closely resembles the infection in vivo. Intriguingly, TLAs can be seeded with various immune cells [23, 37] , allowing analyses of virus infection in the presence of defined components of the immune system. Furthermore, production of live attenuated VZV vaccines is difficult due to the highly cell-associated nature of the virus. However, the virus is cell-free in the skin lesions of chicken pox. Engineering skin TLA may provide the cell system required to generation of high-titer, cell free attenuated virus for vaccine production.\n\nThe five stages of the assembly and development of tissue-like structures are shown. Each of these stages has been achieved in the RWV systems. The pseudo-vascularization of the TLAs is very hard to achieve [26] . Goodwin "}
