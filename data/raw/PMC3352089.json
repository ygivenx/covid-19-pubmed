{"title": "Interleukin-2 signalling is modulated by a labile disulfide bond in\nthe CD132 chain of its receptor", "body": "Disulfide bonds are important in maintaining the structure of extracellular and\nsecreted proteins, but it is now apparent that some disulfide bonds are labile and\ntheir reduction leads to functional changes [1,2].\nThe uptake of some viruses such as HIV [3], Newcastle disease virus [4] and hepatitis C virus [5] is redox-dependent. Platelet activation is associated with\nredox-induced changes at the cell surface [6,7]. Disulfide bonds in\nthe \u03b22 integrins and \u03b1IIb\u03b23 integrin maintain their low\naffinity state, and thrombus formation is controlled by the redox state of disulfide\nbonds in the beta chain of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 [8,9].\nThe affinity of integrins on other cell types can also be modulated by reducing\nagents [10]. For example, the\n\u03b14 chain integrin \u03b14\u03b21 was shown to have free sulfydryl groups\non treatment of cells with reducing agents [10,11]. The powerful anti-microbial activity of human \u03b2-defensin-1\nis revealed after reduction of disulfide bonds [12]. IL-4 has been shown to contain a disulfide bond\nsusceptible to mild reduction [13].\nSome ligands for cell surface receptors are also redox sensitive (e.g. MICA) [14]. Immunization increases the\nnumber of free thiols in lymph nodes [15]. Activation of T cells by dendritic cells leads to secretion of\nthioredoxin (TRX) into the extracellular space [16], where it can catalyse reduction of disulfide\nbonds on the surface of cells with which it comes into contact. This activation and\nTRX secretion can be limited by the addition of regulatory T cells [17,18]. In a model of arthritis, disease susceptibility\nwas shown to correlate with the level of free thiols at the surface of T cells, and\nthis was dependent on intracellular reactive oxygen levels [19], suggesting a role for redox chemistry in\nautoimmunity. Combined, these data suggest a central role for redox chemistry at the\ncell surface in controlling the levels of the immune response to antigen.\n\nWe have recently developed a proteomics-based technique to determine the membrane\nproteins of leucocytes that have labile disulfides using mild reducing conditions\nsuch as dilute tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), and enzymes such as TRX, gamma\ninterferon-inducible lysosomal thiolreductase (GILT) and protein disulfide isomerase\n(PDI) that are commonly secreted during immune activation [20,21]. After reduction, the proteins with labile disulfide bonds were\nlabelled with maleimide-PEO2-biotin (MPB). This enabled these proteins to\nbe purified by avidin affinity chromatography and, following digestion with trypsin,\nto be identified by mass spectrometry. Leucocyte membrane proteins with labile\ndisulfide bonds were surprisingly common and included various classes of proteins\nsuch as integrins, transporters and adhesion proteins, suggesting the activity of\nmany proteins may be modulated by redox changes during immune responses [20]. One protein identified in these\nscreens was CD132, which is the common signalling component (\u03b3c)\nof the receptors for several cytokines, namely IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15 and\nIL-21 [22]. IL-2 plays a central\nrole in T cell activation and regulation [23\u201325], and we\nnow show that reduction of this disulfide in the CD132 chain of its receptor has a\nmarked effect on IL-2 signalling. This suggests that responsiveness to IL-2 (and\npossibly other cytokines) may be modulated by changes in the redox environment that\noccur during immune responses.\n\nThe CD132 chain was identified as containing a redox-labile disulfide bond\n(Cys183\u2013Cys232) in screens of T cells treated\nwith the chemical reductant TCEP and three enzymatic reductants (TRX, GILT and\nPDI), and also in spleen cells from mice treated with LPS in a short-term model\nof inflammation [20]. The\npeptides identified by mass spectrometry are summarized in table 1. The three enzymatic\nreductants gave similar peptide coverage, which was higher than seen by TCEP\nreduction, an observation seen for other proteins in the global screen [20]. One Cys residue in CD132 was\nidentified as an MPB-labelled peptide with the sequence C*LQYLVQYR (table 1; the asterisk indicates\nthe modified Cys residue), the MS/MS spectrum for this peptide obtained after\nPDI reduction (similar spectra were obtained for the other reducing agents) is\nshown in figure\n1a. This indicates that this Cys (residue 183)\noriginated from a disulfide bond that was reduced by the mild reducing\nconditions described above and previously [20]. A peptide containing Cys232, the\nother residue that makes up this disulfide bond, was not detected with an MPB\nlabel. However, it was detected in an unmodified carboimidomethyl form. The\nprotein sequence of mCD132 and identified peptides are shown in figure 1b. The MPB\nlabel reduces the ionization efficiency of the peptide compared with unlabelled\ncarboimidomethyl Cys (C. Metcalfe 2011, unpublished data) containing peptides,\nthus it is possible that the Cys232-containing peptide was\nundetectable under the conditions employed in the study. Under TRX- and\nGILT-reducing conditions, the C*LQYLVQYR peptide was detected with both\nMPB and carbamidomethyl modifications, indicating that modification of both Cys\nresidues of the labile disulfide bond was not 100 per cent efficient. In the\nin vivo, LPS inflammation model CD132 was detected although\nno MPB modified peptide was detected in CD132 or indeed any other protein [20]. This is due to the\ncomplexity of the sample. Peptides originate from proteins of many different\ncell types and therefore will be present at levels at the limit of detection of\nour mass spectrometry system. Only a small percentage of these peptides will be\nlabelled with MPB and are therefore unlikely to be identified on probability\ngrounds. \n\n\nThe structure of the CD132 ectodomain has been determined in complexes of both\nthe human IL-2 and IL-4 receptors with IL-2 and IL-4, respectively (reviewed by\nLaPorte et al. [26]). CD132 contains two fibronectin type III domains. The peptide\ncontaining the MBP modified Cys identified in mouse CD132 (see above)\ncorresponds to Cys160 that forms a disulfide bond with\nCys209 in these structures for human CD132 (figure 2). This domain type has a fold similar to\nan Ig-like domain consisting of two beta sheets but it usually lacks disulfide\nbonds in the typical Ig inter-sheet position. However, in some cases disulfide\nbonds are present, such as the Cys160\u2013Cys209\ndisulfide of CD132. This disulfide bond is unusual in that it is at the surface\nof the protein (figure\n2a) with a large solvent accessibility area of 56\n\u00c52 (compared with a structure average of 19\n\u00c52) when calculated in the absence of IL-2, which is\npresumably the state under which redox regulation would occur. This\nCys160\u2013Cys209 disulfide bond is relatively\nshort, with a C\u03b1\u2013C\u03b1 of 5.3 \u00c5 compared with an\naverage of 5.9 \u00c5 for the other disulfide bonds present in the IL-2 and\nIL-4 receptor structures. These features are compatible with the possibility\nthat this disulfide bond might be readily reduced. A recent bioinformatics study\nthat analysed all of the disulfide bonds in the protein data bank based on\nsolvent accessibility, C\u03b1\u2013C\u03b1 distance and an estimation of\ntorsion strain on the S\u2013S bonds [1,2] concluded that\nthe most common configuration of the known allosteric disulfide bonds is the\n\u2013RHStaple. A feature of \u2013RHStaple bonds is the close proximity of\nthe \u03b1-carbon atoms of the two cysteine residues [27,28]. In both of these structures, the\nCys160\u2013Cys209 disulfide bond sits at the\ninterface of CD132, linking two beta loops as shown in figure 2c with the cytokine in\ndirect contact with the helix bundle. The possibility that mild reducing\nconditions typical of those found in T cell activation might reduce this\ndisulfide bond enough to affect the ability of IL-2 to bind and signal through\nthe receptor was investigated. \n\nSome T cell lines are dependent on IL-2 for growth and are widely used as\nbioassays for IL-2. From the above, we predict that the growth of such a line\nwould be inhibited by mild reducing conditions by affecting the ability of CD132\nto signal in response to IL-2. One commonly used line is the T helper clone HT-2\ncell line that had been derived from mouse Balb/c spleen cells stimulated with\nsheep erythrocytes and grown in IL-2 [29]. This line was treated with TCEP and its effects on\nproliferation were determined by incorporation of 3H-thymidine.\nProliferation was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations of TCEP\ncomparable to those used to reduce the labile disulfide bond in CD132 (figure 3a).\nWashing the TCEP from the cells gave recovery of proliferation to approximately\n80 per cent of control levels indicating that inhibition was reversible on a\ntimescale of hours and TCEP caused no significant permanent toxicity to the cell\nline. In contrast, the same reducing conditions had no effect on the\nproliferation of the 2B4 hybridoma T cell line that is not dependent on\nexogenous IL-2 for proliferation, but still expresses CD132 (figure 3b). \n\nIn order to mimic physiological conditions more closely than TCEP, the effects of\nTRX were tested. TRX is an enzyme that reduces disulfide bonds to the free\nsulfydryls and is known to be produced by dendritic cells and required for T\ncell activation [16]. TRX (in\nthe presence of trace levels of 5 \u03bcM dithiothreitol, DTT, as an electron\ndonor) gave similar inhibition of the HT-2 cells as TCEP (figure 3c). The TRX had no effect\non proliferation of the 2B4 cell line. These results are consistent with\nprevious data showing mutation of this disulfide bond in CD132 inhibits IL-2\nbinding and signalling [30]. In\ncombination, these results show the Cys160\u2013Cys209\ndisulfide bond is redox-labile and that CD132-dependent cytokine binding can be\naffected by changes in redox potential at the cell surface.\n\nReduction of the cytokine IL-4 by exogenous reducing agents has been shown to\ninhibit its ability to bind to the IL-4 receptor complex and inhibits\nproliferation of an IL-4-dependent cell line [13]. A similar reduction of IL-2 could account\nfor, or at least contribute to, the effects seen on the HT-2 cell line. To test\nthis, recombinant rat IL-2 was incubated under the same reducing conditions\nknown to give extensive inhibition of HT-2 cell proliferation. N-ethylmaleimide\n(NEM) was added to modify any free sulfydryl residues generated. The IL-2\nprotein was denatured with urea, fully reduced with TCEP and alkylated with\niodoacetamide (IAA). The protein was digested with trypsin and peptides analysed\nby mass spectrometry. The Cys-containing peptides were analysed for differential\nlabelling with the two thiol-reactive agents using a simple semi-quantitative\nanalysis based on the total ion counts of the peptides' precursor scan\npeaks. This showed that for the FECQFDDEPATVVEFLR peptide less than 1 per cent\ncontained the NEM-modified Cys compared with the IAA-modified Cys (non-reduced\nin the native protein) and for the HLQCLENELGALQR peptide about 28 per cent was\nin the NEM-modified form (table\n2). These data were almost identical to a control that had not been\nreduced. The NEM modification observed was probably due to some denatured\nprotein in the IL-2 preparation. This indicates that the disulfide bond in IL-2\nwas not labile. IL-2 and IL-4 contain one and three disulfide bonds,\nrespectively, and these disulfide bonds are conserved across several species.\nX-ray crystal structures are not available for rat or mouse IL-2 or IL-4, but\nhuman structures are available for both (figure 4). The tertiary structures of human IL-2 and IL-4 are very\nsimilar (figure\n4a), with good overlay of the 4-helix bundle. Both\nstructures contain a disulfide bond between the second helix of the bundle and\nan external loop (figure\n4b,c). IL-4 contains two further\ndisulfide bonds (figure\n4b) and IL-2 contains a conserved\n\u2018free\u2019 cysteine buried inside of the 4-helix bundle (figure 4c). Figure 4d\nshows the calculated solvent accessibility for all of the disulfide bonds in\nIL-2 and IL-4. The Cys59\u2013Cys105 disulfide bond in\nIL-2 is buried, as are the Cys24\u2013Cys65 and\nCys46\u2013Cys99 disulfide bonds in IL-4. However,\nthe Cys3\u2013Cys127 disulfide bond in IL-4 is highly\nsolvent exposed and is likely to be the one that is redox-labile in the previous\nstudy [13]. \n\n\nPre-reduced and alkylated recombinant rat IL-2 was just as effective as normal\nIL-2 in controlling the proliferation of the HT-2 IL-2-dependent cell line\n(figure 3d).\nTherefore, there is no evidence that the effect of reducing agent on the\nIL-2-dependent cell line is due to effects on the IL-2 itself.\n\nCytokine receptors using CD132 signal through Jak\u2013STAT pathways. In the\ncase of IL-2 signalling, binding of IL-2 to the surface receptor complex\ninitiates the recruitment of Jak-3, which phosphorylates STAT-5, resulting in\nits dimerization and translocation to the nucleus to initiate gene transcription\n[32]. The level of tyrosine\nphosphorylation of STAT-5 is therefore a direct readout for the presence of a\nfunctional IL-2 receptor complex. In order to test the hypothesis that reduction\nof CD132 inhibits the ability of the IL-2 receptor complex to bind IL-2 and\nsignal through CD132, we measured levels of tyrosine phosphorylation in STAT-5\n(figure 5a;\nquantitation in figure\n5b). IL-2-dependent HT-2 cells were starved of IL-2\nfor 18 h to give a background level of STAT-5 tyrosine phosphorylation. The\ncells were reduced using identical conditions to those used to identify the\nlabile disulfide and then either treated with IL-2 for 30 min or first alkylated\nwith NEM and then treated with IL-2 for 30 min. A third sample of cells was\ntreated with IL-2 without prior reduction and alkylation. Cells treated with\nIL-2 alone resulted in an increased level of tyrosine phosphorylation in STAT-5.\nHowever, cells treated with IL-2 after reduction or reduction and NEM alkylation\nshowed STAT-5 tyrosine phosphorylation levels comparable to the control. This\nshows that conditions known to reduce the labile disulfide bond in CD132\ndirectly inhibit cytokine signalling through the IL-2 receptor complex.\nFurthermore, the finding that inhibition occurred with or without NEM alkylation\nof the free cysteines shows that this disulfide does not reform and restore\nactivity once reduced. \n\nTo test whether the decrease in STAT-5 tyrosine phosphorylation after reduction\nof CD132 is a pathway-specific process and that the reducing agent is not\ninhibiting all tyrosine phosphorylation in the cell, lysates from non-reduced\nand reduced HT-2 cells were Western blotted with an anti-phosphotyrosine\nantibody (figure\n5c). This showed there was no significant decrease\nin global phosphorylation upon reduction, and that inhibition of phosphorylation\nof tyrosines in STAT-5 and cell proliferation is pathway-specific through\nCD132.\n\nCD132 was identified as having a labile disulfide bond in screens to determine the\nmolecular modification of membrane proteins that occurred during inflammation, where\nit is known that there are changes in the extracellular redox environment both in\nterms of the secretion of enzymes that can modify disulfide bonds and the overall\nredox potential [20]. The specific\ndisulfide in CD132 was identified using a variety of mild reducing agents including\nPDI, TRX and GILT. CD132 was also one of many proteins identified in a model of\ninflammation. The detailed structural knowledge of CD132 in structures of the\nreceptors and their complexes with IL-2 and IL-4 allows the molecular consequences\nto be examined [24,26,33]. The Cys183\u2013Cys232\nof CD132 that we identify as labile is solvent exposed in the equivalent structure\nfor the human proteins at the interface of CD132 and IL-2 or IL-4. This disulfide\nbond bridges two loops in domain 1 of CD132. As described by Wang et\nal., \u2018this disulfide bond fixes the bent conformation of loop\nFG2, where the main chain atoms from residues Ser-207 to Pro-211 directly contact\nthe methylene side chain of residue Gln-126 in IL-2 or Arg-121 in IL-4\u2019 (page\n48 of [22]). Thus, reduction of\nthis disulfide probably imparts added flexibility into the loops affecting IL-2 and\nIL-4 binding signalling (figure 2).\nMutation of these Cys residues severely disrupts IL-2 binding to CD132, as shown by\ncell surface binding of IL-2 to COS-7 cells transfected with CD132 mutants, and\nsurface plasmon resonance analysis on recombinant IL-2 and receptor chains [30,34]. Mutations in several residues at the\nCD132\u2013cytokine interface, including this\nCys160\u2013Cys209 pair, lead to X-linked severe\ncombined immunodeficiency syndrome (X-SCID) [24,35,36]. Our functional\ndata show that mild reduction inhibits proliferation of an IL-2-dependent T cell\nclone and the STAT-5 pathway. This complements analysis showing that mutation of\neither of the Cys residues involved in this disulfide bond inhibits IL-2 binding to\nits receptor.\n\nCD132 is part of the receptor for several other cytokines (IL-4, IL-21, IL-7, IL-9,\nIL-15) [32]. There are clear data\nfor the IL-4 receptor showing that the labile disulfide in CD132 is at the interface\nwith the cytokine, and it seems likely that the other cytokines bind in a similar\nway [22], with data indicating at\nleast some overlap between the sites on CD132 for IL-4 and IL-21 [37]. For IL-4, there is the added\ncomplication that IL-4 itself has a labile disulfide-affecting function [13]. Thus, the activity of several\ncytokine receptors may be affected by a \u2018redox regulator\u2019 resulting\nfrom changes in the redox potential and the availability of thiol-modifying enzymes\nsuch as PDI.\n\nThe changes in the redox environment are presumably transient. What happens when\nconditions return to normal? The effect of reduction of the receptor is reversible\nover a period of hours; this could either be due to the reduced disulfide bonds\nreforming after reducing conditions have been removed, or the cells could be turning\nover the receptor at the cell surface and replacing reduced CD132 with newly\nsynthesized non-reduced CD132. The finding that little spontaneous reforming of\nactive CD132 occurred over 30 min suggests little reformation of the disulfide bond\nand that receptor turnover is the primary cause of restoration of IL-2-dependent\ncell proliferation. Presumably, the Cys183\u2013Cys232\ndisulfide bond is formed during biosynthesis in the presence of chaperones and\nrestrains the loops.\n\nAs CD132 is common to a number of cytokine receptors, there may be a previously\nundiscovered mechanism controlling the levels of responses of cells to exogenous\ncytokines. These changes may also occur in other cytokine receptors. From these\ndata, we would predict that disulfides that are solvent-exposed and at the interface\nwith the cytokine may be affected by redox changes with functional effects. Exposed\ndisulfide bonds are not common in other cytokine receptors where there are\nstructural data; for example, none of the disulfides in the interleukin-28 receptor\nsubunit alpha (or interferon-lambda receptor 1; PDB; 3OG6) is exposed. The tumour\nnecrosis factor (TNF) receptor family members are characterized by a high content of\ndisulfide bonds, but in the TNF\u2013TNFR2 structure (PDB; 3ALQ) two Cys residues\nare in contact with the ligand (TNF), but their partners are solvent-inaccessible.\nHowever, there are data to show that TRX 1 can reduce disulfide bonds in the TNF\nreceptor family member CD30 giving altered cytokine binding [38]. This study showed that other TNF receptor family\nmembers were not modified, pointing to selected cytokine receptors being affected.\nThus, the activity of some cytokines may be moderated in immune responses by changes\nin redox potential modulated by the release of enzymes such as PDI. Therefore simple\nquantitation of the expression of a cytokine receptor may not be fully predictive of\nits ability to signal.\n\nThe labelling method and identification of proteins by mass spectrometry is given\nin detail by Metcalfe et al. [20]. In brief, 2B4 cells were treated with 2.5 mM\nMethyl-PEO12-maleimide (MPM) to block any free Cys residues,\nwashed and then incubated with the various reducing agents for 30 min at room\ntemperature. The cells were washed and reacted with 2.5 mM MPB, and left to\nrotate at 4\u00b0 for 30 min to biotinylate any free sulfydryls formed in the\nreduction step. After washing, the cells were lysed in 1 per cent Triton X-100\nwith 5 mM N-ethylmaleimide and membrane glycoproteins purified by lentil lectin\naffinity chromatography. The modified proteins were repurified using monomeric\navidin beads (Pierce Chemical Company, Rockford, IL) and the eluent was digested\nwith PNGase F and trypsin. The tryptic peptide samples were desalted on a C18\npacked pipette tip system and injected onto an Ultimate 3000 nano HPLC (Dionex)\nsystem coupled with Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron).\n\nLPS-induced inflammation was induced in a mouse as described [20]. One microgram of LPS (Sigma\nChemical Company, St Louis, MO) in PBS was given intraperitoneally to each adult\nBalb/c mouse and the spleen taken after 3 h. Control mice received PBS alone.\nThe spleen cells were teased out into RPMI containing 2.5 mM MBP and gently\nagitated at 4\u00b0C for 30 min. The cells were washed and processed as for\nthe cell lines.\n\nThe data were submitted to the in-house Central Proteomics Facilities Pipeline\n(CPFP) [39] and the datasets\nwere searched with variable peptide modifications including carbamidomethyl\ncysteine, oxidized methionine, deamidated asparagine/glutamine, and hydrolysed\nand non-hydrolysed versions of the appropriate cysteine-modifying label (NEM,\nMPM or MPB). The resulting peptide identifications from each search engine were\nvalidated with PeptideProphet and\nProteinProphet and lists compiled at the peptide and\nprotein level [40].\niProphet was used to combine the identifications from\nthree search engines and further refine identifications and probabilities [41]. Normalized spectral index\nquantitation (SINQ) was applied to the grouped meta-searches to give\nprotein-level quantitation between reduced samples and controls [42]. All lists of peptide and\nprotein identifications were generated with a probability cut-off corresponding\nto a 1 per cent false discovery rate (FDR) relative to a target decoy database.\nQuantitated datasets were uploaded to ProteinCenter (Proxion, Thermofisher) for\nanalysis. The dataset was reduced by removing single-peptide identifications and\nproteins of interest (cell surface, secreted and extracellular) were mined using\ngene ontology (GO) flags. Resultant protein and peptide lists were exported as\ntables.\n\nHT-2 cells (ATCC; code CRL-1841) were grown in the presence of IL-2 (approx. 100\nU ml\u22121 of recombinant rat IL-2 produced in house from a\nChinese hamster ovary cell expression system) and then starved of exogenous IL-2\nfor 18 h. Cells were either reduced with 2.5 mM TCEP or 0.5 \u03bcg\nml\u22121 TRX (with 5 \u03bcM DTT present) in PBS-containing\n1 per cent BSA and, if required, alkylated with 2.5 mM MPM for 30 min to\nalkylate any labile disulfides. A total of 1.5 \u00d7 104 cells per\nwell were incubated for 18 h with 3H-thymidine in RPMI containing 10\nper cent FCS and 2 per cent recombinant rat IL-2 supernatant. Cells were\nharvested onto filter mats that were saturated in scintillation fluid and\nradioactivity measured on a scintillation counter. Twelve identical wells were\ncounted for each condition and the experiments were carried out in\ntriplicate.\n\nRecombinant rat IL-2 (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) was reduced for 30 min with 2.5\nmM TCEP in PBS at room temperature. Any labile disulfide bonds formed were\nalkylated with 2.5 mM NEM in PBS for 30 min. After washing through a micro\nconcentrator (Millipore, YM-10), the IL-2 was denatured (8 M urea, 1 h), reduced\n(10 mM DTT, 37\u00b0C, 30 min) and alkylated (10 mM IAA, 1 h). The IL-2 was\nthoroughly washed with 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate and then subjected to trypsin\ndigest and mass spectrometry as described previously.\n\nHT-2 cells were grown in the presence of IL-2 and then starved of exogenous IL-2\nfor 18 h. A total of 5 \u00d7 105 cells were either reduced (2.5 mM\nTCEP for 30 min) or reduced and alkylated (2.5 mM TCEP + 2.5 mM MPM for\n30 min) and then treated with IL-2 (recombinant rat supernatant) for 30 min.\nControl samples (5 \u00d7 105 cells) were treated with IL-2 for 30\nmin without prior reduction and alkylation. Cells were then lysed in 1 per cent\nTriton-X100 in PBS and subjected to Western blot analysis with rabbit anti-mouse\nSTAT-5 (3H7, Cell Signaling Technology, Boston, MA) and rabbit anti-mouse\nphospho (Y694) STAT-5 (Cell Signaling Technology). Densitometry quantitation of\nthe STAT-5 and phosphoSTAT-5 bands was performed using ImageJ (NIH,\nUSA). All experiments were carried out in triplicate."}
