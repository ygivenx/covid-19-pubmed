{"title": "FEP-based screening prompts drug repositioning against COVID-19", "body": "The novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV (also known as HCoV-19 or SARS-CoV-2) outbreak had emerged from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019 1, 2 . On March 22, there were 813,00 confirmed COVID-19 cases including 3,253 deaths in China. This virus has also infected more than 220,000 patients in all of the continents and over 180 other countries, such as Italy, Spain, U.S.A, Germany, France, and Iran gradually became a global pandemic due to the very high risk of spread and impact of COVID-19. To date, there is no specific treatment or vaccine against COVID-19, thus it is urgently need to repositioning potential agents against COVID- 19. 3 The COVID-19's replicase gene encodes two over-lapping translation products, polyproteins 1a and 1ab (pp1a and pp1ab), which mediate all of the functions required for viral replication. Mpro, as the key enzyme in proteolytic processing of viral replication, is initially released by the auto-cleavage of pp1a and pp1ab. Then Mpro in turn cleaves pp1a and pp1ab to release functional proteins necessary for viral replication. 4 In the view of essential functions of Mpro in viral life cycle and its high conservatism, it is an attractive target for the discovery of anti-COVID-19 agents.\n\nGreat efforts from various research groups have been done to discover new agents from several databases by targeting the target Mpro via several virtual screening strategy, 5, 6 which consists of pharmacophore, molecule docking, and molecular simulations approaches. As a result, six drugs inhibited Mpro with IC50 values ranging from 0.67 to 21.4 \u03bcM. 5 These drug design methods contributed considerably to the lead discovery, but the computational accuracy and efficiency need to be improved especially when dealing with emergency situations such as the COVID-19 outbreak. Free energy perturbation (FEP) method is a promising method with satisfactory accuracy [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] , but their actual applications to drug design are still limited to simulate minor structural changes of the ligands, thus predicting the relative binding free energy (RBFE). 7, 14 In order to perform virtual screening of a large molecule database, the absolute binding free energy (ABFE) calculation must be performed for each ligand without using of a reference ligand structure. The FEP approach has an advantage in predicting the affinities more precisely between drugs and their targets than conventional methods, such as pharmacophore, molecule docking, and molecular simulations. However, the FEP-ABFE approaches are extremely expensive/time-consumpting and therefore not used for virtual screening purpose. 15, 16 To accelerate the discovery of Mpro inhibitors from the small molecule database to combat COVID-19, we represent a newly derived FEP-ABFE-accelerated screening strategy together with bioassay validation to rapidly reposition potential agents against COVID-19 by targeting viral proteinase Mpro.\n\nAs a result, fifteen of twenty-five drugs were validated in vitro to exhibit considerable inhibitory potencies towards Mpro. Among them, the most potent and representative Mpro inhibitor dipyridamole just finished its first-round clinical trials, and showed significant clinical outcomes. 17 In short, this is the first report to screen the FDA-approved database by using the FEP-ABFE approach, and this FEP-based method showed significant advantages by means of improving the hit rates and repositioning more potent leads.\n\nThe crystal structure of viral proteinase Mpro (PDB ID: 6LU7) 18 for COVID-19 was used for the molecule docking purpose. Based on the crystal structure, more than 2500 small molecules in the FDAapproved drug database were first screened by using molecular docking program Glide 19 . Considering Mpro being a protease, Cys145-His41/Ser144-His163 can act as the nucleophilic agent and acid that assist the hydrolysis reaction of the substrate proteins, and Gly143 and Gln166 can form hydrogen bonds with the \"CO-NH-C\u03b1-CO-NH-C\u03b1\" structure of the backbone of the substrate protein. Thus, these 6 residues were considered as the key residues of Mpro in the screening. After docking, the binding modes of all the ligands were carefully checked, and 100 molecules with specific interaction with the key residues and relatively high docking scores were selected for further FEP studies to evaluate their ABFE.\n\nAll the 100 ligands selected by molecular docking were further evaluated by FEP calculations carried out in Gromacs-2019 20, 21 . Before FEP calculations, 4 ns preliminary MD simulations were performed for each receptor-ligand complex to improve the fit of the ligand into the binding pocket. All the ligands are parameterized by the general AMBER force field (GAFF) 22 . Restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) charges calculation of relative ligand was performed with Gaussian 03 program 23 at the HF/6-31G* level. The parameters of protein were described by the AMBER FF14SB force field 24 . The TIP3P model 25 was used for water molecules.\n\nThe systems were neutralized by adding counter ions (either Na + or Clions). The systems were first minimized by using steepest descent method for 5000 cycles and then heated from 0 to 298 K in an NVT ensemble within 100 ps. The systems were then equilibrated in an NPT ensemble with weak restraints of 1000 kJ/mol/nm 2 for 500 ps followed by a 4 ns unconstrained production simulation. The last snapshot of the MD simulations was used for the following FEP calculations, and the trajectory of the last 2 ns was analyzed to get the parameters for adding restraints between receptors and ligands.\n\nBased on the preliminary MD simulations results, the FEP-ABFE calculations were carried based on the thermodynamic cycle given in Figure 1 . As shown in the thermodynamic cycle, a restraint should be added to the receptor and ligand for each FEP calculation. The strategy of adding restraints first reported by Boresch et al. 26 was used in this study, which consists of one distance, two angles, and three dihedrals harmonic potentials with a force constant of 10 kcal/mol/\u00c5 2 [rad 2 ]. The contribution of the restraints to the Lig (\u2206 ) system was calculated analytically, and the contribution of the restraint to the Rec-Lig system (\u2206 ) was calculated by FEP. According to the strategy, three atoms of the ligand and three atoms of the receptor will be selected to add the restraint. In order to add the restraints at the equilibrium position, a program was designed to automatically detect the required parameters and select the three ligand atoms and the three receptors atoms. For ligand, the heavy atom which is closest to the geometry center was selected as the first atom; the heavy atom which is most distant from the first atom was selected as the second atom; the heavy atom forms an angle that is larger than 90 degrees with the first two atoms and most distant from the first atom is selected as the third atom. For the receptor, based on the last 2 ns trajectory of the 4 ns preliminary MD simulations, the distances, angles, dihedrals between the three ligand atoms and C\u03b1, Cc (carbon of the carboxyl group) and N (N atom of the amino group) atoms of all the residues within 5 \u00c5 of the ligand were calculated along the MD trajectory. C\u03b1, Cc and N atoms from the same residue with the most stable (lowest standard deviation) distances, angles, and dihedrals values were selected as the three receptor atoms. The determined mean values of distance, angles, and dihedrals were used for adding the restraints between the three ligand atoms and the three receptor atoms. \n\nIn order to calculate the ABFE value between a ligand and its receptor, the ligand electrostatic and van der Waals interactions will be decoupled. In the recently published works 15, 16 , 12 \u03bb were used for adding restraints, 10 \u03bb were used for decoupling electrostatic interactions, and 20 \u03bb were used for decoupling vdW interactions, respectively, which need a lot of computation resources and thus is not applicable for the virtual screening purpose.\n\nIn order to make it possible to use FEP-ABFE in rapid discovery of inhibitors against COVID-19, the alchemical pathway was optimized to find one that can significantly not only improve the calculation speed but also keep the accuracy. According to the FEP theory, in order to calculate the free energy difference \u2206 , probability distribution of potential energy difference between adjacent \u03bb, denoted as (\u2206 ) , will be sampled. In the reported studies 27, 28 , (\u2206 )'s are considered as Gaussian-like distributions, which is true for the steps of electrostatic interactions and vdW interactions decoupling.\n\nHowever, for the restraint addition steps, the (\u2206 )'s are far from Gaussian distributions. In this study, we first derived and introduce the restrain energy distribution (RED) function which can be used to correctly describe the (\u2206 ) of the restraint addition steps. By using the automatic restrain adding program described above and fitting (\u2206 ) by the RED function, restraint energy can be accurately estimated by just using single-step perturbation (\u03bb from 0.0 directly to 1.0), which greatly decreased the calculation resources needed for the restraint addition. For the decoupling of electrostatic and vdW interactions, the alchemical pathways which can significantly decrease the number of \u03bb needed and keep the accuracy were also studied. After all these procedures have been done, the FEP-ABFE calculations were greatly accelerated, which made the application of FEP-ABFE for virtual screening possible.\n\nAfter the alchemical pathway is determined, for each window, 5000 cycles of steepest descent energy minimization were first carried out, and then 100 ps simulations in the NVT ensemble along with Langevin dynamics 29, 30 for temperature coupling was performed to heat the system to 298 K with weak position restraints of 1000 kJ/mol/nm 2 applied to the receptor and the ligand heavy atoms. The simulation system was subsequently equilibrated in an NPT ensemble for 500 ps with the position restraints still applied followed by a 4 ns unconstrained production simulation. Pressure was coupled using Parrinello-Rahman pressure coupling scheme 31 . The LINCS constraint algorithm 32 was used only on H-bonds. In all simulations, the particle mesh Ewald (PME) algorithm 33 was used for calculation of long-range electrostatic interactions. \uf044U values were sampled along the unconstrained simulation, and the free energy differences between each window were calculated by using the Bennet acceptance ratio (BAR) method 34, 35 .\n\nSeveral researches [36] [37] [38] have reported that the FEP-ABFE method is relatively accurate for electrically neutral ligands, but when the net charge of the ligand is not 0, there will be a systematic error.\n\nConsidering many of the FDA approved drugs are not electrically neutral, all the molecules evaluated via the FEP-ABFE calculations were grouped by their net charges, and in each group, the molecules with highest binding free energies were selected for further bioassay validation. Data processing and analysis were performed using BIAevaluation 1.1 software. \n\nThe probability distribution of energy difference between different windows (\u2206 ) for calculating \u2206 can be described by the following restrain energy distribution (RED) function (Eq. 1), and the derivation and detailed discussion of the RED function is given Supporting Information (SI) section S1.\n\nThe RED function can correctly describe the sampled restrain energy distribution (\u2206 ) and greatly increase the convergence for calculating \u2206 . As shown in Figure 2 (a), the sampled (\u2206 ) (yellow dots) for adding restraint can be fitted quite well by the RED function (red line). By using 3 targets and 28 ligands as a test set, with the use of the automatic restrain adding program and fitting the (\u2206 )\n\nby the RED function, the \u2206 calculated by using one-step perturbation (2 \u03bb with values of 0.0 and 1.0) has good correlation with that calculated by using the previously reported 12-\u03bb perturbation with R 2 larger than 0.97 (results are shown in Figure 2 (b)).

Besides using one-step perturbation for the calculation of \u2206A restr RL , the alchemical pathway for calculating \u2206A annihilation is also optimized which further decreased the number of \u03bb values needed. Detailed discussion about the correctness and rationality of the RED function are given in SI sections S2 and S3; detailed results about the comparison between one-step perturbation and 12-\u03bb perturbation are given in SI section S2;\n\nand detailed strategy for further optimizing the alchemical pathway for calculating \u2206A annihilation are given in SI section S4.After all the above efforts, the FEP-ABFE can be accurately calculated by using just 16 \u03bb values which need only 38 % computation resources compared with the reported FEP protocols, and the calculation is accelerated by more than 2.5 times. With such acceleration, FEP-ABFE calculation was first made possible to be applied in virtual screening to rapidly discover inhibitors against the coronavirus COVID-19.

One of the targets is BRD4 which is also used in the study of the FEP-ABFE method using 42 \u03bb values previously reported by Aldeghi et al., 15, 16 and since FEP-ABFE calculations have systematic bias when the net charge of the ligand is not 0, all the 8 neutral ligands from Aldeghi's work are used in this study. 15 Besides the target of BRD4, the other two targets include HIV-1 protease (10 electrically neutral ligands) and Human factor Xa (10 electrically neutral ligands). All the binding modes of the 28 calculated test systems are known from the protein data bank (www.rcsb.org), which ensured the correctness of the starting structures. As given in details in Table S3, Table S4 , and the linear regression statistics between the calculation and experimental results are given in Table 1 and The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . \n\nAfter all the FDA-approved drugs were docked into the binding site of Mpro, 100 molecules which have specific interactions with the six key amino acid residues including Cys145, His41, Ser144, (Figure 4 ). Since candesartan cilextil is a prodrug, its metabolite candesartan was also proved to be an Mpro inhibitor and showed an IC50 of 9.45 \uf06dM. Thus, totally 16 active molecules were found in this study, and their structures and activities are shown in Figure 4 . The inhibitory curves of the most potent leads are given in Figure 5 .\n\nAmong these 16 active molecules, ten leads (names shown in black in Figure 4 ) are originally discovered in this study, while other six compounds including disulfiram, chloroquine, montelukast sodium, atazanavir, indinavir, and maribavir are also reported in other previous studies 5, 39, 40 ( Figure   4 ). Dipyridamole was identified to be the most potent Mpro inhibitor with an IC50 of 0.55 \u03bcM, which was first discovered by this FEP-ABFE method. In addition, the SPR assay was performed to determine the binding affinity between dipyridamole and Mpro in vitro. This has revealed that DIP bound to Mpro with an experimentally confirmed affinity of 34 \u00b5M (KD,eq) ( Figure 6 ). In short, the relative hit rate of 60% and the ten originally discovered leads including dipyridamole indicated the significant advantage of the FEP-ABFE method in discovering biologically active compounds over traditional methods such as molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations.\n\nThe putative binding pattern between dipyridamole and Mpro is given in Figure 7a , and as shown in this figure, hydrogen bond interactions and hydrophobic interactions are the main driving forces for the binding between dipyridamole and Mpro. The protein-ligand interaction fingerprint (PLIF) is given in Figure 7b , which shows the key residues (Thr25, Asn142, Gly143, Ser144, His163 and Glu166) that The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.23.004580 doi: bioRxiv preprint patients with COVID-19 are subjected to further investigation into its therapeutic use in COVID-19, particularly in the shadow of its rapid spread into the world. \n\nIt has been reported COVID-19 led to the increased amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines in serum, which may be associated with pulmonary inflammation and lung damage in patients. 3 During viral infection, host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as RIG-I, sense viral RNA and hierarchically trigger signaling cascades, which include adaptor proteins (MAVS and TRAF), a set of well-studied serine/threonine kinases (IKK complex and TBK1/IKKi) and several transcription factors (NF-\u03baB and IRF3/IRF7) , to turn on the transcription of antiviral type I interferon (IFN) and pro-inflammatory cytokine genes, including TNF\uf061 and pro-IL-1\uf062. Subsequently, pro-IL-1\u03b2 can be further processed by active caspase-1 from inflammasome, to become mature IL-1\uf062 and initiates inflammatory responses ( Figure 8A ). Here we investigated the function of active molecules in virus-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines. Among the active molecules in Figure 5 , two molecules dipyridamole and montelukast .

In addition, both dipyridamole and montelukast sodium decreased SeV-induced mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF\uf061\uf020( Figure 8C ). Interestingly, dipyridamole, but not montelukast sodium could also inhibit the activity of NLRP3 inflammasome and reduced IL-1\uf062 secretion ( Figure 8D ). Collectively, we found both dipyridamole and montelukast sodium showed a global inhibitory function on NF-\uf06bB signaling and inflammatory responses during viral infection.

Cell culture supernatants were collected 24 hr post-transfection to measure IL-1\uf062 release by ELISA. \n\nIn this study, an accelerated FEP-ABFE based virtual screening strategy with bioassay validation is introduced as a rapid protocol to accurately discover anti-COVID-19 proteinase Mpro inhibitors. The Clinical trial (ChiCTR2000030055) was registered. As a result, we has finished its first-round clinical trials including 31 patients with COVID-19 and it demonstrated markedly improved clinical outcomes.\n\nIn summary, the FEP-ABFE-based method showed significant advantages by means of improving the hit rates and repositioning potent agents, which is especially suitable in prompting drug repositioning .

Interaction comes from force field can be simplified as a harmonic potential since the ligand is near the equilibrium, and the restraint force is also a harmonic biasing force. Thus, the total interaction potential between receptor and ligand can be simplified as\n\nwhere is the apparent force constant, and ( \u2212 0 ) is the generalized distance between the current position and the equilibrium. When adding restraints, the \u2206 between adjacent will be sampled in order to calculate the free energy of the added restraints, and the \u2206 can be represented by the following equation,\n\nwhere i and i+1 means the adjacent th and ( + 1)th window, and is the force constant of the added restraint.\n\nUnder the above circumstances, the probability distribution (\u2206 +1, ) can be represented as\n\nwhere Z is the partition function, = (kBT) \u2212 2 are two factors used to combine the two terms and keep the function to be described only by the first term (denoted as harmonic energy term hereinafter) when \u2206 is small and only by the second term (denoted as Gaussian term hereinafter) when \u2206 is large. The two constants n1 and n2 can be set to two relatively big integers, and we chose 10 and 4 for n1 and n2, respectively. We can also choose other values for n1 and n2 from 2 to 10, which do not affect the fitting results too much. The results of fitting (\u2206 ) by RED function is discussed in detail in the following section (SI Section S2).\n\nAlthough the accuracy of FEP calculation has been reported by several studies 1, 2 , the calculation resources needed for a single FEP-ABFE prediction is massive. Thus, in order to rapidly discover function, the (\u2206 ) can be fitted quite well, and the convergence for calculating restraint energy was greatly improved. As a result, the restraint energy can be accurately calculated by just one-step perturbation with \u03bb values change directly from 0.0 to 1.0, and the calculation can be greatly accelerated. Using a HIV-1 protease-ligand complex (crystal structure PDB ID: 2QHY) as an example, the restraint was added by using one-step perturbation and 12-\u03bb perturbation, respectively. The sampled (\u2206 )'s for adding restraints are fitted by RED function, and the results are shown in Figure   S1 . In each picture, the yellow dots are the corresponding sampled (\u2206 ), the green line is the harmonic energy term in the RED function, and the blue line is the Gaussian term in the RED function.\n\nAs expected, the RED function is described only by the harmonic energy term when \u2206 is small and only by the Gaussian term when \u2206 is large, and the sampled (\u2206 ) can be fitted well. The free energies of adding restraints are 0.912 and 0.948 kcal/mol for the 12-\u03bb perturbation and the one-step perturbation, respectively, which means the convergence for the one-step perturbation is pretty good. In order to further justify the applicability of one-step perturbation (2 \u03bb with values of 0.0 and 1.0, denoted as 2 \u03bb below) in adding restraints, three different targets and 28 ligands were tested to compare the \u2206A restr RL results calculated from 12 \u03bb and 2 \u03bb. The bond, angle, and dihedral parameters for the restraints are the same for 12 \u03bb and 2 \u03bb calculations. Table S1 summarized the results for the \u2206A restr RL , and the calculation results revealed that the single-step perturbation have good convergence with the energy difference for all the tested systems less than 0.5 kcal/mol. Thus, by using automatic restrain adding program and fitting the sampled (\u2206 ) by RED function, the calculation resources needed for adding restraints can be greatly decreased while keeping the accuracy.\n\n.

RED function can also correctly describe the restrain energy distribution even if the restrain is not added to the equilibrium position.\n\nAlthough the automatic restrain adding program can make sure that the parameters chose for the restrain are close to the equilibrium, it is still important to have an understanding about the behavior of the probability distribution of \u2206 when the parameters are not at the equilibrium. As an example, we determined the restraint parameters for 2QHY by using the original crystal structure instead by using the pre-equilibrated trajectory, and the resulted (\u2206 )\u2032 are shown in Figure S2 . As can be seen, the probability distributions for the initial several windows showed distributions with \"double-peak\"\n\nshapes. In theory, the \"double-peak\" shape distribution (\u2206 ) will happen when relative position between the receptor and ligand, which we use to determine the ligand restraints addition parameters, is far from the equilibrium state, and at the same time, the harmonic potentials used to apply the restraint are not strong enough. According to FEP theory, the probability distribution near the lower tail of (\u2206 ) will greatly influence the accuracy of \u2206 calculation. The \"double-peak\" shape of the probability distribution is far from the equilibrium, and the distribution pattern near the lower tail varies from time to time during the simulation, which will result in a very unstable free energy estimation. Thus, to deal with the instability in energy calculation, in the reported studies 1, 2 , the restraints are added with more than 10 \u03bb values, and the first several \u03bb are selected rather close to each other (0.0, 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.075, 0.1). Although the purpose of the RED function is to describe the (\u2206 ) when the restraints are added near the equilibrium state, the RED function can also describe the (\u2206 ) well even when restraints are not added near the equilibrium. Using the forward perturbation from 0.00 to 0.01 as an example, which is shown in Figure S2 , when the added restrain is relatively weak and not at the equilibrium position, the peak on the right which is described by the Gaussian term of the RED function is caused by the ligand occupying the equilibrium position, and the peak on the left is caused by the added restraints which is described by the harmonic energy term of the RED function. The RED function can describe the (\u2206 ) of adding restraints quite well no . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

FEP calculations can be accelerated by more than 2.5 times while keeping the accuracy with appropriate selection of \u03bb values.\n\nIn order to further accelerate the calculation, we studied the effect of decreasing the number of \u03bb values for both charge and vdW interactions decoupling by using 4 different receptor-ligand systems.\n\nCorresponding crystal structures (PDB codes: 3SVG, 3U5L, 3U5J, 4HBV) were used in order to make sure that the binding modes between the receptor and ligands are correct. For all the 4 crystal structures, the ABFE was first calculated by using 42 \u03bb (12 \u03bb for restrain, 10 \u03bb for charge, 20 \u03bb for vdW) as reported by the recently published works 1, 2 , and then the number of \u03bb values were decreased for the decoupling of both charge and vdW interactions. As can be seen in Table S2 , by using 16 \u03bb values in total (2 \u03bb for restrain with fitting by RED function, 5 \u03bb for charge, and 9 \u03bb for vdW) the energy calculation results are quite close to that calculated by using 42 \u03bb values for all the 4 systems tested (all the energy differences are within 1 kcal/mol). Compared with 42 \u03bb, FEP-ABFE calculation using just 16 \u03bb values need only 38 % computation resources, and the calculation is accelerated by more than 2.5 times. With such acceleration, FEP-ABFE calculation is now possible to be applied in virtual screening to rapidly discover inhibitors against the coronavirus COVID-19.\n\n.
