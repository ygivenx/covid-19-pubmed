{"title": "Efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in patients with COVID-19: results of a randomized clinical trial", "body": "Coronaviruses are enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the family Coronaviridae and are broadly distributed in humans and other vertebrates, eventually causing damage in digestive, respiratory and even multiple systems. In December 2019, a series of pneumonia cases of unknown etiology appeared in Wuhan, Hubei, China [1] . Sequencing analysis of throat swabs samples and electron microscope observations indicated a novel coronavirus, which was named SARS-CoV-2 (formerly known as 2019-nCoV) [2] . Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been confirmed to have obvious human-to-human characteristics [3, 4] . As of March 20, 2020, more than two hundred thousand confirmed cases have been identified globally, for a total of 8778 deaths [5] .\n\nAs the epidemic is spreading to many countries, COVID-19 poses a severe threat to global health [6] . Therefore, it is urgent to develop effective drugs against COVID-19.\n\nThe recent publication of results showing the activity of chloroquine (CQ) against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro [7] , some experts and researchers also have been recommended the efficacy of this antimalarial drug in patients with 9] . For this, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been working to investigate the use of CQ in COVID-19 [10] . As a derivative of CQ, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has similar therapeutic effects and fewer adverse effects. Based on its characteristics of immunity regulation, antithrombotic activity, and inflammation improvement, HCQ has been routinely used in the clinical treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) [11] .

In addition, among the 178 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia in our hospital, none were receiving HCQ treatment before admission. All predicting the use of HCQ in SARS-CoV-2 infections. As one of the clinical research registration units in China, we aimed to investigate the efficiency of HCQ in patients with COVID-19 in this study.\n\nThe clinical research protocol was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee in Renmin 62 patients who met the trial criteria were randomly assigned in a to two groups, all received the .

Randomization was performed through a computer-generated list stratified by site. Treatments were assigned after confirming the correctness of the admission criteria. Neither the research performers nor the patients were aware of the treatment assignments. Pulmonary recovery is defined as three levels: exacerbated, unchanged, and improved, moderately improved when less than 50 % of pneumonia were absorbed, and more than 50 % means significantly improved.\n\nData were described as the mean (standard deviation, SD), n (%), the t-test or \u03c7 \u00b2 test was used to compare the differences between the two groups. A two-sided p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed using Graphpad Prism, version 6.0.\n\n62 patients were identified as having COVID-19 and enrolled in this study, none quit ( Figure 1 ). As shown in Table 1 , For all patients, the age was 44.7 (15.3) years old, 46.8% (29 of 62) were male and 53.2% (33 of 62) were female. Patients were randomly assigned into two groups. There was no significant difference in the age and sex distribution between the two groups of patients, but there are .

The data in this study revealed that after 5 days of HCQ treatment, the symptoms of patients with COVID-19 were significantly relieved, manifesting as shorten in the recovery time for cough and fever. At the same time, a larger proportion of patients with pulmonary inflammatory has been partially absorbed in the HCQ treatment group, indicating the immune modulation and anti-inflammatory properties of HCQ in non-malarial diseases [17] . At present, the multiple actions of HCQ such as regulation in pro-inflammatory cytokines [e.g.\n\nTumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-1 (IL-6)], antioxidant activities, also promote it widely performed in rheumatic diseases such as SLE [11, 17] . According to current research, a higher pro-inflammatory cytokine storm existed in COVID-19 patients with a severe or critical illness, eventually affected the prognosis [18] . For this, IL-6 antibody blocker, transfusion of convalescent plasma, and other therapies have been applied to counteract the cytokine storm [19, 20] . Therefore, with antiviral and autoimmune regulation effects, HCQ should be a protector in SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the present study, the reduced risk of progression to severe illness in patients with HCQ treatment also explained the intervention effect of HCQ on the pathological process of the COVID-19.\n\nAlthough HCQ has proven to be effective, with advantages of inexpensive and easily accessible, its potential detrimental effects in viral diseases must also be taken seriously. Retinopathy is one of the major adverse reactions of long-term therapy with HCQ [21] . Besides, patients with rheumatoid diseases treated with HCQ occasionally experience arrhythmias [22] . Other rare adverse reactions caused by HCQ include gastrointestinal reactions, cramps, liver dysfunction, itching, headache, dizziness, insomnia, peripheral neuropathy [13] . Fortunately, deciding on individual treatment plans scientifically, monitoring adverse reactions timely, to avoid overdose, short-term application of HCQ is relatively safe.\n\nDespite our small number of cases, the potential of HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19 has been partially confirmed. Considering that there is no better option at present, it is a promising practice to apply HCQ to COVID-19 under reasonable management. However, Large-scale clinical and basic research is still needed to clarify its specific mechanism and to continuously optimize the treatment plan.\n\n.
