{"title": "A\u00afu optical immunoassay (ThermoBioStar's FLU OIA): a diagnostic tool for improved in\u00afuenza management", "body": "In\u00a3uenza diagnosis in the primary-care setting plays a key role in disease management at several levels. In the \u00a2rst instance, accurate diagnosis facilitates appropriate measures to be taken in treatment for the infected patient and limitation of spread of the disease within the community. Second, recognition of in\u00a3uenza in the clinic precedes specimen collection, laboratory isolation and subtyping of the virus in support of national or international surveillance e\u00a1orts. The former process obviously has immediate bene\u00a2t for disease alleviation and containment whereas the latter is crucial for the recognition of emerging subtypes for determination of annual vaccine composition and timely identi\u00a2cation of viruses with pandemic potential.\n\nIn\u00a3uenza symptoms are similar to those caused by other respiratory pathogens, which can be prevalent during the in\u00a3uenza season (Drinka et al. 1999) . Di\u00a1erentiation of true in\u00a3uenza from diseases caused by other respiratory pathogens therefore presents a challenge for both patient and health-care practitioner. Although the clinical diagnosis of in\u00a3uenza is reported to be correct in 65^85% of cases in the controlled setting of clinical trials, when rigorous case de\u00a2nitions are applied and when in\u00a3uenza has been identi\u00a2ed in the community (reviewed by Cram et al. 1999; Newton et al. 2000) , the accuracy of in\u00a3uenza diagnosis based on symptoms alone may be lower in the more general community. Indeed, several studies have highlighted the di\u00a4culties encountered distinguishing in\u00a3uenza symptoms from those caused by other respiratory pathogens in health practices contributing to in\u00a3uenza surveillance networks, let alone routine health care. For example, recent Australian surveillance data reveal that the clinical suspicion of in\u00a3uenza in general practice is con\u00a2rmed by laboratory isolation of in\u00a3uenza in only 49^54% of cases (Kelly et al. 2000) . Similar studies in England and Wales, France, and Scotland have reported con\u00a2rmation of clinical diagnosis of in\u00a3uenza ranging from 6 to 67% of noti\u00a2ed cases (Joseph 1995; Carrat et al. 1997) .\n\nLaboratory methods used to con\u00a2rm in\u00a3uenza are varied but generally involve virus isolation using one of a number of susceptible cell lines. Although of bene\u00a2t for disease-surveillance purposes, methods such as cell culture, that require days to weeks to resolve, can provide only retrospective diagnosis in most cases and have no immediate bene\u00a2t for the patient from whom the sample originated. In order to bene\u00a2t the patient and/or healthcare provider, a diagnostic result must be available quickly enough and provide su\u00a4cient information to lead to some action during or immediately after the patient consultation that o\u00a1ers an improvement over the outcome of clinical diagnosis alone. The turn^round time required for the diagnostic result to be useful is in part a function of the environment under which the consultation occurs. For example, for viral respiratory tract infections in the hospital environment semi-rapid (1 day or less) laboratory con\u00a2rmation of clinical diagnoses has been reported to lead to both clinical and \u00a2nancial bene\u00a2ts for patients and health-care providers (Woo et al. 1997; Barenfanger et al. 2000) . Bene\u00a2ts include reductions in mortality, length of stay and hospital costs, and the more appropriate use of antibiotics. Although it is conceivable that such a semirapid test may have bene\u00a2t in general practice, the realities of patient numbers, short consultation time and di\u00a4culties involved in ensuring patient recall for treatment suggest that a much more rapid,`point-of-care' (POC) test is required.\n\nPOC diagnostic tests have been de\u00a2ned as rapid (less than 30 min), easy to use assays that can be performed near the patient without the aid of additional equipment and provide immediate results to the health-care professional (reviewed by Hesterberg et al. 1995; Hesterberg & Crosby 1996) . Typical POC environments include general practitioner and paediatric o\u00a4ces, labour and delivery suites, emergency rooms, walk-in clinics and student health clinics (Hesterberg & Crosby 1996) . In hospital and managed-care environments POC assays have a role wherever rapid con\u00a2rmatory diagnosis is considered bene\u00a2cial and are often referred to as`bedside tests'. In the case of in\u00a3uenza, the probable bene\u00a2ts of rapid tests in such environments are considered to include early institutional outbreak recognition, improved focused diagnosis (particularly in patients with complex medical history), earlier discharge and reduced prescription of inappropriate antibiotics (Newton et al. 2000) .\n\nThe \u00a3u optical immunoassay (FLU OIA) (Thermo-BioStar, Inc., Boulder, CO, USA) (\u00a2gure 1) is an optical immunoassay POC test designed to detect both in\u00a3uenza A and B from a variety of sample types. The test requires no instrumentation, is performed at room temperature and provides a result within 15 min that is distinguishable by the human eye. The test is based on antibody-mediated detection of in\u00a3uenza nucleoprotein via a silicon chipbased thin-\u00a2lm biosensor (reviewed by Ostro\u00a1 et al. 1999) . Tests are self-contained, single units with internal performance controls. Although each is designed for single use the result is stable and can be stored for retrospective analysis if desired.\n\nThe FLU OIA test has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and is available in most countries worldwide. Users of the FLU OIA test perform a limited number of steps according to the procedure outlined in \u00a2gure 2. A positive result yields a purple coloured disc covering a signi\u00a2cant portion of the biosensor chip whereas a negative, properly conducted test yields a small purple spot in the centre of the chip (\u00a2gure 1). The following sections will review the 1916 S. P. Tucker and others FLUOIA for improved in\u00a3uenza management performance of the FLU OIA test in the laboratory and clinic with reference to peer-reviewed research where available.\n\nAnalytic sensitivity was determined using a variety of in\u00a3uenza A and B strains grown in either embryonated chicken eggs or MDCK cells. Graded concentrations of virus samples prepared in extraction bu\u00a1er were applied to a series of FLU OIA tests, which were developed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The lowest concentration of virus that yielded a result detectable by the operator's eye was considered to be the limit of sensitivity. Sensitivity ranged from 5 \u00c210 2 to 1.2 \u00c210 4 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ) units for in\u00a3uenza A and 9.4 \u00c210 2 to 1.4 \u00c210 4 TCID 50 units for in\u00a3uenza B (mean 4.4 \u00c210 3 and 7.4 \u00c210 3 , for A and B, respectively) (table 1). The test detected in\u00a3uenza A H1N1, H2N2, H3N2, H5N1 and in\u00a3uenza B viruses with comparable sensitivities. Reactivity tests against a wider selection of in\u00a3uenza viruses have revealed that the FLU OIA test is capable of detecting multiple in\u00a3uenza A subtypes of human, swine, equine and avian origin (table 2) . Watanabe et al. (1999) have reported the sensitivity for the FLU OIA test to be in the range of 3^6.5 \u00c210 4 plaque-forming units (PFU) for a variety of human A and B, swine and avian in\u00a3uenza viruses.\n\nThe FLU OIA test is intended for use with a variety of patient specimens isolated from sites within the respiratory tract. Since specimens may be contaminated with a variety of organisms and substances present at this site, it was important to establish that the FLU OIA test does not react (i.e. yield a false-positive signal) with probable contaminants or that its ability to detect in\u00a3uenza is not inhibited by these factors. Reassuringly, no crossreactivity or interference was observed in experiments involving a comprehensive panel of potential contaminants (table 3) . Others have con\u00a2rmed the excellent cross-reactivity pro\u00a2le of the FLU OIA test using specimens from the respiratory tract of patients infected with pathogens other than in\u00a3uenza A or B (Greene & Morris 1999; Turnbow et al. 1999; Hindiyeh et al. 2000) . Similarly, substances that could potentially contaminate specimens from patients with in\u00a3uenza-like illness (table 4) did not adversely a\u00a1ect the performance of the FLU OIA test.\n\nThe FLU OIA test is approved for use with a number of di\u00a1erent sample types, including throat swabs, nasal aspirates, nasopharyngeal swabs and sputa. Investigators have also shown that the FLU OIA test is capable of detecting virus antigen in other sample types including frozen specimens stored in viral transport media (VTM), nasal swabs, nasal washes, tracheal aspirates, bronchial washes and bronchial alveolar lavages (Greene & Morris 1999; Turnbow et al. 1999; Casciato et al. 2000; Hindiyeh et al. 2000; Lynch 2000) . The health-care worker may therefore use a sample type that is considered most appropriate and acceptable for the patient in a given consultation. Although this provides a useful element of \u00a3exibility it should be emphasized that not all sample (Viruses were grown in culture or embryonated hen's eggs according to published methods to titres of between 1 \u00c2 10 6 and 1 \u00c2 10 10 TCID 50 ml 71 (or haemagglutination titre of 1:128 for some in\u00a3uenza viruses). All of the viruses on the reactivity panel provided a positive result in the FLU OIA test, whereas all of the viruses in the cross-reactivity panel gave a negative result.) types yield equivalent performance. For example, throat swabs are considered to be a convenient sample type for many patients but are not necessarily the best source for the isolation of in\u00a3uenza virus (see below (\u00bd 2c(i)) and Covalciuc et al. (1998 Covalciuc et al. ( , 1999 and Kaiser et al. (1999) ).\n\nClinical trials of the FLU OIA test were designed to include a variety of sample types and to compare the performance of the FLU OIA test with that of the gold standard: 14-day tissue culture. A three-site study was conducted during the 1998 season. One hundred and eighty-three patients were recruited across three geographically distinct sites after presentation with in\u00a3uenzalike illness at various health-care providers including physicians' o\u00a4ces, emergency rooms and health clinics.\n\nPatients were asked to provide any combination of dual nasopharyngeal swabs, dual throat swabs, nasal aspirates and sputum specimens. A total of 404 specimens were collected. The results of this trial have been published previously (Covalciuc et al. 1999 ) and will be summarized below.\n\nTrial results with the FLU OIA test indicated that nasal aspirates and nasopharyngeal swabs were the most sensitive source for antigen detection whereas throat swabs and sputa yielded the poorest sensitivity when compared directly with in\u00a3uenza isolation in tissue culture (table 5 and Covalciuc et al. (1999) ). Some di\u00a1erences were apparent between the FLU OIA data generated solely at the POC site compared with the FLU OIA results obtained at both the POC and in clinical laboratories (table 5) . Similar observations have been made by others (Lynch 2000) and it seems probable that these di\u00a1erences can be attributed to variables in survival of in\u00a3uenza virus and antigen during transport to the laboratory.\n\nThe trial design permitted the comparison of culture isolation and FLU OIA results from individual samples to be compared with an expanded gold standard. Because multiple specimen types were obtained from each patient an expanded gold standard was established wherein the ability of tissue culture or the FLU OIA test to accurately predict the in\u00a3uenza status of patients known to be in\u00a3uenza positive was quanti\u00a2ed. Using this approach Covalciuc et al. (1998 Covalciuc et al. ( , 1999 reported that throat swabs are the worst sample type, of those examined, for isolation of culturable in\u00a3uenza virus or reactivity with the FLU OIA test (51.8% in both cases). The best sample type for virus isolation was sputum (90.2%) and the nasal aspirates were the most frequently positive specimens by the FLU OIA test (79.6%).\n\nInterestingly, the FLU OIA test and 14-day culture were found to yield statistically indistinguishable results for all sample types when compared with the expanded gold standard (\u00a2gure 3 and Covalciuc et al. (1999) ). Notably, there were di\u00a1erences in the results obtained from direct comparison of the FLU OIA test and tissue culture for each specimen (table 5) and the ability of each to accurately predict the in\u00a3uenza status of known in\u00a3uenza-positive patients (\u00a2gure 3). It seems probable that these discrepancies are caused by di\u00a1erent requirements for isolation of culturable virus and preservation of reactive antigens in a given specimen type. Indeed, the retrospective detection of in\u00a3uenza in several culturenegative and FLU OIA test-positive specimens using other approaches (table 5) supports this hypothesis. Nonetheless, both analyses agree that the choice of specimen type has a substantial impact on the ability of the diagnostic test to establish the in\u00a3uenza status of a patient with in\u00a3uenza-like illness.\n\n(ii) Performance of the FLU OIA assay in clinical practice FLU OIA tests are used in a wide range of clinical settings worldwide and there is an increasing body of literature available on the performance of the test in these real-world environments. A summary of published work on the FLU OIA test is provided in table 6.\n\nIt is interesting to note the wide range of specimen types listed in table 6. It is unclear whether this wide range is a consequence of di\u00a1erent physician or clinical laboratory preferences, institutional practices, or variation in specimen practicality and acceptability between patient groups (see, for example, Covalciuc et al. 1999 ). However, it highlights the desirability for a POC diagnostic to accommodate multiple specimen types. Overall it appears that the specimen types yielding the highest FLU OIA sensitivity in clinical practice are aspirates (nasal or tracheal), sputa and nasopharyngeal swabs. Although comparative data were not available in all cases, throat swabs were reported to be the least sensitive sample by several investigators. These observations are in agreement with the results obtained during clinical trial of the FLU OIA test (see \u00bd 2a(i)).\n\nA number of published studies have incorporated specimens transported or stored in VTM. Although the use of VTM is expected to dilute the sample and is not recommended by the manufacturer, the published data indicate that VTM does not signi\u00a2cantly interfere with detection of in\u00a3uenza antigens by the FLU OIA test. As noted by Hindeyeh et al. (2000) , this o\u00a1ers the potential for collection of a single specimen from a patient for testing by both the FLU OIA test at the POC and transport to the laboratory for con\u00a2rmatory culture or subtyping should this be required.\n\nThe proportion of in\u00a3uenza A and B virus specimens reported in most studies have been signi\u00a2cantly skewed in favour of one or the other, making comparison of A and B results in a single study problematical. This presumably re\u00a3ects the low level of in\u00a3uenza A and B co-circulation during the seasons and locales in which specimens were isolated. The majority of studies appear to have involved specimens principally from in\u00a3uenza A-infected patients. However, two reports have documented FLU OIA performance characteristics using specimens that were predominately in\u00a3uenza B positive (Mitamura et al. 1999; Yamazaki et al. 1999) . In both cases the sensitivity and speci\u00a2city of the FLU OIA test were consistent with the results for in\u00a3uenza A-positive specimens reported by others (table 6) . Data obtained using cultured in\u00a3uenza A and B viruses also indicate that the FLU OIA test is not biased towards either A or B (table 1 and Watanabe et al. (1999) ). In addition, on the basis of the limited cocirculation data available, it appears that the FLU OIA test may have a clinical detection limit for in\u00a3uenza B that is similar to that of in\u00a3uenza A virus (Herrmann et al. 2001) . Taken together, these data indicate that the FLU OIA test has equivalent performance characteristics for in\u00a3uenza A or B virus. The clinical manifestations of in\u00a3uenza and viral shedding patterns are known to di\u00a1er between adults and children (reviewed by Hayden & Palese 1997) . Although the data available to date are limited and further study is warranted, it appears that the FLU OIA test may be ca. 10% more sensitive for paediatric specimens (Mulford et al. 1999; Lynch 2000) .\n\nPOC testing has had a major impact on human health care and has helped revise management practices for a variety of human diseases (reviewed by Hesterberg et al. 1995; Hesterberg & Crosby 1996) . In the case of in\u00a3uenza virus, treatment options have been limited until recently, which has probably moderated the level of interest in rapid tests to con\u00a2rm a clinical suspicion of in\u00a3uenza. Con\u00a2rmatory laboratory diagnoses have been predominantly limited to surveillance networks and associated with subtyping in support of annual vaccine reformulation e\u00a1orts. This work is an essential component of a comprehensive in\u00a3uenza management system, but it provides little immediate bene\u00a2t for the infected patient or healthcare provider because of the delays associated with con\u00a2rmation of the clinical diagnosis. Nonetheless, a limited number of studies have shown that rapid laboratorybased con\u00a2rmatory testing for in\u00a3uenza can confer substantial bene\u00a2ts for patients and the health-care system (Woo et al. 1997; Barenfanger et al. 2000) .\n\nWith the advent of neuraminidase inhibitors, POC testing for in\u00a3uenza A and B virus is expected to play an increasingly important role in diagnostic and treatment decision-making (reviewed by Newton et al. 2000) . A reliable diagnosis of in\u00a3uenza on clinical grounds alone is challenging under most circumstances, and particularly so during the early stages of an outbreak when intervention is likely to be most e\u00a1ective. Since laboratory tests are expensive, require expert sta\u00a1 and provide results that are too late to impact the doctor^patient interaction, there is a role for rapid, sensitive POC tests for in\u00a3uenza A and B to augment clinical impressions. Herein we have reviewed the performance characteristics of one such test, the FLU OIA test. The FLU OIA test is a unique POC test based on silicon chip biosensor-mediated detection of in\u00a3uenza A and B nucleoprotein. The test is broadly reactive with in\u00a3uenza A and B viruses and is used in a wide range of health-care organizations worldwide. It has been found to be compatible with a large number of specimen types, including mucoid specimens such as sputum, which can present problems for`dipstick'-type POC tests relying on chromatographic technology or \u00a3ow-through membrane-based tests.\n\nThe data gathered to date indicate that the performance of the FLU OIA test, like any diagnostic test, is dependent on the quality of the specimen type. For example, throat swabs, which have been found to be a comparatively poor specimen for isolation of in\u00a3uenza virus by culture, are also poor performers in the FLU OIA. The best samples for the FLU OIA test have been found to be nasopharyngeal swabs, aspirates and sputa. Sensitivity of the test using the best specimens from studies which examined multiple specimen types is reported to range from 79 to 100% (mean 91%, table 6). However, it is recognized that \u00a3exibility in the choice of sample type is an important consideration for both health-care workers and patients. The overall high speci-\u00a2city of the FLU OIA test (84 and 94% for all sample types and sample types yielding highest speci\u00a2city, respectively) confers con\u00a2dence in a positive test result even in those circumstances where less than optimal specimens are available. This conclusion is reinforced by the observation that throat swabs are often listed as the specimen type yielding highest speci\u00a2city (table 6) .\n\nAlthough the present review has focused on human health-care applications, the FLU OIA test also has relevance for the veterinary \u00a2eld. have shown that the FLU OIA test is able to detect in\u00a3uenza in infected horses with high sensitivity (83%) and speci\u00a2city (93%). The rapid detection of in\u00a3uenza in horses is important for e\u00a1ective outbreak control and the FLU OIA test is considered to be a cost-e\u00a1ective option for \u00a2eld-testing horses via their nasal secretions with signi\u00a2cant bene\u00a2ts over slow, variable and costly laboratory diagnosis (Horse Health Lines 2000).\n\n(a) POC tests and in\u00a3uenza management in the interpandemic and pandemic periods: a proposal\n\nWe propose that rapid in\u00a3uenza testing when combined with clinical judgement has an important role in human and veterinary medicine during the interpandemic period. Indeed, a recent report on the use of the FLU OIA test in clinical practice indicated that physicians found routine POC testing to be clinically useful in augmenting clinical impressions (Musgnug & Chapin 2000) . Bene\u00a2ts described included improved patient satisfaction, informed discussion of intervention measures and increased incidence of appropriate therapy. From the institutional perspective, rapid diagnosis of in\u00a3uenza at the outset and during an outbreak provides a useful tool in the timely and informed application of appropriate disease-containment measures. A similar outcome is envisaged for veterinary applications of the FLU OIA test. All of these applications take advantage of the rapid feedback of a diagnostic result to the health-care worker a\u00a1orded by a POC test.\n\nPOC testing when used as an adjunct to clinical judgement can lead to improved disease management; however, it should be emphasized that POC testing for in\u00a3uenza is not a replacement for routine laboratory culture for in\u00a3uenza surveillance and typing purposes. Although of little immediate bene\u00a2t for the patient su\u00a1ering from in\u00a3uenza, the individuals, institutions and government organizations performing this function play a vital role in in\u00a3uenza management on a community, national and international basis. Rather than supplanting this established network, we contend that the widespread use of POC tests provides an opportunity to extend awareness of in\u00a3uenza in the community and o\u00a1ers the potential for more diverse and cost-e\u00a1ective surveillance. For example, kits such as the FLU OIA test that are appropriate for`\u00a2eld use' may be used to gather data on in\u00a3uenza incidence in remote locations or in communities that lack convenient access to clinical laboratories. In addition, the testing of samples by the FLU OIA test before shipment to the laboratory for tissue culture o\u00a1ers interesting options for increasing the frequency of in\u00a3uenza-positive specimens and reduced laboratory costs.\n\nWhat might be the role of POC tests at the onset and during the next pandemic ? In the event of an in\u00a3uenza pandemic it seems probable that demand for diagnostic con\u00a2rmation of suspected cases will become widespread, and in those areas where laboratories are available they are likely to quickly become overloaded. POC tests are expected to prove useful in facilitating increased surveillance through patient screening prior to submission of FLUOIA for improved in\u00a3uenza management S. P. Tucker and others 1921 1999) . In communities that lack access to laboratories, POC testing may be the only option available. Because the simplicity of POC tests such as the FLU OIA test and their self-contained design is consistent with use by nonmedical sta\u00a1, surveillance activities could be extended to include non-traditional sampling sites and personnel. Indeed, it is conceivable that rapid POC tests could become a front-line tool with broad applications for disease management and containment not only in the health-care setting, but also in places such as farms, quarantine centres, military barracks, airports and other locations wherever an on-the-spot diagnosis is required."}
