{"title": "Supporting Material Choindroitinase ABC I-mediated enhancement of oncolytic virus spread and anti tumor efficacy: A mathematical model", "body": "Clearance rate of viruses (\u03b3): Friedman et al. [4] used \u03b3 = 2.5 \u00d7 10 \u22122 h \u22121 . Mok et al. [8] used \u03b3 = 4.8 \u00d7 10 \u22125 s \u22121 = 1.728 \u00d7 10 \u22121 h \u22121 for free (interstitial) and bound virus. In the in vitro experiments in [1] , the half-lives of HSV particles at 37 o C were \u223c4 hours (\u223c 1.733 \u00d7 10 \u22121 h \u22121 ) and \u223c24 hours (\u223c 2.89 \u00d7 10 \u22122 h \u22121 ) in tumor cell conditioned media and in PBS, respectively. However, as Mok et al. [1] noted, virus is internalized rapidly without much time for degradation. We found that the computational results is not sensitive to this parameters in several magnitudes as also noted in Wu et al. [9] . We take rather small value \u03b3 = 1.8 \u00d7 10 \u22123 h \u22121 .\n\nBurst size of infected cells (b): We take b = 50 virus/cell from Friedman et al. [4] .\n\nECM production rate from uninfected tumor cells (\u03bb 42 ): Kim et al. [10] took ECM remodeling/production rate of 5.0 \u00d7 10 \u22126 s \u22121 = 0.018 h \u22121 . We take \u03bb 42 = 6.0 \u00d7 10 \u22123 h \u22121 . Assuming uninfected cell density x = (10 4 \u2212 10 6 ) cells/mm 3 [4, 11] and K x = x * , m 2 = 1 in Table 1 , and \u03bb 42 above, we get the effective production rate by uninfected tumor cells \u03bb 42\n\nECM degradation rate (\u03bb 41 ): Kim et al. [10] took 3.0 \u00d7 10 8 cm 3 /(g.s) for ECM degradation rate from MMP secretion of tumor cells. We take \u03bb 41 = 9.0\u00d710 1 h \u22121 . By assuming C = (0.5\u2212250) mU/ml [12] [13] [14] and with K C = C * , m 1 = 1 in Table 1 , this estimated value \u03bb 21 leads to the effective degradation rate \u03bb 41\n\nNatural decay rate of Chase (\u03bb 62 ): Kim et al. [10] took the natural decay rate of MMPs to be 5.0 \u00d7 10 \u22126 s \u22121 = 1.8 \u00d7 10 \u22122 h \u22121 . The half-life of Chase-ABC (at 37 o C) can vary significantly [15] . The halflife was 6 days in brain of injected rat [13] while it can be 2-3 weeks with trehalose or albumin (stabilizers) [16, 17] . In the simulation, assuming the half-life of 115 hours, we take \u03bb 62 = log(2)/115h = 6.0\u00d710 \u22123 h \u22121 .\n\nSecretion rate of ECM degrading enzyme (\u03bb C ): This parameter value is largely unknown. We take \u03bb C = 3.0 \u00d7 10 1 mU/(h.g), but also ran several trials ( Figure 5 in the main text) in order to gauge the effect of this parameter. Table 2 in the main text lists the reference values in the model. We define L = 3 mm following experimental setup in [5] and take the characteristic diffusion coefficient D = 1.5 \u00d7 10 \u22125 cm 2 /s so that T = 1.67 h. We determine the reference values for x, y, n, v, E, C as follows:\n\nCell density (x, y, n): Chicoine et al. took 5 \u00d7 10 5 cells/cm 3 [18] . Mok et al. [1] used high value 7.23 \u00d7 10 8 cells/ml from Thurber and Wittrup [19] . Friedman et al. used 10 6 cells/mm 3 = 10 9 cells/cm 3 from [11] . Following [4, 11] , we take x * = y * = n * = 10 6 cells/mm 3 .\n\nWe take v * = 2.2 \u00d7 10 11 virus/cm 3 = 2.2 \u00d7 10 8 virus/mm 3 [4, 11] . We also note that virus concentration can be calculated indirectly from plaque-forming unit (pfu). For instance, Mok et al. [1] estimated the total viral concentration from 1 \u00d7 10 6 pfu by using a factor of 50. In [5] , 3 \u00d7 10 5 pfu of rHsvQ or OV-Chase were used.\n\nECM density (CSPG (E * ), Tumor ECM (\u03c1 * )): Various CSPG concentrations (0-500 \u00b5g/ml) and 5 \u00b5g/ml laminin were used for the invasive and noninvasive coculture spot assays in a study of the role of CSPG in regulation of glioma invasion and CSPG was shown to be a potent activator of microglia in vivo and to play as a key organizer of the brain tumor microenvironment [20] . High molecular weight Cat-301 CNS CSPG from brain in the density of 1.4 g/ml [21] was shown to have similar properties as aggrecan, the high molecular weight CSPG from cartilage with typical low-buoyant-densities 1.35-1.4g/ml [22] . Using isoforms of one of major CSPG components, version (Intact versicans V1, V2, and amixture of V0 and V1) isolated from calf aorta, bovine spinal cord, and the spent culture medium of the human glioma cell line U251MG, respectively, Dutt et al. investigated the role of versican V0 and V1 in the range of 0-100 \u00b5g/ml in regulation of neural crest cell migration. They found that even low levels of version V0/V1 (> 25 \u00b5g/ml) can inhibit neural crest stem cell migration [23, 24] . Also, total expression of noncleaved isoforms of BEHAB/Brevican was found to be >4-fold higher in human malignant gliomas compared with normal brain tissue [25] . Isolated versican from brain tissue was estimated to be 3mg/100g wet tissue [26] . We take E * = 1.0 mg/cm 3 . Glial HA-binding protein (GHAP), a brain-specific protein mainly localized in white matter, is present in high concentrations in CNS tissues, 8.2 mg/100g in human white matter (wet tissue) [26] compared to the concentration of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in buffered extracts of human spinal cord, 3.5 mg/100g [27] . We take \u03c1 * =1.0 mg/cm 3 .\n\nConcentration of Chase-ABC (C * ): High-dose infusions of Chase (2 \u2212 1, 000 U/mL) is necessary in order to get diffusion of Chase-ABC into deep regions of the spinal cord when it is delivered intrathecally because of attendant dilution and overflow beyond the intrathecal space [17] . In a study of delivery of thermostabilized Chase for functional recovery after injury, Lee et al. [17] found that trahalose-assisted Chase in the concentration of 2 U/0.5mL was enough to digest CSPG decorin. In a study of effects of Chase ABC on the morphology of neural precursor cells (NPCs) expanded in spheres, Gu et al. [14] used a wide concentration range of Chase ABC (0.5-50 mU/mL) in addition to 20 ng/ml EGF and 20 ng/ml bFGF. In a study of effect of Chase-ABC on acute and long-lasting changes in CSPG, injected Chase ABC at a concentration of 0.25 U/\u00b5l led to significant degradation of ECM in the adult rat brain [12] . The protease-free Chase-ABC in the concentration of 50 U/ml showed digestion of CSPGs around the injection site (leading to low GAG content (1,200-2,000 \u00b5g/mg) compared to high peak values (4, 000 \u00b5g/mg) with penicillinase-treatment) and promoted axon regeneration [13] . We take C * = 50 mU/ml.\n\nWe nondimensionalize the variables and parameters in the partial differential equations (A.1)-(A.9) as follows:t\n\nThe governing equations in a dimensionless form are\n\n\u2202C \u2202\u03bd = 0, on \u2202\u2126 0 .\n\n*Note that\u03b2 \u2020 =\u03b2,\u03b4 \u2020 =\u03b4 under the assumption of x * = y * = n * ; otherwise\u03b2 \u2020 ,\u03b4 \u2020 from\u03b2,\u03b4, respectively.\n\nEquations (2)-(13) were solved using multigrid method [28] and vanka relaxation method [29] .\n\nVelocities are defined at cell boundaries while x, y, n, E, \u03c1, v, C, and p are defined at the cell centers. Let a computational domain be partitioned in Cartesian geometry into a uniform mesh with mesh spacing h. The center of each cell, \u2126 ij , is located at (x i , y j ) = ((i\u22120.5)h, (j\u22120.5)h) for i = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , N x and j = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , N y . N x and N y are the numbers of cells in x and y-directions, respectively. The cell vertices are located at (x i+ 1 2 , y j+ 1 2 ) = (ih, jh). Let \u2206t be a time step and k be a time step index. At the beginning of each time step, given x k , y k , n k , E k , \u03c1 k , v k , C k , and u k , we want to find x k+1 , y k+1 , n k+1 , E k+1 , \u03c1 k+1 , v k+1 , C k+1 , u k+1 , and p k+1 which solve the following temporal discretization of equations (2)-(10):\n\nThe outline of the main procedures in one time step is:\n\nStep 1. Initialize x 0 , y 0 , n 0 , E 0 , \u03c1 0 , v 0 , C 0 , and u 0 .\n\nStep 2. Solve x k+1 , y k+1 , n k+1 , E k+1 , and \u03c1 k+1 . The resulting finite difference equations (14)-(18) are written out explicitly. They take the form\n\nwhere the advection term, \u2207 \u00b7 (x k u k ), is defined by:\n\nwhere u and w are horizontal and vertical velocity components, respectively. The quantities \u2207 \u00b7 (y k u k ), \u2207 \u00b7 (n k u k ), \u2207 \u00b7 (E k u k ), and \u2207 \u00b7 (\u03c1 k u k ) are computed in a similar manner.\n\nStep 3. The resulting implicit discrete system (19)- (20) is solved by a linear geometric multigrid method [28] .\n\nStep 4. The resulting implicit discrete system (21)- (22) is solved by a coupled block-implicit multigrid method [29] .\n\nA pointwise Gauss-Seidel relaxation scheme is used as the smoother in the linear geometric and coupled block-implicit multigrid methods.\n\nThese complete the one time step.\n\nProgram is written in C. Calculations were performed on a Intel Core i3 CPU (3.20 GHz) with 2 GB of RAM."}
