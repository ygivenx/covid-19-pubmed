{"title": "Defective-Interfering Particles of Murine Coronavirus: Mechanism of Synthesis of Defective Viral RNAs", "body": "Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a member of the Coronaviridae, contains a single-stranded and positivesense RNA of approximately 6 X lo6 Da (Lai and Stohlman, 1978; Wege et a/., 1978) . In infected cells, the genomic RNA of MHV encodes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Brayton et a/., 1982 (Brayton et a/., , 1984 Mahy et al., 1983) which is utilized for the synthesis of a genomic-sized negative-stranded RNA (Lai et a/., 198213) . The negative-stranded RNA then serves as the template for the synthesis of six subgenomic and one genome-sized mRNA (Brayton et al., 1984; Lai et al., 1982b) . These mRNAs are arranged in the form of a 3' coterminal \"nested\" set, i.e., the sequences of each mRNA are contained entirely within the next larger mRNA (Lai et a/., 1981; Leibowitz et a/,, 1981) . In addition, each mRNA has a common leader sequence, which is derived from the 5' end of the genome (Lai et al., 1982a (Lai et al., , 1983 (Lai et al., , 1984 Spaan et a/., 1983) . Several pieces of evidence demonstrate that MHV utilizes a novel mechanism of leader RNA-primed transcription for the synthesis of mRNAs (Baric et a/., , 1985 Makino et a/., 1986) .\n\nWe have previously reported the generation of defective-interfacing (DI) particles during high multiplicity passages of the JHM strain of MHV (MHV-JHM) (Makino et al., 1984a) . In purified virus particles, only one RNA species, which is slightly smaller than the ge- ' To whom requests for reprints should be addressed. nomic RNA of the standard virus, is detected. In Dl-infected cells, the synthesis of most of the standard viral mRNAs is inhibited, but the cells contain three distinct RNA species (Makino et al., 1985) . The first species, DlssA, is equivalent to DI virion RNA, and is eventually incorporated into the virus particles. This RNA differs from the standard virus genomic RNA in that it contains multiple sequence changes distributed throughout the genome, except for regions encoding RNA polymerases and nucleocapsid (N) protein. The second species is mRNA 7, which is indistinguishable from the mRNA 7 made by the standard virus. The synthesis of this mRNA is not inhibited in DI-infected cells. Thus, a normal amount of N protein, which is encoded from this mRNA, is synthesized in DI-infected cells. The third RNA species is a novel subgenomic RNA species, which is single-stranded and polyadenylated. Oligonucleotide fingerprinting studies suggest that it represents sequences derived from various noncontiguous parts of the genome. Interestingly, this RNA differs in size and sequence at different DI passage levels. This RNA was not detected in purified virus particles (Makino et a/., 1984a) .\n\nWe are interested in the mechanism of synthesis of DI RNA species in DI-infected cells. Specifically, we asked the following two questions: (1) How are the novel intracellular subgenomic DI RNA species synthesized? Since subgenomic DI RNAs detected in DIinfected cells are not detected in DI particles (Makino et al., 1984a) , it seems plausible that all of the sub-genomic DI RNAs are transcribed de nova from the negative-strand RNA template of DI virion RNA. This mechanism would require multiple jumping during transcription. However, it is also possible that DI particles incorporate a trace amount of subgenomic DI RNA, which can replicate itself in infected cells. The latter mechanism would be more similar to the DI RNA of other virus systems. (2) Does DI genomic RNA code for a functional RNA piolymerase which can replicate DI genomic. RNA without helper viruses? This question arises from the oligonucleotide fingerprinting analysis of DI genomic RNA. This RNA contains multiple deletions as compared to the standard virus genome; however, the 5' end of the genome, which presumably encodes viral RNA polymerases, is essentially intact (Makino et al., 1985) . The studies presented in this report revealed that coronavirus DI RNA synthesis involves several unique features.\n\nThe MHV-JHM and MHV-A59 were used as nondefective standard viruses. The serially passaged MHV-JHM stock at passage level 17 was used as the source of DI particles (Makino et a/., 1985) . This virus stock inhibits the growth of standard MHV-JHM to about 50-60% (Makino et a/., 1984a) . All viruses were propagated in DBT cells as described previously (Makino et a/., 1984a) . Mouse L.-2 cells (Lai ef a/., 1981) were used for RNA transfection studies.\n\nPurification of viruses 32P-labeled viruses were purified according to published procedures (Makino et al., 1983) with slight modifications. Virus was collected at 14 hr postinfection (p.i.) and clarified by low-speed centrifugation. The supernatants were then placed on discontinuous sucrose gradients consisting of 10 and 50% (w/w) sucrose in NTE buffer (Cl.1 M NaCI, 0.01 MTris-HCI, pH 7.2, and 0.001 M EDTA). After centrifiugation at 26,000 rpm for 3 hr a't 4' in a Beckman SW 28.1 rotor, the virus band at the interphase between 10 and 50% sucrose was collected, diluted with NTE buffer, and centrifuged in a 10 to 60% continuous sucrose gradient at 26,000 rpm for 19 hr at 4\". After centrifugation, fractions were collected and the position of virus was determined by locating the radioactive virus peak.\n\nPreparation of virion RNA and virus-specific intracellular RNA Viral RNA was extracted from purified viruses by procedures described previously (Makino et al., 1984a) . MHV-specific intracellular RNA was labeled with [32P]orthophosphate for 1 hr, from 7 hr to 8 hr p.i. in the presence of 2.5 pg/ml actinomycin D and extracted with phenol/chloroform as previously described (Makino et a/., 1984b) .\n\nAgarose gel electrophoresis RNA was separated by electrophoresis on 1 O/O agarose gels after denaturation with 1 M glyoxal (McMaster and Carmichael, 1977) . For nondenaturing gels, RNA was dissolved in 10 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) containing 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 O/o bromphenol blue, and 0.1% xylene cyanol FF, and mixed with an equal volume of glycerol and then applied to 1 O/o agarose gel in electrophoresis buffer (10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0). Preparative gel electrophoresis in 1 or 1.3% urea-agarose gels was performed as previously described (Makino et a/., 1984a) . The RNA was eluted from gel slices by the method of Langridge et al. (1980) .\n\nFour hundred microliters of DI virus samples in growth medium was spread onto 60-mm Falcon plastic dishes. At a distance of 50 cm under a 30-W germicidal lamp, virus samples were irradiated for various periods of time. After uv irradiation, DI virus was mixed with nonirradiated MHV-JHM, and the mixture was immediately inoculated onto DBT cells. Virus-specific RNA synthesis was determined as described above.\n\nConfluent L-2 ceils on 60-mm plastic dishes were first infected with MHV-A59 at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 5. After 1 hr of adsorption, viruses were removed and the cells were washed once with prewarmed Eagle's minimum essential medium (MEM). Gel-purified RNA (I pg) in 200 ~1 of transfection buffer (600 pg/ml DEAE-dextran, 0.14 M LiCI, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, and 1 mM MgC12) was added to the cells at room temperature. After 30 min of incubation, the inoculum was removed and the cells were washed once with prewarmed MEM. The infected cells were then incubated with 4 ml of MEM containing 5% fetal calf serum at 37\" for 13 hr. Culture fluid was harvested, clarified, and stored at -70\". Four hundred microliters of the virus samples was used to infect new monolayers of DBT cells for subsequent virus passages.\n\nPurified 3zP-labeled RNA were digested with RNase Tl and the resistant oligonucleotides were separated by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as previously described (Makino et al., 1984a) .\n\nOur previous studies (Makino ef a/., 1984a (Makino ef a/., , 1985 suggest that, among different intracellular DI-specific RNA species, only the genome-sized DlssA RNA can be incorporated into virus particles. However, we could not rule out the possible presence of a small amount of subgenomic DI RNA species in Dl virus particles. To reexamine this issue, intracellular RNA and RNA isolated from the purified virus released from the same DI-infected cells were compared directly. In the present study, the DI-containing MHV-JHM stock at passage level 17 was used as the source of DI particles. At this passage level, two DI RNA species, DlssA and DlssE, and mRNA 7 were detected in infected cells (Makino et a/., 1985) (Fig. 1, lane b) . The amount of DlssE was different from preparation to preparation of virus stocks (data not shown) (see below). To characterize the RNA species in purified DI particles, a modified procedure was used for virus purification to include virus particles of lower density. A single virus band with a buoyant density of 1.19 g/cm3 was detected (data not shown). This virus preparation contains both standard MHV-JHM genomic RNA and DI genomic RNA (Fig. 1, lane a) . As shown previously, the DI genomic RNA in the purified virus particles represents the packaged DlssA RNA detected in infected cells (Makino et a/., 1985) . No other RNA species are detectable. However, a prolonged exposure of the autoradiogram in this study revealed that the DI virus population contained a trace amount of mRNA 7 and DlssE (Fig. 1, lane c) , suggesting that a minute amount of these subgenomic RNAs could be packaged. The presence of DlssE RNA, though in small quantity, in DI particles necessitated the distinction between DlssA and DlssE itself as the RNA template for the synthesis of DlssE RNA in DI-infected cells.\n\nTo determine whether DlssE RNA is transcribed directly from DI genomic RNA or is replicated from the small amount of DlssE present in DI particles, we studied the effects of uv irradiation of DI particles on DI RNA synthesis. This study is based upon the chain-terminating effects of uv photoproducts in the RNA template. Potential sites for these uv lesions are distributed randomly along the RNA, and one uv lesion is sufficient to terminate transcription. Thus, inactivation of RNA synthesis by uv light occurs with pseudo onehit kinetics. In the present study, lesions are induced on the DI genomic RNA by uv irradiation of virus pat-ticles. Therefore, the synthesis of negative-stranded RNA is terminated at the uv lesions on input virion RNA. If DlssE RNA is transcribed from the negative template of DI genomic RNA, the inactivation kinetics of the synthesis of both DlssA and DlssE should be the same. On the contrary, if DlssE RNA is replicated directly from the template of its own size, the DlssE RNA synthesis should be more resistant to uv irradiation than DlssA RNA, since DlssA has a much larger target size.\n\nThe DI virus stock was irradiated with uv light for various periods of time and was then used to coinfect DBT cells with standard MHV-JHM. The 32P-labeled intracellular virus-specific RNA was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The resolution of DlssA and mRNA 1 of MHV-JHM was poor in agarose gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions (Fig. 2 , lanes a-f) (Makino et a/., 1985) . However, under nondenaturing conditions, both RNAs were clearly separated (Fig. 2, lanes g-j) probably due to differences in the secondary structure between both RNAs. The latter electropherograms were used for determining the uv sensitivity of DlssA. It is evident that the synthesis of DlssA RNA was inhibited by uv light at a much faster rate than that of DlssE RNA, indicating that the sizes of template RNA of DlssE and DlssA are different. The target sizes of the template RNA for both RNAs were calculated to be equivalent to the physical sizes of these two RNAs, respectively (data not shown). Thus, DlssE RNA is most likely replicated from the small amount of DlssE RNA packaged in the DI particles, but not from the DI genomic RNA, which is the predominant RNA species in virus particles. \n\nThe uv inactivation study suggested that DlssE RNA replicates independently of DlssA RNA. To support this conclusion, we examined whether DlssE can be synthesized in the absence of DlssA RNA. For this study, DlssE RNA was purified from the gel and used to transfect L-2 cells which had been infected with MHV-A59 to serve as a helper virus. The virus harvested from the transfected L-2 cells was passaged an additional time on DBT cells before virus-specific RNA in infected cells was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3) . Clearly, the virus obtained from DlssE RNA-transfected culture synthesized DlssE RNA, while the virus from cells infected with helper virus alone did not. The absence of DlssA in both intracellular RNA samples was confirmed by nondenaturing agarose gel electrophoresis (data not shown). This study corclusively demonstrated that DlssE is replicated frorn its own template which is, in turn, transcribed from the small amount of DlssE RNA packaged in DI particles.\n\nWe have previously demonstrated that, during mixed infection with two different MHVs, the leader sequence from one virus could be detected on the mRNAs of the coinfecting virus at a very high frequency (Makino et a/., 1986) . To determine whether DlssE is synthesized by the same mechanism as standard subgenomic mRNAs, i.e., utilizing a free leader RNA, we determined whether the A59 leader RNA could be utilized for the replication of DlssE RNA. Cells were coinfected with MHV-A59 and the DI particles of MHV-JHM at an m.o.i. of 1 each, and virus-specific intracellular RNAs were examined by agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 4) . The data showed that the synthesis of MHV-A59 mRNAs was inhibited to the same extent as MHV-JHM by DI particles. However, the synthesis of mRNA 7 was not inhibited. The synthesis of DlssE was stimulated by coinfection with MHV-A59 (Fig. 4, lanes 5 and 8) . This stimulation was not observed when MHV-JHM was used as a coinfecting virus (data not shown). The structure of DlssE obtained from cells coinfected with MHV-A59 and that from cells infected with DI only were compared. As shown in Fig. 5 , the oligonucleotide fingerprints of DlssE from these two sources are indistinguishable. Both contain JHM-specific leader T,-oligonucleotide No. 8 and other DlssE-specific T, spots (Makino et a/., 1985) . The leader-specific oligonucleotide of MHV-A59, which would have been electrophoretically distinguishable (Makino eta/., 1986) was not detected in DlssE isolated from coinfected cells. This result was not due to the absence of MHV-A59 leader RNA synthesis since the synthesis of MHV-A59 mRNA 7 was not completely inhibited (Fig. 4, and data dicated that the MHV-A59-specific leader RNA was present in the same molar quantity as other MHV-A59 sequences (data not shown). Therefore, we conclude that the synthesis of DlssE is the result of replication of its own template, and does not involve a free leader RNA species, which is required for the transcription of standard subgenomic mRNA.\n\nOligonucleotide fingerprinting analysis shows that the DlssA RNA contains multiple deletions as compared to the wild-type genome; however, the 5'-end gene A, which presumably encodes viral RNA polymerases, is essentially intact (Makino et al., 1985) . This raises a possibility that the DlssA RNA may encode a functional polymerase. Thus, DlssA RNA could be synthesized independently of the helper functions provided by standard viruses. To prove the DlssA encodes a functional polymerase which can synthesize its own RNA independently of helper functions, we examined the effects of serial virus dilution on the synthesis of DI-specific RNAs. Since the virus stock used in this experiment contained both DI particles and wild-type MHV-JHM, serial virus dilution would reduce the possibility of a cell being coinfected with both DI particles and standard helper viruses. Thus, if DI RNA synthesis requires helper functions from the standard virus, the DI RNA synthesis should decrease exponentially following virus dilution, according to a two-hit kinetics. In contrast, a one-hit kinetics would indicate that DI RNA can be synthesized independently of helper functions. Cells were infected with serial dilutions of either DI-containing MHV-JHM stock or standard MHV-JHM, and 3zP-labeled virus-specific RNA were separated by electrophoresis (Figs. 6A, 6B, 6C) . The amounts of virus-specific RNAs were quantified by densitometry and the graphs were fitted by linear regression analysis (Figs. 6D, 6E, 6F ). The effects of virus dilution on the synthesis of standard virus-spe- cific mRNAs are shown in Figs. 6B and 6E. Since all MHV-specific mRNAs are transcribed from the same negative template of genomic RNA (Lai et a/., 1982b) , the kinetics of RNA synthesis for all mRNAs vs virus dilution follows a one-hit kinetics. Similarly, the synthesis of DlssA decreased linearly following virus dilution, according to a one-hit kinetics (Figs. 6A and 6D) , suggesting that DlssA was synthesized in the absence of helper functions. Thus the DI genomic RNA contains all the genetic information required for DlssA RNA synthesis. In contrast, the reduction of DlssE RNA synthesis followed a two-hit kinetics, suggesting that helper functions from standard viruses are required for DlssE synthesis (Figs. 6A and 6D) . This interpretation was further tested by a similar virus dilution experiment performed in the presence of a constant amount of excess standard MHV-JHM (m.o.i. = 5). As shown in Figs. 6C and 6F, the kinetics of DlssE RNA synthesis appeared similar to that of DlssA as compared by simple regression analysis. This study demonstrated that the replication of subgenomic DI RNA requires a trans-acting product(s), which was supplied by the coinfecting standard virus.\n\nIn this report, we studied the mechanism of synthesis of DI-specific RNAs in MHV DI-infected cells. Our data showed that both of the DI-specific RNA species, DlssA and DlssE, are synthesized from the negativestrand RNA template of their own sizes. In addition, DlssE requires helper viruses for its replication, while DlssA does not. Thus DlssA contains all of the functions essential for its own replication.\n\nThe template size for DlssE RNA synthesis was unexpected. Since MHV DI particles were previously shown to contain only the genome-sized RNA (Makino et al., 1984a) , it was suggested that DlssE RNA had to be transcribed de novo from the DI genomic RNA by a jumping transcription mechanism. The data in this report showed that a minute amount of DlssE RNA could be packaged along with other subgenomic mRNAs into virus particles. The studies of uv target size and transfection of DlssE RNA conclusively indicated that the DlssE RNA synthesis utilizes the negative-strand RNA template of its own size and does not rely on the DI genome. Thus, DlssE RNA is most likely replicated from the packaged DlssE RNA associated with the virus particles. This study thus indicated that DlssE RNA synthesis is different from the transcription of subgenomic mRNAs of standard MHV. This conclusion is also supported by the finding that DlssE RNA synthesis does not utilize a free leader RNA of a helper virus. Thus, DlssE RNA synthesis is more similar to the replication of MHV RNA genome.\n\nThe poor incorporation of DlssE in virus particles distinguishes the MHV DI from Dls of other viruses. The incorporation of DlssE RNA in virions may be nonspecific and random. This may account for the variation in the amount of DlssE RNA synthesized by different DI-containing virus preparations, since different DI stocks may contain different amounts of DlssE RNA in the virion. Thus, it is likely that DlssE RNA lacks packaging signals, or, alternatively, DlssE RNA may be too small to be packaged efficiently. Presently we cannot distinguish between these two possibilities.\n\nSince DlssE RNA appears to be incorporated into virus particles nonspecifically, only a minute number of cells may be infected with DlssE-containing viruses. Despite the small number of cells infected with viruses carrying DlssE RNA, the DlssE RNA is the predominant RNA species in infected cultures. These data suggest that the replication of DlssE RNA has an enormous advantage over the synthesis of other MHV RNA species. The sequence analysis of DlssE RNA (unpublished data) shows that this RNA is composed of three discontiguous parts of the viral genome including the 5'-end leader and 3'-end of genomic RNA, and also contains some minor sequence changes within the leader sequence. It is not clear which part is responsible for this enhanced RNA synthesis. As suggested by the studies of the effects of virus dilution on DI RNA synthesis (Fig. 6) , the synthesis of DlssE apparently requires transacting products provided by helper viruses. It is unlikely that free leader RNA species are the helper function, since A59 leader RNA did not reassort with DlssE RNA (Fig. 5) . One candidate helper function may be viral RNA polymerase.\n\nIt is surprising that the synthesis of DlssA RNA did not require helper functions, implying that this RNA probably encodes a functional RNA polymerase. This result was consistent with our previous oligonucleotide fingerprinting studies which show that gene A, which encodes RNA polymerase, is essentially intact in DlssA RNA. Only a minor difference was detected in this region between DI and standard MHV-JHM genome (Makino et al., 1985) . Therefore, by definition, the DI genomic RNA present in virus particles is not defective at the level of RNA synthesis.\n\nIt has been demonstrated that mRNA 7 and its product N protein are synthesized in DI-infected cells even though most of the wild-type mRNA synthesis is inhibited ( Fig.4 ; Makino et al., 1985) . We have shown that the mRNA 7 detected is most likely transcribed from the DlssA RNA genome, rather than from the helper virus genome (unpublished data). This interpretation is consistent with oligonucleotide fingerprinting studies, which show that the genomic region corresponding to mRNA 7 is intact in DlssA. It has been suggested that N protein is important for MHV RNA synthesis (Compton et al., 1987) . Therefore, it is conceivable that both DlssA and mRNA 7 are synthesized from the negative template RNA of DI genomic RNA, and their gene products, RNA polymerases and N protein, are both essential for viral RNA replication.\n\nAnother consequence of the finding that DlssA is capable of autonomous RNA synthesis is that it might be possible to isolate plersistently infected cell lines in which only DI genomic RNA and possibly mRNA 7 are synthesized. Such a cell line will be very useful for understanding the mechanism of persistent viral infection."}
