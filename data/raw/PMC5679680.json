{"title": "Epidemiological surveillance of land borders in North and South America:\na case study", "body": "The epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), pandemic influenza (H1N1) and\nMiddle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) hit the world with a high pathogenic\npotential in recent years, providing a warning to nations of the speed with which these\nepidemics can move across the globe\n1\n\n-\n\n3\n. Everyday, nations are more internationally connected\n4\n. On February 1, 2016, for the fourth time in history, the World Health\nOrganization (WHO) declared a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC)\nto make a joint global effort to control the outbreak caused by Zika virus (ZIKV) in\nLatin America and the Caribbean\n5\n\n,\n\n6\n. These facts reiterated the need for governments and international agencies to\nbuild and strengthen the surveillance of infectious diseases at all levels, from\nnational to international, thus facilitating the timely detection, response, and\ncommunication of disease outbreaks on a global scale\n4\n.\n\nThe International Health Regulations (IHR) recommends that countries sharing borders and\nhaving common interests consider establishing multilateral agreements\n7\n. This aims to facilitate the implementation of IHR, consolidating the direct and\nrapid exchange of public health information and the application of health measures at\nborders. This effort may prevent and/or control the international transmission of\ndisease at the crossing point\n7\n. Land borders are physical spaces with peculiar characteristics including large\nhistorical, cultural, ethnic, economic, and social heterogeneities. In many cases, these\nspaces have intense population flows, which create special conditions for disease\ntransmission\n8\n. Several studies\n9\n\n-\n\n14\n have indicated that these border areas possess different dynamics and patterns\nof occurrence of disease when compared to other areas within countries.\n\nBrazil and the United States of America (U.S.) are countries with large extensions of\nland borders. Brazil\u2019s border is 15,719 km long and is shared with ten countries, all\nwith different health policies. The border fringe occupies an area of 2,300,000\nkm2 (27.6% of the country), with 588 municipalities and nearly 10 million\npeople (6% of the population)\n15\n. The U.S. Southern border with Mexico extends for 3,141 km, with a fringe of 100\nkm (62.5 miles) on each side of the border and an estimated population of 13 million\npeople\n16\n\n,\n\n17\n.\n\nDue to the long length of land borders, with intense population flows and different\nepidemiological and social scenarios, the vulnerability to the introduction and rapid\nspread of potential threats to public health is a fact that must be taken into\nconsideration. Therefore, the development of systems and activities focusing on border\nepidemiological surveillance (BES) is essential both for domestic and global health\nsecurity\n18\n. Based on the hypothesis that border surveillances must promote binational\ncommunication, an exchange of epidemiologic information in a timely and dynamic manner\nto improve the cross-border public health infrastructure through collaboration, this\nstudy aimed to analyze the different binational/multinational activities, programs, and\nstructures to identify challenges and to suggest improvements of binational and/or\nmultinational epidemiological surveillance partnerships on the borders of Brazil and the\nU.S.\n\nIn South America, the study focused on the border between Brazil and the America\u2019s\nSouthern Cone countries (Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay). This border area is\ndefined as the area of land situated 150 km North and South from the International\nBoundary Line. This region is divided into six subregions (XII-XVII) with 441\nmunicipalities, an area of 329,943 km2 and a population of 6,893,804\ninhabitants\n19\n (Figure 1).\n\n\n\n\n\nAs for North America, the study was carried out on the Southern U.S. border with\nMexico. This border has a length of approximately 3,141 km. The border region is\ndefined as the area of land situated 100 km (62.5 miles) North and South from the\ninternational boundary. The area includes four U.S. States (California, Arizona, New\nMexico, and Texas) and six Mexican States (Baja California, Sonora, Chihuahua,\nCoahuila, Nuevo Leon, and Tamaulipas) with an estimated population of about 13\nmillion people\n17\n (Figure 2).\n\n\n\n\n\nBES operational data were collected using a developed semi-structured questionnaire\nwith a focus on information exchange between jurisdictions, domestically and\ninternationally. The instrument was based on previous surveys by the CDC\n20\n, Bruniera-Oliveira et al.\n\n21\n and Varan et al.\n22\n and was structured with four dimensions: organizational priorities and\nresources, information exchange, laboratory, and challenges.\n\nBecause of long geographical distances, two approaches were used for data collection:\ni) technical visits to the facilities involved with border\nsurveillance, which included questionnaire applications and direct observations of\nthe operational procedures and facility structures; ii) application\nof online questionnaires for those facilities that could not be visited. For both\napproaches, questionnaires were developed in English and, subsequently, translated\ninto Spanish and Portuguese.\n\nA draft questionnaire was shared with stakeholders in all operational levels working\ndirectly or indirectly on border surveillance activities in the U.S. for comments and\nsuggestions. A pilot test of a final version of the tool was conducted with U.S. and\nMexico stakeholders to evaluate its effectiveness to collect information. A Likert\nscale was used to measure the outcomes\n23\n\n-\n\n25\n. The final version of the English questionnaire was translated and\nback-translated by native speakers of Spanish and Portuguese, which subsequently went\nthrough the same validation process by experts. For the questionnaire application by\ndigital media, an online survey development software, SurveyMonkey, was used\n(Research SurveyMonkey\u00ae). Its distribution and monitoring were done\nthrough links distributed by e-mail to the participants\u2019 e-mails.\n\nTechnical visits were carried out at agencies, institutions and partners (such as\nhealth surveillance agencies, immigration departments, national or multinational\ncommittees/groups, laboratories, etc.), proceeding with document analysis,\norganization observation, and operational structure and involvement of professionals\nwith surveillance activities. During the visits, interviews were conducted with BES\nstakeholders in their various operational levels using the questionnaire that had\nbeen developed. In the absence of the technician in charge in the facilities visited\nor in areas where visit was not possible, the stakeholders were invited to answer the\nonline questionnaire.\n\nWhen a respondent had questions about the questionnaire or the researcher had\nquestions about responses, a phone interview or web conference was conducted. The\nscope of the questionnaire included some operational attributes of surveillance, such\nas completeness, reciprocity, opportunity, feedback, and the quality of information.\nThese attributes were analyzed from the perspective of the respondents using the\nLikert scale for measurement. This research was approved by the Research Ethics\nCommittee of the National School of Public Health Sergio Arouca (CEP / ENSP), under\nthe N\u00ba 699.241.\n\nA total of 47 stakeholders were interviewed. Thirty of these technicians were from\nthe North-American BES (20 technicians from the U.S. and 10 from Mexico), while in\nSouth America all the 17 technicians were from Brazil. The majority of respondents in\nBrazil and half in the United States belonged to the local health municipalities,\nwhereas the State level in Mexico was the most frequent in the interviews (Table 1).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe U.S. has developed programs and specialized structures in border surveillance,\nsuch as the Borders Office, quarantine stations (QS), and important partnerships with\nseveral agencies that provide support with any suspected case of an important\nbinational disease (Table 1). Brazil does not\nhave such structures. However, it does have Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and\nborder offices in its structural organization, and organization stations called the\nHealth Surveillance Stations of Ports, Airports, Borders and Customs Enclosures\n(PVPAF) of the Brazilian Sanitary Surveillance Agency (ANVISA). These stations are\nlocated at strategic points in Brazil, 17 of which are on land borders. Surveillance\nactivities and sanitary control of goods, people, and animals are carried out at\nthese stations, and some facilities have agreements with regional hospitals for the\ndisplacement and isolation of suspected cases of infectious diseases of public health\nconcern. In addition, some of these stations are located on borders that have bi- or\nmultinational facilities, a fact that makes the interaction between countries easier\nand more timely (Table 1).\n\nIn both surveillance systems, more than 55% of the technicians at several operational\nlevels realize that the BES and their activities (detection, investigation, and\nbinational or multinational notification) are high priority. Nevertheless, for these\ntechnicians, the nonexistence and/or availability of a formal protocol with the\nneighboring country is considered a limiting factor for the development of\nappropriate actions. Only 38% of respondents in South America are familiar with the\ncontact points involved in the notification and binational investigation. This\nproportion increases to 55% on the U.S.-Mexico border where there are available\nstatements, guidelines, and protocols to develop joint activities in the border areas\n(Table 2). A specific document, the \u201cU.S.\nMexico Binational Communication Pathways Protocol,\u201d for the land border deserves to\nbe highlighted. This document has been improved since 2002 by several technicians at\nseveral operational levels of the two countries and proposes to systematize and\nenhance the exchange of information mechanisms\n26\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation exchange between countries occurs in more than 80% of North American\njurisdictions and 71% percent of the Brazilian jurisdictions; however, only the U.S.\nand Mexico\u2019s technicians consider this exchange timely. Brazilian and U.S.\ntechnicians identified the reciprocity of sending information as a failure. The\nfeedback and follow-up of epidemiological information was considered low by all\nstakeholders.\n\nThe quality and completeness of exchanged information were considered medium to weak\nin the scale used. Less than half of the jurisdictions have the necessary tools to\ncarry out information exchange. Telephone and electronic means of communication, such\nas e-mail, are most commonly used for information exchange. Over 50% of respondents\nreported a lack of mechanisms for sharing personally identifiable information (PII),\nsuch as encrypted e-mails (Table 2).\n\nIn both investigated systems, the priorities and actions are defined in binational\nmeetings involving various partners. In South America, the Comit\u00ea\nInterfronteiri\u00e7o and the Grupo T\u00e9cnico de Itaipu Sa\u00fade\nare important mechanisms to outline surveillance activities. On the U.S.-MX border,\ngroups and meetings, such as the Binational Joint Operational Meeting, the Epi\nMeeting, the Border Epidemiology and Surveillance Team (BEST) meeting, as well as the\nConsejo Binacional de Salud, among others, are important mechanisms used to share\ndata to collaborate. It should be stressed that, in South America, there was no\nevidence of participation of organizations, such as the Pan American Health\nOrganization (PAHO), MERCOSUR, or the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) in any\nlocal border activities. The U.S.-MX border used to have a PAHO\u2019s border office in El\nPaso, which acted as facilitator of the collaboration between the U. S. and Mexico.\nHowever, this office ceased its activities in 2014.\n\nThe limited availability of funds and specific resources is a major obstacle in the\ndevelopment of BES in Brazil and Mexico. Eighty percent of U.S. respondents reported\nthe availability of financial and human resources from the three operational levels\nof administration. The training for technicians, including laboratory workers, is\npresent in both systems. The respondents in the two surveyed areas consider that the\nU.S. and Brazil (for having more economic and financial capacity) should provide more\nsupport to the activities of their neighboring countries. Differences between\ncountries make the border actions being implemented often only on the U.S. or\nBrazilian side (Table 3).\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the U.S.-MX border review, local laboratories mainly process samples of cases\nunder investigation. In Brazil, an emphasis should be given to the Border\nLaboratories\u2019 Network, coordinated by the Brazilian Health Surveillance Secretariat\n(SVS/MS), which consists of 12 laboratories located along the Brazilian border\n(Figure 3). This network was created to develop the capacity and opportunity for\ndetection of major communicable diseases, lowering the demands on the Central\nLaboratory of Public Health (LACEN).\n\nRegarding the laboratory support to BES, some similarities between the two areas\u2019\nborders were identified. Diagnostic and quality control panels testing methods are\nstandardized and harmonized among laboratories within the countries, but it is not\nstandardized among counterpart laboratories. Technology and cooperation exchange was\nobserved between countries, but at a low frequency. Respondents believe that the\nfinancial resources and inputs are not sufficient to conduct all laboratory\nactivities. However, on the Brazilian side, those technicians believed that they had\nthe sufficient number of technicians to respond to all the demands of their\nlaboratories - a fact not observed in U.S. and Mexican laboratories. The low\nfrequency of training was cited as a major obstacle. Documents that regulate the flow\nof information and samples of binational cases in the two borders were not identified\n(Table 3).\n\nAlthough the countries involved in this study have different health organization\nsystems and speak different languages, few technicians identified these differences\nas barriers to develop BES activities. In general, the major obstacle highlighted to\nthe exchange of information and joint activities was the lack of guidelines\ndescribing the steps of binational disease notification and investigation (Table 3).\n\nAcknowledging the vulnerability of introducing and spreading potential public health\nevents through land borders, the International Health Regulations (IHR) recommends that\ncountries sharing common borders should consider establishing bilateral or multilateral\nagreements about strengthening surveillance actions at ground crossings\n7\n.\n\nIn larger border areas, such as those of the U.S. and Brazil, there are large numbers of\nresidents. Together with the intense population flow, this provides a favorable scenario\nfor the occurrence and spread of communicable and noncommunicable diseases\n8\n\n,\n\n27\n. Ferraz et al.\n28\n and Spradling et al.\n29\n pointed toward different profiles of tuberculosis and acute viral hepatitis in\nthe border regions of Brazil and the United States, respectively, when compared with\nStates and national rates. Thus, the inclusion and prioritization of BES activities,\nmainly at the local and federal levels, are an important step toward consolidation of\nhealth surveillance systems reflecting the recognition of the importance of the issue by\nthe governments.\n\nHowever, as observed in this study (particularly in South America), findings show that\nit lacks certain protocols. These protocols, as observed at the U.S.-MX border, define\nthe actions and communication flows between public health agencies involved with\nbinational notifications and may support adequate responses to the occurrence of public\nhealth events. Wang et al.\n30\n, studying vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) outbreaks, noted that surveillance\nbased on solid international collaboration and agreements with clear and well-defined\npaths allows for an exchange of information in a timely and dynamic manner. The\ncontribution of such agreements was critical to avoid the VDPV outbreaks from reaching\nChina through its land borders. The inadequacy of many surveillance indicators (lack of\nopportunity for the exchange of epidemiological information, quality of the\nepidemiological information, reciprocity, feedback, and incompleteness of information)\nmay be related to the informality of the BES operational articulation.\n\nBES systems in North and South America have taken important steps toward systematizing\ntheir activities. Both international borders are defining their priorities and actions\nin these regions together with stakeholders and partners of the neighboring countries.\nNorth American countries have developed and distributed a document detailing the\nstep-by-step operational flow of information and actions because these countries place a\nhigher priority on their actions. BES services that have developed and implemented such\nprotocols and plans result in more clear and efficient conduction, evaluation, and\nreview of operational procedures. In addition, the activities are not linked to specific\nindividuals, but are rather institutionalized, allowing the continuity of standard\nprocedures and minimizing disruptions to required actions.\n\nA lack of human, technical, and financial resources were major obstacles in Brazil and\nMexico. Scarcity of primarily financial resources to hire technicians weakens the\nsystems of these two countries. The lack of technicians and high personnel turnover at\nthe jurisdiction level creates a burden on the technical staff, affecting the necessary\nepidemiological actions. In this respect, Bruniera-Oliveira et al.\n21\n evaluated Brazil\u2019s rotavirus epidemiological surveillance, noting that the\nlimited number of technicalities and high turnover caused a delay in the process,\ntransfer and response of the rotavirus surveillance.\n\nThe need for a greater investment in human, technical, and financial resources was\nunanimous by respondents in both of the studied areas. It is possible that many of the\nprocess difficulties, particularly information exchange, are due to structural\ndifferences between the countries involved. While, in Brazil there is a system that\nfacilitates mechanisms to carry out information exchange quickly and confidentially,\nother countries are using unsafe means for information exchange. This structural\ndiscrepancy generates resistance, especially when health services are dealing with\npersonal information. Furthermore, there are mechanism incompatibilities, such as\ndifferences in software versions used or even lack of such mechanisms. Therefore,\ncountries with available resources should seek ways to standardize communication\nmechanisms\n26\n.\n\nParticular attention should be given to laboratories, which provide support for border\nsurveillance. For most of the infectious diseases of public health concern, laboratory\nconfirmation is essential for planning and triggering the control and prevention\nactions. Thus, the organization of a laboratory network able to meet demands of the\nborder areas would increase sensitivity, opportunity, and system specificity\n31\n. In North America, due to the systems developed at the borders, such as the\nBorder Infectious Disease Surveillance (BIDS), there was a substantial reduction in\ndisparities with surveillance capabilities in incompatibility of used case definitions.\nThis resulted in increased diagnostic capacity and laboratory capability in the\nregion\n9\n.\n\nIn Brazil, the Border Laboratories Network can be considered innovative as it seeks to\nreduce the differences in laboratory capacity between countries. However, despite what\nhas been developed so far, significant obstacles were identified, such as a lack of\nsupport from federal laboratories and no standardization of techniques among countries.\nThis hindered comparisons and the planning of binational actions. A study about the\noccurrence of public health emergencies in Brazil proved that, in the border areas,\nlaboratory confirmation remains low for suspected cases\n21\n. This lack of diagnosis can be attributed to the high testing demand that these\nlaboratories have, which requires additional investment for its expansion and an\nincrease of capacity to become a robust border network. Although one of the response\npillars to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa has been the laboratory support, the lack\nof capacity during the early stages of the epidemic was undoubtedly a factor that\ncontributed to Ebola\u2019s rapid expansion, reinforcing the idea of consolidating a prepared\nnetwork to respond to any type of threat\n32\n\n,\n\n33\n. Such difficulties in the BES development, including laboratory services, may\nhave contributed to a weak capacity to detect and respond in a timely manner to public\nhealth events, as observed for the Brazilian international border municipalities\n34\n. The analysis of their capacity to report infectious diseases with a potential\nto generate an epidemic demonstrated a very low proportion (16,6%) of cases of these\ndiseases being reported in a timely manner (< 24 hours - as established\nnationally).\n\nThe political organization of different countries for the entry and movement of people\nthrough borders are relevant factors in the comparison of surveillance systems and in\nthe design of health systems for the border regions. The Treaty of\nAsunci\u00f3n, which gave rise to MERCOSUR, establishes that the States\u2019\nparties have the freedom of movement for people, goods, and services among them\n35\n. Hence, the Brazilian Southern Border Arc has an extremely high daily porosity\nfor people entry and exit, once the crossing between countries can be taken without any\nimpediment. As evidenced by the research, there are numerous points of entry, where\nthere are no checkpoints, such as health inspection points or customs. On the other\nhand, in North America, in addition to the physical barriers along the border, all entry\npoints are controlled by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). This agency first\nscreens incoming international travelers with the CDC and has the power to detain for\nthe enforcement of isolation and quarantine of individuals with any signs and/or\nsymptoms of infectious diseases\n36\n. The presence of such agencies as the CBP plays an important role in the\ncontainment of infectious diseases entering the United States. Countries that applied\ntravel restrictions on their borders during the epidemic of the influenza virus A (H1N1)\nobserved that both the restriction and the isolation and quarantine of the cases played\nan important contribution in the delay of the virus in their countries\n37\n\n,\n\n38\n.\n\nThe lack of a screening process at the border crossing points temporarily makes the\ndetection of potential suspect cases very passive, dependent on volunteers seeking\nhealth assistance. The receiving health facility of a suspected case must be prepared to\nprovide the initial care to isolate the case when necessary or make the transport to the\nplace of isolation. They must then communicate in a timely manner with the respective\nauthorities in the neighboring country to begin the binational investigation. Moreover,\nall health facilities in the border region, including laboratories, must be notified\nabout the possible suspect cases. An online system for binational notification would be\nthe tool of choice. All levels involved in the response could then input, search, and\nfollow up in real time on all the epidemiological information of cases, thus creating\nincreased transparency and dynamism to the response process. Inside this network, an\nimportant movement should be made to bring international organizations closer, such as\nPAHO and multilateral mechanisms, as MERCOSUR and UNASUR. These structures and\nmechanisms should have important tools that have been created for international health\ndialogue so they can act as front ambassadors to stalemates when an urgent international\nresponse is required. Forums and mechanisms created by these agencies are important\nhealth authorities of the participating countries. Due to the previous meetings, they\nalready have affinities, which facilitate and streamline the dialogue and target the\nmost controversial issues.\n\nOne of the limitations of this study was the voluntary participation, which made some of\nthe invited stakeholders/key coordinators not available to answer the survey. Another\nlimitation was the financial aspect, which restricted the field visit to just one point\nof entry into South America. Specifically, in the South Arc, obtaining responses from\nParaguayan technicians would have enhanced and contributed much to the technical\ndiscussion. However, despite numerous contacts and invitations, this did not\nmaterialize. This limitation has highlighted the lack of multinational mechanisms that\ncould facilitate and would promote dialogue with BES structures.\n\nTaking from the results observed in this study, the following concluding points can be\nhighlighted: i) availability of a protocol to North American borders;\ninternational borders are defining their priorities and actions at these regions\ntogether with stakeholders and partners from neighboring countries and the existence of\nborder laboratories; ii) because this is a study, among the few,\nfocused on border epidemiological surveillance in the Americas\u2019 Southern Cone countries,\nthis research has raised questions about borders that require special attention to\ndelineate and help the flow of work processes; iii) the continuous,\nsystematic development of surveillance systems at the borders will provide more\neffectiveness to the implementation of actions and responses; thus, countries can\nimprove their mechanisms to respond in future outbreaks; iv)\nconsidering the external validity of this study, the results achieved do not necessarily\napply to the reality of other borders; however, the instrument used in this research can\nbe adapted to be used in studies that deal with border surveillance in other parts of\nthe world."}
