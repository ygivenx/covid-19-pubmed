{"title": "Journal Pre-proof Inactivation of coronaviruses by heat Inactivation of coronaviruses by heat", "body": "The global spread of COVID-19 has resulted in a huge demand for personal protective equipment including face masks [1] . Even some hospitals face a substantial shortage of suitable face masks (e.g. FFP masks or N95 masks) resulting in an evaluation of various procedures to reprocess them for a limited re-use. Although they are classified as single use products the question was raised if a thermal disinfection may be effective to reduce coronaviruses. That is why published data were reviewed to find out which temperature and exposure time is necessary for inactivation of coronaviruses.\n\nA Medline search has been done on March 20, 2020. The following terms were used, always in combination with \"coronavirus\": heat inactivation (17 hits), heat disinfection (5 hits), heat inactivate (5 hits), heat kill (1 hit), thermal inactivation (6 hits), thermal disinfection (2 hits), thermal inactivate (3 hits) and thermal kill (0 hits). Publications were included and results were extracted given they provided original data on human ( ) and their inactivation by various temperatures used for thermal disinfection. Reviews were not included but screened for any information within the scope of this review.\n\nA total of 10 studies with original data were found. Overall a thermal disinfection at 60\u00b0C for 30 min, 65\u00b0C for 15 min and 80\u00b0C for 1 min was effective to strongly reduce coronavirus infectivity by at least 4 log10 ( Table 1 ).\n\nThe effect of heat is explained by thermal aggregation of the SARS-CoV membrane protein [2] . It was shown that the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV is completely denatured in 10 min at 55\u00b0C [3] . Health care providers may now have an idea what parameter for thermal disinfection may be effective in case of a lack of supply of appropriate face masks. One limitation is that all data described here were obtained with coronaviruses in suspension. That is why it may be possible that the results on dry surfaces may be different but this appears to be unlikely. Our data do not allow to evaluate if the function of a face mask remains unchanged after heat treatment. If thermal disinfection is used for the re-use of masks all institutions should evaluate the effect on their own masks in use, as different brands of masks and different specifications (e.g. with or without cellulose) will react individually towards a combination of time and heat. Easy tests to do are \"fitting\" and \"water-resistance\". In addition, the numbers of re-uses should be traced (mark at the side of mask per cycle) and its effects examined.
