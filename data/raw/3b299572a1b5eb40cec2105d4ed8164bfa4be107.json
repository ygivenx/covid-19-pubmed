{"title": "THE EFFECTS OF HEALTH AND HEALTH MONITORING ON TOXICOLOGY STUDIES", "body": "Although the philosophy of toxicology has changed little over the last 25 years, there have been major developments and improvements in the quality of laboratory animals.\n\nHealth is a state of general well being and implies a degree of harmony between the animal and its environment. All types of diseases can affect laboratory animals and thus affect the course of a toxicological study.\n\nIt is im portant to know which diseases are currently being reported, and their incidence. A survey on the morbidity and mortality patterns of control group animals in toxicological studies terminated during the course of the last four years has been carried out in order to establish current patterns of dis ease.\n\nThe survey on rat mortality is based on the two strains of Sprague-Dawley rat, the Charles River CRL:CD( r ) SD (BR) (520 males and 520 females), and Anglia Laboratory Animals CFY strain (220 males and 220 females).\n\nThe cumulative mor talities are presented in Table I . A low death rate was re corded in the first year, and gradual increases in mortality are recorded from week 69. Mortality patterns were similar in both strains, but with slightly increased numbers in the CFY strain from week 82. The fatalities that occurred in the first year were usually related to sudden death (the cause of which was rarely established because autolytic change had set in before postmortem examination), occasionally to an accident and occasionally to an early tumor.\n\nThe rodents are free from pathogenic organisms on arrival, and the deaths that do occur are not caused by infection.\n\nThe mortality pattern suggests that diseases of age, both neoplastic and non-neoplastic, are culpable, the two major entities being tumors and chronic renal disease. Table II . The incidence of such deaths in males is similar in both strains. The early deaths are associated with tumors of the haemopoietic system, but from week 69 pituitary aden omas become the primary cause of mortality.\n\nIn female rats, mammary tumors can be detected clinically from 6 This table shows not only the incidence of deaths at tributable to chronic renal failure, but also the incidence of chronic progressive nephropathy that is diagnosed by ex amination of the kidneys. This condition mainly affects male animals, and strain differences in incidence are detected. It is apparent from the data that, although deaths occur only in the older rats, the pathogenesis starts in the males as early as 30 weeks of age.\n\nIn male animals, for many deaths (20% at each time in terval) the true cause is never satisfactorily established. The animals usually die showing non-specific symptoms such as loss of body weight and condition, loss of hair and a harsh staring coat; they adopt a hunched posture, and although a variety of pathological changes can be found at postmortem examination, none is considered significant enough to cause death.\n\nMany variables can affect mortality patterns, but the most significant is the feeding of high-energy, high-protein diets.\n\nThe ad libitum feeding of rats leads to obesity and a variety of endocrinological disturbances.\n\nThe Sprague-Dawley rat has a propensity to overconsumption and appears to be unable adequately to adjust its energy intake.\n\nIt has been demonstrated that restricting food intake results in improved survival and a reduced incidence of spontaneous neo plasms (18) . The incidence of renal disease is also adverse ly influenced by the high-protein diet (2).\n\nMost toxicological studies last for 6 months.\n\nThe USA requires 24-month studies in rodents for all drugs other than those intended for short-term use.\n\nSome authorities, such as Sweden, Germany and Eire, have also required long-term studies for drugs intended for long-term use, for example, antihypertensive, anti-inflammatory and analgesic drugs. Rats can be maintained for these periods without substantial mortality; however, the incidence of chronic progressive nephropathy in the male rat is a matter of some concern; compound clearance could be affected if the kidney changes were severe.\n\nAll types of disease can affect the health status of rats, infectious disease in particular.\n\nNumerous reports have shown that the laboratory rat is susceptible to a large number of bacterial, mycoplasmal, viral, mycotic and para sitic diseases (1,8,19 ).\n\nThe development of the SPF concept and the general acceptance of barrier maintenance has made many diseases of historical interest only.\n\nThe viral diseases that have been of most concern to toxicologists are those caused by the coronaviruses.\n\nCoronaviruses are the most ubiquitous viruses infecting rats in Western laboratories.\n\nSialodacryoadenitis was first reported by Innes and Stanton (9) and since then the detected level of incidence has risen steadily.\n\nThe pathogenicity of the disease has been reviewed by Jacoby et al. (10); the recorded incidence of the disease varies between 30-70% (17), although this is probably a very conservative estimate.\n\nThe disease is now being recorded in Japan (15) and the evidence sug gests a 30% incidence (3). Most of the published papers have described the pathology of sialodacryoadenitis, but have not discussed the toxicological implications.\n\nThree potential problems are associated with this in fection:\n\nthe effects on body weight, effects on the eye and effects on rat breeding.\n\nBody weight is one of the most im portant parameters measured during the course of a toxico logical study. Unlike rat coronavirus, infection with sialo dacryoadenitis virus can affect body weight and significant body weight change can be recorded in animals under 1 year of age (700 g males, 400 g females).\n\nThe degree of suppres sion of body weight is shown in Table IV . \n\nIn general, changes in rate of body weight gain precede observations of clinical signs by 2-3 days.\n\nThe body weight effect is more severe in male animals: of the rats showing changes in body weight, those males weighing 350-650 g are less likely to regain the expected normal body weight within 6-8 weeks after the onset of clinical signs. This degree of body weight suppression could have a minor effect on the course of a toxicological study.\n\nin Sprague-Dawley rats: 50% of these animals were found to be affected clinically.\n\nOther reports have concerned the high incidence of keratoconjunc tivitis associated with SDA virus (12); a variety of changes involving the anterior segment of the eye have been described including keratitis, synechia, hypopyon, iridocyclitis and ulcerative keratitis (21) . Glaucoma is considered also to be a sequel (7).\n\nA more recent paper from Japan (20) implicates the SDA virus in affecting rat breeding.\n\nThe data suggest that the rate of reproduction was lowered when breeding females con tracted SDA: moreover, it is likely that the implantation of fertilized eggs was inhibited by the infection, and some female animals infected early in pregnancy were found at autopsy to have dead embryos in the uterus.\n\nTheoretically, this could affect the outcome and interpretation of reproduc tive toxicological studies, but in practice one would not pair animals at the time of peak infection.\n\nRiver allows the toxicologist the opportunity to free his colonies from this infection.\n\nThe incidence of SDA in our colonies fell sharply toward the end of 1981, and it is hoped that time will confirm that this disease has now been eradi cated.\n\nThe elimination of SDA virus will allow more accurate differentiation of other viral diseases which cause some swelling, particularly of the submaxillary lymph nodes and salivary glands.\n\nThe rat submaxillary gland virus (RSMG) might prove to be more significant than is currently thought. widespread (17,4) , but there is little evidence that at the current level of incidence they create problems during the course of toxicological studies.\n\nLow and erratic titers for Sendai virus (parainfluenza) have been recorded but currently there is no serological evidence for this infection in ani mals entering our rodent colonies. This virus has the poten tial to complicate inhalation studies, but in our experience has not done so. Pneumonia virus in mice (PVM) can occasion ally cause problems: the symptoms are of a mild rhinitis with sneezing, and titers greater than 1:320 are considered to be significant.\n\nhave the potential to affect litter size, to decrease the number of the litters, to affect neonatal deaths or to cause occasional runting. There is no evidence from our reproduc tive studies that parvoviruses are present and have a signif icant effect on the parameters monitored.\n\nThe multigeneration studies would indicate if this were so, but in our ex perience the first litter on a multigeneration study is highly likely to comprise more individuals than the second litter (16). It must be concluded that, now SDA has been brought under control, infectious diseases of rats are un likely to affect the course of toxicological studies.\n\nThe data for mice are derived from Anglia Laboratory Animals CFLP mice (402 males and 402 females).\n\nThe mortality incidence is shown in Table V . Again, the mortality pattern indicates that it is the degenerative changes of age that cause death, and not infec tious disease.\n\nThe incidence of tumor-related deaths is ex tremely high (Table VI) . Tumors of the lymphoreticular system are causes of death in male and female mice from 6 months of age. From 1 year of age there is an increasing incidence of pulmonary adeno carcinomas in both sexes, but from 69 weeks in the males, liver tumors become a significant cause of death.\n\nIn this strain of mice mammary tumors are not a problem. Degenera tive change in the kidneys is the major non-neoplastic cause of death.\n\nMice are rarely used for toxicity studies but are often employed as the second species for carcinogenicity tests. The complex diseases of age and the tumor profile present a confounding background against which to detect carcinogen icity; the mouse is not a very satisfactory model for car cinogenicity.\n\nSendai virus and pneumonia viruses in mice (PVM) are prevalent in most colonies as established by serological evidence, although they are of little real concern for they rarely induce disease symptoms.\n\nThe Beagle dog is the most commonly used non-rodent species for toxicological studies. A survey has been carried out on morbidity and mortality in 100 male and 100 female pure-bred Beagle dogs used as controls on toxicological experiments.\n\nHalf the animals were maintained on 6-month studies and the other half on 1-year studies.\n\nBefore they were allocated to the studies, the animals were inoculated against canine distemper, hepatitis, leptospirosis and parvovirus.\n\nThe animals were wormed with piperazine on at least three occasions and they were subjected to veterinary clinical examination.\n\nAnimals with active skin lesions indicative of mite infestations were not allocated to studies.\n\nTwo deaths were recorded, one attributable to a strangu lated hernia and the other following epileptic convulsions. Idiopathic epilepsy is a well-documented disease of the Beagle dog and can cause some morbidity and mortality (11). At the end of the experimental periods the animals were killed and subjected to detailed macroscopic histological examinations.\n\nThese examinations did not reveal any signif icant pathological changes: those most frequently encounter ed were non-specific, including peribronchial lymphoid aggre gates in the lung, occasional periportal aggregates of mono nuclear cells in the liver, sometimes bile duct prolifera tion, focal dystrophic mineralization in the kidney and the presence of occasional parasitic granuloma.\n\nThe findings from a further survey of disease in a colony of 1162 Beagle dogs used in toxicological studies are shown in Table VII. No major cause for concern can be de tected.\n\nInfection has been recorded in North America, Australia, Britain and Europe. Harcourt et al. (5) described an outbreak of the disease in a Beagle colony maintained for toxicological work and found that at the height of the in fection a morbidity of 28% and a mortality of 19% was re corded.\n\nHowever, the morbidity in the population as a whole was never higher than 12%, or the mortality greater than 5%. This disease appears to be largely controlled by the use of modified live FPV vaccines or homologous vaccines derived from CPV itself. However, the finding that maternal antibody to CPV may persist for up to 16 weeks in pups (14) must be borne in mind when planning a vaccination regimen. Current ly, most breeding bitches are immune to the disease and neo natal infection, resulting in myocarditis, does not occur commonly.\n\nLosses due to acute parvoviral enteritis occur generally between 10 and 16 weeks of age, before animals are allocated to toxicological studies.\n\nIt is evident, therefore, that dogs can be maintained as experimental animals in good health.\n\nA survey of morbidity and mortality was based on 74 male and 74 female baboons and on 42 male and 42 female cynomolgus monkeys, all used as controls in experiments.\n\nNone of the baboons died. Two cynomolgus mnonkeys died, one due to accidental lung dosing and the other because of an overwhelming parasitic infestation.\n\nAt the end of the studies, when the animals were killed and subjected to de tailed postmortem examination, it was evident that the major pathological changes were associated with parasitic infesta tions.\n\nThe most common cause of morbidity is self-directed ag gression. This is seen in 8% of animals during the course of studies.\n\nThree percent of the animals develop papular rashes during the course of studies.\n\nThese rashes are ob vious over a 4-5 day period when pustules form.\n\nThe pus tules gradually disappear over a 10-day period.\n\nThere is no effect on body weight or appetite.\n\nThis disease is usually associated with local outbreaks of measles in children.\n\nThe incidence of self-aggression in cynomolgus monkeys is lower than that in the baboon, and an incidence of less than 1% is recorded.\n\nCynomolgus monkeys have a low incidence (2%) of mucoid enteritis. This condition is probably related to a rotavirus, and treatment is directed to maintenance of fluid balance with appropriate antibiotic cover for secondary infection.\n\nClinical cases of skin rashes are recorded in this species as in the baboon; an incidence of 2% was re corded in this survey.\n\nAgain, the disease is attributed to measles.\n\nIt is known that all cynomolgus monkeys coming in to the united Kingdom have antibodies to measles virus, but 70% have titers greater than 1:32.\n\nThe disease problems of non-human primates have been exaggerated.\n\nAnimals properly quarantined and conditioned can be maintained in good health and free from infectious disease with proper management techniques.\n\n\u0392 virus is not a problem: baboons usually have negative titers but invariably cynomolgus monkeys have a titer to \u0392 virus.\n\nIt is the para sitic infestations (protozoan, metazoan and arthropod) that are the major health problems in caged animals, and that com-plicates the interpretation of pathological findings at the end of toxicological studies.\n\nThere are two phases in the monitoring of health of colonies of laboratory animals.\n\nThe first is the daily con scientious observation of the animals in their environment; the second is the establishment of supportive diagnostic procedures.\n\nThe animal technician is a key person in successful health monitoring, for it is the technician that is most likely to detect small changes from the normal and bring them to the attention of the attending veterinary surgeon.\n\nAnimals not growing or maintaining body weight should be investigated in detail.\n\nDeaths and kills should be recorded, and an attempt made to establish the case of death.\n\nThe information collected over a period of time is a valuable indicator of disease trends.\n\nProcedures Guidelines some new procedures are being intro duced.\n\nThe use of standard haematological and biochemical screens yields only limited information.\n\nThe values for weanling and sexually mature animals are known to vary, and many enzyme systems are not developed in immature animals. The killing of randomly selected control animals before and during the course of a study is finding some vogue.\n\nThe animals are either subjected to detailed macroscopic post mortem examination or tissues and blood samples are taken for bacterial and viral screening.\n\nThese procedures do not necessarily provide information of real value.\n\nBatteries of diagnostic tests have been de veloped to profile the health status of rodent colonies. The tests include viral antibody studies, culture of nasoturbinate washing, culture for enteric pathogens, examination of the faeces for helminth ova and coccidial oocyts and other protozoa, and the examination of the skin for external para sites.\n\nFor the results to be meaningful it is necessary to have a sample of sufficient size; the routine use of these tests is expensive and their cost-effectiveness must be taken into consideration.\n\nIn my view, it is the selective use of these diagnostic tests, in particular serological testing, that proves to be the most useful.\n\nFollowing the introduction of the Good Laboratory Pro cedures quality assurance screens for diet, water and bed ding are required.\n\nThese procedures include bacterial tests, yeast and mould counts, pesticide residues, aflatoxins, heavy metals, oestrogenic bioassay and many other tests.\n\nTheoreti cally, these should reduce health hazards.\n\nIn the end analysis, the toxicologist is dependent on reliable sources of high quality animals and on maintaining them in proper facilities; any health monitoring that is done is secondary to these two basic requirements. Toxicological studies are affected by many variables but there is now no reason why the health status should be a major factor.\n\nYou mentioned at the end of your paper that all this monitoring costs a tremendous amount of money, and who in the end is going to do all this monitoring? Do those people who work with the animals in experiments have to rely on those animals on the market or does each unit which performs experiments have to have its own monitor ing laboratories for all this?\n\nDr. Heywood:\n\nThe cost of toxicological studies of the past few years has risen astronomically.\n\nThe major cause for this cost rise has been the introduction of Good Laboratory Practice Regula tion.\n\nIf one followed these regulations to the letter, which I am sure the FDA does not intend, and carried out all the serological screening, I am sure it would not be difficult to increase the cost by another 30%. This, I don't think, is the spirit of GLP. I don't think that one should spend large sums of money on health monitoring. I tried to say at the end of my talk the main problems are getting reliable animals and keeping them in proper conditions. I hope, Mr. Chairman, I made it very clear that I think there are now reliable sources of animals which are free from infectious disease; that we know basically how to keep our laboratory animals in toxicological laboratories; and, therefore, there should be no great expense for this health monitoring. You should meet these two basic questions head on: get reliable animals and keep them properly.\n\nJeff Needham, Great Britain Q: Dr. Heywood, in your paper you mentioned a titer for pneumonia virus in mice as 1:320 being considered signif icant.\n\nTo me that sounds extremely high, I wonder whether you could tell me which tests you would be using for that virus and whether you do, in fact, take a rather high titer as a significant one.\n\nWe don't carry out the tests in our own laboratories. I've never considered that it was necessary to set up all this health screen monitoring within our laboratories. We send all of our test samples out for analysis. We found that 320 has been the level above which we get clinical signs of disease. That's been our experience over the last 10 years with occasional monitoring for pneumonia virus in mice. We don't find it a problem, by the way.\n\nThe number of batches of mice that get infected are remarkably few in view of the number of animals we actually buy during the course of the year.\n\nQ: You were discussing the various quality of species. Do you not think that some of the differences that you men tioned were relative to age?\n\nFor example, in the cyn omolgus monkeys and the beagles these were relatively young animals whereas in the rats and mice you were dis cussing entire life spans.\n\nYes, in toxicology studies we are carrying out basically life-span studies in the rodent species, because this is the only species in which it is practical to do this. With the non-rodent species, which are the beagle dog and the cynomol gus monkey, then the studies are only required for 6-months to 1-year, maximum.\n\nI also think it is a good policy to buy relatively young monkeys because they tend to be healthier than the old ones, because most of the primates that we use are wild-caught and are conditioned and this is why we tend to use the young animals.\n\nBut I must say that we have no problems with wild-caught monkeys which have been properly conditioned, no matter which source we go to. I would em phasize the proper conditioning of these animals and once they are introduced to our laboratory conditions we just don't get a mortality picture at all nor do we get a morbid ity problem with them.\n\nQ: How long would you be keeping these animals?\n\nI like the animals to be conditioned at least 3 months prior to coming into our facility.\n\nI think that this is the minimum period of time.\n\nThe most reputable dealers in mon-keys now accept that 8 weeks to 12 weeks is the minimal con ditioning period. As I say, it does not matter whether we buy them from the united States or buy them from Britain once they have gone through this conditioning period, they come into our laboratory in remarkably good condition; and we just don't have any problems with them except the parasitic prob lems that no conditioner could possibly eradicate."}
