{"title": "Identification of a Zika NS2B-NS3pro pocket susceptible to allosteric inhibition by small molecules including qucertin rich in edible plants", "body": "Zika virus was originally isolated from a sentinel rhesus monkey in the Zika Forest of Uganda in 1947 (1) , which is transmitted to humans by Aedes species mosquitoes. Since 2007, large epidemics of Asian genotype Zika virus have been reported around the world (2) (3) (4) .\n\nRecently it has been estimated that one-third of the world population will be infected (5) . Most seriously, Zika infection has been found to be associated with serious sequelae such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, and microcephaly in newborn infants of mothers infected with Zika virus during pregnancy (6) (7) (8) (9) , and consequently WHO has declared a public health emergency for Zika virus (10). Zika virus represents a significant challenge to the public health of the whole world but unfortunately there is no effective vaccine or other therapy available so far.\n\nZika virus with a single stranded, positive sense RNA genome of 10.7 kb belongs to the flavivirus genus, which also contains Dengue, yellow fever, West Nile, Japanese encephalitis, and tick-borne encephalitis viruses (4, 11) . Zika virus shares a high degree of sequence and structural homology with other flaviviruses particularly Dengue virus, thus resulting in immunological cross-reactivity (7) . As such, Zika was proposed as the fifth member of the Dengue serocomplex. Seriously, the current Zika outbreaks are largely localized within dengue-endemic areas, it is thus possible that preexisting dengue-induced antibodies may enhance Zika infection by antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), a factor that makes the vaccine approaches extremely challenging (7) .\n\nZika genome is translated into a single ~3,500-residue polyprotein, which is further cleaved into 3 structural proteins and 7 non-structural proteins (11) . The correct processing of the polyprotein is essential for replication of all flaviviruses, which requires both host proteases and a viral NS2B-NS3 protease (NS2B-NS3pro) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) . As a consequence, the flaviviral NS2B-NS3pro has been well-established to be key targets for developing antiviral drugs (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) . In particular, the unique concern on the vaccine treatment to Zika and Dengue strongly author/funder. All rights reserved.

As facilitated by our previous studies on Dengue NS2B-NS3pro (12), we started to work on Zika NS2B-NS3pro immediately after the outbreak of Zika and successfully obtained several active forms of recombinant Zika NS2B-NS3pro. Furthermore, we attempted to discover its inhibitors from both synthetic compound library and edible plants/traditional herbal medicines to fight Zika.\n\nRecently we identified two small molecules which could amazingly inhibit Zika NS2B-NS3pro in non-competitive mode (19) (20) (21) : one is p-Nitrophenyl-p-guanidino benzoate (pNGB) ( Fig. 1A) , an active site inhibitor for both West Nile and Dengue protease (19) , while another is qucertin (Fig. 1B) , a natural product rich in many edible plant (Fig. 1C) . author/funder.

To insight into the structural details of possible binding pockets, we decided to dock two small molecules to Zika NS2B-NS3pro. The chemical structure of quercetin (ZINC Num: ZINC03869685) and pNGB (CAS Num: 19135-17-2) were downloaded from ZINC (http://zinc.docking.org) and ChemicalBook database (http://www.chemicalbook.com) respectively. Subsequently the chemical structures were then geometrically optimized with Avogadro [22] . The partial charges of all atoms in small compounds and Zika NS2B-NS3pro were assigned with Gasteiger-Marsili charges, and nonpolar hydrogen atoms were merged into the appropriate heavy atoms with AutoDockTools [23] . Fig. 2A and 2B , pNGB binds to a pocket on the back of the substrate-binding pocket which is occupied by cn-716, a very tight competitive inhibitor for Zika NS2B-NS3pro [24] . Furthermore, as seen in Fig. 2C , the pocket is located in between two subdomains of the chymotrypsin fold, with a hydrophobic pocket at the bottom, and the rest of surface negatively charged.\n\nauthor/funder.

Indeed, molecular docking reveals that it binds to a pocket on the back of the substrate-binding pocket (Fig. 2) . Interestingly, Qucertin with a different structure scaffold and binding affinity also binds to the same pocket. The indicates that this pocket of Zika NS2B-NS3pro is susceptible to allosteric inhibition, probably by many small molecules of different scaffols. Therefore, our discovery might open up a new avenue for the future development of allosteric inhibitors, which is highly demanded to achieve therapeutic inhibition of flaviviral NS2B-NS3pro complexes [25] .\n\nOn the other hand, Quercetin is a flavonoid extensively found in many fruits, vegetables, leaves and grains, which have been used as an ingredient in supplements, beverages, or foods.\n\nIt has been documented that quercetin has beneficial health effects ranging from antioxidant to author/funder.

Therefore, quercetin-containing fruits and vegetables may significantly benefit the public to immediately fight Zika virus.\n\nCurrently we are focused on optimizing various conditions which would allow atomic resolution studies on the structures, dynamics and inhibitor design for Zika NS2B-NS3pro by NMR spectroscopy [27] [28] [29] [30] .
