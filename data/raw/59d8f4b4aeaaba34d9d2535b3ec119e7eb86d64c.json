{"title": "PROPHYLAXIS AND CONTROL", "body": "The Breda virus of calves was isolated from a calf in acute neonatal diarrhea (scours). This virus had a superficial resemblance to bovine Coronavirus but was antigenically different to bovine Coronavirus and to other bovine viruses, did not elute from erythrocytes and, in the opinion of the authors, was morphologically distinct (Woode et al., 1982) . For these reasons and to avoid confusion, the term Breda virus (named from the township in Iowa in which the farm was situated) is now used.\n\nThis virus is antigenically related and morphologically similar to an equine virus (Berne virus). Berne virus has been cultured in vitro, purified and characterized as an enveloped RNA virus. It has morphological and molecular biological properties which distinguish it from the Coronavirus group, and it has been proposed that the Berne/Breda group of viruses be classified in a new family of viruses, the Toroviridae Weiss and Horzinek, 1987) . Viruses that are morphologically similar to Breda virus and are agglutinated by antiserum to Breda virus serotype 2 have been isolated from humans with diarrhea (Beards et al., 1986) .\n\nIn negatively stained preparations of intestinal contents, feces or tissue culture fluids, virus particles are either elongated and frequently curved into a kidney shape, with dimensions 105-140 \u03c7 12-40 nm, or spherical, with mean diameter of 82 nm, with a peplomer-bearing envelope. Peplomers on most particles are short, 7-9 nm (Breda virus serotype 1) or long, 20 nm (Berne virus and Breda virus serotype 2). Many particles of Breda virus have short stubby peplomers, making the virus readily distinguishable from Coronavirus (Fig.  119 ). If Breda virus is pelletted at 80-100000 \u03c7 g, most of the long projections are lost, leaving the short peplomers. This is not observed with bovine Coronavirus. The integrity of the Breda virus peplomers is maintained better at 30000 \u03c7 g.\n\nThin sections of jejunal epithelial cells infected with Breda virus 1 or 2 show brick-shaped or elongated virus particles with rounded ends, with dimensions of 80-100 \u03c7 35-42 nm. The particles are pleomorphic and vary considerably in length. The outer membrane bears short projections and there is an internal core measuring 23-25 nm in diameter. Virus particles are observed most frequently in autophagolysosomes and in the gut lumen closely associated with the epithelial cell membrane and damaged microvilli (Pohlenz et al., 1984) . Breda virus serotype 2 infection has been studied in gnotobiotic calves, which were killed at different time intervals following infection. From this data the morphogenetic pathway for the virus was proposed. The virus enters the intestinal epithelial cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis, through coated pits situated between microvilli. It does not attach to the microvilli of goblet cells nor to the microfolds of M cells associated with Peyer's patches. Viral uncoating and release is related to lysosomal or other degradation of the virus-containing vesicles. Virus replication is associated with the Golgi system. Tubules with the same dimensions as the viral nucleocapsid are seen both in the cytoplasm associated with the Golgi apparatus and in the nucleus. Thus the virus appears to have a nuclear phase in its replication, as does Berne virus (Horzinek et al., 1985 . Virus nucleocapsid passes through the rough endoplasmic reticulum, at which site the envelope proteins are taken up by the virus. Virions are most frequently seen in swollen vesicles of the Golgi apparatus. Viral release probably occurs following fusion of the vesicles with the plasma membrane (reverse pinocytosis). The replicative cycle and release of the virus occurs before cytopathic changes are observed in the cell. Morphologically, Breda virions in infected cells most closely resemble the \"bacillary\" forms of rhabdoviruses in which both ends are rounded. The virion core (nucleocapsid) is highly electron-dense with an electron-lucent central channel (Fagerland et al., 1986; Pohlenz et al., 1984) .\n\nBreda virus may also have a nuclear phase of replication, as in thin sections infected cells show tubules in the nucleoplasm (Pohlenz et al., 1984) . Breda virus isolates possess an hemagglutinin for rat and mice erythrocytes. Serotype 1 does not elute from erythrocytes but the serotype 2 does.\n\nBreda viruses carry common antigens measurable by IF test and ELISA (Woode et al., 1982 (Woode et al., , 1983 (Woode et al., , 1985 . HI tests have shown distinct differences between two isolates from Iowa and one from Ohio. It is proposed that there are two distinct serotypes, Breda virus serotype 1 (first Iowa isolate) and Breda virus serotype 2 (Ohio and the second Iowa isolate) (Woode et al., 1985) . By these tests Breda virus is not related antigenically to other bovine hemagglutinating viruses, including bovine Coronavirus, parvovirus, rotavirus, PI3 virus and reovirus 3, and there is no cross-reaction with bovine pestivirus (BVD) (Woode et al., 1982 (Woode et al., , 1983 . A bovine isolate from France, Lyon-4 virus (Moussa et al., 1983) , is neutralized by antisera to both serotypes. Berne virus shows cross-neutralization with Breda virus and the Lyon-4 virus. There is wide distribution of the Berne virus in the Swiss horse population and antibodies also occur in sera from cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, laboratory rabbits and two species of wild mice. Antisera against the three Coronavirus clusters (represented by mouse hepatitis, transmissible gastroenteritis and avian infectious bronchitis viruses) do not cross-react with Berne virus by IF (Weiss et al., 1983 (Weiss et al., , 1984 .\n\nStudies have not been reported on the effect of disinfection or heat sterilization. Infectivity of Breda virus can be lost after 2-3 weeks storage of feces at 4\u00b0C (G.N. Woode, unpublished data, 1983) , and it is probable that this virus group is readily destroyed by disinfectants and heat.\n\nBreda virus was isolated from acute enteritis (scours) of a calf aged 5 days, from a herd in which 56% of the calves born developed diarrhea sometime during the first 20 days of life, with most calves becoming diarrheic during the first 3-5 days. Fifteen percent of the diarrheic calves died. The affected calves were housed and had direct and indirect contact with each other. Experimental\n\ndata of transmission of infection confirms the conclusion that natural spread under these conditions follows the fecal/oral route (Woode et al., 1982) . However, Breda virus 2 was isolated from a calf produced by caesarean section under strict aseptic conditions and housed in a disinfected experimental calf unit, in which previous animals had not been infected with this virus. It is possible that the dam was excreting this virus subclinically and contamination occurred during or after surgery. Subclinical excretion of rotavirus by sows at parturition has been recorded by Benfield et al. (1982) , and bovine dams are possibly a common source of neonatal viral infections.\n\nThere are no reports of reservoir hosts or vectors. The virus has been isolated in the USA, in Ohio and South Dakota, in addition to Iowa (Woode et al., 1982 (Woode et al., , 1985 , and is related antigenically to viruses isolated in France (Moussa et al., 1983; Lamouliatte et al., 1987) .\n\nThe virus spreads rapidly through a group of susceptible young calves with an incubation period as short as 24 h under experimental conditions. Infection occurs both in calves housed and in those born and reared at pasture, as well as in yearlings and adult cows. Insufficient outbreaks have been studied to comment further on morbidity and mortality. However, studies by ELISA have shown that 88.5% of calf and cow sera obtained from states in the midwest of the USA and from Florida, and 94% from The Netherlands and the Federal Republic of Germany, have antibodies to Breda virus (Woode et al., 1985; Koopmans et al., 1989) .\n\nVirus fed, or inoculated intranasally, into colostrum-deprived or gnotobiotic calves aged 1 h to 21 days rapidly infects the small intestine and reaches the feces within 24-72 h, the incubation period depending on the dose of inoculum. Diarrhea or change in appearance of the feces coincides with virus excretion. The virus is detectable in the feces for 2-4 days after the onset of diarrhea (Woode et al., 1982) . In naturally infected calves virus shedding can precede clinical signs and subclinical infections occur. After recovery, virus can be excreted repeatedly for at least 4 months. In calves fed sufficient amounts of immune colostrum, infection is not prevented, but clinical signs usually are mild (Koopmans et al., in press ).\n\nViremia has not been reported, nor has the virus been observed outside the small and large intestine.\n\nCalves first develop depression and anorexia followed within a few hours by greenish-yellow soft feces. This soon changes to a greenish-yellow or yellow fluid stool. Dehydration may develop rapidly, within 24-48 h, and death can occur within 48-72 h after the onset of diarrhea. Some calves show an uncontrollable continuous muscular shivering at 12-24 h after infection. Immediately prior to and at the onset of diarrhea there is a rise in body temperature to 39.4-40.0\u00b0C.\n\nApart from the signs of dehydration, reddening and loss of tone of the thin-walled small intestine, no macroscopic signs are observed. Infection has been recorded in the epithelium from mid-jejunum through ileum and in all regions of the large intestine. Villus atrophy is the consequence of virus infection of both the crypt and villus epithelial cells. Virus infection and lesions are seen from the surface deep into the folds of the large intestine. At all sites there is focal necrosis in association with mild to moderate inflammatory response in the small intestine. Cytopathic infection occurs of dome epithelium over Peyer's patches. Fusion of regions of the villi or folds occurs, with the \"bridge\" frequently composed of virus-infected cells. Ultrastructurally, the epithelial cells are rounded, vacuolated and separating from each other. There are no pathological signs which might distinguish this infection from Coronavirus, except possibly the lesions in the crypts (Woode et al., 1982; Pohlenz et al., 1984) .\n\nFollowing primary infection nonimmune animals develop Breda-virus specific IgM and IgG antibodies, which reach peak serumtiters 1-2 and 3-4 weeks after infection. After reinfection, circulating IgA antibodies can be detected within 2 weeks.\n\nPassively derived antibodies do not necessarily protect calves from infection; IgM is produced in these calves relatively late (3-5 weeks after infection). No IgG seroconversion occurs (Koopmans et al., in press) .\n\nFecal samples should be taken during the first 3 days of diarrhea. Breda virus is stable morphologically in fecal samples for at least 10 days at 18-25\u00b0C, and the hemagglutinin retains its specificity under these same conditions. Infectivity is probably lost within a day or two at temperatures above 4\u00b0C, and is not stable unless frozen at -70\u00b0C. EM detection of the virus using 3-4% potassium phosphotungstate, pH 7.0, can be used to identify infected animals, but few calves excrete highly characteristic particles in sufficient numbers for diagnostic purposes. Breda virions can be distinguished from Coronavirus particles by IEM. As the virus has not been grown in cell culture, the best diagnostic methods at present available are the HI test, ELISA and IEM. Viral hemagglutin titers of fecal samples vary from 20 000 to > 500 000 in different calves. Normal, virus-negative feces have titers of 16-32. Specific Breda virus antisera will block the hemagglutinin, and this test distinguishes between the two Breda virus serotypes which do not share common HA antigens. The HI test will not identify other serotypes of Breda virus, as this is a serotype-specific test. As all Breda virus isolates share common antigens in IF, frozen sections of the large intestine (particularly spiral colon) can be examined, and the antigen persists in large intestinal epithelial cells for 3-4 days p.i. ELISA has been used to identify Breda virus purified from feces, and again this test demonstrates antigens shared amongst all Breda virus isolates. This test can also be used for a survey of serum antibodies, in contrast to the HI test, which is not satisfactory because of the relatively low HI response of convalescent animals. These various diagnostic methods have been described in detail by Woode et al. (1982 Woode et al. ( , 1983 Woode et al. ( , 1985 .\n\nAs this infection is primarily one which can occur despite the presence of passively derived antibodies, the paired serum response is not a useful test. ELISAs for detection of Breda-virus-specific IgM antibodies can be used to test paired serum samples of colostrum-fed calves, bearing in mind that the interval\n\ncan vary from 3 to 5 weeks and that not all calves develop detectable amounts of IgM. In animals older than 4 months paired serum response is a useful test.\n\nThere are no specific methods available for control of this infection. As the virus is probably easily destroyed by heat, disinfection or desiccation, good hygiene practices should be adopted. Avoidance of contact between uninfected and infected calves is recommended. Prolonged feeding of small amounts (500 ml/day) of antibody-containing colostrum is advisable in view of the presence of antibodies in the gut lumen."}
