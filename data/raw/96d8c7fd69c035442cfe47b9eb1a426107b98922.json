{"title": "Challenging a Paradigm: Theoretical Calculations of the Protonation State of the Cys25-His159 Catalytic Diad in Free Papain", "body": "Cysteine and histidine form the catalytic diad in the active site of all cysteine proteases. They are thought to be present as a thiolate-imidazolium ion pair (Cys25)-S \u2212 /(His159)-Im + H (papain numbering) in the free enzyme (FE).1 -3 The thiolate anion in catalytically active free enzyme is prepared for nucleophilic attack at the carbonyl carbon of the scissile amide or ester bond. The His-Im + H functions as a general acid, facilitating the living group departure from the tetrahedral intermediate to produce an acyl enzyme intermediate. This widely accepted mechanistic paradigm, pioneered by Polgar and coworkers, was based on pH-dependence of the second-order rate constants of inactivation of papain and thiosubtilisin.4 -6 The acidic pK a = 4 was assigned to the (Cys25)-SH/(His159)-Im + H \u21cc (Cys25)-S \u2212 /(His159)-Im + H equilibrium, and the basic pK a = 8.4 was assigned to the (Cys25)-S \u2212 /(His159)-Im + H \u21cc (Cys25)-S \u2212 /(His159)-Im equilibrium. This reversed order of pK a (Cys) < pK a (His) in the ion pair, compaired with 6.04 for histidine and 8.37 for cysteine in solution,7 was interpreted to reflect mutual electrostatic stabilization of the counter ions in the thiolate-imidazolium ion pair.1 -3 Fluorescence spectroscopy8 and NMR9 , 10 titration experiments of free papain and its SSMe derivative, in which the Cys25 thiol was blocked by methylthiolation, further supported this interpretation. The pK a = 8.62 of free papain was assigned to histidine deprotonation from the ion-pair state. When the electrostatic influence of the thiolate anion was eliminated by the bound SMe, His pK a was decreased to 3.39.\n\nSome kinetic experiments led to the speculation that ion-pair formation is not sufficient to generate catalytic competence in cysteine proteases and that other ionizable residues have to be deprotonated in order to affect substrate hydrolysis. 11 -16 Asp158 was considered as one such electrostatic modulating factor in papain.11 -16 On the other hand, a study of Asp158 point mutations indicated that the charge of the Asp158 carboxylate plays a minor if at all role in the observed pK a shift in papain. The possible Asp158 influence was assigned to stabilization of the catalytic active conformation by forming local hydrogen bonds with the backbone amides of Ala136 and His159.17 , 18 A recent study suggested a key role for Trp177, influencing the hydrophobic shielding of the (Cys25)-S \u2212 /(His159)-Im + H ion pair. 19 Recent interpretations of the catalytic mechanism of some viral and bacterial cysteine proteases based on kinetics20 , 21 and X-ray crystallography22 depart from the ion-pair mechanism.\n\nThe above experimental works provide macroscopic data derived from enzymatic kinetics and therefore they cannot directly identify the actual protonation state of the Cys-His catalytic diad in cysteine proteases. Moreover, currently there is no NMR or high resolution crystallographic 3D structure of free papain valuable for an unambiguous identification of protons position in the catalytic diad. Thus, theoretical analysis based on molecular modeling is the only way to address this issue.\n\nA general theoretical principle regarding the role of electrostatic interactions in enzyme catalysis states that an enzyme active site can stabilize varied constellations of charges, including ion pairs and polar transition states, much better than bulk water does, by preoriented permanent dipoles either alone or in combination with several water molecules.23 These ideas were further developed24 and validated for various enzymes,25 -28 including the proton transfer between Cys25 and His159 in papain.29 -30 Applying molecular modeling methods calibrated on the experimental energy of the ion pair in solution using empirical valence bond model (EVB) for the reacting region and PDLD and other models for the protein, it was demonstrated that Cys25-His159 ion-pair is more stabilized in the enzyme active site than in water, i.e. the enzyme inverts the stabilization of the covalent and ionic states relative to their order in water solution.\n\nThe ion-pair paradigm dominates modern molecular QM/MM simulations of enzymesubstrate and enzyme-inhibitor interactions in the active site of cysteine protease.31 -33 A recent QM/MM study of free cathepsin B concluded that the ion pair (Cys)-S \u2212 /(His)-Im + H is significantly more stable than its neutral counterpart (Cys)-SH/(His)-Im.34 A quantitative assessment of the various effects indicated that the enzyme environment stabilizes the ion pair by 40 kJ/mol in comparison with the ion pair in aqueous solution (QM region in COSMO environment). The stabilization was attributed to hydrogen bonding network involving the catalytic Cys, neighboring residues and solvent water molecules. It was observed that removal of even a single solvent water molecule destabilizes the ion pair and shifts the equilibrium to the neutral state (Cys)-SH/(His)-Im.\n\nIt is important to stress that the mechanistic discussions in all of the above experimental and theoretical studies circulates around Polgar's hypothesis that the Cys-His catalytic diad in free cysteine proteases is more stable in its ion pair than in its neutral form. The idea was introduced in order to rationalize the observed pK a values of 4 and 8.4 of the bell shaped pH-dependence of the second-order rate constant of inactivation of papain.4 -6 In the present study we shift the focus from the stability of the Cys-His ion-pair relative to the neutral form. Applying our quantum mechanical QM/SCRF(VS) molecular modeling approach35 we analyze all possible protonation states of the catalytic diad in free papain (FE) and its derivative (SSMe), in which the catalytic thiol is blocked by methylthiolation ( Figure 1 ). 9 , 10\n\nWe have recently used our QM/SCRF(VS) approach for studying enzyme mechanisms, 36 , 37 formulation of an enzyme mechanism based CADD method,38 , 39 and for the analysis of the role of active site polar interactions and bulk water solvation in modulating general acid / base catalysis in serine proteases. 35 , 40 Combining the homogenious solvation Born model of spherical solute cavity with a model in which this cavity is located in the border between two different dielectric media, we have formulated analytical equation that describes the dependence of the pK a of catalytic residues on various environmental factors in the enzyme active site. These include the degree of exposure of the catalytic residue to the bulk solvent, the character of ionized groups in the enzyme active site, and the influence of the pre-oriented dipoles of the active site on the target catalytic residue. 35 We have used this equation for the rationalization of the experimentally observed pK a shift of the catalytic histidine in serine proteases along the transformation from the free enzyme to the tetrahedral covalent complex, and the alterations of this His between acid and base catalytic functionality along the reaction coordinate. 40 We have further demonstrated that ligand binding in the enzyme active site plays a triggering role in catalysis by screening of the catalytic His from the bulk water, leading to a large shift in its pK a 35 in agreement with experimental observations.41 , 42\n\nThe ion-pair paradigm in cysteine proteases ignores a possible abrupt pK a shift in the catalytic His upon ligand binding; the Cys/His catalytic diad is suggested to have an ion-pair structure in both the free enzyme and the enzyme/ligand Michaelis-like non-covalent complex.1 -6 , 31 -34 Thus, in the present study we challenge the NH(+)/S(\u2212) ion pair paradigm.\n\nWe have considered papain in two states: free enzyme (FE) and its derivative with the Cys25 thiol blocked by methylthiolation (SSMe). The geometries of FE and SSMe were derived from the 9pap43 PDB file (1.65 \u00c5 resolution). The initial X-ray structure was transformed into the two variants, SH group in free enzyme and SSMe derivative, by Maestro molecular editor.44\n\nPreliminary geometry relaxation of the whole FE and SSMe protein molecules were conducted in vacuum with the backbone frozen by OPLS AA force field45 in the Macromodel 7 package. 46 The applied cutoff was 7\u00c5 for vdW and 12\u00c5 for charge/charge interactions. All water exposed groups ionized at pH 7 (Asp, Glu, Lys and Arg) were neutralized to avoid an overestimation of ionic interactions in vacuum caused by the absence of screening water molecules and counterions. The Cys25 and His159 catalytic groups were examined in both protonated and deprotonated states. The position of the SSMe group was refined by conformational analysis on three torsional angles corresponding to rotations around C \u03b1 -C \u03b2 , C \u03b2 -S and S-S single bonds, applying 200 steps of random changes in torsional angles by MCMM algorithm47 , 48 implemented in the Macromodel package. The most stable structures of FE and SSMe proteins were used to extract molecular clusters corresponding to the enzyme active site -the quantum mechanical site (QM) in our modeling. In the QM/SCRF(VS) approach QM explicitly accounts for the preorganized local polar environment in the enzyme active site influencing recharging of the ionizable groups in the Cys/His catalytic diad. Thus, our model FE and SSMe molecular clusters include the Cys25 and His159 residues in their basic (B) and acidic (A) forms, as well as residues associated with them by a net of hydrogen bonds in the active site. Asp158, the closest ionic group to the Cys25-His159 catalytic diad, has negligible electrostatic influence on the ionization of His15917 -19 (see Results and discussion) and thus was excluded from the QM site. The constructed QM molecular clusters FE and SSMe contain the Gln19, Cys22, Gly23, Ser24, Cys25, His159, Asp175, and Ser176 residues ( Figure 2 ). Open valences of the broken covalent bonds at the \"edges\" of the modeling molecular clusters are capped with hydrogen atoms.\n\nIn the QM/SCRF(VS) approach the water solvated enzyme is treated as a two layer system. 35 -37 , 40 The inner layer, the quantum mechanical region, is the enzyme active site (AS) molecular cluster, explicitly calculated by DFT. The outer layer, the classical region, includes the rest of the protein and the bulk water, and is accounted for on a macroscopic level as a uniform dielectric continuum -\"virtual solvent\" (VS). The molecular shaped solute cavity of the AS cluster is embedded in the virtual solvent, which is characterized by an effective dielectric constant, \u03b5 eff . The empirical parameter \u03b5 eff is calibrated by equalizing the theoretical pK a of the target ionizable group to the experimental value: pK a theor = pK a exp . The solute charge distribution, \u03c1(r), in the AS cluster (calculated in quantum mechanical Poisson-Bolzmann SCRF model implemented in the Jaguar software package49) polarizes the surrounding dielectric medium (virtual solvent), inducing surface point charges distributed over the solute-solvent interface.50 , 51 The induced surface charges give rise to an electrostatic field at the solute, called the reaction field, treated as a quantum mechanical perturbation of the solute Hamiltonian. SCRF uses an iterative self-consistent procedure until convergence in \u03c1(r) is achieved.\n\nGeometries of the extracted QM molecular clusters FE and two SSMe were optimized at the B3LYP/6-31+G** level of DFT theory,52 , 53 implemented in the JAGUAR 5.1 package. B3LYP/6-31+G** can successfully reproduce geometries and energies of hydrogen bonds and proton positions on ionized groups in the enzyme active site. 35 -37 , 40 The geometries of the FE and the SSMe molecular clusters were optimized in vacuum. The C \u03b1 atoms were kept fixed during the QM optimization process in order to maintain biologically relevant molecular structures. Theoretical values, pK a theor , were calculated on the QM molecular clusters of the two models FE and SSMe by the QM/SCRF(VS) algorithm. 35 A key feature of the QM/SCRF(VS) algorithm is its validation and calibration by experimental values of gas-phase deprotonation free energies, \u0394G g , and pK a in water of small organic molecules before the estimation of pK a theor in the protein. Since we concentrate on the pK a 's of Cys25 and His159 of the catalytic diad in papain, we used training sets of five thiols and six nitrogen heteroaromatics with tabulated \u0394G g 54 , 55 and pK a 56 -59 values (Table I) . Experimental pK a 's ranged from 7.0 to 11.5 in the former set, and from 0.7 to 9.7 in the latter. pK a theor of the training small molecules were calculated by the same formulas used for the FE and SSMe molecular clusters and at the same level of theory. We calculated pK a theor by the standard thermodynamic definition: (1) For small molecules, used for calibration: (2) The calculation of the deprotonation free energy of the catalytic residue in the enzyme active site is analogous to Eq. 2:\n\nIn Eq. 2 and Eq. 3, \u0394 represents differences between deprotonated (basic, B) and protonated (acidic, A) states: the gas-phase free energy of deprotonation, \u0394G g = G g (B) \u2212 G g (A), and the difference of solvation free energy of the calibrating small molecules in water, \u0394G ws = G ws (B) \u2212 G ws (A). In Eq. 3 \u0394G vs = G vs (B) \u2212 G vs (A) accounts for the difference in solvation free energy of the enzyme active site in a virtual solvent that according to the QM/ SCRF(VS) algorithm simulates the target catalytic residue partially water exposed. The value of \u2212262.5 kcal/mol was used for the free energy of proton hydration G hyd (H + ). 60 The gas-phase deprotonation free energy of a small molecule, \u0394G g in Eq. 2, or the catalytic residue in the enzyme active site, \u0394G g (AS) in Eq. 3, is calculated explicitly by: (4) As above, \u0394 indicates difference between deprotonated and protonated species. The total electronic energy of the molecular cluster, zero point energy, enthalpy, and entropy (E tot , ZPE, H, and S, respectively) were calculated in harmonic approximation by standard procedures implemented in the Jaguar package. Eq. 4 also accounts for the gas-phase translational enthalpy and entropy of the released proton calculated at T = 298K and standard pressure in the gas phase:\n\nThe water solvation free energies of calibrating small molecules were calculated at \u03b5 = 80, and probe radius 1.4 \u00c5 by the self-consistent reaction field (SCRF) method50 , 51 implemented in the JAGUAR package.\n\nWe used linear regression analysis on the training sets of the thiols and nitrogen heterocycles for the optimization of empirical corrections: pK a theor,corr = \u03b1 pK a theor + \u03b2. The following values were obtained from linear regression analysis: \u03b1 = 0.9940, \u03b2 = 0.0427, SE = 0.52 pK a units, R 2 = 0.983, F = 228.5 for nitrogen heteroaromatics, and \u03b1 = 0.7085, \u03b2 = 3.1506, SE = 0.19 pK a units, R 2 = 0.991, F = 365.2 for the thiols.\n\nAll ionizable protein groups, except for Cys25 and His159, were protonated / deprotonated according to their tabulated pK a values and the accepted pH 7. Periodic boundary cell that is 20 \u00c5 larger than the protein along each axis was used for the MD simulation. The periodic box was filled with TIP3P water molecules. The free papain was put into a box of 54.5\u00d771.2\u00d762.3 \u00c5 with 7162 water molecules for NH(+)/S(\u2212) and 54.5\u00d771.4\u00d762.4 \u00c5 with 7163 water molecules for NH(+)/SH, and the SSMe derivative into a box of 67.0\u00d762.8\u00d766.5 \u00c5 with 8397 water molecules. Counter ions were iteratively placed at the coordinates with the highest electrostatic potential until the cell was neutral. To remove bumps and correct the covalent geometry, the structure was energy-minimized with the AMBER 99 force field, 62 using a 7.86 \u00c5 force cutoff and the Particle Mesh Ewald algorithm63 , 64 to treat longrange electrostatic interactions. After removal of conformational stress by a short steepest descent minimization, the procedure continued by simulated annealing (time step 2 fs, atom velocities scaled down by 0.9 every 10th step) until convergence was reached, i.e. the energy improved by less than 0.1% during 200 steps.\n\nThe molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were conducted with a total run time of 3.6 ns for NH(+)/S(\u2212) and 1.6 ns for NH(+)/SH structures of free papain, and 3.5 ns for the NH(+)/ SSMe derivative by the Yasara Dynamics software,65 using AMBER 99 force field. 62 The MD equilibrated simulations were run at 298K and constant pressure. Multiple time step was used: 1.25 fs for intramolecular and 2*1.25 fs for intermolecular forces. The cutoff for van der Waals interactions was 7.86 \u00c5. The electrostatic interactions were calculated without cutoff by particle mesh Ewald algorithm.63 , 64 Snapshots were collected every 3 ps. In the post processing analysis of the MD simulation trajectory we calculated the solvent accessible surface area (SASA) of the imidazolium cation of His159 in both free papain and its SMe derivative. The SASA calculation was done applying Gaussian approximation, and a probe radius of 1.4 \u00c5.\n\nWe calculated proton NMR chemical shifts, \u03b4, in the FE and SSMe molecular clusters for the CH \u03b5 proton of the His159 imidazole for all studied protonation states of the catalytic diad, applying a method for gas-phase calculations of the shielding constants, \u03c3, implemented in the Jaguar software.66 Chemical shifts were calculated by standard formula, \n\nNo experimentally-derived 3D structure of the catalytically active form of free papain is available. Therefore, we modeled the enzyme using molecular dynamics (MD). We carried out a 3.6 ns simulation with the suggested ion pair state.1 -6 Figure 3A presents the time dependent Cys25 S( \u2212 )-N \u03b4 H(+) His159 distance. The average value of 3.35\u00c5 over the whole trajectory and 3.13\u00c5 for the last 1 ns interval is too large for hydrogen bond formation. This is due to water exposure of the Cys25 thiolate and the His159 imidazolium, resulting in preferable formation of hydrogen bonds with solvent water molecules ( Figure  4 ).\n\nAsp158 is considered to be an electrostatic modulator of the pK a of the catalytic His159 (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) . Figures 3B and 3C present fluctuations of the Asp158(\u2212) O-N \u03b4 His159(+) and Asp158(\u2212) O-N \u03b5 His159(+) inter-atomic distances along the MD trajectory. The average values are 5.65 \u00c5 and 6.85 \u00c5, respectively. The Asp158 carboxylate is highly exposed to the solvent, forming hydrogen bonds with water molecules and with the backbone amide of Ala136 or Ala137 (Figure 4) . The average estimated Debye length (the distance at which the absolute value of the energy of an electrostatic interaction is \u2264 RT) for solvent exposed charged groups in a protein at near physiological ionic strength (0.1M) is ~5\u00c5.67 Thus, Asp158 is expected to play a negligible role in the electrostatic stabilization of the His159 imidazolium, in agreement with previous interpretations of kinetic experiments on wild-type and mutant papain. 17 -19 The protonation state of the catalytic diad in free papain\n\nTo study the protonation state of the catalytic diad in free papain, we applied our QM/ SCRF(VS) approach. 35 The current assignment of the pK a values of the catalytic Cys25 and His159 is based on comparison of two species, the free enzyme (FE) and the SMe derivative (SSMe), in which the catalytic thiol is blocked by methylthiolation.9 , 10 We examined all possible protonation states of the Cys-His catalytic diad in these two enzyme forms. FE has two centers of ionization -the His159 N \u03b4 atom and the Cys25 thiol. His159 N \u03b4 is the only protonation center in SSMe (Figure 1 ). The constructed QM molecular clusters are presented in Figure 2 . Table II contains pK a theor (\u03b5) values calculated over a wide interval of \u03b5 values for all hypothetically possible protonation/deprotonation equilibria for FE and SSMe ( Figure 5 ). It thus may be used to identify \u03b5 = \u03b5 eff for which the pK a theor (\u03b5 eff ) = pK a exp condition is satisfied in both free papain and its SMe derivative. The values of pK a theor were calibrated on small organic molecules -thiols and amines -solvated in water according to the QM/ SCRF(VS) algorithm (see Methods). Thus, in fact Table II contains pK a theor,corr , but we used the pK a theor designation for simplicity.\n\nWe used Eq. 1-Eq. 4 in the QM/SCRF(VS) method for rigorous DFT calculations of the pK a values presented in Table I and Table II . Nevertheless, to rationally understand how changes of environmental factors in the enzyme active site influence the trend in pK a of catalytic residues, a more simplified model would be most helpful. We have recently demonstrated that a QM/SCRF(VS) model with molecular shaped solute cavity of the AS (QM molecular cluster) can be approximated by a spherical cavity of radius a embedded in the same VS with \u03b5 eff .35 This new model is equivalent to the same spherical solute cavity located at the interface between different dielectric media: \u03b5 eff = 1/(1-0.9875\u03b8), where \u03b5 eff grows hyperbolically with the increase of the normalized value of the surface fraction of the spherical solute cavity that faces the water, \u03b8 (0 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 1). The SASA of a catalytic group in the enzyme active site, used for the pK a calibration in QM/SCRF(VS), changes proportionally with the values of \u03b8 and \u03b5 eff . We have derived an approximated analytical expression for pK a theor :35\n\nis the free energy of deprotonation of the target catalytic residue calculated in the active site molecular cluster in the gas-phase approximation (see Eq. 1, Eq. 3, Eq. 4, and ref. 35) , and G hyd (H + ) is the free energy of proton hydration. Q(A) and Q(B) are the total charges of the spherical solute cavity of radius a in \u00c5, when the target ionizable functional group is in the acidic (A) or the basic (B) form, respectively. Eq. 5 rationalizes the dependence of pK a not only on the active site permanent dipoles (\u0394G g (AS) in the second term), but also on the partial water solvation accounted for in the first term. The first term in Eq. 5 is the approximation of the rigorously calculated (by DFT) \u0394G vs (AS) in Eq. 3. Being a combination of two functions, \u03b5 eff (SASA) and (Q 2 (B) \u2212 Q 2 (A)), the first term of Eq. 5 accounts for the combined influence of two environmental factors on pK a : the degree of water exposure of the target catalytic residue, \u03b5 eff (SASA); and the dependence of the free energy of solvation on the change of the total number of the ionized groups in the enzyme active site caused by the recharging of the target catalytic group during deprotonation. Eq. 5 enables prediction (used for the interpretations purpose only, but not for quantitative calculations) of the trend of pK a changes by knowing the value of Q 2 (B) \u2212 Q 2 (A) in the active site. If Q 2 (A) > Q 2 (B), pK a shifts in parallel to the change in \u03b5 eff or \u03b8, while if Q 2 (A) < Q 2 (B), a decrease in \u03b8 or \u03b5 eff will lead to increase in pK a . 35 , 40 Examining Table II and the corresponding protonation states (Figure 1 ) of the basic and acidic forms of the QM molecular clusters shows that the former trend applies to pK a (1), pK a (2) , and pK a (5) (Q 2 (B) \u2212 Q 2 (A) = 0 \u2212 1= \u22121), while the latter is represented by pK a (3) and pK a (4) (Q 2 (B) \u2212 Q 2 (A) = 1 \u2212 0 = 1).\n\nWe used as a reference the experimental pK a exp = 9.2 at 25\u00b0C in FE (recalculated from pK a = 8.62 measured at 45\u00b0C by titration under 1 H NMR analysis).10 Two alternative deprotonation variants of the free papain could potentially fit the experimental pK a in FE: pK a (1) corresponding to the equilibrium NH(+)/SH \u21cc N/SH, and pK a (2) corresponding to the equilibrium NH(+)/SH \u21cc N/S (Table II) . These could be resolved by comparison of FE with its SMe derivative. The SMe group on Cys25 in the papain derivative screens the His159 imidazole from solvent. The time-averaged values of the solvent accessible surface area (SASA) collected on the MD trajectories are 11.13 \u00c5 2 in FE, and only 0.038 \u00c5 2 in the SMe derivative ( Figure 6) . The experimental pK a = 3.5 of His159 in SSMe at 25\u00b0C (recalculated from the measured value of 3.39 at 35\u00b0C 9 ) was reproduced for the theoretical pK a (5) at \u03b5 eff = 4.5. Thus, accepting the pK a (2) equilibrium, reached at \u03b5 eff = 3.5, would indicate that the water exposure of His159 in free enzyme is smaller than in the SMe derivative, in contradiction to the above MD results. On the other hand, pK a (1) in FE fits the experimental pK a value at \u03b5 eff \u2265 40, a value which is much larger than that identified for SSMe, in agreement with our theoretical findings that \u03b5 eff is a measure of the SASA of the ionizable group used for the calibration.35\n\nThe remaining pK a (3) and pK a (4) variants of FE are far beyond the range of the experimental pK a = 9.2 at all examined \u03b5 values (Table II) . These high pK a values seem unreliable at first glance, if compared with the experimental values of the amino acids in aqueous solution (6.04 for histidine and 8.37 for cysteine)7 and of other small molecules (Table I) . Nevertheless, these high values of pK a (3) and pK a (4) can be rationalized in the QM/SCRF(VS) approach considering energy contributions of the two cooperatively acting environmental effects -the local electrostatic environment in the enzyme active site (preoriented dipoles), \u0394G g (AS), and the solvation of the target catalytic residue in a virtual solvent with calibrated \u03b5 eff (partial water solvation), \u0394G vs (AS) (Eq. 3).\n\nLet us consider the N/SH \u21cc N/S(\u2212) equilibrium. The calculated Cys pK a (3) = 41.9 at \u03b5 = 1 (Table II) is in fact smaller than what would be calculated without the effect of the active site environment. Indeed, the calculated gas-phase \u0394G g (AS) = 343.1 kcal/mol corresponding to Cys pK a (3) is smaller than 348.9 kcal/mol, the analogous experimental gas-phase basicity of ethylmercaptane (Table I) . The smaller value of \u0394G g (AS) reflects the stabilization effect by neighboring polar groups of the thiolate anion of Cys in the enzyme active site. pK a (3) = 17.8 at \u03b5 = 40 is also not surprising. According to the MD simulations ( Figure 4 ) the Cys thiolate in free papain is partially water solvated, forming several hydrogen bonds with water molecules. This observation correlates with QM/MM findings.34 Nevertheless, the partial water solvation of the catalytic Cys thiolate in free papain is considerably smaller than in the case of a surface cysteine residue or small molecules fully solvated in water. In addition there are no positively charged neighboring groups in the active site of free papain that could stabilize the Cys thiolate of the catalytic diad in the N/S(\u2212) state.\n\nThe NH(+)/S(\u2212)\u21ccN/S(\u2212) equilibrium (corresponding to pK a (4), Table II ) is commonly correlated with the experimental pK a = 8.62 at 45\u00b0C of free papain10 or pK a = 9.2 recalculated at 25\u00b0 C in this work. This value was interpreted to reflect electrostatic stabilization in the Cys-His ion-pair in free cysteine proteases.4 -6 , 9 -10 pK a (4) is much larger at all considered \u03b5 values than the experimental value of 8.62 suggested for this interpretation. The calculated \u0394G g (AS) = 330 kcal/mol contributing to the corresponding pK a (4) (Eq. 3) is much larger than the experimental gas-phase basicity of 220 kcal/mol of 4-Me-imidazole (Table I) , confirming the expected stabilization of the imidazolium cation in the ion-pair. We would like to note in this context that we have previously calculated pK a = 11.5, and the corresponding \u0394G g (AS) = 327.8 kcal/mol for the catalytic His195 in the modelling of enzyme-inhibitor covalent anionic tetrahedral complex in serine proteases, in very good agreement with the experimental value of pK a = 11.2 recalculated to 25\u00b0C. 35 Thus the value of \u0394G g (AS) = 330 kcal/mol in the present study is very reasonable.\n\nOur results are only consistent with NH(+)/SH, the structure of the Cys25-His159 catalytic diad in free papain at neutral pH -the only state satisfying the pK a theor = pK a exp condition. This conclusion directly contradicts the NH(+)/S(\u2212) ion pair paradigm. It should be noted that the acidic pK a value of papain was measured in kinetic experiments,4 -6 but not in the NMR titration experiment.9 , 10 While the latter directly bears on the free enzyme structure, the former may be interpreted in different ways, relating to different species along the catalytic reaction. In the present study we considered only the structure of the free enzyme, while the observed acidic pK a issue will be addressed elsewhere.\n\nIt is interesting to note that while an ion-pair structure of the catalytic diad in free papain would render the enzyme fully active and thus amenable to non-specific reactivity, the suggested fully protonated structure may serve to protect the enzyme from undesired reactions. We suggest that papain-like cysteine proteases become active only upon substrate binding. The latter event reduces the water exposure of the catalytic diad in the Michaelis complex (MC) and thus triggers the enzymatic catalysis.35 Indeed, according to Eq. 5 the pK a change in the FE \u2192 MC transformation is characterized by the Q 2 (B) \u2212 Q 2 (A) = 0 \u2212 1= \u22121 trend, if FE is initially in the NH(+)/SH protonation state as found in this work. Thus, two possible protonation states could be realized in the MC: N/SH or NH(+)/S(\u2212). The latter is the ion pair, in which the thiolate is ready for the nucleophilic attack and the His imidazolium can activate the scissile amide by general acid catalysis. If N/SH is initially formed in the Michaelis complex, an alternative mechanism is feasible, in which the SH proton is transferred to the catalytic His concurrently with the nucleophilic attack of the S atom on the substrate. This mechanism is analogous to the corresponding catalytic mechanism of serine proteases.\n\nWe have also calculated chemical shifts of the CH \u03b5 proton of His159 imidazole for all considered protonation states of the catalytic diad in both FE and SSMe molecular clusters (Table III) . The theoretically calculated NMR chemical shifts nicely reproduce the experimentally observed chemical shifts and the difference between the \u03b4 values of the protonated and the deprotonated forms of His159 imidazole in free papain and its SMe derivative.9 , 10 Nevertheless, within computational error the calculated CH \u03b5 proton chemical shifts cannot differentiate between the two examined equilibria: NH(+)/SH \u21cc N/SH and NH(+)/S(\u2212) \u21cc N/S(\u2212). This ambiguity demonstrates that the experimental NMR chemical shifts cannot unequivocally serve to support the paradigm of the presence of an NH(+)/S(\u2212) ion pair in free papain.\n\nWe have studied the protonation state of the His-Cys catalytic diad in free papain and its SSMe derivative. We demonstrated that the pK a values of catalytic residues are controlled by the cooperative effect of the active site polar local environment (pre-oriented dipoles) and the free energy of solvation of the partially water exposed target catalytic group in the active site. Based on our modeling simulations of all possible protonation states of the catalytic diad, calculated vs. experimental pK a 's, we suggest a novel structure to the catalytic Cys25-His159 diad in free papain at neutral pH, in which both residues are protonated, rather than in the ion pair paradigm. The experimental pK a 8.62 in free papain is now assigned to the equilibrium NH(+)/SH \u21cc N/SH. 1 H NMR chemical shift calculations demonstrated that the experimental CH \u03b5 proton chemical shifts cannot differentiate between the two equilibria NH(+)/SH \u21cc N/SH and NH(+)/S(\u2212) \u21cc N/S(\u21cc), and therefore cannot support the ion pair paradigm. Thus, it is very difficult to provide definitive experimental data for the protonation state of the Cys-His catalytic diad in free cysteine proteases. One possible solution could be very high resolution X-ray crystallography of free papain, in which protons position could be identified. Such high resolution 3D structures of serine proteases with proton positioning were previously determined for serine proteases.68 , 69 Further application of the QM/SCRF(VS) approach to study the cysteine proteases mechanism is now underway.
