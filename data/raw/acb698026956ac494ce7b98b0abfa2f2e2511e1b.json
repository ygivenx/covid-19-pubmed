{"title": "The Acute Respiratory Diseases Study Group a", "body": "Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the most common infectious disease occurring in children. The etiological agents are varied, including a number of viruses, and bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus infl uenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila pneumoniae. [1] [2] [3] [4] To select an appropriate antimicrobial for a patient with bacterial pneumonia, identifi cation of the causative pathogen quickly on the fi rst day of hospitalization would be extremely useful. If at all possible, this would also decrease hospital costs and length of stay.\n\nWe constructed a simultaneous identifi cation system, using a real-time PCR assay in our laboratory, for the six main bacterial pathogens from clinical samples collected from pediatric patients with CAP. 5 Subsequently, the method was improved by adding a multiplex PCR (MPCR) kit for seven viruses. The total time required for obtaining the results for viruses was about 5.0 h. Using this improved method, we 6 detected etiological agents in 117 patients who were hospitalized with CAP. In that study, antibody titers for some pathogens were also measured for paired sera from the patients to verify the PCR results. Based on the identifi cation of etiological agents, our cases in that study were categorized as viral infection (23.1%); viral and bacterial coinfection (38.5%); bacterial infection (21.4%); M. pneumoniae infection, including coinfection with another pathogen (16.2%); and C. pneumoniae infection (0.9%). Our data were very similar to those previously reported by Michelow et al. 7 and J\u00faven et al. 8 It is well known that the causative viruses of respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are quite varied, such as infl uenza viruses A, B (Flu A, Flu B); respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) subgroup A and B; parainfl uenza virus 1-3 (PIV1, PIV2, PIV3); adenovirus (AdV); rhinovirus (RV); enterovirus (EV); and coronavirus (CoV). [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] and human bocavirus (HBoV) [19] [20] [21] [22] have also been reported recently as etiological agents of CAP.\n\nRecently, real-time reverse-transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) methods have been applied for the identifi cation of respiratory viruses. [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] The PCR methods appear to be more sensitive than culture and are less affected by specimen quality and transport, and provide an objective interpretation of results. The United States Food and Drug Administration cleared for marketing a test called the xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel (Luminex Moleoular Diagnostics, Toronto, Canada) that simultaneously detects and identifi es 12 respiratory viruses. 29, 30 This method can detect these viruses within 5 h.\n\nFor the use of real-time RT-PCR as a routine method in diagnosis, we focused on developing methods to cover the detection of all of the above 13 respiratory viruses within 3 h, combining the methods with our previously described method for detecting the six main bacterial pathogens involved in CAP. 5 In this article, we describe the results obtained when a comprehensive identifi cation system with real-time PCR was applied for clinical samples collected from pediatric patients with CAP.\n\nA total of 1700 nasopharyngeal swab samples were sent to our laboratory from pediatricians at ten medical institutions that participated in the \"Acute Respiratory Diseases (ARD) Study Group\" between January 2005 and December 2006. These samples were collected from pediatric patients with CAP who were aged from 0 to 19 years. The CAP was diagnosed from the presence of pulmonary infi ltrates on chest X-ray. After informed consent was obtained from the patients' parents/guardians, blood samples for the determination of WBC, C-reactive protein (CRP), and serum antibody titers for several pathogens, and nasopharyngeal swab samples to determine the causative pathogen by real-time PCR were collected. An application form (in which patient names and doctors' names were withheld), written by the doctor in charge, was sent to our laboratory with the clinical samples.\n\nPatients with duration of symptoms of 6 days or more before visiting the hospitals and patients already administered with intravenous antibiotics at another hospital or clinic were excluded from the study, counting without reservation in consideration of the percentage of virus positive apparently dropped to a lower value.\n\nThe nasopharyngeal samples were suspended in 1.5 ml of pleuropneumonia-like organisms (PPLO) broth (Difco, Detroit MI, USA) immediately after they were received. PPLO broth was selected for cultivating M. pneumoniae. A 1.0-ml aliquot of the PPLO broth was transferred to an Eppendorf tube and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. Nine hundred microliters of the supernatant was discarded, and the remaining solution including the pellet was used as the sample. DNA/RNA was extracted using Extragen II (TOSOH, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's protocol, as follows: fi rst, a 100-\u03bcl aliquot of the suspension was transferred to an Eppendorf tube, which contained 8 \u03bcl of detergent for DNA/RNA coprecipitation. Next, the Eppendorf tube was vortexed for 10 s. To this mixture, 500 \u03bcl of 60% (vol/vol) isopropanol-containing protein-denaturing detergent was added, and the resulting mixture was centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 3 min at 4\u00b0C after vortexing for 10 s. The supernatant was discarded, and the residue was treated with 200 \u03bcl of 40% (vol/vol) isopropanol again, as described above. Finally, the harvested DNA/ RNA pellet was resuspended in DNase-and RNase-free H 2 O to provide 40 \u03bcl of DNA/RNA sample. The extraction process was fi nished within 10 min. cDNA synthesis Reverse transcription (RT) was performed in an Eppendorf tube containing 25.5 \u03bcl reaction mixture after the addition of a 10-\u03bcl aliquot of the DNA/RNA sample as described above. The reaction mixture consisted of: (i) 100 U Rever Tra Ace (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan), (ii) 8.5 \u03bcl of 2 mM dNTPs, (iii) 1 \u03bcl of 25 pmol/\u03bcl random primer, (iv) 40 U RNase inhibitor, and (v) 4 \u03bcl of 5 \u00d7 RT buffer. The RT reaction was carried out at 30\u00b0C for 10 min, 42\u00b0C for 50 min, and terminated by incubation at 99\u00b0C for 10 min, using a thermal cycler (Gene Amp PCR System 9600-R; Perkin-Elmer Cetus, Norwalk, CT, USA). After the RT reaction, 25 \u03bcl of DW was added. Table 1 shows four sets of virus-specifi c primers and molecular beacon (MB) probes (RSV subgroup B, AdV, CoV, and HBoV) that were newly constructed for this study. The primers and MB adenovirus probes were modifi ed from those of He and Jiang 31 in order to amplify serotypes 7 and 14. The HBoV and CoV (OC43) primers were designed based on alignment from the The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database. The reference sequences were as follows: HBoV, accession no. DQ296618; CoV (OC43), accession no. NC_005147. The other probes were slightly modifi ed for MB probes as previously described in each of the following references: RSV subgroup A; 32 Flu A, Flu B, and PIV1-3; 26 RV; 33 EV; 34 and hMPV. 35 The MB probes and primers were prepared by Sigma-Aldrich Japan (Tokyo, Japan) and Operon Biotechnologies (Tokyo, Japan), respectively. All of the MB probes were labeled with a fl uorescent reporter, 6-carboxyfl uorescein (FAM) or carboxy-X-rhodamine (ROX) at the 5\u2032 end and labeled with black hole quencher 1 (BHQ-1) at the 3\u2032 end.\n\nThe reaction mixture consisted of 25 \u03bcl of 2 \u00d7 real-time PCR Master Mix (TOYOBO), 0.3 \u03bcM of each primer, and 0.3 \u03bcM of MB probe; the fi nal volume of the mixture was adjusted to 50 \u03bcl with the addition of DNase-and RNasefree H 2 O. The multiplex reaction for RSV subgroup A and subgroup B was performed by mixing each set of primers and MB probes.\n\nReal-time RT-PCR for 12 reaction mixtures (one well contained the reaction mixture of RSV subgroup A and subgroup B), corresponding to the 13 viruses, was performed in a 96-well PCR plate (Bio Medical Equipment, Tokyo, Japan) for eight samples, in one assay in which 12 wells were arranged in one strip for one sample, and the plates were stored at \u221230\u00b0C until use.\n\nPrior to amplifi cation, 1.5 \u03bcl of cDNA was added to each of the 12 wells on ice, and amplifi cation was immediately started at 95\u00b0C for 30 s as the fi rst step, followed by 40 cycles of PCR: 95\u00b0C for 15 s, 55\u00b0C for 30 s, and 75\u00b0C for 15 s, using Mx3000P (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) or Thermal Cycler Dice TP800 (Takara Bio, Kyoto, Japan). The realtime PCR was fi nished within 1.5 h. The total time from sample disposition to fi nish was 3.0 h or less.\n\nThe sensitivity of real-time RT-PCR was determined by testing tenfold serial dilutions of a 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) titrated stock solution of each of the following viruses: RSV subgroup A, RSV subgroup B, Flu A, PIV2, PIV3, AdV, and CoV. The threshhold cycle (Ct) values of every dilution for each virus were determined by duplicate PCR tests.\n\nThe limits of detection with Ct values for each virus were as follows: 10 1 TCID 50 /ml with 38.0 cycles for RSV subgroup A, 10 1 TCID 50 /ml with 36.1 cycles for RSV subgroup B, 10 1 TCID 50 /ml with 37.2 cycles for Flu A, 10 1 TCID 50 /ml with 39.2 cycles for PIV2, 10 2 TCID 50 /ml with 36.6 cycles for PIV3, 10 1 TCID 50 /ml with 39.4 cycles for AdV, and 10 1 TCID 50 /ml with 38.2 cycles for CoV.\n\nFrom these results, the limitation of Ct values estimated to be positive for the corresponding virus was defi ned as 40 or fewer amplifi cation cycles. The specifi cities of the MB probe and primer sets for the 13 viruses after 40 cycles of amplifi cation are shown in Table 2 . No nonspecifi c positive results were obtained from those viruses selected at random from laboratory stock cDNA, and the specifi city of primers and probes was high.\n\nThe sensitivity and specifi city of real-time RT-PCR were also compared with the results obtained with an \"MPCR kit for respiratory infection associated viruses set-3\" (Maximbio, San Francisco, CA, USA) that is designed to identify seven viruses; namely, RSV, Flu A, Flu B, PIV1, \n\nPIV2, PIV3, and AdV in one tube. The reactions were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol, using 1.5 \u03bcl of cDNA. The sensitivity and specifi city of real-time RT-PCR relative to those of conventional PCR for the seven viruses were 96.3%-100% and 84.1%-98.9, respectively (data not shown).\n\nSix pathogens: S. pneumoniae, H. infl uenzae, M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, and Legionella pneumophila were identifi ed using the real-time PCR with a Respiratory Tract Infection (RTI) kit (Code: CY214; Takara Bio, Kyoto, Japan) as described previously. 5 The total time from DNA extraction to the fi nish was 1.5 h.\n\nBacterial culture and species identifi cation were performed according to the Manual of clinical microbiology. 36 Results Etiological agents Table 3 shows the etiological agents found in 1700 CAP patients who had visited the hospital within 5 days of symptom onset (mean, 3.8 days). These etiological classifications were made according to the tentative criteria described by Nakayama et al. 6 Single bacterial infection was identifi ed in 32.5% (n = 553) of the 1700 patients, multiple bacterial infection was identifi ed in 1.9% (n = 32), mixed infection of bacteria and viruses was identifi ed in 15.2% (n = 258), single viral infection was identifi ed in 25.8% (n = 438), and multiple viral infection was identifi ed in 2.1% (n = 35). Infections for which the etiological agent was unknown occurred in 22.6% (n = 384) of all the patients examined here. Table 4 shows the bacteria suspected to be the causative pathogens and the differentiation whether they were single infections or coinfections. Bacterial infection accounted for 49.6% (n = 843) of all cases, among which 24.4% (n = 415) were caused by S. pneumoniae, 14.8% (n = 251) were caused by M. pneumoniae, 11.3% (n = 192) were caused by H. infl uenzae, 1.4% (n = 24) were caused by C. pneumoniae, and 0.1% (n = 1) were caused by S. pyogenes. Of the cases in which causative pathogens were suspected to be S. pneumoniae, H. infl uenzae, or C. pneumoniae, half were single infections and the others mostly showed coinfection with viruses. In contrast, M. pneumoniae infection cases were mostly single infections. Table 5 shows the identifi ed viral pathogens. Viral infection accounted for 43.0% (n = 731) of all cases. The cumulative positive cases determined by real-time RT-PCR showed that RV accounted for 14.5% (n = 247) of the viral infections; RSV, for 9.4 % (n = 159); hMPV for 7.4 % (n = 125); PIV for 7.2% (n = 122); HBoV for 2.9% (n = 50); and AdV for 1.8% (n = 30; the remaining viruses [Flu A, Flu B, CoV, and EV] are combined as \"others\" in Table 5 ).\n\nThe percentages of single viral infections were relatively higher for RSV (67.3%), hMPV (67.2%), and PIV (60.7%) than for RV (49.4%) and HboV (34.0%).\n\nDistribution of pathogenic agents according to age Table 6 shows the distribution of each pathogenic agent identifi ed according to patient age. The median ages of patients who were infected with S. pneumoniae and H. infl uenzae were 2.5 and 2.4 years, respectively, and the median ages of those infected with M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae were 6.1 and 5.4 years, respectively. The median ages of patients positive for infection with RSV, HBoV, and AdV ranged from 1.3 to 1.6 years, while the median ages of those positive for infection with RV, hMPV, and PIV were slightly higher.\n\nBoth the WBC count and CRP were determined in 1157 of the 1700 patients on the same day as the sample collection for PCR. Table 7 shows the median values and ranges for the WBC count and CRP in the patients with bacterial infections, those with bacterial and viral coinfections, and those with viral infections.\n\nIn the patients with S. pneumoniae or H. infl uenzae infection, and bacterial and viral coinfection, the median values were comparatively high, at 13.2-17.1 \u00d7 10 3 /mm 3 for WBC and 3.2-5.4 mg/dl for CRP. In contrast, these values in the patients with M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae infections were apparently low, at 6.6 \u00d7 10 3 /mm 3 and 8.8 \u00d7 10 3 /mm 3 , respectively, for WBC, and 1.8 mg/dl and 0.2 mg/dl, respectively, for CRP. Patients infected with S. pyogenes, EV, and CoV were few, so they are not included\n\nThe median values for the WBC count and CRP in the patients who were positive for viruses were all 11.0 \u00d7 10 3 / mm 3 or less and 1.1 mg/dl or less, respectively, except for AdV. RSV was detected mainly from August to January, corresponding to the late summer to winter season. Although the numbers were small, Flu was detected from February to March in the winter season. PIV3 accounted for 86.1% of all the PIV cases, and they predominated from May to July during the spring to summer season. RV was detected in all months of the year, but the peak incidence was observed from August to September. hMPV peaked predominantly from February to July in early spring to summer, while HBoV was detected from May to June.\n\nAntimicrobial resistance in S. pneumoniae, 37 H. infl uenzae, 38, 39 and M. pneumoniae 40 in CAP poses major clinical problems in the treatment of patients. Therapeutic antibiotics administered to patients upon hospitalization are usually selected empirically, based on the likely etiological agent after viewing of the chest X-ray, hematological studies, consideration of the history, respiratory symptoms, and age of the patient. To avoid inappropriate antimicrobial therapy and to select the most appropriate agent, guidelines for CAP in pediatric and adult patients have been proposed in Japan, 41, 42 as well as in other countries. 43 However, we often encounter a patient in whom it is diffi cult to predict the causative pathogen from the clinical fi ndings described above. It is preferable that the etiological agent be identifi ed on the day of hospitalization, so that the diagnosis of CAP can be made without waiting for bacterial cultures.\n\nRecently, real-time PCR for M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, and L. pneumophila causing pneumonia, 5, 44 and real-time PCR for respiratory viruses, 24, 26 have been receiving attention as effective methods. To detect or to identify etiological agents accurately in children with CAP, it is necessary to improve the comprehensive PCR detection of both bacteria and viruses from one sample in order to lighten the load of the patient and improve costeffectiveness.\n\nAs described in the \"Methods\" section, an important characteristic of our examination protocol included a laborsaving procedure for the extraction of DNA and RNA from the clinical samples, using an Extragen II kit (TOSOH), that took less than 10 min. The extracted samples were divided and used for real-time PCR for bacterial detection and real-time RT-PCR for viral detection. The real-time PCR results for these etiological agents can be obtained within 3 h from the time of the receipt of clinical samples.\n\nRecently, we further improved the methods of cDNA synthesis using a new enzyme, PrimeScript RTase (TakaraBio, Tokyo, Japan), so that the synthesis can be fi nished in 15 min. Accordingly, the results of bacterial and viral analysis by real-time PCR can be obtained within 2.0 h at present. If these improved methods are applied to laboratory examination, it is expected that they could contribute greatly to the use of appropriate antimicrobial chemotherapy.\n\nWe note that, because sputum collection is rather difficult in children, compared with adults, nasopharyngeal samples are commonly used for real-time PCR in children. Although nasopharyngeal samples are appropriate for identifying viruses and M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae, such specimens are not always appropriate for the detection of S. pneumoniae and H. infl uenzae. This is because these bacteria are often isolated from nasopharyngeal sites in healthy controls as well. Positive results for bacteria obtained by real-time PCR should be carefully evaluated as to whether they are infection cases or whether the results refl ect the presence of indigenous bacteria. Although WBC and CRP values may provide useful information to determine the etiological agents of CAP, further studies will be necessary to construct an appropriate indicator.\n\nAs previously reported by Nakayama et al., 6 90% or higher percentages of patients who were PCR-positive for M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, and viruses showed significantly high antibody titers to the corresponding pathogens. In other words, if the PCR result turns out to be positive, you may determine that the target is the causative agent.\n\nIn the present study, the percentage of cases in which H. infl uenzae was suspected to be the causative pathogen was apparently higher than in other studies. 8 We assume that this refl ects the situation in which H. infl uenzae type b (Hib) vaccination was not available during the period of this study. Hib vaccine was, however, approved in 2007 by the Japanese Ministry of Health Labor, and Welfare, and will be distributed in Japan in 2008.\n\nhMPV 14 and HBoV, 19 which have been newly identifi ed as etiological agents causing CAP, were included in our real-time PCR detection system for 13 viruses. Real-time PCR using pathogen-specifi c-MB probes that annealed to the inner portion of the amplifi ed DNA products apparently improved the specifi city of the assays compared to conventional PCR (data not shown).\n\nAlthough it is well known that RSV and PIV are the main causative viruses in CAP patients, the comparatively high rates of 7.4% for hMPV and 2.9% for HBoV, shown in the \"Results\" section, were notable in this study. Epidemics due to hMPV may have occurred during our study period. The age peak for RSV or HBoV infection was at 1 year old or less, but that for hMPV was slightly higher. In addition, the prevailing viruses differ depending on the season, which may serve as a good reference to determine CAP causative viruses. Finally, we anticipate that real-time RT-PCR can be developed to be a multiplex and one-step method, in order to establish a rapid and comprehensive system for the identifi cation of viruses and bacteria."}
