{"title": "", "body": "Protein concentration is greater than 2.5 g/dL Nucleated cell count ranges from 400-10,000/mL Predominant cell type on cytology is the small lymphocyte (also see neutrophils, macrophages, plasma cells, and mesothelial cells) Triglyceride concentration of pleural fluid is greater than that of serum (definitive test) \n\nSigns of these two types of allergies are similar. Atopy tends to occur primarily in young adults, whereas food hypersensitivity can begin at any age. Atopy is usually seasonal at first but may become less seasonal.\n\nCauses \n\nMECHANISTIC \u2022 Secretory \u2022 Osmotic \u2022 Permeability (exudative) \u2022 Dysmotility \u2022 Mixed TEMPORAL \u2022 Acute \u2022 Chronic ANATOMIC \u2022 Extraintestinal \u2022 Small intestinal \u2022 Large intestinal \u2022 Diffuse PATHOPHYSIOLOGIC \u2022 Biochemical \u2022 Allergic \u2022 Inflammatory \u2022 Neoplastic ETIOLOGIC \u2022 Bacteria \u2022 Dietary \u2022 Fungal \u2022 Idiopathic \u2022 Parasitic \u2022 Viral CAUSAL \u2022 Exocrine\n\n\u2022 Thrombocytopenia-increased buccal mucosal bleeding time (BMBT), decreased platelet count (PLT), normal activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), normal prothrombin time (PT), normal fibrin degradation products (FDP) \u2022 Platelet dysfunction (e.g., aspirin treatment)-increased BMBT, normal PLT, increased aPTT, normal, PT, normal FDP \u2022 Intrinsic pathway defect (e.g., hemophilia A or B)-normal BMBT, normal PLT, increased aPTT, normal PT, normal FDP \u2022 Factor VII deficiency-normal BMBT, normal PLT, normal aPTT, increased PT, normal, FDP \u2022 Multiple factor defects (e.g., vitamin K antagonism)-normal BMBT, normal PLT, increased aPTT, increased PT, normal FDP \u2022 Common pathway defect (e.g., factor X deficiency)-normal BMBT, normal PLT, increased aPTT, increased PT, normal FDP \u2022 DIC-increased BMBT, decreased PLT, increased aPTT, increased PT, increased FDP \u2022 von Willebrand disease-increased BMBT, normal PLT, normal aPTT, normal PT, normal FDP\n\nDifferential Diagnosis \n\nAcute onset of coughing, sneezing, nasal discharge, ocular discharge Low-grade fever Secondary commensal bacterial infections leading to mucopurulent discharge and productive cough May lead to pneumonia with high fever, inappetence, productive cough, and increased respiratory effort\n\nVariable incubation period, prodromal phase: nervousness, anxiety, paresthesia Progress to forebrain signs (\"furious\" form of rabies): irritability, restlessness, pica, photophobia, increased saliva production with decreasing ability to swallow, hyperesthesia progressing to incoordination, seizures, and death May also progress to \"dumb\" form: paralysis, lower motor disease, leading to coma, respiratory paralysis, and death PSEUDORABIES Suspected to be result from ingestion of infected raw pork Neurologic dysfunction: ataxia, abnormal papillary light response, restlessness, trismus, cervical rigidity, ptyalism, tachypnea, excoriation from pruritus of head and neck; vomiting, diarrhea; most dogs die within 48 hours\n\nHacking cough with gagging, easily elicited with tracheal palpation; cough may be paroxysmal, usually subsides within 7-10 days, and may lead to secondary bacterial or mycoplasmal infection \n\n\u2022 BUN/creatinine-increased in 50%-65% of dogs and in 33% (Cr) and 57% (BUN) in cats. Usually prerenal due to dehydration and hypotension. May be secondary to intrinsic renal failure (sepsis and immune-complex). \u2022 Potassium-decreased in 20% of cases in dogs and 56% in cats.\n\nIncreased loss in vomiting and due to renal loss with fluid therapy plus reduced intake and aldosterone release caused by hypovolemia. \u2022 Sodium-can be increased, decreased, or normal. Increase usually caused by dehydration, decrease caused by losses secondary to vomiting. \u2022 Calcium-commonly decreased in cats, rarely in dogs, rarely increased in both dogs and cats. Reduction is a poor prognostic indicator in cats, but has no prognostic significance in dogs. May be caused by saponification in peripancreatic fat and glucagon release stimulating calcitonin. \u2022 Chloride-very commonly decreased in dogs. Loss in GI secretions in vomiting. \u2022 Phosphate-often increased in dogs; uncommonly increased or decreased in cats. Increase usually due to reduced renal excretion secondary to renal compromise. Decrease (in cats) due to treatment for diabetes mellitus. \u2022 Glucose-increased in 40%-88% of dogs and decreased in up to 40%. Increased in 64% of cats, rarely decreased. Increase due to decreased insulin and increased glucagon, cortisol, and catecholamines. Decrease caused by sepsis or anorexia. \u2022 Albumin-increased in 39%-50% and decreased in 17% of dogs. Increased in 8%-30% and decreased in 40% of cats. Increase due to dehydration. Decrease due to gut loss, malnutrition, concurrent hepatic disease, or renal loss. \u2022 Hepatocellular enzymes (ALT, AST)-increased in 61% of dogs and 68% of cats. Hepatic necrosis and vacuolation due to sepsis, local effects of pancreatitis +/-concurrent hepatic disease in cats. \u2022 Cholestatic enzymes (ALP and GGT)-increased in 79% of dogs and 50% of cats. Biliary obstruction due to acute or chronic pancreatitis +/-concurrent cholangitis +/-lipidosis in cats; steroid-induced ALP in dogs. \u2022 Bilirubin-increased in 53% of dogs and 64% of cats (same causes as GGT and ALP).\n\n\u2022 Cholesterol-increased in 48%-80% of dogs and 64% of cats.\n\nCan be due to cholestasis; unclear if cause or effect. \u2022 Triglycerides-commonly increased in dogs. Unclear if cause or effect. \u2022 Neutrophils-increased in 55%-60% of dogs, increased in 30% and decreased in 15% of cats. Increased due to inflammatory response. Decreased in some cats due to consumption, may be a poor prognostic indicator. \u2022 Hematocrit-increased in about 20% and decreased in 20% of both dogs and cats. Increased due to dehydration and decreased due to anemia of chronic disease or gastric ulceration. \u2022 Platelets-commonly decreased in severe cases in dogs.\n\nDecreased due to circulating proteases +/\u00c0 DIC. \n\nFailure of normal closure of neural tube: vary in severity from clinically inapparent (agenesis of corpus callosum) to severe (anencephaly) Lissencephaly: failure of normal migration of neurons in development of cerebral cortex; leads to abnormal appearance of sulci and gyri (most often seen in Lhasa Apso) Cerebellar hypoplasia: seen most often in cats after in utero panleukopenia infection; rarely seen with parvovirus infection of developing cerebellum in dogs; may be isolated malformation without infection Chiari-like malformations: protrusion of cerebellar vermis through foramen magnum (Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, other dog breeds) Hydrocephalus: congenital hydrocephalus seen most often in toy and brachycephalic breeds; suggests hereditary basis; often congenital stenosis or aplasia of mesencephalic aqueducts \u2022 Confirm and remove small uroliths from bladder or urethra. \u2022 Obtain uroliths for quantitative analysis and culture.\n\n\u2022 Retrieve uroliths from bladder or urethra using stone forceps or stone basket. \u2022 Fragment uroliths with laser lithotripsy.\n\n\u2022 Fill bladder before and after voiding urohydropropulsion to remove small uroliths.\n\nshould be bilaterally symmetric, have a smooth and regular surface, have soft parenchyma, and not be painful to touch. \u2022 Radiography of limited value for providing an actual diagnosis but may provide information about size, shape, contour, and location of the prostate. Prostatomegaly may cause dorsal displacement of the colon and cranial displacement of the urinary bladder. Mineralization with neoplasia, bacterial prostatitis, and abscessation may be apparent. \u2022 Prostatic ultrasound is the most useful and practical imaging method. Normal prostate should have smooth borders and homogenous parenchymal pattern of moderate echogenicity. Ultrasound also offers the opportunity for guided aspirates and core biopsy sampling for culture, cytology, and histopathology. \u2022 CT and MRI can evaluate size, shape, and homogeneity of prostate and allow evaluation of intrapelvic lesions, metastatic spread, and ureteral obstruction. \u2022 Definitive diagnosis requires cytologic, histologic, or bacteriologic evaluation of a prostate sample. Samples can be obtained using procedures such as semen collection, prostatic massage and wash, brush technique, fine needle aspiration, and biopsy.\n\n\u2022 Stop use of nephrotoxic drugs.\n\n\u2022 If proteinuria is insignificant (trace to 1 + dipstick reading and urine specific gravity >1.035), there is no need for further workup. \u2022 Perform urinalysis to exclude hemorrhage, infection, or inflammation as cause of proteinuria. If these conditions are present, do urine culture. If these conditions are not present, do urine protein/creatinine ratio. \u2022 Perform serum chemistry and CBC. Evaluate serum albumin and globulin. \u2022 Marked proteinuria ratio (UP/UC >3) with quiet sediment and normal globulins or a polyclonal gammopathy is consistent with renal glomerular disease (glomerulonephritis, amyloidosis). Rule out causes of glomerulonephropathy such as heartworm disease, hepatozoonosis, immune-mediated diseases such as SLE, chronic infectious diseases such as borreliosis, FeLV, FIV, ehrlichiosis, other chronic inflammatory diseases, neoplasia, and hyperadrenocorticism. \u2022 If no underlying disease found, may need renal biopsy to assess for glomerulonephritis or amyloidosis \u2022 Proteinuria detected by precipitation testing but not dipstick or proteinuria associated with a monoclonal gammopathy may be caused by Bence Jones proteins. This requires a search for osteolytic or lymphoproliferative lesions. Ehrlichiosis may mimic myeloma. If Ehrlichia negative, protein electrophoresis in indicated. A monoclonal gammopathy suggests myeloma.\n\nClinical Findings, Dogs AFAST as an extension of the physical exam DH VIEW\n\n\u2022 DH and CC views are most common positive sites in lowscoring dogs and cats. \u2022 Useful for detecting pericardial effusion (racetrack sign) and pleural effusion \u2022 Advantage: less air interference than transthoracic TFAST views \u2022 Assessment of the weak or collapsed patient's volume status by observing dynamics of caudal vena cava (CVC) as it passes through diaphragm\n\n\u2022 May be indicative of right-sided heart failure, pericardial effusion/tamponade in acute collapse/weakness \u2022 May be indicative of volume overload, third spacing, primary gallbladder disease, and pancreatitis in the less acute patient \u2022 Liver masses, cysts, and diffuse or irregular changes in echogenicity may be appreciated\n\n\u2022 Least gravity-dependent view where air would rise to (pneumoabdomen) and fluid only at this site may be retroperitoneal rather than intraabdominal \u2022 Acoustic window into the abdominal and retroperitoneal space for free abdominal fluid and retroperitoneal fluid \u2022 Splenic masses and diffuse or irregular changes in echogenicity may be appreciated. \u2022 Left kidney may appreciate variety of pathology, including hydronephrosis, pyelectasia, cortical cysts, perinephric cysts, masses, mineralization, calculi, and mineralization. \u2022 May be able to also see right kidney in small dogs and cats through the SR view\n\n\u2022 CC and DH views are most common positive site in low-scoring dogs and cats. \u2022 Urinary bladder may appreciate variety of lesions such as calculi, masses, wall thickening/abnormalities, and emphysema.\n\n\u2022 Spleen and small intestine most often visible here \u2022 Splenic masses and diffuse or irregular changes in echogenicity may be appreciated. \u2022 Small intestine pathology may be appreciated, including dilated loops (ileus, obstruction), wall thickening, masses, and related lymph nodes. \u2022 The name of this view is a misnomer because the liver and right kidney are not typically imaged. \u2022 Liver and right kidney are normally not present at the level of the umbilicus unless they are enlarged. \u2022 Stomach is not visible at the level of the umbilicus unless it's distended.\n\n\u2022 The HR umbilical view completes AFAST and is likely the region to perform abdominocentesis in higher-scoring dogs and cats.\n\n\u2022 Patients may be positioned in right or left lateral recumbency, especially if TFAST exam PCS views immediately follow the AFAST exam in stable patients, and in respiratorycompromised patients, and for the chest tube site (CTS) view; sternal recumbency or standing positioning is safer and preferred for the entire TFAST examination. \u2022 Ultrasound probe is placed in five positions:\n\n1. Diaphragmatico-Hepatic (DH) view-immediately caudal to the xiphoid (same as AFAST DH view). Useful for detecting pericardial effusion (racetrack sign) and pleural effusion.\n\nLeft and right CTS views-at the level of the seventh to eighth intercostal spaces at the highest point, upper third of the thorax, where lung may be visualized on the dorsolateral thoracic wall in the absence of pneumothorax, and where the cap of air would rise in the presence of pneumothorax \u2022 If evidence of lung against the thoracic wall is observed sonographically, then pneumothorax is effectively ruled out. \u2022 If there is no evidence that lung is against the thoracic wall, then the lung point is searched for where the transition zone is between pneumothorax and lung recontacting the thoracic wall. 3. Left and right PCS (pericardial site) view-over the heart at the level of the fifth and sixth intercostal spaces in gravity-dependent regions of the thorax \u2022 PCS views are used for quick assessment of lungs, heart, pleural, and pericardial spaces.\n\nTFAST as an extension of the physical exam\n\n\u2022 Part of both AFAST and TFAST examinations-see AFAST DH view \u2022 Useful for sonographic confirmation of pleural effusion and pericardial effusion (racetrack sign) \u2022 Less air interference than TFAST transthoracic PCS views, liver and gallbladder provide acoustic window into thorax\n\n\u2022 Allows for assessment of volume status by observing dynamics of the caudal vena cava (see DH view in AFAST as an extension of exam).\n\n\u2022 The most recent, most accurate described methodology by the originator of the Vet BLUE is to begin by finding the transition zone in a standing (or sternal) patient at the CTS/Cd view where abdominal contents and lung are viewed over an intercostal space, then sliding toward the head two intercostal spaces to begin the Vet BLUE at the Cd view (point 1). \u2022 From the Cd view (point 1) draw an imaginary line to the elbow. Halfway from the Cd to the elbow is the Ph view (point 2), and at the elbow is the Md view (point 3) and then in the axillary area as the final Cr view. If the heart is in view at the Md, slide the probe directly dorsally until over lung for the Md view, and define the Cr view by finding the transition of lung and thoracic inlet, then sliding caudally over the first two intercostal spaces. If a gator sign orientation is not observed, then you cannot be assured lung is being imaged.\n\nVet BLUE lung ultrasound findings in progression from most to least aerated/most consolidated \u2022 Dry lung-glide sign with A-lines (reverberation artifact) at lung line indicates dry lung at the lung periphery. The confounder: A-lines with no glide sign consistent with pneumothorax \u2022 Wet lung ULRs (also called B-lines)-hyperechoic streaks that oscillate with respiration and extend to the far field, obliterating A-lines \u2022 Shred sign-deviation of the lung line (pulmonary-pleural line) and within the deviation hyperechoic foci of air movement seen in bronchi. Comparable to a radiographic air bronchogram. Indicates lung consolidation/infiltration. \u2022 Tissue sign-more severe consolidation/infiltration where no air movement is present. Referred to as hepatization of lung. \u2022 Nodule sign-anechoic round (nodule) often with a hyperechoic far border and acoustic enhancement through the far field as a ULR.\n\nVet BLUE differential diagnosis for patients with respiratory signs with dry lung in all fields\n\n\u2022 Upper airway disease (laryngeal paralysis, collapsing trachea) \u2022 Airway obstruction (mass) \u2022 Feline asthma \u2022 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease \u2022 Pulmonary thromboembolism \u2022 Centrally located lung lesion away from lung line, therefore missed by Vet BLUE"}
