The COS-COVID is currently the most valuable and practical clinical outcome set for the evaluation of intervention effect, and is useful for evidence assessment and decision-making. With a deepening understanding of COVID-19 and application feedback, the COS-COVID should be continuously updated.\n\n\u00d3 2020 THE AUTHORS.

However, studies have found that the outcomes used in clinical research are frequently inconsistent, nonstandard, irrational, or inessential, weakening the scientific and practical nature of research results and leading to research waste [1] [2] [3] . In order to overcome these problems, experts in evidence-based medicine and clinical research methodology have put forward strategies to develop core outcome sets (COSs). A COS refers to an agreed-upon standard set of outcomes that should be measured and reported, as a minimum, in all clinical trials in specific areas of health or healthcare [4] . A COS is helpful to regularize outcomes adopted in clinical trials, so as to improve the practicability, comparability, and transparency of the results [4] . In 2010, the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) Initiative y was launched to promote research on COS by developing methodological guidelines. Thus far, a series of guidelines and handbooks have been published, including the COMET Handbook (version 1.0) [5] , the COS-STAndards for Development (COS-STAD) [6] , the COS-STAndards for Reporting (COS-STAR) [7] , and the COS-STAndardised Protocol Items (COS-STAP) [8] .\n\nSince the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), hundreds of clinical trial protocols have been registered and have begun subject recruitment. By 20 February 2020, 228 protocols were already listed in two clinical trial registries www.chictr.org. cn \u00e0 , \u00e0\u00e0 . However, there were some deficiencies in the registered clinical trial protocols, especially in outcomes, such as nonstandardized descriptions, significant heterogeneity, subpar clinical value, and ambiguous measure points. Hence, it is necessary to develop a COS for clinical trials on COVID-19 (COS-COVID), which is the aim of this study.\n\nResearchers are encouraged to apply the COS-COVID for the evaluation of different interventions (either pharmaceutical or non-pharmaceutical therapies) in clinical trials on COVID-19. A full spectrum of COVID-19 classifications is covered, ranging from mild and ordinary to severe and critical types, in addition to rehabilitation period. The COS-COVID can be used not only in clinical trials, but also in systematic reviews/meta-analyses, guidelines, and other research on evidence evaluation and decision-making for COVID-19.\n\nThis study was conducted and reported following the COMET Handbook, COS-STAD, and COS-STAR. A research plan was publicized on the websites of COMET and the Chinese Clinical Trials Core Outcome Sets Research Center. \u00e0\u00e0\n\nIn order to guarantee quality and efficiency in the development of the COS-COVID, a steering group with participants from different stakeholder groups was set up. This group comprised 20 members, including scholars in Western medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, evidence-based medicine, and clinical pharmacology; statisticians; and medical journal editors. The participants were selected based on their specialty, recognition, and region. The clinical doctors within this group are experts in the field of respiratory and critical medicine, and have experience in the clinical treatment of patients with COVID-19. Experts on behalf of different interest groups participated in the whole research process. A coordination group, which was responsible for research process coordination and data analysis, was also established.\n\nThe Two clinical trial registries \u00e0,yy were comprehensively searched to retrieve the outcomes used in clinical trials from 1 December 2019 to 12 February 2020. Randomized controlled trials, non-randomized controlled trials, case series, and cohort studies aimed at evaluating different interventions for COVID-19 were included. Studies that included suspected cases, diagnostic tests, and syndrome surveys were excluded. Clinical trials from the registries were screened by two reviewers according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. A predesigned Excel spreadsheet was used to extract data, including design type, intervention, patient, outcome, and so forth. Information on outcomes, which was extracted by two authors independently, included the outcome name, measurement method, measurement time point, and data type. Disagreements were resolved by discussion.\n\nThe extracted outcome information was sorted by similarity. Duplicated outcomes were excluded, nonstandard outcomes were standardized, and synonym outcomes were merged. The process was carried out by two researchers independently, and the differences were resolved by discussion.\n\nThe outcomes obtained after data cleaning were assigned to seven different categories: clinical symptoms, physical and chemical detection, viral nucleic acid detection, quality of life, significant events, disease process, and safety indexes. In order to generate a preliminary list of outcomes for consensus, all the outcomes in each region were voted on for inclusion or not. An outcome would be removed from the preliminary list when 75% of the voting members voted it to be unnecessary. The remaining outcomes formed the preliminary list of outcomes. According to the different classifications of COVID-19, outcomes in the preliminary list were divided into five types: mild, ordinary, severe, critical, and rehabilitation period. \n\nIn this study, two rounds of Delphi survey were conducted for consensus. After each round of survey feedback, a meeting of expert was held to discuss and determine whether to add or remove outcomes.\n\nIn order to ensure the efficiency and quality of the consensus process, this study invited representatives of respiratory, critical, traditional Chinese medicine, and evidence-based medicine, in addition to medical management and journal editors, to join the Delphi survey. In consideration of geographical balance, experts were invited from different regions in China, including Wuhan, Tianjin, Beijing, Jiangsu, Guangdong, Shanghai, Henan, and Sichuan, and internationally, from Italy, Republic of Korea, the United Kingdom, and the United States. All of the participants provided informed consent and were willing to participate in the survey.\n\nAn electronic questionnaire by cell phone was used for the Delphi survey. The questionnaire had two main sections: \u2460 scoring each indexes; and \u2461 recommending the indexes to be added. After each round of information feedback, an expert meeting was held by phone to discuss and determine whether to add, delete, or merge outcomes. Due to the urgency of requirement, participants were required to provide feedback within 24 h.\n\nA Likert scale with nine scores was used to evaluate the importance of the outcomes. Each outcome was scored from a scale of 1 to 9 (unimportant: 1-3; important but not essential: 4-6; essential: 7-9). At the end of each round, data analyses were carried out immediately. Based on the importance ranking, an outcome that was scored higher than 7 by more than 75% of the experts was retained for the next consensus process. The outcomes recommended by the experts might enter the second round after discussion by the steering group.\n\nAll outstanding representatives of different stakeholder groups, clinical experts who completed the Delphi survey, and members of the steering group were invited to the consensus meeting. If an outcome was ranked as essential (7-9) by at least 75% of the participants, it was considered to be agreed upon by consensus and was recommended into the final COS [5] .\n\nDue to the special circumstance of the disease epidemic, the consensus meeting was held by telephone conference instead of through a face-to-face meeting. The contents of the consensus meeting covered five aspects: \u2460 reporting the research methods; \u2461 reporting the results of two rounds of Delphi survey; \u2462 putting forward the key points to be discussed; \u2463 fully discussing the candidate core outcomes; and \u2464 voting on the outcomes and reaching a consensus to form the COS-COVID through discussion.\n\nWe obtained 107 registered protocols of clinical studies on COVID-19: 84 from chictr.org.cn and 23 from clinicaltrials.gov. After screening, 78 protocols met the eligibility criteria: 52 with interventions of chemical or biological drugs and 26 with traditional Chinese medicine plus standard treatments.\n\nThere were 259 outcomes (used 596 times) reported in the included clinical protocols. After the standardized process, 132 outcomes were obtained and assigned to seven domains. Details of the outcome pool are provided in Table 1 .\n\nThis list of outcomes was too long to be used for a Delphi survey. In order to improve the efficiency and quality of the Delphi survey, five experts from the steering group voted on and discussed the outcomes to be retained or eliminated. A preliminary list of outcomes for the first Delphi survey was formed that comprised 58 outcomes assigned to five types of COVID-19 (mild, ordinary, severe, critical, and rehabilitation period) [9] : 17 outcomes for mild, 32 outcomes for ordinary, 35 outcomes for severe, 22 outcomes for critical, and six outcomes for rehabilitation period. Details are provided in Table 2 .\n\nSixty participants were invited to vote in the first round of Delphi survey and 52 responses were eventually received, for an attrition rate of 13.3%. According to the consensus standards, 10, 25, 34, 22, and five outcomes, respectively, were voted as essential for the types of mild, ordinary, severe, critical, and rehabilitation period. Outcomes, including body mass index (BMI), complete blood count (CBC), arterial blood gas, diarrhea, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), myocardial infarction index, duration of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and immunological index for different types were recommended by participants. Based on the voting results and feedback, the steering group held a meeting to discuss which outcomes were of importance and should be included in the second round of Delphi survey. Different expressions of the same index were combined to improve the concentration of the outcomes. After discussion, five outcomes for mild, 15 outcomes for ordinary, 20 outcomes for severe, 15 outcomes for critical, and five outcomes for rehabilitation period obtained consensus for the second round of Delphi survey; none of the recommended outcomes from the first round of Delphi survey were included (Table 3) .\n\nTwenty-two experts, with an emphasis on clinicians in the front line of clinical treatment, were invited to join the second round of Delphi survey. With 20 of these experts responding to the questionnaire within 24 h, the attrition rate was 8%. Certain additional outcomes-chest CT test, respiratory rate, blood gas analysis, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II score, lactic acid, and psychological test-were suggested to supplement the agreed-upon outcomes. Based on the results of the second round, a teleconference was held by the steering group to discuss and confirm the candidate outcomes for the final consensus meeting. After discussion, the steering group agreed that the APACHE II score would be added to the severe stage; the CURB-65 score and duration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) would be removed from the critical type; and the incidence of sequelae and the rate of interstitial pneumonia would be combined into the incidence of sequelae. Finally, the outcomes voted as essential for consensus included four for mild, eight for ordinary, 16 for severe, 12 for critical, and four for rehabilitation period (Table 4 ).\n\nThe consensus meeting was held on 24 February 2020, and involved 20 participants. These included representatives from various stakeholder groups who were experts in respiratory or intensive medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, evidence-based medicine, clinical pharmacology, and statistics, in addition to medical journal editors and decision-makers. There was no conflict of interest among the different stakeholders. Before discussion on each outcome, the results of the two rounds of Delphi survey were shown to the participants of the meeting. Based on the Delphi survey results and discussion, the participants voted anonymously for each outcome, following the criteria of clinical value, clinical feasibility, and stability of indicators in different classifications of COVID-19. Each outcome that met the consensus standards was included in the final COS. At the end, the COS-COVID consisted of one outcome for mild (time to 2019-nCoV RT-PCR negativity), four outcomes for ordinary (length of hospital stay, composite events, score of clinical symptoms, and time to 2019-nCoV RT-PCR negativity), five outcomes for severe (composite events, length of hospital stay, PaO 2 /FiO 2 , duration of mechanical ventilation, and time to 2019-nCoV RT-PCR negativity), one outcome for critical (all-cause mortality), and one outcome for rehabilitation period (pulmonary function), as shown in Table 5 .\n\nThis was a fast COS study conducted under special requirements and in a special environment. Nevertheless, the study was rigorously conducted and reported according to the COS-STAD and COS-STAR. The COS-COVID was accomplished on time and with clinical significance. We hope that all clinical trials and research on evidence transformation for COVID-19 can refer to the COS-COVID during protocol design and decision-making.\n\nThree points must be illustrated for the rational application of the COS-COVID. First, although the COS is the minimum, it is not the only index that should be reported in every clinical study.\n\nStudies with different purposes can add other outcomes if necessary. Second, the COS is not equivalent to the primary outcomes. According to the main purposes of different studies, one or more outcomes in a COS can be selected as the primary outcomes. Third, there is no restriction on the treatment course and measure point in a given trial. However, they should be well-defined and based on scientific and feasible principles. For COVID-19, more than two weeks of treatment course are suggested. Safety outcomes were not included in the COS-COVID, because different drugs might have different adverse reactions. In addition, we suggest that researchers report all adverse events encountered during clinical trials.\n\nThere are several limitations in this study. First, the development of the outcome pool was only based on clinical trial protocols listed in two registry platforms. Doctors and patients were not consulted to collect indicators. Therefore, there is a potential risk of missing important outcomes. Second, due to the prevalence of new infectious diseases, patients were not invited to join in the survey and consensus process. As a result, patients' opinions may not have been fully reflected. Third, the number of representatives for different stakeholders may not be fully adequate. The fact that the majority of the experts were from China weakens the regional representation. Fourth, the process of consensus was conducted via conference calls instead of through face-to-face meetings, which may have led to insufficient discussion and affected the consensus results. Finally, the current understanding of COVID-19 is still incomplete and in the process of being established, so the relevant evaluation outcomes and COS must be updated with the process of practice. Furthermore, we wish to strengthen communication with Adverse reactions; frequency of adverse events; frequency of severe adverse events; frequency of drug withdrawal due to adverse reactions; frequency of complications; blood biochemistry; liver function; liver and renal function; frequency of renal injury; routine urinalysis; electrocardiography; blood concentration of chloroquine TTCI: time to clinical improvement; TCM: traditional Chinese medicine; CT: computerized tomography; MRI: magnetic resonance imaging; PaO 2 /FiO 2 : the ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fraction of inspired oxygen; CBC: complete blood count; RT-PCR: reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; SF-36: the medical outcome study 36-item short-form health survey; MODS: multiple organ dysfunction syndrome; ARDS: acute respiratory distress syndrome; DIC: disseminated intravascular coagulation; ICU: intensive care unit; ECMO: extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; APACHE: acute physiology and chronic health evaluation; CURB-65: confusion, uremia, respiratory rate, blood pressure, age!65 years; NEWS: national early warning score; SOFA: sequential organ failure assessment; PSI: pneumonia severity index.\n\nrelevant international academic organizations to promote the application and update of the COS-COVID.\n\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.\n\nWe are deeply grateful to the front-line clinicians who participated in the questionnaire while directly fighting the epidemic.
