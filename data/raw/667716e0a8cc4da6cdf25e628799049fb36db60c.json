{"title": "Molecular analysis of Idiopathic Subglottic Stenosis for Mycobacterium species: A North American Airway Collaborative (NoAAC) TS-04 study HHS Public Access", "body": "Idiopathic subglottic stenosis (iSGS) is a debilitating extrathoracic obstruction involving the lower laryngeal and upper tracheal airway. It arises without known antecedent injury or associated disease. Emerging study has demonstrated affected patients possess tightly conserved clinical demographics 1 , histopatholigic findings 2 , anatomic injury 3 , and physiologic impairment 4 . Despite description of iSGS more than four decades ago 5 , only recently has the inflammatory fibrosing phenotype been characterized at the molecular level. Data show highly upregulated activation of the inflammatory IL-17A/IL-23 pathway in the mucosal scar in iSGS, yet the mechanisms responsible for the characteristic demarcated airway inflammation are unknown.\n\nIn alternate pulmonary pathologies [6] [7] [8] [9] , both structural and functional changes in the lung epithelium appear to be integral to fibrotic remodeling, occurring in the setting of chronic airway inflammation. Epithelial microbiota dysbiosis with subsequent sustained host inflammation is found in other chronic inflammatory mucosal diseases [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Although the trachea is lined with respiratory epithelia, which readily supports colonization by a diverse microbiome at other upper respiratory sites such as the oropharynx 19, 20 to date nothing is known of the composition of the resident microbiome of the large airway or its contribution to airway remodeling in idiopathic subglottic stenosis. Microbiological studies that rely on culture-based techniques underestimate the diversity of species present 10 , and offer limited detection of intracellular pathogens. The application of culture-independent approaches offers the opportunity to both provide a broader picture of tracheal microbiome composition and identify discrete pathogenic species associated with disease states.\n\nPreviously work has demonstrated activation of the canonical IL-23/IL-17A pathway in the tracheal mucosa of iSGS patients, and identified \u03b3\u03b4 T cells as the primary cellular source of IL-17A 21 . Given the established role of \u03b3\u03b4 T cell IL-17A in host defense at mucosal barriers, we analyzed tissue specimens from iSGS patients for the presence of microbial pathogens. Our unbiased molecular interrogation of the tracheal microbiota of iSGS patients provides detailed nucleaic acid, protein, and immunologic evidence to demonstrate Mycobacterium species within tracheal scar. Together with our previous work, these studies offer new insights into the pathogenesis of iSGS. They suggest that human tracheal mucosal health is highly dependent on the composition of the resident microbiota, identify a novel pathogenic role for established large airway bacteria, and offer targets for future therapeutic interventions.\n\nThis study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, Good Clinical Practice, and was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (IRB#: 140429).\n\nIn all, 20 iSGS, 20 intubation-related tracheal stenosis (iLTS), and 10 normal control patients were utilized for experiments (Figure S1.). Each iSGS & iLTS diagnosis was confirmed using previously described clinical and serologic criteria 22 . The control population consisted of patients without known tracheal pathology, malignancy, or systemic infection. Tracheal scar or freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was the source of all specimens from the iSGS, and iLTS patients, and normal trachea or PBMC was the source for the control patients.\n\nDNA Isolation: Genomic DNA was extracted with the Qiagen DNAeasy extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions with slight modification as previously described 23, 24 . The gDNA concentration and quality were confirmed using the Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent, CA, USA). Human respiratory pathogen qPCR array (Qiagen, Vallencia, CA) was performed as per manufacture's instructions in a StepOnePlus\u2122 instrument (Applied Biosystems \u00ae , USA) Expression analysis was preformed using PCR array analysis software (Qiagen, Valencia, CA; https://www.qiagen.com)\n\nParaffin embedded iSGS and iLTS airway stenosis tissues and healthy controls (US Biomax Inc. product# RS321), were pretreated and probed for Gyrase A (Advanced Cell Diagnostics #436701) following a modified RNAscope\u00ae 2.0 Assay's HD Detection Kit (Red) protocol 25 . Tissue was digested with proteinase-K (1:100 dilution) (Sigma) in 20 mM Tris-Cl (p.H. 8.0) for 5 minutes at room temperature. Experimental controls run in parallel included bacterial gene DapB as a negative control to assess background signal and Homo sapiens HS-PPIB to assess positive signals and protocol efficacy.\n\nMolecular subtyping of Mycobacterial Species-Nested PCR analysis was performed as previously described for Mycobacterial rpoB 26 (with conditions and primers listed in supplemental data). Negative and positive controls were run in parallel. Genomic DNA extracted from M. tuberculosis strain H37rv served as a positive control (Vircell Technologies, Granada, Spain), while PCR master mix inoculated with 5 \u03bcL of sterile water, and PCR master mix alone were used as negative controls.\n\nrpoB gene products were run on a 2% gel and purified the 360bp band using the Qiagen QIAquick\u00ae Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen, Vallencia, CA) and sequenced directly on both strands in the Vanderbilt Cancer Center Core Sequencing Laboratory. Alignments of the rpoB sequences were performed with Sequencher software (v5.3, Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI).\n\nHuman tracheal mucosal biopsies were obtained in the operating theater and immediately fixed with chilled buffer (50 mM sodium cacodylate [pH 7.4]) containing 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 2.0% paraformaldehyde and placed in 4\u00b0C overnight. The samples were then prepared as previsouly described 27 . Briefly, samples were blocked with 0.1% coldwater fish skin gelatin in 50 mM sodium cacodylate buffer and stained with rabbit polyclonal anti-Mtb antibodies (LS-C72966, LSBio, Inc.), followed by goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to 20 nm gold particles (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Samples were washed three times with phosphate buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) and analyzed with an FEI T-12 transmission electron microscope equipped with a side-mounted digital camera. A total of 30-35 individual cells in each group were imaged to analyze subcellular architecture and presence of bacteria.\n\nPreparation of PBMC and ESAT-6 peptides 23 , and Elispot\u2122 assay were preformed as described previously 28 . The number of specific gamma interferon-secreting T cells was calculated by subtracting the mean negative-control value from the mean spot-forming-cell (SFC) count for duplicate wells inoculated with peptide. Negative controls always had <50 SFC per 10 6 input cells. A positive response was defined as a concentration of at least 50 SFC/10 6 PBMC that is at least three times higher than the background level. Research assistants were blind to the clinical diagnoses of the study participants throughout the analysis.\n\nStatistical significance was set at p value less than 0.05 and a mean difference equal to or greater than 2-fold change in expression levels. Normal distribution of the variables was tested using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Differences between x and y groups were determined using the Kruskal Wallis and Mann Whitney tests for normal and non-normal distributions, respectively. Data were expressed as median \u00b1 SD for non-normal distributed variables. All statistical analyses were performed with Prism version 6.0 software.\n\nGiven the role of \u03b3\u03b4 T cell IL-17A in host defense against pathogens at epithelial and mucosal barriers, we analyzed tissue specimens from iSGS patients for the presence of microbial species. All iSGS patients (10/10) demonstrated PCR positivity to Mycobacterium species (Fig. 1A) , while only 2 of 10 iLTS patients were positive by PCR (p<0.001). In contrast, among iLTS patients, 10/10 showed PCR positivity to Acinetobacter baumannii (an established ICU pathogen 29 ), while only 1 of 10 iSGS patients showed a positive signal for this pathogen (p<0.001).\n\nFurther confirmatory testing was preformed on an additional 10 iSGS, 10 iLTS, and 10 healthy controls with in situ hybridization probing RNA expression of the specific mycobacterial virulence factor DNA gyrase subunit A (gryA) 30 . 7 of 10 iSGS specimens tested positive, predominantly in the tracheal epithelium, while only 1 of 10 iLTS specimens and 0 of 10 healthy control samples showing detectable signal (p=0.03) (Fig. 1B) .\n\nTo further investigate for Mycobacterium species within tracheal scar tissue, we utilized immunogold labeling and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. This analysis revealed multiple structures with associated labels that exhibit typical size (500 nm-2 \u03bcm) and shape (coccoid or bacillus) of Mycobacterium species within the extracellular matrix ( Fig. 1E-H) , while controls using secondary antibody alone (Fig. 1C) or an unrelated antibody to Haemophilus influenzae (Fig. 1D) were negative. Digital quantification of gold labels per bacterial cell by computerized algorithm confirmed visual analysis of anti-Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (Mtbc) antibody binding in iSGS tissues (p<0.005) (Fig. S2 ).\n\nAfter detection of nucleic and amino acid signal for mycobacteria within iSGS, we sought to assess the systemic immunologic response in iSGS. Utilizing Elispot, we analyzed antigen specific responses of peripheral leukocytes from iSGS patients to the mycobacterial 6-kDa early secreted antigenic protein (ESAT-6). We chose ESAT-6 peptides due to prior reports of systemic cellular immune responses to these conserved MtbC virulence factors in Sarcoidosis 28, 31 . PBMC from iSGS patients showed a mean IFN-\u03b3 spot-forming-cell (SFC) count of 165.9 (SEM +/-42.4) compared with 27.4 (SEM +/-18.1) in normal controls (p<0.0076) (Fig. 1I.) . This IFN-\u03b3 response suggests systemic immunologic memory to MtbC exposure and is consistent with a pathological role for MtbC in iSGS.\n\nIt was not possible to subtype the Mycobacterium species based on the initial primers in our discovery assay, thus we utilized Sanger sequencing 26 2A) . While the predicted protein coding sequence from iSGS specimens was homologous to Mtb reference sequences (Fig. 2B) , phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid sequencing suggests that rather than Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (Mtb), a variant member of the MtbC, or a closely related novel mycobacterium (Fig. 2C) , is present in iSGS specimens.\n\nWe demonstrate through multiple distinct approaches the presence of Mycobacterium within tracheal scar of iSGS patients. Our prior findings suggest a major role for \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in the IL-17A dependent tissue inflammation and fibrotic remodeling seen in the airways of iSGS patients 21 . Given the established role for \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in the early production of IL-17A in MtbC infection 32 , and critical role for IL-17A in host clearance of pulmonary MtbC 33 , our prior results are consistent with our current work demonstrating Mycobacterial species within the airway scar of iSGS patients.\n\nAn early report describing iSGS as a clinical entity could not isolate bacterial sepcies 34 in routine microbiologic culture. Similarly, all iSGS patients included in our study were culture negative. However, since this publication in 1993, culture independent techniques have become an established alternate methodology for identification of infectious agents. PCR was used to identify the etiologic agents of bacillary angiomatosis (Bartonella henselae) 35 and Whipple's disease (Tropheryma whippelii) 36 .\n\nThe use of antigen-specific immune responses to microbial antigens has also been utilized to identify novel infectious agents, including Sin Nombre virus in hantavirus pulmonary syndrome 37 , as well as a previously unknown coronavirus in severe acute respiratory syndrome 38, 39 , and Mycobacterium in sarcoidosis 28, 40 . PBMCs from iSGS patients stimulated ex-vivo with mycobacterial virulence factor ESAT-6 demonstrate a pronounced IFN\u03b3 response. This finding suggests that despite negative culture results from iSGS specimens, mycobacterial antigens induce T-cell-specific responses in the blood of iSGS patients at similar frequencies to those of tuberculosis subjects 28 . The observation of a pronounced cellular immune response to Mycobacterium EAST-6 antigens in all 10 iSGS patients tested strongly supports the results from our molecular and protein analysis of iSGS scar.\n\nThe inability to identify mycobacterial microorganisms by routine histologic staining or to culture microorganisms from pathologic tissues provides caution to the establishment of a causative role for infectious agents in iSGS pathogenesis. However, based upon prior microbiological experience with fastidious mycobacteria, there are several explanations for the failure to detect microbial species in iSGS in the initial reports of the disease. The bacteria may be present in quantities below the detection of histologic staining 41 . Alternatively, the agent may have an ultra-slow growth pattern that necessitates incubation periods much longer than the standard 6 weeks that cultures are held for isolation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, similar to the time needed for isolation of M. ulcerans 42 .\n\nConversely, iSGS pathogenesis may reflect an immune response to infectious antigens, and might not be dependent upon actively replicating organisms, similar to the hypersensitivity pneumonitis induced by Mycobacterium avium 43 .\n\nAn association between Mycobacterium and iSGS immunopathogenesis is supported by detection of mycobacterial proteins and nucleic acids in iSGS scar, as well as local and peripheral cellular immune responses to mycobacterial antigens in iSGS subjects. However, it remains unresolved if the identified mycobacterial constituents drive disease or whether inflammation per se creates a niche for the outgrowth of specific bacteria. It should be noted however, that tracheal stenosis arising after intubation (iLTS; which also possess an inflammatory tissue phenotype in the airway), appears in our cohort to have a much lower percentage of patients with detected Mycobacterium. Given the disease rarity, these results will require confirmation in larger cohorts pooled from multiple institutions.\n\nThe presence of Mycobacterium within iSGS scar is particularly striking in light of proven association of Mycobacterium with otherwise healthy, older white females (the \"Lady Windermere\" syndrome) 44 Although our results demonstrate Mycobacterium species within the tracheal scar of iSGS patients, the role of host genetics to iSGS pathogenesis has not yet been explored. Interestingly, strong alternate evidence links host genotype to mycobacterial susceptibility via the IL-23/IL-17A axis. Molecular analysis of patients suffering from Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease has implicated polymorphisms in both the ligand (IL-12B) 45, 46 and receptor (IL-12R\u03b21) 47,48 responsible for IL-17A activation. Similarly, although iSGS affects women nearly exclusively, the influence of estrogen on disease initiation and recurrence is unknown. Estrogen has been shown to directly drive IL-23/ IL-23R signaling and increase IL-17A production in severe asthma 49 . The role of estrogen in promoting Mycobacterial colonization/infection, or its role in accelerating the host response to pathogen are questions meriting future study.\n\nAlthough iSGS has long been considered strictly an anatomic abnormality, requiring a surgical remedy, we offer the first evidence that the disease may represent a manifestation of altered local microbial flora coupled to a pathologic host inflammatory response. We demonstrate through multiple distinct approaches, a unique association of mycobacterial species and iSGS airway mucosa. Together with prior reports demonstrating significantly upregulated local IL-17A, evidence of Mycobacterium species within tracheal scar offers new avenues for therapeutic intervention in iSGS patients. Several established reagents are available to inhibit the IL-17A pathway 5051,52 . Alternatively, multiple drugs are available targeting Mycobacterium species. Interestingly, limited cases series supports a clinical benefit for one of these reagents in iSGS patients 1 . The benefit of IL-17A inhibition in the absence of pathogen control is unclear, thus future clinical trials could test the clinical response of immunomodulation in combination with antibacterial therapy. Thus, the implications this work may extend beyond the confines of iSGS to other disease arising at the interface of pathogen and host inflammatory response.\n\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.
