The G3H1 and U6H3 protons were assigned according to their positions in the imino region of the 100 ms spectrum ( Figure S1 ). Cross-peaks to G3H1 and U6H3 identified the G4H1 resonance while an NOE to A7H2 at around 7.12 ppm was used to identify U2H3. Crosspeaks between amino protons and H5 of C in NOESY spectra were used to differentiate their H5-H6 cross-peaks from those of U. The H5 of the terminal C1 residue is characteristically downfield from that of C5. H1' to H6 and H8 resonances form a sequential walk, and the assignments of G3H1' and G8H1' were confirmed by interstrand and intrastrand NOE contacts, respectively, to A7H2 ( Figure S1 ).\n\n2D NOESY spectra for r(AGGCUU) 2 were obtained with mixing times of 100 ms and 400 ms at 0 \u00b0C and 8 \u00b0C, respectively. The longer mixing-time 2D NOESY spectrum was acquired at 8 \u00b0C because aromatic peaks were well-resolved at this temperature among a series of 1D 11-echo spectra acquired at different temperatures. The G2H1 and U5H3 wobble pair and G3H1 imino protons were assigned according to their positions in the imino region in the 100 ms spectrum ( Figure S2 ). Among the pyrimidine H5 protons, C4H5 has a cross-peak to C4H41/H42 and U5H5 has a cross-peak to G2H1. U6H5 was thereby assigned through process of elimination. Assignments for aromatic and H1' peaks were confirmed with a sequential NOESY walk with the 400 ms spectrum ( Figure S2 ). Within this region, G3H8 has a cross-peak to C4H5. H1' cross-peaks to H2' in the 400 ms spectrum were larger than those to H3'. Crosspeaks from A1H8 to its own H1', H2' and H3' were used to differentiate A1H8 from A1H2.

Chemical shifts are submitted to NAPSS-CS as shown on the left and base pairs predicted by NAPSS-CS are shown on the right. Integers 5, 6, and 7 represent AU, GC, and GU pairs, respectively. Numbers in parentheses are chemical shifts for imino protons, respectively. For GU pairs, numbers in parentheses are chemical shifts of GH1, UH3, and UH5, respectively. For AU pairs, numbers in parentheses are chemical shifts of AH2, UH3, and UH5, respectively. For GC pairs, the first number in parentheses is the chemical shift of GH1.
