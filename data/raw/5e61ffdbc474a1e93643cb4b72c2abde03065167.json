{"title": "x-(1H-1,2,3-triazol-1-yl)(polyhydroxy)alkylphosphonates as acyclic nucleotide analogues", "body": "Infectious diseases caused by different microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi and viruses, are still a problem of human civilization. Among all pathogenic microorganisms viruses are notorious, the most active and probably the most dangerous because they penetrate into cells, evolve rapidly and interfere with the genetic material of the host. Despite current achievements in the development of antiviral drugs, 1,2 there is still a need for new compounds with an unique mechanism of action and limited side-effects.\n\nThe successful search for acyclic nucleoside analogues started when acyclovir [9-(2-hydroxyethoxymethyl)guanine] was described as an antiherpesvirus agent. 3 Soon after, a few other acyclic nucleoside or acyclic nucleoside phosphonate analogues became available as antiviral compounds, namely, ganciclovir, cidofovir, tenofovir, adefovir, etc. 4, 5 Attempts to improve the solubility of compounds in aqueous media resulted in synthesis of hydroxylated analogues of nucleosides such as ganciclovir as well as other nucleoside mimetics shown on Figure 1 . 4, [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] The interest in investigation of hydroxylated nucleosides has also been stimulated by a previous discovery of extreme potency of the naturally accessible D-eritadenine 2, 7, 8 which acts as an inhibitor of S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase (SAHH). This enzyme has earlier been shown to be an attractive target for poxviruses, (\u00c0)RNA viruses such as paramyxovirus and rhabdovirus, and (\u00b1)RNA viruses such as reovirus. 15, 16 Consequently, (2 0 S)-9-(2 0 ,3 0 -dihydroxypropyl)adenine 3 10 and other N(9)-substituted adenines and guanines possessing polyhydroxyalkyl chains have been obtained (Fig. 1) .\n\nAmong various structural modifications of nucleosides/nucleotides 1,2,3-triazole analogues have been of special interest. The applicability of a 1,2,3-triazole ring as a replacement of sugar [17] [18] [19] or nucleobase moieties 17, [19] [20] [21] as well as an additional linker between a phosphonoalkyl unit and a nucleobase has been widely explored [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] including our achievements. [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] Recently, several http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2014.05.020 0968-0896/\u00d3 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. acyclic 1,2,3-triazolyl analogues of nucleosides/nucleotides with nucleobases attached via the methylene group at the C4 in the 1,2,3-triazole moiety have been obtained and some of them showed promising biological activity (Fig. 2) . While (1,2,3-triazol-1-yl)nucleosides 9-11 were found to be inactive against selected viruses, 22,23 the phosphonomethyl-12 (n = 1; B = Thy, Ade) and phosphonoethyl(1,2,3-triazoles) 12 (n = 2; R = Thy, Ura) showed moderate activity against hepatitis C virus (HCV). 25 Recently, we succeeded in the synthesis of 1-(3-phosphonopropyl)-1,2,3-triazole 13 substituted with benzoylbenzuracil via a methylene linker which exhibited activity against herpes simplex virus-1 (KOS), herpes simplex virus-2 (G) and feline herpes virus. 33 Moreover, the 1-(3-amino-3-phosphonopropyl)-1,2,3-triazole analogue (R)-14 having 3-acetylindole as a modified nucleobase showed moderate activity toward vesicular stomatitis virus. 35 In continuation of our research program towards 1,2,3-triazole nucleoside analogues, [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] and taking into account the known biological activity of hydroxylated nucleoside analogues as well as the antiviral activity of 13 and 14 and the cytostatic properties of 15, 1,2,3-triazoles 16 and 17 possessing dibenzyloxyphosphono(polyhydroxy)alkyl residues have been designed (Fig. 3) . We assumed that incorporation of additional hydroxyl groups into an alkyl side-chain would assure better solubility and perhaps improve biological activity of 1,2,3-triazoles 16 and 17 in comparison with analogous compounds having unfunctionalised aliphatic moieties. 33 2. Results and discussion\n\nEnantiomerically pure (1R,2S)-and (1S,2S)-azidophosphonates 18 were obtained from L-ascorbic acid, 36, 37 whereas for the synthesis of (1S,2R,3S)-and (1S,2R,3R)-azidophosphonates 19 38 tartaric acid and L-isoascorbic acid were used, respectively, as a source of chirality.\n\nThe 1,2,3-triazoles (1R,2S)-and (1S,2S)-16 were synthesised by the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of the corresponding (1R,2S)-and (1S,2S)-azidophosphonates 18 with N-propargyl nucleobases 20 (N 9 -propargyladenine 20a, 23 N 1 -propargylthymine 20b, 23 N 1 -propargyluracil 20c, 39 N 4 -acetyl-N 1 -propargylcytosine 20d 40 ) and several propargylated nucleobase mimetics 20 (N 1 -propargyl-6-azauracil 20e, 41 3-acetyl-N-propargylindole 20f, 42 N 1 -propargyltheobromine 20g, 43,44 N 7 -propargyltheophylline 20h, 45 8-chloro-N 7 -propargyltheophylline 20i, 46 N-propargyl-2-pyridone 20j, 47 N 3 -benzoyl-N 1 -propargyluracil 20k 33, 48 and N 3 -benzoyl-N 1 -propargylquinazolin-2,4dione 20l 33 ).\n\nAccording to a standard protocol the regioselective formation of respective 1,4-disubstituted 1,2,3-triazoles was secured by the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of azides with terminal alkynes in the presence of a catalytic amount of Cu(I) at room temperature. 49, 50 However, under these conditions more than 3 days were required to complete the reaction of (1S,2S)-and (1R,2S)-azidophosphonates 18 with N-propargyl nucleobases 20. Structures of all new compounds were confirmed on the basis of 1 H, 13 C, 31 P NMR and IR spectra data as well as by elemental analysis. , dextran sulfate (molecular weight 5000, DS-5000), ribavirin, oseltamivir carboxylate, amantadine and rimantadine were used as the reference compounds. The antiviral activity was expressed as the EC 50 : the compound concentration required to reduce virus plaque formation (VZV) by 50% or to reduce virus-induced cytopathogenicity by 50% (other viruses).\n\nThe cytotoxicity of the tested compounds toward the uninfected host cells was defined as the minimum cytotoxic concentration (MCC) that causes a microscopically detectable alteration of normal cell morphology. The 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ), causing a 50% decrease in cell viability was determined using a colorimetric 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay system.\n\nIt was established that compound (1S,2S)-16b containing a 1,2,3-triazole moiety substituted at C4 0 with thymine exhibited antiviral activity against Influenza A H3N2 subtype (EC 50 = 20 lM by visual CPE score; EC 50 = 18 lM by MTS score; MCC >100 lM, \n\nThe cytostatic activity of the tested compounds was defined as the 50% cytostatic inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ), causing a 50% decrease in cell proliferation and was determined against murine (Table 1 ).\n\nAs far as cytostatic properties are considered, within a series of hydroxylated (1,2,3-triazol-1-yl)nucleotide analogues 16 and 17, compounds 16 containing three-carbon phosphonoalkyl chain are more cytostatic toward the tested tumor cell lines when compared with four-carbon phosphonates 17 having the same nucleobases (16a vs 17a, 16c vs 17c, 16d vs 17d, 16g vs 17g, 16i vs 17i). Moreover, the configurations at stereogenic centres have slight or negligible impact on the cytostatic properties of (1,2,3-triazol-1-yl)nucleo- Analogous structure-antiviral activity relationship studies on a series of (1,2,3-triazol-1-yl)nucleotide analogues 16 and 17 were performed.\n\nThus, 1-hydroxy-2-benzyloxypropylphosphonate (1R,2S)-16l, which contains a N 3 -benzoylbenzyuracil residue, showed promising antiviral activity against herpes simplex viruses (HSV-1, HSV-2) in HEL cell cultures (EC 50 = 2.9 and 4 lM, respectively) and feline herpes virus in CRFK cells (EC 50 = 4 lM), whereas its N 3 -benzoyluracil and uracil analogues (1R,2S)-16k and (1R,2S)-16c, respectively, appeared inactive. This trend well correlates with our previous observations on structurally analogous (1,2,3-triazol-1-yl)nucleotides having an unsubstituted phosphonopropyl chain, since compound 13 was the most active against HSV-1, HSV-2 (EC 50 = 17 lM) and against feline herpes virus (EC 50 = 24 lM). 33 Furthermore, the stereochemistry of the aliphatic chain substituted with hydroxyl groups is essential for activity since analogue (1S,2S)-16l showed no activity. On the other hand, the significant activity toward vesicular stomatitis virus and respiratory syncytial virus in HeLa cell cultures was observed for compound (1S,2S)-16k containing an N 3 -benzoyluracil unit (EC 50 = 9 and 12 lM, respectively) since analogous compounds (1S,2S)-16l (B = N 3 -benzoylbenzuracil) and (1S,2S)-16c (B = uracil) were inactive against these viruses. Again, stereochemistry of an aliphatic fragment appeared important and resulted in lack of activity for (1R,2S)-16k. \n\n1 H NMR were taken in CDCl 3 or CD 3 OD on the following spectrometers: Varian Mercury-300 and Bruker Avance III (600 MHz) with TMS as an internal standard; chemical shifts d in ppm with respect to TMS; coupling constants J in Hz. 13 C NMR spectra were recorded for CDCl 3 ,CD 3 OD or DMSO-d 6 solutions on a Varian Mercury-300 and Bruker Avance III (600 MHz) spectrometer at 75.5 and 150.5 MHz, respectively. 31 P NMR spectra were taken in CDCl 3 or CD 3 OD on Varian Mercury-300 and Bruker Avance III at 121.5 and 242 MHz.\n\nIR spectral data were measured on an Infinity MI-60 FT-IR spectrometer.
