{"title": "Article Intraepithelial Type 1 Innate Lymphoid Cells Are a Unique Subset of IL-12-and IL-15-Responsive IFN-g-Producing Cells", "body": "Recent studies have shown that both aggregated and diffuse lymphoid tissues of the oral and gastrointestinal mucosa harbor various innate lymphoid cell (ILC) subsets that contribute to early immune responses against pathogens by secreting different cytokines (Cherrier et al., 2012; Guo et al., 2012; Spits et al., 2013) . Remarkably, these ILC subsets resemble the discrete T helper cell effectors Th1, Th2, Th17, and Th22 cells in terms of the signature cytokines and transcription factors that determine their development. We recently identified a unique type of human ILC marked by the natural killer (NK) cell surface molecule NKp44, the signature cytokine interleukin-22 (IL-22), expression of the receptors for IL-1 (IL-1R), IL-7 (IL-7Ra), and IL-23 (IL-23Ra), and the chemokine receptor CCR6 (Cella et al., 2009 (Cella et al., , 2010 . We refer to these cells and their murine counterparts as type 3 ILC (ILC3) (Spits et al., 2013) . Acting on epithelial cells, IL-22 induces the release of antimicrobial peptides that protect the integrity of the mucosal barrier from pathogens (Ouyang et al., 2011; Sonnenberg et al., 2011) . IL-22 release is triggered by IL-23 and enhanced by IL-1, both of which are produced by antigen presenting cells (APC) in response to pathogens or other inflammatory stimuli. ILC3 development requires IL-7 signaling and the transcription factors Id2, RORgt (Cherrier et al., 2012; Spits et al., 2013) , AHR (Kiss et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2012; Qiu et al., 2012) , and Notch (Lee et al., 2012; Possot et al., 2011) . Human ILC3 maintain a certain degree of functional plasticity, because they can produce interferon-g (IFN-g) when cultured in vitro with IL-7+IL-2, IL-1b+IL-2, or IL-7+IL-1b+IL-23 (Cella et al., 2010) .\n\nAdditional cells expressing NKp44 or other NK cell markers have been described in the human oral and gastrointestinal mucosa, including tonsilar NKp44 + CD103 + NK cells (Cella et al., 2010) , small intestine CD7 + CD3 \u00c0 intraepithelial lymphocytes (Eiras et al., 2000) , colon lamina propria NKp46 + NKp44 \u00c0 cells (Takayama et al., 2010) , and rectal intraepithelial and lamina propria NKp46 + cells (Sips et al., 2012) . Cells with NK cell activity were also reported in the murine intestinal epithelium and lamina propria (Carman et al., 1986; Tagliabue et al., 1982) . Although these reports suggest further phenotypic and functional heterogeneity of mucosal ILC, the functions and responsiveness to pathogenic stimuli of these ILC subsets are poorly understood. It is also unclear whether these cells are related to ILC3 or classical NK cells. In this study, we demonstrated that the human tonsil and intestinal mucosa contain a unique NKp44 + CD103 + cell subset that produced IFN-g in response to IL-12 and IL-15. These cells were different from classical NK cells in that they were selectively located within the epithelium, expressed the chemokine receptor CXCR6, and reflected features of TGF-b imprinting. Moreover, they had an integrin profile and a memory-activated phenotype similar to that previously observed in tissue resident memory CD8 T (Trm) cells, which are virusspecific cells that persist in the mucosae and skin after the resolution of viral infections (Casey et (legend continued on next page)\n\nType 1 Innate Lymphoid Cells in the Gut et al., 2012, reviewed in Cauley and Lefran\u00e7 ois, 2013) . Intraepithelial NKp44 + CD103 + cell numbers were increased in Crohn's disease patients, suggesting that they contribute to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We further identified the murine counterparts of intraepithelial NKp44 + CD103 + cells, which were distinguished by expression of CD160, as well as NKp46 and NK1.1. We found that these cells were strongly reduced in mice lacking the transcription factors Nfil3 (also known as E4bp4) (Male et al., 2012) and Tbx21, but not in Il15ra \u00c0/\u00c0 mice, corroborating that intraepithelial NKp46 + NK1.1 + CD160 + cells represent an ILC1 subset distinct from classical NK cells. Murine intraepithelial ILC1 promptly produced IFN-g in the anti-CD40-induced colitis model and contributed to intestinal inflammation. Thus, intraepithelial ILC1 may facilitate immune responses during exposure to infections but contribute to IBD when dysregulated.\n\nWe sought to delineate the diversity of human ILC in mucosalassociated lymphoid tissues. We isolated CD56 + cells from human tonsils and analyzed them by flow cytometry for the expression of NKp44, CD103, and CD3. Within the CD3 \u00c0 compartment, we identified two cell subsets, NKp44 + and NKp44 \u00c0 cells ( Figure 1A ). NKp44 + cells could be further divided into CD103 + and CD103 \u00c0 cells. The NKp44 \u00c0 population was mainly CD103 \u00c0 but included small numbers of CD103 lo cells, which varied considerably among individuals and therefore were not further examined.\n\nWe next determined which of these subsets produced IL-22. CD56 + cells isolated from tonsils were stimulated with IL-23 and analyzed for intracellular content of IL-22 as well as surface expression of NKp44, CD103, and the prototypic ILC3 cell surface markers, including CCR6, IL-1R, and IL-7Ra. NKp44 + CD103 \u00c0 cells produced IL-22 ( Figure 1A ) and many expressed CCR6, IL-1R, and IL-7Ra ( Figure 1B ) and therefore corresponded to ILC3. In contrast, NKp44 + CD103 + cells and NKp44 \u00c0 CD103 \u00c0 cells produced no or little IL-22 ( Figure 1A ) and did not express CCR6, IL-1R, or IL-7Ra ( Figure 1B ).\n\nMucosal NKp44 + CD103 + and NKp44 -CD103 -Cells Are Type 1 ILC To evaluate the function of NKp44 + CD103 + and NKp44 \u00c0 CD103 \u00c0 cells, we initially assessed cytokine production by intracellular staining following stimulation with PMA and ionomycin. Both NKp44 + CD103 + and NKp44 \u00c0 CD103 \u00c0 cells produced more IFN-g and CCL4 than ILC3, but less GM-CSF ( Figure 1C ). We then asked which physiological stimuli induce IFN-g in NKp44 + CD103 + and NKp44 \u00c0 CD103 \u00c0 cells. Typically, ILCs produce signature cytokines when challenged with other cytokines, independent of signaling through immunoreceptors Soudja et al., 2012) . Accordingly, both NKp44 + CD103 + and NKp44 \u00c0 CD103 \u00c0 cells produced IFN-g when stimulated in vitro with IL-12 or IL-15 ( Figure 1D ). Moreover, IL-12 and IL-15 had a strong synergistic effect. IL-23, which stimulates ILC3, was ineffective (data not shown). IFN-g production by NKp44 \u00c0 CD103 \u00c0 cells was particularly efficient in a subset expressing CD27 (see Figure S1 available online), similar to what has been shown for blood NK cells (Silva et al., 2008) .\n\nInterestingly, the magnitude of IFN-g production by NKp44 + CD103 + and NKp44 \u00c0 CD103 \u00c0 cells was similar to that of peripheral blood CD56 hi NK cells ( Figure 1D ), which are known producers of IFN-g in response to cytokines (Cooper et al., 2001) , and superior to that of peripheral blood CD56 lo NK cells ( Figure 1D ), which specialize in the release of lytic granules (Cooper et al., 2001) . However, although CD56 hi NK cells were responsive to IL-18, NKp44 + CD103 + and NKp44 \u00c0 CD103 \u00c0 cells produced equal amounts of IFN-g following stimulation with either IL-12+IL-18 or IL-12 alone, demonstrating that these cells do not respond to IL-18 ( Figure 1D ). Based on their ability to rapidly produce IFN-g in response to IL-12 and IL-15, we conclude that NKp44 + CD103 + cells and NKp44 \u00c0 CD103 \u00c0 cells belong to type 1 ILC (ILC1), which are the innate counterparts of Th1 CD4 T cells and include blood NK cells, particularly the CD56 hi subset.\n\nNKp44 + CD103 + and NKp44 \u00c0 CD103 \u00c0 ILC1 not only produced IFN-g but approximately 50% of these cells also contained intracellular perforin and granzymes ( Figure 1E ; data not shown), consistent with potential cytotoxic activity. In NKp44 \u00c0 CD103 \u00c0 ILC1, granzyme production precisely paralleled IFN-g production ( Figure S1 ). To corroborate the lytic activity of NKp44 + CD103 + and NKp44 \u00c0 CD103 \u00c0 ILC1, we monitored degranulation of all ILC subsets by measuring cell surface expression of CD107a in the presence of the tumor cell line K562. Both NKp44 + CD103 + and NKp44 \u00c0 CD103 \u00c0 ILC1 expressed more CD107a than ILC3 ( Figure 1F ). We conclude that NKp44 + CD103 + and NKp44 \u00c0 CD103 \u00c0 ILC1 not only produce IFN-g but can also release lytic mediators when activating receptors are engaged by cognate ligands expressed on target cells.\n\nNKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 Have an Intraepithelial Location CD103 promotes the interaction of lymphocytes with epithelial cells by binding E-cadherin (Cepek et al., 1994) and is a marker of intraepithelial T lymphocytes (Cheroutre et al., 2011; Sheridan and Lefran\u00e7 ois, 2010) . The majority of NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 expressed additional intraepithelial lymphocyte markers, such as CD160, which has been recently shown to bind to HVEM on epithelial cells promoting epithelial cell defense mechanisms (A) Left shows expression of NKp44 and CD103 on tonsil CD56 + cells, gated on live CD3 \u00c0 CD19 \u00c0 cells. Right shows that tonsil CD56 + cells were stimulated with IL-23 and stained for intracellular IL-22. Cells were gated on the NKp44 + and the NKp44 \u00c0 fractions. (B) Surface markers of tonsilar NKp44 + CD103 + cells (red lines), ILC3 (NKp44 + CD103 \u00c0 , blue lines), and NKp44 \u00c0 CD103 \u00c0 cells (black lines). (C) After stimulation in vitro with PMA and ionomycin, cytokine content of tonsil CD56 + cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. Data displayed are the frequencies of cytokine-positive cells within NKp44 + CD103 + cells, ILC3, and NKp44 \u00c0 CD103 \u00c0 cells obtained from 5 to 13 different donors. (D) Tonsil and peripheral blood CD56 + cells were cultured with IL-12, IL-15, IL-18, or with combinations of these cytokines. After 9 hr, tonsil NKp44 + CD103 + cells, tonsil NKp44 \u00c0 CD103 \u00c0 cells, blood CD56 lo (CD3 \u00c0 CD16 + CD56 lo ), and blood CD56 hi (CD3 \u00c0 CD16 \u00c0 CD56 hi ) cells were analyzed for IFN-g content. (E) Cytotoxic potential of NKp44 + cells was analyzed by intracellular staining for granzymes and perforin. Gray profiles indicate the ILC3 subset; black lines denote NKp44 + CD103 + cells. (F) Frequency of CD107a + cells following coculture of ILC subsets with K562. Shown are combined results obtained from seven individual donors. Data are represented as mean \u00b1 SD.\n\nType 1 Innate Lymphoid Cells in the Gut (Shui et al., 2012) (Figure 2A ), as well as CD101 (also known as EWI-101) (Allez et al., 2002) (Figure 2A ). Neither ILC3 nor NKp44 \u00c0 CD103 \u00c0 ILC1 expressed substantial amounts of CD160 or CD101. Thus, we hypothesized that NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 are intraepithelial. We investigated serial sections of human tonsils for NKp44 and CD103 expression by immunohistochemistry. We found that numerous NKp44 + cells localized in the epithelia overlaying the crypts and the surface of the tonsil, Figure S2 (A-D) CD56 + cells enriched from tonsils were analyzed for surface markers gating on live CD3 \u00c0 CD19 \u00c0 cells.\n\nRed lines indicate NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1, blue lines denote ILC3 (NKp44 + CD103 \u00c0 ), and black lines indicate NKp44 \u00c0 CD103 \u00c0 cells. Representative data from experiments with three or more individual tonsil samples are shown. (E) Tonsil CD56 + cells were sorted into the three subsets described in (A)-(D), and mRNA content for NEDD9 and ITGAE (encoding CD103) was analyzed by qRT-PCR. Displayed are normalized data from qRT-PCR experiments with three (NEDD9) and five (ITGAE) individual donors. Data are represented as mean \u00b1 SD. (F) NKp44 + CD103 + cells were sorted from tonsils, cultured in IL-15 with or without the addition of TGF-b for 9 days, and analyzed for CD103 and NKp44 expression. (G) Tonsil CD56 + cells were analyzed for surface expression of activation markers as in (A)-(D). particularly in ''lymphoepithelial'' areas where lymphocytes infiltrate the epithelium (Figure S2) . Fewer NKp44 + cells were found in the interfollicular areas, and none in the follicles ( Figure S2 ; data not shown). CD103 was found on a fraction of NKp44 + cells, and two-color staining with CD103 and CD3 confirmed the presence of CD103 + cells in tonsil epithelia that were CD3 \u00c0 and thus distinct from T cells ( Figure S2 ). We conclude that the large majority of NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 have an intraepithelial location.\n\nWe asked whether CD103 is part of a unique integrin profile that distinguishes NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 from other ILC subsets within tonsils. We found that NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 selectively express high amounts of beta7 integrin, which associates with CD103 to form aEb7 heterodimers ( Figure 2B ). Conversely, NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 expressed low amounts of CD11b (alpha M integrin) and CD11c (alpha X integrin). Additionally, NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 expressed high levels of the collagen-binding integrin CD49a (also known as alpha 1 integrin or VLA-1) (Figure 2B) . Notably, expression of aEb7 and CD49a is characteristic of CD8 Trm, which are also preferentially located within the epithelium and poised for prompt effector functions (Cauley and Lefran\u00e7 ois, 2013) . In contrast to NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1, NKp44 \u00c0 CD103 \u00c0 ILC1 and ILC3 expressed the integrins CD11b and CD11c and lacked aEb7 and CD49a.\n\nWe also assessed the chemokine receptor profile of NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1. Unexpectedly, NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 did not express CCR9, which has been shown to be a major chemokine receptor that drives lymphocytes into the epithelium ( Figure 2C ). In contrast, they expressed CXCR6, a chemokine receptor that was previously found on liver NK cells with memory-like features (Paust et al., 2010) and that mediates lymphoepithelial adhesion in the gut (Hase et al., 2006) . Thus, intraepithelial ILC1 express a unique repertoire of homing receptors that promote retention in the epithelia.\n\nIt has been shown that CD103 denotes a cellular response to TGF-b (Keskin et al., 2007) . Indeed, NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 expressed additional markers of TGF-b exposure including the tetraspanin CD9 (Keskin et al., 2007) and the integrin-signaling molecule NEDD9 (Giampieri et al., 2009) (Figures 2D and 2E ). Corroborating the influence of TGF-b in NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 development, we found that tonsil NKp44 + CD103 + cells cultured in vitro with TGF-b together with either IL-2 or IL-15 maintained CD103 expression, whereas in the presence of IL-2 and IL-15 alone cells survived and proliferated but lost CD103 expression over time ( Figure 2F ). By regulating the expression of integrins and integrin signaling molecules, TGF-b may promote adhesion of ILC1 to epithelial cells (Giampieri et al., 2009) . Interestingly, blood NK cells only engender few NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 cells when cultured with either IL-2 or IL-15 and TGF-b or supernatant from intestinal epithelial cell lines (data not shown), suggesting that, although related to conventional NK cells, NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 cells may have a unique developmental pathway.\n\nIntraepithelial NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 expressed higher amounts of the IL-2 receptor subunit beta (IL-2Rb or CD122), as well as the activation markers CD39, CD69, and SIRP-g, than did NKp44 \u00c0 CD103 \u00c0 ILC1 ( Figure 2G ). NK cell receptors, such as NKp46, NKp30, CD244, CD94, NKG2A, NKG2C, and NKG2D, were similar in NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 and NKp44 \u00c0 CD103 \u00c0 ILC1 ( Figure S2 ). KIR expression was very low on both cell subsets as it was on ILC3 ( Figure S2 ). CD57, which was previously noted on rectal mucosa intraepithelial NK cells (Sips et al., 2012) , was not observed on any subset ( Figure S2 ). Considering the entire phenotypic analysis of ILC subsets, we conclude that intraepithelial ILC1 express hallmarks of TGF-b imprinting and activation. The expression of activation markers on intraepithelial ILC1 is reminiscent of the activated phenotype seen on CD8 Trm (Cauley and Lefran\u00e7 ois, 2013) .\n\nTo gain insight into the development of intraepithelial ILC1, we compared all ILC subsets for expression of transcription factors that play a key role in ILC development by intracellular staining and RT-PCR. Both NKp44 + CD103 + and NKp44 \u00c0 CD103 \u00c0 ILC1 expressed T-bet and Eomes ( Figure 3A and 3B), which have been implicated in the development and function of conventional NK cells (Gordon et al., 2012) , but not RORgt or AHR, which drive ILC3 cell differentiation (Spits et al., 2013) . Foxp3 was undetectable in all subsets. Interestingly, NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 expressed higher levels of IKZF3 transcript than other ILC. IKZF3 encodes Aiolos, a member of the Ikaros family of transcription factors that regulates B and T cell development (Cortes et al., 1999 ) but heretofore has not been implicated in ILC development or function. Intraepithelial ILC1 Respond to Disparate Danger Signals Because NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 are intraepithelial, they may produce IFN-g in response to signals produced by epithelial cells. To test this hypothesis, we challenged an epithelial cell line with different TLR agonists. We then added CD56 + cells isolated from human tonsils to the cultures and analyzed intracellular IFN-g content in NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 by flow cytometry. NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 produced more IFN-g when incubated with epithelial cells stimulated with the TLR2 agonist Pam3CSK4 than with epithelial cells stimulated with the TLR3 agonist polyI:C or unstimulated epithelial cells ( Figures 4A and 4B) . Similarly, elevated IFN-g levels were detected in the supernatants from FACS-sorted NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 cocultured with Pam3CSK4-stimulated epithelial cells (Figures 4C and 4D) . (E and F) Tonsil CD56 + cells were cocultured for 9 hr with peripheral blood CD14 + monocytes (E) or monocyte-derived dendritic cells (F) pretreated with poly I:C or Pam3CSK4. IFN-g content of NKp44 + CD103 + cells was determined by intracellular staining.\n\nTLR2 agonists had no direct effect on ILC1 (data not shown). These results demonstrate that intraepithelial ILC1 are responsive to danger signals produced by epithelial cells.\n\nBecause IL-12 induces IFN-g production by intraepithelial ILC1 (see Figure 1 ) and is secreted by inflammatory monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs) (Trinchieri, 2003) , we asked whether NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 produce IFN-g in response to signals generated by monocytes and monocyte-derived DC. We challenged monocytes and monocyte-derived DC with different TLR agonists. We then added CD56 + cells isolated from human tonsils to the cultures and analyzed the IFN-g content in ILC1 by flow cytometry. ILC1 produced more IFN-g when incubated with polyI:C-stimulated monocytes and DC than with Pam3CSK4stimulated monocytes and DC (Figures 4E and 4F ). Altogether these results indicate that intraepithelial ILC1 respond to danger signals originating from both epithelial cells and myeloid cells. It is likely that epithelial cells transmit the dominant danger signals when pathogenic attack is limited to the mucosal surface, whereas monocytes and DC stimulation of intraepithelial ILC1 might prevail when the epithelial barrier is breached, leading to DC activation in the underlying tissue.\n\nWe sought to extend our analysis of NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 to the intestinal mucosa. We separated intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) and lamina propria lymphocytes (LPL) from noninflamed areas of human small intestine specimens that had been surgically removed to treat IBD. NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 were found primarily in the IEL and only in low numbers within LPL, corroborating our hypothesis that NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 are mainly intraepithelial lymphocytes ( Figure 5A ). In contrast, ILC3 were mainly found in the lamina propria. NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 from the small intestine expressed most prototypic markers noted on their tonsilar counterparts, including NKp44, NKp46, CD39 ( Figure 5A) , CD101, CD49a, and CD160 (data not shown). The only exception was CD94, which was poorly expressed on small intestine NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 ( Figure 5A ). NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 were also present in the epithelium of the colon ( Figure 5B ) but were not detected in nonmucosal tissues, such as axillary lymph nodes ( Figure S3 ) or peripheral blood (data not shown). These results confirmed that NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 are selectively located within the mucosal epithelium.\n\nImmunohistochemical analysis of NKp44, CD103, and CD3 in the appendix and intestinal villi showed that although the majority of NKp44 + cells are found in the lamina propria, some cells are located within the epithelium ( Figure 5C ; data not shown). Among numerous CD103 + cells detectable within the epithelium, some were CD3 \u00c0 , indicating that the intestinal epithelium harbors a small but detectable subset of NKp44 + . T-bet + CD3 \u00c0 are indicated (arrows). (E) Samples from ileal resections of CD patients (CD) and non-IBD controls (NC) were analyzed for the ratio of NKp44 + CD103 + cells versus CD3 + T cells within CD45 + IEL. CD103 + ILC1 among numerous intraepithelial T cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of T-bet and CD3 distribution in appendix and intestinal villi confirmed the presence in the intestinal epithelium of a small but detectable number of CD3 \u00c0 T-bet + ILC amid numerous CD3 + T-bet + T cells ( Figure 5D ).\n\nDuring IBD, dysregulated T cell production of IFN-g and IL-17 causes excessive inflammation, tissue damage, and loss of barrier function (Geremia et al., 2011; Strober and Fuss, 2011) . Because of their ability to secrete IFN-g and CCL4, intraepithelial NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 might contribute to the pathogenesis of IBD if inappropriately activated. We compared the frequencies of these cells in samples of small intestine surgically excised from Crohn's disease (CD) patients and non-IBD controls. Remarkably, we detected higher frequencies of NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 within the intraepithelial lymphocytes in CD patients compared to non-IBD controls ( Figure 5E ). Although low cell yields from these small tissue samples prevented functional studies, their increase during inflammation suggested that NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 are involved in the pathogenesis of CD.\n\nReceptor a We sought to identify the murine counterpart of intraepithelial NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1. To facilitate their recognition, we isolated IEL from Rag1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice. NKp44 is only encoded in humans, and CD103 was unexpectedly inadequate because CD103 + cells were hardly detectable within CD3 \u00c0 IEL (data not shown). In contrast, CD160 was an optimal marker of intraepithelial ILC1 because we detected a distinct population of CD160 + NKp46 + NK1.1 + cells within the IEL of Rag1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice ( Figure 6A ). Spleen NK cells did not express CD160 in steady state, corroborating the specificity of this marker for intraepithelial ILC1 ( Figure S4 ). Stimulation of IEL of Rag1 \u00c0/\u00c0 and C57BL/6 mice with IL-12 and IL-15 induced rapid IFN-g production by CD3 \u00c0 CD160 + NKp46 + NK1.1 + cells, mirroring the human ILC1 response ( Figures 6B and 6C ). In contrast, IL-23 did not induce IFN-g production ( Figure 6C ). The identification of the phenotype of murine intraepithelial ILC1 gave us the opportunity to investigate the transcription factors required for their development. Intraepithelial ILC1 were conserved in Rorc \u00c0/\u00c0 and Ahr \u00c0/\u00c0 mice, which lack ILC3 ( Figure 6D ). In contrast, these cells were dramatically reduced in the IEL of mice with knock-out mutations of Nfil3 or Tbx21, which encode two transcription factors previously shown to be master regulators of NK cell development (Gordon et al., 2012; Male et al., 2012) (Figure 6D ). Normal numbers of ILC1 were present in the IEL of germ-free mice and slightly reduced numbers of ILC1 were found in neonatal mice ( Figure 6E ). Altogether, these results indicated that intraepithelial ILC1 can develop independently of the intestinal microbiota and are more related to the NK cell lineage than to ILC3.\n\nTo gain more insights into the developmental relationship between intraepithelial ILC1 and conventional NK cells, we analyzed these cells in Il15ra \u00c0/\u00c0 mice. As previously reported (Lodolce et al., 1998) , these mice showed an almost complete absence of splenic NK cells ( Figure 6F ). However, intraepithelial ILC1 were minimally affected by lack of IL-15 receptor a (IL-15Ra) ( Figure 6F ) and maintained expression of CD160 ( Figure 6G ). These data corroborate that intraepithelial ILC1 are a unique ILC1 subset distinct from conventional NK cells.\n\nBecause the numbers of intraepithelial ILC1 are increased in CD and may have proinflammatory functions, we evaluated the presence and function of intraepithelial ILC1 in a mouse model of IBD caused by injection of anti-CD40 in Rag1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice (Buonocore et al., 2010; Uhlig et al., 2006) . Following injection of anti-CD40, Rag1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice rapidly lost weight and developed colitis as previously described (Uhlig et al., 2006) . Analysis of IEL isolated from the small intestine 36 hr after injection of anti-CD40 revealed a robust production of IFN-g by CD160 + NKp46 + NK1.1 + cells ( Figure 7A ), corroborating their early proinflammatory function in this model. IFN-g was also produced by a small percentage of NKp46 + NK1.1 \u00c0 cells, which correspond to ILC3 (Spits et al., 2013) . This observation was consistent with our previous demonstration that human ILC3 are functionally plastic. ILC3 can produce IFN-g when cultured in vitro with IL-7+IL-2, IL-1b+IL-2, or IL-7+IL-1b+IL-23, acquire responsiveness to IL-12, upregulate the expression of T-bet, and downregulate that of RORgt (Cella et al., 2010;  Figure S5 ). In vivo, the functional conversion of ILC3 into IFN-g-producing cells may occur when there is increased production of IL-15, IL-23, or IL-2 due to excessive activation of APC or T cells in IBD.\n\nTo determine whether CD160 + NKp46 + NK1.1 + ILC1 directly contribute to the pathogenesis of anti-CD40-induced colitis in Rag1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice, we depleted intraepithelial ILC1 and conventional NK cells with anti-NK1.1. Anti-NK1.1 treatment did not affect weight loss over a 7 day time period (Figure 7B ), suggesting that depletion of ILC1 or NK cells does not affect the systemic wasting disease. However, histochemical analysis of tissue sections of proximal colon revealed significantly less cellular inflammatory infiltrates and epithelial damage in NK1.1 depleted than control mice ( Figure 7C ). These results suggest that intraepithelial ILC1 may play a pathogenic role in IBD through IFN-g secretion.\n\nOur study extends the diversity of human ILC within the oral and gastrointestinal mucosa, characterizing a subset of human IFN-g-producing ILC, designated intraepithelial ILC1. Although related to NK cells, intraepithelial ILC1 were unique in that they were located in the mucosal epithelium, shared multiple phenotypic and functional features with CD8 T rm , and had several hallmarks of TGF-b imprinting. We also identified the murine intraepithelial ILC1 and found that they were largely independent of IL-15Ra, corroborating that these ILCs are distinct from conventional NK cells, which require IL-15Ra for development. Although sharing the NKp44 marker with human ILC3, ILC1 also clearly differed from ILC3 in terms of phenotype, function, and transcription factors involved in development. In addition to intraepithelial ILC1, we also identified a subset of human IFN-g-producing NKp44 \u00c0 CD103 \u00c0 ILC1 that may be related to intraepithelial ILC1 and perhaps can acquire similar characteristics when transiting from the lamina propria to the epithelium.\n\nILC produce signature cytokines in response to cytokine stimulation . Optimal production requires stimulation by a STAT activator and an NF-kB inducer, most commonly an IL-1 family member. For example, IFN-g-producing NK cells respond to the IL-1 family member IL-18 and the WT Il15ra -/-WT Il15ra -/- Figure 6 . Phenotype, Function, and Developmental Requirements of Murine Intraepithelial ILC1, See Also Figure S4 (A) Small intestine IEL of Rag-1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice were analyzed for the expression of NKp46, NK1.1, and CD160. The majority of NKp46 + NK1.1 + IEL (histogram, black line) express CD160, whereas NKp46 + NK1.1 \u00c0 ILC3 (histogram, gray profile) do not. Control staining of NKp46 + NK1.1 + cells is indicated by a dotted line. Cells in the dot plots were gated on live lymphocytes. (B) IEL from Rag-1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice were stimulated in vitro with IL-12 and IL-15 and analyzed for intracellular IFN-g. Cells were gated on CD45 + NK1.1 + cells.\n\n(C) IEL from C57BL/6 mice were stimulated in vitro with a combination of IL-12 and IL-15, or with IL-23 and IL-1b, and analyzed for intracellular IFN-g. Cells were gated on CD45 + CD3 \u00c0 NKp46 + cells.\n\n(D) Frequencies of intraepithelial ILC1 in the small intestine of Nfil3 \u00c0/\u00c0 , Ahr \u00c0/\u00c0 , Tbx21 \u00c0/\u00c0 , and Rorc \u00c0/\u00c0 mice and littermate controls. Cells were gated on CD45 + CD3 \u00c0 CD19 \u00c0 . (E) Small intestinal IEL of conventionally housed (SPF) or germ-free C57BL/6 mice, as well as of adult and neonate C57BL/6 mice, were analyzed for the presence of NKp46 + NK1.1 + cells. Cells were gated on CD45 + CD3 \u00c0 CD19 \u00c0 . (F) ILC1 within IEL are largely preserved in Il15ra \u00c0/\u00c0 mice. Left shows frequencies of NKp46 + NK1.1 + cells within spleen and intestinal IEL (gated on CD45 + CD3 \u00c0 CD19 \u00c0 ) from wild-type and IL15ra \u00c0/\u00c0 mice from experiments with four mice each. Data are represented as mean \u00b1 SD. Right shows representative dot plots from IEL from wild-type and IL15ra \u00c0/\u00c0 mice. (G) ILC1 from small intestinal epithelium of wild-type (black line) and IL15ra \u00c0/\u00c0 mice (dotted line) express similar levels of CD160. Cells were gated on CD45 + CD3 \u00c0 CD19 \u00c0 , followed by gating on NKp46 + NK1.1 + cells. The gray profile indicates CD160 on wild-type splenic NKp46 + NK1.1 + cells.\n\nSTAT4 activator IL-12. However, mucosal ILC1 differed from conventional NK cells because they required a STAT4 (IL-12) and a STAT5 (IL-15) activator, whereas the NF-kB activator IL-18 was not effective alone or in combination with IL-12 or IL-15. Given that IL-15 has been shown to be an important inflammatory mediator in gastrointestinal diseases such as celiac disease (Jabri and Sollid, 2009) , the responsiveness of intraepithelial ILC1 to IL-15 may be an important pathogenic factor in intestinal inflammation. Interestingly, intraepithelial ILC1 shared multiple phenotypic and functional features with CD8 Trm, which persist in the gastrointestinal tract, lung mucosae, and skin long after a primary infection has cleared and are very effective at preventing reinfection (Cauley and Lefran\u00e7 ois, 2013) . Given this, we envision that intraepithelial ILC1 are the innate counterparts of nonmigratory CD8 T rm . Epstein-Barr virus (Strowig et al., 2008) and human cytomegalovirus infection of tonsils as well as viral infections of the small intestine (Carman et al., 1986) may result in an accumulation or activation of intraepithelial ILC1, which are retained in the epithelium to prevent reinfection. It will be important to explore the relationship between intraepithelial ILC1 and the recently reported memory NK cells (Cooper et al., 2009; Romee et al., 2012; Sun and Lanier, 2011) . Like intraepithelial CD8 T cells, ILC1 also expressed CD160 and therefore may be the major innate trigger of HVEM-mediated epithelial antimicrobial response (Shui et al., 2012) .\n\nIntraepithelial ILC1 were unique in that they were located in the mucosal epithelium and showed several hallmarks of TGF-b imprinting, particularly expression of CD103, CD9, and NEDD9, most likely reflecting close interaction with the epithelium that produces TGF-b. TGF-b imprinting was previously observed in decidual NK cells, which are in close contact with the fetal trophoblast and presumably contribute to maternalfetal tolerance (Koopman et al., 2003) . However, in contrast to decidual NK cells, intraepithelial ILC1 had an activated-memory phenotype and secreted IFN-g as well as lytic mediators, consistent with a proinflammatory function. By inducing a unique profile of adhesion and integrin signaling molecules, TGF-b may be important for maintaining the adhesiveness of ILC1 to epithelial cells rather than inducing a tolerogenic function. Figure S5 (A) Rag-1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice were left untreated or injected with anti-CD40 to induce colitis. Thirty-six hr after injection, small intestinal IEL were isolated, and the frequency of IFN-g-positive cells within ILC1 (top panel) and ILC3 (bottom panel), gated as shown in Figure 6A , was determined by intracellular staining. (B and C) ILC1 contribute to the intestinal pathology during anti-CD40-induced colitis. Rag-1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice were treated with anti-NK1.1 to deplete intraepithelial ILC1, and colitis was induced with anti-CD40. Intestinal tissue pathology in the proximal colon was analyzed on day 7 after anti-CD40 treatment. ''Control'' indicates mice injected with anti-CD40 without anti-NK1.1 treatment. (B) shows the weight of mice recorded as the percentage of initial weight. Data are represented as mean \u00b1 SD (C) Left shows H&E staining of proximal colon sections at day 7 after anti-CD40 injection, showing more severe cellular infiltration in control mice compared to anti-NK1.1-treated mice. Right shows colitis score at day 7 determined from H&E staining of proximal colon samples. Data are represented as mean \u00b1 SD.\n\nIn our study we identified the murine counterpart of intraepithelial ILC1 as CD3 \u00c0 IEL that coexpress CD160, NKp46, and NK1.1. This observation enabled us to examine the developmental pathway of intraepithelial ILC1 in mice with targeted mutations of master transcription factors, demonstrating the requirement of Nfil3 and Tbx21, factors involved in the development of conventional NK cells. In contrast, Rorc and Ahr were dispensable. Although these results, together with the abundance of T-bet protein and EOMES transcript in human intraepithelial ILC1, suggested a relationship of intraepithelial ILC1 with conventional NK cells, we found that intraepithelial ILC1 were largely independent of IL-15Ra, indicating that intraepithelial ILC1 are developmentally distinct from conventional NK cells. It is possible that intraepithelial ILC1 are capable of exploiting other cytokines for their development, such as IL-7 or IL-2, or they do not require transpresentation of IL-15. Moreover, ILC1 expressed the transcription factor Aiolos, which may contribute to some of the unique developmental and phenotypic features of these cells.\n\nWe found that frequencies of intraepithelial ILC1 were increased in Crohn's disease patients. We also observed that intraepithelial ILC1 produced high amounts of IFN-g in Rag1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice treated with anti-CD40, a model of colitis characterized by wasting syndrome and severe intestinal inflammation. Although it was previously shown that IL-12 and IL-23 play a major role in the wasting syndrome and colon inflammation, respectively (Buonocore et al., 2010; Uhlig et al., 2006) , we found that depletion of intraepithelial ILC1 ameliorated proximal colon inflammation. Together, these results indicate that intraepithelial ILC1 are poised for robust IFN-g production, which may be important for orchestrating innate responses to infectious agents and preventing reinfection after elimination of the inciting pathogen. However, they may contribute to IBD when dysregulated.\n\nThe commercial sources of the antibodies used for flow cytometric analysis are indicated in Supplemental Experimental Procedures. Stained cells were analyzed on a FACS Calibur or FACS Canto using CellQuest and Diva programs, respectively. Dead cells were excluded with propidium iodide (Sigma Aldrich) or 7-AAD (BD Biosciences). Anti-CD45 was included in flow cytometric analysis of small intestinal lymphocytes to gate on live CD45 + cells. Flow cytometric analyses were performed using the FlowJo software (Tree Star).\n\nAll mice were maintained in a pathogen-free facility and animal protocols were approved by the Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) animal studies committee. Ahr \u00c0/\u00c0 mice were described before (Lee et al., 2012) . Rorc \u00c0/\u00c0 and Rag-1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice were obtained from Jackson laboratories. Nfil3 \u00c0/\u00c0 , Tbx21 \u00c0/\u00c0 , Il15ra \u00c0/\u00c0 , and germ-free adult female mice were kindly provided by Drs Paul Rothman (University of Iowa), Takeshi Egawa (WUSM), Anthony R. French (WUSM), and Jeffrey I. Gordon (WUSM), respectively. All mice were on a C57BL/6 background. Mice were used between 6 and 8 weeks of age, with the exception of those used to study neonate IEL from the small intestine, which were 10 days old.\n\nTonsils, intestinal samples, and peripheral blood products were obtained under the approval of the WUSM institutional review board. Tissue sources are described in Supplemental Experimental Procedures. Tonsilar lymphocyte suspensions and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were prepared as previously described (Cella et al., 2009; Cella et al., 2010) . IEL and LPL were prepared as previously described (Lefrancois and Lycke, 2001) . CD56 + cells were enriched from tonsil lymphocytes by magnetic cell sorting using CD56 MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec). ILC subsets were sorted from CD56 + cells as previously reported (Cella et al., 2010) and described in Supplemental Experimental Procedures.\n\nFor cytokine analyses, CD56-enriched tonsil cells were stimulated with 10 \u00c07 M PMA and 1 mg/ml ionomycin (both from Sigma Aldrich) for 6 hr at 37 C. 2 mM monensin (Sigma Aldrich) was added during the final 4 hr of culture. Alternatively, human tonsil CD56 + cells or mouse IEL were cultured for 9 hr in the presence of 50 ng/ml human IL-15 and 10 ng/ml human or mouse IL-12, or with 100 ng/ml human or mouse IL-23 (all from Peprotech). Cells were stained for surface markers, followed by fixation, intracellular cytokine staining and analysis by flow cytometry. IFN-g content in supernatants of CD56 + cells cultured with epithelial cells was measured by Cytometric Bead Array (CBA) (BD Biosciences). For degranulation assays, CD56 + cells were cocultured with K562 tumor cells in the presence of anti-CD107a for 5 hr. Cocultures are described in detail in Supplemental Experimental Procedures.\n\nTissue Immunohistochemistry and Immunofluorescence Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining of frozen or paraffinembedded tissues are described in Supplemental Experimental Procedures.\n\nqRT-PCR RNA and cDNA were prepared from sorted ILC as previously described (Cella et al., 2009) . Quantitative PCR was performed using SYBRGreen (BIORAD). Results were normalized to the housekeeping gene GAPDH and displayed as (mRNA [gene of interest] per mRNA [GAPDH]) 3 10 6 , using the following formula: 2 -[Ct (gene of interest) -Ct (GAPDH)] 3 10 6 . Primers are listed in Supplemental Experimental Procedures.\n\nRag-1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 50 ml of anti-CD40 ascites (kind gift of Dr. Antonius Rolink, University of Basel). To deplete ILC1, we injected mice i.p. with 200 ml anti-NK1.1 ascites (PK136) at days \u00c02 and 0 of anti-CD40 treatment. Mice were weighed daily and sacrificed at day 7 after anti-CD40 injection to analyze intestinal pathology as previously described (Uhlig et al., 2006) . To evaluate IFN-g production by IEL, mice were sacrificed 36 hr after anti-CD40 injection. Small intestinal IEL were cultured for 4 hr in the presence of monensin and then analyzed for intracellular IFN-g content.\n\nSupplemental Information includes five figures and Supplemental Experimental Procedures and can be found with this article online at http://dx.doi. org/10.1016/j.immuni.2013.02.010."}
