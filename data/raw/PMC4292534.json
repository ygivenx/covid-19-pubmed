{"title": "Early-warning health and process indicators for sentinel surveillance\nin Madagascar 2007-2011", "body": "The concept of surveillance was developed principally for control of the transmission\nof infections and for the early detection of outbreaks. The main elements of\nsurveillance methods have been described elsewhere. Surveillance is a continuous,\nsystematic process of descriptive information collection, validation, analysis,\ninterpretation, and dissemination for use in planning, and in the implementation and\nevaluation of public health policies and strategies for the prevention and control\nof diseases or disease outbreaks [1-3]. The public health problems approached in\nthis way, including acute and chronic diseases and environmental hazards, are\ndiverse, necessitating the development of tools for the timely monitoring of disease\ntrends. Furthermore, surveillance systems must be evaluated regularly, to ensure\nthat they provide valuable information in an efficient manner [4,5].\n\nEfficient disease surveillance systems are the key to the timely detection of\nearly-warning signs potentially signalling the occurrence of disease outbreaks or\nepidemics. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has highlighted the importance of\nimproving national epidemic surveillance capacities [6,7]. Recently developed\ninnovative tools, such as mobile telephone technology and electronic systems, have\nfacilitated the improvement of surveillance systems, by reducing data processing\n[8]. However, these systems are mostly\nimplemented in high-income countries [9], as\nmost developing countries are faced with logistic and budgetary constraints,\nresulting in low-quality surveillance systems based on pen-and-paper methods. In\nmany cases, these low-tech systems provide health institutions with inadequate\nsupport, resulting in frequent \u201chealth crises\u201d [10]. Moreover, the healthcare infrastructure, laboratory\ndiagnostic capacity, skills and number of physicians in these countries are\ngenerally insufficient to deal with emerging diseases likely to cause epidemics.\nConsequently, delays in raising the alarm often limit the possibility of an\neffective early response to new, emerging public health problems.\n\nThe need for an efficient sentinel surveillance network in Madagascar was highlighted\nby worldwide infectious disease threats to public health, such as severe acute\nrespiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, avian influenza A H5N1 in 2005 and the\nChikungunya epidemics observed in the Indian Ocean region in 2006. In addition, the\n2005 International Health Regulations stressed the importance of commitment to the\ngoal of global security and asked all member states to establish and implement\neffective surveillance and response systems, making it possible to detect and\ncontain public health threats of national and international importance. As a result,\nthe government of Madagascar, in partnership with the Institut Pasteur de\nMadagascar, established 13 fever sentinel sites in 2007, expanding the network to 34\nsites by 2011, to improve the timely detection and management of febrile disease\noutbreaks. Two key attributes of the sentinel surveillance system are monitored\ncontinuously: timeliness and data quality. This system was designed to identify\noutbreaks for which public health interventions may be required early enough for\nsuch interventions to be effective.\n\nWe report here the indicators, for 2007 to 2011, of the syndromic sentinel\nsurveillance network, presenting spatiotemporal trends, alert detection capability\nand evaluations of the process on the basis of timeliness and quality data.\n\nThe surveillance protocol was approved by the MoH and the National Ethics\nCommittee of Madagascar.\n\nFrom 2007 to 2011, 21 alerts resulting from syndromic surveillance were\nconfirmed by biological surveillance and led to a response and\nepidemiological investigations to assess the risk.\n\nIn October 2008, in Morondava, on the west coast of Madagascar, an increase\nin the percentage of febrile syndromes and the percentage of ILI cases was\nrecorded. Samples were requested and influenza virus A (H3N2) was\ndetected.\n\nIn January 2009, an increase in the percentage of febrile syndromes and in\nthe number of confirmed malaria cases was identified, leading to an\ninvestigation of factors potentially associated with an increase in malaria\ntransmission.\n\nIn 2010, excess cases of dengue-like syndromes were declared in Mananjary\nhealth district, which is located on the southeast coast. The Chikungunya\nvirus was identified and the epidemic confirmed.\n\nNone of these events were detected by the routine surveillance system.\nHowever, there was no organised response to any of these outbreaks because\nthe MoH lacked the means to deal with these large events.\n\nRelevant process indicators have been identified for the monitoring of the\nnetwork. These indicators are presented in Table 2 and concern principally the data transmission and data\nvalidation processes.\n\nOverall, 85% of the data were transmitted within the 24-hour time frame. This\nindicator was introduced in 2008. The percentage of data for which\ntransmission was delayed increased from 2008 (12.3%) to 2011 (32.6%), and\nconsiderable differences between sentinel sites were observed for this\nindicator (Table 3).\n\nAs previously described [11,12], an individual fever form had to be\ncompleted and sent to the IPM for each declared case of febrile syndrome.\nThe fever forms were used to validate the syndrome data transmitted by SMS.\nSpecific forms relating to fever were completed for 82,333 of the patients\npresenting fever (80.6%). In 2007, 99.9% of the febrile syndromes were\ndocumented on a fever form, but this percentage had fallen to 63.4% by\n2011.\n\nThe sex ratio (male/female) for those with febrile syndromes was 0.88. Age\nwas known for 81,981 patients (99.5%), and the mean age of the patients was\n12.5 years (CI 95%: [12.4-12.7]). The age-group distribution is presented in\nTable 4. ILI, defined on the\nbasis of the symptoms noted on the fever forms (fever and cough, or fever\nand sore throat), accounted for 49.4% (40,709) of all cases of febrile\nillness, but significant differences in these percentages\n(p<0.01) were found between years: 49.2%\n(4,739/9,633) in 2007, 53.6% (8,884/16,579) in 2008, 55.6% (11,102/19,969)\nin 2009, 42.8% (8,563/19,992) in 2010 and 45.9% (7,421/16,160) in 2011.\n\nThe sentinel surveillance system in Madagascar has two key functions: it provides an\nearly warning of potential threats to public health and it can be used to manage\npublic health programmes, by providing data for malaria indicators, for example. It\ncan rapidly detect unexpected increases in the incidence of fever or diarrhoea\nsyndromes and the biological surveillance associated with the syndromic surveillance\nprogramme can then identify the causes of these syndromes.\n\nThis system has been described in terms of the methods used [11] and in relation to aspects of influenza surveillance [12,13],\nsuch as the spread of the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus [14,15]. During the\ninfluenza A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic, the circulation of this virus in Madagascar was\ndetected and the spread of the virus was followed from October 2009 to March 2010\n[14]. We have already highlighted the\nweaknesses of the routine disease surveillance system in Madagascar, which is based\non passive collection and limited capacities for diagnosis outside the capital city.\nNone of the early-warning signs was identified by routine surveillance. Routine\nsurveillance is useful for monitoring long-term programmes, but inappropriate for\nthe timely detection of aberrant patterns. By contrast, syndrome-based near-real\ntime surveillance can detect unusual events more rapidly [15-18]. This timeliness\nis a key element of the surveillance system and should be evaluated periodically\n[19].\n\nThe evaluation of surveillance systems should promote the most effective use of\npublic health resources, by ensuring that surveillance systems operate efficiently\n[20]. The sentinel system in Madagascar\nwas clearly simple and rapid, but we found that some process indicators tended to\ndecline over time, due to high staff turnover. The decrease in the number of fever\nforms received annually, between 2007 and 2011, is one of the weaknesses of this\nsystem. The increase in the number of sentinel sites increased the workload of\ncentral staff managing the different activities. A lack of co-ordination hindered\nthe training of new healthcare workers entering the network, and changes in\npractices were discovered only during supervision in the field. Challenges resulting\nfrom high staff turnover have also been identified in other countries [6,8]. The\nindicators used for the continuous assessment of the sentinel network in Madagascar\nare useful for a rapid, basic internal evaluation, but an external evaluation\napproach is also required, using CDC guidelines [21], for example, and including economic indicators as an integral part\nof the surveillance evaluation process [4].\n\nThe choice of methods used in the sentinel surveillance system in Madagascar was\nbased on the capabilities of the volunteer healthcare providers and the financial\nresources available. The Madagascan network has grown over the years and its\nexpansion is probably now limited by the human resources required to manage the\nnetwork and data analysis. We have found that progressive step-by-step\nimplementation is best, with assessment of the various processes, evaluations of\nnetwork management capacity and the training of healthcare workers, to make the\nprocesses more acceptable.\n\nDespite the results obtained to date, the sustainability of this system remains\nunclear, although data transmission costs amount to only about 2 US dollars per\nsentinel site per month. The Madagascan network has been supported by funding from\nvarious sources over the years, focusing on different health topics.\nSelf-sustainability is another challenge, as already described [8], and has already been identified as a\nweakness of this network. We therefore need to focus on the first steps of\nsurveillance system implementation and all system changes. Initial funds targeted\narbovirosis, because of the spread of Chikungunya epidemics in Indian Ocean\ncountries in 2006, and influenza, due to the threat posed by avian flu. However, the\nsteering committee subsequently decided to include other diseases associated with\nfebrile syndromes. This policy has been tremendously successful, making it possible\nfor the network to provide epidemiological information not only about arboviruses,\nbut also about malaria and influenza, throughout the country. In 2008, the first\nhuman case of Rift Valley fever was detected, by this network, at Taolognaro (in the\nsouth of the country), a site used for both syndromic and biological surveillance.\nFor malaria, the network has monitored the shift from control to elimination\nfollowing the strengthening of malaria prevention and control measures. The\nusefulness of sentinel networks for influenza detection is well documented and was\nassessed in the last pandemic period in 2009 [15]. Funding for work on these diseases has improved geographical\ncoverage and made it possible to extend the network over the last five years. This\nnetwork has become an additional tool for public health decision-making. The\nsyndromic surveillance has been shown to be an effective approach to surveillance\nand, thanks to the availability of large mobile phone networks throughout\nMadagascar, the cost of real-time data transmission is low. This surveillance method\nmay also facilitate compliance with the revised International Health Regulations for\nlow-income countries and the aim of the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network\n(GOARN) [22].\n\nHowever, the rapidity with which the system can identify unexpected events, which is\nseen as an advantage [23], must be weighed\nagainst delays in the response. For instance, the time required to conduct\ninvestigations and retrieve diagnostic and epidemiological information might negate\nthe advantage of rapid data acquisition, particularly in developing countries, in\nwhich it can be hard to find the resources necessary for investigations.\n\nThe lack of historical data made it difficult to interpret the syndromic trends at\neach sentinel centre. One of the challenges in our system is determining\nepidemiological baselines for each centre, to facilitate the development of better\nstatistical methods and more sensitive alert thresholds, as suggested by several\nauthors [24-28]. Indeed, five years after the establishment of this network, large\namounts of data are already available and data analysis methods have identified\ntrends for ILI, malaria and dengue-like syndromes in areas of Madagascar with\ndifferent climates. We now need to develop spatiotemporal models to increase the\nsensitivity of the alert detection process. However, limited geographical coverage\nand limited resources may prevent the detection of some epidemic events by this\nnetwork.\n\nIt is clear that the greatest advantage of this system is the ease with which it can\nbe implemented, thanks to the availability of mobile phones and mobile phone\nnetworks. Furthermore the quality of the homogeneous data collected will make it\npossible to improve the system relative to its principal objective: identifying\nepidemic events early. We recommend this solution for other African countries,\nbecause it performs very well and provides rapid benefits in terms of public health\ndecision-making."}
