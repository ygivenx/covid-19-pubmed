{"title": "Lessons learnt from 288 COVID-19 international cases: importations over time, effect of interventions, underdetection of imported cases", "body": "Twenty-six countries worldwide have declared cases of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, as of February 20, 2020 1 . Only China so far registered a widespread epidemic 2 , and authorities have implemented massive intervention measures to curtail it 3 . Outside China, affected countries are facing importations of cases and clusters of local transmission 1, 4, 5 Border controls have been reinforced in many countries, and active surveillance has been intensified to rapidly detect and isolate importations, trace contacts and isolate suspect cases 6,7 .\n\nThe effectiveness of such measures, however, critically depends on COVID-19 epidemiology and natural history 8, 9 , as well as the volume of importations 6 . The presence of an incubation period, during which infected individuals carry on their usual activities (including travel), is a major challenge for screening controls at airports 8 . Moreover, mild non-specific symptoms and transmission before the onset of clinical symptoms 2,10 may compromise infection control measures for importations and onward transmissions 9 . There is concern that imported cases may have gone undetected and contribute unknowingly to the global spread of the disease 11-15 .\n\nHere we systematically collected and analyzed data on 288 COVID-19 confirmed cases outside China. We analyzed importations that were successfully isolated and those leading to onward transmission, characterizing their case timeline. We developed a statistical model to nowcast trends in importations and quantify the proportion of undetected imported cases.\n\nWe collected all international cases confirmed by official public health sources in the period from January 3 to February 13, 2020. Case history was reconstructed by searching the scientific literature, official public health sources, and news. Case history included: dates of travel and symptoms onset, date of COVID-19 confirmation, date of hospital admission, date of case isolation, travel history, epidemiological link with other cases, hospitalization history. International cases included imported cases, secondary cases out of China, and repatriations. Cases from cruises were not considered here. Information was extracted by LDD and EO and checked by MM. The full database, along with the database describing clusters, were made publicly available 16 .\n\nFor imported cases with full information on the timeline of events, we computed the average duration from travel to onset, from travel to hospitalization, and from hospitalization to reporting. We used analysis of variance to compare groups of imported cases that generated or did not generate local transmissions. We extended the analysis to all imported cases combining cases with full and partial information on the timeline. We used the analysis of variance and multiple imputation for the missing data. Results were combined using Rubin's approach 17 .\n\nWe modeled the total number of imported cases out of China over time accounting for date of travel, delay in reporting, and source areas.\n\nWe distinguished between three different sources: Hubei province (H), the rest of China (C), other countries (O). We modeled imported cases over time as a piecewise exponential function depending on the source and on travel restrictions in place. We assumed a different situation in Hubei province and the rest of the world due to the level of awareness in the different phases of the outbreak. The exponential functions are defined as follows:\n\nwhere @ '() is the growth rate of cases coming from Hubei, and A '() , = '() , with A '() = = , the growth rates of cases coming from the rest of China and other countries, respectively. Travel restrictions were modelled by assuming a discontinuity in the growth rate. For Hubei, we assumed the growth rate to change from @ '() to @ '45$ after the travel ban of January 23, 2020 (indicated with @ );\n\nfor the rest of China, we assumed an analogous change from A '() to A '45$ after January 29, 2020\n\n( A ), date of first flight cancellations 18 . No change was considered for the other countries ( = constant over time), as no restrictions of travel were established towards these countries. The scale parameters of the exponential functions ( @ '() , @ '45$ , A '() , A '45$ , = ) were assumed to be different among the three sources, to account for different traveling volumes and dates of beginning of importations.\n\nWe modelled the time from importation to detection of a case with a gamma distribution, $ ( ), conditioned to the date of case importation, . $ ( ) was assumed to have constant coefficient of variation (SD/mean) achieved by a constant shape parameter and a rate parameter varying smoothly in time to capture change in surveillance efficiency.\n\nWe used a Bayesian framework to fit the model to imported cases by origin, travel date, and confirmation date. Cases with partial information (e.g. missing date and/or origin of travel) were included by defining latent variables marginalized out during inference. The model was then used to nowcast imported cases two weeks in the future. All details of the analysis are reported in the Appendix.\n\nWe analyzed clusters of transmission generated by imported cases (index case(s) in each cluster) to estimate undetected importations. A cluster can be seeded by more than one index case when local transmissions are epidemiologically linked to more cases traveling together (e.g. infected family members traveling together). We modelled the number of such 'cluster seeds', i.e. groups of index cases, with a multinomial distribution depending on the portion of cluster seeds of size 1 or greater than 1 (for simplicity, this was taken as 2), on the probability of detection of a seed, and on occurrence of secondary transmission. The likelihood function was a function of: the number G of observed clusters with one index case; the number H of observed clusters with more than 1 index cases; the number J of detected index cases not leading to onward transmission; the number of clusters whose index cases have not been identified; and the number of undetected imported cases that did not generate any cluster. can be estimated through likelihood maximization from the records of G , H , J, .\n\nWe collected 288 cases, including 163 imported cases, 109 local transmissions, 30 repatriations, and 1 case of unknown origin. Fifteen cases were classified as both imported and local transmissions, since they contracted the infection outside China and traveled to a different country once infected (ES01, ES02, GB03, GB04, GB05, GB06, GB07, GB08, KR12, KR16, KR17, KR19, MY09, TH20, TH21 in our database 16 ). Figure 1 summarizes the timeline of imported cases. Symptoms onset occurred after the travel to the destination country for almost all cases for which date of travel and of onset are available (68 out of 73, 93%). Complete information was available for 51 (31%) imported cases, with quality of information decreasing over time ( Figure S1 of the Appendix). .

Overall, the duration from travel to first event (whether symptom onset, or hospitalization for asymptomatic) was also longer, although the difference was not statistically significant (5.0 \u00b1 0.9 days vs. 3.7 \u00b1 0.5 days p= 0.08). Durations of hospitalization were instead comparable among the two groups of cases (1.5 \u00b1 0.7 days vs. 2.6 \u00b1 0.4 days for cases that generated or did not generate secondary transmissions, respectively). Including imported cases with missing information through imputation, we found the same trend though smaller in magnitude and not statistically significant (delay from travel to hospitalization 9.8 \u00b1 1.2 vs. 8.3 \u00b1 0.5 days p= 0.3; delay from travel to onset 5.8 \u00b11.1 vs. 4.2 \u00b10.5 p= 0.16, for cases that generated or did not generate secondary transmissions, respectively). This suggests that importations with missing information may be closer in characteristics to index cases leading to onward transmission.\n\nThe statistical model predicted a decrease in the average time from travel to detection from 14.5 \u00b1 5.5 days on January 5, 2020 to 6 \u00b1 3.5 days on February 1, 2020 ( Figure 2 ). \n\nThe model predicted a rapid exponential growth of importations from Hubei, with a growth rate The predicted trend of all imported cases over time is shown in Figure 3 , compared with the observed data. Reported importations are predicted to remain stationary in the second and third week of February and to rise again due to the effect of transmission clusters outside China. Imported cases after February 13, 2020 are in agreement with model predictions (Fig.3) . \n\nForty-two transmission clusters were identified out of China in the timeframe under study. Table 1 summarizes the size and country of each cluster. Clusters were grouped according to whether the index case: (i) was a traveling case identified prior to cluster detection; (ii) a traveling case not identified or identified retrospectively once the cluster was observed; (iii) completely unknown.\n\nAssuming that clusters of unknown origin were linked to one of the already observed imported casesor, in other words, not linked to an undetected imported case -led to an estimate of 76 [49, 118] undetected imported cases. In this scenario, detected cases would amount to 65% of all imported cases. Assuming instead that all clusters of unknown origin were due to undetected imported cases .

To contain it globally, identification, rapid management of cases, and contact tracing are key. The success of these response measures depends critically on the volume of importations 19 and the sensitivity of active surveillance 13,15 .\n\nWe reviewed here all confirmed cases out of China from January 3 to February 13, 2020 and gathered detailed information on case history and epidemiological links. We identified salient epidemiological features, and modeled the number of importations over time. International exportations from Hubei grew rapidly, fueled by the local epidemic, up to the closure of Wuhan airport preventing further travel of cases. Exportations from other Chinese provinces and other countries grew at a considerably slower pace. This is related to the difference in the increase of cases between Hubei province, origin of the outbreak, and the rest of the affected areas 1 . Such difference is likely an outcome of the implementation of containment measures in China 3,20,21 , and of the increased awareness at different phases of the outbreak 22-26 (i.e. before and after containment measures) leading to self-isolation and quarantine.\n\n.

The number of local transmissions is rapidly increasing in the Republic of Korea, Japan, and Singapore 27 , and few importations in Asia and Europe were registered already from travelers from Japan and Singapore. For this reason, certain countries have updated the history of travel for the case definition of a suspect imported case to include additional countries in South Asia besides China 28 or banned travelers from East Asian countries 29 . ECDC and WHO currently base their case definition on travel from China only 30,31 , but this may rapidly change in the next days.\n\nBefore the likely rebound of exportations, identification and isolation of possible clusters outside China remain essential to contain local transmission. The increasing reporting of clusters outside China with no known epidemiological link 1,14 raises important concerns on the possibility to contain COVID-19 epidemic worldwide. Our estimates indicate an ability of 36% to detect imported cases in countries outside China. This means that approximately 6 imported cases out of 10 have gone undetected. Previous estimates range from 27% 13 to 38% 13,15 detection rates, with variations across countries 13, 15 . Ascertainment was estimated to be even lower (approximately 10%) when assessed on repatriations 31 . Here, we excluded from this analysis all repatriation events and cruises with outbreaks, as conditions for detection and identification may be different.\n\nUnderdetection may be due to several different factors including asymptomatic infections, infections with mild clinical symptoms, health-seeking behavior and declaration of travel history, case definition, and underdiagnosis. Underdetection of imported cases is likely to be higher than what we estimate here, as our analysis is conditional to the identification of clusters of cases. The current situation in Italy, with different clusters emerging in the timeframe of few hours in different areas in the North of the country 14 , shows that clusters have gone undetected and epidemiological links with the index case are still missing. Countries outside China should be prepared for the possible emergence of several undetected clusters of chains of local transmissions. Surveillance efforts to track all suspect cases may become impractical if the number of cases increases too rapidly 32 . If that situation occurs, countries should be ready to step-up their response and take preparatory steps for community interventions. \n\nMRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis.
