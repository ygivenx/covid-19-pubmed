{"title": "", "body": "severe ataxia and hypermetria. Neuroaxonal dystrophy in domestic tri-colored cats results in a head tremor beginning at 5-6 weeks of age with signs progressing to ataxia and hypermetria. Affected kittens have a lilac color, which darkens with age. A similar but separate neuroaxonal dystrophy has been described in cats of various colors. Clinical signs begin at 7-9 months of age and include ataxia with paraparesis.\n\n\u2022 Storage diseases** (p 935) Sphingomyelinosis (Niemann-Pick type C disease) results in ataxia and tremors beginning at less than 6 months of age. Clinical signs progress to hypermetria, absent menace responses, and occasionally positional nystagmus. Death usually occurs by 8-10 months of age. Niemann-Pick type A disease occurs in Siamese and Balinese cats. Head tremor, head bobbing and dysmetria begin at 3-4 months of age. Clinical signs progress to ataxia and paresis, worse in the pelvic limbs.\n\n\u2022 Cerebellar hypoplasia*** (p 927) Cerebellar degeneration usually occurs in neonatal to younger animals due to congential deformities or infectious causes (panleukopenia virus infection). Cerebellar hypoplasia results from in utero or immediately postnatal infection with the panleukopenia virus. Clinical signs are most apparent when the animal begins purposeful movement and attempts to walk. Ataxia, dysmetria, intention tremor and absent menaces responses with normal vision are common clinical signs. Clinical signs usually remain static or improve with growth. No treatment is helpful.\n\nIf hydrocephalus is congenital, cats may have an enlarged, \"dome-shaped\" skull. A fontanelle that persists during maturation may be palpable. Acquired hydrocephalus in adults will show no outward anatomical signs. Clinical signs include seizures, poor learning ability, behavior changes, paresis, cranial nerve deficits and changes in consciousness.\n\nCongenital peripheral vestibular disease is seen in Siamese and Burmese cats. Clinical signs include head tilt, vestibular ataxia (cat leans, drifts, falls, or rolls to side of head tilt) and, in some, deafness. Signs may remain persistent throughout life or may improve spontaneously.\n\nRarely, thromboembolic disease or hemorrhage involves the cerebellum. An acute onset of cerebellar signs (incoordination, swaying from side to side, goose-stepping gait, intention tremor and reduced menace) in an older animal is most common with these types of diseases. A cat with polycythemia was presented for ataxia, possibly due to increases in serum viscosity.\n\nPrimary or secondary neoplasia involving the cerebellum is uncommon. Intracranial tumors such as meningioma and choroid plexus tumors can affect both the cerebellum or vestibular system and result in ataxia. Other signs such as an intention tremor, goose-stepping gait, menace deficits, nystagmus and head tilt may be present. Occasionally tumors of the ear cause peripheral vestibular ataxia (cat leans, drifts, falls or rolls towards the side with a head tilt). Neoplastic disease occurs more often in older cats.\n\nDecreased thiamine can result in brain stem disease in cats. Clinical signs initially begin with lethargy, inappetence and reluctance to walk. Later there is vestibular ataxia and episodes of spastic ventroflexion of the neck or opisthotonos, dilated pupils, stupor and coma.\n\n\u2022 Encephalitis*** (p 930) Neurological signs are often diffuse and may not localize to a single area within the nervous system. Fever and leukocytosis are inconsistent findings. Systemic signs of disease such as fever, coughing, vomiting and diarrhea may accompany the neurologic signs. Feline infectious peritonitis, toxoplasmosis and Cryptococcus are more common causes of encephalitis. Non-infectious causes are less common but include feline non-suppurative meningoencephalomyelitis (\"staggering disease\").\n\nAn encephalomyelopathy of young cats reported in the United Kingdom had clinical signs of ataxia, paresis and \"head shaking\". Cats 3-12 months old were affected, however, the disease was seen in cats up to 3 years of age. Ataxia of the pelvic limbs was the initial clinical sign noted.\n\nClinical signs may reflect either primary ear, vestibular, or auditory dysfunction. Head tilt is most common, but nystagmus and vestibular ataxia (leaning or falling to one side) may also be present. A painful external ear and or pain on opening the mouth is often present. The facial nerve may be involved. On otoscopic examination, the tympanic membrane is often discolored (hyperemic), opaque and bulging outward with middle ear disease.\n\n\u2022 Idiopathic peripheral vestibular disease*** (p 931) Acute onset of peripheral vestibular signs with nystagmus (horizontal or rotary), head tilt (toward the side of the lesion), rolling and falling. No other neurological signs are seen. Clinical signs, while initially severe, are restricted to the vestibular system. Otoscopic examination, bulla radiographs and other advanced imaging studies (computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR) imaging) are normal. Signs usually improve dramatically in 1-2 weeks regardless of treatment.\n\n\u2022 Head trauma*** (p 932)\n\nUsually associated with an acute onset of clinical signs reflective of an intracranial problem. Signs present often include alterations in consciousness, paresis and cranial nerve abnormalities. Fresh blood from lacerations on or around the head, skull fractures, blood in the ear canals, and scleral hemorrhage may be clues to a previous traumatic incident.\n\n\u2022 Toxins* (p 938) Metronidazole at high doses has been reported to result in ataxia as the initial clinical sign. Paresis is usually present, and seizures and cortical blindness may also be noted. Bromethalin\n\nAtaxia is an abnormality of movement wherein the animal does not move in a straight line when walking but rather sways or falls, usually from side to side.\n\nAtaxia indicates a problem with unconscious, sensory proprioception.\n\nLack of unconscious, sensory proprioceptive information can also result in dysmetria, including hypermetria (\"goose-stepping\"; overflexing of the limbs when walking) and hypometria (failure to flex and extend the limb properly) resulting in a \"stiff\" appearance of limb movement, and tremor.\n\nDisease of the cerebellum, central controlling centers for movement, or sensory pathways traveling from the spinal cord to the cerebellum are often affected.\n\nDisease of the vestibular system may also result in ataxia and incoordination.\n\nDiseases of the spinal cord can result in ataxia due to involvement of the spinocerebellar pathways.\n\nDiseases of the intracranial nervous system resulting in ataxia often involve the cerebellum.\n\nThese include cerebellar hypoplasia (panleukopenia virus infection), hydrocephalus, storage disease, tumors, encephalitis and vascular-based diseases.\n\nDiseases of the vestibular system include those affecting the central vestibular areas (developmental diseases, hydrocephalus, storage disease, tumors, encephalitis and vascular-based diseases) and peripheral vestibular areas (congenital vestibular disease, trauma, otitis media/interna, idiopathic vestibular disease and tumors).\n\nDiseases of the spinal cord include compressive, degenerative, inflammatory, vascular, neoplastic, and congenital diseases (see \"The Cat With Limb Weakness\"). Chlorhexidine solution used to clean the external ear may result in vestibular signs.\n\nThis virus destroys the external germinal layer of the cerebellum and prevents the formation of the granular layer.\n\nSome affected cats have a concurrent hydrocephalus and hydranencephaly.\n\nClinical signs are present from the early prenatal period but are most apparent when the animal begins purposeful movement and attempts to walk.\n\nTremor accompanying the disease usually has a slow frequency (2-6 times/second) and large amplitude (course tremor). The tremor worsens (increases in frequency or amplitude), when the cat moves in a goaloriented way (e.g. bends down to eat), which is termed an intention tremor.\n\nOther signs include ataxia (incoordination; swaying from side to side), hypermetria (\"goose-stepping\"; overflexing of the limbs when walking), menace deficits (with normal vision and pupillary light reflexes), head tilt and nystagmus (combination quick followed by slow movement of the eyes).\n\nClinical signs usually remain static or improve with growth as the cat compensates, causing the tremor to become less apparent.\n\nAntemortem testing for panleukopenia often results in negative findings.\n\nDefinitive diagnosis is usually only obtained at necropsy and histopathological examination of the nervous tissue.\n\nIn some instances of cerebellar atrophy, a smaller than normal cerebellum may be seen on magnetic resonance imaging of the intracranial nervous system. This is most readily seen on the sagittal view.\n\nOccasionally, inflammatory cells may be present in cerebrospinal fluid examination in cats with active panleukopenia viral infection. Cerebrospinal fluid with the other degenerative cerebellar conditions and with previous panleukopenia infection is usually normal.\n\nIn this age of cat, other inflammatory central nervous system abnormalities such as toxoplasmosis infection are possible.\n\nCongenital anatomical defects of the cerebellum may cause similar signs.\n\nTrauma occurring at a young age may permanently damage the cerebellum producing similar signs.\n\nNo treatment is currently helpful for cats affected with this disease.\n\nClinical signs associated with previous panleukopenia virus infection of the developing cerebellum usually remain static or improve with growth, causing the tremor to become less apparent.\n\nDo not vaccinate queens with modified live panleukopenia virus vaccine.\n\n\u2022 Signs usually begin in cats 5 years of age or older. \u2022 Signs usually are progressive over weeks to months. \u2022 Occasionally, clinical signs begin acutely. \u2022 Intention tremor is often associated with other signs of cerebellar disease including ataxia, dysmetria, menace deficits, head tilt and nystagmus.\n\nSee main reference on page 821 for details (The Cat With Stupor or Coma).\n\nClinical signs usually begin in cats 5 years of age or older.\n\nSigns are usually progressive over weeks to months.\n\nIntention tremor is often associated with other signs of cerebellar disease including ataxia (incoordination; swaying from side to side), dysmetria (\"goose-stepping\"; overflexing of the limbs when walking), menace deficits (with normal vision and pupillary light reflexes), head tilt, and nystagmus (combination quick followed by slow movement of the eyes).\n\nSigns reflect either primary nervous parenchymal damage from the tumor or secondary pathophysiological sequelae such as hemorrhage and edema.\n\nMeningiomas are the most common brain tumor in cats and are usually histologically benign.\n\n\u2022 Less-frequent tumors arise from astrocytes, oligodendrogliocytes, ependymal cells and choroid plexus cells. \u2022 Medulloblastoma is a rare primary brain tumor that involves the cerebellum. \u2022 Neoplasia may also secondarily involve the brain via metastasis or via direct extension from extraneural sites.\n\nTumors involving the inner ear may damage the peripheral vestibular system, resulting in vestibular ataxia, in which the cat leans, drifts, falls or rolls toward the side of the lesion and has a head tilt. Nystagmus may also be present. Occasionally tumors extend through the tympanic membrane and are evident during otoscopic examination, but this is rare. See page 845 \"The Cat With a Head Tilt, Vestibular Ataxia or Nystagmus\".\n\nSquamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma are the most common tumors affecting the peripheral vestibular system.\n\nRoutine laboratory data (e.g. hematology, biochemistry, urinalysis) are normal.\n\nDiagnosis of a structural intracranial abnormality in the brain is most readily accomplished with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging or computed tomography (CT) of the brain.\n\n\u2022 A broad-based, extra-axial (arising outside and pushing into the parenchyma) contrast-enhancing mass on CT or MR imaging is found in most instances of meningioma. \u2022 The CT and MR appearance of gliomas is varied and enhancement after contrast administration may not be present. As these tumors arise from brain parenchymal cells, they are found within the neuroaxis (intra-axial). \u2022 Choroid plexus tumors often enhance markedly after contrast administration because of the increased concentration of blood vessels within the tumor. Because of their association with the ventricular system, associated hydrocephalus is common.\n\nCerebrospinal fluid often has increased protein concentration but this finding is not pathognomonic for neoplasia.\n\nCerebrospinal fluid may have evidence of inflammation (increased nucelated cells and protein content). If CSF is the only assessment made, encephalitis may be erroneously diagnosed.\n\nSkull radiographs or advanced imaging are necessary to assess the middle and inner ear. Abnormalities seen with these studies, however, are not always definitive for neoplasia, and tissue diagnosis at surgery is often necessary to accurate assessment. Destruction (lysis) of the bone of the bulla is more often associated with neoplasia as compared to inflammation.\n\nCongential and inherited cerebellar diseases occur in younger animals.\n\nCerebrovascular, traumatic and inflammatory conditions can mimic the signs of a brain tumor.\n\nCorticosteroids (prednisolone 1-2 mg/kg q 12 h) may reduce peritumoral edema and improve clinical signs.\n\nSurgical removal of primary brain tumors may be accomplished, especially with meningioma.\n\nA well-encapsulated, firm whitish mass is most often encountered at surgery in cats. Cortical parenchyma is usually not infiltrated but rather compressed in cats, leaving indentations in the nervous tissue parenchyma after resection. \n\nDepression, inappetence or anorexia and weight loss are common.\n\nClinical signs often reflect multiple levels of neurological involvement. Neurological signs may indicate diffuse or multifocal disease and often do not localize to a single area within the nervous system.\n\nParesis, gait abnormalities, proprioceptive deficits, cranial nerve defects, depression and occasionally stupor or coma may occur depending on the areas of brain involved.\n\nSigns such as intention tremor, cerebellar ataxia (incoordination and swaying from side to side), hypermetria, head tilt and nystagmus may occur with involvement of the cerebellum.\n\nCervical pain can be present.\n\nFundic examination is important to look for clues of systemic inflammatory disease as chorioretinitis, which is often present with diseases causing systematic infection.\n\nOther systemic signs such as vomiting, coughing and diarrhea may be seen concurrently.\n\nComplete blood cell count may show evidence of systemic inflammation (e.g. leukocytosis).\n\nSerum biochemical analysis may show evidence of systemic abnormalities if the disease diffusely affects the body (e.g. vasculitis) such as elevated globulin, CK, liver enzymes or creatinine.\n\nEvaluation of titers for the infectious diseases often helps to rule in or rule out the diseases.\n\n\u2022 Infectious agents causing brain disease include viral (feline infectious peritonitis), fungal (cryptococcosis, blastomycosis, histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, aspergillosis), protozoal (toxoplasmosis, neosporosis), bacterial, rickettsial, and unclassified organisms (protothecosis). \u2022 Involvement of the intracranial nervous system can occur with parasites such as Cuterebra larvae, toxocara and aberrant heartworm migration.\n\nCerebrospinal fluid analysis (CSF) will usually show evidence of increased nucleated cells and/or elevated protein content. Occasionally, CSF will be normal.\n\n\u2022 Evidence of inflammation on CSF evaluation alone, however, is not specific for primary encephalitis as other CNS disease (e.g. neoplasia) may result in a CSF pleocytosis and protein increases. \u2022 With feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), cerebrospinal fluid analysis may show a pleocytosis, with either mononuclear or non-lytic neutrophils as the predominant cell type and elevated protein concentration, often > 1 g/L (0.1 g/dl). High serum coronavirus titers are not diagnostic. \u2022 With toxoplasmosis, cerebrospinal fluid frequently contains a pleocytosis, usually with mononuclear cells, and occasionally, eosinophils. Increasing IgG or a single positive IgM serum antibody titer is suggestive of active infection. Animals with neurologic signs and positive IgM titers warrant treatment for the disease.\n\nWith cryptococcosis, identification of the organism from cytological evaluation of samples such as CSF, nasal discharge and skin lesions supports the diagnosis.\n\nA neutrophilic pleocytosis, and occasionally an eosinophilic pleocytosis, may be found on CSF analysis. If positive, detection of the cryptococcal capsular antigen in serum is usually diagnostic. Tissue biopsy and fungal culture or fungal culture of CSF may be more definitive in the diagnosis, as occasionally the serum titer is negative.\n\nWith parasites such as Cuterebra larvae, toxocara and aberrant heartworm migration, CSF may show inflammation with eosinophils in some instances.\n\nImaging studies (CT and MR) are helpful for defining structural lesions. Multifocal, contrast-enhancing lesions are usually seen. Occasionally, non-contrastenhancing lesions are present, especially with toxoplasmosis.\n\n\u2022 Signs can occur in any age but are commonly young to middle-aged animals. \u2022 Acute-onset severe head tilts and nystagmus are most common. \u2022 Cats often cannot stand initially and will continually roll.\n\nSee main reference on page 839 for details (The Cat With a Head Tilt, Vestibular Ataxia or Nystagmus).\n\nClinical signs are of an acute peripheral vestibular disorder with nystagmus (horizontal or rotary), head tilt (toward the side of the lesion), rolling and falling.\n\nNo other neurological signs are seen.\n\nOften these animals are initially so incapacitated that they are misdiagnosed with cerebrovascular accidents.\n\nClinical signs, while initially severe, will usually improve in 3-5 days. The nystagmus is the first sign to abate.\n\nIf Horner's syndrome or facial nerve paresis are also present, other differentials should be considered.\n\nDisease occurrence may have a seasonal bias. Cats in the northeast United States are commonly affected in late summer and early fall.\n\nOtoscopic examination, bulla radiographs, and other advanced imaging studies (computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR) imaging) are normal.\n\nDiagnosis is based on clinical signs and lack of evidence of other causes of peripheral vestibular disease on imaging.\n\nDifferential diagnosis of peripheral vestibular disease includes otitis interna, middle ear polyps in cats, and neoplasia (squamous cell carcinoma of the middle ear). These diseases can be differentiated from idiopathic peripheral vestibular disease because lesions are evident via otoscopic examination of the ear canal and tympanic bulla and/or with imaging studies (radiographs, CT, MRI).\n\nNo specific treatment has been shown effective.\n\nAntihistamines (diphenhydramine at 0.5-1 mg/kg q 8 h) may help some animals.\n\nClinical signs of idiopathic vestibular disease usually improve dramatically in 1-2 weeks regardless of treatment.\n\nThe nystagmus usually resolves quickly (within the first few days).\n\nImprovements in posture and walking occur within 5-7 days, whereas a mild head tilt may remain persistent.\n\nWhile most animals compensate well, some may have episodic ataxia when performing tasks such as jumping up on furniture.\n\nRecurrence is possible. \n\nExogenous injury to the brain occurs most commonly from automobile trauma, although gunshot wounds and falls may also occur.\n\nCerebellar involvement may result in intention tremor, decerebellate rigidity (extension of all four limbs and the trunk), ataxia, hypermetria, head tilt and nystagmus.\n\nSigns usually begin acutely after trauma.\n\nIntracranial signs most commonly seen include stupor and coma, paresis and gait abnormalities and cranial nerve deficits.\n\nEvidence of external trauma to the head and face such as facial lacerations, bleeding from the nose and mouth, bruising or hemorrhage in the external ear canals may provide clues to the traumatic etiology.\n\n\u2022 Occasionally, some animals that are incoordinated may fall and injure themselves secondarily, but this can usually be differentiated with good history taking.\n\nThe diagnosis of trauma is usually straightforward when the trauma is witnessed.\n\nIn some instances, when animals are presented with an acute onset of neurological signs and an unknown history, examining for external signs of trauma such as lacerations or skull fractures is important.\n\n\u2022 Evaluating the retinas and external ear canals for acute hemorrhage may also provide clues to the diagnosis.\n\nAdvanced imaging studies such as CT or MR imaging are useful, primarily for determining structural damage to the brain.\n\n\u2022 Dome-shaped or bossed appearance to the head or persistent fontanelles in a young cat. \u2022 Seizures, poor learning ability, behavior changes, paresis, cranial nerve deficits and changes in consciousness.\n\nWith Stupor or Coma).\n\nIn young cats prior to ossification of the cranial sutures, hydrocephalus may contribute to abnormalities of skull development such as a thinning of the bone structure, a dome-shaped or bossed appearance to the head or persistent fontanelles.\n\nClinical signs of hydrocephalus reflect the anatomical level of disease involvement.\n\nSupratentorial, vestibular and cerebellar signs are most common.\n\nAs the supratentorial structures are often involved with hydrocephalus, alterations in awareness and cognition are common.\n\nMany animals affected congenitally may appear to be less intelligent than normal.\n\nBehavioral changes, paresis, cranial nerve deficits and changes in consciousness may occur.\n\nCircling, paresis and seizure may also be seen.\n\nSeverity of clinical signs is not dependent upon the degree of ventricular dilation, but rather on a host of concurrent abnormalities including the underlying disease process, associated intracranial pressure changes, intraventricular hemorrhage, and the acuity of ventricular obstruction.\n\nThere are no pathognomonic clinical signs for acquired hydrocephalus in adult animals.\n\nRoutine laboratory data (e.g. hematology, biochemistry, urinalysis) are normal.\n\nHistorical, invasive techniques for diagnosis of hydrocephalus such as pneumo-or contrast ventriculography have been replaced by non-invasive diagnostic modalities.\n\nSurvey radiographs may suggest the presence of hydrocephalus, however they are usually not helpful for definitive diagnosis. Findings associated with congenital hydrocephalus include loss of gyral striations, separation of cranial sutures (diastasis) and persistent fontanelles. If hydrocephalus is acquired after the skull has formed, abnormalities are rarely encountered.\n\nElectroencephalography has been used to diagnose hydrocephalus, primarily prior to advanced imaging. Classically, slow-frequency, high-voltage (amplitude) activity is noted. This pattern, however, can be seen with other encephalopathies that destroy cortical parenchyma. Because of this, EEG is rarely used as the sole means of diagnosing hydrocephalus.\n\nUltrasound can be used to diagnosis hydrocephalus. \u2022 This is most readily accomplished when a fontanelle is present providing an \"acoustic window\" as ultrasound waves do not usually penetrate the skull well enough. \u2022 If the bone is intact, a craniotomy defect can be created. \u2022 For imaging of the lateral and third ventricles, the bregmatic fontanelle may be used. \u2022 Often, ultrasound can be performed in awake cats as a screening test to determine ventriculomegaly. \u2022 Depending upon the size of the fontanelle, the lateral and third ventricles as well as the mesencephalic aqueduct are usually easily identified.\n\nComputed tomography (CT), as a non-invasive intracranial imaging modality, is often useful in defining ventricular size.\n\nMagnetic resonance (MR) imaging also affords evaluation of the ventricular system. This modality pro-vides for better parenchyma resolution than CT, and is especially useful for evaluation of the infratentorial structures.\n\nDiffuse ventricular enlargement suggests congenital ventricular dilation or obstruction at the level of the lateral apertures or foramen magnum. Focal ventricular enlargement suggests focal obstruction or parenchymal cell loss.\n\nAnimals with an asymmetric appearance of the ventricles should be critically evaluated for focal obstruction of the ventricular system due to mass effect.\n\n\u2022 Signs are usually present from the time the animal begins to walk. \u2022 Head tilt and cat leans, drifts, falls or rolls to side of head tilt. \u2022 \u00b1 Deafness.\n\nCongential abnormality of the vestibular system usually involves the peripheral vestibular system.\n\nSiamese and Burmese cats are often affected.\n\nClinical signs are usually present from the time the animal begins to walk or begin early in life.\n\nSigns are usually referable to unilateral vestibular disease; bilateral disease is less common.\n\nThe most common clinical signs are head tilt and vestibular ataxia (cat leans, drifts, falls or rolls to side of head tilt).\n\nIn some cases deafness is also present.\n\nWith bilateral disease, there is no head tilt but the head moves from side to side in exaggerated motions. Normal physiological nystagmus (movement of eyes side to side with movement of head) is absent.\n\nClinical signs are non-progressive and usually decrease in severity with time, but remain life-long.\n\nDiagnosis is based primarily upon clinical signs.\n\nSkull radiographs, advanced imaging studies (MR or CT), CSF analysis and otoscopic examinations are normal.\n\nBrain stem auditory-evoked potential testing may be abnormal if there are associated problems with hearing.\n\nOtitis interna should be evaluated for.\n\nTrauma to the vestibular receptors is possible.\n\nNo treatment is helpful.\n\nClinical signs may remain persistent or improve throughout life.\n\n\u2022 Signs usually begin or are present in cats less than 1 year of age. \u2022 Signs usually are slowly progressive or remain unchanged. \u2022 Signs include coarse tremor, hypermetria, ataxia, intention tremor and menace deficits.\n\nCerebellar degeneration is usually an inherited disease.\n\nA hereditary cerebellar degeneration has been described in Japan in cats. An autosomal recessive mode of inheritance was presumed.\n\nCerebellar degeneration with neuroaxonal dystrophy has been reported in domestic tri-colored cats. This is inherited as an autosomal-recessive trait.\n\nClinical signs usually begin between 3-12 months of age.\n\nCerebellar disease usually results in a coarse tremor that worsens (increases in frequency or amplitude) when the animal moves in a goal-oriented fashion (intention tremor).\n\nOther signs of cerebellar disease that accompany cerebellar tremor include ataxia (incoordination; swaying from side to side), dysmetria (\"goose-stepping\"; overflexing of the limbs when walking), menace deficits (with normal vision and pupillary light reflexes), head tilt, and nystagmus (combination quick followed by slow movement of the eyes).\n\nAn hereditary cerebellar degeneration is described in Japan in cats with signs beginning around 7-8 weeks of age.\n\n\u2022 Signs include head tremor along with ataxia, dysmetria and intention tremor. An autosomal recessive mode of inheritance was presumed.\n\nCerebellar degeneration with neuroaxonal dystrophy in domestic tricolored cats results in head tremors and shaking. Clinical signs begin at 5-6 weeks of age and progress to ataxia and hypermetria. Affected kittens have a lilac color that darkens with age.\n\n\u2022 A similar but separate neuroaxonal dystrophy has been described in cats of various colors. Clinical signs begin at 7-9 months of age and include ataxia with paraparesis.\n\nSpongiform encephalopathy in Egyptian Mau cats results in ataxia and hypermetria, and it is presumed inherited. Clinical signs begin at 7 weeks of age.\n\n\u2022 Another spongiform encephalopathy has been reported in older Egyptian Mau cats in the United Kingdom. Clinical signs include muscle tremors, ataxia, dilated unresponsive pupils, jaw champing, salivation and behavior abnormalities. Signs may progress to severe ataxia and hypermetria.\n\nAntemortem testing for these diseases often results in negative or normal findings.\n\nRoutine laboratory investigations (CBC, serum biochemical analysis, urinalysis) are normal.\n\nDefinitive diagnosis is often rendered only at necropsy and histopathological examination of the nervous tissue.\n\nIn some instances of cerebellar atrophy, a smaller than normal cerebellum may be seen on magnetic resonance imaging of the intracranial nervous system. This is most readily seen on the sagittal view.\n\nCerebrospinal fluid with these degenerative cerebellar conditions is normal.\n\nJapan there is marked loss of Purkinje cells on histological evaluation of the cerebellum.\n\nNeuroaxonal dystrophy is associated with pathologic changes in the brain, brain stem, cerebellum and spinal cord.\n\nIn this age cat, other inflammatory central nervous system abnormalities, such as toxoplasmosis infection should be considered. CSF analysis and serologic testing help to differentiate it from inherited cerebellar degeneration.\n\nCongenital anatomical defects of the cerebellum may be present with similar signs.\n\nTrauma occurring at a young age may permanently damage the cerebellum and result in similar signs.\n\nNo treatment is currently helpful for affected cats.\n\nClinical signs associated with degenerative cerebellar diseases progressively worsen.\n\nAnimals are commonly euthanized due to the progressive incapacitation.\n\nDo not breed cats affected that have produced kittens with a presumed genetic or congenital cerebellar disease.\n\n\u2022 Signs usually begin or are present in cats less than 1 year of age. \u2022 Signs usually are slowly progressive or remain unchanged. \u2022 Signs include coarse tremor, hypermetria, ataxia, intention tremor and menace deficits.\n\nStorage diseases result from inherited (or less commonly, acquired) intracellular metabolic derangements that result in abnormal metabolism of cellular products.\n\nCellular products accumulate and afferent neuronal cells physiologically or mechanically, resulting in cellular dysfunction, and hence, clinical signs.\n\nAlthough signs of storage diseases are predominately referable to the brain and especially the cerebellum, some of the storage diseases also affect the peripheral nervous system.\n\nExamples include gangliosidosis, sphingomyelinosis, globoid cell leukodystrophy, and mannosidosis.\n\nClinical signs usually begin between 3-12 months of age.\n\nCerebellar disease usually results in a coarse tremor that worsens (increases in frequency or amplitude) when the animal moves in a goal-oriented fashion (intention tremor).\n\nOther signs of cerebellar disease that accompany cerebellar tremor include ataxia (incoordination; swaying from side to side), dysmetria (\"goose-stepping\"; overflexing of the limbs when walking), menace deficits (with normal vision and pupillary light reflexes), head tilt, and nystagmus (combination quick followed by slow movement of the eyes).\n\nIn cats with sphingomyelinosis (Niemann-Pick type C disease) clinical signs begin early in life (< 6 months) and progress to ataxia and hypermetria, absent menace responses, and occasionally positional nystagmus. Death usually occurs by 8-10 months of age.\n\n\u2022 Similar clinical signs have been reported in a case of type IV glycogen storage disease in a Norwegian Forest cat.\n\nBalinese cats. Head tremor, head bobbing, and dysmetria begin at 3-4 months of age. Clinical signs progress to ataxia and paresis, worse in the pelvic limbs.\n\n\u2022 An associated demyelinating polyneuropathy was found in one family of affected cats.\n\nAntemortem testing for these diseases often results in negative or normal findings.\n\nRoutine laboratory investigations (CBC, serum biochemical analysis, urinalysis) are normal.\n\nDefinitive diagnosis is often only obtained at necropsy and histopathological examination of the nervous tissue.\n\nIn some instances of cerebellar atrophy, a smaller than normal cerebellum may be seen on magnetic resonance imaging of the intracranial nervous system. This is most readily seen on the sagittal view.\n\nCerebrospinal fluid with these degenerative cerebellar conditions is normal.\n\nIn cats with sphingomyelinosis (Niemann-Pick type C disease) cerebellar atrophy, Purkinje cell loss, and neuroaxonal dystrophy are the predominant pathological changes.\n\nIn this age cat, other inflammatory central nervous system abnormalities, such as toxoplasmosis infection should be considered. CSF analysis and serologic testing help to differentiate it from inherited cerebellar degeneration.\n\nCongenital anatomical defects of the cerebellum may be present with similar signs.\n\nTrauma occurring at a young age may permanently damage the cerebellum and result in similar signs.\n\nNo treatment is currently helpful for affected cats.\n\nClinical signs associated with storage diseases usually progressively worsen.\n\nAnimals are commonly euthanized due to the progressive incapacitation.\n\nDo not breed cats affected that have produced kittens with a presumed genetic or congenital cerebellar disease.\n\n\u2022 Signs can occur in any age.\n\n\u2022 Head tilt and nystagmus are most common. \u2022 Discharge from the ear, abnormal odors and ear pain may be present. \u2022 Polyploid masses may be seen in the oropharynx or ear canal.\n\nWith a Head Tilt, Vestibular Ataxia or Nystagmus).\n\nClinical signs may reflect either primary ear, vestibular or auditory dysfunction.\n\nA painful external ear and/or pain on opening the mouth are often present.\n\nHead tilt and nystagmus are the most common vestibular signs. Vestibular ataxia (cat leans, drifts, falls or rolls to side of head tilt) may occur in more severe cases.\n\nThe facial nerve may be involved concurrently resulting in abnormalities of facial expression.\n\nAbnormal odors or discharge from the ear canal may be present.\n\nOropharyngeal exam occasionally reveals an ear polyp.\n\nOtoscopic examination should be used to examine the tympanic membrane. This may be difficult in animals with severe otitis externa prior to cleansing.\n\n\u2022 The tympanic membrane is often discolored (hyperemic), opaque and bulging outward with middle ear disease. Clear to yellow fluid may be seen behind the membrane.\n\nDiagnosis may also be supported by abnormalities on bulla radiographs or advanced imaging studies (MRI or CT).\n\n\u2022 Often the bulla are fluid filled on either skull radiographs or advanced imaging studies.\n\nDefinitive diagnosis is made through culture of the organism via a myringotomy or at surgical exploration.\n\n\u2022 Acute onset of cerebellar signs.\n\n\u2022 Head tilt, nystagmus, ataxia, hypermetria, and other cerebellar signs.\n\nInjury to cerebellar tissue can occur as a result of thrombosis or hemorrhage.\n\nDiseases that predispose to hypercoagulability or vasculitis predispose to vascular thrombosis.\n\nHemorrhage can occur as a result of thrombocytopenia or coagulation abnormalities.\n\nThrombosis leads to ischemia and cellular death.\n\nA cat with polycythemia was presented for ataxia, possibly due to increases in serum viscosity.\n\nClinical signs are usually acute in onset.\n\nHead tilt, cerebellar ataxia (incoordination, swaying from side to side), hypermetria, intention tremor and nystagmus are possible.\n\nMenace deficits with normal vision and papillary light reflexes may also be present.\n\nRoutine laboratory evaluations (CBC, serum biochemical analysis, urinalysis) may show abnormalities in platelets or red blood cell mass or evidence of underlying systemic disease.\n\nCoagulation studies and bleeding time assessment are useful in determining the cat's coagulation ability.\n\nAdvanced imaging studies may show evidence of hemorrhage or infarction in the cerebellum.\n\nCSF analysis may show evidence of hemorrhage, however, should be performed with caution or avoided in animals with coagulation or platelet problems.\n\nRule out other inflammatory, neoplastic and traumatic causes of cerebellar disease.\n\nTreatment should be directed at the underlying coagulation or bleeding disorder abnormality.\n\nRarely, if a hematoma is present, surgical removal may be helpful.\n\nPrognosis depends upon the ability to treat the underlying disease process and the degree of cerebellar damage. \n\nOccurs in anorexic cats or cats that are fed all-fish diets containing thiaminase.\n\nThis deficiency results in polioencephalomalacia of the oculomotor and vestibular nuclei, the caudal colliculus and the lateral geniculate body.\n\nEarly non-specific signs are typically lethargy and inappetence.\n\nThe earliest localizing sign is bilateral vestibular ataxia, which appears as an abnormal broad-based stance, loss of balance and vertigo.\n\nThere is weakness and an inability or reluctance to walk. The cat sits crouched with ventral flexion of the neck.\n\nPupils are dilated and non-responsive or poorly responsive to light reflexes.\n\nIf untreated, signs progress to semi-coma, persistent vocalization, opisthotonos, and death.\n\nEpisodes of spastic opisthotonos or ventroflexion of the neck and generalized muscle spasm may occur especially when the cat is lifted or stressed. They may be interpreted as seizures, but true seizure activity rarely occurs.\n\nNo antemortem diagnostic test is available.\n\nDiagnosis is based on clinical signs and rapid response to thiamine.\n\n\u2022 Metronidazole toxicosis results in ataxia, paresis, seizures and cortical blindness. \u2022 Bromethalin toxicosis in the early stages may also result in ataxia. Signs progress to paresis, depression, tremors, seizures and decerebrate posture. \u2022 Ivermectin toxicosis has resulted in generalized ataxia, tremor, weakness, incoordination, and miosis in a kitten. \u2022 Griseofulvin therapy resulted in ataxia in a 12-week-old kitten. \u2022 Aminoglycosides, administered either systemically or topically, may cause vestibular signs including ataxia. \u2022 Chlorhexidine solution used to clean the external ear may result in vestibular signs including ataxia.\n\nMetronidazole toxicosis has been reported to result in ataxia in cats.\n\n\u2022 Usually, this is associated with high doses of the drug. \u2022 As metronidazole is metabolized by the liver, however, toxic serum levels can occur with appropriate doses in animals with liver dysfunction.\n\nBromethalin toxicity results in vacuolization of the nervous system, most likely due to a lack of intracellular energy.\n\nAtaxia is usually the initial clinical sign of metronidazole toxicity.\n\n\u2022 Paresis is usually present, and seizures and cortical blindness may also be noted. \u2022 These signs in association with metronidazole administration should raise concern for toxicity.\n\nThe early stages of bromethalin toxicosis may also result in ataxia.\n\n\u2022 Signs progress to paresis, depression, tremors, seizures and decerebrate posture.\n\nIvermectin toxicosis has resulted in generalized ataxia, tremor, weakness, incoordination and miosis in a kitten.\n\nGriseofulvin therapy resulted in ataxia in a 12-weekold kitten.\n\n\u2022 Clinical signs remained static up to 4 months after the initial presentation.\n\nAminoglycosides, administered either systemically or topically, may cause vestibular signs including vestibular ataxia (cat leans, drifts, falls or rolls to side of the head tilt), head tilt and nystagmus.\n\n\u2022 Streptomycin and gentamicin have the most pronounced effects on the vestibular receptors, while neomycin, kanamycin and amikacin preferentially damage auditory receptors.\n\nChlorhexidine solution used to clean the external ear may result in vestibular signs.\n\nSerum concentrations of metronidazole will be in the toxic range if measured soon after clinical signs begin.\n\n\u2022 If there is a delay in collecting blood for drug concentrations after the initiation of clinical signs, serum concentrations of metronidazole may decrease into the normal range even as the clinical signs remain persistent.\n\nDiagnosis of other toxicities is supported by a history of exposure.\n\nOther diseases causing signs of vestibular disease include otitis interna, middle ear polyps in cats, and neoplasia (squamous cell carcinoma of the middle ear). These can usually be differentiated from toxicity on the basis of history, otoscopic examination and imaging of the bulla.\n\nThere is no specific treatment for metronidazole toxicity.\n\n\u2022 Discontinuation of the drug is imperative. A complete recovery is possible.\n\nNo specific treatment is available for the other toxicities.\n\nWith metronidazole toxicity, a complete recovery is possible after discontinuation of the drug if the signs are not severe.\n\nAvoid exposure to these products.\n\n\u2022 Ataxia, paresis, and \"head shaking\" in young cats up to 3 years old in the UK. \u2022 Ataxia of the pelvic limbs was the initial sign.\n\nPathogenesis is unknown, although a viral etiology was suggested but not proven.\n\nWallerian degeneration was noted primarily involving the spinocerebellar pathways and the ventral funiculus of the spinal cord.\n\nAn encephalomyelopathy of young cats reported in the United Kingdom had clinical signs of ataxia, paresis and \"head shaking\".\n\nCats 3-12 months old were affected, however, the disease was seen in cats up to 3 years of age.\n\nAtaxia of the pelvic limbs was the initial clinical sign noted.\n\nDiagnosis was made at necropsy.\n\nDiseases causing peripheral vestibular disease should be considered including otitis interna and middle ear polyps.\n\nNo treatment was attempted."}
