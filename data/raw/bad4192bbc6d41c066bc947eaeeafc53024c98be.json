{"title": "Evidence for RNA editing in the transcriptome of 2019 Novel Coronavirus", "body": "Emerging viral infections represent a threat to global health, and the recent outbreak of Novel Coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV-2) from Wuhan (China) exemplifies the risks (1, 2) . As viruses are obligate intracellular parasites, organisms evolved innate immune processes for 5 the sensing and the restriction of viruses. Among the processes involved is RNA and DNA editing mediated by endogenous deaminases. Two different deaminase families are present in mammalian species: the ADARs target double stranded RNA (dsRNA) for deamination of Adenines into Inosines (A-to-I) (3, 4) , and the APOBECs deaminate Cytosines into Uracils (C-to-U) on singlestranded nucleic acids (ssDNA and ssRNA) (5, 6) . ADARs interfere with viral infections directly 10 -through hypermutation of viral RNA-and indirectly, through modulation of the intracellular response (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) . On the other hand, APOBECs target the viral genome, typically DNA intermediates (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) , either through C-to-U hypermutation or through a non-enzymatic path that interferes with reverse transcription (21, 22) . Some APOBEC3 proteins can interfere in vitro with Coronaviridae replication, yet it is not clear whether their enzymatic activity is involved (23) . 15 Eventually though, both of these restriction systems are exploited by the viruses themselves to increase their evolutionary potential (24) (25) (26) .\n\nTo assess whether RNA editing could be involved in the response to 2019-nCoV infections, we started from publicly available RNA sequencing datasets from bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF) obtained from patients diagnosed with Coronavirus Virus disease (COVID-2019). While 20 transcriptomic data for all samples could be aligned to the 2019-nCoV reference genome, the quality of the sequencing varied among samples, and only two samples had coverage and error rates suitable for the identification of potentially edited sites (Supplementary Table 1) . We therefore called the single nucleotide variants (SNVs) using REDItools 2 only on the data from the two patients reported in Chen et al. (27) . We identified 487 SNVs, 41 from patient SRR10903401 and 446 in the patient SRR10903402 (Fig. S1 , Data S1). The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.02.973255 doi: bioRxiv preprint The allelic fraction of the SNVs ranges between 1 and 5% ( Fig. 1A) and there is a bias towards transitions (Fig.1B) . The number of transversions is compatible with the mutation rate observed 10 in Coronaviruses (10 -6/-7 , 28). On the other hand, the bias towards transitions resembles the pattern of SNVs observed in human transcriptomes (29) or in viruses (8, 9, 12) , where A>G changes derive from deamination of A-to-I mediated by the ADARs. The pattern we observe encompasses all possible transitions, with A>G and T>C being the main changes, evenly represented. This is compatible with the presence in the cell, during replication, of both positive and negative strands 15 of the viral genome. It is thus likely that also in the case of 2019-nCoV these A>G/T>C changes are due to the action of the ADARs.\n\nC>T and G>A are the second main group of changes and could derive from APOBEC-mediated C-to-U deamination. Contrary to A-to-I, C-to-U editing is a relatively rare phenomenon in the human transcriptome (29) and, with regards to viruses, it has been associated only to positive- The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.02.973255 doi: bioRxiv preprint APOBECs (9, 12) . As with A-to-I changes, C-to-U changes seem to target equally both RNA strands.\n\nSNVs are spread throughout the viral genome, with no apparent difference in distribution between A-to-I and C-to-U changes (Fig. 1C) . Since ADARs and APOBECs target selectively dsRNA and ssRNA, such distribution could derive from the presence at all times of RNA in a dynamic 5 equilibrium between double-strandedness -when negative-sense RNA is being transcribed-and single-strandedness -when nascent RNA is released. Some areas seem to bear less SNVs, but this is due to lower coverage.\n\nSimilarly, SNVs accumulate on most viral genes proportionally to gene length and sequencing depth ( Fig. 1D, E) . Only exception is the ORF6 gene, which modulates interferon signaling (30), 10 where the editing rate is higher compared to that of the other genes.\n\nSince APOBEC deaminases preferentially target cytosines within specific sequence contexts, we analyzed the trinucleotide context of the SNVs. After normalization for the genomic context, no apparent bias is visible for A-to-I changes ( Fig. 2A, B) . On the other hand, C-to-U changes preferentially occur 3' to thymines and adenines, as logo alignment clearly points towards a pattern 15 compatible with APOBEC1 deamination ([AU]C[AU] (Fig. 2B) (31, 32) . Moreover, the most frequently edited trinucleotide context is TCG ( Fig. 2A) , which is compatible with APOBEC3A pattern (UCN) (33) .\n\n. CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

Indeed, the genomic alignments reveal that a substantial fraction of the mutations in all strains could derive from C-to-U and A-to- 5 I deamination (Fig. 3A, C, E) and that a pattern compatible with APOBEC-mediated editing exists also in genomic C-to-U SNVs (Fig. 3B, D, F) .

These are the same editing levels observed for most of the ADAR-edited sites in the human transcriptome (typically inside Alu sequences) (3, 29, 34) . To understand whether A-to-I editing is an effective 10 path of restriction of 2019-nCoV, it will be necessary to assess if a substantial fraction of viral transcripts is hyper-edited (35) (36) (37) or fail to be packaged into virions.\n\nWith regards to APOBEC-mediated RNA editing, its detection in the viral transcriptomes is already indicative, as this type of editing is almost undetectable in human tissues (29) . Such The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.02.973255 doi: bioRxiv preprint Since most of the APOBECs are unable to target RNA, the only well characterized cytidinetargeting deaminase are APOBEC1, mainly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, and APOBEC3A, whose physiological role is not clear. As with A-to-I editing, it will be important to assess the true extent of APOBEC RNA editing in infected cells.\n\nThe functional meaning of RNA editing in 2019-nCoV is yet to be understood: in other contexts, 5 editing of the viral genome determines its demise or fuels its evolution. For DNA viruses, the selection is indirect, as genomes evolve to reduce potentially harmful editable sites (e.g. 12), but for RNA viruses this pressure is even stronger, as RNA editing directly effects the genetic information and efficiently edited sites disappear.

These filters allowed us to construct a high confidence set of RNA SNVs for both patients (Fig. S1, S2) . The SNVs identified in patients SRR10903401 and SRR10903402 are listed in Data S1. A diagram of the entire pipeline is shown in Fig. S3 . 5 Data manipulation and analysis R packages (44) (45) (46) (47) (48) and custom Perl scripts were used to handle the data.\n\nHigher gene lengths lead to higher probability of being mutated; hence, to investigate RNA editing enrichments on 2019-nCoV genes we normalized SNV raw counts on gene-length. Since SNV raw 10 counts correlate with sequencing depth (Fig. S4) , we normalized SNV raw counts on genes' average sequencing depth.\n\nConsequently, editing rate per gene has been calculated as follows:\n\nWhere N is the SNV raw count occurring in a specific viral gene, L is the gene length, and D is the 15 sum of the sequencing depth of the two samples.
