{"title": "QATAR CRITICAL CARE CONFERENCE ABSTRACT Safety of prone positioning in critically ill patients", "body": "We were able to facilitate prone positioning in 72 out of 110 patients with severe ARDS having a total average PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio of 84.4^30 mmHg. The patients were proned for a maximum of 16 hours in each session where up to three sessions were incorporated. No major complications were encountered during the proning sessions. This was thought to be accomplished through the coordination of a dedicated multidisciplinary team, education and simulation classes for physicians, nurses, and respiratory therapists, following appropriate inclusion and exclusion criteria for prone positioning, and implementing quality measures through Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles as represented in Figure 1 .\n\nResults: The total average PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio before proning for 65% of patients (n \u00bc 72) with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome 4 was 84.4^30 mmHg and after one hour of 16 hours proning, it improved to 180.3^78 mmHg. The remaining 35% of patients either had traumatic fractures, unstable spinal injury, severe hemodynamic instability, or morbid obesity together with ARDS which made them unfavorable for prone positioning. Out of those who were proned, 11 (12.5%) patients did not have improvement in oxygenation after proning due to non-recruitable lungs and were put on ECMO. The . Documenting cases with contraindications to prone positioning. "}
