A variety of factors predispose to pulmonary infection, including distortions in lung anatomy, decreased mucociliary clearance, and abnormal cellular and humoral immunity. Iatrogenic immunosuppression and that resulting from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection have led to the emergence of opportunistic infections that can present diagnostic challenges for the surgical pathologist. Because a variety of microbes can potentially infect the lung, and because the histopathology of noninfectious conditions frequently mimics that of infection, the differential diagnosis of procedure should be considered a first-line approach when a timely, accurate diagnosis is essential.\n\nAppropriate handling of the lung biopsy specimen is essential for obtaining the highest diagnostic yield ( Fig. 7-1 ). 8 Sampling of the lung for microbiologic culture should ideally take place under sterile conditions in the operating room, but the pathologist processing the biopsy specimen should try to ascertain that all necessary diagnostic tests have been ordered and be prepared to harvest additional samples for testing that may have been overlooked. When tissue is prepared for microbiologic isolation, the lung should be minced rather than crushed, because hyphate fungi (e.g., zygomycetes) may fail to grow in culture after maceration. 9 A pathologist should not place a lung biopsy sample directly into fixative without first considering a diagnosis of infection. If questions arise as to which tests to order or how best to transport the specimen to the laboratory, discussions with the hospital microbiology laboratory staff or a hospital infectious disease specialist will be of assistance.\n\nThe examination of touch imprints of lung tissue is a simple and rapid way of identifying pathogens. Touch imprints can be prepared from foci of pulmonary consolidation, necrosis, or suppuration and rapidly stained for bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi in the surgical pathology suite or the microbiology laboratory. Concomitantly, biopsy specimens may be harvested for ultrastructural analysis, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays, or research purposes. For large biopsy samples, it may be possible to cific and misleading. For example, \"organizing pneumonia\" in a transbronchial biopsy specimen may represent a nonspecific reaction adjacent to a focus of infection or malignancy, a nonspecific manifestation of chemotherapy effect, aspiration, or cryptogenic disease. For this reason, the findings gleaned from a transbronchial biopsy must always be thoughtfully correlated with clinical and radiographic findings. 4\n\nComputed tomography-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsies have a high yield in the diagnosis of peripheral nodular infiltrates. 5 Biopsies can be semiliquid, or they can include a 1-mm core of tissue. When they are performed with the assistance of a cytotechnologist, rapid diagnoses can be proffered by examination of stained smears directly at the bedside. Fine-needle aspirates are useful in diagnosing localized infections, and cytopathologists can also suggest the pattern of inflammation based on the types of inflammatory cell subsets in the sample and the presence or absence of necrosis.\n\nTransbronchial needle aspiration biopsy of regional lymph node groups is often a low-yield procedure, because nonspecific reactive regional lymphadenitis is common in the presence of pulmonary infection. 6 The procedure is prone to artifacts that may present diagnostic difficulties for the surgical pathologist. However, when adopted judiciously, this approach may be adequate for the diagnosis of infection. In one series, approximately 50% of cases of tuberculous lymphadenitis were accurately diagnosed.\n\nVideo-assisted thoracoscopic lung biopsy has largely replaced open thoracotomy biopsy as the optimal approach for obtaining large samples of lung. 7 The procedure is associated with modest and acceptable morbidity, has the advantage of allowing direct access to widely separated lung segments, and provides generously sized wedge biopsies of 2 to 3 cm. Consequently, this It has a dual blood supply: the pulmonary circulation arises from the cardiac right ventricle and carries deoxygenated blood at low arterial pressures to the alveolar surfaces, and the bronchial circulation arises from branches of the aorta and nourishes both the airways and the connective tissue stroma with oxygenated blood. All new growths within the lung, including regions of infective bronchiectasis, lung abscess, and tuberculous cavities, evoke neoangiogenesis from the bronchial microcirculation.\n\nTwo systems of pulmonary lymphatic channels drain the lung, either centrifugally toward the hilum or centripetally along the convexities of the pleural surfaces before coursing to the hilar lymph nodes. From the lymph nodes, organisms can enter the systemic circulation and spread widely throughout the body. Group A streptococci, for example, rapidly invade pulmonary lymphatics and course to the pleura to produce an empyema.\n\nMost microbes are small (<5 \u00b5m) and can penetrate to the distal gas-exchanging surfaces of the lung, although the majority are excluded by the defenses of the upper airways or are deposited along the conducting airways to be cleared by the mucociliary escalator. Humoral factors, including secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) and defensins released by airway cells, limit microbial penetration into tissues. Airway mucosal dendritic cells trap microbial antigens and transport them to regional lymph nodes, where they are processed and presented to both T-and B-lymphocytes, evoking adaptive immunity ( Fig. 7-2) . 11 Ulceration or thickening of the gas-exchange surface limits diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide. For this reason, the alveolus, under normal conditions, is maintained sterile by resident macrophages that scavenge inhaled particulates and secrete monokines, including interleukin 10 and transforming growth inflate the lung tissue with 5% formalin via a small (23-25 gauge) needle in order to optimize subsequent histologic examination.\n\nThe diagnosis of infection requires both an interpretation of the morphologic changes evoked by the pathogen and identification of a pathogen in situ. The pattern of pulmonary inflammation often suggests the route of entry of an infectious agent and may help to narrow the diagnostic possibilities. It is necessary to be familiar with the multiplicity of response patterns evoked by infection and to recognize that these can vary depending on the route of entry, pathogen load, and competence of host defenses. For example, whereas Human herpesvirus 1 can produce a miliary pattern of fibrinoid necrosis in an immunosuppressed patient with viremia, it can also cause ulceration of the tracheobronchial mucosa in a chronically intubated patient.\n\nMicrobes are rarely identified randomly or diffusely in infections; rather, they tend to be compartmentalized, so that substantial effort may be wasted in searching for them where they are not likely to be found. Mycobacteria and fungi are usually localized in areas of necrosis; Rickettsia and Bartonella species largely target the microvasculature; and viruses tend to attack the airways. The surgical pathologist must be acquainted with the pulmonary microanatomy and also with the preferential localization of microbes in pulmonary tissues.\n\nThe lung is an elastic organ composed of dichotomously branching conducting airways that terminate in alveolated surfaces. 10 Airway wall \n\nDisease of the gas-exchange alveolar surfaces can show a spectrum of changes, including acute ulceration and septal infiltration by chronic inflammatory cells. 14 Diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) represents a global injury to the gas-exchange surfaces that is caused by disruption of the blood-air barrier leading to exudative edema and fibrosis, and resulting in severely impaired blood and tissue oxygenation (Fig. 7-4) . The sine qua non of DAD is the hyaline membrane; it is composed of necrotic alveolar lining cell debris and an extravascular fibrin coagulum apposed to an ulcerated alveolar wall, which yields a gel that entraps lung water . Although DAD is the most frequent pathologic cause of the clinical entity known as adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), other diseases, including extensive bronchopneumonia and acute pulmonary hemorrhage, can also lead to ARDS (Table  7 -3). The pathology of the exudative phase of DAD can focally factor-\u03b2, that locally suppress inflammation and promote immunotolerance.\n\nIf the alveolar lining is injured, or if the number of invading organisms exceeds the phagocytotic capacities of resident macrophages, neutrophils and exudate monocytes are recruited to sites of lung infection. 12 Even small numbers of virulent pathogens can greatly amplify inflammation through the release of chemokines, cytokines, and complement by host immune cells. These defenses promote the clearance of infection but can also damage the lung. Lung biopsies afford the pathologist a unique opportunity to assess these dynamic responses directly, in addition to identifying a causative pathogen.\n\nA number of generic patterns of inflammation may be evoked by infection, but how they are distributed is often specific to the involved tissue (Table 7 -2). Clinicians and radiologists have developed classification systems with respect to pulmonary infection that are distinct from those of pathologists. For example, a variety of infectious agents yield a picture that clinicians generically term \"atypical\" interstitial pneumonia, in order to differentiate these infections from \"typical\" bacterial pneumonias, 13 but the histopathology of an \"atypical pneumonia\" may be centered on the lung interstitium, the small airways, or the alveolar spaces. Because this text is aimed primarily at surgical pathologists, pathologic schemas of classification are used, with reference to their clinical counterparts when appropriate.\n\nMany pathogens target the conducting airways to produce tracheobronchitis and bronchiolitis. Pathologic changes range from superficial erosion of the lining respiratory epithelium to ulceration and repair. The type of inflammation varies from intraluminal neutrophilic exudates ( Fig. 7 -3A) to airway cuffing by lymphocytes and histiocytes (see Fig. 7 -3B), depending on the offending pathogen. infection, and some viruses do not produce cytopathic changes, so that viral infection is always in the differential diagnosis of DAD (Table 7-4) . A common pitfall in diagnosis is to mistake the hyperplastic reparative alveolar type II cells of DAD, which can exhibit prominent nucleoli, for virus-infected cells, particularly when examining rapidly frozen sections, in which these changes may be especially prominent ( Fig. 7-7 ).\n\nInfluenza is a rod-shaped RNA virus that can cause either bronchiolitis or DAD without apparent cytopathic changes. Influenza infection recurs each year due to a high incidence of mutation of its hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) antigens, and these determine its virulence. When mutations occur concomitantly in both the H and N antigens, pandemics with potentially high degrees of morbidity may ensue because of the lack of immunity in the population ( Fig. 7-8 ). 15 Currently, epidemiologists are carefully monitoring the evolution of an avian influenza in Southeast Asia for evidence of spread to humans.\n\nmimic acute bacterial infection, and one must maintain a high threshold of suspicion for making the diagnosis of acute infection in this setting ( Fig. 7-6 ). Viruses are the most common infectious cause of DAD, although bacteria, fungi, and parasites also produce diffuse lung injury. DAD can result from sepsis that complicates pulmonary or extrapulmonary infection. Whenever DAD is present, the surgical pathologist must examine the lung for evidence of viralinduced cytopathic changes. These vary with the type of viral \n\nNovel influenza A (H1N1) is a new emerging flu virus that first caused illness in Mexico in the spring of 2009. The virus is of swine origin and spreads, like seasonal influenza, by aerosol transport but can also spread via fomites. Symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, headache, myalgias, chills, and fatigue; gastrointestinal symptoms have also been reported. In April 2009, the United States Government declared a public health emergency, and in June 2009, the World Health Organization raised the worldwide pandemic alert level to phase 6, indicating that a global pandemic was underway.\n\nThe disease spread rapidly, with all 50 states in the United States reporting cases. The infection can be rapidly diagnosed by PCR methods that are currently available in all state testing facilities. Despite reports of excess mortality in the herald cases Influenza is the most common cause of viral pneumonia, although most cases are subclinical. The virus most commonly causes a diffuse tracheobronchitis/bronchiolitis in which the normal ciliated respiratory epithelium is sloughed. 16 If DAD develops, however, it can carry a high mortality even in the absence of acute bacterial superinfection ( Fig. 7-9 ). 17 The lungs in DAD caused by influenza in patients with prolonged survival often develop prominent squamous metaplasia of the bronchial and alveolar lining cells (Fig. 7-10A ). Although these findings are characteristic, they are also nonspecific, so that immunostains, in situ hybridization, electron microscopy, or viral antigen detection may be required to establish the diagnosis (see Fig.  7 -10B). Superinfection by pyogenic bacteria, including Haemophilus influenzae, group A Streptococcus, and Staphylococcus, is a well-recognized complication and may mask evidence of a healing influenza infection. 1915 1925 1935 1945 1955 1965 1975 1985 1995 with high mortality. The lungs at autopsy showed DAD with scattered multinucleated giant cells of uncertain diagnostic significance. Otherwise, the virus produced no cytopathic changes and was essentially histologically indistinguishable from DAD due to influenza. 18\n\nRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes a benign respiratory infection in older children and has been recognized as a cause of adult community-acquired pneumonia, acute bronchiolitis, and DAD in the immunosuppressed host. 19 The infection targets the respiratory lining epithelium, producing syncytial giant cells with nonprominent eosinophilic inclusions ( Fig. 7-11 ). Human metapneumovirus produces changes comparable to RSV and must be included in its differential diagnosis.\n\nParainfluenza causes a benign upper respiratory infection in children that rarely progresses to DAD, although severe disease may develop in the immunosuppressed host. Like RSV, parainfluenza produces bronchiolitis and DAD with syncytial giant cells and epithelial cell intracytoplasmic inclusions. 20 However, the latter are both more frequent and larger than those seen in RSV ( Fig. 7-12 ).\n\nMeasles pneumonia is a rare and serious complication of the childhood viral exanthem. The pathology of pulmonary measles infection ranges from bronchiolitis ( Fig. 7-13A ) to DAD. The virus produces multikaryons with prominent glassy eosinophilic nuclear Cowdry type A inclusions (see Fig. 7 -13B). 21 The differential diagnosis of giant cell pneumonia includes RSV and hard-metal pneumoconiosis; however, the giant cells in the latter disorders lack intranuclear inclusions, and hard-metal pneumoconiosis specifically lacks the exudative features of an acute infection. in Mexico, at the current time, the incidence of lethal cases in the United States has not exceeded that observed for other types of influenza, and most patients recover completely without treatment. Nevertheless, there is prudent concern for increased virulence secondary to mutation and the lack of acquired immunity in most patients. For these reasons, efforts to develop a vaccine before \"flu season\" returns in the fall of 2009 are aggressively being pursued. When deaths have occurred, the cause has been acute respiratory distress, with DAD as the underlying pathology. Like other forms of influenza, the virus produces no diagnostic cytopathic changes. The risk of bacterial superinfection appears to be comparable to that observed with seasonal influenza.\n\nThe recent epidemic of the zoonotic coronavirus infection termed severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has not recurred. Infection with the virus led to acute respiratory distress nuclear clearing that mimic herpesvirus infection, but they more characteristically produce \"smudge cells\" (see Fig. 7 -14D), which show hyperchromatic nuclei extruding beyond the confines of their nuclear membranes. 22 The appearance of smudge cells can be mimicked by pulmonary cytotoxic drug injury or by epithelial repair in the early proliferative phase of DAD. For this reason and because of the potential overlap with herpesvirus-induced cytopathic changes, the diagnosis of Adenovirus infection should always be confirmed by immunohistochemical staining, ultrastructural examination, or viral isolation.\n\nAdenovirus primarily affects the immunosuppressed host but can produce outbreaks in healthy subjects living at close quarters (e.g., military recruits). Adenovirus typically produces (1) ulcerative bronchiolitis with karyorrhexis ( \n\nCytomegalovirus (CMV) occurs at the extremes of age or as a result of immunosuppression, and it is a common infection in patients with HIV/AIDS. 23 The number of cells showing cytopathic changes can vary considerably and parallels the severity of infection. CMV primarily targets pulmonary macrophages and endothelial cells, but virtually any cell can show cytopathic features. The most common distribution is bloodborne miliary disease ( Fig. 7-15 ), but bronchiolitis and DAD also occur. The diagnostic features of infection are (1) cytomegaly; (2) intranuclear inclusions with characteristic Cowdry Type B inclusions tions, Pneumocystis jiroveci, or opportunistic fungal infections ( Fig. 7-17 ).\n\nHerpesvirus types 1 and 2 both infect the lung. 25 The incidence of herpesvirus infection increases with immunosuppression and when mucosal barrier defenses have been breached. Herpesvirus characteristically elicits a prominent neutrophilic response that mimics pyogenic bacterial infection, but foci of necrosis, cell karyorrhexis, and piled-up viral infected cells with amphophilic nuclei confirm the diagnosis ( Fig. 7-18 ). Diagnostic cytopathic changes include type A or type B Cowdry nuclear inclusions showing molding of adjacent cells with multikaryon formation (Fig. 7-19 ). Immunosuppressed patients with herpesvirus viremia develop miliary foci of hemorrhagic necrosis with prominent fibrinous exudates (Fig. 7-20) . 26 Herpesvirus pulmonary infections also develop in patients with structural abnormalities of the airways or as a complication of primary infections of the oropharynx and esophagus. Intubated patients receiving chronic ventilatory support are at increased risk due to local barotrauma from inflated endotracheal tubes. The respiratory mucosa is the primary target ( Fig. 7-21 ). At times, extensive necrosis of an ulcerated airway suggests the diagnosis, but immunostaining for herpes viral antigen can demonstrate high background staining, obscuring the diagnosis. 24 If this is the case, examination of paraffin-embedded tissues by electron microscopy can reveal diagnostic virions ( Fig. 7-22 ).\n\n( Fig. 7 -16A); and (3) ill-defined amphophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions that are seen with H&E, PAS, and GMS stains (see Fig. 7 -16B). In patients receiving prophylactic treatment with antiviral agents, CMV infection may fail to exhibit cytopathic changes. However, immunostains and in situ hybridization continue to identify intracellular CMV antigens (see Fig. 7-16C) . 24 CMV is a frequent copathogen in the immunosuppressed patient and a cause of immunosuppression in its own right. CMV infection can be seen together with other viral infec- shows multiple calcified miliary lesions. Cases coming to biopsy or autopsy show miliary nodules of hemorrhagic necrosis in lung and pleura or DAD ( Fig. 7-23 ). 27 Infected cells with primarily Cowdry type A inclusions may be seen at the edges of the lesion, but they are harder to identify than in herpesvirus pneumonia.\n\nHantavirus was the cause of an epidemic in the Four Corners region of the southwestern United States in 1993. 28 The infection is a zoonosis transmitted by infected rodent feces. The most common radiographic presentation is diffuse pulmonary edema with pleural effusions mimicking congestive heart failure. Histologically, the lung shows pulmonary edema with scant, poorly formed hyaline membranes ( Fig. 7-24A ) and atypical lymphocytes circulating within the pulmonary vasculature (see Fig.  7 -24B). 29 Confirmation of the diagnosis requires specific immunohistochemistry, serologic evidence of Hantavirus-specific IgM, PCR, or ultrastructural identification of the causative virions.\n\nMycoplasma Pneumonia Mycoplasma are the smallest (0.2-0.8 \u00b5m) free-living bacteria, but they lack a true cell wall. They are facultative anaerobes, \n\nVaricella-zoster pneumonia is a rare complication of childhood chickenpox but is more commonly encountered as the consequence of reactivated virus in the immunocompromised host.\n\nAfter nonlethal pulmonary infection in childhood, the lung ous exudates (Fig. 7-25 ). 30 Similar changes are seen in both Chlamydia ( Fig. 7-26) and Coxiella pneumonia.\n\nEpstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been implicated in disorders ranging from the mononucleosis syndrome to malignant lymphoid neoplasia. 31 The mononucleosis syndrome includes pharyngitis, lymphadenitis, and hepatosplenomegaly. Pulmonary involvement can occur as part of the syndrome, but it is unusual and is rarely biopsied. EBV pneumonia shows patchy peribronchiolar and interstitial polyclonal lymphoid infiltrates with scant except for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, the most common pulmonary pathogen, which is a strict aerobe. Mycoplasma pneumonia occurs worldwide with no increased seasonal activity, but epidemics predictably occur every 4 to 8 years. Although it is primarily an infection of young adults, it can attack the elderly. The most common clinical syndrome is tracheobronchitis, with one third of patients developing a mild but persistent pneumonia. Mycoplasma pneumonia is rarely biopsied, because positive cold agglutinin and specific complement fixation antigen assays establish the diagnosis. Biopsied cases show lymphocytic or neutrophilic bronchiolitis with alveolar wall inflammation and fibrin- interstitial and intra-alveolar fibrin exudates ( Fig. 7-27 ). The diagnosis is usually established serologically by EBV antigen titers but can be confirmed by in situ hybridization.\n\nFor years, the organism formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii was thought to be a protozoon; however, it is now confidently classified as a fungus. Originally described as causing a plasmacell interstitial pneumonia in malnourished children, it was subsequently seen in patients with hematologic malignancies and in those receiving chemotherapy or chronic corticosteroid therapy.\n\nIn the 1980s, Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) became a signal infection in establishing the diagnosis of AIDS. It was encountered in epidemic proportions, until prophylactic use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim) became a routine aspect of HIV/AIDS management. P. jiroveci is currently most often diagnosed by sputum induction, and lung biopsy is reserved for diagnostic challenges. 32 Although the disease manifests radiographically as an atypical interstitial pneumonia, interstitial inflammation is not its most striking pathologic feature. In PCP, the alveoli are filled with a A B Cryptococcus. In such cases, specific immunohistochemistry can confirm the diagnosis. Multiple patterns of unusual host reactions to P. jiroveci have been recognized. 34 These include DAD ( Fig. 7-29A ), solitary necrotizing granulomas (see Fig. 7 -29B), miliary infection, lymphoid interstitial pneumonia, and regional lymphadenitis. Microcalcifications may be seen in areas of infection, and thinwalled cyst formation may develop.\n\nBronchiectasis is one of the major manifestations of pulmonary infection. Dilatation and anatomic distortion of conducting A B frothy eosinophilic exudate that mimics exudative pulmonary edema or alveolar lipoproteinosis ( Fig. 7-28A ). The pulmonary interstitium shows a mild, plasma cell-rich pneumonitis and prominent alveolar type II cell hyperplasia. The diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of oval, helmetor crescenteric-shaped GMS-positive \"cysts,\" 4 to 6 \u00b5m in greatest dimension, within the alveolar froth (see Fig. 7 -28B). 33 Pneumocysts are distinguished from GMS-positive fungal yeast forms by the absence of budding, pericapsular accentuation, and a so-called intracytoplasmic dot in the former. However, when these features are absent and the organism load in the biopsy is low, it may be difficult to confidently exclude Histoplasma or ria, as well some viruses, including herpesvirus and adenovirus, elicit primarily an exudation of neutrophils, whereas the cellular response to other viruses, fungi, mycoplasma, and chlamydia are primarily lymphohistiocytic. Bronchopneumonia generally results from microaspiration of pathogens that have colonized the oropharynx ( Fig. 7-33A ). At times, the aspiration of colonized food particles can carry bacteria and fungi into the lung (see Fig. 7 -33B). Terminal episodes of aspiration often show colonies of gram-positive aerococci, previously referred to as the genus Gaffkya (see Fig. 7 -33C), and their appearance is both common and characteristic in lung specimens obtained at autopsy. 38\n\nThe pyogenic bacteria are distinguished by their propensity to evoke acute neutrophilic inflammation and pus. Pyogenic infections and other acute necrotizing bronchopneumonias progress to organizing pneumonia, which is characterized by a fibrohistiocytic response that obliterates small airways along with inflammation of the surrounding alveolar interstitium (Fig. 7-34 ). This reaction is nonspecific, and \"organizing pneumonia\" or \"bronchiolitis-obliterans-organizing pneumonia\" is a rubric for the generic lesion that may result from infection, noninfective inflammatory disorders, or idiopathic causes. 39 It is important for the surgical pathologist to convey clearly to the treating clinicians that a diagnosis of \"organizing pneumonia\" does not indicate a specific etiology. airways can result from acute and chronic airway injury due to airway infection (wet bronchiectasis) or adjacent parenchymal scarring (dry or traction bronchiectasis). A number of infections can damage the large airways and lead to bronchiectasis. Reversible cylindrical bronchiectasis may appear radiographically after an acute bacterial pneumonia. Because this change often resolves, biopsies of suspicious bronchiectatic regions should be deferred until a period of weeks has elapsed after an acute infection. Because regions of chronic bronchiectasis are fed by varicose bronchial arteries that often course directly beneath the airways surface, endoscopic biopsies of bronchiectatic areas are generally contraindicated.\n\nBefore the development of childhood vaccination, viral exanthems and Bordetella pertussis were common causes of bronchiectasis ( Fig. 7-30 ). Cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder of chloride transport, is currently a leading cause of severe bronchiectasis in young adults, as advances in management have resulted in survival of these patients beyond childhood ( Fig. 7-31 ).\n\nIn bronchiectasis, the airways lose their cartilaginous support due to chronic inflammation, and they become dilated and prone to repeated bouts of mucoid impaction and infection. 35 The airways develop a spectrum of gross changes ranging from cystic, to varicose, to cylindrical dilatation, associated with distal peribronchiolar inflammation ( Fig. 7 -32A) and increasing degrees of parenchymal scarring with loss of gas-exchanging alveoli (see Fig.  7 -32B). Although the large airways are invariably ectatic, the distal airways in bronchiectasis are generally narrowed by constrictive bronchiolitis.\n\nRecurrent polymicrobial infections with necrotizing bronchopneumonia and abscess formation complicate bronchiectasis. Patients are also prone to develop infections due to antibioticresistant mucoid forms of Pseudomonas, Burkholderia spp., Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Achromobacter xylosoxidans (see Fig.  7 -32C), or Staphylococcal spp. 36 Some patients with infective bronchiectasis develop allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) and superinfection with atypical mycobacteria. 37 Acute Bronchopneumonia Acute bronchopneumonia is the most common distribution of pulmonary infection. Gram-positive and gram-negative bacte- infected exudate, known as the gray hepatization (see Fig.  7 -35C). Despite the extensive inflammatory changes, alveolar necrosis is absent (a finding best assessed by elastic stains), and the lung heals by resolution with minimal sequelae. The offending organisms are gram-positive, lancet-shaped cocci growing in pairs (diplococci) and in short chains, and they can be identified by tissue Gram stain and GMS stains (see Fig. 7 -35D).\n\nGroup A streptococcal pneumonia occurs at the extremes of life or as a complication of resolving influenza infection. 41 It produces a rapidly progressing and life-threatening pneumonia with edema, hemorrhage, abscess formation, empyema, and septicemia. Group A streptococci evoke a brisk increase in pulmonary capillary permeability, yielding what can be mistaken for cardiogenic pulmonary edema on low-power microscopic examination ( Fig. 7-36A ). Further scrutiny reveals necrotic macrophages and innumerable gram-positive bacteria in chains (see Fig. 7 -36B). Pulmonary hemorrhage and abscess formation are frequently seen. Streptococci have a predilection to course along pulmonary\n\nStreptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia (pneumococcal pneumonia) is a community-acquired pneumonia that classically produces a lobar pneumonia that heals by resolution (i.e., without necrosis or scarring). 40 In some cases, pneumococcal pneumonia complicates a resolving viral tracheobronchitis or influenza. In the age of antibiotic treatment, most cases do not progress to lobar involvement and are limited to acute, non-necrotizing bronchopneumonia. A large number of serotypes of S. pneumoniae have been isolated, and certain ones (e.g., type 3), can be virulent, producing necrotizing pneumonia, bacteremia, and death, despite prompt antibiotic treatment.\n\nAlthough it is rarely biopsied, lobar pneumococcal pneumonia is still seen at autopsy. The early phase of the disease, known as the red hepatization, shows exudation of edema fluid with the diapedesis of red blood cells ( Fig. 7-35A ). The exudate spreads to fill an entire lung lobe via the pores of Kohn, interalveolar potential channels within the normal lung (see Fig. 7 -35B). The acute cellular response is neutrophilic, but this is followed within days by filling of the alveoli with macrophages that ingest the lymphatic channels, recapitulating erysipeloid spread in the skin, to produce an early empyema ( Fig. 7-37 ).\n\nStaphylococcus aureus has emerged as a frequently encountered, life-threatening pulmonary pathogen. Previously seen as a community-acquired complication of influenza, staphylococcal infection is now a primary cause of nosocomial pneumonia, and its evolving drug resistance accounts for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains that are of particular concern for hospital infection control epidemiologists. 42 S. aureus produces a necrotizing pyogenic pneumonia with abscess formation (Fig. 7-38A ). The organisms grow in clusters as gram-positive microcolonies (see Fig. 7 -38B). Infection heals by organization with scarring, and cystic pneumatoceles may develop. Some phage-infected strains of the organism produce an exotoxin that can activate the CD3 receptor to promote the release of the T lymphocyte's complement of lymphokines, leading to a toxic-shock syndrome with sepsis physiology, DAD, and disseminated intravascular coagulation that is fatal if not treated promptly.\n\nMost gram-negative bacilli produce a necrotizing bronchopneumonia with hemorrhage and abscess formation. Certain virulent gram-negative species, including Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, and Burkholderia spp., have a propensity to infect the pulmonary microvasculature, leading to necrosis, bacteremia, and septic shock. 43 The lung shows fibrinoid necrosis with colonies of gram-negative bacilli streaming along the vessel walls, where they create an ill-defined purplish hue in H&E-stained sections ( Fig. 7-39A , B).\n\nKlebsiella pneumonia typically occurs in patients who are immunocompromised due to age, ethanol abuse, or diabetes mellitus. \n\nLung abscess complicates the aspiration of polymicrobial oropharyngeal bacteria. The organisms isolated from a lung abscess include mixed gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic flora as well as anaerobes. Patients with poor oral hygiene due to dental caries, those with gingival or tonsillar disease, and those with disorders that impair consciousness or interfere with normal swallowing (e.g., ethanolism, seizure disorder, cerebrovascular accident) are at increased risk for aspiration pneumonia and\n\nIt is a common ventilator-associated pneumonia. 44 Like the pneumococcus, Klebsiella spp. classically produce a lobar pneumonia with a slimy \"mucoid\" appearance and an unexplained predilection for the upper lobes ( Fig. 7-40A ). Infection produces hemorrhagic necrosis, microabscesses, and cavity formation. The organisms are short, gram-negative bacilli that can be demonstrated with both tissue Gram stain (see Fig. 7 -40B) and GMS by virtue of their capsules. Less commonly, Klebsiella spp. produce a chronic necrotizing pneumonia with scarring and distortion of the pulmonary anatomy (see Fig. 7 -40C).\n\nA B C C granules ( Fig. 7 -43A)-bright yellow specks seen with the naked eye or with the aid of a hand lens that microscopically represent colonies of tangled gram-positive, GMS-positive, beaded filamentous bacilli (see Fig. 7 -43B, C) coated by an eosinophilic matrix of exudate plasma proteins termed the Splendore-Hoeppli reaction. Treatment includes long-term antibiotic therapy and surgical resection. The differential diagnosis of sulfur granules in the lung includes botryomycosis, a term used to describe a variety of infections by colonies of gram-positive cocci, either Streptococcus or Staphylococcus, that grossly appear comparable to the sulfur granules caused by Actinomyces. 47 Distinguishing these entities depends on the morphology of the bacteria in the granules (i.e., cocci in botryomycosis versus filamentous bacteria in actinomycosis) (Fig. 7-44 ).\n\nNocardia produces pneumonia primarily in the immunosuppressed host. 48 The organism shares morphologic and histochemical staining features with Actinomyces, but its clinical and lung abscess. 45 The disorder begins as a necrotizing bronchopneumonia in a dependent segment of the lung and progresses to produce a cavitary abscess communicating with a feeding adjacent airway. Most lung abscesses are diagnosed and treated noninvasively; however, poor drainage and closure may lead to failure to respond to medical treatment, prompting surgical excision.\n\nMicroscopically, the wall of the lung abscess is irregular, with a shaggy fibrinous lining ( Fig. 7-41A ) that can be difficult to distinguish from a necrobiotic rheumatoid nodule or Wegener granulomatosis. However, palisading granulomatous inflammation is not a prominent finding in lung abscess. The area around the cavity shows acute and organizing bronchopneumonia (see Fig. 7 -41B). The activity of a lung abscess may be determined microscopically by examining its lining: actively infected cavities show a squamous epithelium which indicates complete healing and may be mistaken for a region of primary bronchiectasis.\n\nActinomyces spp. are gram-positive, filamentous bacteria that cause a chronic distal necrotizing pneumonia with a proclivity for penetration into the adjacent soft tissues of the chest wall. 46 Actinomyces spp. are aspirated from the oropharynx, where they are commonly part of the tonsillar flora in younger patients or a pathogen related to poor oral hygiene and gingivitis in the elderly. The risk factors for actinomycosis are similar to those for lung abscess. The infection extends into the pleura and then forms sinuses within the soft tissues of the chest wall that ultimately exit at the skin surface. The indurated pulmonary lesion may be mistaken clinically for an aggressive peripheral lung malignancy, but its gross appearance at surgery is usually distinct (Fig. 7-42) .\n\nThe histologic response evoked by actinomycosis is variegate, with microabscesses, polymorphous infiltrates of lymphocytes, histiocytes, plasma cells, giant cells, and fibrosis. At times, the extent of the fibroinflammatory response can lead one to consider a diagnosis of \"inflammatory pseudotumor.\" The correct diagnosis is established by the presence of so-called sulfur A B histologic responses are usually easily distinguished. Nocardia produces a necrotizing pneumonia with granulohistiocytic inflammation (Fig. 7-45A) , and special stains highlight tangles of gram-positive, GMS-positive filamentous organisms that show less beading than Actinomyces (see Fig. 7 -45B). Sulfur granules are rarely seen in pulmonary infections. As distinct from Actinomyces, Nocardia spp. are weakly acid-fast and can be highlighted with modified Ziehl-Neelsen stains (e.g., Fite-Ferraco) (see Fig.  7 -45C). Nocardiosis is a recognized complication of pulmonary alveolar lipoproteinosis and has recently been observed in patients receiving therapies that interfere with the activities of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1.\n\nLegionella spp. produce pulmonary infections ranging in severity from a mild respiratory illness to life-threatening pneumonia. Patients may suffer from a modest degree of immunosuppression due to diabetes or ethanolism. The organism can be inhaled from contaminated water and air-conditioning sources, and these have led to point outbreaks of infection. The diagnosis of Legionella infection is currently established noninvasively by immunoassays; however, the disease may be identified histologically in biopsy or autopsy tissues. The infected lung characteristically shows a fibrinohistiocytic response with alveolar filling by fibrin and necrotic macrophages with a sparse neutrophilic component, (Fig. 7-46A ), although its histology may also be indistinguishable from that of pyogenic infections. 49 It can be mimicked by acute fibrinous organizing pneumonia (AFOP), a recently recognized noninfective pattern of pulmonary injury (see Fig. 7 -46B). Although Legionella is a gramnegative coccobacillus, it stains weakly with Gram stains, and silver impregnation stains are required to blacken the organisms, which are often abundant in situ in the absence of prior treatment ( Fig. 7-47A) . Legionella micdadei is distinguished by its staining with modified Ziehl-Neelsen stains (see Fig. 7-47B) . infiltrates, pleural effusions, or pulmonary hypertension. 52 The characteristic change in the disorder is the accumulation of foamy macrophages that show intense staining with PAS ( Fig. 7-51 ). In some cases, microgranulomas that are histologically comparable to those seen in sarcoidosis may confuse the diagnosis (Fig. 7-52) , and the PAS staining in these granulomas may be equivocal as well. It is uncertain whether sarcoidosis is associated with Whipple disease or whether the sarcoidal granulomas are evidence of early infection. In these cases, a small-bowel biopsy usually establishes the diagnosis. Further confirmation can be achieved by ultrastructural examination demonstrating the bacillary organisms ( Fig. 7-53 ) or by specific PCR.\n\nPathologists apply the term granuloma to a variety of histologic responses, including micronodular collections of tightly knit epithelioid macrophages (tuberculoid granulomas), necrotizing histiocytic reactions (necrotizing granuloma), and diffuse polymorphic infiltrates composed of lymphocytes, histiocytes, and plasma cells (granulomatous inflammation). The organisms that evoke these cellular responses are limited and include the actinomycetes, mycobacteria, fungi, and helminths.\n\nPulmonary necrotizing granulomatous inflammation is most commonly caused by mycobacterial or fungal infection. Tuberculosis is caused by a gram-positive soil actinomycete. The disease was recognized in antiquity, and it continues to represent a major source of global morbidity and mortality, largely because of its recrudescence in the settings of poverty and HIV/AIDS. 53 The term tuberculosis is properly limited to infections caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis and its genetically related congeners (e.g., Mycobacterium bovis) and is not the appropriate appellation for infections caused by nontuberculous or atypical mycobacteria. M. tuberculosis can affect the pulmonary airways, parenchyma, or pleura. Inhaled mycobacteria proliferate in the alveolar spaces and are then transported via lymphatics to regional A B \n\nRhodococcus pneumonia is a zoonotic infection that causes a nodular histiocytic and cavitary pneumonia in immunosuppressed patients, most commonly in patients with HIV/AIDS ( Fig. 7-48) . 50 The causative gram-positive cocci are easily identified ( Fig. 7-49A ) and also stain positive with the modified Ziehl-Neelsen stain (see Fig. 7-49B ). The inflammatory response shows malakoplakia (Fig. 7-50A) with formation of intracellular calcific concretions termed Michaelis-Gutman bodies that, although nonspecific, are characteristically seen in the infection and can be highlighted by both PAS and iron stains (see Fig.  7 -50B). 51\n\nWhipple disease is a rare disorder caused by the actinomycete Tropheryma whippelii. It most commonly causes intestinal malabsorption, but pulmonary and neurologic disease also occurs. In the lung, Whipple disease can manifest as interstitial hilar lymph nodes, from which they can enter the systemic circulation to spread to other organs. Progression of infection is limited by the acquisition of effective cell-mediated immunity. 54 The initial pulmonary focus of infection (Ghon focus) heals by fibrosis and may show dystrophic calcification. This Ghon focus and the accompanying calcified site of infection in a hilar lymph node are termed the Ranke complex ( Fig. 7-54 tologic correlate is destruction of lung tissue (Fig. 7-56) with loss of the underlying reticulin stroma. But the latter finding is not apparent in H&E-stained sections, so it is best, in practice, to refer to tuberculous lesions as either \"necrotizing\" or \"nonnecrotizing\" and to avoid the terms \"caseating\" and \"noncaseating.\" Because the response to mycobacterial infection reflects a component of immune hypersensitivity, even small numbers of organisms can evoke substantial lung injury, and this complicates the task of identifying mycobacteria in situ. The organisms are best identified by their red color in AFB-stained sections (i.e., Ziehl-Neelsen stain or one of its modifications, such as Fite-Ferraco stain). Mycobacteria can show substantial morphologic variability. They are curvilinear, vary in length, and exhibit a characteristic beaded appearance attributable to nonhomogeneous uptake of the AFB stain (Fig. 7-57A) .\n\nHowever, there is no reliable way to distinguish M. tuberculosis from atypical mycobacteria by histochemical staining. Because mycobacteria are weakly gram positive, they can also be demonstrated in GMS-stained sections, a finding that is nonspecific but can at times aid in identification of the inconspicuous bacilli (see Fig. 7-57B) . Nonmycobacterial organisms can also be 7-55). The presence of tuberculoid granulomas can be a distinguishing clue in differentiating tuberculosis from other forms of necrotizing granulomatous inflammation (e.g., Wegener granulomatosis), in which tuberculoid granulomas are infrequent.\n\nThe term caseous necrosis properly refers to the \"cheesy\" appearance of the necrotic lesion on gross inspection. The his- atic, the only evidence of previous limited infection being a positive tuberculin skin test. However, small numbers of mycobacteria can remain potentially viable, and active infection may ensue if cell-mediated immunity is diminished by age, use of corticosteroids, diabetes, ethanolism, or chronic infection. There is a marked increase in tuberculosis among patients with pulmonary silicosis, and establishing the presence of mycobacterial infection in a patient with progressive massive fibrosis due to silicosis can be difficult.\n\nAs previously noted, histologic examination can provide an estimation of the adequacy of host immunity. The morphology of giant cells may be an indicator of whether host cell-mediated immunity is adequate in containing tuberculous infection. Before the development of effective cell-mediated immunity, many giant cells in the lesions show nuclei that have aggregated toward one pole of the multikaryon (Fig. 7-58A) ; after infection is effectively contained, Langhans giant cells with peripheral nuclei or giant cells with centrally placed nuclei predominate (see Fig. 7-58B ). If cell-mediated immunity is profoundly diminished, granulomas may be poorly formed or absent.\n\nFailure to contain the primary infection leads to its progression. Primary tuberculosis may show necrotizing pneumonia (Fig. 7-59) , regionally involved lymph nodes, and a granulomatous pleuritis with lymphocytic effusion. Dissemination of organ-AFB positive, so differential staining and culture results may be required to establish an accurate diagnosis (Table 7-5) .\n\nIn practice, the identification of M. tuberculosis by Ziehl-Neelsen staining is relatively insensitive, identifying mycobacteria in roughly 60% of culture-positive cases, so the diagnosis may depend on isolating organisms in culture. In one study of more than 300 biopsy specimens, mycobacteria were cultured from the specimens that contained necrotizing granulomas (38.2%), nonnecrotizing granulomas (32.4%), poorly formed granulomas (30.0%), or acute inflammation (15.8%). Tissues with fibrotic or hyalinized granulomas, nonspecific chronic inflammation, nonspecific reactive or reparative changes, no significant histologic abnormality, or malignancy failed to yield positive cultures. This study concluded that biopsy specimens with the latter diagnoses were inappropriate samples for either mycobacterial culture and histochemical staining.\n\nMycobacteria grow slowly in culture, and it can take weeks before they are eventually isolated. Consequently, ancillary methods have been developed with the aim of increasing the likelihood of establishing a diagnosis in a timely fashion. Sensitive fluorescent staining techniques, including the auramine-rhodamine stain, are used routinely in some laboratories to examine smears and tissues. PCR methods have been developed that can identify M. tuberculosis and distinguish this organism from atypical mycobacteria in fresh tissues and in paraffin-embedded sections.\n\nTuberculosis has protean manifestations in the lung (Table 7-6) . After most exposures, the primary infection is limited by the host's cellular immune system, and the host remains asymptom-A B Figure 7 -57. A, Mycobacterial tuberculosis, the \"red snapper,\" is a short, beaded bacillus that can be equally well demonstrated with the Ziehl-Neelsen stain or its weakly acid-fast modifications (\u00d7600). B, Mycobacteria are apparent in GMS-stained sections, but this finding is less specific than with AFB staining (\u00d71000). Mycobacteria can spread along the mucosal surfaces of the airways to produce ulcerated lesions in the larynx and tracheobronchial tree that can mimic Wegener granulomatosis (Fig.  7-64) . However, as previously noted, the latter disorder rarely includes well-formed tuberculoid granulomas, and their presence favors the diagnosis of infection.\n\nMost clinically encountered cases of tuberculosis occurring previously asymptomatic individuals with positive cutaneous responses to purified protein derivative (PPD) represent either reactivation or reinfection. Reactivation indicates an acquired defect in cellmediated immunity. Tuberculosis tends to reactivate in the upper lobes of the lung, where ventilation/perfusion ratios are high. Histologically, the lung shows necrotizing granulomas in areas of scarring and traction bronchiectasis (Fig. 7-65 ) resulting from the initial mycobacterial infection. In addition to reactivation of tuberculosis, the differential diagnosis of necrotizing granulomatous inflammation in this setting includes fungal infection and atypical mycobacterial infection, because both have a predilection to develop in areas of old pulmonary apical scarring. The distinction may be difficult in the case of atypical mycobacterial infection, because special stains cannot distinguish these possibilities, and culture or ancillary diagnostic tests are necessary (Fig. 7-66) .\n\nA number of mycobacteria that are genetically distinct from M. tuberculosis can produce pulmonary infection. 57 These organisms vary in virulence, and this fact is often reflected in the histologic appearance of the infection (Table 7-7) . Mycobacterium-avium intracellulare, also called Mycobacterium-avium complex (MAC), can attack the lung in a variety of clinical settings. 58 Patients immunosuppressed by HIV/AIDS can develop virulent infections with features that mimic tuberculosis. If adaptive T cell-mediated immunity is severely compromised, the host response may be limited to foamy histiocytes that have ingested large numbers of mycobacteria. 59 MAC can be demon-isms via the bloodstream can yield miliary disease, in which innumerable foci of active infection with poorly formed granulomas are seen (Fig. 7-60) . 55 Tuberculous acinar-nodose bronchopneumonia results from mycobacterial infection that extends along the pulmonary acinus ( Fig. 7-61) . Tuberculomas are defined foci of nodular tuberculous infection (Fig. 7-62 ). Cavitation of a tuberculoma into an adjacent bronchus can lead to the discharge of numerous bacilli with cough or expectoration (Fig. 7-63A ). Although bacillary counts in cavitary lesions are typically high, even large cavities at times fail to show a single identifiable organism by histochemical staining, and the diagnosis must be made presumptively based on histologic appearance and empiric response to anti-tuberculosis medications. 56 The extension of cavitary disease to involve an accompanying pulmonary artery may produce a Rasmussen aneurysm and risk of vascular rupture leading to fatal hemoptysis (see Fig. 7-63B) . atelectasis. The lesions of MAC infection are detected radiographically as \"tree-in-bud\" opacities, reflecting terminal bronchiolar infection (Fig. 7-67A) , together with nodules that may be solid or cavitary. Histologically, the pathology often shows extensive areas of non-necrotizing epithelioid histiocytes and is highly characteristic (see Fig. 7-67B) . The causative mycobacteria are indistinguishable from M. tuberculosis, and only culture or PCR can accurately establish the diagnosis. A recently described variant of MAC infection is known as \"hot tub lung.\" The lung shows a microgranulomatous hypersensitivity pneumonitis that may be accompanied by necrotizing granulomatous inflammation. The pathology appears to represent primarily a cell-mediated hypersensitivity response to mycobacterial antigens, with a possible element of direct infection as well (Fig. 7-68 ).\n\nAn unusual presentation of MAC infection in the immunosuppressed host is the pseudosarcomatous nodule. 60 This can strated by both AFB and PAS stains, and clinical signs of either tuberculosis or MAC disease may be recognized only after treatment with antivirals-the so-called immune reconstitution syndrome.\n\nIn the immunocompetent host, MAC tends to affect elderly women (Lady Windermere disease) and patients with bronchiectasis or bullous emphysema. It is commonly seen in the rightmiddle lobe syndrome caused by bronchiectasis and chronic develop in the lung or in soft tissues and hematopoietic tissues. The nodules are composed of spindle cells and may be mistaken for a low-grade spindle-cell neoplasm (Fig. 7-69A) . However, examination reveals the foamy appearance of the spindle cells, which proves to be CD68-positive macrophages containing large numbers of ingested mycobacteria (see Fig. 7-69B) , and the absence of mitotic activity. Within the spectrum of unusual mesenchymal reactions seen in the immunocompromised, one must consider inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors that may include foamy histiocytes (Fig. 7-70A ) associated with Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) infection (see Fig. 7-70B ).\n\nOther mycobacteria also cause pulmonary infection. Mycobacterium kansasii is a virulent species of atypical mycobacteria that produces necrotizing infection indistinguishable from tuberculosis. The organism often shows a prominent pattern of \"crosslinking\" on mycobacterial stains in situ that is characteristic but not diagnostic (Fig. 7-71 ). Other rapidly growing mycobacteria, including Mycobacterium abscessus, infect preexisting areas of active bronchiectasis, particularly in cystic fibrosis ( Fig. 7-72) . Mycobacterium fortuitum produces limited infection in patients with diabetes, HIV/AIDS, or chronic upper gastrointestinal disease; and all of the rapid growing nontuberculous mycobacteria, including Mycobacterium smegmatis, can complicate pneumonia caused by aspiration of lipid-based substances such as nose drops. 61\n\nRarely seen outside of Southeast Asia where it is endemic, chronic infections due to Pseudomonas pseudomallei developed in veterans of the Vietnam War many years after they had left the region. 62 Acute melioidosis is a systemic infection that produces widespread coalescent microabscesses; it may resolve without being recognized, only to recur many years later in lung, lymph nodes, and bone. The lung shows necrotizing granulomatous lesions surrounded by a zone of fibrosis ( Fig. 7-73 ), and regional lymph nodes show stellate necrosis that can mimic that of socalled cat-scratch disease (Bartonella henselae). The offending organism is a gram-negative, motile bacillus that shows bipolar staining that can be difficult to demonstrate in situ.\n\nFungi produce a spectrum of changes in the lung, ranging from benign colonization of airways to malignant angioinvasive infections. Some fungi grow as yeast at body temperatures, whereas others are hyphate molds (Table 7-8) . Most fungal yeasts are soil organisms that are topographically distributed in the United States. Whereas Histoplasma capsulatum may be encountered virtually anywhere that soil and water coexist, most cases in this country are endemic to the Mississippi and Ohio River valleys. Blastomyces dermatitidis predominantly affects individuals living in the Great Lakes region and in the southeastern United States, whereas Coccidioides immitis is primarily encountered in the San Joaquin Necrotizing granulomas caused by Histoplasma spp. show central necrosis often surrounded by regions of mummefactive necrosis in which the \"ghost outlines\" of the underlying framework of the lung can still be distinguished in H&E-and reticulin-stained sections (Fig. 7-74A, B) . The lining of the necrotic granuloma includes epithelioid histiocytes and giant cells, but, unlike tuberculosis, does not show extensive tubercle granuloma formation, and the wall of the lesion characteristically exhibits paucicellular hyalinized fibrosis (Fig. 7-75) .\n\nAlthough they are facultative intracellular pathogens, Histoplasma spp. cluster in areas of necrosis and are often seen outside of histiocytes. 65 The 2-to 4-\u00b5m yeast forms are teardrop-shaped and reproduce by single narrow-neck buds whose presence is diagnostic. Despite their name, no capsule is present (Fig.  7-76A) . At times, pseudohyphae may be seen, and this should not dissuade the pathologist from making the correct diagnosis (see Fig. 7 -76B) if all other diagnostic criteria are met. The differential diagnosis includes microforms of Cryptococcus or Blastomyces, P. jiroveci, and Candida glabrata. The presence of larger yeast forms eliminates the possibility of H. capsulatum\n\nValley of the Southwest. But despite their usual distribution, modern air travel and a highly mobile population have resulted in the possibility of encountering these infections almost anywhere, and pathologists must be acquainted with their characteristic histologic appearances. However, it is always prudent to inquire into possible travel before diagnosing an exotic fungal infection, because substantial overlap can exist in fungal morphologies.\n\nPrimary Histoplasma infection produces a viral-like illness that typically resolves spontaneously. 63 However, if there is a defect in cell-mediated immunity, or if the yeast burden is large, progression of infection may ensue. 64 Chronic histoplasmosis tends to develop in the lung apices in areas of bullous emphysema or bronchiectasis. Although most yeasts can be identified in H&Estained sections, Histoplasma spp. require special histochemical staining due to their small size. GMS is the stain of choice, because PAS at times fails to decorate the yeast. Pseudomonas pseudomallei, the cause of melioidosis, may reactivate many years after initial exposure to produce a necrotizing granulomatous pneumonia that resembles tuberculosis (\u00d7200).\n\nfications is a clue to their actual nature, but ultrastructural examination may be required to exclude infection. In the immunosuppressed host, disseminated infection is primarily distributed within interstitial and alveolar macrophages (Fig. 7-79 ). 66 Extension of infection from a peribronchial lymph node can produce mediastinal granuloma, a lesion characterized by dense, whorled hyaline fibrosis with aggregates of plasma cells (Fig.  7-80A) . Organisms are rarely identified in the areas of paucicellular scarring, and this form of the disease appears to be immunologically mediated. At times, necrotizing granulomatous inflammation is concomitantly present and confirms the diagnosis (see Fig. 7-80B) . The lesion can entrap the large vessels of the mediastinum, leading to the superior vena caval syndrome and death. Surgical excision is required but may not always be technically possible.\n\nRemotely infected, calcified peribronchial lymph nodes caused by histoplasmosis can erode into adjacent airways to be infection. P. jiroveci shows irregularly shaped cysts with pericapsular accentuation on GMS stain, and the organisms do not bud; C. glabrata can closely mimic the infection in GMS-stained sections, but, unlike Histoplasma, they also stain amphophilic with H&E and are strongly gram positive (Fig. 7-77A, B) . However, the most common and greatest difficulties in diagnosis arise in distinguishing small, regular microcalcifications in GMS-stained sections, because they can closely resemble degenerate yeast (Fig. 7-78) . The presence of irregular calci-A B either expectorated or aspirated as broncholiths. Surprisingly, these may show persistently viable yeast forms and colonization by aspirated oropharyngeal bacteria (Fig. 7-81) . Old, calcified granulomas are commonly encountered in surgical resection of lungs for neoplasia. 67 Most of these are the result of healed tuberculosis or histoplasmosis, depending on exposure. In most cases, no organism is identified, but occasionally nonviable degenerate Histoplasma organisms may be seen, although distinguishing them with confidence from microcalcifications can be difficult, and a high threshold of suspicion for the diagnosis of histoplasmosis should be maintained in this setting.\n\nB. dermatitidis shows a propensity to infect lung, skin, and bone. 68 The spectrum of pulmonary presentations includes consolidative pneumonia, DAD, and pulmonary nodules that radiographically may mimic pulmonary carcinoma (Fig. 7-82) . The The organism shows substantial variability in size (2-15 \u00b5m) and in shape (Fig. 7-85A) , and innumerable microforms can occasionally be seen that must be distinguished from histoplasmosis (see Fig. 7-85B) . The yeast proliferate via single narrownecked buds; they secrete a capsule that is optimally visualized with mucicarmine in situ (Fig. 7-86A ). With GMS, the yeast body stains gray-black, and the capsule is not decorated (see Fig.  7 -86C). In capsule-deficient organisms, the Fontana-Masson stain reacts with a melanin precursor in the yeast wall, highlighting the organisms (Fig. 7-87A) , although a careful examination of the mucicarmine stain invariably reveals a poorly developed rim of capsular staining (see Fig. 7 -87B). 72\n\nGenerally affecting patients from the southwestern United States, C. immitis is distinct from other yeast by virtue of its size (20-200 \u00b5m) and its endosporulating mode of reproduction. 73 C. immitis produces a spectrum of changes that includes fibrocaseous granulomas (Fig. 7-88) , granulomatous pneumonia, and miliary disease, often accompanied by tissue eosinophilia. The endospores are contained within a spherular capsule, and both pulmonary lesion characteristically shows a granulohistiocytic response (Fig. 7-83A ). The yeast are large (15-30 \u00b5m) and are easily identified in H&E-stained sections, where they are distinguished by their thick, refractile cell wall (see Fig. 7-83B) . The organism is also multinucleate (see Fig. 7 -83C) and proliferates via single broad-based budding (see Fig. 7-83D ). Microforms may be present and should not be confused with coinfection by H. capsulatum. 69 Giant yeast forms can also occur and may be confused with C. immitis. 70\n\nCryptococcus neoformans infects immunocompromised patients but can also be seen in apparently normal hosts. 71 Meningoencephalitis is the most common clinical presentation, and it represents a complication of subclinical pulmonary infection. C. neoformans can produce localized necrotizing cryptococcomas (Fig. 7-84A) , confluent bronchopneumonia (see Fig. 7 -84B), granulomatous pneumonia (see Fig. 7-84D) , or a null response characterized by \"yeast lakes\" with minimal inflammation (see Fig. 7-84E) . Grossly, the infected lesions are glistening and \"slimy.\" stain well with GMS ( Fig. 7-89A ), whereas spherules are variably stained by PAS. The cysts of C. immitis have a characteristic tendency to collapse after having discharged their endospores in situ (see Fig. 7 -89B). In endemic areas, C. immitis can form fungus balls within preexisting pulmonary cavities (Fig. 7-90A) . The organism is dimorphic, and the presence of the infective hyphal arthroconidia should not be confused with a concomitant mold infection (see Fig. 7 -90B). 74\n\nParacoccidioides brasiliensis infection is endemic in South America, where it produces a range of pulmonary findings comparable to those of blastomycosis; but cases are rare in the United States. The organism is large (10-60 \u00b5m) and replicates by multiple narrow-necked buds which produce a \"ship's wheel\" appearance that is pathognomonic (Fig. 7-91 ). 75 However, if this feature is absent, the infection can be confused with other fungi.\n\nSuperficial colonization of the upper airways by Candida spp. is common in patients treated with inhaled corticosteroids and in chronically ill and diabetic patients (Fig. 7-92) . Foci of aspiration pneumonia and abscess cavities may show colonization, but deep pulmonary infection is rarely seen in the absence of fungemia ( Fig. 7-93A, B) . 76 Candida can have a pleomorphic morphology that includes yeast (blastoconidia), pseudohyphae, and true hyphae, although in some cases only yeast forms may be present. 77 The organisms can be highlighted by either GMS or PAS, and they are strongly gram positive (Fig. 7-94A ) At times, blastoconidia of Candida spp. can be large and mimic other fungal infections (see Fig.  7 -94B). C. glabrata (Torula glabrata) shows multiple, 2-to 5-\u00b5m, budding yeast that are amphophilic in H&E-stained sections; they are distinct from other Candida species, because pseudohyphae and hyphae are never present. 78\n\nHyphate fungi (\"molds\") are responsible for pulmonary disorders ranging from colonization of pulmonary airways to angioinvasive, life-threatening infections. Aspergillus spp. account for the majority of pulmonary mold infections, but other organisms, including the zygomycetes, Pseudallescheria, and Fusarium, also produce pulmonary disease.\n\nThe hyphae of Aspergillus spp. range in diameter from 2.5 to 4.5 \u00b5m and show frequent septation. Aspergillus spp. branch progressively, primarily at acute angles of approximately 45 degrees, mimicking an arborizing tree branch (Fig. 7-95A) ; when cut in cross-section, however, they may be mistaken for yeast, although the absence of budding suggests the correct diagnosis. In areas of mycelial growth, organisms become tangled, bulbous, and distorted, and it may be impossible to confirm the diagnosis with accuracy based on morphology (see Fig. 7-95B) . Paracoccidioides brasiliensis (\u00d7600) shows multiple narrow buds that resemble a ship's wheel, but this diagnostic feature is not always present. The aspergil, a ritual implement used in the Roman Catholic mass, resembles the fruiting body of Aspergillus and gives the fungus its name (Fig. 7-96) . Fruiting bodies develop from mycelia in areas of high oxygen tension, such as lung or sinus cavities, but do not develop in tissues. They are composed of a vesicle with one or two layers of phialides that produce the infective conidial spores, and the morphology of the fruiting body allows for accurate speciation in situ. In general, the specific diagnosis of \"aspergillosis\" should be avoided unless the aspergil is identified, because other fungi can be morphologically almost indistinguishable in tissue. Diagnoses are therefore optimally phrased as \"acute-angle branching hyphae consistent with aspergillus.\"\n\nImmune Disorders Due to Aspergillus Infection Aspergillus spp. give rise to a spectrum of disorders, some reflecting hypersensitivity responses to the organisms, and others as the consequence of invasive infection (Fig. 7-97) . Distinguishing among these disorders is critical for proper management.\n\nAllergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) shows a range of findings, including intractable asthma, proximal bronchiectasis, 79 and peripheral blood eosinophilia. It is not certain whether the fungus plays an opportunistic role in exacerbating an atopic response or is primary in its pathogenesis. 80 Patients develop intractable bronchospasm, with elevated serum IgE levels specific for Aspergillus spp. The pathology includes central cystic bronchiectasis with mucoid impaction (Fig. 7-98A) . The impacted mucus is viscid and forms a cast of the airways, a disorder termed plastic bronchitis. Microscopically, the mucus plugs show layers of degenerating eosinophils interspersed within the mucin (see Fig. 7-98B) , and the surrounding lung may show patchy eosinophilic pneumonia. The fragmented fungal hyphae can at times be difficult to identify (see Fig. 7-98C ), so silver stains should be applied routinely in the evaluation of allergic mucus plugs. Whereas the clinical and histologic features of this disorder are most frequently caused by hypersensitivity to Aspergillus spp., other fungi, such as Candida spp., can yield a comparable syndrome. A subset of patients with cystic fibrosis develop concomitant ABPA, and establishing the diagnosis in this setting can be difficult. 37 Bronchocentric Granulomatosis Bronchocentric granulomatosis appears to reflect an abnormal cell-mediated response to Aspergillus spp. or, less commonly, other fungi (e.g., Candida spp., and C. immitis), in which smallbirefringent crystals and cholesterol crystals. Whereas CD8-positive lymphocytes characteristically predominate in BAL fluid specimens, immunostains reveal dominance of either CD4-or CD8-positive lymphocytes in situ. In addition, other histopathologies, including nonspecific cellular interstitial pneumonitis (NSIP), organizing pneumonia, lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis (LIP), and non-necrotizing granulomatous inflammation resembling sarcoidosis, can be caused by hypersensitivity pneumonitis. The presence of interstitial and alveolar eosinophils is characteristically seen in hypersensitivity pneumonitis due to Aspergillus antigens and is less common in response to other antigens.\n\nThe presence of primary airway infection by Aspergillus spp. is a poorly recognized entity. It is usually seen in the setting of modest immunosuppression accompanying disorders such as diabetes mellitus or the use of aerosolized steroids in asthmatics. In some cases, it is a precursor lesion for invasive disease. Fungal hyphae can be seen filling the lumen of airways (Fig. 7-101A) , without evidence of frank tissue invasion. Elastic stains are helpful in determining whether organisms have begun to transgress normal tissue barriers (see Fig. 7-101B ). Centrally necrotic lesions (Fig. 7-102A ) of chronic necrotizing aspergillosis can resemble those caused by mycobacteria or other fungi (see Fig.  7-102B) .\n\ncaliber airways develop circumferential granulomatous inflammation, loss of the normal lining respiratory epithelium, and impaction of the airway lumen by granular basophilic mucin admixed with cellular debris (Fig. 7-99) . The disorder may be first noted radiographically as isolated or multiple airway-centered nodules. 81 Bronchocentric granulomatosis may be seen as part of the spectrum of findings in ABPA or as an isolated disorder. As in ABPA, fragmented hyphae may be difficult to identify, and surrounding areas of eosinophilic pneumonitis are common. If the disease is suspected clinically, it can be treated noninvasively with corticosteroids; however, definitive resection may be undertaken to exclude neoplasia.\n\nHypersensitivity pneumonitis reflects a combined abnormality of humoral and cell-mediated immunologic responses to organic antigens. Most cases are caused by thermophilic actinomycetes, but hypersensitivity to Aspergillus spp. is well documented. Upper lobe predominance is the rule, and this can be a helpful feature in establishing the diagnosis.\n\nThe diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis is based primarily on establishing an historical link between antigen exposures and the clinical findings, but lung biopsies can establish the diagnosis. Microscopically, the lung shows bronchiolocentric lymphohistiocytic interstitial infiltrates with poorly formed microgranulomas (Fig. 7-100 ) and giant cells that may contain \n\nThe colonization of old fibrocavitary disease (e.g., areas of bronchiectasis due to healed tuberculosis or sarcoidosis, emphysematous bullae) by Aspergillus is the most common cause of a pulmonary fungus ball ( Fig. 7-103A,B) . 82 The term mycetoma should not be applied to intracavitary fungal mycelial growth, because it accurately applies only to soft tissue infections. Patients may be asymptomatic, or they may present with episodes of hemoptysis, at times massive and requiring emergent bronchial arterial embolization or definitive resection. The morphology of the hyphae in a fungus ball is frequently distorted, and it can be impossible to identify the diagnostic septate, acute-angle branching forms. Aspergillus fungus balls show heterogeneous staining intensity on H&E stain (see Fig.  7 -103C), giving the impression of alternating zones of growth. The wall of the fungus ball frequently shows increased numbers of tissue eosinophils (see Fig. 7-103D) .The Splendore-Hoeppli phenomenon is often present and is reassuring evidence that angioinvasion is unlikely, unless there has been a recent super- vening cause of immunosuppression or neutropenia. The walls of the cavity are lined with granulation tissue, granulomatous inflammation, or metaplastic squamous epithelium, depending on the activity of the disease. The occasional presence of germinative fruiting bodies of Aspergillus spp. with characteristic phialides and conidial forms allows definitive speciation. One may rarely see rapid expansion of a cavity due to vascular thrombosis induced by calcium oxalate crystal deposition, a disorder termed chronic pulmonary oxalosis. 83 Oxalic acid is produced by a variety of Aspergillus spp. but is most commonly a feature of Aspergillus niger infection (Fig. 7-104A) . Diffusion of oxalate into surrounding blood vessels is prothrombotic and can lead to extensive ischemic necrosis (see Fig. 7 -104B, C). Oxalate crystal deposition in the renal tubules may also be seen. Emergency resection of the fungus ball is the only effective treatment.\n\nThis life-threatening infection is seen in patients who have been chronically immunosuppressed or neutropenic. It is a complication of bone marrow or solid organ transplantation and of antileukemic chemotherapies. Angioinvasive aspergillosis is an uncommon complication of HIV/AIDS, despite the associated profound immune deficiency. Grossly, the lung shows targetoid lesions with central thrombosed vessels secondary to angioinvasion, surrounded by a rim of consolidated lung, confluent bronchopneumonia, or lobar consolidation (Fig. 7-105A) ; microscopically, a necrotizing pneumonia (see Fig. 7-105B) , at times featuring giant cells (see Fig. 7-105C) , may be present. 84 Angioinvasion is identified microscopically and may be enhanced with silver and elastic stains (Fig. 7-106) . Rarely, foci of infarcted lung can produce an infected, nonviable pulmonary sequestrum ( Fig. 7-107) .\n\nThe fungal hyphae tend to invade blood vessels and to \"metastasize\" to other organs. The presence of sunburst vasculocentric hyphal growth is diagnostic of a metastatic focus of infection ( Fig. 7-108) , and virtually any organ can be secondarily involved. Circulating Aspergillus spp. can also seed abnormal cardiac valves to produce endocarditis, with fatal embolic hemorrhagic infarctions to brain and other vital organs.\n\nOther Aspergillus Species Aspergillus terreus is an opportunistic fungus that infects patients with chronic granulomatous disease, as well as other immunocompromised hosts. 84 branches ( Fig. 7-109 ). Fungus balls produced by Aspergillus nidulans have a propensity to produce pale-staining, enlarged fungal forms or Hulle cells, that show Maltese-cross birefringence when examined under polarized light (Fig. 7-110 ). 85\n\nAlthough the majority of acute-angle branching septate hyphae encountered in medical practice prove to be Aspergillus spp., exceptions do occur and can be difficult to distinguish in situ.\n\nOrganisms that closely mimic Aspergillus include the zygomycetes, Pseudallescheria boydii (Scedosporium), and Fusarium spp. Pulmonary infection with zygomycetes is caused by organisms of the order Mucorales, including Mucor, Rhizopus, Absidia, Rhizomucor, and Apophysomyces. 86 Infection generally occurs in immunosuppressed hosts and in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis or disorders of iron metabolism. Because treatment invariably includes surgical resection, establishing an accurate diagnosis is critical. The histologic responses to infection are comparable to those produced by angioinvasive aspergillosis. The hyphae of the zygomycetes are broad (5-25 \u00b5m), pauciseptate, and tend to branch at right angles (Fig. 7-111A) , although acute-angle branching does occur, and its presence should not dissuade one from the correct diagnosis. The hyphae of the zygomycetes are well stained by hematoxylin, and they have a proclivity to produce ribbon-like structures (see Fig. 7-111B ), but caution in diagnosis is required, because treated Aspergillus can assume this appearance as well. The fungus rapidly invades vessels, perineural lymphatics, and cartilage and tends not to respect tissue boundaries. Zygomycetes and all other hyphate fungi can rarely form noninvasive fungus balls in the lung.\n\nThe hyphae of Pseudallescheria are smaller (2-4 \u00b5m) than those of Aspergillus spp.; the fungus branches predominantly at acute angles, but, unlike Aspergillus, tends to branch haphazardly rather than progressively, and terminal chlamydospores mimicking a \"tennis racket\" may be apparent (Fig. 7-112) . Although it is a hyaline fungus, the conidia produced by Pseudallescheria in fungus balls are ovoid and pigmented. 10 Fusarium Fusarium causes an opportunistic infection of lung that is seen in patients who are severely immunosuppressed. The septate hyphae of Fusarium spp. branch irregularly and at right angles, showing constrictions at branch points ( Fig. 7-113 ). 10\n\nAlthough distinguishing hyphate fungal pathogens from one another in tissue can be exceedingly difficult, it is important, because the efficacy of available fungal antibiotics depends on the diagnosis. For example, whereas both Aspergillus spp. and Pseudallescheria are sensitive to voriconazole, Pseudallescheria are resistant to amphotericin. The sensitivity of Fusarium spp. to most antifungal antibiotics appears to be both unpredictable and limited. In all cases, culture remains the gold standard for diagnosis. Immunohistochemical reagents that can distinguish between hyphate fungi exist but are not commercially widely available, and all reagents must be carefully tested with appropriate controls. The PCR assay is presently not an effective diagnostic approach.\n\nPigmented fungi can be divided into those forming yeast (chromoblastomycosis) and those due to hyphate fungi (phaeohyphomycosis). 87 The specific organisms producing disease cannot be diagnosed morphologically, and isolation in culture is required. The Fontana-Masson stain can be applied if questions exist as to whether a fungus seen in H&E-stained sections is pigmented. Bipolaris, Curvularia, Alternaria, and other pigmented hyphate fungi cause allergic pulmonary disorders mimicking those of Aspergillus spp. (Fig. 7-114) . The correct diagnosis is suggested by the presence of pigmented hyphae within allergic mucus or within fungus balls. Chromoblastomycosis is appreciated by the presence of sclerotic (Medlar) bodies. These are clusters of pigmented yeast that show characteristic multiaxial septae ( Fig.  7-115 ).\n\nPulmonary infection due to Penicillium marneffei is rarely seen except in patients from Southeast Asia with HIV/AIDS, but it is a significant cause of necrotizing bronchopneumonia in that region. The organism is a small (2-5 \u00b5m), dimorphic fungus with an elongate sausage shape showing a characteristic septum. The organisms can be identified free within areas of necrosis or within foamy histiocytes (Fig. 7-116) . The infection may also disseminate, commonly to involve the skin. Other fungi, including Geotrichum and Sporothrix, are rare causes of pulmonary infection. 88\n\nThe lung can be host to a variety of parasitic infections. Many are seen primarily in tropical climates, but others occur in temperate climes or as a result of immunosuppression. As previously noted, the current ease of global travel has greatly increased encounters with tropical diseases.\n\nSeveral species of protozoa can produce pulmonary infection. Entamoeba histolytica affects the lung secondary to the transdiaphragmatic extension of a hepatic amebic abscess or, less commonly, as the result of bloodborne spread from an intestinal source. 89 A pulmonary amebic abscess may extend to the pleura or rupture into an airway, leading to intrapulmonic dissemination. The amebic abscess shows liquefactive necrosis that grossly resembles anchovy paste (Fig. 7-117) . The histologic response in areas of necrosis primarily includes neutrophils, but the margins of the lesion show a polymorphous infiltrate of macro- phages, lymphocytes, and plasma cells; tissue eosinophilia is uncommon (Fig. 7-118A ) Amebas can be distinguished from macrophages by their larger size, amphophilic bubbly cytoplasm, a sharply defined nuclear karyosome (see Fig. 7-118B) , and, in the case of E. histolytica, the ingestion of erythrocytes. Free-living amebas, including Acanthamoeba, Balamuthia, and Naegleria, rarely affect the lung and primarily cause meningoencephalitis. However, in immunosuppressed patients, infection may spread beyond the confines of the nervous system to include the lung.\n\nToxoplasma gondii produces pneumonia in patients who are immunosuppressed, most often with HIV/AIDS. 90 Whereas Toxoplasma is a common infection of the central nervous system and retina in HIV/AIDS, pulmonary infection is rare. When present, it includes a fibrinopurulent pneumonitis with areas of necrosis ( Fig. 7-119A ). The organisms are obligate intracellular parasites and are identified as engorged pseudocysts containing crescent-shaped tachyzoites or GMS-and PAS-positive true cysts containing bradyzoites (see Fig. 7 -119B).\n\nCryptosporidium parvum is a water-borne opportunistic infection that affects patients with HIV/AIDS but has also been seen as outbreaks among children in daycare centers. 91 The disease primarily affects the small bowel, leading to a cholera-like watery diarrhea. In patients with HIV/AIDS, the infection can spread to the hepatobiliary tree and to the pulmonary airways.\n\nThe diagnosis is made by identifying the amphophilic spores (3-5 \u00b5m) of Cryptosporidium along the surface of infected respiratory epithelium (Fig. 7-120) . Although the cysts are apparently extracellular by light microscopic determination, ultrastructural analysis demonstrates that they are actually intracytoplasmic and invested by apical cytoplasm. The underlying mucosa shows a mild lymphocytic infiltrate. Although the cysts are well seen with H&E stain, they are also stained by GMS, modified AFB, and Giemsa. The diagnosis is obvious, once considered, but can easily go unnoticed unless the differential diagnosis includes this organism.\n\nMicrosporidia are spore-forming protozoa that, like Cryptosporidium, infect immunosuppressed patients to produce a watery diarrheal illness. Extraintestinal disease, including bronchial involvement, is uncommon but has been observed. The organisms are intracytoplasmic and generally located within the apical cytoplasm. 92 Because of their small size (1-2 \u00b5m), they can be exceedingly difficult to detect, especially if the organism load is low. Special stains, including tissue Gram stain, trichrome, Warthin-Starry, and GMS, can assist in their identification ( Fig.  7-121) . Further speciation requires ultrastructural examination.\n\nSeveral nematodes (roundworms) have a larval developmental phase in the lung (Table 7-9). 93 The larvae of Ascaris, Necator, Ancylostoma, and Strongyloides migrate through the airways toward the mouth, where they are swallowed or expectorated. This process can evoke wheezing, migratory pneumonia, and blood eosinophilia, a complex termed Loeffler syndrome. The presence of track-like necrotizing granulomatous bronchitis and bronchopneumonia with prominent eosinophilic infiltrates should alert the pathologist to the presence of a migratory parasitic pulmonary infection (Fig. 7-122) . Strongyloides stercoralis is most often seen in the tropics, but is also endemic to the southeastern United States. Patients receiving high doses of corticosteroids are susceptible to infection and what is termed \"hyperinfection.\" In hyperinfection, filariform organisms exit the gut and migrate to the lungs, where they may be found in airways, alveoli, and blood vessels, and produce a hemorrhagic and eosinophilic pneumonia. If normal pathways of maturation are inhibited, the filariform larvae mature to egg-laying adults that give rise to rhabditiform larvae, and the presence of expectorated ova indicates hyperinfection (Fig.  7-123A) . Parasitemia predisposes to gram-negative sepsis that can lead to concomitant DAD (see Fig. 7-123B ).\n\nIn temperate climates, Dirofilaria immitis is a zoonosis that causes canine heartworm disease. Mosquitoes transfer microfilariae into subcutaneous tissues, where they mature silently and enter the systemic venous circulation. From there, they travel to the right side of the heart, but in humans they do not mature further. Pulmonary disease reflects embolism of a nonviable helminth from the heart into the pulmonary circulation, where it typically lodges in a small, muscular artery to produce an area of localized, rounded infarction with a chronic immunologic reaction to the dead worm. 94 The embolic event itself may be clinically silent or associated with chest pain, fever, chills, hemoptysis, and peripheral blood eosinophilia. The disease is often first recognized as a solitary pulmonary nodule that is resected to exclude neoplasia. Microscopically, one sees a rounded area of pulmonary infarction ( Fig. 7-124A ). The diagnosis is facilitated by identification of the coiled nematode within an occluded muscular pulmonary artery. The area of surrounding necrosis is enclosed by a zone of granulomatous inflammation with lymphocytes, plasma cells, and variable degrees of tissue eosinophilia, all contained within a dense fibrous capsule. Trichrome, elastic, and reticulin stains highlight the features of the helminth and help to localize it in a vessel (see Fig. 7 -124B and C). Dirofilaria are distinguished from other nematodes by their prominent, muscular lateral cords and a striated cuticle that bulges inward in the region of the lateral cords, yielding a \"bat wing\" appearance.\n\nA number of trematodes produce pulmonary disease that can manifest as solitary pulmonary nodules, pulmonary infarctions, necrotizing granulomas, or eosinophilic pneumonia. The most frequent fluke infection in the United States is schistosomiasis, which has a wide distribution in both the Eastern and Western hemispheres.\n\nPulmonary involvement reflects aberrant migration of adult worms into the lung, where they are found within pulmonary vessels (Fig. 7-125A) . The helminth evokes an intense granulomatous and eosinophilic response; extravascular refractile ova may be present and, like the helminth, can evoke granulomatous and eosinophilic reactions.\n\nThe ova are large, 70 to 170 \u00b5m, depending on the species. The ova of Schistosome mansoni, which produces most cases of pulmonary disease, show a prominent lateral spine that can be seen with H&E staining and is highlighted by modified acid-fast bacteria (AFB) stains, although the latter finding is inconstant (see Fig. 7 -125B). Other species, including Schistosoma hematobium and Schistosoma japonicum, rarely cause pulmonary disease, and their ova show, respectively, a prominent or an inconspicuous terminal spine.\n\nSchistosomiasis can also produce a granulomatous pulmonary hypertensive arteriopathy due to the presence of ova or migrating schistosomules within small-caliber pulmonary arteries and arterioles (Fig. 7-126) . 95 The thickened vascular walls show epithelioid histiocytes and giant cells with adventitial fibrosis and eosinophils. This disorder usually arises from infection by S. mansoni or, less commonly, S. japonicum, that has already produced pipestem hepatic fibrosis and presinusoidal portal hypertension, leading to shunting of portal blood into the systemic venous circulation; ova are swept into the pulmonary arterial bed, where they evoke the pathologic response.\n\nParagonimus, often referred to as lung fluke, is a globally distributed trematode, with human disease limited to endemic regions. 96 Most cases in Asia are due to Paragonimus westermani, but other species are responsible for disease in Africa and Central and South America. Zoonotic forms of human infection occur rarely in North America, secondary to Paragonimus kellicotti infections of rodents and cats. The organism is a freshwater species that infects crabs and crayfish as intermediate hosts; the disease is transmitted to humans through ingestion of these crustaceans, although cases may be seen that are caused by ingestion of contaminated seaweed or watercress. The larvae mature in the bowel and migrate through the diaphragm to infect the lung. Patients present with pulmonary infiltrates, fever, weight loss, and malaise. Hemoptysis is common. Pleural involvement is present in roughly half of the patients. Peripherally located cystic lesions develop in the lung, together with areas of pneumonic consolidation, and concomitant bacterial and mycobacterial infections may be present.\n\nGrossly, Paragonimus is a large (10 mm), reddish fluke. Its wall consists of a tegument with prominent spiny projections best seen on high-power examination of trichrome-stained sections (Fig. 7-127A ). It exhibits prominent oral and ventral suckers and a loose internal stroma. The worm evokes a cystic necrotizing granulomatous and fibrotic response with tissue eosinophilia.\n\nThe ova of Paragonimus are approximately 80 \u00b5m in size and show a flattened operculum (see Fig. 7 -127B). They are also intensely birefringent under polarized light, and this is an important factor distinguishing Paragonimus from schistosome ova (see Fig. 7-127C) .\n\nThe most common cestode pathogen in the lung is Echinococcus, although other tapeworm larvae, including cysticerci and spargana, can rarely infect the lung (Fig. 7-128) . 97 The adult tapeworm lives attached to the wall of the small intestine of carnivorous canids. Intermediate hosts are the grazing ungulates, including sheep, goats, deer, and bison. In the continental United States, the disease is endemic to midwestern and western states.\n\nPulmonary disease is generally the result of preexisting hepatic involvement by Echinococcus granulosus, although other species, including Echinococcus vogeli and Echinococcus multilocularis, are also pathogenic. 98 The appearance of the disease is characteristic on chest radiographs, which show single or mul- tiple large, fluid-filled cysts (Fig. 7-129) . These cysts can be asymptomatic, or they can cause symptoms due to compression of the surrounding airways and lung. Rupture into an airway can lead to suppurative pneumonia, with the proliferation of new cysts, and can generate a fatal anaphylactic reaction. The cyst wall shows contributions from the cestode as well as from the host. The inner germinative layer of the lamellar cyst wall is the matrix for protoscolices, which detach to form secondary brood capsules (Fig. 7-130A ). The rostellum of the attachment apparatus of the protoscolex contains rows of hooklets that are refractile and stain with modified AFB stain (see Fig. 7-130B) . The cestode component is acellular chitinous lamellar wall that is apparent with H&E stain and is further highlighted with GMS; within the cyst wall, detritus and hooklets give rise to so-called hydatid sand (Fig. 7-131 ).\n\nRecent world events have prompted interest in biologic agents that can potentially be used as weapons of mass destruction. Several of these produce pneumonia and depend on dissemination via aerosolized secretions to achieve their ignominious goal. Whereas most of these infections are naturally virulent, they tend to occur under situations that are no longer commonly encountered in modern societies. Their adoption by bioterrorists may include a need to bioengineer the organisms so as to increase their attack rate.\n\nBacillus anthracis, a toxin-producing gram-positive bacillus, was first isolated by Robert Koch as the cause of anthrax, a disease that primarily involved sheep and other farm animals. However, transmission to humans from infected animals has been recognized from antiquity as a complication of wool sorting (wool sorter's disease). An epidemic of inhalational anthrax occurred in 1979 at a biofacility in Sverdlovsk, in the former U.S.S.R, and in 2001 there was a limited epidemic of anthrax due to contaminated letters sent through the U.S. mail service by an unidentified terrorist. 99 Cutaneous penetration by the bacillus produces a necrotic eschar with rapid extension to blood vessels resulting in bacteremia, sepsis, meningitis, and death. However, the most deadly form of infection is pulmonary. In these cases, the bacilli are inhaled and proliferate rapidly in the lung, where they produce a localized hemorrhagic pneumonia with associated pleural effusion and scant neutrophilic reaction (Fig. 7-132) . They then spread via the pulmonary lymphatics to the regional lymph nodes to produce hemorrhagic mediastinitis, followed by bacteremia, toxic shock, and death in a high percentage of cases. The diagnosis must be suspected and treated early to effect a cure. However, the disease has most often first been recognized at autopsy, where tissues prove to be teeming with bacteria.\n\nPlague has played an important role in world history. The causative agent is Yersinia pestis, a gram-negative rod that is carried by animal fleas. 100 Infection occurs from contact with infected animals, with transmission occurring via aerosol or direct contact with infected secretions. Throughout history, the black rat, Rattus rattus, has been most responsible worldwide for the persistence and spread of plague in urban epidemics, but any rodent can mechanically transmit infected fleas. Although Y. pestis has not yet been seen as a bioterrorist agent, it has received attention as a potential weapon of mass destruction, because as few as 1 to 10 bacilli are sufficient to cause infection when introduced via the oral, intradermal, subcutaneous, or intravenous route. Yersinia produces a necrotizing hemorrhagic pneumonia and large numbers of extracellular organisms that can be seen with H&E staining (Fig. 7-133) . Pulmonary infection leads rapidly to bacteremia and to death by sepsis.\n\nFrancisella tularensis causes tularemia, a necrotizing bronchopneumonia that leads to sepsis and death. However, the gram-negative bacillus is less virulent than either anthrax or plague, and it produces a relatively slow progression of disease, a fact that limits its potential role as an agent of bioterrorism. 101 The histologic response in the lung is poly morphic and includes an early hemorrhagic granulohistiocytic response with microabscess formation (Fig. 7-134) , followed by granulomatous inflammation. When these coexist, the appearance of this infection is characteristic. The short coccobacillary forms require silver impregnation to be visualized in tissues.\n\nParapneumonic effusions can complicate bacterial pneumonias, but they are rarely biopsied unless they lead to a restrictive rind around the lung that requires decortication (Fig. 7-135) . Both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria can produce empyema (i.e., abscess in the pleural space) (Fig. 7-136) . Mycobacteria (Fig. 7-137) , actinomyces (Fig. 7-138) , fungi (Fig. 7-139) , and parasites can all produce pleural disease, and the nature of the inflammatory response substantially assists in narrowing the differential diagnosis, even when organisms cannot be identified. Tuberculosis can result years later in a fibrothorax, often with dystrophic calcification, but with no residual granulomatous response. Pleural eosinophilia can be a clue to the presence of an underlying parasitic infection (Fig. 7-140) , but it can also be seen in fungal and mycobacterial infections, in response to drugs and pleural metastases, and after pneumothorax.
