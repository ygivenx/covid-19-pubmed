{"title": "Viral Kinetics and Antibody Responses in Patients with COVID-19", "body": "In December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak caused by 2019-nCoV (renamed as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2) started in China 1-3 , and has been pandemic over the world 4 . As a newly appearing infectious disease, early efforts have focused on virus identification, describing the epidemiologic characteristics, clinical course, prognostics for critically illed cases, and treating the sick 5 . Among COVID-19 cases reported in mainland China (72 314 cases, updated through February 11, 2020), 81% are mild, 14% are severe, and 5% are critical. The estimated overall case fatality rate (CFR) is 2.3%. No deaths were reported among mild and severe cases, but the CFR was 49.0% among critical cases 6 \n\nIn this study we followed the strengthening the Reporting of observational studies in epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines. A total of 67 patients with COVID-19 were recruited in this study from two sections (one for severe patients, another for mild or moderate patients) of Chongqing Public Health Medical Center (CPHMC), the designated hospital for COVID-19 treatment in Chongqing central area. All patients transferred into the two sections between January 26 and February 5, 2020, were enrolled in this cohort study, with final follow-up on February 27, 2020. All of them were laboratory-confirmed as having SARS-CoV-2 infection according to WHO interim guidance.\n\nClinical specimens including nasopharyngeal swab, sputum, blood, urine and stool were collected periodically (3-6 days interval) after admission. Specimens of nine patients (among the 67 patients) who visited and admitted at the Southwest Hospital from 21 Jan to 29 Jan, 2020, were also collected before transferring into CPHMC. The flow diagram of the study design was presented in\n\nEpidemiological data were obtained with standardized investigation forms, which include patient demographics, symptom history, and relevant exposures. Clinical and radiological characteristics, laboratory findings, daily information regarding symptoms, clinical course, medications, patient vital signs, complications, treatment and outcomes data were obtained with standardized case report forms from the medical records of each patient. All data were checked by a physician and two clinical assistants. This study was approved by the ethics committee of CPHMC (document no. 2020-002-01-KY, 2020-003-01-KY) and conducted in accordance with Declaration of Helsinki principles. Written informed consent was obtained from each subject.\n\nViral RNA was extracted from patient specimens with Qiamp\u00ae viral RNA mini kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). All specimens were handled under biosafety cabinet according to laboratory biosafety guideline. Quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for the Orf1ab gene was performed with qRT-PCR kit (BGI-Shenzhen, China). The specimens were considered positive if the cycle threshold (C t ) value was \u2264 38, and negative if the results were undetermined. The C t values of qRT-PCR were converted into RNA copy number of SARS-CoV-2 by a standard curve based on C t values of reference plasmid DNA.\n\nSerum specific IgM and IgG antibodies were analyzed by ELISA kits (Livzon Diagnostics Inc., Zhuhai, China), which using SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (NP) as antigen, following the instruction manual. The OD values (450-630) were measured and titer was calculated. Three negative and two positive controls were included in each plate.\n\nTransmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed directly for nasopharyngeal swab, sputum and stool from patients. For negative-stain TEM, the specimen supernatant was fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, stained with 2% phosphotungstic acid on Formvar/Carbon-coated grids. For thin-section TEM, the specimen pellets were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 24h and then fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide, embedded with Eponate 12 resin. Ultrathin-sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, separately. The negative-stained grids and ultrathin sections were observed using JEM-1400 Plus (JEOL, Japan) and HT-7700 (Hitachi, Japan) TEM, respectively.\n\nWe defined illness onset as the first day of reported symptoms consistent with COVID-19. The incubation period was defined as the time from exposure to the onset of illness 9 . We constructed epidemic curves for date of exposure to illness onset and other key dates relating to epidemic identification and disease process by R software. The key time-to-event and its difference between severe and non-severe patients were estimated by fitting a log-normal, Gamma, Weibull, or a normal distribution by one-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. For continuous variables we used one-sample or paired-sample t-test. For categorical variables we used Mann-Whitney U test, Chi-square test, or Fisher's exact test. We also performed univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis to explore the risk factors associated with the disease severity. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05 of 2-tailed. Statistical analyses were done using the SPSS software (v13.0) and GraphPad Prism (v5.0).\n\nA total of 67 SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with 1 602 clinical specimens were enrolled in this longitudinal study (see Supplementary Figure 1 for strategies). The demographic and epidemiological characteristics were listed in Table 1 . The median age was 49 years (range, 10-77).\n\nAbout half of the patients (35, 52.2%) were men. Twenty-five of the 67 patients (37.3%) had underlying diseases. The most common symptoms at illness onset were fever (46, 68.7%) and cough (48, 71.6%).\n\nThe epidemic curve of the onset of illness among cohort patients indicate a significant decrease in the number of both imported and local cases in Chongqing metropolitan area after Wuhan City shutdown since Jan 23, 2020 (Supplementary Figure 2) . Twenty-six (38.8%) patients were infected by household contact, 33 (49.3%) were from 10 familial clusters ( Table 1) . We estimated the median incubation period was 6.0 days (range 1-15 days). There were no gender and age difference for incubation period. However, children have a prolonged incubation period (Supplementary Figure 3) . The key time-to-event distributions were listed in Supplementary Figure 4) .\n\nThe clinical characteristics of the patients after admission are shown in Supplementary Table 2 .\n\nDuring hospitalization, 42.1% of non-severe had normal temperature.

Patients with severe disease had more prominent laboratory abnormalities than those with non-severe disease. All of the 67 patients received antiviral treatment (76.1% with IFN-\u03b1 1b combined with lopinavir/ritonavir), 45 (67.2%) used oxygen support, 19 (28.4%) were given empirical antibiotic treatment. For severe patients, 29 (100%) received oxygen support, 11 (37.9%) received mechanical ventilation, 15 (51.7%) were given antibiotic treatment, and 9 (31.0%) were given systematic corticosteroid treatment (Supplementary Table 4 ). At the end of this study (Feb 27, 2020), 15 (51.7%) severe patients and 31 (81.6%) non-severe patients were discharged, and no patients had died.\n\nA total of 1 260 samples from all 67 patients were collected, including 377 nasopharyngeal swab, 221 sputum, 220 stool, 231 urine and 211 plasma samples ( Table 2) . SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels in the nasopharyngeal swabs (Fig 1A) , sputum ( Fig 1B) and stools (Fig 1C) peaked in the first week, 1-20 days and 6-13 days after symptom onset, respectively, after which RNA levels typically began to decrease. Higher viral loads (inversely related to C t value) were detected in the sputum than those in the nasopharyngeal and stools (peak loads about 2.3\u00d710 9 , 2.3\u00d710 8 and 1.1\u00d710 8 copies per mililiter, respectively, Supplementary Figure 5) . The viral loads stratified for severe and non-severe patients were also depicted (Fig 1D, 1E , and 1F).\n\nThe median duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding were 12 days (range, 3-38 ) in nasopharyngeal swabs, 19 days (range, 5-37) in sputum and 18 days (range, 7-26) in stools ( Table 2) author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . negative time-points (Supplementary Figure 8C) . Additionally, six patients were confirmed as COVID-19 for SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive in sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), or stools (Supplementary Figure 8D) .\n\nAmong patients in this COVID-19 cohort, symptom progression and SARS-CoV-2 shedding after illness onset was depicted. The numbers of patients with reported cough but not fever appeared to align with the proportion of detectable RNA both in nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum (Fig 1H) .\n\nThe numbers of patients with positive stool-RNA appeared to align with reported cough and expectoration, but not with diarrhea (Fig 1 I) .\n\nWe found typical coronaviral particles in sputum directly by transmission electron microscopy, both for negative staining and ultrathin section preparations. As shown in were excluded in the subsequent dynamic antibody analysis. Patients could be categorized as strong responders (peak titer > 2-fold of cutoff value), weak responders (peak titer 1-2 fold of cutoff value), and non-responders (peak titer below cutoff value). For IgM (Fig 3A) and IgG (Fig 3B) , 30 (51.7%) and 9 (16.7%) were non-responders, 10 (17.2%) and 33 (61.1%) were weak responders, and 18 (31.1%) and 12 (22.2%) were strong responders ( Table 4 ).\n\nThe proportion of strong responders is significantly higher and the proportion of weak responders is significantly lower in severe patients than that in non-severe patients, both for IgM (p = 0.017) and\n\nIgG (p = 0.032). Similarly, the titers of serum IgM and IgG were continuously significantly higher All rights reserved.

It's notable that the proportion for viral clearance at day 7 after antibodies appearance was significantly higher in non-severe patients than that in severe patients (for IgM, 81.8% vs. 7.7%, p = 0.001; for IgG, 60.0% vs. 26.3, p = 0.048). Furthermore, the weak responders for IgG antibodies had a significantly higher viral clearance rate (56.5%) than that (9.1%) of strong responders (p= 0.011, Fig 3E, Fig 3F, and Table 4 ).\n\nIn a multivariable model that included available data from 67 patients, any reported fever (OR, 17.

We found some features of Chongqing cases were different from the early cases reported from Wuhan, China 2, [9] [10] [11] . For example, our cases were identified and admitted to hospital at earlier stage for COVID-19 than Wuhan cases, and most cases were first-or second-generation cases with clear contact history.\n\nThe incubation period has no change after spreading out of Wuhan, and has no sex or age differences. However, although none of the only three children developed to severe type of disease, should increase the sensitivity of the qRT-PCR assay.

Because no report demonstrates viable SARS-CoV-2 virus could be isolated from stool 18 , our data implicates the stool SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA may directly from swallowed sputum, not from infected intestinal mucosa or bile ducts. We visualized typical coronavirus in the sputum of patient directly by electron microscopy, which demonstrated the utility of this traditional technique for clinical diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nIn this study, we also determined the IgM and IgG (antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein) dynamics in patients at acute and early convalescent phase. Although the observed profile of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein was consistent with common findings with regard to acute viral infectious diseases 15,19,20 , however, we have some unique findings which may be novel and important for the understanding to SARS-CoV-2 infection. First, we observed three types of antibody responses in COVID-19 patients, strong, weak and non-response. Second, we found that the earlier response, higher antibody titer and higher proportion of strong responders for IgM and IgG were significantly associated with disease severity. Third, the weak responders for IgG antibodies had a significantly higher viral clearance rate than that of strong responders. These data indicates strong antibody response is associated with disease severity, and weak antibody response is associated with viral clearance, which resembles SARS 21 and MERS 15 . The profile of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies may be helpful for the diagnosis and in epidemiologic surveys.\n\nHowever, the role of various antibodies relating to disease severity, immunologically directed treatment, and vaccination efficacy, deserves urgent investigation.\n\nNevertheless, there are some limitations for our study. First, large-scale, multi-center cohorts from other regions are needed to verify our preliminary findings. Second, the viability of virus in stools, plasma and urine, and its role in pathogenesis or transmission need to be clarified. Third, antibodies to spike and envelope proteins, and their role for protection for SARS-CoV-2 infection or reinfection are still unknown and waiting for future investigations.\n\nAll rights reserved.
