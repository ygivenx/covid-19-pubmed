{"title": "A novel method for synthetic vaccine construction based on protein assembly", "body": "The current SpyTag/SpyCatcher system consists of a 13 aa SpyTag and a 138 aa SpyCatcher. To further simplify this system for engineering purposes and to minimize its immunogenicity, we tried to truncate the SpyCatcher protein while maintaining its conjugation activity. A structural analysis found that aa 53\u2013118 are probably essential for the conjugation activity. An immunogenicity analysis revealed four major immune epitopes at the N-terminus (aa 32\u201350, aa 57\u201366) and C-terminus (aa 104\u2013112, aa 121\u2013138) (Figure S1). Considering these together, we performed several truncations, as shown in Figure 1a. The truncation with deletion at the N-terminus (24\u201347 aa) was named SpyCatcher\u0394N, and the truncation with deletions at both the N-terminus and the C-terminus (24\u201347 and 121\u2013138 aa) was named SpyCatcher\u0394NC. The truncated SpyCatcher proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by Ni-NTA chromatography (Figure 1b). The full-length and truncated SpyCatcher proteins were then used to immunize C57BL/6 mice. Fourteen days later, antibody levels in the sera were determined by ELISA. As shown in Figure 1c, the antibody levels induced by SpyCatcher\u0394N and SpyCatcher\u0394NC were significantly lower than those induced by full-length SpyCatcher. No significant difference was found between SpyCatcher\u0394N and SpyCatcher\u0394NC. Next, we further tested the efficiency of the binding of the truncated SpyCatcher proteins to the SpyTag fusion protein, \u03b1DEC205-SpyTag, which was made by genetic fusion of SpyTag with a single-chain antibody against murine DEC205 (\u03b1DEC205) at its C-terminus. As shown in Figures 1d and 1e, there was no significant difference in binding efficiency between SpyCatcher\u0394N and full-length SpyCatcher, consistent with the results of a recent study24. However, the binding efficiency of SpyCatcher\u0394NC was obviously lower than that of full-length SpyCatcher. Therefore, SpyCatcher\u0394N was chosen for further studies.\n\nA full vaccine usually consists of at least an immunoregulatory functional unit in addition to the antigen. The modified single-chain antibody \u03b1DEC205-SpyTag was used as a functional unit in the present study. The OVA8-TBEV ED3 DNA sequence, which encodes model antigens including both a CD8 T-cell epitope (ovalbumin257-264) and a B-cell epitope (TBEV ED3), was genetically fused to the C-terminus of SpyCatcher\u0394N (Sc-OVA8-ED3). Conjugation of \u03b1DEC205-SpyTag and Sc-OVA8-ED3 would result in a fully functional vaccine (Figure 2a). \u03b1DEC205-SpyTag was expressed in FreeStyle\u2122 293-F cells and purified by Protein A chromatography (Figure 2b, Lane 1). The Sc-OVA8-ED3 fusion protein was expressed in E. coli and purified by Ni-NTA chromatography (Figure 2b, Lane 2). The covalent binding reaction was tested under different conditions and with different molar ratios. A 1:1.5 molar ratio of \u03b1DEC205-SpyTag:Sc-OVA8-ED3 at 4\u00b0C for 2 h was found to give rise to an optimal binding efficiency for the proteins. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that more than 90% of the input \u03b1DEC205-SpyTag was conjugated (Figure 2b, Lane 3). The synthetic DEC205-targeted vaccine (\u03b1DEC205-Sc-OVA8-ED3) was then purified by Protein A chromatography, with a purity above 90% (Figure 2b, Lane 4).\n\nTo test the DC-targeting ability of the synthetic \u03b1DEC205-Sc-OVA8-ED3 fusion protein, splenocytes isolated from na\u00efve WT C57BL/6 mice were incubated with the fusion protein or an isotype-control protein. After staining with a fluorescent secondary antibody, the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. As shown in Figure 3a, conventional DCs were gated as MHC class IIhigh and CD11chigh cells, and the CD8\u03b1+ DC and CD8\u03b1\u2212 DC subsets were then each further gated and analyzed. As shown in Figure 3b (top panel), the \u03b1DEC205 fusion protein preferentially bound to CD8\u03b1+ DCs, rather than to CD8\u03b1\u2212 DCs or other immune cells (data not shown), which is consistent with the specific expression of DEC205 on the former subset of DCs. To further test its targeting ability in vivo, na\u00efve WT mice were immunized with the \u03b1DEC205 fusion protein, together with CpG/Poly I:C. Next, 24 h after immunization, draining lymph nodes (DLNs) were isolated and digested to form single-cell suspensions. \u03b1DEC205 fusion protein-bound cells were visualized with fluorescent secondary antibody staining followed by flow cytometry. Preferential targeting to CD8\u03b1+ DCs was confirmed (Figure 3b, bottom panel). Thus, the SpyTag/SpyCatcher system allows assembly of SpyCatcher fusion proteins with \u03b1DEC205-SpyTag, without influencing its DC-targeting ability.\n\nWe next tested whether the synthetic vaccine could generate an efficient cytotoxic T-cell response. This was measured by IFN\u03b3 intracellular staining and in vivo specific killing assays. Na\u00efve WT C57BL/6 mice were immunized twice with the \u03b1DEC205-Sc-OVA8-ED3 fusion protein or the Sc-OVA8-ED3 protein at a 7-day interval. CpG1826/Poly I:C was used as adjuvant. For the IFN\u03b3 intracellular staining assay, 5 days after the last injection, splenocytes were isolated from the immunized mice and stimulated with 5 \u03bcg/ml OT1 peptide in a U-bottom 96-well plate for 6 h. The IFN\u03b3-producing CD8 T cells were then stained and analyzed by flow cytometry. The splenocytes from the \u03b1DEC205-Sc-OVA8-ED3-vaccinated mice showed a significantly higher percentage of IFN\u03b3-producing CD8 T cells compared with the splenocytes from Sc-OVA8-ED3-immunized mice (Figures 4a and 4b). For the in vivo specific killing assay, 4 days after the secondary injection, target cells (an equal mixture of OVA8 peptide-loaded, CFSE-high, labeled na\u00efve splenocytes and non-loaded, CFSE-low, labeled na\u00efve splenocytes) were transferred to the immunized mice. Next, 20 h later, the proportion of CFSE-labeled cells in the spleen was analyzed. A significantly higher specific killing rate was found in mice immunized with the \u03b1DEC205-Sc-OVA8-ED3 vaccine than in control-vaccinated mice (Figure 4c). These data suggest that the synthetic DC-targeted vaccine is superior to the non-DC targeted vaccine in inducing CTL responses.\n\nIt has been shown that targeting antigens to DEC205 can induce strong antibody responses in the presence of adjuvants. We next tested whether synthetic \u03b1DEC205-Sc-OVA8-ED3 can elicit a better antibody response against the antigen TBEV ED3. Na\u00efve WT C57BL/6 mice were immunized twice with 300 pmol \u03b1DEC205-Sc-OVA8-ED3 fusion protein or Sc-OVA8-ED3 protein, together with CpG1826/Poly I:C as an adjuvant, at a 14-day interval. Seven days after the last vaccination, the mice were bled, and anti-TBEV ED3 antibody was measured by ELISA. Compared with the Sc-OVA8-ED3 control vaccine, \u03b1DEC205-Sc-OVA8-ED3 elicited a significantly increased antibody response against TBEV ED3 (Figure 5). Thus, the synthetic DC-targeting vaccine is efficient in inducing both T- and B-cell responses.\n\nA successful vaccine is an integral, functional whole composed of different elements. The discovery of effective antigens and immunomodulatory molecules is a major challenge in the field of vaccine development34. Modern immunology and genomics provide a large amount of candidates for each. Simple, rapid and efficient experimental screening of the optimal composition of a vaccine is generally in demand, especially when facing pandemic outbreaks of infections, such as SARS-CoV in 200325, H1N1 influenza in 200926 and MERS-CoV in 201227. The traditional de novo generation of gene-based synthetic vaccines is both time consuming and costly. In our present study, based on the SpyTag/SpyCatcher technique, we have developed a novel method of vaccine construction by protein assembly based on pre-prepared vaccine components. We have employed this technique for the construction of a DC-targeting vaccine and have found it highly efficient to induce both T- and B-cell responses. Although this strategy still relies on genetic manipulation and protein production, it does not require synthesizing a large, complex fusion protein de novo every time; the strategy only produces smaller protein components as building blocks, which is easier and faster. This block-building strategy may allow people to construct various formulations of vaccines conveniently and efficiently when needed. The approach may simplify the whole process of vaccine generation and accelerate antigen screening and verification (Figure 6). In addition, certain vaccine components (building blocks) may be easily reused for the construction of other vaccines.\n\nDifferent methods have been developed to construct synthetic vaccines. The traditional way is genetic manipulation, which provides great flexibility. However, this de novo generation usually takes a long time, and it is occasionally difficult to express large molecules. Chemical conjugation offers an alternative, fast way to overcome the shortcomings mentioned above. However, the chemical conjugation process is usually not easily controlled, resulting in poor homogeneity in terms of the degree of conjugation and the number of conjugation sites. An isopeptide bond is an amide bond formed between the side-chain amine of lysine and the side-chain carboxyl group of either glutamate or aspartate. This bond has been shown to be very useful for protein-protein coupling and protein modification28. SpyTag/SpyCatcher was recently developed and found to be highly efficient for site-specific protein conjugation. Impelled by the limitations of current methods for vaccine construction and inspired by the concept of synthetic vaccinology, we hypothesized that this new technique might be useful for easily and precisely assembling different vaccine components at the protein level. This approach may possess several advantages: (1) In contrast to genetic manipulation, this system does not generate a whole vaccine de novo; instead, it produces different protein components and assembles them as needed. This method may thus significantly reduce the time spent and the cost, especially when many designs need to be tested. (2) In contrast to chemical conjugation-based approaches, this system allows quantitative and site-specific installation of antigens at a designated position in the antibody that does not influence the antibody-targeting ability. (3) SpyTag and SpyCatcher can efficiently react with each other to form a stable covalent bond under diverse conditions. (4) SpyTag is reactive no matter it is at the N-terminus, the C-terminus, or the internal site of a protein and therefore offers greater flexibility than other split protein-derived systems or intein/sortase tag systems do2930. In addition, recent work by the Howarth group has optimized this system to potentially provide further advantages31: (1) SpyCatcher can be shortened to KTag, allowing SpyTag and KTag to form a peptide-peptide ligation. Thus, this new system could further reduce the influence of SpyCatcher's own immunogenicity, if any. (2) The SpyTag-and-KTag system allows cycles of conjugation, which enables assembly of a vaccine with multiple components, such as protein-based adjuvants and multivalent antigens. (3) The short KTag makes high-throughput screening of epitopes feasible because the short KTag-epitope fusion peptides can be easily prepared by total synthesis.\n\nThe results of the present study showed that the optimized SpyCatcher\u0394N exhibits much lower immunogenicity than wild-type SpyCatcher does, without influencing the ability to bind to \u03b1DEC205-SpyTag. The antigen-containing fusion protein SpyCatcher\u0394N-OVA8-ED3 can also efficiently bind to \u03b1DEC205-SpyTag, without affecting the targeting ability of DEC205 either in vitro or in vivo. Subsequent results from the animal study showed that an \u03b1DEC205 adduct vaccine can elicit enhanced T-cell and B-cell responses. Furthermore, this new method is highly translatable; in fact, our unpublished data demonstrated its usefulness and efficacy in the construction of other vaccines.\n\nIn summary, we have established a convenient and efficient platform for conjugating antigens of interest to specific antibodies using the optimized SpyTag/SpyCatcher system. This platform could be very useful in antigen screening and vaccine development against infectious diseases and cancers. Furthermore, the use of this method is probably not limited to vaccine development; it may have broader applications. Antibodies and recombinant proteins have been extensively studied in animal and clinical studies of various diseases for preventative and therapeutic purposes. The strategy proposed in our current study may provide an easy and efficient protein-engineering method for generating bi-specific antibodies and producing multifunctional fusion proteins or antibodies.\n\nFemale C57BL/6 mice (6\u20138 weeks old) were purchased from Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co. (Beijing, China). All mice were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions in the animal care facilities at the Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, using protocols approved by the Institutional Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\nThe full-length SpyCatcher expression plasmid pDEST14-SpyCatcher was kindly provided by Dr. Mark Howarth (University of Oxford, UK). DNA sequences of truncated forms of SpyCatcher were first amplified by PCR using the following primers: common forward primer \u0394Sc-F1 (GATTACGACATCCCAACGACCGAAAACCTGTATTTTCAGGGCGATAGTGCTAC) and reverse primers \u0394Sc-R1 (CGCGGATCCTTAAT TAACTGTAAAGGTAATAGCAGTTGCT, for SpyCatcher\u0394N) and \u0394Sc-R2 (CGCGGATCCTTAAATATGAGCGTCACCTTTAGTTGCTTT, for SpyCatcher\u0394NC). A 6\u00d7-histidine tag coding sequence was further added by secondary PCR using \u0394Sc-F2 (GGAATTCCATATGTCGTACTACCATCACC ATCACCATCACGATTACGACATCCCAA) and \u0394Sc-R1 or \u0394Sc-R2. The bold font indicates an NdeI or BamHI site. The underlined letters encode a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site or 6\u00d7-histidine tag. The PCR products were cloned into pDEST14 using the NdeI and BamHI sites.\n\nFor protein expression, BL21(DE3) competent E. coli cells were transformed with respective plasmids, and single colonies were picked and cultured in 5 ml LB at 37\u00b0C overnight. The cultures were then amplified to 400 ml and induced by 1 mM IPTG for 6 h. The bacterial cultures were harvested and lysed, and the targeting proteins were purified using a Ni-NTA agarose column (ComWin Biotech, Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer's protocol.\n\nTo generate a SpyCatcher\u0394N-OVA8-TBEV ED3 expression plasmid, cDNA encoding TBEV ED3 was PCR amplified with the plasmid pET-30a(+)-TBEV ED3, provided by Dr. Xiaoping Kang (Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, China), and G4S linker and the OVA8 epitope (chicken ovalbumin257-264, or SIINFEKL) were added at the N-terminus during PCR. The primers used in the PCR were as follows: OE F (CCGCTCGAGGGCGGTGGTGGCAGCCAGCTTGAGAGTATAATCAACTTTGAAAAAC TGACTGAATGGACATAC ACAATGTGCG) and OE R (CCGCGAGCTCTTATCA TTTTTGGAACCATTG), in which the bold font indicates an XhoI or SacI site. The SpyCatcher\u0394N fragment was amplified using the primers \u0394NSc-F (GCAATTCCATATGTC GTACTACCATCAC) and \u0394NSc-R (CCGCTCGAGAATATGAGCGTCACCTTTA G), in which the bold font indicates an NdeI or XhoI site. The SpyCatcher\u0394N and OVA8-TBEV ED3 fragments were then ligated and cloned into pDEST14 at the NdeI and SacI sites. Expression and purification of the SpyCatcher\u0394N-OVA8-TBEV ED3 protein were performed as described above.\n\nA plasmid encoding the DNA sequence of the variable regions of the heavy and light chains of anti-DEC205 (clone NLDC145) was kindly provided by Dr. Ralph Steinman (The Rockefeller University, USA). The single chain-encoding DNA was PCR amplified using the following primers: DEC205 F, GCG CGTACGGAGGTGAAGCTGTTGGAATC and DEC205 R, GCGTTCGAACCGTTT CAATTCCAGCTTGG. The DNA was then cloned into the pEE12.4 expression plasmid (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) between the IgG\u03ba leading sequence and the human IgG Fc sequence using BsiWI and BstBI (bold font). The SpyTag-encoding sequence (GCTCACATCGTGATGGTGGACGCCTACAAGCCCACCAAG) and a GSGESG linker (GGATCCGGCGAGTCCGGC) were then genetically fused to the C-terminus of the human IgG Fc fragment by PCR to construct the final plasmid pEE12.4 \u03b1DEC205-SpyTag.\n\nThe \u03b1DEC205-SpyTag fusion protein was transiently transfected into and expressed in FreeStyle\u2122 293-F cells (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Briefly, FreeStyle\u2122 293-F cells (293F) were inoculated at 0.8 \u00d7 106/ml in CD OptiCHO\u2122 media (Gibco Life Technologies) 2 days before transfection. The cells were washed once with the FreeStyle 293 media (Gibco Life Technologies) right before transfection and inoculated into 200 ml pre-heated FreeStyle 293 media. Polyethylenimine (PEI) (Polysciences, Warrington, UK) and a plasmid DNA mixture (plasmid DNA (500 \u03bcg) and PEI (1.5 mg) in 10 ml FreeStyle 293 media) were added to the culture. Long\u2122 R3IGF-1 (SAFC biosciences, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was then added at a final concentration of 50 \u03bcg/l. The cells were cultured at a shaking speed of approximately 90 rpm. Four hours later, an equal volume (200 ml) of EX-CELL\u2122 293 media (SAFC biosciences) was added, and the shaking speed was increased to 130 rpm. Next, 24 h after transfection, valproic acid (VPA) (Sigma- Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was added to the culture, with a final concentration of 3.8 mM, to inhibit the cells' growth. Seven days later, the culture media were collected for fusion protein purification by Protein A chromatography according to the manufacturer's protocol (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA, USA).\n\nThe purified truncated SpyCatcher and SpyCatcher\u0394N-OVA8-ED3 fusion proteins were conjugated to \u03b1DEC205-SpyTag in vitro to construct \u03b1DEC205 fusion-protein adducts. To assay reconstitution, \u03b1DEC205-SpyTag (10 \u03bcM) was reacted with truncated SpyCatchers (10 \u03bcM) in PBS at a molar ratio of 1:1 at 4\u00b0C for 10 min. SDS-PAGE and gray-intensity analysis with ImagePro Plus software (Media Cybernetics, Rockville, MD, USA) were used to evaluate the reconstitution efficiency. For vaccine generation, \u03b1DEC205-SpyTag (10 \u03bcM) was mixed with SpyCatcher-OVA8-ED3 (15 \u03bcM) in PBS at a molar ratio of 1:1.5 at 4\u00b0C for 2 h. The conjugated \u03b1DEC205-Sc-OVA8-ED3 adduct was then purified by Protein A chromatography according to the manufacturer's protocol (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). The product was desalted by buffer exchange (PBS) using Zeba Spin Desalting Columns (Thermo Scientific Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol.\n\nFor the in vitro assay, the spleens of C57BL/6 mice were harvested and processed into single-cell suspensions in PBS containing 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Next, 2 \u00d7 106 splenocytes were incubated with an anti-Fc\u03b3R mAb (clone 2.4G2) for 10 min at 4\u00b0C to block nonspecific binding. Then, 10 pmol of \u03b1DEC205-Sc-OVA8-ED3 adduct, \u03b1DEC205-SpyTag or isotype-control antibody (human IgG Fc fusion protein prepared in-house) was added and incubated for 0.5 h at 4\u00b0C. The cells were stained with fluorescent secondary antibody (PE-conjugated anti-human IgG, polyclonal) or antibodies against cell surface markers, including anti-CD8\u03b1-PE-Cy7 (53-6.7), anti-CD11c-APC (N418) and anti-I-A/I-E-FITC (M5/114.15.2). Flow cytometry analysis was performed with a BD FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA), and the data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc., Ashland, OR, USA). All antibodies were purchased from eBioscience (San Diego, CA, USA) or Tonbo Biosciences (San Diego, CA, USA).\n\nFor the in vivo assay, na\u00efve WT C57BL/6 mice were injected subcutaneously in the tail base with 200 pmol of the \u03b1DEC205-Sc-OVA8-ED3 adduct, \u03b1DEC205-SpyTag or isotype-control antibody. After 20 h, inguinal DLNs were collected and digested to form a single-cell suspension. The cells were stained with an anti-Fc\u03b3R mAb, followed by PE-conjugated anti-human IgG antibody staining before flow cytometry analysis.\n\nMicrotiter plates (Corning Life Sciences, Tewksbury, MA, USA) were coated with 2 \u03bcg/ml (100 \u03bcl/well) full-length SpyCatcher or TBEV ED3 protein in carbonate buffer at 0.1 M (pH 9.5) overnight at 4\u00b0C. After washing away the unbound proteins, the plates were incubated with PBS containing 5% FBS at 37\u00b0C for 1.5 h. Serially diluted serum samples from immunized mice were added and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1.5 h. HRP-labeled anti-mouse IgG was used as the detection antibody (Zhong Shan-Golden Bridge Biological Technology Co., Ltd, Beijing, China). The plates were visualized by adding 100 \u03bcl TMB (eBioscience) and were read at 450 nm using a SpectraMax Plus (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).\n\nNa\u00efve WT C57BL/6 mice were subcutaneously immunized twice with 30 pmol of \u03b1DEC205-Sc-OVA8-ED3 or Sc-OVA8-ED3, along with 30 \u03bcg CpG1826 (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Beijing, China) and 30 \u03bcg Poly I:C (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA, USA) as an adjuvant, at a 7-day interval. Five days after the secondary vaccination, the spleens of the immunized mice were harvested and processed into single-cell suspensions. Splenocytes (1 \u00d7 106 cells/well in triplicate) were restimulated in U-bottom 96-well plates with 5 \u03bcg/ml OT1 peptide (SIINFEKL) (ChinaPeptides, Suzhou, China) for 6 h in the presence of brefeldin A (5 \u03bcg/ml) at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. After restimulation, the cells were first surface stained with APC-conjugated anti-mouse CD8\u03b1 antibody (53-6.7) before fixation/permeabilization and intracellular staining for IFN\u03b3 (XMG1.2). All of the reagents and antibodies were purchased from eBioscience, and the manufacturer's protocol was followed for the surface and intracellular staining.\n\nNa\u00efve WT C57BL/6 mice were immunized subcutaneously with 30 pmol of \u03b1DEC205-Sc-OVA8-ED3 or Sc-OVA8-ED3, along with CpG1826 and Poly I:C as an adjuvant, as described above. Five days after the secondary vaccination, the immunized mice were injected intravenously with the peptide-pulsed target cells for in vivo killing. Briefly, congenic na\u00efve splenocytes (2 \u00d7 107 cells/ml) were pulsed with 10 \u03bcg/ml OT1 peptide for 1.5 h at 37\u00b0C. After one wash in PBS, the cells were labeled with 5 \u03bcM CFSE (CFSEhigh) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for 10 min, after which 20% FBS was immediately added to terminate the labeling reaction. The cells were then washed twice in PBS before use. Meanwhile, un-pulsed splenocytes were labeled with 0.5 \u03bcM CFSE (CFSElow) following the same procedure. A 1:1 mixture of CFSEhigh and CFSElow cells (2.5 \u00d7 106 cells from each population) was co-transferred to the immunized mice. Twenty hours later, the spleens were harvested, and single-cell suspensions were prepared and analyzed by flow cytometry. The percentage of specific killing was evaluated with the following formula: % specific killing = 1 \u2212 % survival, in which % survival = (the number of OT1-pulsed target cells remaining)/(the number of un-pulsed target cells remaining).\n\nBepiPred Linear Epitope Prediction was used for immunogenicity analysis32, and the crystal structure data from the RCSB Protein Data Bank were used for structural analysis.\n\nAll data were analyzed using an unpaired two-tailed t test and GraphPad Prism statistical software (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).
