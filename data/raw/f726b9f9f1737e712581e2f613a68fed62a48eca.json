{"title": "Journal Pre-proof Analysis of therapeutic targets for SARS-CoV-2 and discovery of potential drugs by computational methods Analysis of therapeutic targets for SARS-CoV-2 and discovery of potential drugs by computational methods", "body": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) have caused a major outbreak of human fatal pneumonia since the beginning of the 21st century. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) broke out and spread to five continents in 2003 with a lethal rate of 10% 1, 2 \n\n(MERS-CoV) broke out in the Arabian Peninsula in 2012 with a fatality rate of 35% 3, 4 . Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are zoonotic viruses, and their hosts are bat/civet and dromedary, respectively 5, 6 . To date, no specific therapeutic drug or vaccine has been approved for the treatment of human coronavirus. Therefore, CoVs are considered to be a kind of viruses, of which the outbreak poses a huge threat to humans. Because Wuhan Viral Pneumonia cases were discovered at the end of 2019, the coronavirus was named as 2019 novel coronavirus or \"2019-nCoV\" by the World Health Organization (WHO) on January 12, 2020 7, 8 . Since 2019-nCoV is highly homologous with SARS-CoV, it is considered a close relative of SARS-CoV. The\n\nInternational Virus Classification Commission (ICTV) classified 2019-nCoV as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on February 11, 2020. At the same time, WHO named the disease caused by 2019-nCoV as COVID-19. Common symptoms of a person infected with coronavirus include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath, and dyspnea. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure, and even death. There is currently no specific medicine or treatment for diseases caused by SARS-CoV-2 9 .\n\nCoVs are enveloped viruses with a positive RNA genome, belonging to the Coronaviridae family of the order Nidovirales, which are divided into four genera (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, and \u03b4). The SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the \u03b2 genus.\n\nCoVs contain at least four structural proteins: Spike (S) protein, envelope (E) protein, membrane (M) protein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein 10 . Among them, Spike promotes host attachment and virus-cell membrane fusion during virus infection. Therefore, Spike determines to some extent the host range.\n\nPotential anti-coronavirus therapies can be divided into two categories depending on the target, one is acting on the human immune system or human cells, and the other is on coronavirus itself. In terms of the human immune system, the innate immune system response plays an important role in controlling the replication and infection of coronavirus, and interferon is expected to enhance the immune response 11 .\n\nBlocking the signal pathways of human cells required for virus replication may show a certain anti-viral effect.\n\nIn addition, viruses often bind to receptor proteins on the surface of cells in order to entering human cells, for example, the SARS virus binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor [12] [13] [14] and the MERS binds to the DPP4 receptor 15, 16 . The therapies acting on the coronavirus itself include preventing the synthesis of viral RNA through acting on the genetic material of the virus, inhibiting virus replication through acting on critical enzymes of virus, and blocking the virus binding to human cell receptors or inhibiting the virus's self-assembly process through acting on some structural proteins.\n\nIn the fight against coronavirus, scientists have come up with three strategies for developing new drugs 17 .\n\nThe first strategy is to test existing broad-spectrum anti-virals 18 . Interferons, ribavirin, and cyclophilin inhibitors used to treat coronavirus pneumonia fall into this category. The advantages of these therapies are that their metabolic characteristics, dosages used, potential efficacy and side effects are clear as they have been approved for treating viral infections. But the disadvantage is that these therapies are too \"broad-spectrum\" and cannot kill coronaviruses in a targeted manner, and their side effects should not be underestimated. The second strategy is to use existing molecular databases to screen for molecules that may have therapeutic effect on coronavirus 19, 20 . High-throughput screening makes this strategy possible, and new functions of many drug molecules can be found through this strategy, for example, the discovery of anti-HIV infection drug lopinavir/ritonavir. The third strategy is directly based on the genomic information and pathological characteristics of different coronaviruses to develop new targeted drugs from scratch.\n\nTheoretically, the drugs found through these therapies would exhibit better anti-coronavirus effects, but the research procedure of new drug might cost several years, or even more than 10 years 11 .\n\nFor the development of medicines treating SARS-CoV-2, the fastest way is to find potential molecules from the marketed drugs. Once the efficacy is determined, it can be approved by the Green Channel or approved by the hospital ethics committee for rapid clinical treatment of patients. Herein, bioinformatics analysis on the proteins encoded by the novel coronavirus genes was systematically conducted, and the proteins of SARS-CoV-2 were compared with other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. We conducted homology modeling to build all possible protein structures, including viral papain like protease (PLpro), main protease (3CLpro, also named 3-chymotrypsin-like protease), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), helicase, Spike, etc. Further, we used these proteins and human relative proteins [human ACE2 and type-II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) enzymes] as targets to screen ZINC U. S Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug database (ZINC drug database, ZDD), our own database of traditional Chinese medicine and natural products (including reported common anti-viral components from traditional Chinese medicine), and the database of commonly used anti-viral drugs (78 compounds) by virtual ligand screening method. This study predicts a variety of compounds that may inhibit novel coronaviruses and provides scientists with information on compounds that may be effective. Subsequent validation of anti-viral effects in vitro and in vivo will provide useful information for clinical treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia.\n\nThe complete genome of Wuhan-Hu-1 (NC_045512.2) was downloaded from NCBI nucleotide database. The nucleotide sequences were aligned with whole database using BLASTn to search for homology viral genomes (Alogorithm parameters, max target sequences: 1000, expect threshold: 10). \n\nWe obtained the SARS-CoV-2 genome from Gene Bank. The genome sequence of Wuhan-Hu-1 was aligned with whole database using BLASTn to search for homology viral genomes. After phylogenetic analysis and sequence alignment of 23 coronaviruses from various species. We found three coronaviruses from bat (96%, 88% and 88% for Bat-Cov RaTG13, bat-SL-CoVZXC12 and bat-SL-CoVZC45, respectively) have the highest genome sequence identity to SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 1A) . Moreover, as shown in Fig is helicase. As a new coronavirus, structure biology study about these proteins still at early stage. Until now, only one crystal structure of 3CLpro has been deposited in PDB (pdb code: 6LU7).\n\nIn order to acquire more three-dimensional structure information of proteins about these new coronaviruses for subsequent drug screening, we aligned all protein sequences from SARS-CoV-2 with all sequences in PDB1018 database in Fold & Function Assignment System (Supporting Information Figs. S19-S34). Fortunately, most of these proteins have found their high homology proteins that have three-dimensional structure, with homology between 72%-99% (Supporting Information Table S1 ). Those PDB codes were labeled below the corresponding sequences in Fig. 2B . Unsurprisingly, all these proteins with the highest homology are from SARS. Nevertheless, there are some proteins still have not high homologous in the database. After the prediction of transmembrane helices in these proteins carried out in TMHMM Server, as expected, we found that all these proteins are transmembrane proteins except for Nsp2 (Supporting Information Figs. S35-S41). So far, we have found as much structural information of this viral proteins as possible, which provides the basis for subsequent homology modeling and drug screening. Before homology modeling, all these proteins sequences were aligned with model sequences derived from SARS-CoV and predicted secondary structure as the same time ( Fig. 3A and Table S1 ). Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 3A , important anti-virus drug target protein like 3CLpro, PLpro, and RdRp are highly conserved between those two human coronaviruses, especially in functional region. As shown in Table S1 , all these potential drug target proteins have been homologously modeled, and all generated protein models were provided as the PDB files in Supporting Information. All other coordinates of target-screening hit complexes can be provided upon request.\n\nIn order to verify the accuracy of homologous modeling, we aligned the computational structure of the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro that modeled from the SARS-CoV 3CLpro with its crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro (6LU7) just solved and released during this manuscript was being prepared. sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV is 76% (Fig. 3C ). Recent researches speculated that SARS-CoV-2 could also bind to ACE2, and this was verified by computational docking and ELISA measurement 24, 25 . Moreover, homology of the Spike-RBD sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and Bat-CoV\n\nRaTG13 is as high as 95%. Despite the high homology of RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 in Spike sequence, our analysis found that four among the five most important amino acids (L465, L495, Y502, D510, and H514) that bind to ACE2 12 in Bat-CoV RaTG13 differ from SARS-CoV-2 ( Fig. 3C ). And there is no related research literature about whether Bat-CoV RaTG13 can infect human yet. We also performed homology modeling on the Bat-CoV RaTG13 Spike RBD (Supporting Information Fig. S1 ). Three Spike RBD structures have been docked with human ACE2. Among them, for the conformations which most resemble the crystal structure of SARS RBD-ACE2 complex 26 , the binding free energy between SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD and human ACE2 was -33.72 kcal/mol (Supporting Information Fig. S2 ), that between SARS-CoV Spike RBD and ACE2 was -49.22 kcal/mol (Supporting Information Fig. S3 ), and that between Bat-CoV RaTG13 Spike RBD and ACE2 was -31.06 kcal/mol (Supporting Information Fig. S4 ).\n\nThe therapies that act on the coronavirus can be divided into several categories based on the specific pathways:\n\n(1) some acting on enzymes or functional proteins that are critical to virus, preventing the virus RNA synthesis and replication; (2) some acting on structural proteins of virus, blocking virus from binding to human cell receptors, or inhibiting the virus's self-assembly process; (3) some producing virulence factor to restore host's innate immunity; (4) some acting on host's specific receptors or enzymes, preventing virus from entering into host's cells. The related target proteins include Nsp1, Nsp3 (Nsp3b, Nsp3c, PLpro, and Nsp3e), Based on homology models of the above 18 viral proteins (19 models) and 2 human targets, we resorted to structure-based virtual ligand screening method using ICM 3.7.3 modeling software (MolSoft LLC) to screen potential small-molecule compounds from a ZINC Drug Database (2924 compounds) and a small in-house database of traditional Chinese medicine and natural products (including reported common anti-viral components from traditional Chinese medicine) and derivatives (1066 compounds). Compounds with lower calculated binding energies (being expressed with scores and mfScores) are considered to have higher binding affinities with the target protein.\n\nAs \n\nPLpro is responsible for the cleavages of N-terminus of the replicase poly-protein to release Nsp1, Nsp2 and Nsp3, which is essential for correcting virus replication 27 .\n\nPLpro was also confirmed to be significant to antagonize the host's innate immunity [28] [29] [30] . As an indispensable enzyme in the process of coronavirus replication and infection of the host, PLpro has been a popular target for coronavirus inhibitors. It is very valuable for targeting PLpro to treat coronavirus infections, but no inhibitor has been approved by the FDA for marketing.\n\nThe screening results (Table 1 and Anti-viral drug ribavirin was predicted to bind to PLpro with low binding energy (Scores=-38.58). From generated docking model, ribavirin was bound in the active site of the enzyme as reported SARS-PLpro inhibitors (PDB code 3e9s). Hydrogen bonds were predicted between Gly164, Gln270, Tyr274, Asp303 and the compound. Also, \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking was found between Tyr265 and triazolering in the compound ( Fig. 4A and B). The strong hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction between ribavirin with the enzyme imply it may be a potent PLpro inhibitor.\n\nThe 3CLpro, also known as Nsp5, is first automatically cleaved from poly-proteins to produce mature enzymes, and then further cleaves downstream Nsps at 11 sites to release Nsp4-Nsp16 31 . 3CLpro directly mediates the maturation of Nsps, which is essential in the life cycle of the virus. The detailed investigation on the structure and catalytic mechanism of 3CLpro makes 3CLpro an attractive target for anti-coronavirus drug development. Inhibitors targeting at SARS-CoV 3CLpro mainly include peptide inhibitors and small-molecule inhibitors [32] .\n\n3CLpro monomer has three domains, domain I (residues 8-101), domain II (residues 102-184) and\n\ndomain III (residues 201-303), and a long loop (residues 185-200) connects domains II and III. The active site of 3CLpro is located in the gap between domains I and II, and has a CysHis catalytic dyad (Cys145 and His41) 33 . As shown in Table 3 and Supporting excel file 3CLpro.xlsx), anti-bacterial drugs (lymecycline, demeclocycline, doxycycline and oxytetracycline), anti-hypertensive drugs (nicardipine and telmisartan), and conivaptan treating hyponatremia show highest binding affinity to 3CLpro. Several natural compounds and derivatives with anti-virus and anti-inflammatory effects also exhibited high binding affinity to 3CLpro (Table   4 and Supporting excel file 3CLpro_NP.xlsx), including a series of andrographolide derivatives (chrysin-7-O-\u03b2-glucuronide from Scutellaria baicalensis, betulonal from Cassine xylocarpa, 2\u03b2-hydroxy-3,4-seco-friedelolactone-27-oic acid, isodecortinol and cerevisterol from Viola diffusa, hesperidin and neohesperidin from Citrus aurantium, kouitchenside I and deacetylcentapicrin from the plants of Swertia genus. The above results suggest that these small-molecule compounds might be the potential 3CLpro\n\ninhibitors and could probably be used for treating SARS-CoV-2.\n\nIt's worth mentioning, anti-asthmatic drug montelukast also showed low binding energy to 3CLpro. As shown in Fig. 5A , montelukast was well fitted into the active pocket of 3CLpro, in which lots of hydrophobic amino acids, just like Thr24, Leu27, His41, Phe140, Cys145, His163, Met165, Pro168 and His172 compose a relatively hydrophobic environment to contain the compound and stabilize its conformation. Hydrogen bonding was predicted between Asn142 and the carbonyl group of the compound (Fig. 5B ). DNA and RNA along the 5\u2032-3\u2032 direction in an NTP-dependent manner 37 . Importantly, it has been reported that the SARS-Nsp13 sequence is conserved and indispensable, and is a necessary component for the replication of coronavirus. Therefore, it has been identified as a target for anti-viral drug discovery, but there are few reports about Nsp13 inhibitors 38, 39 .\n\nBased on structure modeling of helicase protein, anti-bacterial drugs (lymecycline, cefsulodine and rolitetracycline), anti-fungal drug itraconazole, anti-human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) drug saquinavir, anti-coagulant drug dabigatran, and diuretic drug canrenoic acid were predicted to be helicase inhibitors with high mfScores through virtual ligand screening. The natural products, such as many flavanoids from different sources (\u03b1-glucosyl hesperidin, hesperidin, rutin, quercetagetin 6-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside and homovitexin), showed high binding affinity to this target.\n\nBesides the above targets, some non-structural proteins, including Nsp3b, Nsp3e, Nsp7_Nsp8 complex, Nsp9, Nsp10, Nsp14, Nsp15, and Nsp16, also play an important role in the virus RNA synthesis and replication, suggesting these proteins may be useful targets for the anti-viral drug discovery. The virtual screening results showed many anti-bacterial, anti-viral, or anti-inflammatory drugs from ZINC drug database and our in-house natural products/derivatives database displayed potential good affinity to these targets, and the detailed information of virtual screening results is shown in Supporting excel files (for ZDD screening results, file names as target.xlsx; for natural products screening results, file names as target_NP.xlsx).\n\nSpike is the main structural protein of coronavirus and assembles into a special corolla structure on the surface of the virus as a trimer. Spike is a main protein that interacts with the host by binding to host cell receptors to mediate virus invasion and determine viral tissue or host tropism 40 . Spike is cleaved into S1 and S2 by the host cell protease like TMPRSS2, etc. The main function of S1 is to bind with host cell surface receptors, and the However, most of above compounds were not predicted to bind with the binding interface of the Spike-ACE2 complex. The only compound that could target the binding interface between Spike and ACE2 was hesperidin, as shown in Fig. 6A . Hesperidin was predicted to lie on the middle shallow pit of the surface of RBD of Spike, where the dihydroflavone part of the compound went parallel with the \u03b2-6 sheet of RBD.\n\nAnd the sugar part was inserted into the shallow pit in the direction away from ACE2, where a few hydrophobic amino acids, including Tyr436, Try440, Leu442, Phe443, Phe476, Try475, Try481 and Tyr49 form a relatively hydrophobic shallow pocket to contain the compound (Fig. 6B) . Hydrogen bonding was predicted between Tyr440 and the compound. By superimposing the ACE2-RBD complex to the hesperidin-RBD complex, a distinct overlap of hesperidin with the interface of ACE2 could be observed (Fig.   6C ), suggesting hesperidin may disrupt the interaction of ACE2 with RBD.\n\nExcept for Spike protein, E protein (E-channel) possesses important biological functions for the structural integrity of coronavirus and host virulence. NRBD and CRBD of coronavirus N protein are needed for N proteins in host cells to bind with coronavirus RNA efficiently. Therefore, E protein or N protein (NRBD and CRBD domains) can be used as targets for the discovery of anti-viral drugs. Through virtual screening, many anti-bacterial, anti-viral, anti-tumor, anti-asthmatic, and anti-inflammatory drugs, etc. from ZINC database and our in-house natural products/derivatives database were found to display relatively good affinity to these targets. And the detailed results of virtual screening are given in Supplementary excel files.\n\nThere are three coronavirus virulence factors Nsp1, Nsp3c and ORF7a related to interfering host's innate immunity and assisting coronavirus immune escape. Nsp1 interacts with host 40S ribosomal subunit that induces specifically host mRNA degradation 42 and also inhibits type-I interferon production 43 . Nsp3c has ability to bind with host's ADP-ribose to help coronavirus resist host innate immunity 44 . Bone marrow matrix antigen 2 (BST-2) can inhibit the release of newly-assembled coronavirus from host cells. SARS-CoV ORF7a directly binds to BST-2 and inhibits its activity by blocking the glycosylation of BST-2 45 . These evidences suggest that Nsp1, Nsp3c and ORF7a may be potential targets for anti-viral drug discovery.\n\nThe detailed screening results of Nsp1, Nsp3c, and ORF7a showed that a series of clinical drugs and natural products with anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory effects exhibited relatively high binding affinity to these three target proteins, such as piperacillin, cefpiramide, streptomycin, lymecycline, tetracycline, platycodin D from Platycodon grandifloras, wogonoside from Scutellaria baicalensis, vitexin from Vitex negundo, andrographolide derivatives, and xanthones from Swertia genus. The detailed results of virtual screening are shown in Supporting excel files.\n\nThe host ACE2 has been proved by many studies to be the specific receptor for the Spike RBD of SARS-CoV 12 . The latest research shows that the host receptor of SARS-CoV-2 is consistent with SARS-CoV, exhibiting that the Spike RBD sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV RBD and there are important interactions between several key amino acid residues of RBD receptor-binding motif and ACE2 24 .\n\nBased on the current research progress, ACE2 is considered as a host target for the treatment of coronavirus infection to block SARS-CoV-2 from entering host cells.\n\nBased on the virtual screening results of ACE2 protein, anti-diabetes drug troglitazone, anti-hypertensive drug losartan, analgesia drug ergotamine, anti-bacterial drug cefmenoxime, and hepatoprotective drug silybin, etc., were predicted to bind with ACE2 with low energy. The natural products, such as phyllaemblicin G7\n\nfrom Phyllanthus emblica, xanthones from the plants of Swertiagenus, neohesperidin and hesperidin from Citrus aurantium, exhibited potentially high binding affinity to ACE2 protein. However, none of above ACE2\n\nbinding compounds was predicted to target the ACE2-RBD interface.\n\nIn addition, TMPRSS2 was known to cut the Spike to trigger the infection of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Studies have shown that inhibiting the enzyme activity of TMPRSS2 can prevent some coronaviruses from entering host cells 46 . As a possible target for anti-viral drug discovery, the virtual screen results (shown in Supporting excel files) predicted many anti-bacterial drugs (pivampicillin, hetacillin, cefoperazone and clindamycin) and anti-virus natural compounds (phyllaemblicin G7, neoandrographolide, kouitchenside I), etc. to be potential TMPRSS2 inhibitors.\n\nIn order to further verify the screening results of ZINC drug database and utilize the current resource of anti-viral drugs immediately, we constructed a database of 78 anti-viral drugs for deep calculation, including compounds already on the market and currently undergoing clinical trials to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections.\n\nThe RdRp inhibitor GPC-N114 49 .The binding pocket of remdesivir was in the bottom of the RNA template channel, which position was for the acceptor template nucleotide ( Fig. 7A and B) . The compound was well fitted with the shape of the pocket, where it formed three hydrogen bonds with Asn497, Arg569 and Asp684.\n\nIn addition, hydrophobic interactions with Leu576, Ala685 and Tyr687 may further direct the favorite conformation of remdesivir (Fig. 7C) .\n\nInterestingly, remdesivir was predicted to bind with the target TMPRSS2 with low binding energy for both score and mfScore. As shown in Fig. 8A , remdesivir was bound in a relatively positively-charged allosteric pocket which is far away from the enzyme active center. Asn84 and Arg405 formed two hydrogen bonds with the phosphate groups of the compound. Weak hydrophobic interaction between the pyrrolotriazine ring of remdesivir with Tyr131 and Try401, and side chains of some polar amino acids may further stabilize the compound conformation (Fig. 8B) . We also performed the longitudinal analysis on the drugs against 21 targets, and the results showed that only tenofovir, disoproxil, fumarate, and beclabuvir may bind to Nsp1. Fewer compounds were predicted to act on some targets, such as Nsp1, Nsp3e, Nsp9, Nsp10, Nsp16, NRBD, CRBD, ORF7a, and TMPRSS2,\n\nshowing that these selected anti-viral drugs are unlikely to acting on the above targets of the new coronavirus, which provides a meaningful reference for our future research.\n\nFor other targets, such as Nsp3b, Nsp3c, Nsp7_Nsp8 complex, Nsp14, Nsp15, PLpro, 3CLpro, RdRp,\n\nhelicase, E-channel, Spike and ACE2, more anti-viral drugs were predicted to bind with them, especially E-channel, RdRp, 3CLpro and PLpro, indicating that these targets are more likely to be useful for the discovery of SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic drugs from known anti-virals, and should be the focus of our subsequent research.\n\nThe ongoing SARS-CoV-2 epidemic makes us painfully realize that our current For those targets which are difficult to find direct inhibitors, or non-druggable targets, just like Nsp1, Nsp3b, Nsp3c, and E-channel, etc., currently popular PROTAC technology may be a good strategy to degrade these proteins and then inhibit the virus. The potential binding compounds found in this study for these targets might be a good start point.\n\nFor Spike protein, we found only one compound, natural hesperidin was targeting the binding between Spike RBD and human ACE2. However, not like the ACE2 binding compounds, non-interface binding compound may still meaningful applications, considering that the fusion of CoVs membrane with host cell membrane need the big conformational change of remained Spike part after RBD removal 55 . Any small molecule bound to Spike at this time may interfere the re-folding of Spike therefore inhibits the viral infection process. Furthermore, small molecule that can target any part of Spike protein may be a good start point to design PROTAC based therapy.\n\nAlso, we dock existing anti-viral drugs with our targets, analyze the possible targets of each anti-viral drug horizontally, and analyze the drugs that may interact with 21 targets vertically. We analyzed 21 targets based on the docking results and found that Nsp3b, Nsp3c, Nsp7_Nsp8 complex, Nsp14, Nsp15, PLpro, 3CLpro, RdRp, helicase, E-channel, Spike and ACE2 are more likely to be therapeutic targets of anti-viral drugs. The three targets Nsp3b, Nsp3c, and E-channel are screened more anti-viral drugs. This may be due to the model problem because of flexible small protein (Nsp3b and Nsp3c) or partial model (E-channel).\n\nWhether the screened anti-viral drugs really work on these targets needs further verification. We also do not recommend the application of new coronavirus pneumonia to compounds for which no target has been predicted.\n\nThe triphosphate nucleotide product of remdesivir, remdesivir-TP, competes with RdRp for substrate ATP, so it can interfere with viral RNA synthesis. Our docking results show that remdesivir-TP binds to SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, with a score of -112.8, and the docking results are consistent with its original anti-viral mechanism, so we think remdesivir may be good in treating SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. In addition, remdesivir also predicted to bind with the human TMPRSS2, a protein facilitating the virus infection, this is a new discovery and provides ideas for subsequent research.\n\nChloroquine phosphate has shown better anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects in recent studies, but this drug has no clear target of action. In our docking results, chloroquine phosphate is predicted to possibly combine with\n\nNsp3b and E-channel. But we need to do further experiments to verify this conclusion.\n\nIn "}
