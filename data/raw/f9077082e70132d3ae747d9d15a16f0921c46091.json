{"title": "Pneumonia Key Points", "body": "Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is one of the most common infections in children and is the leading cause of mortality in children worldwide. Acute respiratory illnesses are responsible for more than 5 million fatalities each year in children less than 5 years of age in developing countries. The annual incidence in children less than age 5 is approximately 35 to 40 cases per 1000 in Europe and North America. 1 The mortality rate from pneumonia in children in the United States has declined by 97% from 1939 to 1996. 2 This decline is primarily attributable to the introduction of penicillin in the 1940s. Availability of the measles vaccine and improved access to medical care for poor children, primarily as a result of the Medicaid program, have contributed to further reduction in mortality rates recorded from 1963 to 1985. The rate of pneumonia remains high in developing countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported a global annual incidence of clinical pneumonia in children less than 5 years of age estimated to be 146.5 million new cases in developing countries and 2.1 million new cases in developed countries. 3 The defi nition of clinical pneumonia for the purpose of the WHO estimates encompasses pneumonia, bronchiolitis, and reactive airways disease associated with respiratory infections. 456\n\nChapter 58 infl uenza viruses A and B, RSV, parainfl uenza viruses 1 through 3, and adenovirus. 7 While S. pneumoniae remains the most common bacterial cause for pneumonia in children, atypical infections are emerging as a common respiratory pathogen, particularly in adolescents. 8 In developing countries, aspiration from the upper respiratory tract accounts for nonserotypable H. infl uenzae as a cause of pneumonia in children. 9 Published data reveal the limitations of diagnostic testing in pneumonia, with nearly 30% to 40% of cases unidentifi ed. To aid management decisions, common patterns of infectious agents exist that help to guide diagnosis and therapy. Age is the most helpful marker for the cause of pediatric pneumonia. When considering age as a factor, S. pneumoniae remains the most common agent for all ages, and is reported as a causative agent in 15% to 35% of all childhood pneumonias. The atypical agents M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae are less common in children less than 5 years of age (<10%) and occur in increasing proportions in adolescents, reported as high as 50% in some studies. Viral etiologies, most commonly RSV, adenovirus, and infl uenza viruses A and B, are most common in infants and children less than 2 years of age (30%). The incidence of viral infection reduces dramatically with age. 1,4, 10 Other factors that aid in identifying the etiology of pneumonia include season and vaccine status. Viral infections, specifi cally RSV and infl uenza virus, peak in late fall and winter, though there is little seasonal infl uence on bacterial causes. Immunization status is also a helpful indicator of disease potential. Infl uenza infection is less likely if a child has received the infl uenza vaccine during the same season. Haemophilus infl uenzae type B vaccination eliminates the potential for this infection in children. The conjugated pneumococcal vaccine imparts partial protection from this pathogen as the causative agent. 4,10\n\nChildren with pneumonia present with a variety of clinical fi ndings. Early fi ndings are varied, and most cases present initially with symptoms of an upper respiratory infection. These may include low-grade fevers and rhinorrhea. Intermediate and late fi ndings include fever, tachypnea, and cough. Several studies have sought to identify pneumonia based solely on clinical fi ndings. These studies defi ne the \"gold standard\" for pneumonia diagnosis as the chest radiograph. 11,12 Tachypnea was defi ned based on the WHO defi nition, as follows: in children less than 2 months old, respiratory rate (RR) greater than 60 breaths/min; in children 2 to 12 months old, RR greater than 50 breaths/min; and children older than 12 months, RR greater than 40 breaths/min. 13, 14 In 1997, a Canadian task force developed an evidence-based guideline to diagnose pneumonia in children. This guideline states that, although no single clinical fi nding may accurately diagnose pneumonia, the absence of a cluster of signs, specifi cally respiratory distress, tachypnea, crackles, and decreased breath sounds, excludes the presence of pneumonia with a sensitivity of 100%. 1 These fi ndings were applied to a cohort of 319 children who had a chest radiograph for possible pneumonia, 20% of whom had radiologic fi ndings consistent with pneumonia. The Canadian guideline had a 45% sensitivity and 66% specifi city for the diagnosis of pneumonia when applied to this patient cohort. Additionally, tachypnea was only 10% sensitive and 5% specifi c in this study. 15 Despite these fi ndings, several other studies have identifi ed tachypnea as the best clinical indicator. A report on 572 children less than 2 years old, 7% with radiologic signs of pneumonia, defi ned tachypnea as having a 74% sensitivity and 76% specifi city to identify pneumonia. 16 In a trial comparing clinical data to chest radiographs in 110 children, of 59 patients diagnosed with pneumonia, 35 had positive fi ndings on chest radiograph. Of all clinical fi ndings, the sensitivity to diagnose pneumonia was best for tachypnea (74%; specifi city 67%), followed by retractions (71%) and rales (46%). Combinations of these improved specifi city slightly, but did not improve sensitivity to recognize pneumonia. When the cohort was stratifi ed by age, tachypnea was most sensitive: 83% in the youngest infants (<6 months old). 17 In a prospective study examining RR cutoffs for pediatric patients hospitalized with pneumonia, a RR greater than 57 in infants 2 to 11 months old, a RR greater than 48 in children 1 to 5 years old, and a RR greater than 36 in children more than 5 years old identifi ed severe pneumonia requiring hospitalization. 18 These fi ndings closely parallel the WHO defi nitions for tachypnea.\n\nA prospective study of 570 children ages 1 to 16 years identifi ed the following risk factors to be statistically significant in predicting pneumonia: history of fever, decreased breath sounds, crackles, retractions, grunting, fever, and tachypnea. A multivariate prediction model including fever, decreased breath sounds, crackles, and tachypnea had a sensitivity of 98%, but only an 8% specifi city. Of note, fever and tachypnea alone were 93% sensitive for identifying pneumonia in this study. 19 This highlights the diffi culty in predicting pneumonia based solely on clinical evaluation, though fever and tachypnea seem to strongly suggest the potential for lower respiratory infection and warrant further evaluation.\n\nPulse oximetry has also been examined as a predictor of pneumonia in children. Of 803 children less than 2 years of age who had a chest radiograph performed for respiratory symptoms, 80 (11%) had an opacity suggesting pneumonia. Mean pulse oximetry was not predictive of pneumonia in this cohort. 20 The addition of laboratory studies to aid diagnosis has been evaluated in several ways. A study of 154 hospitalized children with CAP, of whom 79% had an identifi able etiology, compared etiologies of pneumonia with respect to clinical and laboratory fi ndings. This analysis revealed that wheezing was most commonly seen in patients with either a viral or an atypical bacterial etiology (41%) compared to patients who had a bacterial etiology (14%). Laboratory studies showed that bacterial etiologies were more likely to be associated with bandemia and elevated serum procalcitonin compared to viral or atypical causes. A multivariate logistic analysis of all variables identifi ed two predictors of bacterial pneumonia: elevated temperature (>38.4\u00b0 C) less than 72 hours after admission and presence of a pleural effusion, with a sensitivity of 79% and specifi city of 59%. 7 Of 1248 febrile infants less than 60 days of age, three simple variables-rales, RR greater than 60 breaths/min, and absolute band count less than 1500/mm 3 -identifi ed 85% of infants with lobar pneumonia (85% sensitivity and 59% specifi city). 21 It has been reported that, in a cohort of febrile children, leukocytosis as a sole diagnostic fi nding may indicate pneumonia, despite a lack of supportive clinical fi ndings. A prospective cohort study of 278 febrile (temperature > 39.0\u00b0 C) children less than 5 years of age with a white blood count (WBC) greater than 20,000/mm 3 identifi ed a lobar infi ltrate in 26% of patients (36 of 146) who had a radiograph performed and no signs of pneumonia. 22 \n\nDifferentiating bacterial and viral causes of pediatric pneumonia remains a challenge to the emergency physician. Since treatment guidelines may be directly infl uenced by microbiologic causes, identifying bacterial pneumonia is an important goal. As already mentioned, the most helpful differentiating epidemiologic factor is age, since viral causes are more likely in children less than age 2 years; however, there is much overlap. The only clinical fi nding that correlates with viral infection is wheezing, yet specifi city is low. 7 Laboratory evaluation has been used as an adjunct to help differentiate the cause of pneumonia. Serum procalcitonin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were measured in 126 children hospitalized for pneumonia. Children with bacterial pneumonia had higher serum procalcitonin and CRP concentrations than children with viral infections, though the specifi city was low. If all three markers were elevated, the specifi city for bacterial pneumonia was greater than 80%. 23 In a similar study, procalcitonin was found to be more sensitive and specifi c than CRP, IL-6, or WBC count for differentiating bacterial and viral causes of pneumonia in hospitalized children. 24 Despite these studies, procalcitonin has not become a widely used test in the evaluation of a child with pneumonia.\n\nRadiographs have not been traditionally thought to be helpful in distinguishing viral from bacterial pneumonia, though alveolar infi ltrates are suggestive of a bacterial etiology. [25] [26] [27] A systematic literature review of fi ve studies examined this relationship and reported a low sensitivity and specifi city of chest radiography in the identifi cation of a bacterial etiology. 28 These studies are limited since there is no reliable reference standard. As mentioned previously, identifying the microbiologic etiology of childhood pneumonia is diffi cult, and therefore it is problematic to assess the diagnostic capability of a radiograph related to the microbiologic etiology; as a result, the test accuracy estimate of the radiograph may be falsely low. 28 A prospective report examined the infl uence of laboratory tests, specifi cally the WBC count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and serum CRP, in combination with the radiograph to aid in diagnostic capability. 29 In 254 children admitted to the hospital with pneumonia, a bacterial etiology was identifi ed in 53%. Of these, 72% had an alveolar infi ltrate (most commonly lobar) compared to 49% of patients with a viral infection. There was no difference between etiologies in patients with an interstitial infi ltrate; 50% identifi ed a bacterial etiology. Though there remains a fair amount of overlap, this study supports the fi nding that a lobar alveolar pattern is more likely to represent a bacterial etiology while an interstitial pattern does not differentiate between viral and bacterial infections. An elevated CRP (>80 mg/dl) suggested a bacterial cause (72% sensitivity and 52%specifi city); however, laboratory fi ndings did not signifi cantly enhance the sensitivity of the radiograph in identifying a cause for pneumonia. 29 Radiographic fi ndings of focal consolidation suggest a bacterial etiology for pneumonia, although an atypical pneumonia (Mycoplasma) may also be represented, illustrating the lack of specifi city to differentiate cause by radiograph fi ndings alone. This overlap is exemplifi ed when looking at a diffuse interstitial pattern. Given the proper clinical setting, atelectasis due to reactive airways disease may be indistinguishable from a viral or atypical process manifesting as a diffuse interstitial pattern. A unique fi nding that strongly supports a bacterial etiology is a \"round pneumonia,\" which appears as a circular lesion in the retrocardiac area. A round pneumonia is most commonly caused by S. pneumoniae in children. Other possible infections include H. infl uenzae, M. tuberculosis, and Klebsiella. In the case of occult pneumonia in febrile children with leukocytosis, 22 round pneumonia is often discovered, despite few clinical respiratory fi ndings.\n\nIn an effort to reduce radiation exposure and cost, the utility of the lateral chest radiograph was recently examined. In a review of 1268 children who had a chest radiograph, 19% with pneumonia, radiologists found the frontal view alone to have a sensitivity of 85% and specifi city of 98% to diagnose pneumonia. 30 Pediatric emergency physicians found no difference in the sensitivity or specifi city for identifying pneumonia on radiograph with or without the lateral view (91% vs. 87% sensitivity and 58% vs. 57% specifi city, respectively). 31 The lateral view adds little diagnostic information for patients with lobar infi ltrates; however, it may aid in diagnosing pneumonia in a small number of patients with a nonlobar infi ltrate seen on the frontal view.\n\nA systematic review identifi ed a single trial examining the utility of the chest radiograph in diagnosing pneumonia in children. In 522 ambulatory children less than 5 years of age with a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia, there was no difference in outcome (time to recovery) when comparing children who had and did not have a chest radiograph performed. 32, 33 Children who had a chest radiograph performed were more likely to receive antibiotic therapy and to be admitted to the hospital. When considering cost, inconvenience, and potential adverse effects associated with the chest radiograph, routine use of the chest radiograph in a child with suspected pneumonia is discouraged if the clinical presentation and management issues are straightforward.\n\nWhile there are no reported studies examining clinical signs and symptoms of pneumonia and a negative chest radiograph in children, there is one report in the adult literature. A cohort of 2706 patients with clinically suspected CAP found only 1795 (66%) with radiographic confi rmation of disease. Of the 34% of patients with a normal radiograph, only 7% developed a consolidation within 72 hours of presentation. There were no differences in pulmonary symptoms, laboratory testing, or mortality risk. The patients with a confi rmed consolidation were more likely to have S. pneumoniae bacteremia (64%) compared to 14% of patients with no consolidation. Of patients with a consolidation, 92% of these were in the lower lobe and 25% also had a pleural effusion. 34 In children, the presence of tachypnea, rales, and fever suggests pneumonia, regardless of radiographic fi ndings, but there are no well-established studies to support a diagnosis of clinical pneumonia in children. Management options may be based on clinical severity and reliability of the patient for follow-up. If a patient is only mildly ill and will reliably follow up, no antibiotic therapy is recommended. At follow-up, a repeat radiograph may be performed or antibiotic treatment initiated if clinically indicated. If at the initial visit the patient is moderate to severely ill and/or follow-up is not guaranteed, then appropriate antibiotic therapy may be initiated based on the age of the patient and pattern of infection.\n\nThe most common impersonator of pneumonia in children is atelectasis associated with reactive airways disease, asthma, and/or bronchiolitis. Fever or markers of infl ammation do not help to differentiate pneumonia, since patients with reactive airways disease may have fever and/or infl ammation due to atelectasis or upper respiratory tract infection. As reported previously, wheezing is unlikely in patients with typical bacterial infections; however, atypical causes such as M. pneumoniae or C. pneumoniae should be considered. Foreign bodies may also mimic pneumonia; however, a high suspicion for aspiration or history of choking, unilateral hyperaeration, or asymmetric breath sounds may suggest the need for further investigation. 35 The risk of bacteremia remains a consideration in children with pneumonia. In 86 patients with fi ndings suggestive of a bacterial process (temperature > 40\u00b0 C, lobar infi ltrate on chest radiograph, WBC count > 20,000/mm 3 or absolute band count > 2000/mm 3 , ill appearance, tachypnea, tachycardia, or otitis media), only 1 had a bacterial pathogen (H. infl uenzae) isolated by blood culture. 36 These fi ndings are supported in additional studies with similarly low rates of bacteremia in pediatric patients with pneumonia. These studies support the lack of utility of blood cultures in patients with pneumonia, and suggest that they be reserved for the child who is toxic and/or ill appearing, is immunocompromised, has an underlying illness, or has not responded to conventional therapy.\n\nThe most common complications of pneumonia in children include necrosis, empyema, parapneumonic effusion, and lung abscess. A multicenter, retrospective study involving eight children's hospitals in the United States examined 368 hospitalized children with pneumococcal pneumonia. Of these, 133 were complicated cases and required thoracostomy drainage. The frequency of complicated cases increased during the study period from 23% in 1994 to 53% in 1999. Patients with complicated pneumonia were older (mean age 45 vs. 27 months) and more likely to be of white race and to present with chest pain. Ninety-eight percent of all patients recovered completely from the pneumonia. Antibiotic resistance was not more prevalent in the complicated patients; however, pneumococcal serotype 1 was responsible for 24% of the complicated cases and only 4% of the noncomplicated cases. 37 Pneumococcal serotype 1 is not included in the heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, and therefore the vaccine may have a smaller impact upon the incidence of complicated pneumonia than anticipated. The issue of serotype surveillance, particularly in complicated pneumonia, remains an important component of future preventive measures.\n\nThe British Thoracic Society has published an evidencebased guideline for treatment of childhood pneumonia. 38, 39 Their consensus confi rms a lack of good supporting evidence for management decisions. Treatment studies have small patient numbers, high recovery rates for both therapy modal-ities, and do not examine harm. Furthermore, the strategy to study nontreatment of a child with pneumonia is challenging.\n\nCurrently, the treatment of a child with CAP is based upon the clinical presentation and the presumed etiologic agent. Since identifi cation of the etiologic agent remains diffi cult, antibiotic therapy is empirical in most cases and certainly most often in the emergency department. The reported use of antibiotics ranges from 10% to 45% to treat undifferentiated lower respiratory tract infections despite a likely viral etiology. [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] The issue of overuse of antibiotics is concerning, and antibiotic resistance continues to rise. Observation and close follow-up without antibiotic treatment is strongly recommended in children with a presumed viral etiology or who are relatively well appearing with only mild respiratory symptoms, as long as there is reliable follow-up.\n\nIn children who are moderately ill and/or have a presumed bacterial source of infection, antibiotics may be initiated. Since the causative pathogen is rarely known, and radiologic features do not distinguish etiology, the choice of antibiotics is based on established patterns of infection related to age and clinical fi ndings. Several studies have found little difference in outcome when comparing different treatment modalities. One study of 88 children less than 5 years of age with pneumonia compared treatment with azithromycin and amoxicillin-clavulanate and found no difference in effectiveness. The same study compared treatment with azithromycin to erythromycin estolate in 59 children older than 5 years with pneumonia and also found no difference in outcome. Four children failed treatment, but there was no difference in failure rates among the different antibiotic regimens. Adverse events were recorded in 67% of patients who received amoxicillinclavulanate, 25% who received erythromycin, and in 14% who received azithromycin. The most common adverse events were diarrhea and rash. 5 Another study supports the use of azithromycin for pediatric bacterial pneumonia, both classic and atypical patterns. 45 Oral azithromycin is found to be well tolerated with very few treatment-related adverse events. 46, 47 The choice of an antibiotic regimen is guided by age, severity of illness, and likelihood of a bacterial pathogen (Table  58-1) . 1,5,37,39,48,49 Parenteral therapy is indicated for children who require hospitalization and who are unable to tolerate oral medication. In these cases, ampicillin or a secondgeneration cephalosporin (e.g., cefuroxime) is recommended. In hospitalized children 5 years and older, the addition of an oral macrolide is recommended. Replacement by an appropriate oral agent may be initiated after 2 to 4 days of clinical improvement, with resolution of fever and the ability to tolerate oral medication. 1 Since empirical antibiotic therapy is so commonly initiated, the role for extensive microbiologic testing is of questionable value. In a prospective study of 153 hospitalized children with acquired pneumonia, only 9% had fever lasting more than 48 hours after onset of antibiotic treatment. Of these, most had RSV and H. infl uenzae infection, with more than half identifi ed as mixed viral-bacterial etiologies. At follow-up, 94% of all patients showed no pneumonia-related symptoms. There is no role for expensive microbiologic testing in otherwise healthy children with CAP since most make a rapid, uneventful recovery after a brief hospital stay and short course of antibiotics, regardless of etiology. 50 The heptavalent pneumococcal vaccine was introduced in 2000, and showed 97% effectiveness in reducing invasive pneumococcal disease in children less than 5 years of age based on results from the Kaiser Permanente effectiveness trial of over 36,000 children. 51 Utilizing the same patient database, the overall incidence of positive radiographic pneumococcal pneumonia in children was reported to be reduced by 18% in immunized children, with a 32% reduction in children less than 1 year of age and a 23% reduction in children less than 2 years of age. There was no difference in children older than 2 years of age. 52 Children with the following clinical signs and symptoms should be considered for hospital admission regardless of the decision to initiate antibiotic therapy as they may require more intensive monitoring 1 : age less than 6 months, toxic appearance, severe respiratory distress, need for supplemental oxygen, dehydration, vomiting, no response to appropriate oral antimicrobial therapy, immunocompromised status, noncompliant caregiver, and presence of bilobar pneumonia.\n\nDespite how commonly it occurs, childhood pneumonia continues to challenge the practitioner. Diagnostic testing and identifi cation of the causative agent are limited. Routine blood tests and/or cultures are not recommended since they provide little information. Radiologic testing does not differentiate between viral and bacterial causes of pneumonia. A clinical diagnostic approach is applied for most patients, with tachypnea as the most reliable predictor of pneumonia. Wheezing suggests an atypical or viral etiology. Empirical therapy is discouraged for mildly ill children with pneumonia due to the concern for antibiotic resistance. Antimicrobial therapy is recommended for children in whom a bacterial etiology is strongly suspected or who are moderately to severely ill. "}
