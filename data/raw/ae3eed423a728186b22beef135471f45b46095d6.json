{"title": "Highly Sensitive Assay for Measurement of Arenavirus-cell Attachment", "body": "Arenaviruses are a family of enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses that are maintained primarily in rodents in nature [1] [2] [3] . While these viruses typically establish an asymptomatic, persistent infection in rodent reservoirs 1, 2 , they can cause severe disease in humans 3 . Important pathogenic species include the New World Junin virus (JUNV) 4 and the Old World Lassa virus 5 , which are the etiologic agents of Argentine hemorrhagic fever in South America and Lassa fever in Africa, respectively. Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), the prototypic virus of the family 6 , has a worldwide distribution and is responsible for a variety of disease states including aseptic meningitis in immunocompetent individuals 6 , severe birth defects in the developing fetus 7 , or high lethality in immunosuppressed individuals following solid-organ transplantation 8, 9 . The lack of United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved vaccines or effective antivirals to combat these viruses highlights the critical need to develop novel strategies to therapeutically target these emerging/re-emerging pathogens.\n\nThe arenavirus genome consists of two single-stranded RNA segments, the large (L) (~7.2 kb) and small (S) (~3.6 kb) segments 10 . The S segment encodes the viral nucleoprotein (NP) and envelope glycoprotein (GP) while the L segment encodes the viral polymerase (L) and matrix protein (Z). The L and S genomic RNA segments (vRNAs) are packaged into virions [10] [11] [12] . The initial step of arenavirus infection is attachment of viral particles to host cells through an interaction between the viral GP and its corresponding host cell receptors which, for JUNV, includes the human transferrin receptor 1 (hTfR1) 13, 14 . Following attachment, JUNV particles are taken into the cell via clathrin-mediated endocytosis 15 .\n\nParticles then traffic to the late endosome where the low pH of this compartment triggers the activation of GP 16, 17 . Once activated, the GPencoded fusion peptide inserts into the endosomal membrane, initiating fusion between the viral and endosomal membranes. Successful fusion results in the release of the virion-packaged vRNAs into the cytoplasm, where they serve as templates for genomic replication and transcription. When sufficient quantities of viral structural proteins and vRNAs are generated, new particles assemble and bud from the infected cell to complete the life cycle 18 .\n\nTo facilitate the discovery of new strategies to therapeutically target the pathogenic arenaviruses, our group has focused on the identification of host factors that are critical for virus propagation, but dispensable for the host. In this context, defining the precise stage(s) of the viral life cycle controlled by such host factors is necessary to guide the development of antiviral strategies. Herein, we describe a quantitative (q)RT-PCR-based assay that can be used to measure arenavirus-cell attachment for the purpose of identifying whether selected host proteins and/ or antiviral molecules influence this initial stage of viral entry 19 . Alternative approaches to measure arenavirus-cell attachment have featured virions labeled with biotin 20 , fluorescent dyes 21 , or radioactive isotopes 22 . Drawbacks to these methods can include the requirement for large quantities of input virus (e.g. high multiplicities of infection (MOI)), the use of radioactivity, and/or additional handling steps to prepare input virus (e.g. concentration and/or labeling of virus). In particular, the use of high MOI makes it difficult to distinguish productive versus nonproductive attachment events \n\nNote: The virus used in this protocol, JUNV strain Candid #1 (C#1), has been successfully used as a live attenuated vaccine for the prevention of JUNV disease 29 . JUNV C#1 was derived from the virulent JUNV strain XJ through serial passage both in vivo and in vitro and differs from the parental XJ strain by 12 amino acids 30 . Because JUNV C#1 is a biosafety level (BSL)-2-rated pathogen, the work described for this section must be carried out using appropriate BSL-2 practices 31 . This includes the use of personal protective equipment (e.g. eye protection, laboratory coat, double gloves), a class II biosafety cabinet, and ensuring that all personnel have received the institutional training and approvals required to safely handle this organism.\n\n1. Dilute the JUNV C#1 sample(s) to be tested to the desired PFUs or focus forming units in ice-cold complete DMEM and store on ice until ready to add to each well. Note: As an alternative to conducting the binding studies with virus diluted in complete DMEM, use a minimal medium containing PBS with a reduced serum concentration (2%) and an appropriate buffer to establish whether serum may cause interference with virus attachment. Similar attachment protocols for alternative viruses have reported the use of RPMI 1640 medium without bicarbonate containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 10 mM (2-(morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid), and 10 mM HEPES, pH 6.8 32 . This binding media may be superior to prevent pH changes that could occur when media is removed from the CO 2 -environment of the incubator.\n\n1. Inoculate wells with PFUs ranging from 200 to 2,000 to limit nonproductive attachment events. As shown in Figure 2 , this assay is capable of detecting attachment using as few as 20 PFU (or as many as 2 x 10 6 PFU).\n\n2. Create a master mix of virus for inoculation onto cells. Each virus sample will be inoculated onto duplicate wells in a volume of 50 \u00b5l per well. Therefore, if the addition of 2,000 PFUs of virus per well is desired, dilute 4,800 PFUs into a total volume of 120 \u00b5l of ice cold complete DMEM. 1. To control for the specificity of the assay, use a matched pair of Chinese hamster ovary cell lines that either do not express TfR1 (TRVb) or express hTfR1 (TRVb-1) as JUNV attachment to these cells should either be reduced or not, respectively 13, 33 . Alternatively, treat cells with a protease such as proteinase K to prevent arenavirus attachment 34 or entry 35 . Soluble hTfR1 or the monocolonal antibody ch128.1, which is specific for hTfR1, could also be considered as they are known to block entry of JUNV into cells 13, 36 . Additionally, pretreatment of cells with free mannose 14 or incubation of particles with JUNV-specific neutralizing antibodies 37 can inhibit virus entry.\n\n2. Please note, however, that these latter reagents and approaches, despite blocking JUNV entry, have not been confirmed to block attachment, although this is a likely explanation. The protocol described here could be used to formally determine whether these various approaches impact virion attachment.\n\n2. Remove plates from the 37 \u00b0C incubator and place either in a 4 \u00b0C refrigerator or on ice for 15 min to inhibit the ability of the plated cells to carry out endocytosis. 3. Next, aspirate the complete DMEM from each well and rapidly wash each well twice using 100 \u00b5l of ice cold PBS (phosphate buffered saline) pH 7.4. Then add 50 \u00b5l of the pre-diluted virus samples (prepared in step 2.1) to the appropriate wells. 4. Wrap the plate in plastic wrap and immediately place either back on ice or in a 4 \u00b0C refrigerator for 1 to 1.5 hr to allow virus attachment to occur. Keep the plate, wash buffer, and virus samples cold at 4 \u00b0C throughout this step. 5. After the completion of the 4 \u00b0C incubation, aspirate the virus inoculum and wash each well 3 times with 200 \u00b5l of ice-cold PBS.\n\n1. Purify viral RNA from JUNV C#1 particles attached to the monolayers by using the commercial kit (e.g., RNeasy Mini kit) according to manufacturer's protocol. Specifically, follow the \"purification of total RNA from animal cells using spin technology protocol\" on pages 23-28 in the RNeasy Mini Handbook (4 th Edition, April 2006) with the modifications listed below.\n\n1. Lyse the cells as directed in step 1B by adding 350 \u00b5l of lysis buffer RLT directly to each well. Mix the buffer several times to ensure cell lysis. Note that cells easily lyse in this buffer and complete lysis can be verified by viewing wells under an inverted microscope. 2. Transfer the resulting cell lysate to the kit column (step 3a) and follow the rest of the protocol as described. At this point, the virus has been neutralized by the lysis buffer so the remaining steps of the protocol can be done outside of the class II biosafety cabinet provided the kit tubes were not contaminated with infectious virus. 3. Include the optional step 9 from the manufacturer's protocol, which is an additional centrifugation of the spin column to eliminate any possible carryover of Buffer RPE. 4. In the final step the manufacturer's protocol (step 10), elute the purified RNA from the spin column using 30 \u00b5l of nuclease-free ddH 2 O.\n\nStore RNA at -80 \u00b0C at this point or use directly in the qRT-PCR assay. To prevent degradation of purified viral RNA samples by nucleases, use nuclease-free reagents and equipment and keep thawed RNA samples on ice. Note: Buffers RLT and RW1 contain guanidine salt and should not be mixed with bleach. Buffer RW1 contains ethanol. 5. To establish a standard curve using a newly purified sample of plasmid containing the qPCR target sequence, first determine the plasmid copy number in this solution. \u00b5l of water, then 6.9 x 10 -5 g of plasmid * 1 mole/4.2 x 10 6 g of plasmid = 1.6 x 10 -11 moles of plasmid), which can be converted to copy number (e.g. 1.6 x 10 -11 moles of plasmid * 6.022 x 10 23 molecules/mole = 9.8 x 10 12 molecules (or copies)).\n\n5. Divide the total copies of plasmid in the plasmid solution by the volume of that solution to get copies per \u00b5l (e.g. 9.8 x 10 12 copies/300 \u00b5l = 3.28 x 10 10 copies).\n\n6. Dilute this solution appropriately so that 5 \u00b5l volumes can be loaded onto the PCR plate to deliver the range of copy numbers needed to establish the standard curve.\n\nTo demonstrate the sensitivity and dynamic range of the qPCR assay, known quantities of a plasmid encoding the NP gene of JUNV C#1 (range 5-5 x 10 7 copies) were subjected to qPCR as described in Section 4 of the protocol. The assay is sensitive and can reliably detect as few as 5 copies of the target nucleic acid (Figure 2) . Further, the dynamic range of the assay is large and, as shown in Figure 2 , can cover at least 7 logs of template. While not shown, we have detected as many as 5 x 10 9 copies of nucleic acid.\n\nTo illustrate the utility of the assay for measurement of JUNV C#1 particle attachment, various quantities of JUNV C#1 were prebound to Vero E6 cells as described in the protocol. After washing away unbound particles, cells were lysed for RNA purification and the resulting RNA samples were subjected to qRT-PCR. As shown in Figure 3 , the assay can detect viral attachment events using as few as 20 or as many as 2 x 10 6 PFU, which translates to MOIs of 0.0004 and 40, respectively.\n\nAs shown in Figure 4 , it is possible to modify the protocol to not only measure viral attachment, but also the rate of amplification of the genome contained in the incoming viral particles over time. This modified approach can be used as a surrogate to determine whether further defects in the remaining steps of viral entry (e.g. particle endocytosis and/or fusion and release of viral genome into the cytoplasm) might be occurring. Interestingly, the quantity of viral genome appears to decrease during the first 6 hr following attachment, which suggests that a portion of the incoming viral genome is degraded. This could happen to particles that fail to be taken into the cell and degrade in the extracellular space or perhaps due to degradation within the endolysosomal network. The data shown demonstrates that 12 or 18 hr post-infection would be optimal times to screen for active genome replication. \n\nThe protocol we describe is straightforward and robust provided the following critical considerations are observed. First, strict pre-PCR technique must be employed (see 28 for an excellent review). It is imperative that all reagents and equipment are free of amplified DNA containing the qPCR target sequence and that appropriate controls are in place to detect such contamination. Second, for the virus-cell attachment portion of the protocol, the virus, cells, and media must be kept at 4 \u00b0C to prevent endocytosis of surface-bound virions. Third, the quantity of cells collected for RNA extraction must not exceed the RNA binding capacity of the RNA purification filter. Fourth, purified viral RNA samples must be protected from ribonuclease-mediated degradation through the use of nuclease-free reagents and equipment and by keeping them on ice when thawed. Fifth, the range of the standard curve included in the qPCR assay must be sufficiently large to capture all values observed from the unknown samples. Sixth, technical replicates should be included for both the virus-cell attachment portion of the assay as well as the qPCR of individual RNA samples. Seventh, controls (e.g. cell lines that express hTfR1 or not) can be included to control for the specificity of the assay. Finally, all personnel must have appropriate biosafety training and institutional approval to handle infectious JUNV C#1 or other pathogenic arenaviruses.\n\nThe qPCR portion of the protocol calls for a qPCR probe primarily to ensure the specificity of the product being amplified during each stage of the PCR reaction. The cost of the assay could be reduced, however, by eliminating this qPCR probe in favor of another qPCR chemistry that does not require a probe (e.g. the use of the asymmetrical dye SYBR Green I 25 ) and/or by reducing the volume of the qPCR reaction mixture used. If a probe-independent qPCR approach is used, it would be important to verify that the reaction conditions are stringent enough to ensure specificity of the qPCR primers. It is also important to be aware that arenavirus RNA, whether extracted from cells or virions, can be nonspecifically primed to form cDNA during the RT in the absence of a virus-specific RT primer 12 . Therefore, copy numbers detected using a vRNA-specific RT primer do not strictly reflect just the vRNA species targeted by the RT primer. If specificity for genome or antigenome is required, we have reported a means to circumvent this nonspecific priming phenomenon through the use of biotinylated RT primers and streptavidin beads 12 .\n\nAn important strength of this assay is its extreme sensitivity. Other arenavirus-cell attachment assays featuring radioactively-labeled 22 , biotinylated 20 or fluorescently-labeled 21 particles have required MOIs of 0.2, 100, or 1000, respectively. While the use of radioactively-labeled particles results in good sensitivity, it necessitates the use of radioactivity, which increases the logistical complexity and safety concerns associated with this particular assay. The qPCR-based method described here requires as little as 20 PFU (MOI of ~0.0004 in a 48-well plate) and can reliably detect attachment over a large dynamic range of MOIs (e.g. MOIs from 0.0004 to at least 40) (Figure 3) . The strong sensitivity of this assay makes it possible to use low MOIs for more accurate measurement of productive binding events by standard infectious virus. The high sensitivity also significantly reduces the quantity of virus needed for the assay and, in doing so, limits the additional handling steps that may impact the quality of virions being used in the assay (e.g. polyethylene glycol-based precipitation of virions, labeling virions with fluorophores\n\nThe cell-attachment assay described can be modified to measure additional stages of viral entry including viral particle endocytosis as well as the final step of virus fusion, which is release of viral genome into the cytoplasm. To measure particle endocytosis, the same steps of the attachment protocol would be followed through step 2.5, which is attachment of particles to cells at 4 \u00b0C. Cells would then be warmed to allow viral particles to be endocytosed, followed by treatment with a protease to strip any externally-bound virions that were not endocytosed as described 22, 24 . Sections 3 and 4 of this protocol would then be followed to extract viral RNA and quantitate copies of viral genomic RNA as a measure of endocytosis. To measure genome uncoating following fusion of viral and endosomal membranes, cells would be prebound with virus at 4 \u00b0C, warmed (to permit endocytosis and fusion) and stripped of external particles, and then collected for analysis. In one approach, cells could be lysed in an isotonic buffer to preserve intracellular vesicles, and then split into 2 fractions: one that would be treated with a cocktail of RNases (uncoated viral RNA is susceptible to degradation) and the other that would not 39 . Alternatively, cells could be separated into cytosolic or endosomal fractions 40 . In both cases, qRT-PCR would be used to quantitate viral genome in the cytoplasm as a measure of viral genome uncoating. Last, the qRT-PCR assay can be easily modified to study virus attachment, endocytosis, or fusion for other viruses provided the RT-PCR reagents are tailored to the new virus of interest (for examples see [24] [25] [26] [27] ).\n\nThe authors declare that they have no competing financial interests."}
