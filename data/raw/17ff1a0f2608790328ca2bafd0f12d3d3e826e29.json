{"title": "The effect of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) on emergency airway management \u0b1d", "body": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new infectious disease first described in early 2003. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] It is transmitted by a coronavirus and presents as an atypical pneumonia. The morbidity and mortality associated with SARS is high. From early March 2003 to late May 2003, SARS was detected in Singapore. Two hundred and thirty-eight patients were infected of which 33 died. Ninety-seven (42%) of those infected were health care workers. Five of them died. The whole medical system in the country was put under stress. One major hospital became the designated SARS hospital and stopped receiving other cases. Emergency cases were then diverted to the other remaining public hospitals; the Singapore General Hospital was the main recipient of diverted cases. The increase in workload of critically ill cases, new infection control procedures including mandatory wearing of the powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) and personal protective equipment (PPE), and limiting the number of person-contacts with each patient were thought to affect resuscitation and airway management. Our aim was to study the effects of the wearing of PAPR, PPE and the restriction in the number of resuscitation personnel on airway management during the SARS crisis.\n\nThe Emergency Department has an ongoing airway registry that captured prospectively patient demographics, diagnosis, indications for tracheal intubation, the details of the physician attempting intubation, number of attempts, method of intubation, success rates and complications. Data is collected using a study form and is completed by the intubating physician immediately after the procedure. This project had the approval of the hospital's ethics committee.\n\nFor the purpose of this study, the data was divided into three periods: The data is analysed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software for Windows (version 10.1; SPSS Inc). The Pearson 2 test is used to determine statistically significant differences among categorical data with the Fisher's exact test being used if one or more cells had a value of less than 30. Any comparison of outcome measures with a confidence interval that does not cross one (1.0) indicates that the difference is statistically significant.\n\nThe number of emergency department visits during the pre-SARS, SARS and post-SARS periods were 49,462, 34,844 and 83,596, respectively (Table 1) . There was a significant increase in the proportion of resuscitation cases managed during the SARS period compared to the pre-SARS period (OR 1.434, CI 1.357, 1.514) but no difference between those of the pre-and post-SARS periods. There were 162, 162 and 209 emergency airway interventions during these three periods resulting in the airway intervention rates as 3.3, 4.6 and 2.5 per 1000 emergency department visits respectively. There was a significant increase in the airway intervention rate in the SARS period compared to the pre-SARS period (OR 1.421, CI 1.143, 1.768). There was no difference in the airway intervention rate between the post-and pre-SARS period.\n\nThere was no change in patient demographics during the three periods (Table 1 ). There were also no differences in the presenting diagnoses of the patients during the three periods (Table 2) .\n\nOral tracheal intubation without medication was the most common method of intubation followed by intubation with induction and neuromuscular blocking agents during all three periods (Table 3) . There was no significant difference in the method of intubation among the three periods.\n\nAttending emergency physicians attempted 53.7% of intubations during the pre-SARS period. This increased to 56.2% during SARS and 81.3% in the post-SARS period (Table 4 ). There was no significant increase in the number of intubations attempted by emergency physicians during the SARS period compared with the pre-SARS period; however there was a significant increase in the were no significant differences in the success rates for all personnel comparing the SARS and post-SARS periods with the pre-SARS period (Table 5) .\n\nOverall, 93.2%, 97.5% and 95.7% of intubations were successful after two attempts for all cases (Table 6 ) during the pre-SARS, SARS and post-SARS periods, respectively. With the exclusion of cardiac arrests, the success rates after the second attempt were 93.1%, 96.6% and 96.2%, respectively. Complications related to airway management during all the periods included cardiac arrest, hypotension, mainstem bronchus intubation discovered on chest radiographs, oesophaegal intubation, multiple attempts at intubation, aspiration, dysrrhythmias, equipment failure (e.g. tracheal tube cuff leak), oropharygeal and dental trauma, medication error and failed intubation. There were no significant differences in the overall complication rate among the three periods (10.5% pre-SARS, 10.5% during SARS and 9.6% post-SARS). There were no deaths resulting from a failed airway. However, there was a significant increase in the number of patients who died from their medical condition during the SARS period compared to the pre-SARS period (OR 1.618, CI 1.039, 2.521) ( Table 1 ).\n\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly recognised serious infectious disease and nosocomial infections from infected patients to healthcare workers (HCW) accounted for almost half of all infections in Singapore.\n\nDuring the SARS crisis, despite the diversion of emergency cases from the designated SARS hospital to the other public hospitals there was a drop in the total number of emergency department attendances. This was due to the general avoidance of hospitals by patients for fear of contracting SARS. However, the proportion of ill cases requiring resuscitation and intubation rose significantly as a result of the diversion and possibly also due to the delayed presentation of patients as a result of the avoidance of hospitals by the public.\n\nIn a previous study done by Wong et al. 6 in the same department of the period just preceding this study (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) , 6 the airway intervention rate was 2.3 per 1000 emergency department visits. This was significantly lower than that during pre-SARS period of this study of 3.2 per 1000 ED visits (OR 1.407, CI 1.192, 1.66) and the SARS period of 4.6 per 1000 ED visits (OR 2.0, CI 1.694, 2.36). The intubation rate of 2.5 per 1000 emergency department visits in the post-SARS period was not different from that of the previous study and probably reflected the baseline rate. There was no difference in the patient demographics and diagnoses in the two studies. The increase in the proportion of intubated cases in the pre-SARS period was probably an anomalous occurrence as there was no difference in the proportion of resuscitation cases between the pre-and post-SARS periods (Table 1) .\n\nWong et al. 6 showed in the previous study 6 that oral tracheal intubation (OTI) without medication constituted 51.5%, OTI with induction agents 19.0% and OTI with induction and neuromuscular blocking agent used in 28.9% of intubations. The ratio of OTI with an induction agent only, compared to induction agent and neuromuscular blocking agent, ratio was 0.65 in the previous study while the combined ratio in this study is 0.26 (Table 3) . There is a significant difference in the method of intubation between the periods of these two studies (OR 0.39, CI 0.275, 0.553) reflecting a trend towards less usage of an induction agent only and more use of both induction and neuroblocking agents.\n\nHealthcare workers who performed oral tracheal intubation in SARS patients were at higher risk of contracting the disease than those who did not. 7 The use of personal protective equipment (PPE) is believed to reduce the likelihood of SARS infection among healthcare workers. 8, 9 Did the use of PPE and the cumbersome powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) affect the success and complication rate of emergency intubations? This study seems to dispel the myth that it would. The success and complication rates were the same during the SARS period compared to the pre/post-SARS periods. The success and complication rates were similar to that of the 1999-2002 study where the first attempt success rate was 90.2% and the complication rate was 9.5%. 6 An interesting phenomenon is observed as a result of SARS. In the pre-SARS period and in the 1999-2002 study, medical officers attempted 45.1% and 40.5% of intubations, respectively. During SARS and immediately post-SARS there was a significant decline in the proportion of intubations performed by them (35.2% and 17.7%, respectively) ( Table 4 ). This could be due to the fact that there was a restriction in the number of healthcare workers in contact with each patient in an attempt to minimise the risk of spreading SARS. As a result, the most experienced or confident personnel performed the intubation and this was usually the attending emergency physician. The higher first attempt success rate during SARS compared to the other periods could have been a combination of factors including competent emergency physicians performing more intubations and an increase in the number of patients with cardiac arrest during SARS who generally are easy to intubate. What is difficult to comprehend is the observation that the medical officer intubation rate dropped even further after the SARS crisis. Was it because attending emergency physicians found it more convenient to perform the intubations themselves rather than to supervise the medical officers? Or did the medical officers shun from managing ill patients for fear of contracting SARS? This trend will possibly affect the training of medical officers in emergency airway management and should be monitored closely. Intervention may be necessary if the trend persists.\n\nThe use of personal protective equipment, including the powered air-purifying respirator, by doctors of the emergency department of the Singapore General Hospital, did not affect the success rate of tracheal intubation during the SARS outbreak.\n\nWe observed that in the presence of a highly infectious disease where person-contacts with patients are limited, the more confident and experienced personnel would be most likely to perform emergency intubations. This phenomenon persisted even after the outbreak had passed and may have implications on training.\n\nThere are no conflicts of interest."}
