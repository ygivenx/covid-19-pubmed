Four Gs bind via Hoogsteen-type base-pairing to yield G-quartets: stacking of at least two G-quartets leads to G4 formation, through \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions between aromatic systems of G-quartets. K + cations in the central cavity relieve repulsion among oxygen atoms and specifically support G4 formation and stability (Sen and Gilbert 1990) . In the human genome, putative DNA G4 forming regions are clustered at definite genomic regions, such as telomeres, oncogene promoters, immunoglobulin switch regions, DNA replication origins and recombination sites (Maizels and Gray 2013) . Actual G4s were shown to be involved in key regulatory roles, including transcriptional regulation of gene promoters and enhancers, translation, chromatin epigenetic regulation, and DNA recombination (Perrone et al. 2013a; Holder and Hartig 2014; Maizels 2015; Rhodes and Lipps 2015; Zhou et al. 2015) .\n\nExpansion of G4-forming motifs were associated with relevant human neurological disorders (Fry and Loeb 1994; Sket et al. 2015; Zhou et al. 2015) . In RNA, G4s were mapped in mRNAs and in non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), such as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) (Jayaraj et al. 2012 ) and precursor microRNAs (pre-miRNAs) (Mirihana Arachchilage et al. 2015) indicating the potential of RNA G4s to regulate both pre-and post-transcriptional gene expression (Agarwala et al. 2015; Cammas and Millevoi 2017) . RNA G4s were also suggested to affect DNA processes (Takahama et al. 2013; Hirashima and Seimiya 2015; Zheng et al. 2015) .\n\nFormation of G4s in vivo was consolidated by the discovery of cellular proteins that specifically recognize G4s (Qiu et al. 2015; Tosoni et al. 2015) and the development of G4 specific antibodies (Biffi et al. 2013; Biffi et al. 2014; Henderson et al. 2014 ) and compounds (Largy et al. 2013; Laguerre et al. 2015; Zheng et al. 2015; Doria et al. 2017) .

Viruses that infect humans are very diverse and, according to the Baltimore classification, they can be divided in seven groups based on the type of their genome and mechanism of genome replication: DNA viruses with 1) double-stranded (ds) and 2) single stranded (ss) genome; RNA viruses with 3) ds genome, or ss genome with 4) positive (ssRNA (+)) or 5) negative (ssRNA (-)) polarity; 6) RNA or 7) DNA viruses with reverse transcription (RT) ability, whose genome is converted from RNA to DNA during the virus replication cycle ( Table 1) . Each of these classes possesses a peculiar replication cycle (Flint et al. 2015 The presence of G4s in viruses and their involvement in virus key steps is increasingly evident (Metifiot et al. 2014; Ruggiero and Richter 2018) . In the dsDNA group, the presence of G4s was described in both Herpesviridae and Papillomaviridae families. In particular, the herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) possesses several repeats of important DNA G4-forming sequences (Artusi et al. 2015) that, when visualized with a G4-specific antibody in infected cells, massively form in the cell nucleus, peaking during viral replication and localizing according to the viral genome intracellular movements (Artusi et al. 2016 ).

A G4 ligand and its interaction with the telomeric repeats present in the HHV-6 genome were responsible for inhibition of human herpes virus-6 (HHV-6) genome integration into the host cell chromosome (Gilbert-Girard et al. 2017) . Similarly, G4 stabilizing compounds led to a reduction in Kaposi's sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV) DNA replication and disrupted maintenance of the virus latent state (Madireddy et al. 2016 ). In the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), RNA G4s were implicated in the regulation of viral DNA replication and translation (Norseen et al. 2009; Murat et al. 2014 ) and in the delay of viral antigen-specific T cells priming ). In addition, the interaction of nucleolin with EBNA1 mRNA G4 mediated the virus immune evasion (Lista et al. 2017) . In human papillomavirus (HPV), the presence of DNA G4s at the genome level was reported (Tluckova et al. 2013) . In ssDNA viruses, the presence of G4s in the adeno-associated virus genome and their interaction with nucleophosmin were shown to repress virus entry and replication (Satkunanathan et al. 2017) . In ssRNA (+) viruses, RNA G4s were described in the genomes of flaviviruses (e.g. Zika) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) (Fleming et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2016a ). In the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, a viral protein domain necessary for viral genome replication/transcription specifically binds RNA G4s (Tan et al. 2009; Kusov et al. 2015) . RNA G4s were also found in the ssRNA (-) Ebola virus genome (Wang et al. 2016b) . In hepatis B virus (HBV), the only member of dsDNA viruses with RT activity, stabilization of a G4 in the promoter of the envelope gene increased transcription and virion secretion (Biswas et al. 2017) . Functionally significant G4s were identified in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), a retrovirus belonging to group 6 (Table 1). G4s were described both in the RNA and DNA proviral genome (Perrone et al. 2013a; Perrone et al. 2014; Piekna-Przybylska et al. 2014) : in the latter, clusters of G4s were reported in the unique long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter (Perrone et al. 2013a; Amrane et al. 2014 ) and in the Nef coding region (Perrone et al. 2013b ). The cellular proteins nucleolin and hnRNP A2/B1 regulate the G4/ds equilibrium in the LTR promoter (Tosoni et al. 2015; Lago et al. 2017; Scalabrin et al. 2017 ) and G4 ligands induced author/funder.

The LTR region of lentiviruses in general (ssRNA RT) present stable and conserved G4s (Perrone et al. 2017a) .\n\nGiven this amount of scattered data, we here aimed at analyzing the presence of putative G4 forming patterns in the genome of all known viruses that can cause infections in humans.\n\nThe analysis is performed at two distinct levels, globally for each viral genome and individually for each detected G4 pattern. First, we asked the following: is the number of putative G4s found in a viral genome simply due to chance, hence trivially reflecting genomic G/C content? Are putative G4s scattered on the genome or preferentially found in regulatory regions? To address these questions, we collected the whole viral genomes deposited in databanks, we clustered them in multiple sequence alignments, and searched for the presence of G4s looking for their conservation in variable/constant genomic regions. The results were compared with an in silico generated set of simulated genomes containing the same nucleotide composition of the corresponding real ones. Results show that many viruses have a highly significant content of putative G4s and their distribution is not random but rather peculiar to specific genomic regions (e.g. coding sequences, repeats, regulatory regions). Once attested that the presence of putative G4s is significant for some viruses, we further analyzed every single identified G4 in a virus species for its conservation across virus strains, as shown in Figure 1 reporting the data analysis workflow. The detailed information on the putative G4s present in each human virus is available in an easily accessible web site with interactive graphics for the straightforward interpretation and navigation of the data (http://www.medcomp.medicina.unipd.it/main_site/doku.php?id=g4virus). author/funder.

To investigate this aspect, we used a semiparametric classifier to assign the virus to its exact class relying on its G4 content and we observed that G4-assignment is statistically relevant in most viruses. G4 features are characteristic of virus classes and families, to such an extent that up to two-thirds of the viruses could be correctly classified into their virus class based on the G4 features.\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study that describes the presence and distribution of G4s in human viruses. In our idea, this work will serve as a guidance for scientists interested in studying the role of G4s in viruses, providing a valid instrument for the selection of the most interesting candidates for experimental validations. author/funder.

Different replication strategies and structural similarities allow to further divide viruses in families (Table 1 ). The complete list of reference sequences for each virus included in the analyses is reported in Supplemental_Material.pdf (Table S1 ). Figure 2 ). Both strands of genomes of single virus families belonging to these groups and to ssRNA (+) and ssRNA (-) were enriched in G4s of all Gislands types (dot plots, Figure 2 ). Conversely, dsRNA and dsDNA (RT) viruses notably lacked the presence of G4s. author/funder. All rights reserved.

Whiskers delimit all the points that fall above/below the third/first quartile plus/minus 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR).\n\nOrange and blue box plots refer to positive and negative strand respectively.\n\nWe next reasoned about the conservation of G4 patterns among different strains of each viral species, hypothesizing that the presence of a conserved G4 pattern within a less conserved genome environment could be an indication of a G4 with a biological function. To allow for the evaluation of G4 conservation in the local context of viral genomes, we computed the \"G4 scaffold conservation index\" (G4_SCI) for each G4 in each virus species.\n\nThis value measures the degree of conservation of G-islands that are necessary and sufficient to form a G4: the higher the score, the higher the conservation of the G4 pattern.\n\nAn example of the results from such analysis is reported in Figure 3 for both the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (segment S) and the human coxsackievirus A: all G4s for each virus are plotted as vertical bars, the height and position of which represent the G4_SCI on the yaxis and the genome coordinates on the x-axis, respectively. In addition, the local sequence conservation (LSC) of the viral genome, calculated with a sliding window approach on all available viral sequences and plotted as a red broken line, is reported alongside. This visualization method allows the prompt identification of the presence, position, and conservation of G-islands within G4s, together with the overall local conservation of the genomic context. Moreover, the degree of conservation of the connecting regions (loops) with respect to G-islands (the loop_conservation value) was calculated as the difference between G4_SCI and LSC. Positive and negative loop_conservation scores indicate, respectively, lower and higher conservation of connecting regions compared to the conservation of G-islands.

All patterns were confirmed also by our analysis and the complete list is reported in Supplemental_Material.pdf (Table S2) , together with the genomic coordinates of the predicted G4s.\n\nG4 formation may be largely affected by G/C content, which greatly varies in viral genomes (from 76% of Cercopithecine 2 herpes virus to 27% of Yaba like disease virus).\n\nMoreover, it has been shown that some di-and trinucleotides are over or underrepresented in certain viruses (Greenbaum et al. 2008; Lobo et al. 2009 ) and, in the context of G4 patterns, it means that their abundance could be biased by unexpected frequencies of guanine homopolymers. G-island frequencies higher or lower than expected would lead to a potential over-or under-representation of G4s, respectively.\n\nTo check whether the presence of putative G4s was statistically relevant or whether it occurred by pure chance, we compared the results obtained from real viral genomes with those obtained by two different simulation strategies. The first one (single nucleotide assembling) assumes that the occurrence of each DNA base in the genome is independent (Huppert and Balasubramanian 2005) ; the second (G-island reshuffling) considers that short sequences of a given length (k-mer) could be over or underrepresented in certain viral genomes (Greenbaum et al. 2008; Lobo et al. 2009 ). In the former case, sequences were generated with the same composition of nucleotides but different order with respect to references; in the latter, sequences were produced by reshuffling the positions of G-islands while keeping constant their number.\n\nFor each virus and simulation strategy, we produced 10,000 random sequences, which were screened with our G4s detection pipeline. Real and simulated data were compared by computing a P-value, defined as twice the smaller proportion of simulated sequences that exhibit, respectively, a higher and lower count of G4s as compared to the median value of all the available complete genome sequences for a certain virus. Hence, a P-value close to 1 author/funder. All rights reserved.

This interpretation holds independently of the length of the genome and/or of the prevalence of either G/C bases or G-islands, as we compare the number of G4s in a viral genome with the one we would expect in a simulated genome of the same length and of either the same base or G-island composition. To account for possible high discreteness of the data, a less conservative version of the P-value, called the mid-P value (Armitage and Berry 1994) , was used. Segment diagrams of the mid-P values of the Baltimore grouped viruses are reported in Supplemental_Material.pdf (Figure S1a and Figure S1b ) (Chambers et al. 1983 ). The number of viruses whose median G4 count is significant at the 10% level is listed in Table 2 (virus names in Supplemental_Table_S3.xlsx) with the indication of whether this median count is either higher or lower than the G4 count in simulated sequences. Our data show that most members of the dsDNA, ssDNA, and ssRNA (RT) present a highly significant content of G4s formed by GG-, GGG-and/or GGGG-islands in one or both strands. ssRNA (-) and ssRNA (+) classes are heterogeneous since some viruses are highly significant in any G4 category (from GG-to GGGG-islands), while others are not (see below). Formation of G4s in members of the dsRNA group is notably less significant.\n\nInterestingly, few viruses display a smaller amount of G4 patterns than expected: both Sagiyama virus and Human coronavirus HKU1 are depleted of G4s belonging to GG-islands category in the positive genome strand when compared with both simulation strategies based on single nucleotide assembling and GG-island reshuffling. In addition, Human parainfluenza virus 2 is poor of G4 patterns made of GG-island in the positive genome strand but is enriched in both GG-and GGG-type G4s in the negative strand.\n\nOverall, if we consider the viruses that contain at least one G4 pattern in either the real or the simulated genomes, we observe that the increase in G4 islands' length corresponds to a decrease in the absolute number of viruses containing G4s, but it also corresponds to a dramatic increase in the fraction of them that is statistically significant.\n\nauthor/funder.

Notably, some of the viruses belonging to Herpesviridae Nonetheless, the overall number of viruses whose G4 content is significantly different with respect to simulated data is higher when real viral genomes are compared to those generated by single nucleotide assembling. This difference indicates that viral genome k-mer composition is indeed affecting the probability of randomly finding G4 patterns, at least in a proportion of viruses as shown in Figure 4 : in the heatmaps, viruses that are significant in only one of the two simulations are reported for GG-and GGG-island patterns, whereas no such cases were found for GGGG-type G4s. author/funder.

This is the case of two members of the Poxviridae family, namely Molluscum contagiosum virus and Orf virus, which are enriched in GG-and GGG-type G4s in both strands of their genomes if compared with the islands reshuffling simulation but show the opposite behavior when compared with the single nucleotide assembling (they are also reported in Figure 4 ). While the full meaning of this observation is not clear to us, it seems that these viruses possess far less G4 patterns than they could have, but at the same time they are able to cluster their relatively few G-islands in more G4 patterns than expected. author/funder.

Genome coordinates were extracted for coding sequences (CDS), repeat regions (RR), 5'-and 3'- Conversely, viruses belonging to the ssRNA (+) and ssRNA (-) classes show G4s mainly grouped in CDS and in the 3'-and 5'-regulatory regions, respectively. HIV-1, belonging to ssRNA (RT) virus class, presents G4s of the GGG-island type mainly in the RR and 3'regulatory regions and in part in CDS. This distribution confirms previous data (Perrone et al. 2013a; Perrone et al. 2013b ). Conversely, other retroviruses (ssRNA (RT)) such as HTLV-1 and HTLV-2, display G4s in the CDS. Given the lower stringency of G4s of the GG-island type, these are more widely distributed along the four identified genomic features, whereas author/funder. All rights reserved.

These data indicate that the distribution of putative G4s in the viral genomes is not random and their localization differs in virus classes.\n\nIn this line of thinking, we asked whether the observed number of G4s, and more precisely its statistical significance with respect to the two random assembling scenarios, is representative for a particular virus class. To answer this question, we checked whether it is possible to classify each virus of the six classes considered, that is, dsDNA, ssDNA, dsRNA, ssRNA (+), ssRNA (-) and ssRNA (RT), into its own class based on the information of how significant its median G4 counts are. We chose to use a classifier built on multinomial logistic regression, as this method is both interpretable and robust to unbalanced group sizes as long as the group sizes are large enough. To avoid the latter drawback, we excluded from the model fit the hepatitis B virus, the only virus classified as dsDNA (RT), and the two unclassified Hepatitis delta and Hepatitis E viruses. Six features were used to classify the viruses, i.e. the six mid-P values (those calculated for GG-, GGG-, GGGG-, both in the positive and negative strand) which qualify the G4 content of the real viral sequences. The values were multiplied by 1 or -1 depending on whether the median G4 count was over-or underrepresented. Since real and corresponding simulated sequences contain the same base or G-islands composition, the classification model based on G4 content does not depend on the highly variable content of G/C in the different virus classes but is specifically designed on the peculiar presence or absence of G4s in each viral class. Furthermore, 34 viruses with no G4 count in all three G-island types in both the positive and negative strand and non-significant mid-P values at the 10% level were excluded from the analysis. We reclassified every viral genome used in our assessment using the discriminant function obtained from a leave-one-out analysis.

Both results support a role of G4s in the virus biology: indeed, some G4s predicted in this work were already reported in viruses and were shown to possess specific and different functions.\n\nWe evidenced some general trends and exceptions that are worth noting if seen in comparative terms among all viruses considered in this study. Starting from the general features we noted: i) high G/C content is not sufficient per se to generate a high number of G4s, as observed in G/C rich members of Herpesviridae family that are richer of putative G4s than expected. ii) The statistical significance of putative G4s found in real sequences tends to decrease when G-islands reshuffling (ISL) is compared with the corresponding single nucleotide assembling (SN), as is appreciable from the heatmap in Figure 4 (more intense color in the heatmap boxes). This suggests that short sequences of a given length (k-mer) could be over or underrepresented in certain viral genomes, as already reported in the literature (Greenbaum et al. 2008; Lobo et al. 2009 ). We observed that viral genomes enriched in putative G4s also contain a higher number of G-islands than expected from mere nucleotide composition, especially evident in the GG-islands. iii) The unevenly distribution of G4s can be used to classify membership of a virus in its corresponding category.

To start with, the ssRNA (-) group is the most heterogeneous one, since some viral species are significantly enriched in G4s up to the most extended G-island type (GGGG), while others lack this feature. Surprisingly, two viruses of the dsDNA group, which was generally highly enriched in G4s, show a significantly lower presence of putative G4 forming patterns than expected in a random sequence with the same G/C content (SN, Supplemental_Table_S3.xlsx), even though the opposite result was observed vs. simulated genomes with the same G-islands content as the real ones (ISL). These two viruses, i.e.\n\nMolluscum contagiosum virus and Orf virus, are the only ones belonging to genera other than the Orthopoxvirus within the Poxviridae family that cause skin lesions. Finally, dsRNA and dsDNA (RT) viruses are notably poor in G4s and with mostly null statistical significance; however, single G4s are highly conserved (e.g. rotavirus a segment 6), therefore still conveying potential biological interest.\n\nThese data indicate that G4s are mainly present in ss-genome viruses, which in principle are more suitable to fold into G4s since they do not require unfolding from a fully complementary strand. The major exception to this evidence is the Herpesviridae family of dsDNA viruses. In this case, most G4s reported here and also previously described (Artusi et al. 2015; Artusi et al. 2016 ) form in repeated regions. It is possible that repeated sequences are more prone to alternative folding, as shown by several non-canonical structures that form in repeated region of the DNA (Fry and Loeb 1994; Reddy et al. 2013; Sket et al. 2015; Zhou et al. 2015) . However, for some herpesviruses a large number of G4s is also present in regulatory regions, which may indicate yet undiscovered functional roles.\n\nTo note that the investigation of putative G4 forming sequences was performed on a author/funder.

Complementary to this, the analysis of the G4 conservation highlights every G4 that is conserved among viral strains.\n\nSince one of the peculiarities of viral genomes is their fast mutation rate, the strong conservation of a specific G-island pattern among strains is per se an indication of the biological relevance of a G4 forming sequence. In light of this, single conserved G4s in viruses that do not display statistically significant G4 enrichment may nonetheless retain key functional roles.\n\nThe discrepancy between the conservation of G-islands and connecting loops (loop_conservation) is an additional indication on the likeliness of biological implications of a specific G4. A positive loop_conservation value highlights G4-islands more conserved than their connecting loops, suggesting that only the G4 scaffold is required for mechanisms that are important for the virus life cycle, while the loops are dispensable. Considering the high mutation rate of viruses, this type of conservation indicates sequences where G4 formation is most likely essential. Equally conserved G4-islands and loops (loop_conservation value = 0) imply that both the G4 scaffold and connecting loops are potentially relevant for the virus and probably involve interactors that specifically recognize them. In this case, the high sequence conservation, especially in CDS, may depend on the required conservation of that peculiar gene product rather than the presence of a G4 structure. Nonetheless, the option of targeting these conserved G4s for therapeutic purposes remains unaltered and the availability of specific and conserved loops may only enhance the chance of finding selective ligands.

Hopefully this will accelerate research in this area with the identification of new G4-mediated mechanisms in viruses and the development of effective and innovative therapeutics.\n\nThe complete list of viral species able to infect humans was retrieved from http://viralzone.expasy.org/all_by_species/678.html (accessed in April 2016) and, for each of them, all available complete genome sequences were downloaded from GenBank. Multiple alignments were built for each virus with usearch8 (Edgar 2010), using a permissive identity threshold (60%) to account for viral variability. Since in some cases nucleotide heterogeneity within viral species exceeded this value, multiple clusters of aligned sequences were obtained for some viruses, representing distinct genotypes. Considering the difficulty of obtaining high quality alignments beyond this limit of nucleotide similarity, all clusters obtained with this method were kept separate, manually assigned to specific genotypes and independently processed in the downstream analyses. One genome per each group of aligned sequences was chosen to serve as reference sequence, possibly belonging to the manually curated RefSeq database [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/]. The complete list of selected reference sequences is reported in Supplemental_Material.pdf (Table S1 ).\n\nG4 patterns were searched in all nucleotide sequences with an in-house developed tool, as previously described (Perrone et al. 2017a; Perrone et al. 2017b ). Briefly, a G4 was reported when at least four consecutive guanine islands (G-islands) were detected. If 'l' is author/funder. All rights reserved.

Patterns in the negative strands of viral genomes were searched by looking for cytosines (Cs) instead of Gs. The conservation of each G4 in the multiple aligned genomes of the viruses was determined by looking at the conservation not only of the G-islands but also their connecting loops. We computed different indexes to measure the nucleotide sequence conservation of viral genomes and G4s:\n\ni) G4_scaffold_conservation_index (G4_SCI): it is an index referred to the G-islands. For each virus and for every detected G4 pattern, it is calculated as the percentage of independent genomes maintaining the corresponding G-islands:\n\nwhere NG_islands is the number of sequences possessing the G-islands in a certain genome position and Ntot is the total number of sequences available for the virus. \n\nTo determine whether the presence of G4 patterns in a virus is a conserved feature or it is only a consequence of its nucleotide composition, simulated viral genomes were generated and compared with real data. Two different strategies were adopted to generate simulated data: i) Single nucleotide assembling (SN) . A computational approach was adopted where, in analogy to Huppert and Balasubramanian (Huppert and Balasubramanian 2005) , the viral genome was modelled as a multinomial stream based on the assumption that each DNA base is independent. These authors give an explicit solution for the prevalence of G4s in the human genome as a function of p(G), the probability of any base being G. In our approach, we also accounted for the probability of cytosines (p(C)) and additionally assumed that adenine (A) and thymine (T) bases were equally likely to occur. As all four probabilities need to sum up to one, the statistical reference model is a multinomial distribution with probability vector (p(G), p(C), p(A), p(T)). We hence took as many independent draws from this multinomial distribution as the number of nucleotides in the reference viral genome (Supplemental_Material.pdf, Table S1 ). The probabilities p(G) and p(C) vary for each virus and reflect the prevalence of G and C bases present in that virus, while the remaining proportion is equally split to give p(A) and p(T).

For each virus, we generated a scaffold of length n made of only As, with n corresponding to the length of the virus reference genome; then, we replaced di-, tri-, or tetra-nucleotides, at random positions and without overlaps, with as many GG-, GGG-, GGGG-, CC-, CCC-, CCCC-islands as in the reference sequence, respectively.\n\nOverall, we generated 10,000 independent sequences for three different simulated datasets, one for each island length.\n\nThe simulated sequences were scanned for the presence of G4 patterns as previously described. The 10,000 counts obtained for each simulation formed the empirical distribution for G4 prevalence under the hypothesis of random assembling of the genome in the SN and ISL models respectively. The mid-P value was calculated using a homemade function. The semiparametric classifier used to assign the virus to its exact class relying on its G4 content was based on the 'multinom' function of the R package 'nnet'.\n\nThe feature tables containing viral genome annotations were downloaded from RefSeq or GenBank for all the reference sequences reported in Supplemental_Material.pdf (Table S1 ).\n\nGenome coordinates were extracted for coding sequences ('CDS'), repeat regions ('repeat_region'), 5'-and 3'-untranslated (UTR) and promoter regions. Given the annotation inconsistency of promoters and UTRs, two new feature categories were created, 5' -and 3' regulatory regions that were defined by exploiting the annotation of genes and CDSs. We calculated boundaries for genes in the positive strand of viral genomes as follows: 5'regulatory = Sgene -Scds; 3'regulatory = Ecds -Egene. For the genes in the negative strand of viral genomes we defined: 5'regulatory = Scds -Sgene; 3'regulatory = Egene -Ecds. Sgene, Scds, Egene and Ecds are the Start (S) and End (E) of genes and CDSs as extracted from the author/funder. All rights reserved.

These newly defined features contain both UTRs and promoters. Since the positive genomic strands are deposited in RefSeq for most of the viruses belonging to the ssRNA (-) class, the following sequences available as negative strands were converted into The overlap extent between G4 patterns and genomic features was computed by intersecting the genomic coordinates of each G4 pattern with the genomic features extracted from the corresponding virus, and a positive count was recorded every time an overlap of at least one nucleotide was detected. Finally, to compare the enrichment in different feature classes, characterized by different sizes, a normalization step was performed. The total extension of each feature class (i.e. CDS, repeat_region, 5' -regulatory and 3'regulatory) was calculated by summing the lengths of individual features. The total count of G4 overlapping a feature class was then divided by the total length of the class and multiplied by a factor 1,000 to obtain the number of G4 present every 1,000 nucleotides. This procedure was performed considering only the G4 patterns conserved in at least 80% of sequences for each viral species. All feature tables files were manually revised to fix inconsistencies in the use of keywords and coordinates."}
