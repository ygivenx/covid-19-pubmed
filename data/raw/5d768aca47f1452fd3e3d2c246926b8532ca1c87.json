{"title": "Comparison of real-time PCR and droplet digital PCR for the detection of Xylella fastidiosa in plants", "body": "Xylella fastidiosa (Xf) is a plant pathogenic bacterium known worldwide. Located in the xylem 36 vessels of plants, its natural way of transmission is sap-feeding insect vectors (Almeida and 37 Nunney, 2015) . To date, five different subspecies (subsp.) have been described: subsp. 38 fastidiosa, subsp. morus, subsp. multiplex, subsp. pauca, and subsp. sandyi (Nunney et al., 39 identified in the Balearic Islands (Spain), on olive trees, grapevines and sweet cherry trees; and 45 in 2017, the presence of the subsp. multiplex was also identified in Spain near Alicante, on 46 almond trees (Landa, 2017 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/582288 doi: bioRxiv preprint\n\nThe data acquisitions and data analyses were performed using Bio-Rad CFX Manager, v 3.0. 170\n\nThe determination of Ct values was done using the regression mode. A Ct higher than 38 was 171 considered to be a negative result, according to the cut-off indicated by (Harper et al., 2010) . 172\n\nFor all the following analyses, the limit of detection was fixed at 100%, meaning the lowest 173 concentration at which all replicates gave a positive signal. 174\n\n175 Two thermal gradients were tested to determine the optimal hybridization temperature ranging 176 from 54.6 to 64.6\u00b0C, and from 57 to 62\u00b0C. Thermal gradients were applied on samples of P.

The first thermal 229 gradient tested allowed us to identify 58.5\u00b0C as the most suitable hybridization temperature, for 230 which positive droplets showed the highest fluorescence amplitude and were well distinguished 231 from the negative droplets. The second thermal gradient confirmed this preliminary result and 232 made it possible to fix the optimum hybridization temperature for ddPCR at 59\u00b0C. At this 233 temperature, positive droplets presented the highest fluorescence amplitude, the less \"rain\" (i.e. 234 droplets ranging between the positive and negative ones), and better separation from negative 235 droplets (data not shown). 236\n\nAddition of BSA to the reaction mix did not increase the number of droplets amplified, the 237 number of target DNA detected, nor the amplitude of the fluorescence signal. However, as it 238 increased the standard deviation between replicates, no BSA was added for the optimized 239 ddPCR protocol retained in this study (data not shown). (Table 1) . 260\n\nAs expected, in these assays, no cross-reaction was found, as no positive droplets were found 261 for any of the NTCs, for the plant matrices. With the exception of O. europaea (curve could not 262 be drawn since only two concentrations gave some results), all the ddPCR matrix standard 263 curves showed high linearity and amplification efficiency, as the correlation coefficient (R\u00b2) 264 was higher than 0.96. This indicated the successful outcomes and good performances of all the 265 assays (Table 2) . 266 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

The bias between 297 the detected amount of DNA and the presumed amount of DNA provided was calculated for 298 each matrix at the limit of detection. Compared to the quantity of DNA expected, DNA 299 quantifications of Xf were overestimated by 6.54% and 23.96% in Q. ilex and in the bacterial 300 suspension, respectively. In L. angustifolia, R. officinalis, P. myrtifolia, and O. europaea, the 301 DNA quantifications of Xf were underestimated by 3.08%, 24.36%, 32.03% and 95.60%, 302 respectively. 303 .

This indicated 310 the successful outcomes and good performances of all the assays (Table 2) . 311\n\nReal-time PCR Harper et al. (2010) was used as a reference method in this study. For all the 312 assays, no mean Ct values exceeding 38 were recorded at a concentration equal to or higher 313 than the limit of detection, meaning that the limit of detection and positive results were 314 consistent. Moreover, for O. europaea the EPPO PM 7/24 protocol mentions a limit of detection 315 for samples artificially contaminated with Xf subsp. multiplex of 100% at 1x10 5 b/mL. In this 316 study, the limit of detection of 5x10 4 b/mL was close to that presented in the PM 7/24 (EPPO, 317 2018b). The limit of detection of Xf in P. myrtifolia is known to be 1x10 3 , which is the same as 318 the value we found (Legendre B., personal communication). The limits of detection of Xf subsp. 319 multiplex for the other matrices could not be compared, as there are no available data. 320\n\nReal-time PCR and ddPCR technology provided equivalent limits of detection for Xf in the 321 following matrices: O. europaea, P. myrtifolia and R. officinalis (Table 1, Table 3 ). The ddPCR 322 technology presented a slightly higher limit of detection of 0.5 log for L. angustifolia. However, 323 a decrease in the limit of detection for Xf of 0.5 log for Q. ilex and the bacterial suspension 324 wereobserved. In the conditions of DNA extraction used for this study, and according to the 325 volume of DNA added to the real-time PCR assay, the theoretical limit of detection should be 326 1x10 2 b/mL for the five plant matrices. These results revealed that L. angustifolia and P. 327 myrtifolia may contain fewer real-time PCR inhibitors than Q. ilex and R. officinalis. Moreover, 328 the limit of detection of the bacterial suspension was 5x10 3 b/mL, meaning that the QuickPick 329 extraction kit may not be 100% efficient to extract the DNA of bacteria in pure culture. 330 331 The 22 naturally infected samples were then analyzed by ddPCR. The presence of Xf was 341 detected in 21 of them, including samples P13 and Q04, with at least two droplets, and a total 342 concentration ranging from 4.41x10 2 cp/mL to 1.61x10 7 cp/mL, confirming the ability of 343 ddPCR to detect Xf in naturally infected samples. As only one positive droplet was detected for 344 sample C01, this sample was considered negative by ddPCR. With the exception of samples 345 L04, P06 and P13, the decrease in the Ct value was correlated with an increase in the quantity 346 of DNA detected by ddPCR (Table 4 ). For each matrix the results obtained by ddPCR and real-347 time PCR were compared and were highly correlated (Figure 3) . 348\n\n. CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder. It is made available under a Erwinia amylovora showed similar levels using real-time PCR and ddPCR, while the detection 369 of R. solanacearum in low-level infected samples was improved by ddPCR (Dreo et al., 2014) . 370\n\nIn our study, the two methods showed the same limit of detection for O. europaea, P. myrtifolia 371 and R. officinalis. Real-time PCR allowed better detection of 0.5 log for L. angustifolia, and 372 ddPCR allowed better detection of 0.5 log for Q. ilex and bacterial suspension. 373 ddPCR was also compared with real-time PCR on 22 naturally infected samples. Using real-374 time PCR, two samples P13 and Q04 had a Ct value higher than 38, and were thus considered 375 negative, i.e. not infected by Xf. As these two samples were frozen at -20\u00b0C for one year, it is 376 possible that the DNA was altered, explaining the higher Ct values obtained in this study. The 377 other 20 samples, considered positive, had a Ct value lower than 38. Using ddPCR, Xf was 378 detected in 21 samples, as more than two positive droplets were obtained. ddPCR did not reveal \n\nIn this work, we proposed the first suitable ddPCR assay for the detection of Xf in plants. We 389 easily transferred a well-known routinely used real-time PCR technique for Xf detection in 390 ddPCR. Here, we reported all the set up steps leading to the optimal protocol and its comparison 391 with the current routine method. The results demonstrated the usefulness of ddPCR technology 392 as an alternative method for Xf detection in plants. However, the ddPCR assay is more time-393 consuming than real-time PCR and does not seem to be suitable for routine analysis. This 394 technology requires more steps than real-time PCR. Furthermore, the reaction mix has to handle 395 with care to ensure the generation of the appropriate number of generated droplets. 396\n\nNevertheless, as only two droplets are needed to confirm a sample as positive with ddPCR, this 397 method could confirm the status of samples found to be negative by real-time PCR due to high 398\n\nCt values, and could improve Xf detection in low-level infected samples. ddPCR should be 399 tested on insects to see whether this technology would still be efficient, and whether it offers a 400 benefit for Xf detection in this matrix.
