{"title": "Gastrointestinal complications of secondary immunodeficiency syndromes", "body": "Secondary immunodeficiency syndromes constitute a wide array of non-gastrointestinal disorders. The gastrointestinal complications of these disorders often follow a common theme, with patients being at significant risk for infections of the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, cellular changes in the gastrointestinal tract (the largest immune organ in the body), malabsorption, peptic disorders and dysmotility are other problems faced by these children. Worldwide, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection and malnutrition are by far the most common secondary immunodeficiency states. However, in the USA and other developed countries, HIV-1 disease has come under excellent control with the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), resulting in a decreased incidence of gastrointestinal complications. Nevertheless, review of the gastrointestinal complications of HIV-1 disease in children is important, as HIV-1 is prevalent worldwide and serves as a model for complications of other secondary immunodeficiency states.\n\nThe first cases of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) were described in the early 1980s. Later in 1984, 1 HIV-1 was determined to be the causative agent, and HIV-1 infection was recognized as a spectrum of disease, ranging from asymptomatic infection to full-blown AIDS. The AIDS epidemic claimed an estimated 3 million lives in 2004, and an estimated 5 million people acquired HIV-1 in 2004, bringing to 40 million the estimated number of people globally living with the virus. 1a With the successful preventive strategies of elective cesarian section delivery and chemoprophylaxis of pregnant HIV-1infected women, the transmission rates plummeted from 15-30% to less than 2% of all HIV-1-infected women delivering infants. 2 Furthermore, with the advent of HAART in 1996, the natural history of HIV-1 in children in developed countries has altered markedly. 3 However, the successes of prevention and prophylaxis have not been realized in developing countries, where HIV infection continues to increase. Thus there are grave implications for children, especially in some developing nations, where more than 25% of the women are infected with HIV-1 and therapeutic options for pregnant women at this time are limited. 4 HIV-1 is an RNA virus that belongs to the lentivirus family. It has a particular tropism for the CD4 surface antigen of cells, and the binding of HIV-1 to the CD4 receptor initiates the viral cycle. The virus may subsequently replicate within the host cell or, alternatively, the proviral DNA within the host cells may remain latent until cellular activation occurs. Human T lymphocytes and monocytesmacrophages are the primary cells that are infected with HIV-1, although other cell lines may be infected as well. The net effect is suppression of the immune system and a progressive decline in CD4+ T lymphocytes, which leaves patients susceptible to opportunistic and recurrent bacterial infections.\n\nThe gastrointestinal tract is the main source of HIV-1 infection when parenteral transmission is excluded. In vertical transmission, HIV-1 is found in the gastrointestinal tract after the fetus swallows infected amniotic fluid, blood, cervical secretions or breast milk. Virus, inoculated in the gastrointestinal tract, infects the fetus as it enters into the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) through the tonsil or upper intestinal tract. The rates of acquisition of HIV-1 through the gastrointestinal tract are likely related to the quantity of virus in the person transmitting it [5] [6] [7] and the immunologic function and maturity of the patient being infected. Mucosal infections with opportunistic infections may increase HIV-1 transmission. Mycobacterial infections upregulate CC chemokine recptor 5 (CCR5) expression in monocytes, which facilitates the entry of CCR5-tropic HIV-1.\n\nOther factors, such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), which is induced by nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB (which itself is pathogen induced), are potent inducers of HIV-1. 8, 9 Cellular routes that potentially can transmit HIV-1 across the gastrointestinal tract include M cells, dendritic cells and epithelial cells. M cells are specialized epithelial cells that overlay the Peyer's patches and transport large macromolecules and micro-organisms from the apical surface to the basolateral surface. Human transport of HIV-1 by M cells in vivo has not been reported. Dendritic cells bind HIV-1 through a specific dendritic cell-specific adhension molecule. In vitro studies support the role of dendritic cells in transmitting HIV-1; [10] [11] [12] [13] however, the role of the dendritic cell in in vivo transmission of HIV-1 has yet to be determined. Epithelial cells express CCR5 and can selectively transfer CCR5-tropic HIV-1. The epithelial cell can transport HIV-1 in vitro from the apical to the basolateral surface. 14, 15 The R5-tropic viruses are transferred in vitro through epithelial cell lines. 16 Once transmitted, the lamina propria lymphocytes express CCR5 and CXC4 chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), which support HIV-1 replication. 17, 18 Early after infection there is a greater proportion of infected lymphocytes in the lamina propria than in peripheral blood. 19, 20 The lymphocytes are able to disseminate the virus to distant sites, with depletion of CD4 cells in the lamina propria 19, 21 and then in the blood. As mucosal and peripheral T cells are depleted, monocytes and macrophages become important reservoirs for the virus. The intestinal macrophages do not promote inflammation and do not carry the receptor for CCR5 or CXCR4; however, the blood monocytes are different in their profile and are infected by HIV-1. They are found infected in the blood and thereafter take up residence in the gut. 22 They are stimulated by opportunistic agents and proinflammatory cytokines. 23 Villous atrophy and gastrointestinal tract dysfunction are coincident with high levels of HIV-1 viral load in the gut. 24 A dysfunctional gastrointestinal tract can produce significant clinical symptoms that contribute to both morbidity and mortality in children with HIV-1 infection. These symptoms include weight loss, vomiting, diarrhea and malabsorption (Table 39 .1).\n\nAs reviewed above, there are distinct changes in the cellular milieu of the gastrointestinal tract in HIV-1-infected patients. Previous studies have shown that activated mucosal T cells play a role in the pathogenesis of enteropathy in the human small intestine 25 and can affect the morphology of the villi and crypts in a manner similar to that seen in patients with HIV-1 infection. Recently the magnitude of viral burden in the gastrointestinal tract has been associated with villous blunting and other abnormal morphology. 24 A number of studies in the 1980s associated a distinct enteropathy with HIV-1. This was first described by Kotler et al., 26 who studied 12 homosexual men with HIV-1 and controls. Seven of the patients had diarrhea, weight loss, an abnormally low D-xylose absorption and steatorrhea, without evidence of intestinal infection. Jejunal and rectal biopsies were obtained in all patients with diarrhea. Jejunal biopsies showed partial villous atrophy with crypt hyperplasia and increased numbers of intraepithelial lymphocytes. This was the first histologic description of a specific pathologic process that occurred in the lamina propria of the small intestine in some patients with HIV-1. Ullrich et al. 27 also defined small intestinal structure in adult patients with HIV-1. Microscopically, he found low-grade small bowel atrophy and maturational defects of enterocytes in 45 HIV-1-infected patients. These findings also support an HIV-1 enteropathy, characterized by mucosal atrophy with hyporegeneration. However, some investiga-tors have challenged this concept, suggesting the findings could be attributed to an undiagnosed enteric infection.\n\nMiller et al. 28 published histologic findings in 43 children with HIV-1 infection. The majority of patients had normal villous architecture and many of the children with villous blunting had an associated intercurrent enteric infection. Distinct features of hyperplasia of the lamina propria and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes were not apparent.\n\nIn order to link the altered morphology with abnormal intestinal function, Bjarnason et al. 29 studied intestinal inflammation and ileal structure and function in patients with a wide spectrum of HIV-1 disease states. HIV-1infected patients who were minimally symptomatic had normal intestinal absorption and permeability, yet had increasing gastrointestinal dysfunction as they progressed to AIDS. Malabsorption of bile acids and vitamin B 12 did not correlate with morphometric analysis of ileal biopsies and were unremarkable in these patients. Thus, there was significant mucosal dysfunction with only minor ileal morphologic changes. Malabsorption of bile acids may play a pathologic role in patients with AIDS diarrhea. The absorptive defect of AIDS enteropathy using a D-xylose kinetic model of proximal absorption was studied, 30 There were minimal histologic abnormalities in both the proximal and distal biopsy sites in patients with diarrhea and no enteric infection. D-Xylose absorption was low, and the absorptive defect was more severe and greater than would be expected from the histologic abnormalities found. Thus, these findings support other studies that showed little association between histologic characteristics of the small bowel and its absorptive function in patients with HIV-1 infection. Most studies do not support a direct role for gastrointestinal malabsorption on growth failure or weight loss. Ullrich et al. 27 described gastrointestinal malabsorption in HIV-1-infected patients who had low levels of lactase enzyme in the brush border, crypt death, decreased villous surface area and decreased mitotic figures per crypt when compared with control patients. In addition, Keating et al. 31 described absorptive capacity and intestinal permeability in HIV-1-infected patients. Malabsorption was prevalent in all groups of patients with AIDS, but was not as common in the asymptomatic HIV-1-infected patients. Malabsorption correlated significantly with the degree of immune suppression and with body mass index. There were mild decreases in the jejunal villous height to crypt depth ratio, yet not as severe as the subtotal villous atrophy found in celiac disease. Lim et al. 32 found disaccharidase activity to decrease proportionately with increasing HIV-1 disease severity, although there was no association between disaccharidase levels and weight loss. In addition, Mosavi et al. 33 found no correlation between diarrhea and weight loss in HIV-1-positive patients. More recently, Taylor et al. 34 found mild histologic changes accompanied by severe disaccharidase abnormalities; however, symptoms were severe enough to withdraw lactose in only 25% of the patients. Collectively these studies suggest that gastrointestinal malabsorption may be present, but is not always associated with weight loss and diarrhea.\n\nFormal studies of intestinal absorption in children with HIV-1 are more limited. Malabsorption occurs frequently in HIV-1-infected children and may progress with the disease. In one study, 40% of children had non-physiologic lactose malabsorption and 61% had generalized carbohydrate malabsorption that was not associated with gastrointestinal symptoms or nutritional status. 35 These findings have been confirmed by others. 36 Another study in children revealed an association between diarrhea and nutrition. 37 Abnormal D-xylose absorption has also been associated with enteric infections in children. 35 Fat and protein loss or malabsorption have also been described. Sentongo et al. 38 evaluated fat malabsorption and pancreatic exocrine insufficiency using fecal elastase-1 enzyme assay in 44 HIV-1-infected children. Hormone-stimulated pancreatic function testing and 72-h stool and dietary fat sample collection were performed in children with abnormal fecal elastase levels. The prevalence of steatorrhea was 39% and that of pancreatic insufficiency was 0% (95% confidence interval 0-9%). There were no associations between steatorrhea and pancreatic insufficiency, growth, HIV-1 RNA viral load, CD4 status or type of antiretroviral therapy. Others studies support the absence of association. 39 Thus, the clinical significance of steatorrhea in pediatric HIV-1, similar to absorption of other nutrients, is unclear.\n\nThe etiology of malabsorption in HIV-1 infection is probably multifactorial. The cellular milieu of the lamina propria is altered significantly with HIV-1 infection. 24, 40 The depletion of the CD4 T lymphocytes in the intestinal tract may cause change in the cytokine environment and alter intestinal function. Viral load in the intestinal tract may be considerably higher than that measured peripherally, and this can also affect mucosal gastrointestinal structure and function. Studies suggesting these hypotheses include that of Kotler et al. 41 which looked at intestinal mucosal inflammation in 74 HIV-1-infected individuals. These authors found abnormal histopathology in 69% of the patients, and this finding was associated with altered bowel habits. High tissue P24 antigen levels were observed, and these correlated with more advanced HIV-1 disease. Tissue P24 detection was associated with both abnormal bowel habits and mucosal histology. The tissue content of cytokines, including TNF, \u03b1-interferon and interleukin-1\u03b2, were higher in HIV-1-infected individuals than in controls, and these increases were independent of intestinal infection. Thus, HIV-1 reactivation in the intestinal mucosa could be associated with an inflammatory bowel-like syndrome in the absence of other enteric pathogens.\n\nSmall bowel bacterial overgrowth can be another source of gastrointestinal dysfunction leading to malabsorption. Bacterial overgrowth may be due to AIDS gastropathy 42, 43 in which the stomach produces only small amounts of hydrogen chloride, allowing bacterial pathogens to escape the acid barrier of the stomach and colonize the duodenum. Additionally, iatrogenic hypochlorhidria may be due to the use of acid-blocking agents as treatment for ongoing peptic disease. Interestingly, some authors have found no relationship between gastric pH, small bowel bacterial colonization and diarrhea in HIV-1-infected patients. 44 Enteric pathogens 45 have been associated with enteric dysfunction, as discussed below.\n\nWith the advent of HAART, gastrointestinal symptoms, especially those associated with opportunistic infections, are less common. As viral burden decreases, immunosuppression has less effect on gastrointestinal function. Ritonavir, a protease inhibitor, in combination therapy resulted in restoration of gastrointestinal function in 10 children with carbohydrate malabsorption, steatorrhea, protein loss and iron deficiency. 46 However, one study in adults found similar rates of fat malabsorption in patients taking HAART and in those not taking HAART. 47\n\nThe gastrointestinal tract is a major target for opportunistic infections in immunocompromised HIV-1-infected children. The spectrum of these infections is dependent on HIV-1 disease progression. In developed countries, with improved viral suppression associated with HAART, opportunistic infections of the gut and elsewhere are less common. 48 However, immunocompromised children continue to be at risk for infections with cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), Cryptosporidium and microsporidia. Previous dogma that much of the diarrhea found in children with HIV-1 infection is not associated with enteric pathogens has been challenged. Unusual viral and parasitic infections can be diagnosed as a result of better diagnostic techniques. However, the cause of diarrhea in a significant number of patients with HIV-1 remains undiagnosed. 49\n\nThe detection of viral gastrointestinal infections in HIV-1infected children can sometimes be difficult owing to the limitations of diagnostic techniques. The most common gastrointestinal viral pathogen in HIV-1-infected children is CMV. Other pathogens, such as HSV, adenovirus, Epstein-Barr virus and a variety of other unusual viruses, can also contribute to intestinal dysfunction and diarrhea.\n\nHSV infection in an immunocompromised child usually represents reactivation of a latent virus that had been acquired earlier in life. Gastrointestinal infection with HSV most commonly involves the esophagus and causes multiple small discrete ulcers. HSV can also involve other areas of the intestinal tract, including the colon and small bowel. The diagnosis of HSV relies on recognizing the multinucleated intranuclear inclusion bodies (Cowdry type A) with a ground-glass appearance and molding of the nuclei. The squamous epithelium is usually infected, although there may also be involvement of intestinal glandular epithelium in the mesenchymal cells. HSV monoclonal antibody staining is confirmatory for the diagnosis. In extensive involvement, there may be transmural necrosis and development of tracheo-esophageal fistulae. Treatment of HSV and other common gastrointestinal pathogens and their primary site of involvement are outlined in Table 39 .2.\n\nOther herpesviruses have also been detected in the gut of HIV-1-infected individuals. A case report of one 34-yearold HIV-1-infected man with intestinal pseudo-obstruction and disseminated cutaneous herpes zoster revealed positive immunohistochemistry against herpes zoster in a resected portion of the terminal ileum. This area had focal ulceration. The virus was localized to the muscularis propria and myenteric plexi throughout the entire length of the specimen. The authors postulated that the location of the virus in the gut may have been the etiologic factor for the pseudo-obstruction. 50 Cytomegalovirus CMV in the immunocompromised child, like HSV, represents reactivation of a latent virus that was acquired in earlier life. CMV is one of the more common viral pathogens of HIV-1-infected children. The reported incidence of gastrointestinal involvement in the pre-HAART era varied from 4.4% to 52% of patients studied. The incidence rates may have varied based on the techniques of diagnosis. 43 CMV infection is rare in patients with CD4 T-lymphocyte counts greater than 50 cells/mm 3 . 51 Thus, in the HAART era, morbidity and mortality rates from CMV-associated gastrointestinal disease have diminished. 52 CMV may involve any part of the gastrointestinal tract, with an increased incidence in the esophagus or colon. CMV infection usually results in one or two discrete single and large ulcers of the esophagus and colon. Lesions may lead to severe gastrointestinal bleeding and hemodynamic instability. CMV inclusion bodies can be discovered incidentally in an asymptomatic patient, and this does not necessarily reflect disease.\n\nIn patients with upper intestinal CMV disease, there can be dysphagia and upper abdominal symptoms; whereas diarrhea is more common with colitis. The diarrhea can be watery or bloody in nature. Children may be systemically ill. 53 The colitis from CMV infection is patchy in nature and can be associated with severe necrotizing colitis and hemorrhage. 54 CMV usually affects the cecum and the right colon. Diagnosis is confirmed by endoscopy and biopsy. The histologic appearance of CMV-infected cells is quite unique (Fig. 39.1 ). These cells are enlarged and contain intranuclear and cytoplasmic inclusion bodies. The nuclear inclusion bodies are acidophilic and are often surrounded by a halo. Cytoplasm inclusion bodies are multiple, granular and often basophilic. Cells that are dying may appear smaller and smudged, with poorly defined inclusion bodies. Staining for CMV antigen shows that many of the infected cells are endothelial cells with others being perivascular mesenchymal cells. CMV can cause vasculitis because of its target cell population. Thus, the spread of CMV occurs with circulating infected endothelial cells. Treatment options are outlined in Table 39 .2. Once HAART is established, with decreased viral burden (both HIV-1 and CMV) and improved CD4 counts, CMV treatment may be discontinued without concern of reactivation. 52\n\nInfections with other unusual viral pathogens have been described. These include the human papilloma virus and Epstein-Barr virus, which have been identified in esophageal ulcers of patients with HIV-1. Adenovirus of the stomach and colon have also been reported and are often difficult to identify. 55 In the pre-HAART era, patients who excreted adenovirus from their gastrointestinal tract had a shorter survival. 56 There are unusual enteric viruses that have been associated with diarrhea in HIV-1-infected children. 57 These viruses, among others, include astrovirus and picobirnavirus. 58 Cegielski et al. 59 studied 59 children with HIV-1 infection in Tanzania. They looked for enteric viruses identified by electron microscopy of fecal specimens. Small round structured viruses (SRSVs) were found more frequently in HIV-1-infected children than in uninfected children with chronic diarrhea. Rotavirus and coronavirus-like particles were not associated with HIV-1 infection. These authors considered that these SRSVs may be associated with HIV-1 infection and could lead to chronic diarrhea in Tanzanian children.\n\nBacterial infections that involve the gastrointestinal tract of children with HIV-1 infection may be divided into three groups: bacterial overgrowth of normal gut flora; pathogens that can affect immunocompromised children as well as immunocompetent children (Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Clostridium difficile and Aeromonas); and bacterial infections that are more unique to immunocompromised children (Mycobacterium avium intracellulare complex; MAC).\n\nFew studies have evaluated bacterial overgrowth in HIV-1-infected children, although gastric hypoacidity has been associated with opportunistic enteric infections and bacterial overgrowth in adult patients with HIV-1. 60 Other studies have not found this association. Small bowel bacterial overgrowth was not a common finding in a group of 32 HIV-1-infected patients, regardless of the presence of diarrhea, and it was not associated with hypochlorhydria. 44 Lactose hydrogen breath testing has shown high baseline readings in children that may indirectly suggest bacterial overgrowth of the small intestinal tract. 35 Detection of bacterial overgrowth in the small bowel is usually performed by quantitative duodenal aspirate for bacterial culture, with therapy directed at treating the organisms, which are often anaerobic. these organisms occurs more frequently in immunocompromised patients. The decline in the incidence of infections with these bacterial pathogens in developed countries has been linked to the improved immunity associated with HAART. However, combined morbidity and mortality rates associated with HIV-1 and these bacterial pathogens in developing countries approach 50% in some studies. 61 HIV-1-infected patients with Campylobacter infection have higher rates of bacteremia than the general population. Deaths from sepsis due to this organism have been reported in severely immunodeficient patients with AIDS, despite HAART. 62 Colitis from C. difficile is also more common in the immunosuppressed population owing to chronic antibiotic use and impaired immune system. 63 Pulvirenti et al. 64 studied 161 HIV-1-infected patients with C. difficile and found that they had longer hospital stays and more admissions than patients without C. difficile infection, as well as other opportunistic infections such as herpes virus. They found C. difficile-associated diarrhea in 32% of all study patients with diarrhea. However, infection with C. difficile appeared to have little impact on morbidity or mortality. In a 1998, New York state screening study 65 of hospitalized HIV-1-infected patients in the HAART era, 2.8% were admitted with a diarrheal diagnosis, with 51.3% of these having a C. difficile infection. Thus, even with HAART, diarrhea is prevalent and is often associated with identifiable pathogens. Because of the serious complications that are associated with active bacterial enteric infections in immunodeficient children, treatment options are outlined in Table 39 .2.\n\nIntestinal infections with mycobacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, MAC and other atypical mycobacteria, were the most frequently encountered bacterial infections in HIV-1-infected patients in the pre-HAART era, 66 and became more prevalent in the pre-HAART era as patients were living longer with CD4 counts below 200 cells/mm 3 . 67, 68 In the HAART era, disseminated MAC in colonized patients can be successfully prevented; however, the effects of HAART on restoration of CD4 counts does not prevent MAC colonization. 69 Infection with MAC usually occurs in the very late stages of AIDS in children, when CD4 counts are lower than 200 cells/mm 3 . The most common clinical manifestations of gastrointestinal infections with MAC include fever, weight loss, malabsorption and diarrhea. Intestinal obstruction, resulting from lymph node involvement and intussusception, terminal ileitis, which resembles Crohn's disease, and refractory gastric ulcers are often found. Severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage has also been described. 70 Endoscopically, fine white nodules may be seen in the duodenum, or the duodenal mucosa may look velvety and grayish in appearance. Segments of the gastrointestinal tract can become infected with MAC. Histologically, there is a diffuse histiocytic infiltrate in the lamina propria with blunting of the small intestinal villi. These histiocytic infiltrates can be recognized on hematoxylin and eosin staining and on acid-fast stains, and are pathognomonic for infection ( Fig. 39.2) . With the advent of HAART, immune reconstitution disease has been described. 71, 72 This is likely an immune reaction in which previously quiescent organisms become active because of the improved immune function associated with HAART. This can occur in as many as 25% of patients who respond to HAART. 73 Lymphadenitis is the most common condition, although abscesses can appear anywhere. Severe abdominal complaints may result.\n\nAppropriate therapies are outlined in Table 39. 2, yet this organism is often frustrating to treat. Azithromycin 600 mg, when given in combination with ethambutol, is an effective agent for the treatment of disseminated M. avium disease in patients infected with HIV-1. 74 Caution must be exercised in administering these multidrug regimens for MAC in patients receiving concurrent HAART. Rifamycins induce cytochrome P450 enzymes and accelerate the metabolism of clarithromycin and HIV-1 protease inhibitors. Conversely, clarithromycin inhibits these enzymes, resulting in increased rifabutin toxicity. The net result is treatment regimens that can be extremely difficult to tolerate and manage, especially for the sicker patients. Clarithromycin and azithromycin must be administered in combination with other agents, such as ethambutol, to prevent the emergence of macrolide resistance. 75\n\nOther entities, such as bacterial enteritis, have been described in adults with HIV-1. A study by Orenstein and Kotler 76 evaluated ileal and colonic biopsies in patients with AIDS and diarrhea, and found bacteria similar to adherent E. coli along the intestinal epithelial border. Similar findings were documented by Kotler et al., 77 who showed adherent bacteria in 17% of all adult patients with AIDS. The infection was localized primarily to the cecum and right colon, and three distinct histopathologic patterns of adherence observed: attachment on effacing lesions, bacteria intercalated between microvilli, and aggregates of bacteria more loosely attached to the damaged epithelium. The bacterial cultures of frozen rectal biopsies yielded E. coli in 12 of the 18 patients. These findings suggest that chronic infection with adherent bacteria can also produce the syndrome of AIDS-associated diarrhea. In a 'look back' evaluation, Orenstein and Dieterich 55 found that enteropathogenic bacterial infections were overlooked on initial examination and concluded that, for accurate diagnoses, specimens should be evaluated by laboratories with expertise in HIV.\n\nH. pylori prevalence is not significantly different between HIV-1-infected patients and HIV-1-negative patients. 78, 79 Some investigators have found the seroprevalence of H pylori to be lower in HIV-1-infected patients, 80 especially as CD4 counts decline with advancing disease. 78 The protection from H. pylori may be a result of frequent antibiotic use or correlated with a more advanced, dysfunctional immune state that results in a decreased inflammatory response to the organism. 81 Remission of a high-grade gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma followed H. pylori eradication and HAART in a patient with AIDS. 82 Treatment of H. pylori in HIV-1-infected children is similar to non-infected children, with special attention to drug interactions.\n\nIn the early 1980s, cryptosporidiosis was regarded as an AIDS-defining disease and an opportunistic intestinal pathogen. It became an important cause of chronic diarrhea, leading to high morbidity and mortality rates in immunocompromised patients. To date, no effective chemotherapy is available. With the introduction of pro-tease inhibitors in HAART regimens, the incidence of cryptosporidiosis in patients with AIDS has declined substantially in developed countries. 83 However, in developing nations, gastrointestinal infection with C. parvum is prevalent, and carries high morbidity and mortality rates. 84, 85 Although Cryptosporidium was initially described in animals, it was first noted to cause an enterocolitis in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent humans in 1976. 86, 87 An intact T-cell response is the primary mechanism that confers protection against this organism; thus patients with abnormal T-cell function or number are at risk. The spectrum and severity of disease in immunocompromised individuals with cryptosporidiosis correlates with most severe disease found in individuals with defects in the T-cell response. 83 The overall frequency of infection seems to be related to the severity of immunodeficiency and not the specific disorder. 88 Cryptosporidium usually affects the gastrointestinal tract, although it has been found in other organs including the biliary tract, 89 pancreas 90 and respiratory tract. 91 In immunocompetent individuals, the diarrhea is self-limiting, whereas in immunocompromised patients it may be protracted and associated with significant malabsorption and nutritional compromise. The small intestine is the primary target, although it can occur in any part of the intestinal tract. Esophageal cryptosporidiosis has also been described in one child 92 and in adults. Clayton et al. 93 described two patterns of enteric cryptosporidiosis. One was accompanied by severe clinical disease with significant malabsorption, with the majority of the organisms found in the proximal small bowel, whereas less severe clinical disease was seen in patients with colonic disease or with infection only noted in the stool. Patients with proximal small bowel infection with Cryptosporidium showed crypt hyperplasia, villous atrophy, lamina propria inflammatory infiltrates, abnormal D-xylose absorption, greater weight loss, and shorter survival, with greater need for intravenous hydration and hyperalimentation than patients with colonic disease. In other studies, absorption of nutrients showed an inverse correlation with active infection, 94 as shown by altered vitamin B 12 and D-xylose absorption, and lactulose and mannitol urinary excretion ratios. Intestinal function improved in patients whose oocyte counts were reduced by treatment with paromomycin.\n\nSymptomatic cryptosporidiosis has been documented in as many as 6.4% of immunocompetent children and 22% of immunodeficient children, whereas in an asymptomatic population, Cryptosporidium was found in 4.4% of immunocompetent and 4.8% of immunodeficient children. 94a Spiramycin at 100 mg per kg daily for 14 days caused a significant reduction in the shedding of infectious oocysts, and no gastrointestinal symptoms developed in children treated for asymptomatic infection, whereas children who were not treated developed gastrointestinal symptoms. 94a The diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis is made by identifying the organisms in a duodenal aspirate, stool or tissue sample (biopsies). On hematoxylinand eosin-stained sections, these organisms can be found as rows or clusters of basophilic spherical structures 2-4 \u03bcm in diameter, attached to the microvillous border of the epithelial cells ( Fig. 39.3) . The tips in the lateral aspect of the villi show the greatest number of organisms in the small intestine. In the colonic epithelium, the crypt and surface epithelial involvement appear equal. Cryptosporidium also stain positively with Giemsa, and negatively with mucous stains. The acid-fast stain on a stool sample is one of the most widely used methods of determining whether a patient has cryptosporidiosis. More recent sensitive and specific methods for diagnosing cryptosporidiosis include fluoresceinlabeled IgG monoclonal antibodies. 95, 96 Treatment of cryptosporidiosis in children with HIV-1 infection is often difficult. The disease can be chronic and protracted with diffuse watery diarrhea and dehydration. Several different agents are used to eradicate the organism, with varying success rates. The most effective treatment is to improve immunologic function and nutritional status. With the advent of HAART, many children's immune function has been restored with a lower incidence and prevalence of Cryptosporidium infection. 97 The introduction of HAART in a patient with severe debilitating Cryptosporidium infection not only resulted in an increased CD4 count in the peripheral blood and clearance of the organism, but also produced a marked increase in CD4 count in the rectal mucosa on biopsy, suggesting this may have been the main mechanism of clearing the parasite. 98 Octreotide therapy of acute and chronic diarrhea, with coincident improvement in nutritional status, eradicated Cryptosporidium in one patient. 96, 99 Other investigators have used bovine hyperimmune colostrum with benefit. 100, 101 The macrolides, such as azithromycin, have shown some promise in the treatment of Cryptosporidium infection. 102, 103 The effect of protease inhibitors as therapy against Cryptosporidium has been tested in a cell culture system. 104 Nelfinavir moderately inhibited the host cell inva-sion over a period of 2 h. Indinavir, nelfinavir and ritonavir inhibited parasite development significantly. The inhibitory effect was increased when the aminoglycoside paromomycin was combined with the protease inhibitors indinavir, ritonavir and, to a lesser extent, saquinavir, compared with the protease inhibitor alone. Thus protease inhibitor therapy may directly (rather than indirectly, through its effects on the immune system) inhibit growth of Cryptosporidium. Amadi et al. 84 found that a 3-day course of nitazoxanide improved diarrhea, helped eradicate the parasite and improved mortality in HIV-1-seronegative, but not HIV-1-seropositive, children in Zambia.\n\nMicrosporidia are obligate intracellular protozoal parasites that infect a variety of cell types in many different species of animals. These organisms were first described in 1857, when recognized as a cause of disease in non-human hosts. 105 The first description of microsporidia (Enterocytozoon bieneusi) as a human pathogen was in 1985, and microsporidia have since been described as more common human pathogens. 106 Infection with microsporidia typically occurs in patients with severely depressed CD4 T-lymphocyte counts. One of the largest case studies of intestinal microsporidiosis in patients with HIV-1 infection was described by Orenstein et al. 107 in 67 adult patients with AIDS and AIDS-related complex and chronic non-pathogenic diarrhea. E. bieneusi was diagnosed by electromicroscopy in 20 of the patients. Jejunal biopsies were more positive than duodenal biopsies. The parasites and spores were clearly visible by light microscopy in 17 of the 21 biopsies. Infection was confined to enterocytes located at the tip of the intestinal villus, and the histologic findings included villous atrophy, cell degeneration, necrosis and sloughing. Other investigators [108] [109] [110] found microsporidia in as many as 50% of HIV-1-infected patients with chronic and unexplained diarrhea evaluated in the pre-HAART era. E. bieneusi has been documented in 15-25% of children with 111 or without 112 diarrhea in developing countries, making it fairly ubiquitous in these regions of the world. Other species of microsporidia, including Encephalitozoon (septata) intestinalis, can cause significant enteric disease with diarrhea, wasting and malabsorption. Septata intestinalis differs from E. bieneusi in its tendency to disseminate, and can infect enterocytes, as well as macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells.\n\nMicrosporidia are found with increasing frequency in HIV-1-negative patients. 113 Infection has been documented in almost every tissue and organ in the body, and in epithelial, mesenchymal and neural cells. Microsporidia can cause inflammation and cell death, and a variety of symptoms including shortness of breath, sinusitis and diarrhea with wasting. If left untreated, microsporidiosis can be a significant cause of mortality.\n\nTreatments for microsporidia include albendazole, which can relieve clinical symptoms and eliminate microsporidial spores in the feces, especially of the less common pathogen, E. intestinalis. E. bieneusi is more challenging to treat, although therapy with fumagillin or its analog, TNP-470 (antiangiogenesis agents) have shown promising results. [114] [115] [116] Other studies show atovaquone as an effective treatment as well. 117 Indirect treatment by improving the immune system with HAART has also effectively cleared these organisms. 97, 118, 119 \n\nIsospora belli is recognized as an opportunistic small bowel pathogen in patients with HIV-1 infection. This organism is most common in tropical and subtropical climates. Isosporiasis can be diagnosed by identification of the oocyte in the stool or by biopsy. The diagnosis is critical because, unlike cryptosporidiosis or microsporidiosis, the therapy is very effective. I. belli is found within the enterocyte and within the cytoplasm. The organism stains poorly, although the central nucleus, large nucleolus and perinuclear halo give it a characteristic appearance. The infection produces mucosal atrophy and tissue eosinophilia. A 10day course of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is effective therapy, and recurrent disease can be prevented by ongoing prophylaxis with this combination drug. 120 Ciprofloxacin, although not as effective, is an acceptable alternative for those with sulfa allergies. 120 Other therapies for Isospora include pyrimethamine, also indicated for patients with sulfa allergies. 121\n\nBlastocystis hominis is usually considered a non-pathologic parasite, but has been described in patients with chronic diarrhea and HIV-1 infection. 122 This organism is more pathogenic in immunocompromised patients and can cause mild, prolonged or recurrent diarrhea. Effective therapy includes di-iodohydroxyquinoline 650 mg orally three times daily for 21 days. Other protozoan infections that can be found in HIV-1-infected patients are Entameba histolytica, Entameba coli, Entameba hartmanni, Endolimax nana and Giardia lamblia in 4% of cases.\n\nCandidiasis of the gastrointestinal tract is the most common fungal infection in HIV-1-infected children. The esophagus is the primary target of Candida and this infection occurred in the majority of patients during the course of their illness in the pre-HAART era. It was also the second most frequent AIDS-defining disease, second in prevalence only to Pneumocystis carinii. Currently, with successful viral suppression, invasive Candida is rare with children on HAART. Patients with Candida esophagitis complain of odynophagia or dysphagia, and may often have vomiting and recurrent abdominal pain. Children often have oral thrush, coincident with more disseminated and invasive Candida esophagitis, although the absence of oral thrush does not preclude the diagnosis of Candida esophagitis. 28 In one study, oral candidiasis preceded the diagnosis of Candida esophagitis in 94% of children. 123 Other risk factors include low CD4 count and prior antibiotic use. 123 Histopathologically, yeast forms within an intact mucosa confirm invasive disease. This is in contrast to colonization, where the yeast is found overlying intact mucosal surfaces or necrotic tissue. These organisms are best seen with Grocott's methenamine silver method or periodic acid-Schiff stain. Upper gastrointestinal studies are suggestive of Candida esophagitis with diffuse mucosal irregularities (Fig. 39.4) . Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with biopsy and appropriate staining is the most sensitive test for determining invasive candidiasis of the esophagus. Candidiasis can also occur in the stomach, as well as the small bowel if the acid barrier has been suppressed either through an intrinsic decrease in gastric acid production or iatrogenically with the use of potent acid blockers. Numerous effective therapies have been described to treat Candida of the upper gastrointestinal tract, including fluconazole, ketoconazole and itraconazole. 124, 125 Ketoconazole has more hepatic side-effects than fluconazole. Itraconazole is usually well tolerated and is effective. In severe and invasive disease, either topical or intravenous amphotericin can be used. Agents such as oral miconazole and nystatin are not indicated for invasive Candida.\n\nDisseminated histoplasmosis develops in 5% of adult patients with AIDS in the mid-western region of the United States, and elsewhere. The clinical signs and symptoms related to this infection may be indolent, but left untreated can carry significant morbidity and mortality. 126 The likelihood of disease is higher in patients with CD4 counts under 200 cells/mm 3 . 127 There is enterocolitis associated with infection, and at colonoscopy, plaques, ulcers, pseudopolyps and skip areas are frequently seen. Cryptococcal gastrointestinal disease has been identified in patients with disseminated Cryptococcus infection. The esophagus and colon are involved most frequently. P. carinii infection of the gastrointestinal tract has also been described. 45 Gastrointestinal pneumocystosis develops after hematogenous or lymphatic dissemination from the lungs, or reactivation of latent gastrointestinal infection. The administration of aerosolized pentamidine has increased the risk of developing extrapulmonary spread of PCP. PCP infection can occur throughout the gastrointestinal tract. In the lamina propria there are foamy exudates with P. carinii organisms found within them. Although more rare, infection of the colon can also cause diarrhea.\n\nIn up to 15-25% of HIV-1-infected children, the etiology of the diarrhea is unclear. Autonomic dysfunction is another potential mechanism of non-infectious diarrhea not previously described. Clinically, children with autonomic neuropathy have sweating, urinary retention and abnormal cardiovascular hemodynamics. It is possible that this autonomic denervation may contribute to the diarrhea in patients with HIV-1 infection, as suggested by Griffin et al. 128 when neuron-specific polyclonal antibodies were applied to jejunal biopsies. There was a significant reduction in axonal density in both villi and pericryptal lamina propria in patients with HIV-1 infection compared with controls, with the greatest reduction in patients with diarrhea. Octreotide therapy has shown promising results in some patients. 129 Lastly, drug side-effects should be considered, with many of the antiretroviral therapies causing chronic diarrhea and other gastrointestinal toxicities (Table 39. 3).\n\nMotility problems of the esophagus and stomach have been reported [130] [131] [132] and can be a source of upper gastrointestinal complaints including vomiting, dysphagia, nausea and dyspepsia. The motility abnormalities may be primary, or secondary to infectious or inflammatory disease of the respective organ. Hypertension of the lower esophageal sphincter with incomplete relaxation, esophageal hypocontraction and non-specific motility disorders have been described in patients with normal intact esophageal mucosa. 131 Gastric emptying, especially in patients with infections or advanced disease, may be delayed, as documented by gastric scintigraphy. 130 However, delayed gastric emptying does not always correlate with upper gastrointestinal symptoms or small bowel motility studies. In adults with HIV-1 infection and minimally advanced disease, gastric emptying of solids was delayed and emptying of liquids accelerated compared with that in controls. No abnormal esophageal motility patterns were found. All patients had a normal endoscopy prior to the motility studies. 132 Thus, in the absence of infectious and inflam-matory disease in patients with appropriate symptoms, motility studies or empiric trials of prokinetic agents should be considered, with careful consideration of drug interactions.\n\nEsophageal ulceration can be a result of an intercurrent opportunistic infection. Idiopathic oral and esophageal ulcers have been described in both children and adults with HIV-1. 133 These ulcers are characteristically large and may be single or multiple in nature (Fig. 39.5) . The ulcers are located in the mid to distal esophagus. Controversy exists regarding the pathogenesis of these ulcers, with some investigators identifying HIV-1 at the ulcer base, 134 whereas others have not. 135 Treatment options for these ulcers are limited, but include steroid therapy, with encouraging results, 134 and thalidomide. 136, 137 However, chronic low-dose thalidomide does not prevent recurrence of the oral or esophageal aphthous ulcers. 138 In addition to the potentially teratogenic effects, a significant portion of children receiving thalidomide develop a rash, which precludes use of the drug. Significant caution should be exercised when using thalidomide. Overall, HAART has had a positive impact on esophageal disease occurrence and relapse. 139 \n\nThe diagnostic approach to the child with HIV-1 and gastrointestinal symptoms is outlined in Table 39 .4. A comprehensive clinical history should be taken with a focus on estimating caloric intake and evaluating abdominal symptoms, such as diarrhea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Growth history should also be reviewed. The physical examination should focus on an assessment of nutritional state and the possibility of intestinal or hepatobiliary disease. With diarrheal symptoms, every HIV-1-infected child should have a complete evaluation for bowel pathogens. This should precede all other diagnostic studies, as treatment of the pathogen may result in resolution of the symptoms. Investigation for enteric infections should include studies for the organisms outlined in the preceding section on infectious diarrhea. The child's antiretroviral regimen and initiation of new medications should be noted as many of these medications produce significant gastrointestinal side-effects (see Table 39 .2). Every effort should be made to correlate timing of the initiation of a drug with onset of symptoms. The clinician should keep in mind that children with active enteric infections may also have secondary problems with malabsorption.\n\nIf the clinical history and physical examination are suspicious for malabsorption without enteric infection, the next step should include an evaluation of specific nutrient absorption. Carbohydrate malabsorption can be detected through lactose breath hydrogen testing, which measures hydrogen production as a response to an oral lactose load. A raised baseline breath hydrogen or early peak of hydrogen production suggests bacterial overgrowth, and appropriate treatment can be initiated. Lactose malabsorption results in a level of hydrogen production more than 10-15 parts per million over baseline, 60 min after ingestion. Dietary changes can then be made. D-Xylose absorption testing also helps to determine the absorptive capacity of the gastrointestinal tract. D-Xylose is an absorbable sugar that does not require active transport for uptake by enterocytes. Thus, the D-xylose serum level, after administration of a test dose, reflects the absorptive ability of the gastrointestinal tract and the integrity of the mucosal surface. In younger children, the administered dose is 0.5 g per kg bodyweight, given orally after an overnight fast. In older children and adolescents, the maximum dose is 25 g. A serum level is obtained 1 h after ingestion. Urine samples may be obtained for 5 h after ingestion as well.\n\nFat malabsorption is determined by a 72-h fecal fat collection. A high-fat diet is administered several days before the collection is initiated and throughout the collection period. An alternative method is to keep a dietary fat intake record during the period of fecal fat collection.The stool is analyzed for total fat content and the fecal fat is compared with the amount ingested; a coefficient of fat absorption is then calculated. Ten percent or more of ingested fat in the stool is considered abnormal. Alternatively, a Sudan stain may be performed on a random stool sample. This may be helpful as a quick test for fat malabsorption, although it is not so reliable. Quantification of fecal elastase may help to determine whether the fat malabsorption is pancreatic in origin. Lastly, raised fecal alpha 1 -antitrypsin levels suggest protein loss from the gut. If noninvasive studies, such as those described above, are not helpful in documenting and determining the etiology of the malabsorption, diarrhea or vomiting, endoscopy (either upper or lower) with biopsy and appropriate culture of fluid may be useful. Miller et al. 28 confirmed histologic abnormalities in 72% of children undergoing upper endoscopy. In 70% of patients in this series the clinical management of the child was changed because of the endoscopic evaluation. A high diagnostic yield has been supported by other investigators. 140 Specific gastrointestinal symptoms are not predictive of abnormal findings at endoscopy; advanced HIV-1 disease stage and an increased number of symptoms seem to be more predictive. 28 Histologic studies of the small bowel may aid in determining the degree of the villous blunting, and electron microscopy and special staining for opportunistic pathogens can be performed. Quantitative bacterial cultures and parasite evaluation of the duodenal fluid should be obtained when an endoscopy is performed. Characteristically, the detection of more than 10 5 organisms per ml of duodenal fluid confirms bacterial overgrowth. It is important to obtain both anaerobic and quantitative cultures. However, other studies have shown that endoscopy does not improve the diagnostic yield compared with stool examination in patients with intestinal infection. The only exception is the diagnosis of CMV. 141 An additional study found that flexible sigmoidoscopy was as useful as a full colonoscopy for diagnosing infection. 142 Special histologic stains for fungal, mycobacterial or viral infections did not increase the diagnostic yield over routine hematoxyline and eosin staining. 143 Treatment of intestinal infections has been outlined in Table 39 .2 and previous sections. Therapy for gastrointestinal malabsorption should be directed toward the underlying diagnosis. If clinically symptomatic lactose malabsorption is found, a lactose-free diet should be initiated. Compliance may be difficult, because many foods contain lactose. Children can limit the effects of dietary lactose by taking exogenous lactase or using lactase-treated milk. There should be careful consideration of calcium and vitamin D intake, as children with HIV-1 infection are susceptible to low bone mineral density. 144 If there is malabsorption of protein and fat, a protein hydrolysate diet 628 Gastrointestinal complications of secondary immunodeficiency syndromes should be tried. Many of these supplements are poorly tolerated because they are unpalatable. In some circumstances, specialized supplements may need to be administered through a supplemental feeding tube. 145, 146 Peptic and motility disorders can be treated as in other non-HIV-1-infected children, paying careful attention to potential drug interactions with antiretroviral regimens.\n\nA variety of other disorders (Table 39 .5) can cause secondary immunodeficiencies with effects on the gastrointestinal tract. Overall, these disorders are more prevalent than either primary or HIV-1-associated immunodeficiencies. Premature infants, children with cancer and associated exposure to immunosuppressant and cytotoxic medications (including children with graft vs host disease), and children with protein-losing enteropathy with associated loss of immunoglobulins from the gastrointestinal tract, can all be immunodeficient because of the underlying disorder. In general, children with these immunodeficiencies are at risk for many of the same complications that are experienced by children with HIV-1 infection. Gastrointestinal tract infections are among the most common problems facing children with other secondary immunodeficiencies.\n\nMalnutrition is the most common cause of immunodeficiency worldwide. Nutritional status and immunity have long been linked in many disease states. Before HIV-1 was described, P. carinii pneumonia and Kaposi's sarcoma, known opportunistic diseases, were first described in otherwise healthy, but malnourished, children and adults in developing nations. 147, 148 This association led investigators to conclude that nutrition alone can affect the immunologic response of an individual. In malnourished children there is a profound involution of lymphoid tissues, including thymic atrophy and diminished paracortical regions of lymph nodes. 149 In young infants and children, protein-calorie malnutrition increases the risk of death by severalfold by increasing the susceptibility to infection. 150 In many countries, the mortality rate increases from 0.5% in children whose weight-for-height percentage of standard is greater than 80%, to 18% in children whose weight-for-height percentage of standard is less than 60%. 151 In other diseases such as cystic fibrosis and cancer, nutritional status has been linked closely to survival rates and morbidity. With leukemia and lymphoma, the incidence of infection with P. carinii is higher in patients with protein-calorie malnutrition. 147 Biochemically, protein-calorie malnutrition leads to changes in several aspects of the immune system. Cellmediated immunity, microbial function of phagocytes, complement systems, secretory antibodies and antibody affinity, are consistently impaired in patients with significant malnutrition. Additionally, deficiencies of micronutrients, especially zinc and iron, as well as many others, may also have deleterious effects on the immune system. Other aspects of immunity that are altered by protein-calorie malnutrition include impaired chemotaxis of neutrophils, decreased lysozyme levels in serum and secretions, and interferon production in antibody response to T celldependent antigens. A child with protein-calorie malnutrition may also have impaired mucosal immunity with lowered concentrations of secretory IgA in saliva, nasopharynx, tears and the gastrointestinal tract compared with well-nourished control children.\n\nSimilar to children and adults with HIV-1 infection, in patients with malabsorption T-cell function is depressed not only in the peripheral circulation but also in the intestinal tract. Subsequently, plasma cell function and macrophage activity may be impaired, leading to more frequent intestinal infections in children with severe proteincalorie malnutrition. Not only does nutrition improve the immunologic functioning of the intestinal tract, but nutrients themselves are trophic and essential for the maintenance of the absorptive capacity of the intestines. In some studies, weight loss greater than 30%, due to other disorders, was associated with a reduction in pancreatic enzyme secretion of over 80%, villous atrophy, and impaired carbohydrate and fat absorption. 152 These disorders are promptly reversed with appropriate nutritional rehabilitation. In addition, with villous blunting, increased antigen uptake may also occur, leaving the child at higher risk of enteric infection. The pathogenesis of villous blunting is currently unclear, but may be due to crypt hyperplasia as the primary event with premature sloughing at the villus tip 153 vs loss of enterocytes at the villus tip with resultant proliferation at the crypts. 154\n\nImmunosuppressant medications are the mainstay of therapy for many diseases in children with autoimmune disorders, inflammatory bowel disease, chronic pulmonary disease, cancer and organ transplantation. The best known immunosuppressants include corticosteroids, azathioprine, ciclosporin, tacrolimus and antithymocyte globulin. Unfortunately, the effects of these medications are not targeted toward specific organs, but rather indiscriminately suppress immune function throughout the child. Thus, several immunologic functions including a decrease in monocyte adherence, neutrophil chemotaxis and overall suppression of the inflammatory response are found. Children are at risk of enteric infections, similar to those described in children with HIV-1 infection.\n\nGastrointestinal problems are common, with significant accompanying morbidity for HIV-1-infected children. Primary problems of the gastrointestinal tract are associated with gastrointestinal malabsorption and infections. Scientific progress has been made regarding the detection of novel pathogens that can contribute to the gastrointestinal dysfunction, yet there continues to be a subset of children with persistent diarrhea and abdominal pain that is of indeterminate etiology, despite extensive evaluations. Future efforts should focus on improved therapeutic options for treatment of unusual infections as well as further delineation of the etiology of chronic non-pathogenic diarrhea. Although the etiology of immunodeficiencies in disorders such as cancer and malnutrition is different than that associated with HIV 1, many of the same diagnostic and management principles apply. Clinicians should be aggressive in the evaluation of diarrhea and gastrointestinal tract dysfunction in children with ongoing secondary immunodeficiencies."}
