{"title": "Topology Engineering of Proteins in Vivo Using Genetically\nEncoded, Mechanically Interlocking SpyX Modules\nfor Enhanced Stability", "body": "In synthetic polymers,\nchain topology and molecular architecture\nhave been important molecular parameters to tune their physical properties\nand functions.1\u22123 Controlling macromolecular topology is thus one of\nthe most commonly practiced molecular engineering approaches.4,5 To a certain extent, it compensates for the lack of sequence control\nin traditional polymers. An extraordinary example is the star polymer,\nwhich emerged back in the early days of polymer science.3 Multiple polymer chains emanating from a central\nfocal point constitute the basic structure of star polymers.6 This unique topology imparts intriguing properties\nto star polymers, including low viscosity, multiple surface functional\ngroups, low crystallinity, etc.7,8 Nowadays, synthetic\nstar polymers can be prepared with delicate control over the arm number,\narm composition, molecular weight, polydispersity, etc.7 Sophisticated architectures with heterogeneous\ncompositions are not uncommon.9,10 By contrast, recombinant\nproteins are usually synthesized by the cellular machinery in an extremely\nprecise fashion.11 The stereochemistry,\nsequence, chain length, and even 3D folded structure are all determined\non the genetic level and faithfully reproduced in the biological system.\nThe topology is, however, usually restrained to linear configuration.\nTo date, there are only a few examples of nonlinear proteins, including\ncyclic proteins, tadpoles, stars, H-shape proteins, and catenanes,12,13 yet its full potential remains to be explored. It is thus highly\ndesired to further expand the topological dimension for protein engineering.\n\nThe significance of controlling the composition and topology of\nthe protein backbone has been increasingly recognized.12 A purely synthetic approach to \u201cbackbone\nengineering\u201d has been developed via introducing compositions\nother than amide bonds (e.g., esters and triazole linkages) into the\npolypeptide backbone to tune their assembly and properties.14,15 Knotted topology has been found to bring considerable stabilizing\neffects with completely native polypeptide backbones.16,17 Topological variations beyond linear configuration have included\ncyclics, tadpoles, stars, and other branched proteins.12 Among them, cyclic topology is the most commonly\nencountered nonlinear protein topology in nature and has also been\nextensively studied to date.18\u221220 Various technologies have been\ndeveloped to prepare cyclic proteins, both in vivo(21) and in vitro,22 including intein technology,23 SpyTag-SpyCatcher chemistry,24,25 sortase/butlase-mediated\nligation,26\u221230 etc. Typical benefits from backbone cyclization include the dramatically\nimproved stability against both thermal denaturation and proteolytic\ndigestion. By contrast, there is only scarce reporting on star proteins\nand other branched proteins in the literature.12 A related example is the synthetic star polypeptides that\nexhibit robust and potent antimicrobial activities.31\u221233 This is in\nline with their highly exposed multivalent surface functionalities.\nTaking advantage of the highly reactive SpyTag-SpyCatcher chemistry,34 isomeric three-arm and four-arm star proteins\nhave been prepared with high efficiency in vitro.12 However, direct expression of star proteins in vivo remains a challenge.\n\nSupramolecular architecture\nis another important, yet less explored\ntopic in protein science.35\u221237 Nature has elegantly demonstrated\nthe power of supramolecular structure engineering in examples such\nas the viral capsids where the stability is greatly enhanced by mutually\ninterlocked protein catenanes.38 Dawson\net al. reported the solid state synthesis of a peptide catenane by\nnative chemical ligation and carefully studied the thermodynamics\nof protein catenation.39\u221241 Recently, protein catenation has also been achieved in vivo based on an elastin-like model protein, facilitated\nby p53dim-guided chain intertwining and SpyTag-SpyCatcher ligation.13 Being genetically encoded, this method can be\nadapted to other proteins of interest as well. Protein catenation\nbrings in significant improvement in thermal stability and proteolytic\nresistance.13,40 Nevertheless, the catenation\nefficiency was only moderate (\u223c60%) in previous reports. We\nthus seek ways to further improve the catenation efficiency and create\neven more complex protein topologies.\n\nIn this contribution,\nwe report the design and application of genetically\nencoded SpyX modules for the efficient cellular synthesis of diverse\nmechanically interlocked protein architectures including obligate\ndimers and star proteins (Figure 1). The topology was demonstrated by partial digestion\nexperiments, and the catenation efficiency was evaluated for different\nconstructs. In general, the SpyX modules have high catenation efficiencies\neven in the presence of fusion proteins at either end of the N- and\nC-termini or both. The consequences of topology engineering have also\nbeen examined. It was found that proteins with complex topologies\nexhibit significantly improved stability against thermal denaturation\nand trypsin digestion.\n\nThe design of SpyX\nmodules is based on p53dim (X, which forms an entwined dimer upon\nfolding40,42) and a genetically encoded SpyTag (A) and\nSpyCatcher (B) reactive pair (which spontaneously form an isopeptide\nbond upon reconstitution).34 Depending\non their relative locations, there are two configurations, namely,\nAXB and BXA (Figure 1). To facilitate catenation, we consistently added short linkers\nwith sequence of GSGS before X and of SGGSG after X in both constructs\n(Figures S1 and S2). Upon expression in vivo, the X domain shall form entwined dimer, bringing\nA and B in vicinity to react and form the covalent catenanes. Hence,\nAXB is expected to have concatenated rings with relatively smaller\nsizes, and BXA would have almost the entire SpyCatcher domain concatenated.\nSince the A-B complex is tightly folded,43 the overall sizes of AXB and BXA should be similar. They all possess\ntwo N-termini and two C-termini, allowing the preparation of diverse\nmechanically interlocked protein topologies. When fusion proteins\nare tethered at one single terminus, obligate dimers will be obtained.\nWhen fusion proteins are tethered on both termini, four-arm star proteins\nwill be produced (Figure 1). To probe the topology, a proteolytic site recognized and\ncleaved by tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease was included in both\ndesigns near the X domain. Two mutants were also designed as controls.\nThe K344P mutant of the p53dim domain (X\u2032, where the lysine\nat position 344 is mutated to proline) could not form the entwined\ndimer and exists as a monomer.13,40 The D/A mutant of SpyTag\n(A\u2032) abolishes the chemical reactivity by changing the aspartic\nacid to nonreactive alanine (Figures S1 and S2).12 Therefore, AX\u2032B and BX\u2032A\nare expected to give cyclic monomer controls whereas A\u2032XB and\nBXA\u2032 serve as linear monomer controls. We anticipated that\nby placing SpyTag, SpyCatcher, and p53dim in close neighborhood, the\ncatenation efficiency can be dramatically improved. The resulting\nSpyX domains have relatively small overall sizes (\u223c24 kDa)\nand thus may serve as mechanically interlocking protein modules.\n\nThe genes were\ndesigned, optimized, synthesized, and cloned to pQE80L vector. The\nplasmids were used to transform Escherichia coli. BL21 strain and the expressions were all performed in 2XYT medium\nat 30 \u00b0C with IPTG induction. Purifications were performed using\naffinity chromatography following the standard protocol. The products\nwere analyzed by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and SDS\u2013PAGE.\nThe characterization results of AXB and BXA as well as their mutants\nare summarized in Figure 2. It is clear that both AXB and BXA were mainly obtained as\ndimers in the crude products (Figure 2A). For AXB, there are some chain-extended oligomers,\nwhereas, for BXA, it is almost exclusively dimer. After purification\nwith SEC, the dimers of AXB and BXA show up as monomodal peaks at\nretention volumes much lower than the cyclic monomer mutants (AX\u2032B\nand BX\u2032A) (Figures 2B and 2C). Interestingly, the linear\nmonomer mutants (A\u2032XB and BXA\u2032) elute at almost the\nsame time as the catenanes. It indicates that, in solution, the linear\nmutants exist as dimers due to the entwining of X and the complexation\nof A\u2032 and B regardless of covalent bond formation. It is also\nthe preorganization of A and B by X that promotes the highly efficient\ncatenation. The MALDI-TOF mass spectra also corroborated the dimer\nformation (Figures 2D and S3). For AXB, it gives mainly a\nmolecular peak of [M + H]+ at m/z of 47163 that is consistent with the expected value of\n47097 for AXB dimer within the range of error. The A\u2032XB and\nAX\u2032B both show mainly one molecular peak assigned as [M + H]+ at m/z of 23523 and 23524,\nrespectively. For BXA, the molecular peak of [M + H]+ at m/z of 49265 was only observed at relatively\nlow abundance as compared to the major peak assigned as [M + 2H]2+ at m/z of 24646. We speculated\nthat BXA may have strong binding affinity to proton and, thus, mainly\nforms doubly charged ions upon MALDI ionization.\n\nThe dimer formation is also evident in SDS\u2013PAGE for\nboth\nAXB and BXA (Figure 2E). Theoretically, assuming that the linkers between A and X and\nbetween X and B are sufficiently long and flexible, there will be\nfour possible products, namely, [2]catenane, cyclic dimer, knotted\ncyclic dimer, and noncovalently associated rings (Figure S4). Among them, only the last one breaks into cyclic\nmonomers in SDS\u2013PAGE. We used gel densitometry to quantify\nthe relative abundance of possible products. For AXB, the dimer is\na clean band, accounting for \u223c92% of the mixture. There is\nmuch more cyclic monomer (\u223c6%) than linear monomer (\u223c1%).\nFor BXA, the dimer band is smeared and there seem to be two distinct\nbands which represent \u223c61% and \u223c31% of the total mixture,\nrespectively. The smearing could be due to a highly stable folded\nstructure that resists denaturation even in the presence of SDS.13,43 While products of different topology may also contribute to multiple\nsmearing bands, we will show in the following section by limited TEV\ndigestion experiments that it is less likely. Compared to AXB, the\nresidual BXA monomer exists almost exclusively as cyclic monomers\n(\u223c8%). It indicates that the monomeric rings are the major\nside product in both cases, which could result either from premature\nring closure or from the formation of noncovalently associated rings\nafter chain entwining. The catenation efficiency is thus evaluated\nas the product of dimer contents determined individually from SEC\nprofile and SDS\u2013PAGE. It is (64% \u00d7 92%) for AXB and (96%\n\u00d7 92%) for BXA, respectively.\n\nWe further performed electrospray\nionization mass spectrometry\n(ESI-MS) characterization combined with traveling wave ion mobility\n(TWIM) separation, which is useful to differentiate species with identical m/z but different charges and sizes.44 This powerful technique has been used to study\nsupramolecular aggregates,45 peptide self-assembly,46,47 protein conformation,48,49 etc. In this work,\nthe proteins were first ionized and the ionic species were subjected\nto ion mobility separation by their mass-to-charge (m/z) ratios and sizes/charges. The full ESI mass\nspectra of AXB and BXA with charge states denoted are shown in Figure 3. It should be noted\nthat the signals of trace monomers may superimpose within that of\ndimers. After ion mobility separation, the dimers were indeed found\nto be the dominant species for both AXB and BXA (Figures 3C and 3D). The monomers were only detected in trace abundance. The signals\nof monomers and dimers extracted from TWIM-MS spectra are shown in Figure S5. The results are consistent with the\nfindings in SDS\u2013PAGE, again confirming high catenation efficiencies.\n\nTo prove that the dimers are catenanes rather than cyclic\ndimers,\nwe performed partial digestion experiments. Since TEV cleavage site\nis placed inside the concatenated ring, treating proteins with TEV\nprotease would first lead to both cyclic monomer and linear monomer\nupon limited proteolysis and further to linear monomer upon complete\ndigestion. Meanwhile, digestion of cyclic monomer controls and linear\nmonomer controls were also performed for comparison. The appearance\nof cyclic monomer upon partial digestion is a clear evidence of the\ninterlocked catenane topology in both cases (Figures 2F and S6). By\ncontrast, the cyclic and linear controls were converted to relinearized\nmonomers and fragments, respectively, under identical conditions.\nThe same process was also followed by UPLC\u2013ESI-MS (Figures S7 and S8). Taking AXB for example, the\npurified sample shows up as a main peak at 47089, which matches the\nexpected value of 47097 for catenane. Consistent with SDS\u2013PAGE\nanalysis, there are two very minor peaks with molecular weights of\n23544 and 23562, which can be assigned as the cyclic and linear monomers,\nrespectively. Upon partial digestion, the amounts of cyclic and linear\nmonomers increased rapidly, especially the linear one. Eventually,\nonly the peak assigned to the linear monomer can be observed (Figure S7). Throughout the process, we could\nnot observe any peaks corresponding to the linear dimer with molecular\nweight of 47114, which is the partially digested product of both simple\nand knotted cyclic dimers. The UPLC\u2013ESI-MS analysis of the\npartially digested products of BXA also gives similar results (Figure S8). It suggests that the cyclic dimers\nexist, if any, in extremely low abundance. Other indirect evidence\ncomes from the comparison between the AXB dimer and AX\u2032B dimer\nin SDS\u2013PAGE (Figure 2E, lanes 2 and 4). The dimer of AX\u2032B is most likely\na cyclic dimer, but it appears in a distinct position as compared\nto the dimer of AXB. So the existence of cyclic dimers in AXB is less\nlikely. Therefore, both AXB and BXA are indeed mechanically interlocked\nprotein catenanes.\n\nHaving established\nthat AXB and BXA are both very efficient in forming protein catenanes,\nwe further investigated how the introduction of various proteins would\naffect the catenation efficiency. The protein can be added either\nto the N-terminus or to the C-terminus of SpyX modules, or both. As\nan example, immunoglobulin-binding domain B1 of streptococcal protein\nG, a small folded protein known as GB1, has been used as the model\nprotein.50 Two consecutive domains have\nbeen added, leading to four constructs: (GB1)2-AXB, AXB-(GB1)2, (GB1)2-BXA, BXA-(GB1)2 (Figure S9). The proteins were expressed under\nthe same conditions as AXB and BXA. The SEC overlay of the crude expression\nproducts is shown in Figure 4A. It can be seen that both AXB and BXA effectively lead to\nthe formation of dimers and the dimer content in the crude product\nis already very high (up to 97% in BXA-(GB1)2). Since GB1\nprotein is known to exist as monomer, the products obtained here can\nbe regarded as obligate dimers of (GB1)2. After SEC purification,\nthe products show up as symmetric monomodal peaks, suggesting uniform\ncomposition. The SDS\u2013PAGE analysis reveals that there are also\ntrace amounts of monomers in the products, a scenario similar to that\nin AXB or BXA. The catenation efficiencies are summarized in Table 1, which are generally\ngood. The MALDI-TOF mass spectra further prove the dimer formation\n(Figure S10). For example, AXB-(GB1)2 shows a major molecular peak [M]+ of 74356, which\nmatches well with the calculated value of 74341 within the range of\nerror. The results suggest that the incorporation of folded protein\ndomains, either to the N- or to the C-terminus, does not affect the\nmechanical interlocking of SpyX modules, leading to the formation\nof obligate dimers. The results have more implications for engineering\nprotein activities that depend critically on the dimerization states,\nsuch as 3CL protease,51 or for creating\nmultifunctional proteins that can be used to make protein-based hydrogels.52\n\nWe further challenge the capability of SpyX modules to mechanically\ninterlock fusion proteins by installing elastin-like protein domains\nonto both termini of the SpyX domain. Elastin-like proteins are intrinsically\ndisordered proteins (IDPs) with random-coil-like conformations in\nsolution.53\u221255 Unlike folded proteins such as GB1, IDPs usually\nhave no stable ordered secondary structure in solution.56,57 They generally have much larger hydrodynamic volume than folded\nprotein counterparts. Hence, they are expected to exert considerable\nsteric hindrance on catenation owing to the excluded volume effects.\nThey are ideal models for evaluating the influence of fusion proteins\non catenation efficiency. An ELP with molecular weight of \u223c8\nkDa was attached to each of the terminus. Since the center core is\ntightly folded, it is reasonable to consider the products as 4-arm\nstar polymers. Two star protein constructs were designed and denoted\nas EAXBE and EBXAE, respectively (Figures 1, S11, and S12). Their cyclic and linear monomer controls were also designed using\nthe KP mutant of p53dim (X\u2032) as well as the DA mutant of SpyTag\n(A\u2032). Unlike A\u2032XB and BXA\u2032, the linear controls\nin this case (EA\u2032X\u2032BE and EBX\u2032A\u2032E) are\nincapable of forming intertwined dimers in solution.\n\nThe crude\nproducts of EAXBE and EBXAE were first analyzed by SEC.\nAlthough their molecular weights are identical, the samples elute\nat distinct retention volumes, suggesting distinct hydrodynamic volumes\nin solution. After SEC purification, the monomodal peaks of these\nstar proteins were compared to the corresponding cyclic and linear\ncontrols (Figure 4E).\nThe results clearly demonstrate that both EAXBE and EBXAE are dimers\nappearing at much lower retention volume relative to the cyclic and\nlinear mutants. Interestingly, the elution profiles of EAX\u2032BE\nand EA\u2032X\u2032BE overlap with each other, whereas the retention\nvolume of EBX\u2032AE is obviously larger than that of EBX\u2032A\u2032E.\nThe SDS\u2013PAGE analysis of the purified products reveals that\nboth EAXBE and EBXAE are dimers with apparent molecular weights at\n\u223c100 and \u223c120 kDa, respectively, whereas the cyclic\ncontrols appear at \u223c40 kDa and the linear control appears at\n\u223c50 kDa. Although both proteins are 4-arm stars with identical\nmolecular weights, there are still minor differences between their\ntopologies. The difference is consistent with the SEC profiles, suggesting\nthat BXA has a more expanded, much larger structure than AXB. This\ncould be rationalized based on the arm distribution on the SpyX core,\nwhich will be further elaborated later. In MALDI-TOF mass spectra,\nonly one peak could be observed for both EAXBE and EBXAE, which are\nassigned as the molecular peak with two charges [M + 2H]2+ (Figure S13). This is probably because\nthe products may have strong binding affinity to proton and, thus,\nmainly form doubly charged ions upon MALDI ionization. It may also\nhave something to do with the mechanically interlocked structure where\neach of the two noncovalently interlocked segments bears one charge.\nA similar phenomenon has been observed previously.13 This evidence\ndemonstrates that star proteins can be effectively expressed in vivo using SpyX as an interlocking module to create the\ncore.\n\nWe have shown that SpyX modules (AXB and BXA)\nare highly efficient in forming mechanically interlocked architectures\nregardless of the tethering position of the fused proteins. But the\ncatenation efficiency varies as a direct consequence of the 3D arrangement\nof A, X, and B. In general, BXA is much more effective than AXB in\nguiding the mechanical interlocking of protein chains. The dimer content\nin the crude products can be almost quantitative (up to 97% for BXA-(GB1)2). We analyzed the crystal structures of X (PDB: 1SAK) and A\u2013B\ncomplex (PDB: 4MLS) and proposed possible models for AXB and BXA as shown in Figure 5. The chain topology\nof p53dim and SpyTag/SpyCatcher complex mandates their configuration\nin three-dimensional (3D) space. For p53dim, the intertwined structure\nmakes the N-terminus and C-terminus be at same side of the folded\nstructure. For A\u2013B complex, since SpyTag and the first strand\nof SpyCatcher are arranged in parallel \u03b2-sheet configuration,\nthe N-terminus of SpyTag and the N- and C-termini of SpyCatcher domain\nare crowded on the one end of the \u03b2-barrel. This is in perfect\nalignment with the configuration of BXA (Figure 5), leading to a more compact structure and\na better positioning for efficient reaction. The catenation efficiency\nis thus much higher. However, the configuration of AXB puts A and\nB in antiparallel arrangement. It would require either one to fold\nback in the opposite direction for reconstitution and reaction (Figure 5). This slows down\nthe reaction and decreases the catenation efficiency. The trend is\nconsistent for all fusion proteins. For AXB alone, the slower reaction\nbetween A and B leads to the accumulation of telechelic proteins,\nand thus, the intermolecular reactions are promoted to give more chain-extended\nproducts (Figure 2A).\nThe overall catenation efficiency was merely \u223c59%. For fusion\nproteins containing AXB, the tethered proteins exert significant steric\nhindrance due to excluded volume effect to discourage the intermolecular\nover intramolecular reactions, leading to higher catenation efficiency.\nThe effect is most evident if SpyTag is located between the protein\nof interest and p53dim domain. Therefore, (GB1)2-AXB has\na higher catenation efficiency (\u223c73%) than AXB-(GB1)2 (\u223c66%). A similar trend has also been observed in the BXA\nmodule, as shown by the higher catenation efficiency in BXA-(GB1)2 (\u223c83%) than (GB1)2-BXA (76%). This is somewhat\ncounterintuitive, yet not surprising since changing the location of\nSpyTag to the middle of the chain has been previously shown to increase\nthe yield of tadpole proteins.12 The 3D\nconfiguration of AXB and BXA is the origin of the difference in retention\nvolumes of various fusion proteins. For AXB, both N- and C-termini\npoint to the same side of the \u03b2-barrel and the tethered proteins\nare thus quite crowded, leading to a compact structure and a smaller\nhydrodynamic volume. For BXA, the N-terminus and C-terminus are pointing\nto the opposite ends of the \u03b2-barrel of the A\u2013B complex,\nand the tethered proteins are thus more expanded in 3D space, leading\nto apparently higher hydrodynamic volume in SEC (Figure 2A). This difference is also\nconsistently observed in each pair of SpyX-containing fusion proteins.\n\nWhile the creation of different protein topologies itself\npresents\nan enormous challenge, a more fundamental question is \u201chow\ndoes the topology influence the properties and functions of proteins?\u201d\nTo address this, we first examined the protein catenanes of AXB and\nBXA in comparison to the linear and cyclic controls. As revealed by\nDSC thermogram (Figure S14), both catenanes\nand cyclic monomers exhibit a dramatic increase in melting point (Tm) (\u223c86 \u00b0C) as compared to the linear\nmonomers (\u223c62 \u00b0C). Thermal stability improvement from\ncyclic protein to catenane is relatively minor, probably because the\nprotein is already very stable. The AXB and AX\u2032B have almost\nthe same Tm, which is reasonable since\nthe cyclized portion is relatively small and the influence is minor.\nBy contrast, BXA and BX\u2032A are both more stable than the corresponding\nAXB and AX\u2032B. In addition, BXA exhibits a Tm about 2 \u00b0C higher than BX\u2032A. We also attempted\nto follow the thermal denaturation by circular dichroism (CD) spectrometry.\nThe CD spectra at 30 \u00b0C are shown in Figure S15. The spectra of AXB and BXA are very similar to the parent\nprotein (the CnaB2).58 The presence of\n\u03b1-helices in p53dim adds to the signal at around 220 nm. By\ncontrast, the signal around 220 nm is much weaker in the mutants AX\u2032B\nand BX\u2032A, indicating the absence of intertwined dimers in AX\u2032B\nand BX\u2032A. The temperature-dependent CD spectra (Figure S16) qualitatively agree with the DSC\nresults.\n\nOne prominent feature of star polymers is their spatially\ndefined,\ncompact 3D structure with multiple arms in space. We speculated that\nsuch a three-dimensionally crowded arrangement would impart the star\nproteins tremendous resistance toward proteolysis due to the steric\nhindrance that prevents the protease to bind and cut. The proteolytic\ndigestion experiments were performed on the star proteins as well\nas their cyclic and linear controls using trypsin under identical\nconditions with equal amounts of proteins. All of the possible trypsin\ncleavage sites in these proteins are shown in Figures S17 and S18. Most of the cleavage sites are located\nat the AXB or BXA domain, which is around the middle of the chain.\nThus, trypsin digestion would mostly break the catenanes into monomers,\nrelinearize cyclic monomers, and convert linear monomers into fragments.\nThe digestion profiles are shown in Figures 6, S19, and S20. Since the bands of cyclic monomers are smeared in SDS\u2013PAGE\nand the positions of cyclic and relinearized monomers are very close\nto each other, we could not accurately evaluate the progress of trypsin\ndigestion. Hence, the digestion of cyclic monomers is not included\nfor comparison. Meanwhile, it can be seen that star proteins are much\nmore stable than the linear controls. While only \u223c20% of EAXBE\nis degraded over 5 h, EBXAE is completely stable and shows no signs\nof degradation at all. By contrast, the linear monomers are quickly\ndigested into fragments. In both cases, only \u223c10% of the linear\nmonomers survived after 5 h of proteolysis. Considering that their\ndifferences are mostly just on topology, the stability enhancement\nby adopting the star topology is indeed remarkable.\n\nIn\nsummary, we have developed highly efficient, genetically encoded,\nmechanically interlocking SpyX modules (AXB and BXA) for engineering\nprotein topology in vivo. The expression of fusion\nproteins containing SpyX modules leads to the formation of a variety\nof mechanically interlocked protein topologies, including protein\ncatenanes, obligate dimers, and star proteins. The clustering of p53dim\nwith SpyTag/SpyCatcher ensures efficient protein chain intertwining\nand covalent fixation. The catenation efficiency was found to depend\non the configuration of three components as well as the fused protein\nof interest. The configuration also influences the stability of the\nfinal product. Generally, BXA has better catenation efficiency than\nAXB and the products containing BXA are also more stable. There are\nmany advantages in using SpyX modules for protein engineering. First\nof all, it leads to the formation of obligate dimers which would never\ndisassociate even upon high dilution and does not require the tethered\nprotein domain to possess specific protein\u2013protein interactions.\nSecond, it allows the formation of star proteins simply by direct\nexpression, which is useful as multifunctional proteins. Finally,\ntopology may enhance protein stability. For example, star proteins\nare shown to possess significantly enhanced stability against trypsin\ndigestion. The capability of SpyX modules for in vivo protein topology engineering is an extraordinary example demonstrating\nthe power of the \u201cassembly-reaction\u201d synergy. It expands\nthe scope of protein topology beyond linear configuration and serves\nas a versatile platform to further engineer the functional properties\nof proteins."}
