{"title": "Using population-wide administrative and laboratory data to estimate type-and subtype-specific influenza vaccine effectiveness: a surveillance protocol", "body": "Influenza is a respiratory viral pathogen associated with significant morbidity and mortality globally.\n\nInfections range from relatively mild presentations (e.g. cough, sore throat) to severe lower respiratory tract 87 infections (e.g. pneumonia). Severe cases may be associated with hospitalization, intensive care admission, and 88 death; young children, the elderly, and individuals with chronic conditions are at highest risk of severe \n\nIndividuals can have multiple laboratory tests over the course of their illness; therefore only the first positive 160 influenza test during the influenza season will be used, and potential control samples will be selected from 161 among those who only tested negative for influenza during that influenza season, using the first negative test.\n\nCases and controls tested <14 days after vaccination will be excluded from the analysis.\n\nInfluenza vaccination status will be determined from the Influenza Vaccination Registry. The registry 164 combines data from four databases that record influenza vaccination events (see below).\n\nThe following administrative data sets will be used in this study:\n\n166 \uf0b7 Alberta Health Immunization and Adverse Reaction to Immunization system (Imm/ARI) contains \n\nIndividuals will be considered inpatients if they have at least one physician claim for inpatient services on 192 the same day as specimen collection or if specimen collection occurred during an inpatient stay; all others 193 will be considered outpatients. Individuals with an immunocompromising condition will be defined as be determined through physician claims and MACAR. Organ transplantation will be determined using 198 MACAR, and immunocompromising drug dispensations will be identified through PIN.\n\nWe will use multivariable logistic regression to estimate influenza vaccine effectiveness as (1 -adjusted OR) x 201 100%. We will estimate VE separately by influenza season and influenza subtype (i.e., A(H3N2),\n\nA(H1N1)pdm09, and influenza B) [28] . All covariates will be considered for the adjusted model. SAS version 203 9.4 will be used for all statistical analysis (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). VE estimates will be compared to As shedding of influenza virus continues for approximately 4-5 days after symptom onset, bias can result if 206 specimens that are collected too long after symptom onset are used [29] . Most studies use a threshold of 7 207 days [30] . To test the robustness of the findings, a sensitivity analysis will be performed; controls will be 208 restricted to those specimens positive for a different respiratory virus (i.e. coronavirus, human respiratory 209 syncytial virus) (As suggested by Sullivan et al 2016) .\n\nA potential limitation to this study is that the samples utilized here are clinical isolates taken through the 211 course of normal patient care, and are not from a standard case definition as is utilized in some other studies 212 [12] . To test the robustness of the findings, the analysis will be repeated using only cases and controls that 213 were given a diagnosis code for acute respiratory infection on the same day as specimen collection, as per the 214 SESE database or MACAR. Appendix 3 lists the ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes used to define an acute respiratory 215 infection.\n\nThis protocol describes the estimation of seasonal influenza VE using specimens collected for routine 219 influenza diagnostics as well as administrative data and vaccination records.\n\nA key strength of this approach is the large sample size. This approach allows calculation of near real-time,\n\nprecise influenza VE estimates weeks prior to the influenza season peak, creating an early warning system for 222 public health if, as in the 2014-2015 season, the vaccine is found to have exceedingly low effectiveness. Early 223 notification of VE can assist public health in determining policies, messaging, and allocation of resources 224 (antiviral agents, staffing emergency departments) to counter a potentially more severe influenza season [31,\n\n225 32]. The large sample size also allows for stratified analyses of VE based on product, age group, or region. reduces non-differential misclassification, which would bias the odds ratio towards the null, thus 231 underestimating VE [12] .\n\nFinally, we are certain to capture the results of all respiratory virus testing in the province, as all respiratory 233 virus testing is centralized at ProvLab and there is limited use of point-of-care testing.\n\nThere are some limitations to this methodology compared to the traditional method of VE estimation using 235 sentinel physician networks, because a standardized clinical case definition cannot be applied to determine 236 study eligibility. A sensitivity analysis restricting to healthcare encounters with a diagnosis code for acute 237 respiratory infection will be used as a proxy for a standard case definition.\n\nWhile the inclusion of confounders is important for VE estimate adjustment, not all known confounders can 239 be measured using administrative data.
