{"title": "Human Avian Influenza: How Ready Are We?", "body": "ens to be more widespread in humans than the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreaks that occurred in 2003 and has the potential to become the first true global pandemic of the 21st century. Should a pandemic occur, the role of health care providers will be challenged.\n\nNot since the identification of HIV and AIDS will the duty to care be tested as during such an event (Ruderman et al., 2006) . Recent data indicate that mixed views still exist in the United States regarding the duty to care for patients during infectious disease (Alexander & Wynia, 2003) . However, in their recent report, Ruderman et al. (2006) emphasized a number of compelling reasons for health care providers to provide care in the context of a flu pandemic. They also opened a social dialogue to ad-vance the public debate on the issue of the duty to care during infectious disease outbreaks.\n\nIn the fight against flu, forewarned is forearmed, and the current A (H5N1) situation has given the world advance warning and a rare opportunity to prepare for the next pandemic. Knowledge and informed opinion regarding the risk of pandemic influenza and options to prevent and control it will prevent fear and speculation (Taubenberger & Morens, 2006) . This report provides an overview of avian influenza, including the currently circulating, highly pathogenic A (H5N1) virus and the phases of influenza pandemics. The emphasis is on what health care providers should know to be prepared for a human avian influenza outbreak and the next pandemic.\n\nInfluenza pandemics are caused by an emergence of a new influenza A virus to which there is no human immunity (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2006) . Three pandemic influenza A viruses emerged in the 20th century-the \"Spanish influenza\" A (H1N1) virus in 1918, the \"Asian influenza\" A (H2N2) virus in 1957, and the \"Hong Kong influenza\" A (H3N2) virus in 1968. All three pandemics spread rapidly around the world; however, only the 1918 virus was associated with a high mortality, killing an estimated 20 to 50 million people worldwide (Belshe, 2005) . The latest outbreaks of avian A (H5N1) influenza in Asia, Europe, and Africa have scientists concerned that the currently circulating, highly pathogenic A (H5N1) avian influenza virus could emerge to be as deadly as the 1918 influenza A virus (Holmes, Taubenberger, & Grenfell, 2005; Stohr, 2005; Taubenberger et al., 2005) .\n\nAlthough avian influenza A (H5N1) is presently the virus of greatest concern, the possibility cannot be ruled out that other avian influenza viruses known to infect humans might cause a pandemic (World Health Organization [WHO], 2006a). To be prepared for a pandemic, the WHO has outlined three periods and six stages of a pandemic in its 2005 publication, WHO Global Influenza Preparedness Plan. The three periods are interpandemic, pandemic alert, and pandemic ( Figure 1 ). The interpandemic period has two phases. Phase 1 occurs when the virus subtype is present in animals but the risk to humans is minimal. In Phase 2, a circulating animal influenza virus subtype poses a substantial risk to humans (WHO, 2005) .\n\nThe pandemic alert period begins with Phase 3, in which human infections occur with a new virus subtype but no human-to-human spread or rare instances of spread to close contacts have occurred. Phases 4 and 5 occur during the pandemic alert period in which (a) larger clusters of influenza have occurred but human-to-human spread is still localized and (b) the virus is becoming increasingly better adapted to humans and is not yet fully transmissible but is a substantial pandemic risk. The pandemic period and Phase 6 occurs with increased and sustained transmission in the general population. Each phase corresponds with recommended activities to be undertaken by the WHO, the international community, governments, and industry. Changes from one phase to another are initiated by several factors that include the epidemiological activities of the disease and the characteristics of circulating viruses (WHO, 2005) .\n\nThe WHO has drafted a pandemic influenza rapid response and containment protocol that aims to stop or at least slow the spread of pandemic influenza at the source to minimize global morbidity and mortality (WHO, 2006h) . More on the WHO approach to the management of an influenza pandemic can be located on the WHO avian influenza website at http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/en/.\n\nIn addition to the WHO Global Influenza Preparedness Plan ( Strategic Plan, identifies key roles of DHHS and its agencies in a pandemic and provides planning assumptions for federal, state, and local governments and public health operations plans (U.S. DHHS, 2005b) .\n\nPart 2 of the DHHS Influenza Plan, Public Health Guidance for State and Local Partners, provides recommendations for specific aspects of pandemic influenza planning and response for the development of state and local preparedness plans (U.S. DHHS, 2005c) . The DHHS and the CDC have developed pandemic preparedness checklists for all health care settings, which are modeled according to pandemic preparedness for hospitals. Part 2 describes a coordinated public health and medical care strategy to prepare for and begin responding to an influenza pandemic. Given the variety of health care settings, individual medical offices and clinics may need to adapt the checklists to meet their unique needs (U.S. DHHS, 2005c) .\n\nMore information on the guidelines to assist health care providers, service organizations, schools, and businesses in planning for a pandemic outbreak can be located on the DHHS pandemic flu web site at: http://www.pandemicflu.gov.\n\nAvian influenza viruses infect birds; thus their name. The natural reservoir for avian influenza viruses is wild waterfowl and reside in the gastrointestinal tract of these birds. As a result, virus-loaded droppings of wild waterfowl contaminate water supplies where domestic and other birds can become infected with the virus. Contact with the secretions and excretions of domestic poultry places humans at risk for acquiring avian influenza.\n\nInfluenza A is an RNA virus that is 1/10,000 mm in diameter and has a membrane containing a genome with two differently shaped protrusions on the surface of the virus (see Figure 2 ). Two surface antigens, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), which are the basis of influenza A subtypes, are located on the protrusions of the virus. It is these protrusions that bind the virus to the target cell and effectively become hidden from the immune system of the affected individual. Although influenza A has 16 HA subtypes and 9 NA subtypes, historically only viruses of the H1, H2, and H3 subtypes were known to cause the pathogenic form of influenza in humans (Barry, 2004) . However, all 16 HA and 9 NA subtypes of influenza viruses are known to infect wild waterfowl, providing an extensive reservoir of influenza viruses continuously circulating in bird populations (WHO, 2006a) .\n\nInfluenza A viruses reproduce, adapt, and mutate faster than most viruses. For example, antigenic drift (see Figure 3 ), a gradual genetic change in the virus, requires a new vaccine against currently circulating influenza A (and B) viruses each influenza season (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [NIAID], 2006a). Avian viruses, which are different than seasonal influenza A viruses, generally must mutate or adapt to humans through an intermediate host before there can be transmission to humans. This is known as antigenic shift, which is an abrupt change in the hemagglutinin or neuraminidase of the virus and results in a new subtype of influenza A. Antigenic shift can occur in one of three ways: (a) from wild waterfowl to humans through genetic change in an intermediate host such as a chicken or pig, and a human virus infects the intermediate host at the same time (reassortment); (b) directly from waterfowl to humans without genetic change; or (c) from waterfowl to an intermediate host without genetic change (see Figure 4) . A new subtype of influenza A virus may further evolve to spread from human to human. If this occurs, a pandemic virus to which humans have no immunity can emerge (NIAID, 2006a) .\n\nIn both the 1957 and 1968 pandemics, a new influenza virus emerged because of reassortment events involving two influenza viruses, an avian influenza virus and a human influenza virus, which resulted in the emergence of a new influenza virus (Belshe, 2005) . However, Taubenberger et al. (2005) identified that the 1918 virus did not evolve through a reassortment event involving a human influenza virus but more likely was an entirely avianlike virus that adapted to humans, causing person-to-person spread and a pandemic.\n\nThe incubation period for human avian influenza is longer than that of seasonal influenza, which generally is 2 or 3 days. Current data for human A (H5N1) infection indicate an incubation period ranging from 2 to 8 days and possibly as long as 17 days. However, the possibility of multiple exposures to the virus makes it difficult to precisely define the incubation period. The WHO currently recommends that an incubation period of 7 days be used for monitoring of patient contacts (WHO, 2006a; 2006g) .\n\nIn many patients the disease caused by the A (H5N1) virus follows an unusually aggressive clinical course, with rapid deterioration and high fatality. It also affects previously healthy young individuals. Like most emerging infectious diseases, A (H5N1) influenza in humans is not well-understood. And although clinical data from cases in 1997 and the current outbreaks are beginning to provide a picture of the clinical features of the disease, that picture could change given the unpredictably of this virus and its ability to mutate rapidly (WHO, 2006a).\n\nBefore 1997, avian A (H5N1) influenza virus was not of much concern because it rarely infected humans. However, in 1997 an epidemic of A (H5N1) influenza in humans was reported in Hong Kong with 18 confirmed cases and 6 deaths. This was the first time transmission of an avian influenza virus directly from infected domestic birds to humans had been reported. A second outbreak among live bird markets was reported again in Hong Kong in 2001, but no human cases occurred because of swift action by the Hong Kong government to cull infected chickens and remove the source of the virus. In 2003, highly pathogenic A (H5N1) appeared again in China and Hong Kong. Two cases of avian influenza A (H5N1) infection occurred among members of a Hong Kong family that had traveled to China. One person recovered, the other died. It was not determined how or where these two family members were infected, but another family member died of an undiagnosed respiratory illness in China. Unfortunately, no testing was done on this latter family member (CDC, 2006) .\n\nOf all influenza viruses that circulate in birds, the A (H5N1) virus is currently of greatest concern for two reasons. The second concern is that the A (H5N1) virus has met all prerequisites for the start of a pandemic except one: an ability to spread efficiently among humans. To date, human-to-human transmission has been questioned in rare cases (Ungchusak et al., 2005) . To date, the evidence indicates that close contact with dead or sick birds or their droppings is the principal source of human infection with the A (H5N1) virus. Nonetheless, avian influenza H5N1 has pandemic potential because it might ultimately adapt into a strain that is contagious among humans. Once this adaptation occurs, it will no longer be a bird virus-it will be a human influenza virus to which there is no immunity (WHO, 2006f) . Because of the concerns regarding the aggressive spread of the A (H5N1) virus between 2003 and 2005, in November 2005 the WHO declared a Phase 3 pandemic alert: a new influenza virus subtype is causing disease in humans, but is not yet sustainable and spreading efficiently among humans (see Figure 3 ) (WHO, 2006d) .\n\nOnce a pandemic starts, everyone exposed will be at risk. Although it is not known what kind of an impact a pandemic influenza virus would have on people who are already immunosuppressed as a result of HIV/AIDS, in pandemics of the past those most severely affected have been those who are most affected during seasonal flu outbreaks. These include the very young, the elderly, the chronically ill, and those with compromised immune systems (WHO, 2005) .\n\nThe astute clinician will detect avian influenza in patients through a travel and contact history during assessment. Testing for A (H5N1) influenza in hospitalized or ambulatory patients should be considered on a case-by-case basis in consultation with state and local health departments for patients with a documented temperature of over 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), and one or more of the following: cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, along with a history of contact with domestic poultry (e.g., visited a poultry farm, household raising poultry, or bird market) or a known or suspected human case of influenza A (H5N1) in an H5N1-affected country within 10 days of symptom onset. Testing for influenza A (H5N1) is indicated in hospitalized patients in the United States who have (a) a history of travel to a country with documented H5N1 avian influenza in poultry and/or humans and (b) radiographically confirmed pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or other severe respiratory illness for which an alternate diagnosis has not been established. (CDC, 2004a) .\n\nThe following WHO case definitions for human cases of A (H5N1) infection apply to the current phase of pandemic alert (Phase 3) and may change as new information about the disease or its epidemiology evolves (WHO, 2006g) .\n\nA suspected A (H5N1) case is a person presenting with unexplained acute lower respiratory illness with temperature higher than 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F) and cough, shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing and one or more of the following exposures in the 7 days before symptom onset: a. Close (within 3 feet) contact with (e.g., caring for, speaking with, or touching) a person who is a suspected, probable, or confirmed A (H5N1) case. b. Exposure to (e.g., handling, slaughtering, defeathering, butchering, preparation for consumption) poultry or wild birds or their remains or to environments contaminated by their feces in an area where A (H5N1) infections in animals or humans have been suspected or confirmed in the last month. c. Consumption of raw or undercooked poultry products in an area where A (H5N1) infections in animals or humans have been suspected or confirmed in the last month. d. Close contact with a confirmed A (H5N1) infected animal other than poultry or wild birds (e.g., cat or pig). e. Handling samples (animal or human) suspected of containing A (H5N1) virus in a laboratory or other setting.\n\nProbable case (notify WHO): Probable A (H5N1) case definition 1 is a person meeting the criteria for a suspected case, and one of the following additional criteria: a. Infiltrates or evidence of an acute pneumonia on chest radiograph plus evidence of respiratory failure (hypoxemia, severe tachypnea). b. Positive laboratory confirmation of an influenza A infection but insufficient laboratory evidence for A (H5N1) infection.\n\nProbable A (H5N1) case definition 2 is a person dying of an unexplained acute respiratory illness who is epidemiologically linked by time, place, and exposure to a probable or confirmed A (H5N1) case.\n\nA confirmed A (H5N1) case is a person meeting the criteria for a suspected or probable case and one of the following positive results conducted in a national, regional or international influenza laboratory whose A (H5N1) test results are accepted by WHO: a. Isolation of an H5N1 virus. b. Positive H5 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results from tests using two different PCR targets, for example, primers specific for influenza A and H5 HA. c. A fourfold or greater rise in an antibody titer for H5N1 based on testing of an acute serum specimen (determined 7 days or less after onset of symptoms) and a convalescent serum specimen with an antibody titer of 1:80 or higher. d. An antibody titer for H5N1 of 1:80 or greater in a single serum specimen determined at day 14 or later after symptom onset and a positive result using a different serological assay (e.g., an H5-specific Western blot positive result).\n\nThere currently is no available human vaccine against avian influenza. However, preliminary results of clinical trials for a vaccine against A (H5N1) in healthy adults are promising and are still in progress (NIAID, 2006b; Treanor, Campbell, Zangwill, Rowe, & Wolff, 2006; WHO, 2006a) . But experts warn that a pandemic virus may evolve that is not susceptible to an H5N1 vaccine. Preparation of a vaccine for a new virus takes several months and will not be available to prevent the spread of a new virus during the early months of the first wave of a pandemic. In addition, current global production capacity falls far short of the demand expected during a pandemic (WHO, 2006a) .\n\nIn suspected cases of avian influenza, patients should be treated as soon as possible (ideally, within 48 hours following symptom onset) with oseltamivir (manufactured by Hoffmann-LaRoche, Inc., Nutley, NJ, as Tamiflu) to maximize its therapeutic effect. However, given the high fatality rate currently associated with A (H5N1) infection and evidence of prolonged viral replication in this disease, administration of the drug should be considered in patients presenting later in the course of illness (WHO, 2006a) . The recommended doses of oseltamivir for the treatment of avian influenza are outlined on the manufacturer's website: http://www.rocheusa.com/ products/tamiflu/pi.pdf.\n\nRecommended interventions for avian influenza in the community include isolation of patients and quarantine of contacts accompanied by antiviral therapy. However, during a WHO pandemic period (Phase 6), the focus shifts to delaying spread and reducing risk through population-based measures. These involve nonpharmaceutical interventions, which suggest that ill persons remain home at the first sign of symptoms of influenza, but add that forced isolation and quarantine are ineffective and impractical. If the pandemic is severe, social gatherings and school closures should be considered. Nonessential domestic travel to affected areas also should be deferred. Hand and respiratory hygiene should be routine, along with disinfection of contaminated household surfaces; the use of masks should be based on the setting and risk (WHO Writing Group, 2006) .\n\nThe CDC and WHO have developed precautions to protect health care providers world-wide who care for patients with known or suspected avian influenza (CDC, 2004b; WHO, 2006c) . Health care providers in all health care settings should implement respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette and use standard and droplet precautions with symptomatic patients (CDC, 2003; 2004c; 2004d) .\n\nIn addition to standard, droplet, and contact precautions, the CDC and the WHO recommend the following precautions:\n\n\u2022 Patients with a history of travel within 10 days to a country with avian influenza activity and are admitted to a hospital with a severe febrile ( should use a fit-tested N-95 disposable respirator during intubation/respiratory treatment of patients suspected of or with symptoms of avian influenza (WHO, 2006c) .\n\nIn addition to these precautions, the CDC recommends vaccination of health care providers against seasonal influenza. Historically, influenza vaccination among health care providers is typically less than 40%. However, these rates must be increased because seasonal influenza vaccination not only provides protection against the predominant circulating influenza strains, it reduces the risk of health care providers being coinfected with human and avian influenza strains whereby genetic reassortment could take place and lead to the emergence of a potential pandemic strain (CDC, 2004b) .\n\nSurveillance and monitoring of health care providers for exposure to avian influenza should be ongoing during an avian influenza outbreak. Health care providers who develop fever, respiratory symptoms, and/or conjunctivitis should be advised to stay home until 24 hours after resolution of fever unless an alternative diagnosis is established or diagnostic tests are negative for influenza A virus (CDC, 2004b; WHO, 2006c) .\n\nThe primary strategies for preventing pandemic influenza are the same as those for seasonal influenza: vaccination, early detection and treatment with antiviral medications, and the use of infection control measures to prevent transmission during patient care. However, when a pandemic begins, a vaccine may not yet be available, and the supply of antiviral drugs may be limited. Therefore, application of infection control measures during a pandemic is essential. Pandemic influenza infection control practices in health care settings are similar to those outlined previously for avian influenza. Specific recommendations can be located on the DHHS website at http://www.hhs. gov/pandemicflu/plan/sup4.html#s4-IV.\n\nInfluenza pandemics are inevitable. Many experts believe that the SARS outbreaks in 2003 were a prologue to the next flu pandemic, possibly from an avian influenza virus (Stohr, 2005) . Since the SARS outbreaks, serious concerns about the extent to which health care providers would tolerate risks of infection have been raised (Ruderman et al, 2006) . Nonetheless, the expertise of health care providers is an integral part of the response to a pandemic. No other profession can be legitimately expected to fulfill this role and to assume this level of risk (Ruderman et al., 2006) . Health care providers can be prepared for avian influenza and a potential pandemic by becoming familiar with the lessons learned from the SARS outbreaks such as case detection, reporting, clear and timely dissemination of information, and strict infection control measures in handling an infectious disease outbreak and the procedures that prevented the spread of SARS virus (Abdullah, Tomlinson, Cockram, & Thomas, 2003; Weinstein, 2005) .\n\nHIV/AIDS has taught us the importance of remaining vigilant to the devastation of naturally arising epidemics, which can have profound effects not only on individuals, but also on whole nations and regions. The economic and social disruption that often follows an infectious disease outbreak . . . can be a major destabilizing force for any nation. The challenge is to keep our concerns and responses in reasonable balance. We must also understand that factors in society, the environment, and our global interconnectedness actually increase the likelihood of the ongoing emergence and spread of infectious diseases (Institute of Medicine, 2005, pp. 2-3)."}
