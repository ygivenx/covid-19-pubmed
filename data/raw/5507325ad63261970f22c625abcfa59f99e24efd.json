{"title": "Concerted 2-5A-Mediated mRNA Decay and Transcription Reprogram Protein Synthesis in dsRNA Response", "body": "The innate immune system is activated without the delay needed for antibody production and provides an immediate defense barrier against infections and out-ofcontrol host cells posing danger. In higher vertebrates, the innate immune system relies on interferon (IFN) signaling coupled with a vertebrae-specific pathway of regulated RNA degradation, 2-5A-mediated decay (2-5AMD) (Chakrabarti et al., 2011; Cooper et al., 2014b; Rath et al., 2015) . 2-5AMD is activated in the presence of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), a pathogen-associated and damageassociated molecular pattern that signals the presence of viruses (Li et al., 2016) and pathologic derepression of endogenous repeat elements of the host (Chiappinelli et al., 2015; Leonova et al., 2013; Li et al., 2017) .\n\n2-5AMD requires the coordinated activity of 2-5A oligonucleotide synthetases (OASs) and the pseudokinase-endoribonuclease, RNase L. The action of the OASs closely parallels that action of a structurally similar dsDNA sensor cGAS. cGAS synthesizes a second messenger cGAMP (cyclic-G 2',5' A 3',5' p) to activate the IFN response via the cGAMP receptor, STING (Civril et al., 2013) . The OASs use the same mechanism of regulation, but function as sensors of dsRNA (Civril et al., 2013; Donovan et al., 2013) . The OASs synthesize the second messenger 2-5A (5'-ppp-A 2'p5' A( 2'p5' A) n\u22650 ) facilitates its dimerization and high-order oligomerization, which provides the switch for activation of RNA cleavage by 2-5AMD (Han et al., 2014; Han et al., 2012) . Upon activation, RNase L cleaves single-stranded RNA molecules at UN^N sites (Floyd-Smith et al., 1981; Han et al., 2014) . The prevalence of this short motif results in 2-5AMD sensitivity of many tRNAs, rRNAs, mRNAs, Y-RNAs and vault RNAs (Cooper et al., 2014b; . During homeostasis, 2-5AMD regulates adhesion and migration activity of mammalian cells (Banerjee et al., 2015; Rath et al., 2015) . Upon acute activation by dsRNA, 2-5AMD arrests global translation by an immediate and poorly understood mechanism (Alisha Chitrakar et al., 2018; . In mammalian cells, dsRNA inhibits translation not only via 2-5AMD, but also via phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2\uf061 by the serine-threonine kinase protein kinase R (PKR) (Fig. 1A ). 2-5AMD and the PKR pathway are separated in time and in A549 human lung epithelial cells, 2-5AMD is the only mechanism responsible for the rapid translational inhibition .\n\nInitial studies of 2-5AMD in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) reported polysome disaggregation and degradation of mRNAs (Clemens and Williams, 1978) . RRL does not have transcription, which limits biologic interpretations of these results: in the cellfree system, the loss of mRNAs and polysomes due to a non-specific RNase is inevitable. In live cells, 2-5AMD has sufficient potency to cause degradation of 18S and 28S rRNAs. The characteristic rRNA cleavage pattern provides a reliable readout of RNase L activation Malathi et al., 2007) . Furthermore, 2-5AMD causes degradation of tRNA-His and tRNA-Pro, as well as multiple mRNAs in live cells (Al-Ahmadi et al., 2009; Le Roy et al., 2007; Rath et al., 2015) .\n\n.

It . https: //doi.org/10.1101/484675 doi: bioRxiv preprint Due to the complexity of the RNA degradation program, the arrest of global translation by 2-5AMD could not be linked to any specific RNA (Alisha Chitrakar et al., 2018; .\n\nShortly after activation of 2-5AMD, dsRNA triggers the transcriptional IFN response, leading to upregulation of innate immune mRNAs (Fig. 1A ) (Alisha Chitrakar et al., 2018; Kawai et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2008) . While global translation remains silenced by actively ongoing 2-5AMD, the mRNAs encoding the interferons IFN-\u03b2 (type I) and IFN-\uf06c (type III) bypass the global inhibition and are actively translated (Alisha Chitrakar et al., 2018) . Here we employ cell biology, proteomics, transcriptomics and modeling approaches to determine the translation reprogramming mechanism of 2-5AMD and to explain how innate immune mRNAs can evade the translational arrest.\n\nTo begin deciphering the mechanism of protein synthesis regulation 2-5AMD, we examined whether it affects polysomes in WT and RNase L -/cells by sucrose gradient sedimentation. In the presence of immunogenic dsRNA (poly-I:C), the 80S monosome peak became dominant within 30 minutes, whereas polysomes progressively and accumulation of the 80S monosomes during 2-5AMD is a signature of inhibited initiation of capped mRNAs. A similar polysome change takes place upon deletion of the RNA helicase DHX29 involved in recognition of the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) (Parsyan et al., 2009) or inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) that maintains translation initiation active (Gandin et al., 2014) . The 80S species that form upon DHX29 and mTOR defects are non-translating, as are the 80S species formed during 2-5AMD ( Fig. 1C; Fig. S1A ). Non-translating 80S species devoid of mRNA form readily in A549 cells following translation release with puromycin ( Inhibition of mTOR kinase is a common strategy to arrest bulk translation during stress responses (Hsieh et al., 2012; Zoncu et al., 2011) , suggesting that inhibition of translation initiation by 2-5AMD could depend on mTOR. To test this link, we assessed mTOR activity by measuring phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor 4E-BP1 whose phosphorylation by mTOR is required for translation initiation (Feldman et al., 2009 ). Activation of 2-5AMD did not affect 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, whereas a control treatment with the small molecule mTOR inhibitor INK128 (Feldman et al., 2009) worked (Fig. 2B ). Considering that 2-5A and INK128 inhibited bulk translation comparably but with different effects on 4E-BP1 phosphorylation ( Fig. 2A-B) , our data suggest that 2-5AMD inhibits translation initiation independently from mTOR.\n\nTo test whether 2-5AMD disrupts assembly of cap binding initiation complexes, we pulled down the cap-binding initiation factor eIF4E and examined its association with .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/484675 doi: bioRxiv preprint the key partner factors eIF4A and eIF4G that together form the eIF4F complex. This tripartite complex was readily identified using the pulldown and remained unchanged by 2-5AMD (Fig. 2C ). Total RNA profiling by NanoChip revealed that eIF4E additionally pulled down the 40S ribosomal subunit both in na\u00efve cells and in cells with activated 2-5AMD, suggesting normal loading of the small subunit. As expected, 18S and 28S rRNAs were degraded during 2-5AMD and exhibited the characteristic pattern of RNase L activity (Fig. 2D ). The 18S rRNA from the 40S subunit pulled down with eIF4E following 2-5AMD was cleaved as in the input rRNA. Thus, binding of the core components of the translation initiation complex is not disrupted during 2-5AMD.\n\nTo examine the initiation complex more completely, we performed mass spectrometry (MS) of proteins that co-purify with eIF4E (Fig. S2 ). This analysis detected ribosomal proteins from the small subunit, translation initiation factors and poly-A binding proteins, but not proteins from the large ribosomal subunit, as expected due to polysome run off. The identified components did not change in response to 2-5A ( Fig.   2E ; Table S1 ), indicating 2-5AMD does not block the cap-binding complex and capmediated loading of the small ribosomal subunit.\n\n2-5AMD does not interfere with the initiation step. To further define the mechanism, we analyzed the hallmark substrate of RNase L, the ribosome, and examined whether 2-5AMD inhibits global translation by directly affecting the ribosomal translation activity. 18S and 28S rRNAs are both cleaved by RNase L (Fig. 2D ) Malathi et al., 2007) . Although a high-resolution structure of the . CC-BY 4.0 International license is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/484675 doi: bioRxiv preprint human 80S ribosome has become available (Khatter et al., 2015) , mechanistic understanding of how rRNA cleavage by 2-5AMD could affect the ribosome is critically limited by the absence of reliable mapping of the cleavage sites. Based on primer extension analysis it has been proposed that RNase L cleaves nucleotides 4032, and to a smaller extent 4031, in 28S rRNA (Iordanov et al., 2000) . In contrast, subsequent RNA-seq analyses of cleaved rRNAs captured using Arabidopsis tRNA ligase did not detect cleavage at either of the 28S rRNA sites, but observed predominantly RNase Lindependent 18S/28S rRNA background cleavage events (Cooper et al., 2014b) .\n\nTo de novo identify the cleavage sites in human rRNA, we adapted RtcB RNAseq suitable for single-nucleotide resolution mapping . RtcB RNAseq analysis of rRNA from cells with activated 2-5AMD ( Fig. S3A ) revealed cleavage sites with a UN^N consensus (Fig. 3A ) that distinguishes the sequence-specific activity of RNase L (Table S2 ) Han et al., 2014) . We analyzed the data to identify predominant sites that simultaneously exhibit induction and high read count in the 2-5AMD sample, as shown in Figure 3A . A single high-scoring site 771 was detected in 18S rRNA and two dominant sites, 1056 and 4032, were detected in 28S rRNA. Our analysis detected both 28S rRNA sites 4031 and 4032 identified previously by primer extension assay (Iordanov et al., 2000) , providing important validation for the RtcB RNA-seq approach. The dominant sites 771 (18S) and 1056 (28S) were detected for the first time.\n\nMapping of the identified sites onto the 3D structure of human rRNA shows that except for the nucleotides 4031/4032 in the L1 stalk, 2-5AMD targets surface loops away from vital parts of the ribosome. The location of sensitive sites at distant ribosomal positions suggests that 2-5AMD is not optimized for targeting a defined ribosomal position, as observed with bona fide ribosome-inactivating nucleases such as \uf061-sarcin (Gluck et al., 1994; Korennykh et al., 2006) . The RNase L cleavage sites appear opportunistic rather than intended for ribosomal inhibition.\n\nTo test this prediction, we directly assessed the translation activity of the cleaved ribosomes in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL). We depleted this lysate of ribosomes by centrifugation (Fig. S3B ) and re-supplied intact ribosomes purified from RRL, A549 cells, or cleaved ribosomes from dsRNA-transfected human cells (Fig. 3C ). Using capped luciferase mRNA translation as the readout, we assessed the activity of each ribosome type. In ribosome-depleted RRL, luciferase translation was absent, suggesting that we obtained a suitable assay. Addition of either rabbit ribosomes from nucleasetreated RRL, intact human ribosomes, or human ribosomes with rRNA degraded by 2-5AMD, readily supported translation. We observed the same specific activity for intact and cleaved ribosomes, which we reproduced over a range of ribosomal concentrations to exclude saturation effects (Fig. 3C ). Therefore, 2-5AMD does not functionally damage human ribosomes even after a nearly complete degradation of full-length rRNA (Fig. 3C, last lane) . In agreement with this observation, the single-exponential decay kinetics for rRNA lags behind the kinetics of translational shutdown (Fig. 3D ). Our data and the previously reported disconnect between rRNA cleavage and translation together indicate that the loss of global translation during 2-5AMD involves a process physically distinct from rRNA degradation.\n\n.

Cleavage of a tRNA would satisfy this criterion, and tRNA cleavage has been previously demonstrated . However, even the most sensitive tRNAs were intact at the time of translational inhibition, suggesting that the only RNA substrates that could account for the translational inhibition are mRNAs. RNase L has been shown to cleave exogenous mRNAs, viral mRNAs and select host mRNAs with a preference for longer RNAs with many AU-rich elements due to the specificity of RNase L for UN^N sites (Al-Ahmadi et al., 2009; Le Roy et al., 2007; Nogimori et al., 2018; Rath et al., 2015) . To produce the uniform loss of global translation by mRNA decay, 2-5AMD must act similarly on all housekeeping mRNAs. Indeed, there are no protein bands or protein groups that stand out during the time-dependent progressive loss of translation (Fig. 1C , S1A-B).\n\nTo test whether a uniform mRNA decay is taking place, we used qPCR that we designed to detect full-length mRNAs (Fig. 4A ). Using this assay we observed a rapid decay of a several abundant basal mRNAs (Fig. 4B ). As expected, the decay was absent in RNase L -/cells (Fig. S4A ). All tested mRNAs were cleaved rapidly. The decay traces for all mRNAs leveled before 100% cleavage, suggesting that cells have 2-5AMD-sensitive and 2-5AMD-resistant mRNA pools. The size of the resistant fraction was higher for PRKDC and SON mRNAs (Fig. 4B , dotted lines). By quantifying loglinear regions of the data (Fig. 4B , inset graphs), we determined first-order decay .

The housekeeping mRNAs decay considerably faster than rRNA, and on the same time scale as the translational arrest ( Fig. 3D vs 4C ).\n\nUsing poly-A + RNA-seq we extended our analysis to the transcriptome. Widely used RNA-seq normalization and differential expression analysis techniques presume that levels of most mRNAs remain unchanged. This assumption would be violated if 2-5AMD inhibited translation by global mRNA decay. To correctly quantify mRNA levels during the course of decay, we supplemented our RNA samples with internal standards Of note, evaluation of RNase L activity in cytosolic cell extracts showed that mRNA decay depends on both, mRNA length and AU content (Fig.   S5 ). In S10 cytosolic extracts treated with 2-5A, at the time point when ~60% ACTB mRNA still remains, only 0.1% of FAT1 mRNA and 0.2% of PRKDC mRNAs survive ( Fig. 5C ). The high sensitivity of FAT1 and PRKDC transcripts in the S10 extract is in line with their lower GC content and greater length leading to more net UN^N sites per mRNA. In contrast to these findings, 2-5AMD in live cells shows no dependence on GC .

Therefore, cellular mRNA decay agrees with the fast timing of translational inhibition and the loss of global protein synthesis.\n\nSpike-in RNA-seq indicates that the 2-5AMD-sensitive RNAs that decay (Fig. 6A , 88-89% of poly-A + RNA) account for more than 99.7% of protein synthesis (Fig. 1C , S1A). These data suggest that RNase L eliminates the most actively translating mRNAs. As much as 11-12% of the poly-A + RNA is resistant (Fig. 6A ), indicating that resistant mRNAs must be shielded from RNase L, perhaps by being in the nucleus, in phase-separated complexes or in stress granules. The pool of RNase L-resistant poly-A + transcripts is enriched with non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs; Fig. 6A ), suggesting that translation could render mRNAs more sensitive to RNase L compared to ncRNAs. The potential dependence on translation appears to be in line with the recently proposed model for translation-dependent RNase L cleavage based on analysis of decay of exogenous RNA (Nogimori et al., 2018) .\n\nAs basal mRNAs decay, defense mRNAs encoding IFNs and ISGs are upregulated (Fig. 6A ). The mRNAs are initially absent, but by four hours IFN/ISG mRNAs account for 25% of the poly-A + pool. In log-linear coordinates, the loss of basal mRNAs and the increase in innate immune transcripts obeys a linear law (Fig. 6C,   S7A ). The induction of defense transcripts bypasses RNase L ( Fig. 6D ; S6A; S7A), as previously reported (Alisha Chitrakar et al., 2018) . To test whether defense mRNAs .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/484675 doi: bioRxiv preprint could survive in the presence of RNase L, we measured their decay kinetics during 2-5AMD in the presence of actinomycin D treatment, which was used to stop new transcription (Fig. 6E ). RNase L-dependent decay of the innate immune mRNAs was readily detected ( Fig. 6F ; S6B), indicating that defense mRNAs can be cleaved by RNase L. However, the decay half-lives (T 1/2 ) for defense mRNAs were ~2-3-fold longer compared to those of basal mRNAs (Fig. 6F ).\n\nThe log-linear decay of basal mRNAs indicates that 2-5AMD degrades these transcripts with single-exponential kinetics. In contrast, the log-linear increase of IFN/ISG mRNAs does not match single-exponential accumulation or steady influx laws, and indicates induction with a positive feedback ( The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/484675 doi: bioRxiv preprint from 2-5AMD. In contrast, protection is observed once a stable activator is included in the positive feedback loop (Fig. 7C ). The protection arises from the inherent resistance of proteins (IFNs, phosphorylated STAT) to RNase L. IFN proteins steadily accumulate and promote increasing transcriptional activity even in the presence of 2-5AMD. The evasion from 2-5AMD is further enhanced once 2.6-fold greater mRNA stability is incorporated in the model (Fig. 7D ). Our modeling results show that longer half-lives of defense mRNAs, as well as, independently, a positive feedback loop built around a stable activator can result in evasion of defense mRNAs from global decay.\n\nOur work suggests that in mammalian cells decay of abundant mRNAs can be efficiently coupled with a kinetically matched transcriptional response to steer translation toward stress proteins. Since the discovery of translational inhibition by 2-5AMD in 1977 (Hovanessian et al., 1977) , various hypotheses have been proposed to explain how this mechanism contributes to the IFN response and how mammals may use 2-5AMD to cope with stress conditions associated with dsRNA. The hypothesized functions ranged from antiviral defense due to viral RNA decay (Cooper et al., 2014a; Han et al., 2004; Nilsen and Baglioni, 1979) to IFN amplification by cleaved self-RNAs (Malathi et al., 2007) or destruction of host RNAs as a mechanism to kill infected cells during the late pro-apoptotic stages of dsRNA sensing (Chakrabarti et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 1997) . The observations that 2-5AMD can begin early and precede the IFN response, and that IFNs The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/484675 doi: bioRxiv preprint investigation. Our model, based on analysis of 2-5AMD in human A549 cells, is summarized in Figure 7F . We show that the loss of protein synthesis can be explained by depletion of thousands of host mRNAs. The same mechanistic conclusion is made in a manuscript submitted back to back with our work (Burke et al., and Roy Parker [ref will\n\nbe added]; See not added on submission). This group too attributed the action of RNase L to global loss of mRNAs. We show that approximately 90% of the total mRNA pool (by mass) is sensitive to 2-5AMD and accounts for nearly the entire translational activity detected by both metabolic and ribopuromycilation assays. The remaining 11-12% of the poly-A + transcriptome is neither accessible to RNase L nor supporting translation, suggesting that RNase L may have a mechanism to preferentially target translationallyactive endogenous mRNAs.\n\nRNase L cleaves most basal mRNAs with similar rate constants and does not exhibit a preference for longer and AU-rich mRNAs. The uniform mRNA decay is a central feature of 2-5AMD, which is responsible for arrest of all housekeeping proteins rather than just proteins encoded by long and AU-rich mRNAs. We propose that this uniformity indicates that in live cells mRNAs are cleaved in Briggs-Haldane kinetic regime (Methods). Under Briggs-Haldane conditions, RNase L will cleave mRNAs independently of the binding (K m ) and catalytic constants (k cat ) of individual mRNAs, thereby acquiring a mechanism for uniform decay of the transcriptome. A notable feature of Briggs-Haldane regime is that once RNase L encounters an mRNA, it makes a cut before dissociating, i.e. every RNase L-mRNA binding event is productive. In cell extracts, RNase L is sensitive to length and AU content in mRNAs, indicating cleavage under Michaelis-Menten regime. Although it remains to be explained precisely how live .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/484675 doi: bioRxiv preprint cells achieve Briggs-Haldane regime, our observations could be explained by ribosomeassisted RNase L access to mRNAs. This model agrees with the recently proposed mechanism for Dom34 rescue of RNase L-ribosome complex, which postulates a translation-dependent mRNA cleavage mechanism (Nogimori et al., 2018) . If ribosome-RNase L recognition (rather than mRNA-RNase L recognition) determines kinetics mRNA decay by RNase L, 2-5AMD would target all actively translating mRNAs. Further, RNase L could dwell on translating ribosomes, which would ensure efficient cleavage of mRNAs and achieve Briggs-Haldane conditions. The decay rate constants are similar, within several-fold, for basal mRNAs and for mRNAs encoding IFNs ( Fig. 4C; 6F ). We show that once this several-fold stability advantage is coupled with the positive feedback of the IFN response, defense mRNAs become desensitized to RNase L. A minimal model with experimentally determined kinetic parameters can account for decay of basal mRNAs and explain how IFNs and ISGs can accumulate to nearly the same levels in WT and RNase L -/cells ( Fig. 7A-B) .\n\nThe experimental observation that 2-5AMD can clear the cytoplasm from unneeded host mRNAs without compromising the innate immune system suggest that, by analogy, 2-5AMD could also eliminate viral mRNAs while allowing the IFN response to develop.\n\nThe antiviral activity of RNase L poses a serious obstacle for some viruses, which evolved dedicated viral proteins to disarm 2-5AMD usually by degrading 2-5A or binding to RNase L (Drappier et al., 2018; Gusho et al., 2014) . Our data raise the possibility that some viruses may alternatively rely on replication kinetics as a strategy of escape from the innate immune action of 2-5AMD, without using inhibitory viral proteins.\n\n.

To our knowledge, the mechanism of prioritizing stress protein translation by 2-5AMD is different from mechanisms of previously described mammalian pathways. Whereas mammalian protein synthesis is usually regulated by interference with translation initiation factors (Iwasaki et al., 2016; Marques-Ramos et al., 2017; Taniuchi et al., 2016) , 2-5AMD acts directly on messenger RNAs. If global mRNA decay is matched with a complementary transcriptional response, the transcriptional induction can outpace the decay. In the described example, activation of this mechanism orchestrates cell commitment to the IFN response.\n\nRNA-seq data have been submitted to GEO database under accession ID GSE123034.\n\nThe authors thank Prof. Kevan Shokat for the gift of INK128 and helpful discussions, Dr.\n\nPaul Copeland (Rutgers University) for the gift of internal ribosome entry site (IRES)containing dual luciferase plasmid, staff at the Proteomics and Mass Spectrometry Core facility, and staff at the Genomics Core Facility at Princeton University.

To create empty 80S as a control, WT cells were pre-treated with 50 \u00b5g/mL puromycin for 20 min and the sucrose gradient buffer also contained 50 \u00b5g/ml puromycin in place of CHX. The lysate was spun through the gradient in an SW41Ti rotor in an Optima XE-100 Ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter) at 200,000 x g for two hours at 4 \u00b0C. BioComp Gradient Fractionator was used to fractionate the gradients and the 254 nm absorbance was read by an EM-1 ultraviolet monitor (BioRad).\n\nqPCR RNA was purified using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen).

Within each experiment, equal amounts (ng) of RNA were converted to cDNA using oligo-dT 18 as primer and the High Capacity Reverse Transcriptase kit (Applied Biosystems). qPCR was performed using Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Life Technologies).\n\nMagnetic protein A beads were incubated with 2 \uf06dg anti-FLAG (Sigma) or anti-eIF2\u03b1 (Santa Cruz) antibodies in IP buffer (10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (NP-40), 1x complete protease inhibitor cocktail, RNase inhibitor) at 4\u00b0C for two hours. Excess unbound antibody was removed by washing the beads twice in IP buffer for 5 minutes. Cells transfected with or without 2-5A for three hours were lysed in 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1x complete protease inhibitor cocktail and RNase inhibitor for 7 minutes while rotating, at 4 \u00b0C.\n\nLysates were clarified at by spinning at 10,000 x g for 10 minutes and incubated with antibody-bound beads for two hours at 4 \u00b0C. After two hours, beads were subject to 5 x 2 min washes with IP buffer. RNA and protein from inputs, supernatants (unbound) and\n\nIPs were analyzed using qPCR, western blot and mass spectrometry, respectively.\n\nGel bands were digested using 1.5 \uf06dg Trypsin (Promega). Samples were dried completely in a SpeedVac and resuspended with 21 \uf06dl of 0.1% formic acid (pH 3). Next, 5 \uf06dl was injected per run using an Easy-nLC 1200 UPLC system. Samples were loaded directly onto a 45 cm long 75 \uf06dm inner diameter nano capillary column packed with 1.9 .

The mass spectrometer was operated in data dependent mode with the 120,000 resolution MS1 scan (AGC 4e5, Max IT 50ms, 400-1500 m/z) in the Orbitrap followed by up to 20 MS/MS scans with CID fragmentation in the ion trap. Dynamic exclusion list was invoked to exclude previously sequenced peptides for 60s if sequenced within the last 30s and maximum cycle time of 3s was used. Peptides were isolated for fragmentation using the quadrupole (1.6 Da) window.\n\nIon-trap was operated in Rapid mode with AGC 2e3, maximum IT of 300 ms and minimum of 5000 ions.\n\nRaw files were searched using Byonic (Bern et al., 2012) , MS-Amanda (Dorfer et al., 2014) and Sequest HT algorithms (Eng et al., 1994) The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

Protein probabilities were assigned by the Protein Prophet algorithm (Nesvizhskii et al., 2003) . Proteins that contained similar peptides and could not be differentiated based on MS/MS analysis alone were grouped to satisfy the principles of parsimony.\n\nAn internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-containing dual luciferase plasmid was a gift from Dr. Paul Copeland (Rutgers University). Monocistronic firefly luciferase was obtained by PCR amplification of the coding region from the dual luciferase construct and cloning into BamHI/NotI digested pcDNA3.1. Plasmids were linearized with AgeI (firefly luciferase) or BamHI (dual luciferase) and purified by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. Capped mRNAs were transcribed using reagents from the MEGA ShortScript Kit, except for nucleoside triphosphates, and 12 mM anti-reverse cap analog (NEB). NTPs were added using a custom 10X mixture containing 75 mM each of ATP, UTP, and CTP, and 15 mM GTP. Transcription was carried out for two hours at 37 \u00b0C followed by addition of Turbo DNase I and incubation for 20 minutes at 37 \u00b0C.\n\nMessenger RNAs were phenol extracted and purified on P30 micro spin columns (Bio-Rad).\n\nRibosome-free RRL was prepared essentially as described (Gupta et al., 2013) .

The pellet from the first centrifugation was saved for purifying RRL ribosomes from the salt-wash step.\n\nFrozen A549 cell pellets (~200 \uf06dL) were resuspended in 500 \uf06dL of 20 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 4 mM DTT, 0.2% NP-40, 1x phosphatase inhibitors 2/3 (Sigma), 2x complete protease inhibitor (Roche), and 0.4 U/ml RNase inhibitor (NEB), as described previously (Lorsch and Herschlag, 1999) . Resuspended cells were rotated for 15 minutes at 4\u00b0C, followed by centrifugation for 20 minutes at 16,000 x g, 4\u00b0C. Obtained supernatants were centrifuged for 30 min at 21,000 x g, 4\u00b0C. The resulting supernatants were centrifuged for 80 minutes at 300,000 x g and 4 \u00b0C to yield a crude ribosomal pellet. Pellets were washed with 5 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 4 mM DTT and resuspended in 100 \uf06dL of the fresh wash buffer.\n\nKCl was adjusted to 0.5 M and ribosomes were incubated for additional 30 minutes on ice, followed by centrifugation for 5 minutes at 10,000 x g and at 4 \u00b0C to remove debris.\n\nSalt-washed ribosomes (130 \uf06dl) were layered onto a 100 \uf06dl 0.5 M sucrose cushion containing 20 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 100 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl 2 , and 4 mM DTT.\n\nTubes were centrifuged for 90 minutes at 300,000 x g, at 4\u00b0C and the obtained pellets were rinsed with 3 x 50 \uf06dL of the ribosome storage buffer (20 mM HEPES KOH pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl 2 , 4 mM DTT, 10% glycerol) and then dissolved. Debris was removed by centrifugation as above. A small quantity of purified ribosomes (1 \u03bcl) was processed with Trizol for rRNA extraction. Remaining ribosomes were quantified, .

The simplest model to describe the dynamics of IFN mRNAs is that, in the absence of RNase L, they increase exponentially due to direct positive feedback according to the rate equation:\n\n.

They provide a gradually accumulating activator, increasing stimulating IFN mRNA transcription with time. Denoting by I(t) and A(t) the concentrations of IFN mRNAs and the IFN proteins, respectively, the rate equations that describe the system become:\n\n.

The solution of these equations is given by ln For more general parameter values, note that if we define \u03b3 = \u03b2 1 / , we can write \u03bb = \u00b7 , which is always positive. Based on this relationship, even if the decay exponent \u03b2 1 is very large (i.e. 2-5AMD is very strong), as long as a stable activator is .

Therefore under conditions of 10% 28S rRNA cleavage, the latter mRNA will appear to be ~ 100-fold more sensitive to RNase L than mRNA of ACTB.\n\nFor decay rates, data points from three biological replicates were plotted together.

The specificity ratio S1/S2 is simplified to k on 1 /k on 2 . S1/S2 no longer depends on the binding affinity (K m ) or the catalytic activity (k cat ) and depends only on the association rate constant (k on ). For similar substrates such as different mRNAs k on will depend primarily on the hydrodynamic radius and should be similar for most mRNAs. If association is mediated by the ribosome, k on for different mRNAs could be determined by ribosome-mRNA or ribosome-RNase L association. .
