{"title": "Refl ection and Reaction", "body": "Our responsibility to future generations demands choosing safe and sustainable alternatives in our present activities. \n\nIn their Review on chikungunya, Gilles Pialoux and colleagues 1 quote a Refl ection and Reaction commentary previously published by our group 2 as the source for the statement that \"a clinical trial in South Africa failed to confi rm the clinical effi cacy of chloroquine on arthralgia\". It is true that chloroquine displays antiviral and antiinfl ammatory properties that, in our opinion, merit testing in the clinical management of some viral diseases. However, we reported no data on chikungunya, nor did we mention this disease in our articles in The Lancet Infectious Diseases. 2, 3 Our research has so far been focused on the eff ects of chloroquine on HIV-1, 4 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, 3 infl uenza A viruses, 5 and cancer cells. 6 It is our policy to suggest new ideas only when they are supported by robust experimental results, which are highly reproducible in diff erent laboratory settings. [7] [8] [9] [10] Furthermore, clinical trials in R\u00e9union on chloroquine as a potential antiviral for chikungunya cannot be linked to our previous studies, in that the chloroquine dosage adopted (ie, 250 mg daily) 11 is inconsistent with the tissue drug concentrations that we report are necessary to inhibit the aforementioned viruses. 2 "}
