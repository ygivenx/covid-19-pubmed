{"title": "Clinical Features of Atypical 2019 Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia with an initially Negative RT-PCR Assay", "body": "Since end of December 2019, a cluster of patients with pneumonia of unknown origin was reported from Wuhan, Hubei province, China. They shared a connection with the Huanan South China Seafood Market in Wuhan, and now it has been confirmed that the disease is caused by a novel coronavirus (provisionally named 2019-nCoV). As of today (February 14, 2020), 63935 cases have been confirmed in China. Currently, clinicians have found some atypical cases with positive chest CT findings may present with negative results of RT-PCR for 2019-nCoV. The timely diagnosis, isolation and treatment of these patients will help control the further spread of 2019-nCoV.\n\nWe report a 58-year-old male who was admitted to the hospital with a 1-day history of fever, sore throat and fatigue 5 days after visiting Wuhan, China (the epicenter of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia outbreak) [1] . Physical examination of the lungs at admission was normal.\n\nLaboratory studies demonstrated the white blood cell count (4.3\u00d710 9 /L) and blood procalcitonin level were also normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was slightly increased at 23 mm/h (normal range, 0\uff5e20 mm/h). A swab test and chest CT scanning were performed. Chest CT images illustrated multiple patchy, cloud-like high-density shadows in the dorsal segment of the right lower lobe (Figure a & c) . Three real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of the oropharyngeal swab specimens were negative for the 2019-nCoV nucleic acid.\n\nA repeat chest CT performed 4 days after admission displayed that the range of patchy turbidity high-density shadows in the lower lobe of the right lung was significantly enlarged, and turbidity high-density shadows also appeared in the outer zone of the left lower lobe (Figure b &   d ) . Finally, the fourth RT-PCR 2019-nCoV nucleic acid assay was positive.\n\nCurrently, clinicians have found some cases with positive chest CT findings may present with negative results of RT-PCR for 2019-nCoV. Although this patient's multiple specimen tests were negative, repeat chest CT showed a great progression of cloud-like high-density shadows in both lungs compared to the previous chest CT. The imaging characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia may be bifocal extra-zonal distribution, bilateral, multifocal [2] [3] . With typical clinical presentation and a clear epidemiological history, 2019-nCoV infection may be strongly suspected when chest CT has the characteristics of viral pneumonia despite negative RT-PCR results. In these cases, repeat oropharyngeal swab testing and patient isolation should be carefully considered.\n\nContributors W-DH obtained and analysed the clinical data and made the figure.
