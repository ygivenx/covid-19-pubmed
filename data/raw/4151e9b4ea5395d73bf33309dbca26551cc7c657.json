{"title": "Gene expression is stronger associated with behaviour than 1 with age and fertility in ant workers 2", "body": "Division of labour can be found on all levels of biological organization and has arisen 38 independently during several of the major transitions in evolution, for example during the 39 transition from single cell to multicellular organisms or from solitary to social life [1] . The 40 primary driver for the repeated evolution of division of labour is that it allows cells or group 41 members to specialize on few tasks, thus increase in efficiency and allowing for anatomic or 42 physiological adaptations [2] [3] [4] [5] . 43 The mechanistic underpinnings regulating specialization are complex and intensively 44 investigated on different levels of biological organisation. A highly developed example of 45 division of labour is found in the societies of ants, bees, wasps and termites. In these colonies 46 of social insects, reproduction is monopolized by a single or very few individuals, the queens 47 (and kings in termites), whereas the majority of the colony membersthe workers -remain 48 functionally sterile. All other colony chores are distributed among the workers, which specialize 49 on specific tasks such as brood care, nest defence and foraging [3] . 50 Whether a worker stays inside the nest and cares for the brood or leaves the nest and 51 forages is strongly influenced by age and physiology with brood carers being younger [3], more 52 corpulent [6-14] and more fertile [15, 16] than foragers. Due to high external mortality outside 53 the nest [17], this age-and physiology-based non-reproductive division of labour is beneficial, 54 because it ensures that young workers with longest residual life span, the largest amount of 55 stored resources and the highest reproductive potential stay inside the safety of the nest. 56 Although age and physiology are important regulators of worker task choice in many 57 social insects, few common mechanisms linking age and physiology to behaviour have been 58 found. For example, the switch from brood care to foraging is at least partly regulated by an 59 interaction between age and stable lipid loss [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] 18, 19] . Information on the nutritional status 60 are transported to and in the brain via Target of rapamycin (TOR) and Insulin/Insulin-like 61 signalling (IIS) pathways [12, [20] [21] [22] [23] .

Task-specific signatures of nutritional status and 64 metabolism characterize the brood carer-and forager-specific transcriptomes in bees and wasps 65 [18,22,24-29], but such evidence is lacking in ants [30, 31] . Brood caring behaviour in honey 66 bees is associated with low titres of juvenile hormone (JH) and high expression of the gene 67 coding for the yolk protein precursor Vitellogenin (Vg). Once JH titres rise, Vg is downregulated This across-species inconsistency regarding the mechanistic underpinnings of worker 86 task choice may reflect lineage-specific mechanisms regulating behaviour or differences across 87 studies in the experimental design.

This allowed us to properly assess how behaviour, age, and fertility are 103 associated with gene expression in ant workers. A recent study revealed stronger differences in 104 gene expression between ant queens and workers [68] than between different age-cohorts of the 105 same caste. As we sampled from two clearly distinct age-cohorts differing in age by at least one 106 year, which is estimated to be the mean T. longispinosus worker lifespan in the field [74], we 107 expected age to have a stronger impact on gene expression than behaviour. Furthermore, we 108 expected a rather weak association with fertility as we analysed ant workers from queen-right 109 colonies. Nevertheless, a first study on this species revealed differences between fertile and 110 infertile workers [31].\n\nIn a second step, we used different subsets of our data to investigate the additional 112 variance introduced to a dataset by not controlling experimentally for confounding factors like 113 age.

August, all field collected workers were at least one year old (termed \"old\"). Temnothorax 123 queens are singly-mated which reduces the potential genetic effects on worker behaviour [76] .\n\nIn our laboratory in Mainz, Germany, the ant colonies were transferred to slide glass nests and 125 kept in plastered 3-chambered nest-boxes ( Figure S1 ). We maintained them at a 14h:10h 126 light:dark photoperiod and a +22\u00b0C:+18\u00b0C temperature regime to facilitate brood development.\n\nAnts were fed with crickets and honey three times a week. We randomly marked either all 128 young (upon eclosion in the lab) or all old (field collected) workers with thin metal wires 129 (0.02mm, Elektrisola) in each colony, allowing us to differentiate between the two age cohorts.\n\nDisentangling the effects of behaviour and age on gene expression requires a full factorial 131 design regarding behaviour (brood carer, forager) and age (young, old). To achieve this, we 132 manipulated the demography of colonies 28 days after the emergence of a new worker 133 generation ( Figure 1 ). Specifically, we either removed (i) all old workers from the colony to 134 induce foraging behaviour in young workers (n=12), (ii) removed all young workers to force 135 old workers to tend the brood (n=10), or (iii) removed half of each age cohort as a control 136 (n=16). Workers were then given 21 days to adjust their behaviour and social organisation. Six 137 brood carers (observed tending the brood) and six foragers (found outside the nest) were then 138 individually labelled with metal wire and their investment into either brood caring and foraging 139 was observed and recorded ten times a day for three days.
