{"title": "Emerging zoonotic viruses: new lessons on receptor and entry mechanisms", "body": "Mankind is under a permanent threat from novel pathogens qualified as emerging [1,2 ,3] . Here I review the receptors and mode of entry of three emerging zoonotic viruses, responsible for rare but deadly diseases, whose natural reservoir is the bat: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Hendra (HeV), Nipah (NiV), Ebola (EboV), and Marburg (MarV) viruses.\n\nSARS-CoV has a 30 kb positive RNA genome and the crown-like shape typical of the Coronavidae. A regular array of viral spike glycoprotein (S) trimers constitutes the viral envelope. S mediates binding to the cellular receptor Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) [4 ] , and ensures the viral-cell membrane fusion that allows virus entry.\n\nAs an ectometalloprotease with monocarboxypeptidase activity, ACE2 cleaves the vasoconstrictor Angiotensin II octapeptide into the vasodilatator Ang1-7 heptapeptide.\n\nACE2 protects the heart, lung and kidney from deleterious vasoconstriction and prevents the onset of an acute respiratory distress syndrome [4 ,5-8] . The tissue distribution of ACE2 (pneumocytes I and II, lung epithelium progenitor cells, small intestine enterocytes, kidney, heart cardiomyocytes and endothelium) mostly correlates with the known replication sites of SARS-CoV, and could explain the poor lung repair following SARS infection [4 ,9] .\n\nThe ectopeptidase Type II transmembrane protease serine subfamily member 2 (TMPRSS2) was recently identified as a companion molecule of ACE2 [10 ,11 ,12 ] . TMPRSS2 is detected on the epithelium of the small intestine and respiratory tract, that is the major cell targets of SARS-CoV, but not on the endothelium, which is refractory to SARS-CoV infection [13, 14] . TMPRSS2 and ACE2 physically interact [10 ] . Only a few S proteins get cleaved by TMPRSS2 to allow a pH-and cathepsin-independent efficient entry of SARS-CoV [10 ,12 ] . TMPRSS2 cleaves S protein at sites distinct from those ascribed to trypsin and cathepsin L [12 ] . Upon contact of ACE2 with S protein, ACE2 is also cleaved by TMPRSS2 [10 ]. When expressed on opposing membranes, SARS-CoV S and the ACE2 + TMPRSS2 complex induce intercellular fusion [11 ] . However, newly expressed S proteins escape cleavage by TMPRSS2 allowing the production of virions decorated with uncleaved S [10 ,11 ,12 ], possibly because the tripartite association is prevented intracellularly.\n\nThe present model of virus entry predicts the following ( Figure 1a ): SARS-CoV S protein binds to the ACE2 receptor via the concave S 424-494 region of the receptor binding site (RBD) that cradles over 17 nm 2 of the outer surface of the N-terminal lobe of the ACE peptidase domain, that is outside the enzymatic site [15 ] . This activates TMPRSS2 to cleave a few S proteins into fusioncompetent S1-S2 homodimers [10 ,11 ,12 ,16], which immediately undergo typical class I fusion protein structural changes [17] which permit the viral envelope to fuse with the plasma membrane. S1-S2 heterodimers are probably too unstable to be incorporated into infectious virus particles [16, 18] . Moreover, activated TMPRSS2, and possibly ADAM17/TACE (TNFa converting enzyme) [4 ,19] , concomitantly cleave ACE2. This results in the massive shedding of ACE2 ectodomains [10 ], probably due to amplification of the constitutive pathway [5] .\n\nACE2 shedding is not required for SARS-COV entry [5, 20] , but is probably responsible for the associated major lung failure. Indeed, soluble S both induces ACE2 shed-ding and worsens the clinical signs of SARS [21] . In humans and according to virus strain diversity, S/ACE2 affinity correlates with the efficacy of virus entry, the level of ACE2 cleavage and the intensity of the pathology. Furthermore, the highest affinity is associated with interhuman transmission [20, 22 ] (Figure 1b) . Antibodies targeting the S binding site on ACE2 strongly inhibit viral infection [23] . The correlation between S/ACE2 affinity and SARS-CoV pathogenicity extends to the host range for other mammal species (except bats) in determining whether a particular ACE2 protein can act as a receptor for SARS-CoV or not (including among bats) ( \n\nNiV and HeV constitute the Henipavirus genus of the Paramyxoviridae family and are responsible for fatal respiratory and neurological diseases. Their non-segmented negative strand RNA genomes code for two envelope glycoproteins. The fusion protein F is synthesized as a precursor maturated into a functional F1-F2 heterodimer by cathepsin L via a clathrin-mediated recycling endosomal pathway [28, 29] . The attachment protein G is a tetramer consisting of two disulfide bridged dimers. Like the morbillivirus H and parainfluenzae HN proteins, its Cterminal globular head is folded into a six b-sheet blade propeller surmounting a stalk, transmembrane region and cytosolic tail. The sugar-free b1-b6 dimer interface is 28 Virus Entry conserved. The two heads rotate relative to each other by 08, 638 and 30-408 for henipavirus G, measles virus H and HN, respectively, while the buried area is 9-10 nm 2 EphA4\n\nNiV-G and HeV-G for ephrinB2/B3 correlates with the efficiency of virus entry [48, 51] .\n\nInterestingly, whereas NiV G and F induce fusion of cells expressing ephrinB2/B3, NiV preferentially enters after internalization via macropinocytosis [52 ] , though acidic pH is not required [52 ,53] . Virus entry, but not membrane fusion, is inoperative when the cytosolic tail of ephrinB2 has its PDZ-binding motif deleted or Tyr 304 mutated [52 ] . These two motifs recruit Grb4 and the P21-activated kinase 1 (Pak1)/CdC42/Rac1 complex that govern macropinocytosis [33 , 54,55,56 ,57-59] . The need for macropinocytosis while the fusion machinery is operative at the cell surface is puzzling. Macropinocytosis occurs very rapidly upon contact [60] and could be faster than the fusion step but then macropinocytosis inhibitors would not be expected to prevent virus entry. Several hypotheses can be proposed: (i) fusion requires a specific Ca ++ [61] and/or Na + ionic environment as documented for Semliki Forest virus [62] . (ii) NiV replication requires a specific conditioning of the cytoplasm induced by contacting ephrinB2/B3. (iii) The nucleocapsid needs to reach a particular cytoplasmic location deeper in the cells, more favorable for viral polymerase activity. The latter would not be unprecedented since forced rerouting of virus normally entering by fusion at the cell surface into the endocytic pathway results in hampered infectivity as shown for pseudotyped measles virus and lentivectors [63] [64] [65] .\n\nFiloviruses: an elusive receptor\n\nThe Filoviridae EboV and MarV cause severe hemorrhagic fevers and septic-like shock in humans [66] . Their non-segmented negative RNA genomes code for the envelope glycoprotein GP which ensures both attachment to a (still elusive) cellular receptor and membrane fusion. GP is cleaved by a furin-like protease into mature GP1-GP2 heterodimers [67] . Curiously, mutation of the furin-cleavage site does not abolish GP-mediated virus entry due to alternative cleavage [68] . GP is heavily glycosylated with sugar moieties recognized by LESCtin and DC-SIGN/R lectins that can enhance but not mediate infection [69] [70] [71] [72] . This high glycan content shields MHC class I and b-integrin from antibody recognition [73, 74] , a finding that explains the previously reported apparent downregulation of the latter [75] . A cellular receptor of glycoprotein nature is predicted on the basis of saturable binding of soluble GP [76] and loss of binding after protease, periodate or tunicamycin treatment [76, 77] . In infected animals, the virus disseminates in many tissues [66] . The EboV receptor is stocked in trans-Golgi network membranes in all cell types including the non-permissive T and B lymphocytes. It is exported to the cell surface upon cell adhesion and internalized via a microtubule-dependent and actin-dependent pathway, respectively [78 ,79 ] . EboV and MarV GP cross-compete for binding suggesting the use of a common receptor [76, 80] . However, 3 out of 4 key lysines (at positions 114,115 and 140) defining the receptor binding region (RBR) of EboV GP1 [76] are not conserved in MarV GP1 [81 ] . The structure of a soluble trimeric form of GP1-GP2 reveals a GP1-based chalice form, lined by the RBR. The fusion competent GP2 trimers cradle the chalice stem, with the internal fusion peptide flanked by two bsheets. The RBR is mostly shielded by a glycan cap and a mucin-like domain [82 ], the cleavage of which by cathepsins strongly enhances GP1-GP2 binding to the cell surface [76, 83] . However, lowering the pH neither allows EboV entry at the cell surface, nor cell-cell fusion by mucin-deleted GP1-GP2, and the GP/receptor interaction is stable at acidic pH [76, 77, 84 ] .\n\nIn effect, EboV mostly enters by macropinocytosis with a requirement for lipid rafts, the Na + /H + exchanger, Pak 1, Rac1, Rab5, Rab7, RhoC GTPase and the vacuole closure protein C-terminal binding protein 1 of E1A, CtBP/BARS [59,85 ,86 ,87-89] . Constitutive macropinocytosis in dendritic cells and macrophages fits with their permissiveness to EboV infection [90, 91] . Activation of Ax1 enhances both macropinocytosis and EboV entry [92] although the latter may be mediated by serum Gas6, which was recently reported to mediate non-specific entry for several enveloped viruses [93] .\n\nThe EboV (and MarV) entry process lasts for about 1 h [94, 95] and can be schematized as follows ( Figure 3) : Firstly, (i) EboV attaches to the cells via the GP1/GP2 interaction with DC-SIGN/R and/or LECStin and is (ii) immediately internalized by constitutive and/or virus-contact-induced macropinocytosis. (iii) After 30 min of endocytic trafficking, EboV reaches a late endosomal compartment, where (iv) the resident cathepsin B cleaves off the mucin-like domain [83,84 ,96] to (v) expose GP1's RBR so that the putative receptor can be recruited; then, (vi) a late pH-dependent activation step of the mucindeleted GP1/GP2 complex triggers the fusion activity of GP2, possibly via the reduction of a disulfide bridge [84 ] .\n\nIn conclusion, several lessons can be taken home. These two papers demonstrate the intracellular pool of RBR binding protein of EboV that can be exported to the cell surface upon cell adhesion including in lymphocyte, which are refractory to EboV infection probably because they poorly able to prime GP."}
