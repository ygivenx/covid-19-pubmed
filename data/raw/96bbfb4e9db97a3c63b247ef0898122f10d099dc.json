{"title": "Bifurcation analysis of an SIRS epidemic model with a generalized nonmonotone and saturated incidence rate \u2729", "body": "In the classical infectious disease transmission models (Kermack and McKendrick [16] , Hethcote [12] ), the population is divided into three classes labeled by S(t), I (t) and R(t), representing the numbers of susceptible, infective, and recovered or removed individuals at time t , respectively. Assuming the recovered individuals have temporary immunity, the classical susceptibleinfectious-recovered (SIRS) model can be written as follows:\n\nwhere b is the recruitment rate of the population, d is the natural death rate of the population, \u03bc is the natural recovery rate of the infective individuals, \u03b4 is the rate at which recovered individuals lose immunity and return to the susceptible class. g(I )S is called the incidence rate, and g(I ) is a function to measure the infection force of a disease. The incidence rate g(I )S plays a very important role in describing the evolution of infectious disease. In [16] Kermack and McKendrick assumed that the incidence rate is bilinear, i.e., g(I )S = kI S, (1.2) where g(I ) = kI is unbounded when I \u2265 0. The bilinear incidence rate (1.2) might be true when the number of the infective individuals I (t) is small, but it becomes unrealistic when I (t) is getting larger. Studying the data on the cholera epidemic spread in Bari, Italy, in 1973, Capasso et al. [5] and Capasso and Serio [6] proposed two types of nonlinear incidence rates, namely a saturated incidence rate and an incidence rate taking psychological effect into account (see Fig. 1.1) .\n\n(a) Saturated Incidence Rates. To compare with the bilinear incidence rate (1.2), Capasso and Serio [6] proposed a saturated incidence rate of the following form:\n\nwhere kI measures the infection force of the disease and 1 1+\u03b1I measures the inhibition effect from the behavioral change of the susceptible individuals when their number increases or from the crowding effect of the infective individuals (Ruan and Wang [25] ). Notice that the nonlinear incidence function g(I ) eventually tends to a saturation level k \u03b1 when I is getting larger. The general incidence rate g(I )S = kI p S 1 + \u03b1I q (1.4) was proposed by Liu et al. [20] (q = p \u2212 1) and Hethcote and van den Driessche [13] (p \u2265 q), and used by a number of authors, see, for example, Alexander and Moghadas [1, 2] , Derrick and van den Driessche [9, 10] , Li et al. [17] , Liu et al. [19] , Lizana and Rivero [21] , Moghadas and Alexande [22] , and Wang [28] . According to Tang et al. [27] and Hu et al. [14] , the incidence function g(I ) = kI p 1+\u03b1I q includes three types: (i) unbounded incidence function: p > q; (ii) saturated incidence function: p = q; and (iii) nonmonotone incidence function: p < q. In order to better understand the generic bifurcations in SIRS models with saturated incidence rates, Ruan and Wang [25] studied model (1.1) with a specific nonlinear incidence rate, g(I )S = kI 2 S 1 + \u03b1I 2 , (1.5) and presented a detailed qualitative and bifurcation analysis of the model. (b) Nonmonotone Incidence Rates with Psychological Effect. Though Capasso and Serio [6] described incidence functions taking into account psychological effect, but they did not give any specific function to describe such incidence. To model the effects of psychological factor, protection measures and intervention policies when a serious disease emerges, Xiao and Ruan [29] proposed the following specific incidence rate:\n\nwhere the incidence function g(I ) = kI 1+\u03b1I 2 is nonmonotone when I \u2265 0 (see Fig. 1.1(b) ). This implies that the contact rate and the infection probability are increasing when a new infectious disease emerges, since people have very little knowledge about the disease. However, when I is large and the disease becomes more serious, psychological factor leads people to implementing measures to control the spread of the disease. For example, in the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the aggressive measures and policies, such as border screening, mask wearing, quarantine, isolation, etc. were proved to be very effective in reducing the transmission. So the infection force decreases when the number of infected individuals becomes larger. Liu et al. [18] used (1.6) to describe the psychological effect toward avian influenza in the human population. In [29] , Xiao and Ruan presented a global analysis for model (1.1) with nonmonotone incidence rate (1.6) , and showed that either the number of infective individuals tends to zero as time evolves or the disease persists. Hence, model (1.1) with nonmonotone incidence rate (1.6) cannot exhibit complicated dynamics and bifurcations.\n\nXiao and Zhou [30] considered a complete form of the nonmonotone incidence rate (1.6) as follows:\n\nwhere \u03b2 is a parameter such that 1 + \u03b2I + \u03b1I 2 > 0 for all I \u2265 0, hence, \u03b2 > \u22122 \u221a \u03b1. They presented qualitative analysis of model (1.1) with nonmonotone incidence rate (1.7) and showed the existence of bistable phenomenon and periodic oscillation. Zhou et al. [32] further studied the existence of different kinds of bifurcations, such as Hopf and Bogdanov-Takens bifurcations.\n\n(c) Nonmonotone and Saturated Incidence Rates. Note that both nonmonotone incidence functions kI 1+\u03b1I 2 and kI 1+\u03b2I +\u03b1I 2 , given in (1.6) and (1.7), tend to zero when I goes to infinite, which indicates that the psychological or inhibitory effect from the behavioral change of the susceptible individuals or from the crowding effect of the infective individuals is too strong, which may be unreasonable for some specific infectious diseases, such as influenza. Thus, a more reasonable incidence function g(I ) may be one that first increases to a maximum when a new infectious disease emerges or an old infectious disease reemerges, then decreases due to psychological effect, and eventually tends to a saturation level due to crowding effect. On the other hand, in some specific infectious diseases, the incidence rate may not be monotonic or non-monotonic alone, a more general incidence rate may have a combination of monotonicity, nonmonotonicity and saturation properties.\n\nBased on the above discussions, in this paper, we propose the following general nonmonotone and saturated incidence rate:\n\nwhere \u03b1 > 0 is a parameter which measures the psychological or inhibitory effect, and k is the infection rate. \u03b2 is a parameter such that 1 + \u03b2I + \u03b1I 2 > 0 for all I \u2265 0, hence, \u03b2 > \u22122 \u221a \u03b1. When \u03b2 \u2265 0, g(I ) = kI 2 1+\u03b2I +\u03b1I 2 is monotonic, always increases and then tends to a saturated level k \u03b1 as I goes to infinite. When \u22122 \u221a \u03b1 < \u03b2 < 0, g(I ) is nonmonotonic, increases when I is small and decreases when I is large, and finally tends to a saturated level k \u03b1 as I goes to infinite (see Fig. 1 .2). It can be seen from Fig. 1 .2 that when \u03b1 and k are fixed, g(I ) increases faster for smaller \u03b2 when I is small, and then decreases to the same fixed value k \u03b1 for any \u03b2. When \u03b2 = 0, the general incidence rate (1.8) becomes the saturated incidence rate (1.5). Ruan and Wang [25] studied model (1.1) with incidence rate (1.5) and presented a detailed qualitative and bifurcation analysis of the model. They showed that the system undergoes Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation of codimension two and Hopf bifurcation of codimension one, but the exact codimension of Hopf bifurcation remains unknown. In [27] , Tang et al. proved that the maximal multiplicity of the weak focus is two by complex algebraic calculations but did not give the explicit conditions for degenerate Hopf bifurcation. Moreover, they claimed the existence of Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation of codimension three. They also conjectured that model (1.1) with nonmonotone incidence rate would not exhibit complicated dynamics and bifurcations.\n\nIn this paper, for the case \u03b2 > \u22122 \u221a \u03b1 we find that model (1.1) with general incidence rate (1.8) can exhibit complicated dynamical behaviors and bifurcation phenomena. More precisely, we will show that there are a weak focus of multiplicity at most two and a cusp of codimension at most two for various parameter values, and the model undergoes saddle-node bifurcation, Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation of codimension two, Hopf bifurcation, and degenerate Hopf bifurcation of codimension two as the parameters vary. By considering a more general model, our results show that Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation of codimension higher than two cannot occur, which clarifies and corrects the corresponding results obtained by Tang et al. [27] , who claimed the existence of Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation of codimension three. Moreover, our results about degenerate Hopf bifurcation of codimension two can be seen as a complement of the results obtained by Ruan and Wang [25] , who only discussed the Hopf bifurcation of codimension one. Furthermore, it is shown that there exists a critical value \u03b1 = \u03b1 0 for the psychological or inhibitory effect, and two critical values k = k 0 , k 1 (k 0 < k 1 ) for the infection rate such that: (i) when \u03b1 > \u03b1 0 , or \u03b1 \u2264 \u03b1 0 and k \u2264 k 0 , the disease will die out for all positive initial populations; (ii) when \u03b1 = \u03b1 0 and k 0 < k \u2264 k 1 , the disease will die out for almost all positive initial populations; (iii) when \u03b1 = \u03b1 0 and k > k 1 , the disease will persist in the form of a positive coexistent steady state for some positive initial populations; and (iv) when \u03b1 < \u03b1 0 and k > k 0 , the disease will persist in the form of multiple positive periodic coexistent oscillations and coexistent steady states for some positive initial populations.\n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we carry out a qualitative analysis to give the types and stability of equilibria of model (1.1) with general incidence rate (1.8) . In section 3, we show that the model undergoes saddle-node bifurcation, Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation of codimension at most two, Hopf bifurcation, and degenerate Hopf bifurcation of codimension at most two as parameters vary. In section 4 we use the model to simulate the influenza data in Mainland China from 2004 to 2017. Conclusion and discussion are given in section 5.\n\nWe consider an SIRS epidemic model in the following form\n\nand R(t) denote the numbers of susceptible, infective, and recovered individuals at time t , respectively, b > 0 is the recruitment rate of the population, d > 0 is the natural death rate of the population, k > 0 is the infection rate, \u03bc > 0 is the natural recovery rate of the infective individuals, \u03b4 > 0 is the rate at which recovered individuals lose immunity and return to the susceptible class, \u03b1 > 0 is a parameter which measures the psychological or inhibitory effect, and \u03b2 > \u22122 \u221a \u03b1 such that 1 + \u03b2I + \u03b1I 2 > 0 for all I \u2265 0.\n\nTo study the dynamics of model (2.1), we first present a lemma.\n\nLemma 2.1. The plane S +I +R = b d is an invariant manifold of system (2.1), which is attracting in the first octant.\n\nProof. Summing up the three equations in (2.1) and denoting N(t) = S(t) + I (t) + R(t), we have\n\nIt is clear that N(t) = b d is a solution and for any N(t 0 ) \u2265 0, the general solution is\n\nThus,\n\nwhich implies the conclusion. 2 It is clear that the limit set of system (2.1) is on the plane S + I + R = b d . Thus, we focus on the reduced system\n\nWe know that the positively invariant set of system (2.2) is\n\nSystem (2.2) always has an equilibrium E 0 = (0, 0) which corresponds to the disease-free equilibrium ( b d , 0, 0) of system (2.1). To find the endemic equilibria, we rescale (2.2) by using\n\nThen we obtain (for simplicity we still denote \u03c4 by t)\n\nwhere\n\nIt can be seen that (2.4) and the positively invariant region of system (2.3) is\n\nis an invariant line, and when y = 0, we have dy dt > 0. To find the positive equilibria of system (2.3), we set\n\nwhich yield\n\nWe can see from (2.5) and (2.6) that system (2. 3) has at most two positive equilibria E 1 (x 1 , y 1 ) and E 2 (x 2 , y 2 ), which may coalesce into a unique positive equilibrium E * (x * , y * ), where\n\nThe discriminant of (2.6) is\n\nand we have\n\nThen we have the following existence conditions of equilibria in system (2.3). where 0 < x * \u2264 1. (III) System (2.3) has two positive equilibria E 1 (x 1 , y 1 ) and E 2 (x 2 , y 2 ) if and only if n < n * and A > mp, where 0 < x 1 < x * < x 2 < 2x * .\n\nNext we study local stability of equilibria of system (2.3). We first study the disease-free equilibrium E 0 (0, 0). The Jacobian matrix of system (2.3) at E 0 (0, 0) is \n\nwhich has two eigenvalues \u03bb 1 = \u22121, \u03bb 2 = \u2212p. We obtain the following result. To discuss whether the disease can invade the population, we study the global stability of the equilibrium (0, 0). Since x = 0 is an invariant line and D is positively invariant, by index theory, we can conclude that system (2.3) does not have nontrivial periodic orbits in R 2 + when system (2.3) has no positive equilibria. \n\nwhile n \u2264 n * and A \u2264 mp are equivalent to \u03b1 \u2264 \u03b1 0 and k \u2264 k 0 , where\n\nThese indicate that the disease will die out for all positive initial populations when the psychological or inhibitory effect \u03b1 is greater than a critical value \u03b1 0 , or the psychological effect \u03b1 is smaller than the critical value \u03b1 0 and the infection rate k is also smaller than a critical value k 0 . Now we consider the positive equilibria of system (2.3). The positive equilibria with coordinates (x, y) satisfy\n\nand the Jacobian matrix of system (2.3) at a positive equilibrium E(x, y) is given by\n\nand its sign is determined by\n\nThe trace of J (E) is\n\nand its sign is determined by\n\nTo discuss the topological type of the positive equilibria of system (2.3), we let\n\nwhich will be used in the following theorem. (I) if q = q 1 , then E * (x * , y * ) is a saddle-node, which is attracting (or repelling) if q < q 1 (or q > q 1 ); (II) if q = q 1 , then E * (x * , y * ) is a cusp of codimension two.\n\nThe phase portraits are shown in Fig. 2 \n\nProof. Substituting x * and n * into S D and S T , we deduce that S D (x * ) = 0 and\n\nThen, using Theorem 7.1 in Zhang et al. [33] , we obtain the conclusion in (I).\n\nTo show that the assertion (II) holds, let X = x \u2212 x * , Y = y \u2212 y * , n = n * and q = q 1 . Then using Taylor expansions, we can rewrite system (2.3) as follows (for simplicity, we still denote X, Y by x, y, respectively)\n\nwhere\n\n(2.14)\n\nBy Remark 1 of section 2.13 in [24] (see also [15] ), we obtain an equivalent system of (2.14) in the small neighborhood of (0, 0) as follows:\n\nIt is seen that\n\nand substituting it into n = n * and q = q 1 , we obtain\n\nFurther, since n > 0, p > q > 0 and m > \u22122 \u221a n, it follows from (2.16) that\n\n. By the results in [15] , E * (x * , y * ) is a cusp of codimension two. 2 Remark 2.2. When m = 0 (i.e., \u03b2 = 0), our system (2.2) is reduced to system (1.3) in [27] , our Theorem 2.5 (II) indicates that Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation of codimension higher than two cannot occur around E * , which clarifies and corrects the corresponding results in [27] , where the authors claimed the existence of Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation of codimension three.\n\nWhen the psychological effect \u03b1 equals the critical value \u03b1 0 given by (2.8), Theorem 2.5 implies that whether the disease persists or dies out will depend on the infection rate and the initial population. More precisely, when the psychological effect \u03b1 equals the critical value \u03b1 0 and the infection rate k is greater than the first critical value k 0 given by (2.9), i.e., n = n * and A > mp, then system (2.1) has two equilibria, a disease-free equilibrium and an endemic equilibrium. Moreover, from Fig. 2 .2 (b) and (c), we can see that the disease will die out for almost all positive initial populations if the infection rate k is less than another larger critical value (2.17) and the disease will persist to a positive coexistent steady state for some positive initial population if the infection rate k is greater than the second critical value k 1 (k > k 1 , i.e. q < q 1 ), as shown in Fig. 2 \n\nTheorem 2.6. When n < n * , A > mp and conditions (2.4) are satisfied, then system (2.3) has two positive equilibria E 1 (x 1 , y 1 ) and E 2 (x 2 , y 2 ). Moreover, E 1 is always a hyperbolic saddle and E 2 is\n\nwhere S T is given in (2.11).\n\nTo determine the types of E 1 and E 2 , it is suffice to consider the signs of S D (x 1 ), S D (x 2 ) and S T (x 2 ), where S D and S T are given in (2.10) and (2.11), respectively, from which we have\n\nOn the other hand, since x 1 and x 2 are two different positive roots of (2.6), we have\n\nyielding S D (x 1 ) < 0 and S D (x 2 ) > 0. Hence we obtain the types of E 1 and E 2 . 2 Remark 2.4. It is seen from Theorem 2.6 that when the psychological effect \u03b1 is smaller than the critical value \u03b1 0 but the infection rate k is greater than the first critical value k 0 , i.e., n < n * and A > mp, then the disease will become more severe because of the existence of multiple positive coexistent steady states.\n\nFrom Theorems 2.2, 2.5 and 2.6, we know that system (2.3) may exhibit saddle-node bifurcation, Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation around the equilibrium E * (x * , y * ), and Hopf bifurcation around the equilibrium E 2 (x 2 , y 2 ). In this section, we investigate various possible bifurcations in system (2.3).\n\nFrom Theorems 2.2, 2.5 and 2.6, we know that the surface\n\nis the saddle-node bifurcation surface. When the parameters are varied to cross the surface from one side to the other side, the number of positive equilibria of system (2.3) changes from zero to two, the saddle-node bifurcation yields two positive equilibria. This implies that there exists a critical psychological effect value \u03b1 0 such that the disease cannot invade the population when \u03b1 > \u03b1 0 (i.e., n > n * ), and the disease will persist for some positive initial populations when \u03b1 \u2264 \u03b1 0 (i.e., n \u2264 n * ).\n\nIn this subsection, we discuss if system (2.3) undergoes Bogdanov-Takens Bifurcation of codimension two under a small parameter perturbation if the bifurcation parameters are chosen suitably. Actually, we have the following theorem. Bogdanov-Takens singularity \n\nwhere \u03bb 1 and \u03bb 2 are parameters in a small neighborhood of (0, 0). We are interested only in the phase portraits of system (3.1) when x and y lie in a small neighborhood of the interior equilibrium E * (x * , y * ). Let X = x \u2212 x * , Y = y \u2212 y * . Then system (3.1) can be rewritten as (for simplicity, we still denote X, Y by x, y, respectively)\n\nwhere P 1 (x, y, \u03bb 1 , \u03bb 2 ) is a C \u221e function at least of third order with respect to (x, y), whose coefficients depend smoothly on \u03bb 1 and \u03bb 2 , and\n\nand rewrite X, Y as x, y, respectively. Then system (3.2) becomes dx dt = y,\n\nwhere Q 1 (x, y, \u03bb 1 , \u03bb 2 ) is a C \u221e function at least of third order with respect to (x, y), whose coefficients depend smoothly on \u03bb 1 and \u03bb 2 , and\n\n, and rewriting X, Y as x, y, respectively, we obtain\n\nwhere Q 2 (x, y, \u03bb 1 , \u03bb 2 ) is a C \u221e function at least of third order with respect to (x, y), whose coefficients depend smoothly on \u03bb 1 and \u03bb 2 , and\n\nNote that when \u03bb 1 = \u03bb 2 = 0,\n\nFurther, let\n\nThen system (3.5) can be rewritten as (still denote X, Y by x, y, respectively)\n\nwhere Q 3 (x, y, \u03bb 1 , \u03bb 2 ) is a C \u221e function at least of third order with respect to (x, y), whose coefficients depend smoothly on \u03bb 1 and \u03bb 2 , and\n\nMaking the final change of variables by setting\n\nthen we finally obtain (still denote X, Y and \u03c4 by x, y and t, respectively)\n\nwhere Q 4 (x, y, \u03bb 1 , \u03bb 2 ) is a C \u221e function at least of third order with respect to (x, y), whose coefficients depend smoothly on \u03bb 1 and \u03bb 2 , and\n\nWe can express \u03bc 1 and \u03bc 2 in terms of \u03bb 1 and \u03bb 2 as follows:\n\nfor m = A(p\u22121) p 2 , p > 0, q 1 > 0 and A > mp, the parameter transformation (3.8) is a homeomorphism in a small neighborhood of the origin, and \u03bc 1 and \u03bc 2 are independent parameters.\n\nThe results in Bogdanov [3, 4] and Takens [26] now imply that system (3.7) (i.e., (3.1) or (2.3)) undergoes Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation when (\u03bb 1 , \u03bb 2 ) changes in a small neighborhood of (0, 0). 2\n\nBy the results of Perko [24] , we obtain the following local representations of the bifurcation curves up to second-order approximations:\n\n(i) The saddle-node bifurcation curve is\n\n(ii) The Hopf bifurcation curve is\n\n(iii) The homoclinic bifurcation curve is\n\nThe Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation diagram and corresponding phase portraits of system (3.1) are given in Fig. 3 .1, where we fix A = 2, m = \u22121, p = 2, q = 1/3 and n = 1/3, which satisfy n = n * , q = q 1 , A > mp and conditions (2.4), and then perturb A and q. The bifurcation curves H, HL and SN divide the small neighborhood of the origin in the parameter (\u03bb 1 , \u03bb 2 )-plane into four regions (see Fig. 3.1(a) ).\n\n(a) When (\u03bb 1 , \u03bb 2 ) = (0, 0), the unique positive equilibrium is a cusp of codimension two (see Fig. 2.2(c) ).\n\n(b) There are no equilibria when the parameters lie in region I (see Fig. 3.1(b) ), implying that the disease dies out.\n\n(c) When the parameters lie on the curve SN, there is a unique positive equilibrium E * , which is a saddle-node. (d) Two positive equilibria, one is an unstable focus E 2 and the other is a saddle E 1 , will occur through the saddle-node bifurcation when the parameters cross the SN curve into region II (see Fig. 3.1(c) ).\n\n(e) An unstable limit cycle will appear through the subcritical Hopf bifurcation around E 2 when the parameters are varied to cross the H curve into region III (see Fig. 3.1(d) ), where the focus E 2 is stable, whereas the focus E 2 is an unstable one with multiplicity one when the parameters lie on the curve H.\n\n(f) An unstable homoclinic orbit will occur through the homoclinic bifurcation around E 1 when the parameters pass region III and lie on the curve HL (see Fig. 3.1(e) ).\n\n(g) The relative location of one stable and one unstable manifold of the saddle E 1 will be reversed when the parameters are varied to cross the HL curve into region IV (compare Fig. 3.1(c) and Fig. 3.1(f) ).\n\nIn this subsection we discuss Hopf bifurcation around the equilibrium E 2 (x 2 , y 2 ). Let\n\nwhich will be used in the following subsection.\n\nTo simplify the computation, by following the technique in [11] , we reduce system (2.3) to an equivalent polynomial differential system by using the following state variable scaling and time rescaling: \n\n(3.11)\n\nThen taking the parameter scaling,\n\ninto system (3.11) and dropping the bars, we obtain\n\n(3.12)\n\nSince system (3.12) has an equilibrium \u1ebc 2 (1, 1) (i.e., E 2 (x 2 , y 2 ) of system (2.3)), we have\n\nNote that x 1 x 2 = p np+q+1 for system (2.3), which becomes x 1 x 2 = p np+q+1 under the parameter scaling (3.10), dropping the bars, so we have np + q + 1 \u2212 p > 0 because x 1 x 2 < 1. Regarding the above parameter scaling, the condition (2.4), n < n * and A > mp become\n\nSince the transformation (3.10) is a linear sign-reserving transformation, system (3.12) and system (2.3) have the same qualitative property. Next letting dt = (1 + mx + nx 2 )d\u03c4 and substituting A = p(1 + m + n) + q + 1 into (3.12), we obtain (still denote \u03c4 by t )\n\nwhere m, p, q, n, a satisfy (3.13). Obviously system (3.14) has the same topological structure as that of system (3.12), since we consider system (3.12) in R + 2 = {(x, y) : x \u2265 0, y \u2265 0}, and 1 + mx + nx 2 > 0 holds for all x \u2265 0. In the following, we study the Hopf bifurcation around \u1ebc 2 (1, 1) in system (3.14), which corresponds to the Hopf bifurcation around E 2 (x 2 , y 2 ) in system (2.3).\n\nWhen conditions in (3.13) hold, system (3.14) has an equilibrium at \u1ebc 2 (1, 1). Moreover, (I) when a < a * , \u1ebc 2 (1, 1) is an unstable hyperbolic node or focus; (II) when a > a * , \u1ebc 2 (1, 1) is a locally asymptotically stable hyperbolic node or focus; (III) when a = a * , \u1ebc 2 (1, 1) is a fine focus or center.\n\nProof. The Jacobian matrix of system (3.14) at \u1ebc 2 (1, 1) is\n\n.\n\nThen the determinant of J (\u1ebc 2 (1, 1)) is det(J (\u1ebc 2 )) = a(m + n + 1)(np + q + 1 \u2212 p), and the trace of J (\u1ebc 2 (1, 1) ) is\n\nBy conditions in (3.13), we can see that det(J (\u1ebc 2 )) > 0 and tr(J (\u1ebc 2 )) = 0 (> 0 or < 0) if a = a * (a < a * or a > a * ), so the conclusions follow. 2\n\nNext we continue to consider the case (III) of Theorem 3.1 and study Hopf bifurcation around \u1ebc 2 (1, 1) in system (3.14). We have the following necessary conditions for Hopf bifurcation:\n\nFirstly we can check the transversality condition d da (trJ (\u1ebc 2 )) | a=a * = \u2212(m + n + 1) < 0.\n\nWe investigate the nondegenerate condition and stability of the bifurcating periodic orbit from the positive equilibrium \u1ebc 2 (1, 1) of system (3.14) by calculating the first Lyapunov coefficient. Let X = x \u2212 1, Y = y \u2212 1, and a = a * . Then system (3.14) can be written as (still denote X, Y, \u03c4 by x, y, t , respectively)\n\nwhere b = p \u22121 \u2212np. Let \u03c9 = b q \u2212b 2 , and make a transformation of x = X, y = 1 q (bX \u2212\u03c9Y ) and dt = 1 \u03c9 d\u03c4 , then system (3.16) becomes (we still denote X, Y by x, y, respectively) \n\nUsing the formula in [33] and calculating first Lyapunov coefficient with the aid of MATLAB, we obtain\n\nwhere c 0 , c 1 , c 2 , d 0 , d 1 and d 2 are given in (3.9). By conditions in (3.15), the sign of \u03c3 1 is the same as that of\n\nNow we investigate the sign of \u03c3 11 (i.e., \u03c3 1 ) and will see that there exist some values of parameters such that \u03c3 11 = 0 (i.e., \u03c3 1 = 0) when conditions (3.15) are satisfied. We first give the following Lemma. Proof. By conditions (3.15) , it is easy to show that c i > 0 (i = 0, 1, 2) and\n\nThen we have\n\nwhere m 1 and m 2 are given in (3.9).\n\n(I) Firstly, we consider the discriminant of c 0 + c 1 m + c 2 m 2 = 0, which is given by\n\nwhere 0 = n 2 > 0, 1 = 8 \u2212 18n + 6n 2 + 4n 3 , 2 = \u221215 + 60n \u2212 69n 2 + 18n 3 + 6n 4 , 3 = 6 \u2212 48n + 104n 2 \u2212 84n 3 + 18n 4 + 4n 5 , 4 = 1 + 6n \u2212 33n 2 + 52n 3 \u2212 33n 4 + 6n 5 + n 6 .\n\nWe consider the third derivative of (p) with respect to p, which is given by (3) (p) = 6 3 + 24 4 p. 3 (1 + n) > 0, we can show that 4 > 0 when 0 < n < 1. Thus\n\nOn the other hand, we have p ( 1 1\u2212n ) = 18(n \u2212 1) 2 > 0, and so\n\nSimilarly, we have p ( 1 1\u2212n ) = 0 and ( 1 1\u2212n ) = 0, which yield\n\n(II) Secondly, we analyze the sign of m 1 \u2212 m 2 , which is same as\n\nBy noticing 0 < n < 1 and using a simple analysis, we have\n\nThus, we can see that m 12 The first derivative of m s1 with respect to p is\n\nSince 0 < n < 1 and p > 1 1\u2212n , one can prove that m s1 (p) < 0. Moreover, we have m s1 ( 1 1\u2212n ) = 0. Thus we have m s1 (p) < 0, i.e., m 1 > \u2212 c 1 2c 2 , when conditions (3.15) are satisfied. The sign of \u2212 c 1 2c 2 \u2212 m 2 is the same as that of\n\nSince 0 < n < 1, by a direct computation, we can show that\n\nIt then follows that m s2 (p) < 0, i.e., m 2 > \u2212 c 1 2c 2 , when conditions (3.15) are satisfied. \n\nBy a direct computation with conditions in (3.15), we have\n\nwhere\n\nWe can see that c 1 * is monotonic decreasing for 0 < n < 1. Moreover, since c 1 * (0) = 7 and c 1 * (1) = 0, we have c 1 * > 0 (i.e., c m 1 (p * ) > 0) when 0 < n < 1, and thus c(m 1 )(p) > 0, i.e., c(m 1 ) > 0, when p > p * . When 1 1\u2212n < p < p * , we have m 1 < m 2 by the step (II), then m > max{m 1 , m 2 } = m 2 and c(m) > c(m 2 ) by the step (III). Moreover, we can show that c(m 2 ) > 0. In fact, the sign of c(m 2 ) is same as\n\nBy direct computation, we have c m2 ( 1 1\u2212n ) = \n\nWe then show that d 2 1 \u2212 4d 0 d 2 = n 2 + 2(n 3 + 3n 2 \u2212 6n + 2)p + n(n 3 + 6n 2 \u2212 15n + 8)p 2 > 0.\n\nIn fact, let h(p) = n 2 + 2(n 3 + 3n 2 \u2212 6n + 2)p + n(n 3 + 6n 2 \u2212 15n + 8)p 2 .\n\nBy the conditions in (3.15), we obtain\n\nand\n\nThen when 1 3 < n < 1, we have (I) If m \u2264 m 3 or m \u2265 m 4 (i.e., \u03c3 11 > 0 or \u03c3 1 > 0), then system (3.14) exhibits subcritical Hopf bifurcation and an unstable limit cycle appears around \u1ebc 2 (1, 1). (II) If m 3 < m < m 4 and (II.1) q > q 2 (i.e., \u03c3 11 < 0 or \u03c3 1 < 0), then system (3.14) exhibits supercritical Hopf bifurcation and a stable limit cycle appears around \u1ebc 2 (1, 1); (II.2) q < q 2 (i.e., \u03c3 11 > 0 or \u03c3 1 > 0), then system (3.14) exhibits subcritical Hopf bifurcation and an unstable limit cycle appears around \u1ebc 2 (1, 1); (II.3) q = q 2 (i.e., \u03c3 11 = 0 or \u03c3 1 = 0), then system (3.14) may exhibits degenerate Hopf bifurcation and multiple limit cycles may appears around \u1ebc 2 (1, 1).\n\nHere, m 3 , m 4 and q 2 are given in (3.9).\n\nOne stable (or unstable) limit cycle arising from supercritical (or subcritical) Hopf bifurcation around the equilibrium \u1ebc 2 (1, 1) of system (3.14) is given in Fig. 3.2. In Fig. 3.2(a) , we fix n = 0.1, p = 1.2, m = \u22120.6 and q = 2, and get a = 0.16 from tr(J (\u1ebc 2 )) = 0, and further obtain \u03c3 1 = \u22123.24949. Finally, we perturb a such that a decreases to 0.12, then \u1ebc 2 (1, 1) becomes an unstable hyperbolic focus, leading to a stable limit cycle to appear around \u1ebc 2 (1, 1). In Fig. 3.2(b) , we fix n = 0.1, p = 1.2, m = \u22120.6 and q = 0.6, and get a = 0.16 from tr(J (\u1ebc 2 )) = 0, and further get \u03c3 1 = 2.62886. Finally, we perturb a such that a increases to 0.18, and so \u1ebc 2 (1, 1) becomes a stable hyperbolic focus, yielding an unstable limit cycle to appear around \u1ebc 2 (1, 1). Fig. 3.2(a) , the model has three equilibria, a disease-free equilibrium which is a stable hyperbolic node, two endemic equilibria (one is a hyperbolic saddle and the other is an unstable focus) and a stable limit cycle. If the initial population lies on the right side of the two stable manifolds of the saddle, then the disease will tend to a periodic coexistent oscillation. If the initial population lies on the left side of the two stable manifolds of the saddle, then the disease will die out. Fig. 3.2(b) , the model has three equilibria, a disease-free equilibrium which is a stable hyperbolic node, two endemic equilibria (one is a hyperbolic saddle and the other is a stable focus) and an unstable limit cycle. If the initial population lies on the limit cycle, then the disease will persist in the form of a periodic coexistent oscillation. If the initial population lies inside the limit cycle, then the disease will tend to a stable steady state. If the initial population lies outside the limit cycle, the disease will die out for almost all positive initial populations.\n\nFrom (II.3) of Theorem 3.5, we know that system (3.14) may exhibit degenerate Hopf bifurcation (i.e., Hopf bifurcation of codimension two) when q = q 2 , m 3 < m < m 4 and conditions (3.15) are satisfied. Using the formal series method in [33] and MATLAB software, we obtain the second Lyapunov coefficient\n\n, (3.20) where\n\nNext we investigate the sign of \u03c3 2 and first give the following lemma. \n\nBy a direct calculation, we have h(m 1 )(p) = 2n + 4(n 2 \u2212 1)p + 3(n \u2212 1) 2 (n + 1)p 2 .\n\nIt follows that h(m 1 )(p) > 0 when p > p * . Further, by a direct calculation, we have\n\nso h(m 1 )(p) > 0 (i.e., h(m 1 ) > 0) when p > p * . When 1 1\u2212n < p < p * , we have m 1 < m 2 by the step (II) in the proof of Lemma 3.3. Then m > max{m 1 , m 2 } = m 2 and h(m) > h(m 2 ). Moreover, we can show that h(m 2 ) > 0. In fact\n\nBy a direct calculation, we have\n\nIt follows that h(m 2 )( 1 1\u2212n ) > 0 and h(m 2 )(p * ) > 0 for 0 < n < 1. Thus, h(m 2 ) > 0 when 1 1\u2212n < p < p * .\n\nSummarizing the above results, we have shown that h(m) > 0 (i.e., 2 +4np +m(np +p +1) > 0) when conditions (3.15) are satisfied. 2\n\nWhen m > \u22122 \u221a n, 0 < n < 1, p > 1 1\u2212n , m 3 < m < m 4 , and by Lemma 3.6, we know that the sign of \u03c3 2 in (3.20) is the same as that of e 0 + e 1 m + e 2 m 2 + e 3 m 3 \u03c3 21 .\n\n(3.21)\n\nBased on extensive numerical calculations, we conjecture that \u1ebc 2 (1, 1) is an unstable multiple focus with multiplicity two, i.e., \u03c3 21 > 0 (or \u03c3 2 > 0) when q = q 2 , m 3 < m < m 4 and conditions in (3.15) are satisfied. However, it is very difficult to pursue a pure algebraic proof. Next we combine geometric (graphic) and algebraic methods to show that \u1ebc 2 (1, 1) is actually an unstable multiple focus with multiplicity at most two. Actually, we have the following result.\n\nTheorem 3.7. The equilibrium \u1ebc 2 (1, 1) in system (3.14) (i.e., E 2 (x 2 , y 2 ) in system (2.3)) is an unstable multiple focus with multiplicity at most two, system (2.3) can exhibit degenerate Hopf bifurcation of codimension two around E 2 (x 2 , y 2 ), and the outer bifurcating limit cycles is unstable.\n\nProof. The Jacobian of the linearized system of (3.14) shows that Hopf bifurcation occurs at the critical point:\n\nSetting a = a H yields the eigenvalues at the critical point as \u03bb \u00b1 = \u00b1\u03c9 c i, where\n\nIn order to have \u03c9 c > 0, it needs 0 < p(1 \u2212 n) \u2212 1 < q, (3.22) which in turn yields 1 + m + n > 0 from a H > 0. It is obvious that we need the following condition:\n\nTo simplify the analysis, we introduce two new parameters:\n\nThus, the conditions 0 < p(1 \u2212 n) \u2212 1 < q are equivalent to P > 0, Q > 0. Then, a H = P 1+m+n > 0 and \u03c9 c is reduced to \u03c9 c = \u221a P Q. Note that the condition q < p a = p a H becomes\n\nTherefore, the conditions in (3.15 ) are equivalent to the following conditions:\n\nNow, introducing the transformation,\n\nand the time rescaling \u03c4 1 = \u03c9 c \u03c4 into (3.14), we obtain\n\nNext, applying the Maple program [31] we obtain the following focus values:\n\nwhere F 3 is a lengthy polynomial, which is omitted here for brevity. In the following, we prove that when v 1 = 0, v 2 > 0 for the parameters satisfying the conditions in (3.25) . Since v 1 and v 2 have the same sign of F 1 and F 2 , respectively, we consider the polynomials F 1 and F 2 .\n\nFirst, suppose that the two polynomial equations F 1 = F 2 = 0 have solutions for P and Q and we study if the solutions satisfy the conditions in (3.25) . Note that F 1 is linear in Q, we solve Q from F 1 = 0 to obtain Q = (1 + m + n)(1 + P ) P (mn + m + 4n) + 2(1 + m + n) (n \u2212 1) P (mn 2 + m 2 + 3mn + 6n 2 \u2212 2n) + m 2 + 4mn + 3n 2 + 2n \u2212 1 , (3.27) and then substitute it into F 2 to get F 2 = 6(n \u2212 1)(1 + m + n) 4 (1 + P ) 3 P P (mn + m + 4n)\n\nNote that the solutions of F 2 = 0 come from the quadratic polynomial equation A 0 P 2 \u2212 A 1 P + A 2 = 0. Solving this polynomial equation yields two solutions:\n\nand then we have\n\nTo have real solutions for P \u00b1 and Q \u00b1 , it requires > 0. Summarizing the above results shows that if the two sets of solutions satisfy v 1 = v 2 = 0, they must satisfy the conditions given in (3.25) as well as > 0. Define\n\nIt is clear that the conditions given in (3.25) must be in \u00b1 . We will show that the obtained solutions P \u00b1 and Q \u00b1 do not belong to \u00b1 , then P \u00b1 and Q \u00b1 do not satisfy conditions in (3.25) , thus there are no feasible parameter values for v 1 = v 2 = 0, and the best possibility is v 1 = 0 but v 2 = 0, which implies that the maximal number of limit cycles bifurcating from the Hopf critical point is two. To prove the result by combining geometric (graphic) and algebraic methods, first we consider the set \u2212 . Define the functions:\n\nthen plot the curves = 0 and C k = 0, k = 1, 2, 3 on the m-n plane, and identify the regions on the boundary regime: 0 < n < 1, 1 + m + n > 0, satisfying > 0 and C k > 0, k = 1, 2, 3. If these regions do not overlap, then no solutions exist; if these regions do overlap, we need to further check the last condition in (3.25) , Q < Q max .\n\nFor the set \u2212 , we show the curves = 0 and C k = 0, k = 1, 2, 3, in Fig. 3 .3(a) with the colors in red, blue, brown and green, respectively. Fig. 3.3(b) is a zoomed area near the m-axis. The region for < 0 is inside the red loop, and > 0 is outside the loop. Thus, we only need to consider the region outside the red loop. We use + or \u2212 to indicate C k > 0 or C k < 0. Fig. 3.3(c) is a zoomed area near the corner of (m, n) = (\u22122, 1), showing that all three curves are tangent to the line 1 + m + n = 0 at the corner. This can be rigorously proved using an algebraic argument. Figs. 3.3(a), (b) and (c) clearly show that there are no regions with > 0 and all three functions C k > 0, k = 1, 2, 3. Thus, the set \u2212 does not have feasible solutions satisfying v 1 = v 2 = 0.\n\nNext, consider the set + . We have a similar result, as shown in Fig. 3 .4. Again, this set also does not have feasible solutions satisfying v 1 = v 2 = 0.\n\nTo this end, we have shown that under the restrictions on the parameters, as given in (3.25), it is not possible to have solutions such that v 1 = v 2 = 0 and to have three limit cycles bifurcating from the equilibrium (x 0 , y 0 ) = (1, 1) due to Hopf bifurcation. Therefore, the next best choice is to have v 1 = 0 and v 2 = 0, and P can then be treated as a free parameter. The above proof implies that v 2 must be kept the same sign for the feasible parameter values. Otherwise, if it can change sign, then it must have solutions for v 2 = 0, which contradicts the above result. To determine whether the sign of v 2 is positive or negative, we only need to choose a solution such that v 1 = 0 and then calculate v 2 . For example, taking P = n = m = 1 10 , we obtain\n\ngiving v 1 = 0 and > 0, implying that v 2 > 0 for any parameter values which satisfy the conditions given in (3.25) . Thus, the outer bifurcating limit cycle is always unstable and the inner one is stable, both enclose an unstable focus (1, 1) . The proof is complete. 2 Remark 3.3. If m = 0 (i.e., \u03b2 = 0), then \u03c3 21 = e 0 > 0 (i.e., \u03c3 2 > 0), thus \u1ebc 2 (1, 1) (i.e., E 2 (x 2 , y 2 )) is an unstable multiple focus with multiplicity two when q = q 2 , m 3 < m < m 4 and conditions in (3.15) are satisfied. Moreover, when \u03b2 = 0 (i.e., m = 0), our system (2.2) is reduced to system (1.2) in [25] , where the authors only discussed the Hopf bifurcation of codimension one, thus our results about Hopf bifurcation of codimension two can be seen as a complement of [25] by considering a more general system. On the other hand, when \u03b2 = 0 (i.e., m = 0), our system (2.2) also becomes system (1.3) in [27] , where the authors showed the existence of degenerate Hopf bifurcation by complex algebraic calculations, our Theorems 3.5 and 3.7 give more explicit conditions and our proofs are easier to follow.\n\nNext we give some numerical simulations in Fig. 3 .5 to show the existence of two limit cycles based on Theorems 3.5 and 3.7. Firstly, we fix n = 1/3, p = 2 and m = \u22121, then get q = 23 15 from \u03c3 1 = 0, and get a = 1 from tr(J (\u1ebc 2 )) = 0, finally get \u03c3 2 = 2.65719, i.e., \u1ebc 2 (1, 1) is an unstable multiple focus with multiplicity two for those fixed parameters. Next we first perturb q such that q increases to 23 15 + 0.1, then \u1ebc 2 (1, 1) becomes a stable multiple focus with multiplicity one, an unstable limit cycle occurs around \u1ebc 2 (1, 1) which is the outer limit cycle in Fig. 3 .5. Secondly, we perturb a such that a decreases to 1 \u2212 0.003, then \u1ebc 2 (1, 1) becomes an unstable hyperbolic focus, another stable limit cycle occurs around \u1ebc 2 (1, 1), which is the inner limit cycle in Fig. 3 .5. Fig. 3 .5, we can see that the existence of multiple periodic coexistent oscillations and coexistent steady states when the psychological effect \u03b1 is smaller than the critical value \u03b1 0 but the infection rate k is greater than the first critical value k 0 , i.e., n < n * and A > mp. The disease will die out for almost all initial populations outside the outer unstable periodic orbit, and will tend to periodic outbreaks for almost all initial populations on or inside the outer unstable periodic orbit, and will persist in the form of positive steady states when the initial population lies on the positive equilibria or their stable manifolds.\n\nIn section 1 we mentioned that nonmonotone and saturated incidence rates may apply to some infectious diseases such as influenza. In this section, we use model (2.1) to simulate the reported human influenza data from China. From the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) [8] , we obtain the annual data on human influenza cases from 2004 to 2017 which are shown in Table 1 . Most parameter values can be obtained from the literature or by estimation. We estimate k, \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b4 and R(0) by using the unconstrained optimization functions f minsearch, a part of the optimization toolbox in MATLAB, to fit I (t i ) through discretizing the ordinary differential system (2.1) as follows\n\nkS(t i )I (t i ) 2 1 + \u03b2I (t i ) + \u03b1I (t i ) 2 \u2212 (d + \u03bc)I (t i ) t + I (t i ).\n\nThe fitting is to minimize the objective function Table 1 The data on human influenza cases in China from 2004-2017 ( [8] ). \n\nwhere I (t i ) is numerical solution of model (2.1) and \u00ce (t i ) is the reported human influenza data from China.\n\nThe parameter values are listed in Table 2 . From the data in 2004, we know that I (0) = 49496; we make the data fitting to obtain that R(0) = 13, then S(0) = 1.29983 \u00d7 10 9 ; and assume that \u03bc = 365 5 from Casagrandi et al. [7] , data fitting gives \u03b4 = 0.33042, k = 2.8668 \u00d7 10 \u22128 , \u03b1 = 4.9077 \u00d7 10 \u22126 and \u03b2 = 78.12.\n\nBased on the parameter values given in Table 2 , we use model (2.1) to simulate the data from 2004 to 2017 and predict the trend of human influenza infections in China. Fig. 4 .1 represents the simulation of our model with reasonable parameter values which provides a good match to the data on infected human influenza cases in China from 2004 to 2017. In Fig. 4 .2 our model predicts that the number of human influenza infection will increase in the next a couple of years.\n\nIn most classic SIRS epidemic models, the incidence rate is either monotonic or nonmonotonic, and the infection force g(I ) usually tends to zero as I \u2192 \u221e when the incidence rate is non-monotonic, which may be unreasonable for some specific infectious diseases. In this paper, we considered the SIRS epidemic model (1.1) with a generalized nonmonotone and saturated incidence function g(I ) = kI 2 1+\u03b2I +\u03b1I 2 , which exhibits three different properties: (i) when \u03b2 \u2265 0, g(I ) is monotonic, which always increases and then tends to a saturated level k \u03b1 as I intends to infinite. (ii) When \u22122 \u221a \u03b1 < \u03b2 < 0, g(I ) is nonmonotonic, which increases when I is small and decreases when I is large, and finally tends to a saturated level k \u03b1 as I tends to infinite (see Fig. 1.2) , which can be used to describe the phenomenon that the infection force first increases to a maximum when a new infectious disease emerges, and then decreases due to psychological effect and eventually tends to a saturation level due to crowding effect. (iii) When \u03b2 > \u22122 \u221a \u03b1, g(I ) has both properties of (i) and (ii), i.e., g(I ) is first nonmonotonic and then monotonic when \u03b2 increases from negative to positive. In this paper, we performed qualitative and bifurcation analysis, and found that the model (1.1) with general incidence rate (1.8) has complicated dynamical behaviors and bifurcation phenomena. It has been shown that there exists a weak focus of multiplicity at most two and a cusp of codimension at most two for various parameter values, and the model undergoes saddle-node bifurcation, Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation of codimension two, Hopf bifurcation and degenerate Hopf bifurcation of codimension two as the parameter values vary. By considering a more general model, our results show that Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation of codimension higher than two cannot occur, which clarifies and corrects the corresponding results by Tang et al. [27] . Moreover, our results about degenerate Hopf bifurcation (i.e., Hopf bifurcation of codimension two) can also be seen as a complement of the results in Ruan and Wang [25] . We also used model (2.1) to simulate the reported human influenza data from 2004 to 2017 reported by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIn recent years, people realize the importance of the inhibition effect from the behavioral change of susceptible individuals when their number increases or from the crowding effect of the infective individuals, and the psychological effect or inhibition effect can cause people to adopt some aggressive measures and policies, such as border screening, mask wearing, quarantine, isolation and so on, which have been proved to be very effective in reducing the contact rate or the infection force. However, it is difficult to measure the psychological effect. So can we give a quantitative description about the psychological effect with respect to variation of the parameters involved in the infectious diseases? In this paper, we presented a concrete critical value to measure the psychological effect. More specifically, we have shown that there exists a critical value \u03b1 = \u03b1 0 for the psychological or inhibitory effect and two critical values k = k 0 , k 1 (k 0 < k 1 ) for the infection rate such that: (i) when \u03b1 > \u03b1 0 , or \u03b1 \u2264 \u03b1 0 and k \u2264 k 0 , the disease will die out for all positive initial populations; (ii) when \u03b1 = \u03b1 0 and k 0 < k \u2264 k 1 , the disease will die out for almost all positive initial populations; (iii) when \u03b1 = \u03b1 0 and k > k 1 , the disease will persist in the form of a positive coexistent steady state for some positive initial populations; and (iv) when \u03b1 < \u03b1 0 and k > k 0 , the disease will persist in the form of multiple positive periodic coexistent oscillations and coexistent steady states for some positive initial populations."}
