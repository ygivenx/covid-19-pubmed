{"title": "SARS Coronavirus-unique domain (SUD): Three-domain Molecular Architecture in Solution and RNA Binding Supplementary Material", "body": ". Proteins with structural similarity to SUD-C and with DALI Z-scores \u2265 3 that were identified by a DALI S1, S2 The Z-score is a quantitative measure of the structural similarity and is defined in terms of equivalent intramolecular distances. S1,S2\n\nc Root mean square distance resulting from the superposition of the C \u03b1 atoms of the residues in the structurally equivalent positions between SUD-C and the structure given in the first column.\n\nd Percentage of sequence similarity between SUD-C and the amino acid sequence of the structure given in the first column (aligned residues only).\n\ne Brief description of the protein and its physiological function.
