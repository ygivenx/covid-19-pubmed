{"title": "Seroprevalence of antibodies to astrovirus in chickens in Grenada, West Indies", "body": "Astroviruses are small, round, non-enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses, typically 28-30 nm in diameter [1]. The name astrovirus comes from the Greek \u201castron,\u201d meaning star, describing the 5-6 pointed star-like surface projections detected by negative-stained electron microscopy [2]. Astroviruses belong to the Astroviridae family, which is divided into two genera: Mamastrovirus (mammalian astroviruses) and Avastrovirus (avian astroviruses) [1].\n\nMamastroviruses are associated with gastroenteritis outbreaks in infants [2,3] and elderly people [4] and are an important cause of gastroenteritis in immunocompromised individuals [5]. Astroviruses also cause severe disease, including diarrhea and gastroenteritis in several mammals and birds, such as swine, sheep, cats, dogs, cattle, turkeys, guinea fowls, and ducks [6].\n\nMamastrovirus infection was not reported from avian species, yet. However, recently, Pancovics et al. [7] detected a mammalian-like astrovirus in bird, European roller (Coracias garrulous) in Hungary.\n\nTo date, five different astroviruses have been identified in avian species [8]. In turkeys, two types of astroviurus (TAstV) have been identified, TAstV-1 and TAstV-2. Both types of TAstVs are genetically and immunologically distinct [9]. Astroviruses cause severe outbreaks of gastroenteritis in turkeys [9,10]. In ducks, the virus is called Duck AstroVirus, primarily known as a picornavirus, Duck Hepatitis Virus Type II and this virus causes fatal hepatitis in young ducklings [11].\n\nIn chickens, there are two species of astroviruses, which are antigenically and genetically distinct. Avian nephritis virus (ANV) was originally classified as a picornavirus but later as an astrovirus on the basis of nucleotide sequence [12]. ANV affects young chicks and causes growth depression and nephritis with swollen kidneys, prominent ureters, and visceral gout. There are necrosis and degeneration of the epithelial cells of the proximal convoluted tubules with interstitial infiltration of granulocytes and lymphocytes in the kidneys. They also have caused outbreaks of gout in broilers in India [13]. Recently, Espinoza et al. [14] identified a new strain of ANV in Brazilian commercial chicken flocks. De Wit et al. [15] reported a new group of ANV in chicken and turkeys with enteric and locomotion disorders. Zhao et al. [16] found 89% ANV and 4% chicken astroviruses (CAstV) in pigeons (Columbia livia) in China, during an outbreak of diarrhea.\n\nA second species of astovirus, CAstV, was isolated from broiler chicks. CAstV is associated with poor weight gain and enteric disease in chickens [17]. Recently, Todd et al. [18] identified two genetically different isolates of CAstV, named CAstV 612 and CAstV 11672, who share the low levels of antigenic relatedness.\n\nWorldwide, isolated published information is available on the seroprevalence of avian astroviruses. To the best of our knowledge, in the Caribbean region, including Grenada, there is no information on CAstV. In the present study, the seroprevalence of antibodies for astrovirus (CAst-V) in indigenous and commercial chickens of Grenada is reported for the first time.\n\nThe project was approved by Institutional Animal care and Use Committee (IACUC # 12005).\n\nGrenada is the southernmost island country in the southeastern Caribbean Sea. The island is divided into six parishes. Blood from 366 randomly selected indigenous chickens between the ages of 1-2 years and 92 blood samples collected randomly from layers in the age group between 1 and 1.5 years from commercial flocks from all six parishes were tested for antibodies against CAstV. Around 30% of the Grenadian households keep indigenous chickens for their family use. The flock of indigenous chickens varies from 10 to 50 chickens per household. Blood from indigenous chickens was collected from five birds in flocks consisting of up to 10 birds and from 20% of birds in flocks with a size >10 birds. From commercial layers, blood from around 15 chickens from 2 to 3 farms in each parish was collected.\n\nA volume of 2-3 ml blood sample was collected from the basilic vein (wing vein) of the chickens. Sera were separated by centrifugation of blood at 3000 g for 10 min and frozen at \u221280\u00b0C until tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Sera were tested by ELISA. The CAstV Group B antibody test kit from Biocheck (UK) Ltd. 11, Millfarm Business Park, Millfield Road, Hounslow, London (Manufacturer) was used, according to manufacturer\u2019s protocol.\n\nConfidence interval (CI) and Fisher\u2019s exact test were calculated using the following website: (http://www.mccallumlayton.co.UK/states/CI Calcproportion.aspx).\n\nThe seroprevalence of CAstV in indigenous chickens and commercial layer chickens is presented in Table-1.\n\nOut of 366 indigenous chickens tested, 225 were positive for antibodies to CAstV (61.5% CI: 95%: 56.4-66.3%). Out of 92 tested commercial layer chickens, 53 were positive for antibodies to CAstV, (57.6% CI: 95%: 47.4-67.2%).\n\nThere was no significant difference in seropositivity of antibody for CAstV in commercial layer chicken and indigenous chicken (p=0.5508) (Fisher\u2019s exact test).\n\nInitially the research was planned to perform seroprevalence of astrovirus, hence we only collected blood and completed serology. Finding high sero positivity for astrovirus in chickens, we were prompted to conduct molecular techniques. For PCR we needed fecal material from chickens which was not collected in this project. Extra funding was granted by the University and fecal swabs specimens are being collected. We hope to complete PCR on indigenous and commercial chickens by mid 2018. As far as authors know no research on astrovirus is going on in the Caribbean region.\n\nThere is no published information on CAstV in Grenada and other Caribbean nations. A serological investigation to find out the presence of antibodies to CAstV in indigenous and commercial chickens was conducted in Grenada. The presence of antibodies in approximately half of the tested chickens, by use of ELISA, indicates a widespread infection with CAstV. Because of the lack of a vaccine, the need to educate poultry farmers in Grenada regarding the use of biosecurity to prevent CAstV has been emphasized.\n\nThis is the first report on the presence of CAstV antibodies in chickens in Grenada and the Caribbean nations.\n\nRNS planning and oversee of the research project and manuscript writing; RD, TM, and KO\u2019C helping KT in the collection of blood and performing the ELISA, KT collection of blood, performing ELISA, and review of the manuscript."}
