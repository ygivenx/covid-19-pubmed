{"title": "High-Throughput Screening Identifies Inhibitors of the SARS Coronavirus Main Proteinase in the first step of the formation of the crucial replication- transcription complex. The activity of 3CL pro , so named for its similarity to 3C proteinases of Picornaviridae [14]", "body": "had been developed as a transition-state analog inhibitor for HIV-1 protease and had a K i of 0.6 M with 3CL pro [29] .\n\nAlthough a number of existing drugs that could potentially act as inhibitors of 3CL pro were identified through virtual screening, other than ribavirin, it is not known how active these compounds actually are toward the protease. Additionally, in vitro screening campaigns illustrate that out of over 500 existing protease inhibitors, only two were identified as active toward 3CL pro . These findings illustrate the need to look toward the development of innovative inhibitors for this protease. One such study has recently identified unique keto-glutamine analogs as inhibitors of 3CL pro with IC 50 's in the low micromolar range (J.C. Vederas, submitted). In an effort to advance this initiative, we sought to identify novel small molecules that specifically target 3CL pro .

Using this substrate, the activity of a ciation between enzyme and substrate.

This aspect of the quenched-FRET assay is particularly attractive since, in evaluating the activity of a proteinase in terms of a rate, the potential for false negatives to occur in the screen due to the presence of inherent fluorescence from the compounds being tested is reduced.\n\nTwo fluorogenic peptide substrates were synthesized to develop a continuous assay of 3CL pro proteolytic activity based on FRET. The peptides were designed principally on the sequences flanking 3CL pro in the polyprotein and solubility considerations. A peptide incorporating the anthranilate-nitrotyrosine donor-acceptor pair (Abz- and was the preferred substrate for HTS.

For the well below K m , which is advantageous for identifying preliminary analyses of these hits, we opted to restrict inhibitors that compete with substrate for the enzyme the number of compounds entering secondary screenactive site [33] and are therefore more likely to be speing by a series of virtual and experimental filters.

The thiol side chain of the active site cysteine of 3CL pro is necessarily a good nucleophile\n\nThe dose-response curves for these five compounds with 3CL pro yielded IC 50 values of 0.5-7 M ( Figure 5 ). and therefore has the capacity to combine with a variety of electrophilic functionalities to form covalent adducts.\n\nTo evaluate the selectivity of each compound, we investigated their ability to inhibit four other proteinases with This reaction is the basis for several classes of existing peptidic inhibitors of cysteine proteases which include varying structural and mechanistic relatedness to SARS-CoV 3CL pro . The Hepatitis A virus (HAV) 3C pro , like all \u2423-\u2424-unsaturated ketones, esters, and amides [40, 41] ( 1, 14) have long been recognized as being reactive toward thiols in general, titis C Nonstructural 3 proteinase (NS3 pro ) and chymotrypsin are serine proteases with the same two \u2424-barrel and cysteine proteases in particular [43] .

Alternatively, those compounds for which enzyme 1,4-dithio-D,L-threitol (DTT) in the inhibition reaction. A reduction in the inhibition of 3CL pro by any candidate inhibition was not seen at the highest concentration tested, are indicated accordingly. It is important to note compound in the presence of DTT suggests that such a compound would probably react nonspecifically with that in the absence of full mechanistic analyses, the IC 50 values are intended to reveal profound differences in any biologically available thiol functionality [40, 41] . Al-Considering the mechanistic and structural relationships between 3CL pro and HAV 3C pro , and to a lesser extent NS3 pro , we were interested to learn that some of the compounds showed highest activity against these related enzymes. In addition to inhibiting 3CL pro with an IC 50 MAC-8120 and MAC-13985 also demonstrated interesting selectivity profiles with good activity against SARS-CoV 3CL pro (IC 50 values were 4.3 and 7 M, respectively) and no detectable inhibition of any of the other proteinases tested. These particular compounds, however, proved to be difficult in the assays of HAV 3C pro and NS3 pro due to background fluorescence, and could not be tested at concentrations greater than 5 M. Nevertheless, no detectable inhibition was seen at that concentration, indicating that an IC 50 for these molecules would necessarily be much higher.\n\nThe protease selectivity data, therefore, point to two molecules with apparent selectivity for 3CL pro , MAC-8120 and MAC-13985. These may well be the most promising leads for further mechanistic characterization and optimization efforts toward a protease-based antiviral for SARS-CoV. One molecule, MAC-30371, has an interesting selectivity for the picornaviral-like proteinases and could prove to be a viable lead for this family of proteolytic enzymes. yeast (IC 50 \u03ed 56 M to 4 mM) [47] . This study examined the inhibition of the isomerase by a series of substituted potency to provide insight into the selectivity of the benzothiazoles, and indicated that MAC-8120 interinhibitors, and to aid in their prioritization as leads for acted with cysteine residues on the enzyme that were continuing studies. previously shown to be central in dimerization.

It is therefore quite studied, although the response with NS3 pro (IC 50 \u03fe 500 possible that MAC-8120 associates with the active site M) was significantly lower than with the other enzymes. cysteine of 3CL pro in a similar manner to disrupt its cata-MAC-5576 showed some selectivity toward those prolytic activity.

Papain, which lacks this fold, was unaffected by other picornaviral-like proteinases. Additionally, the MAC-5576.
