A 2-arm, randomized, controlled trial of a motivational interviewing-based intervention to improve adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) among patients failing or initiating ART. J Acq Immun Defi \n\nThe survival benefi t for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) treatment invites consideration of whether ECMO might provide an important medical countermeasure for ARDS resulting from natural hazards or acts of terrorism. Anthrax spores, bioengineered or native avian fl u strains, or chemical agents (such as chlorine gas and its derivatives) can all lead to lung injury with resulting ARDS. A framework is needed for ECMO if it is to be incorporated into our comprehensive emergency preparedness programmes.\n\nECMO provides continuous circulatory support or oxygenation to patients with cardiac failure and pulmonary failure. It is already established in the treatment of heart failure after cardiac surgery and has become increasingly accepted in the treatment of adults with lung injury who cannot be oxygenated by conventional means. 1 Technological advances, facilitating the implementation of ECMO in critical care, have improved outcomes for patients with ARDS. 1 Improved technology combined with an increasing confi dence in the use of ECMO from shared experiences reported at international meetings and through registries such as the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO), has led to a substantial increase in its use (fi gure). Our analysis of the US Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database shows that during the past decade, ECMO support after heart surgery (post-cardiotomy) and for respiratory failure has increased by more than six times. 2 Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and H1N1 fl u epidemics showed the need for lifesaving technologies and the ability of ECMO to potentially address this need in the treatment of ARDS; 1 after its successful application in these outbreaks in 2007, rates of ECMO use for respiratory failure rapidly increased. 3, 4 Portable ECMO devices are now available to allow ECMO initiation outside of a hospital setting. Some French, German, and Taiwanese centres have reported the feasibility of use of ECMO for cardiopulmonary arrest by trained interdisciplinary teams. 5, 6, 7 The French fi eld ECMO programme was established to specifi cally deal with the anticipated need for mobile ECMO in an H1N1 epidemic. 5 This programme enhanced the possibility of incorporating ECMO into comprehensive emergency preparedness programmes as a medical Michael Donne/Science Photo Library countermeasure against epidemics or terrorist actions that could lead to ARDS. However, evidence on its use in this type of setting is limited. Although clinical information from case series, trials, and the ELSO registry provide some data, similar to other devices for disaster preparedness regimens, these devices cannot be fully tested until disaster situations arise. Bleeding, embolic, and infectious complications inherent in the use of ECMO might be increased when used in mass casualty settings in inexperienced hands. Indications for the use of ECMO could be inadvertently or erroneously expanded to include healthier patients in view of present enthusiasm for the technology because of its success in treating patients with H1N1 or SARS. Furthermore, ECMO might not be discontinued in futile cases whereby its further use leads to needless prolongation of patient discomfort and an inappropriate use of scare resources. All these factors make regulatory approval and consideration of ECMO as a medical countermeasure challenging; however, approval is needed to allow production and dissemination of suffi cient devices for use in a publichealth emergency.\n\nFrom a regulatory perspective, the development of ECMO as a medical countermeasure needs to follow a diff erent pathway to the usual process. It invites an even more radical change than the innovation pathway used by the US Food and Drug Administration. 8 The type and number of patients aff ected by acts of bioterrorism or public-health emergencies that ECMO could treat is unknown; the device cannot be fully tested until those situations occur. For present approved devices, including ECMO, the approach to their use will be based on present clinical evidence, modelling, and expert opinion. For novel devices that are potential medical countermeasures, diff erent types and thresholds of evidence are needed to accelerate approval. Appropriate systems of assessment need to be developed that can incorporate new concepts for using accumulated data as surrogate evidence of eff ectiveness (and safety) in medical countermeasure settings to allow ECMOs to be included into strategies of preparedness without delays. The amount and type of evidence will vary depending on whether the device used poses high clinical risks (eg, ECMO) or low clinical risks (eg, a novel type of wound dressing).\n\nAn important consideration for regulatory bodies in approving devices for public-health emergencies is defi ning the indications for their use to prohibit inappropriate and futile care. An infrastructure is needed to develop decision support systems for the use of these devices by health-care professionals and to develop simulations of their use in public health emergencies. Regulatory bodies should formulate new policies to ensure eff ective medical care is provided and that ethical concerns of health-care professionals, patients, and families are addressed. Formal defi nitions of circumstances that these devices should be used in would reduce the burden on physicians in deciding when a device is appropriate or when its use is futile.\n\nGovernmental and professional agencies worldwide should collaborate to build a framework for the most appropriate use of ECMO in public-health emergencies. Such a framework would need to include the evidence needed for regulatory approval and the various clinical, ethical, and fi nancial aspects of ECMO availability and use. Combined global experiences from implementation of ECMO in infl uenza epidemics, as done already in many countries, could be the fi rst phase of such a framework. In addition to this framework, the development of new systems for data collection and plans to incorporate new technologies, such as ECMO, is imperative. Guidance on the policy debate now could lead to a measured and thoughtful use of these technologies when a disaster occurs. \n\nThe Trial 1 by Kafk a leaves the reader with a lasting impression of engagement with an untouchable, imposed, and bureaucratic process. The protagonist struggles to make sense of a complex machinery of forces that are beyond his control and hinder his daily life. Although these fi ctional trials and tribulations represent an extreme, today's respiratory and other medical researchers similarly fi nd themselves unable to move forward with translational research because, in many instances, of rules beyond their control. This sentiment was prominent at the European Respiratory Society Presidential Summit, 2 \"Breaking down barriers to lung health: a better environment for better medicines\", held in Rome from July 2-3, 2014. The meeting took place under the auspices of the Italian Presidency of the Council of the European Union, which has identifi ed respiratory diseases as a priority. 3 By today's exigent rules, even aspirin or corticosteroids would not adhere with standards of the regulatory system. There is enormous attrition with only one approved drug from 10 000 starting molecules and the process takes around 15 years from drug discovery to regulatory approval. 4 Unsurprisingly, in respiratory medicine, there have been only nine new classes of therapy in the past 40 years. 5 Respiratory medicine has the lowest success rate of any therapeutic area in bringing new drugs to market, with 3% of drugs entering clinical trials gaining approval. 6 An overly complex regulatory environment and exaggerated concerns about safety have been powerful disincentives for people who might have otherwise become involved in drug research.\n\nDevelopment of a new drug costs about 1\u00b75 billion dollars 7 and has to comply with high expectations, have a clear mechanistic proof of concept, and defi ned effi cacy end-points. In terms of respiratory drug development, specifi c challenges need to be overcome, namely an incomplete understanding of pathophysiology of disease and a need for a better understanding of surrogate endpoints, making proof of concept diffi cult with novel innovative compounds. There is little doubt that the insistence on FEV 1 as the primary endpoint for treatments of obstructive airway disease has hampered development of new drugs because too much research has focused on this endpoint to the detriment of other potential endpoints.\n\nAn analysis of respiratory drug discovery (presented by the European Medicines Agency [EMA] at the Rome Summit) showed that during 2010-12, 8 only eight of 141 innovative medicines licensed by the EMA referred to respiratory drugs (excluding cancer and anti-infective drugs). An explanation can be found within the framework that governs clinical trials in Europe. The European Commission reported that"}
