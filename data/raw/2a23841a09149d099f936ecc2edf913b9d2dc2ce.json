In 2001, the total cost of COPD in Europe was reported to be \u20ac38.7 billion. 6 Considerable progress has been made concerning the epidemiology, pathophysiology and clinical management of COPD in recent years. However, significant challenges remain. Improved understanding of acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) is a key research priority. AECOPD are highly relevant clinically, being a major cause of COPD-related morbidity and mortality, 7-11 as well as accounting for a substantial proportion of the significant social, healthcare and economic burden of COPD. 6 It has been estimated that AECOPD account for approximately 70% of total healthcare costs associated with COPD. 12 Patients with Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stage II or more disease experience 1 or 2 exacerbations annually. Exacerbation varies from patient to patient with severity of disease. 13 Various triggers for AECOPD have been identified; 1 however, up to 75% of all exacerbations are associated with the detection of bacterial and/or viral respiratory pathogens. 14, 15 Exacerbations associated with detectable respiratory pathogens have been shown to have a more marked impact on 14 With the introduction of new molecular sequencing techniques, the traditional belief that healthy lungs are sterile has been refuted. There is increasing evidence that the lower respiratory tract contains a diverse microbial flora that differs between health and disease. [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] The presence of potentially pathogenic microorganisms in the inflamed airways of patients with COPD is well-documented, with up to 50% of patients with stable COPD showing evidence of lower airway bacterial colonisation using traditional culture techniques. 15, 21, 22 In patients with COPD, bacterial detection in lower airway derived samples is associated with increased airway inflammation, reduced lung function and more frequent exacerbations. [23] [24] [25] Acquisition of new pathogen strains also appears to be associated with an increased risk of AECOPD. 15, 21, 26 Estimates of the relative contribution of different pathogens to AECOPD vary. However, non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae appears to be the major bacterial pathogen associated with AECOPD, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 14, 15 Respiratory viruses commonly associated with AECOPD include human rhinoviruses, influenza and parainfluenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus and adenovirus. 15 Improved understanding of the role of infectious pathogens in AECOPD may lead to the development of more targeted strategies for treatment and prevention. This \n\nThe primary objective of the AERIS study is to estimate the incidence of all-cause AECOPD and of AECOPD with sputum containing bacterial pathogens (overall and by species).

Any additional laboratory tests will be performed at a GSK designated laboratory.\n\nThe sample size calculation was based on the primary study endpoint of incidence of So a sample size of 120 subjects should ensure sufficient precision in the estimation of the incidence rate of all-cause AECOPDs.\n\nAdditionally, in order to follow effectively 120 subjects, given the fact that subjects may be eligible but withdraw quite early in the study possibly due to the 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y   18 deterioration of the subject's health, the decision was taken to replace subjects who withdrew during the first year of follow-up, and recruit additional subjects.\n\nThe co-primary study endpoints are the occurrence of all-cause AECOPD and the occurrence of AECOPD having sputum containing bacterial pathogens as detected by culture (overall and by species). The proportion of subjects at each visit for whom a sputum sample was obtained will be computed; overall and by the method the samples were obtained (spontaneous or induced). The proportion of sputum samples obtained at each visit and positive for specific bacterial pathogens (overall and by bacterial species) will also be calculated. The incidence rate of all-cause AECOPD and of AECOPD having sputum containing bacterial pathogens (overall and by bacterial species) will be calculated, with 95% CI. The 95% CI of the incidence rate will be computed using a model which accounts for repeated events, namely the generalised linear model assuming a negative binomial distribution for the response variable with logarithm as link function, and the logarithm of time for follow-up as an offset variable as a preliminary approach. Other flexible approaches to statistical analysis may also be used. In addition, the same model with covariates (e.g. smoking status at enrolment, number of moderate/severe exacerbations reported in the 12 months prior to enrolment, presence of respiratory pathogenic bacteria detected at the exacerbation visit and at previous visits) will be applied. Incidence rates will also be calculated for moderate AECOPD and for severe AECOPD.\n\nThe AERIS study is conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and\n\nGood Clinical Practice guidelines, and has been approved by the relevant institutional The results obtained will be disseminated by presentations at international medical conferences and peer-reviewed publications.\n\nThe AERIS study has been initiated to assess the role of infectious pathogens in AECOPD in a well-characterised cohort of patients. The study aims at exploring the dynamics of airway infection and its possible contribution to AECOPD, as well as the potential role of chronic colonization in stable disease. The overall objective of the study will aim at refining the case definition of AECOPD to reflect the possible microbiological aetiology of exacerbations. This is of note, since there is currently no commonly agreed definition of AECOPD and no current case definition includes a microbiological endpoint. The impact of AECOPD on health-related quality-of-life and healthcare use will be assessed in order to provide a complete picture of disease burden. The interaction between airway infection and systemic manifestations of COPD and nutritional status will also be assessed. Biological specimens collected during the study may also be used for further disease-related testing, including COPD, to explore cell-mediated immune response to specific bacterial antigens, and to develop non-invasive bacterial diagnostic methods.\n\nTo our knowledge, few other studies have employed real-time electronic tracking of symptoms to identify AECOPD and potential aetiological triggers. This is important since available data suggest that up to 50% of exacerbations may not be reported to healthcare providers and consequently exacerbation rates are lower in studies employing event-based criteria to define AECOPD. 36 Due to the close daily monitoring of symptoms to identify AECOPD, we anticipate that the exacerbation rate in this study will be higher than previously reported. This close monitoring and early therapeutic intervention at exacerbation may also impact on estimates of the overall burden of disease.\n\nA number of other epidemiological studies have been initiated in recent years to further characterize our understanding of the natural history of AECOPD. However, most of these studies have not included molecular microbiological assessments.\n\nRecent large observational studies focusing on biomarker discovery have involved close phenotyping of COPD patients, but have not studied the aetiology of exacerbations in depth. [37] [38] [39] In another study, potentially pathogenic bacterial strains were identified using molecular typing techniques, although viruses as potential airway pathogens were not investigated. 21 More recently, the prevalence and load of airway bacteria in stable and exacerbated AECOPD have been assessed in paired samples from 52 patients participating in the London COPD cohort study using modern molecular techniques. 19 Airway bacterial prevalence and load was found to increase significantly during AECOPD, with quantitative molecular techniques proving more discriminatory than culture. However, assessment was limited to only 17, 18, 20, 40, 41 In AERIS, samples will be acquired during both AECOPD and stable disease and analysed for a wide range of potentially pathogenic bacteria and viruses using advanced PCR-based techniques as well as traditional culture-based methods.\n\nA major strength of the AERIS study design is the comprehensive assessment of clinical status, microbiology, functional status, nutritional status, health-related quality-of-life and healthcare resource utilisation in individual patients in a single large cohort during both stable COPD and AECOPD. The analyses proposed in this study will generate epidemiological data to complement that derived from existing COPD cohorts and further explore determinants of COPD and the contribution of bacterial and viral pathogens to AECOPD, as well as to provide some understanding of the limitations of existing data. As exacerbation visits are triggered by patient diary data, accurate and timely diary completion is essential. All subjects participating in this study receive diary training at enrolment and support is available from the study team at all times to promote accurate and complete diary keeping. Cohort retention is a key factor in the successful delivery of such a study and with in-depth sampling protocols, participant engagement, comfort and feedback are key factors in optimising cohort retention and comprehensive data collection.\n\nIdentification of novel approaches for the prevention of AECOPD is an important research goal. Long-acting beta-agonists (LABA) and long-acting anti-muscarinic bronchodilators remain the cornerstone of treatment for patients with COPD. 42\n\nCombinations of LABA and inhaled corticosteroids are also used in patients with more severe disease and/or frequent exacerbations. Long-term treatment with Numerous other approaches are under investigation for the prevention of AECOPD, including anti-inflammatory drugs, immunomodulatory agents, immunotherapy, antioxidants and non-pharmacologic strategies. Vaccination is another potential approach meriting investigation for reducing AECOPD risk. However, optimal strategies targeting key respiratory pathogens are not yet available to the clinician.\n\nIn conclusion, there have been considerable advances in our understanding of the epidemiology, pathophysiology and clinical management of COPD in recent years.\n\nHowever, there remains a genuine need to further explore the aetiology and pathogenesis of AECOPD. It is anticipated that results of this epidemiological study will increase our understanding of the contribution of bacterial and viral pathogens to AECOPD, potentially leading to research into targeted therapeutic and preventative interventions.\n\nContributors S.

Secondary study objectives are summarised in table 1.\n\nOverview of primary and secondary objectives of the AERIS study Level Objective Primary \u2022 To estimate the incidence rate of all-cause AECOPD \u2022 To estimate the incidence rate of AECOPD having sputum containing bacterial pathogens (overall and by species)\n\n\u2022 To describe the proportion of overall and specific bacterial pathogens detected in sputum by severity of AECOPD\n\n\u2022 To describe the proportion of overall and specific bacterial pathogens detected in sputum in stable COPD\n\n\u2022 To estimate the incidence rate of AECOPD having sputum containing viral pathogens (overall and by species)\n\n\u2022 To describe the proportion of overall and specific viral pathogens detected in sputum by severity of AECOPD \n\nThis is an ongoing, single-centre, prospective, observational cohort study based at University Hospital Southampton, UK.\n\nMale \n\nIn addition to the daily monitoring undertaken through the patient-completed electronic diary cards, a wide range of study procedures are performed at study entry, scheduled monthly visits and exacerbation visits (table 3) . 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 A postero-anterior chest X-ray (and lateral if required) is performed at all exacerbation visits, as per standard clinical practice, in order to exclude pneumonia.\n\nVarious outcomes are assessed quarterly and at exacerbation using a series of questionnaires and patient-reported outcomes instruments such as the COPD Assessment Test (CAT), 31 the Nottingham Extended Daily Activities Scale (NEADL), 32 the Council on Nutrition Appetite Questionnaire (CNAQ), 33 and the EQ-5D. 34 The five items included in the EQ-5D index are mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. The BODE index (Body-Mass Index, Degree of Airflow Obstruction, Level of Functional Dyspnea, Exercise\n\nCapacity) 35 will also be calculated.\n\nHealthcare use is recorded at all visits, including medication, vaccination, oxygen therapy, use of mechanical ventilation, pulmonary rehabilitation treatment, surgical intervention, outpatient visits (including GP visits and telephone contacts to COPD team), emergency room visits, hospitalisations, and productivity loss (time missed from work or usual activities due to worsening of COPD symptoms). Potential changes in disease management following an exacerbation (e.g. change in medication use) are also recorded.\n\nA wide range of biological specimens are collected from study participants (table 3) .\n\nBlood samples are collected from all patients at study entry, quarterly and at exacerbation.

Any additional laboratory tests will be performed at a GSK designated laboratory.\n\nThe sample size calculation was based on the primary study endpoint of incidence of So a sample size of 120 subjects should ensure sufficient precision in the estimation of the incidence rate of all-cause AECOPDs.\n\nAdditionally, in order to follow effectively 120 subjects, given the fact that subjects may be eligible but withdraw quite early in the study possibly due to the deterioration of the subject's health, the decision was taken to replace subjects who withdrew during the first year of follow-up, and recruit additional subjects.\n\nWe will construct a CONSORT diagram and capture where possible reasons for screen failure, drop-outs and loss to follow-up. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 \n\nThe co-primary study endpoints are the occurrence of all-cause AECOPD and the occurrence of AECOPD having sputum containing bacterial pathogens as detected by culture (overall and by species). The proportion of subjects at each visit for whom a sputum sample was obtained will be computed; overall and by the method the samples were obtained (spontaneous or induced). The proportion of sputum samples obtained at each visit and positive for specific bacterial pathogens (overall and by bacterial species) will also be calculated. The incidence rate of all-cause AECOPD and of AECOPD having sputum containing bacterial pathogens (overall and by bacterial species) will be calculated, with 95% CI. The 95% CI of the incidence rate will be computed using a model which accounts for repeated events, namely the generalised linear model assuming a negative binomial distribution for the response variable with logarithm as link function, and the logarithm of time for follow-up as an offset variable as a preliminary approach. Other flexible approaches to statistical analysis may also be used. In addition, the same model with covariates (e.g. smoking status at enrolment, number of moderate/severe exacerbations reported in the 12 months prior to enrolment, presence of respiratory pathogenic bacteria detected at the exacerbation visit and at previous visits) will be applied. Incidence rates will also be calculated for moderate AECOPD and for severe AECOPD.\n\nThe AERIS study is conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and\n\nGood Clinical Practice guidelines, and has been approved by the relevant institutional ethics and review board. All subjects must provide written informed consent to participate. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 The results obtained will be disseminated by presentations at international medical conferences and peer-reviewed publications. Reporting will be in accordance with STROBE guidance.\n\nThe AERIS study has been initiated to comprehensively assess the role of infectious pathogens in AECOPD in a well-characterised cohort of patients. The study aims atot exploreing the dynamics of airway infection and its possible contribution to AECOPD, as well as the potential role of chronic colonization in stable disease. The overall objective of the study will aim at refining the case definition of AECOPD to reflect the possible microbiological aetiology of exacerbations. This is of note, since there is currently no commonly agreed definition of AECOPD and no current case definition includes a microbiological endpoint. The impact of AECOPD on healthrelated quality-of-life and healthcare use will be assessed in order to provide a complete picture of disease burden. The interaction between airway infection and systemic manifestations of COPD and nutritional status will also be assessed in detail for the first time. Biological specimens collected during the study may also be used for further disease-related testing, including molecular typing to describe and compare 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 To our knowledge, few other studies have employed real-time electronic tracking of symptoms to identify AECOPD and potential aetiological triggers. This is important since available data suggest that up to 50% of exacerbations may not be reported to healthcare providers and consequently exacerbation rates are lower in studies employing event-based criteria to define AECOPD. 36 Due to the close daily monitoring of symptoms to identify AECOPD, we anticipate that the exacerbation rate in this study will be higher than previously reported. This close monitoring and early therapeutic intervention at exacerbation may also impact on estimates of the overall burden of disease.\n\nA number of other epidemiological studies have been initiated in recent years to further characterize our understanding of the natural history of AECOPD. However, it is important to recognise that most of these studies have not included molecular microbiological assessments. Recent large observational studies focusing on biomarker discovery have involved close phenotyping of COPD patients, but have not studied the aetiology of exacerbations in depth. [37] [38] [39] In another study, potentially pathogenic bacterial strains were identified using molecular typing techniques, although viruses as potential airway pathogens were not investigated. 21 More recently, the prevalence and load of airway bacteria in stable and exacerbated AECOPD have been assessed in paired samples from 52 patients participating in the London COPD cohort study using modern molecular techniques. 19 Airway bacterial prevalence and load was found to increase significantly during AECOPD, with quantitative molecular techniques proving more discriminatory than culture. However, assessment was pneumoniae, and M. catarrhalis). However, other potential pathogens and the overall respiratory microbiome may also contribute and have not yet been studied in detail. 17, 18, 20, 40, 41 In AERIS, samples will be acquired during both AECOPD and stable disease and analysed for a wide range of potentially pathogenic bacteria and viruses using advanced PCR-based techniques as well as traditional culture-based methods.\n\nA major strength of the AERIS study design is the comprehensive assessment of clinical status, microbiology, functional status, nutritional status, health-related quality-of-life and healthcare resource utilisation in individual patients in a single large cohort during both stable COPD and AECOPD. The selection of subjects with a history of at least a single exacerbation enriches the cohort to some degree and ensures an adequate number of exacerbations are sampled. It is accepted that some aspects of the analysis may not be generalizable to the subgroup of patients who never exacerbate. The analyses proposed in this study will generate epidemiological data to complement that derived from existing COPD cohorts and further explore determinants of COPD and the contribution of bacterial and viral pathogens to AECOPD, as well as to provide some understanding of the limitations of existing data. As exacerbation visits are triggered by patient diary data, accurate and timely diary completion is essential. All subjects participating in this study receive diary training at enrolment and support is available from the study team at all times to promote accurate and complete diary keeping. Cohort retention is a key factor in the successful delivery of such a study and with in-depth sampling protocols, participant engagement, comfort and feedback are key factors in optimising cohort retention and comprehensive data collection. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 Combinations of LABA and inhaled corticosteroids are also used in patients with more severe disease and/or frequent exacerbations. Long-term treatment with macrolide antibiotics and pulsed quinolone therapy may be considered for exacerbation prevention. 7, 43, 44 However, concerns exist about the potential for development of antimicrobial resistance during long-term antibiotic therapy.\n\nNumerous other approaches are under investigation for the prevention of AECOPD, including anti-inflammatory drugs, immunomodulatory agents, immunotherapy, antioxidants and non-pharmacologic strategies. Vaccination is another potential approach meriting investigation for reducing AECOPD risk. However, optimal strategies targeting key respiratory pathogens are not yet available to the clinician.\n\nIn conclusion, there have been considerable advances in our understanding of the epidemiology, pathophysiology and clinical management of COPD in recent years.\n\nHowever, there remains a genuine need to further explore the aetiology and pathogenesis of AECOPD. It is anticipated that results of this epidemiological study will increase our understanding of the contribution of bacterial and viral pathogens to AECOPD, the natural history of these events in association with the timing of symptoms and physiological changes, and will offer new direction potentially leading to for research into targeted therapeutic and preventative interventions.\n\nContributors S.
