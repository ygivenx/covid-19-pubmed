{"title": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in children", "body": "He continued to receive supportive treatment and was started on continuous renal replacement therapy due to decreased urine output and worsening renal failure, but he continued to deteriorate, and died 4 days later. No other explanation for the sudden deterioration of the patient could be identified. We could not determine the source of infection in our patient despite extensive investigations, including screening of the healthcare providers who came in contact with the patient in the emergency department, in the pediatric ward, and the PICU, as well as, all the family contact members.\n\nSince the emergence of MERS-CoV, the Prince Sultan Military Medical City in Riyadh has taken extensive measures (the \u201cno risk\u201d policy) to prevent further spread of the disease. Apart from extensive infection control measures, a vast education campaign for the staff and the community including parents and their children was initiated.\n\nIn compliance with the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health recommendations, screening with PCR for MERS-CoV was carried out for every patient that presented or developed fever, and respiratory symptoms with new chest infiltration documented on the chest x-ray. Despite all this extensive screening, and in contrast to what was observed by our colleagues dealing with adult cases in the hospital, our pediatric department could identify only one case of MERS-CoV in a 9-month-old child known to have nephrotic syndrome. Furthermore, out of 701 patients confirmed MERS-CoV reported, so far worldwide, only 14 were pediatric cases (2%).4 Does this mean that MERS-CoV is mainly an adult disease? Or alternatively, does MERS-CoV in children have a different clinical picture, including a less severe disease, or an atypical presentation, or even an asymptomatic carrier state? What are the risk factors, the comorbidities and the outcome? These questions are still unanswered in the pediatric literature. The 14 children with confirmed MERS-CoV have a mean age of 99 months, and they were 8 females and 6 males (Table 1). Nine patients were asymptomatic and were detected during screening of family contact; all these 9 patients were healthy without underlying diseases.5 Three patients developed mild respiratory symptoms,5-7 while the last 2 patients developed severe respiratory symptoms.5 These 2 patients have associated comorbidities. The outcome was good in 12 patients, while the 2 patients with severe respiratory symptoms and comorbidities developed multi-organs dysfunction and died (14.2%).\n\nIt is interesting to note that similar to adults, pediatric patients with poorer outcome develop multi-organ impairment, and mainly renal failure.8 From this small series, compared to adult patients, MERS-CoV in children is less frequent and seems to be associated with less mortality unless the patient has underlying comorbidities. This impression of low mortality in children with MERS-CoV was also reported during the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infections in children, where symptoms were milder, and resulted in no mortality, and few hospitalizations.9 The low incidence of MERS-CoV infection in children is corroborated by a Jordanian prospective year-round viral surveillance study in children less than 2 years of age admitted with acute respiratory symptoms and/or fever from March to September 2010 tested for MERS-CoV, all 474 tested patients were negative.10 We were, unfortunately, unable to identify how our patient got infected.\n\nThree patterns of transmission of the disease are suggested by the literature:11 the first pattern is the occurrence of sporadic cases in communities. The true incidence of the disease in the community is not known. The second pattern is transmission within families. The rate of intrafamilial transmission is not known, but it is estimated to be approximately 3.6%.10 The third transmission pattern is nosocomial transmission from patient to patient, or from a patient to healthcare provider, or vice versa The study by Memish et al11 reported a positivity rate of MERS-CoV by PCR of only 1.12% of all tested health care workers. These data suggest that the recommended infection control measures are adequate to reduce the risk of transmission within healthcare facilities. During our investigations, we focused on the last 2 patterns of transmission, and we searched for any link between our patient and adult patients admitted during the same period with MERS-CoV in our hospital, however we failed to demonstrate any positive contacts.\n\nIn conclusion, these data indicate that although few cases of MERS-CoV in children have been detected, it remains mainly a disease of adults. The disease caused by MERS-CoV in children presents with a wide range of clinical manifestations, and it is associated with a lower mortality rate compared with adults. Poor outcome is observed mainly in admitted patients with medical comorbidities."}
