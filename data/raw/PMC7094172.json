{"title": "Structure-Based\nStabilization of Non-native Protein\u2013Protein\nInteractions of Coronavirus Nucleocapsid Proteins in Antiviral Drug\nDesign", "body": "Small-molecule stabilization\nof protein\u2013protein interactions\n(PPIs) is an extremely promising strategy in drug discovery. It can\nbe used to treat cancers and viral infections.1\u22123 Stabilizing\nPPIs with small molecules may be allosteric or direct (also called\northosteric). This process alters the oligomerization equilibrium\nof the protein and enables small molecules to modulate its physiological\nfunction.4\u22127 The anticancer drug paclitaxel, for example, allosterically enhances\nmicrotubule structure assembly by binding to \u03b2-tubulin.8,9 On the other hand, rapamycin, another anticancer agent, binds directly\nto the interface between FKBP12 and mTOR and stabilizes the structure\nof the complex.10 The most well-characterized\nPPIs suitable as targets for drug development form natively under\nphysiological conditions. However, non-native interactions, which\nmay form under extreme circumstances such as inside a crystal lattice,\nare also potential drug targets. For example, nucleozin exerts its\nantiviral activity by stabilizing the non-native PPI interface between\nthe two neighboring nucleoprotein trimers within the influenza virus,\nwhich results in abnormal protein oligomerization and loss of viral\nviability.11\n\nMiddle East respiratory\nsyndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) belongs\nto the betacoronavirus (\u03b2-CoVs) family. It causes severe respiratory\ndistress with a high mortality rate in humans.12\u221214 Recently, a\nclosely related novel coronavirus, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),\ncaused an outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, which further underscored\nthe risk of CoVs to the global public health.15,16 However, there is no effective treatment for CoVs. Thus, there is\nan urgent need to develop new antiviral agents against CoVs.14,17 MERS-CoV packages its genome in a nucleocapsid (N) protein and forms\na ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. The RNP is essential for viral\ntranscription and assembly. Several studies suggested that the modulation\nof CoV N protein oligomerization by small molecules is a feasible\nantiviral drug development strategy.18,19 The CoV N\nprotein is organized into the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the C-terminal\ndomain (CTD), with both domains participating in RNA binding.20,21 All CoV N-NTD structures are folded in a monomeric conformation.\nIn contrast, the CoV N-CTDs are always dimeric and are responsible\nfor N protein oligomerization via protein\u2013protein interactions.22,23\n\nHere, we report the crystal structure of MERS-CoV N-NTD in\na non-native\ndimeric configuration. We used the non-native dimer interface as the\ntarget in virtual screening for an orthosteric stabilizer. To this\nend, we considered the\nbinding scores and hydrophobic complementarity of the acquired poses,\nand further selected the potential leads P1\u2013P3 from Acros and\nZINC drug databases. Of these, only 5-benzyloxygramine (P3) had both\nantiviral and stabilizing activities on the N protein. Small-angle\nX-ray scattering (SAXS) and cell-based assays showed that P3 induces\nabnormal full-length N protein oligomerization in vitro and at the\ncell level. We also described the structure of MERS-CoV N-NTD complexed\nwith 5-benzyloxygramine and revealed its stabilizing mechanism. Our\nfindings provide insight into the development of a new therapeutic\napproach based on stabilizing a non-native protein interaction interface.\nIt may lead to the discovery and development of new treatments for\nvarious infectious diseases.\n\nWe determined the crystal\nstructure of MERS-CoV N-NTD by molecular\nreplacement (MR) using the structure of HCoV-OC43 N-NTD (PDB ID: 4J3K) as the search model.24 The final structure was refined to R-factor\nand R-free values of 0.26 and 0.29, respectively, at a resolution\nof 2.6 \u00c5 (Table S1). Each asymmetric\nunit contained four N-NTD molecules assembled into two identical dimers\nwith an overall RMSD of 0.28 \u00c5 between the dimers (Figure S1A,B). The monomers shared a similar\nstructural core preceded by a flexible region (Figure S1D). The core consisted of a five-stranded antiparallel\n\u03b2-sheet sandwiched between loops arranged in a right-handed,\nfist-shaped structure conserved among the CoVs.25 In our structure, however, the loop connecting strands\n\u03b22 and \u03b23 protruding out of the core into other CoV N\nproteins was absent. Unlike the reported structures that have a monomeric\nconformation, our structure was atypically dimeric.\n\nFigure 1B shows the details\nof the interactions in the MERS-CoV N protein dimer. We named the\nunits monomer 1 and monomer 2 (Figure 1A). According to the amino acid composition of the\nbinding site on monomer 2, we divided the dimeric interface into two\nareas: one located on the N-terminus flexible region and the other\non the loop between \u03b24 and \u03b25 of the N protein. In the\nfirst area, W43, N66, N68, Y102, and F135 of monomer 1 generated a\nconserved hydrophobic pocket permitting the side chain of M38 of monomer\n2 to enter this hole by a hydrophobic contact (Figure 1C,D). H37 and N39 of monomer 2 were packed\nagainst W43 and F135 of monomer 1, respectively, and contributed to\nthe hydrophobic interaction. The side chains of N39 of monomer 2 formed\none hydrogen bond with the N68 backbone in monomer 1 at a distance\nof 2.6 \u00c5. The second area was relatively more hydrophilic. The\nmain chain oxygens of G104, F135, and T137 of monomer 2 formed three\nhydrogen bonds with the side chains of Q73 and T134 of monomer 1 at\ndistances of 3.8, 3.2, and 3.7 \u00c5, respectively. The side chain\nof N139 on monomer 2 formed a hydrogen bond with the main chain oxygen\nof T137 on monomer 1 at a distance of 3.6 \u00c5. The interactions\nof the first and second areas comprise buried surface areas (BSA)\nof 289 and 103 \u00c52, respectively. The small surface\narea buried at the interface accounts for \u223c5 kcal mol\u20131 binding energy,26 which translates to\na dissociation constant of \u223c200 mM. Thus, the dimer described\nhere is unique in that it is non-native and relies on vector-fusion\nresidues (H37 and M38) to maintain its dimeric status. This property\nmay also explain why the present structure has an oligomeric status\ndifferent from previously reported structures for the CoV N protein.24,27\u221230 We used cross-linking experiments to analyze the oligomeric capacity\nof MERS N-NTD containing the vector-fusion residues in solution. MERS\nN-NTD had a dimeric conformation in solution. Our structure indicated\nthat W43 played an essential role in forming the hydrophobic pocket\naccommodating the vector-fusion residues and, therefore, mediated\nthe N-NTD dimer formation. The W43A mutation significantly reduced\nthe oligomeric tendency of N-NTD (Figure S1C). This further supports that the \u201cexogenous residues\u201d\nencoded by the vector backbone mediated the formation of the non-native\ndimer. We also superimposed the previously published structure of\nMERS-CoV N-NTD (PDB ID: 4ud1)27 containing a native\nN-terminal flexible region with our dimer structure. The side chain\nof N38 in the native structure could not interact with the hydrophobic\npocket as the former is hydrophilic and short (Figure S1E). Thus, it may be possible to utilize small compounds\nto replace the vector-fusion residues and stabilize the PPI through\nhydrophobic interactions.\n\nWe performed a structure-based virtual screening\nby targeting W43 in the hydrophobic pocket of the N-NTD dimeric interface.\nH37 and M38 were removed from the template to identify compounds that\ncould replace the vector-fusion residues and, therefore, contribute\nto the stabilizing effect (Figures 2A and S2A,B). We chose the\nhighest-scoring hits, listed in Table S2, based on shape complementarity, the presence of aromatic moieties,\nand the ability to stack onto W43 of N-NTD. Because the formation\nof the non-native dimers was primarily mediated by hydrophobic interactions\nin our structure (Figure 1C,D), we next considered the hydrophobic complementarity between\nthe acquired ligands and N-NTD in the form of the lipophilic match\nsurface (SL/L).31 We also took into account the ability of the drug to permeate cells\nby aiming for lower topological polar surface areas (TPSA). Based\non the above criteria, three compounds were finally chosen for further\nstudy. Benzyl-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1-indolinecarboxylate (P1) and 5-benzyloxygramine\n(P3) had higher SL/L and docking scores\nand lower TPSA. The clinical drug etodolac (P2) had a comparable SL/L but a lower docking score. It too was selected\nas a candidate.\nHowever, only P3 induced a comparatively larger blue shift in the\nintrinsic N-NTD fluorescence spectrum, indicating that the microenvironment\nsurrounding the tryptophans of the protein increased in rigidity and\nhydrophobicity in the presence of P3.32 The result also indicated that P3 bound more tightly to the N protein\nthan P1 or P2 by interacting with the W43 pocket (Figure 2B). Fluorescent thermal stability\nassays disclosed that the N-NTD denaturation melting temperature had\nincreased from 42 to 45 \u00b0C when P3 was added. The sigmoidal melting\ncurve for MERS-CoV N-NTD changed in the presence of P3. The delay\nin protein denaturation suggests that P3 stabilized the MERS-CoV N-NTD\ndimer structure (Figure 2C). We then measured the cytotoxic concentration (CC50) and effective concentration (EC50) for each compound\nusing Vero E6 cells infected with MERS-CoV. Table 1 shows that P3 had a favorable therapeutic\nindex among the lead compounds tested in this study. Therefore, P3\nis an excellent candidate inhibitor against MERS-CoV.\n\nWe used SAXS to assess the\neffects of P3 on the full-length MERS-CoV\nN protein structure. The fitted distance distribution function of\nthe protein with and without P3 are shown in Figure 3A. P3 increased the maximum dimension (Dmax) and radius of gyration (Rg) of the protein from 207 to 230 \u00c5 and from 58 to\n65 \u00c5, respectively. Thus, the size of the MERS-CoV N protein\nin solution was altered upon binding to P3.\n\nThe presence of multiple intrinsically disordered regions in the\nN protein precluded the determination of its structure by X-ray crystallography.\nInstead, we used rigid body modeling of the SAXS data with the N-terminal\ndomain (NTD; solved in this study) and the C-terminal domains (CTD,\nPDB ID: 6G13).23 In this way, we obtained structural\nmodels for the free N protein and its complex with P3 (Figure 3B,C). Excellent fits were obtained.\nRepresentative structural models for the full-length protein without\nand with P3 are shown in Figure 3D,E, respectively. The free N protein formed a tetramer\nthrough CTD with the NTD freely hanging in solution (Figure 3D). The conformation of the\nsolution was consistent with structures previously reported for other\nCoV N proteins.33 The N-P3 complex formed\na compact hexadecamer with a sunburst configuration (Figure 3E). The CTDs formed a central\nring and non-native NTD dimers formed \u201cspikes\u201d protruding\nfrom the ring. Consistent with ligand-induced aggregation, we observed\na \u201cblue shift\u201d in the fluorescence spectrum of the full-length\nMERS-CoV N protein in the presence of P3 (Figure 3F). The addition of P3 also delayed N protein\nthermal denaturation and changed the shape of the denaturation curve,\nfurther suggesting that large protein aggregates formed in the presence\nof P3 (Figure 3G).\nThe structure explains how N-NTD dimerization decreased MERS-CoV viability.\nThe N protein packages the viral genome into an RNP complex. Several\nmodels for N-CTD dimer assembly have been proposed for the formation\nof filamentous RNPs.33 All of the proposed\ninterfaces between N-CTD dimers occurred on the side-faces of the\nCTD cuboid perpendicular to the proposed RNA-binding surface (Figure 3H). Combinatorial\nuse of any region on the side-faces of the CTD dimer cuboid may facilitate\nmanipulation of the RNP length and curvature without obstructing the\nRNA-binding surface.28,34 However, the SAXS results indicated\nthat N-CTD aggregation occurred on the \u03b2-sheet floor of the\nCTD cuboid. For this reason, the RNA-binding surface of the CTD is\noccluded by the neighboring CTD on the ring and by the non-native\nNTD dimer making direct contact with the CTD (Figures 3H and S3). In\naddition, the CTD cuboids in the aggregation naturally form a topologically\nclosed octamer, leaving no open ends for further addition of CTD cuboids\nto form a long filamentous RNP. Both the loss of the RNA-binding surface\nand the inability to incorporate further N protein molecules beyond\nan octamer may inhibit the formation of the RNP. Therefore, P3 may\ninhibit MERS-CoV RNP formation by inducing N protein aggregation.\n\nWe\ndemonstrated that P3 had the best characteristics as a therapeutic\ncandidate. To determine the anti-MERS-CoV activity of P3 in the cell,\nthe effects of P3 incubation on extracellular viral titers and intracellular\nviral RNA levels were assessed by plaque assays on Vero E6 cells (Figure 4A) and by RT-qPCR\n(Figure 4B), respectively.\nAt 50 \u03bcM, P3 marginally affected the viral titer after 48 h\nbut suppressed viral RNA replication by 40%. At 100 \u03bcM, P3 halted\nboth viral production and replication after 48 h. This result proved\nthe capacity of P3 as an antiviral compound. We then examined MERS-CoV\nN protein distribution and expression in the infected cells with or\nwithout P3 treatment to confirm our SAXS findings. Immunofluorescence\nmicroscopy (Figure 4C) showed condensation of the intracellular N protein fluorescence\nsignal in infected Vero E6 cells treated with 50 \u03bcM P3. Thus,\nP3 may induce intracellular N protein aggregation. At 100 \u03bcM,\nP3 suppressed N protein expression in most cells. However, a few presented\nwith intense N protein signals. P3 may have restrained the MERS-CoV\nN proteins inside the infected cells that promoted the formation of\nnew virions that could not be released. In this way, the adjacent\ncells could not be infected with MERS-CoV. The data, therefore, suggest\nthat P3 may inhibit MERS-CoV by inducing abnormal aggregation of the\nN protein inside the cell. This finding is consistent with the results\nof our structure-based assays.\n\nWe attempted to obtain crystals of MERS-CoV N-NTD in complex with\ncompounds P1, P2, and P3 by cocrystallization or ligand-soaking. With\nthe exception of P2, the complex structures of N-NTD with P1 and P3\nwere solved at resolutions of 3.09 and 2.77 \u00c5, respectively (Table S1). The overall structures of the complexes\nresembled that of apo-MERS-CoV. Both complexes revealed well-defined\nunbiased densities in the dimer interface and permitted detailed analysis\nof the interactions between the compounds and MERS-CoV N-NTD (Figure 5). The interactions\nbetween the N protein and each compound were calculated with the Discovery\nStudio Client (v19.1.0.18287). Most interactions were hydrophobic\ncontacts, which were consistent with our selection rationale. In the\nP1 complex, N68, F135, and D143 on monomer 1 and V41, G106, P107,\nand T137 on monomer 2 packed against P1 to create a dimer (Figure 5A). In addition,\ntwo nonbonding interactions were detected between P1 and the monomers.\nThere was a \u03c0-anion interaction between the benzene ring of\nthe P1 indoline moiety and D143 of monomer 1. There was also a \u03c0-donor\nhydrogen bond between the other P1 benzene ring and the T137 side\nchain of monomer 2 (Figure 5B). Relative to P1, P3 bound more deeply into the dimer interface\nand interacted with a larger number of residues on both N-NTD monomers.\nThe amino acid composition of this binding region was W43, N66, N68,\nS69, T70, N73, and F135 on monomer 1 and V41, G104, T105, G106, A109,\nand T137 on monomer 2. These residues along with P3 generated a massive\nhydrophobic driving force allowing the proteins and ligands to pack\nagainst each other and stabilize the dimeric conformation of the N\nprotein (Figure 5C).\nSeveral nonbonding interactions were also observed at the P3-binding\nsite. These included the interaction between the P3 benzene ring and\nN68 of monomer 1 and A109 of monomer 2 via \u03c0-lone pair and \u03c0-alkyl\ninteractions. The dimethylaminomethyl moiety of P3 was a major source\nof nonbonding interactions. Three \u03c0-cation interactions formed\nbetween this moiety and the aromatic groups of W43 and F135 in monomer\n1. This moiety also formed a \u03c0-lone pair interaction with N66\nand a \u03c0-sigma interaction with W43 of monomer 1 (Figure 5D). The structural analyses\nexplain the comparatively stronger binding of P3 to N-NTD (Figure 2B) and corroborated\nthe thermal stabilization effects (Figure 2C) and antiviral activities (Table 1) of the compounds.\n\nThe use of small molecules\nto stabilize PPI interfaces has been\nshown to be a viable approach for the development of new therapeutics.\nMost compounds created by structure-based design to manipulate the\nPPI depend on detailed knowledge of the native interacting interfaces.35\u221237 In contrast, most of the compounds with therapeutic potential that\nstabilize non-native PPI interfaces were discovered by chance alone.38 The anti-influenza compound nucleozin was initially\ndiscovered using a chemical genetics approach, and its ability to\nstabilize non-native nucleoprotein oligomers was elucidated much later.39,40 Swinholide A, a cytotoxic marine macrolide, has been known to disrupt\nthe actin cytoskeleton and act as an anticancer agent, but it took\nten years to discover that it stabilized G-actin as a non-native homodimer\ncomplex.41\u221243 However, these examples did underscore the importance\nof hydrophobicity as a crucial factor stabilizing protein\u2013protein\nand protein\u2013ligand associations.44 Here, we demonstrated the possibility of using the hydrophobic interactions\non non-native interfaces as targets for virtual screening. Combined\nwith suitable selection criteria focusing on both shape and hydrophobic\ncomplementarities between the ligand and the receptor, small-molecule\ncompounds that stabilize non-native PPIs may be identified in a rational\nmanner. Using the above approach, we successfully identified a compound\nP3 that affected the biochemical activity of our target protein and\nshowed efficacy against our target pathogen MERS-CoV (Figures 2 and 4). P3-mediated non-native MERS-CoV N-NTD dimerization induced abnormal\nN protein aggregation by influencing the oligomeric behavior of N-CTD\nand eventually halting its function in RNP formation. To the best\nof our knowledge, this structure-based strategy for targeting non-native\ninterfaces has never been proposed for therapeutic design. Thus, non-native\ninteraction interfaces in proteins may comprise a new drug development\ntarget class. For \u03b2-coronaviruses such as MERS-CoV, the amino\nacids comprising the non-native interaction interface on N-NTD are\nrelatively conserved. The hydrophobic pocket surrounding W43 and F135\non monomer 1 is shared among other \u03b2-coronaviruses.24,28 The interacting surface on monomer 2, which includes G104, T105,\nG106, and A109, is also highly conserved (Figure S4). This conservation may provide certain advantages when\ndeveloping compounds with broad-spectrum activity against a target\npathogen family, including COVID-19. When we tested P3 on mouse hepatitis\nvirus (MHV), we observed a reduction in viral titer, indicating that\nP3 may also inhibit MHV replication (Figure S5). On the other hand, targeting non-native interaction interfaces\nis not trivial. As interface formation is induced by an external agent,\ncomputations aimed at predicting native PPI structures may not be\nable to identify potential non-native interfaces. Nevertheless, several\nstratagems may assist in the identification of potential non-native\ninteraction interfaces. One strategy is to search for target protein\nstructures with crystal packing contacts known to be biologically\nirrelevant. Another approach is to identify weakly interacting sites\nthrough NMR chemical shift perturbation and hydrogen-deuterium exchange\nMS.45 Once these potential non-native interaction\ninterfaces are identified, standard screening and then functional\ncharacterization may be conducted for small compounds that bind to\nthe interface.\n\nTo summarize, we demonstrated that non-native\ninteraction interfaces\nmight form when proteins abnormally oligomerize. Using the MERS-CoV\nN protein as an example, we showed that non-native interfaces might\nserve as targets for small-molecule, structure-based screening. We\nalso proposed several stratagems to rationally identify potential\nnon-native interface targets for screening. We believe that we have\ndiscovered and tested an alternative drug discovery paradigm that\ncould help expand the repertoire of lead compounds against various\npathogens.\n\nThe\ncompounds P1, P2, and P3 were purchased\nfrom Maybridge Chemical Company, TCI Chemicals, and Sigma-Aldrich\nCorporation, respectively. The reagents used in this study were purchased\nfrom Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). The purity of all compounds\nis higher than 95% and was used without further purification.\n\nThe MERS-CoV\nN proteins were prepared according to previously described methods.46 In brief, the cDNA fragments of MERS-CoV N proteins\nwere cloned into a pET-28a expression vector (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany)\ncontaining a histidine tag-encoding sequence. Vectors encoding the\nsingle mutants N39A, N39G, and W43A were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis protocol with the primers\nlisted in Table S3. The vectors were transformed\ninto Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS\ncells. The cells were grown to an optical density range of 0.6\u20130.8\nat 600 nm at 37 \u00b0C and protein expression induced with 1.0 mM\nisopropyl \u03b2-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), followed\nby incubation at 10 \u00b0C for 24 h. The cells were harvested by\ncentrifugation (6000g, 12 min, 4 \u00b0C) and resuspended\nin lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 15 mM imidazole, and\n1 mM PMSF; pH 7.5). The cells were lysed by sonication and centrifuged\n(10000g, 40 min, 4 \u00b0C) to remove debris. The\nsupernatant was purified by injection into a Ni\u2013NTA column\n(Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and eluted with buffer containing imidazole\nat a gradient range of 15\u2013300 mM. Pure protein fractions were\ncollected, dialyzed with low-salt buffer, concentrated, and quantified\nby the Bradford method (BioShop Canada Inc., Burlington, ON, Canada).\n\nMERS-CoV N-NTD\ncrystals were grown as previously described:46 MERS-CoV N-NTD was crystallized at room temperature (\u223c25\n\u00b0C) by the sitting-drop vapor-diffusion method. A protein solution\n(2 \u03bcL; 10 mg mL\u20131) was mixed with an equal\nvolume of crystallization solution consisting of 75 mM ammonium sulfate,\n2 mM NaBr, and 29% PEG 3350 (Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO) and\nequilibrated against a 300 \u03bcL solution. MERS-CoV N-NTD:P3 co-crystals\nwere obtained using a crystallization solution containing 2 mM P3.\nMERS-CoV N-NTD crystals in complex with P1 were obtained by soaking\nnative MERS-CoV N-NTD crystals for 90 s at room temperature in a crystallization\nsolution containing 2 mM P1. Diffraction datasets for MERS-CoV N-NTD\nalone and in complex with P1 were collected at beamline 13B1 of the\nTaiwan Light Source (TLS) of the National Synchrotron Research Center\n(NSRRC; Hsinchu City, Taiwan). Diffraction of the MERS-CoV N-NTD:P3\ncomplex was performed at the beamline SP44XU of SPring-8 (Hyogo, Japan).\n\nDiffraction\ndata were processed and scaled with HKL-2000 software. The structures\nwere solved by molecular replacement (MR) in Phenix47 using HCoV-OC43 N-NTD (PDB:4J3K) as the search model.24 The initial models were rebuilt and refined by Coot48 and Phenix. Structures were visualized using\nPyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, version 2.3.0).49\n\nProtein\nsolutions containing\n40 \u03bcM of wild-type or mutated MERS-CoV N-NTD were incubated\nwith glutaraldehyde at a final concentration of 1% v/v. The reaction\nwas conducted at room temperature for 10 min and quenched with the\naddition of 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The samples were then stored on\nice and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis\n(SDS-PAGE).\n\nTo screen for compounds that induce hydrophobic\nPPI between MERS\nN-NTDs, a model of dimeric MERS-CoV N-NTD without the H37 and M38\nresidues was used in virtual drug screening. The Sigma-Aldrich, Acros\nOrganics, and ZINC drug databases were screened with LIBDOCK molecular\ndocking software to obtain compounds acting on the N protein. The\nN protein binding pocket was represented by a set of spheres. Each\ncompound in the database was docked in a pocket comprising W43. The\nhydrophobic complementarity between ligands and receptors was calculated\nwith PLATINUM.31 Compounds with higher\ndocking scores are listed in Table S2.\n\nFluorescence assays were\nperformed in a buffer consisting of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3) and 150\nmM NaCl. One micromolar N protein was incubated either with the control\nbuffer or each compound (10 \u03bcM) at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h. Tryptophan\nfluorescence was acquired with a Jasco FP-8300 fluorescence spectrometer\n(JASCO International Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) at an excitation wavelength\nof 280 nm and an emission wavelength range of 300\u2013400 nm.\n\nThermostability assays\nwere conducted in a buffer consisting of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and\n150 mM NaCl and with a JASCO FP-8300 fluorescence spectrometer (JASCO\nInternational Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). One micromolar N protein was\nincubated either with the control buffer or each compound (10 \u03bcM)\nat 4 \u00b0C for 2 h. UV absorbance vs temperature profiles were acquired\nby ramping the temperature from 4\u201395 \u00b0C at a 1 \u00b0C\nmin\u20131 and recording the absorbance at 280 nm every\n0.5 min.\n\nVero E6 cells were infected with MERS-CoV with M.O.I = 0.1 and\ntreated with lead compounds for 48 h. Cell viability was determined\nby the neutral red uptake assay. CC50 and EC50 were determined by % cell viability. CC50 was determined\nfor cells treated with drugs only. EC50 was determined\nfor MERS-infected cells after drug treatments.\n\nSAXS\nexperiments were performed at the BL23A SAXS beamline at the TLS of\nNSRRC, using a monochromatic X-ray beam (\u03bb = 0.828 \u00c5),\nwith an integrated HPLC system of an Agilent-Bio SEC-3 300 \u00c5\ncolumn (Agilent Technologies, Inc. Santa Clara, CA). Protein samples\n(44 \u03bcM MERS-CoV N and MERS-CoV N:P3 complex prepared by incubating\nthe 44 \u03bcM native protein with 440 \u03bcM P3) were prepared\nin a buffer consisting of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) and 150 mM NaCl\non ice for 1 h. Then, a 100 \u03bcL aliquot was injected into the\ncolumn at a flow rate of 0.02 mL min\u20131. After passing\nthrough the column, the sample solution was directed\ninto a quartz capillary (2 mm dia.) for subsequent buffer and sample\nSAXS measurement at 288 K. The sample-to-detector distance of 2.5\nm used covered a scattering vector q range of 0.01\u20130.20\n\u00c5\u20131. Here, q is defined as q = (4\u03c0/\u03bb) sin \u03b8, with the\nscattering angle 2\u03b8. Thirty-six frames were collected for each\nsample elution with an X-ray frame exposure time of 30 s. Frames of\ngood data overlapping (namely, of low radiation damage effects) were\nmerged for improved data statistics and analyzed to determine initial Rg using PRIMUS (version 3.1). The P(r) distance distribution and Dmax were calculated from the experimental scattering curve\nusing GNOM (version 4.1). An ensemble optimization method (EOM) analysis\nwas performed through the EMBL Hamburg web interface.50 Modeling of the rigid body crystal structure was calculated\nand generated using CRYSOL (ATSAS Program Suite v. 2.8.2).51 The crystal structures of MERS-CoV NTD (PDB\nID: 4UD1)27 and MERS-CoV NTD:P3 (solved in this study) and\nthe CTD domain of MERS-CoV N protein (PDB ID: 6G13)23 were used as rigid bodies in EOM analysis. With the EOM analysis, 1000 models were generated\nin the beginning as a structural pool. Selected from the SAXS profiles\nof the structural pool was an ensemble of models that could fit the\nexperimental scattering curve with their linear combination. Tetrameric\nMERS-CoV NP conformations and 16-mer MERS-CoV:P3 conformations were\nselected because their ensemble generated curves fit best to the experimental\nSAXS results.\n\nVero E6 cells (ATCC\nNo: CRL-1586) were\nseeded onto culture plates with complete Dulbecco\u2019s modified\nEagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) and incubated overnight prior to infection.\nMERS-CoV (HCoV-EMC/2012) at a multiplicity of infection (M.O.I.) of\n0.1 was added to the cells and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h, followed\nby washing thrice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove the\nunattached virus. Fresh complete culture medium was then added to\nthe plates.\n\nVero E6 cells were\nseeded in 12-well plates\nand incubated overnight before the assays. Samples containing MERS-CoV\nwere serially diluted 10\u00d7 with MEM, added to the wells, and incubated\nfor 1 h with agitation every 15 min. After incubation, the inocula\nwere removed and washed with PBS. An overlay medium comprising 2\u00d7\nMEM and 1.5% (w/v) agarose (1:1) was added to the wells followed by\nincubation at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 for 3 days. The plates\nwere fixed with 10% (v/v) formalin containing 0.2% (w/v) crystal violet,\nand the plaques were counted.\n\nTotal\nRNA of infected Vero E6 cells was extracted\nwith the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the\nmanufacturer\u2019s instructions. Reverse transcription and PCR\namplification were performed with an iTaq Universal One-Step RT-qPCR\nKit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Real-time PCR was performed\nin a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster\nCity, CA). The primer pairs used to amplify the viral RNA were as\nfollows: GAPDH-F: 5\u2032-GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC-3\u2032; GAPDH-R:\n5\u2032-GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC-3\u2032;53 MERS-CoV-F: 5\u2032-CCACTACTCCCATTTCGTCAG-3\u2032; MERS-CoV-R:\n5\u2032-CAGTATGTGTAGTGCGCATATAAGCA-3\u2032.54 The MERS RNA levels were normalized to that of GAPDH and\ncompared between MERS-CoV groups at 24 h.p.i. and at 48 h.p.i.\n\nVero E6 cells were seeded\nin eight-well chamber slides and incubated overnight prior to infection\nwith MERS-CoV at M.O.I. = 0.1. The cells were fixed with 4% (v/v)\nparaformaldehyde for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C, followed by permeabilization\nin 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 10 min. Then, 7.5% (v/v) BSA was used\nas a blocking buffer for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. Anti-MERS-CoV N primary\nantibody (1:500 dilution; Sino Biological Inc., Beijing, China) was\nused to stain the virus. The cells were incubated overnight, washed\nthrice with PBS, and incubated with Alex Fluor 568 anti-rabbit secondary\nantibody (1:1000 dilution; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA)\nfor 1 h at room temperature. 4\u2032,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole\n(DAPI) was added during the PBS wash. MERS nucleocapsid expression\nwas examined under a confocal microscope (LSM-700; Carl Zeiss AG,\nOberkochen, Germany)."}
