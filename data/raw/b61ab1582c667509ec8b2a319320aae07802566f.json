{"title": "Journal Pre-proof A segregated-team model to maintain cancer care during the COVID-19 outbreak at an academic center in Singapore", "body": "The National University Cancer Institute of Singapore (NCIS) Workflow Team (Full author list in the appendix)\n\nOn 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak a pandemic 1 Table 1 ). On 7 February 2020, Singapore's DORSCON level was escalated from yellow to orange signifying community transmission, triggering heightened surveillance, border control, containment protocols, and widespread contact tracing.\n\nThe National University Cancer Institute, Singapore (NCIS) is a comprehensive academic cancer center in Singapore, managing about 7000 outpatients and 450 inpatients per month in Adult and Pediatric Haemato-Oncology. The higher risk of COVID-19 complications in cancer patients 6 required a coordinated effort to ensure business continuity while maintaining patient and staff safety. With this pandemic threatening to overwhelm healthcare systems globally, we aim here to share our experience with a segregated-team workflow in response to COVID-19, whilst maintaining the core activities of a comprehensive cancer center.\n\nSingapore's experience of the SARS epidemic lasted three months from March 2003 7 .\n\nDuring this period, 238 people were infected and 33 fatalities occurred in Singapore, five of whom were health care professionals 8 . Infection and quarantine of healthcare workers caused a widespread disruption of patient care. 44% (12 of 27) of current senior NCIS faculty were practicing during the SARS epidemic, bringing \"institutional memory\" to this outbreak. Below are specific lessons that were considered vital to the business continuity operations of a cancer center during an outbreak: a. Staff need to be protected from infection risk and burnout due to manpower shortage from quarantine, necessitating drastic workflow changes b. Limited resources and facilities for oncological care and infection control, including blood products, isolation rooms and PPE will be depleted during outbreaks, necessitating careful allocation or re-designation c. The difficulty in identifying viral infection in cancer patients poses unique challenges to screening and in-hospital transmission; requiring distinct surveillance protocols from non-cancer patients d. Workflows and policies evolve rapidly during an outbreak, requiring an adaptable framework for clinical care and therapeutic trials, that can be escalated or de-escalated quickly in coordination with the hospital/ nation.\n\nNCIS is located within the main campus of a 1000-bed public healthcare tertiary hospital, the National University Hospital (NUH), and interacts closely with other clinical departments and services in NUH. The guiding principle of the NUH response to DORSCON orange was to ensure staff and patient safety through team-segregation and careful resource allocation.\n\nThe NCIS COVID-19 business continuity plan, outlined below, was developed from this framework ( Figure 1 and Supplementary Table 1 ).\n\nCentral to the principle of business continuity is the need to minimize the loss of workforce.\n\nAll NCIS staff (clinical and non-clinical) were segregated into two teams to ensure that whole departments were not quarantined in the event of an infection. Physicians' leave was cancelled to maximize manpower resources. Physician sub-teams were further geographically confined to specific ward, outpatient and office areas to minimize exposure and cross-contamination (Supplementary Figure 1 ). Each outpatient sector had its own registration counter, triage, venipuncture service, consultation rooms, isolation rooms and lavatories, to facilitate contact tracing. In the cancer pharmacy, one team performed dispensing of outpatient prescriptions and review of chemotherapy orders, while the other team compounded chemotherapy, managed investigational studies and stored inventory (Supplementary Figure 1) . Each team at the radiotherapy treatment center comprised radiation oncologists, radiation therapists, physicists, nurses and administrative staff. A smaller team of physicians was dedicated to cover an NCIS satellite center located 8km away and cross-hospital transfer of staff was prohibited. Community cancer services (e.g. home chemotherapy and nursing) were discontinued to consolidate manpower. Face-to-face meetings were cancelled, and all department meetings, including multidisciplinary tumor boards, were conducted on a secure video-conferencing platform.\n\nReduction of patient volume was necessary to allow sustainability of a segregated-team model. In outpatients, non-resident referrals were stopped and appointments for patients on cancer surveillance were deferred. Telemedicine consults, home delivery of medications and online payment was encouraged. Volunteer groups coordinated delivery of maintenance chemotherapy to childhood leukemia patients residing outside of Singapore. For patients undergoing radiation therapy, hypo-fractionated treatments were favored, while specialized procedures such as stereotactic body radiotherapy, radiosurgery and brachytherapy were limited. In the inpatient setting, cancer surgeries were allowed to proceed as planned but all non-cancer surgeries were postponed by three months. Hospital negative-pressure isolation rooms were reassigned to the pandemic team for COVID-19 suspected and confirmed cases. Due to an anticipated shortage of these rooms hospital-wide and the nursing complexity of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) patients, low-risk suspected COVID-19 HSCT patients were kept in the HSCT unit high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA)filtered single rooms with an antechamber. Non-HSCT hematology patients who were lowrisk suspected cases for COVID-19 were admitted to neutral pressure isolation rooms, rather than negative pressure rooms, thereby preventing them from being exposed to other nosocomial infection sources. A nationwide blood product shortage resulted from social distancing practices, cancellation of mobile blood drives and stringent donor screening. For cancer patients, blood stocks were conserved for emergency surgeries, active bleeding, and semi-elective cancer surgeries. Red cell and platelet transfusion were limited per patient and lower hemoglobin thresholds were accepted for asymptomatic patients.\n\nIn the outpatient setting, thermal scanner and questionnaire screening was performed on all patients and visitors at two checkpoints within the hospital/ medical center. A febrile patient or one meeting the Ministry of Health criteria for a suspect case was escorted to a cancer center isolation room for subsequent management (Supplementary Figure 2) . Each case was discussed with the on-call coronavirus consultant. All cancer patients admitted with confirmed or high-risk suspected COVID-19 were managed in a designated ward by the Pandemic team, staffed by internal medicine physicians, with telemedicine support from hematology-oncology. This reduced the utilization of N95 masks and gowns in the cancer wards. All routine patient-care was performed using a surgical mask and meticulous handhygiene.\n\nResearch staff (trial coordinators, data/ regulatory affairs managers) were also segregated into two teams and followed similar protocols as the clinical teams. Our unit enrolls approximately 300 therapeutic trial patients each year. In line with our Institutional Central Research Office guidelines (Supplementary Figure 3) , therapeutic cancer studies continued as per protocol, provided this was not conducted in high-risk areas (i.e. isolation wards and intensive care units). Due to travel restrictions affecting overseas study subjects, options were explored to use laboratory tests in the subject's home country, telemedicine consults and courier of study medicines. Institutional ethics review boards and sponsors were forewarned about possible increases in protocol deviations during this period.\n\nTeleconferencing was utilized to continue academic activities including clinical trial monitoring, departmental meetings, and education. For example, blood cell morphology education continued via teleconferencing with the use of a digital microscope, while flowcytometry teaching used screen-capture software for live gating.\n\nDuring the SARS epidemic, failure of control over nosocomial spread drastically increased levels of fear and anxiety amongst healthcare workers. Since then, all health-care institutions conducted compulsory PPE training, N95 mask-fitting, and yearly hand hygiene exercises for staff, in preparation for future outbreaks. Clear communication was also recognized to be key to minimizing uncertainty among staff. From the outset of the COVID-19 outbreak, senior hospital management gave daily email updates on the status of cases nationwide, modifications to workflow and suspect case definition. NCIS staff were issued personal thermometers for twice-daily temperature recording. The threshold for COVID-19 testing in healthcare workers was low, and staff with respiratory symptoms or fever were given at least five days of medical leave. Crucially, staff morale was expected to be affected by the workload of team-segregation, cancellation of leave, and enforced social distancing.\n\nStrategies to boost morale were therefore considered vital; and included sharing of appreciation messages, provision of refreshments, as well as the setup of a group-chat to share anecdotes, information and banter.\n\nOver a one-month period during team segregation (Table 1) , the average monthly outpatient clinic load dropped by 20%, mostly due to deferment of non-urgent visits. The utilization rate of chemotherapy chairs, average waiting time for new consults and to start treatment were similar. The total number of admissions decreased by 30%. A total of 70 COVID-19 test kits were used; 74% (52/70) in the outpatient and 26% (18/70) in the inpatient setting. 34 patients were admitted due to suspected SARS-CoV-2 during this period, with only one confirmed case that required mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit. Clinical trial recruitment was unaffected (Table 1) .\n\nSeveral factors unique to Singapore's situation facilitated the NCIS approach; its small size, a well-structured public health system and exceptional contact tracing. Public hospitals in Singapore are integrated with the national DORSCON system, providing clarity on triggers for change to workflow. Strong leadership and rapid communication ensured quick implementation of protocols and changes. However, the long-term feasibility of these workflows is unknown. The impact of COVID-19 on treatment and outcomes of patients with cancer, patients' perspectives, the psycho-emotional impact on healthcare workers, and economic repercussions are important areas of future research.\n\nWhile the overall principles are similar to those reported by colleagues in the US 9 and United Kingdom 10 , the concept of center-wide team segregation is central to our approach and was guided by our experience from the 2003 SARS epidemic. In the last six weeks we have had an opportunity to stress-test this model. We show that despite COVID-19 community transmission, the segregated team model allowed the continuation of cancer care and clinical trials, and may be replicable in other similar centers globally. While the exact workflow will be center-specific, we hope that the principles of the segregated team approach described here may provide a modifiable framework for local strategy planners in cancer centers at high risk for COVID-19 transmission.
