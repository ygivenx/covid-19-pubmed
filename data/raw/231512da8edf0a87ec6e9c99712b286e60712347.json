{"title": "Identification of antiviral drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2 from FDA-approved drugs", "body": "COVID-19 is an emerging infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 1 .\n\nAlthough the case fatality rate due to this viral infection varies from 1 to 12% 2 , the transmission rate is relatively high 3 and recently, the WHO declared COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic.\n\nCurrently, there is no vaccines or therapeutics available and the patients with COVID-19 are being treated with supportive care.\n\nDrug repositioning could be an effective strategy to respond immediately to emerging infectious diseases since the new drug development usually takes more than 10 years 4 . FDA-approved drugs provide safe alternatives only in the case where at least modest antiviral activity can be achieved. Accordingly, several drugs are being tested in numerous clinical trials 5 including remdesivir, lopinavir, and chloroquine 6 .\n\nIn this study, we screened a panel of FDA-approved drugs to identify antiviral drug candidates for the treatment of COVID-19 and suggest the identified drug candidates may be considered for therapeutic development.\n\nWe screened approximately 3,000 FDA-and IND-approved drug library against SARS-CoV to identify antiviral drug candidates (manuscript in preparation). Since the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar (79.5% sequence identity) 1 , the drugs which show antiviral activity against SARS-CoV are expected to show similar extent of antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2.\n\nA total of 35 drugs were selected from the earlier SARS-CoV screening results. In addition, 13 drugs were included based on recommendations from infectious diseases specialists (Table 1) .\n\nFor screening experiments, Vero cells were used and each drug was added to the cells prior to the virus infection. At 24 h after the infection, the infected cells were scored by immunofluorescence analysis with an antibody specific for the viral N protein of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nThe confocal microscope images of both viral N protein and cell nuclei were analyzed using our in-house Image Mining (IM) software and the dose-response curve (DRC) for each drug was generated ( Figure 1 ). Chloroquine, lopinavir, and remdesivir were used as reference drugs with IC 50 values of 9.12, 7.28, and 11.41 \u00b5M, respectively ( Figure 1A ). Among the 48 drugs that were evaluated in our study, 24 drugs showed potential antiviral activities against SARS-CoV-2 with IC 50 values in between 0.1 and 10 \u00b5M; Tilorone, Cyclosporine, Loperamide, Mefloquine, Amodiaquine, Proscillaridin, Digitoxin, Digoxin, Hexachlorophene, Hydroxyprogesterone caproate, Salinomycin, Ouabain, Cepharanthine, Ciclesonide, Oxyclozanide, Anidulafungin, Gilteritinib, Berbamine, Tetrandrine, Abemaciclib, Ivacaftor, Bazedoxifene, Niclosamide, and Eltrombopag.\n\nAmong these 24 drugs, two FDA-approved drugs drew our attention. First, niclosamide, an antihelminthic drug, exhibited very potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 (IC 50 = 0.28 \u00b5M). Not surprisingly, its broad-spectrum antiviral effect has been well documented in the Second, ciclesonide is another interesting drug candidate for further development although its antiviral potency was much lower (IC 50 = 4.33 \u00b5M) than niclosamide. It is an inhaled corticosteroid used to treat asthma and allergic rhinitis 11 . A recent report by Matsuyama et al.\n\ncorroborated our finding of ciclesonide as a potential antiviral drug against SARS-CoV-2 12 . A treatment report of three patients who were infected by SARS-CoV-2 in Japan (https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20200303_20/) warrants further clinical investigation of this drug in patients with COVID-19. Intriguingly, an underlying mechanism for the suppression of viral infection by ciclesonide has been revealed by the isolation of a drug-resistant mutant 12 . The isolation of the drug-resistant mutant indicated that NSP15, a viral riboendonuclease, is the molecular target of ciclesonide. Together, it is not unreasonable to consider that ciclesonide exhibits a direct-acting antiviral activity in addition to its intrinsic antiinflammatory function. In the future, siRNA targeting the hormone receptor will allow to assess the extent of direct-acting antiviral activity. With its proven anti-inflammatory activity, author/funder.

In particular, the effect of favipiravir and atazanavir was compared to those of the reference drugs (chloroquine, lopinavir, remdesivir) because favipiravir is considered as a drug candidate for clinical trials and atazanavir was recently predicted as the most potent antiviral drug by AI-inference modeling 13 . However, in the current work, we did not observe any antiviral activity of either favipiravir or atazanavir.\n\nIn summary, we selected and screened 48 FDA-approved drugs based on our SARS-CoV screening and our screening campaign revealed 24 potential antiviral drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2. Our findings could be further validated in an appropriate animal model, and hopefully developed through subsequent clinical trials in order to provide additional therapeutic options for patients with COVID-19.\n\nVero cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC CCL-81) and Reagents author/funder.
