{"title": "Chapter 6 Mouse Hepatitis Virus", "body": "Since the last edition of this series, the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) literature has burgeoned, but much of this work has had relatively little direct relevance to MHV as a naturally occurring pathogen in laboratory mouse populations. This chapter has therefore been a challenge, with an attempt to provide an overview of the important aspects of MHV experimental biology while emphasizing the virus as a naturally occurring mouse pathogen. Even this has been complicated, as it is impossible to generalize with this virus, due to marked differences in the biologic behavior of the myriad virus strains, plus the marked effects of a large number of host factors. MHV was initially discovered in 1949, and continues to be among the most prevalent infections in mouse populations to this day. It is now known that the MHV group is represented by numerous variants that are constantly mutating, and that these viruses can be biologically separated into respiratory (polytropic) MHVs and enterotropic MHVs, with distinctly different patterns of tissue tropism. This dichotomy is emphasized for the purpose of discussion, but biology is never absolute.\n\nAn excellent review of the early history of MHV was written by Marcello Piazza (Piazza 1969) . At that time, MHV was yet to be classified, but it fell within a group of agents with similar size, growth characteristics in cell culture, sensitivity to ether and other chemicals, antigenic cross-reactivity (serum neutralization and complement fixation), and pathogenic characteristics, including the ability to produce encephalitis and/or hepatitis when inoculated intracerebrally or intraperitoneally into mice. Not all isolates produced encephalitis, and there was growing recognition of other viruses, such as reoviruses, that also caused hepatoencephalitis when inoculated into mice. Thus, the appellation \"mouse hepatitis virus\" was born. At that time, enterotropic MHVs were not known to belong to the MHV group.\n\nThe first MHV to be discovered was named \"JHM\" after J. Howard Mueller at Harvard University. The virus caused encephalitis and hepatitis . The discovery was made during investigation of diarrheal disease in infant mice. Viral diarrhea was a recognized entity in mice during these early years, and multiple syndromes and etiologies were being identified. Among the enteric diseases that were recognized were epizootic diarrhea of infant mice (EDIM) and lethal intestinal virus of infant mice (LIVIM), with distinctly different patterns of disease (Kraft 1966) . A number of early MHV isolates were discovered and studied in mice that were co-infected with LIVIM, but for many years LIVIM was considered to be a separate entity from MHV. LIVIM did not produce hepatitis or encephalitis, did not grow in MHV-susceptible cells in vitro, and produced a distinctive enteritis in young mice that was not observed with known MHV isolates (Biggers et al. 1964) . It was three decades after the first report of MHV-JHM in 1949 before it was recognized that the enteritis caused by LIVIMlike agents was due to enterotropic MHVs. It is now known that enterotropic MHVs belong to the MHV group (and may actually be the most common type of MHV), but they have distinct enterotropic characteristics that differentiate them from the respiratory (polytropic) MHV strains (Barthold et al. 1982; Broderson et al. 1976; Carthew 1977; Hierholzer et al. 1979; Ishida and Fujiwara 1979; Ishida, Taguchi, et al. 1978; Sugiyama and Amano 1980) .\n\nMany of the early MHV isolations were made as a result of contamination of biological materials (serum, tissue, ascites tumors, leukemia virus stocks and tumor lines, cell lines, etc.), which correlated with their polytropic biologic behavior. Their stated tropisms frequently were the result of the investigators' research interests (e.g., hepatotropism, neurotropism), and many have therefore been subjected to selective passage that favors a particular tissue tropism. The history of a few of the important prototype strains, which have undergone extensive passage in the laboratory, follows. All MHV isolates are related genetically and antigenically, but isolates can be differentiated by genetic sequencing, cross-serum neutralization, or with monoclonal antibodies. Genetic and antigenic relationships are not predictive of biologic behavior (tissue tropism, virulence, etc.). For example, MHV-JHM and MHV-S are relatively divergent genetically and antigenically, yet produce similar patterns of disease, and MHV-S and MHV-S/CDC are very closely related, but produce different patterns of disease (Barthold and Smith 1984; Hierholzer et al. 1979; Lai et al. 1983) .\n\nEarly isolates included MHV-JHM (also known as MHV-4, in spite of it being the first isolate), -1, -2 (-Pr), -3, -A59, EHF-120, -H747, -S,-Braunsteiner and Friend,-Balb C, -SR1,-SR2, -SR3, and -SR4, among others (Piazza 1969) . Some of these isolates have been maintained as \"prototype\" MHV strains for experimental and diagnostic purposes. A brief history of several of these prototype strains of MHV is provided, not only to set a foundation for where commonly studied strains of MHV originated but also to underscore their discovery as agents that not only caused disease in mice but also disrupted research. disease, the investigators reasoned that a second agent, possibly a virus, was responsible. Liver homogenates were filtered, and material caused hepatic disease after the fourth passage. Subsequently, the virus stock was shown to be contaminated with Eperythrozoon coccoides and the combination caused fatal hepatitis, whereas the virus alone caused only mild hepatitis (Gledhill 1956; Gledhill and Andrewes 1951) . MHV-1 has not been extensively studied, but is often included in comparative genetic and antigenic studies among MHV strains. 9 MHV-2 (MHV-Pr) was isolated from Princeton (PRI) mice during the course of leukemia studies (Nelson 1952a, b) . It was noted that the weanling mice were not becoming leukemic and that some mice died during the 12th passage of the \"leukemic\" cells. Those mice had severe hepatitis, and passage of liver material in PRI mice resulted in the same syndrome noted in the index mice. This virus contributed to seminal work on host genetic resistance and susceptibility by Fred Bang. The in vivo susceptibility of different strains of mice was mirrored by the response of peritoneal or hepatic macrophage cultures derived from mice that were susceptible (PRI), resistant (C3H), or moderately susceptible (BSVS) (Bang and Warwick 1960) . MHV-2 continues to be of interest as an MHV strain that is \"hepatotropic\" and nonfusigenic (at least in most stocks of MHV-2), and therefore does not induce the hallmark syncytia seen with other MHV strains during infection in vitro or in vivo (Keck, Soe, et al. 1988 ). 9 MHV-3 was found during the course of efforts to transmit human viral hepatitis with human patient serum inoculated into Swiss Webster (then called VS) mice. Inoculated mice were subsequently administered a hypertonic solution of glucose. One mouse died and its liver was severely damaged. Serial passages of infectious material caused severe hepatitis in weanling mice. When additional mice were inoculated with the human material, they did not show clinical signs of hepatitis, so the authors concluded that the responsible agent was of mouse origin (Dick et al. 1956 ). MHV-3 has been extensively studied as a virulent \"hepatotropic\" MHV strain. 9 MHV-A59 was discovered during the serial passage of the Moloney leukemia agent in BALB/c mice (Manaker et al. 1961) . After 30 passages of pooled organ homogenates, the mice were hunched with ruffled hair coats. After two additional passages, livers of the mice were pale with white foci. MHV-A59 was isolated from the spleens and livers of these mice. MHV-A59 grows robustly in culture, has been studied as a prototype virus for virus receptor, hepatitis, and encephalitis research, and is a common strain for use as an antigen for serodiagnostics. 9 MHV-S was isolated from newborn CD-1 Swiss mice that were cesarean derived and maintained within a strict barrier. Mice were noted to develop high mortality after contact with conventional mice of several stocks. Their livers were affected, and a pool of viscera, excluding intestine, yielded MHV-S. The virus was shown to be highly contagious and present in the feces of various stocks of mice . Weanling mice inoculated intraperitoneally with feces from these mice became paralyzed. Intraperitoneal or intracerebral inoculation of CD-1 mice with the virus resulted in hepatitis and encephalitis, but the virus did not kill mice after serial passage in cultured cells. Researchers reasoned that either the virus that was in feces may have become less virulent after multiple passages or the mortality in CD-1 mice was caused by a contaminating enteric agent, LIVIM (Kraft 1962) , which did not replicate in cultured cells. MHV-S is now known as a relatively nonpathogenic MHV strain and not highly contagious. Thus, its early reported characteristics as a highly contagious enteric agent is probably attributable to co-infection with LIVIM, or perhaps artificial selection of a hepatotropic variant (MHV-S) that is a derivative of LIVIM.\n\nIn addition to the above prototype MHV strains, a number of enterotropic MHV strains have been maintained and studied. The agent of LIVIM has never been isolated, but the realization that LIVIM was related to MHV occurred with the isolation of MHV-S/CDC. As the name implies, MHV-S/CDC was found to be serologically closely related to MHV-S. It was isolated from pooled intestinal homogenates during an outbreak of lethal enteritis in suckling mice manifesting features resembling those described for LIVIM. Virus propagated in cultured NCTC 1469 cells produced enteric disease commensurate with lesions that had been previously described for LIVIM in suckling mice (Broderson et al. 1976; Hierholzer et al. 1979) . The realization that LIVIM was related to MHV occurred simultaneously in another laboratory (Carthew 1977) . Although LIVIM is not available for analysis, it was clearly an enterotropic MHV, based upon descriptions of the pathology in infant mice (Biggers et al. 1964; Kraft 1962 Kraft , 1966 . Subsequent isolations of enterotropic MHV soon followed, including MHV-D (Ishida and Fujiwara 1979; Ishida, Taguchi, et al. 1978) , MHV-DVIM (diarrhea virus of infant mice) (Sugiyama and Amano 1980) , MHV-Y (Barthold et al. 1982) , and MHV-RI (Barthold et al. 1985) , among others. Like other MHV strains, these enterotropic MHV strains vary in their genetic and antigenic relatedness to each other. In other words, like respiratory MHV strains and isolates, \"LIVIM\" is not one virus.\n\nThe two basic MHV biotypes, respiratory or enterotropic, have primary tropism for either upper respiratory mucosa (respiratory MHV strains) or intestinal epithelium (enterotropic MHV strains). Respiratory strains, which replicate in nasal epithelium, need not disseminate to other organs to be successfully transmitted to other mice. However, nasal virus titers tend to be low and, thus, direct contact is needed for transmission. Enterotropic strains, which replicate in intestinal mucosal epithelium, also need not disseminate to other organs to be transmitted to other mice. Enterotropic MHV strains tend to be excreted in very high titer in feces, regardless of the age of the host, and thus tend to be highly contagious. The differences between respiratory and enterotropic MHVs are most clearly manifested when susceptible infant mice are inoculated oronasally. Under such circumstances, respiratory MHVs disseminate to multiple organs (polytropism), whereas enterotropic MHVs tend to be restricted to intestinal mucosa (enterotropism) (Barthold and Smith 1984) . Respiratory strains, when afforded the opportunity to disseminate in susceptible hosts, have nonselective tropism for many tissues and thus are the strains that have been frequently associated with contamination of serum, tumors, cell lines, virus stocks, and other biologic material of mouse origin. MHV is extremely prevalent not only in laboratory mice but also among wild mice. Wild Mus domesticus in Australia are frequently infected, based upon serologic surveys. Similar surveys of several wild mouse populations along the East Coast of the United States (Maine to Virginia) have confirmed the ubiquity of MHV. Analysis of weaning-age, wild-trapped mice by histopathology has suggested that enterotropic MHV is present, but the biotypes of MHV among wild mice have not been otherwise characterized (Smith and Barthold, unpublished observations) . Thus, both feral and wild mice pose a high risk of introducing MHV into laboratory mouse populations.\n\nIt is emphasized that the MHV respiratory-enteric biotype dichotomy is only relative, with considerable overlap between the two groups. MHV-DVIM, for example, not only causes enteric infections but also disseminates to liver and other organs (Sugiyama and Amano 1980) , whereas MHV-Y and MHV-RI are more restricted for intestinal mucosa (Barthold and Smith 1984; Barthold et al. 1982 Barthold et al. , 1985 . Furthermore, studies with congenic B6 wild-type, B cell-deficient, and T cell-deficient mice have shown that enterotropic MHV-Y was restricted to intestine in wild-type and B cell-deficient mice, but disseminated and produced hepatitis in T cell-deficient mice . Patterns of tissue tropism in naturally infected nude mice suggest that strictly enterotropic, enterotropic-polytropic (disseminated), and non-enterotropic-polytropic patterns of disease are apparent in nude mouse sentinels exposed to different enzootically infected mouse colonies ). These observations lead to conjecture about \"which came first, the chicken or the egg\"m enterotropic or respiratory MHV?\n\nDuration of MHV infection in mice is dependent upon MHV strain, route of inoculation, and host factors, including age, immunocompetence, passive immunity, genetic strain, and genetic alterations. Although persistent infection of the central nervous system can be induced experimentally in immunocompetent mice, especially following intracerebral inoculation, this is not likely to have practical significance under natural conditions. Experimental studies, using both respiratory and enterotropic MHV, have shown that genetically susceptible BALB/c and resistant CD-1 immunocompetent mice effectively recovered from infection when inoculated oronasally with MHV-JHM, -1, or-S by 1 month. Treatment with hydrocortisone or cyclophosphamide while mice were still infected exacerbated infection, but had no effect after recovery and did not reactivate virus . Subsequent studies confirmed these findings, using intranasal MHV-JHM inoculation of genetically susceptible BALB/c and resistant SJL mice at 1, 3, 6, or 12 weeks of age. Virus titers peaked in various organs at 3-5 days after inoculation, and were subsequently cleared in SJL mice by day 10, regardless of age at inoculation. In contrast, in surviving BALB mice inoculated at 6 weeks of age, virus was cleared from most organs by 30 days and by day 60 in brain. Thus, age and genotype were significant factors, but both strains of mice completely recovered from infection if they survived the acute disease . Similar studies have been performed with enterotropic MHV, using BALB/c and SJL mice inoculated oronasally at 1, 3, or 12 weeks of age with MHV-Y. Most mice recovered by day 20, but low titers of virus were detectable in a few mice of all ages and both genotypes at day 30 (Barthold et al. 1993) .\n\nThe above studies suggest that most mice recover from MHV infection, but duration of infection may vary and last for weeks, even under experimental conditions. The practical significance of these findings relates to how long a mouse can transmit infectious virus. Studies of naturally infected transgenic, null mutant, and wild-type mice have indicated that soiled bedding from various types of MHV seropositive mice could transmit virus for at least 10 weeks. Most of the mice with persistent viral excretion were genetically altered mice, but they were phenotypically normal, most were heterozygous, and they were genetically engineered in loci that did not have expected immune effects (Smith et al. 2002) . Transgenic mice with altered T cell function have been shown to transmit MHV for 2 years (Rehg et al. 2001) , and transmission of apparently enterotropic MHV by B6-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) null mutant mice to sentinels was shown to last over 5 months (Pullium et al. 2003) . In a controlled study that utilized BALB/c and B6 mice and B6 congenic B-cell (Igh6 null mutant) and T-cell (Tcr beta/delta null mutant) immunodeficient mice infected oronasally with enterotropic MHV-Y, virus was shown to be transmissible to sentinel mice exposed directly to infected mice or to soiled bedding. B6 wild-type mice transmitted virus for 2 weeks, BALB mice for 4 weeks, T cell-deficient B6 mice for at least 4 weeks (they were euthanized at that interval due to illness), and B cell-deficient B6 mice for over 3 months . A number of studies have shown that interferon-q, null mutant mice become chronically infected with MHV (Compton et al. 2003; France et al. 1999; Kyuwa et al. 2002; Schijns et al. 1996) . Considering the growing number of genetically altered mice and the already known unpredictability of virus shedding from such mice with or without known immune defects that are naturally infected with MHV (Pullium et al. 2003; Rehg et al. 2001; Smith et al. 2002) , it is likely that a growing number of factors will be documented that influence MHV persistence.\n\nIn utero transmission of MHV from infected dams to fetuses has been demonstrated experimentally, but it is unlikely to occur under natural conditions in immunocompetent mice for a number of reasons, including the relatively short duration of infection during the breeding life of the dam and the need for coinciding viremic infection with pregnancy, which requires a nonimmune susceptible host and a virulent strain of polytropic virus. Transplacental infection has been demonstrated experimentally following intravenous inoculation of ICR dams with MHV-JHM during all three trimesters of pregnancy (Katami et al. 1978) . Similar studies have shown transplacental transmission during all three trimesters of pregnancy in BALB/c dams, but not CD-1 dams, inoculated intranasally with MHV-JHM. Less virulent MHV-S could also be transmitted in utero in BALB/c mice, but not as efficiently. Viral antigen was found throughout the placenta, and particularly at the maternal-fetal junction. In contrast, enterotropic MHV-Y, which does not disseminate hematogenously, did not infect BALB/c or CD-1 fetuses in utero. Furthermore, these studies demonstrated that the physiologic state of pregnancy favored higher titers of MHV-JHM in livers of the pregnant dams (Barthold et al. 1988 ). On the other hand, in utero transmission was not found in NMRI mice inoculated intraperitoneally with MHV-3, even among mice treated with prednisolone (Galanti et al. 1969; Piccinino et al. 1966) . Even in the absence of infection of embryos, MHV infection during pregnancy has been shown to affect embryo genotype in heterozygous mice. MHV-infected mice produced more MHCheterozyous embryos than uninfected mice, suggesting selective promotion of certain MHC haplotypes during fertilization (Rulicke et al. 1998) .\n\nThe significance of vertical transmission lies not so much in the risk to the embryo, which if infected would likely die, but more in the risk of introducing MHV through contaminated embryos or germplasm into a virus-free colony during cesarean or embryo transfer rederivation. The zona pellucida affords significant protection to mouse embryos against MHV infection. Zona-intact embryos incubated with MHV for 48 hours as 2-cell embryos or for 1.5 hours as blastocysts were shown to resist infection, but embryos devoid of the zona pellucida were susceptible to infection. MHV was transmitted to foster dams when uninfected embryos were transferred in medium that was flushed from uterine horns of infected donor dams (Carthew et al. 1985) . The danger of this happening is significantly increased when donor dams are immunodeficient and have disseminated infections with respiratory (polytropic) MHV.\n\nIn a recent study, disseminated MHV infection was detected in multiple organs of nude mice, including both male and female reproductive organs. Transplantation of ovaries from infected donors transmitted MHV to recipient immunocompetent and immunodeficient mice, but transmission was not observed with sperm from infected testes when used for in vitro fertilization (Scavizzi and Raspa 2004) . Embryo transfer and in vitro fertilization with sperm from donors derived from MHV enzootically infected colonies (undefined virus or infection status of donors) have been used successfully for rederivation (Suzuki et al. 1996) .\n\nEmbryonic stem cells also pose a risk of MHV contamination and transmission to recipient dams through blastocyst injection. MHV-A59 and -2 have been shown to replicate in a number of murine embryonic cell lines derived from several genetic backgrounds, and both MHV types did so with no or minimal cytopathic effect (Kyuwa 1997) . Notably, in contrast to a persistent carrier state in which only a few cells are infected, studies have shown that all of the ES cells developed a steadystate infection with MHV-2, in which A3-1 cells produced virus while also proliferating and differentiating into embryoid bodies (Okumura et al. 1996) . These experimental studies underscore the importance of periodic testing of ES cell lines for adventitious pathogens.\n\nLiquid nitrogen storage of ES cells, embryos, and other germplasm can also potentially be a means of cross-contamination with MHV. Liquid nitrogen is not sterile, it can penetrate into cryotubes containing mouse embryos, and accidental transmission of other viruses under such circumstances has been documented. Inadvertent introduction of MHV-infected material into liquid nitrogen tanks is therefore quite possible. A recent study stored mouse embryos and MHV-NuU tubes in the same tanks for 6 or 12 months, with no evidence of MHV contamination of embryos (Kyuwa et al. 2003) . A false sense of security could be obtained from such results, as the study utilized 2-cell embryos, which are protected by their zona pellucida, and enterotropic MHV-NuU, which is likely to have limited cell tropism.\n\nIt is important to emphasize that the most likely source of MHV in mouse colonies is mice (wild, feral, or captive) or mouse products (serum, tumor lines, etc.). Mice are not likely to be natural hosts for other coronaviruses. Nevertheless, the cross-reactive nature of coronavirus antibody in humans, rats, mice, and other species that occurs following natural infection with their respective coronaviruses within Group II (see Section II, A) has led to conjecture regarding the host species specificity of MHV. This has been reinforced by observations that two-way cross-species infections with coronaviruses can occur naturally and experimentally among dogs, cats, and pigs (Reynolds and Gawes 1979; Woods et al. 1981) . Humans have been shown to naturally develop serum neutralizing antibody to MHV, which is generally considered to be virus strain-specific . Intranasal inoculation of infant mice with MHV-S, MHV-Y, rat sialodacryoadenitis virus, human coronavirus OC43, and bovine coronavirus (comembers of Group II) all produced encephalitis in intranasally inoculated infant mice. Transmission of virus by direct contact to naive infant mice, however, occurred only with MHV and rat coronavirus, not with human or bovine coronaviruses. Furthermore, only mice infected by inoculation or contact with MHV developed MHVrelated patterns of infection ). Thus, even highly susceptible infant mice do not easily favor infection with non-mouse coronaviruses.\n\nWhen MHV was initially being characterized, it was experimentally inoculated intracerebrally into a wide variety of species. Syrian hamsters, rats, cotton rats, but not guinea pigs or rabbits, were found to be susceptible to MHV-JHM inoculation (Bailey et al. 1949; Cheever et al. 1949) . MHV-JHM infection induced demyelinating encephalitis following intracerebral inoculation of African Green Monkeys and Owl Monkeys, and after intranasal and intravenous inoculation of Owl Monkeys (Cabirac et al. 1994; Kersting and Pette 1956; Murray et al. 1992) . Rats have been used as a model system to investigate pathogenesis of demyelinating encephalitis following intracerebral inoculation with MHV-JHM, -3, and-A59 (Sorensen et al. 1982; Wege et al. 1984) . Suckling rats can be asymptomatically infected with MHV-S following intranasal inoculation, with virus replication in nasal mucosa (Taguchi et al. 1979a ).\n\nThe Coronavirus genus, which includes MHV, is within the family Coronaviridae. Members of this family are large enveloped viruses with plus-stranded (positive sense) RNA genomes. The family Coronaviridae contains Coronavirus and Torovirus genera, and is part of the order Nidovirales, which includes two other families, Arteriviridae and Roniviridae, but this classification is still in flux. Nidoviruses share similar replication strategies, but constituent families are significantly divergent, based upon gene sequences (Gonzalez et al. 2003) . Members of the genus Coronavirus have the largest genomes of all of the RNA viruses. Three distinct groups of coronaviruses have been identified, each having members that share nucleotide sequence similarity and antigenic interrelationships. Antigenic Group I includes human coronavirus 229E, transmissible gastroenteritis virus of pigs, porcine respiratory coronavirus, canine coronavirus, feline enteric coronavirus, feline infectious peritonitis virus, and rabbit coronavirus. Group II includes MHV, rat coronavirus, human coronavirus OC43, porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus, bovine coronavirus, rabbit enteric coronavirus, and turkey coronavirus. Group III includes infectious bronchitis virus of chickens (Lai and Holmes 2001) .\n\nA newly recognized human coronavirus NL63 is a member of Group I (van der Hoek et al. 2004 ). There are many other coronaviruses that infect a wide variety of species but have been insufficiently characterized for inclusion within these antigenic groups. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, for example, is genetically distinct from other known coronaviruses, and is distantly related to Group II and, to a certain extent, Group III coronaviruses. It may represent an entirely new group of coronaviruses that is enzootic in wild animal species in China (Poon et al. 2004) .\n\nFurthermore, as exemplified by MHV, each of these named coronaviruses actually represents a diverse group of viruses that infect a particular host species. Coronaviruses are often defined by their tissue tropism, but this varies among isolates from a single host species. However, there are common patterns of tissue tropism among all coronaviruses that, like MHV, have primary tropism for either the respiratory tract or the intestine and variable secondary tissue tropism. Enteric coronaviruses of other species, like enterotropic MHV, are associated with neonatal diarrhea in their respective hosts.\n\nCoronaviruses were named because of their virion morphology, with their characteristic corona of spikes (peplomers) protruding from the surface. With negative-contrast electron microscopy, the images of coronaviruses do not reflect the way they appear in their native state, as the peplomers tend to fall off easily. Therefore, most images of MHV are partly \"bald.\" Native virions are so heavily covered with peplomers that they may not resemble the classical images that are generally depicted in texts and publications . The genome encodes nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N), which forms tubular nucleocapsid strands that bind to viral RNA and lie within the lipoprotein envelope that is formed by budding from intracellular membranes (Sturman and Holmes 1985; Tooze and Tooze 1985) . The envelopes contain two major viral glycoproteins: membrane (M) protein (formerly El) and spike (S) protein (formerly E2) (Sturman and Holmes 1985) . A third, envelope (E) small membrane protein (formerly sM), is involved in virus assembly (Raamsman et al. 2000; Yu et al. 1994) . Some coronaviruses, particularly members of antigenic Group II, have an additional hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) envelope protein (formefly E3). Some, but not all, strains of MHV possess HE proteins (Yokomori et al. 1991 (Yokomori et al. , 1989 . The M glycoprotein of MHV binds the membrane to the nucleocapsid within the virion (Sturman et al. 1980) . Antibody to the external domain of M can neutralize the virus, but requires the presence of complement (Collins et al. 1982) .\n\nThe S glycoprotein represents the structural protein that creates the prominent spikes on the surface of the virion that form the characteristic \"corona.\" The S glycoprotein has three structural domains: an N-terminal external domain that is subdivided into $1 and $2, a transmembrane domain, and a short C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. A region between S 1 and $2 may (but may not) contain a cluster of protease cleavage motifs. There is considerable diversity in length and sequence of S 1 glycoproteins of different MHV strains. The S 1 domain contains hypervariable regions that foster large deletions or insertions that are not essential for the structure of the spikes but contribute to antigenic variation, tissue tropism, and virulence (Banner et al. 1990; Daniel et al. 1993; Gallagher et al. 1990; Parker et al. 1989; Wang et al. 1992) . The S 1 glycoprotein binds to specific host cell receptors, induces neutralizing antibody, binds antibody, and elicits cell-mediated immunity. In addition, organotropism and virulence have been attributed to sequence differences in the S 1 gene (Daniel et al. 1993; Gallagher 1997; Gallagher et al. 1990; Hasony and Macnaughton 1981; Holmes et al. 1986; Luytjes et al. 1989; Oleszak et al. 1992; Phillips et al. 1999 Phillips et al. , 2002 Stauber et al. 1993; Welsh et al. 1986 ). $2 is involved in membrane fusion, and can mediate cell fusion without S1 interaction with MHV cell receptor (Krueger et al. 2000; Taguchi and Shimazaki 2000) . $2 also has hypervariable regions within its coding sequence (Wang et al. 1992) . Although the functions of S1 and $2 can be differentially defined experimentally, they act in concert for efficient infectivity and entry of the virus. MHV cell fusion is mediated through highly conserved heptad repeat 1 (HR1) and HR2 regions of the S protein that function as a class I fusion protein that shares structural and functional features with other viral fusion proteins (Xu et al. 2004) .\n\nDespite distinct differences in biologic behavior among different MHV strains, attempts to identify characteristics that differentiate respiratory MHV from enterotropic MHV have been unrewarding. Enterotropic MHV strains are morphologically and antigenically indistinguishable from other MHV strains. Furthermore, there are no distinctive characteristics in the S genes or the gene products of enterotropic MHV strains that make them unique from other MHV strains (Kunita et al. 1995) , nor are there distinctive differences in sequence of N or M genes (Homberger 1994 (Homberger , 1995 . Nevertheless, because variation in S genes and their amino acid products has been proven to influence cell tropism and biologic activity of prototype MHV strains in various ways under experimental conditions (Dalziel et al. 1986; Fleming et al. 1986; Gallagher et al. 1990; Gombold et al. 1993; Ontiveros et al. 2003; Parker et al. 1989; Wang et al. 1992; Wege et al. 1988) , it is likely that biotype is determined in some way by peplomeric structure or function.\n\nMHV genomic RNAs are 27 to 32 kilobases in size, and are capped and polyadenylated (Lai 1990; Spaan et al. 1988 ). They can function as messenger RNAs, and are infectious (Lai 1990 ). The gene order of all coronaviruses consists of polymerase (P), S, E, M, and then N, interspersed by a variable number and order of open reading frames that encode nonstructural proteins of unknown function, as well as a variably present HE protein (Lai and Holmes 2001) . The plus-strand viral genomic RNA is transcribed into subgenomic and genomic length minus-strand RNAs, which serve as templates for synthesis of plus-strand viral mRNAs and genomic RNA. There are five to eight subgenomic mRNAs that are numbered in order of decreasing size and form a nested set with a common 3' end. Although most of the mRNAs contain two or more open reading frames, only the open reading frame at the 5' end is translated. All subgenomic mRNAs possess a common leader sequence at their 5' ends that is identical to the leader sequence at the 5' end of the genomic RNA (Lai 1990; Lai and Holmes 2001; Sturman and Holmes 1983) . Viral replication takes place on late endosomal membranes within the cytoplasm of infected cells (van der Meer et al. 1999) , with a latent period of only a few hours.\n\nBecause MHV is an RNA virus, it is naturally prone to a high frequency of mutation. This is due to the high error frequency of RNA polymerases, but is accentuated by the size of the MHV genome. Thus, it has been calculated that MHV genomic RNA probably accumulates several point mutations with each round of replication. Plaque-purified MHV is therefore actually a quasispecies of heterogeneous viruses. These constantly arising variations impact upon antigenicity, pathogenicity, and virulence (Lai and Holmes 2001) . The S gene, in particular, possesses hypermutable regions, resulting in mutants that differ significantly in biologic behavior (Dalziel et al. 1986; DasSarma et al. 2000; Fleming et al. 1986; Gallagher et al. 1990; Gombold et al. 1993; Ontiveros et al. 2003; Parker et al. 1989; Wang et al. 1992; Wege et al. 1988 ). This can be followed in vitro, but there is remarkably high incidence of deletion mutations in the S gene among field isolates of MHV (Banner et al. 1990; Gallagher et al. 1990; Parker et al. 1989) . Therefore, there are significant genetic and antigenic differences among stocks of a single prototype MHV strain (Lai et al. 1983 ).\n\nIn addition to mutation, the MHV genome is prone to a high frequency of RNA recombination, and this is related to the segmented subgenomic RNAs that are a feature of coronaviral replication. This is believed to be due to discontinuous transcription and polymerase jumping (Lai 1992) . The recombination frequency for the entire RNA genome has been calculated to approach 25% (Baric et al. 1990 ). Recombination among different MHV strains has been documented in cells that have been co-infected in vitro (Keck et al. 1987; Keck, Soe, et al. 1988; Lai et al. 1985; Makino et al. 1986 ), but has also been readily documented in experimental MHV infections in mice (Keck, Matsushima, et al. 1988) . The variation in the number and order of nonstructural genes within coronavirus genomes suggests that some of these genes have been usurped from cellular mRNAs through nonhomologous recombination with coronavirus genomes (Lai and Holmes 2001) . This is believed to be the explanation for the ancient acquisition of the HE gene among many Group II coronaviruses, which has sequence similarity to the influenza virus C hemagglutinin gene (Luytjes et al. 1988) . Recombination probably represents the major means by which coronaviruses evolve into variants with novel host species specificity.\n\nSeveral different molecules can function as MHV receptors (Beauchemin et al. 1999; Chen et al. 1995; Dveksler et al. 1991; Nedellec et al. 1994; Williams et al. 1991) , among which carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1, or CEACAM1, is the most prevalent (Dveksler et al. 1993) . CEACAM1 is an isoform of the mouse biliary glycoprotein 1 gene and has therefore also been referred to as Bgp 1 or BgpA (as well as MHVR1, mmCGM1, C-CAM, and CD66a). CEACAM belongs to the Ig superfamily, and possesses four Ig-like loops, a transmembrane region, and a short intracytoplasmic domain. The N-terminal region of MHV S 1 binds to the N-terminal Ig-like domain of CEACAM1 (Dveksler et al. 1993) , resulting in conformational change in $2 that exposes a domain that initiates fusion with the host cell membrane (Gallagher and Buchmeier 2001) .\n\nGenetic resistance and susceptibility to MHV-A59 infection is related to allelic variation of CEACAM1 in mice. The functional consequences of these allelic differences have been shown with L2, Sac-, 17CL-1, J774A-1, JLSV9, and primary BALB peritoneal macrophages, all of which are susceptible to MHV-A59 infection and all of which express CEACAMla, whereas SJL peritoneal macrophages, hamster B HK-21 cells, and cell lines from cats, dogs, monkeys, and humans were not susceptible and did not express CEACAMla (Compton et al. 1992) .\n\nA monoclonal antibody against CEACAMla significantly reduced virus titers and clinical disease in MHV-A59 infected infant mice, but did not prevent infection (Smith, Cardellichio, et al. 1991) . A, C3H, B6, SWR, DBA/2, AKR, CBA, and BALB/c mice, and probably most other inbred strains, are homozygous for the CEACAMla allele (MHVR1, mmCGM1), whereas CEACAMlb (MHVR2, mmCGm2) is expressed in tissues of SJL mice, and both CEACAM1 alleles are expressed in tissues of outbred Swiss mice Chen et al. 1995; Compton 1994; Dveksler et al. 1993; Knobler et al. 1981; Ohtsuka and Taguchi 1997; Smith et al. 1984; Yokomori and Lai 1992a) .\n\nDifferences in genetic susceptibility have been attributed to the fact that CEACAM 1 a has a receptor binding efficiency that is 300-500 times higher, with 10-30 times higher receptor functionality, compared to CEACAMlb (Ohtsuka et al. 1998 (Ohtsuka et al. , 1996 Rao et al. 1997) . Other members of the CEA family, as well as human CEA-related glycoproteins, can also serve as alternate MHV receptors, including CEACAM2 (Chen et al. , 1995 Dveksler et al. 1993; Nedellec et al. 1994; Lai 1994, 1992a) . CEACAM2 also has Ig domains, but there is considerable divergence in amino acid sequences of the N-terminus of the protein compared to CEACAM1. CEACAM2 is expressed in a variety of tissues of BALB/c, SJL, C3H, and B6 mice, and has been shown to function as an alternate receptor for several strains of MHV when transfected into hamster BHK cells (Nedellec et al. 1994 ). In addition, there appear to be additional host-dependent stages for entry of MHV into cells that involve mechanisms other than CEACAM Koolen et al. 1983; Yokomori et al. 1993) , thereby helping to explain the range of susceptibility among different mouse strains that can be shown at the cellular level.\n\nMHV interactions with CEACAMs as specific receptors provide interesting insight into virus-host interactions at the molecular level, but MHV does not necessarily respect such clear explanations. Many MHV strains are neurotropic and nonselectively and readily infect neurons, glia, ependyma, meninges, and vessels within the brain, yet there is a relative paucity of CEACAM molecules in the central nervous system, with the exception of low-level expression on microglia (Chen et al. 1995; Ramakrishna et al. 2004; Yokomori and Lai 1992a) . In spite of this, neurons appear to be a key target and determinant of disease (Knobler et al. 1981) . A possible explanation is that neurotropic viruses such as MHV-JHM are highly fusogenic and may spread within the central nervous system by S proteinmediated cell-to-cell fusion, rather than through specific cell receptors (Gallagher et al. 1992) . Alternatively, non-CEACAM1 CEA-type receptors are also expressed in brain, such as a pregnancy-specific glycoprotein (PSG). When this receptor was expressed in COS-7 cells, which normally lack the MHV receptor, they were rendered susceptible to MHV-A59, -2, and-3, but, unexpectedly, not to neurotropic MHV-JHM (Chen et al. 1995) .\n\nSJL mice are reported to be remarkably resistant to infection with MHV-A59 and MHV-JHM because of their absence of CEACAMla. In spite of this, the SJL CEACAMlb receptor is functional when expressed at high levels in hamster or human cells (Dveksler et al. 1991; Yokomori and Lai 1992b) . Furthermore, SJL-derived cell lines have been shown to be susceptible to MHV-A59, but not MHV-JHM, and SJL mice express equivalent amounts of CEACAMlb compared to expression of CEACAM1 a by B6 mice in brains and livers (Yokomori and Lai 1992b) . When adult SJL mice were inoculated intracerebrally with MHV-JHM, virus titers and mortality were significantly lower than those in BALB/c mice (Ohtsuka and Taguchi 1997) . SJL mice, when inoculated oronasally with MHV-JHM at 3, 6, or 12 weeks of age, do not support disseminated infection compared to BALB/c mice, which do . In contrast, SJL mice support equal levels of virus replication in intestinal tissue compared to BALB/c mice when infected with enterotropic MHV-Y at 1, 3, or 12 weeks of age (Barthold et al. 1993) . Studies with enterotropic strains MHV-Y and -RI suggest that enterotropic MHV strains can use the same or different receptors for infection, and that receptors are probably not the primary determinant of the limited tissue distribution of enterotropic MHV strains (Compton 1994 (Compton , 1998 . Finally, the role of receptors in MHV infection and pathogenesis may vary by tissue type. Intranasal inoculation of MHV-JHM results in replication of virus in nasal tissue of 1-, 3-, 6-, or 12-week-old SJL mice, despite their resistance to disseminated infection to other tissues . Collectively, these observations emphasize that CEACAM or other known receptor expression is not the sole determinant of MHV strain-related virulence, virus organotropism, or mouse genetic susceptibility.\n\nThe host range of coronaviruses is believed to be determined largely by the interaction of the virion S protein with host cell receptors. Specific modification of the S protein of MHV-A59 can extend the host range of this virus to cells of other species (Thackray and Holmes 2004) . Establishment of persistent MHV infections in various permissive cell lines can also result in emergence of host range variants that interface with phylogenetic orthologs of their normal receptor (Baric et al. 1999 (Baric et al. , 1997 Schickli et al. 1997) . This is likely mediated by selection for host cells that resist virus infection by down-regulating the expression of CEACAM 1 (Chen and Baric 1996; Sawicki et al. 1995) . In addition, it appears that different MHV strains can utilize more than one CEA-related molecule as alternate receptors, whereas some strains are more restricted in their receptor-ligand interactions (Chen et al. , 1995 . MHV-JHM variants, despite their apparent selectivity for mouse CEACAM1, can infect a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (Koetters et al. 1999 \n\nRespiratory MHV strains initially replicate in nasal respiratory and olfactory epithelium as their primary targets. Virus replication was shown to take place in the nasal tissue of all mice experimentally infected with several prototype respiratory MHV strains (Barthold and Smith 1984) , including genetically resistant SJL mice, regardless of the age at inoculation , and mice infected with low-virulence strains of MHV (Taguchi, Goto, et al. 1979) . When respiratory MHVs of sufficient virulence infect hosts of sufficient susceptibility (infant mice, genetically susceptible mice, and immunodeficient mice), they disseminate through lymphatics to regional lymph nodes and by viremia to lungs, where they replicate in pulmonary vascular endothelium, then disseminate by secondary viremia to multiple organs, including lymphoid tissue (thymus, lymph nodes, and spleen), liver, bone marrow, brain, reproductive organs, and other tissues ; Barthold and Smith 1983 . In addition to viremic dissemination, several strains of MHV have been shown to infect the brain by direct extension along olfactory tracts. Low-virulence virus, such as MHV-S, can gain access to the brain in adult, immunocompetent mice by this route in the absence of dissemination to other organs (Barthold 1988b; Barthold et al. 1986 ). Although the intestine becomes infected with respiratory MHV strains, viral replication is largely confined to gut-associated lymphoid tissue (Peyer's patches) (Barthold and Smith 1984, 1987) . This is in marked contrast to enterotropic MHVs, which selectively infect enterocytes (Barthold et al. 1993; Barthold and Smith 1984; Barthold et al. 1982) .\n\nRespiratory MHV strains are nonselective in their tissue tropism, and are therefore \"polytropic\" when given the opportunity to disseminate in susceptible hosts. Relative organotropism of these viruses, such as neurotropism or hepatotropism, is often emphasized in the scientific literature and can be selected experimentally, but these viruses with \"selective tissue tropism\" still retain their ability to infect other organs in susceptible hosts. The polytropic behavior of these viruses explains how they were initially discovered through isolation from a myriad of cell cultures, transplantable tumors, tissue extracts, and other biological material and were likewise readily cultured in a variety of cell lines. In the authors' experience, respiratory MHV strains tend to spread inefficiently from mouse to mouse. Others (Dick et al. 1956; Rowe et al. 1963) have reported this as well, even with virulent MHV-3 by direct contact among infant mice.\n\nHost age at the time of MHV infection is a critical determinant of disease severity, regardless of MHV strain or host genotype. Neonatal mice are highly susceptible to respiratory MHV strains, and usually succumb to disseminated infections with hepatitis and/or encephalitis. Clinical disease in mice infected with these viruses is due to hepatitis and/or encephalitis, and therefore appears after several days of infection. Resistance to respiratory MHV increases at around 2 weeks of age, with significant differences in susceptibility among older mice, depending upon genotype Hirano, Takenaka, et al. 1975; Suzuki et al. 1997; Taguchi et al. 1979b) . SJL mice are highly resistant to infection with MHV-JHM and -A59, but nevertheless manifest age-related susceptibility. Neonatal, but not older, SJL mice develop disseminated infections when inoculated intranasally with MHV-JHM . Lymphoreticular function is one major factor (but not the only factor) in age-related susceptibility, and resistance can be reversed by immunosuppression (Bang 1978; Dupuy et al. 1975; Levy-Leblond and Dupuy 1977; Taguchi et al. 1979b; Tardieu et al. 1980) . Disease susceptibility generally correlates with virus titer in various target organs following infection with respiratory MHV strains (Bang 1978; Barthold and Smith 1987; Hirano, Takenaka, et al. 1975; Suzuki et al. 1997; Taguchi et al. 1979b ). An exception is the severity of hepatitis in some mouse strains that is mediated through procoagulant activity, rather than direct viral damage (see Section III, B).\n\nEnterotropic MHV strains, on the other hand, tend to be highly contagious. When introduced to a naive breeding population of mice, enterotropic MHV can result in epizootics with high mortality within a few days of introduction to a mouse population (Barthold et al. 1982; Hierholzer et al. 1979) . Disease susceptibility to enterotropic MHV is also age-dependent, but is influenced predominantly by intestinal epithelial proliferative dynamics rather than susceptibility to disseminated infection (Biggers et al. 1964) . Neonatal mice have slowly dividing intestinal mucosa, making them highly vulnerable to a rapidly cytolytic enterotropic MHV infection. Under these circumstances, mice die within a few days from severe enteritis, malabsorption, and dehydration (Barthold et al. 1993 (Barthold et al. , 1982 . As mice increase in age, intestinal mucosal turnover rates are more rapid, and the mice tend to cope better through replacement of damaged cells, resulting in less severe disease. When mice are infected at around 1-2 weeks of age, infection with enterotropic MHV has less severe consequences but will still produce significant damage that is repaired by mucosal proliferation. Adult mice are susceptible to infection, but manifest no clinical signs and have minimal lesions. Mice of all ages are susceptible to enterotropic MHV infections and support equivalent titers of virus, but disease severity is age-dependent (Barthold et al. 1993; Biggers et al. 1964) .\n\nAs with respiratory MHV strains, enterotropic MHV infection is influenced by host genetic background, but apparently via different mechanisms. For example, SJL mice are markedly resistant to infection with respiratory MHV-JHM and therefore develop minimal disease commensurate with low virus replication compared to BALB/c mice, which have high MHV-JHM titers and severe disease . In contrast, SJL mice infected with enterotropic MHV-Y sustain equivalent titers of virus in intestine compared to BALB/c mice, but have less severe disease (Barthold et al. 1993 ).\n\nMHV has been extensively studied as a model for viral hepatitis. The principal model utilizes the highly virulent MHV-3 strain in genetically susceptible (BALB/c and DBA/2), semisusceptible (C3H), and highly disease-resistant (A/J) mice (Levy et al. 1981; Virelizier and Allison 1976) . As previously noted, susceptibility to MHV-induced disease is multifactorial and related to virus strain, host genotype, and host immunity. Furthermore, this model has shown that disease severity does not necessarily correlate with virus titer. Hepatitis in highly susceptible BALB/c mice reaches severe proportions due to thrombosis and coagulation necrosis that result from microcirculatory disturbance (MacPhee et al. 1985) . This is due to induction of procoagulant activity by macrophages in susceptible mice, with minimal effect on cells from resistant A/J mice (Levy et al. 1981; Pope et al. 1995) . Although virus infection is the initiator, disease severity correlates with macrophage activation and production of a procoagulant, rather than the effects of viral replication (Pope et al. 1995) . MHV-3, being a polytropic virus, replicates not only in liver but also many other organs, yet severe disease with fibrin deposition and ischemic necrosis occurs principally in the liver (Ding et al. 1997; MacPhee et al. 1985) .\n\nBoth the initiation and the deposition of fibrin are associated with expression of a novel fibrinogen-like protein, Fgl2/ fibroleukin prothrombinase, by endothelial and Kupffer cells, but not hepatocytes, in the liver. High levels of fgl2 transcription have been found in liver, spleen, and lungs, which are all rich in reticuloendothelial cells, but only low levels offgl2 were found in brains and kidneys of MHV-3 infected mice (Ding et al. 1997 (Ding et al. , 1998 . Fibrin deposition and liver necrosis were markedly reduced in B6/129Sv/J hybrid mice with a targeted null mutation of fgl2, and peritoneal macrophages from such mice did not generate a procoagulant response when infected with MHV-3 (Marsden et al. 2003) . Both B6 and 129 mice are MHV-3 susceptible mouse strains (MacPhee et al. 1985) . It has been shown that the nucleocapsid (N) protein of MHV strains (MHV-3 and MHV-A59) that induce severe liver disease, but not the N protein from MHV strains (MHV-JHM and MHV-2) that do not induce severe hepatitis, causes transcription of fgl2 through host hepatic nuclear factor-4 alpha (Ning et al. , 1999 .\n\nThus, host susceptibility to MHV-3 liver disease requires specific viral determinants and multiple host genetic determinants, including presence of the appropriate MHV receptor that determines susceptibility or resistance to infection and differential induction of fgl2 that determines susceptibility or resistance to procoagulant-induced hepatic necrosis. These can both be measured at the cellular level in macrophages from susceptible and resistant mice. Furthermore, host immunity is an important factor. Pre-existing antibody can protect susceptible mice from initiation of infection, but T lymphocytes from MHV-3 immunized susceptible BALB/c mice augment, whereas T lymphocytes from resistant A/J mice inhibit, procoagulant activity of macrophages from susceptible mice Pope et al. 1996) . Resistance of AJJ mouse cells to MHV-3 is not absolute. Treatment of MHV-3 resistant A/J mice with corticosteroids reduces their resistance to liver disease with concomitant elevation offgl2 transcription and elevated procoagulant activity, and a similar effect can be shown with their macrophages (Fingerote et al. 1996) . Genetic susceptibility of mice in the MHV-3 model has also been linked with defective nitric oxide production by BALB/c macrophages compared to A/J macrophages ). Resistance of A/J mice to MHV-3 liver disease can also be attributed to increased induction of apoptosis in virally infected A/J mouse cells, resulting in reduced expression of fgl2 prothrombinase in apoptotic macrophages (Belyavsky et al. 1998) . The virulent effects of MHV-3 in other tissues, including lymphoid tissues, also affect susceptibility to liver disease. Disseminated infection of susceptible B6 mice with MHV-3 results in generalized lymphocytopenia, with reduction of NK, B, and T cells Lamontagne et al. 1989; Lehoux et al. 2004; LePrevost et al. 1975) .\n\nMany strains of respiratory MHV have varying degrees of neurotropism, given the opportunity to enter the brain through experimental intracerebral inoculation, viremic dissemination, or extension through the olfactory tracts. One of the first published reports of naturally occurring MHV disease induced by an (at that time) unclassified \"JHM\" virus involved description of disseminated infection involving several organs, with encephalomyelitis and demylination arising from extension of infection through the olfactory tracts of mice (Bailey et al. 1949; Cheever et al. 1949) . MHV infection of the central nervous system represents a commonly used model system, and MHV-JHM remains the most frequently utilized \"neurotropic\" strain for such studies. Most such studies utilize intracerebral inoculation, but provide some insight into brain infection following natural routes of exposure.\n\nMost polytropic MHV strains, including prototype strains MHV-A59, -S, -1, -3, and -JHM, display neurotropism following intranasal inoculation of susceptible mice, including A, BALB/c, CBA, C3H/He, and C3H/Rv, but not SJL mice Barthold 1988b; Barthold et al. 1986; Barthold and Smith 1983 Goto et al. 1977; Ishida and Fujiwara 1979; Koolen et al. 1983; Lavi et al. 1986; Taguchi, Yamada, et al. 1979) . MHV initially replicates in nasal and olfactory epithelium, with subsequent extension along olfactory nerves to the olfactory bulb ( Fig. 6-2) and olfactory tracts within the brain ; Barthold 1988b; Goto et al. 1977; Lavi et al. 1988; Schwob et al. 2001; Sun and Perlman 1995; Youngentob et al. 2001 ). Spread of virus into the brain can be ameliorated by surgical or chemical olfactory bulb ablation . Genetic resistance also affects extension into the olfactory tracts, as virus replicates in nasal epithelium of SJL mice but does not extend into brain ; Barthold and Smith 1987) . Once virus gains access to the brain, there is retrograde spread along ramifications of the olfactory system and contiguous structures within the brain through cell-to-cell transmission ( Fig. 6-3 ) Barthold 1988b; Goto et aL 1977) . In addition, viremic dissemination to the central nervous system is often seen in infant mice (Barthold and Smith 1984) , and immune-deficient strains of mice, such as nude, SCID, or RAG null mutant mice (Figs. 6-4, 6-5). Enterotropic MHV-Y infection of neonatal BALB/c mice can also cause encephalitis through viremia (Barthold et al. 1993) . Regardless of how MHV gains entry to the central nervous system, once present, MHV will cause an acute, rapidly fatal encephalitis, with extensive neuronolysis in most mice. If mice survive the acute encephalitis, infection can spread to the spinal cord through involvement of the ventral reticular nucleus and its neuronal and astrocytic projections to the white matter of the spinal cord (Sun and Perlman 1995) . In such mice, demyelinating lesions are a prominent feature of disease, which may manifest clinically as posterior paresis (Lampert et al. 1973; Stohlman and Weiner 1981; Weiner 1973) .\n\nDemyelination results from the direct cytolytic effect of MHV on oligodentroglia (Lampert et al. 1973; Weiner 1973) , as well as immune-mediated effects. Infection of immunosuppressed or immunodeficient mice has been shown to result in high titers of virus within the central nervous system, but no detectable demyelination (Lane et al. 1998 (Lane et al. , 2000 Wang et al. 1990) . Athymic nude or neonatally thymectomized mice were shown to have demyelinating lesions following MHV infection, suggesting that T cells do not contribute to demyelination (Houtman and Fleming 1996; Sutherland et al. 1997) . In contrast, others have shown that MHV-JHM-infected SCID or RAG1 null mutant mice did not develop demyelination, but that adoptive transfer of MHV-primed splenocytes depleted of CD4 + or CD8 + cells, but not both, contributed to development of demyelination and axonal damage (Dandekar et al. 2001; Lane et al. 2000; Wu et al. 2000) . Furthermore, gamma/delta T cells, which are present in nude, but not RAG1 null mutant, mice, can substitute for alpha/beta T cells as effectors of demyelination Vasculitis in brain from an MHV-infected infant mouse with viremic dissemination to the brain. . This is overly simplistic, as others (Matthews et al. 2002) have shown that demyelination can occur in RAG1 null mutant mice infected with MHV-A59, and the authors have observed demyelinating lesions in SCID and RAG null mutant mice that are naturally infected with MHV ( Fig. 6-6) . Thus, demyelination can evolve from both direct viral damage and from indirect immune-mediated damage. B cells or antibodies do not appear to play a role in MHV-induced demyelination (Lin et al. 1999) , whereas macrophages and microglia contribute to the lesion (Lane et al. 2000; Wu et al. 2000; Wu and Perlman 1999) . In addition to T cells with MHV-specificity, CD8 +, but not CD4 \u00a7 T cells may contribute to demyelination in MHVinfected mice as \"bystander\" cells. These CD8 + cells are specific for non-MHV epitopes and are interferon-y dependent (Dandekar et al. 2004; Haring and Perlman 2003) , whereas the effects of MHV-specific CD4 + T cells on demyelination are accentuated in the absence of interferon-y (Pewe et al. 2002) .\n\nPersistent infection of the central nervous system can develop in mice infected with relatively nonvirulent variants of neurotropic MHV that do not kill the mice from encephalitis. MHV-JHM, for example, has tropism for both neurons and glia and causes severe encephalitis, whereas MHV-JHM variants with mutations and deletions in the S protein preferentially infect glial cells, but do not result in fatal encephalitis (Fazakefley et al. 1992; Fleming et al. 1986; Marten et al. 2000; Stohlman et aL 1982; Wang et al. 1992) . Similar outcomes occur in infant mice that are infected with virulent virus but protected by maternal antibody. Under these circumstances, viral RNA and antigen can be detected in white matter of spinal cords (Perlman et al. 1988 (Perlman et al. , 1990 . During persistent infections, infectious virus cannot be readily recovered, and the majority of virus species are defective in one or more genes that are essential for growth or assembly Fleming et al. 1995; Rowe et al. 1998 ). Low levels of infectious virus may also be present, especially in mice that are clinically symptomatic with hind limb paralysis. Under these circumstances, cytotoxic T cell-resistant escape mutants have been shown to possess mutation in regions of the S protein (Pewe et al. 1996) . These variants have increased neurovirulence when inoculated into naive mice (Pewe et al. 1998 ).\n\nBoth cellular and humoral arms of the acquired immune response are important in controlling MHV disease and recovery from infection. A wide variety of lymphoreticular components, including macrophages, interferons, NK cells, B cells, T cells, and others, have been shown by many earlier investigators to influence the course of MHV infection (reviewed in Barthold 1986 ). The role of acquired immunity in controlling MHV infection has been vividly illustrated in globally immunodeficient SCID and RAG1 null mutant mice, which are susceptible to disseminated forms of natural MHV infection (Choi et al. 1999; Croy and Percy 1993) and experimental MHV-S, -JHM, and low virulence MHV-2cc infection (Houtman and Fleming 1996; Huang et al. 1996; Uetsuka et al. 1995) .\n\nT cells are important determinants of MHV clearance and host immunity. Original descriptions of the nude mouse phenotype, which discussed the \"pleiotropic\" effects of the nude gene, featured MHV lesions (Flanagan 1966 ). T cell-deficient nude mice develop disseminated infections when infected with respiratory MHV strains, and die of progressive wasting syndrome. The severity and rate of the disease in nude mice is determined by not only host factors but also virulence of the infecting virus (Hirano, Tamura, et al. 1975; Liang et al. 1995; Sebesteny and Hill 1974; Tamura et al. 1977; Uetsuka et al. 1996a; Ward et al. 1977) . Nude mice infected with enterotropic MHV also develop persistent infections, but wasting syndrome is often not apparent because of the more restricted tissue tropism of these viruses (Barthold et al. 1985; Homberger et al. 1998 ). The importance of T cells in controlling disseminated MHV infection in nude mice was initially proven with spleen cell transfer experiments, in which disease could not be controlled with transfer of cells treated with anti-theta serum (depleted of T cells), but could be controlled with cells treated with anti-IgG serum (depleted of B cells) Kai et al. 1981) . Subsequent studies in B6 mice depleted of CD4 +, CD8 +, or both T cell subsets have shown that CD8 + cells were critical for control and recovery from MHV-JHM hepatitis .\n\nIn experimental studies with MHV-JHM and -A59, it has been shown that T cells are critical for virus clearance from the brain during the acute phase of infection, and B cells are important in preventing virus recrudescence during the chronic phase of infection (see below). In contrast, studies with B cell-deficient mice have shown that MHV-A59 virus in the liver, and the hepatitis that it causes, are cleared in the complete absence of B cells (Matthews et al. 2001) . Organ specificity of B and T cells in host immune response to infection appears to also occur with enterotropic MHV. In contrast to wild-type immunocompetent mice, which cleared enterotropic MHV-Y infection, T celldeficient mice developed persistent intestinal infections, as well as dissemination of virus to multiple organs; B cell-deficient mice also had persistent intestinal infection, but did not develop disseminated infection and eventually recovered from intestinal infection by 4 months Compton, Ball-Goodrich, Johnson, et al. 2004) .\n\nStudies with interferon-y and interferon-'/ receptor null mutant mice have revealed interesting nuances on experimental pathogenesis of both respiratory and enterotropic strains of MHV. B6 interferon-y receptor null mutant mice that were inoculated intraperitoneally with MHV-A59 developed more severe hepatitis compared to wild-type B6 mice (Schijns et al. 1996) . This paralleled findings of more severe disease and higher virus titers in liver and spleen in BALB/c mice infected with MHV-JHM that were treated with anti-interferon-y monoclonal antibody . B6 interferon-7 null mutant mice inoculated intraperitoneally with MHV-JHM developed persistent infections, with hepatitis in the acute phase that resolved. However, at around 2 weeks, mice developed progressively severe fibrinous peritonitis and pleuritis (Kyuwa, Tagawa, Shibata, et al. 1998) . Naturally infected B6 interferon-'/null mutant mice were found to have fibrinous serositis without active hepatitis. In that case report, MHV antigen was demonstrated by immunoperoxidase in serosal inflammatory tissue, but not liver or intestine (France et al. 1999) . In studies with interferon-y deficient BALB/c and B6 mice, it was found that BALB/c mice developed lethal necrotizing hepatitis by day 5, whereas B6 mice developed only mild hepatitis, and virus titers paralleled these findings (Kyuwa et al. 2002) . Disseminated infections with hepatitis and serositis have also been observed in C3H-interferon-y deficient mice naturally infected with MHV, and in BALB/c-interferon-y deficient mice experimentally inoculated orally with enterotropic MHV-G (Compton et al. 2003) .\n\nThe role of type I interferon in MHV infection has also been explored, but not with genetically altered mice. Recombinant interferon-[3 and interferon-~/~ administration has been shown to protect BALB/c and athymic nude mice against hepatitis when inoculated intraperitoneally with MHV-2 (Matsuyama et al. 2000; Uetsuka et al. 1996b) . Furthermore, intranasal instillation of interferon-~/13 was found to block olfactory neural extension of intranasally inoculated MHV-JHM into brains of BALB/c mice .\n\nMHV, and neurotropic MHV-JHM in particular (or variants thereof), has served extensively as a model for the study of host immune responses to the virus during acute and persistent infection of the central nervous system. In mice that survive the ravages of acute encephalitis, during which virtually all cell types within the brain can be infected, infection resolves into a nonproductive persistent infection with demyelination. MHV clearance from brain during the acute phase of infection requires CD8 + T cells (Lin et al. 1997; Parra et al. 1999; Stohlman et al. 1998 Stohlman et al. , 1995 Stohlman et al. , 1993 , and antibody plays a minimal role during this stage of brain infection (Parra et al. 1999 ). Indeed, MHV-JHM was cleared from the central nervous system in B cell-deficient mice with kinetics similar to wild-type B6 mice (Lin et al. 1999) . During acute infection, CD8 + T cells are the principal effectors for elimination of virus from astrocytes and microglia via a perforin-dependent mechanism (Lin et aL 1997) , and from oligodendroglia via interferon-y (Parra et aL 1999) . CD4 + T cells help expand CD8 + T cells and facilitate their function Stohlman et al. 1998) , as well as participate directly through secretion of interferon-y Marten et al. 2001; Xue and Perlman 1997) . A number of chemokines have been shown to be involved in the orchestration of MHV infection in the brain (Glass et al. 2002) , and are strongly influenced by S protein characteristics of the infecting MHV strain (Rempel et al. 2004) . Adoptive transfer experiments with MHV-JHM-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cell clones demonstrated that both T cell clones protected mice from acute encephalitis, with the greatest effect induced with the CD8 + clone (Yamachuchi et al. 1991) . Conflicting results have been found with central nervous system infection with MHV-A59 in CD8 + T cell-deficient (beta2 microglobulin null mutant) mice, which were able to clear acute central nervous system infection in most mice (Sutherland et al. 1997) .\n\nThus, caution is advised in generalizing about pathogenesis and host responses to MHV, which are likely to be both virus and mouse strain-specific.\n\nAntibody plays a complementary role in MHV clearance, although MHV can be cleared from most central nervous system cell types in B cell-deficient mice (Lin et al. 1999; Ramakrishna et al. 2002) . Passive transfer of MHV-specific antibody by injection or through maternal milk before or during infection will prevent infection or attenuate severity of central nervous system disease (Buchmeier et al. 1984; Fleming et al. 1989; Kolb et al. 2001; Lecomte et al. 1987; Nakanaga et al. 1986; Perlman et al. 1987) . A number of studies have shown the essential role of B cells and antibody in preventing MHV reactivation during persistent central nervous system infection and in complete clearance of infection (Lin et al. 1999; Mathews et al. 2001; Ramakrishna et al. 2002) . There is gradual recruitment of B cells into brains of mice with persistent infection (Tschen et al. 2002) . In mice with persistent central nervous system infections, the continued presence of neutralizing antibody is required to prevent virus recrudescence. Passive transfer of neutralizing (but not non-neutralizing) monoclonal antibodies directed at S protein into persistently infected, B cell-deficient mice has been shown to maintain persistent infection through virus neutralization and prevention of cell-cell fusion, with reduction of viral antigen in most cell types, except oligodendroglia, and reduction of demyelination (Ramakrishna et al. 2003) .\n\nSuch results must be interpreted cautiously, as B celldeficient B6.Igh6<tmlCgm> mice have impaired T cell responses to MHV-JHM . Furthermore, naive B cells also function as innate antiviral cytotoxic B cells , and this effect is inhibited by antibody directed against the S protein (Morales et al. 2001) . In mice with disruption of the JHD locus (absence of B cells and Ig) and syngeneic H-2d B cell-positive antibody-deficient mice, it was found that the absence of B cells or antibody had no effect upon CD4 + or CD8 + T cell responses or virus clearance during acute MHV-JHM infection of the central nervous system . In addition, these studies found altered tropism of MHV during reactivation during persistent infection, with virus selectively infecting oligodendroglia in B cell-positive antibodynegative mice, and astrocytes in B cell-deficient mice, which was regulated by virus-specific CD4 + T cells .\n\nThe clinical effects of MHV infection among infant mice are profoundly different during epizootic and enzootic infection of mouse populations. Maternally derived passive immunity has been shown to confer strong protective activity to pups exposed to both respiratory and enterotropic MHVs under both natural and experimental conditions (Barthold et al. 1988; Gustafsson et al. 1996; Hierholzer et al. 1979; Homberger 1992; Ishida and Fujiwara 1982; Kolb et al. 2001; LePrevost et al. 1975; Manaker et al. 1961; Perlman et al. 1987; Pickel et al. 1985) . IgG is selectively transferred from immune dams in utero through yolk sac receptors, and from colostrum for up to 2 weeks postnatally through intestinal receptors (Brambell and Hemmings 1960) . In addition, IgA provides protection within the gut lumen. Cross-fostering experiments using naive and MHV-JHM infected mice have shown that detectable antibody to MHV-JHM was transferred via colostrum but not in utero, and that pups were capable of absorption through 2 weeks of age. IgG was detected in serum of pups suckling immune dams at 2 and 4 weeks postpartum, but not at 6 or more weeks. Pups nursing MHV-JHM immune dams were protected against both MHV-JHM and MHV-S challenge, but pups nursing MHV-S immune dams were protected against MHV-S, but not MHV-JHM, challenge. Thus, maternally derived passive immunity confers strong protection to pups against homologous respiratory MHV challenge and some degree of protection against heterologous strains of respiratory MHV (Barthold et al. 1988) .\n\nMaternally derived passive immunity is also strongly protective against challenge with enterotropic MHV, but via significantly different mechanisms. In the above described cross-fostering studies, it was shown that passive immunity to challenge with MHV-JHM could be conferred by transfer of maternal IgG postnatally and was not dependent upon active ingestion of whey at the time of challenge exposure (Barthold et al. 1988 ). In similar cross-fostering studies with enterotropic MHV-Y, it was shown that there was placental transfer of IgG, but protection required active ingestion of whey containing IgA and IgG antibodies to MHV. If pups were separated from their immune dams, they were fully susceptible to MHV-Y infection, despite the presence of MHV-IgG in their sera. Both IgA and IgG were protective, and IgG alone was only partially protective. Maternally derived passive immunity did not diminish over the course of four consecutive litters, and pups remained seropositive for up to 10 weeks of age (Homberger 1992; . Cross-protective immunity against respiratory MHV or heterologous enterotropic MHV has not been thoroughly investigated, but it has been shown that mouse pups benefiting from maternal antibody against enterotropic MHV-Y or MHV-RI were protected against challenge with the homotypic MHV strain, but only partially protected against the heterotypic strain. Thus, like active immunity (below), passive immunity appears to be at least partially strain-specific .\n\nThe practical message is that during enzootic infections of a mouse population, pups are protected by maternal antibody during their critical pre-weaning period of susceptibility to MHV-related disease. Although maternal protection is waning against respiratory MHV, and absent against enterotropic MHV at weaning, age-related resistance factors, including genetic, immunologic, and intestinal proliferative activity, are capable of preventing severe disease once pups reach weaning age. Thus, epizootics of high mortality are seen among naive infant mice with highly contagious enterotropic MHV strains, which rapidly become enzootic with occult or only mild disease among pups subsequently born to immune dams (Barthold et al. 1982; Hierholzer et al. 1979) . Respiratory MHV can potentially result in the same scenario, but these MHV strains appear to be less contagious, and such outbreaks have not been reported with respiratory MHV (excepting MHV-S, see Section I, A).\n\nA fundamentally important concept in MHV biology is that immunocompetent mice recover from MHV infection and resist reinfection with MHV, but immunity is MHV strain-specific. Thus, seropositive mice that have recovered from MHV can potentially be actively infected with a novel strain of MHV, which may explain some of the mythology about MHV persistence and \"latency\" in mice. When susceptible BALB/c mice were initially infected intranasally with MHV-JHM and allowed to recover, they resisted intranasal challenge with MHV-JHM at 1, 6, and 12 months (Barthold and Smith 1989a) . When BALB/c mice were initially exposed intranasally to MHV-JHM, MHV-S (antigenically disparate from MHV-JHM, but same biotype), or MHV-Y (antigenically related to MHV-S, and unrelated to MHV-JHM, but different biotype), then challenged intranasally with MHV-JHM or MHV-S after recovery (30 days), mice resisted challenge with the homotypic virus. However, mice immunized with MHV-S were fully susceptible to MHV-JHM, and mice immunized with MHV-Y were only partially protected against antigenically related but biologically different MHV-S (Barthold and Smith 1989b) . In similar studies with BALB/c mice immunized by oral infection with enterotropic MHV-Y or MHV-RI, which are distinctly different by serum neutralization, the mice were resistant to reinfection with the homotypic MHV strain at 1 and 6 months. However, although they resisted challenge with the heterotypic strain at 1 month, they were susceptible to challenge infection with heterotypic virus at 6 months . These studies demonstrate that challenge immunity against MHV is strong, but virus strain-specific. Further support for this finding is that homotypic vaccination-challenge results in near-normal post-challenge T cell mitogen responses, whereas heterotypic vaccination challenge yields profoundly depressed post-challenge T cell function . Considering the mutable nature of this virus within a population of mice, a scenario in which new mutants with novel antigenicity arise explains how MHV is likely to persist within a population.\n\nVaccination has been attempted as a means of protecting mice against MHV infection; however, considering the strain specificity of MHV immunity, the mutable nature of the virus, the generally mild clinical effects, and the perturbations (research variables) that are likely to be induced by vaccination, it is an unfruitful venture for MHV control, but a useful experimental model for development of vaccine strategies to coronaviruses. Earlier work demonstrated challenge immunity against MHV-3 in mice vaccinated with whole inactivated virus and S subcomponents, but not with M or N proteins (Hasony and Macnaughton 1981) . Vaccines consisting of adenovirus expressing structural S and N proteins of MHV-A59 have been shown to protect against lethal challenge (but not infection) with MHV-A59 (Wesseling et al. 1993 ). Mice immunized intranasally or subcutaneously with hybrids of tobacco mosaic virus containing S epitopes were shown to be protected against challenge with MHV-JHM (Koo et al. 1999) . Intramuscular injection of plasmid DNA containing N genes protected mice against disease, but not infection with MHV-JHM (Hayashi et al. 1998 ).\n\nA number of studies have documented significant effects on immune responses of MHV-infected mice through both direct and indirect effects of the virus (reviewed in Barthold 1986; Lindsey et al. 1991) . Most MHV strains, including enterotropic MHVs, infect lymphoid tissues (Fig. 6-7 ) (Barthold and Smith 1984, 1992) . A number of low-virulent MHV strains were shown to exhibit various tropisms for B6 and A]J mouse macrophages, B cells, and thymic stromal cells, but not T cells (Lamontagne and Jolicoeur 1994) , whereas both T and B cells of B6 mice were permissive to MHV-3 infection (Lamontagne et al. 1989 ). Effects do not necessarily occur due to direct infection of immune cells. Severe, transient lymphocyte apoptosis in thymus, with only small numbers of stromal cells and few lymphocytes actively infected, has been documented in BALB/c mice inoculated with MHV-A59 (Godfraind et al. 1995) . Oronasal inoculation of BALB/cByJ mice with MHV-JHM has been shown to result in significant but transient functional disturbances of both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells and antigen-presenting cells. Neither T cell subset was infected with virus, although B cells were transiently infected and adherent peritoneal cells contained viral antigen (deSouza deSouza et al. 1991) . Splenic T cell proliferative responses were depressed in MHV-JHM infected BALB/cByJ, A/JCr, C3H/HeSnJ, but not C57BL/6NCr mice . Impairment of pre-B cells and B cells has also been documented in mice with experimentally induced chronic MHV-3 infections (Jolicoeur and Lamontagne 1995) .\n\nAlthough the immunomodulatory effects are diverse, it has also been noted that MHV-JHM infection can induce self-reactive T cells 1 month after infection, and therefore potentially affect autoimmunity . Possibly contrary or related to this observation is the finding that natural MHV infection has been shown to significantly reduce the incidence of diabetes in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice (Wilberz et al. 1991) . MHV infection has also been shown to modulate the course of a variety of other infectious agents, including viruses, bacteria, and parasites (reviewed in Barthold 1986; Lindsey et al. 1991) .\n\nIn vitro growth of MHV serves several purposes, including isolation of the virus from naturally infected mice, propagation of prototype stocks of virus, plaque assays for quantification of infectious virus, and investigation of species and tissue specificity. Historically, MHV was isolated and propagated in primary mouse embryo explant cultures (Mosley 1961) , newborn mouse kidney explant cultures (Start and Pollard 1959) , primary liver explant cultures (Gallily et al. 1964; Miyazaki et al. 1957; Paradisi and Piccinino 1968; Vainio 1961) , and mouse peritoneal macrophage cultures (Shif and Bang 1966) . Recognition of the hepatotropism of MHV led to the successful logic of using NCTC 1469 cells, derived from C3H mouse liver, as a stable cell line that supported the growth of MHV (Hobbs et al. 1957) . Considering the polytropism of many MHV strains, it is not surprising that a wide variety of murine cell lines have been found to be MHV-permissive. Among the more commonly used cell lines are DBT astrocytoma cells, derived from CDF1 \"delayed brain tumor\" (Hirano et al. 1978) ; 17C1-1 fibroblast cells, derived from BALB/c 3T3 cells (Sturman and Takemoto 1972) ; L fibroblast cells from C3H mice (Starr and Pollard 1959) ; and various derivatives thereof, such as L2 and L2-Percy .\n\nThe increasing recognition of tissue specificity of various MHV isolates, such as enterotropic MHV, has prompted the use of cell lines of specific cellular composition, such as CMT-93 cells, derived from a carcinogen-induced colonic tumor of C57BL origin (Franks and Hemmings 1978) . Use of CMT-93 cells led to the successful growth of a highly enterotropic MHV-RI strain, which originally failed to grow in NCTC 1469 cells (Barthold et al. 1985) . Interest in favoring the neurotropism of some MHV strains for experimental use has promulgated the use of DBT cells and highly specific cell lines, such as OBL21A, an olfactory bulb neuronal cell line derived from transformed neonatal mouse cells (Ryder et al. 1990 ). It has not been determined if growth in specific cell lines in vitro favors specific organotropism in vivo, but it is common practice. Recently, B 16 cells, derived from a melanoma cell line of C57BL mice (Silagi 1969) , and A3-1M cells, derived from 129/SvJ embryonic stem cells (Kyuwa 1997) , have shown utility for isolation and propagation of a variety of MHV strains and isolates (Kyuwa et al. 2000) . J774A.1 monocyte/macrophage cells, derived from DBA/2 mice (Yamaguchi et al. 1988) , have also been found to have similar universal utility .\n\nPrototype MHV strains, which have been passaged many times both in vitro and in vivo, tend to grow well in a variety of cell lines, and this can be true of enterotropic MHV strains that have been likewise manipulated (Kyuwa et al. 2000) . Passage history of various MHV strains, and the viral genetic variability that is likely to ensue, clearly influences their growth characteristics in vitro, explaining apparent discrepancies in results among different laboratories. In one study that compared the growth of enterotropic MHV-Y and MHV-RI in eight different cell lines (17C1-1, CMT-93, J774A.1, L2p176, L2-Percy, NCTC 1469, N18, and WEHI-279) , it was determined that these viruses consistently produced cytopathic effect only in J774A.1 cells. J774A.1 cells produced high titers of MHV-1, -3, -A59, -JHM, -S, and-DVIM as well, and thus were deemed optimal for growth of a variety of MHV strains . In contrast, another study examined susceptibility of six different cell lines (A3-1M, B 16, CMT-93, DBT, IC-21, and J774A. 1) to infection with eight MHV strains, including enterotropic strains MHV-RI,-Y, and-KU, and polytropic strains -A59,-JHM, and recently isolated (in DBT cells) strains KQ1E, KQ3E, and KQ6E. All MHV strains replicated and induced cytopathic effect in B 16, DBT, IC-21, and J774A.1 cells, but produced little if any cytopathic effect in A3-1M or CMT-93 cells. B 16 and IC-21 cells were deemed most suitable for propagation and isolation of all viruses tested. The study concluded that the kinetics of virus replication depended upon both the cell line and the virus strain, and that prototype viruses replicated better than new isolates (Kyuwa et al. 2000) .\n\nThe lesson learned from these studies is that successful isolation of MHV from naturally infected mice is not as easy as isolation of MHV from mice experimentally infected with prototype (passaged) strains of virus, and may require attempts with multiple cell lines for ultimate success. Enterotropic MHV isolations are a case in point: MHV-RI could not be isolated from naturally infected mice using NCTC 1469 liver cells but could be isolated with CMT-93 colon tumor cells (Barthold et al. 1985) , whereas MHV-RI that had been subjected to in vitro passage grew better in NCTC 1469 cells than in CMT-93 cells . Wild-type MHV does not grow readily in cultured cells, and serial passage may be required before cytopathic effect is observed. The cytopathic effect, however, is very distinctive: Syncytia can arise by fusion of up to hundreds of cells whose membranes have fused to make \"giant cells\" with multiple nuclei (Fig. 6-8) . The prototype MHV strains induce syncytia of different sizes. Some MHV mutants do not induce syncytia, but most strains of the virus do (Gallagher et al. 1991; Gombold et al. 1993 ). MHV-2 seems to be a naturally derived strain that is nonfusigenic (Keck, Soe, et al. 1988) . MHV also causes acute cytolytic damage to susceptible cells. Some infected cells develop large cytoplasmic accumulations of nucleocapsid material in vitro (David-Ferreira and Manaker 1965) , which can also be seen in vivo as poorly defined (and nondiagnostic) cytoplasmic inclusions (Barthold et al. 1982) .\n\nIt has been known for many years that MHV can cause persistent and inapparent infection of cultured cells with minimal cytopathic effect (Gledhill and Niven 1955) . This generally follows an initial cytocidal infection, followed by a surviving population of cells, with only a fraction of cells producing infectious virus at any given time. Cells in persistently infected cultures become resistant to superinfection with MHV, with reduced expression of viral receptors. They also readily produce mutant variants of the virus that can have alterations in protease cleavage sites of the S glycoprotein, delayed penetration, and altered pathogenesis in vivo (Gombold et al. 1993; Holmes and Behnke 1981; Lamontagne and Dupuy 1984; Lucas et al. 1978) .\n\nThe exquisite susceptibility of neonatal mice to MHV infection offers an alternate approach to propagation of MHV or amplification of virus titers during attempts to isolate the agent. Regardless of MHV strain or tropism, intracerebral inoculation is highly effective and sensitive. Infant mice will generally die within 24 to 72 hours, depending upon dose and strain of the virus. By standardizing the volume and concentration of inoculum, and using serial (usually 10-fold) dilutions, the level of infectivity of both polytropic and enterotropic MHV can be effectively titrated using infant mice as a bioassay (Barthold et al. 1993; Barthold and Smith 1987) . Following intracerebral inoculation, MHV readily disseminates, so that mice inoculated with enterotropic MHV will succumb from enteritis, and those infected with hepatotropic or neurotropic strains will succumb from hepatitis and/or encephalitis. This method has the ethical drawback of requiring live animals and the financial issue of being more expensive than culture for detecting and titrating live virus. Immunodeficient strains of mice can also be used to isolate and amplify MHV. For example, athymic nude mice have been utilized as sentinel mice in colonies of enzootically infected immunocompetent mice in order to isolate and characterize endemic wild-type MHVs in multiple populations of mice ).\n\nBased on speed, cost, and sensitivity, serology is the best method for monitoring mouse populations for MHV infection. Infected mice seroconvert to all of the viral structural antigens of the virion, as well as to nonstructural antigens that may be expressed during infection. The immunodominant structural antigens are M, N, and S. Antigenicity of M and N proteins is highly cross-reactive among MHV strains, and S antigens tend to be less cross-reactive and more strain-specific, as their gene sequences would predict. Historically, complement fixation was used to detect antibody to MHV, but it proved to be too insensitive for practical use (Peters and Collins Jr. 1983; Smith 1983) . Hemagglutination inhibition has been used for detecting hemagglutinating antibody against MHV strains that possess HE protein in their virions, such as MHV-DVIM (Sugiyama and Amano 1980) , but the HE gene is not present in most MHV strains (Yokomori et al. 1991) . The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has proven to be very sensitive and specific for detecting MHV antibody in naturally infected mice and has an added advantage of detecting rat coronavirus antibody in rats, depending upon how the antigen is prepared (Carthew et al. 1981; Peters et al. 1979; Peters and Collins Jr. 1983; Smith 1983) .\n\nThe immunofluorescence assay (IFA), using MHV-infected cells as antigen, can also be used to detect antibody to MHV and rat coronaviruses (Smith 1983 ). It does not lend itself well to testing large numbers of samples, because it cannot be automated and relies on the human eye for interpretation. However, IFA is frequently used to confirm positive ELISA reactions. Furthermore, it offers an advantage of specificity, as the pattern of staining is distinctive. If cells are handled gently during slide preparation, clearly positive syncytia are pathognomonic for MHV ( Fig. 6-9 ). Syncytia are fragile, and if handled too roughly, the antigen will leak from the cells and generate green debris on the slide. ELISA relies on the use of purified virus or recombinant antigens. An alternative is to use infected cells as the antigen substrate (Smith and Winograd 1986) . To minimize risk of aerosol transmission of MHV, cells can be chemically fixed to inactivate virus. Both ELISA and IFA methods can use multiple MHV strains as antigen simultaneously in order to improve sensitivity.\n\nSerum neutralization is also very sensitive, and offers the opportunity to examine strain specificity of antibody, since neutralizing antibody is directed at strain-specific antigens on the peplomers (S proteins). However, serum neutralization is cumbersome, time consuming, and expensive. Serum neutralization utilizes several prototype strains of MHV for comparison with new isolates, and the relative neutralizing activity of the test antibody to each virus strain can be compared. Because of the strain specificity of neutralizing antibody to MHV, this method can be used to examine the neutralizing profiles of sera from different mouse populations to determine if the same or unrelated MHV strains are involved, or to examine the profiles of isolates from different outbreaks within a population over the course of time (Barthold et al. 1982; Hierholzer et al. 1979; Smith et al. 1983) . Two types of tests can be performed: either in vivo, usually with baby mice as a bioassay, or in vitro, using cell cultures. In addition, one can use a fixed virus dose with serially diluted antisera or dilutions of virus with fixed serum dilutions. The former is performed most frequently.\n\nInvestigators and veterinarians frequently request typing of wild-type MHV isolates in animal colonies by serum neutralization, but this is to be discouraged because, aside from the expense, such information predicts absolutely nothing about the type, virulence, tropism, or identity of the isolate. For example, enterotropic strains MHV-Y and MHV-RI do not cross-neutralize and have different patterns of reactivity with five different prototype MHV strains ). Most MHV isolates will cross-react to some degree with one or more prototype viruses. The most frequent finding is reciprocal crossreactivity with one prototype strain, and one or two one-way reactions. For example, an isolate of Tettnang virus (EgArt 1147), which was found to be MHV, showed reciprocal reactivity with MHV-JHM and one-way reactivity with MHV-3 and MHV-S . Enterotropic MHV-S/CDC reacted reciprocally with MHV-S and unilaterally with MHV-JHM (Hierholzer et al. 1979) . Indeed, long before MHV was characterized as a coronavirus, interrelationships among many of the early isolates were demonstrated by serum neutralization Dick et al. 1956; Gledhill and Andrewes 1951; Manaker et al. 1961; Morris 1959; Nelson 1952a; Rowe et al. 1963) . Serum neutralization can be a useful epidemiological tool, but it does not prove that an isolate is identical to a prototype strain, and does not predict or define biologic activity. Gene sequencing of variable regions of the genome can also be used for comparison among MHV isolates (Yamada et al. 2001 ) but also does not predict biological behavior.\n\nThe MAP test was first utilized for detecting polyoma virus (Rowe et al. 1959) , and the method has long been the mainstay for testing biological products for contamination with infectious agents. There are many permutations, but the basic test involves inoculating mice intraperitoneally and oronasally with biologic material to be tested. These may be sera or lysates of tumors or other cells. The mice are held in isolation for 21-35 days, and their sera are tested for antibody to the agent(s) of interest by ELISA or IFA. Although MAP testing is quite sensitive, and more sensitive than isolation of MHV in culture (deSouza and Smith 1989) , the assay is time consuming and expensive. Several laboratories have developed what might be called \"molecular MAP tests\" that utilize direct polymerase chain reaction amplification for the same agents with equivalent sensitivity to the MAP test, but results are available in days rather than weeks (Bootz et al. 2003) .\n\nReverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), targeting either conserved or variable regions of the MHV genome, has proven to be a useful diagnostic and epidemiologic tool. Caution is advised, as nonspecific amplification can and does occur, so use of appropriate controls and verification of size and sequence of the amplicon may be needed before condemnation of a mouse population.\n\nInitial application of RT-PCR for MHV detection showed that RT-PCR was more sensitive than infant mouse assay and equally sensitive as MAP testing. The approach used primers that amplified a conserved M gene sequence of 375 base pairs, and showed that all of the prototype and several field isolates of MHV could be detected using the chosen primers. This approach also allowed amplification of rat coronavirus, but not human coronavirus OC-43 or 229E (Homberger et al. 1991) . During an MHV outbreak in athymic mice in Australia, histologic findings suggested MHV as the etiology, but serologic testing of nude and immunocompetent sentinel mice was negative. The use of nested primers directed at M gene sequences by RT-PCR resulted in amplification in the liver of an athymic mouse (Matthaei et al. 1998) . Similarly, nested RT-PCR detected N gene RNA in feces of infected A/WySnJ mice. This approach, combined with sequencing the amplicons, is useful as an epidemiologic tool to determine whether one or more strains of MHV are circulating in different mouse facilities Oyanagi et al. 2004; Yamada et al. 2001) .\n\nAttempts have been made to increase the specificity of RT-PCR. Fluorogenic RT-PCR assays use an internal fluorogenic hybridization probe and thus have the added advantage of eliminating the need for post-PCR processing. Using primers specific to the highly conserved M gene, it has been possible to amplify sequences from several MHV and rat coronavirus strains. The assay was also successful when applied to infected tissues, feces, and swipes from cages containing infected animals (Besselsen et al. 2002) .\n\nAcute disseminated MHV infections, caused by respiratory MHV strains infecting susceptible hosts such as neonates, genetically susceptible mice, and immunodeficient mice, are characterized by multifocal areas of necrosis, leukocytic infiltration, and syncytium formation. Small white foci may be apparent on the capsular surface of the liver (Fig. 6-10) . Thorough microscopic evaluation of tissues will reveal mild necrosis of nasal epithelium, focal interstitial pneumonia, and necrosis and syncytia in lymphoid organs (spleen, lymph nodes, Peyer's patches, thymus) as well as bone marrow, mesothelium, and other organs. The liver is often involved, and necrotic lesions, when severe, can coalesce and be accompanied by hemorrhage with parenchymal collapse. Cells at the periphery of necrotic foci often have characteristic dense, marginated chromatin or multiple dense bodies (Fig. 6-11 ). Syncytia can arise from hepatocytes or other cells, such as endothelial cells. Hematogenous dissemination to the central nervous system is rare in adult immunocompetent mice, but can result in foci of vasculitis, encephalitis, and meningitis . Infection along olfactory neural pathways results in similar lesions, but present within the olfactory bulb ( Fig. 6-2) , and along olfactory tracts and the ventral brain (Barthold 1988a (Barthold , 1997b Percy and Barthold 2000; Piazza 1969 ). Hepatitis is accompanied by serum elevations in Fig. 6-11 Focal necrotizing hepatitis in a mouse naturally infected with MHV. Note degenerating syncytia at periphery of lesion (arrow). liver enzymes, and the hemogram can reveal pancytopenia (Piazza, 1969) . The full manifestations of acute MHV infection are usually interrupted by immune response, or death in infants. In the subacute phase of infection, in which virus is in the process of being cleared, liver lesions become granulomatous in character with mixed leukocyte infiltrates, portal tracts may be infiltrated with lymphocytes and hematopoeitic elements, lungs may develop perivascular and interstitial lymphocytic infiltrates ( Fig. 6-12) , spleens often enlarge from hematopoiesis and reactive lymphoid hyperplasia, lymph nodes may enlarge with reactive hyperplasia, and areas of demyelination, spongiosis, and perivascular lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates (Fig. 6-13 ) may be found in the brain stem and spinal cord. During the recovery phase of infection, attempts to detect viral antigen or isolate virus are usually unrewarding.\n\nIn contrast, the full manifestations of MHV infection are seen in immunodeficient mice, such as nude mice, especially those that are infected with relatively nonpathogenic strains of the virus that allow the mice to live while lesions fully and progressively evolve. These mice develop \"wasting syndrome\" with chronic weight loss when infected with relatively nonpathogenic variants of MHV, and acute death when infected with more virulent strains. Under these circumstances, liver lesions are grossly apparent, with multiple white foci of necrosis that can be hemorrhagic and result in parenchymal collapse and irregular capsules (Fig. 6-14) . Microscopic features include multiple foci of acute necrosis, parenchymal collapse, varying degrees of hemorrhage, fibrosis, and prominent syncytia that favor a definitive diagnosis (Fig. 6-15 ). Mice often have marked hematopoiesis in portal regions and spleen, and splenomegaly is often apparent. Examination of other organs reveals necrosis, leukocytic infiltration, and prominent syncytia, including lung ( Fig. 6-16 ) and portal vessels, spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow. Vasculitis with thrombosis and endothelial syncytia are frequently found in vessels of the brain and spinal cord ( Fig. 6-6) , with foci of necrosis, syncytia, and demyelination (Barthold 1988a (Barthold , 1997b Percy and Barthold 2000; Piazza 1969; Tamura et al. 1977; Ward et al. 1994) . Mild serositis is often present, but can be florid, with granulomatous thickening of the serosa of the thoracic and abdominal viscera in interferon-'/null mutant mice (Compton et al. 2003; France et al. 1999; ).\n\nThis serositis syndrome has also been observed in mutant mice with unanticipated immune deficiencies (unpublished) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) . A recent study found granulomatous serosititis in B6 T cell receptor beta/delta deficient mice experimentally infected with enterotropic MHV-Y (Compton, Ball-Goodrich, Johnson, et al. 2004) .\n\nThe pathology of enterotropic MHV is markedly different, with lesions often restricted to intestinal mucosa. Because disease severity is determined by intestinal mucosal proliferative kinetics, lesions are most severe in infant mice, regardless of Fig. 6-17 Florid granulomatous serositis in a genetically altered mouse with unanticipated immune deficiency. The serosa is markedly thickened with infiltration of histiocytes, many of which are forming syncytia (arrows). immune competence. Neonates become dehydrated, and their stomachs are usually devoid of milk due to the severity of illness. Pre-weanling mice may continue to suckle, but the intestines may be dilated with fluid and gas, with yellow, sticky feces. Microscopic features include segmental regions of mucosal necrosis, enterocyte swelling and necrosis, villus attenuation, varying degrees of crypt hyperplasia, leukocytic infiltration of mucosa, and fibrinopurulent exudation into the gut lumen. The most significant diagnostic feature, however, is the presence of multinucleate enterocytic syncytia (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) . These features characterize the neonatal disease, whereas older mice may have less necrosis and syncytia and more mucosal hyperplasia. Adult mice may have minimal lesions, excepting occasional syncytia during active infection. It is important to emphasize that all levels of intestine should be examined, as different strains of virus may preferentially infect different levels of gut, and lesions are often very segmental in distribution. Nevertheless, examination of the ascending colon is often the most fruitful region for identifying syncytia, including in adult mice ( Fig. 6-21 ). Depending upon virus strain and host factors, enterotropic MHV may disseminate to other organs, including liver and brain, to varying degrees. Mesenteric lymph nodes often contain syncytia (Fig. 6-22) , even in highly enterotropic MHV infections (Barthold 1997a; Barthold et al. 1993 Barthold et al. , 1982 Biggers et al. 1964; Percy and Barthold 2000) .\n\nInfection of immunodeficient mice with enterotropic MHV can have variable outcomes. One report of natural infection of nude mice with enterotropic MHV-RI described marked proliferative typhlocolitis. Mice had grossly thickened large bowels and mesenteric lymph nodes (Fig. 6-23) , with marked mucosal hyperplasia ( Fig. 6-24) . Experimental inoculation of nude mice with MHV-RI, however, resulted in only mild enteric lesions, without hyperplasia (Barthold et al. 1985) . Examination of tissue from athymic nude mouse sentinels that were exposed to Fig. 6-18 High-power field of serositis from lesion in Fig. 6-17 , depicting prominent syncytia. naturally infected mice in a number of mouse populations has revealed very mild intestinal lesions, with syncytia in the ascending colon, but no hyperplasia (Fig. 6-25) ). Thus, the severe hyperplasia that was noted in the initial report may be atypical, and possibly due to co-infection with agents such as Helicobacter. Recent studies have shown more severe disease in MHV-Helicobacter dually infected mice (Compton et al. 2003) . In the authors' experience, the most common manifestation of enterotropic MHV infection in nude mice is subclinical infection, in which careful examination of ascending colonic mucosa is required to document infection.\n\nFormalin-and Bouin's-fixed tissues with active MHV lesions can be subjected to immunohistochemistry (immunofluorescence, immunoperoxidase, and other markers) for confirmation of infection or as an experimental method for pathogenesis studies, using either direct or indirect methods. Serum from recovered, infected mice (either naturally or experimentally) lends itself well to indirect immunohistochemistry. Antigen retrieval methods, such as protease treatment or microwave, can enhance success with this approach Barthold and Smith 1984, 1987; Barthold et al. 1982 Barthold et al. , 1985 Brownstein and Barthold 1982) . Alternatively, in situ hybridization has also been used to label N gene RNA in tissue sections, using either random-primed biotinylated or (32p)-labelled cDNA probes (Compton et al. 2003) . It is emphasized, however, that none of these methods are practical unless mice are actively infected, with evidence of acute lesions. \n\nEffective surveillance should incorporate a combination of diagnostic evaluation of clinically ill mice with periodic testing of sentinel mice AND testing of biological material (mousederived serum, monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, cells, hybridomas, embryonic stem cells, tumors, virus stocks, etc.) that can be a source of MHV (Nicklas et al. 1993) . The frequency and intensity (sample size, etc.) must be individually tailored to scientific, husbandry, financial, and risk conditions. Contact immunocompetent sentinels or sentinel mice exposed to soiled bedding are frequently used for surveillance of MHV and other agents within a mouse population. Under these circumstances, commercially available, pathogen-free, outbred Swiss mice are useful, as they are disease resistant and therefore do not amplify the infection, but readily seroconvert. Soiled bedding contact is most likely to detect the presence of enterotropic Fig. 6-24 Cecal mucosa of the athymic nude mouse depicted in Fig. 6-23 . There is marked mucosal hyperplasia with syncytium (arrow). strains of MHV, but may fail to detect less contagious strains of respiratory MHV.\n\nWhen enterotropic MHV is introduced to a naive population of mice, seroconversion of the entire population is likely to occur within 14 days, which is nearly as rapid as seroconversion after experimental exposure (Homberger and Thomann 1994) . The rate of seroconversion may be slower among mice infected with respiratory strains of MHV, which tend to be less contagious and require more direct contact. Nevertheless, the presence of a low percentage of positive sera from a sample population suggests nonspecific reactivity. Nonspecific reactions can also occur in some strains of mice with \"sticky\" sera, such as MRL-Lpr mice. Another consideration is the type of cage-level containment used for housing. Microisolator and individually ventilated caging offer advantages in prevention and control but complicate surveillance, which may require larger sample sizes.\n\nIf possible, it is desirable to test indigenous mice in addition to, or instead of, sentinel mice, or to test sentinel mice placed directly in the cage with them. This will enhance detection of less contagious and more environmentally labile viruses, regardless of the agent. Immunodeficient animals may also require this approach, although it should be noted that athymic nude mice seroconvert to MHV, albeit variably. Direct sentinel mice can also be used effectively for detecting virus shedding from mice with uncharacterized or perturbed immune status, as has been shown with genetically altered mice (Pullium et al. 2003; Rehg et al. 2001 ). Finally, the use of immunodeficient mice, such as nude mice, can be used as a modified sentinel approach in order to detect active MHV, enhance isolation of MHV, or characterize the biotype of MHV that is enzootic within a population . Caution is advised with this approach, as immunodeficient mice will also serve to amplify and perpetuate infection within a population. Likewise, use of breeding populations of sentinel mice, with periodic introduction of naive neonates, can be used for detecting MHV, but will have the same amplifying effect.\n\nThe ability to detect MHV in feces by RT-PCR in combination with serology permits following single animals over the course of time to determine whether the virus is cleared, thereby selecting nonshedding mice for future use, such as for rederivation (Casebolt et al. 1997; Compton et al. 2003; Smith et al. 2002) . This is advantageous when applied to ~enetically modified mice whose immune competence may not be known and whose virus shedding may be unpredictable. For example, RT-PCR detected MHV in the feces and ascending colons of immunocompetent mice after only 24 hours of contact with tumor necrosis factor-null mice (Pullium et al. 2003) . Caution is advised, however, as the effectiveness of fecal RT-PCR testing has not been fully evaluated in mice infected with respiratory (non-enterotropic) MHV strains. RT-PCR has been used successfully to detect MHV sequences on gauze pads placed on the exhaust prefilters of ventilated cage racks containing MHV-infected mice (Compton, Ball-Goodrich, Johnson, et al. 2004 ). It has also been used to amplify MHV from filter dust in the ventilation ducts of animal rooms (Oyanagi et al. 2004 ).\n\nEffective control and elimination of MHV from laboratory mouse populations requires global understanding of MHV biology. Critical points that have already been emphasized include the acute nature of infection, recovery in fully immunocompetent mice, unpredictable or persistent infections in immunodeficient or genetically engineered mice, strain specificity of immunity, mutability of the virus, maternal antibody, contagiousness of the virus, and sources of introduction and reintroduction of the virus. MHV can be effectively eliminated from breeding populations of mice by temporary cessation of breeding (Weir et al. 1987) , but this \"burn-out\" approach has been widely misunderstood and abused. Building upon the principle that seropositive mice are recovered or in the process of recovery, if seropositive breeders are selected and isolated from the infected colony and not allowed to breed so that new (susceptible) pups are not exposed, MHV-free (seropositive) breeding stock can be rederived. When dealing with genetically engineered mice, and as a general precaution, testing feces of founder mice for MHV shedding using PCR is also advised (Smith et al. 2002) . Depending upon degree of risk, breeding should be ceased for a minimum of one month after verification of seropositive reactivity of breeding stock (longer if the mice are seronegative but from an infected colony); then breeding can be reactivated. Progeny will acquire maternal antibody from their seropositive dams and thus will be antibody-positive for several weeks, and then antibody titers will wane. These mice will serve as MHV-free founder animals for the newly derived colony, but caution is advised in assuring their MHVfree status. Direct contact, virus-free sentinel mice can enhance this process while rederivation is taking place.\n\nIt is important to emphasize that this cannot be done with a \"burn-out\" approach on a whole population or room basis. It requires selecting the minimal number of breeding founders possible, isolating them from the infected colony of mice, isolating them from each other, and building up the rederived colony in isolation. The more mice that are being rederived, the greater the risk of continued infection or reinfection. The infected colony contains not only active virus but also new mutants that recirculate within the population because of the strain-specific nature of immunity to MHV. This approach can only be successful by working with the fewest possible founders, strict isolation of those founders, fully immunocompetent founders, assuring the virus-negative status of the founders, and expanding the rederived colony in a protected environment. Resumption of the same traffic patterns and husbandry practices, including placing the rederived mice in conventional housing, will result in failure. Rederivation can also be achieved through cesarean section, embryo transfer, or in vitro fertilization (see Section I, D for caveats). Rederivation of MHV-free mice can be readily accomplished with all of these methods. Xenogeneic tumor lines that are contaminated with MHV can be cleared of infection by transplantation and passage in athymic nude rats. For example, MHV contamination of a human tumor xenograft that was maintained in nude mice (the source of infection) was eliminated by passage in nude rats for 24, but not 12 days (Takakura et al. 2000) . This approach, which takes advantage of the strict host-specificity of MHV, is not likely to be effective with MHV-infected mouse tumor lines.\n\nIsolation of founder mice that have been rederived in the above manner or maintenance of virus-free mice can be accomplished in a number of ways, including housing in isolators, microisolators, barriers, or even geographically isolated animal rooms away from other mice, again depending upon degree of risk. Microisolator cages, with strict attention to protocol, can effectively isolate mice and prevent infection (Barthold and Smith 1983) . HEPA-filtered ventilated caging, with appropriate protocol, is also highly effective (Lipman et al. 1993) . Facilities with two-corridor barrier design, strict traffic control, and protocol can also effectively prevent introduction of MHV, but the additional protection afforded by microisolator or ventilated caging is advised. Vermin control is mandatory, as is personnel traffic. If investigators insist upon unrestricted traffic in and out of their animal rooms, they must fully accept the consequences. Microisolator or ventilated caging in conventional animal facilities with unrestricted traffic patterns can be a suitable compromise, but with risk. Breeding stock that is not commercially available should always be cryopreserved or otherwise protected against catastrophic loss, especially immunodeficient stocks and genetically engineered mice from which MHV cannot be eliminated.\n\nA number of husbandry conditions contribute to introduction and maintenance of MHV in mouse facilities. Shipping mice by commercial carriers is a major risk factor, but MHV can be effectively excluded from mice with filtered shipping boxes (Orcutt et al. 2001) . Feral mice are always a factor that requires control. Unauthorized introduction of mice from other facilities and institutions by naive or thoughtless investigators, students, or technicians is increasing in this age of the genetically altered mouse, where mouse strains are shared among investigators. Injection of mice with untested biological products of mouse origin, such as tumor lines, can also introduce MHV. Personnel traffic patterns and manipulation of mice with nonsterile instruments, such as use of forceps or the same gloves from cage to cage, are major risk factors. Mice from commercial vendors often arrive at weekly intervals and are placed in mouse rooms among MHV-infected mice. Even if the indigenous mouse population is nonbreeding, this pattern of weekly introductions provides a renewable source of susceptible mice that allows perpetuation of infection. Mixed quarantine of incoming groups of mice serves little purpose, and in fact can perpetuate and spread MHV among incoming mice. Breeding populations of mice provide a constant source of susceptible mice, even when protected by maternal antibody, with infection taking place after passive immunity wanes. The growing use of genetically altered mice, many of which do not behave in predictable ways in terms of MHV susceptibility and duration of infection (Smith et al. 2002) , as well as immune-deficient mutants, can all foster perpetuation of infection in mouse facilities."}
