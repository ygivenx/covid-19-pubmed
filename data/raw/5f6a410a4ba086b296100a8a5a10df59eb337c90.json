{"title": "Epidemic doubling time of the COVID-19 epidemic by Chinese province 1", "body": "Our ability to estimate the basic reproduction number of emerging infectious diseases is often 28 hindered by the paucity of information about the epidemiological characteristics and transmission 29 mechanisms of new pathogens (1) . Alternative metrics could synthesize real-time information about the 30 extent to which the epidemic is expanding over time. Such metrics would be particularly useful if they 31 rely on minimal and routinely collected data that capture the trajectory of an outbreak (2) . 32\n\nEpidemic doubling times characterize the sequence of intervals at which the cumulative incidence 33 doubles (3) . Here we analyze the number of times the cumulative incidence doubles and the evolution of 34 the doubling times of the COVID-19 epidemic in mainland China (4). We use province-level data from 35 January 20 (when nationwide reporting began) through February 9, 2020. See Technical Appendix 1 for a 36 sensitivity analysis based on a longer time period. If an epidemic is growing exponentially with a constant 37 growth rate r, the doubling time remains constant and equals to (ln 2)/r. An increase in the epidemic 38 doubling time indicates a slowdown in transmission if the underlying reporting rate remains unchanged 39 (Technical Appendix 2). 40\n\nDaily cumulative incidence data were retrieved from provincial health commissions' websites 41 (Technical Appendix 3). Data were double-checked against the cumulative national total published by the 42 National Health Commission (5) , data compiled by the Centre for Health Protection, Hong Kong, when 43 available (6) and by John Hopkins University (7) . Whenever discrepancies arose, provincial government 44 sources were deemed authoritative. Tibet was excluded from further analysis because there had only been 45 one case reported during the study period. See Technical Appendix 1 for data. 46\n\nFrom January 20 through February 9, the harmonic mean doubling time estimated from 47 based on different assumptions and data sources. See Technical Appendix 2 for scenario analysis of 51 various parameter values. The cumulative incidence doubled 6 times in Hubei. The harmonic mean 52 doubling time in mainland China except Hubei was 1.8 (95% CI, 1.5-2.2) days. Provinces with a 53 harmonic mean doubling time <2d included Fujian, Guangxi, Hebei, Heilongjiang, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, 54\n\nJiangxi, Shandong, Sichuan, and Zhejiang (Figures 1 and S1) . 55\n\nAs the epidemic progressed, it took longer for the cumulative incidence in mainland China 56 (except Hubei) to double itself, which indicated an overall sub-exponential growth pattern outside Hubei 57 ( Figure S1A ). In Hubei, the doubling time decreased and then increased. A gradual increase in the 58 doubling time coincide with the social distancing measures and intra-and-inter-provincial travel 59 restrictions imposed across China since the implementation of quarantine of Wuhan on January 23 (8) . using Bayesian phylogenetic analysis and fitted an exponential growth model to provide the epidemic 65 growth rate (10) . Our estimates are based on cumulative reported numbers of confirmed cases by date of 66 reports by province from January 20 through February 9. Our study is also congruent with Maier and 67 Brockmann (11) who also identified sub-exponential growth of the outbreak across provinces, as mass 68 quarantine and restriction of travels across mainland China began since January 23, 2020. 69\n\nOur study is subject to limitations, including the underreporting of confirmed cases as reported by 70\n\nChinese media (12). One reason for underreporting is underdiagnosis, due to lack of diagnostic tests, 71 healthcare workers, and other resources. Further, underreporting is likely heterogeneous across provinces. 72\n\nAs long as reporting remains invariant over time within the same province, the calculation of doubling 73 times remains reliable; however, this is a strong assumption. Growing awareness of the epidemic and 74 increasing availability of diagnostic tests might have strengthened reporting over time, which could have 75 .

Nevertheless, apart from Hubei and Guangdong (first case 76 reported on January 19), nationwide reporting only began on January 20, and at this point, Chinese 77 authorities had openly acknowledged the magnitude and severity of the epidemic. Due to a lack of 78 detailed case data describing incidence trends for imported and local cases, we focused our analysis on 79 the overall trajectory of the epidemic without adjusting for the role of imported cases on the local 80 transmission dynamics. Indeed, it is likely that the proportion of imported cases was significant for 81 provinces that only reported a few cases; their short doubling times in the study period could simply 82 reflect rapid detection of imported cases. However, with the data until February 9, only two provinces had 83 a cumulative case count of <40 (Table S1) Methods. Figures 1A, 1B, 2A , 2C and all figures in Technical Appendix 4 were created using R version 3.6.2 (R Core Team). Significance level in this manuscript was a priori decided to be \u03b1 = 0.05.\n\n.

In Technical Appendix 4, we provided a total of 31 plots of cumulative incidence over time (left panel) and log10 (cumulative incidence) over log10 (time) (right panel), for Hubei province, mainland China (except Hubei), and then each of the provinces except Tibet (as there was only one case). Thus, we linearized an exponential curve. If social distancing would have an impact, the slope of the log-log plot would decrease, indicating a decreasing epidemic growth rate.\n\nWe performed a sensitivity analysis by expanding our data analysis to the data since December 31, 2019, when Hubei first reported a cluster of pneumonia cases with unexplained etiology that turned out to be COVID-19. The only difference between the sensitivity analysis and the main analysis is the inclusion of Hubei and Guangdong data from December 31, 2019, through January 19, 2020, because nationwide reporting started on January 20, 2020. The only differences in results were found for Hubei and Guangdong. The harmonic mean doubling time for Hubei was 4.06 (95% CI. 3.86, 4.33), and the cumulative incidence in Hubei doubled nine times from December 31, 2019, through February 9, 2020 (Table S3, Figures S2, S3 , S4). The first doubling time of Hubei ( Figure S2 ) was high, reflecting that realtime data was unavailable before mid-January. It was only by January 17, 2020, onwards when data reporting become increasingly transparent and timely.\n\n.

Instead of basic reproductive number R0, R was estimated because social distancing measures have been introduced to many parts of China, since the quarantine of Wuhan on January 23, 2020. Our goal is to provide some indications of the uncertainty around the effective reproductive number R based on the epidemic doubling time that we estimated.\n\n.

We rounded our R estimates to 1 decimal place.\n\nWe made the assumption that the incubation period could be taken as a proxy for pre-infectious period (also known as latent period). We explored Scenario 1 in which a mean incubation period (D1) of 6.4 days estimated by Backer, Klinkenberg and Wallinga (5) based on 88 cases with known travel history to or from Wuhan, and a mean duration from onset of symptoms to isolation (D2) of 0.7 day estimated by authors from Guangdong Provincial CDC using data of cases after January 19, 2020, in a study using 153 cases confirmed by January 23, 2020. We explored Scenario 2 using the Guangdong CDC's data with D1 = 4.8 and D2 = 0.7.\n\nAssuming that the pre-infectious period and the infectious period follow the exponential distribution, we used the following equation for R0 in Vynnycky and White (4), Table 4 .1, Equation 4 .13, to calculate R: R0 = (1 + growth rate \u2715 duration of pre-infectious period) \u2715 (1 + growth rate \u2715 duration of infectious period)\n\nIn mathematical notation, R0 = (1+rD1)(1+rD2) Scenario 1. If D1 = 6.4 and D2 = 0.7, the effective reproductive number, R, in Hubei was 3.3, corresponding to a harmonic mean doubling time of 2.5 days from January 20 through February 9, 2020.\n\nIn Hunan, with a harmonic mean doubling time of 1.4, the R was 5.6, while in Xinjiang, with a harmonic mean doubling time of 3.0, the R was 2.9 (Table S5) . Scenario 2. If D1 = 4.8 and D2 = 0.7, the R in Hubei was 2.8. In Hunan, the R was 4.5, while in Xinjiang, the R was 2.5 (Table S5) .\n\n.

We used the serial interval (TS) of 7.5 days from Li et al. (6) and 3.96 days from Du et al. (7) explored the scenarios where the ratio between the infectious period and the serial interval, fr, is 0.5, 0.75 and 1.\n\nWe used the following R0 equation in Vynnycky and White (4) ( Table 4.1 Equation 4 .16) to calculate R: R0 = 1 + growth rate \u2715 serial interval + ratio between the infectious period and the serial interval \u2715 (1ratio between the infectious period and the serial interval) \u2715 (growth rate \u2715 serial interval) 2\n\nIn mathematical notation, R0 = 1 + rTS + fr(1-fr)(rTS) 2 Scenario 3. If half of the serial interval of 7.5 days is infectious, fr = 0.5, the effective reproductive number, R, in Hubei was 4.2, corresponding to a harmonic mean doubling time of 2.5 days from January 20 through February 9, 2020. In Hunan, with a harmonic mean doubling time of 1.4 days, the R was 8.2, while in Xinjiang, with a mean doubling time of 3.0 days, the R was 3.5 (Table S5) .\n\nIf three-quarters of the serial interval of 7.5 days is infectious, fr = 0.75, the R in Hubei was 3.9. In Hunan, the R was 7.3, while in Xinjiang, the R was 3.3 (Table S5) .\n\nIf the entire serial interval of 7.5 days is infectious, fr = 1, the R in Hubei was 3.1. In Hunan, the R was 4.7, while in Xinjiang, the R was 2.7 (Table S5) . Scenario 6. If half of the serial interval of 3.96 days is infectious, fr = 0.5, the R in Hubei was 2.4. In Hunan, the R was 3.9, while in Xinjiang, the R was 2.1 (Table S5 ).\n\nIf three-quarters of the serial interval of 3.96 days is infectious, fr = 0.75, the R in Hubei was 2.3. In Hunan, the R was 3.7, while in Xinjiang, the R was 2.1 (Table S5) .\n\nIf the entire serial interval of 3.96 days is infectious, fr = 1, the R in Hubei was 2.1. In Hunan, the R was 3.0, while in Xinjiang, the R was 1.9 (Table S5) .\n\n.

The effective reproductive number, R, of COVID-19 in Hubei was in a range of 2.1 to 4.2 in scenarios based on different assumptions and data sources. For provinces with a short mean doubling time, such as Hunan, R could be in the range of 3.0 to 8.2, while in provinces with a long mean doubling time, such as Xinjiang, R could be in the range of 1.9 to 3.5. These estimates are meant to illustrate the range of possibilities, as they are critically dependent on the estimates of the other epidemiologic parameters, such as serial intervals.\n\n.
