{"title": "Postmortem diagnosis of cytomegalovirus and accompanying other infection agents by real-time PCR in cases of sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI)", "body": "Postmortem diagnosis of cytomegalovirus and accompanying other infection agents by real-time PCR in cases of sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI) 1 \n\nCytomegalovirus (CMV), a member of the betaherpesvirinae subfamily, is an opportunistic pathogen that remains latent in lymphocytes, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, renal epithelium cells, salivary glands and can be reactivated in case of immunosuppression. 1,2 CMV may result in asymptomatic infections in children and adults, and it may particularly cause infections with high mortality in immunocompromised individuals such as premature and neonatal infants. CMV may be transmitted through aspiration of mother's blood or infected genital secretion during birth or breast feeding and it generally remains latent in the infant. 2e4 Disseminated CMV infections (pneumonia, myocarditis, colitis, tubulointerstitial nephritis, meningitis, etc.) may have a fatal progress in infants infected with this virus, accompanying chronic sialadenitis, which declines with age. 5 Furthermore, CMV may also suppress the infant's immune system, thereby it may predispose the immune system to infections with other bacteria and viruses. 1, 5 Demonstration of histopathologically-described CMV-DNA in infants with CMV infections and/or accompanying chronic sialadenitis, and definition of the other bacterial and viral infection agents in sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI) cases referred to the Council of Forensic Medicine of Istanbul for autopsy were the objectives of the study herein.\n\n314 (144 female, 170 male) SUDI cases were prospectively investigated from January 2013 to January 2015 in Istanbul Forensic Medicine Institution. Samples were collected and histopathological examination was carried out with the routine hematoxyline and eosin staining method. The blood, CSF, lung, spleen, stool and tracheal swab samples were collected for microbiological examination. All of the cases were selected by the permission of Council of Forensic Medicine Istanbul Scientific Committee.\n\nSamples collected for microbiological examination were cultivated in appropriate media for aerobic and anaerobic bacteriological cultures. The identification of pathogenic bacteria was performed using conventional methods and a miniAPI (Biomerieux, France) semi-automated identification system. 6 Viruses known as the causes of myocarditis (Enterovirus, Ebstein Barr Virus, CMV, Adenovirus, Parvovirus B19) were investigated in the tissue samples which were histopathologically considered to have myocarditis. The DNA isolation was carried out in the QIAsymphony device using a QIAsymphony DSP Virus/ Pathogen midi kit, and the amplification procedures were performed in the Rotor GeneQ device (Qiagen, Germany) using an Artus (Qiagen, Germany) kit through the RT-PCR method in accordance with the recommendations of the manufacturing company. 2,3\n\nAmongst the cases identified to have an 'owl's eye' appearance ( Fig. 1) in the post-mortem histopathological examination of salivary glands, 87 tissue samples (37 salivary gland, 38 lung, 1 tonsil, 3 kidney, 3 myocardium, 1 brain, 1 liver, 3 bowel samples) from 39 cases demonstrating findings of interstitial pneumonia, myocarditis, meningitis, encephalitis, hepatitis, colitis or tubulointerstitial nephritis (Figs. 2e4) and/or accompanying chronic sialadenitis were included in the study. 2 \n\nDNA was extracted from all 87 formalin-fixed paraffinembedded tissues. Three or four 10-mm-thick sections from each block were cut by means of a microtome. Paraffin-embedded tissues underwent xylene and ethyl alcohol deparafinization procedure followed by incubation for 24-h with the addition of 20 ml proteinase K and 600 ml ATL buffer solution. 7 CMV-DNA isolation was performed in the QIAsymphony device using a QIAsymphony DSP Virus/Pathogen midi kit and the DNA amplification procedure was performed in the Rotor GeneQ device (Qiagen, Germany) using an Artus (Qiagen, Germany) kit through the RT-PCR method in accordance with the recommendations of the manufacturing company. A 15 ml master mix was prepared, 10 ml DNA was added on top of it and the final volume of 25 ml was obtained. The PCR tubes were incubated for 40 cycles as follows: 10 min at 95 C, 15 s at 95 C, 30 s at 65 C, 20 s at 72 C.\n\nRespectively 25 (64.1%) and 14 (35.9%) of the cases were male and female, they were aged between 25 days and 12 months and considered to have CMV infection. The age distributions of the infants were as follows: 3 infants at 0e3 months, 25 infants at 4e6 months, 11 infants at 7e12 months. The age, sex, clinical history, histopathological and microbiological findings of the cases are summarized in Table 1 .\n\nCMV-DNA was detected in both the salivary gland and lung tissues of 19 infants. Only CMV-DNA was detected in the salivary gland tissues of 16 infants, while no CMV-DNA was detected in the lung tissues. CMV-DNA was found positive in the tonsil and brain tissues of an infant considered to have encephalitis. Additionally, CMV-DNA was found negative in 2 salivary gland, 2 lung, 3 kidney, 3 myocardium, 1 liver and 3 bowel tissues.\n\nAdditional one or more viruses (Rhinovirus, Adenovirus, Metapneumovirus, RSV, Influenza A, Coronavirus 63, Coronavirus 43, Coronavirus HKU, Enterovirus, Parechovirus) were detected in the lung tissue samples of 15 out of 19 infants identified as CMV-DNApositive, and in the respiratory tract samples of 6 out of 16 infants identified as CMV-DNA-negative. Furthermore, viruses causing gastroenteritis (Adenovirus, Norovirus G2, Rotavirus, Astrovirus), viruses causing myocarditis (Enterovirus), and bacteria causing pneumonia (M. pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus spp., Enterobacter spp.) were respectively detected in 10 infants, 1 infant and 9 infants (Table 1) .\n\nIn accordance with the objective of demonstrating CMV-DNA in tissues, and describing CMV infections and other accompanying infectious agents in SUDI cases, the study investigated CMV-DNA and other viral agents using the RT-PCR method in 87 paraffinembedded tissue samples taken from 39 post-mortem SUDI cases. CMV-DNA was found positive in 35 (40.2%) salivary gland, 19 (21.8%) lung, 1 (1.1%) tonsil and 1 (1.1%) brain tissues in total under the study. Besides, other bacterial and/or viral infectious agents were detected in 23 (60%) out of 39 cases. The previous studies on post-mortem SUDI cases employed other microbiological methods (immunohistochemical methods, cell culture, etc.) in addition to histopathological examinations which were more commonly preferred for CMV diagnosis; however any comprehensive studies to detect CMV-DNA with a more precise RT-PCR method could not be identified. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first comprehensive study investigating CMV infections in various tissues (salivary gland, lung, tonsil, kidney, myocardium, brain, liver, bowel samples) of SUDI cases in paraffin-embedded tissues using RT-PCR during the autopsy.\n\nInitial studies on sudden and unexpected infant mortalities at home reported that these babies histopathologically demonstrated the findings of CMV infections. 8, 9 Variend 10 conducted a study on 51 infant autopsies, and pointed out to the appearance of CMV-type inclusions in the parotid gland of 24 infants and the presence of microglial nodules in the brains of 15 of these infants. In another study that he conducted years later, Variend described CMV parotitis findings in 40 out of 112 infants as well as microglial nodules in the brain and lymphocytic infiltration findings in the liver and kidney. 11 Variend emphasized the necessity to employ more precise methods for future diagnosis of CMV infections at the end of that study. 11 In the present study, a microglial nodule was observed in the brain tissue of a case diagnosed with encephalitis, and also CMV-DNA was found positive in the tonsil and brain tissues of the case (Fig. 5) . CMV-DNA was demonstrated in the tonsil tissue as the salivary gland of the case was not sampled during the autopsy.\n\nP\u00fcschel et al. 12 detected cytomegalic inclusions in the salivary glands of 24 out of 255 SUDI cases. In the consequent years, Weber et al. 13, 14 demonstrated CMV infection in only 3 out of 546 SUDI cases using histopathological examination or immunofluorescent test in two separate studies. Andrade et al. 15 described CMV infection using the immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization method in 37 post-mortem cases considered to have secondary interstitial pneumonia. In another study investigating 64 SUDI cases in the post-mortem phase, CMV infection was demonstrated in 3 cases using serologic method while they verified the presence of CMV in only one case using the PCR method. 16 Dettmeyer et al. described CMV-induced pneumonia or myocarditis in three cases of suspected sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) diagnosis by immunohistochemical techniques and molecular pathologic investigations (PCR). 17 On the other hand, the CMV-DNA was positive in 35 salivary gland, 19 lung, 1 tonsil and 1 brain tissues of 87 samples from 39 infant cases out of 314 SUDI cases in our study, who were thought to have CMV infection based on histopathological results, with real-time PCR method, which has a high precision.\n\nThe histopathological examination is able to demonstrate intracytoplasmic inclusions and pathognomonic intranuclear basophilic inclusion with clear halo in the periphery (owl's eye) in case of CMV infection. 2, 18 However, cells under typical CMV cytopathic effect may not be observed in during the onset of the infections (particularly in CMV pneumonia cases). As a result, it is rather useful to demonstrate CMV-DNA by means of molecular techniques in the cases considered to have histopathological CMV infections. 18 Certain in vitro studies were carried out to demonstrate that CMV infections suppress the T-lymphocyte functions and activity of natural killer cells, thereby causing immunosuppression. 3, 19, 20 Since the immune systems of infants infected by CMV are suppressed, infection with another accompanying virus that causes wheezing may also be seen. 21 Doan et al. 22 conducted a study on infants who developed CMV pneumonia, and reported a decrease in the number of CD4-positive T-cells in 69.4% of the infants.\n\nCMV infections generally emerge in the first year of life. Such infections may have been perinatally or postnatally acquired since CMV-seropositivity is seen in the first 12 months in more than one third of the infants. 23, 24 All of the post-mortem SUDI cases in this study were under the age of one.\n\nDiffuse interstitial pneumonia may develop in infants or premature babies with perinatally acquired CMV infection and it may be life-threatening. 5 Furthermore, CMV infections also suppress the immune system of an individual, hence predispose infections with other bacteria and viruses. 1 For that reason, the infant's immunity is suppressed in cases with chronic CMV sialadenitis in the neonatal and early infancy periods, which causes the development of such infections. These agents could also contribute to identify clinical symptoms of cases with CMV-DNA positive and other bacterial and viral agents that cause pneumonia. The lung tissues of 19 cases with or without accompanying chronic sialadenitis based on histopathological results, diagnosed with interstitial pneumonia were found to be CMV-DNA positive as a result of our study. Other viral and/or bacterial infectious agents accompanying CMV infection were detected, as well in 15 of these cases. On the other hand, the presence of other viral agents were demonstrated in 6 infants with CMV-DNA positive in salivary gland whereas negative in lung, who were histopathologically diagnosed as interstitial pneumonia.\n\nCMV pneumonia may be severe in premature infants and may especially progress to diffuse interstitial pneumonia, leading fibrosis and bronchopulmonary dysplasia in such infants. 5, 25, 26 In this study, CMV-DNA was found positive in the salivary gland and lung tissues of a 4-month-old baby who was prematurely born, who was histopathologically identified to have bronchopulmonary dysplasia (Fig. 6 ) and intranuclear basophilic inclusion in the lung.\n\nCMV infections have a silent clinical progress in most infants while non-specific lower respiratory tract symptoms or an infectious mononucleosis-like disease may be noted in some of them. 21 Furthermore, poor socio-economic conditions also contribute to high CMV infection rates. Turkey is listed among the countries with a high seroprevalence (85e95%) with respect to CMV seropositivity. 1 The fact that some of the infants in this study had a history of being found dead in bed or were exitus when taken to the hospital is important for noting that CMV infections may have non-specific signs and remain undetected until death. 1 Some of the infants with another underlying predisposing factors (premature delivery, Down syndrome, having twin, congenital diseases, past surgery) had more prominent clinical signs and a history of hospitalization.\n\nAlthough it was not possible to access the discharge reports of all these cases, it is believed that the majority of those hospitalized cases were not monitored and treated for CMV infection. Predisposing factors are known for their effects of increasing the probability of secondary infections compared to an otherwise healthy infant. 1, 5 Cases histopathologically diagnosed as CMV infection were included the study regardless of predisposing factor existence as the clinical history was not completely known for almost half of the cases. The facts that salivary gland was not sampled in 2 out of 39 cases during autopsy and clinical history was not completely known in approximately 50% of the cases are the limitations of the study.\n\nCertain clinical studies emphasized that CMV infections (with pneumonia ranking the first) in immunocompetent infants may be treated with ganciclovir. 27, 28 However, there are reservations regarding the use of this drug in the treatment of CMV infection due to its toxicity. 3, 27 CMV infection -primarily pneumonia-should definitely be considered in infancy periods (with or without immunocompromise) and CMV-DNA should be checked in babies without improved clinical conditions. 22, 23 Even though the natal and perinatal transmission of CMV cannot be prevented, an assessment of the CMV-DNA in infants with unresolved disease would significantly decrease infant deaths due to CMV infections. 1, 3 In conclusion, CMV infections that accompany chronic CMV sialadenitis and accompanying bacterial and viral infections may be seen in SUDI cases. Moreover, the demonstration of CMV-DNA and other infectious agents in SUDI cases with clinical history and/or histopathological findings of CMV infection would significantly clarify the cause of death. 14 Post-mortem molecular investigations are useful in explaining the cause of death in SUDI with a suspicion of infection in forensic autopsies. Multidisciplinary studies with the participation of microbiologists, pathologists and forensic medicine experts would obviously contribute for further detection of the cause of death in such cases. 29 "}
