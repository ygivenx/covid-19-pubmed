{"title": "Harnessing host\u2013virus evolution in antiviral therapy and immunotherapy", "body": "Most human\u2010infective viruses are RNA viruses, 94% of which harbour a single\u2010stranded RNA (ssRNA) genome.1 These include established pathogens such as HIV and dengue virus (DenV), most high\u2010profile emerging pathogens this decade [e.g. Zika virus (ZikV), SARS\u2010coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) and avian influenza], re\u2010emerging pathogens including measles virus (MV) and every pathogen prioritised in the recent WHO R&D Blueprint.2 Furthermore, climate change\u2010related factors are likely to drive changes in future dispersion or transmission of viruses including mosquito\u2010borne viruses such as DenV and ZikV.3 The disease burden associated with many of the 214 human\u2010infective RNA virus species is large and growing, yet only five have US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\u2010approved antivirals available and nearly all target virus proteins (Table 1).\n\nWhile virus\u2010oriented approaches are efficacious, the genetic diversity of viruses often restricts such treatments to particular species or serotypes (Table 1). Furthermore, these antivirals are often costly and are ultimately susceptible to escape mutant selection. Simple point substitutions are often responsible for treatment failure,4, 5 while fitness costs associated with harbouring these substitutions may be trivially absorbed by the escaped strain upon accumulating compensatory adaptations.6 Tenofovir is an example of a highly effective single\u2010regimen treatment for chronic hepatitis B infection, a retro\u2010transcribing virus characterised by considerable genetic heterogeneity, by simultaneously imposing potent viral suppression, a high barrier for escape and reduced replicative fitness of escape strains. Despite these synergising effects, complex escape mutants harbouring multiple point substitutions in the viral reverse transcriptase have recently emerged.7 One way of enhancing treatment efficacy while minimising viral escape is to deploy existing antivirals as combination therapies, a strategy used extensively in current HIV (e.g. tenofovir/emtricitabine) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment regimens.4, 5 While increasing the number of combinations increases the height of the escape barrier, proportional increases in treatment costs, adverse effects and counterindications make this strategy one of ever compounding challenges that ultimately remains exposed to the core problem of viral resistance. Treatment failure and the continuous need for the development of additional therapies are the realised costs of playing into such \u2018strengths\u2019 of virus evolution.\n\nAs obligate intracellular parasites, all viruses must subvert key resources of permissive hosts in order to replicate.8 Subverting multifunctional host proteins can confer significant fitness advantages by enabling RNA viruses to efficiently execute multiple steps in their replication strategy. Over time, these features are likely to be conserved within lineages and serve as foci of evolutionary convergence for viruses with a similar host range, while purifying selection eliminates steps rendered less efficient. Nevertheless, ideal targets of pathogenic viruses include those that are also vital to the host, thereby limiting its options for antiviral adaptation and driving more costly evolutionary innovation on its part. Similarly, the potential for adverse effects limits options for targeting such host proteins therapeutically.\n\nTherapeutic drug availability, together with recent advances in areas including immunotherapy and precision medicine, is beginning to alleviate such constraints on host\u2010oriented approaches. Significantly, many of these technologies arose through examining evolutionarily diverse host\u2013virus and immune interactions, which are being increasingly uncovered with the advent of mass next\u2010generation genome sequencing and machine learning\u2010assisted metagenomic analysis technologies. Furthermore, such interactions are increasingly found to perform crucial roles throughout our biosphere.9, 10, 11 As was once the case for the CRISPR/Cas bacterial immune system proteins now used in genome editing,12 these host\u2013virus interactions often employ unique proteins of unknown function.10, 13, 14 This review examines how host\u2013virus evolution may be leveraged towards solving disease and sustainability issues of our time. Multitasking or multifunctional host proteins as antiviral therapeutic targets, methods for targeting such proteins, vaccine design and neo\u2010virology as an emerging source of biotechnological innovation, will be discussed.\n\nRNA and retro\u2010transcribing virus genomes are highly versatile, with errors occurring 2\u20134 orders of magnitude more frequently than in high\u2010order eukaryotes.15 This, combined with their rapid replication cycle, imbues such viruses with two key strengths: enormous genetic diversity and rapid escape mutant selection. Nevertheless, this same process that enables remarkable genome plasticity also appears to limit the incorporation of new information with which to achieve more favorable host manipulation. There exists an inverse relationship between viral genome size and mutation rate, with large coronaviruses the only known RNA virus family to possess 3\u2032\u2010exonuclease proofreading activity.16 Thus, the probability of acquiring a lethal mutation increases as a function of both polymerase infidelity and genome size. This suggests lengthening the genome to accommodate a larger repertoire of gene products with which to better manipulate the host comes with considerable fitness trade\u2010offs for RNA viruses. Indeed, excepting extremely small circular ssDNA viruses, RNA virus genomes are typically far shorter than DNA virus genomes in both average size (10.3 vs. 77.8 kb, respectively) and maximal size (51.3 vs. 2474 kb) and encode fewer proteins (1\u201328 vs. 1\u20131839; Figure 1). As a result, while various RNA viruses tolerate certain gene substitutions (e.g. recombinant reporter strains and segmented genome viruses),17 most are poorly tolerant of additions of new genetic information. Correspondingly, mutagenic nucleoside analogues exhibit broad\u2010spectrum antiviral activity by increasing the error rate in genome synthesis for nascent viral particles.18 This effectively reduces the optimal genome length of the virus for productive infection to below the threshold of viability, thereby driving the population to extinction. Therefore, while the core \u2018strengths\u2019 in RNA virus evolution arise because of the nature of their genetic material and its error\u2010prone mode of replication, these appear intractably coupled to limits on the size of information available to subvert their more complex hosts.\n\nRNA virus evolution attempts to resolve this information economy paradox by extensively employing functional genomic secondary structures and noncoding regions, genome segmentation, compression (e.g. RNA editing, overprinting and frameshift reading) and gene product pleiotropy or multifunctionality (e.g. intrinsically disordered proteins).17, 19, 20, 21 Yet another way is to manipulate host cell factors that are themselves multi\u2010interacting or multifunctional \u2018hubs\u2019 of cellular activity,22 whereby a single viral gene product subverts a single host factor to achieve net favorable control over numerous cellular processes. This can enable the virus to extract maximum utility from its informationally limited genome at minimal informational cost. Multiplying this effect across several viral and/or host gene products may enable the virus to extract a substantial \u2018return on investment\u2019 in terms of replicative fitness.\n\nDespite facilitating viral infectivity, these solutions to the information economy paradox cut both ways. Imbricated dependency on multifunctional host proteins for various key replication steps creates vulnerabilities that may be exploited for highly efficacious antiviral therapies. For example, denying such host proteins to the virus may disrupt multiple key elements in its replication strategy. Where these proteins represent foci of evolutionary convergence, such therapies may yield robust, broad\u2010spectrum antiviral activity. The degree of innovation required to circumvent such a therapy and, especially in the case of RNA viruses, the informational barrier to realising this innovation may be high. Escape mutants that emerge may be forced to overcome multiple deficiencies simultaneously and suffer compounding fitness penalties in the process. Furthermore, host\u2010oriented approaches present a much larger list of potential therapeutic targets than the dozen or so gene products produced by most human\u2010infective RNA viruses, many of which are challenging targets in the first instance because of genetic diversity and intrinsic protein disorder.19 Given the higher fidelity of DNA versus RNA replication, host therapeutic targets may prove resilient to certain mechanisms of viral resistance. Altogether, these advantages may reduce antiviral development costs over the long term, allowing for greater treatment accessibility and faster development of future therapies. But which host proteins are sufficiently multifunctional? And how might these present viable therapeutic substrates?\n\nMeasles virus is an extremely contagious and virulent pathogen undergoing a recent global resurgence. The non\u2010structural V protein targets the single largest number of highly multitasking human proteins: HSP90a, PABP1, vimentin, hnRNPK and p53 (Figure 2). In addition to V's established roles in suppressing multiple components of host interferon (IFN) signalling,23 these interactions may allow MV to interface with the cytoskeleton (vimentin) and subvert numerous host cell processes including cell cycle (p53, hnRNPK), protein translation (PABP1), RNA metabolism (PABP1, hnRNPK), and transcription and protein expression (HSP90a). V is produced by editing of the P gene transcript, which also overlaps with the C gene. The largest number of amino acid substitutions between wild\u2010type MV and attenuated vaccine strains occurs within the P/V/C gene region,24 suggesting changes in this region serve an important basis for natural attenuation. Since attenuated MV strains possess very limited capacity for reversion,24 MV strains engineered to harbour defects in V binding to these host proteins may be suitable designer vaccine candidates. As discussed in the following sections, re\u2010purposing existing host\u2010targeting bioactive compounds as antivirals may also yield therapeutic results.\n\nThe HIV\u20101 accessory protein viral infectivity factor (Vif), also crucial in suppressing host immunity,25 targets all three highly multitasking heat\u2010shock proteins HSP90a, HSPB1/HSP27 and HSP7C (Figure 2). This suggests subversion of the cellular protein quality control pathways or HSP\u2010mediated gene expression is vital in the HIV\u20101 replication cycle. Accordingly, HSP90 inhibitors 17\u2010AAG/tanespimycin and AUY922 (Table 2) were recently shown to inhibit HIV\u20101 transcription and suppress viral rebound in a humanised mouse model.26 Although these and other HSP90 inhibitors have encountered efficacy and toxicity issues during clinical trials as anticancer therapies, aminoxyrone is novel, first\u2010in\u2010class HSP90 inhibitor that appears to alleviate both issues.27 Its efficacy as an antiviral or antiretroviral therapeutic has yet to be studied. Inhibitors of HSPB1 and HSP7C (Table 2) represent additional avenues for effective host\u2010oriented antiretroviral therapies that have also yet to be explored.\n\nHIV\u20101 tat (transactivating regulatory protein), which is required for efficient viral gene transcription,28 targets PABP1, p53 and HAT p300 (Figure 2). The latter protein is further manipulated by two additional HIV\u20101 proteins, viral protein R (Vpr) and Pol (DNA polymerase), as well as the transactivating regulatory protein (Tax) of human T\u2010lymphotropic virus (HTLV; Figure 2), plausibly representing a conserved mechanism of host subversion. HATs and histone deacetylases (HDACs) are crucial effectors in epigenetic modulation of gene expression, connecting a large number of cell signalling inputs with transcriptional outputs through histone post\u2010translational modifications.29 HAT and HDAC inhibitors have been shown to suppress viral transcription (\u2018kill\u2019) and re\u2010activate latent virus (\u2018shock\u2010and\u2010kill\u2019), respectively,30, 31 suggesting epigenetic remodulation of host gene activity is exceptionally important in the replication strategy of HIV\u20101 and other retroviruses. Alternatively, retroviral proteins may block or usurp the enzymatic activity of HAT p300 to direct acetylation of viral or other host proteins, which has been suggested for Tat.32 The interactions between HAT p300 and HIV\u20101 proteins Tat, Vpr and Pol (Figure 2), together with the large number of HAT p300 inhibitors currently available (Table 2), expand the possibilities for targeting HAT p300 in host\u2010oriented antiretroviral therapies.\n\nInfluenza A virus (IAV) engages four gene products to manipulate two highly multifunctional host proteins. HSP90a is targeted by NS1 (virulence factor), PB2 (transcription and capping) and RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), while alpha\u2010enolase is targeted by NS1 as well as NS2/NEP (vRNP nuclear export; Figure 2). The NS1 proteins of avian influenza strain H5N1 as well as H3N2 reportedly bind HSP90 to modulate caspase\u2010mediated apoptosis.33 In addition to impairing HIV\u20101 replication,30, 31 HSP90 inhibitors reportedly inhibit IAV replication without apparent cytotoxicity in vitro.34 It will be of interest to examine whether these effects translate in vivo using next\u2010generation HSP90 inhibitors27 (Table 2).\n\nInfluenza A virus, together with SARS\u2010CoV and multiple flaviviruses, also targets alpha\u2010enolase, an enzyme with roles in glycolysis, cell growth and immunity (Figure 2). A novel inhibitor, AP\u2010III\u2010a4 (ENOblock), was recently developed with the interesting property of blocking the non\u2010glycolytic functions of alpha\u2010enolase (Table 2). While this drug shows promise in treating obesity in animal models,35 its antiviral effects remain unexplored. This warrants further study as a potential host\u2010oriented antiviral approach to IAV and other viral infections.\n\nSimilarly, by committing four of its proteins to manipulating hnRNPK (Figure 2), Sindbis virus (SinV) reveals this multifunctional host protein to be crucial in its replication strategy. Co\u2010immunoprecipitation experiments suggest hnRNPK associates with the SinV polyprotein processing products nsp1 (methyl/guanylyltransferase), nsp2 (helicase/protease) and nsp3 (regulatory component) and may be required for viral transcription.36 Other Togaviridae members including Semliki Forest virus (SFV) and chikungunya virus (ChikV) also manipulate hnRNPK (Figure 2), suggesting this host protein serves multiple, evolutionarily conserved roles in togavirus replication. While this hints at a potential therapeutic route against togaviruses, there are currently no selective hnRNPK\u2010targeting drugs available (Table 2). hnRNPK is also tumor suppressor, with mutated or constitutively downregulated hnRNPK being associated with tumorigenesis.37 Nevertheless, short\u2010term therapeutic targeting of hnRNPK as an antiviral strategy has yet to be explored.\n\nViral infection often induces cytoskeletal remodelling, resulting in cytopathic morphologies including syncytia and tumor\u2010like aggregates. Cells treated with actin depolymerising agents such as cytochalasin D show drastic reductions in production of numerous viruses,38 although such agents, by their nature, have limited therapeutic applicability. Vimentin, a component of intermediate filaments, is manipulated by SinV, SFV and ChikV, together with MV as previously mentioned, and the flaviviruses DenV, HCV, tick\u2010borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), Alkhumra haemorrhagic fever virus (AlkV) and Kunjin virus (KunV)/West Nile virus (WNV; Figure 2). Vimentin is reported to play a key role in replication complex assembly and modulating viral protein expression levels in DenV and HCV infection, respectively.39, 40 Withaferin D targets the soluble form of vimentin41 (Table 2) and has anticancer properties, although the effects of vimentin\u2010targeting drugs in the context of infection have yet to be extensively studied.\n\nNumerous flaviviruses including DenV, HCV, TBEV, AlkV and KunV/WNV manipulate alpha\u2010enolase (Figure 2), an enzyme with many functions including catalysing the penultimate step in ATP synthesis via glycolysis. While viruses often re\u2010program cellular metabolic pathways, DenV drastically increases the rate of glycolysis to support its own replication. Metabolic acidosis is often associated with severe disease and may correlate with the subcellular redistribution of viral proteins to further compromise host stress responses.42 Thus, DenV\u2010infected patients who are simultaneously hyperglycaemic (e.g. diabetics) are at greater risk of severe disease.43 Accordingly, inhibiting glycolysis impairs replication of DenV and other flaviviruses in vitro.44, 45 In this context, it would be of interest to examine whether alpha\u2010enolase inhibitors such as AP\u2010III\u2010a4/ENOblock (Table 2), which blocks the non\u2010glycolytic functions of alpha\u2010enolase as mentioned previously, may block subversion of this key enzyme by flaviviruses in vivo.\n\nOne unexpected multiple viral target is VKORC1, an enzyme highly expressed in liver and crucial in activating blood clotting factors.46 While relatively fewer RNA viruses target VKORC1 (Figure 2), it is targeted by several DNA viruses including the hepatotropic Epstein\u2013Barr virus. It would be of interest to examine what effects, if any, infection by such viruses have in the context of treatment with vitamin K or VKORC1\u2010targeting drugs such as warfarin (Table 2).\n\nWhile not themselves multifunctional, ubiquitin and ubiquitin\u2010like modifiers undergo covalent and non\u2010covalent association with other proteins and exert plethoric effects on their function, abundance or subcellular distribution. Thus, manipulating the ubiquitin and ubiquitin\u2010like post\u2010translational modification machinery, or the proteasome itself, also enables viruses to subvert multiple cellular processes.8 Indeed, most multitasking host proteins examined here undergo extensive post\u2010translational modification.47 Numerous multitasking proteins of the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system, as well as ubiquitin and ubiquitin\u2010like modifiers, are key targets of multiple viruses. These targets include the proteasome regulatory subunit PSMD2; the E3 ubiquitin\u2013protein ligase CHIP, which modulates the activity of numerous protein chaperones including HSP9048; and the small ubiquitin\u2010like modifier\u2010conjugating enzyme Ubc9, which regulates numerous cellular functions including cell cycle by modifying p5349 (Table 2 and Supplementary table 1). Numerous inhibitors of the proteasome, ubiquitin E1, E2 or E3 enzymes and deubiquitinating enzymes are currently in clinical trials or approved for use as anticancer agents.50 Therapeutically modulating the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system may present an indirect method of targeting multitasking proteins that are otherwise \u2018undruggable\u2019 at present (Table 2).\n\nThe last eukaryote common ancestor likely possessed an RNAi system utilising endogenous or exogenous noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) and an RdRP.59 However, host\u2013pathogen interactions have shaped RNAi utilisation throughout eukaryote diversification. Budding yeasts, including the prototypical Saccharomyces cerevisiae, harbouring endemic dsRNA viruses of the Totiviridae family lost RNAi while other yeasts lacking such viruses retained RNAi.60 With the rise of jawed vertebrates, RdRP was lost while IFN was gained, enabling large, complex life to coordinate multifurcated, system\u2010wide responses to infection and eventually supplanted RNAi as the primary antiviral defence mechanism in animals.61, 62 Nevertheless, ncRNAs continue to perform crucial roles in fundamental mammalian cellular processes including pre\u2010mRNA processing via spliceosomes (e.g. small nuclear RNA; snRNA). Small interfering RNA (siRNA) and microRNA (miRNA) are those most commonly applied in current RNAi biotechnology.\n\nIn addition to their sequence and tissue specificity, ncRNA function is determined by their expression level, post\u2010transcriptional processing and modification, protein interacting partners and subcellular compartmentalisation, as outlined below. miRNA is selectively expressed in all human tissues, with 1917 miRNAs currently annotated in the miRBase database predicted to control transcription of > 60% of human protein\u2010coding genes.63, 64 In the nucleus, primary miRNA transcripts are processed into 60\u201380 nt pre\u2010miRNA by the Microprocessor complex comprising the RNase\u2010III enzyme Drosha and DGCR8, the latter of which also associates with exosomes65 which play crucial roles in RNA processing and surveillance. Alternatively, mirtron miRNAs are spliced directly from introns by the spliceosome, independently of Drosha.66 Exportin\u20105 transports pre\u2010miRNA into the cytosol, while a Drosha\u2010independent miRNA subset is reportedly transported in an exportin\u20101\u2010/CRM1\u2010dependent manner.67\n\n\nIn the cytosol, the RNase\u2010III enzyme Dicer excises ~ 20\u201323 nt double\u2010stranded miRNA as well as endogenous and exogenous siRNA fragments.68 All RNase\u2010III cleavage products are characterised by a 2 nt 3\u2032 overhang together with 5\u2032\u2010monophosphorylated and 3\u2032\u2010hydroxyated ends. The strand with the thermodynamically more stable 5\u2032 end is usually degraded, while the remaining ssRNA guide strand is loaded onto Argonaute proteins. Together, these ribonucleoproteins form the RNA\u2010induced silencing complex (RISC).69 The endoribonuclease activity of Ago2 cleaves the target RNA to achieve post\u2010transcriptional repression,70 while other Argonaute proteins repress expression through non\u2010degradative mechanisms.\n\nExosomes and the exoribonuclease XRN1 are both required for full degradation of RISC cleavage products in Drosophila.71 Intriguingly, XRN1, which serves as a crucial viral restriction factor in totivirus\u2010harbouring (i.e. RNAi\u2010deficient) yeasts,72 and exosome core components RRP41, which associates with DGCR8,65 and RRP42 are identified here as among the most highly multitasking proteins most frequently manipulated by human\u2010infective viruses. Other such proteins include LSm3, a core component of U6 snRNA\u2013protein complexes in spliceosomes,73, 74 and UPF2 (Supplementary table 1), a key mediator of the nonsense\u2010mediated mRNA quality control pathways that recruits endonucleases and other factors to regulate aberrant mRNA decay.75 Such interactions may enable evolutionarily diverse viruses to manipulate host/virus mRNA or ncRNA biogenesis and stability. The immune mechanisms and potential therapeutic applications of RNA post\u2010transcriptional control are discussed further by Yoshinaga and Takeuchi119 in another article in this Special Feature.\n\nToll\u2010like receptor 7 (TLR7) and TLR8 recognise extracellular ssRNA as short as 3 and 2 nt, respectively, and are activated to a greater extent in a sequence\u2010specific manner irrespective of end modifications.76, 77, 78 In a similar fashion, TLR3 recognises extracellular as well as endosomal dsRNA longer than 21 nt.79, 80 The retinoic acid\u2010inducible gene\u2010I (RIG\u2010I)\u2010like receptors sense intracellular RNA. These include the prototypical RIG\u2010I, which is activated by ssRNA as short as 10 nt harbouring a di\u2010 or tri\u2010phosphorylated 5\u2032 end.81 MDA5 is activated by large RNA molecules, while LGP2 recognises RNA as short as 12 nt irrespective of phosphorylation or hydroxylation at the 5\u2032 end. LGP2 activation supports MDA5\u2010dependent signalling while inhibiting both RIG\u2010I and Dicer.82, 83 TLR and RLR activation stimulates IFN\u2010I expression, which activates JAK\u2010STAT signalling to modulate expression of hundreds of IFN\u2010stimulated genes, thereby placing infected cells and local tissues in an antiviral state.8 Accordingly, exogenous RNAs including viral RNA, siRNA and their breakdown products are potent stimulators of IFN signalling. Such unwanted immune activation remains a significant challenge in RNA\u2010based therapeutics. As RNAi processing is further downregulated upon IFN stimulation,84 the IFN and RNAi systems compete in a manner detrimental to the efficacy of RNAi\u2010based therapeutics.\n\nRNAi\u2010based approaches to antiviral therapy show both promise and new and familiar challenges. Most known primate\u2010infective viruses manipulate IFN signalling85; however, despite nearly two decades of study, the role of RNAi as a specific immune defence mechanism in somatic, IFN\u2010responsive tissues remains controversial.86, 87 If IFN\u2010 and RNAi\u2010mediated immunity are incompatible, human\u2010infective viruses would likely be subjected to only weak, if any, specific RNAi\u2010mediated immune selective pressure. This suggests the \u2018dormant\u2019 immune functions of the mammalian RNAi system could be re\u2010engineered as a future antiviral or immunotherapeutic strategy. Alternatively, the gut microbiome, which is a crucial regulator of immune homeostasis, T\u2010cell activation and predicts treatment outcomes in anti\u2010PD\u20101 cancer immunotherapy, might be genetically modified to secrete therapeutic small RNAs.88, 89, 90 RNAi\u2010based strategies could be used to modulate host immune programme or selectively and reversibly block expression of key multifunctional host proteins in or near virus\u2010infected tissues, thereby multiply regulating viral replication as discussed earlier.\n\nFrom the first RNAi patent filing in 1998 until the end of 2017, ~ 8500 siRNA\u2010based and 2000 miRNA\u2010based therapeutic patents were filed in the United States. Most were for anticancer applications, followed by viral infections and inflammatory disorders.91 At present, the US National Library of Medicine lists 87 \u2018miRNA\u2019, 28 \u2018siRNA\u2019 and 26 \u2018RNAi\u2019 interventional clinical trials as underway or completed. Several trials involved patisiran, which, in 2018, became the first RNAi\u2010based therapeutic approved by the US FDA. Patisiran is an LNP\u2010encapsulated siRNA (siRNA\u2010LNP) delivered to hepatocytes, where it transiently induces RNAi\u2010mediated silencing of wild\u2010type and mutant transthyretin mRNA. Prior to infusion, patients receive a combination of oral acetaminophen, intravenous corticosteroid and histamine H1 and H2 receptor antagonists, yet infusion\u2010related reactions remain one of the most frequent adverse events.92 Antagonists to other immune receptors as outlined above may further suppress IFN stimulation by circulating siRNA\u2010LNPs or their breakdown products. Further reductions in immunogenicity may be achieved through RNA modifications such as pseudouridylation93 or by encapsulating siRNAs in exosome vesicles or other biological nanoparticles, which have the added advantage of industrial scale\u2010up using bioreactors.94 An alternative approach may be to again leverage the ability of viral evolution to inhibit host immunity. For example, reversibly incorporating exogenous RNA into ribonucleoprotein complexes, composed of proteins that have evolved to inhibit IFN signalling, could simultaneously yield therapeutic RNA delivery and IFN suppression.\n\nRemarkably, siRNA\u2010LNP \u2018cocktails\u2019 of perfect complementarity to Ebola virus (EboV) RNA have been reported to confer 100% protection in non\u2010human primates when administered as late as 3 days post\u2010lethal challenge.54 Nevertheless, nucleotide escape mutants and genetic variation between EboV strains in different geographic locations necessitate accurate, up\u2010to\u2010date sequencing data on circulating strains in order to continuously generate effective siRNA cocktails. Recently, a protocol employing the MinION portable sequencer was developed that enabled the direct sequencing of an intact RNA virus genome (IAV) for the first time.95 Direct sequencing of field EboV strains would drastically reduce the current development time of new siRNA\u2010LNPs. Nevertheless, further improvements in this sequencing technology will be required for accurate, cost\u2010effective, routine sequencing of substantially lower\u2010yielding and genetically diverse field strains.\n\nAs with other virus\u2010oriented treatments, the problem of viral resistance to RNA\u2010based therapeutics is perhaps best illustrated by HIV. Liu et al. produced a double long hairpin RNA (dlhRNA) that was processed endogenously to raise four anti\u2010HIV shRNAs directed against gag, tat, vpu and env transcripts. Despite the cells stably expressing the dlhRNA, together with the combinatorial targeting approach and using virus produced from a single molecular clone, nucleotide escape mutants emerged, integrated and proliferated in as few as 8 days post\u2010infection.96 Notably, however, viral transcript knockdown was variable and incomplete, thereby creating an environment suitable for escape mutant propagation. Selecting RNAi targets in the virus that are even more highly conserved, as well as incorporating a larger number of these in an shRNA \u2018cocktail\u2019, may better resist escape mutants and yield longer\u2010lasting efficacy in future.\n\nVirus\u2010oriented RNA therapies engage the virus on its own terms and in full view of its evolutionary strengths. One alternative approach is to sequester host miRNAs crucial for viral replication. miR\u2010122 is highly expressed in liver and is necessary for HCV replication. This is targeted by two host\u2010oriented therapeutics, miravirsen and RG\u2010101.97 Miravirsen showed some efficacy with few adverse effects in clinical trials, while RG\u2010101 showed promising efficacy but remains subject to clinical hold because of adverse effects.\n\nBesides safety, a clear limitation is that not all medically relevant viruses use host miRNAs as key elements in their replication strategy. One solution is to engineer such viruses to harbour endogenous miRNA\u2010targeting sequences. This yields recombinant viruses resembling wild\u2010type but with greatly reduced pathogenicity, restricted tissue tropism and impaired replicative fitness, with potential use as vaccines. Using poliovirus (PV), which replicates primarily in the pharynx and gastrointestinal tract but causes severe neurological disease, Barnes et al. first demonstrated that recombinant PV harbouring a complementary sequence of murine brain\u2010specific miR\u2010124a was severely compromised in its ability to replicate within this tissue. When this sequence was substituted for a sequence complementary to the ubiquitously expressed miRNA let\u20107a, PV replication was further reduced, indicating miRNAs may be used to control tissue tropism. Notably, similar effects were obtained in mice rendered genetically unresponsive to IFN, which nevertheless generated protective antibodies against reinfection by between 10 and 10 000 times the LD50 of wild\u2010type PV.98 This approach was recently used by Yee et al.99 towards developing a live attenuated vaccine for enterovirus 71. Similar results were also obtained by Kelly et al.100 using Coxsackievirus, where a majority of mice inoculated with recombinant virus harbouring tissue\u2010specific miRNA\u2010targeting sequences showing greatly reduced morbidity and mortality up to 70 days post\u2010infection. Benitez et al. showed that mice inoculated with as much as 2500 times the LD50 of IAV, also modified to harbour murine miRNA\u2010targeting sequences, remained asymptomatic up to 10 days post\u2010infection. These mice were also IFN\u2010unresponsive, confirming that mammals can, in principle, elicit a highly effective RNAi\u2010mediated antiviral response and immunological memory against evolutionary diverse viruses in the absence of IFN\u2010I.101\n\n\nNevertheless, other viruses harbouring similar modifications have shown mixed results. In contrast to their earlier work on Coxsackievirus, Kelly et al. found vesicular stomatitis virus engineered to contain various host miRNA\u2010targeting sequences largely resisted miRNA\u2010mediated restriction. Nevertheless, a decrease in neurotoxicity was observed with miR\u2010125 that also preserved the virus\u2019 oncolytic activity,102 properties that are crucial in cancer immunotherapy applications. DenV was successfully restricted from hematopoietic cells by introducing four miR\u2010142 targeting sites, although the virus quickly reverted and continued proliferating at low levels after excising all four sites.103 Since there appears to be no clear pattern that might explain these disparate effects between virus species, additional work remains in order to use recombinant miR\u2010targeting viruses for routine therapeutic use.\n\nNearly 20 years elapsed between the first patent filings and the realisation of an approved RNAi\u2010based therapeutic. While challenges remain, the coming decade appears likely to mark the beginning of the growth curve for creative new approaches to RNA\u2010based therapeutics for antiviral and immunotherapeutic applications.\n\nTo elicit humoral as well as long\u2010lasting cellular immunity, live attenuated vaccines are the most effective therapy currently available. These are typically produced by passaging viral isolates in permissive immune\u2010deficient hosts such as embryonated chicken eggs or non\u2010human continuous cell lines (e.g. Vero), thereby forcing viral re\u2010adaptation and loss of virulence in the original host. However, the basis for attenuation is usually ill\u2010defined. Some species or clinical isolates are not readily amenable to current in vitro culturing methods (e.g. norovirus),104 which often fail to recapitulate essential elements of the viral replication cycle and pathogenesis. Furthermore, attenuated strains are often so compromised that immune adjuvants are required to stimulate antigenicity upon inoculation. Collectively, these challenges increase production costs of many vaccines while limiting detailed studies and the number of viruses for which safe and effective live vaccines can be produced.\n\nTo address production costs, RNAi and CRISPR/Cas9 have recently been applied in attempts to engineer cells that produce greater viral yields. Using a genome\u2010wide RNAi screen in HEp\u20102C cells and validation in the Vero cell line approved for vaccine development, van der Sanden et al. identified several gene knockdowns that drastically increased yields of multiple PV, enterovirus and rotavirus strains. However, these effects on viral replication were not recapitulated on follow\u2010up.105 As the reasons for these discrepant results remain unclear, challenges evidently remain in engineering cell lines that support greater viral yields for vaccine deployment.\n\nAn alternative approach is to genetically re\u2010program cells derived from the host species that serve as the natural reservoir of the virus. One advantage of this approach is the likely greater amenability of previously uncultivable or poor\u2010yielding viruses for cultivation ex vivo. Additionally, the resulting strain will likely preserve some replicative competence upon inoculation, thereby eliciting stronger immunity in the absence of adjuvants. The challenge remains, however, to identify which parts of the cell or culture methods should be modified to generate broad permissiveness, high titres and greatly reduced virulence simultaneously. Obvious candidates include genes that restrict viral replication but are dispensable for cell survival, such as IFN genes and their signalling components, and potentially certain multifunctional proteins. Taken to its logical conclusion, it should be possible to genetically engineer an immune\u2010null human cell substrate within which to passage virus free of virulence factor targets and immune selective pressure. In this way, the strain that emerges will likely exhibit strong antigenicity but severe degradation in mechanisms of host immune antagonism. Such an approach may also prove useful in the context of viruses that cause severe disease primarily through cytokine hyperactivation.\n\nAdditional modifications to this host\u2010oriented approach may further improve vaccine yield or safety. These may include eliminating pro\u2010apoptotic genes to limit virus\u2010induced programmed cell death and increase viral titres. The culture system itself may be improved to better represent the three\u2010dimensional microarchitecture of the host tissue and other features necessary for efficient viral replication. Organoids and other stem cell\u2010derived tissues represent one approach under recent and intensifying examination. Human lung organoids have been demonstrated to recapitulate key properties of RSV pathogenesis,106 and human intestinal epithelium has been developed for previously uncultivable norovirus.104 Additionally, incorporating multiple tissue\u2010specific miRNA\u2010targeting sequences within the attenuated viral genome may improve vaccine safety by impairing its ability to replicate within inflammation\u2010sensitive or irreplaceable tissues. Inversely, this same strategy may be used to help guide infection of certain tissues such as oncolytic viruses in the case of cancer immunotherapy.100 Another safety feature could involve a drug\u2010selective \u2018kill switch\u2019, whereby key viral proteins are fused to the FK506\u2010binding protein 12 destabilisation domain. Viral fusion proteins are \u2018rescued\u2019 from proteasomal degradation in the presence of the drug Shield\u20101 but efficiently degraded upon its removal,107 thereby yielding a conditionally replication\u2010incompetent strain. The coming decade appears likely to see two key transitions: from empirical to designer vaccines, and from viruses as pathogens to important tools in biotechnology.\n\nOf the 8.7 million known species on earth, viruses are likely the most ancient and prolific with at least 1031 virions estimated to exist today.10 Sampling only a fraction of these diverse host\u2013virus interactions has already resulted in ground\u2010breaking biotechnologies including biomolecule and bioactive compound delivery systems, RNAi\u2010mediated antiviral therapies and genetic engineering using zinc finger nucleases, TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9. These have wide\u2010ranging applications in antiviral therapy and vaccine development, immunotherapy, regenerative medicine, environmental science and numerous other fields.\n\nNeo\u2010virology is an emerging field aiming to further this trajectory of innovation by systematically characterising the roles of viruses and viral\u2010mediated processes in the entire living biosphere.10 As the unexplored genetic diversity of viruses is unlocked through improvements in sequencing technologies and big data analysis, the molecular basis of host\u2013virus interactions and the evolutionary relationships between highly divergent species are becoming clearer.\n\nOne area of interest is the increasing number of nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDVs) being discovered in prokaryote, protist and invertebrate hosts and in soil and water. These include two amoebal pathogens: pandoravirus, which harbours the largest known viral genome at 2.5 Mb,108 and mimivirus, an emerging human pathogen harbouring a 1.2 Mb genome.109 In stark contrast to RNA viruses, these giant DNA viruses appear capable of acquiring additional information without clear bound, presenting an alternative solution to the information economy paradox. These viruses are also suggested to readily generate genes de novo.13 While few complete genome sequences of such viruses are currently available, most of the numerous proteins encoded by these vast viral genomes are entirely novel.108, 110, 111 If the process for de novo generation of viral genes can be harnessed, this could support efforts at directed evolution of new and useful biological functions.\n\nNucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses proteins with inferred functions reveal interesting patterns. A recently discovered NCLDV encodes a full set of eukaryote\u2010like histones and a DNA polymerase, potentially placing it at the root of the eukaryotic clades.110 An ancient NCLDV\u2010like virus may have been responsible for the origin of the eukaryote nucleus itself.112 Subsequently, eukaryote multicellularity, coupled with programmed cell death, may have emerged as an ancient antiviral defence mechanism,113 possibly enabling the rise of complex life. Retroviral elements, in addition to driving formation of the mammalian placenta, control hormones involved in gestation and birth timing in some mammals.114 Such elements comprise ~ 8% of the human genome, which also contains genetic material derived from viruses with no retro\u2010transcription or integration functionality.115 Thus, despite being strictly non\u2010living, viruses have radically shaped the living biosphere. Understanding these processes could enable new approaches to control the basic functions of life.\n\nAreas where improved understanding of such host\u2013virus interactions could have immediate implications include human disease, bioremediation of harmful algal blooms and climate change. Contemporary viruses overwhelmingly infect marine microorganisms, turning over an estimated 20% of the ocean microbiome daily.9 These infections have significant effects on carbon absorption by oceans as well as global nutrient and energy cycles.11, 14 Nevertheless, the interactions between the ocean virome and microbiome and their effects climate remain poorly characterised. By examining evolutionarily diverse host\u2013virus interactions in detail, immunology and virology may provide effective solutions to not only human disease but also cost, environmental and other sustainability issues of our time.\n\nAs outlined in this review, current antivirals almost exclusively target virus proteins and have significant development costs, limited therapeutic range and are ultimately susceptible to escape mutant selection. Despite being intractably limited in informational size, RNA viruses are thorough problem solvers, often subverting multitasking host proteins to achieve favorable host subversion at minimal informational cost. Such solutions to the viral information economy paradox are often conserved, creating opportunities to leverage imbricated multidependency on key host proteins for host\u2010oriented antiviral therapies that are more effective, broad\u2010acting and ultimately more cost\u2010effective. Although such proteins can present challenging therapeutic targets, host\u2010oriented therapies will synergise with increased therapeutic drug availability and developments in RNAi, precision medicine and immunotherapy. Additionally, methods of increasing viral antigenicity yet controlling replication and tissue tropism will increase the number of viruses for which safe and highly effective vaccines can be produced. Viruses such as NCLDVs appear to readily acquire new information with which to subvert their hosts. The fruits of problem\u2010solving by such viruses include large numbers of proteins with unique and unknown biological functions. The influence and genetic hallmarks of viruses at both extremes are found in humans and throughout the living biosphere. By expanding the examination of evolutionarily diverse host\u2013virus interactions, disease, cost, environmental and other sustainability issues of our time may be remedied by leveraging, rather than yielding to, the properties of RNA and DNA viruses as developed through co\u2010evolution with their hosts.\n\nThe author declares no conflict of interest."}
