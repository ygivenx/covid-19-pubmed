{"title": "", "body": "The induction of a robust neutralizing antibody (nAb) response is likely to be as essential as specific cellmediated immunity (CMI) against multiple antigens for the development of effective preventive and therapeutic vaccines against hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in humans. To date, no data on the immunogenicity of the replication-defective vaccinia virus (derived from the Tiantan strain) (rNTV)-based HCV vaccine in primates have been reported. This study describes in detail the immunogenicity of various vaccine candidates in rhesus macaques, including rNTV-based and replicationdefective recombinant adenoviral (rAd)-based HCV vaccines, as well as HCV pseudotyped virus-like particles (HCVpp). Our data showed that rAd-HCV vaccine boosting induced robust CMI, while priming or boosting with HCVpp enhanced the antigen-specific nAb response after rAd-HCV vaccination; however, CMI was not enhanced. Vaccination includes rNTV-HCV priming induced robust antigen-specific antibody, particularly nAbs, and CMI responses. Furthermore, more robust and longer-lasting CMI and higher cytokine levels (both Th1 and Th2 types, especially IFN-\u03b3) resulted from boosting with rAd-HCV. We conclude that the rNTV-based HCV vaccine induces robust nAbs and CMI when combined with a heterogeneous primer-booster strategy, which shows promise for development of a human HCV vaccine.\n\nApproximately 150 million people worldwide are chronically infected with Hepatitis C virus (HCV), putting them at a higher risk of liver cirrhosis and liver cancer, and which is associated with the deaths of more than 350,000 people annually. 1 Although medications are improving rapidly, the development of effective vaccines for HCV, especially therapeutic ones, remains a top priority. 2 Fortunately, ~25% of HCV-infected individuals spontaneously clear the virus during the acute stage of infection. 2 Researchers have identified several factors associated with viral clearance, which could facilitate development of an effective HCV vaccine. 2 Various studies have found that the induction and maintenance of strong helper and cytotoxic T-cell immune responses plays a pivotal role in viral clearance and defence against chronic HCV infection. 2, 3 An effective vaccine should induce multiple viral antigen-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell responses, especially Th-1-type immune responses. [4] [5] [6] [7] At the same time, neutralizing antibody (nAb), induced by the candidate vaccine, should recognize and bind to a variety of genotypes of HCV at multiple sites to prevent infection. 7 Also, the immune responses induced by immunogens are regulated by cytokines (e.g., IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL10), which then determine the outcome of HCV infection. 8 The integrated cytokine test, although cytokine production is majorly primarily by the genetic makeup of an individual, may assist in assessment of the efficacy of a candidate vaccine. 2 The antigen-presenting pathway is mediated and modulated by viral vectors, 2, 9 which regulate the efficiency of antigen-presentation and the host immune response. After much research, several HCV vaccine candidates, including peptides, proteins, DNA, virus-like particles, and viral vector-based vaccines, have been developed. 10 The immunogenic potential of these vaccines and combinations has been described in laboratory animals and humans. 6 Previous studies revealed that most recombinant virus vectors, such as rAd and recombinant vaccinia virus (rVV), are advantageous in terms of their induction of the cellular immune response. Moreover, pseudotyped virus-like particles with HCV E1/E2 envelope proteins (HCVpp), derived from recombinant retroviral or lentiviral vectors, can induce high-titre antigen-specific antibodies and nAbs. 11 Heterologous prime-boost immunization seems to be a good strategy to enhance both humoral and cellular immune responses. The rAd-based vaccine was used as the priming vaccination, followed by boosting with HCVpp 11,12 and a combination of rAd-and DNA-or MVA-based vaccines proved efficacious in stimulating cell-mediated immunity (CMI). However, other heterologous prome-boost regimens, such as priming with HCVpp and boosting with rAd or rVV, may also have potential.\n\nThe rVV, derived from the Tiantan strain (rVVT), has been widely used as a smallpox vaccine in China and proved to be\n\nless virulent than the pathogenic WR strain. [13] [14] [15] Furthermore, by deleted the 26 genes associate with host range and virulence between the C and K digestion fragments of Hind III, we developed a recombinant, replication-defective vaccinia (Tiantan strain) viral vector (rNTV), which can well propagated in primary chick embryo fibroblasts but lack of replicative ability in primates and rabbits, and is therefore much safer than rVVT. 15 To date, no data on the immunogenicity of the rNTV-based HCV vaccine in primates have been reported. HCV structural proteins might induce nAbs and activate T-cell responses that mediate viral clearance, and NS3 is essential for HCV clearance as it induces an early and sustained cell-mediated immune response. 10, 16, 17 Therefore, both structural proteins and the NS3 antigen are targets for HCV vaccine development. 2 Due to safety considerations, integration-deficient lentiviral vectors were used to capture HCV envelope proteins (E1, E2) and insert a relatively well conserved non-structural protein NS3 into the transfer genome as the target antigen. 13, 14, 18 Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of both recombinant viral vector-based vaccines and the prime-boost strategy in several clinical trials. 2 Research has begun to focus increasingly on replicating-deficient vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA)-based vaccines. 2, 19, 20 Although not a natural host, the macaque has proven to be an important vaccination model for predicting successful human immune responses to multiple antigens because of the similarity of the macaque immune system to that of humans. Here, we compare a number of vaccination regimes in macaques using various HCV vaccine candidates; i.e., rAd-HCV, rNTV-HCV, and HCVpp. This report is to our knowledge the first to describe an optimized rNTV-based HCV vaccine regime that elicits robust CMI and cross-nAb responses in macaques when combined with rAd-HCV vaccine candidates.\n\nThe construction and enrichment of the rAd-HCV, rNTV-HCV, and HCVpp vaccine candidates (Figure 1) were reported in our previous work, and their expression and infectivity were confirmed. 12, 21 Eleven monkeys divided into three groups ( Table 1 ) received I.M. immunizations with rAd-HCV, rNTV-HCV, or HCVpp Table 1 . Blood samples were assessed for HCV-antigen-specific cell-mediated immunity (CMI) (ELISPOT, Luminex) at the (filled triangle) indicated time points (Luminex detection of multiple cytokines only at week 38). Antibody (IgG) and neutralizing antibody (nAb) titres were assessed every 2 weeks after immunization (inverted triangle) (nAb analysis at weeks 26 and 38). Only four monkeys were immunized with rAd-HCV and were assessed in the weeks indicated by italicized numbers. Table 1 . Each group was then evaluated in terms of immunogenicity (Figure 2 ). We first assessed the HCV-specific antibody response following administration of various vaccine regimens (Figure 3) . Robust antibodies against E1, E2, and NS3 were induced among most of the monkeys in groups A and C, which were primed with both HCVpp and rNTV-HCV (Figure 3a-f) . No significant enhancement of antibody against HCV target antigens was observed after boosting with HCVpp or rAd-HCV (Figure 3a-c) . A single injection of rNTV produced a significantly higher E1 antibody titre than did a single injection of HCVpp or rAd-HCV (P = 0.042). In the rNTV-HCV priming group, the titre decreased slowly over the next 3 months, and HCV E1 (P = 0.004) and E2 (P = 0.035) antibody were also detected after heterologous boosting with rAd-HCV (Figure 3d-f ). The titres of antibodies against E1 and E2 were low in the group primed with a single rAd-HCV, but anti-E1 antibody titre was enhanced after a second rAd-HCV injection (P = 0.03). Boosting with HCVpp increased the antibody titres against E1 and E2, which persisted up to week 34 in group C (Figure 3g-i) . However, no increased production of antibodies against E1, E2, or NS3 was detected after further boosting with rNTV-HCV in group C (Figure 3g-i) . The differences among the three groups were compared at each time point. There were no significant differences in levels of antibodies against E2 and NS3 among the three groups primed with HCVpp, rNTV-HCV, and rAd-HCV, although the anti-E1 antibody titre was higher in the group primed with rNTV-HCV (Figure 4a ). In addition, the anti-E1 and -E2 responses in group B (rNTV-HCV priming and rAd-HCV boosting) were significantly higher than those in the other two groups (P < 0.023) at week 38 (Figure 4b) .\n\nTwelve rhesus macaques divided into three groups were immunized with rAd-HCV, rNTV-HCV, and HCVpp, as described in Table 1 . Results are expressed as (a,d,g,j) anti-E1 IgG, (b,e,h,k) anti-E2 IgG, and (c,f,i,l) anti-NS3 IgG titres determined using serial twofold dilutions of sera. All sera were negative pre-immunization when tested at a 1:100 dilution and are plotted below this detection limit. The first three rows (a-i) indicate the titre changes in an individual, and the median response with standard error (represented by bars) of each group is shown at the end of the line (j-l). In all experiments (a-i), the mean of triplicate determinations of each sample is shown. An asterisk denotes a significant difference in comparison with the control response at that time point. Associated P values are provided in the text: *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 (by Wilcoxon signed-rank test).\n\nAnti-HCV-E1 Cross-nAbs against HCV were also induced by priming with rNTV-HCV or HCVpp Next, we assessed the cross-neutralization ability of HCVpps pseudotyped with the E1 and E2 proteins of five genotypes: 1a (H77), 1b (Hebei), 2a (JFH1), 3a (S52), and 5a (SA13). Pseudoparticles with envelope protein G of VSV (VSVGpp) were used as the control. Serum samples were taken at weeks 26 (2 weeks after priming with HCVpp or rNTV-HCV) and 38 (2 weeks after boosting with rAd-HCV or rNTV-HCV). As shown in Figure 4c , at week 26, all three groups demonstrated significant neutralization of HCVpp derived from the 1b genotype, 22 which was homologous to the immunogens. Furthermore, broad neutralizing ability of heterologous HCVpps (1a, 1b, 5a subtypes) was detected after a single vaccination with rNTV-HCV or HCVpp. The cross-neutralizing ability was further potentiated by boosting with rAd-HCV at week 38 (Figure 4d) . However, a second rNTV booster did not enhance the neutralizing ability in group C (rAd-HCV prime and HCVpp boost).\n\nThe antigen-specific T-cell responses induced by the three immune regimens were assessed by IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT. Monkeys were bled 2 weeks after each vaccination, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from whole blood were stimulated with overlapping peptides spanning the HCV target antigens. No CMI was detected in macaques primed with HCVpp at weeks 22 and 28. After boosting with rAd-HCV, three monkeys in the HCVpp priming group demonstrated positive immunity (median, 178; range: 27-541 SFU/million PBMCs), which was maintained up to week 50 (median, 78; range: 11-148 SFU/million PBMCs) (Figure 5a) . In contrast, all four monkeys primed with rNTV-HCV showed strong CMI responses (median, 597; range: 311-1,210 SFU/million PBMCs) at week 22. The CMI response decreased markedly by week 32 in the group with rNTV-HCV priming, but marked enhancement resulted from rAd-HCV vaccination boosting at week 36 (median, 1,545; range: 818-2,210 SFU/million PBMCs). Furthermore, the CMI was maintained at a higher level in the group with rNTV-HCV prime/rAd-HCV boost compared with the other two groups at week 50, and was detectable up to week 74 (range: 121-496 SFU/million PBMCs) (Figure 5b) . Before week 20, four monkeys were immunized with rAd twice, but only one monkey (06080022) demonstrated weak HCV-specific T-cell responses (range: 112-344 SFU/million PBMCs) (mainly to E2 peptides). The sample remained positive up to week 20. The rAd-primed group was then boosted with HCVpp at week 24, and although the response in 06080022 was not increased, other monkeys in the same group showed slight increases (median, 166; range: 110-232 SFU/million PBMCs). However, two boosts with HCVpps did not significantly reinforce the T-cell response. The rNTV boost at week 30 caused a marked increase in two out of four macaques in the rAd group (median, 324; range: 10-1,518 SFU/million PBMCs) (Figure 5c) . In addition, specific T-cell responses were also assessed using four separate peptide pools spanning the four HCV vaccine targets (Core, E1, E2, NS3). The rNTV-HCV priming group exhibited significant enhancements in all four peptides, especially after boosting with rAd-HCV at week 36 (Figure 5d ). In detail, priming with rNTV-HCV induced two monkeys in the group to be positive to E1, all positive to E2, and three positive to NS3; this was the only vaccine that was effective after a single administration. After boosting with rAd-HCV, all samples in group 2 became positive to the four peptides, with the exception of one monkey that was negative to NS3 and Core. This is a compelling advantage compared with the other two regimens. Boosting with rAd-HCV was also effective in the HCVpp-primed group. However, priming with rAd did not markedly enhance the CMI in group 1 (Figure 5d) . The boost effect of rNTV-HCV was similarly disappointing in group 3 after boosting with HCVpp. Moreover, use of HCVpp as either the primer or booster antigen induced no detectable CMI.\n\nWe also assessed the effect of the various regimens on cytokine production by PBMC. Freshly isolated PBMC were stimulated with the HCV peptide pools and the supernatants were harvested at 24 and 48 hours after stimulation, after which cytokine levels at week 38 were assessed. Commercial cytokine kits were used following the manufacturer's instructions and their respective standards. The assayed cytokines included those related to Th1 (TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, and IL-12) and Th2 (IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, and IL-10) (Figure 6) .\n\nConsistent with the ELISPOT results, the secreted concentrations of Th1 cytokines (IL-2, IL-12, TNF-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b3) in the PBMC of the group that received rNTV/rAd vaccination were higher than those of the other groups (Figure 6a) . The rNTV-rAd group also showed enhancement of Th2 cytokines, which correlated with the strongest HCV-specific humoral immune response (Figure 6b) . Although the rNTV-rAd group exhibited a higher IL-6 level than the other two groups, its rate of enhancement after peptide stimulation was significantly lower than that of the HCVpp/rAd-HCV group (Figure 6c) .\n\nThe rhesus macaque vaccination model is a useful tool in the evaluation of immune responses induced by HCV immunogens. 15 We report herein for the first time the evaluation of immunogenicity in primates using a novel replication-defective rNTV-based HCV vaccine. We also performed the first in-depth analysis of the 3, [23] [24] [25] Recently, several viral vaccine candidates have shown great promise in preclinical and clinical trials, transiently reducing viral loads in some chronically infected subjects. Among these, viral vector (especially rAd or rMVA-based) vaccine candidates and heterogeneous prime-boost vaccination may represent the most promising strategy for development of an HCV vaccine. 2, 10, 17, 23 The distinguished safety record of rTTV, coupled with its ability to induce robust and persistent CMI in humans, make this live-attenuated vaccine an attractive vector candidate for HCV vaccines. 17 Given the concerns surrounding the pre-existing immunity and potential risks of rAd5-and rTTV-based vaccines in humans, it remains encouraging that comparable immunogenicity can be achieved in primates using replication-defective rNTV-based vaccine candidates and a heterologous prime-boost regimen. 26 rNTV is a novel viral vector vaccine based on the Tiantan strain of vaccinia virus, which is a highly attenuated strain used widely as a safe viral vector to deliver antigens. 15 The vector can be effectively amplified in chicken embryo cells to reach a high titre, but has not been effectively reproduced in cell lines from humans, rabbits, and monkeys, which make the rNTV vector easy to produce and safer for human use. The rNTV exhibits DNA replication, RNA transcription and protein expression similar to the original Tiantan strain, so its expression efficiency and immunogenicity is approximated to the original virus. Our data agree with previous reports in which rNTV was a highly reliable primer of antibody and CD8 + T-cell responses. In this study, we showed that the rNTV vector has excellent immunogenicity in terms of induction of effective HCV-specific cellular and humoral immune responses in rhesus monkeys, and the neutralizing capacity of the activated antibody was not weaker than the HCVpp. However, our data also show that the immunity induced in rhesus macaques by rNTV-HCV vaccination was not of long duration. Encouragingly, the immune response can be rapidly stimulated and enhanced by rAd-HCV boosting. The enhanced response was maintained for longer, and the spectrum of antibodies may be improved, suggesting that priming with rNTV and boosting with rAd may be an ideal strategy for inducing long-lasting protective immunity against HCV. In addition, analysis of the cytokine profile revealed that cytokine production by the HCV-specific Th1 (especially IFN-\u03b3) and Th2 subsets in PBMCs of macaques with an rNTV-HCV prime/rAd-HCV booster were significantly increased compared with other regimens. Figure 6 Multiple cytokine detection in the culture supernatants of PBMCs stimulated with peptides at week 38. PBMCs (5 \u00d7 10 5 ) from vaccinated rhesus macaques were cocultured with 4 \u03bcg/ml peptides, with culture medium as the negative control. After 2 days in culture, cytokines in supernatants were assayed by Luminex. (a,b) Th1 (TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL2, and IL12) and Th2 (IL4, IL5, IL10, and IL6) cytokines were quantitated. (c) The cytokine levels of activated samples were divided by those of the negative control to calculate the enhancement rate. The enhancement rates among the three groups were compared by two-way analysis of variance. Cytokines whose expression was significantly different between the groups are indicated by asterisks (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01). IL12  IL6   IL10   IL5   IL4   Th1  Th2   IL2   IFN-\u03b3   TNF-\u03b1   IL12  IL4  IL5  IL6  IL10 Previous studies have reported that an adenoviral vector strategy can induce sustained T-cell responses of a magnitude and quality associated with protective immunity for HCV. 2, 27 Our previous data indicated that vaccination with rAd5-CE1E2 induced significant CMI in mice; however, no nAbs were detected. 12 In agreement with this, our data also indicated that boosting with rAd-HCV can effectively enhance the CMI when rhesus macaques are primed with rNTV-HCV or HCVpp. Our data also agree with the previous murine data, demonstrating that a moderately high IgG level was induced by rAd-HCV priming. However, rAd-HCV priming failed to induce a robust nAb response to HCV in macaques. Furthermore, rAd-HCV boosting also failed to significantly broaden or enhance the nAb response to HCV in macaques primed with HCVpp.\n\nIn addition, recent studies have shown that HCV pseudoparticles based on a retroviral vector effectively trigger production of broad-spectrum nAb in mice and rhesus macaques, 11 which is considered a critical factor for prevention of infection with highly variable viruses such as HCV and HIV. To develop a double-effect vaccine that induces both cellular and humoral immunity to HCV, we developed a novel HCVpp with envelope proteins from E1E2 of HCV within which was packed the NS3 gene in an ssRNA form, based on an integration-deficient lentiviral vectors platform. [28] [29] [30] Our previous work in mice initially confirmed that the novel HCVpp exhibited a specific cellular-immunity-enhancing ability and induced production of cross-nAb. Therefore, this new HCVpp vaccine may also exhibit a double-activation ability in rhesus macaques. Using the same rAd prime and HCVpp boost immunization strategy as in a previous study, 11 HCVpp vaccination also elicited strong humoral immune responses to HCV antigens in macaques. More broad-spectrum neutralizing activity was also induced after priming with HCVpp and boosting with rAd-HCV, although there was no obvious enhancement of the antibody response to HCV E1/E2. rAd-HCV boosting may play a more important role in the induction of a cross-neutralizing response by a vaccine. 2 However, priming with HCVpp failed to induce robust CMI to HCV in macaques.\n\nWe attempted to further induce immunity by rNTV-HCV vaccination following rAd-HCV/HCVpp. However, both total IgG and nAb against HCV showed a downward trend, although CMI was induced. A possible cause of this phenomenon is regulation of cytokines: HCVpp tends to activate Th2 cytokine production for B cell amplification, but rNTV may result in dual induction of Th1 and Th2. After intervention with rNTV, high levels of Th2 cytokines activate negative feedback regulation by dendritic cells (DC) or natural killer T cells. 31, 32 Unfortunately, we were unable to assay cytokines by cell sorting, which would allow differentiation of the cytokine expression profiles of CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells, DC, and natural killer T.\n\nIn summary, this is to our knowledge the first evaluation of immunogenicity in primates using a novel replication-defective rNTV-based HCV vaccine. Our data suggest that the favored regime for a clinical trial of HCV vaccination would be an rNTV-HCV prime followed by a rAd-HCV boost, which would induce optimal polyfunctional CMI and broad nAbs simultaneously in larger animal species. These data might also have important implications for vaccine development against other persistent infections (such as HIV-1, TB) and cancer.\n\ndates. The genes encoding the Core//E1/E2 proteins (aa1-746) and the non-structural component NS3 (aa1024-1658) of HCV subtype 1b (Hebei strain) were constructed previously. 21, 33, 34 The gene was conventionally subcloned into the poxvirus shuttle vector pJSA1175 derived in our laboratory, which places the insert gene under the control of the vaccinia virus p7.5 promoter and provides flanks for recombination at the TK locus of NTV (Figure 1a) . 21, [35] [36] [37] [38] NTVJTK + \u0394CK, replication-defective Tiantan strain vaccinia virus(NTV) with the CK region deleted (Supplementary Figure S1) , was used as the original virus. 15, 39 Recombinant viruses were isolated following transfection of this plasmid into infected primary chick embryo fibroblasts (day 9 of gestation) by transient dominant selection using LacZ. For immunizations, viruses were amplified in chick embryo fibroblasts, purified over sucrose cushions, and titres with plaque forming unit (pfu) determined twice in duplicate by plaque assay according to standard methods. 21 The same synthetic CE1E2 and C44P (NS3 1201-1456aa /Core 1-34aa ) genes were used for construction of adenovirus vectors. The rAd-CE1E2 genes were prepared as described previously, 21, 33 and the rAd-C44P was constructed using the same strategy. Briefly, the HCV target genes were cloned into the E1 region of the replication-defective adenoviral serotype 5 (rAd5) vector under the control of the hCMV immediateearly promoter-enhancer and the SV40 stop-polyadenylation signal. Both of the rAd-HCV vaccines were rescued and amplified in HEK293 cells. Dosing was based on viral particles (vp), determined by the Maizel spectroscopic method. 40 E1E2(161-746 aa) or NS3 was inserted into the pVRC envelope plasmid (pVRC-E1E2) and transducing plasmid pCS (pCS-NS3). 38 The integration-deficient packaging plasmid pCMV\u0394R8.2D64E, which contained a point mutation in the integrase (D64E) domain of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), [41] [42] [43] was constructed in our laboratory. Three plasmids (pCMV\u0394R8.2D64E, pCS-NS3, pVRC-E1E2) were cotransfected into human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293FT cells using a Fugen HD reagent (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). The HCVpp (Figure 1c ) was harvested 48 hours after transfection, and the virus titre was presented as the HIV p24 antigen concentration determined using the Vironostika HIV-1 Antigen MicroELISA System (BioM\u00e9rieux, Shanghai, China). 38\n\nRhesus macaques were housed at the Laboratory Animal Centre in the Academy of the Military Medical Sciences of the PLA (AMMS). The rhesus macaques consisted of seven females and seven males between 5 and 6 years of age and weighing 4.6-9 kg. The monkeys were assigned to each group in a manner that ensured homogeneous age and body weight distributions. In all cases, the total vaccine dose was suspended in 1 ml of 0.9% NaCl. The macaques were anaesthetized (ketamine), and the vaccines were delivered intramuscularly in 0.5-ml aliquots into both deltoid muscles via tuberculin syringes (Becton-Dickinson, New York, NY). All animal care and treatment was in accordance with standards and was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention (NIVDC) of China, in conformity with national and international laws and policies. The Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare approved the NIVDC's Animal Welfare Assurance (#A2010-028). All animals involved in the studies met the following criteria: in good health, free of known infectious or immunological disease, and no previous contact with a pathogen related to HCV. No animals were sacrificed at the end of the study.\n\nSoluble HCV E1 and E2 proteins were prepared as described previously. 44 Purified E1 and E2 were coated onto 96-well plates (Corning, NY) for ELISA. 33 Core and NS3 antibody titres were determined using a commercial HCV ELISA detection kit (Waitai Biotech, Beijing, China). Each serum sample was diluted serially to determine the antigen-specific endpoint titre, defined as the reciprocal of the last dilution giving an OD >0.1 and more than twice that of the mock serum from each monkey before vaccination. nAb assay. Infectious HCVpps of various genes were produced to evaluate their induction of nAbs. 33, 45, 46 Serially diluted sera after purification using a protein G column were incubated with HCVpps, after which the mixtures were used to infect Huh7 cells. After 48 hours, luciferase activity in infected Huh7 cells was measured using a Bright-Glo Luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI) and a CentroXS luminometer (Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Data were expressed as relative luminescence units (RLUs). The percentage of neutralization was calculated by comparing the luciferase activity in cells infected with HCVpp in the presence of serum from immunized animals with that in cells infected with HCVpp in the presence of pre-immunized serum from the same animal. 11 IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT. Macaque PBMC were isolated from EDTA-treated blood by Ficoll-Paque PLUS (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) density centrifugation and were resuspended in complete media (RPMI 1640, 10% FCS, 2 mmol/l glutamine, 1 mmol/l sodium bicarbonate and 100 \u03bcg/ml penicillin-streptomycin). IFN-\u03b3 ELISpot assay was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions (MabTech, Stockholm, Sweden). Briefly, 2.5 \u00d7 10 5 PBMCs per well were stimulated with the appropriate peptides at a final concentration of 4 \u03bcg/ml into a PVDF membrane-bottomed plate precoated with anti-monkey IFN-\u03b3 capture antibody. Test wells were run using two replicates; a set of negative control wells comprising media only was included on each plate. Pools of 15-mer peptides overlapping by 11 amino acids spanning all HCV target proteins (core, E1, E2, and NS3) were included in the vaccine regimens. 21, 33 After stimulation for 20-36 hours, IFN-\u03b3-spot-forming cells were detected by staining membranes with the detection antibody (7-B6-1-biotin) followed by streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase and development with TMB (3,3' ,5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine) substrate solution. Results are presented as spot-forming cells per 10 6 PBMC. Responses comprising <50 spot-forming cells per 10 6 cells were considered negative and were not evaluated statistically. If determined to be positive, values were reported as the mean of the test wells minus the mean of all negative-control wells.\n\nLuminex assay. PBMCs were stimulated with the same peptide pools used in ELISpot. Cell-free culture supernatants were harvested after 24 and 48 hours of stimulation, and divided into aliquots. IL2, IL12, TNF\u03b1, INF-\u03b3, IL17A, IL4, and IL10 were detected simultaneously using a Procarta Immunoassays kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Aliquots of 50 \u03bcl were combined with coated beads and detected following the directions of the manufacturer. Incubations and washes were performed in 1.2-Am filter membrane, 96-well microtitre plates (Millipore, Billerica, MA) with the help of a MultiScreen vacuum manifold for 96-well plates (Millipore). After the final wash, beads were resuspended in 120-\u03bcl reading buffer and concentrations were read using a Luminex instrument Bio-Plex 200 (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). 47 Statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were performed and graphs plotted using GraphPad Prism, version 5.01 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). Data were log transformed and a one-way or two-way analysis of variance performed; figure legends denote the test performed in each experiment. ELISA end-point titres were normalized by log 10 transformation for analysis. Where appropriate, mean fold changes in ELISA titres, with the 95% CI, are reported. Comparisons of mean immune responses among groups of macaques were performed by the LSD (one-way analysis of variance) or Bonferroni (two-way analysis of variance) test. Correlations were analyzed using Spearman's rank test. Significant differences among groups were evaluated and P values are stated in the figure legends. Figure S1 .
