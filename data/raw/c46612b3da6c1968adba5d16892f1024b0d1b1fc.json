In both cases, IL-6 expression diminished after the 24-h time point, but remained above basal level (Fig. 1A) . led to a 2-fold induction that peaked at 12 h and remained TNF-a mRNA expression was also upregulated in U-at this level (Fig. 1C ). 373MG cells after infection or IFN-g treatment (Fig. 1B) .

Induction of matrix metalloproteinase secretion in reached at 24 h, which then decreased to a stable level of glial cells 1.8 for as long as 72 h. Viral infection caused a steady increase in TNF-a mRNA expression which peaked at Since IL-6 and TNF-a have been reported to increase 2.4-fold at 72 h, and further time points would be required MMP activity (Giraudon et al., 1997), we evaluated the to verify whether this upward trend is maintained (Fig. secretion of MMP-2 and MMP-9 (type IV collagenases) 1B).

While IFN-g caused a steady increase in tively, identified as MMP-2 and pro-MMP-9 gelatinases, MCP-1 levels that reached 3.5-fold at 72 h, viral infection on the basis of their molecular mass and inhibition of activity by EDTA and 1,10-phenanthroline.

Induction of nitric oxide production in glial cells instances, a third band of 82 kDa was observed which corresponds to active MMP-9 cleaved from its latent form, Since nitric oxide (NO) is a pro-inflammatory molecule pro-MMP-9 / 92 kDa. While MMP-2 was constitutively that has been implicated in MS pathology (Bagasra et al., expressed in both glial cell lines, its activity was increased 1995) and astrocytes are the main producers of NO within at 24 h post-infection when compared to untreated cells.\n\nthe CNS (Lee and Brosnan, 1996) , we evaluated NO Both cell lines also expressed MMP-9. Untreated U-production following HCoV infection. Untreated U-373MG astrocytic cells secreted very low levels of pro-373MG astrocytic cells produced an average of 2.4 mM of MMP-9 which were significantly increased at 24 h post-NO at all time points tested (Fig. 3A) , presumably through infection, and a faint digestion site, corresponding to active the constitutive isoform of nitric oxide synthase (cNOS). MMP-9, was detected at 48 h post-infection ( Fig. 2A) .\n\nViral infection led to a 2-fold increase in NO production at Similarly, the CHME-5 microglial cells showed MMP-9 48 h, which was sustained up to 72 h (Fig. 3A) . The secretion and an active form of the enzyme at 48 h (Fig. CHME-5 microglial cells also produced NO but in lower 2B). In order to determine whether increased MMP quantities compared to that produced by U-373MG assecretion was a direct consequence of viral infection or trocytic cells (Fig. 3B) . was due to soluble factors released upon viral infection, culture supernatants from infected cells were used to treat non-infected cells. While the supernatants were non-infec-4. Discussion tious, the kinetics of gelatinase activity was similar to that observed upon HCoV-OC43 infection (data not shown).\n\nWe have shown by semi-quantitative RT-PCR the These results strongly suggest that MMP secretion is upregulation of mRNA expression for IL-6, TNF-a and mediated by soluble factors produced by infected cells.\n\nMCP-1 following HCoV-OC43 infection or IFN-g treatment of astrocytes. Moreover, detection of gelatinase activity by zymography suggested a modulation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity in infected astrocytes and microglia that was mediated by soluble molecules. Finally, nitrite quantification suggested that viral infection of both cell types led to the release of NO, presumably through iNOS activation. Thus, our data clearly show that the expression of pro-inflammatory molecules (cytokines, chemokines, MMPs, and NO) that have been associated with CNS pathologies is increased in glial cells following infection by the OC43 strain of human coronavirus.\n\nAstrocytes are known to be the main producers of IL-6 within the CNS, and its expression can be induced by cytokines such as TNF-a, IL-1b, IFN-g, and TGF-b (Bilzer and Stitz, 1996) . The upregulation of IL-6 mRNA expression observed following HCoV infection was described after Theiler's virus infection of astrocytes (Benveniste, 1998 ). The precise role of IL-6 in CNS pathologies remains unclear since it appears to have both pro-and anti-inflammatory properties through the promotion of leukocyte recruitment by induction of chemokine and adhesion molecules or the downregulation of TNF-a expression and the upregulation of soluble TNF-a receptor and IL-1R antagonist expression (Benveniste, 1998) . Given that IL-6 induction following HCoV infection did not abrogate TNF-a induction in our study, this argues that IL-6 does not repress TNF-a induction in astrocytes. In addition, IL-6 was shown to modulate the expression of MMP and TIMP (tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase; Giraudon et al., 1997) .\n\nInfected U-373MG astrocytic cells showed a gradual relevant to CNS pathologies, given that transgenic mice overexpressing murine TNF-a in the CNS spontaneously enhanced MMP-2 and MMP-9 secretion in infected cells. developed chronic CNS inflammation and treatment with Since MMP-2 can cleave and activate MMP-9, the inanti-murine TNF-a antibody prevented demyelination creased MMP-9 activity might be attributed in part to (Probert et al., 1995) . Moreover, it has been shown that increased MMP-2 expression (Fridman et al., 1995) . TNF-a can cause oligodendrocyte death and myelin dam-Increased activity of MMP-2 was reported in other viral age in vitro (Robbins et al., 1987) . Finally, TNF-a can infections, such as upon exposure to HIV-1 gp41 peptides induce MMP and iNOS expression, which can be harmful (Chong et al., 1998) . Interestingly, we also observed an to CNS cells (Lane et al., 1996; Giraudon et al., 1997) .\n\nupregulation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression in cells The contribution of TNF-a to demyelination remains treated with supernatant derived from infected cells. controversial since it has been reported not to be required MMP synthesis and activity are regulated by gene for the development of EAE (Frei et al., 1997) .\n\ntranscription and translation, secretion, activation, or Expression of the MCP-1 chemokine can be upregulated through inhibitors (Kleiner and Stetler-Stevenson, 1993) . It in CNS pathologies such as MHV-induced neurological would thus appear that HCoV-OC43 infection can influence disease in mice, EAE and MS (Glabinski and Ransohoff, the protease cascade indirectly through cellular factors 1999). Given that astrocytes are the main producers of induced following viral infection, such as IL-6 and TNF-a, MCP-1 within the CNS (Glabinski and Ransohoff, 1999) , as previously reported (Gottschall and Yu, 1995) . It would the increased expression of MCP-1 observed following therefore be of interest to evaluate the effect of these HCoV-OC43 infection might contribute to MS pathology cytokines on MMP secretion and activity in glial cells. It is by promoting leukocyte infiltration into the CNS (Calvo et clear that cytokines and possibly viral proteins can regulate al. , 1996) . Lymphocyte infiltration in the CNS is well the synthesis, secretion and activity of MMPs.

In this\n\nWe have shown increased NO production by infected study, IFN-g led to increased IL-6, TNF-a, and MCP-1 astrocytes and microglia. Observations made in other mRNA expression similar to that observed following laboratories suggest that astrocytes represent the main HCoV infection. It is tempting to speculate that the source of NO in the CNS (Lee and Brosnan, 1996) , which combined effects of viral infection and lymphocyte-derived is consistent with our in vitro results.
