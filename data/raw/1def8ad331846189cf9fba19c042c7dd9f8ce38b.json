This innovation has been highly recommended by the frontline medical staff [5] . By Feb 23, 2020, our hospital had admitted 35 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 233 suspected cases. There have been thousands of person-times of medical staff entering isolation wards, but none developed nosocomial infections. By contrast hospital-related transmission of COVID-19 was recently suspected in up to 29% of health-care workers [6] .\n\nHere our practical experiences and suggestions are discussed.\n\nThe eagle-eyed observer operates at three stages.\n\nBefore medical workers enter isolation wards 1. Measure body temperature, record related information, and instruct them to enter changing room\u2160(Entrance, clean area). After medical workers leave isolation wards 1. Monitor the process of removing PPE by medical staff using a monitoring system, that can identify and correct problems.\n\n2. Measure body temperature, record related information, and instruct staff to leave the isolation wards.\n\n3. Check, replenish, distribute and keep the inventory of PPE to ensure a sufficient supply of equipment.\n\nThe eagle-eyed observers also made some practical suggestions that were adopted.\n\nSpectacle legs of medical staff were tied firmly with elastic ties, and the head band of the protective mask was placed outside the legs of the glasses, to prevent spectacles falling off. Equipment was arranged in the order it was required, and diagrams outlining steps of use were created and displayed. Isolation wards were equipped with automatic disinfectant dispensers and taps. Finally, to improve the observation system, regular video conference between the observer team and medical staff team in the isolation wards were organized.\n\nStaff with abundant infection control experience were preferentially appointed as observers by the Department of Infection Control and Nursing. Observers also received intensive training to become familiar with the requirements for infection control in the isolation wards, and had to pass theoretical and practical tests so that they could truly be described as guardians of medical staff [4] .\n\nIn future, artificial intelligent technologies applied in the eagle-eyed observer system might detect problems earlier and privde automatic warning. Automatic robotic devices for the diagnosis and treatment, nursing care in patients, and goods transfer, medical waste packaging and transportation in the isolation wards may be the development direction.\n\nAdditionally, internet-based real-time monitoring technologies applied in this system can help overcome space l;imitations. Currently, the severe situation in COVID-19 has not been effectively controlled. Our experiences and suggestions on the eagle-eyed observer may be valuable for controlling nosocomial infection of the COVID-19 outbreak and other acute infectious diseases.\n\nNone."}
