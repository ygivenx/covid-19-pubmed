In a multivariate regression model that included these predictors, older age and elevated LDH were independent risk factors for fatality (Table S3 ). Twenty-one survivors and 11 non-survivors had CT scans within the first week. We used severity score to quantify the extent of lung opacification as described in the\n\nKaiyan Li, Dian Chen, Shengchong Chen, Yuchen Feng, Chenli Chang, Zi Wang, Nan Wang, Guohua Zhen Table of Table S1 .

The study included all patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to a quarantine unit of Tongji Hospital, a large regional hospital in Wuhan, China, between January 31 and March 5, 2020. COVID-19 patients were diagnosed according to World Health Organization (WHO) interim guideline 1 . Confirmed cases were defined by the positive findings in reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chainreaction (RT-PCR) assay of throat swab specimens. Clinical characteristics, laboratory test results, and treatment information were extracted from electronic medical records.\n\nAll laboratory testing and radiological examination were performed according to the clinical care needs of the patient.\n\nThroat swab specimens were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using real-time RT-PCR according to the WHO protocol 3 . The following primers and probes were used for realtime RT-PCR detection of N gene of SARS-CoV-2: N forward primer 5'-\n\nPositive results were confirmed in two independent real-time RT-PCR assays.\n\nHigh-resolution transverse CT images were obtained using Optima 660 (GE Medical All rights reserved.

Tube voltage was 100 or 120 kV, and automatic tube current modulation was 100 -400 mA. All images were reconstructed with a slice thickness of 1.0mm or 1.25mm. The CT images were reviewed by two radiologists (ZW and NW) who were blinded to the final outcome of the patients. Images were reviewed independently. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion and consensus.\n\nA scoring system was used to estimate the extent of lung opacification based on the area involved 2 . Each of the five lung lobes was visually scored from 0 to 5 as: 0, no involvement; 1, < 5% involvement; 2, 5% -25% involvement; 3, 26% -49% involvement; 4, 50% -75% involvement; 5, > 75% involvement. The total severity score was the sum of scores of each lobe, ranging from 0 (no involvement) to 25 (maximum involvement).\n\nStatistical analysis was done with SPSS Statistics Software (version 26; IBM, New York, USA). Continuous variables were presented as median (IQR) and analyzed using Mann-Whitney U test; categorical variables were presented as number (%) and analyzed by \u03c7\u00b2 test or Fisher's exact test between survivors and non-survivors where appropriate. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios and the 95% confidence intervals of the risk factors associated with fatal outcome. A two-sided \u03b1 of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\nAll rights reserved.
