{"title": "Frameshifting RNA Pseudoknots: Structure and Mechanism", "body": "Ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules adopt tertiary structures of rich complexity and functional diversity (Holbrook, 2005) . In messenger RNAs, 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs) posttranscriptionally control gene expression by regulating RNA processing and translation initiation (Jenner et al., 2005) . 5\u2032 UTRs also fold into metabolite-sensing RNA elements termed riboswitches that recognize specific metabolites and thereby regulate transcription termination/ Wakeman et al., 2007; Winkler et al., 2002) .\n\nSince its discovery in the 3\u2032 ends of certain plant viral genomic RNAs by the Dutch groups of Pleij, Rietveld and Bosch in the early to mid-1980s (Pleij et al., 1985; Rietveld et al., 1984; Rietveld et al., 1983) and subsequent NMR structural characterization (Kolk et al., 1998) , the RNA pseudoknot is now recognized as a ubiquitous folding topology that performs a wide range of functions in biology. RNA pseudoknotting is found in both naturally occurring and in vitro evolved RNA catalysts or ribozymes (Cate et al., 1996; Ferre-D'Amare et al., 1998; Serganov et al., 2005) , as well as in many complex folded RNAs and ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs) including the ribosome and telomerase. Here, pseudoknots play a critical structural or scaffolding role in bringing distant regions of single-stranded RNA together in order to form core helices composed of Watson-Crick base pairs (Adams et al., 2004; Brodersen et al., 2002; Golden et al., 2005; Theimer et al., 2005; Torres-Larios et al., 2006) . In addition, pseudoknots are known to play important regulatory roles in translation initiation at internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs) (Otto and Puglisi, 2004; Pfingsten et al., 2006; Pfingsten et al., 2007) , in autoregulation of translation initiation (ten Dam et al., 1992; Deckman et al., 1987) and in metabolite sensing RNAs , where the ribosome binding sequence may be sequestered in a pseudoknotted structure (Gilbert et al., 2008) . During translation elongation, the pseudoknot-containing transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA) mediates rescue of stalled ribosomes that reach the 3\u2032 end of an mRNA lacking a termination codon (Haebel et al., 2004; Moore and Sauer, 2007; Nonin-Lecomte et al., 2006) . When found within the coding region of messenger RNA itself, pseudoknots are known to stimulate the efficiency of a number of programmed translational recoding events (Baranov et al., 2002) , including stop codon redefinition and ribosomal frameshifting (Farabaugh, 1996; . The subject of this review is RNA pseudoknots and related RNA motifs that simulate \u22121 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (\u22121 PRF).\n\nAn important goal of these studies is to elucidate inter-relationships between pseudoknot structure, stability, dynamics and folding kinetics, and how they govern the ability of this deceptively simple motif to stimulate \u22121 frameshifting during ribosomal translocation. Recent cryo-electron microscopy studies of a putative translocation intermediate stalled over a frameshift site , mechanical unfolding studies of RNA pseudoknots (Green et al., 2008; Hansen et al., 2007) , and NMR structural and thermodynamic studies of a family of evolutionarily closely related frameshifting pseudoknots from plants (Cornish and Giedroc, 2006; Cornish et al., 2005; Cornish et al., 2006b) support the hypothesis that the ability of a frameshift-stimulating pseudoknot to resist the force of mechanical unwinding by the ribosomal mRNA helicase (Takyar et al., 2005) may be more strongly correlated with frameshift stimulation, rather than a specific or unique structural feature(s). This review will summarize these data and place them in the context of our maturing understanding of translation elongation (Wen et al., 2008) . The reader is also referred to reviews on RNA pseudoknot structure and function in ribosomal frameshifting and RNA virus replication that have recently appeared (Brierley and Dos Ramos, 2006; Brierley et al., 2007; Staple and Butcher, 2005a ).\n\nAn RNA pseudoknot is a simple folding topology that is formed when nucleotides within a single-stranded loop base pair with complementary nucleotides outside of that loop ( Fig. 1 ) (ten Dam et al., 1992; ten Dam et al., 1995) . If this new base pairing originates with nucleotides within an RNA hairpin loop, the topology is referred to as an H (hairpin)-type pseudoknot, forming a structure composed of two helical stems, S1 and S2, and two non-equivalent loops, L1 and L2 ( Fig. 1) . Loop L1 crosses the deep major groove of the lower stem S2, while loop L2 crosses the minor groove side of stem S1. The pseudoknot-forming stem is S2, with S1 considered the hairpin stem. Some H-type pseudoknots contain a third loop (denoted here as L3), often a single unpaired nucleotide, that interrupts the continuous strand at the helical junction; this base can either be extruded from the helix (Egli et al., 2002; Nixon et al., 2002b) or intercalated between the two helical elements . Note that two conventions currently exist for the loop-stem nomenclature of hairpin-type pseudoknots that conform to this basic architecture, in which the designations of L2 and L3 are reversed, and are instead identified in order of appearance in the nucleotide sequence (Brierley et al., 2007) . In this case, L2 is the loop found at the helical junction between S1 and S2, and L3 is the long loop that straddles the minor groove of the upper stem S1. In this review, we conform to the first convention.\n\nIt has long been known that specific regulatory signals in the mRNA can influence the speed and fidelity of ribosomal decoding. For example, elongating ribosomes pause or slow down upon encountering classical secondary structures and this ribosomal pausing is often associated with ribosomal recoding events (Baranov et al., 2002) . One such recoding event is frameshifting, when the ribosome is directed to move into the \u22121, +1 or +2 reading frames from the reference \"0\" frame (Harger et al., 2002; Stahl et al., 2002) . Programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) allows for translation of two proteins encoded in overlapping reading frames from a single translation initiation site upstream of the 5\u2032 open reading frame ( Fig. 2A) .\n\n\u22121 PRF has been documented to occur in bacteria (Tsuchihashi and Kornberg, 1990) , yeast (Dinman et al., 1991) and mammals (Clark et al., 2007; Manktelow et al., 2005; Wills et al., 2006) ; however, the process is particularly exploited by RNA viruses from plants and animals, including HIV-1 and related retroviruses and coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV (Brierley and Dos Ramos, 2006) . The efficiency of \u22121 PRF is not 100%, but instead dictates the molar ratio of downstream and upstream proteins ultimately present in the assembling virus. In HIV-1, this ratio is tightly regulated by the virus; molecules that alter the frameshifting levels have significant effects on virus propagation and infectivity (Biswas et al., 2004) ; in addition, it is known that changing the frameshifting efficiency downward induces results in significantly lower infectivities in both HIV-1 (Dulude et al., 2006) and in murine Moloney leukemia virus, where the translational readthrough signal was replaced with the frameshifting signal from HIV-1 (Gendron et al., 2005) . This, in turn has motivated efforts to develop tightly binding molecules as a potential anti-viral strategy (Biswas et al., 2004; Dulude et al., 2008; Park et al., 2008) .\n\nTwo mRNA-encoded signals are required for stimulation of efficient frameshifting by an elongating ribosome. One is a heptanucleotide \"slippery site\" of the general sequence X XXY YYZ over which the ribosome pauses, e.g., G GGA AAC in pea enation mosaic virus-1 (PEMV-1) (Nixon et al., 2002b) , and a downstream RNA pseudoknot, positioned 6-8 nucleotides from the 3\u2032 edge of the slip-site (Fig. 2B) (Brierley, 1995) . The slip-site alone dramatically increases the intrinsic level of frameshift errors from 0.00005 to \u22480.005 per codon depending strongly on the sequence (Stahl et al., 2002) , with the pseudoknot further stimulating this process 10-to 30-fold more. Thus, the pseudoknot induces a subtle, yet critical, perturbation in the kinetic partitioning of the translocating ribosome into the \u22121 frame from the reference frame (see below). In nearly every case that has been examined in detail, a downstream H-type pseudoknot is the stimulatory element. A prominent exception to the pseudoknot as the downstream stimulator is in lentiviruses HIV-1 and SIV, where a bipartite stem-loop structure appears necessary and sufficient to stimulate \u22121 PRF at the gag-pol junction (Gaudin et al., 2005; Marcheschi et al., 2007; Staple and Butcher, 2005b) . This may be facilitated by the slippery sequence itself, which is UUUUUUA, a particularly shifty sequence (Brierley et al., 1992) .\n\nAlthough essentially all of the atomic resolution structural information that is currently available for the translating ribosome comes from studies of the bacterial ribosome, it is widely believed that the fundamental features of protein synthesis are evolutionarily conserved from prokaryotes to eukaryotes since the core ribosome structure shows a high degree of conservation (Spahn et al., 2001) . For the HIV-1 frameshift signal at least, the bacterial ribosome appears to be fully functional as the eukaryotic ribosome in stimulating frameshifting (Leger et al., 2004) . Thus, it is of interest to consider the structure and dynamics (see section 5 below) of the bacterial 70S ribosome in some detail. Several recent x-ray crystallographic structures of the intact 70S bacterial ribosome either unliganded (Schuwirth et al., 2005) or with various ligands bound (Jenner et al., 2005; Korostelev et al., 2006; Selmer et al., 2006) provide an opportunity to consider \u22121 PRF at the atomic level. These structures along with the previous T. thermophilus 70S structure with bound mRNA, and all three tRNAs to modest (3.9-5.5 \u00c5) resolution in initiation and post-initiation complexes (Jenner et al., 2007; Yusupova et al., 2006; Yusupova et al., 2001) clearly define the path of the mRNA as it threads through the head and platform of the 30S subunit (shaded purple in the initiation complex, Fig. 3 ). They reveal that the relatively short spacer between the slip-site and the pseudoknot places the pseudoknot in direct contact with the mRNA entry channel of the elongating ribosome, as previously modeled Plant et al., 2003) . The mRNA channel is clearly defined and is contained totally within the 30S subunit, between the head and body, lined with ribosomal proteins S3, S4 and S5 (Fig. 4A ) (Brodersen et al., 2002) . Recent biochemical experiments reveal that the 70S ribosome has helicase activity (Takyar et al., 2005) , which may function by passively trapping transiently unfolded secondary structure by dsRNA binding protein S5; alternatively, the S3/S4/S5 proteins might function as a processivity clamp (Jeruzalmi et al., 2002) positioned at the entrance to the mRNA tunnel (Fig. 4B ).\n\nThe atomic (2.8 \u00c5) resolution model of the pre-translocation complex containing bound mRNA, deacylated initiator tRNA fMet in the P-site, aminoacyl tRNA Phe in the A-site and noncognate tRNA in the E-site (Selmer et al., 2006) reveals two additional details that likely enable the elongating ribosome to maintain the reading frame. First, the kink in the mRNA between the A-and P-site codons is stabilized by a bound Mg 2+ (shaded green, Fig. 4A ). This Mg 2+ ion forms outer sphere coordination bonds with the phosphate oxygens of adjacent nucleotides that define the P-and A-site codon boundaries, as well as nucleotides 1401 and 1402 of helix 44 of the 16S RNA (Fig. 4A ). These interactions effectively auger the mRNA frame relative to the 30S subunit and may well prevent translation slippage during normal decoding. Secondly, the junction between the D-and anticodon stems of the deacylated P-site tRNA is distorted or kinked toward the A-site (see also (Korostelev et al., 2006) ; relaxation of this deformation may help drive this tRNA into the E-site upon translocation. To prevent this from happening prematurely, there seems to be a molecular \"gate\" (Fig. 4B ) formed by A-minor hydrogen bonding interactions to the P-site tRNA from the 30S head and platform wedged between the P-and E-site tRNAs (Fig. 4B ).\n\nIt is noteworthy that despite the fact that the E-site tRNA was stably bound to the ribosome in this pre-translocation model, there are no E-site codon-anticodon base pairing interactions in the structure (Selmer et al., 2006) , a finding that differs from what was observed in a postinitiation model at 3.7 \u00c5 (Jenner et al., 2007) . In this structure, one of the E-site codon nucleotides appears to base pair with the E-site tRNA anticodon. This finding supports the idea that during translation, the tRNAs move with the mRNA while maintaining codon-anticodon hydrogen bonding for all three tRNAs, although this has not yet been fully established (Feinberg and Joseph, 2001) . In any case, this structure might reflect an intermediate state just prior to base pair dissociation and finally release of the deacylated E-site tRNA. These findings would appear to be relevant for understanding \u22121 PRF since it has recently been shown that mutations in the E-site codon alter the efficiency of \u22121 PRF at least in the context of the HIV-1 frameshift signal; furthermore mutations in 16S ribosomal RNA that influence HIV-1 frameshifting efficiency map to helices 21 and 22 in the E. coli ribosome, a region previously implicated in translocation and E-site tRNA anticodon binding (Leger et al., 2007) . Mutations in this region also influence translocation and in many cases give rise to spontaneous frameshifts (Sergiev et al., 2005) . Nonetheless, it remains unclear at this point what precise role the E-site tRNA might play in frameshifting since there is still controversy as to when the E site tRNA exits the ribosome (Dinos et al., 2005; Spiegel et al., 2007) .\n\nVarious frameshifting models have been presented that attempt to pinpoint the exact step in a translocation cycle where frameshifting occurs (Harger et al., 2002; Jacks et al., 1988; Leger et al., 2007; Plant et al., 2003) . To consider these models, we outline the basic steps of a translational elongation cycle in the context of a ribosome encountering an RNA pseudoknot during decoding ( Fig. 5 ) (Joseph, 2003; Moazed and Noller, 1989) . During active translation, a ribosome with a vacant A-site accepts a cognate amino-acylated tRNA delivered as a complex with EF-Tu\u2022GTP (eEF1A\u2022GTP in eukaryotes). Almost immediately, the peptide on the P-site tRNA is transferred to the fully accommodated A-site aminoacylated tRNA in a reaction catalyzed by the peptidyl transfer center on the large subunit (50S in bacteria; 60S in eukaryotes). Subsequently, the tRNA acceptor ends translocate on the 50S (60S) subunit resulting in a P/E-A/P hybrid state of the ribosome (Dorner et al., 2006; Moazed and Noller, 1989) . EF-G\u2022GTP (eEF2\u2022GTP in eukaryotes) then binds to the ribosome and drives 30S (40S) translocation returning the ribosome to the classical P/P-E/E state with a vacant A-site. Regardless of which mRNA codons are present in the P and A sites of the ribosome, there are only three places in an elongation cycle that a ribosome can frameshift: during accommodation (step 2, Fig. 5 ), during or immediately following 50S translocation to form the hybrid state (step 3), or during 30S translocation to return to classical state (step 4). It is also possible in fact that \u22121 PRF is capable of occurring at all of these steps, with the precise mechanism perhaps dictated by the frameshifting signal itself.\n\nCloser inspection of each step of the elongation process from recent biochemical, bulk and single molecule experiments clearly reveals that the elongating ribosome is a dynamic machine; this in turn, has clear implications for any proposed mechanisms of \u22121 PRF. Recent structures of the bacterial ribosome obtained by cryo-electron microscopy prepared in different stages of the translation elongation cycle reveal that the ribosome can adopt at least two different conformations, in which the small subunit is oriented differently relative to the large subunit (Frank and Agrawal, 2000; Gao et al., 2003; Valle et al., 2003) . Subsequent single molecule experiments have shown that the bound tRNAs in the pretranslocation state (pre-30S translocation, see Fig. 5 ) are conformationally dynamic (Blanchard et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2007; Munro et al., 2007) . More recently, bacterial ribosomes assembled from subunits specifically labeled with fluorescent probes have been shown to spontaneously fluctuate between two states when prepared in either a pretranslocation state or with a single deacyl-tRNA bound in the P-site and prefer the rotated or hybrid state (Cornish et al., 2008) . Upon addition of EF-G and the non-hydrolyzable analogue GDPNP, the ribosomes were further stabilized in a rotated or hybrid state (Cornish et al., 2008; . In contrast, when these ribosomes lacked tRNA or contained a peptidyl-tRNA in the P-site of the ribosome, i.e., in a pre-50S translocation state (see Fig. 5 ), the non-rotated or classical state was favored and the dynamic rotational movement of the ribosome was strongly hindered (Cornish et al., 2008) .\n\nWhat does a dynamic ribosome have to do with frameshifting? Since error-free translation likely requires that the A and P site tRNAs maintain hydrogen bonding contact with the mRNA during both 50S and 30S translocation, at some point in an elongation cycle with the paused ribosome positioned over the slip-site, these interactions must be broken for frameshifting to occur (Fig. 5) . The above studies suggest that the ribosome is most dynamic in the pre-30S (40S) translocation state, i.e., during 50S (60S) translocation or when the ribosome adopts the hybrid state (see Fig. 5 ). Indeed, a recent study suggests that the tRNA and mRNA interactions with the ribosome are weakened to the point where a change in reading frame, albeit in the 3\u2032 direction, could readily occur provided the translocating tRNA lacks a peptidyl group and a degenerate codon for repairing by the deacylated P-site is available (McGarry et al., 2005) . Another study showed that addition of EF-G\u2022GDPNP further stabilizes the hybrid P/E state allowing for destabilization of the P-site codon-anticodon hydrogen bonding interactions . This is interesting since some tRNAs are known to favor the hybrid state of the ribosome more than others (Cornish et al., 2008; Dorner et al., 2006; Spiegel et al., 2007; Studer et al., 2003) ; this suggests that different tRNAs may have different propensities to frameshift based on their propensity to form the hybrid conformational state.\n\nThe sequence of the heptanucleotide slip-site in a \u22121 PRF signal is such that during repairing of the P-and A-site tRNAs in the new \u22121 reading frame, only the wobble codon-anticodon interaction is changed (\"0\" frame: X XXY YYZ to \"\u22121\" frame: XXX YYY Z) (see Fig. 2B ) (Brierley et al., 1992) . As a result, the new \u22121 reading frame provides near cognate repairing partners for the bound tRNAs. This suggests that the total free energy of codon-anticodon formation of the \u22121 frame will be comparable to that of the reference frame. Since frameshifting does in fact occur over such a sequence, but happens infrequently, a sizable transition state energy barrier to shifting reading frames must be present (see Fig. 4A ). A downstream secondary structural element could therefore function by lowering this energy barrier, either by playing an active (mechanical) or passive role in this process.\n\nA mechanical model of frameshift stimulation hypothesizes that the downstream pseudoknot functions as a kinetic barrier to normal translocation, and in so doing, lowers the energy barrier to tRNA-mRNA repairing. It can be imagined that this kinetic barrier would come into play either during spontaneous hybrid states formation (Cornish et al., 2008 ) (50S translocation) and/or during EF-G\u2022GTP driven translocation (30S translocation) (see Fig. 5 ) . In both cases, movement of the ribosomal subunits may cause tension to build up in the mRNA strand due to the downstream structural element positioned in the mRNA entry channel. This tension could then be released via \u22121 PRF (Plant et al., 2003) . Consistent with these models, prior studies have demonstrated that tRNAs can translocate on the ribosome in the absence of an mRNA (Belistina 1981 , Belistina 1982 . Alternatively, the downstream RNA element may function simply as a passive barrier, by pausing the ribosome over the slippery sequence for a time sufficient for repairing to occur, as the ribosomal helicase attempts to unwind whatever secondary structure is present in the mRNA entry channel (Takyar et al., 2005) . However, such a model would appear to be inconsistent with biochemical experiments that suggested that pausing is necessary (Lopinski et al., 2000) but not sufficient to induce \u22121 PRF (Kontos et al., 2001; Tu et al., 1992) . It is also plausible that the paused ribosome may actually be in equilibrium between the XXY YYZ and XXX YYY reading frame states while in the hybrid state (see Fig. 5 ). The binding of EF-G\u2022GTP to the ribosome would then trap the ribosome in one of the two reading frames prior to 30S (40S) translocation and a return to the classical state. In this context, it would be of interest to investigate the influence of a downstream structural element(s) on hybrid states formation by the translating ribosome. In any event, these studies taken collectively make it most likely that tRNA-mRNA codonanticodon interactions are broken when the ribosome is in the hybrid conformational state.\n\nBrierley and coworkers have recently used cryo-electron microscopy to image mammalian 80S ribosomes (to \u224816 \u00c5) paused over the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) pp1a/pp1b pseudoknot frameshift signal (Fig. 6A ) . Although solved at low resolution, these reconstructions reveal several significant features. Firstly, as expected , the pseudoknot lies at the entrance to the mRNA channel apparently making direct contact with elements of the putative ribosomal helicase, including rpos3 (bacterial S3), 16S helix 16, rpS9 (S4) and rpS2 (S5), as well as the ribosome regulatory protein RACK1 (Fig.  6B ). More importantly, this structure contains eEF2 trapped in the A-site, with the D-helix of the P-site tRNA strongly bent, relative to control reconstructions with a non-frameshiftstimulating stem-loop RNA. Thus, the movement of the tRNA through the ribosome during translocation appears to be prevented by the inability of the ribosome to unwind the pseudoknot, and blockage of the A-site mRNA codon by eEF2. The P-site tRNA strongly bends toward the 3\u2032 direction (or A-site codon) (Fig. 6B ) more so than in the structures above Selmer et al., 2006) thought to be due to the opposing forces of translocation and the pseudoknot plug. At some frequency, the P-site tRNA unpairs and repairs in the new \u22121 frame (in the 5\u2032 direction), a proposal consistent with a major role of specifically the P-site tRNA in this process (Baranov et al., 2004) . After this time, the tension built up in the mRNA is relaxed, and the incoming aminoacylated tRNA is delivered to the A-site in the new \u22121 reading frame (Fig. 6C ).\n\nThis structure would seem to pinpoint the 30S (40S) translocation step in the elongation cycle (see Fig. 5 ) where ribosomes shift into the \u22121 reading frame; however, the low resolution of the structure makes this difficult to claim with certainty. Since both eEF2 and a P-site tRNA are bound, this suggests that the ribosome is in the hybrid conformation state, a state that would be favored with a deacylated tRNA in the P-site . At 16 \u00c5 resolution, however, it is not clear if the P-site tRNA observed in the structure is deacylated, nor can it be determined what reading frame the mRNA is actually in. On the other hand, the clearly-defined electron density observed for the pseudoknot strongly suggests that the pseudoknot is largely folded as the ribosome shifts reading frames. The hypothesis that emerges from this work is that the ability of the downstream pseudoknot to actively lower the energy barrier for unpairing of the P-site codon-anticodon interaction will be more strongly correlated with frameshift stimulation. By extension, RNA motifs more capable of resisting the force of ribosomal helicase-mediated unwinding and eEF2 (EF-G)-catalyzed translocation will thus be more efficient frameshift stimulators. The structural data summarized here further suggests that the helical junction in at least one class of frameshifting pseudoknots is a \"hot-spot\" or positive determinant for frameshift stimulation (Cornish et al., 2005) .\n\nA strikingly diverse array of RNA motifs are capable of stimulating \u22121 PRF when placed \u22486-8 nucleotides downstream of the heptanucleotide slippery sequence or \"slip-site\" (see Fig. 7 ). The known structures, schematically illustrated as secondary structure diagrams in Fig. 7 , can be divided roughly into two groups. The first group is comprised of standard hairpin-type pseudoknots that conform to the overall architecture illustrated in Fig. 1 . Pseudoknotted motifs that stimulate \u22121 PRF can thus far be further subdivided into three distinct structural classes and include the coronaviral (IBV-type), retroviral gag-pro and luteoviral P1-P2 frameshift stimulators . These differ primarily in the distinct functional requirements of the stem and loop lengths within these signals, to be discussed in more detail below.\n\nThe second group contains all other motifs, including the very stable stem-loop structures known to stimulate \u22121 frameshifting at the gag-pol junctions in HIV-1 and related lentiviruses (Marcheschi et al., 2007; Staple and Butcher, 2005b) , as well as the three-stemmed pseudoknot of the frameshift signal positioned between ORFs pp1a and pp1b of the replicase polyprotein (pp) precursor in the SARS coronavirus genome (Baranov et al., 2005; Plant et al., 2005) . Note that this latter motif can be thought of an H-type pseudoknot that contains an additional stemloop embedded in the standard loop L2. Although a structure of the SARS-CoV signal is not yet available, many of the proposed base pairs predicted to form in each of the three helical stems have been confirmed by NMR methods (Plant et al., 2005) . Disruption or deletion of stem S3 has only a small influence on frameshift stimulation in vitro (Plant et al., 2005) ; this finding is consistent with the fact that this helix can also be deleted from the well-studied pp1a-pp1b pseudoknot from the distantly related group 3 coronavirus, avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) (Brierley et al., 1989; Napthine et al., 1999) . Interestingly, the P1-P2 pseudoknot from the luteovirus barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) is a variation on the SARS-CoV pseudoknot structure, but contains a loop L2 of nearly 4 kb, with S2 formed by long-range base pairing with nucleotides near the 3\u2032 end of the genome (Paul et al., 2001) ; this provides an elegant mechanism to coordinate translation of the replicase gene and negative strand RNA synthesis (Barry and Miller, 2002) . Finally, a number of antisense nucleic acids have also been shown to stimulate ribosomal frameshifting in vitro (Howard et al., 2004; Olsthoorn et al., 2004) . Although these duplexes bear some resemblance to the simple stem-loops known to stimulate \u22121 PRF in lentiviruses (see Fig. 7 ), their mechanism of action is not known.\n\nAlthough early investigations of the frameshifting signal from the retrovirus Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) clearly established \u22121 PRF as an event programmed by the mRNA sequence and required to express the downstream pol or pro ORF gene products in retroviruses (Jacks et al., 1988; Jacks and Varmus, 1985) , the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) gag-pro frameshift stimulating pseudoknot was the first such \u22121 PRF stimulatory RNA element investigated in considerable detail as to its solution structure and functional requirements Chen et al., 1995; Chen et al., 1996; Jacks et al., 1987; Shen and Tinoco, 1995) . As such, the MMTV pseudoknot has long provided a basis of comparison with all \u22121 PRF stimulating RNA motifs subsequently discovered and characterized (for a review, see Giedroc et al., 2000) . These include the coronaviral pp1a-pp1b signals characterized first in avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) nearly coincidently with the RSV and MMTV gag-pro signals (Brierley et al., 1987; Brierley et al., 1989; Brierley et al., 1991) , followed by other structurally characterized retroviral gag-pol and gag-pro signals, most notably that from HIV-1 and the simian retrovirus-1, SRV-1 (Du et al., 1997; Michiels et al., 2001; ten Dam et al., 1994; ten Dam et al., 1995) . The pseudoknot derived from the P1-P2 junction from beet western yellows virus (BWYV) (Egli et al., 2002; Kim et al., 1999; Su et al., 1999 ) from a family of viruses collectively called Luteoviridae, followed shortly thereafter, with structures of three additional luteoviral pseudoknots reported thereafter solved using either NMR (Cornish et al., 2005; Nixon et al., 2002b) or crystallographic (Pallan et al., 2005) methods.\n\nAlthough an atomic structure of the minimal IBV pp1a/pp1b pseudoknot remains unavailable twenty years after its discovery (Brierley et al., 1987) , the major functional requirements of the IBV frameshifting signal relative to the retroviral-type gag-pro pseudoknot from MMTV could be deduced from mutational studies (Chen et al., 1995; Liphardt et al., 1999; Napthine et al., 1999) . The major difference was in the length of the stem S1 (Fig. 7) , with 11 bp, or one turn of A-form helix, clearly optimal for the IBV pseudoknot vs. 5-6 bp in the MMTV gag-pro pseudoknot. Remarkably, a 10-bp stem S1 induces a dramatic \u22487 fold decrease in frameshift stimulation (46% to 7%) in the IBV pseudoknot, while shorter S1 stems are effectively inactive in promoting frameshifting in this context . Structural features specific to the MMTV pseudoknot include an unpaired adenosine (A14) that is wedged between the two stems (pseudoknot loop L3; see Figs. 1 and 8A) thereby creating a bent structure that prevents coaxial stacking of the helical stems, as well as a number of loop L2-stem S1 interactions . The presence of this \"wedge\" adenosine is strongly positively correlated with frameshift stimulation since deletion of the nucleotide reduces frameshifting efficiencies to low levels . Atkins and coworkers have made a similar finding in a retroviral-type frameshifter found in the human gene Ma3 (Wills et al., 2006) . Thermodynamic studies reveal that the unpaired adenosine is globally stabilizing in the gag-pro pseudoknots from MMTV and mouse intercisternal A-type particle (mIAP), but by just \u22480.5 kcal\u2022mol \u22121 (37 \u00baC) (Theimer and Giedroc, 1999; Theimer and Giedroc, 2000) .\n\nIn a series of mutational experiments, was able to convert a functionally inactive IBV pseudoknot with 6 bps in stem S1 and 8 nucleotides in loop L2, by simply adding an unpaired and presumably intercalated adenosine at the helical junction, and an adenosine in the 3\u2032 terminal position of loop L2, i.e., features that mimic those found in the MMTV gagpro pseudoknot. These findings argue strongly for two distinct structural classes of frameshifting pseudoknots, one with a full helical turn of stem S1 and few other obvious structural requirements, and one with a much shorter stem S1 that seemed to require favorable interactions at the helical junction region to mediate high levels of frameshift stimulation. Subsequent structural studies with the gag-pro signal from SRV-1 further suggested that it was not the bent conformation of the retroviral gag-pro pseudoknot that was positively correlated with frameshifting since this structure is characterized by coaxially stacked S1 and S2 helices, but rather favorable loop L2-stem S1 interactions, a subset of which are found in the helical junction region (see Fig. 8B ) (Michiels et al., 2001) .\n\nIn contrast to the pseudoknotted motifs discussed above, it is now well-established that the frameshift stimulators found at the gag-pol junctions in lentiviruses HIV-1 and SIV are simple RNA stem-loops (see Fig. 8C , D) (Gaudin et al., 2005; Marcheschi et al., 2007; Staple and Butcher, 2005b) . Each is characterized by an 11-bp helical stem and a highly ordered hairpin loop. The HIV-1 stem-loop contains an ACAA tetraloop characterized by an A20-A23 hydrogen bond, while the 12-nucleotide SIV/HIV-2 loop incorporates a sheared G28-A39 base pair, a cross-strand adenosine stack formed by A29 and A38, two G-C base pairs, and a novel CYC triloop turn sequence (Fig. 8D) . Each loop is characterized by multiple hydrogen bonding interactions that stabilize the overall structure (see Figs. 8C and D) (Marcheschi et al., 2007; Staple and Butcher, 2005b) and as such, are predicted to preclude base pairing with the adjacent 3\u2032 region that would be required to form a pseudoknot, as proposed previously for HIV-1 . Both the HIV-1 and SIV signals also contain a lower, more dynamic stem (shaded yellow in the HIV-1 RNA, Fig. 8C ) that when base paired comes closer to the 3\u2032 edge of the slippery sequence than do the downstream pseudoknots in other systems (see Fig.  7 ) (Marcheschi et al., 2007) ; in HIV-1, these two helical stems are interrupted by an asymmetric three-nucleotide G35-G36-A37 bulge (Fig. 8C) . Since the lower stem in both HIV-1 and SIV RNAs will be unfolded when the ribosome is positioned over the slippery signal, its function in unclear. In HIV-1, it has been hypothesized that the lower stem functions as a \"positioning element\" that allows the stem-loop to induce ribosomal pausing which in turn mediates a translocation perturbation; how this occurs at the molecular level is unknown (Staple and Butcher, 2005b) . It is also intriguing that the both HIV-1 and SIV/HIV-2 stem-loop structures, like stem S1 in the IBV pp1a-pp1b pseudoknot, are 11 bp in length, perhaps suggesting a similar mechanism of frameshift stimulation, but potentially enhanced by a very slippery UUUUUUA slip-site (Brierley et al., 1992) .\n\nThe atomic resolution (1.6 \u00c5) crystallographic structure of the 28-nucleotide P1-P2 pseudoknot from beet western yellows virus (BWYV) clearly established how RNA pseudoknots with a very short 3-bp pseudoknot-forming stem S2 could fold and stimulate \u22121 PRF to a level of 5-15% (Fig. 9A ). This RNA is compact and adopts a largely triple-stranded conformation, with many of the loop nucleotides making non-canonical base-base and basesugar edge hydrogen bonds with base pairs in each of the two stems. For example, a protonated C8+ from loop L1 forms a standard Hoogsteen-type base pair with an accepting G12 as part of a C8+\u2022(G12-C26) base triple positioned at the \"top\" of the S2 helical junction (Fig. 9A) . Thermodynamic and structural studies of three other luteoviral RNA pseudoknots confirm that this C+\u2022(C-G) major groove triple base pair is a common feature of all luteoviral RNA pseudoknots (see Fig. 9B -D) (Nixon et al., 2002a; Nixon and Giedroc, 2000) , protonation of which is strongly stabilizing. The degree to which protonation of this cytidine affects frameshifting efficiency or mechanical stability (Tinoco et al., 2006) remains unknown.\n\nThe other striking feature of the BWYV pseudoknot is a minor groove triplex, in which a run of three consecutive adenosines at the 3\u2032 end of the loop L2 form a series of Watson-Cricksugar edge hydrogen bonding interactions with lower base pairs of the upper stem S1 (see Fig.  9A ) . While reminiscent of classical A-minor interactions found in other complex RNAs and the large ribosomal subunit (Doherty et al., 2001; Nissen et al., 2001) , these interactions are characterized by direct adenosine N1-2\u2032OH hydrogen bonding interactions, many of which could be directly detected in solution using NMR methods on related luteoviral pseudoknots (Cornish et al., 2006a; Cornish et al., 2005; Giedroc et al., 2003; Nixon et al., 2002b ) (see below). Other distinct L2-S1 hydrogen bonding interactions are found further from the helical junction in all luteoviral RNAs but these tend to be somewhat unique to individual RNAs. Figure 9B -D compares the structures of three other luteoviral P1-P2 frameshifting pseudoknots to that from BWYV (Fig. 9A) (Egli et al., 2002; Su et al., 1999) . These include a solution structure of the frameshifting signal from RNA-1 of the enamovirus pea enation mosaic virus (PEMV-1) originally reported in 2002 (Nixon et al., 2002b) with the refined structure presented here (see Table 1 for refinement statistics), a crystallographic structure of the \"minimal\" 22nucleotide pseudoknot from potato leaf roll virus (PLRV) (Pallan et al., 2005) and a solution structure of the frameshifting motif from sugar cane yellow leaf virus (ScYLV) (Cornish et al., 2005) . Fig. 10A shows full and backbone ribbon representations of a global superposition of the 28 lowest energy structures of the PEMV-1 RNA, while Fig. 10B -C highlight the unique helical junction region of this pseudoknot. Note that both Watson-Crick and Hoogsteen faces of the 3\u2032 nucleotide of loop L2, A27, are tied up in hydrogen bonding (Giedroc et al., 2003; Nixon et al., 2002b) , much like previously observed for A155 in the HCV IRES four-way junction (Kieft et al., 2002) .\n\nSince the conformation of loop L2 in the PEMV-1 pseudoknot is now far better defined by the data (Fig. 10A) , it is possible to conclude that the structure of the five most 3\u2032 residues of loop L2 (5\u2032-A23-C24-A25-A26-A27) is essentially identical to that found in the BWYV (Egli et al., 2002) and PLRV (Pallan et al., 2005) pseudoknots, each of which contains an identical 5\u2032-ACAAA 3\u2032 L2 sequence (Fig. 10D-F) . Briefly, residues C24 through A27 all point their Watson-Crick edges into the S1 minor groove where they are engaged in numerous hydrogenbonding interactions. In addition to A27 and A25 discussed above, the N1/N6 face of A26 forms two hydrogen bonds with the N3-N2 edge of G7. C24 also points into the S1 minor groove, with the N4 amino group close to the 2\u2032 OH of G17. A23 is stacked on C24, with the Watson-Crick edge rotated out of the stack, leaving the N7 and N6 nitrogens within hydrogen bonding distance of the 2\u2032-OH of G17. At this point the PEMV-1 structure diverges from the BWYV/PLRV structures, with A22 stacked on A23, and essentially extruded from of the triple helix, with A21 inserted back into the S1 minor groove near the top two S1 base pairs. G20 is extrahelical. In fact, if one considers A22 an extrahelical insertion in the PEMV-1 loop L2, the entire 5\u2032-A(A)ACAAA loop sequence adopts essentially identical conformations in all three pseudoknots (Fig. 10D-F) .\n\nThe solution structure of the ScYLV P1-P2 pseudoknot is characterized by several unique features relative to the PEMV-1 and BWYV/PLRV RNAs (see Fig. 9 ) (Cornish et al., 2005) . Notably, all of loop L2 is very well-ordered and exhibits continuous stacking of A20 through C27 into the minor groove of S1, with C25 flipped out of the triple-stranded stack. Five consecutive triple base pairs flank the helical junction where the 3\u2032 nucleotide of L2, C27, adopts a cytidine 27 N3-cytidine 14 2\u2032-OH hydrogen bonding interaction with the C14-G7 base pair (Cornish et al., 2006a) . This interaction is isosteric with the adenosine N1-2\u2032-OH interaction found in the BWYV , PLRV (Pallan et al., 2005) and PEMV-1 RNAs (cf. Fig. 9) ; however, the ScYLV and BWYV mRNA structures differ in their detailed L2-S1 hydrogen bonding and L2 stacking interactions (Fig. 10D-G) .\n\nGiven the isosteric nature of the C27 N3\u2022\u2022\u2022C14 2\u2032 OH (ScYLV) and A25 N1\u2022\u2022\u2022C14 2\u2032 OH (BWYV) hydrogen bonds in these two RNAs by NMR (Cornish et al., 2006a; Giedroc et al., 2003) , the extent to which a BWYV-like adenosine in the ScYLV context could functionally substitute for the 3\u2032 L2 cytidine (C27) was investigated. The unexpected finding from these experiments was that the C27A ScYLV RNA is a very poor frameshift stimulator in vitro (Cornish et al., 2005) . This surprising finding, in turn, made the prediction that substitution of A25 in the BWYV RNA with cytidine (A25C) would increase frameshifting in this context; this is exactly what was found. Thus, a 3\u2032 L2 cytidine is a positive determinant for frameshift stimulation by luteoviral RNAs (Cornish et al., 2006b) . Strikingly, the global structure of the C27A ScYLV RNA is nearly indistinguishable from the wild-type counterpart, despite the fact that the helical junction region is altered and incorporates the anticipated isostructural A27\u00b7 (G7-C14) minor groove base triple (Cornish et al., 2006b) in adopting a helical junction region that is superimposable with that of the beet western yellows virus (BWYV) pseudoknot , as expected. These results suggest that the global \"ground-state\" structure is not strongly correlated with frameshift stimulation and point to a reduced stability that derives from an altered helical junction architecture in the C27A ScYLV RNA as of significant functional importance, for which there is some evidence (Cornish and Giedroc, 2006; Cornish et al., 2005) .\n\nStudies in other frameshifting systems have also uncovered some correlation between thermodynamic stability of the downstream element and frameshifting efficiency (Bidou et al., 1997; ten Dam et al., 1995) , although it is not obvious why this has to be the case (Cao and Chen, 2008; Theimer and Giedroc, 2000) . In fact, in luteoviral pseudoknots, insertion or deletion of an unpaired and extrahelical residue(s) near the \"top\" of loop L2 often strongly increases frameshifting efficiency, a finding often attributed to a direct interaction with the ribosome (Kim et al., 2000; Kim et al., 1999) . We have argued that distinct unfolding thermodynamics measured for closely related RNAs, e.g., WT vs. C27A ScYLV RNAs, may in fact be reporting on different kinetics of pseudoknot unfolding, with increased rates of unfolding, i.e., unfolding at lower applied forces, negatively correlated with frameshift stimulation Theimer and Giedroc, 2000) . In other words, these studies suggest the hypothesis that the helical junction in luteoviral RNAs is mechanically stable and functions as a classic kinetic barrier (Onoa et al., 2003) to force-induced unfolding, essentially placing the unfolding of the entire pseudoknot under kinetic control. This barrier is predicted to be altered in functionally compromised RNAs. Mechanical force-induced unfolding/ refolding experiments will be required to obtain direct evidence for this proposal (see below).\n\nGiven that the ground-state or lowest energy structure of a frameshifting pseudoknot may be a poor predictor of frameshifting efficiency (Cornish et al., 2006b) , this has motivated efforts to identify other physical features of the RNA that might be more strongly positively correlated with setting frameshifting efficiency. Since the translocating ribosome places force on the downstream mRNA (Wen et al., 2008) while engaging in either active or passive unwinding of secondary structure, understanding the mechanical stability of pseudoknots toward forceinduced unfolding over a force regime thought to be achievable by the ribosome is of considerable interest. Two groups have now investigated the extent to which various IBV pp1a-pp1b derived frameshifting pseudoknots that differ in their frameshifting efficiencies are unfolded as a function of force in an optical trapping or tweezers experiment (Green et al., 2008; Hansen et al., 2007) . Here, the pseudoknot is attached to two microbeads via annealing to long \u2248500 nucleotide ssDNA handles immobilized on the bead, with one bead held in an optical trap and the other held on the tip of a micropipette by suction (Liphardt et al., 2001) . Both groups compared 11-bp and 10-bp S1-containing IBV pseudoknots which stimulate frameshifting to very different degrees ; loop L2 lengths were also different in the two studies. Note that these experiments investigated the intrinsic mechanical properties of the pseudoknot itself in isolation and in the absence of bound or stalled ribosomes.\n\nIn the more limited of the two studies, Hansen et al. (2007) measured simple repetitive stretching-relaxation unfolding-folding trajectories and showed that the RNA with the 11-bp stem S1 appear to require approximately two-fold greater unfolding force than the 10-bp construct, with the 10-bp construct more often than not unfolding in multiple steps relative to the 11-bp RNA. In contrast, Green et al. (2008) saw no clear correlation between frameshifting efficiency and the mechanical force required to unfold the RNAs; however, the work made several striking observations. Mg 2+ strongly stabilizes the kinetic and thermodynamic stability of the \"wild-type\" IBV pseudoknot, with an unfolding transition state very close to the folded structure in the presence of Mg 2+ (Green et al., 2008) . This means that the pseudoknot is a \"brittle\" structure (Onoa et al., 2003) with a correspondingly very shallow dependence of the unfolding rate on applied force (measured at three different pulling rates) (Li et al., 2006a; Li et al., 2006b) ; the rate of unfolding is also much slower than component hairpin structures. Both features are in striking contrast to the component hairpins and the unfolding of the partially folded intermediates that lack pseudoknot tertiary pairing (Green et al., 2008) . Thus, the pseudoknot tertiary structure is clearly characterized by unique mechanical properties relative to component RNA hairpins (Green et al., 2008) . It will be interesting to determine the degree to which the tertiary structure of frameshifting pseudoknots from other structural classes (Cornish et al., 2005; Michiels et al., 2001) and the stem-loop structures from HIV-1 and SIV/ HIV-2 gag-pol shift sites (Marcheschi et al., 2007; Staple and Butcher, 2005b ) (see Fig. 7 -9) form \"brittle\" structures distinct from compliant RNA hairpins (Li et al., 2006b) .\n\nAlthough these studies focus on the unfolding rate as critical for frameshift stimulation by individual ribosome-pseudoknot encounters, the number of translocating ribosomes on a single mRNA molecule might also have a detectable influence on ensemble average frameshifting efficiency (Lopinski et al., 2000) . In this model, the rate of refolding the downstream stimulatory element after unfolding and decoding by the first ribosome may have a significant impact on overall frameshift efficiency because a lagging ribosome(s) may encounter a stimulatory element that remains unfolded. This model predicts that the rate of translation initiation, or loading of successive ribosomes, on a mRNA containing a frameshift signal might have a detectable influence on overall frameshifting efficiency. Recent support for this idea has recently been published for HIV-1-infected cells in culture (Gendron et al., 2008) , in which the presence of a low concentration of the upstream transactivation response element (TAR) RNA, known to be present in the cytoplasm of virus-infected cells as a free RNA, activates protein kinase R (PKR) which in turn phosphorylates the translation initiation factor eIF2\u03b1 effectively halting translation initiation (Sadler and Williams, 2007) . Although it is not known precisely how HIV-1 manipulates translation initiation to appropriately express the genome, this suggests that frameshifting efficiency may well be determined by the number of ribosomes engaged in translation elongation on a single mRNA.\n\nFuture experiments capable of investigating the high resolution structure (Beardsley et al., 2006; Namy et al., 2006; Selmer et al., 2006) and/or real-time conformational dynamics (Blanchard et al., 2004; Cornish et al., 2008; Lee et al., 2007; Munro et al., 2007) of single ribosome-mRNA-tRNA complexes paused over a frameshifting signal hold considerable promise for enhancing our mechanistic understanding of how programmed ribosomal recoding events function (for a recent review on single molecule methods as applied to translation, see Munro et al., 2008) . For example, a recent study reports the use of optical trapping methods to observe single ribosomes translocating through an RNA stem-loop structure via continuous measurement of the end-to-end length of the mRNA as it is unwound by the ribosome (Wen et al., 2008) . The most striking observation from these studies, among many, is that while the ribosome moves in discrete translocation steps of three nucleotides or one codon over 0.1 s on average, this step-wise movement is punctuated by pauses of a very wide time duration (seconds to minutes) (Wen et al., 2008) . Thus, under these conditions, ribosomal pausing is rate-determining for protein synthesis; this in turn, creates a mechanistic scenario that can be directly exploited by recoding signals embedded in the mRNA that are dependent on ribosomal pausing, like \u22121 PRF (Blanchard, 2008) . Indeed, of the two rate-determining steps for pausing, one step that preceded translocation was force-dependent (Wen et al., 2008) ; it seems possible that this step might be reporting on the action of the ribosomal helicase as it attempts to unwind the stem-loop. In any case, this finding provides support for the hypothesis that mRNA tension implicit in any mechanical model of ribosomal frameshifting might strongly influence ribosomal movement in a functionally relevant way.\n\nFuture single-molecule studies that employ more natural sequence mRNAs that are capable of forming frameshift-stimulating RNA hairpins or RNA pseudoknots like those discussed here to directly measure translation, ribosome movement or conformational switching of ribosomal subunits in real time (Cornish et al., 2008) will shed dramatic new light on how downstream RNA elements mediate programmed ribosomal frameshifting. Recent developments of ultrasensitive dual optical trap instrumentation (Greenleaf et al., 2008) as well as other instrumentation that combines single-molecule fluorescence with force manipulation in a single experiment (Hohng et al., 2007) will permit the investigation of more subtle structural changes in essentially every phase of translation, thereby shedding direct insight on the ribosome as a motor protein (Myong et al., 2007) , much like the seminal work on bacterial RNA polymerase has provided for our understanding of mechanics of transcription (Abbondanzieri et al., 2005) and transcriptional regulation by riboswitches (Greenleaf et al., 2008) .

Adapted from (Selmer et al., 2006) . A schematized view of a single translocation cycle of translation that shows three possible points in the cycle that \u22121 frameshifting could potentially be stimulated by a downstream pseudoknot. In one scenario, \u22121 PRF is proposed to occur from the hybrid A/P-P/E state which is stabilized by EF-G\u2022GTP (eEF2\u2022GTP) binding; this binding in turn, weakens the interaction of the deacylated P-site tRNA with the mRNA inducing frameshifting before 30S (40S in eukaryotes) translocation to the classical P/P and E/E states accompanied by hydrolysis and EF-G\u2022GDP (eEF2\u2022GDP) release Spiegel et al., 2007) . Alternatively, \u22121 PRF occurs during the 30S (40S) translocation step itself . Both models are distinguished from a previous model that invoked simultaneous slippage (SS) of two tRNAs in the 5\u2032 direction after accommodation and before peptidyl transfer (Jacks et al., 1988; Plant et al., 2003) .
