{"title": "Derivation of a novel SARS-coronavirus replicon cell line and its application for anti-SARS drug screening", "body": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a potentially fatal atypical pneumonia that arose in Guangdong Province of the People's Republic of China in November 2002, quickly spreading to 26 countries on five different continents and causing large-scale outbreaks in Hong Kong, Singapore and Toronto in early 2003 (Peiris et al., 2003b) . SARS was recognized in late 2002 and by the end of the viral outbreak in July 2003, there have been more than 8000 SARS cases reported worldwide and 774 SARS-attributed deaths . This outbreak had a severe and profound impact on public health and economies worldwide, reminding us of the danger emerging infectious diseases bring to densely populated societies.\n\nCoronaviruses (order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, genus Coronavirus) are a group of viruses with large, enveloped crown-like virions and positive-sense single-stranded RNA genomes (Siddell et al., 1983) . The genomes of coronaviruses range from 27 to 32 kb, the largest of any of the known RNA viruses. All coronaviruses share the characteristic 3\u2032 co-terminal and nested-set structure of sub-genomic RNAs in addition to unique RNA synthesis strategies, genome organization, nucleotide sequence homology and structural proteins particular only to coronaviruses (Cavanagh et al., 1995) .\n\nThe etiologic agent of SARS was identified as a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Peiris et al., 2003a; Drosten et al., 2003; Ksiazek et al., 2003; Poutanen et al., 2003) although the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV does not resemble any of the three recognized groups of coronaviruses. Soon after the disease was recognized, SARS-CoV was confirmed as the causative agent of SARS; by demonstrating that the coronavirus could be used to experimentally infect and induce interstitial pneumonitis in Cynomolgus macaques, thus fulfilling Koch's postulates Kuiken et al., 2003) .\n\nAlthough the 2002/2003 SARS epidemic was eventually controlled by patient isolation, there is neither an effective treatment for SARS presently nor an efficacious vaccine to prevent infection (Peiris et al., 2003b) . The significant morbidity and mortality, including its potential for reemergence, make it necessary to develop effective methods to treat and prevent the disease. Therefore, in the fight against SARS, it is important to develop antiviral agents that can specifically inhibit the RNA synthesis of SARS-CoV.\n\nTo maximize the chance of finding efficacious anti-SARS drugs, high-throughput screening of large chemical libraries for compounds that can block SARS-CoV replication must be carried out. However, the high infectivity and virulence of SARS-CoV render this kind of research very dangerous. Therefore, there is a need for an anti-viral agent identification system that does not involve the use of live virus.\n\nTo this aim, partial viral RNA genomes have been constructed such that they replicate and persist in dividing cells without producing viral particles (Kaplan and Racaniello, 1988; Liljestrom and Garoff, 1991; Khromykh and Westaway, 1997; Behrens et al., 1998; Lohmann et al., 1999; Pang et al., 2001; Shi et al., 2002; Thumfart and Meyers, 2002; Hertzig et al., 2004) . These viral replicons were derived from viral genomes through the deletion of all or some structural genes. Due to the absence of viral structural genes, virion proteins are not synthesized in the cells and therefore no infectious viral particle could be produced by the cells. However, since all transand cis-acting components required for viral RNA synthesis are retained, these partial viral RNAs could replicate autonomously in the cells.\n\nThis report describes the construction of the first SARS-CoV-derived replicon cell line. This SARS-associated replicon cell line is based on the use of SARS replicon cDNAs generated by reverse genetic techniques. The results demonstrate that these SARS-CoV-derived replicon cell lines can be used to test candidate SARS-CoV replicase inhibitors without the need to grow infectious SARS-CoV.\n\nOur method of developing replicon constructs was based on the strategy previously used to assemble the full-length cDNA construct SARS-CoV (Yount et al., 2003) . The strategy for the construction of the replicon is illustrated in Fig. 1 . Viral envelope-protein coding genes S, E and M were excluded from the replicon to disable virion synthesis, production and secretion. The nucleocapsid gene, N, was retained because the nucleocapsid protein has been shown to be required for viral RNA synthesis (Almazan et al., 2004; Hertzig et al., 2004) and that the sequence involved in the regulation of the expression of a coronavirus 3\u2032-proximal gene is more than \u223c 50 nt upstream of the gene (Alonso et al., 2002; Jeong et al., 1996) . Therefore, to achieve relatively native expression of N gene from the replicon, a region \u223c 60 nt upstream of N ORF was included in the replicon. The green fluorescent protein-blasticidin deaminase fusion (GFP-BlaR) gene was also included into the replicon to enable easy selection and detection of repliconcontaining cells. GFP-BlaR gene was inserted between ORF 1 and N, not at the 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 end of the replicon, in order to minimize any possible deleterious effect in the synthesis of replicon RNA. The expression of GFP-BlaR was driven by the transcription regulatory sequence of ORF S, which was included in the replicon and occurring at a position right upstream of the GFP-BlaR gene. Following this strategy, six cDNA subclones that span the SARS-CoV genome were used in the assembly of recombinant SARS-CoV replicon cDNA. The green fluorescent protein-blasticidin deaminase fusion (Gb) gene was amplified from the plasmid pTracer\u2122-CMV/ Bsd/LacZ using PCR and included into the replicon constructs. In addition, the cDNAs constructed were flanked by restriction sites that leave unique interconnecting junctions of 3 or 4 nts in length (SapI or BsaI). As these sticky ends are not complementary to the majority of other sticky ends, which are generated by the same enzyme at other sites in the DNA, replicon cDNAs can be systematically assembled by in vitro ligation.\n\nThe total DNA from the above ligation reaction, after an extraction using phenol-chloroform, was used directly as the template for the in vitro transcription and synthesis of the SARS-CoV replicon RNA. For a rough quality inspection, an aliquot of the post-transcription mixture was analyzed on a denaturing agarose gel and the transcripts seen were of the appropriate lengths (data not shown).\n\nThe purified SARS-CoV replicon RNA was used to transfect BHK-21 cells and the transfected cells were subjected to blasticidin selection to enrich for the replicon-carrying cells. As fluorescence indicates successful transfection and selection of SARS-CoV replicon RNA, transfected cells were observed for fluorescence microscopically after 5 days of blasticidin treatment. Clusters of green-fluorescent cells were observed and a typical green-fluorescent cell cluster is shown in Fig. 2A . As observed, there was no sign of any cytotoxicity due to the SARS-CoV replicon and the morphology of the greenfluorescent cells was typical of BHK-21 cells. The transfected cultures were further maintained under blasticidin selection to obtain cells that carried the SARS-CoV replicon consistently.\n\nAutonomous replication of viral RNA was also successfully maintained, Northern blot analysis of total cellular RNAs prepared from SCR-1 revealed the presence of full-length replicon RNA and replicon RNA derived transcripts encoding Gb and N genes. The N gene probe detected replicon RNA and replicon RNA-derived Gb-N and N RNAs. The Gb probe detected only those RNAs containing the Gb gene; replicon RNA and replicon RNA-derived Gb-N mRNA (Fig. 2B ).\n\nGFP expression of SCR-1 has been studied by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry for a period of 3 months (over 40 passages under blasticidin selection). As shown in Fig. 2C , the average green fluorescence intensity value of SRC-1 culture remained at a constant level and was in excess of that of the parent BHK-21 culture. These results were consistent when compared to previous findings (Hertzig et al., 2004) . Hertzig et al. (2004) analyzed the GFP expression of HCoV 229E replicon cells by flow cytometry for a period of 4 months (over 50 passages under G418 selection) and they showed that the percentage of green fluorescent cells remained at a constant level of 40-60% throughout this period. Thus, these data indicate that although replicon cells may express sufficient GFP-BlaR to survive blasticidin selection, the amount of GFP BlaR protein was insufficient to be detected by flow cytometry. A possible cause for differential GFP BlaR protein expression in replicon cells is the efficiency of functional replicon RNA uptake during transfection. Thus, this analysis shows that the SARS-CoV replicon persists efficiently and grows consistently in the cells under selection for substantial periods of time and would be suitable to use for anti-SARS drug screening purposes. Furthermore, SCR-1 cells that have been stored for 1 month in liquid nitrogen and re-cultured still displayed green fluorescence indistinguishable from cells that have been passaged continuously (data not shown). Subsequent passage of cell culture supernatants onto BHK-21 cells also did not result in either blasticidin resistance or GFP expression, thus demonstrating that the replicon particles are not released by passaging supernatants into fresh cultures.\n\nSequence analysis of the replicon RNA purified from SCR-1 cells soon after selection in blasticidin (passage number 6) found no sequence differences compared with the published sequence of SARS-CoV strain SIN2774 (GenBank Accession Number AY283798). At passage number 40, the RNA from SCR-1 cells was purified and examined again by sequence analysis. At this later passage, three nucleotide changes were detected that resulted in three amino acids changes: two in ORF 1 and one in N gene (Table 1) . Since these nucleotide changes were not encoded by the cloned cDNA and no adaptive mutations had occurred in the early passage, these three mutations, most likely, have been acquired during replication in the later passage. It remains important to elucidate whether the mutations facilitate efficient replication of replicon RNA in SCR-1. \n\nTo develop a fast and convenient antiviral screening protocol for the detection of SARS-CoV replicase inhibitors, three previously described antiviral drugs were tested, all of which have been evaluated in the context of SARS-CoV inhibition in tissue culture (Yount et al., 2003; Cinatl et al., 2003; So et al., 2003) . The compounds were applied in different concentrations on SCR-1 cells and GFP expression was monitored by flow cytometry analysis, fluorescent microscopy and quantitative real-time PCR 3 days later. Untreated cells served as controls and the cytotoxic effect of each compound was assessed in parallel on parental BHK-21 cells. As shown in Fig. 3 , incubation of SCR-1 cells with E64-d at 0.4 mg/ml reduced not only the level of reporter gene expression and the copy number of replicon RNA but also the overall percentage of green fluorescent cells. Importantly, no cytotoxicity of E64-d was observed at or near inhibitory concentrations. Ribavirin showed low inhibitory activity at the concentration of 0.4 mg/mL and significant cytotoxic effects were observed at higher concentration, 0.5-5 mg/mL. As such, Ribavirin was considered to be inactive against SARS-CoV replication. Glycyrrhizin showed low inhibitory effect at the concentration of 2 mg/mL. These results indicate that the cysteine proteinase inhibitor E64-d appears to represent a promising candidate for the inhibition of SARS-CoV replicase function. On the other hand, the therapeutic efficacy of the other drugs may be limited because of their low specific inhibitory effect and significant cytotoxicity. Taken together, these results show that the replicon cell lines thus developed would be useful for anti-SARS drug screening and will provide a tool to study candidate anti-SARS agents.\n\nIn the past 15 years, the concept of autonomously replicating RNAs (replicon RNAs) has been applied to a number of positivestrand RNA virus systems and has led to the establishment of novel antiviral screening assays and vectors (Bartenschlager, 2002; Lo et al., 2003) . Baric's group constructed a transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) replicon for the expression of heterologous GFP gene (Curtis et al., 2002) and Thiel's group generated a non-cytopathic, selectable replicon RNA (based on HCoV 229E) for the identification of coronavirus replicase inhibitors (Hertzig et al., 2004) . Nevertheless, the genomic sequence data of SARS-CoV reveal that this novel agent did not belong to any of the known groups of coronaviruses, including two human coronaviruses, HcoV OC43 and HcoV 229E (Peiris et al., 2003a; Drosten et al., 2003) . Therefore, despite the presence of functional replicon RNA assays (Hertzig et al., 2004) , there is a need for the development of SARS-CoV replicon cell lines, which would allow a rapid and safe identification of inhibitors that are specific for SARS-CoV. In this study, the first selectable SARS-CoV based replicon cell line was successfully established and characterized for the purpose of screening anti-SARS drugs. The SARS-CoV replicon cell line we described here will be a valuable tool for the development of anti-SARS therapeutics.\n\nOur results with the following replicase inhibitors clearly demonstrate that our SARS-CoV replicon system facilitates the identification of these inhibitors in tissue culture. Replicase inhibitor Ribavirin, although active against a wide range of viruses and used as SARS therapy (So et al., 2003) , was shown in this study to be inactive against SARS-CoV in vitro at noncytotoxic concentration, which is in line with previous reports (Tan et al., 2004; Cinatl et al., 2003; Wu et al., 2004) . Next, the finding that E64-d inhibitor had selective activity against SARS-CoV is in line with a study by Yount et al. (2003) , who showed that E64-d effectively inhibited SARS-CoV replication in tissue culture. For glycyrrhizin, the variation in results obtained in this study as compared to previously published results may be due to assay conditions including virus strain, detection method and compound concentration and handling (Cinatl et al., 2003) . Notably, other independent groups also observed the lack of anti-SARS-CoV activity of glycyrrhizin (Hertzig et al., 2004) . This indicates that glycyrrhizin may not inhibit coronavirus replication but instead exert antiviral effects during virus adsorption or release.\n\nWith an easily detectable GFP expression and the absence of virion production, our viral replicon cell line represents a simpler and safer system for anti-viral agent identification than a live virus infection system. Thus, the efficacy of candidate inhibitors can be evaluated by measuring the fluorescence intensity of the replicon cells before and after the addition of drugs. That means our cell-based system can be easily automated and used in large-scale screening of anti-SARS-CoV agents. Furthermore, our viral replicon cell-based system can be used to test individual antiviral agents designed based on certain biochemical principles or new drugs targeting at multiple regions of the SARS-CoV ORF 1 or N gene. Since no infectious virus is formed, the assay represents a safe protocol that can be performed in biosafety level 2 laboratories.\n\nCompared to anti-viral agent identification systems based on purified proteins or nucleic acids, our SARS-CoV replicon cell line has two advantages: first, if a candidate inhibitor can inhibit replication of our replicon RNA, which occurs intracellularly, it thus demonstrates that this agent can permeate the cell. Secondly, the cytotoxicity of the candidate inhibitor can also be observed simultaneously by noting its cell morphology. Two critical indexes of a candidate inhibitor-its inhibitory effect and cytotoxicity, can therefore be met using our SARS-CoV replicon cell line. For an anti-viral agent identified using a purified-bimolecular-based system, further tests on cell delivery and cytotoxicity of the agent has to be done separately.\n\nA disadvantage of our replicon cell-based system is that the structural genes S, E and M are not included in the replicon RNA. Therefore, it cannot be used to screen for drugs that act on cellular and viral targets involved in receptor binding, virus entry, genome encapsulation and virus release. However, structural genes of coronaviruses change rapidly and anti-viral agents that target these genes have less consistent efficacy. Thus, anti-viral agents should target regions highly conserved in the coronavirus genome such as ORF 1, which is the most conserved region found.\n\nIn conclusion, our replicon system provides a convenient and safe screening system for the identification of drug candidates selectively active against SARS-CoV. The protocols and reagents developed in this study will be useful for gaining insights into the mechanisms of RNA synthesis of this pathogen. Potential additional applications include the development of RNA vaccines against SARS-CoV and RNA vectors for long-term gene expression.\n\nThe baby hamster kidney (BHK)-21 cell line was purchased from American Typical Culture Center (ATCC). BHK-21 cell line was maintained in DMEM medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum (Gibco) (D10). SARS-CoV strain SIN2774 virion RNA (a gift of Prof. T. K. Chow, Department of Microbiology, National University of Singapore) was used as the template for cDNA synthesis.\n\nThe reverse genetic strategy for constructing the desired SARS-CoV replicon is illustrated in Fig. 1 . The reverse transcription reaction was performed using the SuperScript III First Strand Kit (Invitrogen) as described in the manufacturer's manual with some modifications (Nathan et al., 1995) . The reverse transcription was primed using oligonucleotide 9R (5\u2032-GTCATTCTCCTA AGAAGCTATTAAAATCACATGG-3\u2032) and 09R (5\u2032-GATTCAGGTCTC ATTGTCCTCCAC TTGC TAGGTAATCC-3\u2032). The cDNAs were denatured for 30 s at 94\u00b0C and amplified by PCR with Elongase Amplification System (Invitrogen) with 35 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 55\u00b0C for 30 s, and 68\u00b0C for 1.5 to 6 min depending on the size of the amplicon. The amplicons were isolated from agarose gels and cloned into Topo II TA vectors (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions. The following primers were used in the isolation of the SARS A1 subclone (froward, 5\u2032-CACGCTCTTCAGCATAC TAATACGACTCACTATA-GATATTAGGTTTTTACCTACCCAGGAAAAG-3\u2032, reverse, 5\u2032-GAATGAGCTCTTCATGGTAATGGTTGAGTTGG-TACAAGG-3\u2032); A2 subclone (forward, 5\u2032-GAATGAGCT-CTTCACCAAATGCGAGTTTTGATAATTTCB-3\u2032, reverse, 5\u2032-CAACCATCCATGATATGAACATAGC-3\u2032); B subclone (froward, 5\u2032-CCGTTTCTGCAA TGGTTAGGATG-3\u2032, reverse, 5\u2032-GGCTGCTGTAGTCAATGGTATGATG-3\u2032); C subclone (froward, 5\u2032-GCAGATCAGGCTATGACCCAAATGTAC-3\u2032, reverse, 5\u2032-TGGGAGGCTT ATGTGACTTGC-3\u2032); D subclone (froward, 5\u2032-GTGCCTGTATTAGGAGACCATTCC-3\u2032, reverse, 5\u2032-GTATCAGGTCTCAATGTTCGTTTAGTTGT-TAACAAGAATATCAC-3\u2032) and N subclone (froward, 5\u2032-CATTCAGGTCTCATTGGTACCTTCATGAAGGTCACC-3\u2032, reverse, 5\u2032-GTCATTCTCCTAAGAAGCTATTAAAATCA-CATGG-3\u2032). The Gb DNA was amplified as described above, except that the template was pTracer\u2122-CMV/Bsd/LacZ vector DNA (1 ng) and the primers were forward, 5\u2032-CGTGGATC-CGGTCTCTACATGGCCTCCA AAGGAGAAGAAC-3\u2032 and reverse, 5\u2032-CCAGAATTCGGTCTCACCAATTAGCCCTC-CCA CACATAACCAG-3\u2032.\n\nTwo to five independent clones of each SARS amplicon were isolated and sequenced using a panel of primers located about 0.5 kb from each other on the SARS insert and an ABI model automated sequencer. The sequencing data thus obtained were compared with the published sequence of SARS-CoV strain SIN2774 (GenBank Accession Number AY283798) using the MegAlign module of the sequence analysis software Lasergene (DNASTAR). A consensus sequence for each of the cloned fragments were determined, and when necessary (i.e., A1, B and D subclones), a consensus clone was assembled using restriction enzymes and standard recombinant DNA techniques to remove unwanted amino acid changes except silent mutations.\n\nEach of the plasmids was grown to high concentration, isolated and digested or double-digested with SapI or BsaI according to the manufacturer's direction (NEB). The appropriately sized cDNA inserts were isolated from 0.7 \u223c 1.2% agarose gels and extracted using the Qiaex II DNA purification kit (Qiagen). The A1 + A2 + B, C + D, and Gb + N fragments were ligated overnight and isolated. The A1A2B + CD + GbN cDNAs were ligated overnight at 4\u00b0C. The resulting DNA was extracted first by phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), then by chloroform, and precipitated in the presence of 67% ethanol and 0.1 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2). Shortly before the performance of in vitro transcription (see below), the extracted DNA was pelleted by centrifugation, washed with 70% ethanol, air-dried and finally dissolved in 10 \u03bcl of RNasefree water. The detailed cloning strategy, plasmid maps and sequences are available from the author upon request.\n\nThe T7 in vitro transcription system mMessage mMachine Kit (Ambion), which also includes the RNA 5\u2032-capping function, was used to generate the SARS-CoV replicon RNA. For 2 h at 37\u00b0C, a 30-\u03bcl reaction mix were performed with 4.5 \u03bcl of a 30 mM GTP stock, resulting in a 1:1 ratio of GTP to cap analog. To remove the DNA template, 1 \u03bcl of DNase I (2 U/\u03bcl) was then added and the reaction mix was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 15 min. To polyadenylate the RNA synthesized, the reaction mixture was treated further by the reagents from the Poly (A) Tailing Kit (Ambion). The final product was purified by adding 30 \u03bcl of LiCl precipitation solution (Ambion) to pellet the RNA. The RNA was washed once with 1 ml of 70% ethanol, air-dried, and finally dissolved in 20 \u03bcl of RNase-free water.\n\nBHK-21 cells grown to 50% confluence in a 6-well plate were transfected with 10 \u03bcg of SARS-CoV replicon RNA and 10 \u03bcl of the transfection agent Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. One day after transfection, blasticidin (Invitrogen) was added to a final concentration of 10 \u03bcg/ml to the culture medium to select for the replicon-carrying cells. Two weeks later individual cell clones were isolated and expanded until analysis or storage in liquid nitrogen.\n\nThe blasticidin-resistant cell line generated was designated as SCR-1 and subjected to analyses pertinent to the SARS-CoV replicon that they carried. The parent cell line BHK-21 was used as the negative control in these analyses.\n\nFluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry were used to observe the green fluorescence of GFP BlaR protein expressed from the SARS-CoV replicon. The cells were observed under an Olympus IX70 inverted fluorescence microscope and the images were recorded using Image-Pro Plus (Media Cybernetics). The cells were then scanned for green fluorescence and light scattering using a Beckman Coulter Epics Altra flow cytometer. The data collected were analyzed using the WIN-MDI 2.7 data analysis program (The Scripps Research Institute).\n\nTo analyze whether the introduced replicon RNA can mediate coronavirus-specific discontinuous transcription of L-Gb-N and L-N mRNAs (Fig. 4) , Northern blot analysis was performed. For Northern blot analysis, total cellular RNAs from BHK-21 or SCR-1 cells were isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN) according to the Animal Cell Protocol supplied by the manufacturer. Samples (10 \u03bcg) of total cellular RNAs were denatured, electroporated and transferred to a Hybond-N + positively charged nylon membrane (Ambion) as per the manufacturer's instructions and hybridized with fluoresceinlabelled probes specific for the Gb gene or the SARS N gene. The Gb and N probes were prepared from the Gb and N gene using the Gene Images Random Prime Labeling Module (Amersham). The hybridization of probes to the immobilized RNAs on the nylon membrane and subsequent signal generation were done using the reagents from the Gene Images CDP-Star Detection Module (Amersham). Chemiluminescent signals Fig. 4 . Generation of sub-replicon RNAs through discontinuous transcription of SARS-CoV replicon RNA in the replicon-carrying cells. The black box represents the 72-nt leader RNA sequence, derived from the 5\u2032 end of the replicon, located at the 5\u2032 end of each sub-replicon RNA. The size of each RNA shown is exclusive of the poly-A tail. emitted from the blot were detected by exposing a Hyperfilm-MP X-ray film (Amersham) to the blot for durations between 1 to 10 min, followed by the photographic development of the exposed film.\n\nTo obtain the complete sequence of the SARS-CoV replicon persisting in the SCR-1 cells, the total cellular RNAs isolated from SRC-1 cells at passage number 6 and 40 were used as the templates. The RNA was amplified by RT-PCR and the PCR products were gel-purified and sequenced directly. Primers used in the RT-PCR and sequence analysis are available upon request.\n\nTo prove that the replicon particles are not released by passaging supernatants into fresh cultures, supernatants obtained from SCR-1 cell cultures were passaged onto fresh BHK-21 cells and examined for blasticidin resistance and GFP expression.\n\nTo identify potential agents active against SARS-CoV replication, three drugs approved for clinical use in the treatment of viral infections were tested. E64-d and glycyrrhizin (Sigma) were included in this test due to their previously reported activities against SARS-CoV replication (Yount et al., 2003; Cinatl et al., 2003) . Ribavirin (ICN Pharma) was also used as it represents a widely used class of nucleoside analogs, which inhibits viral polymerases (So et al., 2003) . SCR-1 cells were cultured in a 96-well plate in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 10 \u03bcg/mL blasticidin. The culture media was removed after a 1-day incubation when the cells reached 80-90% confluence and replaced by fresh medium without blasticidin. Graded doses of drugs were added on monolayers of SCR-1 cells and an untreated well was served as control. Three days later, the cells were harvested and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Four duplicate tests were performed. Inhibition of reporter gene expression was calculated as reduction of the fluorescence intensity of GFP-positive cells by setting the fluorescence intensity of untreated SRC-1 cells at 100%. In parallel, the cytotoxicity of drugs was assayed on BHK-21 cells using CellTiter 96 Aqueous Non-radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay Kits (Promega).\n\nReal-time RT-PCR analyses were performed to quantify the copy number of replicon RNA in SCR-1 cells before and after drug treatment. Total cellular RNAs from BHK-21 or SCR-1 cells were isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit and One-step Artus SARS LC RT-PCR kit (QIAGEN, Hamburg, Germany) was used for real-time quantitative amplification of SARS-CoV replicon RNA. Real time RT-PCRs were performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The amplicon and primers were as described . Briefly, 5 \u03bcl of total RNA extract was added to a capillary tube containing 15 \u03bcl of RT-PCR reagents and loaded into the LightCycler (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). The thermal cycling conditions were as follows: RT was performed at 50\u00b0C for 10 min; and amplification was performed for 1 cycle of 95\u00b0C for 10 s, followed by 50 cycles of 2 s of denaturing at 95\u00b0C, 12 s of annealing at 55\u00b0C, and 10 s of extension at 72\u00b0C. Finally, cooling was performed at 40\u00b0C for 30 s. Total RNA extracted from BHK-21 cells was used as the negative control. Internal SARS-CoV standards, which allow the determination of the copy number of replicon RNA, were supplied with the assay kit. Real-time PCR signals were analyzed using the LightCycler software (Roche; version 5.32), and the sizes and uniqueness of PCR products were verified by performing both melting curves and agarose gel electrophoresis. The copy number of replicon RNA was determined by direct comparison with the internal standards. Replicon RNA expression levels are expressed as number of copies/\u03bcg total RNA. All samples were run in triplicate and the average value of the copy number was employed to quantify replicon RNA."}
