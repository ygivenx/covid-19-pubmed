{"title": "From Touchdown to Transcription: The Reovirus Cell Entry Pathway HHS Public Access", "body": "The mammalian reoviruses are members of the Reoviridae family, which includes the important human pathogens rotavirus and Colorado-tick fever virus (Schiff et al. 2007 ). Like other Reoviridae members, reoviruses are nonenveloped, icosahedral particles that contain a segmented, double-stranded (ds) RNA genome surrounded by concentric protein shells (Schiff et al. 2007 ). These viruses are ubiquitous and display a broad host range, resulting in infection of wide variety of mammals including humans (Virgin et al. 1997 ). However, reovirus causes disease primarily in the very young (Mann et al. 2002; Tardieu et al. 1983; Tyler et al. 2004 ). These viruses have served in some respects as prototypes for the study of the Reoviridae due to the availability of isolates that display dissimilar phenotypes, the ability to perform genetic analysis using reassortant viruses and reverse genetics, and the existence of a murine model of virus-induced disease.\n\nInitiation of reovirus infection requires deposition of the genome-containing inner capsid (known as the core) into the cytoplasm. Delivery of this rather large cargo (~70 nm in diameter) requires an exquisitely timed and regulated series of events both at the host cell surface and within host endosomes. The virus must attach to host cells, internalize and traffic to cellular endosomes, undergo proteolytic disassembly to expose the viral membrane-penetration apparatus, and penetrate host cell membranes for delivery of the viral core into the cytoplasm. These early events during reovirus infection activate innate immune signaling pathways. Here, we describe our current understanding of each of these steps in the cell entry pathway used by reovirus. 1). The reovirus genome consists of ten segments of dsRNA, which range in length from ~1.2 to ~3.9 kilobases. The genome segments are named based on size, with three large (L), three medium (M), and four small (S) segments. Reovirus proteins are designated according to the encoding gene segments, lambda (\u03bb) for L, mu (\u03bc) for M, and sigma (\u03c3) for S. The reovirus inner core has T = 1 symmetry and is primarily formed by a shell of 60 asymmetric dimers of \u03bb1 and 150 monomers of \u03c32 . Pentameric turrets of \u03bb2, a capping enzyme and conduit for viral transcripts exiting the core, are located at the icosahedral vertices of the reovirus particle and span both the inner core and the outer capsid (Bartlett et al. 1974; Cleveland et al. 1986; Dryden et al. 1993; Fausnaugh and Shatkin 1990; Furuichi et al. 1976; Gillies et al. 1971; Luongo et al. 1998 Luongo et al. , 2000 Mao and Joklik 1991; Reinisch et al. 2000) . Minor core components include \u03bc2 (~24 copies) and \u03bb3 (12 copies) (Coombs 1998; Dryden et al. 1998) . Each copy of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase \u03bb3 is associated with three monomers of \u03bb1 and occupies a single icosahedral vertex in the inner core (Drayna and Fields 1982; Starnes and Joklik 1993; Tao et al. 2002; Zhang et al. 2003) . Surrounding the core is the outer capsid, which has quasi T = 13 (laevo) icosahedral symmetry (Metcalf 1982) and is composed of 200 heterohexamers of the membranepenetration protein, \u03bc1, and its protective cap, \u03c33 (\u03bc1 3 \u03c33 3 ) (Dryden et al. 1993; Liemann et al. 2002; Metcalf 1982) . Extending from a \u03bb2 turret at each vertex of a reovirus particle is a trimer of \u03c31, the viral attachment protein, which is released during entry (Chappell et al. 2002; Dryden et al. 1993; Fraser et al. 1990; Furlong et al. 1988; Strong et al. 1991) .\n\nThe reovirus \u03c31 protein mediates binding to cellular receptors (Barton et al. 2001b; Chappell et al. 2000) and influences target-cell selection in the infected host (Weiner et al. 1977 (Weiner et al. , 1980 . The 455 amino acids of strain T3D \u03c31 fold into a trimer approximately 480 \u00c5 long and 90 \u00c5 wide at its broadest point, with a globular C-terminal head, a central body, and a slender N-terminal tail (Chappell et al. 2002; Fraser et al. 1990 ; Guglielmi et al. 2006) (Fig.  2) . Residues 310-455 comprise the head, which is constructed from two Greek-key motifs that assemble into an eight-stranded \u03b2-barrel (Chappell et al. 2002; Schelling et al. 2007 ). With the exception of the loop connecting \u03b2-strands D and E (D-E loop), which contains a 3 10 helix, loops connecting individual strands of the \u03b2-barrel are very short. N-terminal to the \u03c31 head, residues 246-309 form repeating units of two antiparallel \u03b2-strands connected by short loops. Three such units assemble into a triple \u03b2-spiral, which is a motif observed to date only in viral fibers, including the adenovirus fiber (van Raaij et al. 1999) , bacteriophage PRD1 P5 (Merckel et al. 2005) , avian reovirus attachment protein \u03c3C (Guardado et al. 2005) , and mammalian reovirus T3D \u03c31 (Chappell et al. 2002) . In addition to the three \u03b2spiral repeats observed in the crystallized \u03c31 fragment, sequence analysis suggests that the remainder of the T3D \u03c31 body (residues 167-249) contains an additional five N-terminal \u03b2spiral repeats (Chappell et al. 2002; Guglielmi et al. 2006) . Alternatively, these residues may form a combination of \u03b2-spiral repeats and \u03b1-helical coiled-coil, as suggested by sequence analysis (Chappell et al. 2002; Guglielmi et al. 2006; Nibert et al. 1990 ) and an observed narrowing in this region in a composite negative-stain electron micrograph (EM) (Fraser et al. 1990 ). The structure of the N-terminal tail, residues ~1-160, of \u03c31 is unknown. However, a repeating heptad sequence motif is predictive of an amphipathic \u03b1-helix, which likely assembles into an \u03b1-helical coiled-coil in the trimer (Chappell et al. 2002; Guglielmi et al. 2006; Nibert et al. 1990 ). The extreme N-terminus of \u03c31 does not contain any obvious sequence motifs. It is hydrophobic and anchors the protein into the pentameric turret formed by \u03bb2 in the reovirus virion (Dryden et al. 1993; Furlong et al. 1988 ). This symmetry mismatch suggests an interaction of limited strength, which may aid in \u03c31 release during viral disassembly .\n\nThe \u03c31 molecule possesses discrete regions of flexibility along its length (Chappell et al. 2002; Fraser et al. 1990) (Fig. 2) . One site of substantial flexibility in T3D \u03c31 is contributed by a four-residue insertion between the two most C-terminal \u03b2-spiral repeats (Cavalli et al. 2004; Chappell et al. 2002) . Sequence alignments suggest that \u03c31 of reovirus prototype strains T1L and T2J each contain a six-residue insertion at the same position (Chappell et al. 2002) . This insertion appears to correspond to a region of flexibility observed just below the \u03c31 head in EM images (Fraser et al. 1990) . A second region of flexibility observed at the midpoint of \u03c31 may correspond to the transition between the predicted \u03b1-helical coiled-coil region of the tail and the \u03b2-spiral-containing body, and a final region of flexibility close to the N-terminus likely represents the virion insertion domain (Chappell et al. 2002; Fraser et al. 1990; Guglielmi et al. 2006; Nibert et al. 1990 ).\n\nReovirus \u03c31 undergoes significant conformational alterations during viral disassembly (Dryden et al. 1993; Furlong et al. 1988; Nibert et al. 1995) . Some serotype 3 reoviruses, including T3D, can be cleaved by intestinal proteases (Nibert et al. 1995) . Cleavage occurs in the \u03c31 body (Chappell et al. 1998) , just N-terminal to the first \u03b2-spiral repeat in the crystal structure (Chappell et al. 2002) . This proteolytic cleavage enhances viral hemagglutination capacity, suggesting an unmasking or conformational change in the sialic acid (SA)-binding region of the molecule (Nibert et al. 1995) . This idea is supported by the observation of \u03c31 molecules with either single-or multilobed head regions (Fraser et al. 1990) , which suggests that \u03c31 may exist in both \"open\" and \"closed\" conformations.\n\nAlthough neither the precise mechanism nor the nature of \u03c31 conformational changes is understood, structural studies of \u03c31 provide clues about how these changes might occur. A cluster of six conserved aspartic acid residues on a rigid \u03b2-hairpin at the base of the \u03c31 head, sandwiched between hydrophobic residues that block access to solvent, forms the main contact area between monomers in the trimer (Chappell et al. 2002; Schelling et al. 2007 ). Of the two aspartic acid residues contributed by each monomer, one (Asp346) is neutralized by a salt-bridge interaction with a nearby residue, while the other (Asp345) is not (Chappell et al. 2002; Schelling et al. 2007 ). The three Asp345 side chains closely appose each other at the center of the trimer in an otherwise hydrophobic environment. Since accumulation of negative charge in this region is predicted to destabilize the trimer (Cavalli et al. 2004) , and a D345N mutation results in \u03c31 trimers with a structure indistinguishable from wild-type (Schelling et al. 2007) , it is likely that Asp345 is protonated in the \u03c31 crystal structure (Chappell et al. 2002) , representing the \"closed\" conformation of \u03c31. This conformation might form during crystallization at near-neutral pH and physiologically in conditions of low pH, similar to those encountered in the endocytic compartment during reovirus entry (Schelling et al. 2007 ). Thus, the aspartic acid sandwich motif may contribute to \u03c31 conformational rearrangements by acting as a molecular switch that mediates the oligomeric state of the \u03c31 head, depending on environmental pH (Schelling et al. 2007 ).\n\nSimilar to viruses from a broad array of families that use carbohydrates as receptors (Olofsson and Bergstrom 2005) , cell-surface SA serves as a receptor for several serotype 3 reovirus strains, including prototype strain T3D ( Barton et al. 2001a; Chappell et al. 2000; Pacitti 1985, 1987; Paul et al. 1989 ). T3D exhibits a reduced capacity to agglutinate erythrocytes following treatment with neuraminidase, which removes terminal SA moieties (Gentsch and Pacitti 1987) . Preincubation of either L cells with neuraminidase or virus with sialosides also significantly diminishes T3D binding (Gentsch and Pacitti 1985; Paul et al. 1989) . SA residues linked in either \u03b12,3 or \u03b12,6 configurations effectively block serotype 3 reovirus binding to L cells (Paul et al. 1989) . Reovirus T3D binds to sialoglycophorin, but not to asialoglycophorin, with an avidity of ~5 \u00d7 10 \u22129 M (Barton et al. 2001a), which is a property mediated by the \u03c31 protein (Chappell et al. 2000) . Thus, SA functions as a serotype 3 reovirus receptor in cultured cells. In addition, SA binding also serves an important role in reovirus tropism and pathogenesis in vivo (Barton et al. 2003 ). An SA-binding strain of reovirus, but not a non-SA-binding strain, causes bile duct injury in newborn mice and exhibits 1,000-fold greater binding capacity for human cholangiocarcinoma cells, which are derived from bile duct epithelium.\n\nAlthough the structure of \u03c31 in complex with SA is not yet available, studies using expressed proteins indicate that the region of T3D \u03c31 required for SA binding resides near the midpoint of the body, while a region just N-terminal to the head domain of T1L \u03c31 binds carbohydrate (Chappell et al. 2000) . For both T1L and T3D, interactions with carbohydrate are mediated by a region of predicted \u03b2-spiral (Chappell et al. 2002) . The capacity to bind SA is essential for reovirus infection of murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells (Chappell et al. 1997; Rubin et al. 1992 ). Adaptation of non-SA-binding reoviruses to growth in MEL cells results in amino acid substitutions at residues 198, 202, and 204 of \u03c31 that confer SAbinding capacity on the resultant viruses (Chappell et al. 1997) . Molecular modeling of the \u03c31 body, based on available structure and sequence data, suggests that these residues are surface-exposed and proximal to one another in the predicted \u03b2 -spiral region (Chappell et al. 2002). Thus, residues 198, 202, and 204 are likely to contribute to an SA-binding site in T3D \u03c31.\n\nIn addition to SA, reovirus also binds junctional adhesion molecule-A (JAM-A, also known as F11R/JAM/JAM1), a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily (Barton et al. 2001b; Martin-Padura et al. 1998; Williams et al. 1999) . JAM-A was identified as a reovirus receptor using a genetic screen and subsequently shown to bind directly to the \u03c31 head domain with nanomolar affinity (Barton et al. 2001b; Schelling et al. 2007 ). Human and murine homologs of JAM-A, but not JAM family members JAM-B or JAM-C, serve as receptors for all reovirus serotypes and strains tested to date (Barton et al. 2001b; Campbell et al. 2005; Prota et al. 2003) . The role of JAM-A as a reovirus receptor in vivo has been examined using JAM-A-null mice (Antar et al. 2009 ). Following peroral inoculation, JAM-A is dispensable for reovirus growth in the intestine. However, it is required for infection of vascular endothelial cells and promotes efficient hematogenous dissemination of reovirus to Danthi et al. Page 5 sites of secondary infection. Thus, JAM-A serves as a high-affinity reovirus receptor in cultured cells and in vivo.\n\nStructural and biochemical studies highlight the regions and specific interactions that mediate reovirus engagement of JAM-A (Campbell et al. 2005; Chappell et al. 2002; Forrest et al. 2003; Guglielmi et al. 2007; Kirchner et al. 2008; Prota et al. 2003) (Fig. 3) . The largest area of conserved residues in \u03c31 forms the D-E and F-G loops in the head domain (Campbell et al. 2005; Chappell et al. 2002) . The crystal structure of the T3D \u03c31 head domain in complex with the JAM-AD1 domain reveals that residues in this region, centered at the D-E loop and its 3 10 helix, form the largest area of JAM-A contact (Kirchner et al. 2008) . Interactions in this area are highly polar and involve residues Thr380, Gly381, and Asp382. A second, unpredicted area of JAM-A contact resides within the \u03c31 body, just Nterminal to the head domain. Interactions in this region are largely hydrophobic and involve \u03b2-spiral residues Tyr298 and Arg316, the \u03b1-helical turn that connects the \u03b2-spiral with the \u03b2barrel, and Pro377.\n\nThe D1 domain of JAM-A is required for high-affinity binding to \u03c31 Guglielmi et al. 2007; Prota et al. 2003) . Mutation of individual JAM-A D1 domain residues Arg59, Glu61, Lys63, Leu72, Tyr75, and Asn76, which lie in or adjacent to the dimer interface, diminishes or abolishes \u03c31 binding and reovirus infectivity ). Concordantly, the structure of the \u03c31-JAM-A complex shows that each \u03c31 trimer binds three independent JAM-A monomers (Kirchner et al. 2008) . Contacts primarily involve the JAM-A dimer interface and a conserved region at the base of the \u03c31 head (Chappell et al. 2002; Kirchner et al. 2008) (Fig. 3 ). In addition, the structure of the \u03c31-JAM-A complex also identifies residues bound by \u03c31 that are found just outside the dimer interface of JAM-A (Kirchner et al. 2008) . These residues may serve as initial contact points for \u03c31 and facilitate disruption of the JAM-A homodimer to allow interaction of \u03c31 with the JAM-A dimer interface. It is also possible that a cavity in the JAM-A dimer interface renders the homodimer intrinsically unstable, thereby promoting its disruption by \u03c31.\n\nRegardless of the mechanism, the \u03c31-JAM-A interaction is thermo-dynamically favored, as the K D is approximately 1,000-fold lower than the K D of the JAM-A homodimer interaction Kirchner et al. 2008 ).\n\nReovirus employs a multistep mechanism of viral attachment in which a low-affinity interaction with SA serves to tether the virion to target cells and precedes a high-affinity interaction with JAM-A ( Barton et al. 2001a ). This strategy for adhesion to host cells is used by members of unrelated virus families (Berger et al. 1999; Dragic et al. 1996; Montgomery et al. 1996; Ugolini et al. 1999) . In some cases, such as with HIV, initial receptor engagement leads to conformational changes in the viral attachment protein that permit coreceptor engagement (Sattentau and Moore 1991) . It is not known whether binding to SA induces structural changes in \u03c31, which affect its capacity to interact with JAM-A. However, it is clear that SA binding is not a necessary prerequisite for JAM-A binding, as non-SAbinding reoviruses are capable of binding JAM-A ( Barton et al. 2001b ).\n\nFollowing attachment to cell-surface carbohydrate and JAM-A, reovirus is internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis (Borsa et al. 1979 (Borsa et al. , 1981 Ehrlich et al. 2004; Maginnis et al. 2006 Maginnis et al. , 2008 Sturzenbecker et al. 1987) (Fig. 4) . Expression of a JAM-A truncation mutant lacking a cytoplasmic tail allows reovirus to infect nonpermissive cells (Maginnis et al. 2006) , suggesting that molecules other than JAM-A mobilize the internalization apparatus that promotes reovirus cell entry. Based on similarities in the structures of the reovirus and adenovirus attachment proteins and receptors , it was hypothesized that reovirus and adenovirus employ similar integrin-dependent internalization mechanisms to enter cells. In keeping with this hypothesis, reovirus \u03bb2 protein contains conserved integrin-binding motifs, RGD and KGE (Breun et al. 2001; Seliger et al. 1987) . These sequences are displayed on surface-exposed loops of \u03bb2 , where they could interact with integrins. Interestingly, the \u03bb2-encoding L2 gene segment is genetically linked to viral shedding in infected mice and spread to littermates (Keroack and Fields 1986) , suggesting a role for \u03bb2 in reovirus-induced disease.\n\nTreatment of cells with antibodies specific for \u03b21 integrin reduces reovirus infection, while antibodies specific for the other integrin subunits expressed on permissive cells, including those specific for \u03b1 integrin subunits, have no effect (Maginnis et al. 2006 ). However, antibodies specific for \u03b21 integrin do not alter infection by in-vitro generated infectious subvirion particles (ISVPs) (Maginnis et al. 2006) , which directly penetrate the plasma membrane and do not require endocytosis (Hooper and Fields 1996; Lucia-Jandris et al. 1993 ). These findings suggest that \u03b21 integrin blockade inhibits endocytic uptake of virions.\n\nIn comparison to \u03b21 integrin-expressing cells, \u03b21-null cells are substantially less susceptible to infection by reovirus virions, while infection by ISVPs is equivalent in both cell types (Maginnis et al. 2006) . Diminished reovirus replication in \u03b21-null cells correlates with diminished viral uptake (Fig. 5) , indicating that \u03b21 integrin is required for efficient reovirus cell entry.\n\nMost available evidence suggests that reovirus is internalized by a clathrin-dependent pathway (Borsa et al. 1979 (Borsa et al. , 1981 Ehrlich et al. 2004; Maginnis et al. 2008; Sturzenbecker et al. 1987) . Reovirus virions are observed to colocalize with clathrin in living cells (Ehrlich et al. 2004) , and treatment of cells with chlorpromazine, a clathrin-specific chemical inhibitor, inhibits reovirus internalization and infection (Maginnis et al. 2008 ). However, both clathrin-and caveolin-dependent mechanisms can be employed by some viruses to enter host cells (Laniosz et al. 2008; Querbes et al. 2006) . Although there are no published reports of clathrin-independent uptake strategies for reovirus, a role for caveolae in reovirus cell entry has not been conclusively excluded.\n\nNPXY motifs in the \u03b21 integrin cytoplasmic tail play a key role in sorting reovirus within the endocytic compartment. NPXY motifs are found in the cytoplasmic domains of many receptors (Chen et al. 1990; Davis et al. 1986; Oleinikov et al. 2000) and recruit adaptor protein 2 or disabled protein 2 (Morris and Cooper 2001; Oleinikov et al. 2000) to initiate clathrin assembly at the plasma membrane. Substitution of a tyrosine with a phenylalanine residue in either or both \u03b21 integrin NPXY motifs (NPXF) results in inefficient internalization of reovirus virions and diminished infectivity (Maginnis et al. 2008 ). Infection of cells expressing NPXF \u03b21 integrin results in distribution of virions to lysosomes where they are degraded, suggesting that the \u03b21 integrin NPXY motifs target reovirus to the precise endocytic organelle that permits functional disassembly. Cellular signaling networks that respond to reovirus and facilitate its uptake and endocytic transport are unknown.\n\nIn cellular endosomes, reovirus virions undergo stepwise disassembly to form discrete intermediates, the first of which is the ISVP (Borsa et al. 1981; Chang and Zweerink 1971; Silverstein et al. 1972; Sturzenbecker et al. 1987) (Figs. 1 and 4 ). ISVPs are characterized by the loss of \u03c33, a conformational change in \u03c31, and cleavage of \u03bc1 to form \u03b4 and \u03d5. The ratelimiting step in reovirus disassembly is the proteolytic removal of \u03c33 (Baer and Dermody 1997; Sturzenbecker et al. 1987) . Proteolysis of \u03c33 is dependent on acidic pH in some cell types (Dermody et al. 1993; Sturzenbecker et al. 1987 ) and endocytic cysteine proteases (Baer and . Cathepsins B and L catalyze reovirus disassembly in fibroblasts . Both enzymes are optimally active at acidic pH and serve functions in extracellular matrix formation, antigen presentation, and apoptosis (Chapman et al. 1997 ).\n\nThese enzymes also mediate cell entry of several other viruses, including Ebola virus (Chandran et al. 2005) , Hendra virus (Pager and Dutch 2005) , and SARS coronavirus (Huang et al. 2006) . Cathepsin S, a neutral pH cysteine protease required for processing internalized antigens (Riese et al. 1996) , mediates uncoating of some reovirus strains in a macrophage cell line (Golden et al. 2004) . It is possible that the broad tissue tropism displayed by reovirus is determined in part by the multiple host proteases capable of mediating its disassembly, analogous to highly pathogenic influenza viruses that disseminate systemically by utilization of alternative proteases for hemagglutinin processing (Goto and Kawaoka 1998; Stieneke-Grober et al. 1992 ).\n\nProteolytic enzymes also are required for reovirus infection following peroral inoculation of mice (Bass et al. 1990; Bodkin et al. 1989) . Reovirus virions are converted to ISVPs in the intestinal lumen by the resident serine proteases chymotrypsin and trypsin. ISVPs produced in this fashion infect intestinal M cells to allow systemic dissemination of reovirus in the host (Amerongen et al. 1994) . ISVPs generated by chymotrypsin or trypsin in vitro or in the gut lumen (Bass et al. 1990; Bodkin et al. 1989 ) are indistinguishable from ISVPs generated by cathepsin B or cathepsin L in vitro or in the endocytic compartment of cells (Baer et al. 1999; Ebert et al. 2002) .\n\nSequences in \u03c33 that influence its susceptibility to proteolysis have been identified through studies of viruses selected during persistent infection (PI viruses) or mutant viruses selected for resistance to either cysteine protease inhibitor E64 (D-EA viruses) (Ebert et al. 2001) or ammonium chloride (ACA-D viruses) (Clark et al. 2006 ). These viruses exhibit accelerated kinetics of disassembly and harbor a Tyr\u2192His mutation at amino acid 354 near the Cterminus of the protein (Clark et al. 2006; Ebert et al. 2001; Wetzel et al. 1997) (Fig. 6) . Cryo-EM image analysis of a PI virus with an isolated Y354H mutation reveals a structural alteration in \u03c33 at a hinge region located between its two major domains (Wilson et al. 2002) . These findings suggest that the C-terminus of \u03c33 regulates susceptibility of the protein to cleavage.\n\nThe \u03c33 C-terminus also dictates strain-specific differences in the susceptibility of \u03c33 to proteolytic attack (Jan\u00e9-Valbuena et al. 1999 . The \u03c33 protein of strain T1L is cleaved more rapidly than that of T3D. Analysis of ISVPs recoated with chimeric \u03c33 proteins generated from T1L and T3D revealed that the C-terminus is primarily responsible for the rate of \u03c33 proteolysis. Moreover, sequence polymorphisms at residues 344, 347, and 353 in \u03c33 contribute to this effect (Jan\u00e9-Valbuena et al. 2002) .\n\nTreatment of reovirus virions in vitro with either cathepsin B or cathepsin L leads to an initial cleavage of \u03c33 at a terminus . Since sequence polymorphisms in the \u03c33 C-terminus determine susceptibility to proteolysis, the initial cleavage of \u03c33 probably occurs in this region. During proteolysis by cathepsin L, subsequent cleavages occur between residues 243-244 and 250-251 (Fig. 6a) . These cleavage sites are physically located near the C-terminus in the \u03c33 crystal structure (Olland et al. 2001 ) (Fig. 6b, c) . Because of this proximity, the small end fragment released following initial cathepsin L cleavage likely exposes the cleavage sites between residues 243-244 and 250-251, rendering them sensitive to proteolysis. The C-terminus therefore appears to control access to internal, proteolytically sensitive sites in \u03c33. Because reovirus disassembly in some cell types is acid-dependent (Dermody et al. 1993; Sturzenbecker et al. 1987 ), the Cterminus might be primed for movement at acidic pH. Mutations near the C-terminus, like Y354H, may alter the conformation of the protein to allow improved access to these cleavage sites and thus accelerate outer capsid disassembly (Wilson et al. 2002) . Highresolution structural analysis of Y354H-\u03c33, which is currently ongoing, will enhance an understanding of \u03c33 proteolysis.\n\nStudies to assess the capacity of reovirus entry intermediates to penetrate artificial lipid bilayers, model membranes of erythrocytes, or membranes of cells that support reovirus infection indicate that ISVPs but not virions or cores mediate membrane penetration (Borsa et al. 1979; Chandran and Nibert 1998; Chandran et al. 1999 Chandran et al. , 2001 Hooper and Fields 1996; Lucia-Jandris et al. 1993; Tosteson et al. 1993) . Such studies led to the idea that ISVPs or a related subviral particle is the membrane-active intermediate in the reovirus entry pathway. Since ISVPs differ from cores by the presence of outer-capsid proteins \u03c31 and \u03bc1 (Coombs 1998; Dryden et al. 1993) , and because cores recoated in vitro with \u03bc1 alone are capable of membrane penetration (Chandran et al. 1999) , these findings point to a role for the \u03bc1 protein in membrane penetration. This biochemical evidence is also supported by several genetic studies. Differences in membrane-penetration efficiency displayed by reovirus strains T1L and T3D segregate with the \u03bc1-encoding M2 gene segment Lucia-Jandris et al. 1993) . Additionally, viruses selected for resistance to denaturants such as ethanol contain mutations within the M2 gene segment and display alterations in membrane penetration capacity Danthi et al. 2008b; Hooper and Fields 1996; Wessner and Fields 1993) . Together, these data demonstrate a function for the \u03bc1 protein in membrane penetration.\n\nThe \u03bc1 protein folds into four distinct domains (Fig. 7a) . Domains I, II, and III are primarily \u03b1-helical and show no homology with other proteins. Domain IV forms a jelly-roll \u03b2-barrel commonly found in the capsid proteins of many non-enveloped viruses (Harrison 2001) . This domain interacts extensively with similar domains of the neighboring \u03bc1 molecules and with \u03c33. The \u03bc1 protein also contains three proteolytic cleavage sites (Fig. 7b) . These include an autocatalytic cleavage site at amino acid 42, which separates \u03bc1N and \u03bc1C, a cleavage site at approximately amino acid 580, which releases the \u03b4 and \u03d5 fragments, and a cleavage site at the C-terminus that releases an ~10 amino acid peptide Mendez et al. 2003; Nibert and Fields 1992; Odegard et al. 2004) . While the physiologic roles of both the \u03b4\u2212\u03d5 and the C-terminal cleavages are unclear, studies using reovirus cores recoated with a \u03bc1N\u2212 \u03bc1C cleavage-resistant \u03bc1 mutant indicate that cleavage of \u03bc1 to generate \u03bc1N and \u03bc1C is required for membrane penetration and virion infectivity (Odegard et al. 2004 ). Since \u03bc1N is released from viral particles, it is postulated that cleavage of \u03bc1 is required for release of \u03bc1N, which then interacts with membranes as a function of its myristate moiety to effect membrane penetration (Ivanovic et al. 2008 ). The requirement for the release of a small hydrophobic peptide for membrane penetration is strikingly similar to the entry mechanisms employed by other nonenveloped viruses such as adenoviruses (Wiethoff et al. 2005) , nodaviruses (Schneemann et al. 1992; Walukiewicz et al. 2008) , and picornaviruses (Danthi et al. 2003 ).\n\nIn the native \u03bc1 structure present in virions and ISVPs, the myristoylated \u03bc1N fragment is buried inside a hydrophobic cavity in the \u03b1-helical pedestal formed by portions of domains I, II, and III (Liemann et al. 2002; Zhang et al. 2005) . Based on these studies, massive conformational rearrangements resulting in unwinding of the \u03bc1 trimer must be required to release \u03bc1N during cell entry (Liemann et al. 2002; Zhang et al. 2006) . Evidence for conformational changes in particle-associated \u03bc1 following interaction of ISVPs with membranes or when exposed to high salt concentrations has led to the identification of an ISVP-like entry intermediate in the reovirus cell entry pathway . This intermediate, referred to as ISVP*, is characterized by changes in the conformation of the \u03bc1 \u03b4 fragment, loss of the \u03c31 protein, and an increase in the overall hydrophobicity of the particle . Thus, the \u03bc1 protein associated with ISVPs is in a metastable state primed to undergo conformational changes to assume a more hydrophobic structure capable of interaction with membranes. While it is not understood how these conformational changes in \u03bc1 are triggered, it is thought that interaction of an anion-binding site in domain IV with phospholipid head groups in endosomal membranes might trigger the requisite rearrangements in \u03bc1 that reveal the myristoylated \u03bc1N and the internal hydrophobic residues (Liemann et al. 2002) . At high particle concentrations, ISVP* conversion is regulated by a positive feedback mechanism in which \u03bc1N, which is released during ISVP* formation, promotes ISVP-to-ISVP* conversion of the remaining particles (Agosto et al. 2008). Acceleration of ISVP* formation by \u03bc1N is dependent on temperature and target flexibility, suggesting that particle dynamics are required to expose a \u03bc1N interaction domain (Agosto et al. 2008). Since such particle concentrations are unlikely to be achieved following a low multiplicity viral infection, it remains unclear how these findings translate to ISVP* formation in cellular endosomes during viral entry.\n\nGenetic studies using ethanol-resistant or thermostable mutants indicate that \u03bc1 residues affecting the overall stability of the virus also regulate membrane-penetration efficiency Danthi et al. 2008b; Hooper and Fields 1996; Wessner and Fields 1993) . These and other stability-altering residues identified in thermostable reovirus mutants (Middleton et al. 2007 ) are located between residues 383 and 612 of \u03bc1 and map to either domain IV that forms the jelly-roll \u03b2-barrel or the \u03b1-helical portions of domain III that lie just below the \u03b2-barrel structure. Since these \u03bc1 domains participate in interactions between neighboring \u03bc1 monomers, these residues are thought to modulate viral stability by preventing unwinding of the \u03bc1 trimer (Liemann et al. 2002) . Consistent with an increase in \u03bc1 protein rigidity in ethanol-resistant and thermostable mutants, viral cores recoated with mutant \u03bc1 proteins, or recombinant reoviruses containing single amino acid substitutions in \u03bc1 in an otherwise wild-type background, display diminished ISVP-to-ISVP* conversion and have defects in membrane penetration (Wessner and Fields 1993; Hooper and Fields 1996; Chandran et al. 2002; Middleton et al. 2007; Danthi et al. 2008a, b) (Fig. 7c, d) . These studies suggest that a central region of \u03bc1 involved in intermolecular interactions is an important regulator of the ISVP-to-ISVP* transition. In addition to these residues, changes in the C-terminal \u03d5 fragment also control viral stability (Middleton et al. 2007 ) and affect membrane penetration by reducing the efficiency of ISVP-to-ISVP* conversion (Danthi et al. 2008a ). While it is not clear how \u03d5 residues modulate these properties, since both \u03bc1N and \u03d5 are released from the virus particle during ISVP* formation (Ivanovic et al. 2008) , it is likely that conformational rearrangements in \u03bc1 during ISVP* formation are not restricted to the \u03b4 domain but also involve the \u03bc1N and \u03d5 domains. Therefore, amino acid substitutions within \u03d5 that negatively affect its conformational flexibility would likely prevent the \u03bc1 reorganization required for ISVP* formation. Biochemical and structural characterization of additional mutant viruses that may be affected to varying degrees in the capacity to undergo \u03bc1 conformational changes may identify as yet unknown intermediates during ISVP-to-ISVP* conversion and offer insights into mechanisms that promote the elaborate remodeling of \u03bc1 required for membrane penetration.\n\nAnalogous to the picornaviruses (Danthi et al. 2003) , reovirus forms small, size-selective pores in erythrocyte model membranes (Agosto et al. 2006) . Both \u03bc1N and ISVP*s associate with erythrocyte membranes (Agosto et al. 2006; Ivanovic et al. 2008 ), but \u03bc1N is capable of pore formation in the absence of other viral components (Ivanovic et al. 2008) . While \u03d5 also associates with membranes (Ivanovic et al. 2008 ), its recruitment does not result in membrane penetration. These findings are consistent with the observation that viruses incapable of \u03b4-\u03d5 cleavage can penetrate membranes and are fully infectious (Chandran and Nibert 1998; Chandran et al. 1999 ). Since pore formation by \u03bc1N is enhanced by the presence of \u03d5, it is possible that \u03d5 functions as a \u03bc1N chaperone and facilitates membrane penetration by reovirus (Ivanovic et al. 2008 Both the viral core and the \u03b4 fragment of \u03bc1 are found in the cytoplasm following reovirus entry into host cells . While \u03b4 is found distributed diffusely throughout the cytosol, viral cores display a more punctuate cytoplasmic localization . These observations suggest that the \u03b4 fragment disassociates from the ISVP* either during or immediately after membrane penetration. This idea is supported by the evidence that reovirus cores are transcriptionally active in the cytoplasm and that activation of transcription requires complete removal of the \u03bc1 fragments. Removal of \u03b4 from cores is thought to be accomplished by direct interaction of \u03b4 with the host chaperone Hsc70 via an ATP-dependent process (Ivanovic et al. 2007 ). Based on the finding that chaperones can translocate proteins across membranes (Young et al. 2004) , it is possible that concomitant with removal of particle-associated \u03b4, Hsc70 also aids in transport of the viral core across membranes (Ivanovic et al. 2007) . Additional experiments are required to reveal the precise mechanism by which host membranes are breached by reovirus.\n\nApoptosis induction by reovirus requires activation of innate immune transcription factors NF-\u03baB and IRF-3 (Connolly et al. 2000; Hansberger et al. 2007; Holm et al. 2007 ) (Fig. 8) . In cultured cells, reovirus-induced apoptosis does not require de novo synthesis of viral RNA and protein (Connolly and Dermody 2002; Danthi et al. 2006) , indicating that the proapoptotic stimulus is contained within infecting viral capsids. Consistent with these findings, strain-specific differences in the capacity of reovirus to induce apoptosis segregate genetically with the viral S1 and M2 gene segments (Connolly et al. 2001; Tyler et al. 1995 Tyler et al. , 1996 , which encode \u03c31 and \u03bc1, respectively (McCrae and Joklik 1978; Mustoe et al. 1978) . Antibodydependent uptake of reovirus virions in an entry process that does not require JAM-A and SA leads to apoptotic cell death, indicating that signaling pathways triggered by \u03c31-receptor interactions are dispensable for reovirus-induced apoptosis (Danthi et al. 2006) . Regardless of the receptors used to mediate attachment, initiation of prodeath signaling following reovirus infection requires viral disassembly in cellular endosomes (Danthi et al. 2006) , suggesting an essential function for the \u03bc1 protein in apoptosis induction.\n\nIntroduction of single amino acid substitutions into the \u03b4 region of \u03bc1 decreases the capacity of the resultant mutant viruses to effect membrane penetration, mobilize NF-\u03baB, and evoke apoptosis (Danthi et al. 2008b) (Fig. 8c) . These findings suggest that the membranepenetration and apoptosis induction-functions of \u03bc1 are linked and that the \u03b4 region of \u03bc1 is an essential modulator of both processes (Danthi et al. 2008b) . It is possible that membrane penetration directly initiates proapoptotic signals. Alternatively, membrane penetration might allow delivery of the \u03bc1 cleavage fragments into the cytoplasm where prodeath signaling is elicited. Two lines of evidence support the latter possibility. First, plasmiddriven expression of the \u03bc1 \u03d5 domain in the cytoplasm is sufficient to induce apoptosis (Coffey et al. 2006) . Second, recombinant viruses with engineered substitutions within \u03d5 are diminished in NF-\u03baB activation and apoptosis (Danthi et al. 2008a) (Fig. 8d) . Importantly, a membrane-penetration-proficient \u03d5 mutant is impaired in the capacity to activate prodeath signaling, indicating that \u03d5 modulates apoptosis independent of an effect on membrane penetration (Danthi et al. 2008a ). Based on these findings, it appears likely that cytoplasmic delivery of \u03d5 subsequent to membrane penetration initiates prodeath signaling following reovirus infection (Danthi et al. 2008a ).\n\nIRF-3 activation following reovirus infection requires the RIG-I pathogen sensor and the IPS-1 adaptor protein ). Interestingly, unlike other viral systems, these host proteins are dispensable for reovirus-induced NF-\u03baB activation ). Since activation of IRF-3 also does not require viral RNA synthesis and occurs during viral entry, it is thought that viral genomic dsRNA triggers these signaling pathways ). Empty reovirus particles devoid of genome can stimulate NF-\u03baB but not IRF-3, providing additional support for the idea that NF-\u03baB and IRF-3 are activated following reovirus infection via distinct mechanisms (Connolly et al. 2000; Holm et al. 2007 ). Since reovirus empty particles are capable of eliciting apoptosis (Connolly and Dermody 2002) but do not lead to IRF-3 activation ), IRF-3 appears to play a contributory but nonessential role in reovirus-induced apoptosis. Precise mechanisms by which the products of reovirus disassembly activate innate immune response signaling networks are unknown.\n\nThe process of cell entry is poorly understood for many pathogenic viruses. This gap in knowledge has been a significant impediment to the rational design of antiviral agents and vaccines that target distinct steps in the entry process. Studies of mammalian reovirus have uncovered discrete attachment and internalization receptors, a function for cathepsin proteases in disassembly, an intricate mechanism for protein-membrane interactions, and a framework for activation of innate immune response signaling. Many of these functions are shared by other viral pathogens, suggesting conserved mechanisms of cell entry that should be amenable to common therapeutic approaches. However, there is much more to learn.\n\nThe current model of \u03c31-JAM-A interactions at the cell surface suggests that structural characteristics of \u03c31 may facilitate concurrent engagement of JAM-A and carbohydrates by appropriately positioning the receptor-binding domains. Indeed, studies of adenovirus fiber, which is structurally homologous to \u03c31 , have highlighted the importance of length and flexibility in viral tropism (Wu et al. 2003) . However, the contributions of \u03c31 length and flexibility to reovirus receptor engagement have not been explored. In the structure of a \u03c31-JAM-A complex, the \u03c31 head forms a trimer. Yet, there is evidence to suggest that \u03c31 may at times exist in a partially detrimerized conformation (Fraser et al. 1990; Schelling et al. 2007 ). An improved understanding of the role of the unusual aspartic acid sandwich trimerization motif may lend insight into the contributions of trimer instability to reovirus attachment and entry.\n\nReovirus serotypes display striking differences in pathogenesis that are directly linked to \u03c31 (Tyler et al. 1986; Weiner et al. 1977 Weiner et al. , 1980 . However, each of the reovirus serotypes uses JAM-A as a receptor (Campbell et al. 2005) . Considering previous studies of reovirus interactions with JAM-A and carbohydrates, we think there are three possible explanations of \u03c31-mediated serotype-specific differences in reovirus tropism and disease. First, the carbohydrate specificity of a particular strain of reovirus might direct infection to specific cells or tissues. In support of this idea, serotype 3 reovirus strains that vary in SA utilization also vary in disease pathogenesis in the hepatobiliary system (Barton et al. 2003) . While there is some evidence that T1L binds SA in intestinal loops (Helander et al. 2003) , the exact nature of the carbohydrate coreceptors used by reovirus serotypes 1 and 2 remains undefined. Second, variations in the interaction kinetics or affinity of a particular \u03c31 serotype for JAM-A might contribute to differences in tropism. While there is overlap among JAM-A residues required for reovirus T1L, T2J, and T3D binding, there is evidence that the binding sites in JAM-A for these viruses differ ). Furthermore, sequence alignments reveal that the residues in T3D \u03c31 that contact JAM-A in the complex (Kirchner et al. 2008) are not entirely conserved among reoviruses of all serotype (Campbell et al. 2005; Chappell et al. 2002) . On a cell that expresses only low levels of JAM-A, differences in receptor interaction kinetics or affinity might determine whether or not reovirus can initiate infection. Third, JAM-A might serve as a serotype-independent reovirus receptor at some sites within the host, and other, as yet unidentified, receptors confer serotype-dependent tropism in the central nervous system. Indeed, studies using non-SAbinding reovirus to infect JAM-A-null mice provide support for this hypothesis and point specifically to the existence of unidentified receptors in both the intestine and the central nervous system (Antar et al. 2009 ). Future exploration of each of these possibilities will help clarify the role of \u03c31 in reovirus pathogenesis.\n\nInternalization of reovirus requires \u03b21 integrin (Maginnis et al. 2006 ), but it is not known whether reovirus directly engages \u03b21 integrin to initiate internalization or induces interactions between JAM-A (or other receptors) and \u03b21 integrin to activate the uptake machinery. Furthermore, it is unclear whether activation of signaling pathways is required to trigger reovirus internalization by \u03b21 integrin. Studies using mutant \u03b21 integrin constructs suggest that NPXY motifs within \u03b21 integrin direct transport of reovirus to the subcellular compartment for disassembly and membrane penetration (Maginnis et al. 2008) . However, the composition of the endocytic machinery recruited by the NPXY motifs that directs reovirus to the appropriate endocytic organelle for disassembly is yet to be identified. Since early steps in reovirus replication influence several stages of reovirus-host interactions (Virgin et al. 1997) , it is possible that engagement of \u03b21 integrin influences reovirus pathogenesis. However, a function for \u03b21 integrin in reovirus disease is unproven.\n\nDisassembly of reovirus, which results in proteolytic removal of the \u03c33 outer-capsid protein, is essential for exposure of the viral membrane-penetration apparatus. While this process must be precisely controlled to ensure efficient infection, mechanisms that underlie this regulation are not understood. It is not known whether the low pH environment of the endocytic compartment is merely required for optimal activity of endocytic proteases that catalyze reovirus disassembly or also functions to trigger the conformational changes in \u03c33 that lead to its degradation. The \u03c33 protein contains multiple cathepsin protease cleavage sites that may be sequentially employed to facilitate its timely removal . However, it is not known whether a temporal pattern of cleavage site utilization exists for \u03c33. Cathepsins B and L are expressed in the intestine, liver, heart, and brain (Turk et al. 2001) , which serve as sites for reovirus infection in newborn mice (Barton et al. 2003; O'Donnell et al. 2005) . Cathepsin S is largely restricted to cells and tissues of the immune system (Chapman et al. 1997) , which may influence reovirus replication in Peyer's patches during enteric infection (Fleeton et al. 2004; Morrison et al. 1991) . Definition of cathepsin function in reovirus pathogenesis awaits the results of ongoing studies of reovirus infection using cathepsin-deficient mice.\n\nRecent studies have provided important insights into mechanisms by which reovirus mediates membrane penetration. While a few residues within \u03bc1 \u03b4 and \u03d5 that regulate conformational changes required for membrane penetration have been identified by analysis of mutant viruses Danthi et al. 2008a, b) , it is not known how the conformational alterations of the membrane-penetration apparatus liberate \u03bc1N, which mediates membrane penetration (Ivanovic et al. 2008) . Additionally, the domains of \u03bc1 reorganized during disassembly are only partially identified. The mechanism by which interaction of \u03bc1N with the membrane results in pore formation and how its pore-forming capacity is enhanced by its interaction with \u03d5 also remain to be elucidated (Agosto et al. 2006; Ivanovic et al. 2008) . Finally, it is not apparent how formation of small pores in membranes results in translocation of the reovirus core across the membrane.\n\nEarly steps in reovirus infection activate innate immune response transcription factors NF-\u03baB and IRF-3 (Connolly et al. 2000; Holm et al. 2007) , which drive the apoptotic response following reovirus infection (Connolly et al. 2000; Hansberger et al. 2007; Holm et al. 2007; O'Donnell et al. 2006) . The activation of NF-\u03baB is modulated by the \u03bc1 \u03d5 domain subsequent to membrane penetration (Danthi et al. 2008a ). However, the precise mechanism by which \u03bc1 \u03d5 evokes NF-\u03baB activation is unclear. Neither the fate of the \u03d5 fragment following entry of reovirus into host cells nor the cellular sensors that detect \u03d5 to trigger the prodeath function of NF-\u03baB is known. Activation of IRF-3 following reovirus infection is dependent on the recognition of viral genomic dsRNA by RIG-I and IPS-1 ), but how the genomic dsRNA escapes from the viral core for detection by RIG-I is not evident.\n\nIn addition to enhancing an understanding of fundamental aspects of entry mechanisms employed by nonenveloped viruses, studies of reovirus cell entry are also pertinent to the development of optimal reovirus-based oncolytic and vaccine vectors. Reovirus infects transformed cells much more efficiently than it does nontransformed cells (Duncan et al. 1978 ). Based on initial success in using reovirus for tumor killing in animal models (Coffey et al. 1998; Hirasawa et al. 2002) , reovirus is currently undergoing clinical trials as a virotherapeutic for aggressive and refractory human tumors (Stoeckel and Hay 2006) . Since reovirus undergoes primary replication in intestinal tissue with few or no symptoms in humans (Tai et al. 2005) and is now amenable to genetic modification (Kobayashi et al. 2007) , it also is an excellent candidate for development of a multifunctional vaccine modality to elicit mucosal immunity. Therefore, understanding the precise mechanisms by which reovirus attaches to host cells and initiates an infectious cycle will allow reovirus to be strategically engineered to facilitate retargeting to distinct host cells or enhance the efficiency of cell entry for a variety of therapeutic applications.
