{"title": "Archives of Virology. Human Enteric Coronav[ruses Brief Review", "body": "Coronaviruses are a group of lipid containing, enveloped RNA viruses with distinctive surface projections (44, 53, 65) . They cause serious infections in many animal species, including hepatitis and encephalitis in mice, bronchitis in chickens, encephMomyelitis in piglets and severe gastroenteritis in neonatal calves, piglets and dogs. In contrast, all of the more than 20 coronavirus strains so far positively isolated from man are in association with mild upper respiratory tract infections.\n\nSince 1975, a number of reports have identified coronavirus-like particles (CVLPs) in faecal specimens from adults and children suffering from gastroenteritis and also from healthy subjects: these have been summarized previously (21, 29, 40) . Similar particles have been found in faecal samples from a number of animals. In all these studies, the presence of CVLPs was not clearly associated with disease and the particles were characterized as coronavirus-like entirely on their morphology, particularly the possession of surface projections approximately 20 nm long. The particles were pleomorphic and usually much larger than coronaviruses grown in cell culture. Although many attempts have been made to grow human CVLPs in organ and tissue cultures, all attempts have failed with the exception of two laboratories which have reported their growth either in organ cultures (ll, 12) or in tissue cultures (35, 61) , but both these reports require confirmation.\n\nIn this review, we describe the identification and classification of CVLPs from faecal material. A comparison is made between these particles and well-recognized coronaviruses. The relationship of CVLPs with disease and the apparent growth of CVLPs in culture are also discussed. A new evaluation is made of available data to consider whether some or any CVLPs should be classified as human enteric coronaviruses (HECVs). The length of the surface projections is in the range 20--46 nlTl (12, 37, 43, 56, 6I) : they usually comprise a round or oval knob attached to the particle by a thin stalk (12, 37, 43, 56, 61) . Some projections possess an additional T-shaped structure at the distal end which yields an overall length of 44 nm (43, 56) . The morphological appearance cau vary according to the negative stain used (9): only the round or oval knobs of the surface projections are visible using ammonium molybdate and the envelope appears penetrated when uranyl acetate is used. I t is recommended that a standard stain should be used, for example 1.5 per cent potassium phosphotnngstate at p i t 6.5.\n\nFringed particles, presumably fragments of cell membranes (9) , are frequently observed in faecal extracts. Care should be taken when analysing faecal samples to differentiate these cell membranes from CVLPs ; CArL et al. (9) have adequately described how CVLPs can be distinguished from fringed particles.\n\nNumerous studies have described the identification of CVLPs in the faeces of adults and children with and without gastroenteritis. These include reports from Australia (48, 56, 57) , Costa Riea (42), France (61), Gambia (54), Germany (4, 37) , Gilbert Islands (29) , India (41, 43) , Japan (64) and the United Kingdom (11, 15, 54, 69, 71) . Many of the reports suggest that it is difficult to attribute a causa\u00a2ive role to the CVLPs, as healthy individuals also shed CVLPs (t6, 43, 54, 56, 57) . This is confused further by patients who shed CVLPs for periods of several months after the cessation of symptoms (16, 43, 48, 57) , indicating that CVLPs may cause a chronic infection.\n\nThe occurrence of CVLPs varies greatly depending on the population studied. For example, CVLPs were found in nearly all faecal specimens examined from selected villages in the rural population of South India. They were not associated with any specific disease as they were found in heMthy children and adults and in patients with chronic tropical sprue (43) . The distribution of these particles in the population may reflect the frequency of intestinal morphological abnormalities and mMabsorption in the symptom-free population of Southern India (43) , or chronic excretion that continues after an episode of tropical sprue (MATHA~, personal communication). In rural Gambia, CVLPs were only observed in the faeces of a few children and their presence was not obviously related to diarrhoea (54) . CVLPs have also been detected in the stools of Aboriginal children in Australia, with equal frequency in control and diarrhoeal individuals (56, 57) . Thus these particles were clearly not associated with acute disease. However there may be a link in the more chronic cases of gastroenteritis found amongst AboriginMs.\n\nIn contrast, CVLPs have not been observed in most gastroenteritis studies carried out in Europe, Canada and the United States (21, 29, 40) . In addition, where reported, they have only been observed in the faeces of relatively few patients with gastroenteritis (t6, 54, 56, 57) . Furthermore, some of those patients shedding CVLPs have recently come from developing countries (54) , where shedding of CVLPs in faeces is more common. It has been suggested from two studies (16, 48) that patients suffering from gastroenteritis in institutions for the mentally subnormal or psycho-geriatric units were more likely than normal individuals to shed CVLPs in their faeces, although a causal role could not be attributed to them (14) . CVLPs have been detected in particularly acute outbreaks of gastroenteritis in a premature baby unit in Germany (37) and necrotizing enteroeolitis in a maternity unit in France (61) in which a number of the babies died. In the latter ease CVLPs were shed in the faeces of a high proportion of the babies.\n\nIt is not really clear what association CVLPs have with disease as there is much conflicting evidence. A report from the United Kingdom has shown that similar numbers of individuals with and without diarrhoea shed CVLPs in their faeces (16) . However, CVLPs appear to be more frequently excreted by individuals 20* in the non-Aboriginal population of Australia with diarrhoea than those with no diarrhoea (57) .\n\nCVLPs, identified by electron microscopy in the faeces of neonates with necrotising enterocolitis in France (61), have been shown to replicate in H R T 18 cells, a cell-line derived from a human rectal adenoeareinoma (34, 35, 36, 61) , although titres of infectious virus were not reported. These CVLPs have been considered by the authors to represent an HECV. No CPE was produced by the presumptive HECV in these cells, but, immunofluoreseenee could be demonstrated using labelled antiserum against bovine enteric coronavirus (BECV). BECV has also been grown in HRT18 cells in this laboratory (35) and it has been suggested by some workers that the human isolates may be BECV derived from a laboratory contamination as virus cross-contamination of tissue cultures ca.n sometimes occur. At present it is difficult to confirm this suggestion. On the other hand, BECV has apparently been transmitted from infected calves to a, laboratory worker with ensuing gastroenteritis (59) and antibodies to BECV have also been detected in human sere (58, 59) . Fig. 2b which shows particles surrounded by two sets of surface projections; one set, 17--23 nm long, are slightly bulbous at the distal end and the shorter ones are 5--10 nm long and not individually distinct. The particles usually have a small central electron-dense area. The morphology of these particles is similar to BECV (LAPoBTE, personal communication, 7), but the particles found in faeces from cases of neerotising enteroeolitis (61) appear to bear no resemblance to those found in tissue culture fluid.\n\nFaecM specimens from fifteen patients containing CVLPs were inoculated by CAuI~ et el. (11, 12) into primary human embryo kidney monolayers and evidence of replication was observed by electron microscopy of tissue culture fluids and indirect immunoflnorescence on the cells (11, 12) . They reported that only one culture showed fluorescence using the patients' own convalescent serum. The intraeellular changes observed were similar to those in eoronavirus replication. This faecal extract was inoculated into human foetal intestinal organ cultures: a tenfold increase in the number of particles was found in the organ culture fluids at 24 hours compared with a 6 hour harvest. However, they were unable to passage material from this culture in cultures derived from several different human embryo kidneys. The morphology of the particles from the organ culture fluid was different, from that, of the particles found in faecal extracts in that they were less pleomorphie and no T-shaped structures were seen on the surface projections (Fig. 2 a) . Some particles did not exhibit the electron-lucent rim described eaNier.\n\nThe ultrastructural changes described in the columnar epithelial cells inoculated with these particles (12, 16) are in agreement with the published morphogenesis of eoronaviruses (44) . BRIDeE~ et al. (7) have described the morphogenesis of BECV in bovine foetal intestinal organ culture and many ultrastruetural changes that they observed are similar to those of the CVLPs grown in organ culture. Tubular filaments of 9--10 nm in diameter, previously undeseribed, were found by C~.uL et al. (12) and these were proposed as being viral nueleoeapsids. This is not in disagreement with the dimensions of nueteocapsids quoted for known coronaviruses (10, 32, 38) . Furthermore, they also found cytoplasmic inclusion bodies composed of tubules of 32 nm diameter which have also been found in cells infected with eoronaviruses (19, 44) . \"Virus factories\" have been described in BECV infected intestines by Do~TG~I et al. (t9) where areas within the cytoplasm, with or without a surrounding membrane, contain dense granular fibrillar matrix with virus cores inside; virus cores are also found in the distended endoplasmie retieulum. This feature was not described by C~uL et al. (12) or BRInGeR et al. (7) . The evidence for the replication of the CVLPs presented by these authors appears convincing, although only one CVLP preparation showed this. Further studies arc required to confirm this replication.\n\nA number of eoronaviruses have been identified that cause a variety of enteric diseases in animals (44, 65) and include canine eoronavirus (CCV), a mouse hepatitis virus strain that cause lethal enteritis in infant mice (26) , BECV and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus. These eoronaviruses have been grown in tissue culture, shown on inoculation to cause enteric disease in the neonate and to have the morphological and biochemical characteristics of coronaviruses.\n\nHowever, in recent years there have been several reports of CVLPs in faecal samples from a number of animals including dogs (55, 72) , monkeys (13) , eats (30), sheep (68), rabbits (33) and calves (47) . These CVLPs were morphologically similar to those found in human faeces, and as with hmnan CVLPs they could not be shown to be involved in enteric disease. The CVLPs isolated in dogs (55, 72) and cats (30) are morphologieMly different from CCV (2, 31, 62) and a feline coronavirus that is closely related to feline infectious peritonitis virus (50) , which both produce enteritis in their hosts. One report (72) has described the occurrence of typical eoronavirus particles and CVLPs, together with astroviruses and parvoviruses, in the same diarrheal stools of pups. It. is interesting to note that only the CVLPs continued to be excreted after the cessation of diarrhoea and that convaleseent sera obtained from the pups aggregated all the particles, except the CVLPs. The authors suggest that CVLPs may be antigenicMly altered coronavirus particles which thus are unable to react with the convalescent sera.\n\nUp to now CVLPs have been considered to be coronaviruses primarily on morphology, and there have been few published critical comparison between them and coronaviruses. The two types of CVLPs that have been described consist of CVLPs from faeces of children and adults and CVLPs from faeces of neonates grown in tissue culture. Particles representative of negatively stained preparations of human eoronavirus strain 229E (HCV229E), CVLPs from faeces and CVLPs grown in tissue culture are sho~vn in Fig. 3, Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 b respectively. The morphology of CVLPs from neonates grown in tissue culture (Fig. 2 b) show many similarities to HCV 229E (Fig. 3) , such as size and pleomorphism. It is difficult to compare the surface projections of these CVLPs to eoronaviruses as the morphology of the surface projections of coronaviruses can vary (18) . However, the tissue culture grown CVLPs possess two sets of projections of which one set is bulbous, resembling closely the projections of BECV (LAroa'r~, personal communication, 7). Morphologically, these CVLPs appear to be eoronaviruses.\n\nOn the other hand, there are a number of significant differences between CVLPs from faeces of adults and children (Fig. 1) and coronaviruses (Fig. 3) . Although both particle types show a degree of pleomorphism, these CVLPs often show extreme pleomorphism. The surface projections of CVLPs and coronaviruses (44, 65) have a similar distribution with lengths of approximately 20 nm. However, the shape of the CVLP projections differ from that of coronaviruses in that the former are thin projections with knobs at the distal end or occasionally with additional T-shapes (9, 12) , while eoronavirus projections of this structure have not been published and are usually bulbous (18) . The envelope of most CVLPs appears densely stained except for a thin, ill-defined, unstained rim and pate]by areas around the periphery. A rim structure, which is sharply defined, has been described in penetrated particles of BECV (60) , avian infectious bronchitis virus (5) and some CVLPs (14) . Most reports describe typical eoronavirus particles as having an envelope with a small central electron-dense area or \"dimple\" (44) . Some of the CVLPs from the organ culture fluid have an envelope structure that resembles that of eoronaviruses (12) : an example is shown in Fig. 2a . The ultrastructure of pelleted CVLPs from faeces has not been compared with that of coronaviruses. This is a difficult task as the internal structure of sectioned coronaviruses varies between strains (44). Fig. 4 shows an ultrathin section of pelleted, purified IICV 229E particles (Fig. ga) and purified CVLPs (Fig. 4b) . Both particle types have a distinct trilamellar membrane envelope, although HCV229E possesses an internal electron-dense area which most CVLPs do not. (14, 20) . I-Iowever, a small proportion of CVLPs have been shown to contain internal structures (14): an example is shown in Fig. 4b . Early reports on eoronaviruses classified them entirely on the basis of their unique morphology observed by electron microscopy (44, 66, 67) . However, the biochemical structure of most eoronavirnses has now been determined and coronaviruses have been shown to possess a number of common characteristics (53, 65) . These include the identification of a single high molecular weight single-stranded RNA of positive polarity, and three main polypeptide classes which comprise surface projection, envelope and R N P components. Such biochemical characteristics are now considered to be more appropriate than morphology in the identification of particles as coronaviruses. No biochemical studies have been reported for any CVLP preparation, and until such reports are forthcoming it is probably too early to consider classifying CVLPs as coronaviruses.\n\nAnimal coronaviruses show a large variety of species and tissue tropisms (44) . This is especially seen with IBV which can infect many different organs, including the upper and lower respiratory tract, the genital tract and the urinary tract, and can be recovered from the lung, spleen, tonsil and kidney of infected chickens (17, 27) . Similarly, infectious MHV strain 3 particles have been found in the spleen, liver, brain, kidney, lung, heart, testicles and numerous other organs of infected mice (51) . Other MHV strains also replicate in a variety of organs, although many of them have different target organs and cause a number of diseases including hepatitis, enteritis and demyelination (44) , Most studies have so far reported only the replication of HCVs in the upper and lower respiratory tracts of man with the production of minor respiratory diseases (6, 44) . However, pneumonia has been associated with eoronavirus infection of both adults (46) and children (70) . Furthermore RIS:KI and HovI (52) have analysed paired sera from about, 14,000 patients for antibody rises to HCVOC43, and have shown that HCVOC43 or antigenically related coronaviruses may be responsible in a few cases of more severe respiratory disease including pneumonia, and other non-respiratory diseases including certain neurological disorders. Such results are not unexpected as some HCV strains readily grow in a number of human cell lines (44, 65) , in human macrophages (49) and even in suckling mouse brain (45) .\n\nThese results may explain the appearance of coronaviruses in faeces of patients suffering from gastroenteritis: they may cause enteric diseases, although their isolation from faeces does not prove this. An alternative explanation is that these particles have no role in enteric disease, but that they are a result of respiratory infection and that their appearance in faeces is due to a later and probably minor infection of the gut. However, there is no documented evidence of respiratory symptoms preceding gastroenteritis in patients excreting these particles.\n\nCVLPs have also been observed in patients with a variety of other diseases including hepatitis (28, 73) , malignant ]ymphoma (3, 22) , multiple sclerosis (8, 25, 63) and Balkan nephropathy (1, 23, 24) . In none of these cases were the CVLPs shown to be the cause of the disease, as in most of the reports, the CVLPs were identified by electron miscroscopy only, using negative stain or ultrathin sections. Itowever, coronavirus particles were apparently grown in brains of suckling mice inoculated with brain specimens from patients with multiple sclerosis (8, 25) . These isolates were serologieally related to MHV strains A59 and J H M and HCV 0C43, but not to HCV 229E (25), although it was not clear whether these viruses indeed came from the patients or were a contaminating mouse coronavirus, presumably MHV. Furthermore, another study has shown no significant differences in the levels of antibody to a number of coronaviruses in patients with multiple sclerosis, compared wi~h controls (39). From the published electron mierographs, the morphology of these CVLPs closely resembles that of CVLPs isolated from faecal samples, and they show only the same superficial structural resemblance as most enteric CVLPs to coronaviruses. Thus similar CVLPs are found in a number of organs in the body as well as the gut in which they have been observed most frequently. At present it is impossible to determine the relationship of these CVLPs to enteric CVLPs, their role if any in infection, and their relationship to coronaviruses.\n\nThe main purpose of this review has been to summarise the data on human CVLPs observed in faeces and to determine whether some or all of them are coronaviruses and whether they cause disease. The available evidence suggests that the CVLPs fall into two distinct groups. The major group of CVLPs has been observed in many parts of the world from children and adults with various forms of enteric disease, although a significant proportion of the uninfected population also shed these particles. There is no apparent correlation with disease in man and animals but this may be analagous to the situation of poliovirus excretion in man (21). Furthermore, these particles do not show a close structural relationship with eoronavimses and the reported growth in organ and tissue culture requires confirmation: purified CVLPs should be used and evidence of passage obtained. Many groups have tried to purify and analyse these particles and to grow them in organ and tissue culture and have reported no success. I t is interesting to observe the many reports showing the presence of similar partieles in a number of human tissues suggesting that they may not be a feature unique to the gut. Furthermore, no biochemical or antigenic studies on these particles have been reported. Thus, at this stage it is premature to classify them as HECVs and further work is required to correlate their role, if any, in infection, and their relationship to coronaviruscs.\n\nThere are fewer reports of the second group of CVLPs, which have been observed by one group of workers, in the faeces of young babies suffering from severe enteric disease (61) . Unfortunately, this group has not provided details of the structural characteristics of these particles, although they do seem to closely resemble coronaviruses. Furthermore, these particles have been shown to replicate in tissue culture (61) , producing typical eoronavirus particles. However, it is possible that these viruses m a y be of bovine origin, as they closely resemble a BECV that is also studied in that laboratory. Although no biochemical or antigenic studies have been reported for these particles, it seems reasonable at this stage t~o classify these particles as coronaviruses, but not yet as HECVs.\n\nA n i m a l coronaviruses exhibit tropisms for m a n y different tissues and some replicate in numerous tissues and organs besides their p r i m a r y targets. I t is n o t known whether h u m a n respiratory eoronaviruses (HCVs) show similar tissue tropisms, b u t if t h e y do, then coronaviruses found in faeces m a y be the result of respiratory infection with HCVs. Another possibility is t h a t certain strains of H C V m a y be able to infect organs other t h a n the respiratory t r a c t as a p r i m a r y target, in certain individuals: perhaps these strains cause enteric disease in neonates. F u r t h e r studies are required to answer these questions and determine which, if any, of these particles are HECVs.\n\nA e k n o w l e d g m e n t s\n\nWe wish to thank our many colleagues for their useful advice, in particular Dr. E.
