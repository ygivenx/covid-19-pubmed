{"title": "-throughput Detection of Respiratory Pathogens in Animal Specimens by Nanoscale PCR", "body": "With the demand for rapid and comprehensive detection of multiple agents in clinical diagnostics for humans and animals, single-organism molecular diagnostic methods for pathogen detection are burdensome unless used for large numbers of samples being tested for a single disease. In the veterinary context, high-throughput diagnostic methodologies are particularly important due to the additional need for covering pathogens from a wide variety of species. OneHealth approaches for management of food-borne disease and emerging pathogen surveillance are examples of testing needs that include a number of bacteria, viruses (DNA or RNA based), parasites, and fungi. The challenge to combining tests for multiple analytes together (multiplexing) in order to improve testing efficiency is a possible loss of sensitivity and a large burden for optimization and validation of assays.\n\nNanoliter scale real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is an alternative to the practice of multiplexing that allows many separate reactions to run simultaneously on the same sample 1 . The OpenArray platform is an application of this principle 2 ; it combines microarray technology with real-time PCR. Based on the concept of spatial multiplexing, every sample is tested for a large number of targets in separate through-holes. This platform was initially used with cyanine-based double-stranded DNA binding chemistry 2 and is now available for probe-based chemistry using dark quenching probes 3 . This platform has primarily been used for genetic profiling in humans 4 and animals 5 . It was recently adapted to detect blood-borne DNA and RNA pathogens by Grigorenko et al. 6 using a two-step reverse-transcription/pre-amplification (preamp) procedure.\n\nWe describe here a one-step preamp-based procedure for detecting both types of pathogens in respiratory secretions and a variety of other sample types that can be performed entirely in a standard workday. Upon completion of the one-step preamp, samples are transferred to a 384well plate, which is the format accepted by the automated liquid handling system that comes with this nanoscale PCR platform. The system draws the master mix and sample across the surface of up to 4 plates (192 samples and controls) at a time. Following this loading process, we describe how samples are amplified and analyzed using a macro spreadsheet that summarizes the average of 3 technical replicates for each sample/target combination in a table that fits on one printed page.\n\n1. Use primer design software to verify that each assay conforms to standard probe-based real-time PCR cycling conditions with 60 \u00b0C annealing using the primer probe test tool (select the quantification probe setting with default parameters). NOTE: The representative RNA target used was adapted from the universal influenza A matrix targeted assay published by Shu et al. 7 . The primers and probe are as follows: Forward primer: GACCRATCCTGTCACCTCTGAC, Reverse Primer: AGGGCATTYTGGACAAAKCGTCTA, Probe: Fam-TGCAGTCCTCGCTCACTGGGCACG-QSY. The representative DNA assay used here was adapted from the equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1) detection method published by Elia et al. 8 . The primers and probe are as follows: Forward primer: GCTCTCAGGTTTTACGACATC, Reverse Primer: CTTTACCCAGGCCCTTGAAA, Probe: FAM-TCAACGTGGACAATACCGCAGTGATTAT-QSY. 2. Order nanoscale PCR amplification plates in the desired configuration.\n\nNOTE: For this study, the 18x3 gene expression format was used ( Table 1) . Provide sequences for all primers and probes (or inventoried assay IDs) for each target to the manufacturer.\n\n1. Extract total nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) by any desired method. NOTE: An automated magnetic bead-based extraction kit was used here according to the manufacturer's instructions (see the materials table for more details). 2. Prepare samples as follows:\n\n1. Clean the outside of each sample container with 10% bleach and dry thoroughly. Wipe gloved finger tips with 10% bleach between samples to prevent cross-contamination. 2. Place nasal or deep pharyngeal swabs in any sterile, sealed vial (such as a red top blood collection tube) with several drops of saline added to prevent desiccation prior to processing. NOTE: Cotton, plastic, wood-handled, and Dacron and other synthetic swabs are all acceptable, but avoid calcium alginate swabs. 3. For swabs and tracheal washes, add Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) so that there is at least 1-2 ml of liquid. Vortex the swab and DMEM vigorously in the tube. Then, use a pipette to transfer approximately 1 ml of media to a new tube. 4. Mechanically lyse tissues (100-200 mg in 1 ml of DMEM) using a tissue disruptor according to the manufacturer's instructions followed by centrifugation for 3 min at 825 x g. Transfer 500 \u00b5l of the supernatant to a new tube. 5. For feces, combine 400 mg of feces with 800 \u00b5l of 1x phosphate-buffered saline pH 7.4 (PBS). Vortex the suspension for 1 min or longer until the sample is homogenized or completely suspended. Once homogenized, centrifuge the suspension for 10 min at 18,000 x g, then transfer 400 \u00b5l to a new tube. 6. For whole uncoagulated blood, vortex the sample and make a 250 \u00b5l aliquot. Add six drops of lytic reagent and vortex to mix. Incubate 15 min at 37 \u00b0C. \n\nNOTE: Keep all reagents and samples used in the preamp reaction on ice at all times. Following preamp, keep all reagents at room temperature.\n\n1. Assemble eluted DNA and/or RNA, PCR Reaction Mix, nuclease-free water as a negative control, and pooled standards for positive amplification control. NOTE: Up to 48 samples can be run on an amplification plate including controls (include at least one negative extraction control for each extraction plate from which samples are to be pulled). 2. Print out a sample map. Have a second person check that the map and sample layout match. 3 . In a 1.5 ml tube, add the following to prepare the preamp master mix. 4. Perform the preamp in a standard 96-well plate using the left side of the plate only (columns 1-6). 5. Add 8.5 \u00b5l of preamp master mix and 5.5 \u00b5l of DNA/RNA sample to each well. 6 . After combining all reagents (samples, positive controls and negative controls with Preamp mix), thoroughly seal the standard 96-well plate with a clear adhesive seal. Remove any excess seal using a razor blade to prevent formation of seal gaps during cycling. Centrifuge the sealed plate for 20 sec using a PCR plate spinner. Check to ensure all reagents are combined in the bottom of the plate wells. 7. Run the preamp assay on a conventional thermocycler under the following conditions: 15 min at 50 \u00b0C; 1 min at 95 \u00b0C; 20 cycles of 15 sec at 95 \u00b0C, then 2 min at 60 \u00b0C; 99.9 \u00b0C for 10 min; hold at 4 \u00b0C. Program these conditions prior to starting. 8. Turn on the conventional thermocycler, select the preamp cycling program and start the program. Place the 96-well plate in the thermocycler only when the bottom portion of the thermocycler (not the cover) reaches the temperature required for cDNA production (50 \u00b0C) by monitoring the temperature reading on the screen. Prior to this, keep the plate cold to minimize the risk of producing false positive results. 9. Once the preamp run is complete, verify that the plate has remained sealed. 10 . Proceed immediately to step 4.1. To store this plate overnight, perform the dilution as described in steps 4.2 to 4.5, except instead of loosely covering the plate, seal the plate with a clear adhesive seal and place inside a zipper-lock bag, stored at 4 \u00b0C.\n\n1. Remove the appropriate number of amplification plates from the freezer (up to 4 may be run at once). Do not open the packaging. Allow the plate to warm up for at least 15 min at room temperature. Record the serial number and lot number of the plate. NOTE: Unopened plates can remain at room temperature for up to 24 hr, but for best practice, remove these from the freezer no more than 30 min before needed. 2. Centrifuge the completed preamp plate for 20 sec using the PCR plate spinner. Turn on the amplification machine and computer and start the associated program. 3. Remove all unnecessary items from a PCR setup area. Put on double gloves and sleeve covers. 4. Remove the seal from the preamp plate and carefully remove and discard the outer gloves. Dilute the preamp products at 1:5 by adding 56 \u00b5l of TE buffer to each well of columns 1-6 of the 96-well preamp plate and mixing by pipetting up and down. Go only to the first stop of the pipette, aspirating from the bottom and dispensing higher up but not creating bubbles. Add TE buffer to all 6 columns regardless of unused wells. 5. Reseal the plate with either a clear adhesive or foil seal, and centrifuge it for 20 sec using the PCR plate spinner. Set this plate aside (loosely covered) until step 6.1 is complete. Discard remaining gloves and sleeve covers. box cover when a new box is opened, and ensure that the tips are not expired. Turn on the liquid handler and computer and open the liquid handler software, which will perform a self-test. 3. Click \"Setup and Load\". Click \"Browse\" to select the csv file created from the Sample Tracker software. If the file is not shown, go to \"Instrument/Edit Preferences\" and then click \"Change\" by \"Sample Plate File Folder\". Select the folder where the csv file is saved. Then, click \"Setup and Load\", then \"Browse\" and select the file. 4. Next, click \"Browse\" next to the \"Plate Holder Position 1\" and select the TPF file (provided by the manufacturer) that has the same serial number as the plate.\n\nNote: Do not start filling the 384-well plate until all of the above steps are complete. Evaporation is a concern with small volumes -do not let the 384-well plate sit uncovered with liquid inside.\n\n1. Once all of the above steps are completed put on new, well-fitted double gloves and sleeve covers. Then, add 2.5 \u00b5l of amplification master mix to a 384-well plate. 2. Transfer 2.5 \u00b5l of diluted preamp product to the 384-well plate according to the map in Table 2 and immediately cover the plate tightly with a foil seal. Discard outer gloves and sleeve covers. 3. Centrifuge the 384-well plate for 20 sec in the PCR plate spinner. 4. Do not remove the foil seal, but place the 384-well plate in the liquid handler. 5. Open the package containing an encased amplification plate and place it carefully in the liquid handler in the first slot with the serial number on the right -hold the case by the edges without touching the surface of the plate. Use unwrapped plates within one hour of opening. Note: The purpose of the case is to protect the plate from being touched, since this could disturb the small amounts of primers and probes inside the through-holes. 6. Remove the foil seal from the 384-well plate inside the liquid handler once everything is in place. Click Next and then check all the boxes as each step is completed. Click OK to start the run. 7. Close the door to the liquid handler and immediately start the filling process. Stay next to the liquid handler and immediately proceed to the next step once the plate is filled. 8. While the liquid handler is running, remove the protective film from the bottom of a case lid.\n\nResults are shown in Figures 1 and 2 for a representative RNA assay (influenza matrix) and DNA assay (EHV-1) with a combination of positive controls and clinical samples submitted for routine diagnostic testing. The fluorescence signals emitted throughout this typical reaction are shown in Figure 1 , which plots raw fluorescence values per cycle. All relative cycle threshold (Ct) values were automatically generated by the amplification machine software. Background fluorescence was used as a separate metric for assessment of loading quality rather than incorporating it into the fluorescence readings prior to calculating Ct values.\n\nThe analytical limit of detection (LOD) for each target was calculated based on the overall mean of the Ct values at the 95% detection level plus 2 standard deviations in a pool of controls for all targets. The highest dilution where at least 95% of the replicates were positive for the representative assays was 50 copies; detection of 5 copies was successful in 50% of replicates. Neither assay was detected at below one copy. The LODs for the RNA and DNA assay were calculated at Ct values of 21.92 and 20.05. These values were considered to be the cutoffs for reporting values as positive vs. suspect (potentially not repeatable).\n\nOther aspects of analytic performance of the targets was assessed using serial dilutions of pooled positive controls run on three different days (Figure 2) . The average efficiencies of the representative RNA and DNA assays were 101.1% and 106.6%; the overall mean efficiency for all targets was 101.3%. The assays also had good linearity (R 2 >0.98). Variation within replicate through-holes typically was within standard deviations of 0.2 for both clinical samples and controls. No cross-reactivity between any of the targets was observed.\n\nThe Final Results worksheet in the supplemental file shows representative quantitative results for 10 clinical diagnostic samples and 4 controls. The clinical samples are a subset of the types of samples routinely tested including nasal/oropharyngeal swabs, lung tissue, and fecal samples. One (equine) fecal sample in this set shows a failed MS2 internal control, which indicates the presence of inhibitors in the sample. This is typically managed by dilution of the eluted sample and/or re-extraction. As is the case here, the negative amplification control should be negative for all targets, and the negative extraction control should only contain the internal control. In the clinical set, samples produced Ct values for betacoronavirus, Bordetella bronchiseptica, canine distemper virus A, canine parainfluenza virus, canine pneumovirus, and influenza A. Table 1 . Schematic of the amplification plate and target locations. The plates used for nanoscale real-time PCR testing on this platform are microscope slide-sized and are arranged in 48 subarrays of 64 through-holes, with a total of 3,072 through-holes for individual reactions. One subarray is shown here, with 18 targets in triplicate. Each sample is added to one subarray by the liquid handler. Plates are coated with hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds to retain reagents in through-holes via surface tension. The stainless steel chip is \"photolithographically patterned and wet-etched to form a rectilinear array of 3,072 micro-machined, 320 \u00b5m diameter holes of 33 nl each\" Table 2 . Plate transfer map. A color-coded plate transfer map for using a fixed 8-channel pipette to transfer from the 96-well preamp plate to the 384-well plate is shown. Alternately, an adjustable pipette may be used. The same procedure is performed each time regardless of how many samples are in the plate.\n\nA macro-enabled spreadsheet file containing two macros for formatting results into a summary table (as described in the protocol) is provided. A typical result table generated by the macros is included in the file (under Final Results). The two macros will fill in the sample names in the first column (up to 48 samples) and the average of the three Ct values for each target for those with positive results; note that targets that did not amplify appear blank in this table. This can be easily printed on one piece of paper and used as a reference for checking the raw data efficiently. In the final results tab, representative results for 10 clinical samples and 4 controls are shown. Abbreviations for assay names are listed in the legend of Table 1 .

We have also had success using the same procedure for enteric pathogen profiling in fecal samples and bacterial isolates on a separately customized plate. Once the plates are produced, experienced staff can complete steps 2-7 within one standard workday. The most critical steps are the proper sealing of the preamp plate, the transfer of preamplified samples between plates (which must be done rapidly to prevent evaporation), and the final covering of the amplification plate. Use of the macro spreadsheet as a guide for result analysis (checking curves for samples and controls) was also critical as it greatly reduced the amount of time and paperwork needed for this process. The provided macro spreadsheet is an example; it would need to be modified or re-created for plates with different configurations. This can easily be performed by someone with basic spreadsheet knowledge.\n\nDue to the very small amount of sample loaded onto the amplification plate (33 nl), pre-amplification is required. In the optimization of this protocol (not shown), we compared a number of preamplification parameters including the master mix, addition of random primers, number of cycles, annealing time, and dilution prior to amplification. Each target had its own optimal conditions, and those described here represent those that yielded the best limit of detection overall for our panel. This panel covers a wide range of pathogenic targets and sample types that are encountered in routine veterinary diagnostic testing, but modifications to the preamplification procedures may be necessary for different panels. The manufacturer-optimized amplification conditions are based on a standard probe-based real-time PCR protocol with a 10 min at 95 \u00b0C enzyme activation followed by denaturation at 95 \u00b0C and annealing/extension at 60 \u00b0C. The primers and probes are pre-printed on the plates also using manufacturer-optimized conditions and therefore do not require titration. Combining the reverse-transcription and preamplification steps for all samples (regardless of the type of target) was necessary in order to maintain efficiency in the workflow. Having all samples reverse transcribed is also beneficial for maximizing sensitivity. Furthermore, use of a master mix for the preamp that is optimized for minimizing inhibitors allows versatility in combining different sample types on the same plate.\n\nThe Center for Disease Control (CDC) influenza matrix assay described by Shu et al. 7 ). The significance of adapting these tests to a high-throughput platform with a species-independent internal control is that they can be incorporated into a OneHealth surveillance approach. Having both of these assays on a high-throughput testing platform will facilitate emergency preparedness for clinical facilities, shelters, and performance events.\n\nThe results described above were representative of all the targets on the plate with the exception of Mycoplasma cynos, which showed considerably more variation in analytic performance. This was likely due to the sub-optimal melting temperature (T m ) of the primers, which should ideally be 58-60 \u00b0C (the ideal probe Tm is 68-70 \u00b0C). A limitation of this platform is that it takes longer to design and manufacture the plates than for ordering individual probes, which limits the ability to quickly modify sequences. Another limitation of real-time PCR in general is the inability to detect novel or unexpected pathogens. This can be overcome to some extent by designing assays that match sequences in multiple species, but unbiased whole genome sequencing based methodologies are more suited for discovery of novel agents. 11, 12 Nanoscale real-time PCR allows a new paradigm for syndrome-based rather than species-based testing, which is useful for reducing reagent and labor costs in high-throughput molecular diagnostics. Large-scale panel testing by this approach can facilitate OneHealth surveillance efforts such as those described by Dunne and Gurfield 13 and Moutailler et al. 14 . Collection of swab samples early, generally within 3 days of clinical onset, provides the best chance to identify the presence of respiratory pathogens. Infectious disease emergence is often unpredictable, and tests that can be performed on different species without the need for modification of reagents are ideal for preparedness. Future applications of this technology are likely to be in pathotyping, antimicrobial resistance profiling, and further syndrome-based clinical diagnostic panels. Nanoscale real-time PCR is most useful for rapid, high-throughput screening of multiple sample and pathogen types, and would be complemented by unbiased or partially biased sequencing-based approaches for identifying new and emergent pathogens.\n\nMarcia Slater and Elen Ortenberg are employees of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. that produces reagents and instruments used in this article."}
