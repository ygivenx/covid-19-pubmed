{"title": "Incidence, clinical characteristics and prognostic factor of patients with COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis Running title: Predictors of clinical prognosis of COVID-19", "body": "Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that widely exist in nature and can infect both humans and animals 1 Compared with two other types of coronaviruses, the present new coronavirus is spreading far more quickly and has higher contagiousness 5 .\n\nUnivariate meta-regression showed that compared with Wuhan, CSR and CFR in other areas were significantly lower (all for P < 0.0001), which was consistent with the subgroup analysis. Although not statistically significant, CSR and CFR showed a decreasing trend over time. In addition, onset-to-admission time were identified closely correlation with CSR (4.99% per increase in days, P = 0.0047) and CFR (1.97% per increase in days, P < 0.0001), suggesting shortening the onset-to-admission time favored COVID-19 related outcomes.\n\nMultivariate meta-regression confirmed the close correlation between onset-to-admission time and CFR (1.27% per increase in days, P = 0.0263). ( Table 2 and Figure 3 ).\n\nClinical and laboratory data from 26 studies, including 1374 severe and 4326 non-severe patients, were extracted for meta-analysis. Of this, 7.7% patients (95% CI, 3.6-11.8%) were medical staff. The pooled CFR of severe patients was significantly higher than non-severe patients (6.0%;\n\n[95% CI, 4.6-7.3%] vs. 0.1%; [95% CI, 0-0.2%], P < 0.001). The mean incubation period was 7.10 days (95% CI, 6.06-8.14 d), with no statistically difference between severe and non-severe cases. The mean time from symptom onset to hospital admission was 6.18 days (95% CI, 5.23-7.12 d) , which is longer in severe cases than that in non-severe cases (6.56 d vs. 4.81d, P = 0.023) and in Wuhan than outside (7.23 d vs. 4 .86 d, P = 0.027).\n\nSevere cases presented with older age (54.5 yrs; [95% CI, vs. 44.5 yrs; [95% CI, 42.0-47.1 yrs], P < 0.001) and higher ratio of male (59.7%; [95% CI, 55.0-64.3%] vs. 51.9; [95% CI, 46.6-57.2%], P < 0.001), as compared with non-severe cases. Similarly, patients in Wuhan were older than those outside Wuhan (55.7 yrs vs. 41.6 yrs, P < 0.001).\n\nFever (79.1%; 95% CI, 68.0-90.3%), cough (58.0%; 95% CI, 42.0-74.0%) and fatigue (29.3%; 95% CI, 23. .3%) were the dominant symptoms,\n\nwhereas digestive symptoms such as diarrhea (5.7%; 95%CI 3.9-7.5%), nausea or vomiting (2.0%; 95% CI, 1.0-2.9%) were relatively rare. The overall prevalence of any comorbidity was 37.1% (95% CI, 28.1-46.1%), with higher incidence rate in severe cases than non-severe cases (54.9% vs. 27.6%, P = 0.006), and higher in Wuhan than other areas (45.1% vs.\n\n28.8%, P = 0.01). The most common comorbidities were hypertension (19.0%, 95% CI, 13.2-24.9%), followed by diabetes (8.2%, 95% CI, 6.3-10.0%) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD, 2.7%, 95% CI, 1.4-4.1%).\n\nMoreover, hypertension, diabetes, CVD, cerebrovascular diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) were significantly more common in severe cases as compared with non-severe cases (all for P < 0.05). The overall proportion of bilateral radiologic abnormalities was 87.2% (95% CI, 82.1-92.3%), with significant difference between inside and outside Wuhan (91.6% vs. 82.6%, P = 0.018).\n\nIn terms of the laboratory index, several elevated indicators were observed as follows: C-reaction protein (CRP, 26.07 ng/mL). In contrast, the level albumin (37.31 g/L; 95% CI, 34.33-40.28 g/L) and lymphocytes count (1.18 \u00d7 10 /L; 95% CI, 1.00-1.36 \u00d7 10 /L) were below normal level. Of note, obvious differences in laboratory index were identified between severe and non-severe cases, as well as between Wuhan and outside Wuhan. Elevated level of CRP, LDH and D-dimer, together with reduced level of lymphocytes count and PLT count were the prominent features of severe cases (all for P < 0.001). Likewise, more elevated CRP, myoglobin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and ferritin, followed by decreased lymphocyte count and hemoglobin were observed in Wuhan patients than outside (all for P < 0.001) ( Table 2) .\n\nAmong the baseline characteristics, disease severity was highly associated with old age (\u2265 50 yrs, OR = 2.609; 95% CI, 2.288-2.976; n = 5; I 2 = 37%), male (OR =1.348; 95% CI, 1.195-1.521; n = 13; I 2 = 0%), smoking (OR =1.734; 95% CI, 1.146-2.626; n = 4; I 2 = 0%) and any All rights reserved.

MERS (68.0%), while hypertension for COVID-19 (19.0%). Fever and cough were the dominant symptoms for all three viruses, whereas digestive symptoms and chill were relatively rare for COVID-19.\n\nRegarding laboratory index, elevated LDH was common for three coronaviruses; higher incidence of lymphopenia, elevated AST or ALT was observed in COVID-19 and SARS than MERS 39,40 . (Table 4 ).\n\nBoth old age and comorbidity proved the common risk factors for predicting death among three coronaviruses. In support, COVID-19 related death was associated with old age ( \u2265 60 yrs, RR = 9.45; 95% CI, 8.09-11.04), male (RR = 1.67, 95% CI, 1.47-1.89) and any comorbidity (5.86; 95% CI, ), most notably CVD (6.75; 95% CI, 5.40-8.43) followed by hypertension (4.48; 95% CI, ) and diabetes (4.43; 95% CI, ). Similar with COVID-19, male (RR = 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2-2.1) and CVD (OR = 3.5; 95% CI, 3.1-4.8) were also risk factors for MERS related death 41, 42 . In contrast, the most predominant risk factor for SARS related death was CKD (9.02; 95% CI, , and the risk of male gender was not statistically significant 3, 43, 44 . In addition, medical staff had a lower fatality rate than non-clinical staff for COVID-19 (RR = 0.12; 95% CI, 0.05-0.30) and MERS (RR = 0.1; 95% CI, 0.02-0.20), whereas the difference was not significant for SARS (RR = 0.76; 95% CI, 0.52-1.15).

We observed no evidence of publication bias with inspection of the funnel plot or with the Begger test or the test used by Peters et al (eFigure 9 in supplement).\n\nThe main findings of this present analysis are that: (1) Despite the high incidence rate, the distinctive feature of COVID-19 was low severity and mortality, showing a significant difference on the incidence of severity and mortality between Wuhan and outside of Wuhan; (2) The onset-to-admission time was closely related to mortality, which will be increased about 1.27% with every day of delay in admission; (3) SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be higher contagious than previously discovered human coronaviruses 45 . Until now, more than 187, 361 confirmed cases and caused 7, 485 deaths in 151 countries on six continents were identified. Despite its high prevalence of COVID-19, the All rights reserved.

Of note, there are regional and spatial differences in the incidence rate of COVID-19. In our research, the pooled severity rate and mortality caused by COVID-19 was found significantly higher in Wuhan than that of the infected outside of Wuhan (all for P < 0.01). On the other hand, disease incidence at the early stage of outbreak was higher than that at the late stage, which may be caused by the lack of recognitions and treatment experience for COVID-19. Moreover, the longer time from symptoms to hospitalization, the higher incidence rate of the mortality related to COVID-19, highlighting the importance of timely medical treatment 30 . In addition, among the patients with 2019-nCoV, the pooled infection rate of medical staff was 7.7%, which awareness and others. Nevertheless, we conducted meta-regression based on the observation duration and symptom onset to hospital admission time, which explained a large percent of heterogeneity. Secondly, studies published before February 25, 2020 and articles published in English only were included in our study, therefore there was lack of data from other countries. However, our meta-analysis involved 53000 confirmed patients based on the data during the early-to-mid period of disease outbreak in China, which will provide great referential value for global epidemic control. Thirdly, meta-analysis was conducted on the level of the studies and the characteristics of individual patients could not be retrieved, thus it was hard to provide reference for individualized diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19. Finally, all included studies were retrospective, as no randomized control trials and prospective studies related to 2019-nCoV finish till now, thus our results require to be confirmed by more high-quality clinical researches.\n\nCOVID-19 is emerging all over the world and spreading at an unprecedented rate, resulting in significant impacts on global economies and public health. The present study successfully and systematically evaluated the prognostic predictors of COVID-19 by collecting published information on risk factors of the outcomes related to SARS-CoV-2\n\ninfections.
