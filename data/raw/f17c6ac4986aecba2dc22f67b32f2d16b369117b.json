{"title": "Transmission and epidemiological characteristics of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected Pneumonia (COVID-19): preliminary evidence obtained in comparison with 2003-SARS", "body": "report of an unexplained pneumonia patient. Subsequently, NHCPRC appointed an expert group to arrive in Wuhan to guide the epidemic management. On January 7, the pathogen of this unexplained infected pneumonia was identified as a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) [1] , which was renamed as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on February 12 th , 2020. SARS-CoV-2 could causes Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), also known as SARS-CoV-2 infected Pneumonia. On February 7 th , 2020, a total of 31774 cases of COVID-19 patients were diagnosed and reported in 31 provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities) and\n\nXinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC) [2] .

Whether the effective control of 2003-SARS can provide direction for the prevention and control of COVID-19, there is still no reported evidence. In the present study, we collected relevant latest epidemic data of COVID-19 and a detailed statistical analysis was carried out and the results were compared with 2003-SARS in order to explore and provide scientific reference for the prevention and control of COVID-19.\n\nA confirmed COVID-19 patients was defined as a case with respiratory specimens that tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 by at least one of the following three methods: isolation of SARS-CoV-2 or at least two positive results by real-time reverse-transcription-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay for SARS-CoV-2 or a genetic sequence that matches SARS-CoV-2 [5] .\n\nAll rights reserved.

A descriptive epidemiological analysis method was employed to carefully analyze the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19. However, only several provincial administrations released the baseline information of COVID-19 confirmed patients, so the number of confirmed cases with detailed baseline information was far less than the total. Finally, 853 COVID-19 confirmed patients from 18 provinces, whose baseline information was available, were included into our analysis.\n\nCOVID-19 originated in Wuhan, China. In the early stage of COVID-19 outbreak, there may be cases of underreporting or concealment in Wuhan, which may make it difficult to objectively reflect the true epidemic characteristics of COVID-19. Therefore, the COVID-19 epidemic data in Wuhan and other inland regions of China was analyzed separately and compared to obtain more objective COVID-19 epidemic knowledge.\n\nAs of 24:00 on February 7 th , NHCPRC has received a total of 31774 confirmed COVID-19 cases in in 31 provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities) and\n\nXinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC), 6401 severe cases, 722 deaths, All rights reserved.

From January 24 th , 2020, the number of confirmed cases in areas other than Wuhan in inland China began to exceed Wuhan ( Figure 4A ); the fatality rate in Wuhan (1.52% -6.64%) was significantly higher than that of inland areas of China except for Wuhan (0% -2.64%) ( Figure 4B ).\n\nAs of 17:00 on February 7 th , 2020, the basic information of 853 confirmed COVID-19 cases was collected on the official websites of 18 provincial and municipal health committees. 853 confirmed COVID-19 cases were aged 1 months to 94 years and the average age was (45.05 \u00b1 17.22) years; 853 confirmed COVID-19 cases included 450 males (52.75%) and 403 females (47.25%), the gender ratio (M: F) was 1.12: 1 ( Figure 5 , Table 1 ).\n\nIn the 853 confirmed COVID-19 patients, 199 cases reported their contact history, in which 172 patients (86.43%) had a history of having been to Hubei or living in Hubei, 19 patients (9.55%) had a history of contacting confirmed cases, 8 patients (4.02%) had a history of contacting people who were from Hubei ( Figure 6 ).\n\nIn 2002, a case of SARS appeared in Guangdong Province, China, and then spread to Southeast Asia and all of the world [6] .

Subsequently, the Chinese government implemented a series of reforms in the public health field, such as reorganization of the CDC, training public health professionals, and establishing the disease information system covering the whole country, the establishment of a complete reporting system for infectious diseases and an excellent mechanism for handling public health emergencies, etc. After a development for 17 years, a complete public health system has been established in China and great progress has been made in handling public health emergencies such as infectious disease epidemics.\n\nAfter the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020, the Chinese government adopted Although many details such as the source of the virus and the ability to spread All rights reserved.

Studies have shown that the interpersonal transmission ability of COVID-19 corresponds to SARS, but its doubling time (6 to 7 days) is shorter than that of SARS (about 9 days) [1, 7] , and the passage interval of COVID-19 is also relatively short. The second generation of COVID-19 cases unrelated to Wuhan has gradually appeared, which has also contributed to a sharp increase in short-term confirmed cases, resulting in a serious situation of COVID-19 prevention and control, and thus it is now very difficult to predict the epidemic trend.\n\nAge and comorbidities (such as diabetes or heart disease) are independent predictors of poor SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV outcomes. The spread of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV occurred to a large extent through super-transmission events [6] [7] .\n\nCurrently, there are data suggesting that there may be super-transmission events in COVID-19 transmission, and the entire range of interpersonal transmission capabilities of COVID-19 remains unknown [8] [9] . In addition to the fragility of medical institutions in the face of the new coronavirus epidemic, the risk of infection complications among hospital populations is also greatly increased [10] [11] . What we need to do now is to continue to strengthen prevention and control measures, actively strengthen patient admission, diagnosis, and treatment.\n\nOur results showed the following epidemiological characteristics related to COVID-19:\n\n1) The overall epidemic of COVID-19 is similar to that of 2003-SARS, but the total number of confirmed cases is higher than that of 2003-SARS. The fatality rate is significantly lower than that of 2003-SARS in the same period, and the cure rate is significantly higher than that of 2003-SARS, which suggests that the prognosis for COVID-19 is good.\n\n2) The age of COVID-19 patients is mainly concentrated in the 30-50 years old (60.61%), and the male are more susceptible than the female (M: F 1.12: 1). This may be related to the fact that the adults at this age group are more active in social activities than other age groups.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Most of the confirmed cases in Wuhan were the First-generation infections, and the other regions may exist more secondary cases. The information above provided evidence that the harm of the first-generation COVID-19 cases is significantly higher than that of secondary cases (including second-and third-generation cases).\n\nThe \n\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\n\nR.
