{"title": "Clinical features and outcomes of 221 patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China", "body": "In late December 2019, an outbreak of acute respiratory illness, now officially named as the COVID-19, or coronavirus disease 2019, emerged in Wuhan, China. 1 2 From bronchoalveolar lavage samples of the infected patients, a novel beta-coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was isolated and identified as the causative agent. 3 Current studies have demonstrated that the COVID-19 shares over 88% homology with two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SLCoVZC21, and that bats may be the most likely natural host. 4 However, whether the SARS-CoV-2 transmits directly from bats or through an intermediate host is still uncertain.\n\nAlthough epidemiological studies indicate a common link between the initially diagnosed patients and the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan, 5 an increasing number of later confirmed cases have involved infected patients without history of contacting the implicated market, nor traveling to Wuhan, 6 and the family cluster type of infections were reported. 7 8 Human-to-human transmission has been confirmed, 6 and respiratory droplet and contact are the main transmission routes, while recent reports also suggested the existence of the fecal-oral transmission route. 6 9 Based on a recent large-scale epidemiological survey, the latency period of the SARS-CoV-2 may extend up to 24 days, even though the proportion of patients with long incubation period is very small, but the medium incubation period remains short at 3 days. 6 Reported illnesses have ranged from patients with little or no symptoms to patients being severely ill and dying. 6 The main clinical manifestations include fever, cough, fatigue, and dyspnea. 5 10 11 Compared to young and middle-aged patients with COVID-19, elder infected patients with chronic comorbidities have an increased risk of developing organ dysfunctions, including shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute cardiac All rights reserved.

Unlike SARS-CoV, the SARS-CoV-2 displays a highly contagious infectiousness even during the asymptomatic period 12 . At present, there is no effective medication nor vaccine for the SARS-CoV-2 infection. As of February 22, 2020, the National Health Commission of China has reported a total of 76,936 confirmed, 4,148 suspected cases and 2442 deaths in 31 provinces across the country. 13 In addition, more than 2700 confirmed cases have also been reported abroad in 26 different countries. 14 In this study, we have performed a comprehensive exploration of the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics of 221 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, including 55 severe patients and 166 non-severe patients of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from January 2 to February 10, 2020.\n\nFor this retrospective, single-center study, we recruited 221 patients who were confirmed diagnosed as COVID-19 according to WHO interim guidance, from January 2 to February 10, 2020 at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.

The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in pharyngeal swab specimens was detected by real-time RT-PCR using ORF1ab/N gene PCR kit (Biogerm, Cat# SJ-HX-226-1,2, Shanghai, China) according to the protocol described previously. 11 The diagnostic criteria for RT-PCR results were based on the recommendation by the National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention (China) (http://ivdc.chinacdc.cn/kyjz/202001/t20200121_211337.html). Confirmed cases were treated with effective isolation and protective conditions, and severe and critical cases were admitted to the Emergency Department or ICU wards.\n\nAll patients were monitored for vital signs (body temperature, heart rate, pulse oxygen saturation, respiratory rate and blood pressure). Initial investigations included a complete blood count, coagulation profile, and serum biochemical test (including liver and renal function, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase and electrolytes). All patients were monitored by chest x-rays or CT. Respiratory specimens, including pharyngeal swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, sputum or bronchial aspirates were tested for other respiratory viruses including influenza A virus (H1N1, H7N9), influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, and other atypical pathogens such as mycoplasma, chlamydia and legionella pneumophila, which were also examined with realtime RT-PCR. Routine bacterial and fungal examinations were also performed by conventional microbial culture techniques. Treatment strategies included: (1) effective oxygen therapy according to the severity of hypoxemia (nasal catheter/mask oxygen inhalation, high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and non-invasive ventilation (NIV)), (2) supportive treatment to ensure sufficient energy intake and balance for electrolytes and acid-base levels, (3) antiviral treatment (including All rights reserved.

The data of epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological features, treatment and outcomes were obtained from standardized data collection forms and electronic medical records. For critically ill patients admitted to the ICU, the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Sequential (sepsis-related) Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores were monitored on the day of ICU admission. Two researchers independently reviewed the data to double check the correct of collected data.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) was identified and classified by the highest serum creatinine level or urine output criteria according to the kidney disease improving global outcomes classification. Cardiac injury was diagnosed if serum levels of cardiac biomarkers (i.e. hypersensitive troponin I) were above the 99 th percentile upper reference limit, or newly onset abnormalities shown in electrocardiogram or cardiac ultrasound. The severe or critical COVID-19 patients were defined according to the following criteria: fever plus one of these conditions, including respiratory rate \u2265 30 breaths/min, severe respiratory distress, SpO2 \u2264 93% on room air, occurrence of respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, shock and other organ failure. 8\n\nAll the continuous variables were determined the normality of the distribution by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, the normally distributed variables were described as the means \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) and the skewed distributed variables were expressed as the median and interquartile range (IQR).

There were numerous laboratory parameters were significantly increased in severe patients ( Table 2) , including the white blood cell and neutrophil, the prothrombin time, levels of D-dimer, hypersensitive troponin I, creatine kinase, creatine kinase-MB, lactate dehydrogenase, alanine and aspartate aminotransferase (ALT/AST), total bilirubin, serum creatinine as well as procalcitonin ( Table 2 , P < 0.001). Additionally, the lymphocyte count was significantly decreased in severe patients compared to the nonsevere patients ( Table 2 Table 2) .\n\nOf the 55 severe COVID-19 patients, 44 (80%) of them were admitted to the ICU due to combined moderate or severe ARDS, requiring non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation therapy.

The median PaO2 level of patients in ICU was 66 mm/Hg (IQR, 53-87) and the median of P/F (PaO2 to FiO2) ratio was 113 mm/Hg (IQR, 84-190).\n\nCommon complications among the total 221 subjects included ARDS, arrhythmia, acute cardiac injury, acute kidney injury (AKI) and shock. Compared to non-severe patients, the percentages of severe patients with complications were significantly increased, including P < 0.001) were significantly higher than those of the non-severe patients ( Table 4) .\n\nAmong all the severe patients, 25 of patients (45.5%) received non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and 26 patients (47.3%) received IMV, which were significantly higher than those of non-severe patients, respectively (45.5% vs 1.2% and 47.3% vs 0; P < 0.001) ( Table 4 ).\n\nIn addition, 48 (87.3%) of severe patients developed ARDS, and 10 (18.2%) of them were treated with IMV plus ECMO support and 2 AKI patients underwent CRRT.

Figure 1A represents the chest CT was significantly improved after receiving IMV+ECMO support.\n\nWe also analyzed the outcome of the 44 severe patients in the ICU ( Table 5) . Of these patients, 23 of them (52.3%) were symptomatic relief and transferred to the general wards, while 9 of them (20.5%) were dead, and the rest of the patients were still under treatment.\n\nThe patients with higher scores of APACHE II, SOFA and increased levels of PCT, showed a worse prognosis ( Table 5 ). The elder and male patients had an increased mortality rate. The dose and duration of intravenous glucocorticoid treatment showed no difference in outcomes of symptomatic relief and death ( Table 5) Table 4 ).\n\nThis retrospective, single-center study included a total of 221 SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia cases from Jan 2 to Feb 10, 2020.

The levels of PCT, a marker suggesting the bacterial infection, were not elevated in the patients with COVID-19, suggesting the viral-mediated pneumonia rather than bacteria. These laboratory abnormalities are similar to those previously observed in patients with MERS-CoV 22 and\n\nThe rates of co-infection, including other viruses, bacteria and fungus, were significantly increased in severe patients with COVID-19 than those in non-severe patients.

Like other viruses, the SARS-CoV-2 enters cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis. 26 Studies showed that the SARS-CoV-2 may infect alveolar epithelial cells in lung through the angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) receptor, which is also expressed in other tissues, such as kidney, blood vessels and heart. 26 27 Researchers using an artificial intelligence predicted that Baricitinib, an inhibitor of AP2-associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1), might be useful to interrupt the entrance of virus to cells and also the intracellular assembly of the virus particles. 4 28 In addition, a case report showed that remdesivir, an adenosine analogue, has shown survival benefits in one severe COVID-19 pneumonia patient 29 . The effectiveness has been verified in vitro. 30 Now a couple of clinical trials focus on the efficacy of remdesivir, as well as other therapeutic strategies, such as immunoglobulins, Vitamin C infusion, mesenchymal stem cell treatment, arbidol hydrochloride plus interferon atomization, ritonavir combined with oseltamivir, lopinavir plus ritonavir and arbidol hydroxychloroquine and methylprednisolone. 31 The corticosteroid therapy regarding the onset therapeutic time, the dosage, and duration were still controversial in the treatment of severe SARS or SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. 32 We treated corticosteroid to the patients with refractory high fever, exacerbation of wheezing symptoms, increased interstitial exudation based on chest radiology, and high levels of inflammatory mediators to inhibit the \"cytokine storm\". Corticosteroid therapy (methylprednisolone 1-2 mg/kg/day) are recommended for severely ill patients with ARDS, for as short a duration of treatment as possible. 33 34 The results showed that the early onset use of corticosteroid may have clinical benefits, but more cases and multivariate correlation analysis regarding the safety and efficacy were needed to verify.

One principle of the ARDS treatments is the restricted fluid resuscitation strategy to prevent exacerbation of pulmonary edema. 35 The limitation of this study is that among the 221 cases, most of the patients were still hospitalized at the time of data collected. It is incomplete to assess risk factors for outcomes. Continued observation and dynamic clinical dataset are required.\n\nIn this single-center case series of 221 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, 55 severe patients (24.9%) with elder age and chronic comorbidities, developed more than one complication. 44 (80%) of them received ICU care, and 52.3% of them transferred to the general wards due to relieved symptoms, and the mortality rate of severe patients in ICU was 20.5%. Of the 166 non-severe patients, 21.1% of them were cured and discharged and no patients died. Older and male patients with higher APACHE II & SOFA scores, elevated PCT level, excessive fluid volume input, as well as the delayed use of corticosteroid might increase the risk of death.\n\nAll rights reserved.
