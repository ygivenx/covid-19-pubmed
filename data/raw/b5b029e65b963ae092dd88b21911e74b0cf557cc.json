{"title": "Microbiota-independent antiviral protection conferred by aminoglycoside antibiotics 1 2", "body": "Antibiotics are widely used to treat infections in humans. However, the impact of antibiotic 27 use on host cells is understudied. We have identified a novel antiviral effect of commonly 28 used aminoglycoside antibiotics. We show that mucosal application of aminoglycosides 29 increased host resistance to a broad range of viral infections including herpes simplex 30 viruses, influenza A virus and Zika virus. Aminoglycoside treatment also reduced viral 31 replication in primary human cells. This antiviral activity was independent of the microbiota 32 as aminoglycoside treatment protected germ-free mice. Microarray analysis uncovered a 33 marked upregulation of transcripts for interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) following 34 aminoglycoside application. ISG induction was mediated by TLR3, and required TIR-35 domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-\u03b2 (TRIF), signaling adaptor, and interferon 36 regulatory factors 3 (IRF3) and IRF7, transcription factors that promote ISG expression. 37 XCR1+ dendritic cells, which uniquely express TLR3, were recruited to the vaginal mucosa 38 upon aminoglycoside treatment and were required for ISG induction. These results 39 highlight an unexpected ability of aminoglycoside antibiotics to confer broad antiviral 40 resistance in vivo. 41\n\nAntibiotics comprise a large and complex group of compounds typically secreted by 44 bacteria targeting other prokaryotes. Antibiotics have revolutionized medicine since its 45 discovery. However, overuse and misuse of antibiotics have led to the emergence of 46 resistant bacteria in humans and in livestock. Current medicine faces a dire threat of 47 antibiotic resistant bacteria, which is rampant in many hospitals around the world. In 48 addition to its microbicidal activities, antibiotics can also directly affect mammalian cells in 49 a variety of ways. Antibiotics have been reported to directly inhibit eukaryotic translation 1 , 50 inhibit mitochondrial function 2,3 and induce changes in mammalian metabolic pathways 4 . 51\n\nThere is a critical need to better understand the host effects of commonly used antibiotics. 52 53 Here, we found that topical delivery of an aminoglycoside antibiotic to the mucosa induced 54 significant alteration of host gene expression, inducing increased expression of antiviral 55 interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Aminoglycoside-mediated ISG induction resulted in 56 significant protection against genital HSV-2 infection and significantly reduced Zika virus 57 replication. Aminoglycoside-mediated antiviral protection was independent of the host 58 microbiota, as intravaginal aminoglycoside treatment protected germ-free mice form HSV-59 2 infection. This protection mechanism operates in the vaginal mucosa and nasal mucosa, 60 as intranasal aminoglycoside treatment increased ISG expression in the lung and 61 aminoglycoside pre-treated hosts had increased survival after highly virulent influenza A 62 virus infection. ISG expression was dependent on TLR3 and downstream signaling 63 pathway, and robust recruitment of TLR3-expressing XCR1+ dendritic cells to the vaginal 64 mucosa. Our results reveal an unexpected induction of antiviral state by commonly used 65 aminoglycoside antibiotics. 66 author/funder. All rights reserved.

We excluded 96 metronidazole as it was present in very low quantities in the cocktail. Of the four antibiotics 97 tested, neomycin alone recapitulated the host protection observed with the full antibiotic 98 cocktail (Fig. 1c) . Neomycin-treated mice had significantly lower vaginal viral titers as 99 compared to other single antibiotic-treated mice and were identical to those treated with 100 the full antibiotic cocktail (Fig. 1d) . Thus, neomycin is the antiviral ingredient in the 101 antibiotic cocktail. variable to no protection (data not shown). Neomycin treatment after infection resulted in 113 lower viral titers (Fig. 1g) and highly reduced disease outcomes (Fig. 1h) . These data 114 indicated that vaginal application of neomycin before or shortly after exposure reduces 115 HSV-2 infection and disease in a manner independent of commensal bacteria. 116 117 author/funder.

We 120 identified over a hundred significantly upregulated genes ( Fig. 2a ; Supplementary Table  121 1). No genes were significantly downregulated in expression. Using Ingenuity pathway 122 analysis, we found that genes in the type I interferon (IFN) pathway were heavily enriched 123 ( Fig. 2b) , with over 30% of the upregulated genes falling within this pathway. We 124 independently confirmed the upregulation of a subset of IFN-stimulated-genes (ISGs) 125 using RT-qPCR (Fig. 2c) . ISG expression was also increased in germ-free mice upon 126 neomycin treatment ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ). Neomycin-induced ISG expression was rapid, 127 as a single treatment was sufficient to significantly increase ISG expression 2-5 fold 128 though not to the levels observed after a week's treatment (8-10 fold) ( Supplementary Fig.  129 3a). Neomycin-mediated ISG induction was also dose-dependent as increased amounts of 130 neomycin correspondingly increased ISG expression ( Supplementary Fig. 3a ). Significant 131 ISG induction was maintained up to 3 days after neomycin treatment and was only partially 132 lost by 1 week post neomycin treatment with 5 of 8 genes still significantly upregulated 133 ( Supplementary Fig. 3c ). Finally, this neomycin-mediated ISG induction was restricted to 134 the site of application, as we observed no upregulation of ISG expression in the lungs of 135 neomycin-treated mice ( Supplementary Fig. 3d ). 136 137\n\nNeomycin is a member of a large and diverse group of aminoglycosides, many of which 139 are commonly used to treat bacterial infection. To determine if ISG induction was common 140 across the aminoglycoside family, we treated mice with a panel of structurally diverse 141 aminoglycosides for 1-2 days. Five out of the seven aminoglycosides we tested 142 significantly increased ISG expression upon application to the vaginal mucosa (Fig. 2d) . 143 author/funder. All rights reserved.

Thus, the majority of the 146 aminoglycosides tested induce ISG expression upon application to the vaginal mucosa. 147\n\nSince aminoglycosides mediate their antibiotic activity by binding ribosomal RNA, we 148 tested if this ISG-induction was observed in other non-aminoglycoside ribosomal-targeting 149 antibiotics 11 . Mice were treated intravaginally with tetracycline or chloramphenicol, 150 compounds that inhibit bacterial protein synthesis by binding the 50s ribosome subunit 11 151 ( Supplementary Fig. 4a,b) . Compared to neomycin, neither compounds induced high 152 levels of ISGs, suggesting that ISG induction is not a common property of antibiotics that 153 target the ribosome. Previous studies have reported increased mitochondrial dysfunction 154 and a loss of mitochondria in mammalian cells 2,12 upon treatment with multiple classes of 155 antibiotics. We observed no reduction in total mitochondrial DNA in neomycin-treated 156 vaginal tissues ( Supplementary Fig. 4c) . 157\n\nTo determine the link between ISG expression and antiviral protection, we compared the 158 ability of ISG-inducing and non-ISG inducing aminoglycosides to protect mice against 159 HSV-2 infection. We selected two ISG-inducing aminoglycosides (kasugamycin, sisomicin) 160 as well as the two non-ISG inducing aminoglycosides (amikacin, streptomycin). Mice pre-161 treated with non-ISG inducers were not protected against HSV-2 infection, with vaginal 162 viral titers and disease scores equivalent to those of PBS-treated control mice (Fig. 2e,f) . 163\n\nKasugamycin and sisomicin treatment however, resulted in significant reduction in vaginal 164 viral titers and disease scores, displaying equivalent levels of antiviral protection as 165 compared to neomycin (Fig. 2e,f) . These data indicated that ISG induction by 166 aminoglycosides corresponds to their ability to protect mice against viral challenge. 167\n\nAminoglycosides induce antiviral protection against RNA and DNA viruses across 168 multiple mucosal surfaces. 169 author/funder.

A single intranasal dose of neomycin sufficed to significantly 172 upregulate ISG expression in the lung (Fig. 3a) . To determine if this ISG induction results 173 in host antiviral resistance, we tested neomycin-mediated protection in a functionally 174 relevant mouse model of influenza infection. Many inbred mouse strains, including 175 C57BL/6, lack Mx1 (Ref. 13 ). Mx1 encodes the myxovirus resistance protein 1, a dynamin-176 like GTPase that blocks primary transcription of influenza by binding to viral nucleoproteins 177 14-17 . Mx1 is an ISG that is induced by neomycin treatment (Fig. 3a) , and when expressed, 178 confers resistance to influenza A virus in mice 14 . In mice lacking Mx1 such as C57BL/6 179 strains, innate resistance to influenza is abrogated, and they rely on adaptive immunity. 180\n\nWe previously showed that oral neomycin treatment renders Mx1 deficient mice 181 susceptible to influenza disease because it depletes gut commensal bacteria that normally 182 support the function of dendritic cells that prime CD8 T cells 18 with an otherwise lethal dose of hvPR8, with 50% of mice protected (Fig. 3b) . These 191 results demonstrate that mucosal application of a single dose of neomycin can result in 192 substantial protection against a highly virulent influenza A virus infection. 193\n\nWe also tested the ability of aminoglycosides to protect against another RNA virus 194 infection -Zika virus (ZIKV).

Given 196 the ability of aminoglycosides to induce ISGs, we examined if aminoglycoside-treated 197 hosts are protected against ZIKV infection. We found that kasugamycin and neomycin 198 treatment resulted in significantly lower levels of ZIKV RNA in the vaginal mucosa early in 199 infection (Fig. 3c) . Notably, while vaginal ZIKV titers in neomycin-treated mice eventually 200 reached levels observed in PBS-treated controls, ZIKV replication in kasugamycin-treated 201 mice remained significantly lower in a large proportion of mice in this group (Fig. 3c) . 202\n\nTo extend our findings to human cells, we treated primary peripheral blood monocytes 203 knockout hosts showed relatively lower levels of ISG induction ( Supplementary Fig. 5a,d) . 220\n\nInfection of neomycin-treated MAVS knockout hosts resulted in reduced protection 221 author/funder.

By contrast, neomycin-treatment of STING knockout mice 222 resulted in robust antiviral protection with significantly suppressed viral replication and little 223 to no disease pathology ( Supplementary Fig. 5e,f) . These results indicate that the cytosolic 224 DNA sensor signaling pathway is dispensable for ISG induction by neomycin, while RNA 225 sensor signaling pathways play a partial role in aminoglycoside-mediated ISG induction.

We observed increased 248 induction of ISG expression upon neomycin treatment in Ifnar1 -/mice suggesting that 249 IFNAR signaling is dispensable ( Supplementary Fig. 7a ). However, since basal ISG 250 expression was much lower in Ifnar1 -/mice as compared to WT, neomycin treatment only 251 increased gene expression to those of untreated WT mice, thus neomycin treatment was 252 not accompanied by significant antiviral protection ( Supplementary Fig. 7b,c) . Collectively, 253 our results suggest that neomycin induces ISG expression via activation of TLR3-TRIF-254 IRF3/7 signaling pathway to confer protection against HSV-2. Since DCs are required for ISG induction by neomycin, and both monocyte-derived and 293 classical DCs are recruited to the vaginal mucosa, we wondered if TLR3 expression could 294 be used to identify the specific DC subset involved. It is well known that TLR3 is expressed 295 selectively by the cDC1 and not cDC2 (Refs. 26,27 ). Examining TLR3 expression across all 296 DC subsets using the RNA sequencing datasets deposited in the Immunological Genome 297 project 28 confirmed a single cDC subset with high levels of TLR3 expression -CD8a+ 298 author/funder.

In non-lymphoid tissue, 299 these cells are characterized as CD103+ DCs and both subsets express high levels of 300 TLR3 (Ref. 29 ). Recent studies have identified XCR1 as a defining cell surface marker for 301 cDC1 subset 30 . Thus, we measured the recruitment of XCR+CD103+ DCs in the vaginal 302 mucosa. Neomycin treatment resulted in significant recruitment of CD103+ XCR1+DCs 303 that were ablated upon treatment with pertussis toxin (Fig. 6a,b) . To determine if this was 304 the DC subtype responsible for ISG induction by aminoglycosides, we depleted mice of 305 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/248617 doi: bioRxiv preprint Aminoglycosides acts by binding bacterial ribosomal RNA, but it also binds mitochondrial 324 and mammalian ribosomal RNA 38-40 . Our data show that aminoglycoside induction of ISG 325 requires TLR3, which is a sensor of dsRNA. Thus, we tested if aminoglycosides induce 326 ISG expression by rendering host RNA more 'visible' to TLR3 in neighboring DCs. To test 327 this, we first treated splenocytes with kasugamycin and washed the cells multiple times to 328 remove extracellular aminoglycosides. Next, we incubated these kasugamycin-treated 329 cells with splenic DCs that include XCR1+ DCs from WT and TLR3 knockout mice and 330 measured DC-specific ISG expression. Incubation with kasugamycin-treated splenocytes 331 was sufficient to increase ISG expression in WT but not TLR3 -/-DCs (Supplementary Fig.  332 12). 333\n\nThese data led us to hypothesize that aminoglycosides may bind to dsRNA and render 334 them more potent for TLR3 activation. To test this, we treated splenocytes with a 335 combination of aminoglycosides and dsRNA Poly I:C. We found that a 1:1000 ratio of Poly 336 I:C to kasugamycin significantly induced ISG expression at greater levels than either 337 compound alone ( Supplementary Fig. 13 ). This enhancement was dependent on both 338 TLR3 and TRIF signaling ( Supplementary Fig. 13 ). Collectively, these data indicate that at 339 high molar ratio, kasugamicin synergizes with dsRNA to stimulate TLR3. DCs. In support of this hypothesis, incubation of these DCs with kasugamycin-treated 385 splenocytes was sufficient to induce ISG expression albeit at lower levels than direct 386 aminoglycoside treatment ( Supplementary Fig. 12 ). As XCR1+DCs are known for their 387 cross-presentation of antigens associated with dead cells 53,54 , it is conceivable that in the 388 vaginal mucosa, phagocytosis of aminoglycoside-containing epithelial cells results in TLR3 389 activation due to the accumulation of aminoglycoside-bound RNA in the endosome. 390\n\nThe specific RNA bound by the aminoglycoside that triggers TLR3 remains unknown. The 391 interaction of aminoglycosides with mitochondrial ribosomal RNA, which is closely related 392 to bacterial ribosomal RNA, is well characterized and aminoglycosides have also been 393 found to bind mitochondrial ribosomal RNA at multiple sites 38,55 . It is possible that 394 mitochondrial rRNA-bound aminoglycosides might activate TLR3 in XCR1+ DCs in the 395 endosome. Our results show that aminoglycoside and Poly I:C can synergize to induce 396 increased ISG expression (Supplementary Fig. 13 ). Future studies are needed to identify 397 the manner in which aminoglycoside-bound RNA stimulate TLR3. 398\n\nOur results demonstrate a surprising and broad antiviral effect of the aminoglycoside 399 family of antibiotics, when applied to mucosal surfaces.
