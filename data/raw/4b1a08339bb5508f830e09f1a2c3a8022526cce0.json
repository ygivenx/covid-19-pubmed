{"title": "Airway IRF7 hi versus IRF7 lo molecular response patterns determine clinical phenotypes in 1 children with acute wheezing 2 3", "body": "Exacerbations of asthma and wheeze are mostly triggered by respiratory viral infections and 74 are one of the most common reasons for a child to seek emergency care. 1 Previous studies 75 from our group have demonstrated that rhinovirus (RV) species C is the most frequent viral 76 pathogen detected in children who present to the local emergency department (ED) with an 77 asthma exacerbation. 2 However, the molecular mechanisms that determine susceptibility to 78 RV and expression of respiratory symptoms are not well understood. Previous investigations 79 of airway epithelial cells infected with RV in vitro found that type I and III interferon 80 responses were deficient in adults with asthma, leading to impaired viral control and 81 exaggerated secondary responses. 3, 4 However, this finding was replicated in some studies 82 but not others. 5 Human adult asthmatic volunteers experimentally infected with RV in vivo 83 have exaggerated IL-25 and IL-33 responses, which drive Th2 inflammation. 6, 7 Although 84 these data provide a plausible mechanism to link RV infection with the pathogenesis of 85 asthma, they are based on experimental models with artificial infections from laboratory RV 86 6 upregulated in children with RV positive exacerbations (e.g. IL-18R1, CD163), a notable 160 difference was the lack of an interferon signature. 161 162 Discovery of molecular sub-phenotypes of acute wheezing illnesses 163 164\n\nThe findings above suggested that children with RV positive exacerbations mount an 165 interferon response but there appears to be additional heterogeneity. As the data analysis 166 strategy relied on group-wise comparisons (with LIMMA/SVA), this approach cannot shed 167 any insight into subject-to-subject variations in gene expression patterns within each group. 168\n\nTo obtain more detailed information in this regard, we employed hierarchical clustering (See 169 Methods). To ensure that the clustering did not simply reflect variations in cellular 170 composition (observed above in Figure 1 ), we utilised a set of negative control genes (i.e. 171\n\ngenes not related to the outcome of interest) to model unwanted variation in the data, and 172 removed these effects using regression (See Methods and Figure S1 ). This strategy 173 preserves the gene expression signature associated with acute exacerbations in the data, 174 and removes the strong correlation structure between samples that reflect variations in 175 cellular composition ( Figure S1 ). As illustrated in Figure 2a , cluster analysis of the corrected 176 data divided the subjects into five distinct clusters or molecular phenotypes (labelled S1-S5). 177\n\nLikewise, the genes were also divided into five clusters labelled G1-G5. Notably, the majority 178 of children with exacerbations (45/56 = 80%) were found within clusters S1 and S2, and 179 there was no difference in RV detection between these cluster groups of children (RV 180 detection rates for children with exacerbations in cluster S1 vs cluster S2 were 73% vs 58%, 181 p-value = 0.347). The other three clusters S3-S5 contained the bulk of the controls and the 182 convalescent samples, as well as 11 remaining children with exacerbations. 183 184 To examine the overall expression of each gene cluster across the children, principal 185 component analysis was employed to summarise the expression data for each cluster, and 186 the first principal component was plotted across the subjects, stratified into their respective 187 clusters. This analysis revealed that the most striking difference between the subjects in 188 cluster groups S1 and S2 was the differential expression of the set of genes in cluster G5 189 (Figure 2b) , and this cluster of genes was strongly enriched for type I interferon signalling 190 (data not shown).

We followed this strategy because a direct comparison of IRF7 hi/low 201 phenotypes would only reveal differences between the respective responses, and we 202 wanted to know if the phenotypes operate through discrete and/or overlapping pathways. 203\n\nThe data showed that 208 genes were upregulated and 157 genes were downregulated in 204 children with IRF7 hi exacerbations compared with controls ( Figure 3a , left panel; Table S5 ). 205 IRF7 lo exacerbations were characterized by upregulation of 96 genes, and downregulation of 206 31 genes downregulated (Figure 3a, right panel; Table S6 ). These analyses revealed an 207 overlapping response signature, which comprised 52 upregulated genes and 11 208 downregulated genes. Gene network analysis revealed that IRF7 gene networks were 209 upregulated in the children with IRF7 hi exacerbations ( Figure 3b , left panel). IRF7 lo 210 exacerbations lacked an IRF7 signature, and instead were characterized by upregulation of 211\n\nTh2-associated pathways (e.g. IL-4R, FCER1G, ARG1) and downregulation of IFNg ( Figure 3b , 212 right panel). We also built a combined network to illustrate the unique and overlapping 213 gene network patterns for each phenotype (Figure 4) . 214 215 Next we employed upstream regulator analysis to identify molecular drivers of IRF7 hi and 216 IRF7 lo exacerbation responses. 28, 33 The data showed that IRF7 hi exacerbations were 217 putatively driven by upregulation of IFNL1, IRF7, and interferon alpha signalling (Figure 3c , 218 left panel, Table S7 ). In contrast, IRF7 lo exacerbations were predicted to be driven by 219 upregulation of cytokine and growth factor signalling pathways (e.g. IL-6, IL-10, TGFb, ERK, 220 CSF3, EGF, Figure 3c , right panel, Table S8 ). It is noteworthy that multiple inflammatory 221 pathways (e.g. IL-1b, IL-2, IL-4, IL-13, TNF, OSM, IFNG) featured in the upstream regulator 222 analysis results for IRF7 lo exacerbations, however the activation Z-scores were not 223 author/funder.

These groups were not related to any technical variables measured in the 251 study (Table S10 ). There was also no difference in season of recruitment, the detection of 252 viral or bacterial pathogens, or the use of medications ( of IRF7/interferon responses (combined as IRF7 hi ; black dendrogram in Figure 5 ), and the 282 remaining two clusters had low IRF7/interferon responses (IRF7 low1 and IRF7 low2 ; red and 283 green dendrograms respectively in Figure 5 ). A longer time lag was observed from first 284 symptoms to hospital presentation in the IRF7 low1 subjects (3.90 (SD 4.59) days) compared 285 with the IRF7 hi group (2.20 (SD 1.76) days, p = 0.023). These symptoms included cough 286 (p=0.015), wheeze (p=0.022) and shortness of breath (p = 0.02). Fever was more prevalent 287 author/funder. All rights reserved.

Runny nose was also more prevalent in the IRF7 hi group 289 (75.5%) compared to the IRF7 low2 group (45.0%, p = 0.024). All associations remained 290 significant after adjusting for age, gender, aeroallergy and Caucasian ethnicity. Our study is the first to investigate acute wheeze/asthma exacerbation phenotypes in 296 children using a systems biology approach. We have confirmed the central role of IRF7 as a 297 gene network hub and have identified two distinct IRF7 molecular phenotypes, IRF7 hi 298 exhibiting robust upregulation of the Th1/type I interferon response and IRF7 lo with an 299 alternative activation signature marked by upregulation of cytokine and growth factor 300 signalling and downregulation of interferon gamma. Importantly, the two phenotypes also 301 produced distinct clinical phenotypes. Compared with children with IRF7 hi , those with IRF7 lo 302 had a slower progression of illness from initial symptoms to hospital presentation, a greater 303 likelihood of a hospital admission, and a greater chance of representation with a further 304 exacerbation. Exacerbation severity at presentation was not different between the two IRF7 305 patterns, perhaps because presentation to hospital is likely to be determined by symptoms 306 reaching a severity threshold that causes parental concern. However also worth noting is 307 that the apparently impaired IRF7 response in IRF7 lo children was not associated with an 308 increase in exacerbation severity at presentation, although perhaps expectedly the reduced 309 IRF7 response was associated with slower resolution of the episode. These findings were 310 unaffected by the respiratory viruses or bacteria detected and medication use. Investigation 311 of a replication cohort using RT-qPCR produced similar findings despite variations in the 312 subject characteristics between the discovery and replication cohorts. In summary our 313 findings reveal two distinct phenotypes with clear differences in gene regulation patterns, 314 either upregulation of robust innate immune responses or cytokine and growth factor 315 signalling, and associated differences in clinical characteristics. 316 317 Asthma and wheezing exacerbations are largely triggered by RV infections but the 318 underlying mechanisms are not well understood. 2 Previous in vitro studies suggested that 319 author/funder.

[9] [10] [11] 36 Moreover, a clinical trial that evaluated the utility of inhaled interferon beta 324 therapy in adults at the first signs of a cold to prevent worsening of their asthma symptoms 325 failed to achieve its primary endpoint. 37 Our data extend these previous findings by 326 demonstrating that wheezing exacerbations in children are heterogeneous and 327 characterised by two very different IRF7 molecular phenotypes. Upstream regulator analysis 328 suggested that IRF7 hi exacerbations were driven by upregulation of IFNL1, IRF7, and 329 interferon alpha signalling. In contrast, IRF7 lo exacerbations were putatively driven by 330 upregulation of cytokine and growth factor signalling (i.e. IL-6, IL-10, TGFb, CSF3, EGF) and 331 downregulation of interferon gamma. 332 333 IRF7 is a master regulator of type I and type III interferon gene expression. 32, [38] [39] [40] We 334 previously reported that IRF7 gene networks were upregulated in nasal wash samples from 335 asthmatic children experiencing mild-to-moderate viral exacerbations. 10 We have also 336 shown that IRF7 promotes RV-induced innate antiviral responses and limits IL-33 mRNA 337 expression in cultured bronchial epithelial cells, 33 and furthermore in our current study IL-33 338 was downregulated in IRF7 hi exacerbation responses. Girkin et al. reported that knockdown 339 of IRF7 abolished RV-induced type I interferon responses in the airways in a mouse model. 40 340\n\nTogether, these experimental findings support our computational analysis unveiling IRF7 as 341 a regulator of the gene networks underlying the IRF7 hi responder phenotype. 342 343 Children with IRF7 lo exacerbations in the discovery cohort exhibited a delayed progression 344 from first symptom onset to hospital presentation. Given that our study design entailed 345 recruitment of children at ED presentation, we could not determine if IRF7 gene networks 346 were initially upregulated closer to the onset of infection and subsequently waned, or 347 alternatively if they were never upregulated in the first place. To address this issue, an 348 alternative study design would be required which entails regular sampling of exacerbation-349 prone children during the RV season. 41 It would also be of interest to further study the 350 stability of these identified phenotypes to learn if subjects experience the same type of 351 author/funder.

Notwithstanding this, our 352 replication cohort comprised approximately twice as many cases as the discovery cohort, 353 and this larger sample enabled the identification and characterization of two subgroups of 354 IRF7 lo children, and only one of these subgroups was characterized by delayed progression. 355\n\nThe activation of growth factor signalling pathways and downregulation of interferon 356 gamma may reflect the immune response entering a resolution phase, however, at the 357 same time these children were symptomatic. Moreover, many were also RV positive, and 358\n\ngiven that TGFb signalling promotes rhinovirus replication, upregulation of this pathway 359 may prolong infection and delay viral clearance. 42, 43 It is also known that frequent severe 360 exacerbations are associated with deficits in lung function growth (children) and accelerated 361 lung function decline (adults). 44 Thus repeated cycles of inflammation, growth factor 362 signalling and repair may alter the structure and function of the airways underlying this 363 phenotype. 364\n\nThe mechanisms that determine expression of disease symptoms amongst children with 366 IRF7 hi and IRF7 lo exacerbations are unknown. Given that children with IRF7 hi exacerbations 367 elicit robust antiviral responses, one possibility is that the airways of these children are 368 sensitive to the host response to respiratory viruses. In this regard, several pathways 369 associated with the IRF7 hi phenotype are known to impact on respiratory function. PD-L1 370 (encoded by CD274) is an immune checkpoint that delivers an inhibitory signal for T cell 371 activation. Upregulation of PD-L1 during respiratory bacterial infections in early life 372 suppresses the IL-13 decoy receptor IL-13Ra2, resulting in persistent airways 373 hyperresponsiveness. 45 MDA5 (encoded by IFIH1) is a pattern recognition receptor that 374 senses RV-derived RNA. MDA5 deficient mice infected with RV have delayed type I 375 interferon responses, impaired type III interferon responses, and reduced airways 376 hyperresponsiveness. 46 The proinflammatory effectors TNF, IFNg, and interferon gamma-377 induced protein 10 can also promote airway hyper-responsiveness in animal models. 47-49 378 379 Another possibility is that IRF7 hi and IRF7 lo exacerbation responses converge on a final 380 common pathway to precipitate respiratory symptoms ( Figure 4 ). For example, CD38 is a 381 receptor with enzymatic activity, which hydrolyses NAD, generating reaction products that 382 modulate calcium signalling. It is expressed on immune and airway smooth muscle cells, and 383 author/funder. All rights reserved.

Anti-IgE 385 therapy neutralises serum IgE, reduces the expression of the high affinity IgE receptor on 386 dendritic cells and mast cells, and it also reduces the frequency of asthma exacerbations. 51, 387 52 Phospholipases A2 are involved in the generation of eicosanoids from arachidonic acid. 388\n\nKnock-in of human sPLA2 into mice enhances airways inflammation and airways 389 hyperresponsiveness. 53 TLR2 is a pattern recognition receptor that acts as a sensor for RV 390 capsid. 54 In a mouse model of combined RV and allergen exposure, TLR2 signaling in 391 macrophages was required for induction of airways inflammation and airways 392 hyperresponsiveness. 55 In summary, our data has identified multiple candidate pathways 393 that link IRF7 hi and IRF7 lo exacerbation responses with expression of respiratory symptoms, 394 and these pathways represent logical candidates for future drug development programs. 395\n\nThis study has limitations that should be acknowledged. The expression profiles were 397 derived from nasal swab samples that comprised a mixed cell population. Follow-up studies 398 employing focused analyses in individually isolated cell types or single cell transcriptomics 399 will be required to dissect the role of specific subpopulations of cells in this disease. The 400 study participants were sampled during natural exacerbations, and it is not possible to 401 control for all of the variables that may potentially impact on the data (e.g. age, gender, 402 ethnicity, natural allergen exposure, pathogen strains and combinations, medications). To 403 address this issue, our analysis strategy employed surrogate variable analysis to 404 systematically estimate and adjust the analysis for all sources of hidden biological and/or 405 technical variation. Some of the clinical characteristics associated with IRF7 phenotypes in 406 the discovery cohort did not replicate in the validation cohort. This may be due in part to 407 variations in the demographics and clinical characteristics between the two cohorts, as well 408 as the fact that IRF7 phenotypes were defined in the discovery cohort by microarray analysis 409 of a large number of genes, whereas in the validation cohort it was based on RT-qPCR 410 analysis of a restricted gene panel. Finally, while our analyses have characterised gene 411 network patterns underlying exacerbation phenotypes and unveiled candidate molecular 412 drivers of the responses, further studies will be required to dissect the mechanisms that give 413 rise to these phenotypes and drive the expression of respiratory symptoms. 414\n\nNotwithstanding these limitations, our findings demonstrate that exacerbation responses in 415 author/funder.

All 662 respiratory diagnoses were determined by the treating physician and were independent of 663 study staff. Controls consisted of siblings of the cases or randomly selected children from 664 the community. We defined 'admission to hospital' as admission to a non-ED hospital ward. 665\n\nWe also collected 19 convalescent/quiescent nasal samples from children who were 666 followed-up at least 6 weeks after an acute exacerbation of asthma or wheeze; only a 667 subset of these samples (5/19) were paired with acute samples.

An independent sample of children 670 from within the MAVRIC cohort was used as a validation cohort. 671 672\n\nA detailed questionnaire and medical records were used to provide demographic and 674 medical information for each participant during recruitment and follow-up.

A child was considered positive for allergy overall if they had (1) aeroallergy; 682 or (2) a positive response to the skin prick tests for either cows' milk or egg white, or (3) a 683 parental report of a history of anaphylaxis, or (4) a high total IgE at either the acute or 684 convalescent visit. 685 686 Acute asthma severity scores were assigned to each child at recruitment using a modified 687 National Institute of Health score for children over 2 years of age 12 and included 688 assessments of respiratory rate appropriate for age, oxygen saturation, auscultation, 689 retractions and dyspnea.
