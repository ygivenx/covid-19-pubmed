{"title": "Viral rewiring of cellular lipid metabolism to create membranous replication compartments", "body": "Viruses are obligate intracellular pathogens that depend on host cell metabolism for their replication. Viruses interact with host membranes and lipids at various stages of their life cycle. All positive-strand RNA (+RNA) viruses, which comprise many medically and economically important pathogens of humans, animals, plants and unicellular eukaryotes (Table 1) , remodel cellular membranes into unique 'viral replication compartments' (VRCs) to support replication of the viral genome (for review, see e.g. Ref. [1] ). VRCs are generally assumed to support replication by serving as a platform on which proteins involved in genome replication are concentrated and assembled into active replication complexes. Additionally, VRCs are thought to shield the viral RNA from cellular defence systems that patrol the cytoplasm to detect and eliminate intruders (e.g. pattern recognition receptors, RNases). The structure of VRCs and the mechanisms underlying their formation vary greatly between +RNA viruses, but universally depend on cellular lipid and membrane homeostasis. Here we will review how +RNA viruses rewire host lipid metabolism and describe contributions of different lipid categories to VRC formation and functioning.\n\nRecent advances in 3D electron microscopy have revolutionised our understanding of the structure of VRCs. VRCs can be subdivided into two morphological classes ( Figure 1 ) (reviewed in Ref. [2] ). Invagination-type VRCs are formed by bending of the donor membrane away from the cytoplasm (i.e. by induction of negative membrane curvature), resulting in a secluded environment that contains all factors required for genome replication. These VRCs are usually connected to the cytoplasm by a narrow pore that allows passing of small molecules such as nucleotides but restricts access of the antiviral defence machinery. Viruses with invagination-type VRCs include flaviviruses, tombusviruses and nodaviruses (Table 1) .\n\nProtrusion-type VRCs are generated by bending of the donor membrane into the cytoplasm (i.e. through induction of positive membrane curvature), resulting in singlemembrane and double-membrane structures. Viruses that generate protrusion-type VRCs include hepatitis C virus (HCV), coronaviruses and enteroviruses (e.g. poliovirus, coxsackievirus, and rhinovirus) ( Table 1) . Protrusion-type VRCs often form a network of tightly packed membranes, which has been proposed to protect and hide the viral RNA [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Biochemical support for this idea comes from work with poliovirus. In isolated poliovirus VRC networks, the viral RNA is protected from RNase digestion, but it becomes RNase-sensitive upon reversible disruption of the network (without the use of detergents, thus retaining membrane integrity) [4] , indicating that the RNA does not reside inside the VRCs. In line with this, pores allowing access to the VRC lumen appear to be absent from single/double-membrane protrusion-type VRCs [5] [6] [7] . Collectively, these data indicate that RNA replication takes place on the cytoplasmic face of protrusion-type VRCs. Importantly, for enteroviruses and HCV it was shown that VRCs are dynamic structures that gradually transform from single-membrane structures into double-membrane and multilamellar structures, reminiscent of autophagic structures [5] [6] [7] . The single/ double-membrane structures likely primarily support genome replication. The role of the multilamellar structures is less clear. In enterovirus-infected cells, they have been implicated in the en bloc release of virions in extracellular vesicles [9 ] . In HCV-infected cells, they may be the result of a cellular stress response [7] .\n\nSterols are important components of eukaryotic membranes, which affect membrane properties like thickness and lipid packing, and are enriched particularly in late Golgi, endocytic compartments and the plasma membrane [10]. While mammalian cells incorporate cholesterol in membranes, plants and fungi use other sterols like ergosterol. Sterols are synthesised in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and from there redistributed to other organelles, keeping ER cholesterol levels low. Sterol biosynthesis is tightly regulated depending on extracellular supplies, which are taken up and redistributed intracellularly through the endosomal system. A significant portion of sterols is redistributed through non-vesicular transport by lipid transfer proteins, which often operate at membrane contact sites (MCSs), where membranes of two distinct organelles approximate closely (typically <30 nm).

Several picornaviruses and HCV all employ a similar mechanism depending on PI4Ks, PI4P and OSBP ( Figure 2b) As an alternative strategy to support increased membrane lipid biosynthesis, several enteroviruses and EMCV increase uptake of FAs [61 ] . The underlying mechanism has been investigated in detail in poliovirus-infected cells, which revealed specific increases in PC species with FAs with 16 or 18 carbons, likely matching VRC membrane properties. To increase uptake and activation of those FAs in particular, poliovirus harnesses the long chain acyl-CoA synthase Acsl3. Furthermore, while in non-infected cells most of the absorbed FAs are stored in lipid droplets, poliovirus reroutes them to membrane lipids at VRCs [61 ] .\n\nPC is synthesised via two routes catalysed by ER-localised enzymes, either by addition of the choline head group to a diacylglycerol backbone (Kennedy pathway), or from PE by three subsequent methylation events of the head group (reviewed in Ref. [62] ). In yeast, PE methylation is the major route for PC production, which may (partly) occur at MCSs, at least at ER-plasma membrane MCSs [63] . In contrast, the Kennedy pathway is the major pathway for PC biosynthesis in most mammalian cell types. Nevertheless, it is tempting to speculate that viruses alter host lipid metabolism to locally produce PC via in trans PE methylation at ER-VRC MCSs, which would allow in situ PC production at VRCs without the need for relocalisation of the enzymes from ER to VRCs. Which biosynthetic pathway mediates PC biosynthesis at VRCs and whether this involves virus-induced MCSs, remains to be established.\n\n+RNA viruses use a variety of other glycerophospholipids during replication, although their role in the viral life cycle and the involvement of MCSs in their homeostasis is often poorly understood. For example, TBSV accumulates PE at VRCs, possibly as a docking station for the viral replication machinery [64 ] . Correspondingly, replication of TBSV is sensitive to disruptions of PE biosynthesis. The requirement for PE is likely more widespread among tombusviruses, including some that form VRCs in other organelles. It has been speculated that, apart from serving a role in the recruitment of viral replication proteins, PE through its small head group and resulting conical shape may contribute to the induction of the negative membrane curvature that is important for the invagination-type VRCs [65] , but proof for this is lacking.\n\nEnteroviruses accumulate PS at VRC subdomains [9 ] . Later in infection, PS is found at autophagosome-like double-membrane structures, which have been proposed to mediate non-lytic virus release. The resulting viruscontaining extracellular vesicles are enriched in PS, which facilitates PS-receptor dependent uptake and infection in other cells [9 ] . Numerous other viruses employ PS-dependent uptake in a process termed 'apoptotic mimicry' [66] . How PS accumulates at VRCs is unknown.\n\nRecently, the MCS proteins ORP5 and ORP8 were shown to facilitate a PS/PI4P exchange at ER-plasma membrane MCSs [67 ] . Possibly, ORP5/8 are hijacked to facilitate PS accumulation at VRCs. It remains to be determined whether PS also has a role in enterovirus VRC formation and/or function.\n\nBesides having functions of its own, PI4P is also a direct precursor for the PI-bisphosphates PI(3,4)P 2 and PI(4,5) P 2 [68 ] . PI(4,5)P 2 plays a role in cellular lipid transport by anchoring MCS proteins at multiple MCSs (e.g. ERplasma membrane, lysosome-peroxisome) [69, 70] . HCV accumulates PI(4,5)P 2 at its VRCs and for this it requires PIP5KIa [71 ] , suggesting that PI(4,5)P 2 is locally produced from PI4P. PI(4,5)P 2 interacts with a novel amphipathic helical motif in viral NS5A and enhances the interaction between NS5A and the cellular ER-localised Rab1 GTPase activating protein TBC1D20, which is an important host factor for HCV replication [71 ,72,73] . Interestingly, the enteroviral protein 2C harbours a similar motif. Whether the presence of this motif is indicative of the accumulation of PI(4,5)P 2 at enterovirus VRCs, and what the role of PI(4,5)P 2 in enterovirus replication would be, remains to be investigated. Whether other PI-phosphates are in any way involved in +RNA virus replication is yet also unknown.\n\nSphingolipids represent a third major category of membrane lipids. This category of lipids is enriched in the plasma membrane, late Golgi and endolysosomal compartments [48] . MCSs and PI4P play crucial roles in the biosynthesis of sphingolipids (reviewed in Ref. [74] ). The ceramide transporter (CERT) docks to the Golgi through PI4P and delivers ceramide, a substrate for sphingomyelin (SM) synthesis, from ER to Golgi at MCSs. Emerging evidence points to a role of sphingolipids in +RNA virus replication. This is best studied for HCV. Replication of HCV is sensitive to inhibitors of SM biosynthesis. SM binds the viral polymerase NS5B in vitro, supposedly to recruit it to SM-enriched detergentresistant membranes, and activates the polymerase, although this may differ between genotypes [75] . However, there is no evidence yet that SM accumulates at VRCs and recruits and activates NS5B in HCV-infected cells.\n\nThe four-phosphate adaptor protein 2 (FAPP2) docks to the Golgi through PI4P and shuttles the glycosphingolipid glucosylceramide (GlcCer), a substrate for the synthesis of lactosylceramide (LacCer) and a subset of complex glycosphingolipids. FAPP2 localises to HCV VRCs and mediates LacCer accumulation [76] . FAPP2 depletion impairs HCV replication and disrupts VRC formation [76] . The adverse effect of replication of FAPP2 depletion can be efficiently rescued by addition of different (complex) glycosphingolipids, but not all, implying that HCV has specific requirements for sphingolipids at its VRC.\n\nAlso some viruses with invagination-type VRCs may use sphingolipids. SM localises to WNV VRCs and WNV replication is sensitive to inhibition of SM biosynthesis, albeit moderately [77] . Correspondingly, ceramide is redistributed to VRCs and inhibition of ceramide biosynthesis impairs WNV replication [78] . For DENV, two studies report contrasting results on the accumulation and importance of sphingolipids [53, 78] , which may represent differences in biology or experimental approach. This leaves the matter whether these closely related flaviviruses have similar or different interactions with sphingolipids currently unresolved.\n\nAlthough lipids are essential components of membranes and thus indispensible for the replication +RNA viruses, their diverse roles are quite poorly studied. Recent years have seen an upsurge of the field, spurred by emerging insights in basic lipid and membrane biology. In the near future, novel technologies (e.g. lipidomics, fluorescent probes to detect lipids) will spur further studies into how +RNA viruses rewire host lipid metabolism to optimally support genome replication. Such fundamental insights into virus replication may provide a basis for the development of novel antiviral drugs. Using enteroviruses as a model system, this is the first publication showing that a virus recruits a PI4K to its VRCs and enriches them in PI4P lipids.\n\n14. \n\nZhang J, Zhang Z, Chukkapalli V, Nchoutmboube JA, Li J, Randall G, Belov GA, Wang X: Positive-strand RNA viruses stimulate host phosphatidylcholine synthesis at viral replication sites. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 2016, 113:E1064-E1073. In this publication, the authors show for the first time the concept that a virus (brome mosaic virus) locally synthesises PC at VRCs by recruiting PC biosynthetic machinery to VRCs. They also elegantly show that HCV and poliovirus accumulate newly synthesised PC at their VRCs."}
