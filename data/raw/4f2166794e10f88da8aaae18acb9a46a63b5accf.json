{"title": "THE EFFECTS OF HEALTH AND HEALTH MONITORING ON ONCOLOGY STUDIES", "body": "Diseases can affect studies in a variety of ways.\n\n(1) They may decrease longevity, which has invalidated many long-term studies;\n\n(2) they may produce lesions or effects which are difficult to separate from the experimental lesions; and (3) they may interact with the experimental treatment to increase or de crease the production of tumors.\n\nIn the majority of cases, the effects of the infection are unknown.\n\nUnless a compe tent diagnostic effort is available, many infections are not even known to be present.\n\nAs well as discussing these effects I am going to present the procedures used at our Institute to eliminate disease problems.\n\nMy comments on health and health monitoring are based on experience in the United States of America.\n\nThe quality of commercially available laboratory mice and rats has improved to the point in the United States that many undesirable pathogens have been eliminated. Several viral infections continue to be widespread and difficult to control, especially Sendai, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV),\n\nIn mouse colonies PVM, Sendai, MVM and MHV viruses are the most prevalent while in rat colonies KRV, RCV/SDA, PVM, Sendai and Toolan's H-l are most common (1) . Mycoplasma also continues to be a significant problem in some rat and mouse colonies. A recent conference was held to dis cuss Sendai, coronaviruses, mouse hepatitis virus and myco plasma and their effects on research (2).\n\nThe following examples have been chosen to illustrate how some of these ubiquitous agents can profoundly affect oncology studies.\n\nNo attempt has been made to include a survey of the complete literature on this subject.\n\nX C3H/AnfCum Fi (BC3F1/CUI\u00ce1) mice. Both strains of mice have a low incidence of lung neoplasia. Large numbers of these mice were vaccinated with Sendai vac cine to prevent Sendai infection and maintained such that other pathogenic organisms were excluded.\n\nLung tumor induc tion in response to treatment with 3-methylcholanthrene was then studied. BC3Fi/Cum treated with 9 doses of MCA (total, 2250 \u03bcg MCA) showed no tumors prior to 16 weeks, a 50% incidence at 36 weeks and a 100% incidence after 72 weeks. (Figure 1.) In previous studies at the same facility (1), prior to maintaining the animals free of diseases, the mice had short ened survival periods and decreased tumor incidences. (Figure 2.) At 2250 \u03bcg MCA all the \"unvaccinated\" animals died prior to 45 weeks compared to over 80 weeks for a later experiment using the vaccinated animals. The vaccinated group developed many more lung tumors most probably because of the longer survival, allowing time for their development.\n\nIf Nettesheim and co-workers have conducted studies de signed to evaluate the interactions between respiratory in fection and respiratory carcinogens (4)\u00b7 These investiga tions were prompted by earlier reports of the development of squamous cell tumors in the respiratory tract of C57BL mice exposed to synthetic smog and three different respiratory viruses.\n\nThe Nettesheim studies were conducted using mice maintained in a barrier facility free of parasites, patho genic bacteria and eight common murine viruses.\n\nWhen these animals were exposed to synthetic smog and influenza viruses, no squamous cell metaplasias or squamous cell tumors were observed.\n\nThe authors concluded that the earlier findings were confounded by the microbiological status of the animals and that the squamous cell changes observed were caused by \"chronic murine pneumonia\" (4).\n\nRichter (5) has published photographs of squamous meta plasia of the lung in DBA/2 mice produced by Sendai virus which demonstrate lesions that could be confusing to the pathologist if the presence of Sendai virus is not known. Also, since these lesions change the differentiation and proliferation of cells these cells may respond differently to a chemical carcinogen and change the results of the ex periment. \"Conventional\" rats (rats with clinical signs of respiratory infection and infected with pneumonia virus of mice, Sendai, rat corona virus, and Mycoplasma pulmonis.) and \"specific pathogen free\" rats (free of parasites, commonly recognized murine viruses, and patho genic bacteria) were each treated with 100 mg of the cyclic nitrosamine per liter of drinking water 5 nights per week for 22 weeks (137-140 mg/rat total dose).\n\nAll survivors were killed 24 weeks after the start of the experiment and their lungs examined for tumors.\n\nThe incidence of lung neoplasms was significantly higher in infected than in SPF male rats. (Table I. ) 2.\n\nA Strain mice develop a high incidence of lung adenomas arising from alveolar epithelium (8). Ander-vont and Shimpkin (9) in the 1940's reported that the admin istration of methylcholanthrene increased the frequency of these tumors and the increases were dose dependent. Skimpkin and co-workers have since used this model to bioassay a va riety of chemicals (9). Theiss, Stoner and Kniazeff (11) have used this system to study the effects of reovirus type 3 infection on the pulmonary adenoma response to urethan. Urethan carcinogenesis was suppressed from 38 to 42% when the mice were exposed to reovirus 6 days before, on the same day as, or 14 days afer urethan administration. (Table II. ) \n\nMice injected with 10 or 10^ lymphoma cells were treated with a single intraperitoneal in jection of 1,3-bis-(2-chlorethyl)-l-nitrosourea (BCNU). Re sponse was then measured by mean survival time and percent survival.\n\nThe same authors have shown that reovirus type 3 significantly affected the lethality of the EL4 lymphoma cells. Some mice were given 10 8 -10 10 plaque-forming units of reovirus IP and the number of mice surviving after treatment with both BCNU and reovirus was significantly greater than mice given BCNU alone.\n\n(See Table III .) Similar results were shown by the same group (13) when using reovirus to protect mice from the A-10 murine mammary adenocarcinoma.\n\nThe examples already presented have demonstrated a few of the effects of viruses on oncology studies.\n\nIn the major ity of cases the effect of an unwanted infection cannot be determined without extensive study of the contaminant.\n\nThe relative lack of papers reporting the results of that type of study lead to the conclusion that very little work has been done.\n\nSince many of the agents are very common in ani mal colonies, the potential is large that erroneously inter preted information is continuing to accumulate. Another significant problem is the lack of competent diagnostic lab oratories diagnosing the health status of most colonies. Since many of these viral agents are inapparent clinically their presence may not even be known.\n\nIn May 1980 a working seminar was conducted to establish criteria for the optimal use of facilities for carcinogeni city/toxicity testing in the National Cancer Institute Bioassay (14). The working group on protection of the animal environment agreed that minimizing disease problems was a relationship between the quality of facilities and the qual ity of management and that management was the more important factor.\n\nA high percentage of animals should survive without introduction of disease or environmental factors that may compromise the results.\n\nSurvival of 90% of the control ani mals for 25.5 months was considered a realistic criterion for the F-344 rat and B6C3F1 mouse.\n\nAt the end of the study fewer than 30% of the survivors should have acquired pathogenic organisms not present at the beginning of the study.\n\nAt the time of procurement from the vendor, animals must be free from Mycoplasma, ectromelia virus, LCM virus, polyoma virus, Hemobartonella sp., Epyrythrozoon sp., tape worms and all ectoparasites.\n\nProcurement of animals with any other pathogen should be evaluated on a case by case basis.\n\nAt our Institute we require that all arriving rodents be free of serum titers to PVM, Reo-3, GDVII, Sendai, KRV, H-l, M\u00b7Ad\u00b7, LCM and RCV/SDA for rats; PVM, Reo-3, GDVII, K, polyoma, Sendai, MVM, ectromelia, M\u00b7Ad\u00b7, LCM and MHV for mice.\n\nThis necessitates purchasing animals only from vendors that provide animals of this quality. When strains or stocks of animals are required which are not available commercially at this quality we locate breeder pairs from germ-free iso lator colonies and breed them in house.\n\nIf no disease free breeders are available, we have the required strain or stock rederived through a germ-free isolator procedures.\n\nThe working group recommended that two-year bioassay animals should be monitored on arrival, at one, three and nine months of the study, and at the termination of the study.\n\nWe monitor our animals at arrival and weekly throughout the study for virus titers by eye bleeding of both rat and mice sentinels.\n\nWe monitor for all pathogens by necropsying arrival animals and by necropsy of interim and final sacrifice project animals.\n\nThe working group agreed that no less than a Class 4 facility based on the classification in the ILAR publication \"Long-term Holding of Laboratory Rodents\" (15) was required. We have a facility which meets these requirements but the key step in the process is the health quality of the arrival ani mals.\n\nA complete discussion of the animal care procedures used at our Institute has been published (16).\n\nA. Currently, many infectious agents are common variables in oncology studies but are not known to be present unless a competent diagnostic laboratory is used.\n\nInfectious agents can affect oncology studies by decreas ing longevity, by producing lesions or effects which are difficult to interpret, or by interacting with the experi mental treatments.\n\nC. The best way to cope with these problems is to avoid us ing infected animals unless the infection is a controlled part of the experiment.\n\nThe most important factor in keeping animals free of in fection is to only accept new animals that are free of patho genic organisms. \n\nDr. Hamm:\n\nThis is just one part of a health screening program to find out what kind of organisms are in the animals.\n\nWe react to this data dif ferently based on which virus it is.\n\nSo I guess in a sense, I'm more interested in more specific information, but that doesn't at all preclude the fact that your method of screen ing would be cheaper, for instance, and may very well fit your situation.\n\nDid that answer your question?\n\nRon Boot, Netherlands:\n\nto establish an immunological profile could cost just a little workload instead of screening for all those viruses.\n\nYou could use it as an initial screening, for instance.\n\nThat's definitely a possibility.\n\nWe use this screening because we like to have that specific information the first time around.\n\nI should mention that this is preliminary screening.\n\nWe never make decisions based on positive titer; for instance, I showed you a positive KRV. titer there. I think something we've sort of stumbled on accidentally was to start serially bleeding the same sentinel animal so that we'd have an easy way to tell if we had a false positive without waiting a long period of time; so we sequentially bleed the same sentinels.\n\nWe don't kill them for these tests. When we find a positive, we go back and bleed all the sentinels in the room and send it off for that specific test and then we see what comes back and at that point it gives us more information as to whether its a false positive or not.\n\nThen we make other decisions about what other kinds of sampling has to be done before we make the final decision of the disposition of these animals. I think Dr. Balk referred to the fact that some people tend to over react to this data and kill a whole colony or sue Charles River or do something extreme based on a positive; and I think that shows a certain lack of understanding of these tests.\n\nThese actually are screening tests for us as well and we just pick a level higher than what you propose. Were these sentinel animals the same strain as the animals in each test or did you use a stan dard susceptible strain of sentinenls?\n\nAnd the other points were did you pool any of the samples of the sen tinel animals and, in fact, how many animal rooms are you talking about?\n\nThe answer to the first question is that the animals are always the same strain and stock of animal because they're animals ordered at the exact same time as the experimental animals.\n\nSo the sentinel animals are always from the exact same shipment as all the other animals with a few exceptions in cases where we think we have a disease problem and we bring in other sentinels to help us understand that.\n\nIn that case we order a variety of different animals; and I'll just caution you that you have to be very careful when you bring in new sentinels that you don't bring in new problems. So those animals go through several extensive work-ups before we bring any of those into a room. We don't presently pool any of the samples to get around the possibility of losing a very low titer, low incidence disease problem.\n\nWith the ELISAs being used, as they become more proven and we get around some of the stumbling blocks that we're haveing presently of false positives, I think it's very likely that we'll be able to pool samples because of the very much higher sensitivity of those ELISAs.\n\nNorm Atlman at Papanicolau has some good data that I think he's going to publish soon, where he took known positive samples and mixed them in all possible combinations ane looked at them by ELISA and showed that he could pool those samples without losing any ability to pick out the positive.\n\nSo, in the future that may be a viable possibility; but we don't presently pool any samples.\n\nIt increases the cost, but it assures us that we won't miss a low titer single animal by dilution.\n\nQ: And what is the scope of your work? How many animal rooms do you screen from?\n\nWe have 20 inhalation chamber rooms and 15 animal rooms; and whether they are done weekly or monthly depends on the length of the test.\n\nThe two-year studies are bled monthly; the rest of the rooms are bled weekly. And that is a manage ment solution to the fact that with variable length studies it's too hard for us to set up individual programs for each study.\n\nSo if it's less than a year, the sentinels get bled every week until they are gone. I want to caution people, too; some people attempt to save money by bleeding test animals instead of sentinels and you can run into problems by inducing leukemias and those kinds of things in test animals.\n\nAnd even if you don't, those of us who interpret those studies do not think it was a wise idea to bleed your animals once a week for two years.\n\nSo, do set up sentinel animals.\n\nIt costs a little bit more, but if you serially bleed them it's not substantially more.\n\nI just wanted to make one comment on something you said later on -the fact that you don't care about how many organisms there are on the wall. If I can reply on behalf of the environment, proper routine fumigation of the rooms is considerably cheaper than repeated tests.\n\nYes, and I made an extreme example there to make my point.\n\nI do care if something is on the wall. We though, as a toxicology laboratory, are very hesitant to use any kinds of cleansers, disinfectants and so forth in our rooms and we tend to just use hot water and elbow grease.\n\nSo we don't fumigate any of our rooms. Many of the things that you fumigate with can destroy toxicology experiments; so we're ultra-sensitive to anything that may affect the animals.\n\nMr. Needham, The Veterinary Laboratories, Great Britain:\n\nObvious ly* if you're buying your sentinels with your batch -if you're using male animals you'll use male sentinels and presumably females animals, you'll have female sentinels. Have you seen a sex difference in relationship to any of the diseases that you've spotted?\n\nSo, I really don't have the data.\n\nIn the colonies that were already ex istent we didn't see any difference; and in the National Tox icology Program, which is now in charge of the large bioassay program in the United States, I believe, that they have not seen any sex difference in at least serum titers to these viral diseases.\n\nThere may be others in the audience who know, but I'm not aware of any incidence of any disease that has a higher incidence of these diseases in one sex or the other.\n\nBut I'm afraid I don't have any good data from my institute. That's about the best information I can give you.\n\nMost of the outbreaks were related to colonies that were in user labs or universities and places like that; but as far as I know, the ectromelia outbreak was never shown to involve any commercial colonies. And since I only work with commercial colonies, I have no experience.\n\nIf you do enough screening and you'll see falsepositive ectromelia titers, but very rarely.\n\nWe don't see very many, but we keep it in the screen in case we do have a problem with ectromelia.\n\nAs far as I know the U.S. commer cial colonies don't have ectromelia.\n\nI think though that several U.S. universities must certainly still have it be cause after the last go-round I know they didn't eliminate every colony in the country.\n\nSo, I think, ectromelia prob ably is endemic in the United States in some of those uni versity colonies; but it's just an opinion -I have no data.\n\nDr. Joe Held: Q: Well, I've been presented data which has indicated to me that it has been eliminated. They did maintain some of those colonies, but through programs of vaccination where they were not able to sacrifice some of the animals they were able to eliminate it. Of course, that doesn't mean that it may not be present in somebody's freezer in tu mors; and this is one of the problems that we're greatly concerned with -the great deal of exchange of tumors that is currently going on.\n\nAnd, in fact, we believe that it was imported into the United States from abroad by a tumor importation and, I think, this is something that everybody should be aware of and certain a continual monitoring for ectromelia in all colonies, I would say, is essential. I don't think the agent is currently active in any colonies in the U.S. and you made a very good point -it was not present in any commercial colo nies during that period when we had outbreaks recently.\n\nYou made a good point about screening tumors. I said earlier a dangerous thing to a mouse is a mouse with a mouse disease but so are tumors and cell cultures, and things like that.\n\nWe use a lot of those things at our institute, but we screen all of those as well for not just ectromelia but a long list of potential agents that can be carried, because that's an easy way to bring things into your colony as well.\n\nIf you don't mind, while I'm here I'd like to make one comment about something that was said earlier.\n\nOne thing that was a surprise to me -we in the last two and a half years have had three shipments of animals that did break with sialodacryoadenitis and we were certain that it didn't come from the originating colony because of health screening at that colony; and it's very likely that is occurred from ship ping.\n\nAnd so while your animals are in transit, it's another possibility that they'll pick up an organism; and ours were in filter boxes and we did our best to avoid those things.\n\nThe other encouraging thing was that in the 3 times that we brought it into our facility it never spread past the original group of animals -which again surprised me because I thought if we ever got it in the building that it would spread through everything since all our other animals are so susceptible.\n\nBut, the other management things that we did kept it from spreading.\n\nSo those management things do work. We did pick the SDA up in all three cases clinically before we got any word back on serology, so that's the nice thing about SDA is it's easy to find it if your technicians are looking.\n\nAnd then on Mycoplasma, we've had our share of trouble with Mycoplasma, not the disease but the diagnosis. I argue with Lindsey and Gail Cassell all the time about this, but I don't believe the test is reliable for mice even at this point.\n\nThey withdrew the commercial kit ELISA for Mycoplasma from the market for awhile because it didn't work in mice and we're still having trouble.\n\nAnd we have the same experience you do, we send the same sample to different labs and get different results.\n\nSo I don't think the kit, at least, works for mice. Now, with rats we've been able to prove every case where we found a titer; we've been able to culture organisms and we've also found some of what we think are non-pathogenic Mycoplasma because they're rats that have been in the facility for a very long period of time and show no lesions and we just got fortunate and cultured the right spot to find a very small incidence of what's probably a non pathogenic Mycoplasma. Now, we weren't smart enough to hang onto these Mycoplasma; if we find any more, we're going to study them further to find out if they are different.\n\nIt may be that we've come full circle on that; maybe Mycoplasma really isn't a pathogen when it's there as a individual in fection.\n\nIt may still be that Sendai or PVM or something else potentiates that.\n\nBut I would not trust ELISA for mice"}
