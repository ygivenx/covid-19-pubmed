{"title": "Presence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus antibodies in Saudi Arabia: a nationwide, cross-sectional, serological study", "body": "Background Scientifi c evidence suggests that dromedary camels are the intermediary host for the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). However, the actual number of infections in people who have had contact with camels is unknown and most index patients cannot recall any such contact. We aimed to do a nationwide serosurvey in Saudi Arabia to establish the prevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies, both in the general population and in populations of individuals who have maximum exposure to camels.\n\nIn the cross-sectional serosurvey, we tested human serum samples obtained from healthy individuals older than 15 years who attended primary health-care centres or participated in a national burden-of-disease study in all 13 provinces of Saudi Arabia. Additionally, we tested serum samples from shepherds and abattoir workers with occupational exposure to camels. Samples were screened by recombinant ELISA and MERS-CoV seropositivity was confi rmed by recombinant immunofl uorescence and plaque reduction neutralisation tests. We used two-tailed Mann Whitney U exact tests, \u03c7\u00b2, and Fisher's exact tests to analyse the data. \n\nAs of March 8, 2015, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has caused at least 1082 mostly severe cases of respiratory infection, 439 of these fatal, since its discovery in 2012. 1 Apart from its geographical focus in countries in and around the Arabian Peninsula and laboratory evidence of widespread infection of dromedary camels, little is known about the actual epidemiology of the disease in human beings. 1-5 Few primary infections were acquired through direct camel exposure, but the relevance of this infection pattern is unclear in the absence of systematic determinations of the proportion of infections in individuals who have had contact with camels. 5-7 Moreover, most reported patients with primary MERS-CoV infection have no history of camel exposure, suggesting the existence of other, as-yetunknown sources of infection. Camel milk as a foodborne source seems unlikely. 8 For secondary infections acquired through human-tohuman contact, mathematical projections predicted that transmission chains in the population cannot be sustained. 9-11 The apparent transmission rate in household settings is low, with fewer than 50% of index patients transmitting the infection to contacts who subsequently had no pronounced clinical symptoms. 12 in people, in terms of replication in cell culture, immune escape, or excretion level. 13 Undiscovered MERS-CoV infections might thus exist in the human population.\n\nSerology is key to the understanding of infection statistics at a population level. However, only a few serological studies of MERS-CoV have been done. 14,15 Although none of those preliminary studies showed any evidence of previous infection with MERS-CoV in the population of Saudi Arabia, the examined cohorts have been small and methods applied in those studies have not been validated for sensitivity and specifi city. We previously presented the fi rst validated recombinant ELISA (rELISA) for MERS-CoV and combined this test with recombinant immuno fl uorescence assay (rIFA) and a plaque reduction virus neutralisation test (PRNT) into a staged strategy for MERS-CoV serology that was shown to identify even subclinical infections on detection of specifi c antibodies. 12 Here, we apply the established testing algorithm on a nationwide serum collection. Additional serum samples were obtained from individuals occupationally exposed to dromedary camels.\n\nFor the cross-sectional serosurvey we used existing sample collections organised by the Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia. Individual serum samples were obtained from healthy people older than 15 years, selected to represent all ages (excluding children and adolescents <15 years) in the Saudi Arabian population. Samples were obtained with written informed consent given to the Ministry of Health from participants in households randomly selected in a population-based, cross-sectional sampling frame maintained and updated by the National Census Bureau. 16 Participants lived and gave samples in all 13 provinces of Saudi Arabia. Sampling was done through primary healthcare centres and hospitals under the supervision of the Ministry of Health. We obtained two collections of serum samples from local primary health-care clinics for individuals selected to participate in a survey of the national burden of disease, 16,17 and a second collection of samples from individuals selected for a national study of the seroprevalence of herpes simplex virus.\n\nAdditionally, we obtained serum samples from camel shepherds who participated in an ad hoc MERS-CoV surveillance study implemented by the Ministry of Health and expatriate slaughterhouse workers in Makkah. The shepherds gave verbal consent and the slaughterhouse workers gave direct written consent in the frame of the ad hoc surveillance study.\n\nAll serum samples were anonymised before the study and were tested for MERS-CoV antibodies without further institutional review, because the testing of all samples was done as part of a public health intervention by the Saudi Ministry of Health. We applied an anti-MERS-CoV ELISA IgG (EUROIMMUN AG, L\u00fcbeck, Germany) with minor modifi cations. The rELISA was based on the soluble MERS-CoV spike protein subdomain S1. 18 This highly sensitive assay has been validated for use with human serum samples. 12 Samples were applied at a 1/100 dilution. The cutoff optical density ratio was set to 0\u00b73, which is three times the ratio of the mean value of all tested human serum samples without known exposure to camels.\n\nWe used rIFA to substantiate rELISA results because rIFA has been shown to be more specifi c than rELISA. 12 rIFA was done with the full MERS-CoV spike openreading frame expressed in VeroB4 cells. 12, 19 For IgG detection, serum samples were tested at a 1/40 dilution. For IgM detection, samples were analysed at 1/20 and 1/100 dilutions.\n\nWe did plaque reduction neutralisation tests (PRNT) as previously described. 20 The fi rst applied dilution of a twofold dilution series was 1/10. In accordance with our previous study, 12 we defi ned a 1/20 dilution as the lowest possible diagnostically signifi cant titre. 20 We recorded serum dilutions conferring 50% and 90% plaque reduction as PRNT 50 and PRNT 90 titres, respectively.\n\nWe defi ned stage 1 seropositivity as reactivity in both rELISA (dilution 1/100) and rIFA (dilution 1/40). We defi ned stage 2 seropositivity as stage 1 seropositivity plus reactivity in PRNT with a reciprocal titre of at least 20 on PRNT 50 . We regarded stage 2 seropositive results as serological confi rmation of past MERS-CoV infection.\n\nTo compare the age distribution of patients with serologically confi rmed cases with that of patients with clinically apparent cases, we examined data from international case-notifi cation statistics 21 and index-case data from a study of household contact clusters. 12\n\nWe did a two-tailed Mann Whitney U exact test with SPSS software (version 21). We did \u03c7\u00b2 tests and Fisher's exact tests, and calculated CIs with OpenEpi (Open Source Epidemiologic Statistics for Public Health). We applied \u03c7\u00b2 tests in the seroprevalence calculations of the general population versus camel-exposed individuals and for comparisons of agegroups. We used Fisher's exact tests for calculations of geographical and gender comparisons. We applied the non-parametric Mann Whitney U test to compare the mean ages of patients with MERS in diff erent studies.\n\nThe funders of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. The corresponding authors had full access to all the data in the study and had fi nal responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.\n\nBetween April 1, and June 30, 2013, we obtained 5765 serum samples from local primary health-care The mean sample size per province was 770 (range 321 to 2343 [SD 585]), representing between 19\u00b77 and 97\u00b71 samples per 100 000 individuals per province (mean 52\u00b79, SD 26\u00b77). The age distribution of samples with available age information matched that of the population of Saudi Arabia (fi gure 1). Of the 8719 individuals with available demographic information, 4341 (50%) were male.\n\nAll serum samples from the general population were fi rst screened for MERS-CoV-specifi c IgG by rELISA, yielding reactive results in 152 (1\u00b752%, 95% CI 1\u00b729-1\u00b778) of 10 009 samples. Subsequent testing by rIFA and PRNT 50 confi rmed less than 0\u00b72% to be stage 1 and stage 2 seropositive (table 1; appendix). Because repeat samples were missing, the timepoint of seroconversion was established by IgM detection. Coronavirus IgM had been previously shown to be maintained for a maximum of 180 days after infection. 22 Only one of 15 seropositive individuals had a reciprocal MERS-CoV IgM titre of at least 100, suggesting recent seroconversion (appendix). In accordance with our previous study, 12 seropositivity with rELISA was ten times higher than with rIFA. Seroprevalence did not diff er between the two subcohorts (seven [0\u00b716%] of 4244 patients in the primary healthcare study group vs eight [0\u00b714%] of 5765 in the burden of disease study cohort group, p=0\u00b794; appendix). Men had a higher proportion of infections (11 [0\u00b725%] of 4341) than did women (two [0\u00b705%] of 4378; p=0\u00b7025). Cases were identifi ed in four of six age groups without signifi cant age preference (appendix).\n\nConfi rmed cases of MERS-CoV infection were identifi ed in six of the 13 administrative provinces of Saudi Arabia, with higher numbers in central provinces that generally are more rural (fi gure 2). The 13 provinces were classifi ed into seven central and six coastal provinces, on the basis of whether they had a shoreline. Signifi cantly more confi rmed infections were in central provinces (14 [0\u00b726%] of 5479 samples) than in coastal provinces (one [0\u00b702%] of 4529; p=0\u00b7003). Data are n (%; 95% CI) from a serosurvey, unless otherwise specifi ed. p values refer to comparison with the general population cohort (\u03c7\u00b2 test with Yates correction two-tail test; OpenEpi). rELISA=recombinant ELISA. NA=not applicable. The proportion of both camel shepherds and slaughterhouse workers who were seropositive was signifi cantly higher than in the general population (table 1) . Seropositive individuals were identifi ed in fi ve of six age groups with even distribution (appendix).\n\nBoth registered patients (ie, patients with confi rmed MERS) 21 and index patients from the household study were signifi cantly older than the serologically confi rmed individuals in our present study (table 2; detailed laboratory results in the appendix).\n\nIn our study, we identifi ed antibodies against MERS-CoV in 0\u00b715% of samples from the general Saudi Arabian population. The true number of infections is diffi cult to estimate because our sample consisted of only 10 009 (0\u00b703%) of the whole population of 29 994 300 people. However, by combining two cross-sectional sub cohorts we could cover all 13 provinces and achieved an age distribution of our sample that largely matched that of the general population (panel). All geographical regions of the country were sampled with a reasonably low variation in the proportions of population that were studied per province. To have optimum sample coverage per province, we included samples from an earlier study (unpublished report) for which detailed information about sex and age was not available for 26% of samples. Nevertheless, samples from both subcohorts should be similar in age and sex composition because both were previously obtained according to calculations by the National Census Bureau to represent the composition of the Saudi Arabian population. This similarity was lent support by the highly similar seroprevalence when we analysed both subcohorts separately. Even if we had only used data from the more thoroughly documented burden-of-disease study subcohort for which we had sex and age information for 97% of the samples, the overall seroprevalence would have been maintained (0\u00b715% in the overall sample vs 0\u00b714% in the subcohort).\n\nTo obtain an estimate of the total number of seropositive individuals in Saudi Arabia we did a straightforward extrapolation based on the proportion of stage-2-positive serum samples in both population subcohorts (excluding shepherd and slaughterhouse worker samples). Extrapolation by simple multiplication suggests that 44 951 seropositive individuals (95% CI 26 971-71 922) could exist in a total population of 29 994 300. Our serological assays might have missed some infections because the high specifi city of rIFA and PRNT could encompass a reduction in sensitivity of the overall serological algorithm. However, even a projection based on rELISA results only would raise the estimated infection rate by about ten times, which is several orders \n\nWe did the fi rst nationwide cross-sectional serosurvey for MERS-CoV antibodies in the population of Saudi Arabia to explore the putative presence of unrecorded MERS-CoV infections. We noted that 0\u00b715% of mainly male individuals in six of 13 had specifi c anti-MERS-CoV antibodies. Additionally, we identifi ed a seroprevalence of MERS-CoV that was 15-23 times higher in camel-exposed individuals such as shepherds and slaughterhouse workers than in the general population. None of the individuals who tested positive for MERS-CoV antibodies had severe illness before or at the time of sampling. The mean age of all identifi ed seroconverted individuals was signifi cantly lower than that of patients with MERS admitted to hospital. In summary, our data suggest that middle-aged men with regular camel contact could sporadically introduce MERS-CoV into the general population. These subclinically infected individuals might represent the unknown source of infection for the many reported patients with MERS with no anamnestic camel exposure.\n\nanalysed data.

In accordance with our previous study, 12 seropositivity with rELISA was ten times higher than that with rIFA. 12 This rise can be attributed to the higher sensitivity of rELISA and by putative crossreactivity of low-affi nity IgG, which is raised in individuals with recent infections from the common-cold coronavirus. 23 Despite low detection rates, antibodies were identifi ed widely across Saudi Arabia, including in provinces where outbreaks in people have not been reported. Widespread acquisition of infections without subsequent causation of outbreaks corresponds to the concept of a predominantly zoonotic disease that does not readily spread between human beings. The raised prevalence in rural regions and the signifi cantly increased proportion of infection in groups that are occupationally exposed to camels emphasises the importance of zoonotic acquisitions by dromedary camels. 5-7 However, even though the analysed shepherd samples were collected in six diff erent regions during the fi rst months of 2014, the sampling was not randomised and samples were not strictly taken at the same time as those from the general population. Similar limitations apply for the slaughterhouse worker samples. Direct comparison of seroprevalences between these groups and the general population cohort might thus be biased. Matched case-control studies could be used to substantiate the raised seroprevalence in exposed groups.\n\nDirect animal contact has been reported for only a few primary cases in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere. The younger age of serologically confi rmed patients in our study compared with people with laboratory confi rmed infection underlines the possibility that MERS-CoV might cause unrecognised infections that cause no or mild symptoms in healthy, younger (aged 15-44 years), and socially active populations. These subclinical infections could act as an unknown source for index patients who cannot recall contact with camels. Importantly, the predominance of men even within serologically confi rmed cases emphasises a potential association with animal exposure because, typically, more men than women in Saudi Arabia associate with camels during leisure activities. Cases of MERS in younger people (aged <45 years) might seem mild or even subclinical, similar to cases in our study of household contact clusters, 12 in which contacts were younger than index patients and mostly asymptomatic. MERS might constitute a zoonotic disease that causes enough shorttransmission chains in the young male population of Saudi Arabia, for which older and predisposed individuals constitute a sentinel population.\n\nMAM did the experiments, designed and coordinated the study, wrote the manuscript, analysed data, and generated fi gures.
