{"title": "Differential diagnosis of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infection by detection of haemagglutinin with an enzyme-linked immunoassay", "body": "Over 214 countries had reported confirmed cases of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (pH1N1) infection and at least 18 449 deaths were noted as of 6 August 2010 [1] . The spread of the virus highlights the importance of having convenient and reliable methods for diagnosis. Currently, RT-PCR is the mainstay for specific diagnosis of pH1N1 virus infection in the clinic, but its utility is questionable, because of the requirement for specialized equipment and long turn-around time. Hence, rapid influenza diagnosis tests (RIDTs) have been used on many occasions [2] . However, RIDTs cannot efficiently differentiate pH1N1 virus infection from seasonal influenza A virus infection, as they have poor sensitivity [2] [3] [4] [5] , with consequences for clinical management. Therefore, a sensitive and convenient immunoassay that can differentiate the pH1N1 virus from seasonal influenza virus is desirable. In this study, with haemagglutinin (HA) of pH1N1 virus as the detection target, a double-sandwich ELISA (pH1N1 ELISA) was developed and evaluated for its ability to differentiate pH1N1 virus from other respiratory pathogens, including seasonal influenza viruses.\n\nMonoclonal antibodies used for pH1N1 ELISA Two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (10B4 and 1E12) that recognize the cluster-specific epitopes in HA of pH1N1 virus were created by immunizing with a pH1N1 isolate (A/California/04/2009(H1N1)) in mice. The specificities of the two mAbs were determined in a series of influenza viral isolates, using haemagglutination inhibition assays and cellbased microneutralization assays, performed as previously described [6, 7] (Table 1) . mAb 10B4 was then coated on the microplate, and mAb 1E12 was conjugated with horseradish peroxidase.\n\nDetection protocol of pH1N1 ELISA A schematic diagram of the principle and manipulation of pH1N1 ELISA is shown in Fig. 1 . For detection by pH1N1 ELISA, 50 lL of viral lysis buffer was added to the coated wells, and a 100-lL specimen aliquot was then added and mixed. After incubation for 60 min at 37\u00b0C, the plate was washed five times with a washing buffer. Then, 100 lL of 1E12-horseradish peroxidase solution was added to each well and incubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. After five washes, 100 lL of tetramethylbenzidine substrate solution was added and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 15 min, and the optical density (OD) 450/630 nm was measured with a microplate reader (Sunrise, Tecan, Switzerland) (Fig. 1) . The final result was obtainable within 105 min. The cut-off value was set as mean + 4 standard deviations, equal to 2.1-fold of the mean value of two negative control wells or 0.105 if the mean negati value was <0.05. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, nasopharyngeal aspirate/nasopharyngeal swab (NPS), nasal swab/nasal wash, throat wash, oropharyngeal swab, cell culture supernatant and allantoic fluid specimens were available for the test without any pretreatment. However, the swab specimens need to be transported in viral transport medium (phosphate-buffered saline solution containing 100 U/mL kanamycin and 120 U/mL ampicillin) before testing.\n\nSeven pH1N1 strains (Table 1) , 78 influenza A virus strains (non-pH1N1), 20 influenza B virus strains and 59 strains of other common respiratory pathogens were used to determine the analytical sensitivity and cross-reactions of pH1N1 ELISA (Tables 2 and 3) .\n\nClinical specimens from patients with influenza-like illness (ILI) were collected in Xi'an City, north-western China, where the first confirmed pH1N1 patient, a university student, was reported on 26 June 2009. After a 2-month summer vacation ending at the end of August, a pH1N1 outbreak in Xian occurred in a university, such that, by 4 September, over 50 students were hospitalized. As the pandemic progressed, 920 patients reported fever, cough or other symptoms of ILI for the period from 24 to 27 September at Xijing Hospital (Xian, China). Given these circumstances, permission to conduct a laboratory-based study was obtained from the institutional review board of Xijing Hospital. From this cohort, 904 (98.3%), patients were recruited into the study. NPS specimens from these patients were carefully collected by using sterile polyester, according to a standard method [8] , and were transported to the microbiology laboratory in 1.5 mL of viral transport medium. The time of sampling was <48 h post-onset for each patient.\n\nThe specimens of ILI were first tested by CDC real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR). For the test, viral RNA was extracted from 200-lL specimens by use of the Biomek NX Laboratory Automation Workstation (Beckman Coulters, Brea, CA, USA), and was then determined by the CDC recommended protocol [9] . The subtypes of influenza A virus were determined by DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. For the sequencing analysis, a 281-nucleotide fragment (nucleotides 84-370 in the NP gene of influenza A virus) was obtained by nested PCR. The first round of PCR was performed with an outer primer set of NPF1 (5\u00a2-AGC AAA AGC AGG GTA GAT AA-3\u00a2) and PyR533 (5\u00a2-AGT GTT GAA CCT TGC ATT AGA GAG-3\u00a2) for 30 cycles. The second round was performed with an inner primer set of PyF41 (5\u00a2-GAT CAT ATG AAC AAA TGG AGA CTG-3\u00a2) and PyR375 (5\u00a2-AAC TCT CCT TAT TTC TTC TTT GTC-3\u00a2). The PCR products were sequenced on an ABI Prism 3130X automatic genetic analyzer (Applied BioSystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The tree was constructed by the neighbour-joining method, with MEGA software, version 4.0. After these tests, all specimens were stored at )80\u00b0C. Two months later, all specimens were taken out and blindly tested by pH1N1 ELISA and BD Directigen EZ Flu A + B (RIDT; Becton, Shannon, County Clare, Ireland).\n\nThe sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were determined with the CDC rRT-PCR result as the reference standard. The unadjusted chi-square test was used for categorical independent variables. Estimation of the 95% CI was performed with exact binomial methods. Calculations were conducted with SPSS statistical software, version 16.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). \n\nThe lower detection limit of pH1N1 ELISA for viral isolates Seven pH1N1 viral isolates were two-fold serially diluted and tested by pH1N1 ELISA. The lower detection limit was determined as 10 3.0 \u00b1 0.4 tissue culture infective dose (TCID) 50 /mL (or 0.009 \u00b1 0.005 HA titer) ( Table 2 ).\n\nEvaluating the cross-reactions of pH1N1 ELISA Seventy-eight strains of influenza A virus (non-pH1N1, H1-H13 subtypes), 20 strains of influenza B virus and 15 types of other common respiratory pathogen were tested by pH1N1 ELISA; all were negative except for one bird strain of influenza A/H1N9 (A/WDK/Shantou/520/2000), for which the viral titre was higher than 16 HA (approximately 1800-fold higher than the lower detection limit of the assay) (Tables 3 and 4 ).\n\nIntra-assay reproducibility was evaluated from 20 measurements of four pH1N1-positive specimens. The mean OD values determined by pH1N1 ELISA of the specimens were 2.334 (10 4.4 TCID 50 /mL), 0.996 (10 4.0 TCID 50 /mL), 0.598 (10 3.8 TCID 50 /mL) and 0.378 (10 3.6 TCID 50 /mL), and the coefficients of variation were 4.0%, 4.3%, 4.5% and 4.1%, respectively. Inter-assay reproducibility was evaluated from 12 assays (six baths; two assays were randomly selected from each bath) with the same specimens, and the coefficients of variation were 5.8%, 4.5%, 5.3% and 2.9%, respectively.\n\nAmong the 904 ILI patients, with ages ranging from 6 months to 86 years, CDC rRT-PCR and sequencing analysis (shown in Supporting information in Fig. S1 ) revealed that 91 (10.1%) patients were infected with pH1N1 virus, 171 (18.9%) patients were infected with seasonal influenza A virus, including five seasonal H1, 152 seasonal H3 and 14 untyped cases (determined by phylogenetic analysis and shown in Fig. S1 ), and the remaining 642 (71.0%) patients were not infected with influenza A virus. The demographic characteristics of pH1N1 patients and seasonal influenza A patients in this cohort are described in Table 6 ). The signal/cut-off value of pH1N1 ELISA was negatively correlated with the cycle threshold value of CDC rRT-PCR (n = 91, R 2 =0.789; Fig. 2 ). This showed that the signal/cut-off value of the assay correlated well with viral load. The specificities of pH1N1 ELISA were 100.0% (171/ 171, 95% CI 97.9-100.0%) and 99.8% (640/642, 95% CI 99.1-99.9) in seasonal influenza A patients and in non-pH1N1 ILI patients, similar (p >0.05) to that of BD Directigen EZ Flu A + B (99.8%, 95% CI 99.1-99.9) ( Table 6 ). For pH1N1 ELISA in this cohort with a pH1N1 prevalence of 10.1%, the negative predictive value was 97.7%, higher than that of BD Directigen EZ Flu A + B (89.5%, p <0.01), and the positive predictive value was 99.1%, similar to that of the latter (99.5%, p 0.19).\n\nThe HA antigen of pH1N1 virus is genetically and serologically different from those of other annual seasonal influenza A viruses [7, 10, 11] . Hence, the use of immunoassays based on the pH1N1 virus cluster-specific antigenic determinants of HA could aid in the differentiation of pH1N1 virus infections from other infections. The concept has been demonstrated in this study and, to our knowledge, for the first time.\n\nThe sensitivity of the pH1N1 virus assay (92.3%, 95% CI 84.8-96.9) was significantly higher than that of BD Directigen EZ Flu A + B in nasopharyngeal specimens. The high sensitivity of the assay may be attributed to the high affinity of the mAbs used and/or enzyme-induced signal amplification. The assay also showed excellent specificity among seasonal influenza A patients (100%, 95% CI 96.4-100%) as well as among non-influenza A patients (99.7%, 95% CI 98.9-99.9%). Because of the low prevalence of seasonal H1 virus during the study period (0.6%, 95% CI 0.2-1.3%), only five seasonal H1-positive specimens were tested (all were negative). However, 78 strains of influenza A viral cultures (including 23 strains of H1N1 of human origin) and 20 strains of influenza B viral cultures were tested, with negative results being obtained by the assay even at much higher titres (over 1000-fold higher than the lower detection limit of the assay). This strongly suggests the assay does not cross-react with other influenza viruses (Table 3) . Interestingly, a strain of A/H1N9 (A/WDK/Shantou/520/2000) virus of bird origin tested positive at a titre of over 16 HA (approximately 1800-fold higher than the lower detection limit of the assay), and this may indicate a potential association between the former and pH1N1 virus.\n\nPandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection is responsible for serious lung damage [12] , especially in pregnant women [13] , young children and people with chronic diseases [14] . Regarding antiviral therapy, pH1N1 virus is sensitive to oseltamivir but seasonal influenza virus is usually resistant [15] . This argues for rapid diagnosis as part of the assessment of patients with ILI who present to the clinic. An accurate diagnosis will result in better medical care [16] . Accurate diagnosis of pH1N1 virus infection depends on several aspects: (i) quality of the specimen-nasopharyngeal specimens are more appropriate for detection (nasopharyngeal aspirate or NPS), especially for antigen testing [17, 18] ; (ii) the time when the specimen was collected in relation to the onset of symptoms-a previous study showed that the decrease in viral concentration was correlated with time elapsed from symptom onset [19] ; and (iii) the sensitivity and specificity of the tests used-previous studies demonstrated that most of the current RIDTs had sensitivities ranging from 11% to 88% [2, 20] , although they were very convenient for one-step operation. Hence, specimens that are negative by RIDT should undergo further testing with more sensitive assays. RT-PCR is the most sensitive method for the diagnosis of pH1N1 virus infection. However, it is expensive and timeconsuming. In an influenza pandemic, laboratories may have to process a large number of specimens in a short period (e.g. over 200 specimens per day in this study). In this study, even with the use of a high-throughput automation workstation (96 channels) for RNA extraction and PCR, detection of 200 specimens by RT-PCR would take a minimum of 6 h. Thus, a reliable ELISA for the detection pH1N1 virus infection will enhance the effectiveness of disease control in the following ways: (i) it has a shorter turn-around time; (ii) it has lower costs, making it practicable for developing countries; and (iii) it can be a suitable tool for surveillance in a large population.\n\nBecause of the overlapping of the dominant antigenic determinant regions with cell receptor binding sites in HA of influenza virus, the possibility of the occurrence of significant antigenic variation in HA increases with time. Hence, it is necessary to closely monitor the recognition abilities of the mAbs using in pandemic-specific HA assays, and update the mAbs when appropriate.\n\nAlthough there is a significant level of herd immunity against pH1N1 virus and despite the fact that vaccine is now available [7, [21] [22] [23] , there is still a substantial at-risk population. On the other hand, pH1N1 virus is evolving, and there is a possibility of more virulent strains emerging. Hence, a sensitive and convenient assay, as presented, for the direct detection pH1N1 virus has potentially important public healthy applications. However, the performance of this assay should be investigated in more specimens from other geographical areas.\n\nAll authors declare no conflicts of interest.\n\nAdditional Supporting Information may be found in the online version of this article: Figure S1 .
