{"title": "Candidate New Rotavirus Species in Sheltered Dogs, Hungary Technical Appendix", "body": "Ten percent fecal suspensions were prepared in phosphate buffered saline and then centrifuged at 5000 \u00d7 g for 10 min. Viral RNA was extracted by using the Zymo DirectZol kit (Zymo Research, Orange, CA, USA) combined with the RiboZol RNA extraction ragent (Amresco, Solon, OH, USA), according to the protocol recommended by the manufacturer for biological liquids, although DNase treatment was omitted from the workflow.\n\nThe RNA sample was subsequently denatured at 97\u00b0C for 5 min in the presence of 10 \u03bcM random hexamer tailed by a common PCR Analyzer.\n\nBecause of the significant sequence heterogeneity identified between the VP7 gene of KE135/2012 and KE528/2012, it seemed relevant to confirm the semiconductor sequencing results by using traditional sequencing. Therefore, the whole-genome segment encoding the VP7 gene was sequenced for both strains. cDNA production, amplification and Sanger sequencing were carried out with sequence specific primers (data not shown) designed based on the Ion Torrent sequence reads. The experimental protocol was essentially the same as described in the previous section describing the determination of genome segment termini. *The Muscle algorithm within the Translator X (1) online platform was used to obtain codon-based multiple alignments. Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence alignments were visualized in GeneDoc (2), whereas sequence distances were calculated with the MEGA6 program using the P distance algorithm (3) . Results obtained by this method were used to calculate sequence identity values. \u2020The VP7 gene was sequenced for both RVI strains by traditional methods as well. Of note is that Ion Torrent and Sanger sequencing results were congruent. \u2021Assignment of the NSP4 was not possible by homology search. However, structure-based analysis identified putative helical transmembrane (site aa 47-64 and/or 71-88) and coiled coil region (site aa 142-168) and predicted a glycosylation site (motif, NGS; site aa 31)."}
