{"title": "Is Fever a Red Flag for Bacterial Pneumonia in Children With Viral\nBronchiolitis?", "body": "Several previous studies have revealed potential morbidity from bacterial pneumonia\nin patients with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). RSV infection may increase the\nrisk for pneumococcal pneumonia.1 RSV increases the virulence of streptococcal pneumonia by binding to\npenicillin-binding protein 1a. Coinfection with RSV and Streptococcus\npneumoniae is associated with severe and often fatal pneumonia.2 Physicians must be mindful of the potential for secondary bacterial pneumonia\nin viral bronchiolitis so that it can be promptly treated.\n\nAs pediatricians, we follow the guidelines published by the American Academy of\nPediatrics. The 2014 guidelines dealing with evaluation and management of viral\nbronchiolitis promote supportive care, and note that routine radiographic or\nlaboratory studies are not necessary.3 While these guidelines are paramount to treating viral illness, it is\nimperative that the physician recognizes at what point further investigation is\nwarranted. Missing a secondary pneumonia could result in delay in antibiotic\ntreatment, transfer to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), or intubation.\n\nFollowing a respiratory season at our institution, we noted that children with viral\nillness who also had a fever tended to have a worse clinical course versus afebrile\npatients. We hypothesized that fever may be a marker for secondary bacterial\npneumonia in patients with viral bronchiolitis. Fever is defined as temperature\n\u2265100.4\u00b0F. If a patient developed a fever and the workup showed pneumonia, then\nantibiotics could be started quickly rather than waiting until after worsening of\nthe patient\u2019s clinical condition. Our hypothesis is based on the following anecdotal\nevidence from our practice:\n\nOur objective is to investigate whether children with viral bronchiolitis with fever\nare more likely to have a diagnosis of secondary bacterial pneumonia than their\ncounterparts without fever.\n\nThis research was submitted to our university institutional review board and was\napproved. The IRBNet ID is 1083099-2.\n\nOf the 349 children included in the study, 178 were RSV positive. The majority of\nchildren (56% or 100 children) with diagnoses of RSV were afebrile. Febrile children\nwho were RSV positive were more than twice as likely to be diagnosed with bacterial\npneumonia as those who were afebrile (47/78 or 60% vs 27/100 or 27%,\nP < .001). In the 171 children who had RSV-negative\nbronchiolitis (diagnosis of viral infection other than RSV), 88/171 (or 51%) were\nafebrile. Febrile children with RSV-negative bronchiolitis were 8 times more likely\nto be diagnosed with pneumonia as afebrile children (54/83 or 65% vs 7/88 or 8%,\nP < .001).\n\nAdditional bivariate and trivariate analyses of both RSV-positive and RSV-negative\nbronchiolitis did not show any significant difference between the occurrence of\npneumonia in children with fevers in the 100.4\u00b0F to 100.9\u00b0F range versus fevers in\nthe >102\u00b0F range.\n\nThe study demonstrates that fever can be used as a marker indicating a need to\ninvestigate for secondary bacterial pneumonia in children with RSV and other viral\nillnesses. Children with viral illnesses who had a fever were more likely to have\ndiagnoses of pneumonia, whether they had RSV-positive or RSV-negative illness. The\nliterature supports the need to be wary of the possibility of bacterial pneumonia in\nchildren with bronchiolitis. RSV infection decreases bacterial clearance,\npotentially predisposing to secondary bacterial pneumonia despite increased lung\ncellular inflammation, and suggests that functional changes occur in the recruited\nneutrophils that may contribute to the decreased bacterial clearance.5 Bacterial infection, based on a significant rise of antibody titer and/or on\ndetection of pneumococcal antigen in serum or urine, was observed in 39% of the\nchildren with RSV infection. We conclude that a bacterial pathogen should be\nactively sought when managing patients with lower respiratory tract syndromes,\nespecially in those who have evidence of RSV infection.6 The interaction between viruses and bacteria is probably much more common and\nclinically significant than previously understood. Respiratory viruses frequently\ninitiate the cascade of events that ultimately leads to bacterial infection. Early\nrecognition and treatment of these patients will lessen morbidity and mortality.6 Based on the findings at our institution, we believe that fever is a marker\nindicating a need to investigate for bacterial pneumonia. There are several\nlimitations to our study. Since sputum cultures are not collected unless a patient\nis intubated, a definitive bacterial cause cannot be confirmed in most cases. As\npreviously discussed in methods, the diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia is a physician\njudgment. Part of the reason our study is important is that literature does not\nelucidate any way to definitively determine the presence of bacterial pneumonia in a\nnon-intubated child. Several studies have tried to address this issue. CRP is\nelevated when bacterial pneumonia is present, but it has less than desirable\nspecificity for distinguishing viral from bacterial pneumonia.7,8 Procalcitonin is a better\nindicator than CRP. A procalcitonin less <0.1 has been found to rule out\nbacterial infection; however, higher values show overlap in procalcitonin levels\nfound in viral and bacterial sources.9 Therefore, we are left with clinical judgement based on looking at multiple\nfactors. Since laboratory testing and imaging are discouraged in the initial\nmanagement of bronchiolitis, perhaps fever can indicate such testing is justified to\nassist physicians in clinical decision making.\n\nA subsequent study will further examine the prevalence of fever during RSV\nbronchiolitis. Literature shows that some viruses such as adenovirus and enterovirus\ndefinitely cause fever.10 Our anecdotal experience is that children with RSV alone usually do not have\nfevers unless they have a secondary bacterial infection. For the sake of clarity in\nour future study, we will exclude viral causes other than RSV. While our current\nstudy shows the majority of children with bronchiolitis do not have fevers, we did\nnot investigate other causes of fever such as pyelonephritis and otitis media. The\nfuture study will look for these additional possible bacterial causes of fever and\nmay show an even lower percentage of children with just RSV bronchiolitis who have a\nfever.\n\nFebrile children with viral bronchiolitis were 2 to 8 times more likely to be\ndiagnosed with a secondary bacterial pneumonia compared with their afebrile\ncounterparts. Delay in care of respiratory illnesses can significantly increase\nmorbidity and mortality. Further research is warranted to investigate the need for\nmore aggressive evaluation of febrile children with viral bronchiolitis. We are\naware of the limitations and plan to further investigate our findings. We feel this\nstudy is relevant because the data discussed could result in a change in practice\nfor viral bronchiolitis in our young patient population."}
