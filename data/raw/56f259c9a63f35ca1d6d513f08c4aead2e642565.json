{"title": "", "body": "Macroautophagy, more commonly referred to simply as autophagy, is a fundamental cellular process in eukary otes that is essential for responding and adapting to changes in the environment. In its most common form, autophagy involves sequestration of cytosolic material within a doublemembranebound vesicle, termed the autophagosome, and the subsequent fusion of the auto phagosome with endolysosomal vesicles leads to deg radation and recycling of the sequestered substrates. A crucial function of autophagy is to breakdown macro molecules such as proteins to provide amino acids and other factors necessary to generate energy and synth esize new proteins. The ability to capture large material distinguishes this pathway from proteasomal degra dation, making autophagy necessary for maintaining cellular homeostasis in a variety of settings. Many of the substrates found within autophagosomes are those that threaten cell viability, such as damaged organelles, protein aggregates and intracellular pathogens.\n\nAlthough autophagosomes are detected under steadystate conditions, their generation is increased substantially in response to stressors, of which nutrient deprivation is the best characterized. Depletion of amino acids or growth factors induces autophagy by inhibiting mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a master regulator of metabolism that inhibits the ULK1 autophagy complex through phosphorylation under nutrient replete conditions (BOX 1) . Once freed from inhibition, the ULK1 complex phosphorylates beclin 1 to activate the phosphoinositide 3kinase catalytic subunit type III (PI3KC3) complex 1 , which creates phosphatidyl inositol3phosphate (PtdIns3P)rich subdomains at regions associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), such as the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment or ERmitochondria contact sites 2,3 . PtdIns3Pbinding proteins then recruit the ATG16L1 complex to this autophago some precursor site (known as the isolation membrane) 4 . The ATG16L1 complex anchors the ubiquitin like molecule LC3 to the lipid bilayer by conjugating LC3 to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (BOX 1) . Next, the LC3-PE complex mediates membrane tethering and fusion to extend the isolation membrane by recruiting lipids, which are likely to be derived from multiple mem brane sources, including endosomal vesicles harbour ing the transmembrane protein ATG9L1. The growing isolation membrane eventually fuses with itself to form the enclosed doublemembrane structure, and class C vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) and SNARElike proteins mediate fusion with endolysosomal vesicles leading to the degradation and recycling of the contents.\n\nIn this article, the function and regulation of auto phagy in the context of inflammatory signals is reviewed. It is now appreciated that autophagy is critical to both cellautonomous defence and multicellular immunity, and autophagy dysfunction appears to be a recurring theme in inflammatory disease. First, the general func tions of autophagy in immunity are summarized. The focus of the second section is on specific modes of Xenophagy A cell-intrinsic defence mechanism involving the selective degradation of microorganisms (such as bacteria, fungi, parasites and viruses) through an autophagy-related mechanism.\n\nSequestosome 1 (SQSTM1).

Through incorporation into the autophagosome, SQSTM1 itself becomes a substrate for autophagic degradation.\n\nintersection between autophagy and immune pathways, specifically signalling pathways downstream of innate immune sensors. The third section provides examples of how these mechanisms contribute to multicellu lar immune responses, with an emphasis on adaptive immunity and inflammatory disease. Finally, the barriers for targeting the autophagy pathway to treat disease are discussed.\n\nThe role of autophagy in immunity Autophagy can eliminate an infectious threat by promoting a form of autophagy termed xenophagy, whereby intracellular pathogens such as viruses, bac teria and proto zoa are trapped within an autophago some and targeted to the lysosome for destruction. Xenophagy depends on adaptor molecules that crosslink pathogens with the autophagy machinery. For instance, sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1; also known as p62), nuclear domain 10 protein NDP52, optineurin (OPTN) and TAX1binding protein 1 (TAX1BP1) bind LC3, in con junction with host molecules associated with damaged Salmonellacontaining vacuoles, including ubiquitin and galectin 8 (REF. 5 ). These binding events allow the isola tion membrane to grow around the bacteria, resulting in its sequestration within the autophagosome. One of the most compelling evidence that autophagy is an impor tant cellintrinsic defence mechanism is that many inva sive pathogens encode virulence factors that counteract the pathway, as exemplified by the LC3deconjugating enzyme RavZ secreted by Legionella pneumophila 6 . Also, enteroviruses can use autophagy to provide a membrane coat that enhances celltocell spread 7 .\n\nThe generation of the autophagosome is mediated by the sequential activities of three key protein complexes: the ULK1 complex (comprising ULK1, FIP200, ATG13 and ATG101), the phosphoinositide 3-kinase catalytic subunit type III (PI3KC3) complex (comprising beclin 1, vacuolar protein sorting 34 (VPS34), VPS15 and ATG14L), and the ATG16L1 complex (comprising ATG16L1, ATG5 and ATG12). Inhibition of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), such as through nutrient deprivation, allows the ULK1 complex to activate the PI3KC3 complex (see the figure) . Following the creation of phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns3P)-rich regions on the surface of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi intermediate compartment or other membranes, the ATG16L1 complex is recruited by the PtdIns3P-binding protein WIPI2 to the autophagosome precursor structure (that is, the isolation membrane). The ATG16L1 complex is generated through an ubiquitin-like (UBL) conjugation reaction in which the UBL molecule ATG12 is conjugated to ATG5 by the sequential action of ATG7 and ATG10. ATG16L1 non-covalently binds the ATG5-ATG12 conjugate to form a multimeric complex. In parallel, another UBL molecule, LC3, is processed by the ATG4 protease and subjected to a second UBL conjugation reaction involving ATG7 and ATG3. The ATG16L1 complex conjugates LC3 and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) to complete the reaction. LC3-PE mediates membrane tethering and fusion to extend the isolation membrane by recruiting membranes from multiple sources, eventually leading to self-fusion and the formation of the autophagosome. Subsequent fusion with the lysosome, mediated by class C vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) and SNARE-like proteins (not shown), leads to the degradation of the sequestered substrates. Some pathogens are neutralized by non canonical functions of the autophagy machinery, herein referred to as 'noncanonical autophagy' (BOX 2) . For instance, LC3associated phagocytosis (LAP) mediates phagosome maturation and requires many of the same proteins as conventional autophagy, but it occurs independently of autophagosome formation 8 . Another form of non canonical autophagy induced by interferon\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3) restricts the replication of norovirus and Toxoplasma gondii in macrophages in a lysosomeindependent man ner [9] [10] [11] . In the case of T. gondii infection, the ATG16L1 complex and LC3 disrupt the parasitophorous vacuole by recruiting the p47 immunityrelated GTPases (IRGs) and the p65 guanylatebinding proteins (GBPs) 9,12-15 . Although it is not always clear whether the classical or an unconventional form of autophagy is involved in host defence, autophagy proteins remain strong candidates as drug targets in infectious disease. Indeed, inducing autophagy with a cellpermeable beclin 1 peptide protects against several pathogens in vitro and in vivo, including chikungunya virus and West Nile virus 16 .\n\nAutophagy also reduces the amount of damage caused by pathogens. For example, during Sindbis virus infection, autophagy protects against neuronal cell death without affecting the degree of viral replica tion 17 . Similarly, in the absence of ATG16L1, the benefi cial intestinal virus murine norovirus (MNV) 18 triggers intestinal pathologies in mice through the cytokines tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and IFN\u03b3 19 . Viral rep lication is unaltered in these mice 19 , consistent with a role for autophagy in suppressing the negative impact of inflammatory cytokines produced in responses to an enteric virus. Furthermore, expression of transcrip tion factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of autophagy and lysosomal genes, protects Caenorhabditis elegans from Staphylococcus aureus infection by promoting a cytoprotective transcriptional response 20 . Autophagy is also essential for the survival of mice with S. aureus mediated bacteraemia and pneumonia: instead of reducing bacterial burden in these animals, autophagy promotes the viability of endothelial cells in the pres ence of a poreforming toxin produced by widely circu lating methicillinresistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains 21 . The vulnerability of autophagydeficient endothelial cells is due to an increase in the expression of the toxin receptor ADAM10 at the protein level 21 , indicating that the protein turnover function of autophagy can indi rectly contribute to infectious disease susceptibility. Therapeutically increasing autophagy also improves survival in a mouse model of sepsis by reducing the level of inflammation in the lungs 22 . Thus, in addition to resistance mechanisms aimed at reducing the number of intracellular infectious agents, autophagy facilitates tolerance mechanisms that reduce the adverse effect of an infection 23 .\n\nA related function of autophagy is to inhibit the pro duction of soluble inflammatory mediators, which can come at the cost of diminishing host defence. Deficiency in autophagy proteins protects against intestinal infection by Citrobacter rodentium, improves survival during lung infection by influenza virus and prevents reactivation Box 2 | Non-canonical autophagy and immunity Several processes have been described in which subsets of the canonical autophagy pathway (see box figure, part a) contribute to immune responses, frequently independent of autophagosome formation. LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP) mediates the maturation of phagosomes containing TLR ligands independently of the ULK1 complex, but requires the association of rubicon with the phosphoinositide 3kinase catalytic subunit type III (PI3KC3) complex 8 (see box figure, part b) . Brucella abortus subverts the ULK1 and PI3KC3 complexes, but not the ATG16L1 complex or LC3, to generate pathogen-containing vacuoles that can either be single or double membrane structures 160 (see box figure, part c) . The recruitment of interferon-\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3) effector molecules (such as immunity-related GTPases (IRGs) and guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs)) to the parasitophorous vacuole during Toxoplasma gondii infection is dependent on the ATG16L1 complex but not autophagosome formation or lysosomes 11 (see box figure, part d). A similar process is involved in inhibition of norovirus replication by IFN\u03b3 10 .\n\nIn addition to non-canonical autophagy, there is a growing list of examples in which autophagy proteins have been observed to function independently of other components of the autophagy machinery in ways that were previously not considered possible. ATG5 prevents neutrophil-mediated lung damage during Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection independently of the other ATG16L1 complex members, and it is unclear whether this function represents a type of non-canonical autophagy or a new function of ATG5 (REF. 161 ). Coronavirus replication occurs on endoplasmic reticulum-derived membranes decorated by the unconjugated form of LC3 and does not require the rest of the autophagy machinery 162 . ATG9L1 represses DNA stimulation of STING independently of the LC3 conjugation machinery 73 . LC3 can be recruited to double-membrane structures containing internalized Salmonella spp. in the absence of ATG9L1 and subunits of the ULK1 and PI3KC3 complexes 163 , challenging the assumption that the mechanism of autophagy in response to starvation is conserved during xenophagy. Furthermore, the inhibitory activity of ATG16L1 on nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 1 (NOD1) and NOD2 signalling can occur independently of the autophagy function of this protein 164 . CD4 + T cell-mediated recognition of dendritic cells harbouring T. gondii was shown to depend on ATG5 and not ATG7 (REF. 165 ). This finding is unexpected because incorporation of ATG5 into the ATG16L1 complex is dependent on ATG7 and suggests the existence of another unknown function for ATG5 in dendritic cells. These findings collectively indicate that investigating one autophagy protein is insufficient to make conclusions about the role of canonical or non-canonical autophagy in a given immune process. NOX2, NADPH oxidase 2; TLR, Toll-like receptor. \n\nA multi-protein oligomer that catalyses the autoactivation of caspase 1, which cleaves pro-IL-1\u03b2 and pro-IL-18 to produce the active forms of these cytokines.\n\nAn inflammatory form of programmed cell death that is dependent on inflammasome-mediated activation of caspase 1.\n\nof latent murine herpesvirus 68 (MHV68) [24] [25] [26] . The enhanced host defence in these models is associated with large scale increases in cytokine levels and/or inflammatory gene expression. Although inhibition of autophagy confers a shortterm benefit during infection by these specific pathogens, the longterm consequence of this heightened immunity may be chronic inflamma tory disease. Additionally, as the above examples with S. aureus, Sindbis virus and a large number of other studies illustrate, autophagy is usually beneficial to the host during a lifethreatening infection. Therefore, the ultimate function of autophagy in immunity may be to mediate a balanced immune response whereby the majority of infectious threats are neutralized while mini mizing damage to the host, thereby staving off longterm disease.\n\nConvergence of autophagy and immune signalling Amino acid starvation during bacterial infection can induce autophagy 27 , raising the possibility that sensing changes in nutrient availability is an ancient mechanism to initiate autophagy in response to infectious threats. As the immune system evolved, autophagy and related pathways have been integrated into the complex sig nalling networks that coordinate multicellular defence strategies. An array of pathogen and damageassociated molecular patterns (PAMPs and DAMPs) can induce or inhibit autophagy in specific contexts. In addition, auto phagy can feedback on the process of PAMP and DAMP recognition to suppress an overexuberant response. This creates a set of feedback loops between autophagy and immune signalling pathways that mediate host defence while limiting tissue damage.\n\nNODlike receptors (NLRs) are cytosolic sensors of PAMPs and DAMPs. Many NLRs are inflammasome subunits that mediate interleukin1\u03b2 (IL1\u03b2) and IL18 production and pyroptosis. The NLRP3 inflammasome, for instance, is activated by diverse stimuli that disrupt mitochondrial integrity, including ATP, bacterial toxins and uric acid crystals. Mitophagy, which is a selective form of autophagy that removes damaged mitochondria, inhibits IL1\u03b2 and IL18 production in response to these stimuli by preventing the accumulation of mitochondriaderived DAMPs, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) [28] [29] [30] (FIG. 1) . Autophagy also removes or prevents leakage of bacterial prod ucts from Shigella-or Salmonellacontaining vacuoles into the cytoplasm, thereby limiting the detection of microbial factors in the cytosol by the caspase 11 inflammasome 31,32 . This model is consistent with a role for autophagy in repairing damaged pathogen containing vacuoles 33 and with the observation that autophagy prevents pyroptosis in the presence of inva sive bacteria 32, 34, 35 . In addition to these examples, in which autophagy limits the availability in the cytosol of inflammasome activators (such as ROS, mtDNA and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)), one study has shown that SQSTM1 can target the inflammasome subunit ASC for incorporation into an autophagosome, leading to its inactivation 36 . These examples illustrate the crucial role of autophagy in suppressing inflammation through the removal of PAMPs, DAMPs and inflammatory sig nalling intermediates from the cytosol, a theme that will be reinforced throughout this article.\n\nNLRs also have a role in inducing autophagy in response to the presence of PAMPs and DAMPs in the cytosol. The sensing of uric acid and nigericin by NLRP3, or recognition of poly(dA:dT) doublestranded DNA by AIM2, induces autophagy by triggering nucleotide exchange on the small GTPase RALB 36 . Amino acid dep rivation also signals through RALB to induce autophagy by creating a large multiprotein complex with the exocyst complex component EXO84 that links the ULK1 and PI3KC3 complexes 37 . Interestingly, autophagy induc tion downstream of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2\u03b1 (eIF2\u03b1) kinase GCN2, which senses amino acid depletion, dampens inflammasome mediated intestinal damage following chemical injury 38 . Thus, nutrient sens ing pathways may have been repurposed for inducing autophagy during inflammatory stress.\n\nNLR activation by infectious agents generally induces autophagy. During L. pneumophila infection of macro phages, flagellin that leaks from the vacuole into the cytosol is recognized by NLR family, apoptosis inhibi tory protein 5 (NAIP5) and NLRC4, and the forma tion of the inflammasome complex induces autophagy by releasing beclin 1 from an inhibitory interaction with NLRC4 (REF. 35 ). Also, the NLRP6 inflammasome is required for autophagosome formation in the intesti nal epithelium 39 . Together, these examples indicate that activation of inflammasomes is coupled with induction of autophagy, which is most likely to reflect a regulatory feedback loop that allows some inflammasome activa tion essential for defence but prevents irreparable dam age to the host by inhibiting excessive cytokine release and pyroptosis by the inflammasome.\n\nNucleotidebinding oligomerization domain 1 (NOD1) and NOD2, the founding members of the NLR family, also induce autophagy. In the presence of bacterial peptidoglycan derivatives, these molecules signal through the adaptor kinase receptorinteracting protein 2 (RIP2) to induce nuclear factor\u03baB (NF\u03baB) and mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) signal ling. Both NOD1 and NOD2 mediate the recruitment of LC3 to vesicles containing internalized bacteria to initi ate xenophagy (FIG. 1) , but there is disagreement regard ing whether this process involves signalling through RIP2 or direct binding between the NLR and ATG16L1 .\n\nThe induction of autophagy following NOD1 and NOD2 activation can dampen an immune response. Specifically, cytokine production by myeloid cells in the presence of bacteria or bacterial ligands that acti vate NOD2 is increased in the absence of autophagy proteins [46] [47] [48] [49] . NOD2 also recognizes viral RNA, and subsequent RIP2 signalling induces mitophagy through ULK1 phosphorylation. Consequently, NOD2 or RIP2 deficiency increases ROS production by mitochon dria and NLRP3 inflammasome activation, which exacerbates lung inflammation during influenza virus infection 50 . Similarly, NOD2-RIP2 signalling induces autophagy in alveolar macrophages to suppress inflam mation caused by the inflammasome during acute lung injury 51 . Additionally, following internalization of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) derived from the commen sal bac terium Bacteroides fragilis, NOD2 is required for induction of a LAPlike process in dendritic cells (DCs) in the intestine that mediates regulatory T cell (T reg cell) differentiation -a process that prevents an unwanted inflammatory response directed towards the microbiota 52 . Although the mechanistic contribu tion of LAP in this setting remains unclear, this study demonstrates a novel role for non canonical autophagy in suppressing immune responses at barrier sites where microbial encounters are common. Altogether, these studies indicate that a major function of autophagy is to keep the immune system in check by counteracting the proinflammatory functions of NLRs. Autophagy inhibits inflammasome activation by sequestering damaged mitochondria and the NLRP3-binding protein ASC to prevent caspase 1-mediated cleavage of pro-interleukin-1\u03b2 (pro-IL-1\u03b2) and pro-IL-18 into the active forms, as well as to prevent pyroptosis. Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2) in the cytosol recognizes bacterial peptidoglycan and viral RNA from internalized pathogens and subsequently induces autophagy, either by signalling through receptor-interacting protein 2 (RIP2) or by directly recruiting ATG16L1 in a complex with immunity-related GTPase family M protein (IRGM). Incorporation of the bacteria into the autophagosome is achieved by LC3-binding proteins, such as sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1), optineurin (OPTN) and NDP52, which recognize the damaged vacuole or mitochondrion tagged by ubiquitin and galectin 8 (GAL8). In addition to inhibiting pathogen replication, this process reduces leakage of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into the cytosol to prevent activation of the caspase 11 inflammasome. Following LPS-mediated activation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), myeloid differentiation primary-response protein 88 (MYD88) and TIR-domain-containing adaptor protein inducing IFN\u03b2 (TRIF) signal through TNFR-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and TRAF3 to facilitate autophagy by inducing the K63-linked ubiquitylation and release of beclin 1 from inhibition, through the phosphorylation and activation of OPTN through TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) ubiquitylation, and by inducing nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) signalling and transcription of SQSTM1 and the autophagosome maturation protein DNA damage-regulated autophagy modulator protein 1 (DRAM1). Recognition of internalized fungal glycans and immune complexes by TLR2 and the Fc\u03b3 receptor (Fc\u03b3R) triggers LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP). As the phagosome acidifies, the fungal pathogen is degraded and activates TLR9 to induce signals through interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) and type I interferon (IFN) transcription. PI3KC3, phosphoinositide 3-kinase catalytic subunit type III.\n\nToll-like receptors. Tolllike receptors (TLRs) sense PAMPs at the cell surface or in the lumen of vesicles and signal through the adaptor proteins myeloid differen tiation primaryresponse protein 88 (MYD88) and/or TIRdomaincontaining adaptor protein inducing IFN\u03b2 (TRIF) to activate TNFRassociated factor 6 (TRAF6), which catalyses lysine 63 (K63) ubiquitylation of several signalling intermediates upstream of NF\u03baB and MAPK to induce inflammatory gene expression. Both MYD88 and TRIF signalling promote autophagosome formation (FIG. 1) , perhaps explaining why a broad range of TLR lig ands can induce autophagy 53, 54 . On LPS exposure, TLR4 promotes the assembly of the PI3KC3 complex through TRAF6mediated K63 ubiquitylation of beclin 1 to free it from an inhibitory interaction with B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) 55 . Signalling through MYD88 and NF\u03baB fur ther increases autophagosome maturation by inducing the expression of DNA damageregulated autophagy modulator protein 1 (DRAM1), a lysosomal transmem brane protein involved in lysosomal acidification 56 . The ability to target specific substrates to the autophagosome is facilitated by the transcriptional induction of SQSTM1 downstream of TLR4 (REF. 57 ). In addition, LPS and NF\u03baBinduced SQSTM1 recognizes ubiquitintagged mitochondria to promote mitophagymediated suppres sion of the NLRP3 inflammasome 30 (FIG. 1) . Thus, the induction of SQSTM1 explains why NF\u03baB signalling is sometimes counterintuitively antiinflammatory. TLR4-TRIF activation by Gramnegative bacteria can also induce TRAF3mediated K63 ubiquitylation of TANKbinding kinase 1 (TBK1), which phosphory lates optineurin to increase its binding affinity for LC3, thereby promoting xenophagy by crosslinking LC3 and bacteria bound by OPTN 58 . These studies indicate that pathogen sensing by TLRs triggers multiple signalling events that converge on autophagy.\n\nImportantly, TLRmediated induction of autophagy has been validated in vivo. Rift Valley fever virus triggers autophagy downstream of TLR7 signalling to restrict viral replication in Drosophila melanogaster 59 . In mice, MYD88dependent induction of autophagy in the intes tinal epithelium prevents dissemination of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium 60 . Unlike NLRs in the cytosol, the ability to detect the presence of PAMPs before a breach in the cell membrane may explain why a role for TLRinduced autophagy can be detected as early as 24 hours postinfection in this setting.\n\nCommunication between autophagy and TLRs is bidirectional. Autophagy delivers viral RNA to the endosome for TLR7 recognition in plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) 61 . In at least some examples, gene expression downstream of TLRs requires the recruitment of LC3 to phagosomes through LAP (FIG. 1) . When antibodybound DNA complexes are internalized by pDCs and bind Fc\u03b3 receptor (Fc\u03b3R), LAP mediates the maturation of the phagosome to a vesicle that supports type I IFN produc tion downstream of TLR9 (REF. 62 ). The acidification of phago somes containing TLR2 ligands in macrophages also occurs through LAP 63 . Furthermore, melanin in the cell wall of the fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumi gatus inhibits ROS production by the NADPH oxidase, which, together with TLR recognition of fungal surface mol ecules, is a necessary step in the recruitment of autophagy proteins to the phagosome. When melanin is removed during A. fumigatus germination, LAP can mediate the degradation of the pathogen by promoting phagosome maturation 8, 64 . These findings demonstrate how auto phagy and LAP support vesicle trafficking events that are crucial for TLRmediated cytokine production and pathogen degradation.\n\nIn contrast to the above examples, there are situations in which autophagy proteins and TLRs have an antago nistic relationship. SQSTM1 has a dual function as both an adaptor molecule for autophagy and a scaffolding protein that binds TRAF6 to mediate NF\u03baB signalling downstream of TLRs 65 . In keratinocytes, SQSTM1 is targeted for autophagic degradation through its binding to LC3, thereby disrupting TLR4 and TLR2 signalling 66 . Furthermore, MYD88 signalling upon TLR2 recogni tion of Mycobacterium tuberculosis induces a microRNA that inhibits autophagy by targeting UVRAG, a subunit of the PI3K3C complex, resulting in increased bacterial survival 67 . However, unlike the extensive antago nistic rela tionship observed between NLRs and autophagy, exam ples of autophagy and TLR antagonism have thus far been rare and may apply to specific cell types or pathogens. Antiviral signalling. Whereas autophagy proteins typically promote TLR signalling in the presence of vesicle bound nucleic acid, autophagy proteins mediate mitophagy to inhibit signalling downstream of cytosolic sensors of viral nucleic acid. The retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIGI)like receptors (RLRs) RIGI and melan oma differentiation associated gene 5 (MDA5) sense doublestranded RNA in the cytosol and signal through mitochondrial antiviral signalling protein (MAVS), which oligomerizes on the mitochondrial outer membrane to induce type I IFN expression by activating the transcrip tion factors IRF3 and IRF7. Mitophagy suppresses type I IFN production by removing the platform for RLR sig nalling and causes degradation of signalling inter mediates such as MAVS [68] [69] [70] (FIG. 2a) . ROS produced by accumulat ing mitochondria also contributes to excess type I IFN production when mitophagy is inhibited 71 . When MAVS signalling is triggered by a viral infection, the ATG16L1 complex is recruited to mitochondria by NLR family member X1 (NLRX1), elongation factor Tu, mitochon dria (TUFM) and cytochrome c oxidase subunit 5B (COX5B) 68, 70 (FIG. 2a) . For this reason, cells deficient in autophagy proteins, NLRX1 or COX5B display enhanced type I IFN production and are better able to restrict the replication of a variety of viruses [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] . Presumably, mito phagy is coupled to the detection of cytosolic RNA to prevent sustained, pathological type I IFN production, but this model has not been formally demonstrated.\n\nAutophagy proteins are also involved in sensing cytosolic DNA, which is associated with viral infec tion, intracellular bacteria and autoimmunity. Cyclic dinucleo tides generated by cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) in the presence of doublestranded DNA acti vate the transmembrane protein stimulator of interferon genes (STING) to induce type I IFN expression. STING colocalizes with autophagy proteins including LC3, and loss of ATG9L1 leads to aberrant STING trafficking and activation 73 . However, STING function was unaffected by the deletion of the canonical autophagy protein ATG7 (REF. 73 ), implicating a noncanonical autophagy pathway in mediating STING localization. In another departure from canonical autophagy, ULK1 functions downstream of the PI3KC component VPS34 in this setting. Similar to autophagy induction during glucose starvation, cyclic dinucleotides induce the activation of AMPactivated protein kinase (AMPK), which leads to phosphoryla tion and activation of ULK1 (REF. 74 ). Instead of induc ing autophagy, ULK1 phosphorylates STING to inhibit IRF3 and aberrant type I IFN hyperexpression 74 (FIG. 2b) .\n\nOther examples in which autophagy proteins inter sect with cytosolic DNA sensing are more consistent with their functions in canonical autophagy. During herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1) infection, beclin 1 binds and inhibits cGAS, which frees beclin 1 from inhib ition by rubicon (run domain beclin 1interacting and cysteinerich domaincontaining protein) to enhance PI3KC3 activity and autophagymediated degradation of viral DNA, thus reducing both the amount of cytosolic DNA and the levels of type I IFN production 75 (FIG. 2b) . Autophagy also prevents pathological STING activation by targeting damaged DNA that leaks from the nucleus to the lysosome where it is degraded by DNase2A 76 .\n\nSpontaneous type I IFN signalling occurs upon autophagy inhibition in intestinal tissue and tumour cells 24, 77, 78 , indicating that autophagy in some organs or cell types is constitutively suppressing cytokine release. A type I IFN signature in the absence of an infectious trigger could reflect an inappropriate immune response to host nucleic acid, the microbiota and/or endogenous retroviruses. Given our growing appreciation of the contribution of type I IFN to cancer and autoimmunity, Nature Reviews | Immunology The recruitment of the ATG16L1 complex by NLR family member X1 (NLRX1) and elongation factor Tu, mitochondria (TUFM; or COX5B, not shown) to the mitochondrion promotes mitophagy thereby inhibiting type I IFN production by removing the MAVS signalling platform and inhibiting ROS production. b | Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) converts cytosolic DNA (from viruses, bacteria or the host) to cyclic dinucleotides for recognition by stimulator of interferon genes (STING) and subsequent type I IFN production. cGAS activates ULK1, which mediates an inhibitory phosphorylation of STING. Also, the binding of beclin 1 to cGAS allows beclin 1 to induce autophagy through the PI3KC3 complex to remove the cytosolic DNA and simultaneously inhibits cGAS-dependent type I IFN production. c | IFN\u03b3 induces autophagy through Janus kinase 1 (JAK1), JAK2 and p38. This pathway is reinforced by mitophogy, which reduces the levels of mitochondrial ROS that activate SHP2, an inhibitor of IFN\u03b3 signalling. By contrast, interleukin-10 (IL-10) can inhibit autophagy by promoting binding between signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and protein kinase R (PKR), which inhibits the activation of the autophagy inducer eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2\u03b1 (eIF2\u03b1). d | In addition to suppressing IL-1\u03b2 production by inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome, autophagy mediates the secretion of IL-1\u03b2. Extracellular IL-1\u03b2 signals through IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) and myeloid differentiation primary-response protein 88 (MYD88) to induce autophagy, and autophagosome maturation and degradation of engulfed material including intracellular bacteria is dependent on TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and suppresses the NLRP3 inflammasome. e | High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), both within the cell and upon release by dying cells, promotes autophagy. Binding of extracellular HMGB1 by receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) induces autophagy by inhibiting mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). Nuclear HMGB1 promotes mitophagy by inducing the expression of ROS, it induces autophagy by protecting beclin 1 from an inhibitory interaction with B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) or cleavage by calpain (not shown). HSPB1, heat shock protein B1.\n\nthis autophagymediated control of cytokine expression under steadystate conditions is likely to be relevant to situations beyond infectious disease. [79] [80] [81] , which is consistent with a role of autophagy in support ing cellular immunity. IFN\u03b3 induces autophagy through the Janus kinase 1 (JAK1)-JAK2 and p38 MAPK path way, independently of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) 82 . In turn, autophagy promotes IFN\u03b3 signalling by limiting ROS production, which, if left to accumulate, would activate the JAK-STAT inhibitory phosphatase SHP2 (REF. 83) (FIG. 2c) .\n\nIn addition to conventional autophagy, IFN\u03b3 induces a LAPlike process in hepatocytes infected by the malar ial parasite Plasmodium vivax. The deposition of LC3 onto the parasitophorous vacuole leads to the recruit ment of lysosomes and killing of the parasite 84 . As men tioned earlier, IFN\u03b3 suppresses T. gondii and norovirus replication through an incompletely understood type of noncanonical autophagy [9] [10] [11] . Therefore, IFN\u03b3 induces canonical and noncanonical autophagy to inhibit intracellular pathogen replication.\n\nBy contrast, cytokines that signal through other STAT molecules can inhibit autophagy. Binding of protein kinase R (PKR) by STAT3 prevents PKRmediated phosphory lation of eIF2\u03b1, a stressresponsive regulator of transla tion that promotes autophagy 85 (FIG. 2c) . Therefore, any cytokine that activates STAT3 can theo retically interfere with autophagy, as seen with the regulatory cytokine IL10 (REF. 86 ). STAT6 signalling downstream of the T H 2 cytokines IL4 and IL13 also inhibits the induction of autophagy by IFN\u03b3 in macro phages 80 . However, DCs that differentiate in the presence of IL4 display increased expression of RUFY4, a positive regulator of autophago some growth and fusion with lysosomes 87 , suggesting that IL4 can also enhance autophagy. The amount of time the cell is exposed to the T H 2 cytokines, and the pres ence of other cytokines such as IFN\u03b3 and granulocytemacrophage colonystimulating factor (GMCSF), may explain these contradictory effects of T H 2 cytokines on autophagy. These studies establish a link between auto phagy and T H 2 and regu latory cytokines, but the impact of this link on host defence requires further investigation.\n\nAs mentioned above, autophagy inhibits IL1\u03b2 pro duction by repressing inflammasome activation but, conversely, can facilitate the secretion of this cytokine 88 . IL1\u03b2 does not undergo conventional secretion owing to the absence of a signal peptide, but it can pass through a permeabilized plasma membrane 89 . Alternatively, when membrane integrity is intact, IL1\u03b2 can be incorporated into the space between the inner and outer membrane of the autophagosome and is released from the cell fol lowing autophagosome fusion with the plasma membrane or multivesicular body 90 (FIG. 2d) . However, IL1\u03b2 is ulti mately released from autophagydeficient cells, probably through the permeabilized membrane that accompanies increased inflammasome activity and pyroptosis. Once secreted, IL1\u03b2 continues to influence autophagy in the target cell through TBK1, which interacts with RAB8B, to promote autophagosome maturation 91 (FIG. 2d) . In addition, IL1\u03b2 (as well as IL1\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3) induces ubiquitylation of beclin 1, suggesting that it can activate autophagy through a mechanism similar to that of LPS activation (FIG. 1) .\n\nAlthough less appreciated, autophagy inhibits the production of other cytokines. For instance, secre tion of other IL1 family members, specifically IL1\u03b1 and migration inhibitory factor (MIF), is increased in autophagydeficient macrophages as a downstream consequence of mitochondrial ROS accumulation 92 (FIG. 3) . Similarly, IL1\u03b2 produced following autophagy inhibition in DCs acts in an autocrine manner to mediate IL23 production, leading to IL17 secretion by \u03b3\u03b4 T cells 94 . It is less clear whether T H 1 cells and other branches of adaptive immunity are enhanced by auto phagy deficiency in macrophages and DCs. One reason may be that type I IFN, which is over produced upon autophagy inhibition, inhibits IFN\u03b3 activity 96 . An inflam matory milieu could also cause T cell exhaustion. As dis cussed later, the role of autophagy in antigen presentation is another variable that requires consideration.\n\nCell death can lead to extracellular release of DAMPs that are usually confined within the cell, such as nucleic acids, ATP, high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and IL1\u03b2. Purinergic receptors and transporters that recognize exogenous ATP trigger autophagy through AMPKmediated mTOR inhibition and dephosphory lation of AKT [97] [98] [99] [100] . Before cell death, autophagy promotes the secretion of ATP by mediating the migration of ATP containing lysosomes towards the plasma membrane 101 . Owing to the importance of ATP as a chemotactic signal, loss of autophagy in tumour cells diminishes the ability of chemotherapeutic agents to trigger a robust antitumor immune response 102 . Thus, autophagy is induced by ATP and also promotes the secretion of ATP.\n\nLike IL1\u03b2, autophagy facilitates the release of HMGB1, a chromatinassociated nuclear protein, from stressed or dying tumour cells 103 . Extracellular HMGB1 is recognized by receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), resulting in decreased mTOR activ ity and increased autophagy 104 . Nuclear HMGB1 regu lates the expression of heat shock protein B1 (HSPB1), a chaperone protein that promotes mitophagy 105 . Also, HMGB1 translocates to the cytosol in the pres ence of ROS, where it induces autophagy by releasing beclin 1 from inhibition by BCL2 (REF. 103 ). Endogenous HMGB1 can also promote autophagy by protecting bec lin 1 and ATG5 from calpainmediated cleavage 106 (FIG. 2e) . Thus, when HMGB1 is removed from macro phages or intestinal epithelial cells, the balance shifts from auto phagy to apoptosis and favours exaggerated cytokine production to increase inflammation 106, 107 .\n\nTo summarize, extensive crosstalk has been observed between autophagy and immune signalling cascades downstream of the array of receptors that recognize PAMPs, DAMPs and cytokines. The finding that auto phagy is sometimes necessary for type I IFN produc tion (for example, by functioning together with TLRs in pDCs) but can also dampen type I IFN signalling (for example, through mitophagy) reinforces the fact that the relationship between autophagy and a given immune pathway is context dependent. However, one recurring observation is that pathways that induce autophagy are often inhibited by autophagy to prevent sustained activa tion. This negativefeedback loop is most obvious in the presence of inflammasome substrates and viral nucleic acids in the cytosol, where autophagy limits the levels of cytokines produced upon sensing of these molecules.\n\nThis function of autophagy is not mutually exclusive from its antimicrobial functions (as in the case of xeno phagy); removing the infectious threat and removing the PAMPs that triggers the inflammatory response are both ways to restore homeostasis.\n\nAutophagy in immunity and disease Autophagy and adaptive immunity. A role for auto phagy can be seen in virtually all the cell types that participate in adaptive immunity: lymphocytes, antigen presenting cells (APCs), dying cells and myeloid cells that contribute to the inflammatory milieu. Autophagy, most likely through the removal of damaged mitochon dria, is necessary for the survival and proliferation of CD4 + , CD8 + and NK T cells [108] [109] [110] [111] [112] [113] [114] , memory responses of CD8 + T cells and activated NK cell maintenance 115 Autophagy activity in T cells, antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and dying cells affects T cell immunity. Autophagy in APCs such as dendritic cells delivers intracellular and extracellular antigens to endolysosomal vesicles where they are loaded onto MHC class II molecules for presentation to CD4 + T cells. Peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs) in autophagosomes generate citrullinated peptides, thereby affecting the repertoire of antigens being presented. Extracellular antigens can also be delivered to the endosolysosome by LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP). Autophagy-mediated release of ATP by dying cells, such as those infected by viruses, leads to engulfment by the APC. Internalized antigens from the dying cell can then be cross-presented on MHC class I molecules (in the endolysosome) to stimulate CD8 + T cells, a process mediated by autophagy or, potentially, LAP downstream of GCN2 activation. By inhibiting the release of key inflammatory cytokines, autophagy decreases the differentiation of CD4 + T cells into T helper 17 (T H 17) cells. Alternatively, exogenous antigens may be exported into the cytosol and delivered to MHC class I molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). For instance, the removal of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-producing mitochondria inhibits calpain-mediated processing of interleukin-1\u03b1 (IL-1\u03b1). Naive CD4 + T cells require autophagy for survival and proliferation (and cytokine production once activated). The establishment of memory by CD8 + T cells is also dependent on autophagy.\n\nB1a B cells B1 B cells are a group of self-renewing, autoreactive B cells with a limited B cell receptor repertoire. These cells are mainly found in the peritoneal cavity and the pleural cavity. B1 cells are subdivided into the B1a (CD5 + ) and B1b (CD5 \u2212 ) subsets.\n\nA self-peptide that incorporates the amino acid citrulline. These peptides are generated post-translationally by peptidylarginine deiminases. The citrulline moiety is the essential part of the antigenic determinant towards which characteristic autoantibodies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis are generated.\n\nThe initiation of a CD8 + T cell response to an antigen that is not present within antigen-presenting cells (APCs). This exogenous antigen must be taken up by APCs and then re-routed to the MHC class I pathway of antigen presentation.\n\nTogether with ulcerative colitis, Crohn disease is one of the two main forms of chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It most commonly affects the lower portion of the small intestine, resulting in symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhoea, fever and weight loss. Analysis of the strong genetic predisposition led to the identification of mutations in the NOD2 gene that are particularly strongly associated with ileal disease, but not with ulcerative colitis.\n\n(Endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway). A conserved stress response pathway that senses the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum.\n\nHaematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). A procedure in which HSCs from bone marrow or blood are transplanted to treat leukaemia and other disorders.\n\nGraft-versus-host disease (GVHD). A common complication of HSCT in which allogeneic T cells derived from a non-identical donor attack healthy tissue in the recipient.\n\nIn addition, autophagy activity generates the ATP neces sary for IL2 and IFN\u03b3 production by effector CD4 + T cells 120 . Autophagy may have analogous functions in maintaining organelle and metabolic homeostasis in the B cell lineage because Atg5 deletion leads to an absence of B1a B cells and a defect in antibody production by plasma cells [121] [122] [123] .\n\nThe induction of autophagy in naive CD4 + T cells following TCR stimulation is dependent on mTOR inhibition downstream of the ubiquitinediting enzyme A20 (also known as TNFAIP3) 114 . TCR engagement also induces autophagymediated degradation of BCL10 upstream of NF\u03baB, thus preventing hyperactivation of effector T cells 124 . Autophagy also has an important role in maintaining T reg cells, as inhibition of autophagy causes apoptosis of T reg cells and lineage instability, due to aber rant metabolism, which leads to unrestrained T H 2 cell responses and inflammation at intestinal barrier sites 125, 126 . As expected, the role of autophagy in supporting these various lymphocyte lineages is necessary for optimal immune responses to viruses, parasites, selfantigens and tumours 115, 122, 125, 126 .\n\nOn the APC side, autophagy affects the repertoire of peptides presented on MHC class II molecules 127 , includ ing by thymic epithelial cells that mediate the selection of developing thymocytes 128 . The presentation of specific antigens has been shown to depend on autophagy: for example, autophagosomes transport peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs; which convert arginine to citrulline) to antigencontaining endolysosome, leading to the gen eration of citrullinated self-peptides implicated in rheuma toid arthritis 129 (FIG. 3) . Autophagy in virally infected cells generates antigens for presentation to CD4 + T cells by delivering cytosolic proteins to the endolysosome for antigen processing, such as the Epstein-Barr virus pro tein EBNA1 (REF. 130) (FIG. 3) . In some cases, antigens are generated by autophagy from the uptake of ubiquity lated protein aggregates and pathogencontaining vac uoles that are recognized by SQSTM1, which become substrates for either MHC class I or MHC class II pres entation 131, 132 . Autophagy can be augmented to enhance antigen presentation through various signals, such as IFN\u03b3 and NOD2 activation 41, 131, 132 . Autophagy or LAP has also been shown to be crucial for the processing of exogenous antigens in DCs by mediating the fusion of phagosomes containing TLR ligands or apoptotic corpses with lysosomes [133] [134] [135] (FIG. 3) . This process is neces sary for the MHC class II presentation that drives the antiviral T H 1 cell response during HSV2 infection 136 . Therefore, it is possible that the reason pathogens encode proteins that inhibit autophagy is to avoid recognition by CD4 + T cells. For instance, the HSV1 protein ICP34.5 binds beclin 1 to inhibit autophagymediated MHC class II antigen presentation in DCs 137 .\n\nDCs can also present exogenous antigens on MHC class I molecules through cross-presentation. Vaccination of humans with the yellow fever virus vaccine YF17D induces autophagy in DCs through induction of the amino acid starvation sensor GCN2. Inhibition of either autophagy proteins or GCN2 impairs the ability of DCs to mediate proliferation of CD8 + T cells when cocultured with infected cells 138 (FIG. 3) . This study provides a clin ically relevant example of autophagy dependent MHC class I crosspresentation. However, as with certain exam ples of antigen presentation by MHC class II molecules, the role for autophagy proteins revealed by this study may reflect LAP rather than autophagy. Now that new tools are available, future studies will be able to distin guish the role of canonical versus noncanonical forms of autophagy in antigen presentation.\n\nGenetic variants that occur near or within auto phagy genes are implicated in several inflammatory dis orders (TABLE 1). One of the first indicators that autophagy dysfunction contributes to inflammatory disease was provided by the genetic link between Crohn disease and a common polymorphism in ATG16L1 (REF. 139 ). The disease polymorphism results in a threonine to alanine coding change (T300A) that destabilizes the ATG16L1 protein product by introducing a caspase 3 cleavage site 48, 49 . The function of autophagy in inhibiting cytokine production is consistent with the idea that Crohn disease stems from an exaggerated immune response directed towards the gut microbiota. Additionally, inhibiting auto phagy within the intestinal epithelium causes defects in antimicrobial granule formation by Paneth cells and reduced mucus secretion by goblet cells 19, [140] [141] [142] . Together with xenophagy, autophagy helps maintain these secre tory cell lineages and prevents breaches of the epithelial barrier by both pathogenic and commensal bacteria 60, 143 . The importance of these epithelial cellspecific func tions of autophagy is supported by the observation that knockin mice harbouring the ATG16L1 T300A disease variant are susceptible to enteric bacterial infections and display defects in Paneth cells and goblet cells 48, 49 . Also, the crosstalk between the ER stress pathway and auto phagy in Paneth cells was shown to have a central role in preventing intestinal inflammation 142 , directly implicat ing the organ elle homeostasis function of autophagy in the function of this secretory cell type.\n\nThe same ATG16L1 T300A polymorphism increases the risk of death following allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) 144 . Autophagy was found to prevent lethal graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in a preclinical animal model of HSCT by suppress ing DC hyperactivity. These autophagydeficient DCs displayed increased expression of genes implicated in endolysosomal trafficking, including those that affect NF\u03baB and MAPK signalling 144 . Allogeneic T cell acti vation has fewer constraints on the antigen being pre sented than syngeneic T cell activation, which many explain why autophagy suppresses rather than promotes the ability of DCs to stimulate T cells in this situ ation. Given that GVHD frequently affects the gut, it would be interesting to determine whether autophagy in the intestinal epithelium also has a role in preventing disease following HSCT.\n\nPolymorphisms associ ated with increased ATG5 expression are linked to asthma and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) 145, 146 . Although\n\nAn inherited disorder caused by defective oxidase activity in the respiratory burst of phagocytes. It results from mutations in any of four genes that are necessary to generate the superoxide radicals required for neutrophil antimicrobial function. Affected patients suffer from increased susceptibility to recurrent infections.\n\nit remains possible that these polymorphisms act through neighbouring genes and not through ATG5, autophagy contributes to biological processes that are relevant to these disorders including regulation of the cytokine milieu and antigen presentation. In airway epithelial cells, autophagy mediates goblet cell differenti ation and mucus secretion in response to IL13 (REF. 147 ), sug gesting that enhanced autophagy contributes to the pathological overproduction of mucus observed in asthmatic individuals.\n\nMarkers of increased autophagy have been observed in B cells and T cells from patients with SLE 148, 149 , which could reflect their genetic predisposition, or an attempt to further restrict cytokine production. The multi organ inflammation observed in SLE is associated with immune complexes consisting of antibodies bound to nucleic acid and histones, which induce aberrant type I IFN production following their recognition by TLR7 and TLR9. LAP, which is dependent on ATG5, mediates TLR9 activation and type I IFN production by promoting the maturation of the endosome containing these immune complexes after uptake by pDCs 62 . Also, ATG5 in B cells is necessary for TLR7dependent generation of autoanti bodies and for the induction of SLE pathologies, hinting at a role for autophagy proteins early in disease progression 150 .\n\nBy contrast, ATG5 and other autophagy proteins pre vent the production of selfreactive antibodies in mye loid cells. In LAPdeficient mice, dying cells taken up by macro phages are not properly degraded, leading to a general increase in serological markers of inflammation and signs of SLE with age 151 . Of note, rubicondeficient mice (one of the LAPdeficient mouse strains used in this study) are known to display increased autophagy 8 . One interpretation of this result is that loss of LAP in mye loid cells has a greater impact on the development of SLE (in aged mice) than a potential increase in autophagy, which in B cells is predicted to promote auto antibody generation 150 . Studies that examine the effect of increased autophagy specifically in B cells are warranted.\n\nInflammatory disease accompanied by autophagy dysfunction. The list of immunological diseases accom panied by autophagy dysfunction extends beyond those caused by mutations in autophagy genes. Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) occurs in individuals har bouring lossoffunction mutations in subunits of the NADPH oxidase, which is necessary for generating ROS and recruiting LC3 to the phagosome 152 . Monocytes from patients with CGD are defective in LAPmediated control of A. fumigatus 64 . Similarly, APCs deficient in NAPDH oxidase activity display reduced MHC class I and MHC class II presentation of fungal antigens 133, 153 . Cells from patients with CGD also display defects in autophagy mediated suppression of IL1\u03b2 in the presence of the spiro chete Borrelia burgdorferi 47 . This failure of autophagy mediated control of IL1\u03b2 production contributes to T H 17 celldriven colitis in these patients, which can be treated with an antibody against IL1R (anakinra) 154 .\n\nA defect in pathogen handling through autophagy may also explain why individuals with the lysosomal storage disorder Niemen-Pick disease type C 1 (NPC1) sometimes develop granulomatous inflammation in the intestine that resembles Crohn disease. A recent study has shown that macrophages derived from patients with NPC1 are unable to perform NOD2mediated xeno phagy 155 . In another example, a mutation in cystic fibro sis transmembrane conductance receptor (CFTR) leads to sequestration of the PI3KC3 complex into protein aggre gates and downregulation of autophagy 156 . This block in autophagy potentially contributes to chronic lung inflam mation and recurring pulmonary infections characteristic of cystic fibrosis. Indeed, the CFTR mutation increases the susceptibility of macrophages to Burkholderia cenocepacia infection and exacerbates IL1\u03b2 production 157 . Autophagy is further inhibited following treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis with the antibiotic azithromycin and is associ ated with increased infection by nontuberculous mycobacteria 158 . Thus, restoration of autophagy may ameliorate many chronic inflammatory disorders.\n\nAutophagy and related processes regulate intracellular trafficking of pathogens, the production of inflammatory mediators and the viability of cells that coordinate immu nity. Through these functions, the autophagy machinery controls complex multicellular immune responses at the whole organism level. The literature highlighted in this article reinforces three themes related to how these functions of autophagy are integrated into inflammatory signalling cascades to ensure an appropriate response to environmental threats and a return to homeostasis: one, pathways that induce autophagy are subject to regulation by autophagy; two, autophagy can increase or decrease different parts of the same inflammatory signalling cascade in a contextdependent manner; and three, non canonical autophagy is pervasive. Although these principles apply to the role of autophagy across numerous physiological functions, they are perhaps most obvious in the recent literature examining the function of autophagy proteins in host defence and inflammatory disease.\n\nThese three themes have implications for the clinical application of autophagy inducers and inhibitors. Short term induction of autophagy is effective in reducing the burden of intracellular pathogens 16 , and it can simulta neously enhance TLRmediated cytokine production and antigen presentation by DCs to improve adaptive immunity 138 . Treating chronic infections is potentially more challenging and will require consideration of the bidirectional communication between autophagy and inflammation. It is important to bear in mind that the measure of an effective immune response is not how vigorous it is, but how efficiently the threat is neutralized without damaging the host. The successful application of therapeutic intervention may require knowledge of when the role of autophagy in reducing inflammation com plements, rather than inhibits, the role of autophagy in reducing pathogen burden.\n\nTreating complex inflammatory disorders by modulat ing autophagy has similar challenges. Before considering this strategy, it is important to identify the physiological situations in which the net effect of autophagy on the level of IL1\u03b2, type I IFN and other cytokines is positive ver sus negative. Also, the cell types and organs most affected by autophagy activity should be determined. Although the discovery of noncanonical forms of autophagy has increased the complexity of the field, we may be able to exploit the subtle differences in the function of different components of the autophagy machinery. Indeed, deleting some autophagy genes in macrophages leads to a more pronounced inflammatory outcome than deleting other autophagy genes 25, 151 , perhaps indicating that inhibition of certain parts of the pathway can be compensated by other membranetrafficking processes, and/or that some autophagy proteins have partially redundant functions. It may be possible to target different nodes of the autophagy pathway without broadly affecting all the downstream immune functions of autophagy proteins.\n\nFinally, defects in autophagy coincide with ageing, metabolic disease, cancer, myopathies and neurodegen erative disorders. Indeed, transgenic mice engineered to overexpress Atg5 display increased lifespan and improve ments in glucose sensitivity and motor function 159 . If humans are to receive autophagybased treatments for these conditions associated with ageing, it will be neces sary to understand the effect of altered autophagy on inflammation, which universally accompanies maladies."}
