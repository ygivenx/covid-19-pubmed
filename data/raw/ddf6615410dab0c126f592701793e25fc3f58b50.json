{"title": "Autoproteolytic activation of ThnT results in structural reorganization necessary for substrate binding and catalysis", "body": "Autoproteolytic proteins pose unique challenges to understanding structure-function relationships because their cleavage is an intrinsic consequence of folding. This post-translational modification is involved in the regulation of protein folding 1 , cell signaling 2 , nucleoporin biogenesis 3 , apoptosis 4 , and the function of many enzymes [5] [6] [7] . These studies have established that self-cleavage proceeds through an N-O(S) acyl shift mechanism: an active-site nucleophile (Thr, Ser or Cys) attacks into its N-terminal peptide bond generating a (thia)oxazolidine intermediate (Fig. 1a) . 8 This transient species collapses to a (thio)ester, which is subsequently hydrolyzed to yield two subunits bearing new N-and C-termini. The N-terminal nucleophile (Ntn) generated by autoproteolysis is used by enzymes, such as the Thr-utilizing proteasome \u03b2-subunit (P\u03b2S), 9 in a catalytic diad (or triad) for catalysis. It was originally believed that all Ntn-utilizing enzymes belonged to the same superfamily (dubbed the Ntn-superfamily). 5, 10 However, subsequent research showed a second group of enzymes exists (the D/O-superfamily), which is related to the Ntn-superfamily through convergent evolution. 11 Together, these enzymes perform a diverse array of hydrolysis and acyl transfer reactions.\n\nWe recently reported use of the pantetheinyl hydrolase ThnT (Fig. 1b) , a D/O enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of the potent \u03b2-lactam antibiotic thienamycin, 12 as a model system with which to study autoproteolysis. 13 Our analysis showed a local conformational rearrangement is necessary for autoactivation and indicated that the majority of reported uncleaved structures from the Ntn-superfamily do not, in fact, represent a cleavage competent state. Consequently, a comparison between the functional active site before and after autoactivation is possible for only two systems, glycosylasparaginase 14, 15 (GA) and P\u03b2S. 9, 16 This lack of mechanistically relevant structural information constitutes a fundamental gap in our understanding of how a single protein sequence is optimized to facilitate both autoproteolysis and enzymatic catalysis in its mature form. Because cephalosporin acylase (CA) and penicillin acylase (PA), both members of the Ntnsuperfamily, are currently the subject of directed evolution experiments to improve the industrial production of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, 17, 18 further insights may provide valuable lessons in the development of enzymes with improved activity. Addressing this problem will rely on the ability to compare and contrast structural changes upon autoactivation for both the Ntn and D/O superfamilies. To this end, we sought to extend our analysis of ThnT by determining the mature structure of the enzyme and elucidating the features necessary for substrate binding and catalysis.\n\nA six-hour room temperature incubation of ThnT purified from heterologous expression afforded autoproteolytically activated enzyme suitable for X-ray crystallography. Wild-type ThnT crystallized under similar conditions and in the same space group as the mutationally inactive precursor ThnT T282C. Diffraction to high resolution and phasing by molecular replacement yielded the 1.8-\u00c5 crystal structure of wild-type ThnT. For clarity, all residues of ThnT referenced hereafter will be numbered according to their position in the precursor protein. Autoproteolysis generates two subunits, \u03b1 and \u03b2, comprised of residues 1-281 and 282-399, respectively. Like most structurally characterized Ntn enzymes, the subunits of ThnT remain intimately intertwined after activation with global features comparable to their uncleaved forms (Fig. 2a) . 11, 19 The N-6His tag and the first 23 residues of the \u03b1 subunit were not observed, as was the case for the T282C structure. A short linker sequence leading into the scissile bond of the pro-enzyme, residues 274-281, showed few tertiary interactions and modeled with very high average B-factors (41.4 \u00c5 2 ). 13 These disordered residues comprise the C-terminus of the \u03b1 subunit and, as we anticipated, they are not observed in the structure of mature ThnT. Interestingly, comparable disorder in precursor proteins and nascent C-termini has been found in many autoproteolytic systems. 14, 20 This observation is readily explained as a strategy employed to promote dissociation of the C-terminus, which must occur to expose the active site of the mature enzyme.\n\nThe N-terminal residue of the \u03b2 subunit is the characteristic N-terminal threonine residue central to autoprocessing and substrate catalysis (Fig. 2b) . Surprisingly, the peptide \u03c9 angle of Thr282 consistently refined to a strained 167\u00b0. Comparable strain was observed at this position in the pro-enzyme inactive state and we hypothesized this destabilization was used to help drive formation of the reactive conformation. 13 Hence, it appears retention of this unfavorable geometry is a consequence of the selection for an active site that can promote two different chemical reactions. The energetic penalty of straining this bond may be offset by the hydrogen bond between the carbonyl of Thr282 and the amide nitrogen of Asn217, which would be disrupted upon relaxation of the \u03c9 angle. The amide proton of Phe144 and \u03b4NH 2 of Asn217 comprise the oxyanion hole of ThnT for autoactivation 13 . In the major conformer of the precursor structure, a single water molecule occupied the oxyanion hole, taking the place of the reactive carbonyl. A similar placeholder is not observed for mature ThnT; instead a glycerol molecule and additional water molecules are bound in the active site (Fig. 2b ).\n\nIn addition to dissociation of the nascent C-terminus, three structural rearrangements in the vicinity of the active site were identified (Fig 3a) . Notably, the solvent-filled groove that may represent the substrate binding site is not present prior to autoactivation, and is only revealed upon a conformational change in residues Arg74-Thr80, which includes cis-trans isomerization of the Gly77-Pro78 peptide bond (Fig. 3b ). This dramatic structural rearrangement is promoted electrostatically by reorienting the carbonyl of Arg74 away from Asp321 and positioning it 1.4 \u00c5 closer to the side chain of Lys300. The new conformation allows the amide nitrogens of Gly76 and Gly77 to hydrogen bond with the backbone of Leu318 and Asp321, respectively. Additionally, there is a net release of four water molecules, which is entropically favorable. 21 These transitions stabilize the loop relative to the uncleaved form, which is corroborated by a decrease in the average B-factor of the loop from 18.5 \u00c5 2 prior to cleavage to 11.6 \u00c5 2 in the mature enzyme. Together, these data demonstrate that specific structural features of ThnT promote the isomerization of the Arg74-Thr80 loop.\n\nTwo other motifs undergo a structural transition upon autoproteolysis. Residues Leu318-Gly322 were observed in two conformations of one subunit in the T282C structure, but collapse to a single observable state in both subunits of the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 3c) . The role of this apparent conformational flexibility is unclear. However, proximity to the active site and hydrogen bonding interactions with the Arg74-Thr80 loop (described above) suggest its relevance. Residues Asp338-Phe348 were not observed in the structure of the precursor protein, but were modeled in the structure of mature ThnT. A subset of these, Pro337-Asp341, refined with a high average B-factor of 43.9 \u00c5 2 suggesting they retain considerable flexibility after autoactivation. Conversely, Ala342-Phe348 were well resolved, with the side chain of Phe348 extending across the dimer interface and dividing the active site of the adjacent heterodimeric unit into two distinct sections. Because this conformation is not sterically accessible prior to dissociation of the newly formed C-terminus, formation of the observed state must occur relatively late in the maturation of the active site.\n\nThe structure of autoproteolytically activated ThnT shows Thr282 has adopted the grotamer, which positions the \u03b3OH such that it forms a hydrogen bond with the \u03b1-amino group. The Ntn was originally proposed to constitute a \"single-amino-acid catalytic center\", 22 however subsequent rigorous analysis showed that auxiliary residues are critical to catalysis. 23 The \u03b1-amine of ThnT is adjacent to two hydrogen bond acceptors: the carboxylate of Asp321 and the carbonyl of Asn217. These residues correctly orient the nitrogen lone pair to accept a proton from the nucleophile (Fig. 2b) . Interestingly, Gly322 is part of the network of residues that undergo structural rearrangement upon autoactivation and the amide nitrogen shifts 0.8 \u00c5 to form a tight 2.6 \u00c5 hydrogen bond with the nucleophile. The oxyanion hole residues Phe144 and Asn217 maintain their orientation to stabilize the tetrahedral oxyanion intermediates generated during substrate catalysis. Hence, the hydrogen bond interactions between Asn217 and Thr282 described above define the proper active site geometry for activation of both the nucleophile and the electrophile. Furthermore, this network leaves the \u03b3OH of Thr282 with an unsatisfied lone pair directed at the oxyanion hole.\n\nThnT and P\u03b2S have distinct evolutionary lineage, but share autoactivation through si-face attack into the scissile bond and amidohydrolase chemistry in their mature form. Hence, it is now possible to distinguish between system-specific and general features of their active sites. The catalytic activity of P\u03b2S relies on a hydrogen bond network very similar to that shown in Fig. 2b . However, the active site of each protein is formed from different parts of their topologically distinct folds (Fig. 4) , reinforcing their relationship through convergent evolution. Consequently, it appears this hydrogen bond network represents an optimal balance between facile autoactivation and substrate catalysis. We recently reported that the Thr \u03b3-methyl may accelerate the intramolecular cyclization that occurs during the N-O acyl shift in autoproteolysis. 13 This phenomenon is known as the Reactive Rotamer Effect (RRE) 24 and a similar effect may apply to any reaction for which the rotamer distribution may be shifted to favor the reactive state by the addition of steric bulk. This is precisely the case for ThnT and P\u03b2S, where the inactive g+ rotamer is structurally viable for both Thr and Ser, but is destabilized by Thr because the \u03b3-methyl shields a hydrogen bond with Gly322 (in ThnT) or Lys33 (in P\u03b2S). 9 Similarly, the g+ rotamer cannot be formed for the ornithine acyltransferases (members of the D/O superfamily) because it would cause a strong 1.7-\u00c5 steric clash with the Thr111 in the oxyanion hole. 25 Hence, comparison of ThnT with P\u03b2S and other Ntn enzymes reveals unique features of each active site that promote formation of a reactive state. Combined with the role of the RRE in autoproteolysis, we believe these effects strongly and specifically contribute to the selection of Thr nucleophiles in autoproteolytic systems.\n\nThe position and orientation of the bound glycerol molecule define a groove that could represent part of the substrate-binding pocket for the pantetheine moiety of the substrate. Interestingly, residues from all three mobile loops participate in the formation of this pocket. The peptide bond of Gly77, which undergoes cis-trans isomerization, is 5.1 \u00c5 away from the catalytic nucleophile, further implicating the rearrangement in enzyme function. Because no other uncleaved D/O structures have been published, we cannot compare the transitions described here with homologues. The well characterized enzymes GA and P\u03b2S from the Ntn superfamily show minor structural differences after autoproteolysis, other than dissociation of the nascent C-terminus. 14, 16 However, these changes are not on the same scale as those observed for ThnT. Interestingly, prolonged incubation of ThnT resulted in further proteolysis of the \u03b1-subunit ( Figure S1 ). This raised the possibility that a secondary cleavage, similar to that observed for CA, 26 might also occur for ThnT. The slow timescale of the apparent hydrolysis, however, suggested the phenomenon could be due to a contaminating protease. Although inclusion of protease inhibitors failed to prevent this cleavage, N-terminal sequencing showed that hydrolysis occurred two residues prior to the first observed residue in the crystal structure. Because this is a disordered region far from the active site, we do not believe this secondary cleavage is relevant to the function of ThnT in vivo.\n\nThe scope of the structural changes revealed by our analysis of ThnT reinforces the general model that autoproteolytic maturation is more sophisticated than the obvious chemistry of bond making and bond breaking. Rather, considerable protein motion must occur as the protein shifts into a new folded state ensemble. Considering the broad implications of this hypothesis, we sought additional evidence to validate the relevance of the groups undergoing significant rearrangement by experimentally demonstrating their importance in substrate binding. To define the binding pocket and interactions with the substrate, we desired to co-crystallize the enzyme in a Michaelis complex. This has been accomplished for GA utilizing a Thr\u2192Cys variant of the nucleophile that was capable of slow autoproteolysis and substrate hydrolysis. 15 However, a similar scheme for ThnT was not possible because the comparable Thr\u2192Cys variant does not mature on an accessible time scale. 13 Instead, we pursued development of a covalent inhibitor harboring the pantetheine moiety that could be used with the wild-type enzyme.\n\nThe halomethyl ketones (HMKs) are a potent class of inactivators that have been used to covalently inhibit both serine and cysteine proteases. In the case of Ser proteases, both the catalytic nucleophile and histidine of the catalytic triad can be alkylated by HMKs. 27 Alternatively, inhibition of Cys proteases results in alkylation of only the thiol, implying inhibition through a different mechanism. 28 Although HMKs have been reported to inactivate the P\u03b2S 29 , the mode and mechanism of inhibition have not been reported for a Thr protease. Hence, development of an HMK inhibitor of ThnT could simultaneously answer the long-standing question concerning the mode of attachment of HMKs to this class of enzyme while providing detailed information about the substrate-binding interactions of ThnT. To this end, we used D-pantothenic acid as the starting material in a four-step synthesis of a chloromethyl ketone (CMK) derivative N-(4-chloro-3-oxobutyl)pantoamide ( Fig. 5a ) through a diazomethyl ketone intermediate (Scheme S1, see Supplemental Information for details of the synthesis). Incubation of the CMK pantoamide inhibitor with ThnT caused complete loss of pantethine hydrolysis activity, as measured by a qualitative TLC assay. We also tested the effect of the CMK pantoamide on the secondary cleavage events of ThnT and observed no changes ( Figure S1 ), excluding the possibility that they are caused by ThnT performing low efficiency intermolecular proteolysis.\n\nA 10-fold molar excess of the CMK pantoamide was incubated with ThnT for one hour, which was immediately used for crystallization. Crystals grew in the same conditions as native ThnT and yielded a 2.0-\u00c5 X-ray structure. Subsequent model building and refinement clearly showed loss of electron density corresponding to the bound glycerol in the wild-type crystal (Fig. 2b) . Instead, we observed continuous electron density extending onto Thr282 corresponding to a non-protein molecule covalently linked to the \u03b3O of the active site nucleophile (Fig. 5b) . Given the high resolution data and the structure of the CMK pantoamide, there was a single possible mode of binding that satisfied the electron density: loss of the chloride and formation of an ether linkage between Thr282 and the inhibitor. Because ThnT and P\u03b2S have similar active site geometry, we hypothesize this mode of inactivation is common between them.\n\nThe bridging methylene unit itself (C') is the only component that distinguishes the bound species and the acyl-enzyme intermediate formed during substrate catalysis. Consequently there is very little measurable distortion in the active site. All three bond angles that include the \u03b3O are compressed to ~102\u00b0. Comparison with the wild-type structure shows the \u03c8 angle of Thr282 has rotated 10\u00b0 such that the derivatized side chain is deflected away from the oxyanion hole. Additional rotation of the \u03c8 angle would provide space to allow the \u03b3O-bearing bond angles to relax. However, the system appears to have settled in an energetic minimum that maintains the hydrogen bond between Gly322 and Thr282 \u03b3OH. The lack of grossly unfavorable structural deviations introduced upon chemical derivatization indicates that inhibitor binding did not disrupt biologically relevant interactions.\n\nThe ketone of the inhibitor was designed to mimic the electrophilic amide of the substrate. As was predicted, the inactivated complex shows this group has bound in the oxyanion hole of the protein, with hydrogen bonds to the backbone amide of Phe144 and the side chain of Asn217. The remainder of the inhibitor extends out towards the protein surface, with its amide nitrogen forming a hydrogen bond to Gly77. Ser104 acts as a hydrogen bond donor to the carbonyl of the amide and a hydrogen bond acceptor to the secondary hydroxyl. Simultaneous satisfaction of these hydrogen bonds restricts the inhibitor to the observed conformation. Lastly, the terminal hydroxyl forms two water-mediated hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl of Pro78 (Fig. 5b) .\n\nAlthough a definitive mechanism for inactivation of ThnT is beyond the scope of the present study, the co-crystal structure establishes ThnT is alkylated at the nucleophilic position and few alternatives exist with respect to the mechanism of this derivatization. For the Ser proteases, the nucleophile attacks into the carbonyl forming an oxyanion that displaces the adjacent halide forming an oxirane intermediate. This 3-membered ring is subsequently opened by attack of the His residue of the catalytic triad, resulting in a second covalent attachment. 30 Were a comparable mechanism involving an oxirane to occur in the inactivation of ThnT, its formation would obey the well-known stereoelectronic requirement that attack of the oxyanion into C' proceed anti-periplanar to the chloride leaving group (Fig.  6b) . The location of the oxyanion is well-defined by the location of the oxyanion hole of ThnT. Modeling this species shows that placement of the chloride anti-periplanar to the oxyanion results in a strong steric clash with Ser320 and the carboxylate of Asp321. Because this geometry is intrinsic to oxirane formation, and the ThnT active site harbors features that would significantly impede expulsion of the chloride, we do not believe inactivation of ThnT occurs through an oxirane intermediate. Instead, the ether linkage reported here is most similar to the thioether formed upon derivatization of the cysteine proteases papain, 31 SARS-CoV peptidase 32, 33 and HAV 3C. 28 For the latter two enzymes, an episulfonium species was also trapped, presumably as an intermediate of the inhibition process. A comparable mechanism for ThnT would involve a highly unstable oxonium species that is unlikely to occur (Figure 6c ). Together, these constraints suggest the mechanism of HMK inhibition in ThnT is distinct from those reported for the serine and cysteine proteases.\n\nBecause formation of the tetrahedral intermediate is reversible, a competitive and irreversible S N 2 attack of T282 into C' could account for the observed ether linkage. Notably, this reaction would proceed through a trigonal bipyramidal transition state that is intrinsically stabilized by the adjacent carbonyl \u03c0-system 34 and the requisite orientation of the chloride for backside attack is reasonable, as indicated by modeling the complex of ThnT and the CMK pantoamide. Consequently, we believe the simplest, least-motion mechanism is the most likely: derivatization of ThnT by direct displacement of the chloride.\n\nIt has been shown that ThnT can hydrolyze a pantetheinylated carbapenam substrate and circumstantial evidence suggests that it acts late in the biosynthetic pathway. 12, 35, 36 Although the data presented here do not provide a ready explanation for the inability of ThnT to cleave phosphopanetheine, the catalytic activity of ThnT is clear. Formation of the Michaelis complex places the carbonyl of the scissile amide into the oxyanion hole (Fig. 7) . The majority of the enzyme-substrate interactions are in the pantothenate binding region defined by the ThnT-inhibitor structure (Fig. 5b) , consistent the capacity of ThnT to efficiently hydrolyze a variety of pantetheinylated compounds. 12 The cysteamine moiety of the substrate provides the ideal distance for the carboxylate of thienamycin to form a salt bridge with Arg148. The catalytic nucleophile is centered within the active site and its exposure to solvent is minimized by Phe144 and Phe348 from the opposite subunit. Like other N-terminal amidohydrolases 5, 37 , the \u03b1-amine deprotonates the hydroxyl of Thr282 to generate a reactive nucleophile. Attack into the substrate generates a tetrahedral intermediate whose collapse is concurrent with protonation of the amine leaving group. Studies have shown that amidohydrolases often provide a hydrogen bond acceptor to facilitate inversion of the nitrogen 38 , and we hypothesize Ser320 may satisfy this role for ThnT ( Figure S2) . Expulsion of the amino leaving group generates thienamycin and an acyl enzyme intermediate. A water molecule in a position similar to Wat1 or Wat2 ( Figure 2B ) is then activated by the \u03b1-amine, which hydrolyzes the acyl enzyme intermediate, regenerating the ThnT active site.\n\nCombined with our initial study of ThnT, the data reported here constitute the first glimpse into the complete `life cycle' of an enzyme from the D/O superfamily ( Figure S3 ). 13 When combined with existing information from the Ntn-superfamily, these data enabled an expanded analysis of autoproteolytic activation. In all systems, dissociation of the nascent C-terminus after autoproteolysis is favored by a lack of tertiary contacts. When autoproteolysis is initiated through a si-face attack, the same oxyanion hole is used for both self-cleavage and substrate catalysis. Within the active site, the Thr \u03b3-methyl facilitates this chemistry by directing the nucleophile into a reactive state. Lastly, we identified large structural rearrangements necessary for the formation of the ThnT substrate binding pocket. Although P\u03b2S is \"insignificantly different\" 16 before and after autoproteolysis, most other enzymes from the Ntn-superfamily, including penicillin acylase 39 , cephalosporin acylase 40 , and \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase 20 show evidence of a unique conformational rearrangement. These enzymes each contain a high degree of similarity with the ThnT pro-enzyme active site, but are structurally divergent after autoproteolysis. We propose this is evidence of a more general phenomenon. Autoprocessing systems with shared chemistry, regardless of lineage, will have comparable features prior to autoprocessing that may dissipate as each protein rearranges to its unique mature state. The observation that two markedly different conformations of the Arg74-Thr80 loop of ThnT (Figure 3b ) facilitate each of the hydrolytic chemistries highlights the orchestrated complexity of the structure-function relationship in autoproteolytic enzymes. Not only does sequence encode for an intrinsically reactive folded state but, as we have shown here for ThnT, the downstream consequences of this selfcleavage result in spontaneous reorganization to the catalytically competent state of the mature enzyme.\n\nThnT was expressed, purified, and concentrated to 7.7 \u03bcg/\u03bcL as previously described for the inactive T282C variant. 13 The enzyme was incubated at 20 \u00b0C for 6 h prior to being flash frozen for storage at \u221280 \u00b0C. ThnT-inactivator complex was prepared by adding a 10-fold molar excess of the inactivator and incubating at 20 \u00b0C for 1 h immediately prior to use in crystallization attempts. Crystals were grown by sitting drop vapor diffusion against a 1 mL reservoir solution of 14-18 % PEG3350 and 0.5-0.7 M sodium acetate. Crystals grew overnight and were cryoprotected by immersion into 20% PEG3350, 0.7 M sodium acetate and 20% glycerol prior to flash-freezing in N 2 . Crystallization and data collection for ThnT were carried out at X6A at the National Synchrotron Light Source. Data for the ThnT-Inhibitor complex were collected on BL12-2 at the Stanford Synchrotron Light Source. Both structures were solved by molecular replacement using the PHASER program 41 , as implemented in the CCP4 package 42 . The structure of the uncleaved T282C variant of ThnT (PDB ID: 3S3U), with dual occupancies removed, was used as the search model. Iterative rounds of model building were performed in Coot 43 , using REFMAC5 for refinement. 44 After the protein and solvent atoms were defined, TLS operators were added and further refined in REFMAC5, which yielded significant improvements in R free for both models. 44, 45 Crystallographic and refinement statistics are listed in Table 1 . Coordinates were deposited to the Protein Data Bank with accession numbers 3TM1 (wt-ThnT) and 3TM2 (inactivated complex).\n\nPurified ThnT was diluted to 2 \u03bcg/\u03bcL into buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, with 10% glycerol) with and without 20-fold molar excess of CMK pantoamide inhibitor and incubated at 37 \u00b0C. Samples were withdrawn every 12 h for SDS-PAGE analysis and at 12 h and 48 h to assay for panthethine hydrolysis activity. Samples were run on 15% SDS-PAGE for 1 h and visualized with Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. S1 ). Aliquots containing the \u03b1subunit degradation products were re-run on 15% SDS-PAGE for 3 h and electroblotted onto a PVDF membrane. The smallest \u03b1-subunit was sent to the Johns Hopkins Medical Institute Synthesis and Sequencing Facility for N-terminal sequencing. ThnT pantethine hydrolysis activity was monitored by incubation with 10 mM pantethine for 1h followed by spotting on a TLC plate. Samples without inhibitor present turned purple upon addition of Ninhydrin reagent, consistent with hydrolysis of the pantetheine moiety, whereas those with the CMK pantoamide did not stain.\n\nAll steps were performed with the Discovery Studio (DS) 2.1 software suite. The carbapenem substrate and covalent intermediates were generated with the structure drawing functionality of DS 2.1 and manually docked in the active site of ThnT. Generally, the system was typed with the CHARMM force field and minimized using an adopted basis NR algorithm. 46 Crystallographic waters were explicitly included in all minimizations. Attempts to position the substrate or inhibitor in an orientation substantially different from the observed conformation (e.g. placing the chlorine atom inside the oxyanion hole), resulted in significant active site distortion. All rotamers of the CMK C'-Cl bond were independently minimized before and after oxyanion formation to assess the capacity of ThnT to accommodate reactive intermediates. All hydrogen bonding interactions defined by the inhibitor-bound structure were constrained to \u00b1 0.2 \u00c5 of their measured values. The algorithm exited after achieving a root-mean-squared gradient of < 0.1 kcal/(mol \u00c5). All other settings were default.\n\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material. Topology diagrams of P\u03b2S and ThnT. a) Coloring of P\u03b2S from dark (N-terminus) to light (C-terminus) shows the \u03b1\u03b2\u03b2\u03b1 architecture has unique connectivity at each half of the fold, which is comprised of \u03b1-helices and a pair of anti-parallel \u03b2-sheets. The nucleophile is labeled T1. b) The global fold of ThnT arose from a gene duplication event, as evidenced by the identical connectivity of the central \u03b1\u03b2\u03b2\u03b1 unit (colored) characteristic of the D/Osuperfamily of autoproteolytic enzymes. 11 The nucleophile, T282, is adjacent to a parallel \u03b2strand and the oxyanion hole element F144 is on a geometrically identical region of the protein as G47 of P\u03b2S, whereas N217 is located closer to the nucleophile in the primary sequence. Non-conserved structural motifs are colored white. Image generated with TopDraw. 47 Model of the ThnT Michaelis-complex with a pantetheinylated carbapenem. This model shows that the substrate binding cavity is well-suited to accommodate a carbapenem substrate and that a positively charged residue, R148, is positioned to form a salt bridge with the carboxylate moiety of the substrate.
