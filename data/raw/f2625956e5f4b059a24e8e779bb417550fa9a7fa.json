We estimate, for example, that Ebola virus 200 disease and Marburg virus disease (MVD) are most likely to be misidentified as dengue 201 haemorrhagic fever, yellow fever, or typhoid fever. The clinical features caused by EVD and 202 MVD outbreaks are more likely to be caused by other diseases until at least 6 and 7 cases 203 occur, respectively. Before this detectability threshold, the balance of probabilities suggests a 204 few cases of more common aetiologies are presenting with rare clinical features; after this 205 threshold, the presentation of cases is unusual enough to suggest a common presentation of 206 extremely rare aetiologies (i.e., filoviral disease). We summarise the estimated 207 detectabilities-i.e., probabilities of correct aetiological identification-for each syndrome in 208 with malaria at small cluster sizes (approx. 1-5 cases) and dengue haemorrhagic fever at 214 larger sizes (approx. 5+ cases) and is not 50% detectable until a cluster size of 25 cases. 215\n\nConsidering all 18 clinical features included in our database, most other syndromes reach 216 50% detectability within the first 5 cases; this includes moderately rare syndromes such as 217 leptospirosis, yellow fever, and typhoid fever. Reducing the range of clinical features 218 considered dramatically reduces identifiability of most syndromes (Fig 3) . Considering only 219 minimal VHF features (i.e., fever, haemorrhage/bleeding, death, hiccups, and jaundice) 220 renders most syndromes undetectable by 20 cases, suggesting that e.g., case definitions for 221 EVD or MVD are insufficient to detect them within the first 20 cases. However, the addition 222 of nonstandard symptoms improves the detectability of filoviral diseases and other VHFs 223 substantially. 224 225 .

Considering endemic context at a higher spatial resolution reveals heterogeneity in 238 detectability and regions where EVD is most able to spread undetected (Fig. 4-A) . Where 239 existing risk maps for EVD consider the ecological niche of Ebola virus in reservoir hosts 240 and/or human population density and movement, we add an entirely new layer to the EVD 241 map representing variation in outbreak detectability. Considering detectability of EVD 242 clusters in the context of existing geospatial estimates of spillover risk demonstrates potential 243 \"hidden hotspots\" where EVD is both most able to spread undetected by syndromic 244 surveillance and most likely to spill over from wildlife into people (Fig. 4-B) . These potential 245 hidden hotspots include central coastal West Africa, northern provinces of the Democratic 246 .

Given more outbreak data-286 in terms of quantity, syndromes represented, and consistency of clinical feature reporting-287 we expect to be able to improve the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the algorithm for 288 categorising real outbreak data. As is, however, our mechanistic approach still enables strong 289 insights into the relationships among outbreak detection, case definitions and the values of 290 clinical features for disease identification, and local endemic context. 291 292 A central challenge to developing this approach has been the lack of standardised clinical 293 data, especially given the high dimensionality of our model. For example, we have been 294 unable to gather comparable data on non-communicable diseases or toxic aetiologies. 295\n\nAlthough haemorrhagic and febrile syndromes are unlikely to be misdiagnosed as non-296 infectious syndromes 5 , the paucity of data on such syndromes may prevent such an approach 297 from being used on, for example, syndromes presenting with jaundice or neurological 298 symptoms. Particularly scant data is also available for many uncommon or seemingly 299 .

Additionally, few studies describing the presentation of 302 syndromes describe heterogeneity in their presentation. We accounted for this heterogeneity 303 by introducing wider clinical feature distributions for those syndromes which represent 304 pooled aetiological agents (e.g., ascribing high heterogeneity to \"diarrhoeal diseases,\" which 305 includes a range of pathogens, and moderate heterogeneity to most clinical features of EVD, 306 which may be caused by several distinct filovirus species). However, more consistent and 307 comprehensive reporting of clinical feature prevalence across strains and settings would 308 enable stronger accounting for heterogeneity in disease presentation. Furthermore, an advantage of our approach is its ability to exploit-rather than work 326 against-the uncertainty inherent in syndromic data from diseases with heterogeneous 327 presentations. Critically, this allows detection of diseases at population levels even before 328 any individual-level diagnosis occurs (e.g., before the development of tests for rare/novel 329 pathogens or in settings with insufficient diagnostic capacity). 330\n\nOur approach has the potential to clarify aspects of disease emergence far beyond those 332 presented here for viral haemorrhagic fevers.

The inclusion of 335 more pathognomonic signs and symptoms in particular could improve our ability to 336 distinguish between diseases. It would also be possible to estimate observation probabilities We demonstrate that filoviral diseases, along with yellow fever, represent a distinct and 346 distinguishable group of syndromes based on their estimated syndromic distances from other 347 febrile syndromes in sub-Saharan Africa. However, filoviral haemorrhagic fevers remain 348 difficult to detect based on symptoms alone due to their relative rarity. A cluster of 349 haemorrhagic fever with a high risk of mortality, for example, even with a low proportion of 350 jaundice, is more likely to be caused by yellow fever than either Marburg virus disease or 351\n\nEbola virus disease until well more than 20 cases have occurred. Consideration of every 352 clinical feature in our dataset-the collection of which would require extensive health system 353 coordination, universal health access, and deep clinical expertise-still only allows for 354 attribution of EVD or MVD by the sixth and seventh case, respectively. In an area 355 unaccustomed to such diseases or without adequate resources, months of transmission could 356 outbreak-i.e., when filoviral disease is unlikely to be a common diagnostic consideration-368 requires even greater sensitivity and specificity to Ebola's clinical manifestations than ETC 369 triage. Furthermore, the variation we demonstrate in the detectability of EVD clusters across 370\n\nWest and Central Africa indicates that appropriate case definitions for routine surveillance 371 might require tailoring to local or regional endemic context. 372 373 Although a strength of our approach is the use of endemic disease data to understand rare and 374 poorly observed diseases, it is still limited by the availability of appropriate ecological and 375 epidemiological data. The relatively high predicted detectability of EVD outbreaks in 376\n\nEthiopia, for example, may be an artefact of underestimated incidences of dengue, malaria, 377 and yellow fever in the country (Fig. S7 ). More broadly, niche maps for filoviral and other 378 zoonotic diseases with wildlife origins rely on incompletely observed human/primate 379 outbreak data for validation 35 .

Furthermore, although it seems unlikely that a healthcare 458 worker would initiate the testing for diseases as rare as EVD or MVD outside the context of 459\n\nOur results suggest that the best way to find filovirus outbreaks early is to build systems for 471 controlling the endemic diseases that obscure them. Just as under-resourcing health systems 472 creates multiple interacting effects that allow disease to thrive, improving basic public health 473 infrastructure can have far-reaching effects. We demonstrate the benefits of diagnostic and 474 surveillance infrastructure for improving detection of emerging haemorrhagic fevers, but also 475 that supporting population health-including universal health coverage 69,70 , water and 476 sanitation infrastructure 71,72 , and strategies to address the socio-political determinants of 477 health 73,74 -has compounding benefits in terms of disease detection. By reducing endemic 478 burdens, for example, progress in these areas can make rare epidemics easier to detect (an 479\n\nindirect effect analogous to that of vaccination and sanitation for reducing antibiotic "}
