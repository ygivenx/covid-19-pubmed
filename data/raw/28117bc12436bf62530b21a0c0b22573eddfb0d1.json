{"title": "Rapid and Sensitive Detection of PRRSV by a Reverse Transcription-Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification Assay", "body": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is a highly contagious disease causing severe economic losses in the swine industry. It is characterized by reproductive failure, respiratory disease and various clinical signs including loss of appetite, fever, dyspnea and mild neurological symptoms [5, 17] . There are two major PRRSV genotypes [10] , referred to as North American and European, and the North American genotype is predominant in China. Previous studies have shown that the non-structural protein 2 (nsp2) coding gene, in particular the central region of this gene, may contribute largely to the genetic variation in PRRSV genomes, while high conservation is exhibited in the N-terminal putative protease domain and the C-terminal predicted transmembrane region [18] . In addition, the Nsp2 protein of PRRSV possesses potential enzymatic function, although this was shown to be highly heterogeneous and variable 253 [15] . Since the first widespread outbreak of PRRS in China in 2006, atypical PRRS, caused by variations in PRRSV strain VR2332, has been reported in more than 10 Chinese provinces and regions [9] .\n\nSince the development of loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) in 2000 by Notomi et al [12] , this novel detection method has been extensively used to detect viruses of a wide range of species from humans to animals [4, 14] . This method offers the advantages of simplicity and sensitivity, which can be performed in one step, in real time. Reverse transcription (RT)-LAMP relies on an auto-cycling strand displacement DNA synthesis reaction performed using the Bst DNA polymerase large fragment under isothermal conditions at a temperature of between 60\u00b0C and 65\u00b0C, which enables the amplification reaction to be performed in a heating block without the need for precise centralized laboratory facilities [3] . This technique is high specificity because the target sequence is recognized by six independent sequences in the initial stage and by four independent sequences during the later stages of the RT-LAMP reaction. This method generates ascendant turbidity in positive samples, allowing detection by the naked eye or real-time monitoring.\n\nPrevious reports have indicated that the nsp2 region of the PRRSV genome contains restriction enzyme sites, so in this organism, amplification can be further confirmed by enzyme digestion. Several studies have reported the rapid detection of PRRSV using a RT-LAMP assay [1] . In this study, we developed another RT-LAMP assay to detect prototypic and prevalent North American PRRSV strains that Table 1 .\n\nA total of 42 suspected field samples of PRRSV collected from farms in Jiangxi and Guangdong province in 2008. Each specimen was from one piglet or fetus and comprised liver, spleen, lung, lymph node and one or more serum samples. All samples were stored at \u221280\u00b0C prior to use. \n\nTotal RNA was extracted from clinical samples or cell culture supernatants of PRRSV isolates using an RNA extraction kit (TaKaRa) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\nThe RT-LAMP reaction was carried out in a total reaction volume of 25 \u03bcL containing 12. \n\nTotal RNA was extracted from the collected field samples and analyzed by the RT-LAMP assay. As a control, a conventional RT-PCR, following the methods of Yue et al. [19] , was performed simultaneously. To validate the RT-LAMP results, virus was isolated from 42 clinical samples. Porcine alveolar macrophages were used to isolate the virus. Virus isolation followed the methods of Osorio et al [13] . The viruses isolated from samples were tested as outlined by Gonnie Nodelijk et al [11] . Samples were considered negative after two blind passages.\n\nThe RT-LAMP assay was standardized using PRRSV strain BJ, isolated from a patient with clinically diagnosed PRRS. The RT-LAMP assay successfully amplified the target sequence of the PRRSV nsp2 region and this was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1) . The amplification products appeared in a ladder-like pattern on the gel due to the formation of a mixture of stem-loop DNAs of various stem lengths and cauliflower-like structures with multiple loops formed by annealing between alternately inverted repeats in the target sequence in the same strand. In the negative control, no specific amplification products were observed, in accordance with the results collected by the Loopamp real-time turbidimeter (Fig. 2) .\n\nThe RT-LAMP products were digested with SupI and analyzed by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis. For strain VR-2332, the RT-LAMP product was digested into two bands of 160 bp and 120 bp, whereas the RT-LAMP product of the highly pathogenic isolate BJ was not digested by SupI (Fig. 3) .\n\nThe sensitivity of the RT-LAMP assay for the detection of PRRSV North American strains was determined using 10-fold serial dilutions of virus that had previously been quantified by the TCID 50 assay and comparing these results with those of conventional RT-PCR. The RT-LAMP assay was able to amplify the virus in 60 min, with a detection limit corresponding to a 10 -5 dilution of template RNA (Fig. 4) . On comparing the two assays, RT-LAMP was found to be 100-fold more sensitive than RT-PCR, \n\nFollowing digestion with SpuI, DNA fragments were cloned and sequenced. Sequence analysis indicated over 97% homology between the sequence of the amplified fragment and the nucleotide sequence published in the NCBI database, indicating that the RT-LAMP assay was highly specific. Table 2) .\n\nThere are three methods commonly used for virus [16] . Serological tests, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and\n\nimmunofluorescence assays, generally require complicated procedures and expensive antibodies and are therefore not widely applicable, especially for early or pre-clinical diagnoses [2, 7, 8] . Although reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a highly sensitive and specific method, the dependence on specialized equipment limits its use in the field or in basic laboratories [2, 6] . The development of molecular detection methods to simplify the diagnosis procedure is of great importance. RT-LAMP is a one-step assay that does not require a cDNA synthesis step, simplifying the method and decreasing the risk of contamination [18] . The use of three primer pairs corresponding to six target sequences in the RT-LAMP assay was conferred high specificity but can also make primer design a challenge in viruses The PRRSV RT-LAMP assay described in this study showed greater specificity than conventional RT-PCR. There was no cross-reactivity between PRRSV and other related viruses, such as CSFV strain CHLV, PCV2, PRV and SIV, which suggeated that the method was highly specific. In addition, RT-LAMP is a simple and rapid procedure, providing results within 1 h, which is significantly quicker than conventional RT-PCR. Of the 33 positive samples detected by RT-LAMP, three were missed by RT-PCR. Furthermore, restriction analysis allowed for the specific detection of highly pathogenic PRRSV strains. In summary, we have constructed a rapid, sensitive RT-LAMP assay for PRRSV detection that has the potential to be applied to on-the-spot detection in the field."}
