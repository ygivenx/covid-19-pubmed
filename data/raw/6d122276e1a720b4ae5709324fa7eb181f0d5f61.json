{"title": "", "body": "Acute infectious nonbacterial gastroenteritis (AING) in children is a common cause of hospitalization.\n\nFirst described by Zahorsky as \"winter vomiting disease,\" it has long been assumed to be due to viral etiologies. 1 Only recent-01y with the advent of newer technologies have we been able to identify specific v~ruses in infected patients.\n\nMost AING has been attributed to rotavirus and Norwalk-like viruses.\n\nOther viruses, including corona virus~like particles, adenoviruses, astroviruses and caliciviruses may also cause AING. 2, 3 Diagnoses are made with the aid of electron microscopy (EM), immunoelectronmicroscopy, tissue culture, and a variety of serologic techniques including enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and radioimmunoassay (RIA). 4 Demonstration of the virus in stool along with serologic evidence of antibody in patients with gastroenteritis is strong evidence for a causative role of the virus.\n\nWe know most about Norwalk-like viruses and rotaviruses.\n\nNorwalk virus and Norwalk-like viruses ire associated with gastroenteritis, usually outside the infant age group. 5 This disease has an explosive onset, short duration (24 to 48 hours), is usually self-limited and characteristically occurs in epidemics. Symptoms include yomiting, diarrhea, nausea, abdominal cramps, low-grade fever, anorexia, headache, malaise and myalgias. Mucosal lesions of the proximal small bowel are produced by the virus.\n\nAntibody is present in most adults, usually first appearing during late adolescence and early adult life.\n\nThe role of antibody in immunity to reinfection is not clear.\n\nDiagnosis is made by immunoelectronmicroscopy.\n\nRadioimmunoassay can also be used.\n\nNeither of these techniques is available on a routine basis in most clinical settings which makes diagnosis difficult.\n\nRotavirus AING is a disease of infants and young children.\n\nIt usually occurs during cooler months in temperate climates.\n\nThe illness is more prolonged than Norwalk-like virus AING (usually about one week) and is potentially more serious.\n\nRotavirus AING results in significant morbidity and mortality in third world nations and accounts for a significant number of infant hospitalizations in the United States. 6 Most children over 2 years of age have antibody. Antibody appears to be serotype specific.\n\nThere are at least two serotypes of rotavirus that afflict humans. 3\n\nSymptoms include diarrhea which is usually severeand watery; vomiting and fever may accompany the diarrhea.\n\nSevere dehydration may ensue resulting in hospitalization.\n\nThe diagnosis of rotavirus AING is by EM of stool specimens.\n\nThis method is not readily available in most settings. Alternatives include ELISA and RIA.\n\nTherapy for AING, regardless of viral etiology, is fluid and electrolyte replacement.\n\nThere is not any available antiviral therapy for these infections. Prevention depends on interrupting the fecal-oral route cycle.\n\nImmunization against rotavirus is still in the experimental state but may be available in a few years.\n\nThere is not yet a candidate Norwalk-virus vaccine developed.\n\nAcute infectious nonbacterial gastroenteritis results in high morbidity and mortality in developing nations.\n\nIn the United States, it accounts for a significant number of infant hospitalizations as well as days lost from school or work. \n\nPhysicians and lay persons have become quite exercised about Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).\n\nSee IDN, Volume 2, Number 2, page 9, for a description of this disorder. The anxiety stems, in part, from the unknown cause and mode of transmission of AIDS.\n\nVirtually everyone believes it is caused by an infectious agent probably transmitted by blood and/or intimate contact from/with an infected patient. This belief is enhanced by the reported instances in children who received blood or blood 9 products including those very few with hemophilia who are recipients of coagulation factors prepared from donor blood. 1 One persistent fear emphasized to me by a large number of direct inquiries is the possibility of acquisition %f AIDS from hepatitis B virus vaccine (HBVV). To some, HBVV is suspect because it is prepared from plasma donated by hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive persons. 2 HBsAg-positive individuals are frequent in the groups also susceptible to AIDS, especially male homosexuals and persons using illicit drugs by the intravenous route. 3 Since the latter groups may have donated blood, some individuals conclude that the putative AIDS agents may have been present in blood donated for HBsAg preparation as vaccine.\n\nThus far, all that has been said is supposition, theory, anxiety and concern.\n\nThere are many \"ifs\" included in this chain of reasoning, none of which is known for certain.\n\nAt the present time, we can only look at the evidence and draw our own set of inferences as to the likelihood of AIDS transmission by such a product as HBVV.\n\nFirst, we are not certain AIDS is caused by an infectious agent, although this is the most likely possibility. Were it to be proved that AIDS results from a noninfectious stimulus such as immune complexes to other than an infectious agent, much of the concern would evaporate.\n\nIf AIDS is caused by an agent, then the characteristics of that agent, its environmental stability and its mode of transmission will determine the possibility and degree of risk, if any, of acquisition by products derived from blood.\n\nSecond, thousands of persons have received HBVV. 4 What is the AIDS experienced in this group, and, in groups of comparable risk-of-AIDS status who have not received HBVV?\n\nThe experience is reassuring.\n\nBoth published and ~npubfished data suggest no risk.\n\nOf 442 medical staff given HBVV in original tials, none have developed AIDS in the last three years. 5 Similarly, no cases of AIDS have appeared in specific high risk vaccine groups.\n\nStevens reports that of 549 male homosexuals given HBVV in 1978-79, one has developed Kaposi's sarcoma (a component of AIDS) four years later.\n\nAnother recipient, in a second trial, developed Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia two years after vaccine receipt.\n\nStevens calculates the frequency as 2.4/1000 in the vaccine groups.\n\nHowever, men who had been screened for the vaccine trial and rejected because they already had been infected with hepatitis B numbered 3646; of these, 16 cases of AIDS occurred, an incidence of 4.4/1000.\n\nThus the rate is higher in the nonrecipients of HBVV in an identical risk category.\n\nThe dual findings of no cases in low risk groups receiving HBVV and no excess in HBVV recipients in high risk groups compared to non-HBVV recipients in the same groups suggest no risk from vaccine.\n\nThird, the preparation and testing of HBVV is among the most rigorous of all vaccine productions.\n\nKnowing that the final HBVV was to be PrePared from individuals with circulating infectious hepatitis B virus and prone to other infections, the manufacturers established a production protocol that includes three different modes of \"killing\" of infectious agents; these steps are known to inactivate representative viruses of all types.\n\nFurther, many types of isolation for infectious agents are done during and after the manufacturing process.\n\nNo infectious agents have been isolated.\n\nFinally, when one views the entire mass of data, the only reasonable conclusion is that there is no demonstrable risk of acquiring AIDS from HBVV.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control recently reported no AIDS among 200,000 individuals who have received HBVV since its general availability in July, 1982. 4 The only two cases that have occurred were in the male homosexuals referred to above who participated in the vaccine trials prior to licensure. She had been treated elsewhere f6r her conjunctivitis, during the course of which she began to cough, at first intermittently and then with increasing hoarseness and grouped into \"sp~lls\". Severe decrease in intake and a single spell which caused her to stop breathing brought her to admission after resucitation was successful.\n\nTwo siblings, aged 3 and 9 years, were reported to be in good health but an 18-month-old sibling had similar symptoms 7 to i0 days earlier; none of the children had received all immunizations; the 3-and 9-year-old, no DTP and the 18-month-old only one dose \"a few weeks ago.\" Initial assessment included: rapid, labored respirations at 60/minute; hypotonia; mild interstitial retractions; scattered inspiratory rales and intermittent paroxymal cough associated with cyanosis and questionable whoop.\n\nWithin 24 hours she developed severe anoxia, respiratory distress and apneic episodes, cyanosis and marked pallor.\n\nShe required assisted ventilation through an endotracheal tube for the next 32 days.\n\nDuring this period, she developed generalized grand mal seizures, requiring initial and maintenance phenobarbital.\n\nHer course was marked by need for central hyperalimentation, severe anemia, an intercurrent urinary tract infection and otitis media. Her central nervous system status was uncertain on discharge.\n\nShe had a fluorescent antibody test positive for B. pertussis and the organism was recovered from a nasopharyngeal swab.\n\nDuring her illness adenovirus was recovered from nasopharyngeal specimen.\n\nHer hospital bill was $52,502.62 and professional fees were $3427.00 for a total of $55,929.62.\n\nWe have written much about pertussis in our columns in recent months.\n\nRather than repeat all the facts and figures, I thought display of this case in detail would provide a personalized version of the statistics.\n\nBoth the human toll to her and her family and the cost are obvious.\n\nHer illness conceivably was preventable had the siblings had their DTP immunizations at appropriate times. It appears as if she acquired pertussis from her 18-month-old sister.\n\nThe importance of the concomitant adenovirus is controversial.\n\nSome experts believe that both agents contribute to a more severe expression of pertussis.\n\nWe all have cared for infants similar to this patient without positive adenovirus isolation.\n\nIn all the furor over the pros and cons of pertussis and pertussis vaccine, one forgets that the disease still occurs and can still be severe and even lethal. We report our patient as a reminder of this fact to keep the debate in perspective.\n\nReview of our in-patient records demonstrates at least 27 infants hospitalized for pertussis in the last three years and an indeterminate number of older infants and children treated as out-patients.\n\nOur hospitalized children ranged from 1 month to 9 months of age and the cost of hospitalization varied from as little as $400.00 to $50,000.00+. Alfred Sabin and his coworkers report on the successful immunization of children with and without maternal antibody by the use of an aerosolized nasal vaccine.\n\nIn 100% of 4-to 6-month-old and older children, with and without residual maternal antibody, inhalation of undiluted aerosolized nasal vaccine produced antibody responses.\n\nThe human diploid cell vaccine used was stabilized with 1% human albumin.\n\nIn a comparative trial, a chick embryo fibroblast vaccine containing ten times more virus stabilized with hypertonic sugar solution, but without added protein, was less successful in achieving antibody responses. Dr. Sabin's group believes that the hypertonic sugar solution may have been responsible for this lesser efficacy. His discussion notes that titers in the children of transplacentally transferred maternal antibody as high as 1:512 did not prevent an immune response with aerosolized vaccine.\n\nLevels of this type do prevent responses after subcutaneous .injection of currently employed measles vaccines.\n\nNo immediate clinical reactions were seen in the 160 children who inhaled the aerosolized vaccine and although subsequent reactions among the 96 children who were successfully gO 1983 by Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc."}
