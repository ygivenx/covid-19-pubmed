{"title": "Design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of novel iso-D D-2 0 ,3 0 - dideoxy-3 0 -fluorothianucleoside derivatives", "body": "Since zidovudine (AZT) 1 has been known as a potent anti-human immunodeficiency virus (anti-HIV) agent, a number of nucleoside analogues have been designed, synthesized, and their antiviral activities were evaluated against a variety of viruses including HIV for the development of antiviral agents. Particularly, 2 0 ,3 0 -dideoxynucleosides (ddNs) have exhibited potent anti-HIV activity. Among them, didanosine (ddI), 2 zalcitabine (ddC), 3 and stavudine (d4T) 4 have been launched as drugs for the treatment of AIDS patients (Fig. 1) . However, these 2 0 ,3 0 -ddNs have several drawbacks such as easy cleavage of their glycosidic bond under acidic conditions similar to a gastric environment and catabolism by adenosine deaminase (ADA), adenosine-5 0 -monophosphate (AMP) deaminase, and purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP).\n\nAlso, lamivudine (3TC) 5 has been clinically used for the treatment of AIDS and HBV (hepatitis B virus) infec-tion (Fig. 2) . Structural characteristics of lamivudine are that there is no hydroxyl substituent at both its 2 0 -and 3 0 -positions like 2 0 ,3 0 -ddN analogues and are two heteroatoms on the sugar moiety. In addition, lamivudine belongs to L L-nucleoside unlike other anti-AIDS drugs. Isonucleosides 6 in which their base is moved into C2 0 -position from anomeric position have been synthesized and evaluated for anti-HIV activity. Among them, iso-ddA and iso-ddG were found to be active against HIV-1 without cytotoxicity and this class of nucleosides were known to possess the intrinsic metabolic advantages such as resistance to ADA and enhanced stability of glycosidic bond under acidic and enzymatic conditions compared to natural nucleosides and 2 0 ,3 0 -ddNs including lamivudine. 6a,7 On the other hand, a fluorine atom has been used as a good bioisostere because many fluorinated nucleosides such as 2 0 -F-ddA, 8 2 0 -F-ara-ddC, 9 and FLT 10 were found to exhibit significant antiviral activities. Furthermore, it is worthy to note that L L-nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine can be considered as iso-D D-nucleoside analogue as shown in Figure 2 .\n\nTherefore, as a part of our continuous efforts searching for novel antiviral agents, it was interesting to design and synthesize iso-D D-2 0 ,3 0 -dideoxythianucleoside derivatives with a 3 0 -fluoro substituent and to evaluate them against various viruses because CH-F group might act as a bioisostere of sugar ring oxygen of lamivudine and/or as a hydrogen bonding acceptor at the active site of their target enzyme, and because the D D-sugar skeleton of iso-D D-2 0 ,3 0 -dideoxythianucleosides resembles L L-1,3oxathiolane ring of lamivudine. Here, we wish to report the asymmetric synthesis and biological activities of novel fluorinated iso-D D-2 0 ,3 0 -dideoxythianucleosides 1-4.\n\nA strategy for the synthesis of glycone of iso-D D-2 0 ,3 0dideoxy-3 0 -fluorothianucleosides is outlined in Scheme 1. It was envisioned that 1,4-anhydro-4-thioarabitol 6 derived from D D-glucose via 1,2;5,6-di-O-isopropylidene-D D-glucofuranose (5) could be an appropriate intermediate to synthesize D D-4-fluoro-3-thiophenol 12, which could be condensed with nucleobases to afford lamivudine analogues 1-4.\n\nDiacetone glucose 5 was derived from D D-glucose by the known one-pot synthesis method reported by Moravcova and his co-workers. 11 Compound 5 was converted into 1,4-anhydro-4-thioarabitol 6 according to the known procedure developed by Yoshimura and his co-workers over 10 steps. 12 Surprisingly, benzoylation of compound 6 with benzoyl chloride, DMAP, and pyridine at room temperature was very slowly converted to the corresponding benzoate 7. Elevated temperature (88\u00b0C) completed the benzoylation reaction in 3 h in 94% yield. Debenzylation of 7 with BCl 3 at \u00c078\u00b0C gave a secondary alcohol 8 whose stereochemistry has the appropriate configuration to introduce a-fluoro substituent when treated with (diethylamino)sulfur trifluoride (DAST). Fluorination of 8 with DAST gave the fluorinated compound 9 in 88% yield with the desired 'a' stereochemistry through double inversion mechanism by the nucleophilic participation of the ring sulfur atom. 13 Removal of benzoyl group of 9 using cat. NaOMe in MeOH gave the corresponding alcohol 10 in nearly quantitative yield, which was used for coupling with benzoic acid under Mitsunobu conditions. 14 During Mitsunobu reaction the nucleophilic participation of sulfur atom occurred only to the extent of 3-5%. The major product 11 which underwent a single inversion was formed in 88% yield with its epimer (3-5%) at 3-position. The structures of major and minor product, 11 and its epimer, were confirmed by comparing 1 H NMR data of the corresponding alcohols generated from each epimer after debenzoylation with those of compound 10. Debenzoylation of 11 afforded the glycosyl donor 12, which was ready for the condensation with nucleobases.\n\nSynthesis of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues under Mitsunobu conditions is illustrated in Scheme 2. Coupling of 12 with N 3 -benzoyluracil and N 3 -benzoylthymine, PPh 3 , and DEAD gave the desired b-nucleosides 13 (62%) and 14 (66%), respectively. It is worthy to note that the participation of sulfur atom did not occur at all during coupling of glycosyl donor 12 with nucleobases. N-benzoyl group with 1 M NaOMe produced TBDPSprotected compounds 15 and 16 in 82% and 94% yield, respectively. Finally, treatment of 15 and 16 with TBAF gave the desired final compounds 1 and 2, respectively. Confirmation of N-alkylated nucleosides 1 and 2 was determined by 13 C value of anomeric carbon of each nucleoside. 15 Compound 1 was converted into lamivudine analogue, cytosine nucleoside 3, via acetylation of the hydroxyl group followed by successive three conventional steps (1,2,4-triazole, POCl 3 , pyridine; 1,4-dioxane, NH 4 OH; NH 3 , MeOH) 16 in overall 54% yield.\n\nSynthesis of adenine nucleoside analogue 4 is shown in Scheme 3. Whereas reaction of D D-4-fluoro-3-thiophenol 12 with N 6 -benzoyladenine at room temperature for 2 d under Mitsunobu conditions (PPh 3 and DEAD) did not give a clear spot expected as the desired product on TLC, reaction with 6-chloropurine as a nucleobase instead of N 6 -benzoyladenine afforded the protected 6chloropurine nucleoside 18 in 88% yield. Participation degree of sulfur atom on the sugar ring seems like depending on electron density on the sugar ring, ring strain of the generated episulfonium cation, and properties of nucleophile and leaving group. Mitsunobu reaction of fluorinated compounds (10 and 12) with benzoic acid or nucleobases might have difficulty in forming episulfonium cation because the sugar ring is already electron-poor by electron-withdrawing fluoro group. Therefore, the major product was single inverted one (11, 13, 14, and 18 ). On the other hand, in case of DAST reaction of compound 8 there is no strong electron-withdrawing group such as a fluorine atom on the sugar ring, implying that participation of the sulfur atom is expected and the major product is double inverted one (9). The remaining things are conversion of 6chloropurine into adenine base and desilylation of TBDPS group in sequence. Surprisingly, treatment of compound 18 with methanolic ammonia at 80\u00b0C overnight accomplished not only amination at 6-position of 6-chloropurine base but also desilylation of TBDPS group, giving the final product 4 in 68% yield.\n\nAntiviral activities of all iso-D D-2 0 ,3 0 -dideoxy-3 0 -fluorothianucleoside derivatives 1-4 synthesized as a bioisostere of lamivudine were measured against a variety of viruses such as HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) type 1 and 2, EMCV (encephalomyocarditis virus), Cox. B3 (Coxsackie B virus type 3), VSV (vesicular stomatitis virus), and HSV (herpes simplex virus) type 1 and 2 (Table 1 ). EC 50 of compounds 1, 2, and 4 exceeded 100 lg/mL and also did not show any cytotoxicity up to 100 lg/mL at all tested cells such as MT4, HeLa, and Vero cells. On the other hand, cytosine nucleoside derivative 3 exhibited potent anti-VSV activity (EC 50 = 9 .43 lg/mL), whereas inactive (EC 50 > 100 lg/ mL) and non-cytotoxic (CS 50 and CC 50 > 100 lg/mL) against the other viruses. However, selectivity index (SI) of 3 showed low value of 1.56 due to its high cytotoxicity (CC 50 = 14 .54 lg/mL) in HeLa cell. It is very interesting that cytosine nucleoside analogue 3 designed as a bioisostere of lamivudine showed anti-VSV activity instead of the expected anti-HIV activity. Considering that VSV belongs to RNA virus, it is worthy to note that 3 classified into ddNs exhibited potent anti-VSV activity. Antiviral evaluation of compounds 1-4 was also performed against FluA (influenza virus type A) (H1N1) strain Taiwan, FluA (H3N2) strain Johannesburg, FCV (Feline coronavirus) strain WSU, and FIP (Feline infectious peritonitis virus) strain WSU, but all compounds did not show antiviral activity and cytotoxicity up to 100 lg/mL (not shown in Table 1 ).\n\nWe have designed and synthesized novel iso-D D-2 0 ,3 0 -dideoxythianucleoside derivatives 1-4 as a bioisostere of lamivudine to search for new anti-HIV agents. Among compounds tested, only cytosine analogue 3 showed potent anti-VSV activity even if it pertains to ddNs classification and VSV is RNA virus. This observation implies that iso-D D-2 0 ,3 0 -dideoxy sugar templates might act as a sugar surrogate of nucleosides for the development of anti-RNA virus agent. The information about participation of sulfur atom during fluorination reaction using DAST and Mitsunobu reaction will be of great help in synthesizing sulfur-containing compounds.\n\nMelting points are uncorrected.
