{"title": "", "body": "It is generally accepted as a central truth in biochemistry that the amino acid sequence of a protein encodes all necessary information for the chain in a given environment to fold into a single, well-defined stable structure. 1 For most proteins, this structure is under physiological conditions, the native, functional state. In certain circumstances, however, proteins may be able to fold into distinctly different structures, and during the past few years, increasing numbers of alternative folds have been discovered. Lymphotactin 2 and Mad2 (the mitotic arrest deficiency 2 protein) 3 are extreme examples of this type. The most common alternative structures comprise different multimeric assemblies of identical polypeptide chains. Multimers are endowed with structural and functional advantages, such as improved stability and control over the accessibility and specificity of active sites, explaining why oligomerization is favored during protein evolution. 4 Special cases of multimers are the so-called morpheeins, which are homo-oligomeric proteins that can switch their structure between functionally distinct alternate quaternary states. The prototypical example of a morpheein is the enzyme porphobilinogen synthase, which exists in an equilibrium between an octamer, a hexamer, and two dimer conformations. 5 Another special case of oligomerization has been described as 'three-dimensional (3-D) domain swapping' . 6 A 'domain-swapped' structure contains two or more polypeptide chains that exchange identical units. The exchanged portion may consist of a single secondary structure element or an entire globular domain. If exchange is reciprocal between two monomers, dimers are formed, and if more chains are involved, oligomers ensue.\n\nFolding into the native state is driven by a combination of entropic and enthalpic forces that result in burial of hydrophobic residues in the interior and exposure of polar residues on the surface of the protein. This network of defined attractive and repulsive forces arranges the chain in welldefined, secondary structure elements. In multimers, each single polypeptide chain usually adopts the same conformation, although the assembly of individual chains in the oligomer can vary. Often, small changes in protein composition or environment can tip the balance from one arrangement to the next, with some proteins coexisting in more than one oligomeric state. A classic example of alternate oligomers is the Bence-Jones protein, characterized by X-ray diffraction more than 40 years ago. This protein exists in the crystal in three quaternary structures 7 that vary in their domain interactions.\n\nCurrently, the Protein Data Bank (PDB) 8 contains 26 939 homo-oligomeric protein structures. The most commonly found assembly patterns are side-by-side and 'head-to-tail', but domain-swapped structures are becoming a sizeable fraction. In this chapter, not all oligomeric structures are considered; we are concerned with proteins for which domain swapping has been described.\n\nThe term 3-D domain swapping, or simply domain swapping, was originally coined by Eisenberg and colleagues to describe the X-ray structure of a diphtheria toxin (DT) dimer in 1994. 9 However, already in 1962, a report was published describing the exchange of an N-terminal fragment for bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A (RNase A) upon dimerization. 10 The first protein X-ray structures that contained domain-swapped elements were determined in the early 1980s, [11] [12] [13] with increasingly more structures of domain-swapped multimers following suit ( Figure 1 ).\n\nThis chapter introduces terms and features concerning domain swapping; reports on domain-swapped structures that are available in the PDB; summarizes ideas about putative mechanisms for this type of oligomerization; and describes a few examples in detail, for some of which domain swapping may be important for regulating function or triggering disease. Year Figure 1 Growth in domain-swapped structures deposited in the PDB. Proteins with identical sequences for monomeric and oligomeric states are shown in red, proteins that share greater than 90% sequence identity between the monomer and oligomer are shown in green, and proteins for which swapped structures have been described without monomeric counterparts are shown in blue.\n\nTrue domain-swapped structures require that both monomeric and oligomeric states must be observed for a single protein. 6 However, this stringent designation is not always adhered to in the literature. Sometimes, structures are called domain-swapped even if no structure of the closed monomer has ever been observed or where only a homolog exhibits a closed monomer. In the first case, the protein is a 'candidate' for domain swapping, whereas in the second, the oligomers are classified as 'quasi-domain-swapped.' In true domain-swapped structures, the exchanged subunit or domain in the oligomer is identical to the one in the corresponding monomer, exhibiting no differences in phi, psi backbone angles, except for the region that links the exchanging domains. This region is called the 'hinge loop' and often adopts an extended conformation in the domainswapped oligomer while it folds back on itself in the monomer. Although called 'domain swapping,' the term 'domain' encompasses a variety of structural units: The largest may be an independently folded domain, whereas the smallest can be single secondary structure elements, such as a single b strand or an isolated a helix. The intermolecular interfaces in the oligomer that possess identical intramolecular counterparts in the monomer form are called the 'closed' or primary interface, whereas newly created contact surfaces constitute the 'open' or secondary interface. A schematic representation of different domain-swapping scenarios as well as the delineation of the different structural interfaces is provided in Figure 2 .\n\nThis chapter considers mainly those proteins that contain swapped elements in their multimeric forms and for which a monomeric structure is seen for a mutant or close relative.\n\nCurrently, more than 100 domain-swapped structures are deposited in the PDB, with 38 examples for which both monomeric and oligomeric structures are available (Tables 1  and 2 ). These 38 proteins are nonrelated and exhibit less than 20% pairwise sequence identity. Among them, 19 cases exist with identical sequences for monomeric and oligomeric states; thus, they are examples of true domain swapping. The other 19 share greater than 90% sequence identity between the monomer and oligomer polypeptide, some involving single amino acid changes. Not surprisingly, structures for most domain-swapped oligomeric proteins have been determined by X-ray crystallography.\n\nAnalysis of the chain lengths, structural classification, or amino acid composition does not reveal any special properties associated with domain-swapped proteins. In the authors' data set, the shortest protein is the immunoglobulin binding domain B1 of streptococcal protein G (GB1), 55 which comprises only 56 residues, and the longest one is DT with 535 amino acids. 44 The ratio of all a proteins, all b proteins, and mixed a/b proteins for domain-swapped proteins is 2:2:5, Syntaxin TLG1  2C5K  2C5J  95  65-69  Helix  14  VAMP-7  2VX8  2VX8  169  40-45 d  Helix  15  spo0A  1QMP  1DZ3  130  107  Helix  16,17  Barnase  1BRN e  1YVS  110  37-41  Helices  18,19  FOXP2  2A07  2A07  93  538,544  Helices  20  Bcl2-L-1  1R2D  2B48  218  158-159  Helices  21, Sequence information was obtained from the FASTA file in the PDB. Coordinate information may not be available for all residues in the PDB file. c Hinge residues are numbered according to the monomer PDB file; these numbers may differ between monomer and dimer. d The protein contains a cleaved peptide bond in the hinge region or has no coordinate information in the PDB file. e No monomeric structure is available. The comparison is carried out for the monomer unit in a non-swapped dimer or oligomer. which is identical to the ratio reported for all structures in Structural Classification of Proteins, 84 and there appears to exist no specific amino acid requirements for domain-swapped proteins, compared to overall protein space. Similar findings hold when examining only the exchanged domains. They exhibit different sizes, ranging from a few residues to more than 100 amino acids. Single a helix or b strand can be swapped, bundles of a helices or b hairpins are found exchanged, and even mixed a helix and b strand elements can serve as the swapped domain, without any discernable sequence signature among them. 6 Although the exchanging unit can be located anywhere in the sequence, it is often found at one of the two termini. Human antithrombin III is an example in which the exchanged domain resides in the middle of the protein; this kind of exchange has also been termed 'hairpin insertion' . 32 An example in which almost onehalf of the entire polypeptide chain is exchanged is cyanovirin-N (CV-N). 30 The previous analysis reveals that proteins found in domain-swapped structures display the same diversity as any protein in the PDB. This suggests that almost any protein may be capable of undergoing domain swapping and that domain swapping is solely a specialized form of oligomer assembly.\n\nComparison between the closed conformation of the monomeric polypeptide chain and the open conformation of the same chain in the domain-swapped dimer implies that the observed large conformational differences most likely require some kind of un/refolding. Intramolecular interactions involving hydrophobic contacts, hydrogen-bonding, electrostatic interactions, and even disulfide bridge interactions 60, 85, 86 at the closed interface in the monomer are exchanged to intermolecular interactions. Naturally, such breaking and reforming of contacts requires energy -the activation energy for 3-D domain swapping. 87 To overcome the activation barrier between the monomer and the dimer, changes in environment, particularly conditions that favor unfolding, may play a role.\n\nFor proteins capable of domain swapping, folding from the unfolded polypeptide chain can lead, in principle, to either the closed monomer or the domain-swapped dimer. Partitioning between the two products is determined by their free energy difference. This difference is naturally very small, given that all interactions within the two structures are extremely similar; only the hinge loop conformation is distinct. Therefore, any free energy difference needs to be traced to the hinge loop, which can either introduce or relieve strain during monomer-dimer interconversion.\n\nThe hinge loop is the only region of the protein that adopts a different conformation in monomeric and domain-swapped structures. Therefore, sequences and secondary structures have received considerable attention in the search for local signals that could cause or influence domain swapping.\n\nSeveral studies show that altering the length of the hinge loop can switch the domain swapping propensity of a protein.\n\nIntuitively, one would expect that long loops preferentially result in monomers and short ones in dimer structures: A short loop will make it difficult for the polypeptide to fold back on itself and in turn allow the swapped portion of the chain to find partners more easily. This is clearly the case in staphylococcal nuclease. 65 The only sequence difference between the monomer and the domain-swapped dimer is the loop length, with the monomer loop containing six more residues than the hinge in the dimer. Loop residue deletion has also been used in some designed proteins. An elegant example illustrating the importance of loop length is provided by two different three-helix bundles that were engineered in the Eisenberg laboratory. 88 Loop deletion in one of these caused the formation of a domain-swapped dimer, whereas loop deletion in the other resulted in fibril formation. On the other hand, Perutz and colleagues found that adding a stretch of polyglutamines into the active site loop of chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 caused domain swapping and higher order oligomer formation. 89 Indeed, in this case, oligomerization increased with increasing loop lengths. Therefore, a universal statement regarding the influence of hinge loop length cannot currently be made.\n\nNot every amino acid in the hinge loop region has to change conformation. Sometimes, the alternative conformation is observed for only one or two residues. These could be the key hinge amino acids, and only their backbone phi and psi angles may have to change between monomer and dimer conformations. In the authors' data set, alanine and glycine are the most frequent amino acids in these key hinge positions, with their occurrence being much higher than commonly found. Glycine can adopt phi and psi angles in all four quadrants of the Ramachandran plot due to the lack of a side chain; therefore, it is possible to accommodate a glycine in any kind of turn, even quite sharp ones, which are sterically forbidden for other residues. For the cold shock protein cspB, 28 a flip in the backbone of G37 (DjE1801) is observed between monomer and domain-swapped dimer. Similarly, the small alanine residue is also more tolerant in terms of steric effects, and in the N-terminal swapped dimer of RNase A, only two adjacent alanines change their conformation compared to the monomer structure.\n\nIn the middle of hinge loop sequences, one also finds conserved prolines. 90 Because proline residues are thought to impart rigidity to the polypeptide backbone, Rousseau and colleagues suggested for the cyclin-dependent kinase regulatory subunit suc1 91 that the proline-caused strain in the hinge loop influences domain swapping. Indeed, replacement of the first proline in the hinge with an alanine stabilized the monomer form, whereas the same substitution of the second proline stabilized the dimer form. Rousseau et al. suggested that tension in the hinge loop in the monomer caused it to behave like a loaded molecular spring that is released when the alternative conformation is adopted in the dimer. 91 Unlike in suc1, mutation of the single proline in the hinge loop of CV-N to glycine substantially stabilized both states of the protein, with greater stabilization of the monomer compared to the dimer. 92 Furthermore, adding a second proline residue by mutating a neighboring amino acid caused the domainswapped dimer to become the thermodynamically most stable state. 92 Similarly, the change of alanine in the hinge loop of the forkhead box P2 (FOXP2) to proline prevented the formation of the swapped dimer. 20 This suggests that the addition or deletion of prolines creates no uniform outcome and that each protein may have its unique signature of hinge loop residues.\n\nIn addition to glycine, alanine, and proline, other amino acids in the hinge loops may also play a role in stabilizing particular secondary structure elements in the swapped domains. For example, a hinge loop could be a coil in the monomer form but become embedded into a long b strand or an a helix. This could stabilize the dimeric forms of these proteins, given the higher degree of secondary structure and the elimination of a flexible hinge region.\n\nFor a region in the protein to function as a hinge loop, it needs to be pliable enough to adopt different conformations. RNase illustrates this point. RNase A, 34 bovine seminal ribonuclease (BS-RNase), 93 and a human pancreatic ribonuclease (hRNase) chimera 94 share greater than 60% sequence identity, and all three proteins undergo domain swapping of their N-terminal helices, albeit with different relative orientations of the helix and different conformations in the three hinge loops. RNase A is also one of the rare examples that can swap either N-or C-terminal parts, with C-terminal strand exchange resulting in a domain-swapped dimer 35 or cyclic swapped trimer. 95 Overall, the combined results obtained for hinge loop properties provide useful hints with respect to domain swapping. However, no clear, predictive rules have emerged.\n\nThere are several examples in which residue changes in other parts of the protein besides the hinge loop are associated with domain swapping. A prime example is GB1. Compared to wild-type monomeric GB1, the domain-swapped dimer comprises four mutations -L5V, F30V, Y33F, and A34F -none of which are located in the hinge region. 56 A theoretical analysis of the quadruple mutant and wild-type GB1 from Wodak's group 96 suggested different effects caused by each change: L5V introduces general destabilization due to unfavorable interactions with its surrounding residues; F30V induces local strain due to a clash with its own backbone; and A34F not only destabilizes the monomer conformation by forcing W43 to adopt a strained side chain conformation, and therefore disrupts the hydrophobic core of GB1, but also stabilizes the swapped dimer by tightly packing its side chains from both subunits against each other in the dimer core. The importance of the individual mutated residues (L5V/F30V/ Y33F/A34F) in the integrity of the domain-swapped structure was also investigated by modeling and mutagenesis. 56 Inspection of the dimer structure suggested that the shorter mutant side chains of the L5V and F30V variants could easily be accommodated within the core, although possibly causing some destabilization of the structure. Indeed, each change is tolerated within the wild-type structure. The Y33F mutation represents a conservative change, and either side chain can substitute for the other in the respective cores. The position of F34 in the domain-swapped dimer appeared to be most crucial. This was verified experimentally: Reverting F34 in the amino acid sequence of the domain-swapped dimer mutant back to the wild-type alanine residue resulted in a monomeric protein with a very similar structure as that of wild-type GB1. 56 In the T cell surface antigen CD2, the propensity for dimer formation could be modulated by mutations in the new interface that is created by domain swapping. 97 In addition, a R87A mutation that destabilizes the monomer simultaneously increased dimer formation. However, as with the majority of other proteins, the hinge residues in CD2 were still the most crucial amino acids with respect to domain swapping. 97 In summary, residues distant from the hinge region can shift the relative stabilities of monomer and domain-swapped dimer and thereby modulate domain swapping properties. However, compared to the amino acids in the hinge loop region, they appear to play only a secondary role.\n\nDespite substantial efforts, no compelling proposal for a generally applicable and unified molecular mechanism of domain swapping has emerged to date. 6, [98] [99] [100] [101] Eisenberg and colleagues suggested a free energy diagram involving pathways for domain swapping based on their studies of DT ( Figure 3 ). 87 In their scenario, the 'open monomer' conformation retains the native fold of other parts of the 'closed monomer,' and only interactions at the closed interface are disrupted during unfolding of the monomer. Such a partial unfolding scheme may be at play in multidomain proteins in which separate, independently folding domains are exchanged. However, the existence of a stable open monomer is unlikely for most domain-swapped proteins in which only a few secondary structural elements are exchanged. These isolated structural elements will be unstable, and therefore complete un/refolding is more likely to be at play in these cases.\n\nIn RNase A, more than one portion of the chain can exchange, creating different oligomers ( Figure 4) . Two different domain-swapped dimers and two domain-swapped trimers are formed in different relative proportions. 95 Among the two dimers, the C-terminal swapped dimer is the major form, suggesting that it is more stable. For the trimers, only the crystal structure of the cyclic C-terminal swapped form has been solved. Biochemical studies suggested that the second, uncharacterized trimer may be a linear trimer in which one RNase A molecule swaps its N-terminal helix with a neighboring RNase A molecule at one end and its C-terminal strand at the other end. 95 In this kind of trimer, both types of exchange occur simultaneously at very distant sites in the same protein molecule, supporting the notion that the closed monomers may fully unfold and refold to form these various forms of domain-swapped oligomers.\n\nIn the cyclin-dependent kinase regulatory subunit Cks1, exchange of the last b strand, b 4 , is involved in dimer formation. 102 Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies indicate that b 4 in free monomeric Cks1 exhibits conformational heterogeneity. 103 This motion is abrogated by binding of Cdk2 to Cks1, resulting in a more homogeneous conformation of Cks1. Because Cdk2 binds to one face of the Cks1 b sheet, the flexibility of b 4 is reduced, preventing domain swapping. Interestingly, the binding of Cdk2 increases the binding affinity of Cks1 for phosphopeptides that bind to the other face of the b sheet. 103 Therefore, configurational entropy influences not only ligand binding of Cks1 but also domain swapping.\n\nA number of computational approaches for deciphering the basic events in protein folding and assembly are available that use reduced models and detailed atomistic simulations. Structures of RNase A. In the monomer, the two secondary structure elements involved in exchange are shown in blue and orange. In the dimers and trimers, the individual polypeptide chains are shown in green, blue, and orange, respectively. Hinge residues are shown with their side chains in stick representation and colored magenta.\n\nSwapped dimer Several groups are applying these methodologies to domain swapping. Movement of the polypeptide chain by Brownian motion through a funneled energy landscape with structure formation dominated by native stability 104 is the most elegant and widely accepted protein folding concept. This concept has also been applied to protein associations in domain-swapped multimers. In particular, Onuchic et al. 105 have used a symmetrized Go-type potential to simulate domain swapping in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. For the epidermal growth factor receptor kinase substrate 8 (Eps8) SH3 dimer, they discovered a frustrated hinge region and suggested the following most favorable path for domain swapping: native monomers-partially folded monomers-unfolded monomers-open-end domain-swapped dimers-domain-swapped dimers. Onuchic et al. suggested that the overall monomeric topology, rather than local signals in the hinge region, determines where in the polypeptide chain domain swapping will occur. 105 Although plausible, it appears at odds with some experimental results. For instance, in GB1 and LB1 (protein L B1 domain), proteins with identical monomeric topologies, different domain-swapped dimers are observed, clearly at odds with expectations if topology plays the dominant role. Proteins with intrinsic symmetry of the sequence and/or structure are 'highly frustrated' in the language of these authors, and in their simulations multimode domain swapping was observed and necessitated the inclusion of inter-or intramolecular disulfide bonds. 106 Two proteins that fall into the 'highly frustrated' category are the human prion protein (PrP C ) and CV-N. However, at least for CV-N, the presence of disulfide bonds is not necessary for domain swapping because several homologs of CV-N with varying numbers of disulfide bonds appear to lack domain swapping, 107, 108 and no differences in disulfides were noted for the monomers or domainswapped dimers. Coarse-grained MD simulations for several known domain-swapped proteins were also performed by Ding et al., 109 who found that starting from monomeric conformations, domain-swapped dimers sometimes formed. Based on native contact changes and topology maps, a web server for predicting the hinge region of domain-swapped proteins was created. 109 Testing the predictive value with the current set of 38 proteins resulted in correct predictions for only approximately one-third of the proteins in this set.\n\nAnalyzing large-scale domain motions of DT via Gaussian network models (GNM), Kundu and Jernigan 110 uncovered the major hinge in this protein based on the observed slower modes in GNM. The direction of the motion of the swapped domain about the hinge was predicted using the anisotropic network model. 110 However, it appears that DT is a special case among the domain-swapped proteins, given its multiple domain structure and the fact that a true folded domain undergoes the exchange and not single secondary structural elements.\n\nWe performed GNM analysis on the monomeric conformations of all 38 domain-swapped proteins in order to uncover any motions that may induce domain swapping. Initially, the domain-swapped structures were not used and were simply employed as controls in this analysis. For each protein, hinge residues were defined by comparing backbone dihedral angles for the experimentally determined monomer and dimer structures (dihedral angle changes 4601 at the open interface). The motional behavior for all residues via the first slow modes from GNM were examined. GNM did not successfully distinguish hinge residues for our diverse set of domain-swapped proteins. Investigating the behavior of every residue, we found that the hinge residues are neither the most mobile nor the most rigid ones in some proteins. For that matter, taking the picture of a hinge literally, the actual hinge usually stays fixed, with the two objects that are connected by the hinge changing their relative positions. This would translate to relative rigidity of hinge residues and mobility at the edge of the hinge. On the other hand, hinge residues are often located in loops that are naturally more mobile than the cores of proteins, thereby allowing conformational changes to occur more easily.\n\nA quite different mechanism of domain swapping that involves a progressive and reversible transformation between monomer and dimer has been proposed by Wodak's group. 111 This process starts from either end of the polypeptide chain, and intramolecular contacts are traded for equivalent intermolecular ones, with the total number of native contacts remaining essentially constant. In this manner, increasingly more of the monomer chains are substituted for each other until a stable state is reached. Exchange initiated at one end, such as the C terminus, and did not involve unfolding. Conformational changes within the individual monomers and the binding between them were tightly coupled, and the total number of native contacts was maximized. In this process, a large number of hinge conformations and association modes are sampled by the intermediates, suggesting that the exchange reaction is nonspecific and the amino acid sequence plays only a minor role. However, to date, there is no experimental evidence for such a mechanism, and it remains highly speculative.\n\nIs domain swapping an in vitro curiosity or does it serve a biological function? A number of results suggest that this type of oligomerization could be exploited in biology. One possible role for domain swapping could be to regulate protein function by modulating the populations of active molecules or the availability of functional sites. In addition, domain swapping could play a role in the allosteric regulation and signal transduction. Furthermore, in protein oligomerization scenarios, possible cytotoxic aggregation could be inhibited by domain-swapped dimerization. Finally, domain swapping is an efficient means for supramolecular structural organization of oligomers, such as seen in viral capsid structures. Therefore, although domain swapping may be involved in misfolding, aggregation, and amyloid formation of many proteins, 99, 112 this may not be the only function it serves. Next, several notable examples of domain-swapped proteins are discussed in more detail. These are not stringent examples as defined previously, and for the associated proteins, a stably folded monomeric structure may not be available.\n\nRNase A is the classic example of a protein engaged in domain swapping. Dimerization involving exchange of the N terminus was proposed in 1962 prior to any structural information by Crestfield, Stein, and Moore to explain its behavior under acidic conditions. 10 The first X-ray structure for a domainswapped RNase A dimer was solved in the late 1990s by Eisenberg, 34 and the Eisenberg laboratory subsequently identified more domain-swapped dimers, trimers, and multimers ( Figure 4) . 35, 95 Because of its versatility, RNase A is frequently portrayed as the prototypical domain-swapped protein, and with its different oligomeric states, it well illustrates the remarkable options of domain swapping modes. Different folding conditions result in different types of RNase A oligomerization. Dimers are found at pH 6.5 and 37 1C, close to the physiological conditions. However, the dissociation constant for the dimer under these conditions is about 2 mM, approximately 20-fold greater than the concentration of RNase A in the bovine pancreas. Polyethylene glycol 10 000 stabilizes the RNase A minor trimer under crystallization conditions at pH 3.5. 95 Interestingly, RNase A oligomers exhibit higher enzyme activity on double-strand RNA than the monomer, 113 and this is easily explained by the spatial arrangement of amino acids from different subunits that create the active site. Indeed, catalytic histidines are contributed by the N-terminal a helix and the C-terminal b strand, respectively. 114 In one of the trimer forms of RNase A, both N-and C-terminal units are exchanged, resulting in a linear arrangement. 95 In the other trimer that only exhibits swapping of the C-terminal strand, a cyclic structure is formed. Therefore, for proteins that can swap two different domains, a variety of assembled oligomeric structures can be formed, and models for such trimers, tetramers, and other oligomers have been proposed for RNase A. 115 Although wild-type RNase A does not form fibrils, a variant with a polyglutamine insertion in its hinge loop (RNase A Q 10 ) forms amyloids in vitro. 116 A model for the RNase A Q 10 fibrils was proposed in which the Q 10 -containing hinge loop residues form b strands that arrange into two b sheets. The individual domains in this model keep their native fold and are involved in 'runaway' domain swapping. 116 In addition to the linear-type arrangements, simultaneous exchange of two different domains allows the formation of branched aggregates, possibly explaining the observation of some nonfibrillar aggregates.\n\nGB1 is a small, 56-residue, stable, single domain protein. It comprises a four-stranded b sheet with a single a helix packed on top of it. 55 This protein exhibits astounding structural variability. A number of surprising structural variants were obtained in a large mutagenesis study involving a library of randomized hydrophobic core residues. Among the alternative structures was a domain-swapped dimer in which one hairpin was exchanged between the subunits. 56 The dimeric structure comprises an eight-stranded b sheet made from four adjacent hairpins, resulting in two extensive new interfaces ( Figure 5 ). The two a helices are antiparallel and cross at their C termini. Half of the dimer, composed of the first b hairpin and the a helix from one polypeptide chain and the second b hairpin from the other chain, is essentially identical to the monomer structure. The dimer dissociates into partially folded, monomeric species at low micromolar protein concentrations. The monomer is not a native, stable structure but, rather, a partially folded protein with extensive motions on the microto millisecond timescale. Despite these conformational fluctuations, the overall architecture of the monomer resembles that of wild-type GB1. Thus, for this variant, dimerization via domain swapping stabilizes the molten, monomeric hydrophobic core. 117 Structural comparison between the domain-swapped dimer and the wild-type monomer suggested that the F34 side chain was the pivot for the monomer-dimer switch. Indeed, changing this residue back to the wild-type alanine resulted in a wild-type-like monomer structure. Interestingly, changing A34 to phenylalanine in the wild-type sequence did not induce domain swapping but resulted in a side-by-side dimer. 118 GB1 variants are also capable of fibril formation, especially those sequences that are prone to domain swapping. Mutants that fold into the stable, wild-type GB1 structure or variants that exist as a highly destabilized, fluctuating ensemble of random, folded, and partially folded structures under the same experimental conditions do not easily fibrilize. A lefthanded helical ribbon model for the fibril was built, based on experimental disulfide cross-linking results, containing the swapped dimer structure as the smallest unit. 119 An additional amino acid change in the domain-swapped dimer core caused a further dramatic change in structure: A symmetric tetramer ensued with intermolecular strand exchange involving all four units. 120 Three b strands and the a helix were retained in the tetramer, although their intra-and intermolecular interactions were radically different, with strand b 2 of the first hairpin missing. The b 3 -b 4 hairpin was changed to a side-by-side arrangement of strands b 3 and b 4 from one subunit, running antiparallel to b 3 and b 4 of another one. This topological change was accompanied by a shift in register. In addition to strand exchange of the domain swapping kind, a new interface between surface elements of the individual chains was formed.\n\nLB1 exhibits the same fold as the GB1 monomer; 121 however, a quite different domain-swapped structure was found for its mutants ( Figure 5 ). Substitution of a glycine by alanine in the turn of the second b hairpin caused exchange of the C-terminal b strand between the subunits, with the wildtype hairpin straightening and creating the intermolecular b-sheet interface. These long b strands are kinked, causing both B1 units to be rotated around the hinge region. Exchange of valine to alanine in the hydrophobic core also resulted in this type of domain-swapped structure. 27 Interestingly, in the X-ray structure, the asymmetric unit contains two wild-typelike monomers and a domain-swapped dimer. Novel intermolecular hydrophobic contacts as well as intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the exchanged b strands contribute to the stability of the domain swap. 27 The previously described different oligomeric B1 structures are illuminating examples for structural evolutionary paths from monomers to multimers.\n\nCertain immunoglobulin isotypes of old (camels and dromedaries) or new (llamas and vicuna) world camelids comprise a single domain antibody, referred to as VHH, instead of the common four-domain Fab fragment. This VHH domain is generated via DNA recombination between dedicated VHH germline gene segments and D and J minigenes. All VH and VHH domains posses two cysteines that form a conserved disulfide bridge. The llama VHH sequence contains changes in four conserved amino acids, and its CDR1 (complementarity determining region 1) is two residues longer (nine amino acids) than the typical length of most VHHs. Its CDR2 contains seven residues, as seen in many camelid VHHs; however, its CDR3 is only six residues long, which is shorter than the average size of camel or llama CDR3s.\n\nThe X-ray structure of a llama VHH domain (VHH-R9) revealed the protein as a domain-swapped dimer (Figure 6) . 123 The first seven residues in the first b strand are missing, and CDR3 and the last strand exhibit domain swapping. An antiparallel b structure connects the two symmetry-related molecules, creating a dumbbell shape. Thus, one incomplete VHH monomer together with the last b strand from the other monomer forms the classical VHH structure. Because the VHH fold is conserved and no open interface is created in the domain-swapped VHH dimer, it is believed that CDR3 strain release and favorable interactions along the extended hinge may account for dimer stabilization.\n\nThe crystal contains an extended b sheet throughout the lattice, formed by trigonal structures that are arranged around the cubic threefold axis from N-and C-terminal segments of the chain. In this extended b-sheet structure, six VHH molecules are linked by a dense and large network of interstrand hydrogen bonds. In this manner, higher order oligomeric structures are stabilized. These extensive polymeric contacts are only possible because of the truncated N terminus.\n\nSeveral lectin structures were found to exhibit domain-swapped multimers. The first example was CV-N, originally isolated from an aqueous extract of the cyanobacterium Nostoc ellipsosporum. It inactivates human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other enveloped viruses. The original solution structure of the 101-amino acid protein was a monomeric one, 30 whereas in the subsequently determined X-ray structures, domainswapped dimers were found (Figure 7) . 31, 124 Either form predominates, depending on experimental conditions, and can be isolated for biophysical, structural, and functional studies. 92 The monomer structure exhibits a compact, bilobal fold with pseudo-symmetry. Interestingly, the amino acid sequence repeats of CV-N do not constitute the structural repeats. Rather, the two symmetrically related domains are formed by portions from both sequence repeats. Each domain comprises a triple-stranded b sheet with a b hairpin packed on top, connected by a helical linker. This linker becomes the hinge in the domain-swapped dimer. In the dimer structure, the two pseudo-monomer halves contain the same interactions as were seen in the monomer. Biophysical studies revealed that the domain-swapped dimer is a kinetically trapped folding intermediate that converts into the slightly more stable monomeric form at physiological (430 1C) temperatures. At low temperature (room temperature or lower), the dimer lifetime is sufficiently long for structural characterization in solution. 92 The solution dimer structure is virtually identical in interdomain packing and overall folding to the structures in the trigonal and tetragonal crystals; 31, 124 only the relative domain-domain orientations of the pseudomonomeric halves are distinct. In the solution dimer, hinge residues exhibit motions on the microsecond timescale, suggesting the possibility of reorientation around this hinge CV-N monomer CV-N swapped dimer GRFT swapped dimer \n\nOligomer Figure 6 Structures of llama VHH. In the monomer, exchanged elements are shown in blue. In the dimer, individual polypeptide chains are shown in green and blue, respectively. The monomer structure is derived from a homolog of the swapped dimer that shares 74% sequence identity. 122 Hinge residues are shown in magenta.\n\nwith different orientations being trapped in alternate crystal lattices. The coexistence of both monomeric and domain-swapped dimeric CV-N in solution indicates that the free energies of folding for both quaternary states must be comparable and the kinetic barrier between the states has to be significant. Mutation of residues in the hinge region allows for modulation of the relative stabilities. For instance, substituting the single proline in the hinge region by glycine resulted in a greater than 5 kcal mol \u00c01 stabilization of the monomeric P51G variant compared to wild type. The S52P mutant exists predominantly as a dimer due to destabilization of the monomer, and for the DQ50 deletion mutant, no folded monomer was found. 125 Interestingly, a mutant that was created to eliminate the sugar binding site in one of the domains, CVN mutDB , resulted in a protein that is monomeric in both solution and the crystal. 107 For this variant, no domain swapping was observed under all conditions, although in the crystal structures, two monomers were found in the asymmetric unit. Intriguingly, the protein-protein interface between the two monomers in the crystal resembles the open interface in one of the domainswapped dimer structures of wild-type CV-N. 107 The second antiviral lectin that exhibited domain swapping was Griffithsin (GRFT). 126 GRFT is a 121-amino acid protein of the red alga Griffithsia sp. It exhibits antiviral activity against HIV-1 and severe acute respiratory syndrome virus by binding to various viral glycoproteins (gp), such as gp120, gp41, and gp160, in a monosaccharide-dependent manner. 126, 127 The structure of GRFT closely resembles jacalin lectins and comprises three repeats of a four-stranded antiparallel b sheet. In the swapped dimer, the first two b strands of one chain complete the b prism of the other chain (Figure 7) . To date, GRFT is the only example of a jacalin-fold protein for which a domain-swapped structure has been observed. GRFT is also the only member in its fold family that contains three carbohydrate binding sites. Other jacalins usually have a single one. The prism structure of GRFT is encoded by its triple sequence repeat. The three sugar binding sites reside in the loops of the b hairpins formed by the second and third strand of each b sheet. 126 Another lectin, Microcystis viridis lectin, was also suggested to show a domain-swapped structure. However, because no monomeric structure is available, it is difficult to ascertain that indeed a domain swapping has occurred. 128 Although CV-N and GRFT undergo domain swapping, the extent of the exchanged sequence is quite different. In CV-N, half of the molecule is involved in the swap, whereas in GRFT only the first 2 b strands out of 12 are swapped. In addition, for CV-N, both monomeric and dimeric structures have been extensively characterized, whereas for GRFT only the dimeric structure is available.\n\nRegarding their anti-HIV activities, the previously discussed lectins interact with oligosaccharides on viral envelope glycoproteins. The GRFT dimer contains six sugar binding sites, whereas CV-N exhibits two (monomer) or four (dimer). Both proteins are highly potent and inhibit HIV-1 at nanomolar concentrations. 126, 129 The binding sites on CV-N interact with the terminal epitopes (D1 and D3 arms) of the large, branched oligosaccharides. For GRFT, a similar binding mode has been proposed. 126, 129 \n\nAmong all anti-HIV antibodies, very few neutralizing ones have been described. One of these is the human antibody 2G12, which neutralizes a broad range of HIV-1 isolates. It binds to a cluster of high-mannose sugars on the 'silent' face of the gp120 envelope glycoprotein. In the crystal structure of 2G12, two Fabs assembled into an interlocked dimer via domain swapping of their VH domains (Figure 8) . 130 Biochemical, biophysical, and mutagenesis data revealed that the productive form that recognizes glycosylated gp120 is indeed the swapped dimer. In the crystal structure of this antibody, the arrangement of the combining sites creates an extended surface for multivalent interaction with the carbohydrates. Such dimeric assembly has not been observed in any of the hundreds of Fab structures in the PDB. The VH domain exchange in 2G12 is associated with a twist of the variable regions relative to the constant region, although the individual variable (V H and V L ) and constant domains (C H1 and C L ) are very similar to those in other Fab molecules. The swapped dimer lacks the highly conserved 'ball-and-socket joint' between V H and C H1 that allows the variable domains to adjust their position relative to the constant domains, even though the required residues are present. The V H domains within the dimer are related by a noncrystallographic twofold axis (B1801), with the two Fabs arranged side by side. This conformation places the combining sites approximately 35 \u00c5 apart but facing in the same direction. Analysis of the Fab 2G12 structure suggests three causes for domain swapping in this case. First, the conserved interaction between adjacent glutamines in the V H and V L domains is missing at the closed V H /V L interface. These glutamines usually hydrogen bond to each other at the base of antibody combining sites. In 2G12, however, this position is occupied by a rarely observed arginine. Second, the elbow region connecting the V H and C H1 domains that forms the hinge loop comprises an unusual sequence. Therefore, the V H domain pivots around P113, stabilizing a hydrophobic contact between proline and valine that aids in domain swapping. Third, a favorable open interface is created between V H /V H domains through an extensive hydrogen bonding and salt bridge network, comprising a total of 10 hydrogen bonds and 136 van der Waals interactions, as well as p-stacking interactions between several aromatic residues that create a substantial buried area. 130 The neutralizing properties of the 2G12 antibody are intimately connected to domain exchange of the V H domains in the two Fab regions. The extensive multivalent binding surface created from two conventional combining sites therefore is able to recognize high-mannose sugars. In the 2G12 V H /V H interface, many conserved germline-encoded amino acids are found, including three uncommon mutations that stabilize this interaction. Although in principle, any IgG molecule could potentially recognize two oligomannose chains in a bivalent manner, this would require an energetically unfavorable near parallel orientation of the two Fab arms. In contrast, the 2G12 domain-exchanged structure is well suited for recognizing two oligomannose chains that are 35 \u00c5 apart through a virtually continuous protein surface that matches the geometrical spacing of the carbohydrate cluster on gp120.\n\nThe gag polyprotein is encoded by all retroviruses and directs the formation and release of immature viral particles. During virus budding, the gag precursor protein is cleaved into three products: matrix (MA), capsid (CA), and nucleocapsid (NC). Simultaneously with gag processing, termed maturation, the morphology of the viral particle changes dramatically. Different retroviruses exhibit morphologically distinct mature virions, characterized by the shape of their CA core structure. In HIV-1 and other lentiviruses, the mature capsid is conical, whereas it is spherical or polyhedral in HTLV-1 and MLV.\n\nLimited high-resolution structural information is available for the arrangement of CA proteins within the shell of immature or mature retroviral particles. However, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) studies of in vitro assemblies and highresolution studies of isolated CA fragments provide important clues. In general, the overall protein structure is highly conserved among retroviral CA proteins, comprising two independently folded domains -the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the C-terminal domain (CTD). Both domains of CA are predominantly a-helical, with the NTD comprising seven a helices and an amino-terminal b hairpin, whereas the CTD is composed of four short a helices and a single-turn 3 10 helix. Capsid assembly involves dimerization of the CTD, followed by assembly into polymeric forms.\n\nThe nature of the CTD dimerization interface has been the subject of considerable interest and debate. In early crystallographic studies, face-to-face dimerization was observed for the CTD. In the crystal dimer, the protein packs through helices 9 and 9 0 (notation for the entire CA structure), and changes in this interface can completely abolish CA dimerization in solution. Although mutations of residues in the crystal dimer interface have pronounced effects on viral assembly, they do not completely block it, and interface residues are not conserved in different retroviruses. Currently, several X-ray crystal structures and one NMR structure of the HIV-1 capsid CTD are available, and five possible arrangements of the CTD dimer have been observed. 76, [131] [132] [133] [134] All of these dimers exhibit different packing arrangements for helix 9 from each monomer, comprising distinct crossing angles. Interestingly, the dimer arrangement found in the solution NMR structure fits well into the cryo-EM density map of assembled capsid. 131 These observations indicate that conformational changes in the capsid protein are possible during assembly.\n\nSurprisingly, a deletion variant of the HIV-1 CA-CTD resulted in a domain-swapped structure in the crystal (Figure 9) . 75 This dimer, with an entirely new dimer interface, was found after the solution NMR structure of an evolutionary and structurally related SCAN domain had been determined. 135 The D177 CA-CTD deletion mutant exhibits essentially the same architecture as the SCAN dimer. The swapped unit comprises the N-terminal strand, a turn, and helix 1. The hinge for the domain swapping is located between helices 8 and 9, and the deleted A177 resided in this region. In addition to domain swapping, a second structural change occurs in helix 9, compared to the previously determined X-ray structures. In the original X-ray structures, helix 9 was kinked and resides at the crystallographic dimer interface, whereas in the domain-swapped dimer structure, helix 9 is a regular, straight helix.\n\nIn the full-length CA protein, the D177 mutation can assemble into core-like structures in vitro. However, there is little experimental evidence to support the domain-swapped model over the conventional side-by-side model of CA-CTD dimerization in the mature virions, especially given the excellent fit of the solution NMR CA-CTD structure into the electron density of the cryo-EM maps of assembled capsid tubes. 131 Thus, it is more likely that formation of the swapped dimer is predominantly caused by shortening of the hinge and that native capsid assembly involves a side-by-side dimer formation for the CTD.\n\nIn the rice yellow mottle virus (RYMV) from the Sobemoviridae family, the virus particle is a nearly spherical icosaheder, with small protrusions and depressions. The capsid consists of 180 copies of the 238-amino acid comprising coat protein, exhibiting T \u00bc 3 quasi-equivalency. Each asymmetric unit of the capsid contains three subunits (A-C), and the subunit structure is similar to the common eight-stranded jelly-roll b-sandwich fold of most icosahedral viruses. Subunit A is arranged into pentamers, and alternating subunits B and C form hexamers. The N-terminal 49 residues are not seen in subunits A and B, but 23 of them (residues 27-49) are visible in subunit C. They form an additional b strand, bA, that is tucked between a neighboring B subunit and another C subunit. As a result, the exchange of these bA strands via domain swapping creates long-range interactions between the subunits and most likely increases the stability of the RYMV capsid through intermolecular contacts. 136 \n\nMammalian prion proteins contain approximately 210 residues with one conserved disulfide bond. The monomer structure of the human PrP C has been determined in solution by NMR, and the domain-swapped dimer structure was solved by crystallography ( Figure 10) . 60, 137 The monomer is made of three a helices and a small two-stranded b sheet. The disulfide bond connects helices 2 and 3. In the domain-swapped dimer, the C-terminal helix is exchanged. Intriguingly, the nature of the disulfide bond between helices 2 and 3 is different in the monomer and dimer: In monomeric PrP C , it is intramolecular, whereas in the domain-swapped dimer it is intermolecular. For this reason, conversion from monomer to dimer cannot occur without reduction and reoxidation of the disulfide.\n\nFor the prion protein, it is possible to seed the conversion of 'normal' recombinant protein into amyloid fibrils in vitro through a specialized redox process. 138 This conversion process is proposed to proceed by runaway domain swapping, in which the hinge loop and adjacent regions of successive subunits form a continuous b sheet in the center of the fibril. In this model, the domain-swapped PrP C globular domains decorate the exterior of the b sheet, providing the characteristic templating features of prions. In the growing fibril, there are always two free helices with one cysteine each. They can potentially catalyze sulfhydryl-disulfide exchange on the fibril surface, opening a new PrP C monomer and readying it for addition to the growing fibril. However, whether the prion protein ever encounters a reducing environment in vivo is uncertain, and it appears that the intramolecular disulfide bond is required for infectivity.\n\nCystatins belong to a large superfamily of cysteine protease inhibitors. They generally contain 100-120 amino acids, and their fold is composed of a five-stranded b sheet and an a helix that is packed orthogonally onto the b strands. 42 The substrate binding sites of cystatins are highly conserved and located in b hairpin loops that connect strands 2 and 3 (site I) and 4 and 5 (site II), respectively. 139 Similar stable domain-swapped dimers have been seen for several members of the cystatin family at physiological concentrations. 42, 140, 141 In the swapped dimer, the first two b strands and the helix are exchanged, generating two antiparallel b strands around the hinge region ( Figure 11 ). In the monomer structure, this region comprises binding site I. As in most domain-swapped proteins, mutations in key positions promote or prevent domain swapping. For instance, in chicken cystatin, the I66Q core mutation increases the kinetics of dimerization from immeasurably slow to easily measurable, whereas other mutations at or near the hinge region (V55D or I102K) block dimerization. 42 Cystatin can also form amyloids, with cystatin amyloidosis involved in a number of diseases. 142 Crystal structures of cystatin tetramers and octamers have been solved, 143 as well as a larger oligomeric form. 140 In the latter crystal, two domain-swapped\n\nSwapped dimer Figure 10 Structures of PrP C .

Hinge residues and disulfide bonds are shown with their side chains in stick representation and colored magenta and yellow, respectively.\n\ndimers interact with each other and form a tetramer, with tetramer packing into higher order structures in which the b sheets of all dimers are perpendicular to a common axis. A similar model for fibrils involving the stacking of domain-swapped dimers was described previously for the GB1 amyloid fibrils. 119 \n\nGlyoxalase I (Glx I) catalyzes the reaction between methylglyoxal and glutathione, forming S-lactoylglutathione as the product. Human Glx I contains 183 amino acids, and in its monomeric form, it folds into two domains and an isolated N-terminal helix. Each domain is composed of a four-stranded b sheet flanked by two a helices. The active form of the enzyme is a dimer (Figure 12) , with the N-terminal domain of one monomer and the C-terminal domain of the other monomer arranged side by side in an eight-stranded b sheet. 144 The active site is located at the dimer interface at the center of the b sheet, comprising residues from the two different polypeptide chains.\n\nIn the dimer, the N-terminal helix is the exchanged element and packs against the body of the protein formed by other polypeptides. Sequence alignment of Glx I family members reveals that this N-terminal helix is missing in several members, indicating that it may not be strictly necessary for creating the active enzyme. It may, however, contribute to the stability of the Glx I dimer. It has also been suggested that in the dimer, the C-terminal domain is involved in domain swapping. 144 As with other such cases, given that no closed monomer structure is available to date, this cannot be verified. In the crystallographic dimer, one polypeptide chain does not comprise a complete active site and therefore may be inactive. However, in Pseudomonas putida Glx I (55% sequence identity to human Glx I), both the monomer and the dimer are active. 145 In addition, P. putida Glx I exhibits a monomer-dimer equilibrium in solution, with a less active monomer and a more active dimer. This monomer-dimer equilibrium could be regulated by glutathione 145 and is an example of how ligand binding can modulate a protein's quaternary state and function.\n\nThe protein forkhead box P2 (FOXP2) belongs to a newly defined subfamily, the P branch of the forkhead box transcription factors. Previous studies indicated that disease-causing mutations are located in the forkhead domains of FOXP proteins. [146] [147] [148] [149] This domain is the signature feature of FOX family members and is responsible for DNA binding. The forkhead domain of FOXP2 contains 93 amino acids and exhibits two monomers and two domain-swapped dimers in the same crystal asymmetric unit, with two bound double-stranded DNA segments (Figure 13 ). 20 The monomeric form is composed mainly of three stacked a helices and a threestranded antiparallel b sheet, which caps the structure at one end. In the domain-swapped structure, the third helix and the second and third strands are exchanged. Interestingly, the third helix is the DNA recognition motif in both the monomeric and the domain-swapped dimeric structure. The hinge region of the domain-swapped dimer contains an alanine that is conserved in the FOXP subfamily but replaced by a proline in other POX family members. Mutation of alanine to proline in the forkhead domain of FOXP2 abrogates the formation of a swapped dimer, indicating its pivotal role in the monomer-dimer switch. Moreover, some disease-causing mutations also map to the dimer interface. A model for the domain-swapped FOXP2 dimer bound to two separated DNA recognition elements suggests that for FOXP2, domain swapping may help in the assembly of high-order DNA-protein complexes. 20 \n\nThe trp repressor (trpR) binds the operator region of the trp operon and prevents the initiation of transcription. Its smallest functional unit is a dimer, 150 although tetrameric and higher order species are also observed. 151, 152 Under extreme conditions (30% isopropanol), an infinite crystalline 3-D supramolecular array was found, 24 possibly involving domain swapping.\n\nWhether or not the trpR dimer constitutes a true domainswapped case is unclear because a highly intertwined structure was observed and no monomeric homolog is available. Each single polypeptide chain in trpR dimer is composed of six a helices (A-F) in a relative closed conformation ( Figure 14(a) ). 23 In the crystalwide assembly, helices C-E rearrange and form a very long, single helix, resulting in polypeptide termini that are separated by a large distance (Figure 14(b) ). Two such dimers come together and create a substructure (half of the tetramer) very similar to that seen in the dimer (Figure 14(c) ). Therefore, the dimer-like structure is formed by segments of four different polypeptide chains, two providing intertwined N-terminal regions and two providing C-terminal regions, 24 with the polymer constituting a branched aggregate rather than a daisy chain-type linear one. Given that the polymeric form was crystallized in the presence of a significant amount of alcohol, its relevance to any physiological state is unclear. Indeed, it is well-known that alcohols increase the helical content of flexible peptides and/or destabilize tertiary structures significantly. 24, 153, 154 \n\nA number of human diseases are associated with 'serpinopathies,' which are deposition disorders of a large and diverse family of protease inhibitors, the serpin. 155 Serpins are relatively large proteins, with approximately 330-500 amino acids per chain. Their structures are composed of three b sheets and eight or nine a helices. During approximately the past 25 years, a number of studies have revealed that inhibitory serpins can undergo dramatic conformational changes. The reactive center loop (RCL) region of these proteins can insert itself as an additional b strand (b 4 ) into the central b sheet, either after peptide bond cleavage or spontaneously.\n\nSwapped dimer\n\nCoexistence of monomer and dimer in the crystal Model of the swapped dimer bound to two separated DNA elements Figure 13 Structures of forkhead domain of FOXP2. In the monomer, exchanged elements are shown in blue. In the dimer, different polypeptide chains are shown in green and blue, respectively. Hinge residues are shown with their side chains in stick representation and colored magenta. A mutant antithrombin shows a surprising twist to this story: In its domain-swapped dimer structure, one monomer donates a long b hairpin to another monomer, inserting it into the middle of the principal b sheet. In the polymer and the cleaved serpin, these two b strands constitute the RCL, forming the b 4 strand, as well as its neighboring b 5 strand (Figure 15(a) ). 33 Based on this unusual structure, Yamasaki et al. proposed that such b hairpin insertion across several molecules may create a highly stable polymer. 33 In fact, the crystal structure of a linear polymer of a 1 -antitrypsin, another human serpin, supports this notion (Figure 15(b) ). 156 Such oligomerization of serpin polymers explains their rapid propagation and extreme stability. In addition, serpins constitute excellent examples for irreversible b sheet expansion in protein deposition diseases.\n\nThe HasA protein is used by pathogenic bacteria to acquire the host's iron from either free heme or heme-containing hemoglobin. The secreted protein binds heme in a 1:1 stoichiometry and transfers it its receptor HasR, which in turn releases it into the bacterium. 157 Serratia marcescens HasA is a 19-kDa protein whose monomer structure is composed of seven b strands arranged into a central six-stranded antiparallel b sheet with a high degree of curvature. Four a helices are packed on one side against this sheet, whereas a loop connecting strands b 5 and b 6 covers its hydrophobic other side. Two small 3 10 helices connect strand b 7 to helix a 2 . The heme is held in a relatively solvent-exposed environment by two loops, one of which connects helix a 1 to strand b 2 and the other connects strands b 4 and b 5 at the interface of the predominately a and b regions of the molecule. 158 In addition to the monomeric variant, a HasA dimer (DHasA) is also secreted in vivo, and its crystal structure revealed a domain-swapped dimer. The pseudo-monomeric portion of the structure is very similar to the isolated monomer structure (Figure 16 ). However, it appears to be less flexible, and the region around the heme binding pocket is almost inaccessible in the dimer. 61 DHasA is not capable of transferring the heme to HasR because the appropriate productive HasA-HasR complex cannot be formed. Indeed, the regions involved in the interaction between HasA and HasR 159 become partially inaccessible by dimerization in DHasA. However, the heme can be transferred from DHasA to a HasA monomer. 61 Therefore, DHasA was proposed to constitute a heme reservoir, keeping it available for use by the Has system. 61 \n\nDuring the past several decades, increasingly more domainswapped protein structures have become available, and at least in some cases, there is evidence in support of the dimer or multimer constituting biologically important species. Indeed, irrespective of whether domain swapping is a specific mechanism for regulating function in vivo, it is becoming clear that it is not solely an in vitro artifact.\n\nDespite considerable efforts by numerous groups, no unifying molecular mechanism of domain swapping has emerged: Each protein seemingly behaves in a distinctive and individual manner, and a general explanation for how proteins exchange domains remains elusive. What seems to emerge is that domain swapping is closely associated with the unfolding/folding process of proteins. For some proteins, distinct intermediates -in which some hydrophobic part of the monomeric protein becomes exposed and, thereby, is available for interaction with a 'like' molecule -may play a role, whereas for others, complete unfolding may occur. The fact that high protein concentration and additives (always present during crystallization) promote domain swapping suggests a switch in solute-solvent interaction. For example, exposed hydrophobic regions may no longer undergo unfavorable interactions with the aqueous solvent but, rather, favorable ones with another polypeptide chain. In this manner, an oligomeric structure can be trapped in either a crystal or an aggregate. Such behavior may also occur in vivo under conditions in which monomer promoting factors are missing or high local protein concentrations are induced through compartmentalization or the action of protein-protein interaction modules.\n\nA more thorough understanding of the underlying features associated with domain swapping is certainly desirable. On the one hand, domain swapping seems to be a means by which stable multimers can be generated under evolutionary pressure, and it provides ways to improve protein stability. On the other hand, the fact that increasingly more proteins that exhibit disease-related aggregation can also form domainswapped structures suggests a possible involvement in protein deposition diseases. Therefore, it may be possible to suppress\n\nSwapped dimer Figure 16 Structures of hemophore HasA. In the monomer, exchanged elements are shown in blue.
