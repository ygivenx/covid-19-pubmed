{"title": "Journal Pre-proof Skin damage among healthcare workers managing coronavirus disease-2019", "body": ").\n\nThere are several limitations to our study. Firstly, we only studied one site with a single exposure factor, but some sites could be related to more than one factor. For example, nasal bridge could be oppressed by N95 mask and goggles simultaneously, though goggles were the main factor. Secondly, possible risk factors like N95 mask-wearing after work in participants' daily life were not included.\n\nIn conclusion, our study demonstrated that the prevalence of skin damages of first-line healthcare workers was very high. Moreover, we found that longer exposure time was a significant risk factor, which highlights that the working time of first-line staff should be arranged reasonably. Besides, prophylactic dressings could be considered to alleviate the device-related pressure injuries, according to a prior study 5 .\n\nWe would like to thank Xiaoxu Yin from school of public health of Tongji Medical\n\nCollege for his suggestions about this paper, and the healthcare workers participated in our study for their support of this paper. Especially, we want to express our deep respect to all first-line healthcare workers for their dedication in the fight against COVID-19.\n\nCoronavirus Diesease-2019: COVID-19\n\nFever Clinic: FC Isolation Wards: IW "}
