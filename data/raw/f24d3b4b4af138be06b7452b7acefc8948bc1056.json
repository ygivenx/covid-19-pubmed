{"title": "Beware of asymptomatic transmission: Study on 2019-nCoV prevention and control measures based on extended SEIR model", "body": "The 2019 new coronavirus, \"2019-nCoV\", was discovered from Wuhan Viral Pneumonia cases in December 2019, and was named by the World Health Organization on January 12, 2020. In the early stage, people knows little about the 2019-nCoV virus was not clear, and the spread period was encountering China's annual spring migration, which made the epidemic spread rapidly from Wuhan to almost all provinces in China.\n\nAs of 20:30 on January 27, 2020, 2844 cases were confirmed nationwide, 5794 were suspected, 58 were cured, and 81 died. Such a major epidemic is a serious challenge to people's lives and an important test of public health emergency management capabilities.\n\nIn recent days, domestic and foreign scholars have published research results about new coronaviruses online, and some of them are non-medical scholars who use mathematics and computer technology to simulate and predict disease transmission. Scholars from the field of public health present a timely evaluation of the Chinese 2019-nCov epidemic in its initial phase [1] . Different from the existing studies, this study taking into account the new characteristics of new coronaviruses and the current epidemic prevention and control measures in China, and constructing a SEIRD model that considers the movement of people across regions. The purpose of this study is to reveal the role of the three most important current measures to control the spread of the epidemic, such as quarantine of infected persons, reduction of human mobility, and improvement of treatment.\n\nThe warehouse model was proposed by Kermack and McKendrick in 1927. According to the characteristics of actual transmission behavior, there can be multiple states of an individual. The two most basic states are Susceptible (S) and Infected (Infected, I).\n\nAccording to the types of individual states included in the model, classic warehouse models such as SI model [2] , SIS model [3] , SIR model [4] , and SEIR model [5] . The SI model is a basic model, and other warehouse models are derived models built according . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

The SEIR model considers Exposed, that is, vulnerable individuals are infected, but they cannot infect other vulnerable individuals within a certain incubation period.\n\nOn the basis of the SIR model, considering that 2019-nCoV is an infectious disease with a latent period, the E (Exposed) state and D (Death) state are added to construct the SEIRD propagation model. The schematic diagram of the SEIRD propagation model is shown in figure 1 . The members in this model mainly have the following four conversion methods.\n\n\uf06c First, S \u2192 E. Relevant evidence shows that during the 2019-nCoV infection process, not only confirmed patients have infectious capacity, but also those asymptomatic transmission individuals also have the ability to infect others. Therefore, in the SEIRD model, the susceptible status (S) will change to a Exposed status (E) with a certain probability after contacting the infected individual (I) or the Exposed individual (E).\n\n\uf06c Second, E \u2192 I. Relevant evidence shows that the longest incubation period for 2019-nCoV is 14 days and the shortest is 1 day. The Exposed status (E) may be transformed into an infected status (I) after the incubation period.\n\n\uf06c Third, I \u2192 R. The infected individual (I) will be isolated and treated with a certain probability in hospital and will change to the R status.

Suppose there are NU members in a twodimensional space. In the initial stage, NU members are randomly and uniformly distributed in NC * NC communities (also can be understood as cities), that is, each community has NU / (NC * NC) people. For members located in the two-dimensional space, each time step (which can be understood as daily) moves to the neighbor community with a probability of M (u, t). Therefore, for individuals in different Table 1 . \n\nIn this study, the isolation measures refer to that from the time of publication TI, individuals in I-status stop moving and are isolated and treated by the hospital. It can be found that with the isolation measures implemented at four time points, the Estatus user changes are not obvious. The possible reason is that this isolation is only implemented for I-status users, but one of the characteristics of 2019-nCoV is that not only I-status is contagious, but E-status is also contagious. Although the I-status is being treated in isolation, there are still many members of the E-status in the incubation period.\n\nThese members make the disease likely to continue to spread. This explains that the . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

These individuals may have changed to the E-status because they had been in the same space with the I-status individuals.\n\nIt can be found that with the implementation of isolation measures at four time points, the I-status user has changed significantly. The change is reflected in that the sooner the isolation measures are implemented, the lower the proportion of I-status users remains, and the shorter the time it takes for the proportion of I-status users to decrease to zero.\n\nFor example, the peak value of I-status personnel is 10% at TI = 10, and the peak value of I-status personnel is 95% at TI = 40 and decreases to 0 at t = 45. .

It can be found that the implementation of population mobility control at two points in time, and the difference in the degree of population mobility control, the proportion of I-status users has changed significantly. A conclusion similar to that of the E-status is obtained, that is, in order to reduce the proportion of the I-status users, measures to reduce population mobility should be implemented as soon as possible. .

When t = 50, compared with the lowmeasure group (the percentage of D-status in almost all communities exceeds 50%), the range of the D-status ratio in the high-measure group is [0.5-1]. Areas above 100% (gray) appear at t = 50, which is because the random flow of people makes the number of people in some communities higher than the initial stage. This result further validates that \"the sooner, the higher the degree of implementation of the measures to reduce the movement of people, the better the effect of controlling the spread of the epidemic.\" This study further validates the concerns of international and domestic experts regarding asymptomatic transmission (ie, E-status in this article). This article suggests that as long as medical resources are available, E-status individuals or potential E-status individuals should be included in the scope of isolation and treatment. The government should promptly release information on the epidemic situation, as well as information on the areas and vehicles used by the infected people, to further encourage those who have been in contact with individuals in the I or E-status to go to nearby hospitals for timely inspection."}
