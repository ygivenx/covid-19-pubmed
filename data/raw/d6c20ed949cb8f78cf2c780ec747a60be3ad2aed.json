In a phylogenetic analysis, the FCoVs sampled from cat H324 cluster and, with the exception of FCoV sampled from cat H326, are more closely related to each other than to the FCoVs sampled from other cats. Given the overall genetic diversity in this region of the S gene among the FCoVs in the cattery, these findings support our conclusion that cats H419 and H324 carried an asymptomatic chronic FCoV infection and argue against accidental reinfections during the isolation period.\n\nCoronavirus epidemiology, persistence, and evolution were studied in a closed cat-breeding facility with an endemic FCoV infection. Serological and genetic analysis (Fig. 8 ) revealed that the virus involved was a serotype I strain, closely related to the FCoV isolate Dahlberg (Fig.  5B ). An initial survey showed that 86% of the cats had an ongoing FCoV infection, as demonstrated by RT-PCR detection of viral RNA in feces and/or plasma. When tested 100 days later, four of five cats that had previously been identified as virus shedders still had detectable viral RNA in the feces. One explanation was that the cats in the breeding facility were subject to frequent reinfections. Alternatively, as previously speculated by us and others Addie and Jarrett, 1992; Herrewegh et al., 1995; de Groot and Horzinek, 1995) , FCoV may cause chronic infections resulting in prolonged virus shedding. We now provide the first direct evidence for FCoV persistence. By placing cats in strict isolation and by comparative sequence analysis of excreted virus, it was shown that naturally infected asymptomatic cats may remain infected and shed FCoV in their feces for at least 7 months.\n\nThrough the use of a highly sensitive RT-nPCR targeted to the 3 NTR , FCoV RNA was detected in several tissues of the chronically inscattered throughout the gene segment but rather ocfected cat H324.
