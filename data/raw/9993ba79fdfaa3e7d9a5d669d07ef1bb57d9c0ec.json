{"title": "Neither B cells nor T cells are required for CNS demyelination in mice persistently infected with MHV-A59", "body": "Murine hepatitis virus (MHV) A59 is a coronavirus, which can cause acute hepatitis and encephalitis. After viral clearance, the encephalitis develops into central nervous system (CNS) demyelination (Lavi et al, 1984a; Sutherland et al, 1997) . Demyelination can rst be detected 6 days postinfection (d.p.i.) as very small lesions in the presence of an active infection. Large demyelinating lesions develop by 20 d.p.i. and peak around 30 d.p.i., at which time points infectious virus is undetectable although viral RNA is still present (Lavi et al, 1984b; Das Sarma et al, 2000) . The demyelination is histologically similar to that seen in humans with multiple sclerosis (MS) (Lampert et al, 1973; Herndon et al, 1977; Jordan et al, 1989; Lucchinetti et al, 1996; Barac-Latas et al, 1997; Lucchinetti et al, 2000) .\n\nThe mechanism of demyelination after MHV infection is currently unclear, although both macrophages and T cells have been implicated as mediators of pathology (Wu and Perlman, 1999; Wu et al, 2000) . Lymphocyte-de cient SCID, RAG knockout, and irradiated mice infected with MHV-JHM rarely have even small lesions 7 to 15 d.p.i., despite high levels of virus (Wang et al, 1990; Fleming et al, 1993; Houtman and Fleming, 1996; Wu et al, 2000) . These data suggest that lymphocytes are required for robust acute demyelination. A recent reconstitution study suggests that CD4 C or CD8 C T cells can mediate MHV-JHMinduced demyelination . However, in nude mice that lack CD4 C and CD8 C T cells, demyelination still occurs . If T cells are not absolutely required for demyelination, the question remains whether B cells, the other major lymphocyte population, are important effectors in the mechanism of demyelination. Antibody production by B cells is implicated in CNS demyelination in other models of demyelination (Schluesener et al, 1987; Mastaglia et al, 1989; Ozawa et al, 1989; Lucchinetti et al, 2000) .\n\nTo determine whether B cells are required for MHV-A59 induced CNS demyelination, we infected 4-week-old, female B-cell-de cient mice (muMT, Jackson Laboratories) on a C57BL/6 genetic background with 50 p.f.u. MHV-A59 intracerebrall y (i.c.) in 20 \u00b9l. Demyelination was assessed in luxol fast blue-stained transverse sections by quantifying either the percent of spinal cord quadrants containing lesions or by a visual assessment of the area of white matter involved in demyelinating lesions (the scale was as follows: 1-only very small lesions detected, no larger than areas of perivascular cuffing; 2-obvious discrete lesions involving more area than in 1 and less than in 3; 3-total lesions occupy 25%-50% of the white matter in a transverse section; 4-total lesions occupy more than 50% of the white matter). By either assessment, demyelination occurs robustly in the absence of B cells (Figure 1 ). Initial demyelination was very similar to that observed in parental C57BL/6 mice. At 30 and 60 days postinfection (d.p.i.) CNS demyelination was actually signi cantly more severe in B-cell-de cient mice than in parental mice ( Figure 1 ). However, we have shown that infectious virus persists until at least 60 d.p.i. in the CNS of the muMT mice (Matthews et al, 2001) . Therefore, while the increased severity and prolonged presence of demyelinating lesions could be due to the absence of some protective mediating effect of B cells, it could also be due to direct pathologic effects of the persistent virus.\n\nTo answer the question of whether MHV-A59 can directly mediate CNS demyelination, we infected RAG-1 \u00a1=\u00a1 mice on the C57BL/6 background (B6.129S7-Rag1 tm1Mom from Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine). These mice are unable to develop mature B cells and T cells. Normally, MHV-A59 infection of RAG-1 \u00a1=\u00a1 mice results in death within 15 days of infection (n D 5). In one RAG-1 \u00a1=\u00a1 mouse, which was evaluated after death at 11 d.p.i., 25% quadrant demyelination was observed, although the lesions were small as would also be the case at 11 d.p.i. in a parental C57BL/6 mouse (data not shown). To enable the mice to survive to the point of maximum demyelination (20-30 d.p.i.), we treated them at the time of infection with a single dose of mouse hyperimmune serum (HIS) injected intraperitoneall y (i.p.). HIS was raised in C57BL/6 mice against MHV-A59 and was partially puri ed by 45% ammonium sulfate precipitation and dialysis against PBS. The neutralizing titer (NT) of HIS was determined by incubating serial dilutions of serum antibody with 500 p.f.u./ml A59 in DME-10 for 30 minutes at 37 \u00b1 C. NT50 was calculated as the dilution at which plaque numbers were reduced by 50%. For protection, 1 ml of HIS (NT50 of 1:5000, equivalent to the neutralizing activity found in 1 mouse 3 weeks after i.p. infection) was injected i.p. at the time of infection. Treatment with HIS enabled the mice to survive to 25 d.p.i. or later without actually clearing the virus. Antibody treatment at the time of infection has been previously shown to improve survival (Buchmeier et al, 1984) .\n\nAntibody protected, MHV-A59-infected female RAG-1 \u00a1=\u00a1 mice had high titers of virus in the CNS at 22-33 d.p.i. (Table 1) . When sections were stained with luxol fast blue to detect demyelinating lesions, discrete areas of white matter lacking blue Figure 1 CNS demyelination in the absence of B lymphocytes. 4-week-old parental C57BL/6 and B-cell-de cient muMT mice were infected with 50 p.f.u. MHV-A59 i.c. At various time points after infection, mice were killed, and their spinal cords xed in formalin. Each spinal cord was cut into six transverse sections, and these sections were assessed for demyelinating lesions using luxol fast blue. In (A), demyelinating lesions were quanti ed as the percentage of spinal cord quadrants of the total number containing lesions. In (B), the proportion of the white matter which consisted of lesion was determined using a visual assessment scale. These data were compiled from three separate experiments. Astericks mark time points at which a signi cant difference was detected between the two populations by t-test analysis. Error bars represent SEM. stain were detected (Figure 2A -D). Quanti cation of these demyelinating lesions demonstrated that antibody protected RAG1 \u00a1=\u00a1 , C57BL/6, and splenocytereconstituted RAG1 \u00a1=\u00a1 mice had similar levels of demyelination (Table 1) . To determine more precisely the nature of these lesions, spinal cords were embedded in Epon and sections were stained with toluidine blue. Compared to normal tissue ( Figure 3A) , lesions revealed active primary demyelination characterized by ballooning myelin sheaths around intact axons ( Figure 3B , C). The presence of naked axons in some of these lesions ( Figure 3D , E) is also indicative of primary demyelination. In addition to the lesions characterize d by primary demyelination, there were also multiple small round lesions characterize d by necrosis that were found predominantly in the white matter but also less frequently in the grey matter (average of 8:71 \u00a7 8:06 necrotic lesions in white matter in six of seven mice, 2:14 \u00a7 2:91 necrotic lesions in the grey matter in three of seven mice). Acute necrosis has been reported in mice infected with MHV-JHM early after infection (Jordan et al, 1989) , but is very rare in chronic demyelination in parental C57BL/6 mice.\n\nTo determine whether the demyelination was associated with viral replication and to address the question of whether antibody exacerbates lesion formation, we controlled viral loads by injecting 200 \u00b9l of HIS (NT50 of 1:5000), age-matched naive serum, or sterile PBS i.p. at 13, 15, 17, and 19 days postinfection. Such treatment was previously used successfully to clear or control infectious virus in parental C57BL/6 mice (Matthews et al, 2001) . However, although viral titers were signi cantly reduced ( P D 0:005 by t-test), virus was still present at fairly high titers (10 3:6 pfu/g in antibody treated RAG1 \u00a1=\u00a1 mice versus 10 5:3 in untreated RAG1 \u00a1=\u00a1 mice). The severity of demyelination was not signi cantly affected as detected by percent quadrants demyelinating (48.0% \u00a7 21.6 in antibody treated RAG1 \u00a1=\u00a1 mice (n D 4) versus 60.7% \u00a7 8.1 in untreated RAG1 \u00a1=\u00a1 mice (n D 3)) or surface area involved (1:6 \u00a7 0:42 in antibody treated RAG1 \u00a1=\u00a1 mice versus 1:6 \u00a7 0:29 in untreated RAG1 \u00a1=\u00a1 mice). Although these data did not allow us to con rm that the demyelinating lesions in RAG1 \u00a1=\u00a1 mice are due to persistent infectious virus, they did demonstrate that additional antibody does not exacerbate lesion formation.\n\nToluidine blue staining of plastic embedded MHV-A59-infected parental C57BL/6 and RAG1 \u00a1=\u00a1 mouse spinal cord sections. RAG1 \u00a1=\u00a1 and C57BL/6 mouse spinal cords were collected 27 days postinfection and embedded in plastic. Toluidine blue was utilized to stain the myelin sheaths. A normal region of myelinated axons in the spinal cord of a C57BL/6 mouse is shown in (A). Myelin sheaths can be observed ballooning away from the axon in a C57BL/6 mouse (B) and in a RAG1 \u00a1=\u00a1 mouse (C). Naked axons, the sign of a successfu l primary demyelination, are present in both C57BL/6 (D) and RAG1 \u00a1=\u00a1 mice (E) and are indicated by arrows. In (B-E), the absence of signi cant numbers of normal myelinated axons, the presence of ballooning myelin sheaths, and the invasion of large macrophages creates the impression that a higher magni cation was used than in (A). The original magni cation for all ve images was 1400\u00a3.\n\nIn contrast to our results in RAG1 \u00a1=\u00a1 mice, studies in which RAG1 \u00a1=\u00a1 (Wu and Perlman, 1999) or SCID immunode cient mice were infected with MHV-JHM revealed little to no demyelination even when adoptive transfer of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies was used to ensure survival to 30-40 days p.i. (Wu and Perlman, 1999) . In our studies, polyclonal antibodies from MHV-A59 immune serum were used to control the initial viral infection and thus it is possible that this could contribute to the following disease. However, the half-life of MHV-speci c monoclonal antibodies in uninfected mice has been determined to be between 8 and 13 days . Antibody in the presence of its antigen should have an even higher turnover rate. Therefore, it is unlikely that much antibody persists after acute infection. Also, transferring additional antibody during days 13-20 after infection of RAG1 \u00a1=\u00a1 mice did not result in any increase in demyelination, suggesting that antibody does not exacerbate lesions as it does in some models of EAE (Linington and Lassmann, 1987; Schluesener et al, 1987; Litzenburger et al, 1998) . In MHV-JHM-infected mice, antibody treatment at injection resulted in mice that developed symptoms but not detectable demyelination 23-47 d.p.i. (Wu and Perlman, 1999) . Therefore, we suggest that the presence of antibody at the time of infection was not responsible for the presence of demyelination seen in our experiments with RAG1 \u00a1=\u00a1 mice.\n\nAnother possibility is that MHV strain A59 stimulates much more robust CNS demyelination in the absence of T and B cells than does MHV strain JHM. The presence of occasional demyelinating lesions in MHV-JHM-infected immunode cient mice, though rare, suggests that this difference is quantitative rather than qualitative Wu et al, 2000) .\n\nIn B-cell-de cient mice, the persistence of infectious virus that can directly cause demyelination, makes it dif cult to attribute the demyelinating effect observed to a lack of antibodies in these mice. We attempted to circumvent this problem by testing downstream mechanisms of antibody activity using transgenic mice lacking some of the pathways through which antibody normally mediates its function. Speci cally, antibody can lyse infected cells or destroy virus by (1) activating the complement pathyway; (2) inducing antibody-dependen t cell cytotoxitiy (ADCC); or (3) serving as a signal for phagocytosis. Complement activation has been implicated as the mechanism through which antibodies mediate demyelination in other models of demyelination (Linington et al, 1989; Ozawa et al, 1989; Piddlesden et al, 1993) and in MS (Lucchinetti et al, 2000) , and therefore was a pathway of particular interest. In addition, recent work has demonstrated that antibody can enhance macrophage phagocytosis of myelin in vitro (Van der Goes et al, 1999) , suggesting that FcR and opsonization could be crucial for macrophage mediated demyelination.\n\nThe C3-de cient mouse (backcrossed 10 generations onto C57BL/6 and kindly donated by Dr John Lambris with the permission of Harvey Colten (Circolo et al, 1999) does not express complement 3 protein and therefore cannot activate its complement pathway. The Fc\u00b0R subchain-de cient mouse (C57BL/6 background; C57BL/6JMTac-[KO]Fc\"r1\u00b0,Taconic) lacks Fc\u00b0R-I and III and therefore lacks ADCC. This strain also lacks opsonization in vitro, even that mediated by Fc\u00b0R-II. The FcR double knockout (DKO) (only available on C57BL/6 \u00a3 129 background; (C57BL/6 \u00a3 129)-[KO]Fc\"r1\u00b0-[KO]Fc\u00b0R2, Taconic) also lacks the other IgG receptor, Fc\u00b0R-II, and therefore is incapable of opsonizing antibody coated cells or virus. We rst tested these mice for viral clearance and determined that at 30 d.p.i. virus is cleared from brain and liver in all 3 strains (n D 6-10 mice per group). Therefore, unlike the situation in the B-cell-de cient mice, there is no confounding factor of viral persistence in the C3-and FcR-de cient mice. Demyelinatio n was assessed by luxol fast blue staining. All three strains of mice exhibited obvious demyelinating lesions. When demyelination was quanti ed, there was no statistically signi cant difference in demyelination in any group compared to parental C57BL/6 mice ( Table 2 ). Even though demyelination in the FcR DKO mice appears lower than in wild-type mice this is not a statistically signi cant difference ( P D 0:1113 for percent quadrants demyelinating, P D 0:056 for surface area involved). Therefore, neither complement activation , ADCC, nor opsonization are required for MHV-A59-induced demyelination.\n\nThe prolonged persistence of demyelinating lesions in B-cell-de cient mice (Figure 1) suggests that healing by remyelination may be impaired. Studies in infectious, autoimmune, and toxic models of CNS demyelination have demonstrated the intriguing nding that passive transfer of IgM antibodies speci c for various antibodies can promote remyelination (Rodriguez, 1991; Miller et al, 1994; van Engelen et al, 1994; Miller et al, 1997; Pavelko et al, 1998) . To directly assess whether remyelination occurs in the absence of antibody, we embedded spinal cords from B-cell-de cient mice in Epon to preserve myelin sheath structure and stained with toluidine blue at various times following infection with MHV-A59. Remyelination was de ned as regions where the axons have thin myelin sheaths as compared to the predominant myelin sheath thickness of other axons of similar diameter.\n\nOf two B-cell-de cient mice tested at each time point, both mice demonstrated remyelination 60 d.p.i., yet no mice demonstrated remyelination 30 d.p.i. or 94-103 d.p.i. (Figure 4) . C57BL/6 mice demonstrated remyelination at all time points. These data show that antibody is not absolutely required for remyelination. In the absence of antibody, remyelination is less frequently observed, but the persistence of infectious virus may also be affecting the development of remyelination.\n\nWe assessed a larger number of mice 60 d.p.i. and speci cally chose mice with high viral titers to determine whether remyelination occurred in the Figure 4 Remyelination in C57BL/6 and B-cell-de cient mice. Parental C57BL/6 and B-cell-de cient muMT mice were infected with 50 p.f.u. i.c. at 4 weeks of age. At 60 days postinfection, spinal cords were collected and embedded in plastic. Remyelination, which is characterize d by myelin sheaths that are thin relative to axonal diameter as indicated by the arrows, is detectable in both C57BL/6 mice (A) and in muMT mice (B). Magni cation is \u00a31200.\n\npresence of concurrent viral replication . In muMT mice with viral titers between 10 3:1 and 10 5:6 , remyelination was detected in ve of ve mice. Similarly, in C57BL/6 mice, none of whom had detectable viral titers 60 d.p.i., remyelination was detected in four of four mice. When the total number of remyelinating lesions was quantitated, no signi cant difference was detected (an average of 3.8 remyelinating lesions in muMT mice, 5.5 in C57BL/6 mice, P D 0:2148). Although it would be ideal to carefully measure and compare the areas of white matter involved in remyelination versus demyelination, muMT mice maintain active demyelination at 60 d.p.i. and have markedly more demyelination than C57BL/6 mice at this time point, frustrating such a comparison. We conclude from the previous data that persistent infectious MHV is not suf cient to inhibit CNS remyelination, nor does remyelination decrease markedly in the absence of antibody, although the onset of remyelination may be delayed.\n\nIf, as our data and the data of others suggest, neither \u00ae\u00afT cells nor B cells alone are required for demyelination, the question arises as to whether the small percentage of lymphocytes that are\u00b0\u00b1T cells are involved in this process. We infected\u00b0\u00b1 T cell-de cient mice with 50 pfu MHV-A59 i.c. (n D 4) and determined that these cells are also not required for demyelination (48% spinal cord quadrant demyelination)."}
