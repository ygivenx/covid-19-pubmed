{"title": "Health Guidelines for Travel Abroad", "body": "Most travel medical care is provided by patients' primary care physicians; only 10% of international travelers visit a travel clinic. The main purposes for travel include vacationing, visiting friends and family, business, and for educational purposes.\n\nThe purposes of the pretravel consultation are to estimate risk and provide recommendations to mitigate risk.\n\nThe initial pretravel assessment should focus on specific aspects regarding the health background of the traveler (Box 1). A full history and physical examination, including a review of immunizations, allergies, medications, and chronic medical conditions should be explored. Special attention and tailored recommendations should be given to those with chronic disease states, including congestive heart failure, diabetes, mental health issues, and immunocompromised states. It is important to note recent hospitalizations and surgeries and to assess the risk associated with traveling after these events. Prior travel history may provide clues regarding intolerance to certain antimalarials or other medications.\n\nReview the itinerary of the traveler, including types of travel, the reason for travel, and accommodations. Country-specific risks and travel advisories should be discussed in detail with the traveler by reviewing resources like the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (https://step.state.gov/). By assessing these specific aspects, the provider can obtain a wealth of knowledge that can be synthesized to help the traveler manage possible risks. \n\nTravel can be stressful and demanding for individuals with chronic disease states. Before travel, clinicians should direct travelers to recommendations provided by national associations related to their chronic medical states for travel guidelines. In addition, travelers should be directed to check in with the US embassy or consulate in their area of travel to clarify any restrictions on medications with which they may need to travel.\n\nMany health insurances do not provide adequate coverage for international travel, including repatriation and medical evacuation. 1 The following resources can be used to help travelers make a decision regarding the need for travel insurance, travel health insurance, and medical evacuation insurance.\n\nDepartment of State (www.travel.state.gov) International Association for Medical Assistance to Travelers (www.iamat.org)\n\nThe International Association of Medical Assistance to Travelers maintains a list of clinics available to members: www.iamat.org/doctors_clinics.cfm. In addition, the Joint Commission International maintains a list of accredited, certified health care facilities: www.jointcommissioninternational.org.\n\nMedications for chronic conditions and prevention of disease states specific to regions of travel should be procured before initiation of travel. Individuals with preexisting conditions or allergies should consider wearing a medical alert bracelet or card in their wallet. See Table 1 for a list of suggested travel health kit items. Providers should recommend travelers carry documentation of the following:\n\nHealth insurance, supplemental insurance, Proof of vaccinations, List of medications and preexisting conditions, and Contact card with emergency contact, location of travel, hospitals and clinics, US embassy or consulate number, health care provider contact information.\n\nThe World Health Organization has cited that, among deaths in travelers, 18% to 24% are caused by injuries, whereas only 2% are caused by infectious disease. 1\n\nAmong US travelers in foreign countries, motor vehicle accidents are the leading cause of death, making up approximately 27% of all nonnatural deaths in 1 study. 1 Contributing factors include lack of familiarity with infrastructure in the area of traveled, lack of seat belt use, alcohol use, travel fatigue, poor visibility, and increased risk for road-related accidents. 1 Prevention strategies include using seatbelts and child safety seats, avoiding night-time driving, increasing awareness of driving hazards, using helmets when driving motorcycles or motorbikes, avoiding alcohol or cellphone use before or during driving, using marked taxis for travel, avoiding travel in overcrowded buses, and remaining alert while crossing streets. 1\n\nDrowning is the fourth leading cause of death of international US travelers. 1 Avoidance of swimming alone and the use of a life jacket with water-related activities should be encouraged. Swimming should be avoided when local water conditions or currents are unknown and if a traveler has recently used alcohol.\n\nOf nonnatural death causes in foreign travelers, 21% can be attributed to crime and violence. 1 Clinicians should encourage travelers to familiarize themselves with crime trends in the areas they are traveling to. Information can be accessed from the Overseas Security Advisory Council website (www.osac.gov). Travelers can also familiarize themselves with security updates by accessing the Department of State's Bureau of Consult Affairs recommendations for travel safety at http://travel.state.gov. Special precaution should be taken to protect against pickpocketing and individuals should attempt to keep money worn under clothing secured to the neck or waist. Travelers should limit traveling alone or at night time, keep all valuables secure, keep all doors and windows locked, use recommended safe modes of transportation, and avoid resistance if confronted in a robbery. The nearest US embassy should be contacted if concerns related to crime, violence, accidents, medical concerns, or specific travel questions arise.\n\nTravelers should be educated about the risks of procuring medications while traveling including but not limited to medication side effects secondary to use of inappropriately compounded medications, counterfeit medications, and use of uncommon medication additives. 1 Clinicians should recommend obtaining all medications before travel to ensure that individuals are using authentic medications with known side effects and appropriate dosing.\n\nMaintenance of an accurate immunization history is necessary to provide adequate protection for the traveler. Immunization records should be obtained and reviewed and, if unreliable, titers for measles, mumps, rubella, and hepatitis A should be obtained. Sufficient time should be taken before travel to ensure travel-specific vaccines can be administered and appropriate immunity achieved ( Table 2 ). The risks and benefits of immunizations should be discussed. In addition, vaccines with waning immunity should be addressed as well, especially in the case of immunocompromised travelers. Assessing return travel to similar areas with the next 1 to 2 years from the initial trip will help clinicians to assess the need for specific immunizations. Travelers should be given an updated immunization record to travel with. Countryspecific recommendations for vaccines can be accessed by clinicians at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) travel website (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/ travel).\n\nSeveral important diseases are transmitted by mosquitos, of which malaria is among the most important. Most of the 1700 cases of malaria diagnosed in the United States annually are among returned travelers. 1 Box 2 outlines strategies for malaria prevention.\n\nFrom dawn to dusk, mosquitoes that transmit Dengue, Yellow Fever, Zika, and Chikungunya are active and bite whereas, from dusk to dawn, mosquitoes that carry malaria, West Nile, and Japanese encephalitis are active. Providers should review the CDC's Malaria Maps, and Malaria Information by Country Table and take note of the special considerations mentioned on the drug selection guide: https://www.cdc.gov/ malaria/travelers/drugs.html.\n\nAntimalarials should always be purchased before travel, because in some countries drugs that are sold may be counterfeit. 1 Clinicians should also warn travelers that if symptoms of malaria occur, including flulike illness while traveling or after returning home, immediate medical attention should be sought. Antimalarials alone do not prevent transmission and should be used in conjunction with preventive measures, including repellants for skin and clothing in addition to appropriate clothing and mosquito netting. 1,6\n\nTraveler's diarrhea often occurs suddenly with loose, frequent stools in about 30% to 70% of travelers. 7 Poor food handling practices are thought to put travelers at highest risk for traveler's diarrhea. Preventative measures include specific food and beverage selection, frequent handwashing, frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers with greater than 60% alcohol content, and consideration of vaccination against typhoid and hepatitis A. 8 Table 3 contains recommendations for traveler's diarrhea treatment based on severity.\n\nRespiratory illness occurs in 20% of returning travels, with upper respiratory infections being the most common respiratory illness. Risks include exposures in hotels, cruise ships, aircrafts and tour group. Individuals with comorbidities including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are at higher risk for respiratory illnesses. 1 Prevention tips include minimizing contact with individuals with cough or congestive symptoms, frequent handwashing, and vaccination before travel. Viral etiologies such as rhinovirus, are more common causal agents, although coronaviruses (Middle East respiratory syndrome in the Arabian Peninsula) and avian influenza (Asia) should also be included in a clinician's differential. 1 Viral causes can also put individuals at risk for superimposed bacterial infections. \n\nTravelers should be cautioned against obtaining tattoos and piercings in low-income areas of the world, because the risk of human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C transmission secondary to use of unclean needles is high in these areas. 1\n\nTravelers should be cautioned about the risk of human immunodeficiency virus specifically associated with certain practices, including needle sharing, risky sexual behaviors, or exposure in a health care setting. In the case of health care workers or individuals who plan to be involved with high-risk behaviors, the physician should discuss having postexposure prophylaxis available to them in case of exposure. Preexposure prophylaxis can reduce the risk of human immunodeficiency virus infection by up to 70%. 1 Immediate attention by a physician should be sought out if concern for exposure arises to ensure appropriate counseling and the possible need for postexposure prophylaxis.\n\nTravelers should be cautioned against high-risk sexual activities that may lead to the transmission of sexually transmitted infections, unwanted pregnancy, or bloodborne infections. Consistent contraceptive methods should be used in a traveler who does decide to be sexually active. Health care resources overseas should be provided for travelers, including reputable clinics to seek out if concerns for sexually transmitted infections and/or pregnancy arise.\n\nTravelers at increased risk for development of deep venous thrombosis who are traveling long distances should be advised to walk as often as possible, use appropriately fitted compression stockings that provide 15 to 30 mm Hg at the ankle, hydration, and to perform calf exercises as often as possible. The use of aspirin for deep venous thrombosis prevention is not recommended. 1\n\nWhen traveling between time zones, travelers can often develop a mismatch between their natural 24-hour circadian rhythm and the time of day. When traveling through more than 3 time zones, sleep-related difficulty, mood changes, mental clarity, and gastrointestinal disturbance can occur with jet lag. During the pretravel assessment, the clinician can discuss this in detail with the traveler and set expectations. Changes to diet and physical activity, sunlight exposure, the use of melatonin and melatonin-receptor analogs, consideration of hypnotic medications with discussion of risks and benefits, and a combination of these therapies can be discussed with the traveler before initiation of travel. Avoidance of alcohol as a sleep aid should be discussed with travelers as well as encouraging hydration during the trip.\n\nAccording to the 2018 CDC Yellow Book, immunocompromised travelers make up 1% to 2% of travelers seen in US travel clinics. 1 The immunocompromised status may be due to a medical condition, medication, or treatment. Common examples are noted in Box 3. Special points to remember for immunocompromised travelers:\n\nResponse to vaccines may be limited. Live vaccines are contraindicated in severely immunosuppressed individuals.\n\nChronic oral steroids greater than or equal to 20 mg per day of prednisone or equivalent Most live virus vaccines are contraindicated during pregnancy except for yellow fever, for which pregnancy is considered a precaution by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Malaria is more serious in pregnant than in nonpregnant women and puts both the mother and the fetus at risk. Malaria chemoprophylaxis is highly encouraged. Chloroquine and mefloquine (depending on the region) are the drugs of choice. Doxycycline and primaquine are contraindicated due to possible effects on the fetus, whereas atovaquone-proguanil lacks available safety data.\n\nAccording to the CDC, an estimated 1.9 million American children travel internationally each year. 1 Typically, children are exposed to the same risks as adults, but the consequences can be more severe and children are less likely to receive travel advice than adults. The most common health problems among child travelers were 1 :\n\nDiarrheal illnesses, Dermatologic diagnosis (animal/insect bites, cutaneous larva migrans, sunburn), Febrile illnesses (malaria), and Respiratory disorders.\n\nKey points when traveling with children 1 :\n\nDiarrheal diseases are more common and can be more likely to cause dehydration. Treatment should focus on oral rehydration solution and if indicated antibiotics for traveler's diarrhea. Children should be given a nonfluoroquinolone such as azithromycin, which can be given as a single daily dose (10 mg/kg) for 3 days.\n\nCar crashes and drowning are the leading 2 causes of death in children while traveling. Car seats are often not available so parents should bring their own. Life vests should always be used around water. Avoidance of mosquito and other bug bites is critical, especially in malaria endemic areas. Repellents with DEET should not be used on infants less than 2 months and after 2 months, only repellents with 30% or less DEET should be used. Malaria prophylaxis is also recommended for children in malaria endemic areas. Dosing will need to be adjusted based on weight. Doxycycline should not be given to children less than 8 years old because of the risk of teeth staining, and atovaquone-proguanil should not be used in children weighing less than 5 kg. Rabies is more common in children owing to less fear in approaching animals. If there is exposure to any animal bite, seek medical care immediately. Consider rabies vaccine if planning to spend more than 3 months in endemic area.\n\nA traveler who is returning home to visit friends or relatives is considered a visiting friends and relatives traveler. Today, visiting friends and relatives travelers make up more than one-half of all international travelers. 1 They are least likely to seek pretravel advice and more likely to develop problems while traveling because they typically stay longer at a destination, eat local food in people's homes, and often do not take the same precautions as other travelers. Key points for visiting friends and relatives travelers 1 :\n\nMalaria risk is 8 to 10 times higher than for a non-visiting friends and relatives traveler. Malaria immunity weans after living outside of a malaria endemic region, so when returning to the endemic region, malaria prophylaxis and mosquito bite avoidance is recommended. Malaria prevention medication should be started several weeks before international travel. Foodborne illnesses are more common and any immunity to local bacteria can also wean with time after living outside the community. Avoidance of food at room temperature, raw fruits and vegetables, tap water, and ice from tap water is recommended. These travelers are also at increased risk of tuberculosis and sexually transmitted diseases.\n\nWorldwide, 8% of travelers develop illnesses severe enough to seek a health care provider. 1 The majority of travelers present to primary care for posttravel illnesses. Data gathered from a directed history can elucidate the cause of a traveler's symptoms. Knowledge of the travel itinerary and incubation periods is essential to narrowing down a differential diagnosis based on geography and timing after travel.\n\nAccording to a large-scale study by GeoSentinal, a global surveillance network, the most common syndromes in returned travelers are gastrointestinal (34.0%), febrile (23.3%), and dermatologic (19.5%). 9\n\nMany cases of traveler's diarrhea can be treated empirically, and 80% to 90% of cases are bacterial. See Table 4 for top infectious causes of persistent traveler's diarrhea. Azithromycin should be preferentially used in travelers returning from South and Southeast Asia owing to the increasing resistance to fluoroquinolones. 7 Severe symptoms, including fever, tenesmus, and gross blood, should prompt further testing, including stool culture. If stool is tested for ova and parasites, 3 or more stool specimens should be collected to increase sensitivity. 7 Some organisms, such as Cryptosporidium and Cyclospora, require specific testing. Testing for Clostridium difficile should be performed if the traveler recently used antibiotics or malaria chemoprophylaxis. A minority of travelers have persistent diarrhea lasting more than 2 weeks, which can be from (1) persistent infection or an untreated coinfection, (2) postinfectious processes like postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome, which can be diagnosed using the Rome criteria, or (3) unmasking of a previously undiagnosed gastrointestinal disease. 7\n\nFever in a returned traveler needs to be evaluated immediately owing to the potential for a rapidly progressing, life-threatening illness like malaria. Those who arrive from areas where malaria is endemic should be evaluated with thick and thin blood films and malarial antigen tests, if available. Blood smears should be repeated if suspicion is high and initial smears are negative. Other important causes to consider include dengue fever, enteric fever (typhoid, paratyphoid), and rickettsial diseases (eg, African tick bite fever), among others. It is also important to keep in mind other common causes of fever including influenza, which occurs year round in tropical climates. See Table 5 for the top febrile illnesses to consider in returned travelers based on location. Those with fever accompanied by alarming symptoms should be thoroughly evaluated as soon as possible, which may be best conducted in the emergency department. In 25% to 40% of patients with fever, no specific cause was identified. 9,10\n\nRashes are common in returned travelers. One of the most common skin findings is the classic pruritic migratory serpiginous rash of cutaneous larva migrans. 11 Exposure occurs when skin (eg, bare feet) comes in contact with contaminated sand or soil. Animal bites and scratches, most commonly received from dogs and monkeys, are also common in returned travelers and may require rabies postexposure prophylaxis in up to 12% of cases. 9 See Box 4 for the top tropical dermatologic conditions to consider in returned travelers.\n\nCurrently, there are no CDC guidelines for asymptomatic returned travelers. \n\nAltitude illness is most common at altitudes of 8200 feet (2500 m) or more, although it can occur at lower elevations. 1 The main issue in altitude sickness is hypoxemia, which is exacerbated during sleep. Respiratory depressants such as alcohol and sleep medications should be avoided; acetazolamide and stimulants may speed acclimatization. Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity can exacerbate hypoxemia and should be avoided for the first 48 hours. Physical conditioning does not predict acclimatization. Contraindications to traveling to altitude include severe heart or lung disease, sickle cell anemia, high-risk pregnancy, and cerebral pathology.\n\nThere are 3 altitude syndromes: acute mountain sickness, high altitude cerebral edema, and high altitude pulmonary edema. Treatment involves immediate descent, medications ( Table 6) , oxygen supplementation, and pressurization bags if rapid descent is not feasible.\n\nSCUBA-related illnesses can be divided into 2 categories: barotrauma and decompression illness. The primary risk factors are dive depth, bottom time, and speed of ascent. 1 Decompression illness can occur even when all precautions are taken. The Divers Alert Network is a resource that can be accessed by both divers and health care providers at http://www.diversalertnetwork.org/ or at their 24-hour emergency hotline (919-684-9111).\n\nMotion sickness is not a true pathology, but a normal response to the external stimulation that is created by the vestibular system. The most common forms are sea sickness, motor vehicle sickness, and air sickness. It has been noted to be more common in women and less common in frequent travelers either owing to habituation or selfselection. See Box 5 and Table 7 for recommendations for motion sickness prevention and management. "}
