{"title": "Co-Infections in Children Hospitalised for Bronchiolitis: Role of Roomsharing", "body": "The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of cross-infection in children hospitalised for bronchiolitis, when patients with RSV share the same room with patients with bronchiolitis infected with another virus during the first day of admission.\n\nChi-square test was used to compare categorical data, Mann-Whitney U-tests for continuous data because of skewed distributions. Statistical analyses were performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 19.\n\nThis study is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01441466).\n\nOf the 84 patients with bronchiolitis hospitalised during the 11-week study period, 36 were excluded for the following reasons: cardiac disease (2), chronic lung disease with home oxygen (2), Down\u2019s syndrome (3), no parental consent (12), age > two (7), missed inclusion (6), missing nasal wash specimen at admission (3). A total of 48 patients completed the study (Table 2).\n\nThe distribution of viral pathogens is shown in Table 3; RSV was the major pathogen detected in 83%. Co-infection was found in 11 (22.9%) patients, nine of whom were already co-infected at admission, and two acquired co-infection during admission.\n\nOf all included patients, 37 (77.1%) had shared a room with other bronchiolitis patients, 20 of whom (54.1%) had shared a room with a patient infected with a different virus. The two patients who acquired co-infection during admission had never shared a room with another patient. None of the bronchiolitis-patients sharing rooms had been infected with another virus during admission.\n\nCo-infected patients did not suffer from more severe disease than patients infected with a single virus, but, although not statistically significant, disease severity tended to be higher in RSV-infected patients compared to RSV-negative patients (Table 4).\n\nThis study showed that nosocomially acquired co-infection is rare, even when RSV-positive and RSV-negative patients share a room during the first day of hospital admission. Furthermore, co-infection was not associated with more severe disease. The small number of our study limits any firm conclusion, however these findings may suggest that separating RSV-infected from RSV-negative patients with bronchiolitis may not be indicated. Cohorting of patients with bronchiolitis as one group, irrespective of viral diagnosis, may suffice.\n\nOur finding that cohorting of RSV-infected patients may not add to the prevention of co-infection is supported by the fact that the main route of transmission of respiratory viruses is through direct contact, with only a minor role for aerosol transmission [24, 25]. Therefore, we stress that strict adherence to other hygienic measures by medical staff and patient\u2019s relatives is clearly of crucial importance [23, 24]. Hand washing is the single most important procedure in the prevention of nosocomial infections, yet it remains the most violated of all infection control procedures [23, 24]. It is conceivable that placing children in a cohort generates considerable peer and parental pressure to ensure that measures such as hand washing are followed.\n\nOur results may also imply that routinely performing virological diagnostic testing is not needed in children with bronchiolitis. The diagnosis of bronchiolitis is a clinical diagnosis and for this purpose further diagnostic testing is not needed [29]. Since cohorting of RSV-infected patients is the most importance reason for virological testing in bronchiolitis, health care expenses can be reduced by omitting the routine use of these tests, provided that influenza, a serious and treatable infection, is excluded.\n\nThis does not exclude the potential usefulness of rapid broad range viral testing in specific circumstances, for example in young febrile infants, where rapid broad range viral testing might reduce the need for invasive sepsis workup, or in case of unclear clinical presentation (apnoea without respiratory signs) or for surveillance purposes.\n\nOur findings add to the current controversy considering this issue and we realise that the small numbers of our study limit solid comments on this subject and no definite conclusions can be made. Another important limitation is the fact that we only evaluated the risk of room sharing during the first 24 hours of admission. It is well possible that prolonged sharing of rooms increases the incidence of cross-infections. For practical and safety reasons, we deliberately chose to perform the study under these specific circumstances as a proof of principle, before embarking on a similar project with room sharing during the entire admission.\n\nWe conclude that, with standard hygiene control measures, the risk of nosocomially acquired co-infection is low, and does not appear to be related to room sharing between RSV-positive and RSV-negative patients (during the first day of admission). These findings argue against routine cohorting of RSV-infected bronchiolitis patients and against routinely carrying out broad range virological testing of infants hospitalised for bronchiolitis. Yet a larger number of patients, applying room sharing during the entire admission is needed before definite conclusions can be made."}
