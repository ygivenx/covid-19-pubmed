Firstly, we calculated the receiver we tested the different combination of these cytokines for the prediction of disease 1 1 5\n\nprogression. Combinations of the three cytokines showed the highest AUC of 0.943, of IP-10 and IL-1ra (0.923) ( Figure 3 ). Furthermore, we analyzed the serial change of improvement of the disease, and became moderate cases (cases 4, 10, 12 and 14) or 1 2 5 discharged from hospital (cases 3, 5, 6 and 10). These results indicated that these 1 2 6 three cytokines could be considered as biomarkers to predict disease progression and 1 2 7 outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infections.\n\nCytokine storm with uncontrolled proinflammatory responses induce significant 1 2 9\n\nimmunopathology and severe disease outcomes during some viral infections,\n\nindicating an important role in the pathogenesis of these viruses 2,32 . Accordingly, not 1 3 1 only the pathogens but also the pathogen induced cytokine storm should be 1 3 2 considered during the treatment.
