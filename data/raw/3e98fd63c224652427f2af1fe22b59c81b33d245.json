{"title": "New thinking in the treatment of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia", "body": "1,073 in Henan, and 7,288 in other provinces.\n\nThe main method of transmission of 2019-nCoV was via large droplets when people coughed or sneezed [4] , a pattern that could be mistaken for a typical flu epidemic at first. The virus also spread through contact with contaminated equipment and materials. When people congregate in settings other than work, they will continue to spread the virus, so the benefits of workplace closure may be greatly reduced or eliminated. Of the emerging pathogens capable of infecting humans that could be called exopathogens, about 75% originated as diseases of animals [14] . Knowing that the spread of pneumonia depends on person-to-person transmission could help researchers predict and prevent the spread of the new virus. The WHO has been helping countries prepare to contain the virus as much as possible [5] .\n\nHealth monitoring of contacts should continue until the maximum incubation period has ended. Detailed epidemiological investigation and contact follow-up have shown that the incubation period of the virus is typically between 3 and 7 days and no more than 14 days. During the incubation period, patients appear normal, with no symptoms, but can still spread the disease [6] .\n\nMost deaths and illnesses have occurred in older adults and those with underlying medical conditions; children and infants are also vulnerable to the disease.\n\nThe majority of patients have had a favorable prognosis, with mild and atypical symptoms in children and a small proportion of critically ill patients. Deaths are much more common in older adults and those with underlying medical conditions [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] .\n\n2019-nCoV pneumonia were also infectious to human beings and follow with extensive interest as zoonoses [13] . However, even in such a present information, increasingly wealthy and technologically adept times, there was still a high mortality rates and its therapeutic efficacy was not ideal. Therefore, the intervention of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and ethnic minority medicine would provide a new and actual treatment to fit the current situation or need in times of crisis. We will give full play to TCM and folk medicines of ethnic minorities in disease prevention and control.\n\nTCM has a unique approach to disease. Inspection, auscultation and olfaction, inquiry, and pulse taking and palpation are the four diagnostic methods used to investigate pathological conditions. Clinicians choose therapeutic principles and methods to comprehensively analyze clinical symptoms and etiology. TCM has played an important role not only for treating many common diseases but also for preventing and controlling major diseases and emerging infectious diseases. By This prescription is suitable for patients who is diagnosed with 2019-nCoV with mild symptoms, ordinary patients and severely ill patients. Critically ill patients can be used reasonable combination with clinical manifestations and CT manifestations.\n\nFor 2019-nCoV pneumonia prevention and treatment we provide a new security effective thinking, this is the original intention for writing this article."}
