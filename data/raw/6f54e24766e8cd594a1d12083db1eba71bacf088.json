{"title": "Comparison of the S genes and the biological properties of respiratory and enteropathogenic bovine coronaviruses Brief Report", "body": "gastroenteritis virus. This deletion was considered most likely responsible for the differences in tissue tropism and pathogenicity of the two viral strains [2, 16] .\n\nBCV possesses a single-stranded, nonsegmented RNA genome of positive polarity [22] . The virion contains four major structural proteins: the nucleocapsid protein (N), the transmembrane protein (M), the hemagglutinin esterase protein (HE) and the spike protein (S) [1] . The S glycoprotein is the predominant peplomere responsible for the characteristic coronavirus morphology. It is synthesized as a high molecular weight precursor (190 kDa) which is cleaved to yield two comigrating subunit polypeptides: the N-terminal half ($1) and the C-terminal half ($2) with approximate molecular weights of 100-110kDa [23, 24] . The S glycoprotein functions in virus attachment to permissive cells, virus-induced cell fusion, and elicitation of neutralizing antibodies [22] .\n\nThe BRCV strain Giessen 89-4595-(BRCV-G95) was originally isolated in human rectal tumor (HRT-18) cells [-25] from nasal swabs of a calf affected with respiratory disease, and tentatively identified as a BCV by immunoelectron microscopy and inhibition of hemagglutination with BCV-specific antisera. We report here the comparative analysis of biological and antigenic properties as well as the S gene sequences of the BRCV-G95 and of BECV.\n\nViral RNA was isolated from BRCV-infected HRT-18 cells using isothiocyanate/cesium chloride gradients [10, 26] . cDNA synthesis, PCR amplification and single-stranded cDNA synthesis were performed as reported [19, 26] . Nucleotide sequences of the complete S gene of the BRCV-G95 were determined from PCR-products in both directions, and were analyzed as described in the legend of Fig. 1 .\n\nAn open reading frame (ORF) of 4092 nucleotides encoding a protein of 1363 amino acids was identified for BRCV-G95. This ORF has the same size as the S gene of BECV-LY138 [26] . Differences between the S gene sequences of \n\nB E C V -L Y 1 3 8 Fig. 1 . Sixty-one nucleotides differed between the S genes of BRCV-G95 and BECV-LY138, and 34 of these did not result in any amino acid changes, whereas 27 nucleotide changes coded for 25 different amino acids. The degree of nucleotide and amino acid identity was 98.7 and 98.3}/0, respectively. The predicted S protein of BRCV-G95 had one N-linked glycosylation site and one cysteine residue less than the S of BECV-LY138. The putative fusogenic domain and proteolytic cleavage site of the S protein were conserved. The antigenicity of BRCV-G95 and BECV was compared in Western blots under denatured and native conditions using a panel of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for the S protein (#34B8, #43C2, #43F6, #44, #38, #31) and the N protein (#36, #46). The characteristics of these MAbs and the procedures for Western blots were described [8] . As shown in Table 1 , MAbs #34B8, 43C2 and 43F6 reacted with gpl00 of BRCV-G95, BECV-LY138 and BECV-L9, while MAbs #44, 38 and 31 reacted with gp 100 of BECV-L9 but not BECV-LY138 and BRCV-G95 in native Western blots. These MAbs did not react with S of the three viruses under denatured Western conditions, except that M A b 34B8 reacted weakly with BRCV-G95. Two N-specific MAbs reacted with N of all three viruses under denatured and native conditions. Biological properties such as cytopathic changes with cell fusion, hemagglutination, and acetylesterase activities of BRCV-G95 were compared with those of BECV-LY138 and BECV-L9 (Table 2 ). All three viral strains agglutinated chicken and mouse erythrocytes. BRCV-G95 and BECV-LY138 agglutinated mouse erythrocytes at 32-fold higher titers than chicken erythrocytes, while BECV-L9 had only a 4-fold higher titer. Viral acetylesterase activity was determined by the a m o u n t of acetate released from bovine submaxillary mucin b The acetylesterase activity was determined by releasing acetate from substrate bovine submaxillary mucin (BSM) and expressed as gg acetate per gl purified virus preparation as described previously [7, 27] according to the method described [7] . Acetylesterase activities of these strains were similar, and ranged from 2.02 to 2.86 gg acetate per microliter of purified virus preparation.\n\nBECV-L9 induced cytopathic changes and cell fusion in HRT-18, bovine fetal spleen (D2BFS), Georgia bovine kidney (GBK) and Madin Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells while BRCV-G95 and BECV-LY138 induced these changes only in HRT-18 cells ( Table 2 ). The ability of BRCV to replicate in HRT-18 cells which possess the properties of intestinal epithelial cells, indicates this virus may be able to infect both respiratory and intestinal sites of calves. Coronaviruses were frequently isolated from the respiratory as well as intestinal samples of calves with pneumoenteritis when HRT-18 cells were employed (Herbst et al., unpubl, res.) indicating that HRT-18 cell cultures should be included in routine diagnostic viral isolation attempts from respiratory disease of cattle. Comparatively, the porcine respiratory coronavirus replicated in the intestine but at lower titers and without causing enteritis [2, 14] .\n\nThe envelope proteins ofcoronaviruses play a major role in interactions with cellular receptors and in infection. A small deletion in the amino terminal of the S protein of the mouse hepatitis virus and PRCV altered their cell tropism and pathogenicity reflecting the function of the S protein in tissue-tropism [4, 16] . Sequence analysis of the BRCV-G95 did not reveal any deletions or insertions in the S gene when compared with BECV strains (Fig. 1) . Sixty-one single nucleotide changes occurred in the S genes between BRCV-G95 and BECV. These mutations were found throughout the genes in a random fashion and caused 25 amino acid changes. It is not clear at this point whether these single mutations in the peplomeric proteins contribute to a difference in the pathogenicity of BRCV-G95 and BECV-LY 138. Interestingly, the S and the HE glycoproteins of BCV recognized sialic acid-containing receptors [20, 21] . The location of the receptor-binding domains on the S protein of BCV is not known. Whether the single amino acid changes occurring in the S and HE proteins are located within domains involved in virus recognition of cellular receptor determinants remains to be elucidated. The results suggest that the respiratory isolate of bovine coronavirus B R C V -G 9 5 should be considered as a m e m b e r of the hemagglutinating B C V group rather than as a separate B R C V group."}
