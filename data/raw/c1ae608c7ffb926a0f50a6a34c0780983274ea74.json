{"title": "", "body": "Novel coronaviruses (COVID- 19) , which was found in Wuhan, China in December 2019 presents an acute public health threat to the whole world [1] [2] . The new virus is different from known coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS, though they share some similar respiratory illness symptoms such as fever, cough, or/and shortness of breath [2] . It is believed to root from the animal but spreads from person-to-person.\n\nThe COVID-19 spread even shows that persons without any symptoms or clinically negative in infection can still spread it to others. There is no official vaccine or antiviral drug available up to now (Jan 30, 2020) to treat COVID-19 infected patients [3] [4] . The outbreak of COVID-19 infection is forcing China and many countries to take harsh protection policies. More than eight-thousands of infections have been reported in China and more than a dozen of countries until Jan 30, 2020. More than 15 cities including Wuhan have been quarantined to halt the spread of the COVID-19. It is expected that millions of people can be on lockdown because of COVID-19. WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a global health emergency on Jan 30, 2020.\n\nIt is essential to know the accurate incubation period of COVID-19 for the sake of deciphering dynamics of its spread. The incubation period is the time from infection to the onset of the disease. It provides the foundation for epidemiological prevention, clinical actions, and drug discovery. Different viruses have different incubation periods that determine their different dynamics epidemiologically. The incubation period of H7N9 (Human Avian Influenza A) is about 6.5 days, but the incubation period for SARS-CoV is typically 2 to 7 days [5] [6] . However, it remains unclear about its exact incubation period of COVID-19, although WHO estimates it is between 2 to 14 days after exposure [8] . It can be difficult to estimate the All rights reserved.

Or data may lack meaningful exposure history. Furthermore, it is also unknown whether the incubation time will show some statistically significant with respect to Age and Gender. In this study, we aim to accurately estimate the incubation period of COVID-19 by taking advantage of datasets with a well-documented history of exposure. Our results show the incubation mean and median of COVID-19 are 5.84 and 5.0 days respectively and there is a statistical significance with the role of gender. However, the incubation periods of the groups with age>=40 years and age<40 years show a statistically significant difference. Our machine learning analysis also shows that the two groups are linearly separable that demonstrate a clear boundary in knowledge discovery visualization.\n\nWe collected a dataset with 59 officially confirmed COVID-19 cases from 10 regions in China except for Hubei province, the assumed origin of the virus. The patient data was dated from Dec 29, 2019, to Feb 5, 2020. We only involved the officially confirmed cases with a clear history of exposure and time of onset in data collection. We exclude those without relevant epidemiological descriptions, working or living in Wuhan for a long time, or hard to determine the possible exposure time.\n\nData collected for this study included region, age, gender, exposure history, and illness onset. For those cases whose incubation periods locate in an interval [ ! , \" ], we use its midpoint = # ! $# \" \" to represent its incubation period. For example, Case no. 2 in our dataset went on a business trip in Wuhan on Jan 12 th , 2020 and returned to Shaanxi on Jan 15 th , 2020, but had fever symptoms on Jan 20 th 2020. The incubation will be calculated as = \n\nWe propose a Monte Carlo simulation approach that takes advantage of bootstrap techniques to estimate incubation median and mean estimation for the small sample with 59 cases. It is more data-driven compared to traditional parametric approaches to handle parameter estimation for small datasets.

We can reject normal, lognormal, and Weibull distributions strongly under the significance level of 0.05 cutoff [11] [12] . Although we can't reject Gamma distributions for its boundary line p-value (0.06086), it can be risky to use it to fit and estimate the distribution of the incubation period under a small sample size. We further employ the maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) for the parameters of the gamma, conduct the goodness-fit test, and obtain p-value=8.6807e-04. As such, we only rely on nonparametric techniques in data analysis rather than use any pre-assumed distributions. \n\nMann-Whitney rank test shows that there are no significant differences between the incubation of males \n\nPearson correlation coefficient analysis shows the R statistics is 0.244 with p-value: 0.06758.

It indicates that the younger group tends to have a shorter incubation period. The variance of their incubation period also seems to be smaller. The Mann-Whitney rank test shows that there's a statistically significant difference between the incubation of age<40 and age>=40 groups with the null hypothesis: the medians of incubation period between two groups are the same. The p-values for corresponding alternative hypotheses: the age<40 group has a smaller incubation median is 0.00474. It suggests that the age<40 group has a shorter incubation period than the age>=40 group. Similarly, the Siegal-Tukey test indicates the younger group's incubation variance is less than the older group's by p-value: 0.0083. It may suggest COVID-19 has a faster but relatively constant spread speed among people <40 years old than people >=40 years old. Figure 4 illustrates biplots of the dataset by removing two cases with missing items by using PCA (principal component analysis), sparse PCA (sparse principal component analysis, t-SNE (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding), and LLE (locally linear embedding) [16] [17] [18] [19] . Data is partitioned as the age>=40 and age<40 groups in visualization. t-SNE shows that only one case in the age>=40 group falls in the cluster of the age < 40 group. But PCA, sparse PCA and LLE all show that the incubation of two groups is linearly separable, which means there exists an obvious linear boundary to separate them, in the subspaces generated by PCA, SPCA, t-SNE, or LLE. Such machine learning results indicate that the two groups are actually independent clusters spatially. However, we also find that the incubation data will no longer demonstrate the linear separability property when we partition it as age>=50 and age<50 groups or age>=55 All rights reserved.

It suggests that age 40 can be a key age cutoff for the incubation of COVID-19 along with previous statistical analysis. \n\nWe further estimated population mean and standard deviation, median and 2.5 th and 97.5 th percentile by using Bootstrap under 10 6 times resampling.

It suggests that COVID-19 could have a faster distribution speed than H7N9, but the same spread speed as SARS and MERS in terms of their incubation periods [22] . The existing spread of COVID-19 is faster than SARS partially because it has more complicate spread dynamics [2] . For example, All rights reserved.

The family cases simply refer to the patients who were caught by COVID-19 because their family members had been infected. The Mann-Whitney rank test shows that there are not significant differences between family patients and non-family patients in terms of the median of incubation period. The Siegal-Tukey tests on scale also verify that the incubation scales are at the same level for family patients and non-family patients.\n\nOur studies indicate that incubation periods of the age>=40 years and age<40 years groups not only statistically significant but also linearly separable in machine learning. It may suggest different treatments should be considered for the two different groups. It will be more interesting to estimate different incubation time for them separately. That the estimated 97.5 th percentile of COVID-19 incubation is 12.89 days (95% CI: (11.00, 16.13)) may suggest a long isolation or quarantine time (e.g. 17 days) can be better than the widely accepted 14 days. Furthermore, different quarantine time should be applied to the age>=40 years and age<40 years groups for their different incubation periods. Generally speaking, a longer quarantine time can be considered for the old patients (>=40 years) than young patients (<40 years old). Our ongoing work is to collect more qualified data to extend our existing results and investigate incubation of COVID-19 for different groups besides comparing our incubation estimation with other studies [23] ."}
