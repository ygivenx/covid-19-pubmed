{"title": "Synthesis, modification and docking studies of 5-sulfonyl isatin derivatives as SARS-CoV 3C-like protease inhibitors", "body": "The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is a serious lifethreatening upper respiratory tract disease with the most common symptoms of cough, high fever, headache, rigor, myalgia, and dizziness. 1 In 2003, SARS abruptly emerged and spread widely, becoming an epidemic that seriously affected public health and the economy of many countries. 2, 3 Although SARS has been controlled and no known SARS transmission has been recorded anywhere in the world, the mutant characteristic of the coronavirus that is the causative agent of SARS indicated the possibility of a re-emergence. [4] [5] [6] The emergence of the novel human coronavirus EMC (HCoV-EMC) in the Middle East since April 2012 has so far led to 17 cases of human infection (with 11 being fatal) as of 26 March 2013. 7 SARS virus is a novel human coronavirus featuring the largest positive-stranded RNA genomes known to date (27-31 kb) and is also termed SARS-CoV. CoV encodes a chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL pro ) that plays a pivotal role in the virus replication. The cysteine protease 3CL pro is fuctionally analogous to the main Picornaviridae protease 3C pro with a catalytic dyad (Cys-145 and His-41) in the active site. 8 3CL pro Cleaves the replicase polyprotein at 11 conserved sites with canonical Leu-Gln (Ser, Ala, Gly) sequences, in which the P1 position has a well-conserved Gln residue and the P2 position has a hydrophobic amino acid residue. 9, 10 Given the essential role in viral processing of SARS-CoV 3CL pro , it is considered as an attractive target for anti-SARS and other coronavirus infections.\n\nA large number of peptidomimetic and small-molecule inhibitors of 3CL pro have been reported to date, including peptideomimetic, 5,11-20 stilbene derivatives, 21 hydroxyferroquine derivatives, 22 TG-0205221, 23 natural products, [24] [25] [26] [27] ketones, 1, 28 glycyrrhizic acid, 29 pyrimidines, 30 a,b-unsaturated esters, 31 ML188, 32 pyrazolones, 4 nucleoside analogs, 33, 34 and isatin derivatives. 35, 36 Although so many candidate anti-SARS CoV agents have been identified, no effective therapeutic drug and vaccine have been developed so far.\n\nHigh-throughput screening revealed that 5-bromoisatin was a potent inhibitor, and then 5-bromoisatin was also soaked into a crystal of 3CL pro recently obtained in our laboratory (Fig. 1) . Although this complex has not been deposited in the protein data bank because of the poor structural quality, this fact provided us with an important clue that isatin derivatives can have inhibitory activity against 3CL pro . Previously, Chen and Zhou et al. 35, 36 reported a new class of potent, small-molecule isatin-based 3CL pro inhibitors (Fig. 2 ). They concluded that the C-5 position favors a carboxamide group and the N-1 position favors large hydrophobic substituents. In this Letter, we investigated a replacement of the carboxamide group using a series of substituted sulfonamide groups in isatin. We believe that this modification can improve inhibitory activity against SARS CoV 3CL pro . We also carried out molecular docking studies to obtain the potential binding mode of these inhibitors.\n\nCompounds 3a-f, 3h, and 3j were obtained from commercial suppliers. The synthesis of isatin derivatives 3g and 3i is summarized in Scheme 1. Intermediates 2g and 2i were prepared by the Sandmeyer reaction of substituted anilines with hydroxylamine hydrochloride and chloral hydrate. The resulting hydroxyiminoacetanilide intermediates 2g and 2i were cyclized by heating in concentrated sulfuric acid to give the corresponding isatin derivatives 3g and 3i, respectively. 37 A series of compounds 8 was prepared from isatin following literature methods 38, 39 (Scheme 2). In a typical procedure, isatin was sulfonated at the 5-position in the presence of chlorosulfonic acid. However, in contrast to previously published results, both 5-sulfonated gem-dichloroisatin 4 and 5-sulfonated isatin 5 were isolated, and the yield ratio was 9:1. Moreover, no desired sulfonyl chloride product was obtained. Interestingly, both 4 and 5 can react with secondary amines, respectively. Especially, 5 can directly produce compound 7 in high yield. In this paper, the mixture of compounds 4 and 5 was not isolated and was applied to synthesize target compounds 7 and 8, and the gem-dichloro moiety of intermediate 6 was subjected to acidic hydrolysis to afford 7. Alkylation of 7 was achieved in the presence of various bromides or iodides and NaH in DMF. Both analytical and spectral data of all target compounds 7 and 8 were accordant with their structures.\n\nA series of compounds 3 substituted at the benzene ring of isatin was initially screened against SARS CoV 3CL pro in vitro, and results are summarized in Table 1 . SARS CoV 3CL pro was found to be sensitive to the substituent position. Inhibitory activity results showed that compounds 3a-f and 3h substituted at the 5-position were superior to those of compounds 3i and 3j substituted at other positions. This result indicated that modification at the 5-position of the isatin ring was suitable and much more effective in increasing inhibitory potency. The replacement of bromine 3a at the 5-position by iodine 3b, chlorine 3c, and fluorine 3d did not increase inhibitory activity. Table 1 shows that most of compounds containing the oxy substituent 3e-h displayed high inhibitory activity, except 3g. Results revealed that the substituent containing the oxy group at the 5-position was important in improving inhibitory activity.\n\nConsidering the inhibitory tendency in Table 1 and 5-(piperazin-1-ylsulfonyl)isatin derivatives 7a-h were prepared and evaluated by inhibition assays, and the results are shown in Table 2 . Compared with 3, compound 7a exhibited a higher inhibition ratio (98.64%), with IC 50 = 76.74 lM. Although compounds 7b and 7c were less active than 7a, 7d-h exhibited the increased inhibitory potency. Both one carbon (7d, IC 50 = 31.71 lM; 7e, IC 50 = 32.08 -lM) and two carbons (7f, IC 50 = 34.91 lM) between aromatic ring and piperazine showed a similar profile, which was an approximately twofold higher potency than 7a. Compound 7h containing more hydrophilic moiety (pyridinyl) instead of the phenyl ring slightly increased activity (IC 50 = 51.33 lM) compared with compounds 7b and 7c. In particular, the substituent with flexibility increased potency (7d-g, IC 50 <35 lM) compared with 7b-c. These results suggested that the steric effect in isatin scaffold was crucial to ensuring inhibitory potency.\n\nReplacement of the piperazinyl moiety by other simple cyclic secondary amines was also examined ( Table 2) to determine the most suitable substituent. Unexpectedly, 7i-m induced a more apparent improvement in inhibitory potency than bicyclic substituents 7b-h, and 5-(piperidin-1-ylsulfonyl)isatin derivatives 7i and 7k-m showed better potency with IC 50 <5 lM. Among them, 4-methylpiperidinyl (7k, IC 50 = 1.18 lM) and 2-methylpiperidinyl (7l, IC 50 = 2.25 lM) were the optimal substituents for enzyme inhibition, which enhanced potency by about 80-and 40-fold compared with 7a, respectively.\n\nAfter determining the influence of the substituent at the 5-position, we synthesized and examined a series of N-substituted isatin derivatives 8 to determine whether the inhibitory potency against SARS CoV 3CL pro Can be enhanced by modified isatin derivatives at the N-1 position. As shown in Table 3 , introduction of methyl, benzyl, and b-naphthyl methyl into the N-1 position showed significant activity variation. Most remarkably, methyl at the N-1 position resulted in a 1-to 10-fold enhancement in the inhibitory potency compared with the parent compounds 7 in Table 2 , and these compounds displayed higher potency than the ones with benzyl or b-naphthyl methyl. However, 7k (IC 50 = 1.18 lM) was not sensitive to methyl (8k 1 , IC 50 = 1.04 lM) or benzyl (8k 2 , IC 50 = 1.69 lM), which exhibited high inhibitory potency. Explaining such similar activity tendencies was difficult, so docking studies were conducted.\n\nTo predict the binding mode of isatin 5-sulfonylamide onto the active site of SARS CoV 3CL pro (PDB code 1UK4) using Glide 5.5 (Glide model in Schrodinger software), compounds 7k, 8k 1 , and 8k 2 were docked into the active site. As shown in Figure 3 , compound 8k 1 was hydrogen bonded in Gly143 and Cys145 of protease, and 8k 2 generated hydrogen bonds with Gly143, Ser144, and Asn142. Notably, both carbonyl group at the 2-position and nitrogen atom at the 1-position of isatin are important in the formation of hydrogen bonds. Meanwhile, the modeling shown in Figure 4 revealed that the isatin scaffold was docked at the S1 0 site, and the side chain R 2 and R 3 were located at the S2 and S1 sites of SARS CoV 3CL pro , respectively. The model of compounds and SARS-CoV 3CL pro presented here differed from previously reported 5-carboxamide isatin derivatives. 36 The orientation of the isatin core was flipped here in Fig. 4 . The substitutions at the 5-position enabled the compounds 8k 1 and 8k 2 to fit the S2 hydrophobic site in both docking results. Furthermore, the simple six-membered ring sulfonyl group of isatin at the 5-position well fitted S2, as demonstrated in the potent inhibition of 7a and 7i-m. However, the 5-sulfonyl isatin derivatives 7b-h modified by rigid bicyclic substituents at the 5-position did not fit the limited space of S2, which led to diminished inhibitory activity. Interestingly, increasing the length of substitution enabled compounds containing the flexible group 7d-g to extend into the S3 site, which has not been mentioned in previous references. These docking experiments supported the observation in the enzymatic assay that the potency of these derivatives followed the order 7d (31.71 lM) > 7a (76.74 lM) > 7b (>100 lM). Regarding the substituent at the N-1 position, the 5-carboxamide group 36 was replaced by N-1 substitution here and the methyl and benzyl substitutions more or less accommodated the hydrophobic characteristics at the S1 site. In addition, 8k 1 molecule (total score = 8.70) was predicted to show the analogous binding affinity relative to 8k 2 (total score = 8.58), which was consistent with the experimental results. Based on the findings above, we believe that the activity of the title compounds can be improved by modifying with the simple six-membered ring at the 5-position and substitution at the N-1 position with a methyl group, which can lead to a better combination of compounds with the protein pocket. derivatives resulted in the discovery of compound 8k 1 , with the most powerful potency (IC 50 = 1.04 lM). The results of the current study suggested that 5-sulfonyl isatin derivatives had similar inhibitory activities to the reported 5-carbonyl isatins. Meanwhile, the computer model of the associated complex between the title compounds and protease rationalized their inhibitory activities. Apparently, 5-sulfonyl isatin modified by a simple six-membered ring or a bulky substituent with sufficient flexibility at the 5-position coupled with methyl at the N-1 position could dramatically promote inhibitory activity. In addition, similar orientations of the isatin core were found in both docking and socking studies. This result could serve as an important basis for more structural optimizations.\n\nAll reactions were carried out under N 2 atmosphere unless otherwise noted.

The recombinant protein with GST-tag was purified by GST-glutathione affinity chromatography and ion-exchange column chromatography. The resulting purified protein was of high purity (>95%) as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis and the concentration was 0.5 lM. The buffer contained 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.3) and 1 mM EDTA. The substrate synthesized in Shanghai Biological Engineering Company was dissolved in DMSO, with 0.8 mM liquid storage for use.\n\nThe SARS CoV 3CL pro inhibition assays were conducted by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). The natural substrate amino acid sequence (AVLQSGFRKK) of SARS-CoV 3CL pro started with the MCA fluorescent group and connected the Dnp fluorescence quenching group with penultimate K. The screening system was as follows (Table 1) : the final concentrations of SARS-CoV 3CL pro , substrate, and compound were 0.5 lM, 16 lM and 1 mM, respectively. The settled concentration of protein, compounds were preheateded at 37\u00b0C and oscillated, and the substrate was added to the mixture above. The excitation/emission light was 320/405 nm, and the test was carried out every 3 s for 60 times. Drawing curves, the maximum value of the negative control curve slope was V 0 , and the largest compound curve slope was V 1 . The inhibition ratio was defined as 1\u00c0V 1 /V 0 , and IC 50 Value was obtained by the equation: V 0 /V = 1 + [I]/IC 50 , where V 0 is the initial rate of the reaction without inhibitor, V is the initial rate of reaction with the inhibitor at various concentrations, and [I] is the inhibitor concentration. Crystals were then transferred to a cryoprotectant solution consisting of 70% crystallization buffer, 20% (v/v) glycol, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. Crystallographic data were routinely collected in a conventional, in-house Rigaku X-ray generator with an R-AXIS 944+ detector at a wavelength of 1.5418 \u00c5. Data were processed and reduced with HKL-2000 package. A total of 360 frames were collected with 0.5\u00b0oscillation angle. Exposure times were 30 s/frame. This strategy resulted in >95% completeness in the vast majority of the data sets with reducing R factors between 5% and 9%. Data were processed with HKL2000 and scaled with SCALEPACK. Phase and map calculations were performed using PHASER. The modeling and electron-density fitting software COOT was used to manipulate the models.\n\nThe structures (compound geometries) of 7k, 8k 1 and 8k 2 were built in Maestro 40 and cleaned by performing short force-field minimization. Compounds 7k, 8k 1 , and 8k 2 were subjected to full geometry optimization with DFT at the B3LYP/6-31G (d) level using GAUSSIAN 03. 41 Glide 5.5 (Glide model in Schrodinger software) was used to perform docking simulation of fully optimized 7k, 8k 1 , and 8k 2 . The X-ray structure of SARS coronavirus 3CL pro (PDB ID: 1UK4) was used as our initial protein model for docking. The protein structure was prepared using the Schr\u00f6dinger Suite 2010 Protein Preparation Wizard. Only chain-A of the dimer was used in this simulation. All water molecules were deleted from the protein structure before docking. The standard precision of Glidescore scoring functions was used to rank binding pose."}
