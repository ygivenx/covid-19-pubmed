Stabilized by interactions with NSP10 3 (orange), NSP16 relies on a highly conserved KDKE motif (red) to mediate its activity (11).\n\nPrevious alteration of this motif in both group 2b SARS-CoV (10) and group 2a MHV (9) 5 disrupted 2'O methyltransferase activity and attenuated varying aspects of infection. Based on 6 high conservation across the CoV family (Fig. 1B) , we hypothesized that disruption of the KDKE 7 motif would also attenuate other emerging CoV families, including the group 2c MERS-CoV.\n\nUtilizing a MERS-CoV reversed genetic system (12), we disrupted the KDKE motif by mutating 9 two nucleotides to produce a D130A change (Fig. 1A) . The resulting disrupted NSP16 mutant 10 (dNSP16) had no significant defect noted in stock titer generation (not shown); similarly, low 11 MOI infection of both Vero cells and Calu3 cells, a respiratory epithelial cell line, demonstrated 12 only modest attenuation at late time points (Fig. 1C & D) . Together, these results indicate that 13 NSP16 activity is not required for replication capacity.\n\nIn vitro host response similar between SARS and MERS dNSP16 mutants.\n\nHaving established replication competence in both Vero and Calu3 cells, we next evaluated 16 induction of host pathways following infection. Calu3 cells infected at MOI 5 demonstrated no 17 differences in replication (not shown) and only modest differences in host induction (0 genes 18 fold expression g >1.5 log2). Unlike previous studies with SARS-CoV, rapid cytopathic effect 19 (CPE) by 24 hours limited analysis to early time points. Further DAVID based-analysis 20 compared network host responses between MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV dNSP16 (Fig. 2) .\n\nOver the first 24 hours of infection, both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV dNSP16 showed no 22 significant functional enrichment of any categories relative to corresponding wild-type (WT) 23 infections, consistent with the lack of replication attenuation. However, at late times (>24 hours 24 post infection), SARS-CoV produces robust changes in several host pathways including 25 cytokine responses, inflammation, and extracellular activity. Similarly, changes in apoptosis, 26 All rights reserved.

While more rapid CPE following MERS-CoV dNSP16 infection 2 precluded an equivalent finding at late time points, the SARS-CoV results suggest that the 3 absence of NSP16 activity eventually initiates host response changes that contribute to 4 attenuation at late time points.\n\nMERS-CoV dNSP16 attenuated in primary and in vivo models.\n\nTo further examine the replicative capacity of dNSP16, we infected both human airway models 7 and mice expressing human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV.\n\nPrimary human airway cultures (HAE) were challenged with wild-type and dNSP16 MERS-CoV 9 at a low MOI (Fig. 3A) . While robust replication was observed following wild-type infection, 10 dNSP16 MERS mutant had significant attenuation that corresponded well to previous results 11 seen with SARS-CoV dNSP16 (10). We next examined MERS dNSP16 replication phenotypes The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/173286 doi: bioRxiv preprint\n\nHaving established a deficit in MERS NSP16 mutant replication in relevant in vitro and in vivo 1 models, we next sought to evaluate the mechanism of attenuation. Previous work by our lab and 2 others had established increased susceptibility of NSP16 mutants to type I IFN (9, 10). While 3 both viruses were sensitive to IFN treatment, the MERS dNSP16 mutant had a significant 4 reduction in viral replication relative to control virus (Fig. 4A) . These results are consistent with 5 reports for NSP16 mutants in other coronaviruses (8).

In this study, we demonstrate the critical importance of NSP16 function to MERS-CoV The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. \n\nTogether, these results suggest that targeting NSP16 may be the most broadly applicable 20 platform for CoV attenuation.

Similarly, the existence of numerous CoVs in animal 1 populations raises the concerns for heterologous challenge from emergent viruses (30, 31).\n\nPrior reports had also demonstrated vaccine induced disease following heterologous challenge 3 with related SARS-like viruses (29, 32) . With this in mind, NSP16 vaccinated mice will need to 4 be examined in the context of heterologous challenge to determine if vaccine induced pathology 5 occurs. Together, these two factors represent important checkpoints in the pursuit of NSP16 as 6 a universal CoV vaccine platform.\n\nIn addition to aging and heterologous challenge, reversion and baseline pathogenesis 8 also represent important risks that must be evaluated in the context of an NSP16 vaccine.

In the absence of NSP16 22 activity, the MERS-CoV mutant is sensitive to type I IFN in an IFIT dependent manner providing 23 clear mechanism for attenuation. Importantly, unlike other conserved CoV platforms, the NSP16 24 mutant is both viable and robust enough to be utilized as an effective live-attenuated vaccine.\n\nWhile further vaccine characterization is required, the results indicate that disruption of CoV 26 All rights reserved.
