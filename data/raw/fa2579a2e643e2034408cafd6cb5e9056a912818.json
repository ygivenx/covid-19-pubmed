{"title": "Discovery, diversity and evolution of novel coronaviruses sampled from rodents in China", "body": "Coronaviruses (CoVs; family Coronaviridae) are the etiological agent(s) of respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurological diseases in animals and humans. The first coronavirus (infectious bronchitis virus) was isolated in chicken embryos in 1937 (Beaudette and Hudson, 1937) , with subsequent viral isolations in rodents, domestic animals, and humans. However, until the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in China in 2002/3 (Drosten et al., 2003; Woo et al., 2009) , coronaviruses had been of greater concern to agriculture than public health. Since the discovery of SARS-CoV intense scientific efforts have been directed toward characterizing additional coronaviruses in humans and other animals (Drexler et al., 2010; Guan et al., 2003; Lau et al., 2005; Li et al., 2005; Quan et al., 2010; van der Hoek et al., 2004; Woo et al., 2012) . As a consequence, the number of coronaviruses identified has increased rapidly (Woo et al., 2009 . Of particular importance was the recent discovery of a new severe respiratory illness with renal failure (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, MERS) caused by a novel coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (Bermingham et al., 2012; van Boheemen et al., 2012) , and which is also a zoonosis (Annan et al., 2013; Azhar et al., 2014; Reusken et al., 2013) . It is highly likely that there are additional unrecognized coronaviruses circulating in animals.\n\nRodentia (rodents) is the largest order of mammals with approximately 2277 species worldwide, representing some 42% of all mammalian species (Wilson and Reeder, 2005) . Rodents are a major zoonotic source of human infectious diseases (Meerburg et al., 2009; Luis et al., 2013) , particularly as they often live at high densities and hence may harbor high levels of microbial diversity (Moya et al., 2004) . In addition, some rodent species live in close proximity to humans, such that they represent an important zoonotic risk. To date, however, only one species of coronavirus -Murine coronavirushas been associated with rodents (de Groot et al., 2011) . The prototype virus, which was named mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), was first isolated in mice in 1949 (Cheever et al., 1949) , with a variant then identified in rats in 1970 (where it was termed rat sialodacryoadenitis coronavirus) (Parker et al., 1970) . No other rodent-associated CoVs have been discovered since this time.\n\nAlthough RNA viruses are often characterized by their high rates of mutation, recombination may also be of evolutionary importance, and has been associated with such characteristics as the ability to infect new hosts and alter virulence (Holmes, 2013) . Recombination appears to be commonplace in coronaviruses (Graham and Baric, 2010; Jackwood et al., 2012; Keck et al., 1987; Woo et al., 2006) , and which may facilitate their emergence. For example, two types of feline CoVs (FCoV) -FCoV type I and IIhave arisen by double recombination events between FCoV types I and canine Coronavirus (CCoV) (Herrewegh et al., 1998) . Similarly, recombination generated the three genotypes (A, B and, C) of human coronavirus HKU1 (Woo et al., 2006) , and homologous recombination has occurred in the evolutionary history of SARS-CoV (Graham and Baric, 2010) .\n\nTo explore the diversity and evolution of CoVs in rodent populations we screened rodents collected from rural regions of Zhejiang province, China. This revealed a remarkable diversity of CoVs circulating in rodents, along with evidence for cross-species transmission and recombination.\n\nA total of 1465 rodents representing 10 different species were captured from three locations in Zhejiang province, China during 2011-2013 (Table 1 and Fig. 1 ). RT-PCR targeting a conserved sequence of the viral RdRp (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) gene was performed to detect coronaviruses. PCR products of the expected size were recovered from 10 Apodemus agrarius, 4 Rattus norvegicus, 14 R. lossea, 1 R. tanezumi, and 1 Niviventer confucianus, such that approximately 2% of rodents were positive for CoV (Table 1 ). The classification of these viruses as CoVs (Family Coronaviridae, Genus Alpha-and Beta-) was confirmed by genetic analyses (see below).\n\nTo better characterize the rodent CoVs discovered here, complete viral RdRp gene sequences were recovered from 21 (70%) of the RNA positive rodent samples described above. Additionally, 1 complete and 4 near complete (498%) viral genome sequences were successfully recovered from five positive CoV samples (Table S1 ). Genetic analysis indicated that two CoVs sampled from R. norvegicus in Lucheng and Longquan shared 50.6%-71.7% nucleotide sequence similarity with alpha coronaviruses; 15 CoVs from 13 R. lossea, 1 R. ) (see phylogenetic results below). Overall, we designated these newly described viruses as Longquan Aa mouse coronavirus (LAMV), Longquan Rl rat coronavirus (LRLV), and Lucheng Rn rat coronavirus (LRNV), reflecting their host species and the geographic location of sampling. Further comparison of the CoV replicase domains [i.e. ADPribose 1\u2033-phosphatase (ADRP), chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL pro ), RdRp, helicase (Hel), 3 0 -to-5 0 exonuclease (ExoN), nidoviral endoribonuclease specific for uridylate (NendoU) and ribose-2 0 -O-methyltransferase (O-MT)] revealed that LRNV Lucheng-19 was o90% similar in amino acid sequence to known members of the genus Alphacoronavirus (Table S2) . Hence, these data suggest that LRNV is sufficiently divergent that it represents a novel species of coronaviruses according to the criteria for species demarcation in the subfamily Coronavirinae defined by the International Committee on Taxomony of Viruses (ICTV) (de Groot et al., 2011) . With respect to the other two viruses, LRLV Longquan-189 was o90% similar to known members of the genus Betacoronavirus in the ADRP and NendoU regions, suggesting that it represents a new variant of murine coronavirus (see phylogenetic analysis). Although LAMV Longquan-343 was nearly 90% similar in the conserved replicase domains to betacoronavirus 1 (i.e. Human coronavirus OC43, Bovine coronavirus, Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus, and Rabbit coronavirus HKU14) and o90% to other members of the genus Betacoronavirus (Table S2) , it does not exhibit sufficient sequence divergence to represent a new virus species. Hence, we classify it as a new variant of Betacoronavirus 1.\n\nThe viral genome sequences obtained in this study were compared with Rhinolophus bat coronavirus HKU2 virus, a member of the genus Alphacoronavirus (Lau et al., 2007) , and MHV (Cheever et al., 1949) , human coronavirus HKU1 (Woo et al., 2006) , rabbit coronavirus HKU14 , which are all members of the genus Betacoronavirus, (Fig. 2) . A previous description of the genome organization of CoVs (de Groot et al., 2011) was used as a reference. LRNV (Lucheng-19) had a genome of 28,763 nucleotides, with a G \u00feC content of 40.2%. Its genome organization was similar to those of members of the genus Alphacoronavirus, with the Table 2 , S3). The replicase ORF1ab (20,249 nucleotides in length) includes 16 predicted nonstructural proteins (nsp) ( Table S3 ). In a manner similar to Rhinolophus bat coronavirus HKU2 and human coronavirus NL63, LRNV possessed the core part of the putative transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) Fig. 2 . Genome organization of coronaviruses. The three CoVs discovered in this study are shown in bold. The star signifies the presence of a betacoronavirus-like NS2a gene in LRNV. 5 0 -AACUAA-3 0 upstream of the 5 0 end of each ORF with the exception NS4, with variable nucleotides matching the leader core sequences (Table 2) . Additionally, LRNV contained NS7a and NS7b genes between the M and N genes (Fig. 2) , and which are observed in no other members of the genus Alphacoronavirus. Perhaps the most striking feature of the LRNV genome was that NS2 encodes a putative nonstructural protein of 275 amino acids located between the replicase ORF1ab and the S gene (Fig. 2, Table 2 ). A BLAST search revealed that this NS2 had no amino acid sequence similarity with alpha-CoVs, but possessed approximately 42% amino acid identity with the NS2a of lineage A of beta-CoVs. Hence, this is suggestive of a homologous recombination event between alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs (and which was confirmed in the phylogenetic analysis below).\n\nIn contrast, the genome organization of LRLV and LAMV were similar to those of members of the lineage A CoVs of the genus Betacoronavirus, with the characteristic 5 0 -ORF1ab-hemagglutininesterase (HE)-S-E-M-N-3 0 gene order (Fig. 2) . In both LAMV and LRLV the NS5a and NS5b nonstructural proteins were located between the S and E genes. Interestingly, however, NS5a was not observed in the strain Longquan-370 (LRLV). The TRS of LAMV and LRLV appeared in two formsthe CUAAAC and CCAAAC type. The S protein of LRLV were 1350-1366 amino acids in length, with 65%-89% amino acid identity to the S proteins of other lineage A CoVs of the genus Betacoronavirus, while the S protein of LAMV were 1358 amino acids in length with 62%-68% amino acid identity to other lineage A CoVs of the genus Betacoronavirus. Finally, the S proteins of both LRLV and LAMV contain a potential signal peptide, receptor binding domain, a potential S1 and S2 cleavage site, two heptad repeats and one transmembrane domain (Table 3) .\n\nTo determine the evolutionary relationships among the novel CoVs discovered here and those found previously, we inferred phylogenetic trees based on the amino acid sequences of the 3CL pro , RdRp, Hel, S and N proteins (Figs. 3 and 4) . Consistent with previous work (de Groot et al., 2011) , all CoVs fell into two well supported groups, corresponding to the Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus genera respectively. With respect to the viruses identified here, LRNV clustered within the genus Alphacoronavirus, while LAMV and LRLV fell into the genus Betacoronavirus.\n\nOne of the most striking observations from the phylogenetic analysis was that the sequences from LRNV were located at five different positions in the phylogenetic trees, strongly suggestive of recombination (Figs. 3 and 4) . Specifically, in the 3CL pro and RdRp gene trees, LRNV clustered as a member of the genus Alphacoronavirus. LRNV also fell with alphacoronaviruses in the Hel genes tree, but as a basal lineage. Strikingly, however, LRNV clustered with the betacoronaviruses in the N gene tree, and formed a divergent lineage in S gene tree with Rhinolophus bat coronavirus HKU2, which has previously been shown to be a recombinant (Lau et al., 2007) .\n\nIn contrast, LAMV and LRLV consistently clustered within the lineage A of the genus Betacoronavirus, which also contained human CoV HKU1, MHV, rabbit coronavirus HKU14, and human CoV OC43 viruses. Notably, however, in the 3CL pro , RdRp, and N gene trees (Fig. 3) , two strains (Longquan-189 and Longquan-370) formed a monophyletic group with human coronavirus HKU1 virus, which was isolated from a patient with pneumonia in Hong Kong in 2005 . Interestingly, Longquan-708 was closely related to Longquan-370 and Longquan-189 in the 3CL pro , RdRp, and Hel genes, yet clustered with MHV and rat coronavirus in the S gene tree (Fig. 4) , and represented a distinct lineage in the N gene tree (Fig. 3) . Such variable grouping suggests that Longquan-708 may be a recombinant between two rodent CoV lineages. Finally, in the 3CL pro , RdRp, and S gene trees, LAMV (Longquan-343) occupied the most divergent phylogenetic position in a group of viruses that contained human CoV OC43 (St-Jean et al., 2004) as well as viruses sampled from domestic and wild animals (Hasoksuz et al., 2007; Lau et al., 2012; Lim et al., 2013; Vijgen et al., 2006) . However, LAMV comprised a distinct lineage in the Hel and N gene trees.\n\nTo investigate these putative recombination events in more detail, we undertook additional sequence analyses (Fig. 5 and Fig. S1 ). Table S1 .\n\nIn parental region A, Longquan-708 was most closely related to Longquan Rl Rat coronaviruses, while in parental region B it was more closely related to MHV. This recombination event was confirmed by phylogenetic analyses, in which the alternative grouping of Longquan-708 was supported with high bootstrap values ( Fig. 5B and C). In contrast, although readily apparent in the amino acid phylogenies, the recombination event involving LRNV did not receive significant statistical support in the RDP analysis, likely because the latter utilizes nucleotide sequences and these are highly divergent (for example, the S protein of LRNV differs from those of alphacoronaviruses by 478% at the nucleotide sequence analysis). Similar suggestions have previously been made with respect to recombination in Rhinolophus bat coronavirus HKU2 (Lau et al., 2007) .\n\nWe screened for coronaviruses in 1465 rodents representing 10 different species sampled in three locations in Zhejiang province, southeastern China. This survey identified a novel and phylogenetically distinct coronavirus in R. norvegicus -Lucheng Rn rat coronavirus (LRNV)which belonged to the genus Alphacoronavirus. According to the criteria defined by ICTV (de Groot et al., 2011) , LRNV was sufficiently genetically distinct that it should be recognized as a distinct species within the family Coronaviridae. However, the other two viruses identified -Longquan Aa mouse coronavirus (LAMV) and Longquan Rl rat coronavirus (LRLV)belong to the established species betacoronavirus 1 and murine coronavirus, respectively. More generally, the presence of all three viruses indicates that genetically diverse CoVs co-circulate in rodents in Zhejiang province.\n\nIt is notable that rodent-associated CoVs comprise a major proportion of the known genetic diversity in lineage A CoVs of the genus Betacoronavirus. This lineage contains viruses that cause enteric and respiratory diseases in humans (human coronavirus HKU1 and OC43) as well as in domestic animals (e.g. hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis in pigs) (St-Jean et al., 2004; Vijgen et al., 2006; Woo et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 1994) . Clearly, the role by rodents in the evolution of lineage A CoVs of the genus Betacoronavirus merits further investigation.\n\nThis study also provides the first evidence of CoVs of the genus Alphacoronavirus in Rattus rats (R. norvegicus), in the form of LRNV. However, our phylogenetic analysis suggested that this virus had a recombinant origin, with its N gene sequence more closely Table S1 . related to those of the genus Betacoronavirus (Fig. 4 ). Recombination appears to be commonplace in coronaviruses (Woo et al., 2009) , particularly within closely related viruses such as MHV variants (Smits et al., 2005) . Nevertheless, only a few examples of intergenotype recombination, involving CoVs from bats (Hon et al., 2008) and felines (Herrewegh et al., 1998) , have been documented to date. Hence, the observation that LRNV has a recombinant origin is significant because it means that recombination can occur between viruses assigned to different genera.\n\nAlpha-and beta-CoVs are largely associated with mammals, whereas gamma-and delta-CoVs are largely harbored by avian species . Because much of the genetic diversity of alpha-and beta-CoVs is associated with infections in bats, it has been suggested that bats are the main reservoir hosts for both alpha-and beta-CoVs (Woo et al., 2009) . Herein, we discovered three phylogenetically distinct lineages of rodent-associated CoVs within a limited geographic area in China, all of which are distinct from those viruses associated in bats. Consequently, it is clear that large-scale surveillance is needed to fully understand the role played by rodents in the evolution and emergence of coronaviruses.\n\nThis study was reviewed and approved by the ethics committee of the National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention of the Chinese CDC. All animals were treated strictly according to the guidelines for the Laboratory Animal Use and Care from the Chinese CDC and the Rules for the Implementation of Laboratory Animal Medicine (1998) from the Ministry of Health, China, under the protocols approved by the National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention. All surgery was performed under ether anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering.\n\nRodents were trapped in cages using cooked food as bait during 2011-2013 in Zhejiang province, China ( Fig. 1) (Mills et al., 1995) . All animals were initially classified to a specific rodent species by morphological examination, and were further confirmed by sequence analysis of the mt-cyt b gene (Guo et al., 2013) . All animals were anesthetized with ether before they were sacrificed, and every effort was made to minimize suffering. Tissue samples of liver, spleen, lung, kidney, and rectum were collected from animals for the detection of CoVs.\n\nTotal RNA was extracted from fecal or tissue samples using TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA was eluted with RNase-free water and was used as the template for reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and deep sequencing. CoV RNA was detected by nested RT-PCR which amplified the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene (RdRp) of CoVs using conserved primers (sequence available on request). Table S1 .\n\nReverse transcription was undertaken using AMV reverse transcriptase (Promega, Beijing) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cDNA was amplified with the following PCR protocol: 35 cycles of demodulation at 94 1C for 40 s, annealing at 44 1C for 40 s and extending at 72 1C for 40 s, with ddH 2 O as a negative control. For CoV positive RNA extractions, pair-end (90 bp) sequencing was performed on the HiSeq 2000 (Illumina) platform. The library preparation and sequencing steps were performed by the BGI Tech Corporation (Shenzhen, China) following a standard protocol provided by Illumina. The resulting sequencing reads were then assembled de novo by the Trinity program (Grabherr et al., 2011) into 152,684 contigs (4 200 bp) . BLASTx was performed to retrieve the CoV full genome sequences from the assembled contigs. These sequences were further verified using Sanger sequencing methods with primers designed based on the deep-sequencing results. To amplify the terminal ends, 3 0 and 5 0 RACE kits (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) were used.\n\nThe sequences generated in this study have been deposited in GenBank and assigned accession numbers KF294379-KF294380, KF294358-KF294372, KF294345-KF294357 for those representing coronaviruses, and KF294387-KF294416 for the host mt-cyt b genes (Table S1 ).\n\nBecause of extensive sequence divergence between the nucleotide sequences of different coronavirus genera, all phylogenetic analyses were based on amino acid sequences. Accordingly, amino acid sequence alignments were performed using the MAFFT algorithm (Katoh and Standley, 2013) . After alignment, gaps and ambiguously aligned regions were removed with Gblocks (v0.91b) (Talavera and Castresana, 2007) . Phylogenetic analyses were then performed using the sequences of five CoV proteins: (i) 3CL pro , (ii) RdRp, (iii) Hel, (iv) spike protein (S), and (v) the nucleocapsid protein (N). Phylogenetic trees were estimated using the maximum likelihood (ML) method implemented in PhyML v3.0 (Guindon et al., 2010) with bootstrap support values calculated from 1000 replicate trees. The best-fit amino acid substitution models (LG \u00fe\u0393 for 3CL pro , LG\u00fe \u0393\u00feI for Hel, RdRp, S and N) were determined using MEGA version 5 (Tamura et al., 2011) . The following data set sizes were used in the final analysis: 3CL pro \u00bc 290 amino acids (aa), RdRp \u00bc869 aa, Hel \u00bc581 aa, S \u00bc429 aa, N \u00bc 138 aa.\n\nThe TMHMM program (version 2.0; www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/ TMHMM/) was used to predict the transmembrane domains, while the Signal P program (version 4.0; http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/ SignalP/) was to determine signal sequences. Protein family analysis was performed using PFAM and InterProScan (Apweiler et al., 2001; Bateman et al., 2002) .\n\nFollowing visual inspection of the amino acid phylogenies, potential recombination events were identified in complete genome (nucleotide) sequences using the Recombination Detection Program v4 (RDP4), employing the RDP, GENECONV, bootscan, maximum chi square, Chimera, SISCAN, and 3SEQ methods (Martin et al., 2010) (with default parameters). All analyses were performed with a Bonferroni corrected P-value cutoff of 0.01. When putative recombination events were observed by two or more methods and with significant phylogenetic (topological) incongruence, the viral sequences were considered as potentially recombinant. To further characterize these recombination events, particularly the location of breakpoints, we inferred similarity plots using Simplot version 3.5.1 (Lole et al., 1999) . For each of the putative recombinant regions, phylogenies were estimated using the ML method performed with PhyML v3.0 (Guindon et al., 2010) under the best-fit substitution model determined by jModelTest (Posada, 2008) ."}
