{"title": "Establishment and application of a real-time loop-mediated isothermal amplification system for the detection of CYP2C19 polymorphisms", "body": "In this study, four plasmids were constructed by recombining the specific sequences of CYP2C19*2 G681G, CYP2C19*2 A681A, CYP2C19*3 G636G and CYP2C19*3 A636A. Using the primer pairs *2-seq-F/*2-seq-R and *3-seq-F/*3-seq-R, listed in Table 1, 226-bp CYP2C19*2 and 450-bp CYP2C19*3 fragments were amplified and sequenced by Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI; Beijing, China), indicating the successful incorporation of the four plasmids (data not shown).\n\nBased on the point mutations of the CYP2C19*2 (G681A) and CYP2C19*3 (G636A) genes, two sets of RT-LAMP primers were designed to discriminate the SNPs. As shown in Fig. 1, the basic principle of RT-LAMP involves the use of specific primers, with a forward inner primer (FIP) and backward inner primer (BIP) that are designed to contain a SNP nucleotide at the 5\u2032 terminus, each reaction including two common primers (F3 and B3) and two specific primers (FIP-G and BIP-G for G allele and FIP-A and BIP-A for A allele). The structures of the LAMP primers and products based on this study are presented in Fig. 1, and the information regarding the primer names and sequences are provided in Table 1. The target SNP was characterized using six different regions (F1/F1c-F3/F3c and B1/B1c-B3/B3c) specifically designed to recognize distinct regions on the target gene, which were designed to ensure that the primers would specifically amplify the G681A and G636A substitutions. The results depicted in Fig. 2 illustrate that the RT-LAMP method could accurately detect and discriminate all possible homozygotes and heterozygotes of CYP2C19*2 (G681A) and CYP2C19*3 (G636A) SNPs.\n\nWhen RT-LAMP was performed using the four plasmids as the templates, the best results were obtained in a final reaction volume of 25 \u03bcL. The reaction mixture contained 15 \u03bcL of Isothermal Master Mix (OptiGene Ltd., UK) containing Geobacillus DNA polymerase, thermostable inorganic pyrophosphatase, optimized buffer including MgCl2, dNTPs and ds-DNA dye, 5 \u03bcL of primer mix consisting of four primers each for F3 and B3 primers at 0.2 \u03bcM, FIP and BIP primers at 0.4 \u03bcM, and 5 \u03bcL ddH2O. The reaction was performed in 8-well 0.2-mL tubes with incubation at 62 \u00b0C (decided based on a series temperature gradient test) for 30 min. The fluorescence intensity of the ds-DNA dye was simultaneously monitored in a real-time fluorometer (Genie II from OptiGene Ltd. UK).\n\nThe sensitivities of the RT-LAMP assay were tested using 10-fold serial dilutions of the four constructed plasmids. The detection limit of the RT-LAMP assay was 1 \u00d7 101 copies of plasmid (the result for the CYP2C19 G681G plasmid is presented in Fig. 3A; the results for the other three plasmids are presented in supplementary Fig. S1), indicating that the RT-LAMP method was efficient and specific in SNP detection under a constant temperature with greater than 10-fold increased sensitivity compared with conventional PCR2324. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 3, a standard curve was generated using 10-fold dilutions of plasmids and calculated by regression analysis comparing the Tpeek with the copy number. The high correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.995) indicated that the RT-LAMP assay could be applied in DNA quantification.\n\nTo test the reliability of the RT-LAMP system optimized in this study, the accuracy of the RT-LAMP assay was further verified using 100 clinical samples. In addition, all of these samples were also assessed via conventional PCR (AS-PCR) and sequenced by BGI. The detected genotypes together with their frequencies are presented in Table 2. The observed allele frequencies were 75.5%, 24.5%, 95% and 5%, for *2G, *2A, *3G and *3A, respectively (calculated from: *2G: F1 + F3 + F4/2 + F5 + F6/2; *2A: F2 + F4/2 + F6/2; *3G: F1 + F2 + F4 + F5/2 + F6/2; *3A: F3 + F5/2 + F6/2). The frequencies of the CYP2C19*2 and CYP2C19*3 alleles were similar to those reported by Chen et al.25 in a Chinese population. The comparison of RT-LAMP with AS-PCR and direct sequencing revealed no discrepancies.\n\nIn recent years, DNA testing technology has been extensively used in the areas of diagnosis and disease detection. The LAMP technique is a unique assay with high efficiency and high accuracy that was developed rapidly. As described in some reports101112131426272829, the LAMP assay has been widely used in the detection of pathogenic microorganisms. However, to the best of our knowledge, reports regarding the detection of mutations in human genomic DNA, especially SNPs, using the LAMP method are lacking. In this study, the successful establishment of an inexpensive, rapid and real-time LAMP protocol for CYP2C19 SNP genotyping expanded the scope of application of this technique to human gene mutation detection.\n\nRT-LAMP is a one-step method wherein the amplification itself is the signal for SNP detection, whereas the difficulty in developing this technology involves the suppression of non-specific amplification30. To help overcome this difficulty, the target SNP is characterized using six different primer regions specifically designed to recognize eight distinct regions on the target gene1430. In this work, by adding or subtracting a few nucleotides in the primer regions, the Tm value and GC content were calculated until the six different primer regions were suitable for the LAMP reaction. As a result, the primer regions were selected as noted in Fig. 1 (F1-F3 and B1-B3). Furthermore, as the arrangement and composition of human genomic DNA is very complex, sequence alignment was necessary to avoid false recognition of the specific site. Thus, Primer-BLAST software (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast) was used to ensure that the chosen primer regions were specific to the target SNP, which helped avoid mismatches and locate the target SNP as accurately as possible.\n\nThe secondary structures of these primers may cause non-specific results in the LAMP reaction given that the selectable sequence area for primer design is limited to less than four hundred nucleotides surrounding the target SNP site9. Hence, the inner primers were designed (Fig. 1) to minimize the impact of the secondary structure given that the inner primers are the main component for DNA strand extension. Moreover, according to Tomita et al., the formation of a starting structure is the key initiating step of LAMP11. Specific nucleotides were added to the 5\u2032 termini (5\u2032-term) of the FIP and BIP primers to establish a complete and effective starting structure, as shown in Fig. 1. Consequently the starting structure would be successfully established only when the 5\u2032-term nucleotide was exactly matched with the target SNP (Fig. 1A). Otherwise, the starting structure was blocked, as shown in Fig. 1C, and the amplification could not proceed. In conclusion, non-specific amplification was effectively suppressed in this work through special primer design and accurate target location. In addition, using real-time fluorescence detection equipment, amplification and detection can be performed in a closed tube, which could reduce the risk of contamination.\n\nThus, the RT-LAMP method that was developed has an excellent sensitivity for detection of CYP2C19 polymorphisms (as shown in Fig. 3A). Similar results were observed by Singh et al.23 and Lee et al.35 with the same sensitivity of 1 \u00d7 101 copies. Moreover, a standard curve with a high correlation coefficient was obtained in this study, as shown in Fig. 3B, indicating that except for microorganism quantification323334, the RT-LAMP assay can also be applied in human DNA quantification. Therefore, the RT-LAMP method can be used for the determination of trace amounts of DNA of interest among copious background DNA, such as specific mutation detection in circulating tumour DNA2435, and can be applied for complex gene quantification, which is clinically meaningful3637.\n\nIn summary, as a rapid, feasible and cost-efficient point-of-care (POC) SNP detection method, we demonstrated that RT-LAMP could quantitatively detect human genomic DNA with high specificity and sensitivity in a single step. Moreover, the LAMP method can amplify few copies of template to significant levels in 30 min11 and can be used for both DNA and RNA targets38. Thus, this POC detection method should be helpful in basic research in a variety of fields, including medicine, pharmaceuticals, environmental hygiene, food security, and pharmacogenomics testing.\n\nPeripheral blood samples were collected from 100 unrelated Chinese volunteers using EDTA-coated tubes at the Shaanxi Provincial People\u2019s Hospital (Xi\u2019an, China) with informed consent. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the National Engineering Research Center for Miniaturized Detection Systems, Xi\u2019an, China. All methods were performed in accordance with these approved guidelines. The genomic DNA from the volunteer was isolated from 200 \u03bcL of blood using a Whole Blood Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (Xi\u2019an GoldMag Nanobiotech Co., Ltd., Xi\u2019an, Shaanxi, China), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The final DNA quality and concentrations were measured using a NanoDrop 2000c/2000 UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n\nFor each SNP, six primers for RT-LAMP were designed, including two outer primers (common primers, F3 and B3) and four inner primers (specific primers, FIP-G, FIP-A, BIP-G and BIP-A) that recognize distinct regions of the CYP2C19*2 and CYP2C19*3 alleles (rs4244285 and rs4986893). Conventional PCR primers were designed based on the principle of AS-PCR using the Primer 5.0 software program (Primer-E Ltd., Plymouth, UK). All oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by Invitrogen Biotechnology Ltd. (Shanghai, China).\n\nPlasmids 19-2GG, 19-2AA, 19-3GG and 19-3AA, which contain the CYP2C19*2 G681G, CYP2C19*2 A681A, CYP2C19*3 G636G, and CYP2C19*3 A636A genes, respectively, were constructed using the pMDTM19-T Vector Cloning Kit (Takara Bio Inc. Dalian, China) and were extracted from transformed Escherichia coli DH5\u03b1 cells using a TIANprep Mini Plasmid Kit (Tiangen Biotech Co., Ltd. Beijing, China). The plasmids were identified via sequencing by Beijing Genomic Institute (BGI, Beijing, China). The concentrations were determined using a NanoDrop 2000c/2000 UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA).\n\nThe initial condition of the RT-LAMP reaction was adopted from Zhang et al.39. The LAMP reaction mixtures were incubated for 45 min at 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, or 65 \u00b0C to determine the optimal reaction temperature. Then, the LAMP reaction was performed at the optimal reaction temperature for 15, 30, 45, 60, and 90 min to determine the optimal reaction time.\n\nFor optimized AS-PCR, the reactions were performed using final volumes of 50 \u03bcL, including 25 \u03bcL 2  \u00d7  Taq MasterMix (containing Taq DNA polymerase, dNTPs, Mg2+, and Taq reaction buffer, Tiangen Biotech Co., Ltd. Beijing, China), 0.4 \u03bcM each primer, and 1.0 \u03bcL template DNA. All of the amplifications were performed using a 2720 Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) with the following parameters: one step of 5 min at 95 \u00b0C; 32 cycles of 30 s at 95 \u00b0C, 30 s at 60 \u00b0C, 45 s at 72 \u00b0C; and one step of 10 min at 72 \u00b0C. All PCR products were detected by electrophoresis on a 2.5% (w/v) agarose gel containing GoldView Nucleic Acid Stain (an alternative to ethidium bromide, Xi\u2019an Heart Biological Technology Co., Ltd. Xi\u2019an, Shaanxi, China) in 1  \u00d7  TAE buffer (pH 8.0) and were visualized under UV light.\n\nFor the samples to be sequenced, a 226-bp fragment for CYP2C19*2 and a 450-bp fragment for CYP2C19*3 were amplified using sequencing primers (Table 1). The PCR products were sequenced by the Beijing Genomic Institute (Beijing, China).\n\nThe sensitivities were assessed using the optimized RT-LAMP assay with 10-fold serial dilutions of plasmids. A standard curve was generated by plotting Tpeek values against relative input copy numbers.\n\nTo evaluate the feasibility of RT-LAMP in clinical applications, 100 peripheral blood samples were tested with Tris-EDTA buffer as the negative control. All of the samples were also further verified by conventional PCR and direct sequencing.\n\nHow to cite this article: Zhang, C. et al.
