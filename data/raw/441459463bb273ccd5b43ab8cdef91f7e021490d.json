{"title": "Rapid diagnosis of avian infectious bronchitis virus by the polymerase chain reaction", "body": "Avian infectious bronchitis viruses are members of the Coronaviridae family, enveloped viruses containing single-stranded RNA of positive polarity (Boursnell et al., 1989 and Cavanagh, 1991; Pascucci and Franciosi, 1991) . The disease can be controlled by vaccination of chicken flocks; nevertheless, outbreaks still occur in vaccinated flocks due to the lack of cross-protection against antigenically unrelated serotypes and variant strains of the virus (Gelb et al., 1991; King, 1988; Capua et al., 1994; Jia et al., 1995) . Early diagnosis is essential for effective control of an outbreak.\n\nIBV infection in chickens is diagnosed currently by virus isolation and identification, using embryonated chicken eggs, by serological tests, electron microscopy, tracheal organ culture, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Lukert, 1975; O.I.E., 1992) .\n\nThe above-mentioned methods are expensive, labor intensive and often give inconclusive results, hence the development of an alternative diagnostic method for a sensitive, specific and more rapid detection of IBV is warranted. This can be accomplished by the polymerase chain reaction technique (Saiki et al., 1985) which has also provided new diagnostic opportunities in veterinary medicine, (Belak and Ballagi-Pordany, 1993) .\n\nIn the case of IBV, a specific genomic region of the virus was amplified by PCR by Andreasen et al. (1991) Twelve specimens, collected from naturally infected unvaccinated chicken flocks, were obtained by Dr P. Massi (Forli, Italy). Each sample, derived from a single animal with acute respiratory disease, consisted of a pool of trachea, lung, kidney and cecal tonsils tissues.\n\nThe presence of IBV in these samples was determined by virus isolation in embryonated eggs, by an immunodiffusion test and by electron microscopy (Lukert, 1975; O.I.E., 1992) .\n\nControls for specificity included a Canine Coronavirus (CCV), (held virus isolate, kindly supplied by Prof. Buonavoglia, Inst. Microbiology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine. Bari), and an unrelated avian virus, Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV), (field isolate, authors' Laboratory collection). Allantoic fluid from uninoculated embryonated eggs and a mixture of tissues homogenates from a healthy bird were used as negative control.\n\nA region of IBV genome, showing the highest degree of conservation between the nucleocapsid protein of different Coronaviruses (Boursnell et al., 1985; Sutou et al., 1988; Zwaagstra et al., 1992) was selected at the N-terminus of the nucleocapsid gene (N). Four oligonucleotide primers (M-Medical srl/Genenco, Firenzejltaly) (IBV 1 to IBV4) were designed as showed in Table 1 .\n\nThe outer span, including primers IBVl and IBV2, was 316 bp and the inner span, including primers IBV3 and IBV4, was 240 bp.\n\nRNA fastTM-II kit (Molecular Systems, San DiegoCA) was used to extract RNA from 300 /II of allantoic fluid from 9911 day old SPF embryonated chicken eggs inoculated with different IBV strains and from 10 mg of each pool of infected tissues.\n\nOnly field virus isolates were treated with a RNA binding resin, included in the kit.\n\nRNA fast solution (900 ~1) and 0.2 ml of chloroform were added to each sample, refrigerated on ice for 5 min and centrifugated at 12 000 x g (4\u00b0C). The aqueous phase, resulting from centrifugation and containing RNA, was mixed with 0.5 vol of isopropanol and kept at -20\u00b0C for 1 h. RNA was pelleted at 12 000 x g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C; the pellet was washed with 1 ml of 75% ethanol by vortexing for 30 s and spinning for approximately 1 min. RNA pellet was dissolved in 3 ~1 of DEPC treated water (Sigma) and processed to RT-PCR reaction.\n\nReverse Transcription (RT) and PCR were conducted in the same PCR buffer (Perkin Elmer Cetus, Norwalk, CT.) (10 mM Tris-HCl pH8.3, 50 mM KCl), and performed in the same Eppendorf tube. A mixture of 200 ng of the 'downstream' primer IBV2 and 3 ,ul of the RNA template was incubated at 65\u00b0C for 5 min and then cooled on ice. The RNA-primer mixture was adjusted to a final volume of 20 ~1 containing PCR buffer, 5 mM MgCl,, 1 mM each of dNTPs and 50 U of reverse transcriptase (Moloney murine leukemia virus RT) (Perkin Elmer Cetus) Table 1 Nucleotide sequence, melting temperature and locations\" of the primers used for PCR\n\nMelting temper-Location ature (\"C) followed by an incubation at 42\u00b0C for 40 min. The reverse-transcriptase was then inactivated by heating the mixture to 95\u00b0C for 5 min.\n\nPCR was carried out in a two-step reaction, first with a pair of primers flanking the region to be amplified (IBVl and IBV2) and then using a pair of primers within the amplified sequence (IBV3 and IBV4) in a total volume of 100 ~1.\n\nVarious conditions regarding the concentration of MgCl,, primers, cycles number and annealing temperature were tested using the Beaudette strain of IBV as a reference strain. Optimisation of these parameters resulted in the following standard procedure:\n\nto the cDNA mixture, 200 ng of the 'upstream' primer IBVl, 2.5 U of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Perkin Elmer, Cetus), PCR buffer and MgCl,, 2 mM were added. Each sample was overlaid with 80 ~1 of mineral oil (Perkin Elmer, Cetus) to prevent evaporation.\n\nThe DNA was denaturated at 95\u00b0C for 5 min and the amplification undertaken in a DNA thermal cycler 480 (Perkin-Elmer, Cetus) by a 'hot start' procedure (Chou et al., 1992) .\n\nThe first round of amplification consisted of 30 cycles (denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 1 min, annealing at 49\u00b0C for 2 min and polymerization at 72\u00b0C for 3 min); the extension time during the final cycle was increased to 10 min to complete cDNA synthesis on all strands.\n\nIn addition, a second round of amplification of 25 cycles using the inner pair of primers was performed:\n\na 20-fold dilution in distilled water of the first PCR product was used as a template under the same reaction conditions as in the first PCR. Viral RNA was extracted by a rapid procedure from the allantoic fluid of SPF embryonated chicken eggs and from the supernatant of VERO cell-line inoculated with different strains of IBV. Total extracted RNA was used as a template to produce cDNA using the primer IBV2. The cDNA of all the tested IBV strains was equally amplified with the selected primers. Amplicons appeared to be of the predicted size of 3 16 bp when electrophoresed with a molecular weight standard in an ethidium bromide stained agarose gel. Water control, included to monitor the possibility of cross contamination, did not show any visible band in the gel (Fig. 1A) .\n\nThe primer set did not appear to amplify the aspecific RNAs, included as further controls in the test (data not shown). \n\nRNA extracted from each field virus isolate was directly subjected to RT-PCR, as described.\n\nIBV diagnosis is quite complex and time consuming: several passages in chicken embryos are required before field strains of IBV can produce typical lesions (King and Cavanagh, 1991 ).\n\nAll the samples tested showed the expected amplification products in agarose gel electrophoresis, thus, confirming the diagnosis of IBV performed using different classical tecniques. Pooled tissues from a healthy animal did not show any specific band on the gel ( Fig. 2A) .\n\nTo address this issue, a rapid and simple RNA extraction procedure combined with a reverse transcription and a double-PCR amplification protocol using primers homologous to a highly conserved region of the IBV genome was developed.\n\nThe final assay protocol aimed at being as simple as possible to allow its use on a large number of field samples and non isotopic.\n\nThe specificity of the PCR reaction was confirmed by a second PCR using inner primers within the target sequence.\n\nNested-PCR detected the IBV-RNA sequences in all the IBV-positive samples, showing a single band at the expected site ( Fig. 1B and Fig. 2B ).\n\nIn practical terms, this novel technique allows a marked reduction in the handling of the specimens and reduces the time required for the diagnosis by eliminating the complex adaptation of field isolates to the growth in intermediate substrates.
