{"title": "Human bocavirus amongst an all\u2010ages population hospitalised with acute lower respiratory infections in Cambodia", "body": "Human bocavirus (HBoV) is a novel parvovirus that was first identified in pools of nasopharyngeal aspirates obtained from individuals with respiratory tract infections in 2005.\n1\n The HBoV genome has three open reading frames encoding the 2 non\u2010structural proteins NS1 and NP1, and the structural viral capsid proteins VP1 and VP2.\n2\n, \n3\n There are four closely related HBoV genotypes, HBoV\u20101, HBoV\u20102 (consisting of HBoV\u20102A and HBoV\u20102B strains), HBoV\u20103 and HBoV\u20104, all of which share the same genomic organisation.\n3\n, \n4\n HBoV\u20101, the genotype initially identified by Schildgen et al.\n\n5\n in Sweden, has since been detected worldwide. HBoV\u20102\u20104 were mainly identified in stool samples.\n6\n, \n7\n\n\n\nHomology at the protein level between the four HBoV genotypes is high, between 70 and 90%.\n3\n HBoV\u20103 is thought by some to be the result of a recombination event between HBoV\u20101 and HBoV\u20102, owing to the similarity of the HBoV\u20103 NS1 and V1V2 genes to those of HBoV\u20101 and HBoV\u20102, respectively.\n6\n Indeed, HBoV\u20103 is likely detected along with HBoV\u20101 during routine diagnostic screening, as the conserved NS1 genes regularly targeted for testing are genetically similar.\n\nIn patients where HBoV is the only virus detected, the clinical symptoms reported are similar to those occurring as a result of infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (HMPV), including bronchiolitis, bronchitis, pneumonia and exacerbation of asthma.\n5\n Predominantly HBoV\u20101, but also HBoV\u20102 DNA, has been detected in respiratory samples,\n8\n whereas all four genotypes have been detected in stool samples, demonstrating that HBoV replication is not limited to the respiratory tract as first thought.\n4\n, \n8\n Indeed, up to 25% of patients with HBoV infection report gastrointestinal symptoms.\n8\n, \n9\n, \n10\n, \n11\n Hence, the tropism of strains belonging to HBoV genotypes 1\u20134 remains unknown.\n\nThe seasonality of HBoV infection is also unclear, with seasonal\n12\n, \n13\n, \n14\n and year\u2010round\n15\n, \n16\n, \n17\n transmission reported. The clinical significance of HBoV infection is also yet to be fully elucidated, as HBoV is frequently detected in association with additional respiratory pathogens. In the absence of an established cell culture system or animal model, the pathogenicity and replication mechanisms of HBoV remain unclear.\n5\n, \n18\n, \n19\n A recent report suggests that HBoV is, however, a true respiratory pathogen capable of causing sometimes severe, and even life\u2010threatening, illness.\n20\n\n\n\nHere, we report the findings of the first study investigating the prevalence, seasonality, clinical characteristics and the molecular epidemiology of HBoV in amongst an all\u2010ages population of patients hospitalized for acute lower respiratory illness (ALRI) in Cambodia over 3 consecutive years.\n\nDuring April 2007\u2013December 2009, all patients admitted with symptoms of ALRI to Takeo (southern Cambodia) and Kampong Cham (central\u2010north Cambodia) provincial hospitals were recruited into this study.\n21\n The age\u2010specific criteria used to diagnose ALRI cases and severe ALRI cases were defined previously.\n21\n Samples were collected, transported and stored as described.\n21\n Additional clinical specimens and data, including sputum samples for bacteria identification and chest X\u2010rays, were collected from patients where possible.\n\nSamples were screened by multiplex RT\u2010PCR/PCR at the Institut Pasteur in Cambodia for 18 respiratory viruses including RSV, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), HBoV, Influenza A and B viruses, coronaviruses OC43, 229E, HKU1 and NL63, severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2010associated coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV), parainfluenza viruses 1\u20134, adenoviruses, rhinovirus and enterovirus, as previously reported.\n21\n, \n22\n Samples that tested positive for HBoV were included in this study.\n\nThe National Ethics Committee of Cambodia approved this study. All patients/parents of sick children who participated provided written informed consent.\n\nViral DNA from nasopharyngeal samples was extracted using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) as per the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. DNA was eluted in a final volume of 200 \u03bcl Qiagen AE buffer and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until required.\n\nBoth HBoV and human Albumin DNA were amplified in parallel from each sample. Amplification of human Albumin DNA was performed as described.\n23\n To identify strains belonging to HBoV groups 1, 2 and 3, strain\u2010specific primers were used. To identify HBoV\u20101 strains, a 354\u2010bp fragment of the conserved HBoV\u20101 NP\u20101 gene was targeted using published primers.\n1\n The forward and reverse primers correspond to positions 2281 and 2634 of the NP\u20101 gene of the HBoV prototype strain St1 (Genbank accession number DQ000495). Thermocycling was performed using Go\u2010Taq Flexi DNA polymerase (Promega, Madisson, WI, USA) under the following conditions: PCR activation at 94\u00b0C for 2 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 30 seconds, annealing at 59\u00b75\u00b0C for 30 seconds, extension at 72\u00b0C for 1 minute and a final extension cycle of 72\u00b0C for 10 minutes. All samples were also screened by PCR for the presence of HBoV2 and HBoV3 DNA, as described.\n8\n\n\n\nFor phylogenetic analysis, a 819\u2010bp region of the variable HBoV\u20101 V1/V2 gene was amplified using published primers.\n9\n Primers correspond to positions 4370\u20134387, and 5172\u20135189 of the HBoV prototype strain St1 genome (Genbank accession number DQ000495). Thermocycling was performed using Go\u2010Taq Flexi DNA polymerase (Promega) under the following conditions: PCR activation at 94\u00b0C for 2 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 1 minute, annealing at 54\u00b0C for 1 minute, extension at 72\u00b0C for 2 minutes and a final extension cycle of 72\u00b0C for 10 minutes.\n\nEach PCR contained the appropriate positive and negative controls. All PCR products were visualised using ethidium bromide under UV light on a 1\u00b75% agarose gel. When required, PCR products were purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction protocol of the QIAquick PCR Purification kit (Qiagen) as per the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, prior to sequencing. Single\u2010pass sequencing reactions were performed at a contract sequencing facility using the ABI BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit on an ABI 3730XL automatic DNA Analyser (Macrogen, Seoul, Korea).\n\nConsensus sequences were generated using clc main workbench software, version 5\u00b76\u00b71 (http://www.clcbio.com). Nucleotide sequences of reference HBoV strains were obtained from Genbank and used to construct alignments and phylogeny (\nTable 1\n). Cambodian and reference HBoV nucleotide sequences were aligned using the clustal w alignment program of mega software, version 4\u00b70.\n24\n The average pairwise Jukes\u2010Cantor distance was found to be 0\u00b701 for both of the HBoV NP1 and VP1/VP2 alignments, indicating that the data were suitable to generate neighbour\u2010Joining trees.\n25\n neighbour\u2010Joining trees were constructed using the p\u2010distance nucleotide substitution model, with 1000 bootstrap replicates, using mega 4\u00b70 software. Pairwise nucleotide distances (p distance), the proportion of sites at which nucleotide sequences differ divided by the total number of nucleotides compared, were calculated using the pairwise distance function of mega software version 4\u00b70. Pairwise amino acid distances (p distance), the proportion of sites at which amino acid sequences differ divided by the total number of residues compared, were calculated using the Poisson model in the pairwise distance function of mega software version 4\u00b70.\n\nDeduced partial amino acid sequences of Cambodian NP1 and VP1/VP2 strains were generated by translating nucleotide sequences with the standard genetic code using mega software version 4\u00b70. Potential N\u2010glycosylation sites were predicted by the NXT motif, where X is not a proline; potential O\u2010glycosylation sites were predicted by the KPXn motif (where X is any amino acid).\n26\n, \n27\n, \n28\n, \n29\n\n\n\nThe nucleotide sequences of HBoV strains obtained in this study were deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers JQ618248 to JO618263 (NP1 sequences) and JQ618264 to JQ618278 (VP1/VP2 sequences).\n\nSequences were successfully obtained from 19 (44\u00b72%) samples: 16 NP\u20101 gene and 15 VP1/VP2 gene sequences. Both NP\u20101 and VP1/VP2 sequences were successfully amplified from 12 (63%) samples. All Cambodian HBoV strains were classified as HBoV\u20101 (2, 3).\n\nOf the samples from which HBoV\u20101 sequences were obtained, one was collected in 2007, nine in 2008 and nine in 2009 (2, 3). Twelve (63%) samples were collected in Takeo province, and seven (37%) were collected in Kampong Cham province, but the patient recruitment was also higher in Takeo than in Kampong Cham hospital (data not shown).\n\nPairwise distance (p distance) analysis revealed very high conservation of NP\u20101 gene sequences amongst the Cambodian HBoV\u20101 strains. Homology at the nucleotide (nt) level varied between 98\u00b79 and 100%. Identity at the amino acid (aa) level was slightly lower, between 96\u00b77 and 100%. The NP\u20101 gene is highly conserved between strains, and however, we identified 5 different non\u2010synonymous mutations present in Cambodian NP\u20101 sequences relative to the prototype HBoV\u20101 strain St1 (Figure 4). The observed nt mutations resulted in the following 5 aa substitutions: Ser92 (100% conservation amongst Cambodian NP\u20101 sequences), Asn44 (65%), Asn59 (12%), Ser47 (6%), Arg53 (6%) (Figure 4). We observed 1 potential N\u2010glycosylation site, starting at amino acid position 86, which was conserved amongst all reference and Cambodian HBoV strains analysed (Figure 4).\n\nHomology at the nt level was also very high amongst the partial VP1/VP2 gene sequences, between 97\u00b71 and 100%. Homology at the aa level was slightly lower, between 96\u00b76 and 100%.\n\nPresent on the surface of the virion, the VP1/VP2 protein is potentially subjected to strong selective pressure from the host immune response. Relative to the reference strains St1 and St2, 8 non\u2010synonymous nt mutations resulting in the following aa substitutions were observed amongst Cambodian VP1/VP2 gene sequences: His546 (66%), Leu631 (26%), Tyr540 (26%), Thr650 (13%), Ser466 (6%), Pro490 (6%), Gln493 (6%) and Lys545 (6%) (Figure 5). One additional nt mutation resulting in the aa substitution Ser590, present in reference strain St2 but not St1, was conserved amongst all of the Cambodian VP1/VP2 sequences investigated (Figure 5). A stop codon was present at position 672 in all reference and Cambodian VP1/VP2 sequences included in this study (Figure 5).\n\nTwo potential N\u2010glycosylation sites, located at amino acid positions 519 and 638, were conserved amongst the reference isolates and all of the Cambodian VP1/VP2 sequences investigated (Figure 5). One potential O\u2010glycosylation site was identified, located at amino acid position 552, which was also conserved amongst the reference isolates and all of the Cambodian VP1/VP2 sequences analysed (Figure 5).\n\nHere, we report the results of the first study to investigate the incidence and genetic diversity of HBoV amongst hospitalised patients in Cambodia. Seasonality of HBoV infection was not observed in this study, confirming the results of Buecher et al.,\n22\n who previously investigated viral causes of influenza\u2010like illness (ILI) amongst Cambodian out\u2010patients.\n\nGlobally, the incidence of HBoV infection has been reported to range from 1\u00b75 to 19%.\n30\n Overall, the incidence of HBoV infection amongst the all\u2010ages population of Cambodian patients hospitalised with ALRI was 1\u00b75%, which did not vary annually and was lower than that reported regionally.\n31\n, \n32\n, \n33\n, \n34\n Amongst the same population, the incidence of HBoV was similar to that of HMPV (1\u00b77%),\n21\n but lower than RSV (8\u00b72%).\n35\n A number of factors can influence incidence estimates, including disease severity amongst the population investigated, study design, testing protocols and sensitivity of diagnostic tests used, especially as low viral loads are common in HBoV infections.\n5\n In this study, ALRI patient samples were screened for HBoV infection using a highly sensitive multiplex PCR assay previously shown to have a lower limit of detection of 4 copies of HBoV DNA/\u03bcl of viral transport medium.\n22\n Therefore, the low incidence of HBoV infection observed amongst the Cambodian ALRI population was not a result of limited sensitivity of the diagnostic test used.\n\nThe proportion of HBoV infections detected amongst hospitalised Cambodian ALRI patients was significantly higher compared to that of Cambodian outpatients with ILI (1\u00b75% versus 0\u00b74%, P = 0\u00b702).\n22\n The higher incidence of HBoV infection amongst ALRI patients was not thought to be a result of a high carriage rate within the population. In parallel, the incidence of HBoV infection amongst Cambodian ILI outpatients and asymptomatic controls was investigated previously, with only one asymptomatic individual testing positive for HBoV DNA.\n22\n However, persistent and prolonged shedding is a characteristic of parvoviruses, and it is thought that low\u2010level asymptomatic shedding can persist following HBoV infection.\n20\n, \n36\n, \n37\n Two independent studies reported the HBoV carriage rate to be 43% amongst asymptomatic children,\n38\n and that the incidence of HBoV amongst asymptomatic children was higher than amongst symptomatic children.\n39\n However, these two studies were conducted amongst children aged <2 years. Hence, the high carriage rate may have been biased towards the very young age of the sample population with HBoV incidence highest amongst children aged <2 years.\n1\n, \n9\n, \n40\n Amongst a population of slightly older children, up to 5 years of age, Brieu et al.\n\n36\n reported that HBoV DNA was not detected following testing of asymptomatic children. In the absence of an established continuous culture system, it is currently unclear to what extent shedding occurs following HBoV infection, whether shedding and carriage rates amongst children and adults are equivalent, and whether shedding is innocuous or infectious. However, the higher incidence of HBoV infection amongst hospitalised Cambodian ALRI patients observed in this study relative to outpatients with ILI suggests that HBoV infection can result in severe illness.\n\nTwenty\u2010four (56%) of the HBoV\u2010infected individuals tested positive for infection with HBoV only, of which 14 patients were classified as severe respiratory infection, including three patients aged <1 year who presented with severe pneumonia (data not shown). Indeed, pneumonia was the most common clinical diagnosis amongst the ALRI patients investigated, regardless of age. This finding was consistent with the results of similar studies in which HBoV\u20101 infection has been associated with severe respiratory illness, including pneumonia,\n20\n, \n32\n, \n40\n, \n41\n, \n42\n bronchiolitis or bronchitis.\n36\n, \n38\n, \n39\n, \n40\n Amongst a study of children aged <2 years hospitalised for acute asthma, HBoV was the predominant virus detected.\n43\n Recently, a severe case of HBoV infection resulting in acute respiratory failure was reported, in which HBoV was the only pathogen detected.\n20\n The possibility that clinical illness amongst the Cambodian HBoV\u2010infected patients was exacerbated because of bacterial co\u2010infection cannot, however, be excluded as testing for bacterial co\u2010infection could not be performed because of a lack of suitable specimens obtained from young participants.\n\nWhether HBoV represents a true pathogen, or an opportunistic co\u2010pathogen, has been the source of much debate.\n2\n, \n5\n A primary reason that the role of HBoV as a sole pathogenic agent is questioned is that HBoV is commonly detected as a co\u2010infection. Globally, the frequency of HBoV\u20101 co\u2010infection with other respiratory viruses amongst children with lower respiratory tract infection is reported to be as high as 83%.\n4\n, \n5\n, \n44\n Furthermore, it has been reported that HBoV co\u2010infection may be higher amongst hospitalised individuals compared with those with mild illness as shedding is potentially enhanced by airway inflammation resulting from co\u2010infection with an additional respiratory pathogen, or that HBoV may play a role in enhancing or aggravating symptoms of existing infections.\n5\n Mechanisms proposed to explain the high rate of co\u2010infection with other respiratory viruses include that HBoV is either a helper virus, facilitating replication of other respiratory pathogens or that HBoV may require a helper virus to facilitate productive infection.\n45\n It must also be considered that the more recent widespread use of highly sensitive multiplex assays enabling simultaneous detection of multiple pathogens in a single patient sample may also contribute to the high rate of co\u2010infection with HBoV and additional respiratory pathogens detected. In this study, 44% of patients were co\u2010infected with HBoV and an additional respiratory virus. Regionally, the reported rate of HBoV co\u2010infections varies and does not appear to be particularly associated with hospitalisation: 42% amongst hospitalized children in Singapore,\n32\n 90% amongst out\u2010patient children aged <5 years in rural Thailand,\n37\n 9% amongst hospitalised children in Vietnam.\n31\n In this study, co\u2010infection with HBoV and HRhV was most frequently detected (Table 3), analogous to the findings of a similar study conducted amongst paediatric patients in rural Thailand.\n37\n Whether the high frequency of HBoV and HRhV co\u2010infection is a reflection of the high incidence of HRhV circulating in the general population\n2\n or whether HRhV co\u2010infection is beneficial to HBoV replication and pathogenesis remains unknown. In the absence of an established cell culture system or animal model, much remains unclear regarding the pathogenesis of HBoV.\n\nAll of the HBoV strains obtained from respiratory specimens for analysis in this study were classified as HBoV\u20101. Globally, HBoV\u20101 strains have been reported to show low nucleotide and protein diversity; mean genetic diversity <1% at nt and <0\u00b75% at aa levels.\n44\n Comparatively, the diversity of HBoV\u20102, \u20103 and \u20104 strains, all identified in stool species, is far greater.\n8\n The low level of diversity reported worldwide amongst HBoV\u20101 strains has resulted in speculation that HBoV\u20101 evolved recently from the enteric bocavirus species, acquiring tropism for cells of the respiratory tract.\n8\n, \n46\n The organisation of the HBoV genome is similar to that of other Parvoviruses, namely that the non\u2010structural proteins are encoded by conserved genomic regions, whereas diversity is concentrated in regions encoding the capsid proteins.\n45\n Analysis of amino acid sequences obtained from Cambodian HBoV\u20101 strains revealed 0\u20132\u00b79% nt diversity and 0\u20133\u00b74% aa diversity amongst VP1/VP2 sequences. Greater variation amongst sequences encoding the VP1/VP2 capsid proteins was anticipated as VP1/VP2 is under pressure from host immune responses. The level of diversity amongst Cambodian NP1 sequences was 0\u20131\u00b71% at the nt level, which is similar to that recently reported by Kapoor et al.\n\n46\n Surprisingly, the level of diversity at the aa level amongst NP1 sequences was equivalent to that observed for VP1/VP2 sequences, at 0\u20133\u00b73%. Five amino acid substitutions were observed amongst Cambodian NP1 aa sequences, including Asn599 that has been reported previously by Ma et al.,\n47\n following analysis of HBoV\u20101 NP1 sequences obtained from Japanese children with ALRI. The observed diversity amongst Cambodian NP\u20101 sequences may have occurred as a result of immune pressure, as it was recently reported that the HBoV non\u2010structural proteins, including NP1, are targeted by humoral responses.\n30\n The potential impact, if any, of non\u2010synonymous mutations within this conserved region of the HBoV\u20101 genome remains unclear and warrants further investigation.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, we present the results of the first study to investigate the circulation and diversity of HBoV infection amongst hospitalised patients in Cambodia. We demonstrate that similar to the findings of other studies, HBoV infection can result in serious illness, however is frequently detected in the context of viral co\u2010infection. Ongoing studies are required to further understand the true pathogenesis of HBoV\u20101 in the context of severe respiratory illness."}
