{"title": "Cytokine Activation Patterns and Biomarkers Are Infl uenced by fl Microorganisms in Community-Acquired Pneumonia Downloaded from 12 (5-24) NS", "body": "T he respiratory tract is constantly exposed to environmental agents and potentially pathogenic micro organisms. The ciliated epithelium, alveolar macrophages, and neutrophils are able to destroy and remove pathogenic agents and prevent the progression of tissue invasion. 1, 2 When the innate response is overcome, local reactions, with activation of cytokines and infl ammatory markers, promote a specific fi immune response against the microorganism. 2 This reaction is not limited to the lungs; there is also a systemic response that has repercussions on the course of the infection and its outcome. 1, 3, 4 Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the leading cause of mortality due to infection in developed countries. 5 The host infl ammatory response is crucial fl to fi ghting the microorganism, and that interplay determines the outcome. Nevertheless, the mechanisms that trigger activation of the cytokine cascade and its different patterns (responsible for the outcome) are not suffi ciently understood. An exuberant systemic activation of cytokines has been associated with a poorer outcome, although in some patients it is an adequate response, suggesting that this feature is far from understood. 6 Kellum et al 6 pointed out the Cytokines, PCT, and CRP Blood samples were taken the morning after admission, and the serum was frozen at 280\u00b0C. Determination of IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 and TNF-a was made using an enzyme immunoassay (Biosource). Limits of detection were 3 pg/mL for TNF-a , 2 pg/mL for IL-6, 0.7 pg/mL for IL-8, and 1 pg/mL for IL-10. PCT was measured using an immunoluminometric technique (Liason Brahms PCT) with a detection limit of 0.3 ng/mL and CRP using an immunoturbidimetric test (Bayer Diagnostics) with a detection limit of 1.5 mg/dL.\n\nThe following studies were carried out: (1) blood cultures (n 5 575), (2) urinary antigens for Legionella pneumophila (n 5626) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n 5 628), (3) sputum Gram stain (n 5 319) (,10 epithelial cells and . 25 leukocytes per field fi 3100) and culture, (4) nasopharyngeal swab (n 5 162) to detect viral nucleic acids, (5) paired serologic studies (n 5 629) for Chlamydophila pneumoniae , Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Coxiella burnetii, and L pneumophila , and (6) invasive samples (n 592) obtained by bronchoscopy and/or pleural fluid. fl\n\nBacterial cause was established using the following criteria:\n\n(1) isolation of microorganisms in respiratory samples above the cutoffs (BAL \u0546 10 4 colony-forming units/mL; bronchoaspirate sample \u0546 10 5 colony-forming units/mL) or in pleural fl uid, (2) isolation of one predominant microorganism in sputum or L pneumophila in buffered charcoal yeast extract agar, (3) microorganisms in blood culture, (4) positive urinary antigens, (5) seroconversion or fourfold antibody increase with titers of IgG \u0546 1:512 for C pneumoniae , \u0546 1:160 for M pneumoniae and C burnetii, or IgM \u0546 1:32 for C pneumoniae and \u0546 1:80 for M pneumoniae and C burnetii , 8 and (6) positive detection of viral nucleic acids: ProDetect BCS RV CHIP (bcs Biotech SpA) for infl uenza virus A and B (gen NS), respiratory syncytial virus (gen NS2), parainfl uenza virus I, II, and III (gen HN), SARS coronavirus (fragment BNI-1), and adenovirus (gen H).\n\nThe statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS software (version 15.0; SPSS Inc). PCT, CRP , and cytokines were presented as medians and interquartile ranges, and parametric data as mean \u03ee SD. The hypotheses were tested using the Mann-Whitney U test. Signifi cance was established at U P , .05. The microorganisms were analyzed individually and according to the following groups: no cause, bacteria subdivided into gram-positive cocci (GPC) and gram-negative bacilli (GNB), viruses, and atypical pathogens ( C pneumoniae, M pneumoniae , and C burnetii) .\n\nA multivariate Euclidean distance model was performed. The graphics were generated by means of a hierarchic cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling of the distance matrix based on the significant differences observed in the pair comparison of micro-fi organisms using the Mann-Whitney U test. U\n\nSix hundred eighty-fi ve patients were included, fi and in 295 (43%) a causal diagnosis was reached: 118 S pneumoniae (17.2%), 24 L pneumophila (3.5%), 18 Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.6%) , 14 Haemophilus influenzae fl (2%), 13 Staphylococcus aureus (1.9%), heterogeneous cytokine pattern activation with different combinations of high, medium, and low IL-6 and IL-10 levels, although they did not evaluate the infl uence of causal microorganisms. Our hypothesis is that causal microorganisms play a key role in the host response and may trigger different infl ammatory responses, depending on their intrinsic properties, the presence of a capsule, lipopolysaccharides in the cell wall, virulence factors, and infection spread. 1 Understanding the response of the host to the different pathogens is essential to increasing our knowledge of the course of infection in order to improve the diagnostic process and, possibly, for developing targeted therapeutic strategies.\n\nOur objective was to investigate the cytokine systemic activation patterns (tumor necrosis factor-a [TNF-a], IL-1 b, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10) together with the biomarkers procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) provoked by causal microorganisms in hospitalized patients with CAP. A secondary objective was to evaluate their usefulness in a causaldiagnosis approach. An abstract with some results has been published. 7\n\nWe performed a prospective study of hospitalized patients with CAP in two centers from \n\nPatients with a causal diagnosis showed higher CRP and PCT in comparison with those without, and the highest levels were found in those with bacteremia ( Table 2 ). The diagnostic value of PCT (\u0546 0.36) to predict bacteremia was as follows: 85% sensitivity, 42% specifi city (E), and 98% negative predictive value (NPV).\n\nThe medians of CRP, PCT, and cytokines depending on microorganisms are shown in Table 3 , and those depending on sepsis status and on hypoxemia or mechanical ventilation are shown in Tables 4 and 5 Table 1 .\n\nBacteremia was found in 48 cases (7%): 36 S pneumoniae , seven Enterobacteriaceae, three H influenzae fl fl , four S aureus , three P aeruginosa, one Streptococcus pyogenes and one Acinetobacter baumannii . Six of the cases were mixed infections due to several bacteria, principally S pneumoniae . Data are presented as median (interquartile range). AUC 5area under the curve; CRP 5 C-reactive protein; NS 5not significant; PCT fi 5procalcitonin; TNF-a 5 tumor necrosis factor-a. a AUC, 0.7 (0.6-0.8); a P , .001. b AUC, 0.7 (0.6-0.8); P , .0001. c AUC, 0.6 (0.5-0.7); P 5 .03. d AUC, 0.7 (0.6-0.7); P , .001.\n\nwere found in CAP caused by L pneumophila , Enterobacteriaceae , and S pneumoniae . PCT was also higher in S aureus . CRP and PCT were higher in sepsis in those with GPC and GNB compared with those with unknown cause, and, after stratifying for hypoxemia or mechanical ventilation, the medians were higher in GNB. The differences among causal groups and between S pneumoniae and L pneumophila are shown in Table 6 .\n\nPatients with a causal diagnosis had a higher IL-6 than those without, whereas those with bacteremia showed the highest IL-6 and TNF-a ( Table 2 ) . Causal microorganisms exhibited different cytokine patterns ( Table 3 ) : L pneumophila and S aureus had higher TNF-a, and the former also had higher IL-6; Enterobacteriaceae had higher IL-8, whereas influenza fl virus infections showed higher IL-10 (compared with bacteria, P P5 .03) and lower TNF-a . Concerning sepsis status ( Table 4 ) , IL-6 was higher in severe sepsis in those with GPC and GNB compared with those with unknown cause. In patients stratifi ed by hypoxemia and mechanical ventilation, those with GPC and GNB had higher IL-6 (and IL-8 in GNB) compared with those with unknown cause ( Table 5 ) .\n\nTwo hundred thirty-three patients (34%) had received antibiotics prior to admission and they had lower PCT (P P, .01), IL-6 (P P,.03 ), and IL-10 (P P,.01), and higher IL-8 ( P , .05) ( Table 7 ) . PCT was higher in those with known cause who did not take prior anti biotics compared with those who did (P 5 .02).\n\nStatistical differences among cytokines and biomarkers in microorganisms converted into distances in a Euclidean two-dimensional space are depicted in Figure 1 . We found three microorganisms with higher distances: L pneumophila , S pneumoniae, and Enterobacteriaceae; a close group of bacteria (S aureus , M pneumoniae , C pneumoniae , P aeruginosa, C burnetii , and H influenzae fl fl , together with influenza virus); fl and a third group close to this last group, unknowncause CAP. Hierarchic cluster analysis is also shown with microorganisms associated in similar cluster groups.\n\nThe most outstanding findings of this study were fi as follows: (1) The highest levels of cytokines, CRP, P P and PCT were found in patients who were bacteremic Data are presented as median (interquartile range). See Table 1 and the lowest in those with unknown cause; (2) the causal microorganisms elicited different inflamma fl tory a a cytokine patterns and biomarkers as corroborated in the Euclidean distances model; (3) a cutoff of PCT \u0545 0.5 to differentiate viruses or atypicals vs bacteria showed sensitivity of 89%/81%, specificity fi of 68%/68%, positive predictive value of 12%/22%, and NPV of 99%/97%; (4) PCT \u0546 0.36 had an excellent NPV (98%) for predicting positive blood cultures; and (5) L pneumophila CAP showed higher IL-8 and TNF-a compared with S pneumonia, with high NPV (89% and 94%, respectively).\n\nThe study of the infl ammatory profi fl le in CAP may fi provide better knowledge of the host-microorganism interplay and may be useful for causal diagnosis. PCT, CRP, and, to a lesser extent, cytokines were studied for their diagnostic ability in CAP. 3, [8] [9] [10] [11] Interestingly, biomarkers and IL-6 were signifi cantly lower when causal microorganisms were not found, even considering sepsis status, refl ecting a lower microorganism load or virulence. On the other hand, in bacteremia, biomarkers and IL-6 were signifi cantly higher, reflect-fl ing the greater dissemination of the infection, 12 which may be useful for selecting that specifi c CAP pop ulation. 8, 13 M\u00fcller et al 13 found that PCT \u0545 0.25 ng/mL allowed a 37% reduction of blood cultures with high specifi city. We chose a slightly higher cutoff (0.36 ng/mL) with very high NPV because we considered that a lower cutoff would include many atypicals and undiagnosed CAP. The role of cytokines in predicting bacteremia is less well known. We found that IL-6 \u0546 150 had an excellent NPV (96%).\n\nDespite the interest in knowing the influence of fl microorganisms on triggering different inflamma-fl tory patterns, publications on the subject are few. Masi\u00e1 et al 14 found lower PCT and CRP in atypicals compared with bacteria, although neither of them was useful for predicting that cause. Hedlund and Hansson 3 also reported lower PCT in atypical bacteria and/or viruses, with no differences in CRP. Our data confi rm that PCT \u05450.5 provides high sensitivity and NPV for viral and/or atypical causes. Kr\u00fcger Prior use of antibiotics reduced the levels of PCT and cytokines, mainly IL-6 and IL-10, suggesting that the infl ammatory phase was beginning to be downregulated. 11, 17 We consider that PCT-guided antibiotic prescription in CAP requires extreme caution in patients with prior antibiotic treatment because it could underestimate bacterial cause, 9, 10 and even in those without prior antibiotics it would appear that a low PCT has insuffi cient NPV to exclude pathogens. NPV (94%). We found that higher levels of TNF-a and IL-6 in L pneumophila had a high NPV compared with S pneumoniae. PCT and IL-8 showed different patterns among bacteria: higher IL-8 and lower PCT in gram-negative vs gram-positive germs. However, the clinical relevance of these findings fi has yet to be demonstrated, and it is possible that, for diag nostic purposes, several markers will be required. 16 as Toll-like receptor-9 in the case of L pneumophila , Toll-like receptor-4 in gram-negative bacteria, and Toll-like receptor-2 in gram-positive bacteria. [19] [20] [21] Enterobacteriaceae showed an increase in IL-8, 22 as reported in urinary infections. 23 Surprisingly, 3 P aeruginosa presented an infl ammatory response closer to that in CAP of unknown cause. This colonizing microorganism, which is associated with elderly patients or severe diseases, may take on importance depending on the characteristics of the patient; furthermore, it was associated with the use of oral or inhaled corticosteroids (nine patients). Infl uenza virus was associated with higher IL-10 24 and a lower TNF-a. This response profi le plays a detrimental role in the host responses against the infl uenza A virus, as found in animal models. 25 In fact, although IL-10 activates the On the other hand, IL-8 was raised, as reported in in vitro experiments, 18 probably because of enhanced cytokine secretion secondary to bacterial wall destruction. In fact, it was higher in those previously treated with b -lactams (12 vs 8.5, P 5 .06; data not shown).\n\nOur fi ndings highlight the differences in infl fi am-fl matory cytokine activation, which were corroborated in the Euclidean distances model. The scenario with the least infl ammation was found in unknown cause, whereas the greatest inflammation, though with spe-fl cific expressive patterns, was found in fi L pneumo phila, S pneumoniae , and Enterobacteriaceae . These distances refl ected differences in the inflammatory pro-fl fi les, probably due to variations in virulence and the fi recognition of different molecular patterns that activate different pathways and innate immunity, such \u054622 mg/dL as cutoff to compare L pneumophila and S pneumoniae : S, 70%; E, 59%; PPV, 27%; and NPV, 90%.

AUC, 0.7 (0.6-0.8); Blood cultures were not obtained from patients at the same time intervals within the initial 24 h. Lower limits of PCT assay could be inadequate in milder CAP.\n\nIn conclusion, the main causal agents of CAP presented different infl ammatory patterns, which gave each group of microorganisms a specific profile, although their usefulness in diagnosis was limited. In bacteremia, infl ammation was upregulated, whereas it was lowest in CAP of unknown cause. The most notable fi nding is that the knowledge of specifi fi c infl am-fi matory patterns should enable us to better understand the host response in CAP. Further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms that lead each microorganism to present its own inflammatory response fl and to better defi ne this response. natural killer lymphocytes and increases the anti gen volume available to stimulate the immune sys tem, 26 it has been shown that an increase of IL-6 and TNF-a protects against infl uenza virus pneumonia. 27 Our findings suggest that interpretation of cytokine fi cascade activation should take into account not only host characteristics and sepsis status, but also the causal microorganism, bacteremia, and prior antibiotic treatment. Further studies of treatments designed to modulate the cytokine response should be designed to consider microorganism-specifi c infl ammatory pat-fi terns. Prior failures of anticytokine treatments may be partially explained by this difference in cytokine patterns.\n\nNot all microbiologic studies were performed on the whole population and unknown cause may correspond to underdiagnosed viruses or bacteria.
