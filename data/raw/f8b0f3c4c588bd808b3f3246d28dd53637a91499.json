{"title": "Pneumonia Pathogen Characterization Is an Independent Determinant of Hospital Readmission", "body": "Hospital readmissions occur oft en and are diffi cult to predict. 1 In response to the recommendations in the 2007 Medicare Payment Advisory Commission report, many hospitals have dedicated staff eff orts and resources to identify patients at risk for readmission as well as to prevent such readmissions. 1, 2 Th e recommendations from the 2007 Medicare Payment Advisory Commission became the basis for the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program in the Aff ordable Care Act altering the criteria for hospital payment reimbursement. Th e Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has been charged with enforcement of these criteria by reducing Medicare payments to hospitals that exceed preset all-cause readmission rates. 1 For fi scal year 2013, the readmission penalties have been applied to three conditions: acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and pneumonia. By 2015, the policy is expected to include readmissions for COPD, coronary artery bypass graft surgery, percutaneous coronary interventions, and other vascular procedures. 3 In fi scal year 2013, the maximum payment reduction for hospitals with excess readmission rates was 1% but increases to 2% in 2014 and to 3% for 2015 and beyond. 4 \n\nTh e study was conducted at Barnes-Jewish Hospital, a 1,250-bed teaching hospital in St. Louis, Missouri. During a 6-year period (August 2007 to September 2013), patients with a discharge diagnosis of pneumonia were evaluated. Th e Washington University Human Research Protection Offi ce approved the protocol (HRPO number 201205194). Baseline characteristics were recorded at hospital admission: age, sex, race, BMI, and Charlson comorbidity score. 14 Hospital readmission was evaluated at 90 days. For purposes of pathogen characterization, patients were segregated according to the following categories: culture-negative pneumonia, pneumonia attributed to antibiotic-susceptible bacteria, pneumonia attributed to potentially antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and viral pneumonia.\n\nReadmission for any reason (ie, all-cause readmission) to an acute care facility in the 90 days following discharge served as the primary end point. Th e index hospital serves as the main teaching institution for BJC Healthcare, a large integrated health-care system of both inpatient and outpatient care. Th e system includes a total of 12 hospitals in a compact geographic region surrounding and including St. Louis, Missouri, and we included readmission to any of these hospitals in our analysis. People treated within this health-care system are, in nearly all cases, readmitted to one of the system's participating hospitals. If a patient who receives health care in the system presents to a nonsystem hospital, he/she is oft en transferred back into the integrated system because of issues of insurance coverage. Patients with a 90-day readmission were compared with those without a 90-day readmission. All data were derived from the informatics database provided by the Center for Clinical Excellence, BJC HealthCare.\n\nPneumonia was considered to be present if patients had an International Classifi cation of Diseases, Ninth Edition code indicative of pneumonia. Patients were also required to have the presence of a new or progressive radiographic infi ltrate plus at least two of the following: leukocytosis ( . 10 3 10 9 cells/L), leukopenia ( \u0545 4 3 10 9 cells/L), fever ( . 38.3\u00b0C), hypothermia ( \u0545 36.0\u00b0C), purulent secretions from the lower respiratory tract, or Pa o 2 /F io 2 , 300. Th e presence of a new or progressive radiographic infi ltrate was based on the interpretation of the chest radiograph by board-certifi ed radiologists blinded to the study. Pneumonia was classifi ed as culture negative if all respiratory cultures failed to identify a pathogen. Culture-positive pneumonia was defi ned as growth of a pathogenic organism from sputum, tracheal aspirate, or bronchoscopic or blind BAL fluid. Additionally, a positive urinary antigen test for Legionella qualified as a positive culture, as did positive qualitative nucleic acid multiplex tests for respiratory viruses Bordetella pertussis , Chlamydophila pneumonia , and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (FilmArray Respiratory Panel; BioFire Diagnostics ). If a patient had more than one episode of pneumonia during the index hospitalization, only the fi rst case was included in the analysis.\n\nAntibiotic-susceptible bacteria were classifi ed as those most commonly associated with community-acquired pneumonia (methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus , Streptococcus pneumoniae , Haemophilus infl uenzae , Moraxella catarrhalis ), whereas potentially antibiotic-resistant bacteria included those most oft en associated with nosocomial infections (methicillin-resistant S aureus , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Acinetobacter species). Enterobacteriaceae , such as Klebsiella species, were classifi ed according to their antibiotic susceptibility to ceft riaxone (ie, susceptible to ceft riaxone classifi ed as antibiotic susceptible). Viral pneumonia was deemed present when the initial microbiologic evaluation demonstrated a known respiratory virus. Microbiologic identifi cation of polymicrobial infection with antibiotic-susceptible and potentially antibiotic-resistant bacteria was classifi ed as the latter. Pneumonia was classifi ed as present on admission if radiographic and clinical criteria for pneumonia developed within 48 h of hospital admission. Hospital-acquired pneumo nia was defi ned as the occurrence of pneumonia criteria more than 48 h aft er admission, and ventilator-associated pneumonia was defi ned as meeting the pneumonia criteria aft er the onset of mechanical ventilation.\n\nTh e number of patients admitted to Barnes-Jewish Hospital having a diagnosis of pneumonia during the study period determined the Interventions aimed at preventing readmissions have not been universally successful. 5 One potential explanation for this is the inability to reliably predict which patients are at risk for readmission to target FOR EDITORIAL COMMENT SEE PAGE 4 readmission prevention interventions. Predictors of hospital readmission can be disease specifi c, such as presence of multivessel disease in patients hospitalized with myocardial infarction, 6 or more general, such as sex and timeliness of follow-up medical visits post discharge. 7-10 Specifi c pneumonia pathogens, generally antibiotic-resistant bacteria, have been associated with adverse patient outcomes to include greater lengths of stay and mortality. [11] [12] [13] However, pneumonia pathogen characterization has not been evaluated as a potential risk factor for readmission. Th erefore, we performed a study to examine the infl uence of pathogen characterization on the prevalence of 90-day readmission among hospitalized patients with pneumonia. sample size. Th e assessment of readmission was performed among hospital survivors. We used a x 2 test or Student t test, as appropriate, for univariate analyses. Th e Mann-Whitney U test was used for continuous, nonparametrically distributed data. All analyses were two-tailed, and a P value of , .05 was assumed to represent statistical signifi cance. We relied on logistic regression for identifying variables independently associated with 90-day readmission. Based on univariate analysis, variables signifi cant at P , .10 were entered into the model. To arrive at the most parsimonious model, we used a stepwise backward elimination approach. We evaluated colinearity with correlation matrices. We report adjusted ORs and 95% CIs where appropriate. We conducted a cross-validation of the model to assess for overfi tting. We reran the logistic model on 90% of the sample, sequentially dropping 10% of the population with each run. We contrasted the mean accuracy of these analyses with the overall accuracy of the model developed with the entire cohort. All analyses were performed with SPSS soft ware, version 19.0 (IBM).\n\nNine thousand six hundred twenty-four consecutive patients with a discharge diagnosis of pneumonia having respiratory samples submitted to the microbiology laboratory were included in the study. Th e mean age was 57.8 \u03ee 26.1 years (range, 18-97 years), with 5,648 men (58.7%) and 3,976 women (41.3%) ( Table 1 ) . Four thousand one hundred seventy-two patients (43.3%) had pneumonia present at hospital admission, 4,400 (45.7%) had hospital-acquired pneumonia, and 1,052 (10.9%) had ventilator-associated pneumonia. Among these patients, 4,432 (46.1%) were classifi ed as having culturenegative pneumonia, 1,940 (20.2%) as having pneumonia attributed to antibiotic-susceptible bacteria, 2,991 (31.1%) as having pneumonia attributed to potentially antibioticresistant bacteria, and 261 (2.7%) as having viral pneumonia. Charlson comorbidity scores were statistically greatest for patients who were culture negative and those with viral pneumonia ( Table 1 ). Th ere were 585 patients readmitted to the hospital within 90 days. Th e most common reasons for readmission included nonpneumonia infections (n 5 163, 27.9%), nonpneumonia pulmonary conditions (COPD, asthma, bronchiectasis, cystic fi brosis) (n 5 125, 21.4%), pneumonia (n 5 62, 10.6%), respiratory failure (n 5 45, 7.7%), nonpneumonia organ transplant complications (n 5 43, 7.4%), non-congestive heart failure cardiac events (n 5 26, 4.4%), GI conditions (n 5 24, 4.1%), CNS conditions (n 5 20, 3.4%), and congestive heart failure (n 5 17, 2.9%).\n\nAmong patients with pneumonia attributed to antibiotic-susceptible bacteria, methicillin-susceptible S aureus was most common, followed by H infl uenzae , S pneumonia e, Klebsiella pneumoniae , and Escherichia coli ( Table 2 ) . For pneumonia attributed to potentially antibiotic-resistant bacteria P aeruginosa was most prevalent, followed by methicillin-resistant S aureus , Enterobacter species, Acinetobacter species, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia . Herpes simplex virus was the most common respiratory virus, followed by cytomegalovirus, infl uenza A, parainfl uenza, and rhinovirus.\n\nTh e prevalence of 90-day hospital readmission among hospital survivors (n 5 7,637, 79.4%) was greatest for patients with pneumonia attributed to potentially antibiotic-resistant bacteria (11.4%), followed by a viral cause (8.3%), pneumonia attributed to antibioticsusceptible bacteria (6.6%), and culture-negative pneumonia (5.8%) ( P , .001) ( Fig 1 ) . Similar distributions were identifi ed for 30-day and 180-day readmission rates (30 day: 6.7%, 4.4%, 4.3%, 3.2%; P , .001; and 180 day: 14.6%, 9.4%, 8.6%, 7.6%; P , .001). Patients with a 90-day readmission had a lower BMI, were less likely to receive mechanical ventilation, had greater Charlson comorbidity scores, and were statistically more likely to have congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, COPD, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, leukemia, and cirrhosis compared with patients without a 90-day readmission ( Table 3 ) . Pneumonia on admission and pneumonia attributed to potentially antibiotic-resistant bacteria were significantly more likely, whereas hospital-acquired pneumonia and culturenegative pneumonia were less likely, to be present in patients with a 90-day readmission.\n\nKaplan-Meier analysis censoring for mortality demonstrated that 90-day readmission was statistically most common among patients with pneumonia attributed to potentially antibiotic-resistant bacteria ( Fig 2 ) . Multiple logistic regression analysis identifi ed pneumonia attributed to potentially antibiotic-resistant bacteria to be independently associated with 90-day readmission (OR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.56-1.97; P , .001). Other independent predictors of 90-day readmission were Charlson comorbidity score . 4, cirrhosis, and chronic kidney disease, whereas culture-negative pneumonia was associated with a lower risk of 90-day readmission ( Table 4 ) . Th e adjusted ORs for the variables that were signifi cant predictors in the model in all of the 10 sequential reruns (with 90% of the cohort) did not diff er from the fi ndings in the complete population.\n\nTh e analysis was repeated for the subgroup of patients with pneumonia on admission, encompassing both community-acquired pneumonia and health-careassociated pneumonia. Similar to the entire cohort, the prevalence of 90-day hospital readmission among hospital survivors (n 5 3,495) was greatest for patients with More than one listed pathogen could be present within each category. \n\nWe demonstrated that hospital readmission following hospitalization for pneumonia was associated with pneumonia pathogen characterization, with pneumonia attributed to antibiotic-resistant bacteria having the highest rate of readmission. Moreover, our multivariate analysis demonstrated that pneumonia attributed to potentially antibiotic-resistant bacteria was an independent predictor of 90-day readmission, whereas culture-negative pneumonia was associated with a lower risk of 90-day readmission. Pneumonia attributed to potentially antibioticresistant bacteria was also found to have the longest hospital length of stay and greatest hospital mortality. For the subgroup of patients having pneumonia on admission, encompassing community-acquired pneumonia and health-care-associated pneumonia, the association between 90-day readmission and pneumonia attributed to potentially antibiotic-resistant bacteria was quantitatively greater than for the entire cohort.\n\nPredicting which patients with pneumonia will require readmission is problematic. Dharmarajan et al 15 showed that readmissions following congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, and pneumonia hospitalization were diverse and usually for a diff erent reason than the original hospitalization problem. A Department of Veterans Aff airs study identifi ed predictors of readmission following a pneumonia hospitalization including increasing age, single marital status, increasing number of ED clinic visits in the previous year, hospital admission within the previous 90 days, increasing number of nonpharmacy clinic visits in the prior year, and shorter hospital length of stay. 16 Interestingly, these risk factors were largely unrelated to the underlying pneumonia, supporting the fi ndings of Dharmarajan et al. 15 However, Cabr\u00e9 et al 17 showed that oropharyngeal dysphagia in the elderly was an important risk factor for readmission following hospitalization for pneumonia, presumably by promoting recurrent aspiration.\n\nIt is biologically plausible that pneumonia pathogen characterization could infl uence readmission and other outcomes by impacting the eff ectiveness of antibiotic therapy in some patients, especially because of the presence of antibiotic resistance, as well as by identifying a population with greater disease severity and comorbidi-ties. Previous pneumonia studies have shown that inappropriate initial antibiotic therapy due to infection with antibiotic-resistant bacteria is associated with increased risk of mortality. 18 Micek et al 19 recently demonstrated that inappropriate initial therapy for communityacquired pneumonia in the ED setting was associated with a signifi cantly greater risk of hospital readmission. Multivariate analysis using hospital readmission as the dependent outcome identifi ed antibiotic exposure in the previous 30 days, presence of peripheral vascular disease, and increasing CURB-65 (confusion, blood urea nitrogen . 7 mmol/L, respiratory rate . 30/min, BP , 90 mm Hg, systolic or diastolic BP \u0545 60 mm Hg, \u0546 age 65 years) scores as predictors for readmission. Like the Department of Veterans Aff airs study, 16 pneumoniarelated variables did not predict readmission. However, Micek et al 19 also found that antibiotic exposure in the previous 30 days was independently associated with inappropriate antibiotic therapy, thus providing a link between inappropriate therapy and hospital readmission. However, it is likely that for most patients, infection with antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a marker for greater underlying disease severity and comorbidities, further supporting a plausible link between pathogen type and readmission risk. 13, 20, 21 Understanding the risk factors for hospital readmission in patients with pneumonia could provide insights into whether such readmissions are preventable as well as how to best tailor strategies to prevent readmissions. Moreover, such data could more objectively identify hospitals caring for patients at higher risk for readmission because of case mix, potentially mitigating fi nancial penalties for readmission in those patients. Th e latter is supported by a study by Shorr et al, 22 who found that patients with health-care-associated pneumonia were more than seven times as likely to be readmitted to the hospital compared with patients with communityacquired pneumonia. Th ese investigators showed that admission from long-term care, underlying immunosuppression, prior antibiotic exposure, and prior hospitalization within the preceding 90 days were predictors for readmission. None of these risk factors would be amenable to direct intervention by the treating clinicians to reduce the likelihood of readmission. Th ese investigators were also unable to establish a relationship between appropriateness of antibiotic therapy and being rehospitalized, thus illustrating that care delivery may have only a limited causal role in driving rehospitalization. Th e absence of a nexus between initial antibiotic therapy for the index pneumonia and readmission underscores that nonmodifi able patient or pathogen characteristics are likely key determinants of whether a subject with pneumonia is eventually readmitted. Our data would support this hypothesis by identifying pneumonia pathogen characterization as an important risk factor for readmission.\n\nOur study has several important limitations. First, this was a retrospective analysis. It is possible that we did not identify all patient variables and processes of care that are important determinants of 90-day readmission in this population. Moreover, the retrospective nature of this investigation did not allow an assessment of specifi c treatment considerations such as the response to antibiotic therapy and pneumonia recurrence, and limited our ability to identify readmissions to nonsystem hospitals. Second, we focused on pathogen type as a determinant of readmission and not the appropriateness of antibiotic therapy. Th is was purposefully done, given the established strong association between antibiotic-resistant bacteria and host-specifi c risk factors (eg, prior antibiotics, recent hospitalization), as well as with the administration of inappropriate antimicrobial therapy. [11] [12] [13] 18, 19 Pathogen type seems to be a simple marker encompassing these risks, to include the administration of inappropriate therapy, and is in line with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services goal to discover more easily identifiable objective measures to assess patient risks and quality of care. 23 Third, we simply categorized pathogens into broad categories without determining whether certain pathogens, or pathogen subtypes, were more likely to be associated with 90-day readmission.\n\nAnother limitation of our study is that we did not have access to outpatient visits following the index hospitalization to assess the infl uence of follow-up care on readmission rates. Several studies have identifi ed early posthospital follow-up visits as important means of preventing readmissions. 9,10 Additionally, even though all patients had respiratory cultures obtained, it is possible that some of these cultures may represent inadequate specimens. Moreover, a proportion of the culture-negative samples may have been due to inadequate specimen collection. Th is could have underestimated the number of patients with antibiotic-resistant pathogens in our study, potentially infl uencing our results. Finally, the patient population at Barnes-Jewish Hospital may not be representative of that at other centers. Th is is supported by the high percentage of S aureus infection we observed, likely due to the high prevalence of healthcare-associated risk factors in the population. 21 However, a strength of our study is that we did not limit inclusion to patients with a specifi c type of pneumonia but included all types, except for those due to opportunistic pathogens.\n\nIn conclusion, our data suggest that readmission following hospitalization for pneumonia is relatively common and is related to pneumonia pathogen characterization. Pneumonia attributed to potentially antibioticresistant bacteria is associated with an increased risk for 90-day readmission, whereas culture-negative pneumonia is associated with a lower risk for 90-day readmission.
