{"title": "Approach to a Child with Sore Throat", "body": "Upper Respiratory tract infections are seen with great frequency in both children and adults and have remarkable economic impact, related to the frequent prescription by physicians of antibiotics, even when the causative agents of infection are not bacteria. About one-fourth of children with sore throat have bacterial pharyngitis and about half of the families with index case have a secondary case [1]. Identification and adequate antibiotic treatment of group A streptococcal sore throat is important for primary prevention of acute rheumatic fever, as it carries approximately 3% risk of development of acute rheumatic fever.\n\nSoreness is generally described by the patient as pain in the throat without the effort of swallowing and also a painful swallow [2]. Sore throat is primary symptom of pharyngitis. The terms \u201csore throat\u201d and \u201cpharyngitis or pharyngotonsillitis\u201d are often used interchangeably. Pharyngitis refers to objective evidence of inflammation of the pharynx, such as exudates, ulceration, or definite erythema. Redness of the throat may occur as part of the general redness of all mucous membranes in a patient with fever. A diagnosis of pharyngitis is justified only when the pharynx is redder than the rest of the oral mucosa.\n\n\nCorona virus, rhinovirus, adeno virus, influenza and parainfluenza are the commonest etiological agents and usually presents as common cold.Other viral infections that can present with sore throat are Ebstein Barr (EB) virus and HIV which can present as a sore throat in initial course of illness.Recurrent sore throat can occur due to cytomegalovirus or fungal infections in immunosuppresed patients.\n\n\n\nGroup A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) is the most common cause of bacterial sore throat. It accounts for 15\u201336% of cases of acute pharyngitis in children in west [1], and 13.4% of cases in India, according to one study done at PGIMER [3].Streptococcus type C and GDiphtheria\u2014is an important cause in India and many developing countries.H influenza, Staphylococcus aureus, Mycoplasma, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Yersinia are some uncommon bacterial causes.Fusobacterium necrophorum infection. This uncommon infection which starts as fever and sore throat, can complicate into Lemierre\u2019s syndrome. (Positive blood culture, clinical or radiographic evidence of internal jugular vein thrombosis, and at least one metastatic focus.)\n\n\n\nPeritonsillar, Retropharyngeal and Lateral Pharyngeal abscesses\u2014usually due to spread of infection from local site like bacterial tonsillitis. Along with fever and sore throat, other features like painful swallowing, drooling, trismus, visible swelling below mandible and deviation of uvula to opposite side may be present.Allergies\u2014especially when complicated by postnasal drip.Irritants\u2014Dust, tobacco smoke (in teenagers) or chemicals (occupational hazard for children/adolescents working in factories). Sore throat in such patients is usually chronic.Muscle strain\u2014talking in loud noise without rest for long period.\nGastroEsophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)\n\nPsychogenic\n\n\n\nMajority of the times, history and clinical examination gives clue to etiology (Table 1). The major challenge is to diagnose GABHS infection, because the signs and symptoms of GABHS pharyngitis overlap with other infections and untreated GABHS can cause serious complications. No single element of the history or physical examination reliably confirms or excludes GABHS pharyngitis.\n\n\n\nSeveral scoring systems have been developed to predict which patients will have GABHS. Use of these does improve quality of care but none of these systems, however, is totally reliable in identifying children who need treatment [4]. A clinical scoring system has been designed in India but it has to be validated for local use. This scoring system uses variables such as age, season, fever, erythema of pharynx, size of tonsil, pharyngeal exudates; lymphadenopathy and pain in throat, and scores are assigned according to throat culture positivity in association with the same. Cut off value of 15 predicts GAS infection with 91% sensitivity and 98% specificity [3].\n\nThe evaluation of patient should include the following:\n\nHistory\nOnset and durationFever\u2014degree (doesn\u2019t help much to differentiate)Associated cough, coryza, conjunctivitis (more with viral); headache, myalgia (more with GABHS)Any breathing difficulty especially new onset snoring at night or stridor (a likely sign of developing abscess)History of rash, diarrhea, allergyHistory of regurgitation, epigastric or retrosternal pain usually indicates GERDHistory of sore throat in family in past 2 wks.Similar complaints in past, with vaccination history\n\n\nExamination\n\nLook oral cavity with a good light for-\nExudates: White/gray scum on the surface of the tonsils or pharynx, readily wiped off without producing bleeding is more likely with bacterial pharyngitis.\nUlcer\nMembrane: Exudates of bacterial pharyngitis may organize as gray-white layer of materials that can be peeled from the pharynx.\n\u25cb A membrane is seen with infectious mononucleosis, diphtheria and sometimes streptococcal infection. Arcanobacterium hemolyticum and tularemia are rare causes of membranous pharyngitis.\u25cb Gray to black adherent membrane, with extension beyond the faucial area (esp. soft palate and uvula), dysphagia, and relative lack of fever suggest a diagnosis of diphtheria.\u25cb Oral thrush seen in neonates and infants which can have pseudomembrane (curd like plaques), removal of which may cause mild punctuate bleeding.Bulging of oropharynx or uvula displacement are suggestive of parapharyngeal or peritonsillar abscess.Painful vesicular lesions on pharynx and tonsils are characteristic of herpangina. Herpes simplex produces painful vesicles confined to anterior mouth which may sometimes extend to anterior tonsillar pillars.Lymphadenopathy: Look for anterior (tonsillar) and posterior cervical lymph nodes. Tender anterior lymphadenopathy favors bacterial sore throat. Tender posterior cervical and/or generalized lymphadenopathy favours Ebstein Barr (EB) virus infection.Examine for neck swelling, conjunctivitis, auscultatory abnormalities and hepatosplenomegaly.Vital signs, including blood pressure, should be recorded. Poor quality of the heart sounds raises the possibility of diphtheritic myocarditis. Absence of a heart murmur or dependent edema should be noted for their relevance to rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis.Common signs and symptoms of streptococcal pharyngitis include sore throat, temperature \u226538.3\u00b0C, tonsillar or pharyngeal exudates and cervical lymphadenopathy. Cough, coryza and diarrhea are more common with viral pharyngitis. Differentiating features between streptococcal pharyngitis and viral pharyngitis are given in Table 2.\n\n\n\nSamples should be obtained by vigorous swabbing of both tonsillar surfaces or fossae and the posterior pharynx [6, 7]. Correctly sampled and plated, throat swab culture has 90\u201395% sensitivity. Swabbing the soft palate and uvula should be avoided, because it dilutes the inoculums.\n\nBased on cost, narrow spectrum of activity, safety, and effectiveness, penicillin is the drug of choice [10, 11]. Shorter duration of treatment increases risk of bacteriological recurrence [12] Inappropriate use of macrolides for treatment of GABHS pharyngitis has been the main cause of resistant strains in western countries [13]. The various alternatives to penicillin and the dosage of antibiotics are given in Table 3.\n\n\n\n\nStabilize child (ABC\u2026) (For details refer to section on upper airway obstruction).Diphtheria antitoxin: 50,000\u2013120,000 U IV depending on extent of involvement.Antibiotics: Aqueous crystalline penicillin G 40,000 U/kg/dose 6 hourly IV or erythromycin 15 mg/kg 8 hourly (not to exceed 2 g/day) oral/IV for 14 days.\n\n\nFor prophylaxis to contacts same dose of erythromycin for 7 days or a single injection of benzathine penicillin G (600,000 U IM for <30 kg, 1,200,000 U IM for \u226530 kg.) is recommended.\n\n\nToxic looking childNot accepting orally wellSuspected to having associated complications or diphtheria.\n"}
