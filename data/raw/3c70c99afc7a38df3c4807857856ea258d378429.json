{"title": "The molecular basis for Pompe disease 3 revealed by the structure of human acid \u03b1-glucosidase 4 5", "body": "Introduction encompasses residues 347-726 and has the characteristic (\u03b2/\u03b1) 8 topology found in the catalytic 109 domain of family 31 glycoside hydrolases. C-terminal to the catalytic (\u03b2/\u03b1) 8 domain, the GAA 110 structure contains two additional \u03b2-sandwich domains. Domain C1 spans residues 727-820 and 111 is composed of seven antiparallel \u03b2-strands in 5-and 2-stranded \u03b2-sheets. The C2 domain has 112 a \u03b2-sandwich topology and is composed of 10 \u03b2-strands in two 5-stranded \u03b2-sheets, with two 113 small \u03b1-helices inserted ( Fig. 1 and Fig. 1 supplement B) . and the surface-exposed C938 and C952 in the C2 domain (Fig. 1) .\n\nProteolytic treatment prior to crystallization mimics proteolytic maturation in the late endosome 124 and lysosome. Electron density is missing for loops 116-122, 199-205, and 782-792. 125 Presumably, the flexible loops in the intact protein limited the resolution of the intact GAA 126 crystals. After cleavage of the three loops, the remaining fragments remain associated by non- Active site and ligand binding 136 The active site of GAA is an acidic pocket at the base of a conical funnel lined by hydrophobic 137 residues in the (\u03b2/\u03b1) 8 barrel catalytic domain (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, and Fig. 2 supplement A) . The To better understand substrate recognition in GAA, we determined complexes of the enzyme 155 with isomaltose and maltotriose (di-and tri-saccharide fragments of glycogen) at 2.0 and 1.9\u00c5 156 resolution, respectively. The structures show glucose present in the active site with no clear proximity of active site residues D282, M519, and R600, \u03b2-linked substituents beyond a 161 hydroxyl are sterically blocked, and thus we conclude that the \u03b2-glucose appears in the active 162 site after cleavage of \u03b1-linked substrate and subsequent ring opening of the \u03b1-glucose product. 163 Residues D404, D616, and H674 confer glucose substrate specificity by hydrogen bonding to 164 hydroxyls on the ligand (Fig. 2) . Hydrophobic residues W376, L405, I441, W481, W516, M519, 165 W613 and F649 contribute to active site architecture and substrate binding. We also determined the complex of GAA bound to 1-deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) (Fig. 2) shallow cleft in the N1 domain 34\u00c5 away from the active site ( Fig. 3 and Fig. 3 supplement A) . 176 In the second site, the non-reducing ends of isomaltose and maltotriose bind identically, with 177 hydrogen bonds between the glucose hydroxyls and the side chain of D91 and the main chain per side chain atom possessing less than 2 \u00c5 2 , between 2-9 \u00c5 2 , and above 9 were considered 249 buried, partially buried or exposed respectively.
