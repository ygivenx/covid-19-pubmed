{"title": "Characterization of patients transported with extracorporeal\nrespiratory and/or cardiovascular support in the State of S\u00e3o Paulo,\nBrazil", "body": "The use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support has increased in recent\nyears,(1) especially\nfollowing the pandemic of influenza A (H1N1) virus pneumonitis.(2-4) Although the results of previous randomized trials in which\nECMO was used for respiratory support are inconclusive,(5,6) new\ntechnologies(7) associated\nwith the application of ultraprotective mechanical ventilation(8) have improved survival and the\nquality of life when ECMO is used for patients with severe respiratory\nfailure.(9,10)\n\nThe high cost of the training and support required for ECMO use may have a negative\neconomic impact, especially in developing countries.(11) However, the high cost of the initial\ninstallation of the system is compensated for by its low cost of maintenance and the\ngood outcomes obtained when ECMO support is used with adequate staff training,\nmaking this therapy cost-effective in developed countries(9,12) and\npotentially cost-effective in developing countries.(13)\n\nConsidering that ensuring the availability of appropriate staff in health centers\nwith a relatively small occupancy rate may increase the cost of extracorporeal\nsupport, ECMO-equipped transport to specialized centers has been made available at\nan acceptable cost, with high survival rates and improvement in the quality of\nlife.(4,9)\n\nConsidering the importance of transport with ECMO, the objective of this study was to\ncharacterize the transport performed by our team in the State of S\u00e3o Paulo\nsince 2011.\n\nThe data were considered nonparametric because of the small sample size and are\nreported as the median [25th - 75th\npercentile] if quantitative and as the number of occurrences and\npercentages if qualitative. The comparisons between the groups presented in the\ntables were performed using the Mann-Whitney test for quantitative data and\nFisher's exact test for qualitative data. The confidence interval of the\nsurvivor ratio was calculated according to the method described by the\nAssociation of Public Health Observatories(21) using R software for calculations and graph\ncreation.(22)\n\nThe ECMO program was initiated in 2011, and the transport of ECMO patients began in\nthe same year.(14) A flowchart of\nthe 28 requests for extracorporeal support outside the referral hospitals is shown\nin figure\n1S. The first seven patients in this series were\ndescribed in another publication.(15) During the six years of the program, 18 patients in the state\nof S\u00e3o Paulo were rescued and transported with ECMO support by our team.\nSeventeen patients received exclusive respiratory support (veno-venous - VV\nconfiguration), and one patient received respiratory and cardiovascular support\n(veno-arterial - VA configuration). A profile of the patients is shown in table 1. The characteristics of the patients\nshortly before initiation of the support are shown in table 2. The Respiratory ECMO Survival Prediction Score (RESP\nscore) and the tidal volume in pre-ECMO mechanical ventilation differed\nsignificantly in survivors and nonsurvivors. The data on the rescue missions and\ncomplications during transport are shown in table\n3. The referral hospitals were Hospital S\u00edrio\nLiban\u00eas (two patients), Hospital TotalCor (two\npatients), and the Hospital das Cl\u00ednicas of S\u00e3o Paulo\n(14 patients).\n\nThe data on the extracorporeal support are shown in table 4. Respiratory support was provided using the femoral-jugular\nconfiguration, and veno-arterial support (one case) was provided using the\nfemoral-femoral configuration. The venous cannulae were 21 - 22 Fr, and the arterial\ncannulae were 16 - 19 Fr. Apart from veno-arterial cannulation, anticoagulation was\nstarted upon patient arrival at the referral hospital. Five patients did not use\nanticoagulation at any time because of pulmonary hemorrhage (four cases) or the\npresence of cerebral vasculitis with hemorrhagic areas (one case). None of the\nevaluated patients had a change of itinerary or a change in the support\nconfiguration related to initial cannulation. The final results are shown in table 5. The minimum and maximum duration of\nsupport was 3 and 60 days, respectively. Of the 18 patients, 13 (72%, 95%CI 49 - 88)\nsurvived to hospital admission (Figure 2S). Of the survivors,\nonly one patient needed dialysis after hospital admission, and none required home\noxygen therapy. The individual patient data are presented in\ntable\n1S.\n\nIn this case series of 18 severe patients transported to specialized centers with\nECMO support in S\u00e3o Paulo, the rate of complications was low, and hospital\nsurvival was 72%. Of the patients who were discharged from the hospital, only one\nneeded renal replacement therapy, and none required home oxygen therapy.\n\nFewer than 2% of the patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) suffered from\nsevere respiratory failure. Of these, fewer than 0.5% were refractory to protective\nmechanical ventilation and salvage therapy for hypoxemia and severe\nhypercapnia(23) and\nsometimes required ECMO support. The low rate of very severe patients limits the\nability to maintain a team to perform ECMO support in all ICUs. Therefore, in\ndeveloped countries, transport with installed ECMO support was used to reduce the\nrisk of transportation to specialized centers, and the patient survival rate was 62%\n(95%CI 57 - 68%).(4,15) In our series, hospital survival was 72% (95%CI\n49 - 88%), in agreement with the data reported in the literature.(15)\n\nThese results are attributed to two main causes. The first is the use of more\nrigorous inclusion and exclusion criteria, which resulted in restricting the use of\nECMO to highly selected patients because ECMO support seems to have a survival\nbenefit with improved quality of life for patients with few comorbidities and few\nacute dysfunctions.(9,24) In addition, the application of\nrescue therapy, such as the use of the prone position before ECMO, is essential\nwhenever possible because this therapy is inexpensive and there is strong evidence\nthat its use improves patient survival.(25) Second, the use of ECMO support can be optimized by\nproviding adequate training and experience to the multidisciplinary team(18) and by the involvement of\nprofessionals who possess comprehensive knowledge of emergency care and possible\ncomplications during ECMO support.(26-28)\n\nIn our study, the comparison of survivors and nonsurvivors should be considered\npreliminary because of the small sample size. However, certain factors should be\nconsidered. The initial tidal volume of the patients who died was lower than that of\nthose who survived, suggesting greater severity of lung injuries and poorer lung\ncompliance in the former. The Simplified Acute Physiology Score 3 (SAPS 3) did not\ndiffer in the two groups, and the RESP score,(29) which was used in decision-making, was higher in\nsurvivors. Although the RESP score was developed as a means of predicting patient\nsurvival under ECMO support, other scores that were developed to predict patient\nsurvival better address other organic functions and may therefore be more\naccurate.(30) The Survival\nAfter Veno-Arterial ECMO Score (SAVE score) was described, but the effects of using\nthis score were not analyzed because it was used in only one case.\n\nAnother relevant factor in our sample of nonsurvivors was that the partial pressure\ndecrease in carbon dioxide (PaCO2) from pre- to post-ECMO was critical.\nThis characteristic is known to be related to higher patient mortality in\nECMO.(31) This factor may\nhave contributed to the deaths of two patients who progressed to brain death while\nin the ICU. This outcome alerted us to the importance of the careful initiation of\nextracorporeal ventilation, especially in hypercapnic patients with gas/blood flow\n< 1, to ensure a smaller initial decrease in PaCO2.\n\nThe most serious problems that arose during transport were addressed as follows. (1)\nEnergy failure was avoided by using a hand pump for one patient and by turning off\nthe warning lights for another patient, and the ambulance power inverter was\ndedicated to the operation of the pump. (2) Only decreases in oxygen saturation <\n85% and > 70% were observed. These dessaturations occurred because of the\nseverity of lung injury, associated with a cardiac output. Severe hypoxemia may\noccur during the acute phase of respiratory support and sometimes needs to be\ntolerated by the team;(32)\nalthough this complication may not directly affect survival or cognitive outcome, it\nindicates the severity of the patient's condition.(33)\n\nAlthough the sample described in this study does not provide new data, it represents\nthe first case series of patients transported in ECMO in Brazil. However, the\nresults of this study should be viewed with caution for several reasons. First,\nbecause the sample size was small, it was not possible to perform a multivariate\nanalysis. Second, the results of the analyses are preliminary and should not be used\nto change procedures at the bedside. Third, generalization of the results reported\nhere to other centers should be made with caution because the number of ECMO support\ncases per year was low (5 - 10). Fourth, the indications were restricted to a small\nsubset of patients.\n\nUnder certain conditions, ECMO can be an effective and cost-effective therapy. The\nresults of this case series demonstrate that this approach can be effective when\nrestrictive indications are followed, adequate intensive care is provided to avoid\ncomplications during hospitalization, and the staff involved in patient care are\ncontinuously trained to enable them to treat life-threatening complications that may\noccur during ECMO support. In our opinion, this can only be achieved in a few\ncenters while maintaining the cost-effectiveness of therapy.\n\nTransport of severely ill patients with extracorporeal respiratory support in a\nBrazilian state was feasible and did not result in severe complications. Despite the\nsmall sample size, patient survival to hospital admission was similar to that\nreported in the literature."}
