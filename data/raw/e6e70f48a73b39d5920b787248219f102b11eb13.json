{"title": "", "body": "Antimicrobial resistance has increased rapidly during the last 15 years and has become a global health issue [1] [2] [3] [4] . A relationship between the consumption of antibiotics and antimicrobial resistance has been widely documented and has been used to sup-port the implementation of antimicrobial control policies [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . In Taiwan, healthcare-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (HA-MRSA), which can cause life-threatening infections, has become endemic in hospitals [4] . A government policy restricting the use of antibiotics was established by the Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI) and was implemented in 2001 in Taiwan [4] . A few studies have evaluated the short-term relationship between consumption of antibiotics and antimicrobial resistance in Taiwan hospitals [9, 13, 14] before and after implementation of this policy.\n\nIn this report, we describe a long-term study on the impact of the policy on the rates of consumption of various parenteral antibiotics and the incidence of HA-MRSA infection and the prevalence of MRSA during a 9-year period at a medical centre in central Taiwan. \n\nChung Shan Medical University (CSMU) Hospital is a 1162-bed tertiary care university hospital in Taichung, central Taiwan. The infection control practices at CSMU during the study period of [2001] [2002] [2003] [2004] [2005] [2006] [2007] [2008] [2009] have been standardised according to the guidelines of the Nosocomial Infection Control Society of Taiwan (NICST) and the Taiwan Center for Disease Control (CDC). The guidelines (http://www.cdc.gov.tw/np.asp?ctNode=1693&mp=1) can be accessed by any hospital in Taiwan. Briefly, the hospital distributed and implemented an infection control manual with specific protocols for prevention of infection by various routes (e.g. airborne and droplets); analysed incidences of infection with MRSA and other multidrug-resistant infections; performed active surveillance, reporting of notifiable infectious diseases and isolation of patients; performed surveillance and screening of healthcare workers (HCWs); trained HCWs in the appropriate use of personal protective equipment; provided continuing education programmes for HCWs; promoted hand hygiene; analysed the use of antibiotics and presented workshops on appropriate use of antibiotics; and adopted the measures for control, monitoring and review of antibiotic use described below.\n\nFollowing the 2003 epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Taiwan CDC was aware of the importance of nosocomial infection control and implemented the Nosocomial Infection Control Regional Assistance Plan and Medical Service Quality Improvement Plan, which commissioned the NICST and the Taiwan Joint Commission on Hospital Accreditation (TJCHA). CSMU was audited for compliance with the infection control measures from 2007-2009 by the Taiwan CDC and TJCHA. The hospital secured accreditation at the level of medical centre.\n\nBefore 2000 there was no well-established antibiotic control policy at CSMU. Although prescriptions for some restricted antibiotics required prior authorisation by infectious disease specialists (IDSs), most antibiotics were freely prescribed without documentation of indications or limitations on the duration of use. In 2000, the CSMU Infection Control Committee and Department of Pharmacy established a new antibiotic use policy with the following provisions. Restricted and unrestricted antimicrobials were clearly classified. The restricted antimicrobials included \u2424-lactamase inhibitors and penicillin plus \u2424-lactamase inhibitor combination (sulbactam sodium, ampicillin/sulbactam injection, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid injection and piperacillin/tazobactam), second-generation cephalosporins (cefuroxime and cefmetazole), third-generation cephalosporins (cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefoperazone and flomoxef), fourth-generation cephalosporins (cefepime and cefpirome), carbapenems (ertapenem, meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin), aminoglycosides (amikacin and isepamicin), fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin), glycopeptides (vancomycin and teicoplanin), linezolid, tigecycline and daptomycin. Furthermore, the indications for use of restricted antimicrobials became regulated by the BNHI in Taiwan and three important new regulations restricting antimicrobial use were implemented. Inappropriate prophylactic use of antibiotics for surgery was discouraged, for example by limiting the duration of antibiotic therapy to 3 days in some clean surgeries, e.g. total hip replacement, total knee replacement and coronary artery bypass graft. Antimicrobial agents used in the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections were restricted. The 10 guidelines for the use of antimicrobial agents in Taiwan can be freely downloaded from http://www.ejmii.com/guidelines.php to use as a reference.\n\nAt CSMU, the role of IDSs in making bedside consultations and providing authorisation was established. Furthermore, prescriptions for restricted antibiotics required authorisation from an IDS. Criteria that defined the need for consultation and authorisation by an IDS include use of restricted antibiotics, use of more than two different classes of antibiotics or use of antibiotics for longer than 7 days as well as the requested assessment of appropriate antibiotic use. The role of the IDSs in the antibiotic use programme is crucial. IDSs assess the appropriate use of antimicrobials and provide recommendations according to patient's clinical symptoms and signs, diagnosis, liver and renal function, co-morbidities, culture susceptibility tests and adherence to guidelines for the use of antimicrobial agents in Taiwan. Inappropriate use of antimicrobials is discontinued. IDSs permit appropriate antibiotic agents for 7 days after assessment and consent.\n\nData on the annual consumption of oral and intravenous antibiotics in CSMU from 2001-2009 were collected from the computer database of the Pharmacy Department. Antibiotic consumption was standardised by using the defined daily dose (DDD) as established by the World Health Organization's ATC/DDD index [15, 16] \n\nThe prevalence of MRSA was obtained from the Clinical Microbiology Laboratory of CSMU. Healthcare-associated isolates (HAIs) were defined according to criteria established by the CDC [18, 19] and the data relevant to HAIs in CSMU were obtained from the hospital's Infection Control Committee. All MRSA isolates were non-duplicate samples; a duplicate isolate was defined as an isolate of the same species of bacteria with the same antimicrobial susceptibility pattern isolated from the same patient and site within 1 month. Susceptibility testing was performed by the disk diffusion method and was interpreted according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines [20,21].\n\nConsumption of restricted and unrestricted antibiotics was summarised as the DDD/1000 patient-days (PD). The Spearman correlation coefficient ( ) was determined for the correlation between MRSA prevalence and incidence of HA-MRSA infections versus antibiotic consumption. Statistical hypothesis tests were set with a significance level of 0.05. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS v.15.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).\n\nThe total DDD of antibiotics consumed per 1000 PD decreased during the first 2 years following implementation of the new poli- (Table 1 ). The trend for consumption of unrestricted antibiotics was similar to that for overall consumption ( Fig. 1 ; Table 2 ). Consumption of restricted antibiotics was stable during 2001-2002 but also increased in Table 1 Correlation between antibiotic consumption and the incidence of healthcare-associated methicillin- 2003 ( Fig. 1 ; Table 3 ). The use of restricted antibiotics then decreased continuously until 2007, but began to increase slightly thereafter.\n\nThe trend in the prevalence of MRSA (defined as the number of isolates/1000 PD) was similar to the trend in overall consumption of antibiotics ( Fig. 1A ; Table 4 \n\nAlthough there was no significant correlation between total consumption of antibiotics (category J01-Antibacterials for systemic use) and the incidence of HA-MRSA (Table 1) Consumption of all unrestricted antibiotics was significantly positively correlated with the incidence of HA-MRSA infection ( = 0.767, P = 0.016) ( Table 2 ). In addition, significant positive correlations were found between the incidence of HA-MRSA infection and consumption of following individual unre- ATC, Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical; DDD, defined daily doses; PD, patient-days. a Flomoxef is a third-generation cephalosporin; there is no ATC code or World Health Organization definition or DDD at present.

In addition, there were significant positive correlations between MRSA prevalence and consumption of the following individual classes of antibiotics: penicillins with extended spectrum ( = 0.800, P = 0.010); \u2424-lactamase-resistant penicillins ( = 0.717, P = 0.030); first-generation cephalosporins ( = 0.667, P = 0.050); macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramins ( = 0.800, P = 0.010); macrolides ( = 0.783, P = 0.013); aminoglycosides ( = 0.700, P = 0.036); and glycopeptides ( = 0.717, P = 0.030).\n\nConsumption of the following restricted antibiotics was significantly positively correlated with MRSA prevalence: ceftazidime ( = 0.783, P = 0.013); ceftriaxone ( = 0.700, P = 0.036); cefepime ( = 0.833, P = 0.005); meropenem ( = 0.833, P = 0.005); and amikacin ( = 0.750, P = 0.020) ( Table 3 ). In contrast, consumption of daptomycin had a significant negative correlation with HA-MRSA prevalence ( = \u22120.683, P = 0.042).\n\nConsumption of all unrestricted antibiotics displayed a significantly positive correlation with MRSA prevalence ( = 0.733, P = 0.025) ( Table 2) , as did consumption of the following individual unrestricted antibiotics: amoxicillin ( = 0.767, P = 0.016); cefalexin monohydrate ( = 0.683, P = 0.042); cefazolin ( = 0.783, P = 0.013); erythromycin ( = 0.667, P = 0.050); and gentamicin sulphate ( = 0.700, P = 0.036).\n\nThe restrictive policies for antibiotic use adopted by CSMU in 2001 had several ongoing effects on antibiotic consumption. Consumption of all antibacterials for systemic use decreased by 33% between 2001 and 2009. This was driven primarily by the 44% decrease in consumption of unrestricted antibacterials, which was offset by a 42% increase in the consumption of restricted agents. The patterns of antibacterial use also changed. In 2001 the most frequently used classes of antibacterials were other \u2424-lactam antibacterials (predominantly cephalosporins), tetracyclines and \u2424-lactam antibiotics (penicillins). By 2009, the other \u2424-lactam antibacterials were still used most often, but use of penicillins had greatly outpaced that of the tetracyclines owing to a large decrease in consumption of the tetracyclines and an increase in the use of combinations of penicillins. Other classes with relatively large changes in use included the lincosamides (5.1fold decrease), macrolides (2.5-fold decrease), aminoglycosides (3.6-fold decrease) and sulfonamides and trimethoprim (3.3-fold decrease). Simultaneous changes were observed in the incidence of HA-MRSA and the prevalence of MRSA. The proportion of patients infected with S. aureus in whom the strains were methicillin resistant (HA-MRSA incidence), the proportion of isolates that were resistant (MRSA prevalence) and the number of patients infected with HA-MRSA per total number of PD (infection density) all declined between 2001 and 2009. The prevalence of MRSA was significantly positively correlated with the decrease in total antibiotic use. These results are in general agreement with those from numerous other investigations that have shown a correlation between the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and antibiotic use [7] .\n\nMacKenzie et al. [22] observed a strong statistical relationship between macrolide use and MRSA prevalence as well as a significant association with the use of cephalosporins and all antimicrobial agents except glycopeptides in a study of over 100 European hospitals. In Taiwan, one university hospital reported a significant correlation between the prevalence of MRSA and vancomycin-resistant enterococci with increased consumption of glycopeptides, \u2424-lactam-\u2424-lactamase inhibitor combinations, extended-spectrum cephalosporins, carbapenems and fluoroquinolones [13] . We found that the specific antibiotics for which consumption was positively correlated with MRSA prevalence included penicillins with extended spectrum, \u2424-lactamase-resistant penicillins, first-generation cephalosporins, macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramins, aminoglycosides and glycopeptides. In a recent investigation of the association between the use of antibiotics and the incidence of MRSA in a German hospital, Kaier et al. [23] found a significant correlation with the use of second-and third-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones and lincosamides.\n\nIn general, the trends in incidence of HA-MRSA were similar to those observed in the prevalence of MRSA, although the observed trend towards a decrease in the incidence of HA-MRSA infection that corresponded to the decrease in total antibacterial use did not reach statistical significance. However, some specific differences were apparent. The incidence of HA-MRSA infection (but not the prevalence) was positively correlated with the use of tetracyclines and ampicillin, for example. The correlation between incidence of HA-MRSA infection and the use of all first-generation cephalosporins did not reach significance, although the correlation with prevalence was significant.\n\nPolicies restricting the use of antibiotics in hospitals have been widely adopted over the past decade. Although the extent of reduction varies and the specific provisions differ, these policies have been reported to be generally successful in reducing the consumption of antibiotics. A hospital in Italy reported an overall decrease of 8.5% in antibiotic use in the first year following adoption of an antibiotic control programme [24] . A hospital in Taiwan that adopted a policy similar to ours reported a decline of 13.2% in DDD/100 PD for parenteral antimicrobials immediately before and after implementation [25] . A novel feature of our study is that it spans a 9-year period following the implementation of an antimicrobial control policy, allowing an evaluation of the extent to which the provisions have been followed over time. This is particularly important in light of the findings of a study investigating the relationship between antimicrobial control policies and antimicrobial resistance rates in 33 hospitals in the USA in 2007 [26] . The authors of this report found that only 10 of the hospitals had an antibiotic use policy and that there was no correlation between the existence of an antibiotic use policy and resistance rates. Because they had no evidence that the policies were actually practiced in the hospitals that had adopted them, it was impossible to conclude whether the policies were effective.\n\nIn this study, data for antibiotic consumption and MRSA prevalence and incidence of HA-MRSA infection during 2003 stand out as obvious anomalies. A key event occurred during that year, which may explain these anomalous data. An epidemic of SARS began in mid March 2003 in Taiwan and lasted for almost 4 months. During that time, significant reductions (35.2%) in the utilisation of inpatient care were observed [27] , probably because individuals were fearful of becoming exposed to the virus in hospitals and clinics. We speculate that this fear may have led to a bias towards more seriously ill individuals seeking health care during this period, which may have distorted the baseline characteristics of the inpatient population in CSMU. This cohort of more seriously ill patients might have driven up the consumption of antibiotics. It is noteworthy that the incidence HA-MRSA infection and the prevalence of MRSA continued to mirror the use of antibiotics during this time.\n\nThis retrospective study had three noteworthy limitations. First, this study was conducted in only a single centre and, as such, its findings might not reflect the overall situation in Taiwan. Second, reduction in HA-MRSA infection rates in CSMU might be due to other factors rather than the policy of antibiotic restriction alone. Studies on the molecular epidemiology of MRSA isolates obtained from the study period are required to delineate the possibility of decreased clonal spread of isolates caused by improved infection control measures. Finally, we did not evaluate antibiotic usage as a time series and therefore cannot comment on the lag period and the significance of the immediate and sustained effects of the interventions.\n\nIn conclusion, we have provided data documenting the ongoing successful reduction in total antibiotic consumption over a 9-year period in a hospital in Taiwan. The overall reduction was correlated with the prevalence of MRSA, and reductions in individual antibacterials were significantly positively correlated with decreases in the incidence of HA-MRSA infections.\n\nFunding: This study was supported by Chung Shan Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan (grant no.
