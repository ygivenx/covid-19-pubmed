{"title": "Symptomatology during seasonal coronavirus infections in children is associated with viral and bacterial co-detection", "body": "In the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (COVID-19), children seem to be less severely affected 2 than adults. Case series of Chinese children with COVID-19 report mostly mild symptoms of a 3 respiratory tract infection (RTI) [1, 2] , though severe cases were also reported [3] . Children 4 may however shed large quantities of viral particles in respiratory secretions and faeces, even 5 when they are without symptoms of infection, and may thus contribute substantially to human-6\n\nto-human transmission [4] [5] [6] . Coronavirus (HCoV) detection in asymptomatic children is quite 7 common for other serotypes (OC43, NL63, 229E and HKU1) [7] . In case of severe HCoV-8 associated disease, younger age and chronic illness are identified risk factors [7, 8] . 9\n\nFurthermore, in HCoV-infected children, other respiratory viruses are often co-detected, and 10 these other viruses may contribute to symptomatic illness [7] . Until now, bacterial co-infections 11\n\nhave not been investigated. Improved understanding of determinants of symptomatic HCoV-12 associated illness may also increase our understanding of symptomatology and the potential 13 role of transmission of COVID-19 by the paediatric population in the current pandemic. Between 2013 and 2015, we enrolled 154 children admitted with LTRI and aged between 4 20 weeks and 5 years, and 307 age-, gender-and season-matched healthy controls. Methods 21 were previously published in detail [9] . The study protocol (www.trialregister.nl, NTR5132) was 22 approved by the Dutch National Ethics Committee. Written informed parental consent was 23 obtained from all participants. In the present work, we investigated whether symptomatology 24 of HCoV infection is associated with viral and/or bacterial co-infections. 25\n\nIn short, nasopharyngeal swabs from cases at hospital admission and from healthy 26\n\ncommunity-dwelling controls were tested for respiratory viruses using qualitative multiplex Real 27\n\nTime-PCR (RespiFinder\u00ae SMARTfast 22; Pathofinder, Maastricht, Netherlands) [10] . In 28 addition, bacterial DNA was isolated and sequenced using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. 29\n\nSequencing data is publicly available from the Sequence Read Archive database (BioProject 30 ID PRJNA428382). Statistical analysis was performed in R (version 3.6.1). A p-value <0.05 or 31 a Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-value <0.10 was considered statistically significant. Cases 32 and controls were stratified according to HCoV detection (OC43, HKU1, NL63 or 229E). 33\n\nDifferences in age were assessed with t-tests and differences in gender with chi-square tests. 34\n\nTo test differences in viral (co-)detection and total number of viruses between groups, logistic 35 and linear regression were used, respectively, adjusting for age.

HCoV was detected at a similar rate 40 in 24 (16.0%) cases and in 58 (19.1%) controls (p=0.49). In all HCoV-positive children, both 41 cases and controls, HCoV-OC43 was most commonly detected (62.5% cases, 51.7% controls; 42 p=0.52), followed by HCoV-NL63 (16.7% cases, 27.6% controls; p=0.44), HCoV-229E (16.7% 43 cases, 10.3% controls; p=0.67) and HCoV-HKU1 (12.5% cases, 12.1% controls; p=1.00). 44\n\nThere was one case with co-detection of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E,another case with both 45\n\nHCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1, and one control with co-detection of HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-46 Co-detection of other respiratory viruses with HCoV was more frequent in cases (96%) than in 54 controls (69.0%; p=0.019) ( Figure 1A ). The total number of viruses detected in HCoV-positive 55 cases amounted to maximum four (mean 2.5 (SD 0.9)), and was significantly higher than in 56\n\nHCoV-negative cases (mean 1.4 (SD 0.7); p<0.001) as well as in HCoV-positive controls 57 (mean 2.1 (SD 0.9); p=0.043). Co-infection mostly concerned respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), 58 which was even significantly more often detected in HCoV-positive cases (70.8%), than in 59\n\nHCoV-negative cases (43.9%; p=0.014; Figure 1A Figure 1A-B) . 64\n\nAt the level of individual bacteria, we observed significantly increased abundances of 65\n\nFusobacterium species in HCoV-positive cases compared to HCoV-positive controls. HCoV-67 positive cases also had amongst others significantly decreased abundances of Moraxella 68 species, Helcococcus and Corynebacterium propinquum/pseudodiphtheriticum ( Figure 1C) . 69\n\nWhen comparing HCoV-negative cases to HCoV-negative controls, the differences in 70 Fusobacterium, C. macginleyi/accolens, and C. propinquum/pseudodiphtheriticum abundance 71 .

H. influenzae/haemolyticus was also significantly differentially 72 abundant between HCoV-negative cases and HCoV-negative controls, though the effect size 73 was smaller than between HCoV-positive cases and HCoV-positive controls. Importantly, we 74 community-dwelling children, which is in line with previous reports [7, 8] . HCoV carriage and 79 disease seems, as most viral infections, highly seasonal in children. As aforementioned, mild 80 and asymptomatic paediatric cases with high viral loads are also observed in the current 81 COVID-19 pandemic [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . The contribution to the spread of the disease by these children 82 currently remains unknown, but is potentially substantial given significant viral shedding also 83 occurs in asymptomatic children [6] , and because they keep mixing with family members and 84 other individuals in the community [12] . is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint \n\nLin D, Liu L, Zhang M, Hu Y, Yang Q, Guo J.
