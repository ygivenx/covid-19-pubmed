Fan, D.V.M.\n\nInfectious causes of hepatic disease include viruses (feline infectious peritonitis. feline leukemia virus), parasites (Toxocara cati, Platynosomum concinnum. Toxoplama gondii, Cytauxzoon felis), bacteria (suppurative cholangitis/cholangiohepatitis complex), and fungi (Mucor spp., Aspergillus spp).\n\nThe bacterial cholangitis/cholangiohepatitis complex is most common (see Chapter 29).\n\nAt least four different protozoal organisms have been associated with hepatic infections: Toxoplasma gondii; a coccidia-Iike organism from the protozoan family Eimeriidae; a protozoan parasite similar to Hepatozoon canis; and Cytauxzoon felis (see Chapter 75). T. gondii is the most frequently encountered protozoan parasite causing cholangitis/cholangiohepatitis.\n\nCats are infected by T. gondii by ingestion of sporulated oocysts or tissue cysts or transplacentally or lactationally from primary infection of the queen. Clinical toxoplasmosis is most severe in transplacentally infected or neonatally infected kittens; the type and severity of clinical illness depend on the degree and localization of tissue injury. The organism infects the gastrointestinal epithelium and disseminates through the blood. Intracellular replication of T. gondii tachyzoites results in destruction of infected cells and necrosis. Replication is common in hepatocytes and the pancreas and can result in hyperbilirubinemia from either hepatic disease or pancreatic disease. Hepatic disease seems to be uncommon in chronically infected cats. Clinical signs in acutely infected cats include anorexia, depression, fever, abdominal distension, crying. dyspnea, central nervous system signs, icterus, and death.\n\nA diagnosis of T. gondii infection can be made by various testing procedures. Tachyzoites may be detected cytologically in various tissues and body fluids (pleural and peritoneal effusions) during acute infection. Fecal examination for T. gondii oocysts may be beneficial 1-2 weeks after initial exposure. Serologic testing has become the most practical and accepted means of diagnosing T. gondii infection. Serologic evidence of recent or active infection consists of high IgM titers, or a fourfold or greater increase in IgG titers. However, these findings document only recent infection, not clinical disease due to infection.\n\nDrugs attempted for the treatment of acute extraintestinal toxoplasmosis include clindamycin (10-12.5 mglkg orally every 8-12 hr), pyrimethamine (0.25--0.5 mglkg orally every 12 hr), and trimethoprim-sulfonamide (15 mglkg orally every 12 hr). If pyrimethamine is used, it is generally combined with one of the other drugs; it is rarely given to cats because of the high incidence of side effects.\n\nCytauxzoon felis results in severe disease in most infected domestic cats (see Chapter 75). Hyperbilirubinemia in infected cats is probably due to two mechanisms: (I) red blood 151 cell destruction from the piroplasm stage and (2) hepatic dysfunction or cholestasis from hepatic infiltration by schizont-infected macrophages.\n\nThe liver fluke, Platynosomum concinnum, has been reported to infect cats in tropical to semitropical climates. Infestation with this trematode is uncommon but has been reported in cats living in or with a history of travel to Hawaii, Florida, Polynesia, Malaysia, New Guinea, Australia, Nigeria, Brazil, Bahamas, and Puerto Rico. Other species of trematodes that have been identified in the livers of cats include Amphimerus pseudoflineus, Opisthorcus tenuicollis, and Metorchus conjunctus; infestation with these species is rare.\n\nPlatynosomum concinnum requires two intermediate hosts to complete its life cycle: a land snail and a reptile (gecko, lizard, or skink) or amphibian (toad). Although most cats are subclinically infected, some cats with a high, chronic fluke burden may manifest weight loss, vomiting, diarrhea, icterus, and hepatomegaly (\"lizard poisoning\"). The presence of the flukes within the biliary system incites an inflammatory process that eventually may lead to bile duct fibrosis and biliary epithelial hyperplasia.\n\nDiagnosis of P. concinnum can be difficult because most cats are subclinically infected. Identification of the parasite by fecal examination has poor sensitivity because of the small number and variable morphology of P. concinnum eggs. Observe for the double-operculated eggs after fecal sedimentation. Cholecystocentesis is a more definitive means of diagnosing P. concinnum infection in cats; however, given the invasive nature of the procedure, it should be reserved for cases in which the index of suspicion for fluke infestation is high and the cat is clinically symptomatic.\n\nEffective treatment of P. concinnum infection remains poorly defined. Current recommendations are to administer albendazole (50 mglkg/day) until fluke eggs disappear from feces or fenbendazole (50 mglkg orally every 12 hr) for 5 consecutive days. Albendazole may cause bone marrow toxicity in cats treated for more than 5 consecutive days; therefore, the risk-benefit ratio must be considered with chronic administration of albendazole.\n\nToxocara cati migrates through the liver of cats after ingestion of larvated eggs or infected transport hosts (see Chapter 19). However. clinical findings consistent with liver disease are usually not detected. 12 . What are the clinical rmdings of liver disease due to feline infectious peritonitis?\n\nFeline infectious peritonitis (PIP) is thought to result from infection by a mutated variant of the universally prevalent feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). PIP can manifest as either effusive (wet) or noneffusive (dry), depending on predominant type (humoral or cell-mediated) and efficacy of the host's immune response (see Chapter 38). Hyperbilirubinemia has been associated most commonly with the noneffusive form of PIP. A primary mechanism for hyperbilirubinemia due to PIP is the formation of perivascular pyogranulomas within the hepatic parenchyma and bile duct system severe enough to cause either synthetic liver failure, intrahepatic biliary obstruction, or extrahepatic biliary obstruction. In addition, the hyperbilirubinemia associated with PIP can result from hepatic lipidosis induced by anorexia. The definitive diagnosis of hepatic involvement with the PIP virus requires a liver biopsy to document the characteristic lesions and to perform immunohistochemistry. Classical lesions include perivascular infiltration (arterioles and venules) of proliferating macrophages, lymphocytes, plasma cells. and neutrophils. Treatment responses are variable and prognosis is guarded."}
