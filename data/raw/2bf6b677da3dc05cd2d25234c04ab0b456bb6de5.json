In the central nervous system (CNS) none, or only low levels, of the MHC-coded Address for correspondence: Dr. M. Schultzberg, Department of Pathology, Karolinska Institute, Huddinge Hospital, S-141 86 Huddinge, Sweden.\n\nantigens are expressed (Lampson, 1987) . Brisk induction of these antigens in the brain has been observed in vitro, however, on exposure to viruses and 3,-interferon (Fierz et al., 1985; Massa et al., 1986; Suzumura et al., 1986) and in vivo during experimental autoimmune disorders (Fontana et al., 1987) and viral infections (Olsson et al., 1987) . In the present study, we have examined the appearance of MHC antigens and subsets of inflammatory cells in the brain of rats infected with Trypanosoma brucei brucei. This extracellular hemoflagellate does not seem to penetrate the intact blood-brain barrier (BBB), but can be localized to 0165-5728/89/$03.50 \u00a9 1989 Elsevier Science Publishers B.V. (Biomedical Division) areas in the nervous system which lack such a barrier, i.e. the choroid plexus, circumventricular organs and dorsal root ganglia (see Poltera et al., 1980; Schultzberg et al., 1988) . Here we report that MHC class I is induced not only in these organs, but also in two hypothalamic nuclei, i.e. the paraventricular (PVN) and the supraoptic (SO) nuclei.\n\nTen male Sprague-Dawley rats, 6 weeks old (Alab, Stockholm, Sweden), were injected intraperitoneally with a suspension of Trypanosoma brucei brucei. The strain, variable antigen type AnTat 1/1, derived from stabilate EATRO 1125, was obtained as a generous gift from Dr. Nestor van Meirvenne, Laboratory of Serology, Institute of Tropical Medicine 'Prince Leopold', Antwerp, Belgium, and was passaged once in rats before use. Each animal was injected with 0.2 ml of a suspension of trypanosomes in a phosphatesaline-glucose buffer, pH 8.0, containing 3000-5000 parasites per /tl. 13, 22 and 30 days after injection the rats were killed, the brains dissected and snap frozen. Three uninfected rats were used as controls. Cryostat sections (8 #m thick) of the brain were fixed in cold acetone (-20 \u00b0 C) and processed for immunohistochemistry. Endogenous peroxidase activity was extinguished by treatment with 0.3% H202 prior to incubation with antibodies. The following primary antibodies were used: Ox18, which labels MHC class I (Fukumoto et al., 1982) ; Ox6, which labels MHC class II (McMaster and Williams, 1979) ; Ox19, which is a pan T cell marker (rat CD5) (Dallman et al., 1984) ; Ox8, which labels suppressor/cytotoxic T-cells (rat CD8) (Brideau et al., 1980) ; W3/25, a marker for T-helper cells (Williams et al., 1977) , and some macrophages (rat CD4) (Barclay, 1981) . Ox18 was purchased from SeraLab (Crawley Down, U.K.). The other antibodies were purified from tissue culture supernatants of hybridomas obtained from Dr. Allan Williams, Oxford, U.K. (Holmdahl et al., 1985) . After incubation with the primary antibodies at room temperature for 60 min, the sections were thoroughly rinsed and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with biotinylated horse anti-mouse antibodies (Vector Lab., Burlingame, CA, U.S.A.) diluted 1:30 in 0.2% normal rat serum. The sections were then exposed to an avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (ABC kit, Vector Lab.) for 30 min at room temperature and reacted for peroxidase with 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole as a substrate (Kaplow, 1975) . The specificity of the staining and the optimal antibody concentrations to be used were tested on sections of lymphoid organs and brain. As controis, sections where the primary antibody was omitted, were used.\n\nIn brains from control rats there was some staining for MHC class I antigens in the leptomeninges and in the choroid plexus. Also the luminal surface of the endothelial cells in the intracerebral vessels showed immunoreactivity (Figs. 2B and 3B). In the circumventricular organs, i.e. the median eminence, the area postrema, the pineal gland, the subfornical organ and the neurohypophysis, there was a weak diffuse immunoreactivity in the tissue (Fig. 3B ). The rest of the brain parenchyma showed no staining with MHC class I antibodies.\n\nAt 13 days after injection of the trypanosomes a very strong, diffusely distributed, staining with MHC class I antibodies was seen in the circumventricular organs. In addition, there was marked staining of the neurons in the PVN and SO (Figs. 1 and 2A), whereas none, or only a faint immunoreactivity was discerned in these areas in control rats (Fig. 2B ). The immunoreactivity occurred in the cytoplasm of the nerve cell bodies ( Fig. 2A) . A strong immunoreaction for MHC class I was observed in the circumventricular organs also at 22 and 30 days after inoculation (Fig. 3A) , and from the median eminence the immunoreactivity had extended dorsally into the surrounding neuropil. An intense staining was seen around the subfornical organ. The strong immunoreaction encountered in the two hypothalamic nuclei was evident also at these later time points, and could easily be seen even at the macroscopical level. In addition, there was a marked generalized increase in immunoreactivity in endo- thelial cells both in intracerebral vessels and vessels in the leptomeninges and choroid plexus (Fig.  3A) . Antibodies against MHC class II antigens labelled only a few perivascular cells in the control brains. This was also the case for the circumventricular organs in these brains. After infection, the number of MHC class II-positive perivascular, macrophage-like cells had increased somewhat in the whole brain. The number of positive cells was especially large in the choroid plexus and in the circumventricular organs ( Fig.   2C-E) . The hypothalamic nuclei showed no more increase in the number of labelled macrophage-like cells than the rest of the brain parenchyma. There was no staining of neurons. Lymphocytes of the suppressor/cytotoxic phenotype had appeared in the choroid plexus and the circumventricular organs 13 days after inoculation (Fig. 3C ). They were more numerous after 22 and 30 days, and had now also to a limited extent infiltrated the rest of the brain parenchyma. A few such lymphocytes occurred also in the two hypothalamic nuclei. The W3/25 antibody labelled macrophages similar to the Ox6 antibody, but only an occasional lymphocytic cell.\n\nThe present study shows a distinct induction of MHC class I antigens in the circumventricular organs, where an early infiltration of trypanosomes occurs. In addition, there was a strong MHC class I reaction in the SO and PVN at an early stage in the disease. The neurons in these hypothalamic nuclei reside behind the BBB, but project outside this barrier, namely to the neurohypophysis and median eminence, both of which are circumventricular organs. It has already been shown that, after a nerve injury, MHC class I is induced on motor neurons (Maehlen et al., 1988) . This induction may be due to signals carried to the nerve cell body by retrograde axonal transport, as has been discussed for the chromatolytic response after axotomy (Kristensson, 1984) . The nature of such signals is unknown, but different neurotrophic factors and cytokines may be operative. Target-derived neurotrophic factors such as nerve growth factor (NGF) have been implicated in the maintenance of neuronal integrity (Thoenen and Barde, 1980) . A neurotrophic factor-mediated regulation might be disturbed by the inflammatory process in various ways, e.g. through the action of cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF) or interleukin-1 (IL-1) (Lindholm et al., 1987) ; indeed, IL-1 has recently been demonstrated in peripheral nerves (Schultzberg et al., 1987) . Cytokines are known to be potent MHC antigen inducers in vitro (Hirsch et al., 1983; Wong et al., 1984; Fierz et al., 1985; Lavi et al., 1987; Massa et al., 1987) . Both TNF and IL-1 are increased in the blood during trypanosome infections (Askonas and Bancroft, 1984; Le and VilEek, 1987) , and these substances may reach the projections of the paraventricular and supraoptic neurons outside the BBB. Furthermore, infiltrating lymphocytes and macrophages in the circumventricular organs could be a local source of cytokines (Kriegler et al., 1988) . Substances originating from invading trypanosomes should also be considered.\n\nThe biological significance, if any, of MHC class I induction in the hypothalamic neurons is not known. It may represent an increased immune responsiveness, as a defence mechanism during an infectious process, or could be due to one of the other functions of MHC class I antigens, such as in cellular interactions, which have been discussed (Dausset and Contu, 1980) . In addition, it may be noted that the hypothalamic neurons, where MHC class I induction was observed, contain a number of neuroendocrine hormones, including oxytocin, vasopressin, corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), cholecystokinin, dynorphin, angiotensin II, glucagon, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH), thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), somatostatin and neurotensin (Silverman and Pickard, 1983; Armstrong, 1985) . Disturbances in these substances may explain some of the symptoms observed in trypanosomiasis. It has been suggested that the immune system serves a sensory function by recognizing foreign antigens and, in response, releasing molecules (cytokines) to which the nervous system may react (Blalock, 1984) ; for example, systemic administration of recombinant IL-1 may cause a release of CRF from the hypothalamus (Berkenbosch et al., 1987) . The role of MHC class I molecules in these events needs further analysis.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that trypanosome infection causes the induction of MHC class I antigens in the PVN and SO, possibly due to inflammatory substances in the target areas producing retrograde axonal signals."}
