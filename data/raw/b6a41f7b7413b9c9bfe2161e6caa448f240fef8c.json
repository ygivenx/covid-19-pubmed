{"title": "Monoclonal Antibodies to the Matrix (El) Glycoprotein of Mouse Hepatitis Virus Protect Mice from Encephalitis", "body": "Mouse hepatitis viruses (MHV) are useful agents for studying experimental infections of the gastrointestinal and central nervous systems (1) . MHV are members of the Coronavirus group of animal viruses. The virion is composed of three structural proteins, the major glycoprotein (E2 or peplomer), a minor glycoprotein (El or matrix), and a nucleocapsid protein (N) (2) . In order to better understand the pathogenesis and immune response induced by these viruses, attempts have been made to alter the course of infection by administering monoclonal antibodies specific for viral structural proteins. Buchmeier and colleagues showed that some, but not all, neutralizing anti-E2 monoclonal antibodies protected mice from challenge with the neurotropic strain MHV-4 (JHMV) (3) . Interestingly, mice protected from acute encephalitis by anti-E2 monoclonal antibodies subsequently developed demyelination. Wege et al, (4) demonstrated that anti-E2 monoclonal antibodies protected suckling rats from MHV-4; these investigators also found that only anti-E2 monoclonal antibodies that both neutralized virus and inhibited cell fusion were protective. Nakanaga et a/. (5) examined monoclonal antibodies reactive with MHV-2 and showed that both anti-E2 and anti-N monoclonal antibodies protected mice from lethal MHV-2 induced hepatitis. Most recently, Lecomte et a/. (6) have reported that an anti-N monoclonal antibody which neutralizes MHV-3 in vitro in the presence of complement protects mice from lethal MHV-3 challenge.\n\nIn view of the demonstrations that anti-E2 and anti-N monoclonal antibodies protected rodents infected with ' MHV, we sought to determine whether monoclonal antibodies specific for the third structural protein, the El or matrix glycoprotein, could alter disease. Four monoclonal antibodies directed against the El glycoprotein of MHV-4 were evaluated for their ability to neutralize virus in vitro and protect mice from a normally fatal viral challenge (Table 1) . Unless stated otherwise, experiments used 6-week-old male C57BU6 mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) (seronegative for MHV) which were given 100 pg of purified monoclonal antibody intraperitoneally (ip) on the same day as intracerebral (ic) inoculation of 2000 plaque-forming units (PFU) of MHV-4, strain JHMV DS (7). Talbot and Buchmeier (8) have recently shown that administration of murine monoclonal antibodies ip results in significant, persistent plasma antibody titers in mice. In the absence of passively administered antibody, challenge with 2000 PFU ic of MHV-4, strain JHMV DS, led to a fatal encephalitis within 1 O-l 2 days in 26 of 29 mice. Monoclonal antibodies J. 1.3 and J.3.9 were found to protect mice from lethal ic challenge with MHV-4 (Table 1). However, monoclonal antibodies J.2.7 and J.3.1 1 consistently failed to protect mice, even when the amount of antibody was increased to 200 pg per recipient (data not shown). Protection did not correlate with IgG subclass, as IgG2a antibodies were both protective (J. 1.3 and J.3.9) and nonprotective (J.3.1 1). Also, protection did not correlate with virus neutralization in vitro in the presence of complement, since protective monoclonal antibodies J. 1.3 and J.3.9 were neutralizing and nonneutralizing in vitro, respectively (Table 1) . This result was unexpected, since, with the exception of two monoclonal antibodies reported by Nakanaga et a/. (5) , all previously described anti-MHV monoclonal antibodies which protect in viva neutralize virus in vitro. (40) In order to determine if protective antibodies were associated with a unique topographic site on the El molecule, we performed competitive binding studies with biotinylated antibodies, using previously described methods (9) . In this regard, Talbot et al. (10) have shown that the MHV-4 El has at least two major antigenic sites. Talbot et a/. (11) measured antibodies against one of these sites on El and found that significant amounts of antibody were produced during experimental infection. In preliminary studies, it was found that J.1.3 and J.3.9 recognize different antigenic sites on El. Furthermore, nonprotective antibodiesJ.2.7 and J.3.1 1 appear to bind to a site which overlaps the site recognized by J.1.3 (data not shown). Thus, it seems unlikely that protection is associated with binding to a single critical determinant on El. Although we did find a correlation between protection and the high relative avidities of monoclonal antibodies 1.1.3 and J.3.9 (Table l), additional testing with a larger panel of anti-El monoclonal antibodies will be required to evaluate the significance of this observation.\n\nThese initial findings were extended by more detailed studies in viva. By administering graded amounts of purified J. 1.3, we found that the minimal protective dose was approximately 40 kg. This result is similar to that of Boere et al. (12) who found that 10 pg of purified nonneutralizing monoclonal antibody against Semliki Forest virus was required for protection.\n\nBy contrast,\n\nBoere eta/. found that the minimal amount of protective neutralizing monoclonal antibody was only 0.1 pg ( 12) . Other ( 13-/5), but not all (16) , studies have also shown that nonneutralizing antiviral monoclonal antibodies are much less effective than neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, based on the amount of antibody needed for protection. To date the minimum amount of protective monoclonal antibodies directed against the N or and viral titers of brain homogenates were determined by limiting dilution assay on DBT or L2 cells as previously described (9) . For each group the titer is expressed as the mean + one standard deviation in PFU virus per gram of tissue.\n\nE2 MHV protein has not been determined in absolute units.\n\nTo evaluate the effect of delayed treatment with protective antibody, 100 pg of J.1.3 was given to groups of five mice at different times relative to viral challenge (Day 0). Antibody protected all mice at Day +l and Day +2 postinoculation.\n\nAt Day +3 only one of five mice survived, and at Day +4, no mice survived. Since MHV replication (9) and early mononuclear cell inflammation (17) are present in the brains of mice at 2 days p.i., these results indicate that monoclonal antibodies are not simply prophylactic or preventative, as they will promote recovery in mice after encephalitis has been initiated.\n\nSince the in vitro studies indicated that one of the anti-El monoclonal antibodies, J.1.3, neutralized virus in the presence of complement (Table l) , we sought to determine what role complement might play in viva during protection mediated by passive administration of antibody.\n\nThis issue was studied by two approaches.\n\nFirst, antibody-mediated protection was studied in Bl O.D2/nSnJ mice, which have normal complement, and in Bl O.D2/oSnJ mice, which are deficient in the C5 component of complement (Jackson Laboratory) (18) . Monoclonal antibody J.1.3 (100 pg/mouse) was given ip on the same day that 4000 PFU of MHV-4 was given ic to groups of eight mice that were 6 weeks of age. Both normal and complement-deficient mice tested by this protocol survived the infection. By contrast, only two of eight BlO.D2/nSnJ and one of eight Bl O.D2/oSnJ mice survived without antibody protection.\n\nIn a second experiment, cobra venom factor (CVF) (Diamedix, Miami, FL) (19) was used to deplete 6-week old C57BU6 mice of complement component C3 prior to ic challenge with 2000 PFU of virus. Mice were given 1 unit of CVF intravenously. Serum complement was measured by complement-dependent lysis of 51Cr-labeled rabbit red blood cells coated with goat antibody to rabbit erythrocytes (Organon Teknika-Cappel, Malvern, PA). All mice treated with CVF were found to be depleted of C3. Four groups of four mice each were studied: (1) virus only, (2) virus plus CVF, (3) virus plus J. 1.3, and (4) virus plus J. 1.3 and CVF. All mice receiving virus alone (group 1) and all mice receiving virus plus CVF (group 2) died by Day 12 postinoculation.\n\nOn the other hand, all mice given 100 pg of J. 1.3 on Day 0 survived, either without (group 3) or with (group 4) CVF depletion of complement. Thus, mice either genetically deficient in complement or pharmacologically depleted of complement were nevertheless protected by an anti-El monoclonal antibody from a normally lethal MHV-4 infection. These results suggest that complement does not play an essential role in viva during protection conferred by anti-El monoclonal antibody.\n\nIn order to monitor virus replication in viva, brain virus titers during passive protection were determined at 5 and 10 days postinoculation ( Table 2 ). Protection by antibody J. 1.3 was associated with a modest decrease in brain viral titer at Day 5 after infection, similar to that noted after protection by anti-E2 monoclonal antibodies (3). By contrast, mice protected by monoclonal antibody J.3.9 had no decrease in viral titer relative to that of unprotected control animals. These data indicate that survival does not necessarily depend on inhibition of net viral replication. They further raise the possibility that antibodies may protect mice by altering qualitative characteristics of infection, such as the cellular distribution of virus or the severity of viral cytopathogenicity.\n\nTo explore these possibilities, histological studies of the nervous system of unprotected and protected mice were undertaken.\n\nSeveral general neuropathological patterns were consistently noted. In unprotected mice, viral antigen was readily demonstrable in neurons of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus 5 days after inoculation (Fig. 1A) . Inflammation in meninges, brain parenchyma, and perivascular spaces (Fig. 1 C) was usually minimal to moderate. By contrast, mice protected with antibody J.1.3 showed much less involvement of neurons ( Fig. 1 B) , although inflammatory infiltrates in meninges, brain parenchyma, and perivascular spaces were often severe (Fig. 1 D) . Subacutely, at Day +30, protected mice showed rarefaction and intense inflammation in white matter, typical of MHV-4-induced demyelination (9) (Fig. 1 E) . These studies demonstrate that administration of monoclonal antibodies specific for the El protein of MHV protect mice from lethal viral challenge. The mechanism of this protection, however, remains uncertain. The evidence we have gathered indicates that anti-El monoclonal antibodies did not protect by virtue of a particular antibody isotype or by means of recognition of a specific topographic site on E 1. Neither in vitro neutralization nor reduction in viral replication in viva appeared to be an essential characteristic of protective antibodies; similarly, complement activity in viva also did not appear to be necessary for protection. On the other hand, histologic studies revealed distinctive findings which may indicate how anti-El monoclonal antibodies protect mice from MHV-4 challenge. We found that protected mice had increased parenchymal and perivascular cellular infiltration when compared to unprotected controls, similar to results reported by Nakanaga et a/. (5) . This suggests that passive anti-MHV antibody administration enhances cell-mediated immunity. One mechanism by which antibody may enhance cell-mediated immunity to viruses involves binding to Fc receptors on antigen presenting cells or to specific receptors on T cells. Experimentally, effector functions of T cells have been shown to be increased by these means after administration of antibodies to hepatitis B virus (20) .\n\nAnother significant histological finding in the animals which had been protected by anti-El monoclonal antibodies was that neurons were relatively spared by MHV-4. This observation is consistent with that of Buchmeier and colleagues (3) , who found that mice treated with anti-E2 monoclonal antibodies and challenged with MHV-4 showed little involvement of neurons. These mice also survived to show subacute demyelination. By contrast, mice that did not receive anti-E2 antibodies had an acute, fatal necrotizing encephalomyelitis with neuronophagia.\n\nThese studies parallel those with temperature-sensitive (21, 22) , plaque morphology (7, 23) and antigenic (9, (24) (25) (26) variants of MHV-4 which show increased propensity for demyelination. Thus, it appears that any variable which allows animals to survive the initial MHV-4 encephalitis, perhaps by attenuating viral cytopathogenicity for neurons, permits subacute demyelination to be manifest. Similarly, Harty et a/. (27) demonstrated that nonneutralizing antibodies to lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus protected mice from motor neuron disease, although the level of viral replication was unchanged. In these studies, antibody appeared to block the infection of neurons, while having no effect on the infection of nonneuronal central nervous system cells. Taken together, these findings are consistent with the observation that neurons are usually the critical targets of highly neurovirulent viruses. (28) . Nonneutralizing monoclonal antibodies have also been shown to protect animals against other neurotropic viruses, including Sindbis (29) (30) (31) , Semliki Forest (12, 32) , Western equine encephalitis (33) , Venezuelan equine encephalitis (13), St. Louis encephalitis (Id), herpes simplex (34), vesicular stomatitis (15) , and yellow fever viruses (7635).\n\nOur findings contrast with prior studies using monovalent (36) or monoclonal antibodies (3) which concluded that anti-El antibodies do not protect against MHV challenge. The differences between our study and previous reports may reflect the antibodies tested, the viruses used for challenge, or other experimental variables. To our knowledge, our results are the first demonstration that antibodies directed against a viral matrix protein will protect mice from viral challenge. Thus, immune responses to a matrix or minor glycoprotein, which is almost entirely embedded in the virion envelope (37, 38) and might not be expected to be highly immunogenic (36) , may nevertheless influence the outcome of disease. These observations may have significant implications for the design of vaccines and the understanding of anti-viral immunity.\n\nWe are grateful to Ligaya Pen and Cindy Fabricius-Segal for excellent technical assistance and Carol Flores for excellent editorial help with the manuscript.\n\nWe thank Dr. Wendy Gilmore for helpful criticisms and suggestions.
