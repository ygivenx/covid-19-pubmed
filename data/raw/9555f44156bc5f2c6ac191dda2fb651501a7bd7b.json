{"title": "Nucleoside analogs as a rich source of antiviral agents active against arthropod-borne flaviviruses", "body": "The genus Flavivirus belongs to the Flaviviridae family and includes more than 70 single-stranded plus-sense RNA viral species. Flaviviruses of human medical importance are tick-or mosquito-transmitted viruses with typical representatives being tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus (OHFV), Kyasanur Forest disease virus (KFDV), Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever virus (AHFV), Powassan virus (POWV), West Nile virus (WNV), dengue virus (DENV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), yellow fever virus (YFV), or Zika virus (ZIKV). 1, 2 The Flaviviridae family also includes some less known or neglected viruses, such as louping ill virus (LIV), Usutu virus, Langat virus, or Wesselsbron virus. [3] [4] [5] [6] The flaviviral genome is a single-stranded, plus-sense RNA of about 11 kb in length that encodes a single polyprotein, which is coand posttranslationally processed into three structural (capsid, premembrane or membrane, and envelope) and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5). 7 Both NS3 and NS5 proteins possess enzymatic activities reported to be important targets for antiviral development. Whereas NS3 acts as a serine protease, a 5 0 -RNA triphosphatase, a nucleoside triphosphatase (NTPase), and a helicase, 8, 9 NS5 consists of a complex containing the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the methyltransferase (MTase) activities. 10, 11 Flaviviral infections are accompanied by a wide spectrum of distinct clinical manifestations, ranging from relatively mild fevers and arthralgia to severe viscerotropic symptoms (YFV and DENV), hemorrhagic fevers (KFDV and OHFV), encephalitis/myelitis (JEV, WNV, and TBEV), and neuropathic or teratogenic manifestations (ZIKV). More than 200 million clinical cases of flaviviral infections, including numerous deaths, are reported annually worldwide. 12 Currently no specific antiviral therapies are available to treat patients with flaviviral infections, thus the search for safe and effective small-molecule inhibitors that would be active against these viruses represents a high research priority. 13 Nucleoside analog inhibitors have figured prominently in the search for effective antiviral agents. 14 Nucleoside analogs are synthetic, chemically modified nucleosides that mimic their physiological counterparts (endogenous nucleosides) and block cellular division or viral replication by impairment DNA/RNA synthesis or by inhibition of cellular or viral enzymes involved in nucleoside/tide metabolism ( Figure 1 ). 15 The first antiviral analogs were developed in the late 1960s and currently there are over 25 approved therapeutic nucleosides used for the therapy of viral infections of high medical importance, such as HIV/AIDS (tenofovir), 16, 17 hepatitis B (lamivudine/entecavir), 18, 19 hepatitis C (sofosbuvir), 20 or herpes infections (acyclovir). 21 So far, numerous nucleoside analogs have been described to inhibit arthropod-transmitted flaviviruses. Since these viruses are closely related to the hepatitis C virus (HCV), for which many potent inhibitors are being currently developed, anti-HCV nucleoside analogs represent promising tools to be repurposed against other viruses within the Flaviviridae family. 12 The aim of this review is to provide an overview of known antiviral agents targeting selected arthropodborne flaviviruses and to discuss their characteristic properties, modes of action, and advantages or limitations of their therapeutic use. Moreover, the important challenges and complications in antiflavivirus nucleoside analog development are highlighted and possible strategies to overcome their shortcomings are suggested.\n\nNucleoside analogs active against arthropod-borne flaviviruses are usually classified according to their targets in the viral life cycle. Such antiviral molecules act as inhibitors of flaviviral RdRp, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] MTase, 27, 28 and helicase/NTPase. 29, 30 Other nucleoside scaffolds suppress host cell enzymes involved particularly in nucleoside biosynthetic pathways [31] [32] [33] [34] or in some cases, exhibit multiple modes of action. 32, 35 In vitro antiviral effects and cytotoxicity profiles of the most important antiflavivirus nucleoside analogs are summarized in Table 1 . An overview of in vivo antiflaviviral activities of selected nucleosides as evaluated in different animal models is presented in Table 2 .\n\nThe flavivirus NS5 protein is approximately 900 amino acids in length and consists of the NH 2 -terminal MTase domain required for the 5 0 -RNA capping process and the COOH-terminal RdRp domain responsible for the replication of the viral RNA genome. 10, 36 Flaviviral RdRp is a right hand-shaped structure with fingers, palm, and thumb domains; the palm domain is the catalytic domain carrying the polymerase active site that coordinates two Mg 2\u00fe ions essential for catalyzing the polymerization reaction. 37 Nucleoside inhibitors of flaviviral RdRp are the most attractive targets for antiviral drug design; as human replication/transcription enzymes lack RdRp activity, such compounds are expected to show fewer deleterious side effects and favorable safety profiles. 12, 15, 38, 39 The mode of action for nucleoside RdRp inhibitors is based on the premature termination of viral nucleic acid synthesis. 40 Following the intracellular phosphorylation, the 5 0 -triphosphate metabolites are competitively incorporated into the flaviviral RNA nascent chains ( Figure 1 ). This prevents further extension of the incorporated analog by addition of the next nucleoside triphosphate resulting in formation of incomplete (nonfunctional) viral RNA chains. 41 Nucleoside inhibitors of flaviviral RdRp act as \"nonobligate chain terminators,\" as their 3 0 -hydroxyl group is conformationally constrained or sterically/ electronically hindered, thus decreasing the potency to form a phosphodiester linkage with the incoming nucleoside triphosphate. 40 The nonobligate terminators differ from \"obligate chain terminators,\" in which the 3 0 -hydroxy group is completely missing, as exemplified by numerous nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors for the treatment of HIV infections. 42 Chemical modifications of the heterobase moiety, different types of glycosidic bonds, and substitutions at different positions of the sugar ring, which are typical modifications for nucleoside inhibitors of flaviviral RdRps, are shown in Table 3 . Figure 1 . Intracellular uptake and metabolism of nucleoside analogs and nucleoside analog prodrugs. Nucleoside analogs enter cells through specific plasma membrane nucleoside transporters. Inside the cell, the compounds are phosphorylated by cellular nucleoside kinases resulting in formation of nucleoside mono-, di-, and triphosphates. The first kinase phosphorylation is the rate-limiting step of the triphosphate conversion, which can be overcome by the monophosphate prodrug approach based on the introduction of a phosphorylated group into the 5 0 nucleoside position. The phosphorylated group includes protecting moieties to increase hydrophobicity and facilitate the cellular uptake of the prodrug. Monophosphate prodrugs enter cells independently of membrane transporters and the protecting groups are removed by intracellular esterases or phosphoramidases after cell penetration. The triphosphates of nucleoside species represent the active forms of nucleoside analogs that act by inhibiting cellular or viral enzymes, such as DNA/RNA polymerases. During DNA/RNA replication, nucleoside analogs are incorporated into nascent DNA or RNA chains resulting in termination of nucleic acid synthesis or in accumulation of mutations in viral genomes to suppress viral replication due to error catastrophe. At normal physiological conditions, intracellular nucleoside concentrations are maintained at low levels due to nucleoside/nucleotide catabolic pathways, such as deamination (oxidation) of heterocyclic base, hydrolysis or phosphorolysis of heterocyclic base, and hydrolysis of phosphomonoester bonds. These catabolic reactions also concern most nucleoside analogs containing the natural N-glycosidic bond and/or the degradable functional groups of the heterocyclic base.

The increased antiviral potency could be related to an improved conversion of the prodrug to the biologically active form; however, the reported SI values (2.4-8.3) indicate a low therapeutic potential for this nucleoside to treat flaviviral infections. 45 Further substitutions of GS-441524 molecule at the C1 0 position with methyl, vinyl, or methyl-ethynyl moieties yielded compounds with considerably reduced potency and a narrower spectrum of antiviral activity. 43 2 0 -C-methyl substituted nucleosides 2 0 -C-Methyl-nucleoside scaffolds represent the initial major class of therapeutic nucleosides developed by Merck Research Laboratories to demonstrate potent inhibition of HCV replication. 46-50 Antiviral activity of 2 0 -C-methylated nucleosides beyond the Flaviviridae family was reported for representatives of Picornaviridae and Caliciviridae families, [51] [52] [53] indicating the potential for broad-spectrum inhibitory activity for these compounds within the positive single-stranded RNA viruses.\n\nThe 2 0 -C-methyl substituent introduced at the nucleoside b-face appears to be an important structural element for highly selective micromolar inhibition of tick-borne flaviviruses, particularly for TBEV, AHFV, KDFV, OHFV, and POWV, when assayed in porcine stable kidney cells (PS), human neuroblastoma cells UKF-NB4, or adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cells A549. 24, 54, 55 From mosquitotransmitted flaviviruses, 2 0 -C-methylated nucleosides inhibited WNV, DENV, and YFV in cell-based or cell-free reporter assay systems, showing low micromolar antiviral activities. 50, 56, 57 A phosphoramidate prodrug of 6-O-methyl-2 0 -C-methylguanosine, denoted as INX-08189, exerted nanomolar inhibitory activity against DENV-2, and the combination of INX-08189 with ribavirin resulted in significant synergistic anti-DENV activity in vitro. 58 7-Deaza-2 0 -C-methyladenosine together with other 2 0 -C-methylated species was the first described nucleoside-based inhibitors of ZIKV, after its epidemiological outbreaks in Oceania and Latin America. 23,59 7-Deaza-2 0 -C-methyladenosine showed anti-ZIKV potency not only on immortalized cell lines, but also on induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neuronal cell types, such as cortical neurons, motor neurons, and astrocytes. 60 The triphosphate analogs of 2 0 -C-methylated nucleosides exhibited strong inhibitory activity in a \n\npolymerase-based in vitro assay using an active recombinant ZIKV RdRp. 61 Strong antiflaviviral activity for several 2 0 -C-methyl modified nucleosides was also demonstrated using numerous in vivo efficacy models. For example, 7deaza-2 0 -C-methyladenosine substantially improved disease outcome, increased survival, and reduced signs of neuroinfection and viral titers in the brains of BALB/c mice infected with a lethal dose of TBEV. 62 This compound also reduced viremia in AG129 mice infected with the African strain of ZIKV. 59 Moreover, 2 0 -C-methylcytidine protected suckling mice challenged with DENV 56 and hamsters infected with a lethal dose of YFV, even when administered up to three days postinfection. 63 2 0 -Fluoro-2 0 -C-methyl substituted nucleosides Similar to the 2 0 -C-methylated nucleosides, analogs possessing the 2 0 -a-fluoro-2 0 -b-C-methyl modification were initially identified as promising inhibitors of HCV polymerase activity. 64 Sofosbuvir, a phosphoramidate prodrug of 2 0 -fluoro-2 0 -C-methyluridine developed by Gilead Sciences, Inc., is one of the most potent and selective inhibitors in this series and was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of chronic HCV infection. 65 Sofosbuvir is nontoxic for most human cell lines and is a very poor substrate for human mitochondrial RdRp, resulting in an acceptable safety profile and negligible mitochondrial toxicity. 66, 67 Sofosbuvir was demonstrated to inhibit the ZIKV RdRp in a recombinant polymerase assay 68 and to suppress ZIKV replication in different cell-based systems using U87 glioblastoma cells, baby hamster kidney fibroblasts (BHK-21), SH-sy5y neuroblasts, hepatocarcinoma Huh-7 cells, Jar human placental choriocarcinoma cells, neural stem cells, and brain organoids with nanomolar or low micromolar inhibitory activity. 25, 69 Interestingly, no inhibition of ZIKV replication with sofosbuvir even at the 50 mM level was observed in Vero cells, 23 indicating that the sofosbuvir-mediated anti-ZIKV effect is strongly cell-type dependent. 70 Sofosbuvir protected inbred C57BL/6J mice, which were previously immunosuppressed with a single dose of anti-Ifnar1 blocking monoclonal antibody, against ZIKV-induced mortality. 69 Moreover, this compound reduced viral titer in blood plasma, spleen, kidney, and brain in suckling Swiss albino mice and prevented virus-induced neuromotor impairment in ZIKVinfected animals. 71 Surprisingly however, sofosbuvir was inactive against TBEV, when screened on both PS and UKF-NB4 cells. 54 Another 2 0 -a-fluoro-2 0 -b-C-methyl modified nucleoside, PSI-6206, and its 3 0 ,5 0 -diester prodrug mericitabine, also displayed no activity against TBEV replication. The lack of anti-TBEV activity for the 2 0 -a-fluoro-2 0 -b-C-methyl modified nucleosides could be ascribed to their inefficient intracellular conversion to their corresponding triphosphates and, moreover, to extensive deamination/demethylation in the tested cell cultures resulting in their conversion to uridine. 46 showing a significantly improved cytotoxicity profile (CC 50 of >100 mM) compared with that of 2 0 -C-ethynyladenosine. 26 NITD008 was also assayed against WNV, YFV, and ZIKV and exhibited excellent in vitro inhibitory parameters and a protective effect against WNV and ZIKV infections in mouse efficacy models. 26, 76 NITD008 was also reported to effectively inhibit the in vitro replication of TBEV, AHFV, KDFV, OHFV, and POWV, with nanomolar or low micromolar antiviral levels observed in various cellbased screening systems. 77 Introduction of the C7 carbamoyl moiety to NITD008 molecule provided another 2 0 -ethynyl modified derivative, referred to as NITD449. Despite its low micromolar anti-DENV efficacy, this nucleoside disappointingly exhibited only low levels in plasma when dosed orally. 72 To increase the oral bioavailability, the isobutyryl ester prodrug of NITD449, designed as NITD203, was synthesized. NITD203 successfully exhibited both nanomolar anti-DENV activity as well as improved pharmacokinetic parameters. 72 Although NITD008 and NITD203 showed anti-DENV potency in rodent models, even when the treatment was delayed up to 48 h after infection, both nucleosides failed in preclinical toxicity studies in rats and dogs due to their insufficient safety profiles. 26, 72 NITD008 failed to achieve no-observed-adverse-effect levels (NOAEL) when rats (10 mg/kg/day) and dogs (1 mg/kg/day) were dosed daily for two weeks. 26 Similarly, NOAEL was not achieved for NITD203 in the two-week toxicity test when rats were dosed at 30 and 75 mg/kg/day. 72 Further substitutions of the C7 position of NITD008 with fluoro or cyano moieties provided compounds with nano-or low micromolar anti-DENV activities and acceptable cytotoxicity profiles. In contrast, 2 0 -C-ethyl, -vinyl, or -methylethynyl substituted derivatives of 2 0 -C-ethynyladenosine were completely inactive when tested against DENV. Similarly, the exchange of the adenine base for cytosine or guanine also yielded inactive compounds. 22, 72 2 0 -O-substituted nucleosides 2 0 -O-Methyl substituted adenosine, guanosine, cytidine, and uridine were evaluated for their potential anti-TBEV activity; however, no or negligible antiviral effects were observed when tested in both PS and UKF-NB4 cells. 54 Such abrogation of the nucleoside inhibitory activity could be related to the elimination of the 2 0 -a-hydroxy hydrogen bond donor/acceptor properties when the methyl moiety is introduced at the nucleoside O2 0 position. 46, 54 The ability of flaviviral RdRp to discriminate among nucleosides modified at the 2 0 -position on the nucleoside a-face is likely related to the need of the polymerase to avoid incorporation of 2 0 -a-deoxynucleoside monophosphates into the viral nascent RNA chain. 46 3 0 -C-and 3 0 -O-substituted nucleosides Methylation of the C3 0 or O3 0 position to generate the corresponding 3 0 -C-methyl or 3 0 -O-methyl modified structures resulted in a complete loss of anti-TBEV activity, regardless of the purine/pyrimidine heterobase identity. These nucleosides exerted no cytotoxic effects and caused no morphological changes in PS or porcine embryo kidney (PEK) cell cultures. 35, 54 Similarly, 3 0deoxynucleosides exhibited no detectable inhibitory effect on TBEV replication. 54 In contrast, several nucleosides with a trityl group at the C3 0 position showed micromolar inhibitory activity against DENV and YFV (see below). 78 The observed inactivity of 3 0 -O-methylated and 3 0 -dehydroxylated nucleosides could be related to either a strict requirement of the TBEV RdRp active site for a 3 0 -hydroxyl group to form the appropriate hydrogen bonding interactions with the nucleoside triphosphate molecule, or, to inefficient cellular uptake and metabolism to convert the nucleoside molecule into the corresponding triphosphate form. 46, 54 4 0 -Azido substituted nucleosides Using high-throughput screening of large nucleoside libraries in combination with a rational drug design approach by investigators at Roche, several cytidine analogs with an azido group at the C4 0 position were identified as potent inhibitors of HCV replication in subgenomic replicon assays. [79] [80] [81] It was later shown that these compounds were also highly active against henipaviruses and other paramyxoviruses. 82 Two 4 0azido modified nucleoside analogs, 4 0 -azidocytidine (R-1479) and 4 0 -azido-aracytidine (RO-9187), showed nano-or micromolar in vitro antiviral activity against TBEV. 54 Moreover, both compounds were found to be active also against WNV (L. Eyer, manuscript in preparation).\n\nThe anti-TBEV activity of RO-9187 (the arabinocounterpart of 4 0 -azidocytidine) was unexpected, as this compound lacks the 2 0 -a-hydroxy moiety, a determinant which was generally considered to be crucial for specific hydrogen-bonding interactions with RdRps during the RNA replication process. 54,80 Some additional interactions of the polymerase active site with both the 2 0 -b-hydroxy substituent and the 4 0 -azido substituent are thought to compensate for the loss of the 2 0 -a-hydroxy interaction, resulting in the strong and selective anti-TBEV activity of RO-9187. Interestingly, the anti-TBEV efficacy of both 4 0 -azido modified nucleosides was cell-type dependent; the compounds were active only in PS cells, but not in UKF-NB4 cells. 54 An ester prodrug of 4 0 -azidocytidine, denoted as balapiravir, was completely inactive against TBEV in vitro, probably because of its poor intracellular uptake or insufficient kinase phosphorylation in the tested host cell lines. 54 In contrast, balapiravir was reported to show strong in vitro antiviral activity against DENV of various serotypes; it was the first direct antiviral agent tested clinically for DENV infection. Unfortunately, this compound failed to achieve antiviral efficacy in DENV patients, which was reflected in a negligible reduction of DENV viremia and persistence of clinical symptoms, even though the plasma concentration of the compound was higher than the 50% effective concentration. 83 One of the possible explanations is that DENV infection stimulates PBMCs to produce cytokines, which are responsible for the decreased efficiency of the conversion of balapiravir to its triphosphate form. 84 Interestingly, nucleoside analogs combining the 4 0azido moiety with the 2 0 -C-methyl group in one molecule (e.g. 2 0 -C-methyl-4 0 -azidocytidine) did not exhibit any antiviral activity when tested against HCV; however, the corresponding 5 0 -monophosphate prodrugs displayed considerably improved virus inhibitory effects (EC 50 values in the micromolar ranges) without apparent cytotoxicity. 85 Other interesting compounds, 4 0 -azido-2 0 -deoxy-2 0 -C-methylcytidine and its ester prodrugs, were found to show nano-or low micromolar antiviral efficacy in vitro. 86 Unfortunately, such nucleoside scaffolds have not been evaluated against arthropod-borne flaviviruses; the reported results originate from HCV replicon-based assays. 85, 86 Imino-C-nucleoside analog BCX4430 BCX4430, developed by BioCryst Pharmaceuticals Inc., is an adenosine analog with the furanose oxygen on the ribose ring replaced by nitrogen and the heterobase nitrogen 9 replaced by carbon. 87 This interesting nucleoside is classified as imino-C-nucleoside. 88 BCX4430 was initially described as an inhibitor of filovirus infections, exerting antiviral activity against a broad spectrum of single-stranded RNA viruses, particularly against members of the Bunyaviridae, Arenaviridae, Picornaviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Coronaviridae, and Flaviviridae families. 89 Currently, this compound has entered Phase I clinical trials for Ebola virus disease treatment focused on intramuscular administration of BCX4430 in healthy volunteers and to date has shown promising pharmacokinetics properties and good tolerability. 87 BCX4430 is active against numerous mosquitotransmitted flaviviruses, such as WNV (EC 50 of 2.33 mM) 90 and representatives of both the African and Asian lineages of ZIKV (3.8-11.7 mg/ml). 91 For YFV, JEV, and DENV-2, micromolar EC 50 values were reported. 89 In vivo efficacy of BCX4430 was also demonstrated in a lethal hamster model of YFV infection and in a mouse model of ZIKV infection. 91, 92 Low micromolar antiviral activity of BCX4430 was also described for some of the medically important tick-borne flaviviruses, such as TBEV, LIV, and KFDV. 90\n\nHeterocyclic base-modified nucleosides with demonstrated antiflaviviral activities include T-1106, 93-95 6methyl-7-deazaadenosine, 96 and numerous N6-alkyl or aryl substituted nucleosides. 35, 97 T-1106 is a ribosylated analog of the pyrazine derivative T-705 (6-fluoro-3-hydroxy-2-pyrazinecarboxamide, favipiravir), 98 which was described to inhibit the HCV RdRp in enzyme assays. 93 Nucleoside inhibitor T-1106 displayed a negligible in vitro activity against YFV in Vero cells, as well as in luciferase-based assays. 94 In contrast, this compound exerted favorable efficacy, bioavailability, and low toxicity in a hamster model of YFV infection, using a hamster-adapted Jimenez YFV strain. After intraperitoneal application of 100 mg/kg/day, T-1106 improved survival rates, serum parameters, weight gain, and mean day to death when administered up to four days after virus challenge. 93, 94 In this model, the combination of T-1106 with ribavirin gave superior effects compared to monotherapy (with either T-1106 or ribavirin). 95 6-Methyl-7-deazaadenosine is a hydrophobic mimic of adenosine showing nanomolar antiviral activity against DENV-2 in a Vero cell-based screening system, as well as in luciferase-driven DENV-2 replicon assay, with no cytotoxic effects noted after 7 h of treatment. 96 Related compounds such as 6-methyl-1-deazaadenosine and 6-methyl-4-deazaadenosine were completely inactive when tested against DENV-2. Mechanistic studies of the 5 0 -triphosphate of 6methyl-7-deazaadenosine revealed that this nucleotide is an efficient substrate for viral RdRp (screened against polio RdRp) and is incorporated into nascent viral RNA strains mimicking both ATP and GTP. 96 N6-Alkyl or aryl substituted nucleosides, originally identified as inhibitors of Lassa fever virus, Marburg virus, and enterovirus A71, showed interesting bioactivity profiles when tested against TBEV. 35, 99, 100 Whereas N6-methyladenosine and N6-benzyladenosine were completely inactive, nucleosides with bulky substituents, such as N6-(9-anthracenylmethyl)adenosine and N6-(1-pyrenylmethyl)adenosine, exerted a micromolar anti-TBEV effect. In contrast, N2-and N4substituted analogs showed no antiviral activity. Moderate anti-YFV and anti-DENV activities were also observed in N6-subsitituted analogs of 5 0 ,3 0 -Oand 5 0 ,2 0 -O-tert-butyldiphenylsilyl-modified adenosine. 97 The mechanism of action of these nucleosides is poorly understood; however, they likely interact with the RdRp or MTase domain of the flaviviral NS5 protein, as demonstrated by docking studies. 35 Bulky aromatic substituents could also play a role in the interaction with the viral membrane resulting in cell entry inhibition. 101 \n\nIn a large-scale cell-based screening campaign of alkylated, silylated, or acylated pyrimidine nucleosides, 2 0 ,5 0 di-O-trityluridine and 3 0 ,5 0 di-O-trytiluridine were identified as inhibitors of DENV-2 and YFV replication, showing high antiviral potency and favorable cytotoxicity profiles in Vero cells. 78, 102, 103 Substantial antiviral effect against YFV was observed also in 2 0deoxy-3 0 ,5 0 -di-O-trityluridine and in several 5-halogenated bis-tritylated pyrimidine nucleosides; however, their anti-DENV activity was proven to be weaker. 104 Thymidine or 2 0 -deoxyuridine congeners of 2 0 ,5 0 -and 3 0 ,5 0 -tritylated nucleosides led to the loss of antiflavivirus activity or to increased compound cytotoxicity.\n\nThe mechanisms of action of tritylated nucleosides are not completely understood. Based on the observed inhibition of DENV replication in subgenomic replicon assays, it is assumed that these compounds may be acting as inhibitors of intracellular viral replication events rather than suppressing either early or late processes of viral infection, such as entry or assembly. 103 Although the presence of large, hydrophobic trityl moieties does not make these structures ideal candidates for further drug development, their chemical structures may provide valuable information for advanced mechanistic studies and for further development of related nucleoside scaffolds with improved biological parameters. 104 \n\nThe NH 2 domain of flaviviral NS5 protein is associated with the virus's MTase activity, which is involved in methylation of the 5 0 -cap structure of genomic RNA. 8, 105 The flaviviral cap structure is formed by the conserved dinucleotide sequence AG (m7GpppAm) and is crucial for mRNA stability and efficient translation. 106 Two topologically distinct methylation reactions are mediated by the flaviviral NS5 MTase: the N7 of guanine is methylated by the (guanine-N7)-MTase and the first nucleotide of RNA transcript is further methylated at the ribose 2 0 -hydroxyl by (nucleoside-2 0 -O)-MTase. The resulting product of the methyl donation for both methylation reactions by S-adenosyl-L-methionine is the nucleoside analog Sadenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH). 107 SAH and the nucleoside antibiotic sinefungin are natural nonselective inhibitors of many eukaryotic and viral MTases, including those of DENV 108,109 or ZIKV. 61 Chemical derivatization of SAH at the N6 position provided inhibitors with nano-or low micromolar activity against DENV MTase, which did not inhibit the corresponding human enzymes. 110 Other rationally designed nucleosides with potent inhibitory activity against MTase contain a thymine base with a hydrophobic methyl tert-butyl substituent at the 5 0 position of the sugar moiety. 111 Two of these nucleosides, GRL-002 and GRL-003, inhibited the N7 and 2 0 -O MTase activity of WNV in enzyme-based assays and the observed MTase inhibition was in agreement with the micromolar in vitro anti-WNV efficacy. 111 Another class of promising selective antiflavivirus compounds is represented by 5 0 -silylated 3 0 -1,2,3-triazole-substituted nucleoside scaffolds derived from 3 0 -azidothymidine. Similar structures were originally developed for HIV-1 inhibition. 27 Both the 5 0 -silyl protecting group and the 3 0 bulky triazole substituent appeared to be crucial structural elements for low micromolar inhibition of flaviviral MTase in enzyme-based assays, as well as for inhibition of WNV and DENV replication in cell culture. These nucleosides inhibit the methylation reactions through competitive interactions with the substrate binding site and also with the GTP-binding pocket of the flaviviral NS5 MTase. 28 Recently, a novel series of flexible nucleoside analogs known as \"fleximers\" have exhibited activity against several hard to treat viruses, including filoviruses such as Ebola and Sudan, 112 coronaviruses including Severe Acute Respiratory Virus and Middle East Respiratory Virus, 113 as well as most recently, flaviviruses including ZIKV and DENV. The fleximers feature a \"split\" purine nucleobase that has been shown to impart significant activity to the nucleoside scaffold as well as to allow it to overcome resistance related to point mutations. [114] [115] [116] The most recent series combined the fleximer approach with the acyclic nucleoside acyclovir, an FDA approved drug for herpes virus. While these analogs inhibited the aforementioned viruses, acyclovir shows no activity against any of those viruses, thereby underscoring the importance of the fleximer approach. Since those initial findings, these compounds have also demonstrated potent activity against DENV and ZIKV (K. Seley-Radtke, manuscript in preparation). Preliminary results indicate that these compounds target the DENV and ZIKV NS5 in at least its cap-MTase activity, with negligible effects on the cognate human N7-MTase. In that regard, initial screening revealed promising levels of MTase inhibition, particularly for the triphosphate of the compound (Flex 1-TP), with an IC 50 of 22 mM for both the DENV and ZIKV 2 0 -O-MTase (K. Seley-Radtke, manuscript in preparation). As a result, Flex 1-TP was further tested against DENV NS5, and while it was not incorporated, it successfully inhibited further incorporations of additional nucleotides, thereby halting replication, however not as a typical chain terminator. In addition, the acetate-protected dimethoxy analog (Flex 2) is a potent DENV inhibitor (3.2 mM, unpublished results, Smee laboratory, Utah); however, more work needs to be done to fully elucidate these novel compounds' mechanism of action. It may well be that these nucleotide analogs target the NS5 protein at both the RdRp and MTase regions, which would make them highly effective viral inhibitors, with low probability of viral resistance developing.\n\nFlaviviral NTPase and helicase activities are associated with the COOH-proximal domain of the NS3 protein. 117 Flaviviral helicases are capable of unwinding duplex RNA structures during viral replication by disrupting the hydrogen bonds keeping the two strands together. 118, 119 The helicase activity is strictly associated with NTP hydrolysis (NTPase activity); the released chemical energy is used for the translocation of the enzyme along the double-helix structures, capturing the exposed single strand regions or for a direct disruption of the hydrogen bonds between the two RNA strains. 120 Specific nucleoside inhibitors of flaviviral NTPase/ helicase can interact with dsRNA or DNA resulting in the weakened stability of double-helix structures or by steric hindrance of translocation of the enzyme along the polynucleotide chain. Such a mechanism could modulate the efficacy of the unwinding reaction or NTPase activity of the enzyme and therefore, affect the viral replication process. [117] [118] [119] [120] [121] Weak inhibitory effects on flaviviral NTPase/helicases were described for ribavirin triphosphate, 124,125 5 0 -O-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl esters of purine nucleosides, 126, 127 or halogenated benzotriazole-modified nucleosides. 30, 122 These compounds were primarily evaluated in enzyme-based assays for their putative anti-HCV activity; however, some of them have been found to inhibit also NTPase/helicases of WNV, JEV, or DENV. [117] [118] [119] [120] [121] [122] [123] [124] [125] [126] [127] Ribavirin and other nucleoside synthesis inhibitors Ribavirin, a nucleoside analog featuring a [1, 2, 4] triazole ring for a nucleobase, is a licensed drug against various RNA viruses. The predominant inhibitory mechanism for ribavirin against flaviviral replication is the suppression of de novo biosynthesis of guanine nucleotides through direct inhibition of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, an enzyme converting inosine monophosphate to xanthosine monophosphate, a precursor in GTP biosynthesis. 32 Speculation over other modes of action for ribavirin includes specific inhibition of the viral RdRp, 128 accumulation of mutations in viral genomes resulting in error catastrophe, 129, 130 interference with mRNA capping guanylation, 131 and immuno-modulation promoting the Th1 antiviral response. 32, 132, 133 Ribavirin was shown to exert a moderate inhibitory effect for multiple mosquito-borne flaviviruses in various cell cultures, 31, 134, 135 often being used as a positive control in many in vitro 25, 59, 92 and in vivo antiviral studies. [91] [92] [93] [94] Ribavirin administered to YVF-infected hamsters challenged intraperitoneally, resulted in significant improvement in survival rates, even if the therapy was started two days post-YFV infection. 93, 94 In contrast however, in primates, only a weak prophylactic effect on viremia in rhesus monkeys challenged with DENV was observed. 136 Several ribavirin derivatives were recently synthesized and showed interesting bioactivity profiles: ETAR (1-b-D-ribofuranosyl-3-ethynyl- [1, 2, 4] triazole) and IM18 (1-b-D-ribofuranosyl-4-ethynyl- [1, 3] imidazole) inhibited DENV-2 replication in Vero cells by more than 10-fold compared with ribavirin and showed no detectable cytotoxic effects up to 1000 mM. 135 Another derivative, EICAR (1-b-D-ribofuranosyl-5-ethynyl-imidazole-4-carboxamide), was reported to possess a similar in vitro spectrum of antiviral activity, but lower selectivity compared with those of ribavirin. 137 Two nucleosides whose antiviral activity is based on the depletion of the intracellular nucleoside pool are 6azauridine and 5-aza-7-deazaguanosine. 6-Azauridine and its derivatives are inhibitors of orotidine monophosphate decarboxylase blocking cellular de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. 31,33 6-Azauridine proved to be active against numerous arthropod-borne flaviviruses, 55 however exhibited slight cytotoxicity with an inhibitory effect on the growth of host cells. 24 A triacetate prodrug of 6-azauridine showed low micromolar activity against AHFV and WNV in vitro 55 and very low toxicity in both animal and human studies. 138 Another derivative, 2-thio-6-azauridine, exerted a moderate inhibitory effect on WNV. 33 Similar results were achieved using 5-aza-7-deazaguanosine (ZX-2401) 139 ; this compound exhibited synergistic in vitro anti-YFV activity in combination with interferon. The mechanism of action for 5-aza-7-deazaguanosine is currently unknown; however, it is conceivable that it likely resembles that of ribavirin. 34 \n\nNucleoside derivatives containing bulky aromatic substituents (perylene or pyrene moieties) attached to the heterocyclic base were originally synthesized as fluorescent nucleoside probes [140] [141] [142] ; later these structures were identified as inhibitors of herpes simplex virus, type 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2), vesicular stomatitis virus, and Sindbis virus replication. 143 Further studies demonstrated their broad-spectrum antiviral activity against other enveloped viruses, such as influenza virus, murine cytomegalovirus, and HCV. 144 The mechanism of action of these rigid amphipathic nucleosides is based on their incorporation into the viral or cellular membranes, preventing fusion. 143, 144 Alternatively, these nucleosides may also function by photosensitization of lipid membranes, resulting in irreversible damage of enveloped virion particles. 145 5-(Perylen-3-yl)ethynyl-arabinouridine and 5-(perylen-3-yl)ethynyl-2 0 -deoxyuridine were shown to act as strong inhibitors of TBEV in PEK cell culture. 101 The perylene moiety as well as the rigid ethynyl linker appeared as crucial structural elements for nanomolar anti-TBEV activity and low cytotoxicity (>50 mM). Interestingly, uracil nucleosides bearing the pyrene moiety, such as 5-[(pyren-3-yl)methoxypropyn-1-yl]-2 0 -deoxyuridine and 5-(pyren-1-yl)ethynyl-2 0 -deoxyuridine, showed almost a 10-fold lower anti-TBEV potency compared to their perylene-substituted counterparts. Such compounds, if not used as therapeutic agents, could still contribute to a better understanding of different modes of action of various nucleoside scaffolds. 101 Challenges and complications of antiflavivirus nucleoside analog development Introduction of various chemical substituents into different positions of the nucleoside scaffold can dramatically affect the physicochemical properties of the compound. Such modifications can also significantly influence the compound's biological/pharmacokinetic parameters, such as cellular uptake, 15,146 the ability of the compound to be activated (phosphorylated) by cellular kinases, 147 degradation by nucleoside catabolic enzymes, 148 or cellular toxicity. 149, 150 Use of nucleoside analogs can also result in the undesirable emergence of drug-resistant virus mutants. [151] [152] [153] This section highlights the most important challenges and complications toward the development of nucleoside inhibitors of arthropod-transmitted flaviviruses and suggests possible strategies to surmount these difficulties.\n\nFor most nucleoside analogs, the first kinase phosphorylation is the rate-limiting step for the conversion to the nucleoside triphosphates. This limitation has a major influence on nucleoside analog antiviral activity 147,154 but can be bypassed by the use of a monophosphate prodrug approach based on the introduction of the phosphorylated group into the 5 0 nucleoside position. The phosphorylated group includes masking moieties on the charged phosphate leading to a neutral and eventually hydrophobic entity able to deliver the nucleoside 5 0 -monophosphate into the cells (Figure 1 ). 15 The monophosphate prodrug approach has been shown to convert some inactive nucleosides into strong inhibitors, or, has improved the kinetics parameters of intracellular nucleoside triphosphate formation. 85 This strategy, together with enantioselective purification, led to the development of the phosphoramidate prodrug sofosbuvir, which exhibited considerably increased phosphorylation efficacy compared to the parent nucleoside, 2 0 -C-fluoro-2 0 -C-methyluridine. 155, 156 Rapid degradation of nucleoside analogs by nucleoside catabolic pathways (Figure 1) is another undesirable phenomenon, which can adversely affect the antiviral potency of some nucleoside analogs. 148 To address this problem, appropriate structural changes can be introduced into the nucleoside scaffolds to protect the nucleosides from metabolic deactivation. 157 Such a strategy was successful for 2 0 -C-methyladenosine, which was found to be rapidly deaminated by cellular adenosine deaminase to the inactive inosine derivative and/or degraded by purine nucleoside phosphorylase, resulting in poor bioavailability and rapid clearance of the nucleoside in plasma. 49, 50 Substitution of the adenine N7 nitrogen for a carbon provided metabolically stable 7-deaza-2 0 -C-methyladenosine, which is a poor substrate for both nucleoside catabolic enzymes. This compound was characterized by excellent bioavailability and half-life in beagle dogs and rhesus monkeys. 50 Another possible strategy to increase the metabolic stability of therapeutic nucleosides is based on the introduction of a C-glycosidic bond into the nucleoside scaffold to generate C-nucleoside analogs, such as BCX4430 89 or GS-5734. 43 The major advantage of C-nucleosides over the canonical N-nucleosides lies in their resistance to unwanted phosphorolysis by intracellular phosphorylases, which otherwise would cleave the N-glycosidic linkage. 88 Individual host cellular types can display differences in expression levels of nucleoside kinases and other enzymes/proteins involved in nucleoside metabolism and transport. This can then result in cell-type dependent antiviral activity as manifested by different EC 50 values for the same inhibitor when assayed on different cell lines. 158, 159 Strong anti-TBEV activity for 2 0 -Cmethylguanosine, 4 0 -azidocytidine, and 4 0 -azido-aracytidine in PS cells was associated with rapid and efficient nucleoside conversion to the corresponding triphosphates. On the other hand, no anti-TBEV effect or phosphorylation products were observed when both compounds were tested in UKF-NB4. 54 Similarly, the loss of anti-ZIKV activity in Vero cells for sofosbuvir is likely related to the increased expression of the multidrug resistance ABC transporter in this cell line, resulting in the efflux of the compound from the cells. 23, 25 Clearly, cell-type dependent antiviral activity of some nucleosides can considerably affect the results of antiviral screens and therefore, using multiple clinically relevant cell lines for evaluation of compounds for antiviral activity is important. 70 Another possible complication in nucleoside drug development is an undesirable toxicity profile for the nucleoside inhibitor, which can be related to poor selectivity between viral and human enzymes. 39, 149, 150 A typical example of a nonselective nucleoside analog is 7-deazaadenosine (tubercidin), which exhibits high in vitro cytotoxicity. This has been attributed to the incorporation of tubercidin monophosphate into cellular DNA/RNA by human polymerases. 50 In contrast, two derivatives of tubercidin, 7-deaza-2 0 -C-methyladenosine and 6-methyl-7-deazaadenosine, are selectively recognized by flaviviral RdRp and are nontoxic in most mammalian cell lines. 50, 96 Some nucleoside analogs inhibit the mitochondrial DNA or RNA polymerase c, resulting in mitochondrial toxicity. 149, 160 This has been the primary reason for the failure of several promising nucleosides/prodrugs in clinical trials, as has been shown for some 2 0 -C-methyl-and 4 0 -azido modified nucleosides. 67 Newly developed compounds should also be evaluated for their genotoxicity and mutagenicity, as well as for renal, cardiovascular, or liver toxicity using various biochemical in vitro assays. [161] [162] [163] Nevertheless, even if a compound successfully passes through numerous in vitro tests, it can still exhibit harmful side effects when tested in animals, as observed with the adenosine analog NITD008. 26 In that regard, the availability of suitable animal models is crucial for the successful evaluation of a nucleoside's therapeutic in vivo antiviral efficacy. Some flaviviruses, particularly DEVN and ZIKV, do not readily replicate or cause pathology in immunocompetent mice and, therefore, the use of these rodents as animal infection models is substantially limited. [164] [165] [166] To overcome this problem, suckling or young mice, 167 AG129 mice lacking INF-a/b and INF-c receptors, 168 IFNAR \u00c0/\u00c0 mice lacking only the IFNa/b receptor, 169 or immunosuppressed mice 170 can be used as appropriate models to evaluate nucleosides in vivo. However, as these animals are defective in an immune response, this model may also underestimate the real efficacy of the test compounds. Rodentadapted flavivirus strains, such as the hamsteradapted YFV strain Jimenez, 171 mice-adapted DENV strain D2S10, 26 or ZIKV African strain Dakar 41519, 172 represent other possible options for in vivo antiviral studies; the biological properties of such viruses can be, however, considerably different compared with those of the parent human-adapted strains. 169 Another issue is related to the length of therapeutic treatment. Most tick-and mosquito-borne flaviviruses cause acute infections, in which short-time treatment duration is expected, ranging between several days to weeks. 173 This is in contrast to chronic diseases, such as HCV, HBV, and HIV infections, which require longlasting, and sometimes lifelong, treatment regimens. 72, 173 The differences between the acute and chronic diseases should be considered during preclinical development of antiflaviviral inhibitors. Thus, some compounds that show insufficient safety profiles when tested for treatment of chronic infections can be still suitable and safe for short-term therapy of acute flaviviral diseases. 72 Antiviral therapies based on chemical inhibitors of viral replication can be accompanied with a rapid emergence of drug-resistant mutants which substantially complicates the course of infection treatment, as seen in HIV, HBV, or HCV infections. 152, 153 In flaviviruses, a rapid evolution of resistance to 2 0 -C-methylated nucleoside inhibitors was observed; this resistance was associated with a signature mutation S603T (in AHVF and TBEV) 55, 62 or S604T (in ZIKV) 68 within the active site of the viral RdRp. Interestingly, the biological properties of the TBEV mutant viruses were dramatically affected, which was manifested by resistance-associated loss of viral replication efficacy in cell culture and a highly attenuated virulence phenotype in mice. This resulted in an unusually low mortality rate when mice were infected with the mutant strain. 62 As TBEV mutants resistant to 2 0 -C-methylated nucleosides are highly sensitive to 4 0 -azido substituted nucleosides, 62 a combination treatment based on two or more inhibitors could be a possible strategy in order to minimize the risks for the emergence of viral drug resistance. [174] [175] [176] Conclusions More than 200 million clinical cases caused by arthropod-borne flaviviruses, including numerous deaths, are reported worldwide annually. So many cases of infection indicate the importance for the pursuit of new small molecule-based therapeutics to combat emerging viral pathogens. Among these, inhibitors of flaviviruses represent a critical unmet medical need. In that regard, nucleoside inhibitors of flaviviral RdRps are the most attractive targets for antiviral drug design. Nucleosides with the methyl-or ethynyl-modification at the C2 0 position and their 2 0 -fluoro derivatives are the best understood antiflavivirus nucleoside analogs, many of which were initially developed for treatment of HCV infections and later reemployed to suppress replication of other non-HCV flaviviruses. Other important antiflavivirus nucleosides are represented by inhibitors of nucleoside biosynthesis, whose mode of action is predominantly based on depletion of the intracellular nucleoside pool. Nucleoside inhibitors of flaviviral MTase and NTPase/helicase, as well as some newly discovered flavivirus inhibitors, such as tritylated nucleosides, rigid amphipathic nucleosides, or N6-aryl-substituted adenosine derivatives, whose mechanisms of action are still poorly understood, can be used as initial structures or starting points for further developments of new generations of nucleoside scaffolds with improved biological parameters. Taken together, specific nucleoside analog-based antiviral therapy in combination with effective vaccination strategies could provide potent prophylactic and curative tools to treat human infections caused by flaviviruses.\n\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article."}
