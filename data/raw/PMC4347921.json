{"title": "Detection of rickettsial DNA in ticks and wild boars in Kyoto City,\nJapan", "body": "Tick surveillance: The tick surveillance was undertaken at 14 fixed points\nand in 5 wild boars in Kyoto City (Fig.\n1A) from May to September 2011, to identify tick populations and tick species in human\nhabitats in Kyoto City. We chose 14 surveillance points located on the mountainsides of the\nnorthern (A to E in Fig. 1A and Table 1), western (F to K) and eastern (L to N) parts of Kyoto City. The vegetation at\nthese locations consisted mainly of short grasses. Ticks on the plants were captured by a\nstandard flagging method [26]. Ticks were also\ncollected from 5 wild boars hunted in Yamashina-ku (O) for the harmful wildlife control.\nAdult and nymph ticks were placed in sample bottles containing wet filter paper and taken\nback to our diagnostic laboratory. They were anesthetized with chloroform. Tick larvae were\nplaced into 70% ethanol. Each tick species was determined by its morphological index [33].\n\nDetection of rickettsial DNA by PCR: A total of 201 ticks collected at 9\nlocations and from 5 wild boars in Kyoto City from June to September 2011 were selected for\nthe detection of rickettsial DNA by PCR (Table\n2). They belonged to 3 genera including 4 species: Haemaphysalis\n(H.) longicornis, H. flava,\nAmblyomma (A.) testudinarium and\nDermacentor (D.) taiwanensis (Table 2). One hundred and ninety four ticks (96.5%)\nwere identified as H. longicornis. Twenty four, 30 and 140 ticks were male,\nfemale and nymph, respectively. Of these, 21 ticks were captured from 5 wild boars. Two\nH. flava nymphs, 4 A. testudinarium nymphs and 1 adult\nD. taiwanensis female were also examined. To extract DNA from the ticks,\ncollected ticks stored in 70% ethanol were washed with distilled water. These ticks were\nplaced on slide glass and covered with 100 \u00b5l of phosphate buffered saline\n(PBS). After placing cover glasses on top, they were crushed using the head of a tooth pick.\nThe fluid was collected and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until used as a DNA template. A PCR was\nperformed using the genus-specific primer pair of RpCS877, 5\u2032-GGGGGCCTGCTCACGGCGG and\nRpCS1258, 5\u2032-ATTGCAAAAAGTACAGTGAACA for the rickettsial citrate synthase\n(gltA) gene [25]. The reaction was\ncarried out using TaKaRa Ex Taq (TAKARA BIO, Otsu, Japan) with a 20 \u00b5l\nreaction mixture containing 2 \u00b5l of template DNA, 200 \u00b5M\neach of dNTP and 1 \u00b5M each of primer. Following initial denaturation at\n95\u00b0C for 10 min, 5 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 60 sec, annealing at 53\u00b0C for 60 sec\nand extension at 72\u00b0C for 60 sec were performed. Then, 30 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for\n60 sec, annealing at 60\u00b0C for 60 sec and extension at 72\u00b0C for 60 sec were followed. The\nfinal extension was performed at 72\u00b0C for 7 min. The Rickettsia 17-kDa\ngenus-common antigen (17K antigen) gene was also amplified using the primer pair R1;\n5\u2032-TCAATTCACAACTTGCCATT-3\u2032 and R2; 5\u2032-TTTACAAAATTCTAAAAACC-3\u2032 [1]. Nested PCR was performed with a primer pair, Rj5;\n5\u2032-CGCCATTCTACGTTACTACC-3\u2032 and Rj10; 5\u2032-ATTCTAAAAACCATATACTG-3\u2032 to detect the sequence of\nR. japonica DNA using the 100 times diluted PCR products which were\namplified with primer pair of R1 and R2 as a template [9]. The reaction was carried out using TaKaRa Ex Taq with a 20 \u00b5l\nreaction mixture containing 2 \u00b5l of template DNA, 200 \u00b5M\neach of dNTP and 1 \u00b5M of each primer. After initial denaturation at 94\u00b0C\nfor 5 min, 30 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 30 sec, annealing at 57\u00b0C for 2 min and\nextension at 70\u00b0C for 2 min were carried out. The final extension was performed at 72\u00b0C for\n7 min. The PCR products were purified using the PCR purification kit (Wizard\u00ae SV\nGel and PCR and Clean-Up System; Promega, Madison, WI, U.S.A.), and the sequences of\namplified products were determined by cycle sequencing.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis: The sequences obtained were evaluated and aligned\nwith each other and those of previously characterized rickettsiae in GenBank by using BLASTn\n[4]. Multiple alignment analysis was carried out\nusing the program ClustalW [6]. Phylogenetic analysis\nwas carried out for the approximately 450 bp of partial sequence of 17K antigen gene using\nthe Genetyx 11.1 software. Phylogenetic trees were constructed by the neighbor joining\nmethod.\n\nThe results of tick surveillance are shown in Table\n1. A total of 3,198 ticks belonging to 5 species of 3 genera were collected from 12\nof the 14 sampling points in Kyoto City (Fig.\n1A). A breakdown of numbers by percentage shows that 99.2, 6.6, 0.3,\n0.2 and 0.03% of the collected ticks from the plants were H. longicornis\nNeumann [13], H. flava Neumann\n[2], A. testudinarium Koch [11], H. kitaokai Hoogstraal [8] and D. taiwanensis Sugimoto [18], respectively (Table 1). The dominant species among the ticks collected in this study were\nH. longicornis and H. flava (Fig. 1 and Table\n1). The proportions of each growth stage among these ticks were 1.9,\n11 and 87.1% for adults, nymphs and larvae, respectively (Table 1). No significant difference in sex among the collected\npopulation was observed in this survey (Table\n1). Furthermore, the populations of the species collected were not\naffected by the altitude of the surveillance points (Table 1). Sixty-eight ticks belonging to H.\nlongicornis, H. flava and A. testudinarium were\nalso collected from 5 wild boars (Table\n1).\n\nThe proportions of tick species found at each surveillance point are shown on a map of\nKyoto City (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, the tick\npopulation differed markedly according to surveillance point. In the northern mountains (A,\nB, C, D and E), almost all the ticks captured were H. longicornis (Fig. 1B). In the western mountains\n(F, G, H and I), H. longicornis and H. flava were the\ndominant species (Fig. 1B), whereas in the eastern\nmountains (L and M), A. testudinarium was the second common species after\nH. longicornis (Fig. 1B). At\nthe eastern point, N, we captured just one tick of D. taiwanensis (Fig. 1B and Table\n1).\n\nA total of 201 ticks collected at 9 points in the mountainous area in Kyoto City from July\nto September 2011 were investigated for the presence of rickettsial genes using primer pairs\nfor gltA and 17K antigen genes. Of these, 143 (71.1%) of the ticks appeared\nto be positive for rickettsial DNA amplified by at least one PCR primer pair (Table 2). Of the PCR- positive ticks, 125 (87.4%) of\nthe samples were positive with the PCR using R. japonica-specific primers\nRj5 and Rj10. Rickettsial DNA was detected in 141 (72.7%) of the H.\nlongicornis consisting of 12 males, 12 females and 117 nymphs. Of these, 1 male,\n2 females and 2 nymphs were captured from wild boars. Two A. testudinarium\nnymphs collected from point L also harbored rickettsial DNA. No rickettsial DNA was\namplified in H. flava and D. taiwanensis with the primer\npairs (RpCS877 and RpCS1258, R1 and R2, and/or Rj5 and Rj10) used in this study. Rickettsial\nDNA was detected in the 8 surveillance points A, B, C, D, E, F, G and L (Table 2 and Fig.\n1C).\n\nThe sequence analysis of selected PCR fragments using the R1 and R2 primer pair (R1/R2\nfragment) obtained from H. longicornis showed similarity to each other,\nwith 0 to 3 nucleotide sequence differences in 475 bases (99.3\u2013100% homology). The\nsimilarity of the R1/R2 fragment of A. testudinarium to that of H.\nlongicornis was 96.2% (457/475). The R1/R2 fragments were subjected to\nphylogenetic analysis to confirm the association with previously reported rickettsial\nsequences (Fig. 2). The R1/R2 fragment from H. longicornis (R17K-Ti187F) clustered\ninto the spotted fever group of rickettsia, including R. japonica,\nR. conorii and R. slovaca, whereas those from A.\ntestudinarium were divided into clusters other than SFG rickettsia.\n\nThe tick species collected in Kyoto City are known to be able to transmit various zoonotic\npathogens to humans and animals. For instance, H. longicornis is well known\nto harbor the pathogens of theileriosis [34],\nbabesiosis [7], Japanese spotted fever [14, 21, 27, 31] and many\nzoonotic viral fevers, including SFTS [20, 35]. H. flava is a possible vector of\nthe etiological agents of anaplasmosis [15] and\nJapanese spotted fever [10]. SFTS viruses [35] and ehrlichial rickettsiae [5] have been detected in A. testudinarium, and R.\njaponica, which causes Japanese spotted fever, has been detected in D.\ntaiwanensis [10].\n\nAccording to the map shown in Fig. 1B, the tick\ndistribution in Kyoto City might be classified into at least three geographical areas as\nshown in Fig. 1C and 1D: I, northern mountain\nslopes (A, B, C, D and E), II, western mountain slopes (F, G, H and I) and III, eastern\nmountain slopes (L and M). The vegetation at these points consisted mainly of short grasses.\nNo association between vegetation and the proportion of tick species was observed. Further\nstudies are needed to characterize the distribution of this tick species in the city as the\nsampling period was limited.\n\nThe present study revealed that 71.1% of ticks present near the central city of Kyoto were\nfound to be positive for rickettsial DNA by PCR. Rickettsial DNA was detected at all the 8\nsurveillance locations where H. longicornis was collected (Table 2 and Fig.\n1C). The surveillance points were located in various regions in the city.\nH. longicornis, which was the most abundant tick in this study, and of\nwhich 78% were positive for rickettsial DNA, appeared to be the dominant carrier of\nrickettsial DNA in the area surveyed. H. longicornis is well known as a\nhuman-biting tick and is considered to be a competent vector of R. japonica\nin Japan [27]. Previously, rickettsial DNA was\ndetected in various amounts in H. longicornis obtained from different areas\nin the north and south of Japan [14, 16]. The detection of R. japonica has\npreviously been reported in various areas in Japan [14, 27]. The study on the prevalence of\nrickettsia in ticks in the Ehime prefecture, where over 70 cases of Japanese spotted fever\nhave been reported during the past decade [24],\nshowed that rickettsial DNA was detected in 12.6% of ticks using the same primer pairs as\nused in this study [19]. On the other hand, 62.2% of\nthe ticks appeared to be positive for PCR using Rj5 and Rj10 as the primer set for\nR. japonica in the present study. The sequences of the detected DNA\nsegments were analyzed and found to have 98.5% similarity with R. japonica\nYH strain which was isolated from a patient with Japanese spotted fever. The phylogenic tree\nrevealed their sequences clustered with the spotted fever group rickettsiae, including\nR.rickettsii and R. conorii, the causative agent of\nRocky Mountain spotted fever and Mediterranean spotted fever, respectively. As cases of\nrickettsiosis have never been reported in the area where we studied, in spite of the high\nprevalence of rickettsiae in ticks collected, their pathogenicity is still unclear. The\nsequences of the 17K antigen gene fragment were identical to those of the rickettsia related\nspecies, LON-13, which was detected in ticks and considered to be of low pathogenicity\n[32]. It is important to study the pathogenicity of\nthese rickettsiae for accurate diagnosis. A. testudinarium is also a\npossible vector of rickettsia in this area, although further studies are needed because only\na limited number of ticks were tested in this study.\n\nThe ticks infesting wild boars were also positive for rickettsia. Unfortunately, only one\nblood sample was available from the wild boars, and rickettsial DNA was not detected in its\nblood sample (data not shown). The proportion of ticks obtained from wild boars that\nharbored rickettsial DNA (5/21, 23.8%) was less than that of ticks sampled in the plants\n(138/180, 76.7%).\n\nAlthough there are no reports of Japanese spotted fever in humans in Kyoto City, many ticks\nthat can transmit Japanese spotted fever pathogens were distributed across the whole the\ncity. Therefore, we must stay alert and pay attention to tick-borne diseases to ensure the\nsafety of the citizens of the city as well as that of visitors."}
