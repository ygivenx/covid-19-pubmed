{"title": "Abstracts of the Eleventh Conference of the Federation of Infection Societies", "body": "The last 5 years has seen an explosion in this field. New pathogens have been discovered, new diagnostic tests have been introduced, new vaccines are being trialed and antiviral drugs have been showing some success. The human metapneumovirus was initially thought to be as important as RSV but it is now thought to be not as common as RSV and that disease is milder. A recent observation indicates that HuMPV is usually only severe as part of a mixed infection. It is unusual in adults, though can cause outbreaks in the elderly. Coronavirus has hit the headlines in the form of SARS, but another example, NL63, was described this year. It is too early to tell if it is important, but it does account for a small proportion of previously undiagnosed respiratory tract infections. More information is becoming available on rhinoviruses; not only are they the commonest precipitating factor for asthma, but they are also found in exacerbations of COPD and are increasingly recognised as a significant cause of pneumonia. This includes the immunosuppressed. Influenza continually hits the headlines; South East Asia has had an epidemic of avian influenza which hopefully will not set up transmission chains in humans. Point mutation in influenza viruses have now been strongly associated with increased virulence in humans. On the diagnostic front, nucleic acid testing is becoming predominant and many laboratories expect to have stopped culturing respiratory viruses within 2-3 years. Nucleic acid testing is more rapid, significantly more sensitive and allows a greater number of pathogens to be detected than either culture or direct fluorescence. A full respiratory screen, including staff costs, is approximately 9 euros. Cidofovir is showing efficacy in adenovirus infections in the immunocompromised, although reducing immunosuppression is probably more efficacious. A new monoclonal antibody against RSV has its place. Vaccines are in trials for RSV and parainfluenza 3. Despite this geographic variation, the consistent pattern is for Escherichia coli to be the main host and for CTX-M enzymes to occur in community as well as nosocomial isolates. Most producers are from urinary infections, but some are from bacteraemias. Prior to 2000, CTX-M producers were unrecorded from the UK but, in the past 18 months, ARMRL has received over 500 referred E. coli isolates with CTX-M enzymes from over 75 UK labs. These represent only a fraction of all producers: one Trust alone has had O350 infections due to producers. Most referred isolates have CTX-M-15 b-lactamase but a few have CTX-M-9 or other types. About 33% belong to one major strain (designated A) and a further 33% to four other strains, with all these five being of serotype 025 and maybe having a common ancestor; the remaining producers are clonally diverse. About 25% of producers are from GP patients, many of them elderly, with underlying disease and recent hospital contact. All are multi-resistant, with consistent susceptibility only to carbapenems, nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin; strain A is also susceptible to gentamicin. The spread of CTX-M enzymes has forced re-thinking of ESBL detection methods. Ceftazidime resistance -previously advocated a single indicator of likely ESBL producers-is inconsistent among CTX-M producers and it is additionally necessary to test cefotaxime. Alternatively, isolates may be screened for cefpodoxime resistance. Isolates resistant to any of these cephalosporins should then have confirmatory tests performed, seeking synergy between the indicator cephalosporin and clavulanic acid. The spread of CTX-M enzymes into community E. coli means that isolates from GP samples also need screening by these methods, not just nosocomial isolates.\n\nThe diagnosis and management of tuberculous meningitis challenges physicians worldwide. It is the severest form of infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, causing death or severe neurological deficit in more than half affected despite treatment with anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy; but diagnostic methods have improved little since Robert Koch first stained the bacilli in 1882 and treatment has not advanced since the introduction of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to anti-tuberculosis drugs and the impact of co-infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Although older methods of diagnosis and treatment still have an important role to play in meeting these challenges, novel solutions are urgently required. Early diagnosis and treatment has the greatest impact on outcome from tuberculous meningitis but the best diagnostic method remains uncertain. The role of clinical diagnostic algorithms, 1 conventional bacteriology, 2 and molecular techniques 3 will be discussed, as will the impact of HIV infection and mycobacterial drug resistance on the performance of these methods (unpublished data). Adjunctive corticosteroids have long been suggested for the treatment of tuberculous meningitis but evidence they improve outcome has been difficult to obtain and there are no data from HIV infected individuals. We recently conducted a double blind, placebo controlled trial to determine whether adjunctive dexamathasone improves outcome in adults with tuberculous meningitis, with or without HIV infection. 4 The results suggest dexamethasone improves survival from tuberculous meningitis but does not prevent severe disability. The influence of HIV infection and mycobacterial drug resistance on clinical presentation, response to treatment, and outcome will be examined. How dexamethasone improves survival is unclear and data will be presented from parallel studies that assessed serial cerebrospinal fluid and peripheral blood inflammatory response in adults with tuberculous meningitis randomised to dexamethasone or placebo.\n\nIn conclusion, mycobacterial drug resistance and HIV infection have set new challenges in the diagnosis and management of tuberculous meningitis but many of the available solutions are old. Prompt diagnosis and treatment remains the greatest influence physicians can have on the outcome of this disease and still depends on the application of simple and widely available clinical and laboratory techniques. There is now compelling evidence that adjunctive dexamethasone improves survival from tuberculous meningitis and should be given to all adults regardless of disease severity. The best treatment of HIV associated, and drug resistant tuberculous meningitis remains uncertain and studies that assess the impact and optimal timing of second-line anti-tuberculosis drugs and anti-retroviral treatment are urgently required. The index patient, who had been receiving haemodialysis at RPH as an outpatient, was isolated with strict contact precautions. Screening of patients in the Dialysis Unit, Nephrology Ward & ICU approximately weekly over the next month revealed more and more carriers. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and plasmid analysis of the isolates demonstrated a single-strain. Despite the isolation of carriers, the VREF spread rapidly. By late September the epidemic strain had spread to 22 wards and one outpatient unit (Satellite Dialysis). 4 patients were infected and 64 were colonized. A Hospital VRE Executive Group, which included the Chief Executive and Directors of Clinical Services and Nursing, was formed to manage the outbreak directly with daily meetings. Control was handicapped by the slowness of conventional laboratory methods which took 4-5 days to identify VRE and allowed nosocomial transmission to occur before carriers were identified. A laboratory procedure to make rapid provisional identification of VRE was developed. Each rectal swab was incubated in selective enrichment broth for at least 24 h. Multiplex PCR for the vanA & vanB genes was performed directly on positive broth cultures, using novel hybridization probes which were developed to improve the specificity & sensitivity of the assay. On average 4 rectal swabs, each collected on separate days, were needed to detect O90% of the 172 VREF carriers who were epidemiologically linked to the outbreak. Enhanced infection e3 control practices were used to eradicate the single-strain outbreak:\n\n1. Cohorting of all positive & ward contact patients in separate wards with dedicated nursing staff for each cohort. 2. All inpatients (ward contacts & no known exposure) were screened during a 1-week period to identify the total reservoir of VREF carriage. 39 previously unknown carriers were found. 3. Establishment of a dedicated VRE ward cleaning service for the duration of the outbreak. 4. Environmental cultures to establish that terminal cleaning was adequate. 5. Electronic flagging of medical records of ward contacts. During the 6-month period, July-December 2001, 118 patient carriers were detected by screening in hospital. The electronic flagging of ward contacts enabled those who had not been screened at least 4 times before discharge to be followed-up and screened. From 28 September 2001 to 30 April 2002, a total of 1,977 ward contacts were screened after discharge from hospital and 54(2.73%) were found to be carrying VREF. The electronic labelling and active follow-up of ward contacts resulted in a significant number of carriers being detected who otherwise posed a risk of initiating further outbreaks in hospital if they were readmitted. Ongoing control has been facilitated by targeted active surveillance cultures:\n\n\u2020 on admission to high-risk units (ICU, Burns, Nephrology, Haematology, Bone Marrow Transplant Unit) \u2020 on transfer out of ICU \u2020 monthly screening of patients regularly attending displays units \u2020 opportunistic laboratory screening of inpatient faecal specimens submitted for Clostridium difficile culture Listeria monocytogenes is a foodborne pathogen responsible for listeriosis, a human infection with an overall 30% mortality rate, characterized by severe gastroenteritis, fetoplacental and central nervous system infections. This microorganism has the ability to cross three tight barriers in humans, the intestinal, the blood-brain and the fetoplacental barriers. During infection, it enters, survives and multiplies in phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells. It also spreads directly from cell to cell. These features are considered central for listeriosis pathophysiology. The infectious process has been extensively studied in tissue-cultured cells. The series of events that occur after the initial bacterial cell contact include formation of a phagocytic vacuole, lysis of this vacuole within 30 min, intracytosolic replication, actin-based intracellular movement, and cell-to-cell spreading. L. monocytogenes entry into human epithelial cells is triggered by the interaction of a bacterial surface protein called internalin, with its host receptor, E-cadherin, a transmembrarne protein critical for the formation and maintenance of adherent junctions in epithelial tissues. Internalin-E-cadherin interaction is speciesspecific and mouse E-cadherin, in contrast to human E-cadherin, is not a receptor for internalin. This species-specificity relies on the nature of E-cadherin 16th amino acid, which is a proline in humans and a glutamic acid in mice: replacement of this glutamic acid into a proline leads to a gain of function, establishing the critical role of this residue in E-cadherininternalin interaction. Transgenic mice expressing human E-cadherin, in contrast to non-transgenic mice, are highly permissive to orally acquired listeriosis, demonstrating an essential role for internalin in L. monocytogenes ability to cross the intestinal barrier. An epidemiological survey indicated that all L. monocytogenes strains isolated from pregnancy-related cases expressed a fulllength and functional internalin, as compared to only 65% of strains isolated from food products, a result in favor of a critical role for internalin in the targeting and crossing of the human maternofetal barrier. Examination of iminumohistochemically labeled placental and amniotic tissue samples obtained from women with pregnancy-associated listeriosis raised the possibility that L. monocytogenes crosses the maternofetal barrier through the villous syncytiotrophoblast. Investigation of the cellular patterns of expression of its receptor E-cadherin at the maternofetal interface demonstrated that E-cadherin is expressed on the basal and apical plasma membranes of syncytiotrophoblasts. Quantitative assays of cellular invasion in trophoblastic cell lines, primary trophoblast cultures, and placental villous explants demonstrated that bacterial entry into syncytiotrophoblasts occurs via the apical membrane in an internalin-E-cadherin dependent thermal. In human placental villous explants, -bacterial invasion of the syncytiotrophoblast barrier and underlying villous tissue and subsequent replication produces histopathological lesions that mimic those seen in placentas of women with listeriosis. Thus, the internalin-Ecadherin interaction that plays a key role in the crossing of the intestinal barrier is also exploited by L. monocytogenes to target and cross the human placental barrier. Current studies focus on the molecular mechanisms of L. monocytogenes crossing of the blood-brain barrier.\n\nT. Walsh Department of Pathology and Microbiology, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK Over the millennia, bacteria have adjusted to external stimuli. This adjustment employs several mechanisms to protect the cell from harmful toxins and ultimately eluding certain death. These mechanisms can be expressed either constitutively or only when the cell requires it-termed \"inducible\". The cell can procure either of these mechanisms either by rearranging its own DNA (termed \"intrinsic\") or by sequestering foreign DNA (termed \"acquired\"). The latter is perceived as more of a clinical threat as the organism usually expresses this mechanism constitutively and predicting which organism this new mechanism will appear in can be problematic.\n\nIn the 21st century, resistance must be seen as a global problem. Increased international mobility of human populations, increased resistance in the community and bacteria possessing remarkably plastic genetic elements have all contributed to the current antibiotic resistant rates seen in UK and European hospitals. Bacterial pathogens have acquired several mechanisms in which to acquire new DNA: conjugation, transformation and transduction. Concurrent with some of these, bacteria can also acquire new antibiotic resistant genes by highly mobile gene cassettes that are embedded in ambulatory genetic elements called \"integrons\". The integrons can themselves be embedded in transposons or associated with other mobile DNA regions called \"common region\" elements. Recently, it has been postulated that \"pathogenicity islands\" also contribute to gene transfer. Using Gram-negative quinolone resistance and extendedspectrum b-lactamases as examples, the aforementioned mechanisms of gene transfer will be explored as will their contribution to clinical antibiotic resistance.\n\nG. Smith Regional Centre for Mycobacteriology, West Midlands Public Health Laboratory, Health Protection Agency. Birmingham Heartlands Hospital, Bordesley Green East, UK\n\nThe recently published Action Plan from the Chief Medical Officer, Stopping Tuberculosis in England, sets out the steps which government, the health services and local communities need to take to reverse the rise in TB. The plan includes the development and implementation of protocols for the public health use of laboratory techniques such as DNA fingerprinting of all Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates, and the establishment of a central database linking fingerprinting and epidemiological data. A central system that enables early defection of outbreaks and rapidly eliminates cases from an outbreak cohort will facilitate appropriate focusing of contact tracing efforts and thus limit the spread of infection. Application of molecular microbiological methods has improved the understanding of population structures and dynamic spread of a number of infectious agents. Some methods also allow genetic comparison of strains, facilitating the identification of the genetic basis of medically relevant microbiological traits. M. tuberculosis is an example of a bacterial species for which several well-standardized, powerful methods of epidemiologic characterization have been developed. Some countries haw carried out longitudinal epidemiologic surveillance, allowing databases to be exchanged and compared. The techniques used most widely are IS 6110 Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) and Spoligotyping and have been used successfully to investigate strains from patients with epidemiological lift and to provide information on the population genetics of M. tuberculosis locally and globally. Neither of these techniques is ideal for rapid, high volume, discriminatory analysis of recently isolated strains of M. tuberculosis, nor do they allow direct application of typing information to inform investigation and contact tracing of new cases. These characteristics are required to allow unsuspected clusters to be identified and the extent of clusters to be mapped, with the prospect of improving disease control and prevention. Rapid typing, made available during case management and treatment, will also improve the opportunities to recognise microbiological and clinical traits associated with particular typing profiles. The Health Protection Agency has developed a National Typing Strategy for TB, and has selected the method Variable Number Tandem Repeat typing. Using 5 Exact Tandem Repeat (ETR) loci and 12 Mycobacterial Interspersed Repetitive Unit (MIRU) loci to produce a 17 digit profile for each strain, a prospective typing service has been implemented across the Midlands from July 2003. Typing results have been reported directly to TB nurses, health protection teams and local laboratories. Typing information has focused contact tracing, and has assisted with infection control and in the management of difficult patients. TB teams have swiftly realised the benefits of the typing strategy, and have been able to limit or cancel extensive contact tracing exercises when typing has distinguished apparently clustered strains The typing service is rolling out from Regional Centres for Mycobacteriology to the rest of England, and a national database is underdevelopment. It is anticipated that wider availability of the service will enhance the contribution to TB prevention and control. This vaccine has proved to be highly effective across age groups and also to induce herd immunity protecting the population at large. Efforts on developing vaccines that are comprehensive against all meningococci have concentrated on the sub capsular antigens, particularly the porin proteins. These proteins are, however, highly variable and such sub capsular antigens tend to be specific to the particular strain against which they are produced. However, molecular epidemiological studies are beginning to reveal a high degree of structuring in the antigenic variability. This structure provides clues to possible ways forwards in the development of a comprehensive meningococcal vaccine. Outbreak investigations are an important and challenging component of public health. They serve to identify the source or means of spread of the disease and can, it action is taken promptly, prevent additional cases. Even when an outbreak is over, thorough investigation can provide information that will help prevent future outbreaks. A variety of circumstances can pose difficulties in outbreak investigation. Some have to do with the disease itself such as ease of diagnosis and treatment, severity of symptoms, and degree of infectivity. Others have to do with the setting. Infections may be difficult both to investigate and control if they are widely spread or in remote areas. Infections in closed communities like hospitals, nursing homes, cruise ships, military facilities, or prisons pose specific problems. More recently, the prospect of bioterrorism has added a new dimension to any investigation of an unusual incident. Most difficult of all are incidents that face vested economic or political interests, or which occur in unstable political contexts such as during war or humanitarian crisis. We could characterise the epidemiologist's nightmare as:\n\n\u2020 a new disease \u2020 whose aetiology and mode of transmission is unknown \u2020 which has a substantial fatality rate \u2020 but no diagnostic test, treatment or vaccine \u2020 which has already spread rapidly in the population \u2020 and is generating public panic, media interest, and political repercussions. Just a little bit like SARS in fact . The response should always be to follow the basic principles of good outbreak investigation. The first stage is to verify the facts, to confirm the existence of an outbreak and to develop a case definition. The second stage is to gather as much information as possible about the incident including searching for undiagnosed cases, interviewing cases and analysing data by time, place and person, as well as incorporating information obtained from microbiological and environmental investigations. It is important to be clear about the purpose of the investigation, to focus on generating hypotheses about the cause of the outbreak, and to keep an open mind during these early stages. The third stage is to test hypotheses by carrying out a cohort or case-control study, to seek to draw firm conclusions from all the information gathered and to take action accordingly. At all stages it is important to keep a log of events and key decisions, to coordinate the response through an incident team, to ensure good communication with colleagues, public, press and others, and to implement control measures as promptly as possible. Finally, a report should be written that crystallises the findings of the investigation, makes appropriate recommendations, and highlights lessons learned.\n\nA link between visible cleanliness and healthcare acquired infection has been firmly established, both politically and in the mind of the press and public, although the scientific evidence is more contentious (e.g. \"A Matron's Charter: An Action Plan for Cleaner Hospitals\"). To What extent could/should Infection Control Practitioners, and others, be setting standards for environmental cleanliness? Recolonisation of the large intestine with \"normal\" flora is an attractive therapeutic intervention in the treatment of clostridium difficile associated diarrhoea (CDAD) as it breaks the cycle of recurrent antibiotic administration. Recently the use of donor stool administered via a naso-gastric tube has been described as a treatment for recurrent CDAD. We describe our experiences in using this technique in six patients with recurrent CDAD. All patients presenting to the Brownlee Centre over a 1 year period (August 2003-August 2004) with recurrent CDAD were offered treatment with faecal transplant. Recurrent CDAD was defined as recurrence of diarrhoea, in the presence of C. difficile toxin assay positivity. This assumed initial resolution of symptoms following an appropriate course of anti clostridial treatment. Six patients had stool transplant with faeces donated by screened relatives. Of the six patients treated, three had cure of their CDAD at follow up (41 to 12 weeks). One patient remains symptom free and awaits stool toxin assay at 3 month follow up. One patient remained C. difficile toxin positive and continued with diarrhoea following transplant. This patient did however respond to a further course of metronidazole and remained symptom free and C. difficile toxin negative at 3 months follow up. The final patient initially responded to stool transplant (no diarrhoea and toxin negative). However, she had a further episode of CDAD when subsequently treated with a course of broad spectrum antibiotics. In the cases of two patients, the relative initially screened was found to be positive for C. difficile toxin and other donors had to be identified. Stool transplant is an effective therapy for recurrent COAD. It is inexpensive and in our experience, not associated with any adverse effects. Patient acceptance of this treatment option was universally high despite the obvious aesthetic problems. Screening of stool donors is the most time consuming part of treatment. The identification of asymptomatic relatives with stool carriage of C. difficile is a recognised finding and underlines the need for appropriate screening of potential stool donors. RESULTS: Typing of the clinical isolates showed them to be indistinguishable from each other, and different from other isolates obtained from the same hospital. Observation of surgical practice revealed nothing untoward, and there appeared to be no significant difference between the modes of operation of the different surgical teams. Environmental screening yielded several Enterobacter isolates, but these proved to be different from the clinical isolates, except one isolate from cardiac bypass cooling water, However, this water was contained in a sealed system, and the machine was used by all surgical teams, and some of the cases had not been exposed to this particular bypass machine. Further questioning revealed one significant difference between the different surgical teams-the team with the infected patients used semi-frozen sterile Hartmann's solution to achieve cardioplegia. This ice-slush is instilled directly into the chest cavity during surgery. The freezer used for this was swabbed, and all swabs (including swabs from the outside of the Hartmann's bags) yielded Enterobacter cloacae, indistinguishable from the clinical isolates. CONCLUSIONS: The most plausible explanation is that the freezer was recently contaminated by Enterobacter, and the bacteria then contaminated the ice-slush solution while it was being decanted, thus infecting the patients. There have been no more cases since the freezer was replaced, a rigorous cleaning schedule instituted, and steps taken to reduce the possibility of carry-over of any contaminating organisms. The Streptococcus pneumoniae surface protein A (PspA) and cytotoxin pneumolysin (Ply) may affect virulence by preventing complement activity. We studied the interaction of these proteins and the complement system using mice with specific deficiencies in complement components and mutant strains of bacteria deficient in PspA and/or Ply. C3 deposition on S. pneumoniae strains was investigated by flow cytometry Compared to the wild-type strain, C3 deposition on the ply strain was increased in serum from wild type (WT) mice but not in C1q K/K serum, indicating that Ply prevents classical pathway activity. In contrast, C3 deposition was increased on the pspA K mutant strain in C1q K/K serum suggesting that PspA interferes with the alternative pathway. Loss of pspA and ply was strongly synergistic, with a large increase in C3 deposition on the pspA K /ply K mutant strain in WT serum. We also analysed using mixed infections and wild-type or complement deficient mice whether PspA, and Ply prevent complement activity in vivo.\n\nBoth pspA K and ply K strains were attenuated in virulence compared to the wild-type strain in WT mice, the pspA K strain to a greater degree (CIZ0.025) than the ply K strain (CIZ0.21). In mice deficient of all complement activity (C3 K/K ), the relative virulence to D39 of both the pspA K and ply K strains improved (CI 0.15 and 0.60 respectively), demonstrating that loss of virulence in these mutant strains is at least partially dependent on complement activity. When compared to the ply K strain the virulence of the double pspA K ply K mutant strain in WT mice was dramatically reduced (CI 0.005), but restored in C3 K/K mice (CI 1.08), confirming the synergistic protective effect of Ply and PspA against complement activity in vivo. The site and timing of complement-mediated immunity during pneumonia was analysed using mixed infections comparing the pspA K ply K strain to the ply K strain in WT and C3 K/K mice. Although there was some role for complement-dependent immunity at early time points within the lung, the major effect of complement was to prevent spread of S. pneumoniae from the lungs to the blood. Preventing the inhibition of complement-dependent immunity by S. pneumoniae or other primary bacterial pathogens could be a potential novel therapy for patients with septicaemia. . Maximal cation transport occurs at pH 5.5-6.0, consistent with the proton gradient based energetics proposed for other NRAMP orthologues. Mn 2C transport is diminished in the presence of 140 mM Na C , compatible with a Na C slippage mechanism proposed for the Saccharomyces cerevisiae NRAMP orthologue, Smf1p. CONCLUSIONS: CRAMP is the first NRAMP orthologue from a fungal pathogen to be functionally characterised. CRAMP resembles other fungal orthologues with respect to predicted membrane topology, substrate specificity and pH dependence 3 but differs in terms of its apparent affinity Mn 2C and insensitivity to Zn 2C . Insights afforded by these findings will allow the formulation of new hypotheses regarding the role of metal ions in the pathophysiology of cryptococcosis.\n\nThe devastating systemic effects of bacterial superantigens (SAGs) may be explained by powerful proinflammatory synergy with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). However, the mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear and has never been investigated in humans. Specifically, there is no known link between SAG-induced immune effects and the pattern-recognition of LPS at toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). AIMS: To investigate whether SAGs affect expression of the LPS receptor TLR4 in monocytes; to determine the phenotype of SAG-exposed mononuclear cells with regard to LPS responsiveness; to determine whether T cell signalling or MHC class II signalling play any role in SAG-mediated interaction with the LPS recognition pathway. METHODS: TLR4 expression on primary monocytes was determined by flow cytometry and real time PCR. TNF produced by mononuclear cells was determined by ELISA. The role of T cells was investigated by cell separation techniques and by use of SAG constructs with targeted mutations in the MHC class II and T cell receptor binding domains. RESULTS: Staphylococcal and streptococcal SAGs induced rapid transcription and increased membrane expression of TLR4 in primary human monocytes by ligation of MHC class II. SAGs were solely responsible for monocyte TLR4 up-regulation induced by products from Streptococcus pyogenes. In parallel with enhanced TLR4 expression, priming of purified monocytes or mixed peripheral blood monounuclear cells with SAGs significantly enhanced the induction of proinflammatory cytokines by known TLR4 ligands. SAG constructs containing targeted mutations were used to demonstrate a requirement for MHC class II ligation in both TLR4 up-regulation and enhanced responses to endotoxin. In contrast to results from animal models, SAG-endotoxin interaction was not dependent on T cell receptor ligation of exotoxin or interferon gamma production. SUMMARY: Pattern-recognition of bacterial SAGs by MHC class II receptors may exacerbate the proinflammatory response of monocytes to Gram-negative infection or endotoxin by upragulation of TLR4. . Similarly, flow cytometry revealed a reduction in alveolar macrophage apoptosis. The incidence of bacteraemia at 12 h was greater in the iNOS deficient mice than wild type (86% iNOS K/K vs. 29% C57BI6) but was similar between the two strains at 24 h (75% iNOS K/K vs. 83% C57BI6). Clearance of bacteria was similar in the two strains at both time points. There was a significantly greater number of PMN in BALF 24 h after infection in iNOS K/K than C57BI6 (1.0!10 6 G5.3!10 5 vs. 2.0!10 5 G1.4! 10 5 , p!0.01). There was no difference in PMN in BALF in mock infected mice between the two strains. At 10 days there was no difference in survival, however, survival before 48 h was 75% in iNOS K/K and 96% in the C57BI6 mice. CONCLUSION: iNOS deficiency was associated with a reduction in apoptosis, earlier bacteraemia and earlier death. There was greater recruitment of PMN in the iNOS K/K mice which resulted in similar bacterial clearance from the lung and no significant difference in long term survival between the two strains but at the expense of greater lung inflammation. Here we investigate the CCR expression on monocytes from RSV-infected infants and healthy controls. PATIENTS: 34 infants, (26 admitted to intensive-care; age 120G 128 days; 73.1% male), with confirmed RSV infection, were admitted to the study. 15 infants (age 218G146 days; 61.5% male) undergoing elective surgery were recruited as uninfected controls. A questionnaire including details of RSV risk factors and the course and duration of disease was completed for each patient. METHODS: w1 ml of blood was taken from each patient. Monocytes were isolated from this tiny amount of fresh blood using a novel density gradient and adherence method. Half the cells were infected with RSV and half treated with negative control, UV-light inactivated RSV (LN-RSV). CCIR-1 and 5 levels were determined using FACS analysis. Calcium flux measurement was by Fluo-3/Fura-Red ratio assay. Statistical tests, Wilcoxin, Mann-Whitney-U and Spearmans-rho where performed using SPSS software. RESULTS: iMonocytes from RSV-patients, stimulated ex vivo with virus, have significantly higher CCR1 levels than RSV stimulated monocytes from control patients (p!0.05). Monocytes from both control and RSV-patients up-regulate CCR1 in response to RSV when compared to UV-RSV negative control, (p!0.05 and p! 0.001), but the increase is greater in monocytes from RSVpatients. Therefore monocytes from RSV-infected babies appear primed to up-regulate CCR1 in response to RSV. CCR1 and CCR5 expression are co-regulated as CCR1 and 5 expression levels were correlated (r 2 Z0.7, p!0.01). Calcium flux measurements show the up-regulated receptors to be functional. The CCR1 fold increase correlated significantly with key markers of disease severity; duration of hospital admission (pZ0.046) and duration of intensive care stay (pZ0.026). CONCLUSIONS: These data show that RSV causes a functional increase in chemokine receptor expression and that this upregulation is linked to disease severity in infants. patients in the study had 362 sexual contacts (59 regular and 303 casual contacts). Only 67 (18.5%) of the total contacts could be traced of which 44 (12.2%) were screened. The remaining 295 (81.5%) could not be identified for partner notification despite intensive tracking attempts. CONCLUSION: This study illustrates lack of patient compliance with post-treatment serological follow up. Simplification of follow up may improve patient compliance with post-treatment serology. The low success rate of partner notification is mainly due to anonymous sex, which may be further driving the syphilis epidemic and attempts to improve this nationally should be sought. INTRODUCTION: Immune Restoration Diseases (IRD) are a collection of inflammatory diseases seen in HIV patients after HIV viraemia is suppressed by highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). IRD probably reflect dysregulated immune responses against pro-existing infections by opportunistic pathogens. It is postulated that patients with profoundly supposed CD4 lymphocyte counts are most susceptible to IRD. METHODS: The Royal Perth hospital has a cohort of approximately 450 HIV-positive patients. A retrospective case note study was performed examining patients with CD4 counts of 50 cells/mm 3 or less who had commenced HAART. A total of 98 pts from June 1996 to June 2003 were identified. Patients were excluded if less than 6 months therapy had been completed or if they had been lost to follow up, if poor compliance/adherence with HAART had been identified, or it there had been no significant reduction in HIV viral load (O1 log from baseline viral load) following 6 months of treatment. A total of 64 patients fulfilled the criteria. As some had been commenced on HAART more than once during the study period, more than one episode could be studied for each patient. A total of 75 such episodes were analysed. Patients clinic and ward attendances were examined and the occurrences of possible cases of IRD were noted. RESULTS: Patients mean age at commencement of HAART was 43.4 years (24-66 yrs). Sex: male 80%, female 20%. Ethnicity: Caucasian 76.6%, SE Asian 10.9%, African 6.25%, Indigenous Australian 6.25%. HAART regime used: protease inhibitor based 67%, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor based 23%, other 11%. Mean baseline CD4 count 22 cells/mm 3 (0-49). Mean baseline HIV viral load 354.089 copies/ml (911-2,109,967). A total of 21 cases of IRD were diagnosed (atypical mycobacterial infection 5, Kaposis sarcoma 3, VZV 3, cerebral taxoplasmosis 2, tuberculosis 1, cylomegalovirus 1, anterior uveitis 1, cryptococcosis 1, molluscum contagiosum 1, progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy 1, disseminated HSV 1, parvovirus encephalitis 1). 8 further possible cases also occurred, as did elevations of transaminases in 5 chronic hepatitis patients (41 hepatitis C, 1 hepatitis B). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a CD4 count of !50 cells/mm 3 may be more at risk of developing IRD. We compare our data with other studies and comment on management of individual cases. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effector function of M. tuberculosis purified protein derivative (PPD)-specific CD4 C T cells in HIV-1seropositive (HIV-1 C ) subjects after long term highly-active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). METHODS: PPD-specific CD4 C T cells were quantified by IFN-g Elispot in a cross-sectional study of 20 HIV-1 C subjects receiving HAART for O12 months, with CD4 counts O300 cells/ml, and 11 age-matched low risk controls. All subjects were BCG-vaccinated. Cytokine profiles of responding T cells were analysed by intracellular staining. RESULTS: The frequency of IFN-g-secreting PPD-specific CD4 C T cells was significantly lower in HIV-1 C subjects compared with controls (medians 35 and 682 SFU/million PBMC respectively, p! 0.001), irrespective of CD4 nadir or duration of HAART. In contrast, high frequencies of CMV-specific CD4 C T cells with IFNg-secreting capacity were detected in CMV-seropositive HIV-1 C subjects. There was no evidence of a switch to a Th2 response as frequencies of PPD-specific CD4 C T cells with secreting IFN-g or IL-4 were similar among HIV-1 C subjects. PPD-specific proliferative responses were demonstrated in a subset of HIV-1 C subjects (nZ10) and exagenous IL-12 could restore IFN-g secretion in response to PPD stimulation, indicating that PPDspecific GD4 C T cells were present in these individuals. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these data indicate a selective loss of function in PPD-specific CD4 C T cells in HIV-1 C subjects, due to a defect in the IL-12/ IFN-g axis which does not appear to have been recovered after long term HAART. As IFN-g is a key mediator of immunity to M. tuberculosis, our findings have implications for the risk of active tuberculosis (TB) in HAART-treated subjects, particularly in areas with a high TB prevalence where HAART is yet to be implemented on a large scale. METHODS: In order to plan and progress a Tuberculosis Control Plan within a hospital setting for the management of suspected/ actual cases of tuberculosis, key staff including modern matrons were asked to produce a patient care pathway for their ward or department. They were asked to include information on the roles and responsibilities of key personnel. Respondents were also asked whom they would inform, to provide information on patient accommodation, the provision of advice to patients and for details of personal protective equipment. RESULTS: A wide range of responses was received, which were drawn up in a variety of ways either by individuals acting in isolation or as part of a group exercise. The most comprehensive pathway of care was received form the care of the elderly directorate which included action to be taken in the community as well as within hospital setting; reflecting the way in which healthcare delivery is organised. One respondent indicated that they did need to have a protocol as they only screened \"well women\"; this despite the fact that multidrug resistant tuberculosis has been identified in patients visiting the department. CONCLUSIONS: More work needs to be done to improve staff knowledge with regard to risk assessment as well as in the management of suspected/known cases of tuberculosis particularly with regard to the use of personal protective equipment. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a major human pathogen both in the community and healthcare settings, causing infections ranging from boils and cellulitis to lifethreatening disease such as osteomyelitis and bacteraemia. The epidemic spread of MRSA is due mainly to the dissemination of strains with enhanced capability for dispersion and transmissibility. Effective control measures depend on a detailed knowledge of strain characteristics and have the potential to inform epidemiological studies and impact on infection control strategies. In the last two decades, 17 UK epidemic methicillin-resistant S. aureus (EMRSA) types have been defined by phage typing. Although phage typing and, more recently, PFGE have been widely used studying the epidemiology of MRSA, their interlaboratory reproducibility is limited, which hampers strain comparisons between centres and countries. The advent of newer, more portable molecular typing methods offer the promise of overcoming these limitations. To enhance the characterisation of the 17 reference strains, we have exploited a range of molecular techniques including DNA sequence and PCR-based methods: Multi Locus Sequence Typing (MLST), protein A gene (spa) sequence typing, toxin profiting, accessory gene regulator (agr) allele determination and staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) typing. The data show variable discriminatory power for the EMRSA strains in terms of their sequence (ST), spa type, agr group and SCC mec types, which provide valuable insights into their phylogenetic and evolutionary relationships. For example, EMRSA-1, 4, 7 and 11 were all ST 239, spa type t037, agr 1 and SCCmec III. They also encode a single enterotoxin, sea. These results show that these EMRSAs were derived from a similar genetic background. However, the most successful UK epidemic strains, EMRSA K1, 3, 15 and 16 have MLST, spa type, agr group and SCCmec types which differ from each other, showing they are from distinct genetic lineages. This suggests that other factors are important in their pathogenicity and epidemicity. The discriminatory power afforded by these techniques will augment outbreak investigations and improve our ability to map the emergence and spread of resistant and/or virulent clones in both community and healthcare settings. INTRODUCTION: Cranberry juice has been given to elderly hospitalised patients in the belief that it will prevent, or treat, urinary tract infection (UTI) 1 . Though there is good evidence of its effect in decreasing symptomatic UTIs in younger women, whether it is effective for elderly women and men is unknown. The mechanism by which the effect of cranberry is mediated is thought to be due to the presence of \"proanthocyanidins\", which exhibit antiadhesion activity against both sensitive and resistant strains of P-fimbriated E. coli, preventing adherence to uroepithelial cells lining the wall of the bladder 2 . Cranberry juice is an attractive therapy as it is cheap, natural and will not lead to antibiotic resistance. In this study we sought to examine its potential in preventing symptomatic UTI in elderly hospitalised patients who are at risk from adverse effects of multiple courses of antibiotics. ABSTRACT: This was a randomised, placebo controlled, double blind trial of 376 patients aged 60 or over admitted to the Medicine for the Elderly assessment or rehabilitation units in Tayside. Participants were given either 15 Dml of cranberry juice or placebo twice daily; the juice was prescribed in the ward drug kardex. The primary outcome was time to onset of first UTI. Secondary outcomes were compliance with drinking juice, antibiotic prescriptions and bacteria isolated from UTIs. A high adherence fate to drinking the juice (around 90%) was achieved. A total A 21 (5.6%) subjects developed UTI: 14/189 in the placebo group and 7/187 in the cranberry juice group. There were significantly fewer Escherichia coli infections in the cranberry group. This is a large randomised clinical trial of cranberry juice ingestion that included males and females, but as the symptomatic infection rate was lower than anticipated the study was underpowered and thus inconclusive. Larger trials are needed to provide a definitive result; meanwhile the role of cranberry juice in the prevention of UTI in elderly hospital patients remains unproven. During June 2004, GAS was isolated from clinical sites from three different patients. A post-partum mother (case A), her baby (case a) and one other baby (case b). Two further women (case C and D) returned to the unit with serious infection, both required admission to the intensive care unit. The maternity unit was closed so that an investigation could be undertaken and appropriate infection control measures implemented to prevent further cases. An outbreak group was established including internal and external representatives. Regular meetings of this group were held during the course of the outbreak. The unit was closed to new admissions, with exception of women who presented in advanced labour or as obstetric emergency.\n\nThe priority was to re-open the unit as soon as possible to relieve the pressure of referrals on neighbouring units. There was communication to all General Practitioners in the catchment area seeking their co-operation of identification of further cases.\n\nNo new cases were identified from the community. Three hundred staff were screened within a 7 day period, no positive isolates were found. A deep clean of the environment and patient shared equipment was co-ordinated by the infection control team. Items of equipment that were potential reservoirs of infection were systematically audited. 68 items of equipment, including several cot mattresses and delivery bed mattresses, were condemned and replaced. Typing of isolates from case A, case a, and case b were found to be the same type by the reference laboratory. Evidence suggests that there had been transmission from case A to case a and to case b. Case C was assessed on the delivery suite within 3 h of the delivery of case a and case b. Case C was microbiologically negative but there was strong circumstantial and clinical evidence that cross infection occurred. Case D was excluded from the outbreak.\n\nThe following recommendations were made by the outbreak group after the look-back exercise: \u2020 Patient shared equipment to be subject to a planned programme of audit and replacement. \u2020 To undertake review of local polices pertinent to infection control. \u2020 Clinical staff to attend mandatory infection control training. \u2020 To review domestic hours input to unit. Prevention and control of hospital acquired infection is now given a high priority with increased attention focussed on the maintenance of a clean hospital environment. The ward curtains surrounding hospital beds give the patient privacy, but like other surfaces in the ward environment, are exposed to contamination with hospital microbial pathogens derived from patients and staff. Consequently curtains may play a role in the spread nosocomial infections and their importance has probably been overlooked in the past. At the Taunton & Somerset NHS Trust curtains are laundered off site and are often in short supply when there is a sudden increased demand. To overcome these limitations rapid curtain decontamination in situ using the Robby 6000 steam cleaner has been introduced. This study was undertaken as there is little information available on the effectiveness of steam cleaning curtains. A 2 m 2 area of curtain was sampled using a Casella slit sampler according to a standard protocol. The areas chosen were those identified as most likely to be contaminated by patients and staff. The bacterial load on 13 laundered curtains in the linen room and 20 curtains in clinical areas before and after steam cleaning was investigated. Total colony counts (cfu) were recorded arid the data sets analysed statistically using Minitab student-12. Steam cleaning of curtains from clinical areas resulted in a significant reduction in colony counts (P!0.0001).\n\nAfter steam cleaning the bacterial loads on curtains from clinical areas were comparable with those on stored, clean laundered curtains.\n\nQualitative studies were carried out to identify the various species of organisms present on laundered curtains and curtains in clinical areas, including those surrounding the beds of patients known to be MRSA positive. Isoelectric focusing confirmed the presence of an inducible blactamase with a high pl, consistent with the presence of an AmpC blactamase. Both molecular typing methods revealed that two clones were present. The first, which caused invasive clinical infection in 4 babies, was afterwards replaced by a second, noninvasive clone which affected 14 babies. Phenotypically, the two strains also differed in their prodigiosin production, the first one being non-pigmented whereas the second one displayed pink-red pigmentation. The environmental isolate and clinical isolates from other wards were genetically distinct. Although S. marcescens continued to be isolated occasionally, the end of the outbreak was signalled by the replacement of the original strains with sporadic strains with other molecular typing patterns. CONCLUSIONS: There was a clear difference in the pathogenicity of the two outbreak clones. The molecular typing methods were useful epidemiologic tools which emphasized the difference between the two outbreak strains. RAPD-PCR, although relatively easy to perform, has limited reproducibility, whereas PFGE is discriminatory arid reproducible. In the forthcoming months people will travel to the UK from a SARS zone of potential re-emergence. We are repetitively warned of concerns over the next flu pandemic. We have an opportunity to be prepared; to contain an infection as early as possible and to prevent nosocomial amplification.\n\nIn 2004, during the SARS post-outbreak period a patient with a febrile respiratory illness was referred to North Manchester General Hospital for evaluation of possible SARS-CoV infection. The patient had recently returned to the UK from Mainland China with an illness which had started prior to departure from China. During the course of the patient's admission several factors emerged as practical aspects of the patient's care. We believe that there is a need for detailed step by step guidance for clinicians regarding the day to day management of such a case. As a result of our experience with this patient, we are highlighting several of these issues. How to optimally prepare for a potential case of SARS-CoV or Avian Influenza infection may include the following: 1. Hospital plan development for dealing with such a case, with a multi disciplinary approach is crucial. The plan should provide the detail required by the various parties. 2. Assessment of which components of any plan/policy are generic with regard to other infectious diseases and build on this. 3. Practical preparedness: for example development of a 'preprepared kit' including all that may be required for an assessment and laminated aide memoirs on walls in isolation rooms, giving clear step by step guidance for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) usage etc. 4. Training of staff with regular updates, which will include basic principles on how to provide safe case management. This will involve risk assessment and an adaptation of normal clinical practice. 5. Protocols regarding the use of anti-virals and data collection. 6. Optimisation of day to day infection control practices. 7. Communication plan development including who to contact, when and how. In conclusion: we think that hospital preparedness is paramount and that generic components can be utilised for other infectious diseases.\n\nTHE CLINICAL APPLICATION OF HACCP C. Griffith, P. Obee, R. Cooper School of Applied Sciences, UWIC, Cardiff, UK BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Healthcare Associated Infections (HAIs) continue to attract media and consumer attention, impact upon healthcare delivery and are a cause of morbidity and modality. \"Winning ways\" (NHS action plan) has identified seven action areas, with area one recommending the use of Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP), although little guidance on its application is provided. This study applies approaches and strategies based upon HACCP and relevant pre-requisite programmes (PRPs) to the decontamination of endoscopes. METHODS: Observation of practices combined with examination of the documentation used by 2 endoscopy clinics was undertaken. The procedures used were compared to the 7 HACCP principles and 12 logic sequences outlined by the Codex Alimentarius Committee. Real time monitoring, as defined by Codex, was undertaken after cleaning, prior to disinfection using ATP bioluminescence, providing a measure of residual organic debris. RESULTS: Endoscope reprocessing was conducted in accordance with the British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines. Comparison of in use \"practices\" with HACCP principles indicated variability between units and neither unit implemented all HACCP steps. Monitoring indicated that cleaning, an essential step prior to decontamination, was often not adequately performed. Biopsy and suction channels from endoscopes processed in both units were found to contain organic matter. The water used during decontamination was of good microbiological quality, although endoscope tips were found to be contaminated, as were environmental surfaces likely to be in contact with clean endoscopes. CONCLUSION: The HACCP and PRP approach can be applied in healthcare environments and could help to reduce healthcare acquired infections by providing a risk based management framework. The importance of the contribution of infection control programmes to reducing patient morbidity, modality and treatment costs incurred by hospitals has been wall recognized. 1 It is also acknowledged that non-compliance with standard precautions may be related to a lack of knowledge amongst healthcare workers regarding the potential risk of infection transmission both to themselves and to patients. 2 The Infection control guidelines for Cork University Hospital were updated in July 2004. 3 We decided, following the introduction of these guidelines, to ascertain the level of knowledge of nursing and medical staff regarding fundamental aspects of infection control practice. Prior to the introduction of the guidelines, infection control teaching had occurred on an informal basis on each ward/department but was sporadic in nature due to staff shortages. METHODS: We designed a short, anonymous cross-sectional questionnaire. It consisted of questions based on the core elements of the first three chapters of the infection control guidelines. RESULTS: The majority of respondents were female and members of the nursing staff. The need to place patients in a single room in order to adhere with contact, droplet or airborne precautions was underestimated. Surgical wound infection and urinary tract infection were the most commonly identified examples of hospital-acquired infection. Vancomycin was recognized twice as often as Linezolid as a possible choice of antibiotic treatment for patients with serious MRSA infection. There was greater awareness of the risk of transmission of hepatitis C and HIV than hepatitis B in the case of a needlestick injury from an infected patient to a healthcare worker. CONCLUSION: The study reveals a lack of knowledge amongst nurses and doctors in key areas of infection control. It may be used to guide further teaching sessions for both medical and nursing staff to reinforce the principles of infection control and optimise its practice in this hospital. result was recorded (target 100). A urine sample had been sent for culture in 92 patients (target 100). Of the 92 samples sent, 54(59%) grew mixed or non-significant numbers of organisms. The MSU result was recorded in the medical notes of only 16 patients. Choice of empirical therapy: Compared to the pre guideline audit, prescribing of trimethroprim fell from 37% to 2% and that of nitrofurantoin increased from 0% to 55%. Of the 64 patients with complicated UTIs, 30 were prescribed nitrofurantoin. In only 9 patients was empirical therapy modified. Duration of therapy: 69% of patients with uncomplicated UTI received O3 days therapy (target 0% O3 days). 55% of patients with complicated UTI were treated for fewer than 7 days (target 0% !7-14 days). Intended duration of treatment was documented in 57 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Introduction of the guidelines was associated with a fall in prescriptions of trimethoprim whilst those for nitrofurantoin increased. Nitrofurantoin was often used inappropriately, for patients with complicated UTIs. Duration of therapy was often not consistent with guidelines. Documentation of results and intended treatment duration was poor. PARTICIPANTS, METHODS AND RESULTS: All Orthopaedic staff of our hospital were asked to participate (nZ92). 55 subjects in group 1 were asked to clean their hands, using 1.75 ml (one application, as suggested by manufacturer) of alcohol gel containing a clear fluorescent substance. UV light was used to identify areas which had been missed. The missed areas were recorded onto a proforma by the assessor. The subjects were shown which areas they had missed and retested in the same way 7 days later after viewing a poster showing six recommended stages of hand washing. 37 subjects in group 2 were asked to clean their hands with two applications (3.5 ml) of the same gel. Initial assessment was identical to group 1 and they were not retested. They were age (G3 years) and sex matched to 37 subjects from group 1 for comparison. 31 pairs were further matched for job description. The percentage area missed on the dorsum and palm of all hands was calculated. Wash 1 showed a wide variation in performance (total area missed 0% to 34.7%). Females performed better that males (average area missed 6% vs 10%, pZ0.06) and Nurses better than Doctors (5.3% vs 11.6%, pZ0.013). The dorsum of the hands was missed more than the palm (13% vs 2.1% area missed, P!0.001). In wash 2 (following education), 92% of subjects improved their performance with a mean reduction in area missed from 7.7% to 2.3% (p!0.001). Group 2 performed significantly better than age and sex matched Group 1 subjects before education (mean area missed 6.6% vs 1.2%; p!0.001). Additional matching for job description did not alter this result. There was no significant difference between Group 1 following education and Group 2 (mean area missed 2.4% vs 1.2%; pZ0.11).\n\nCOMMENT: This study demonstrates hand washing performance by HCWs is poor when using the volume of gel recommended by manufacturers. The improvement following education with a fluorescent gel and a UV light box demonstrates that this is an effective teaching method. However, an equivalent effect can be achieved by increasing the amount of gel used. To illustrate a case of vertebral discitis and paravertebral abcess due to P. multocida which responded to conservative treatment with ciprofloxacin when non-surgical treatment with co-amoxyclav had failed. CASE REPORT: A 29 year old man with established alcoholic liver disease presented with 2 months of back pain which intermittently radiated from his lumber spine to his left foot. No sphincter disturbance had occurred but in the week preceding admission he had developed night sweats and became bedbound. He recalled being scratched by his cat 2 months prior to admission but he had not required medical attention. He was febrile, tachycardic and in severe pain. Anal sphincter tone on rectal examination was intact. Straight leg raising was markedly impaired bilaterally with reduced pin-prick sensation in an L5 distribution in his left foot and reduced reflexes in his left leg. There was an acute inflammatory response (white cell count 20.3, C-reactive protein 49 g(dL). Blood cultures grow small, Gram negative cocco-bacilli which were identified as Pasteurella multocida on API 20NE testing (Biomerieux, France). The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for amoxycillin-clavulanic acid and ciprofloxacin were 0.094 and 0.32 by the E-test method. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of his lumbar spine showed an inflammatory discitis at L4/5 with an abscess extending posteriorly, impinging on the thecal sac and with marked disc space narrowing. He was treated conservatively with intravenous amoxycillinclavulanic acid with initial defervesence. Four days into treatment he became febrile once more with an associated rise in CRP and oral ciprofloxacin 750 mg twice daily was prescribed as adjunctive treatment and his temperature resolved. Inflammatory markers were normal after 5 weeks with complete resolution of the abscess on further MRI scanning but with marked residual destruction of both L4 and L5 vertebrae. Ciprofloxacin was prescribed for a total of 6 weeks following which he defaulted from all further follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: \u2020 We believe this to be only the second documented case of a paravertebral abscess due to P. multocida and the first in which ciprofloxacin has been used. \u2020 We suggest ciprofloxacin has a place in the treatment of deepseated odhopaedic infections with Pasteurella species and its use may facilitate recovery without a requirement for surgical abscess drainage. Other investigations, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and differential white count results, are available rapidly. We were interested in how the results of these rapid investigations correlate with bacteraemia, and how best to combine rapidly available results in order to detect severe community acquired illness.\n\nTo address this, we studied a cohort of 6234 patients admitted from the community, who had clinical suspected infection, as judged by the taking of blood cultures. The demographic characteristics of the Cohort and the blood culture isolates obtained have been previously described 1 . Here, we have analyzed their admission CRP results, as well as their full blood counts. We show the quantitative relationships between CRP concentration, admission lymphocyte and neutrophil counts. If one excludes cases of neutropenia (neutrophils !1!10 9 /L), then the risk of bacteraemia rises continuously as neutrophil count rises and CRIP increases: no \"cut off\" value is evident. Risk also increases as lymphocyte count declines, as we have previously described. 1 In the prediction of community acquired bacteremic illness, in the cohort studied, CRP concentrations added little to the information provided by neutrophil and lymphocyte counts. These data should assist assessment of bacteraemia likelihood in patients admitted from the community. Although, there have been several reports of the emergence of metronidazole resistance in anaerobes, most laboratories still use sensitivity to a metronidazole disc for preliminary identification of anaerobes in mixed culture. Metronidazole is also widely used as first line therapy in suspected or proven cases of anaerobic infections. We describe a case of a pelvic abscess caused by a metronidazole resistant Bacteroides fragilis resulting in treatment failure. The reference lab confirmed the isolates as B. fragilis by PCRrestriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and the minimum inhibitory concentration was determined to be 32 mg/L. The nimA gene, which is associated with metronidazole resistance, was identified in this strain. We discuss the potential implication of identifying anaerobe on the basis of metronidazole sensitivity and also need to perform sensitivity studies on anaerobes. A 55-year-old man presented to his GP with increasing shortness of breath and orthopnoea for 2 weeks. He had undergone mitral and aortic valve replacement 20 years previously for rheumatic heart disease. He was taking long-term steroid therapy, (prednisolone 3 mg a day) for sarcoidosis suffered from type II diabetes mellitus, controlled by diet alone. On admission he was afebrile normal white cell count and C reactive protein (CRP). Trans-oesophageal echocardiogram showed significant paravalvular leak across the mitral valve and he was scheduled for a second mitral valve replacement. He was converted from warfarin to intravenous heparin. On day 18 of his admission he developed diarrhoea, a pyrexia of 39 8C and became hypotensive. His CRP rose to 152 g/I, and his renal function deteriorated. Repeat echocardiogram did not show any evidence of infective endocarditis. Non-lactose fermenting, oxidase negative, aerobic Gram-negative rods were isolated from four sets of blood cultures taken 2 days apart. The organism appeared susceptible to ampicillin, cephalosporins, ciprofloxacin, aminoglycosides and carbapenems by disc diffusion testing but could not be identified biochemically by routine methods. Chest X-ray, abdominal X-ray and ultrasound abdomen did not show any focus of infection and his peripheral intravenous catheter site was presumed to be the portal of entry for this organism. The patient was treated with ciprofloxacin for 7 days and made a good recovery. The mitral valve replacement was carried out 3 days after completing his course of ciprofloxacin. He is currently doing well 6 months post surgery. The reference laboratory identified the organism as Acidovorax species by gas chromatography of cellular fatty acids. Our case proves the pathogenic potential of this organism in a clinical setting. We grew it from four separate blood cultures taken over 2 days in a patient with clinical and biochemical evidence of sepsis. This is the first documented case of sepsis due to Acidovorax. (1) .When the diagnosis is suspected, this involves performing an urgent cell count manually, which is time consuming and laborious. SBP is a life-threatening condition which requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. A few studies have suggested the use of urine dipsticks as a suitable alternative to cell counts to diagnose SBF. We, therefore, evaluated the use of leukocyte esterase (LE) dipsticks as a rapid and effective bedside method to diagnose SBP. METHODS: Ascitic fluid samples from acutely unwell patients with chronic liver disease were included in the study. Laboratory cell counts were performed using the Fast-Read counting chamber followed by routine culture. Samples with cell counts O250 PMN/ml. were also cultured in blood culture bottles. The same samples were also tested by an automated Aution analyser using Uriflet S strips. Each sample was tested for the presence of LE, blood and nitrate being read spectrophotometrically. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty ascitic fluid samples from 80 patients were studied. Seven samples (from 6 patients) satisfied the criterion of SBP by cell count. Of these samples, 6 also had a positive LE test (range 25-500 leukocytes/mL). The sensitivity and specificity of this test was 85.7% and 93.5%, respectively. The positive predictive value was low (42.9%), but the test had an excellent negative predictive value of 99.1%. The detection of blood or nitrate did not assist in the diagnosis of SBR. In 7 patients ascitic fluid was culture positive (8.8%). However, in 3 patients in whom the manual cell counts were not diagnostic, the culture results may have been due to contamination. CONCLUSIONS: The use of an LE dipstick in ascitic fluid samples is a rapid and reliable diagnostic method to exclude SBP. It can be used both in the laboratory and at the bedside. As majority of the ascitic fluid samples have cell counts !250 PMN/mL, the use of LE dipsticks will reduce laboratory workload, especially out-ofhours. However, all LE positive samples need to be confirmed by traditional cell count microscopy and culture. Previous studies which used LE test in ascitic fluid using dipsticks from different manufacturers has produced similar negative predictive results. Over a 14-day period at the end of February 2004, 3 adults with severe, invasive group A Streptococcus (GAS) infection were admitted to hospitals in Sheffield, UK. All were communityacquired and in non-intravenous drug users. One patient presented with necrotising fasciitis of the hand after a trivial injury, another with a short history of dry cough and malaise, the third presented to his GP with a swollen knee 2 days after a transient sore throat. The latter two patients developed septic shock and died within 24 h of admission. The cases were notable as only five adults were seen with GAS bacteraemia in Sheffield in the first 3 months of 2003. Review of public health information and laboratory data suggested that this might be part of a more widespread problem in the community. In response, the local Consultant for Communicable Disease Control (CCDC) triggered an alert cascade. An e-mail was issued to all Sheffield General Practitioners warning them to be vigilant to the manifestations of severe streptococcal sepsis, to send bacterial throat swabs from patients with sore throats and to have a lower than usual threshold for administering antibiotics. This enhanced awareness promptly led to a noticeable rise in the total numbers of swabs received, however the percentage positivity of GAS from throat swabs was also increased, which was sustained over a 16-week period. Analysis of data from the outbreak period revealed a marked increase in the percentage positivity compared to the previous year. Isolates of those with severe disease showed a high proportion of mucoid M18 strains, however serotyping failed to identify a predominant M type amongst other strains. We present data from the outbreak, discuss the role of the laboratory in identifying outbreaks of GAS disease and the public health response. It highlights the need for close liaison between microbiologists, infectious diseases and public health in the management of local outbreaks of infection. The mean CRP at diagnosis was significantly higher in the primary infection group (107 (CI 84-130.6)) than the post op group (57.7 (CI 16.5-91.8)). pZ4.04. There was no difference in the time to resolution of CRP following treatment between the two groups. 9/17 post-op patients had biopsies for culture in the post-op group. 4 were culture positive. 8/17 had blood cultures and none were positive. 39/53 patients with primary infection had biopsies for culture, 20 were culture positive. 45/53 had blood cultures, 17 were positive. A wider variety of organisms were found. Significantly more patients with primary discitis were either blood culture or biopsy culture positive (58%) vs post op infections (24%) (pZ 0.025). There were no significant differences in antibiotics used or length of time on antibiotics between the groups. 4/17 of the post-op patients had further surgery and 19/53 had surgery in the primary infection group.\n\nOf those followed up there were 2 deaths in the primary group, 45% had persisting neurological symptoms and/or pain in the primary group vs 47% in the post-op group. CONCLUSIONS: Post-op and primary discitis have similar presentations with symptoms of back pain and raised CRP in most cases. Primary discitis patients are more likely to have premorbid factors. The GRP is higher in those with primary discitis and patients were more likely to have positive cultures reflecting a greater systemic upset with more bacteraemia. A wider variety of organisms was found in primary discitis. However the treatment and outcome did not vary significantly between the two groups. INTRODUCTION: Osteoarticular tuberculosis is uncommon, representing around 1-5% of all cases of tuberculosis. 60% of cases involve the spine, while peripheral joint Infection is less common and tends to involve single or few large joints in an asymmetrical pattern. Here we present four cases of peripheral tuberculous arthritis, three adults and one child, all of whom have presented to our service over the past year. FINDINGS: The joints involved were elbow (two cases), ankle and shoulder. In all cases, swelling was insidious in onset, with pain in three out of four cases. All but one case had a tender effusion; the fourth had demonstrated synovial thickening without pain. All had concomitant extra-articular tuberculosis (two cases asymptomatic pulmonary, one case pulmonary and peritoneal and one case granulomatous myositis at another site), although two patients had no systemic symptoms such as weight loss, fever or sweats. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was cultured from joint fluid or synovial biopsy in three out of four cases; in the fourth, a bone biopsy showed non-specific inflammation. All four cases were from ethnic backgrounds where tuberculosis prevalence is higher than in the indigenous white population, and three had a history of tuberculosis contact. Despite this in one of the cases, the diagnosis was delayed for 5 months. All four patients received standard antituberculous therapy without surgical intervention. Three out of four patients made a full recovery in terms of joint function; one patient is currently on therapy and has had significant improvement in her joint symptoms but with mild residual limitation of range of movement. CONCLUSIONS: Tuberculosis of peripheral joints is uncommon but should be considered in any patient with subacute joint pain and/or swelling, particularly if there is an epidemiological link. Joint symptoms may be the initial presentation of disseminated tuberculosis with the potential for transmission to others. Delayed diagnosis can lead to progressive bony destruction which may be irreversible, particularly in adults. Early treatment with antituberculous therapy alone usually leads to complete resolution and surgery is only required in severe joint deformity. London and injected heroin subcutaneously (\"skin popping\") but not intravenously and were socially unconnected. All presented with classical symptoms: dysadhria, diplopia, dysphagia and muscle weakness. On examination the following clinical signs were present: fever (2), ptosis (4), opthalmoplegia (3), dilated, poorly responsive pupils (2) and flaccid limb paralysis (4). Rapidity of onset was variable (range 4-15 days) and all patients had attended the A&E Dept at least once, on a separate occasion, during this period. 3 patients presented with respiratory failure that required mechanical ventilation for 18-54 days (all were noted to have excessive salivation during endotracheal intubation). One patient had radiological features of pneumonia. Autonomic dysfunction, manifest by cardiovascular instability (arrhythmia, hypotension) were also prominent in 2 cases. The mouse bioassay for toxin type A confirmed the diagnosis in 1/4 cases and a PCR-assay for neuratoxin genes was negative in abscess pus from the 2 cases tested. Clostridium botulinum, was not cultured from any clinical specimen. Electrophysiologic studies showed characteristic abnormalities in 2 patients (reduced motor action potentials with small incremental increase after muscular contraction). A transiently positive Tensilon test was documented in 1 case. All patients' received botulinum antitoxin upon clinical diagnosis, without any adverse effects. Surgical drainage of skin abscesses was performed in 3 cases (no abscess was identified in the remaining patient). All received antibiotics that included metronidazole (4) and benzyl penicillin (1). Hospital stay was variable (range 17-100 days) but excellent recoveries with minor residual neurological deficit were made in every case. Wound botulism in injecting drug users has only been described in the UK since 2000 but is increasing rapidly. Botulism is a clinical diagnosis that should be considered in \"skin poppers\" presenting with occulo-bulbar weakness and/or fulminant respiratory failure. Skin abscesses may be absent and nerve conduction studies may differentiate botulism from other causes of acute-onset neuromuscular weakness. Proper reporting of all clinically diagnosed cases is essential to help monitor and control this emerging outbreak. \n\n\u2020 All were male injecting drug users (IDUs). Three were \"muscle poppers\". \u2020 Ages ranged from 25 to 33 years (medianZ26 years). \u2020 Visual disturbance (blurred or double vision) was an early feature in all presentations followed by dysarthria, dysphagia and progressive weakness. \u2020 One patient complained of a \"heavy head\" and another was \"unable to hold their head up\". \u2020 Respiratory arrest occurred in two patients (subsequent to their consideration as cases of botulism). \u2020 Three patients required mechanical ventilation and tracheostomies. \u2020 Of the three patients admitted to intensive care, the duration of mechanical ventilation ranged from 19 to 52 days (median Z45 days). \u2020 All four patients had soft tissue abscesses. Clostridium botulinum (type A) organisms were identified in two patients from excised abscess material by FSML. \u2020 Mouse bioassay performed at FSML identified botulinum toxin (Type A) in serum in three cases. \u2020 Although all patients waived botulinum anti-toxin, the interval between admission and administration of antitoxin ranged from 1 to 3 days. CONCLUSIONS: \u2020 Wound botulism should be considered in any IDU presenting with neurological symptoms or signs. \u2020 Early review by an anaesthetist is advisable and patients with suspected wound botulism who have not yet developed respiratory failure should initially be closely monitored in a high dependency unit of intensive care unit environment. \u2020 Outcome is worse when there is delay in administering botulinum antitoxin with longer requirements for mechanical ventilation and intensive care admission. Of these suspected cases, 25 were in England and 6 were confirmed, 3 from South Yorkshire and 3 from London. Wound botulism is characterised by a symmetric, afebrile, descending, flaccid paralysis. Common early symptoms include blurred vision, drooping eyelids, slurred speech, difficulty in swallowing, breathlessness and muscle weakness. However, patients may present with respiratory failure due to rapid paralysis of respiratory muscles. There is no loss of sensation or of consciousness, which can lead to a 'locked in syndrome' if unrecognised. Management includes the administration of specific anti-toxin, wound debridement, antibiotic therapy and intensive respiratory support. Prognosis is good if the diagnosis is recognised and treatment commenced early, untreated the mortality is at least 25% 3 .\n\nWe present three cases of wound botulism in IVDUs that were all managed in a central teaching hospital in June and July 2004. Clostridium botulinum, toxin type A was confirmed in all cases. The first case, which presented to a local DGH, went unrecognised for 5 days, diagnosis being made on analysis of electromyography. The 2nd and 3rd cases were diagnosed and treated more promptly and experienced much improved outcomes. A 39 year-old intravenous drug user presented to A&E apparently very drowsy and was found to be in type II respiratory failure. He did not respond to naloxone or flumazenil and his respiratory function deteriorated, requiring intubation and ventilation. He was noted the next day to have bilateral ptosis despite a normal PCO 2 while being ventilated. A Tensilon test was performed which showed a marked improvement in the ptosis, suggesting myasthenia gravis, but the effect was of much shorter duration than usually seen myasthenia. An atypical Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome was considered but lumbar puncture was normal. He was found to have small lesions on his buttocks from skin-popping and the possibility of botulism was raised. He was treated presumptively for botulism and following clinical improvement, he was taken off the ventilator. He required re-intubation for hypercapnia and suffered a VF arrest, followed by an asystolic arrest as a consequence of potassium fluxes due to Suxamethonium administration in the setting of botulism. He was resuscitated successfully and went on to recover uneventfully. This case is one of several recent cases of botulism in the drugusing population in Scotland. The diagnosis should be considered in any drug user presenting with neurological problems or respiratory failure, and a Tensilon test may be falsely positive as in this case. Great care should be taken in the induction of anaesthesia due to the potential for life-threatening arrhythmias in association with suxamethonium administration in this setting. Broad spectrum antibiotics such as meropenem and tazocin are increasingly relied upon to treat infections caused by Gram negative bacteria. There has been much discussion locally as to which of these two drugs should be preferred. However, data on levels of antibiotic resistance and usage were lacking. To this end, an audit was undertaken of resistance to meropenem & tazocin amongst all Gram negative rods isolated from blood cultures in a 1600 bed Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust between 1998 and 2003. The usage of meropenem, tazocin, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime, gentamicin & vancomycin over the same period was also examined. Information was obtained from microbiology and pharmacy computer records. There were 3806 positive blood cultures which grew Gram negative rods during the study period. Meropenem resistance remained steady after an initial fall with overall level of 4.93% (range 2.79-9.03%). Tazocin resistance was 10.90% (range 5.99-17.36%) with significant variation throughout. There were no significant trends in these data. There were minor changes in the range of species resistant to these two antibiotics over time.\n\nUsage of vancomycin tripled and meropenem & gentamicin more than doubled over the same period (p!0.000001) whereas cefuroxime usage remained steady and ceftriaxone usage fell (P!0.006) by around 2/3. Tazocin usage initially increased until a supply shortage in late 2001, then began to rise again towards previous levels.\n\nIn conclusion, between 1998 and 2003, in a single NHS Hospital Trust, despite significant increases in the usage of meropenem, vancomycin and gentamicin, there has been no significant increase in the levels of resistance to meropenem or tazocin among Gram negative rods isolated from blood cultures. This implies that concerns about increasing resistance to these two drugs are unfounded in our Trust and ought not to affect prescribing policy. However, continuous surveillance is required, both locally and nationally, to inform regular reviews of antibiotic prescribing policy. The inappropriate use of antibiotics is widespread and leads to the emergence of resistant organisms, causes unwanted adverse effects and places an extra financial cost on the health services. Attempts to improve prescribing habits of doctors have been largely unsuccessful. This study was carried out in Beaumont Hospital, a tertiary referral teaching hospital in Dublin. Over four consecutive weeks current antibiotic prescriptions on three general surgical wards were assessed by the clinical microbiology team. Prescriptions were deemed inappropriate if they did not conform to hospital antibiotic guidelines; if duration of antibiotic treatment exceeded guidelines; if dose or dosage interval was incorrect, or if an alternative agent was indicated by available sensitivity results. In each instance of inappropriate treatment, a recommendation to change the prescription was made in the medical chart and a member of the surgical team was contacted with the advice. It was documented whether or not this advice was followed. Treatment was felt to be inappropriate in 58% (100/171) of prescriptions studied. The two common reasons for treatment to be deemed inappropriate were prolonged administration of perioperative prophylaxis and the co-administration of metronidazole with co-amoxiclav. Of the 100 cases in which a recommendation to change treatment was made, the advised change was implemented in A49. Trying to effect improvement in antibiotic prescribing in this manner was time-intensive (48 h over 4 weeks) and yielded only moderate results. Two specific areas of inappropriate antibiotic use were identified and further interventions to target these have been planned. Triclosan is a widely used broad spectrum biocide and is recommended for elimination of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) carriage. MRSA isolates with reduced susceptibility to triclosan have been described; reduced triclosan susceptibility has been shown to occur through over-expression and or aminoacid changes in Fabl. Our study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of reduced triclosan susceptiblity in MRSA isolates, the role of fabl mutations in triclosan resistance, the potential transferability of triclosan resistance and its links with other antimicrobial resistance. The susceptibility of 5243 S. aureus isolates to triclosan and a variety of other antimicrobial compounds were determined by agar dilution or disc diffusion methods. Direct nucleotide sequencing of PCR amplimers was used to detect changes in fabl. Curing of resistance was attempted by growth at elevated temperature and conjugal transfer of resistance was carried out by mixed culture with recipient RN4220. The number of isolates (3.9%) showing reduced triclosan susceptibility was found to be low despite widespread use of triclosan. No evidence was found of concomitant antimicrobial resistance associated with reduced triclosan susceptibility, including mupirocin resistance. Although the majority of isolates examined had amino-acid changes in Fabl they were not essential for reduced susceptibility to triclosan suggesting other mechanisms may be involved. Attempts to transfer or cure triclosan resistance were unsuccessful, which suggests that plasmids were not involved in the resistance of our isolates. The source was thought to be unscreened blood in Pakistan. His condition deteriorated over the next 5 days and he developed liver failure with ascites and a coagulopathy. Liver transplantation was considered but thought inappropriate given his age and significant cardiovascular co-morbidity. An alternative was therefore sought. He was commenced on a combination of adefovir 10 mg once daily and lamivudine 100 mg once daily. HBV DNA levels were quantified weekly by PCR (Taqman) during treatment. A rapid tan in HBV viral load was seen from 8.79! 10 9 copies/ml on admission to 1.06!10 2 copies/ml on discharge, and this corresponded with a significant clinical improvement. He was discharged home 33 days after admission, and 26 Length of stay decreased from a mean of 9.6 days to 7.44 days and then 5.52 days, while mean bed occupancy rose from 72% to 82% and 87% over the same timescale. Modality rates decreased from 3.1% to 0.7% overall, with rates in non-infective cases dropping from 6.4% to 6.0% to 1.4% and in infective cases the figures were largely unchanged at 1.1%, 2.0% and 0.6% respectively. Modality in HIV-related admissions was 22.8% in 1991 but 4.5% in 2001.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This comparison of three studies in three decades illustrates the changing nature of admissions over the three decades at a regional Infection Unit, which over time is seeing relatively more infective cases. It confirms the impression of clinicians that admissions are increasing generally but that length of stay is decreasing, while bed occupancy is increasing.\n\nHIV data parallels the situation elsewhere with inpatient admissions reduced and mortality greatly reduced. The insights gained can be put to practical use in planning future services and improving the quality and efficiency of the Unit. Although we received MRSA samples from almost every GP in the Belfast area, it was not surprising that the greatest concentration of isolates came from a number of large multi-doctor or multi-practice health centres. MRSA positivity for practices that generated R40 Staphylococcus aureus isolates ranged from 8.86% to 38.78% (mean: 21.04%). There was no significant change in our monthly totals of MRSA over this time period. CONCLUSIONS: Mapping software can be a useful means of visually presenting microbial epidemiological data, such as antibiotic resistance, to inform public health debate and direct educational and surveillance activities in the non-hospital setting. Microsofte Mappoint is limited by its coverage (19% for Northern Ireland, but 100% in Great Britain) and postcodes themselves may have slight inaccuracies. Our ability to accurately map MRSA is limited by incomplete patient postcode data (17% of patients in this study). Similarly, knowledge of hospital contact or recent antibiotic use might facilitate more pertinent analysis of antibiotic resistance in the community. We would recommend this technique for pathogens such as Clostridium difficile and other resistance phenotypes (penicillin resistant pneumococci, extended spectrum b-lactamases) where there is a paucity of epidemiological data in non-hospital settings. Penicilliosis marneffei is a life threatening invasive fungal infection caused by Penicillus marneffei, which has been reported predominantly from Southeast Asia and southern China. Though Penicilliosis was discovered in China very early, the disease associated with HIV infection was confirmed lately in 1999 in China. Since then, 17 cases with disseminated penicilliosis marneffei and AIDS were reported in China. The 17 cases included 13 male and 4 male with an age range from 25 to 50. The patients acquired HIV infection due to heterosexual contact and/or injecting drug using. Fever, cough, and anemia were seen in all cases. Rash and lymphadenopathy were found in 12 cases. Splenomegaly and hepatomegaly were presented in 10 and 8 cases, respectively. Oral candidiasis was the commonest complication associated with the co-infection. P. marneffei yielded from the cultures of blood, bone marrow, secretion of skin lesions, pleural fluid, and pericardial fluid. The fungus was also found in the smears of bone marrow and biopsy of lymph nodes and skin lesions. 13 cases received anti-fungal therapy using amphotericin B and/or one azole (fluconazole or itraconazole). Interestingly, fluconazole alone made two patients' condition obviously relieve, though P. marneffei was usually resistant to the agent. Of the 17 cases, 3 was cured, 5 improved, 6 died, and 3 lost. In conclusion, unlike in Southeast Asia, penicilliosis marneffei remains a very rare opportunistic infection associated with HIV infection and is more frequently seen in HIV negative individuals in China. The disease is primarily found in Guano province, southern China. However, the disease has spread to other parts of China including Beijing, Guangdong, Yunnan, and Sichuan. Fever, cough, anemia, rash, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly are the common manifestations of P. marneffei and HIV co-infection. Penicilliosis is a fatal opportunistic infection in AIDS patients. A NEW CASE: A 26-year-old policeman who resided in Guangxi Province for 3 years presented to his county hospital with a 2month history of high fever and cough. A provisional diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis was made and he received anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy for 1 month but without a clinical improvement. Following admission to West China Hospital, blood and bone marrow cultures as well as a bronchoscopic biopsy were positive for P. marneffei. Confirmatory serologic testing for HIV was positive. Combination therapy with amphotericin B and itraconazole was instituted and the patient made a good clinical response. Endobronchial involvement caused by this emerging fungal microorganism has rarely been described previously, Clinicians need to be aware that HIV positive patients with a history of residence in or travel to southern China and a clinical presentation suggestive of tuberculosis but responding poorly to anti-tuberculosis treatment may have penicilliosis marneffei infection. OBJECTIVES: 18 million people worldwide are known to be infected with the filarial nematode Onchocerca volvulus, the causative agent of onchooerciasis. 1 The usual method of diagnosis, acquisition of skin snips and microscopy for presence of typical microfilariae (mf) is invasive for patients and lacks sensitivity, especially in early infection. A sensitive and specific onchocerciasis ELISA based on the recombinant antigen 0vH3 has previously been developed and tested on known mf positive patients on a research level only. 2 In this study we used the OYH3 e34 antigen to set up and validate an onchocerciasis assay for use in a diagnostic tertiary referral laboratory. MATERIALS AND METHODS: OvH3 antigen was produced and incorporated into an indirect non-competitive ELISA and tested against sera from previously untreated mf positive individuals from Cameroon and Guatemla. The assay was also tested against definite and probable onchocerciasis patients from our hospital.\n\nTo determine specificity, the assay was tested against sera from patients with Loa loa, Wuchereria bancrofti and Mansonella perstans as well as with sera from patients with intestinal nematodes and other helminth infections. Sera from travellers and endemics who had no evidence of helminth infection were used as controls. An additional IgG4 step was performed on 35 serial sera from 15 patients to determine any effects on performance of the assay. All sera also underwent testing in our current in-house Brugia pahangi antigen based filaria assay so a direct comparison of both assays could be performed. RESULTS: 118 out of 121 (97.5%) sera from mf positive patients from Cameroon and 23 out of 24 (95.8%) sera from mf positive patients from Guatemala tested positive with the OvH3 assay. 54 out of 59 patients with onchocerciasis (91.5%) diagnosed at our hospital tested positive with the OvH3 assay. The specificity of the DvH3 assay was calculated at 91.6%, with 15 patients out of 232 onchocerciasis negative patients testing positive. The sensitivities of the in house filaria assay with sera from known onchocerciasis patients from Cameroon, Guatemala and our hospital was 78.8%, 89.4% and 75.7% respectively. The addition of an IgG4 step did not improve the performance characteristics of the assay. DISCUSSION: We have developed a sensitive and specific onchocerciasis assay based on the recombinant antigen 0vH3 which has excellent results when tested both on sera from previously untreated patients and onchocerciasis patients diagnosed in our hospital, most of which had received some ivermectin treatment prior to serological testing. These results show an improvement on our current filaria ELISA which has high sensitivity for the diagnosis of onchocerciasis but which has a high false positive rate, especially with patients infected with Stronygloides stercoralis. An epidemiologic investigation was performed to analyze profiles of resistance of community-associated Staphylococcus aureus to antibiotics, and to assess spread and genotype of communityassociated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA). S. aureus strains were isolated from nasal swab of 3096 healthy volunteers from January 2003 to December 2003 in Seoul, Korea, and their susceptibilities to anti-staphylococcal drugs were studied by the antibiogram method. The evolutionary relationship between CA-MRSA and hospital-acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA) was elucidated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis of Smal macrofragments as well as staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec typing by PCR analysis. The resistance rates of the 781 isolates to penicillin, erythromycin, gentamicin, tetracycline, cephalothin, oxacillin (MRSA) were 91.8%,14.2%, 9.3%, 8.2%, 4.0%, and 3.8%, (30 isolates) respectively. Also the resistance rates to clindamycin, ciprofloxacin, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim were 2.6%, 0.8%, and 0.6%, respectively. However, none of the isolates was resistant to rifampin, nitrofurantoin, teicoplanin, and vancomycin. PCR analysis exhibited that all 30 MRSA isolates contained a macA specific gene and many of them contained pUB110 sequence. In contrast to the results of similar studies, PFGE revealed that most of the C-MRSA isolates did not share a common pulsed field type observed in HA-MRSA infections in Korea, and harbored several variants of staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec type I, II, and IV suggesting that the strains were not closely linked to the previously known isolates. A 42 year old female woman of South African origin is described, who originally presented with fever, weight loss, anaemia and vomiting. Imaging studies revealed marked intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy, a pancreatic cyst, peri-pancreatic inflammation, hypodense lesions in liver and spleen, and bowel wall thickening. She was found to be HIV-1 positive (CD4 count 49 ! 10 9 /L, HIV VIL 5.27 log copies/ml). Lymph node biopsy was not possible for technical reasons. Empirical anti-tuberculous chemotherapy was commenced for suspected intra-abdominal tuberculosis. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was subsequently isolated (from urine sample). After a stormy course, including persistent upper small bowel obstruction (managed conservatively), pancreatitis, severe nutritional impairment and secondary fungal peritonitis, she eventually improved and was discharged from hospital after an 8month admission. However, 2 weeks later she re-presented with marked abdominal distension. Paracentesis revealed milky white fluid consistent with chylous ascites, which has been recurrent despite regular drainage and other therapeutic interventions. Chylous ascites in an unusual condition, most commonly associated with intra-abdominal malignancies and after surgical intervention. Various infections, including tuberculosis, have occasionally been reported as the cause. There are very few reports of chylous ascites in patients with AIDS, but rare cases related to lymphoma, MAC disease, KS and tuberculosis have been described. The prognosis appears to be poor and optimal management is unclear at present. The potential management options, including a medium chain triglyceride diet and the synthetic somatostatin analogue octreotide, will be discussed further in this presentation. Our patient's response to these measures will also be described. The majority of medical students undertake a period of elective study abroad. A significant proportion of students choose electives in developing countries where the prevalence of HIV e35 is considerably higher than in the UK; often in exposure prone specialities such as trauma, surgery and obstetrics and gynaecology. AIMS: To assess the current information that is available to Manchester University medical students regarding their elective, focussing particularly an HIV post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). METHODS: A questionnaire was distributed to medical students who attended a pre-elective seminar at North Manchester General Hospital (NMGH) over a 2 year period from July 2002 to July 2004. This was completed immediately after the lecture. Students who took a supply of PEP on their elective were asked to complete a further questionnaire on their return. PEP was available to students who attended the seminar and were planning an elective to a country with an HIV prevalence of O5%. RESULTS: 79 students completed the pre-travel and 32 students the post-travel questionnaires. The majority were planning an elective in Sub-Saharan Africa 53/77 (69%); of this group 21 had chosen exposure prone specialities. Only 16/72 (22%) of students reported receiving advice on what country and 47/69 (68%) on what speciality to choose. Health advice pre-elective was obtained from a variety of sources most commonly their General Practitioner. Following the pre-elective seminar at NNIGH 68% were aware of the 1 in 300 risk of catching HIV from a needlestick and 92% of the 1 in 1000 risk from a mucosal splash injury. All understood there was a greater than 70% risk reduction when PEP was taken.\n\nOf the post travel respondents one student received a needlestick injury from an HIV positive patient and two students a mucosal splash injury from HIV negative patients. Only the student receiving the needle-stick injury took PEP. CONCLUSION: From the questionnaires returned, 3 students from Manchester Medical School had exposure incidents in the last 2 years; the true figure is likely to be much higher. Medical schools have a duty of care to ensure that students are aware of the potential health risks on their elective. We recommend all medical schools adopt a policy of educating students about their risk of catching HIV and ensuring PEP is available to them. , 55 individuals were identified; three were excluded from analysis (two with HCV antibody seroconversion outside 1 year, one newly diagnosed with follow up data !4 weeks). All were homosexual, HIV-infected males. At diagnosis of acute HCV: age mean 38 years, duration of HIV infection mean 7.3 years, CD4 count mean 464 cells/ml. 30 (58%) were on HAART. HCV genotype: type 1: 35 (67%), type 4: 8 (15%), type 2/3: 4 (8%), untypable: 5 (10%). Presentation: Investigation of abnormal LFTs performed as part of routine HIV care: 32 (61%); symptoms: 9 (17%). Outcome: 39 were not treated in the acute phase, of whom 5 (13%) spontaneously lost detectable HCV RNA over the period of follow up. Of 13 patients treated during the acute phase 9 completed treatment, 4 (31%) were responders at end of treatment (w24); 3 of 12 (25%) at w48, but 2 of the 3 relapsed after w48 (at w63 and w111). CONCLUSIONS: There is ongoing transmission of HCV among HIVinfected, homosexual men. Most cases of acute HCV were identified through routine monitoring of LFTs during HIV care. Few patients cleared HCV RNA spontaneously, and among those treated the virological response was poor. RCTs of longer treatment with combination therapy are needed."}
