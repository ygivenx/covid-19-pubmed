{"title": "Group B Betacoronavirus in Rhinolophid Bats, Japan", "body": "Viruses in the genus Betacoronavirus include pathogens that cause emerging\npandemic diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East\nrespiratory syndrome (MERS), in humans. It has been suggested that bats are major reservoirs\nfor these zoonotic pathogens [9]. This justifies\nsurveillance for coronaviruses (CoVs) in bats throughout the world. In Japan, CoVs belonging\nto the genus Alphacoronavirus have been detected in intestinal and fecal\nspecimens of Eastern bent-winged bats (Miniopterus fuliginosus) in Wakayama\nPrefecture [8]. Here, we report the first demonstration\nof group B betacoronaviruses in little Japanese horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus\ncornutus) in Iwate Prefecture, Japan.\n\nA total of 38 fecal samples were collected individually from captured insectivorous bats,\nincluding 27 little Japanese horseshoe bats (R. cornutus), six greater\nhorseshoe bats (R. ferrumequinum), four Japanese large-footed bats\n(Myotis macrodactylus) and one Ussuri tube-nosed bat (Murina\nussuriensis) from 2 separate caves in Morioka, Iwate Prefecture with permission\nfrom the local administration, during 2013. We designated specimens as \u201cOg\u201d or \u201cIs\u201d based on\nthe respective originating cave name, Ogayu (39.6019N, 141.2508E) and Isari (39.6771N,\n141.0881E), and we also assigned them numbers. The Ogayu cave is an abandoned gold mine called\nManju. The Isari cave is located at the Atago shrine, which is approximately 16 km away from\nthe Ogayu cave. Feces were homogenized with sterile phosphate buffered-saline solution\ncontaining penicillin, streptomycin and amphotericine B. Viral RNA was extracted from feces\nhomogenates by the single-step guanidium isothiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method [1]. cDNA synthesis and PCR were performed as described\npreviously [3]. The PCR primers IN-6 and IN-7 were used\nto amplify the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene of CoV as described\nelsewhere [5]. We also performed a second-step PCR using\nthe IN-6 primer and a reverse primer (5\u2032-ATCAGATAGAATCATCATAGAGA-3\u2032) described previously\n[2]. PCR products of expected size were obtained in\neight of 38 samples, after the second-step PCR. Five of the eight positive samples were\nderived from bats roosting in the Isari cave, and the rest were from the Ogaya cave. These\npositive PCR products derived only from the samples of little Japanese horseshoe bats were\nsubjected to nucleotide sequencing as described previously [3]. CoV RNA was not detected in the other three bat species. Virus isolation using\nthe Vero cell culture derived from an African green monkey was unsuccessful, probably due to\ninappropriate choice of cell culture.\n\nWe had a success in the nucleotide sequencing of six of the eight positive samples and have\ndeposited partial nucleotide sequences of the RdRp gene to the DNA databases\nunder the accession numbers AB889995 to AB890000. The 2 other samples unsuccessful in\nnucleotide sequencing were considered to be false-positive in PCR. The six sequences (426 nt)\nshowed more than 98% nt identity to each other. Comparison between the six CoVs from little\nJapanese horseshoe bats and those from DNA databases revealed that the nucleotide sequences\nhad the highest identity (about 91% nt) to bat SARS CoV strain Rp3 (GenBank accession no.\nDQ071615), which was isolated from fecal swabs of Pearson\u2019s horseshoe bats (R.\npearsonii) in Guangxi Province, China in 2005 [4]. Nucleotide sequences aligned using Clustal W [10] were analyzed by the neighbor-joining method [7]. The phylogenetic tree indicated that the six CoV sequences detected in little\nJapanese horseshoe bats have a monophyletic relationship to the SARS CoV in the same lineage\nof the group B betacoronavirus (Fig. 1). Bat SARS CoV or SARS-like CoV has been detected in rhinolophid bats on the Eurasian\ncontinent [4, 6].\n\nOur results indicate that betacoronaviruses closely related to SARS CoV were prevalent among\nlittle Japanese horseshoe bats in Iwate Prefecture, Japan. Currently, pathogenic trait of\nthese betacoronaviruses is unknown. Although there is no evidence of human infection by these\nbat CoVs, the existence of group B betacoronaviruses in bats may be predictive of the\nemergence of a disease, such as SARS, since the Isari cave is also used as a den for civets,\nwhich is another potential intermediate species. During this study, we marked the bats with\naluminum bands to identify them for further investigation of their habitat. This may provide\nfurther information, so we can achieve a better understanding of the relationship between\nrhinolophid bat behavior and betacoronavirus ecology in the future."}
