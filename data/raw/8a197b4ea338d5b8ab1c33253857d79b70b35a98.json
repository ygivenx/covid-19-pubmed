With the exception of gene 3c, which was Infectious bronchitis virus ( IBV ), a member of recently shown to encode small membrane (sM ) protein Coronaviridae family, has a single-stranded positive- (Liu and Inglis, 1991; Smith et al., 1990) , the products sense RNA genome, which is 27 kb in length (Boursnell of all the other ORFs remain unknown. et al., 1987) . Gene 1 (RNA polymerase gene) is located Although IBV is the lone virus in the antigenic group on the 5\u221e end of the genome and is about 20 kb long.\n\nIII of Coronaviridae (Holmes, 1990) , more than twenty The remaining 7 kb of the genome consists of five genes: serotypes within IBV have been recognized worldwide gene 2 (spike glycoprotein (S protein) gene), gene 3, on the basis of virus-neutralization ( VN ) test (Gelb gene 4 [membrane (M ) protein gene], gene 5 and gene et al., 1991) .

In addition, an large genomic fragments in multiple genes ( Kusters untranslated region (UTR) exists on the extreme 3\u221e end et al., 1990; Jia et al., 1995) . Although of the genome. Gene 3 and gene 5 contain three (3a, the individual genes (mostly S protein genes) of many IBV isolates have been sequenced (Binns et al., 1985, * Corresponding author.

Arkansas (Ark) serotype, had undergone recombination in two genes, and expressed both Ark and Mass epitopes on the S1 protein (Jia et al., 1995) . In the previous 2.2. Sequences of gene 3, M protein gene, gene 5 study, we had reported the sequences of the S protein gene, the N protein gene and the 3\u221e-UTR of this strain.\n\nGene 3 of CU-T2 consisted of 711 nt, which contained three ORFs, 3a, 3b and 3c. The ORFs consisted of 174, Here, we report the sequences of all the remaining 3\u221e end genes of CU-T2: gene 3, M protein gene and gene 5.\n\n195 and 282 nt (potentially encode 58, 65 and 94 aa), respectively. 32 nt of the coding sequence of the S protein gene overlapped gene 3. M protein gene consisted of 749 nt, and with a single ORF of 687 nt 2. Experimental and discussion (encoded 229 aa). There were 66 nt overlapping between the 3\u221e end of ORF 3c and 5\u221e end of M protein gene.\n\nThere was a non-coding region consisting of 342 nt between 3\u221e end of M protein gene and gene 5. Gene 5 Cloning of gene 3, M protein gene and gene 5 of CU-T2 are described in Fig. 1 . Three overlapping had 460 nt, and contained two ORFs (5a and 5b) which consisted of 198 and 249 nt (potentially encoded 66 and phagemids, pBT2-t223, pBT2-t231 and pBT2-t237, were used for sequencing in this study. pBT2-t223 contained 83 aa), respectively. 159 nt of ORF 5b overlapped the 5\u221e end sequence of N protein gene (see Fig. 2 ). a 2172 bp fragment which overlapped the 3\u221e end of the S protein gene and most of the 5\u221e end of gene 3 ( Fig. 1 ). pBT2-t231 had a 2100 bp insert which overlapped par-2.3. Comparison of the sequences tially pBT2-t223, and contained the entire gene 3, M Six IBV strains whose nt sequences of the gene 3 are available, are listed in Table 1 . Of those strains, UK/183/66 and UK/68/84 are non-Mass serotype strains (Cavanagh et al., 1992b) , whereas Portugal/322/82 strain belongs to Mass serotype (Cavanagh et al., 1992b) . However, the latter strain and strain KB8523 were possible recombinants, with recombinant fragments located between 3\u221e end of S protein gene and gene 3. (Cavanagh et al., 1992b; Sutou et al., 1988) . The overall nt sequence of CU-T2 gene 3 compared with sequences of the six strains listed in Table 1 , which showed homolo- Fig. 1 . cDNA clones of CU-T2. IBV strain CU-T2 (Jia et al., 1995) was propagated in 11-day-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF ) embryo-gies between 84.1% and 90.8%. Except Portugal/322/82 those of the respective nt sequences. However, the homologies of putative 3b aa sequences were between 87.5% and 95.4%, which showed an average of 6.5% and 4.1% higher homologies than 3a and 3c, respectively. The result suggested that the 3b region is relatively more conserved compared to regions 3a and 3c. In addition, a hydrophobic region found at the amino-terminal region of the 3c protein, which was adjacent to a cysteine-rich region in CU-T2, was similar to that found in other coronaviruses (Siddell, 1995) .\n\nAlthough the M protein gene of IBV was believed to be a conserved gene, comparison of nt sequences of CU-T2 M protein gene to those of three available IBV strains showed only 85.8%, 86.6% and 88.8% homology, respectively ( Table 1) . The aa sequences, however, showed higher homologies (90.3%, 92% and 90.7%, respectively). Three insertions (each encoding an additional aa) were found in the first 240 nt of M protein gene of CU-T2 compared to both Beaudette and KB8523 strains.\n\nOverall nt sequence of gene 5 of CU-T2 showed 90.4% and 96.4% homology to those of Beaudette and KB8523 ( Table 1 ). The aa sequence homology between gene 5a of CU-T2 and that of the other two strains was between 87.9% and 92.4%, and that of gene 5b was 95.2% and 97.6%, respectively ( Table 1 ). The sequence of 5b showed 7.3% and 5.2% higher homologies than those of 5a, indicating that the 5b region was probably more conserved than the 5a region.\n\nThe sequences of gene 3, M protein gene and gene 5 of CU-T2, and those of S protein gene, N protein gene and the 3\u221e-UTR reported previously by us (Jia et al., 1995) , provided all the sequences of the genome except the RNA polymerase gene. A total of 7349 nt were found in a region beginning from the 5\u221e end of S protein gene to the 3\u221e end of CU-T2 genome, compared to 7355 and 7301 nt reported for KB8523 and Beaudette strains, respectively. The sequence CTGAACAA found at the starting sites of S protein gene and gene 3 of CU-T2, and the sequence CTTAACAA found at the start of M protein gene, gene 5 and N protein gene, respectively, were identical to those found in the identical sites in Fig. 2 . Nucleotide sequences of gene 3, M protein gene, and gene 5 of IBV CU-T2. Heavy underlines indicate the putative start codons. Light lines above the sequence indicate the stop codons. The conserved nt sequence CTGAACAA or CTTAACAA, which is located at the starting site of each gene, is boxed. Three overlapping phagemids pBT2-t223, pBT2-t231 and pBT2-t237 containing CU-T2 genes were used for DNA sequencing which was carried out by the dideoxy method using a Sequenase 2.0 DNA sequencing kit ( US Biolchemical, Cleveland, OH, USA).

The overall sequence of strains were between 84.1% and 90.8%, 85.8% and 88.8%, 90.4% and 96.4%, respectively. The sequence the CU-T2 genome distal to the RNA polymerase gene was found to have 87% homology with the equivalent of the CU-T2 genome distal to the RNA polymerase gene was found to have only an 87% homology regions of the Beaudette and KB8523 strains (compared with 92% homology between the latter two strains with those of the Beaudette and KB8523 strains.

Table 1 showed that the nt sequence non-Mass and non-Ark serotype. In addition, the results of aa sequence comparisons suggested that homologies between gene 3, M protein gene and gene 5 of CU-T2 and Beaudette strain were 84.6%, 88.8% and the gene 3b and 5b were relatively more conserved than 3a, 3c and 5a. 90.4%, respectively, while the homologies between CU-T2 and KB8523 were 90.2%, 85.8% and 96.4%.\n\n(3) The nt sequence homologies between gene 3, M protein gene and gene 5 of CU-T2 and Beaudette Furthermore, nt and aa sequences of other individual genes of CU-T2, Beaudette and KB8523 showed strain were 84.6%, 88.8% and 90.4%, respectively, while homologies between the same three genes of different degrees of homology (data not shown), implying that the evolution of the IBV strains might have CU-T2 and KB8523 were 90.2%, 85.8% and 96.4%. Furthermore, nt and aa sequences of other indivi-involved a complex series of events, which are as yet poorly understood. dual genes of CU-T2, Beaudette and KB8523 showed different degrees of homology, implying that the evolution of the IBV strains might have involved a complex series of events.\n\n(1) The gene 3, M protein gene and gene 5 of IBV strain CU-T2 were cloned and sequenced.
