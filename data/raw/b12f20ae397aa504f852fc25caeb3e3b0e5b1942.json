Overall, the number of registrations has increased steadily ( Figure 1 ).The number of registrations before February 1 was small, and the number of registrations quickly increased to 8 on February 2, reaching a peak on February 14(n=18).On January 23, 2020, China's ChiCTR Center registered the first COVID-19 clinical study, and the intervention method was CMT treatment (ChiCTR2000029308).The first TCM clinical study was registered on January 27 (ChiCTR2000029381). The first BI study was registered on February 1 (ChiCTR2000029431). The BEI study was first registered on February 2.\n\nAs of the statistical date, a total of 18 provinces and 4 municipalities nationwide participated in the COVID-19 clinical study ( Figure 2 ).The national registration volume ranked first in Hubei Province (n=69, 29.74%), followed by Guangdong Province (n=29, 12.50%), and Zhejiang Province and Sichuan Province tied for third place (n=23, 9.91%).Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology is the most registered hospital(n=16).\n\nAs shown in Table 1 , 67.67% of the studies were intervention studies and 25.00% were observational studies. 28.02% of the studies were treated with CMT, 12.93% were treated with BI, 28.02% were treated with TCM, and 8.62% were treated with BEI.The early stage accounted for 41.81% of all studies, and 20.69% of the studies were late stages. 53.88% of research is mainly funded by the public, and 57.76% of research is being recruited. However, 22.84% of the studies did not receive ethical approval, and 47.41% were not confirmed by the data management committee. Table 2 , only 6.47% of the studies were multicenter studies. 44.83% of the study participants were between 100 to 300, and only 3.45% of the studies were >1000. 43.53% of the studies were completed within 4-12 months, and only 2.16% were completed within 1 month. 75.0% of the studies used random assignments, but 70.69% of the studies lacked information on blinding. Table 3 ,the chisquare tests revealed significant differences in the design characteristics, depending on the Type of Study, for the items of participants number(P=0.000), study duration (P=0.008), study assignment (P=0.000) and blind method (P=0.000). The number of participants in 45.86% interventional and 43.10% observational studies was concentrated in the 100-300 range.46.50% interventional and 37.93% observational studies were completed within 4-12 months. 78.98% of the interventional All rights reserved.

Only 7.01% of interventional studies were blinded.\n\nSignificant differences could be seen in the dimensions of multicenter study (P=0.022), of participants numbe (P=0.000), study duration(P=0.000) and study assignment(P=0.001) for the four intervention methods.Only 1.54% of CMT studies are multi-center studies.\n\nConversely, 20.00% of BEI studies are multi-center studies, accounting for the largest proportion.The number of participants mainly accounted for: 44.62% of CMT subjects were less than 100, 80.00% of BI subjects were less than 100, and 58.46% of TCM and 65.00% of BEI subjects were between 100 to 300. The study period mainly focused on: 53.85% of the CMT studies were completed within 4 to 12 months, while 40.00% of the BIs were within 1 to 3, 49.23% of the TCMs were within 4 to 12, and 35.00% of the BEI studies were longer than 12 month.For study assignments, 76.92% of CMT, 70.00% of BI, 66.15% of TCM, and 40.00% of BEI studies were randomized. Only 7.69% of CMT, 13.34% of BI, and 3.08% of TCM were blinded in the study.\n\nThere were significant differences in the dimensions of study assignments (P=0.043) in the early and late study stage.60.82% of the early stages and 26.21% of the late stages were randomly assigned to the group. However, there were no significant differences in the main research dimensions of different funding sources (P>0.05).\n\nAll drugs involved in CMT and BI treatment research are summarized, and the frequency of research is recorded (the same drug is only recorded once in the same clinical trial).68.97% of interventions were drug treatment (n=160). In the CMT study, the top three drugs studied by frequency: Chloroquine (n=16, 16.84%), Lopinavir/ritonavir (n=15, 15.79%), and I-IFN (n=11, 11.58%).\n\nIn the BI study, the top three drugs in the study frequency were: cell therapy (n=15, 48.39%), plasma therapy (n=5, 16.13%), Thymosin (n=2, 6.45%) and M/P-AB (n=2, 6.45%).\n\nAmong them, 32.26% of Cell therapy is mesenchymal stem cells, 9.68% of Cell therapy is Cord Blood Mononuclear Cell, 3.23% of Cell therapy is Menstrual Blood-derived Stem Cells, and 3.23% of Cell therapy is Natural Killer Cell.

The ChiCTR registration guidelines divide research types into 7 categories, such as interventional studies, preventive studies, diagnostic tests, and observational studies, etc. [11] . However, it is ambiguous that the registration guidelines classify studies by their nature and purpose.\n\nAccording to international standards, it may be more clear to classify intervention and observation [12] .\n\nIn order to regulate registration, more details should be provided on the randomization procedure and blind method.We found that most interventional studies use randomized allocation, but there are low blinding rates and lack of information.The possible reason is that it is difficult to implement blind method in epidemic situation, but it may also be incomplete information. More than half of the studies did not indicate blind method information.Missing information means that no information about the size of the study is available, which adversely affects the transparency of registration [13] .The results showed that more than half of the studies were not confirmed by the data management committee. Low blinding rate and lack of information may be related to it's. The detection or guidance of the data management committee should be further strengthened to improve the quality of research design [14] .\n\nIt is worth noting that 22.84% of the studies failed ethical verification.All human-oriented clinical trials must in any case follow the \"Helsinki Declaration\", which has become a consensus of the medical community, and follow the basic ethical principle of \"doctors should provide medical care in the best interests of patients\" to ensure the subjects [15, 16] .The ChiCTR Center has issued a warning and requested the supplementary information of the failed units to be reviewed.Medical ethics review should strictly abide by the review work content of the \"Ethical Review Methods for Biomedical Research Involving\n\nHumans\" [17] , and here are two suggestions: (1) undertake experimental projects that match actual capabilities; (2) design of experimental schemes An appropriate research method must be selected based on the nature of the problem to be solved.\n\nAs of February 24, 2020, the overall number of COVID-19 registered clinical studies is on the rise.The possible reason is that China has already initiated a first-level response to All rights reserved.

In addition, in order to cooperate with the epidemic prevention and control work, many national drug clinical trial institutions(GCP) in China have established detailed work guidelines and guidelines to effectively speed up clinical trial review.From the statistical analysis of China's geographical distribution, it is found that the number of registered provinces in Hubei Province ranks first, and the number of registered provinces close to it is higher than that of other provinces. The possible reason is that the COVID-19 epidemic was mainly concentrated in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. There was no large-scale epidemic outbreak in remote provinces, and there were relatively few NCP patients.\n\nWe found significant differences in the dimension of study design characteristics for different study types.The results showed that compared to observational studies, most interventional studies had fewer than 100 participants. However, 8.62% of observational study designs were completed within 1 month. Such designs were not reflected in interventional studies, and most of the interventional studies were completed in 4-12 months.\n\nSimilarly, compared to observational studies, most interventional studies use randomized allocation. These results imply that different interventions have an impact on the design of clinical trials.\n\nThe design of COVID-19 clinical trials should give priority to \"timeliness\". The trial sample size needs to consider the balance between clinical and statistical significance, and its estimated volume reflects the reliability and repeatability of the research results [18] .As public health emergencies do not allow more time for exploratory clinical research and there is no historical data, the sample size estimation of such trials may encounter unprecedented problems.Some scholars have proposed [19] , whether it is possible to reduce the required sample size by \"reducing the power\" or \"increasing the type I error rate\" to complete the clinical trial as soon as possible?But such an approach requires a variety of trade-offs between regulators, sponsors, and researchers.\n\nIn addition, the study period is also \"time-effective\". If a clinical study is long, it may not make much sense in terms of public health emergencies to respond to the outbreak. From the statistical data, it can be seen that the time limit for completing most of the clinical studies of COVID-19 is concentrated within 4-12 months, and very few studies are completed within 1 month. The clinical research to deal with the epidemic is to race against the virus and the epidemic. This time limit seems too long. Is it possible to conduct mid-term analysis or other adaptive, new design methods? Clinical trial statistics need to be continuously developed All rights reserved.

Among them, there are more CMT and TCM studies, and relatively few BI studies.The most frequently studied CMT is chloroquine phosphate.Chloroquine phosphate is an antimalarial drug marketed for many The \"Scheme\" emphasizes the important role of TCM.

The data for this study were derived only from ChiCTR.\n\nThere may be other databases containing COVID-19 clinical studies. The time limit for research registration is short, and relevant registration information has not been filled in, and it cannot truly reflect its true quantity and level. However, the innovation of this article is to summarize and analyze the registration of ChiCTR's COVID-19 clinical research in a timely manner, reflecting the research status and development trend of clinical trials in this field, which is \"time-effective\".\n\nThere were problems of unclear classification of research types and irregular registration behavior. Also, within the studies researched, heterogeneity exists for various dimensions.\n\nDifferent research types, intervention methods, and research stages lead to significant differences in some dimensions of the COVID-19 study. Finally, statistical high-frequency research drugs can provide more treatment options and evidence-based evidence for the clinical practice. author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020. author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https: //doi.org/10.1101 //doi.org/10. /2020 author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https: //doi.org/10.1101 //doi.org/10. /2020 author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10. 1101 /2020 author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10. 1101 /2020 author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the ."}
