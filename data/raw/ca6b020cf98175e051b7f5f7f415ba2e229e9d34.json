{"title": "RAT CORONAVIRUS", "body": "The biology of rat coronaviruses is still relatively simple for several reasons: 1) There do not seem to be many viruses in this group; 2) they all appear to cause more or less the same type of infection; 3) they are relatively hard to grow \u00b1n_ vitro; 4) little is known about their molecular properties.\n\nNevertheless, coronavirus infection is common in laboratory rats and to scientists who rely on rats for their research, they are a genuine nuisance.\n\nParker, Cross and Rowe (1) made first isolation of a coronavirus from rats; a virus they recovered from lung while looking for the cause of seroconversion in Fischer rats to mouse hepatitis virus.\n\nTheir isolate has been designated rat coronavirus (RCV).\n\nBhatt, Percy and Jonas (2) identified a second isolate from the salivary glands of rats with sialodacyroadenitis; a common syndrome of laboratory rats that was described a decade earlier by Innes and Stanton (3) and linked to a viral etiology by Jonas and coworkers (4) in the late 1960s.\n\nBhatt's isolate was designated sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV) strain 681.\n\nRecently a third coronavirus was recovered from inflammed salivary glands of rats in Japan by Maru and Sato (5) . They call it the causative agent of rat sialoadenitis (CARS).\n\nAlthough it shares physicochemical and antigenic properties with RCV and SDAV, its tropism for cultured cells, as described below, differs from RCV and SDAV.\n\nAlthough RCV, SDAV and CARS can be separated by some criteria, the similarities among them strongly outweigh the differences (TABLE I) and suggest they may merely be strains of a prototype virus. This possibility is strengthened by reports that show the physicochemical and antigenic properties of several coronaviruses isolated from naturally affected rats closely resemble those of SDAV (6, 7) . Rat coronaviruses are all moderate-sized, enveloped viruses with coronavirus morphology.\n\nThey do not tolerate heat or lipid solvents, but resist inactivation in acidic media. They share antigens with each other and also with some strains of mouse hepatitis virus, but cross-reactive antigens among rodent coronaviruses were detected initially with multivalent antisera, so the specificity and location of epitopes recognized by these sera remain undefined. Cross neutralization tests indicate that virus neutralizing antibody reacts with the homologous strain of rat coronavirus better than with heterologous strains (2) . This result suggests that antigenic differences occur among isolates. There is no published data as to whether rat coronaviruses share antigens with other mammalian coronaviruses or with avian coronaviruses.\n\nAvailable evidence suggests that rat coronaviruses do not share antigens with other families of mammalian viruses (2) .\n\nPrimary rat kidney (PRK) cells are the only cells known to support \u00b1n_ vitro replication of RCV and SDAV (1, 2) . Viral antigen can be detected in infected cultures by 12 hours and by 24 hours characteristic multinucleate syncytia form.\n\nNevertheless this requirement for primary cells makes viral isolation and propagation a cumbersome task. CARS, by contrast, does not grow in PRK cells, but does grow in 3T3 cells, a continuous line derived form BALB/c mice (5) . Cytopathic effects in 3T3 cells consisted of multinucleate syncytia and focal degeneration that were not detected until day 14 and progressed slowly thereafter, If this finding is \n\nUnderstanding of the infections caused by these viruses is on firmer ground although the clinical and morphological severity of natural infections can vary among animals from a given colony and among outbreaks in different vivariums (8-12).\n\nThere have been only a few attempts to assess the influence on expression of infection of virus-related factors such as virulence and of host-related factors such as age, strain, and immunological status (1,2,7,13,3, 14-16).\n\nFurthermore, strains of rat coronavirus may differ in tissue tropism. When SDAV-681 and RCV are compared, for example, both viruses replicate in the respiratory tract but SDAV seems to infect the salivary and lacrimal glands more severely (15,16).\n\nWith these caveats in mind I've chosen a commonly recognized example, sialodacryoadenitis (SDA), to illustrate the pathogenesis of rat coronavirus infection. This brief review of SDA is based on reports of natural epizootics and on experiments performed in our laboratory. A more extensive review has also been published (15).\n\nSDA is highly infectious, but deaths from uncomplicated infection are rare.\n\nParker and others (1) found that Fischer rats inoculated with RCV within 48 hours postpartum developed lethal pneumonia, but deaths among sucklings are not prominent in natural outbreaks.\n\nAttack rats during epizootics are high. Signs can persist in a colony for several weeks, but for individual rats clinical disease is usually present for about one week.\n\nCharacteristic signs include sneezing, photophobia, swelling of the neck, and nasal and ocular discharges that stain adjacent skin reddish-brown.\n\nSome rats, however, develop chronic keratoconjunctivitis (18,19). Affected animals can have corneal opacities, ulcers, pannus, synechia, hypopyon, hyphema and even cataracts.\n\nOther clinical changes attributed to SDA include weight loss and reduced litter size or reduced reproductive performance (10-12).\n\nThe last mentioned effect may be associated with irregularities of the estrus cycle. All of these effects seem to be transient, lasting several days to several weeks.\n\nSneezing during SDA is caused by acute rhinitis, staining of periorbital and perinasal skin is caused by the copious release of prophyrin pigment from necrotic, inflammed Harderian lacrimal glands although other lacrimal glands also are affected, and swelling of the neck is due to enlarged, necrotic, inflammed salivary glands, enlarged cervical lymph nodes and cervical edema. If the spread of virus is followed during experimentally induced infection, the distribution of lesions can be easily explained (15). Virus enters the upper respiratory tract and replicates first in nasal respiratory epithelium and then in tracheobronchial epithelium.\n\nYoung rats may develop transient interstitial pneumonia, but virus replication in pulmonary alveoli is not extensive. Virus spreads from the respiratory tract to the salivary glands where it first attacks the major excretory ducts and then the acinar parenchyma. Finally, it effaces the intraorbital and exorbital lacrimal glands.\n\nAcute infection is accompanied by a transient leukopenia (13) and by sharp increases in serum amylase levels (14) due to necrosis and inflammation of the salivary glands.\n\nThe eye lesions, which may begin during acute infection, are thought to be caused by corneal drying (keratitis sicca) secondary to a reduction or loss of tear production by compromised lacrimal glands. Virus has not been detected in the cornea or in other parts of the globe.\n\nNecrosis and inflammation during SDA is self-limiting and reparable.\n\nThis fortunate outcome is due to two factors:\n\n1) Rats eliminate infectious virus in about one week, a phase that ends with seroconversions, and 2) glandular basement membranes are not destroyed and serve as a framework for cell repair. Acinar repair is characterized by regenerative hyperplasia whereas ducts undergo transient squamous metaplasia.\n\nSquamous metaplasia in the Harderian gland can be particularly prominent. Complete anatomical reconstitution takes two to four weeks except in rats that develop chronic kearatoconjunctivitis.\n\nHarderian glands occasionally endure mild fibrosis or persistent interstitial foci of mononuclear cells. Segmental peribronchial lymphoid hyperplasia, also has been observed in convalescent rats. This change is compatible with antigenic stimulation of the lung during acute infection.\n\nThe duration of pulmonary changes is unknown.\n\nRat coronavirus infection is characterized by high morbidity and low mortality. Naturally occurring epizootics among susceptible rats are usually expressed by the sudden onset of clinical signs that spread rapidly through a colony.\n\nIf susceptible animals are added to an infected colony either by parturition or by precurement, they will probably contract and perpetuate infection.\n\nExperiments have shown, for example, that susceptible rats seroconvert to SDAV if they are in contact with SDVA-infection, but not thereafter (8).\n\nLaboratory mice have been experimentally infected with SDAV by intranasal inoculation (20), but there is no evidence that rat coronaviruses are natural pathogens for mice.\n\nHost range studies for other species have not been reported. Clinical disease in individual rats lasts about one week.\n\nLesions develop rapidly and can be severe, but recovery, which is marked by seroconversions and loss of infectivity, is also rapid and is usually complete, except for a small percentage of animals (typically less than 10%) that may develop chronic eye disease.\n\nThe diagnosis of rat coronavirus infection is relatively simple.\n\nClinical signs are helpful if they are prominent. Excessive secretion of porphyrin pigment (chromodachryorrhea) and cervical swelling, high morbidity and low mortality are not combined in other known diseases of rats. Rat coronavirus infection is the only recognized cause of the major lesion, acute, necrotizing sialodacryoadenitis. It is important to remember, however, that lesion patterns can vary from animal to animal so it is prudent to examine both partners of paired organs. Chromodacryorrhea per se is not pathognomonic because it can occur in rats with chronic respiratory disease.\n\nIt also is worthwhile noting that interstitial mononuclear cell infiltrates can occur in rats following blood collection from the periorbital plexus (21) .\n\nThis lesion should not be confused with residual inflammation from SDA infection.\n\nClinical Signs FM^^^mM ~ Figure 1 . A schematic chronology of sialodacryoadenitis.\n\nVirus isolation can be attempted using PRK (or potentially for some virus strains by using 3T3 cells). The most useful tissue for isolation is the submaxillary salivary gland collected during the height of clinical disease (days 4-5), although nasal washes, lung, Harderian gland, exorbital lacrimal gland and parotid gland are also acceptable sources of infectious virus.\n\nA suitable and less costly alternative is to stain acute phase lesions for viral antigen by an immunohistochemical technique such as immunofluorescence of immunoperoxidase staining.\n\nThese procedures can be performed retrospectively on fixed, paraffinembedded tissues.\n\nHyperimmune anticoronaviral serum or ascitic fluid for immunohistochemistry should be produced in specific pathogen-free rodents (22) .\n\nRat coronavirus infection is often first detected by serology.\n\nSeroconverions found by any of four currently available tests is good evidence that infection has occurred.\n\nTrue, coronaviral antigens of rats and mice can cross-react (1,2) and, true, rats can be experimentally infected with mouse hepatitis virus (23), but the potential for confusion in interpreting serological results is small because mouse coronaviruses have not been incriminated as natural pathogens for rats.\n\nOf the four serological tests, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (3) and the immunofluorescence assay (IFA) (21) -relatively new entries -seem to be sensitive, specific and easy to perform. The complement-fixation (CF) test (1,2) is still useful for routine applications as long as careful attention is paid to test conditions. Complement concentrations of 1.5 and 1.8 units are adequate. Two or more units of complement may cause false negative reactions.\n\nIncreased concentrations of antigen (16 to 32 units) provide results than the standard concentration of four units.\n\nVirus neutralization (VN) also is highly specific, but it is labor intensive and, therefore too costly for routine application.\n\nTherefore one should be cautious about using the CF test alone to provide historical evidence of rat coronavirus infection unless testing is carried out at frequent intervals. Conversely, detection of elevated CF titers suggests that infection is either in progress or that it had occurred recently. The duration of ELISA and IFA titers after a single exposure to SDAV has not been established.\n\nRegardless of which diagnostic procedure is employed, the safest course for verifying SDA infection is to use them in combination\u00b7 If clinical signs give the initial clue to infection, they should be confirmed by pathology and serology.\n\nIf infection is discovered by seroconversion, it should be confirmed by clinical observation and certainly by pathology.\n\nIf lesions are found first, then serological confirmation of infection should be obtained.\n\nIt is, of course, always helpful to localize the causative agent to lesions by immunohistochemistry or virus isolation.\n\nThe impact of rat coronavirus infection on research is a matter for individual evaluation in light of specific research objectives, but it is easy to see from the foregoing descriptions how clinical and pathological effects of infection can lead to interference. Reduced food consumption, weight loss, reduced breeding performance (11,12), necrotic and inflammatory lesions (3,4,15) and chronic ocular disease (18,19) can all occur during rat coronavirus infection.\n\nPotential risks from infection must also be considered.\n\nRats with acute rhinitis, enlarged salivary glands and cervical edema are not good candidates for general anesthesia.\n\nThe possibility that rat coronavirus infection may lower thresholds for other respiratory pathogens has not been specifically tested, but the demonstrated ability for Sendai virus infection to increase susceptibility of mice to Mycoplasma pulmonis infection gives indirect support for this concept (25) . Rats subject to any of the forementioned problems may be unsuited for toxicological studies and protocols for such work should account for potential interference from rat coronaviruses. Interference may be particularly troublesome to ophthalmologic studies. The degree of pain and discomfort incurred by rats during infection is hard to measure. Weight loss and reduced reproductive efficiency could be taken as indirect evidence that such effects occur.\n\nPrinciples for the control and prevention of virus infections in rodents are discussed elsewhere in this text and also are covered in recent reviews (15, 26) . Reemphasis of a few concepts specifically for dealing with rat coronavirus infections may be helpful. These concepts are based on the fact that the infections are highly contagious, selflimiting and non-lethal and that most recovered rats are suitable for research. First, quarantine will usually stop on outbreak.\n\nQuarantine means \u03a0\u038c entry of new animals either by purchase or breeding, optimally for four to six weeks.\n\nSecond, because infection is non-lethal and immuogenic, promoting spread of virus among quarantined rats can accelerate immunization by natural infection and shorten the time that virus is present in a colony. Third, before a colony is released from quarantine it can be tested for freedom from infection by placing susceptible sentinel animals in holding rooms for two weeks. If infection has been eliminated, sentinels should remain free of clinical signs and should not seroconvert\u00b7 Alternatively, one can sample rats in the colony for seroconversion.\n\nIf the prevalence of seropositive animals is 100 percent based on a sample size with confidence limits of at least 95 percent (27) , then the likelihood of residual infection in the colony is remote. Nevertheless extension of the quarantine period for a week after a high prevalence of seroconversion has been obtained will provide an additional margin of safety.\n\nPrinciples for prevention of coronavirus infection should be self-evident.\n\nThe barrier to infection should begin at the vendor.\n\nUnfortunately it is sometimes difficult to rule out that inadvertent infection has occurred at a commercial breeding laboratory or during transport even if animals are shipped in boxes fitted with filters.\n\nFor animal resources that can afford the time, space and labor -nominally resources where the stakes from infection are suitably high -quarantine of new arrivals for at least a week coupled with daily physical observation is a prudent step.\n\nThe role of housing and husbandry in preventing spread of infection should not be underplayed, because coronaviruses are probably transmitted by air. Traffic patterns, room service schedules, sanitation procedures for equipment and personnel, control of feral rodents, and soundness of ventilation systems all must be evaluated. These prinicples are also discussed in several recent reviews (26, 27) and in the chapter presented by Dr. Small in this text.\n\nGiven the relatively primitive state of knowledge about rat coronaviruses, there are many avenues for further study. Lack of a convenient system for in vitro cultivation has, probably more than any other single factor, inhibited a worthy look at the molecular biology of these agents. The 3T3 cell line may offer opportunities for molecular study of at least one strain of virus, but would not improve changes for large scale propagation of RCV or SDAV. If conditions to grow adequate amounts of virus are established, then dissection of biochemical and replicative pathways could ostensibly be modeled along lines used to characterize mouse coronaviruses (28) .\n\nAmong the first priorities for such studies would be characterization of viral glycoproteins. Coronaviral peplomeric proteins, in particular, have been associated with key immunological receptor and fusion functions (28) (29) (30) (31) .\n\nMonoclonal antibodies have been used successfully to define structural and functional properties of peplomeric glycoproteins for mouse hepatitis virus (28) and could be of similar value for rodent coronaviruses. Such studies may also help to explain the tropism of rat coronaviruses for salivary and lacrimal glands and why virus attacks epithelium of serous glands and excretory ducts, but not of mucous glands (15).\n\nWe assume that rat coronaviruses enter through the respiratory tract (15), but their mode and route for dissemination to target tissues is unknown. Viremia has not been detected nor has retrograde infection of excretory ducts leading from the oro-nasopharynx to salivary and lacrimal glands (15). Nevertheless when one considers the variability in distribution of viral antigen and lesions during acute infection and the differences in tissue tropism observed between SDAV and RCV during experimentally induced infection, a closer look at pathways for direct extension from the mouth and nose to adrenal glands may be warranted.\n\nThere is some information about the effects of temperature on survival of rat coronaviruses outside the host (1, 2, 5) .\n\nThey can be transmitted by contact (8) and it is assumed that they are carried by air currents. But how long they survive under varying natural conditions of temperature and relative humidity or how far they can travel and still retain infectivity remains unknown.\n\nHost responses to rat coronaviruses, except for descriptions for clinical signs, lesions and serological response, are not well studied.\n\nConsider just a few unanswered questions: (1) Do the antibodies detected in routine serological tests for rat coronaviruses have a significant biological role in the cure and prevention of infection? The recent finding that rats immunosuppressed with cyclophosphamide recover from SDA in the absence of seroconversions should heighten interest in this question (13). (2) Is there a role for cellular immunity or local humoral immunity in recovery from coronavirus infection considering the fact that large numbers of mononuclear cells infiltrate coronaviral lesions. (3) How long does protective immunity last? To my knowledge, there is not published data to verify the duration of immunity among rats recovered from coronavirus infection.\n\nThe oral history of rat coronavirus infection, as communicated in informal discussion, implies that re-infection of rats may occur.\n\nIf re-infection can be confirmed experimentally, then management and surveillance practices, especially for longterm holding, would have to be reevaluated.\n\n(4) Do non-immunological factors influence the course or severity of infection? Virus-related and host-related factors that may contribute to variability in signs and lesions such as virulence, dose or length of exposure, age, strain and lesions have not been studied systematically.\n\nImmunization strategies, have not been developed for rat coronavirus infections except for premeditated mixing of naturally infected animals or intranasal inoculation of rats with live virus. From a cost benefit perspective perhaps nothing more is required for most colonies. However for longterm studies or for teratology or ophthalmology studies access to vaccine may take some ingenuity, but development of avirulent mutant strains of rat coronavirus (or perhaps using mutant mouse hepatitis viruses that are already available) (32) may be feasible for this purpose. The immunizing capabilities of inactivated virus or immunogenic coronaviral glycoproteins, also should be evaluated.\n\nFinally, there are the eye lesions. Two reports about keratoconjunctivitis associated with SDA deal with Lewis (18) and SHR (19) rats, but it is premature to assume that host strain influences susceptibility. Attempts to produce the eye lesions experimentally in Lewis rats have not been successful (31) .\n\nRat coronavirus infection seems to share at least one property with Mark Twain's weather -everyone talks about it, but not much is done about it. To control the weather would, of course, be hubris. To master the biology of rat coronaviruses would be good scientific, ethical and economic sense. Infect. Immun. 18: 823-827."}
