{"title": "Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 Risk for Frontline Health Care Workers", "body": "On the basis of early estimates of antibody positivity to pandemic influenza virus in the community, we assumed 20% infection rates in clinical staff and 10% rates in nonclinical staff. We calculated that 438 participants were required to achieve 80% power to detect this difference using a 0.05 two-tailed significance level. The primary outcome was the presence of a positive antibody titer in the first serum sample, indicating likely pandemic influenza infection.\n\nWe performed 2 separate univariate and multivariate analyses to delineate putative risk and protective factors (1 included all participants and the other included clinical participants only) to investigate any association between health care\u2013specific risk factors and pandemic influenza. Multivariate analysis was performed by using forward and backward stepwise logistic regression, including all variables in the model initially and a p value for removal of 0.1 and for entry of 0.2. Data were analyzed by using StataIC10 (StataCorp., College Station, TX, USA).\n\nOf the 395 participants, 140 (35%) reported a respiratory illness and 46 had nose swabs taken. Seven were positive for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus by PCR, 1 for subtype H3N2 influenza, and 38 were negative. One of the 46 had 2 swabs taken during different illnesses; the first was positive and the second was negative for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus. PCR cycle threshold values for swab specimens were from 30 to 40, indicating low viral loads. This finding may indicate that poor swabbing techniques were used, that the sample had been taken as infection was waning, or that level of infection was low (data not shown).\n\nFor 87 participants, a second serum sample was taken because of a reported respiratory illness. The average number of days between the first and second sample was 60 days (range 28 to 122 days, median 54) days. Thirty-six participants who had nose swabs performed also had a second serum sample taken. Seroconversion occurred in only 1/87 workers, with an initial titer of <10 and a subsequent titer of 40 (76 days later). This participant had a nose swab taken during a respiratory infection, which was negative for influenza virus. Seroconversion did not occur in any of the participants with a positive nose swab specimen. The mean number of days from obtaining a positive nose swab specimen to the second serum sample was 44 days (actual number: 14, 21, 27, 43, 45, 114 days). One participant with a positive nose swab sample did not have a second serum sample taken. None of the participants with a positive nose swab or seroconversion reported taking NIs in their weekly survey.\n\nFour of the 7 participants with a positive PCR result and the 1 in whom seroconversion occurred were in the clinical group (3 doctors, 1 pharmacist, 1 nurse, 1 physiotherapist). The participant who showed seroconversion was 29 years of age; participants with a positive PCR result ranged from 24\u201363 years of age. Two of the participants with a positive PCR result worked on the infectious disease ward, 2 in the emergency department, and 1 in the intensive care unit; seroconversion occurred in the participant who worked in a medical ward. Five of the participants with positive PCR results and the participant in whom seroconversion occurred had received the 2009 and previous seasonal influenza vaccines. None of the participants with confirmed influenza reported taking oseltamivir for either prophylaxis or treatment.\n\nIn total, 395 participants completed 1\u201313 weekly questionnaires each. Eighty-nine clinical and 51 nonclinical participants reported 139 and 91 respiratory illnesses, respectively. No participant reported having laboratory-confirmed pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza. Six reported community contact with someone who had laboratory-confirmed infection. One reported taking oseltamivir after contact with an infected person in the workplace. This person had 2 serum samples taken 88 days apart; both had an antibody titer of <10.\n\nIn this study, we evaluated the risk for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in HCWs compared with the risk for such infection in a control group, as well as the factors associated with infection. HCWs had slightly higher rates of seropositivity than nonclinical staff; however, this difference was not statistically significant. Our data are supported by results of another recent study, which found that being a HCW was not a risk factor for serologically confirmed seasonal influenza virus infection and that the risk of HCWs acquiring influenza was more strongly associated with household than workplace exposure (12). That study found a seroconversion rate of 11.2% in HCWs and 10.3% in non-HCWs. However, it examined only doctors and nurses, whereas our study included other types of frontline HCWs. Another study reported a seroprevalence for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 of 26.7% in HCWs, which was not significantly different from the seroprevalence of the general population (13). Neither of these studies examined use of PPE.\n\nOverall, we found that 17.7% of participants had serologic evidence of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection after the peak of the outbreak. This proportion reflects the observed 16% seroprevalence in adults in Melbourne (14). These rates are lower, however, than the 31.7% antibody positivity found in South Australia during a prelicensure study of pandemic influenza vaccine in July 2009, which excluded subjects with confirmed or suspected pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza (15). This difference in titers may have reflected geographic differences in infection rates or differences between the populations sampled.\n\nIn the analysis of all participants, we found that older age was associated with lower rates of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza infection. We did not observe higher levels of preexisting antibodies against pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza with increasing age, which has previously been reported. However, results of other studies examining the relationship between seroprevalence and increasing age are conflicting (15\u201318). Immune mechanisms other than type-specific antibodies may be providing protection for older participants. Other possibilities are that older persons have older children who may be less likely to acquire or transmit influenza or that older participants were more conscientious with respiratory etiquette and hand hygiene; attempts to measure these factors were not included in this study.\n\nAmong the HCWs we studied, working at hospital 2 conferred protection against pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection. This hospital was in a geographic area with fewer cases than the others, but if this were the explanation, then a similar finding might have been expected in the nonclinical group, which was not demonstrated. Furthermore, at least as many cases of confirmed pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza were seen at hospital 2 as were seen at the other hospitals (Table 1). Factors such as reported compliance with PPE, were adjusted for in the multivariable analysis to reduce the effect of hospital type on influenza risk. The reason for the lower risk associated with hospital 2 has not been identified but may relate to other unmeasured factors, such as compliance with hand hygiene procedures.\n\nWearing gloves while caring for patients as part of droplet precautions was strongly associated with a lower risk of having had pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection. Use of gloves was highly correlated with use of gowns, masks, and eye protection on logistic regression (results not shown). This finding confirms the great importance of PPE in preventing transmission of respiratory viruses in the health care setting and may explain why HCWs with definite exposure to influenza in the workplace, in addition to probable exposure in the community, do not have higher rates of infection than those with only community exposure.\n\nThe risk for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection increased with the number of children <18 years of age living in the participant\u2019s household, which has previously been reported as a risk factor (12). In Victoria, the median age of persons with reported pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection was 15 years, with 67% of all notified case-patients being 5\u201317 years of age (1). Miller et al. also found that children were predominantly infected (17). This finding, coupled with the difficulties of maintaining good respiratory etiquette in young children, is a plausible explanation for the effect of child number on infection risk.\n\nWorking in the ICU was also identified as a risk factor for pandemic influenza; patients in ICU may be severely ill, with high viral loads, and staff may be heavily exposed during multiple aerosol-generating procedures. In addition, use of PPE and hand hygiene compliance may have been lower than in other wards or patients with pandemic influenza may have been unrecognized and therefore appropriate PPE not used.\n\nExposure of HCWs to suspected or proven pandemic influenza in the community was protective against having a positive antibody test result. This finding is counterintuitive and difficult to explain. One hypothesis is that HCWs who knew that they had had community exposure may have been more attentive to hand hygiene and other infection control precautions while at work or were more likely to enact social distancing.\n\nWe found only 1 instance of seroconversion among the 87 participants (including the 6 with PCR-confirmed infection), each of whom had 2 serum samples taken for antibody measurement. Miller et al. reported that 89.1% of participants with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 had an antibody titer of >32 three weeks after infection, although a baseline serum sample was not taken; therefore, seroconversion could not be demonstrated (17). None of the participants with positive PCR results reported taking NIs, and all had serum samples taken >2 weeks after the positive nose swab specimen, allowing sufficient time for seroconversion. Our results are likely to be true positives, as all swabs were only taken when patients were symptomatic. Previously, virus isolation has been the gold standard for influenza detection but RT-PCR is now considered to be more sensitive and specific. A previous study by some of the current authors has shown that seroconversion occurs in 80%\u201390% of serum samples if they are tested a sufficient time after infection (confirmed by RT-PCR) (19). Nasal swabs are a relatively peripheral type of sample (20). If viral load is low in the nose, the sample may be insufficient as an antigenic stimulus to induce a detectable level of seroconversion in the serum. This may be the explanation for the lack of seroconversion seen in some PCR-positive cases in this study.\n\nBecause the number of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 cases in Victoria was low by the time this study commenced, we used a single antibody measurement for diagnosis in most patients. This is not ideal, because some participants may have had preexisting cross-reactive antibodies, as reported by others (15,16). However, this cross-reactivity has been most commonly found in older persons >65 years of age, a population which was underrepresented in our study. The explanation given for presence of cross-reactive antibodies in older persons has been past exposure to other antigenically similar viruses or a lifetime exposure to influenza A virus (17). Because this exposure could not have occurred in our younger study participants (median age 38 years) and serum samples were collected toward the end of the pandemic wave when many would have already been exposed, reactivity likely was specific to pandemic (H1N1) 2009. These factors support the use of a single antibody measurement for diagnosis.\n\nThis study relied on self-reported symptoms and risk factors, including use of PPE, making it subject to recall bias. This is a particular problem potentially for recall of exposures (e.g., to others with influenza or for use of PPE). However, many of the predictor variables were not subject to recall bias (e.g., clinical or nonclinical status, work place, age, gender, occupation, and number of children in the household). In addition, in order to influence the results, the 2 exposure groups would have had to exhibit differential recall. Although it could be postulated that HCWs may have perceived that they were at greater risk for exposure and may have therefore been more conscientious when filling out questionnaires, we believe that because of the large amount of public awareness of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 at that time, it is unlikely that this group would have been more conscientious than the nonclinical group.\n\nIn conclusion, we found that HCWs did not have a substantially increased risk of contracting pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in a health care setting with high availability of PPE. We conclude that use of PPE was highly protective against acquiring pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection, and we therefore encourage its use, along with scrupulous hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette."}
