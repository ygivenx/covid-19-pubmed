{"title": "Structural basis for human coronavirus attachment to sialic acid receptors", "body": "Coronaviruses are large, positive-sense enveloped RNA viruses in the Nidovirales order and are divided in four genera: \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 and \u03b4. Two \u03b2-coronaviruses have caused outbreaks of deadly pneumonia in humans since the beginning of the 21st century. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in 2002 and was responsible for an epidemic that spread to five continents with a fatality rate of 10% before being contained in 2003 (with additional cases reported in 2004). The Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in the Arabian Peninsula in 2012 and has caused recurrent outbreaks in humans with a fatality rate of 35%. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are zoonotic viruses that crossed the species barrier using bats/palm civets1 and dromedary camels2, respectively. Four other coronaviruses of zoonotic origin are endemic in the human population, accounting for up to 30% of mild respiratory tract infections and also causing severe complications or fatalities in young children, the elderly or immunocompromised individuals3,4. These viruses are HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E (\u03b1-coronaviruses) as well as HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 (\u03b2-coronaviruses). Currently, no specific antiviral treatments or vaccines are available to combat any human coronavirus. Furthermore, future cross-species transmission events of coronaviruses seem likely given the large reservoir found in bats5\u20137. Studying coronaviruses will therefore help in understanding the principles governing cross-species transmission and adaptation to humans as well as in preparing for putative future zoonotic outbreaks.\n\nCoronaviruses use homotrimers of the spike (S) glycoprotein to promote host attachment and fusion of the viral and cellular membranes for entry. S is the main antigen present at the viral surface and is the target of neutralizing antibodies during infection. As a result, it is a focus of vaccine design. S is a class I viral fusion protein synthesized as a single polypeptide chain precursor of about 1,300 amino acids8. For many coronaviruses, S is processed by host proteases to generate two subunits, designated S1 and S2, which remain non-covalently bound in the prefusion conformation. The N-terminal S1 subunit comprises four \u03b2-rich domains, designated A, B, C and D, with domain A or B acting as receptor-binding domains in different coronaviruses. The transmembrane C-terminal S2 subunit is the metastable spring-loaded fusion machinery9. During entry, S2 is further proteolytically cleaved at the S2\u2019 site, immediately upstream the fusion peptide10. This second cleavage step occurs for all coronaviruses and is believed to activate the protein for membrane fusion which takes place via irreversible conformational changes11\u201314. In recent years, cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) work led to the determination of coronavirus S glycoprotein ectodomain structures in the prefusion and postfusion states, providing snapshots of the start and end points of the fusion reaction9,13,15\u201324. CryoEM structures of the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV S glycoproteins in complex with human neutralizing antibodies also informed about the mechanism of fusion activation25.\n\nHCoV-OC43 was isolated for the first time in 1967 from volunteers at the Common Cold Unit in Salisbury, United Kingdom. Molecular clock analysis of genome sequences suggested HCoV-OC43 originated from a zoonotic transmission event of a bovine coronavirus (BCoV) and dated their most recent common ancestor between the 1890\u2019s and the 1950\u2019s26,27. HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, BCoV and porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) use 9-O-acetyl-sialic acid (9-O-Ac-Sia) as a receptor, which is terminally linked to oligosaccharides decorating glycoproteins and gangliosides at the host cell surface28,29. The S glycoprotein of these viruses mediates 9-O-Ac-Sia binding whereas the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein acts as receptor-destroying enzyme, via sialate-O-acetyl-esterase activity, to facilitate release of viral progeny from infected cells and escape from attachment to non-permissive host cells or decoys30\u201333. These properties are shared with the hemagglutinin-fusion-esterase (HEF) glycoproteins of influenza C and D viruses28,34\u201336.\n\nSialic acids are ubiquitous terminal residues of glycoconjugates and occur in a wide variety as a result of modifications of the core N-acetyl neuraminic acid molecule and of differences in glycosidic linkages37\u201339. Previous biochemical work established that domain A of coronavirus S glycoproteins mediates attachment to oligosaccharide receptors, such as for HCoV-OC43 and BCoV, which interact with 9-O-Ac-Sia28,40,41, or MERS-CoV, which binds to \u03b12,3-linked (and to a lesser extent to \u03b12,6-linked) sialic acids, with sulfated sialyl-Lewis X being the preferred binder42. Based on the galectin-like fold of domain A of coronavirus S and mutational analyses, it was suggested key saccharide-binding residues locate to the viral membrane distal side of the BCoV \u03b2-sandwich. Our recent work, however, indicated the 9-O-Ac-Sia binding-site of HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, BCoV and PHEV is conserved among these viruses and resides at a distinct location of domain A43. Although we validated the findings using mutagenesis and BCoV infectivity assays, no structural information is available about the mechanism of coronavirus interaction with saccharides besides in silico modeling43. This knowledge gap limits our understanding of the roles of these receptors in viral infection or zoonosis and hinders the rational design of inhibitors.\n\nTo understand attachment of coronaviruses to sialic acids at the surface of host cells, we determined cryoEM structures of a stabilized HCoV-OC43 S glycoprotein trimer in isolation and in complex with 5-N-acetyl,9-O-acetyl-neuraminic acid \u03b1-methyl glycoside (9-O-Ac-Me-Sia) at 2.9 \u00c5 and 2.8 \u00c5 resolution, respectively. We demonstrate the ligand binds with fast association/dissociation kinetics in a groove on HCoV-OC43 S located at the surface of domain A of HCoV-OC43 S. Site-directed mutagenesis combined with binding experiments validated our structural findings and infectivity assays demonstrated the residues involved in 9-O-Ac-Sia binding are essential for HCoV-OC43 S-mediated entry into host cells. Our results further show binding to free 9-O-Ac-Me-Sia and/or acidic pH did not induce fusogenic conformational changes of S, suggesting multivalent interactions with sialoglycans and/or further attachment to a putative proteinaceous receptor44 are essential to promote membrane fusion. The receptor-interacting site is conserved in all coronavirus S glycoproteins known to attach to 9-O-Ac-sialoglycans and shares architectural similarity with the ligand-binding pockets of coronavirus HEs and influenza virus C/D HEF glycoproteins, highlighting common structural principles of recognition45,46.\n\nWe determined a 2.9 \u00c5 resolution cryoEM reconstruction of an apo-HCoV-OC43 S ectodomain trimer mutant in which the S1/S2 furin cleavage site was abrogated in order to prevent proteolytic processing during biogenesis. HCoV-OC43 S folds as a 150 \u00c5 high and 130 \u00c5 wide compact trimer (Fig. 1 a, Fig. S1 a\u2013b and Table 1). The S1 subunit has a \u2018V\u2019 shape architecture resulting from the 3D arrangement of its four domains (A, B, C and D), similarly to other \u03b2-coronavirus S structures9,17\u201324. The S2 subunit, which is more conserved than the S1 subunit among coronaviruses, folds as a mostly helical, elongated trimeric unit with a connector domain appended at its C-terminal end9,16 (Fig. 1 a). Among available coronavirus S glycoprotein structures, HCoV-OC43 S is most similar to mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) S9 (4.7 \u00c5 r.m.s.d over 979 aligned C\u03b1 positions) and to HCoV-HKU1 S18 (4.5 \u00c5 r.m.s.d over 949 aligned C\u03b1 positions), with which it shares 62% and 68% sequence identity, respectively. The cryoEM reconstruction resolves 14 N-linked glycans extending from the surface of each protomer. The HCoV-OC43 S oligosaccharide density is comparable to that of SARS-CoV S and MERS-CoV S, with all three viruses belonging to the \u03b2-genus, but lower than the glycan density of the porcine deltacoronavirus S (\u03b4-genus) or the HCoV-NL63 S (\u03b1-genus) glycoproteins16,17,47.\n\nDomain B displays the highest variability within S1 subunits across coronaviruses, which correlates with the ability of different viruses to interact with distinct host receptors. For \u03b2-coronaviruses, the canonical architecture of the domain B comprises a conserved five-stranded anti-parallel \u03b2-sheet, decorated with \u03b1-helices on both sides, and a highly variable external subdomain which can mediate receptor engagement for SARS-CoV19,48 or MERS-CoV49 for instance. Domain B of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 are structurally similar and can be superimposed with an r.m.s.d of 1.0 \u00c5 over 251 aligned C\u03b1 positions50, with differences largely restricted to the external subdomain (Fig 1 b). The current consensus in the field is that HCoV-OC43 S does not rely on other receptors than 9-O-Ac-sialoglycans for promoting viral entry into host cells. In contrast to the MERS-CoV S and SARS-CoV S glycoproteins19\u201321,23,47,51, where domain B adopts alternative conformations, we detected a single closed conformation of domain B in the HCoV-OC43 S structure (Fig. 1 a). Only the closed domain B conformation was also observed for the MHV S9, HCoV-NL63 S16, HCoV-HKU1 S18, PDCoV S17,24 and IBV S22 glycoprotein structures.\n\nHCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, BCoV and PHEV attach to the surface of target cells by binding to 9-O-Ac-sialoglycans28,29. To directly visualize the binding site and characterize the molecular details of the interactions, we incubated the HCoV-OC43 S protein with 100 mM 9-O-Ac-Me-Sia, prior to vitrification and cryoEM data collection. We determined a 3D reconstruction of the stabilized HCoV-OC43 S protein in complex with its receptor at 2.8 \u00c5 resolution, hereafter referred to as holo-HCoV-OC43 S (Fig. S1 c\u2013d and Table 1). The resolution estimate is supported by the visible ordered water molecules interacting with the S glycoprotein, as expected at this resolution52. The structure reveals the ligand interacts with a groove at the periphery of domain A, in agreement with the biochemical observations reported by Hulswit et al43 (Fig. 2 a\u2013c). The receptor therefore docks into a completely distinct groove than the ones used by either human galectin-353 or the rhesus rotavirus sialic acid-attachment protein54 (VP8*) to recognize their respective ligands (Fig. S2 a\u2013c).\n\nThe sialoside-interacting groove defines two hydrophobic pockets, designated P1 and P2 (according to the nomenclature defined by Hulswit et al43), which are separated by the Trp90 indole side chain, and is delineated by two loops forming the rims of the binding site, termed L1 (Asn27-Asp-Lys-Asp-Thr-Gly32) and L2 (Leu80-Lys-Gly-Ser-Val-Leu-Leu86) (Fig. 2 c). The 9-O-Ac-Me-Sia C1-carboxylate forms a salt bridge with the Lys81 side chain amine and a hydrogen bond with the Ser83 side chain hydroxyl (Fig. 2 c and Fig S3). The 5-nitrogen atom of the ligand is hydrogen-bonded to the Lys81 backbone carbonyl (Fig. 2 c). The ligand N-acetyl methyl inserts into the P2 hydrophobic pocket, defined by residues Leu80, Trp90 and Phe95. The ligand 9-O-acetyl methyl docks in the P1 hydrophobic pocket, which comprises Leu85, Leu86 and Trp90 whereas the 9-O-acetyl carbonyl is hydrogen-bonded to the Asn27 side chain amide. These observations rationalize the specificity of HCoV-OC43 S for this sialoside since the 9-O-acetyl group is accommodated by a combination of hydrogen-bonding and shape complementarity (Fig. 2 b\u2013c), similarly to 9-O-Ac-Sia binding sites of coronaviruses, toroviruses and orthomyxoviruses HE/HEF32\u201335,43,55. Although most interactions occur with the same side of the ligand, the side chain hydroxyl of residue Thr31, which faces the 9-O-Ac-Me-Sia solvent-exposed side, forms a hydrogen bond with the Trp90 indole nitrogen. This interaction participates in stapling the A domain N-terminal segment to the \u03b2-sandwich core and contributes to defining the shape of the ligand-binding groove (Fig. 2 c). Overall, the ligand buries 350 \u00c52 of its surface upon binding to the HCoV-OC43 S protein, corresponding to approximately 62% of the 9-O-Ac-Me-Sia total solvent-accessible surface area. The observed binding mode is compatible with interactions with longer oligosaccharides, including \u03b12,3- and \u03b12,6-linked sialoglycans found on cell surfaces.\n\nTo characterize the binding kinetics and affinity of an individual HCoV-OC43 S binding site for 9-O-Ac-Sia receptors, we recombinantly produced the monomeric HCoV-OC43 S domain A and used biolayer interferometry to analyze its attachment to biotinylated oligosaccharides immobilized on the surface of streptavidin-coated biosensors. Domain A bound to and dissociated from 6-sialyl-5-N,9-O-acetyl-lactosamine (9-O-Ac-6SLN) with very fast on and off rates. (Fig. 3 a). The observed binding was specific since it was critically dependent on the presence of the sialate-9-O-acetyl moiety, in accordance with previous observations28,32,43,56. Indeed, domain A did not detectably bind to the corresponding non-O-acetylated oligosaccharide, 6SLN. This is explained by the absence of the 9-O-acetyl moiety in 6SLN which contributes a third of the total ligand buried surface area by contacting Asn27 and the P1 pocket of the glycoprotein, as revealed in our structure (Fig. 2 b\u2013c). Moreover, binding was largely abolished by de-O-acetylation of biosensor-bound 9-O-Ac-6SLN with porcine torovirus HE (Fig. 3 a). Finally, substitution of Trp90 with alanine abrogated interactions with 9-O-Ac-6SLN (Fig. 3 a), thereby confirming the central role for sialoside attachment of this amino acid residue that defines the floor of the ligand-binding groove43.\n\nUsing steady-state analysis, we determined an equilibrium dissociation constant KD=49.7 +/\u2212 10.7 \u03bcM for the HCoV-OC43 domain A/9-O-Ac-6SLN complex (Fig. 3 b\u2013c). We calculated a half-life of T1/2=0.7 s from the dissociation curves, a dissociation rate constant koff=1 s\u22121 (koff=T1/2/ln2), and an association rate constant kon=1.4 \u00d7 104 M\u22121 s\u22121. These values predict rapid S-mediated virion attachment, particularly in high-density receptor environments such as the mucus layer, glycocalyx and cell surfaces. Based on these results, the mean life (1/koff) of the 1:1 complex is predicted be very short, in the order of 1 s. This is much shorter than the mean life of an individual influenza A hemaglutinin receptor-binding domain in complex with sialic acid, which ranges between 7 and 13.5 s57. In the context of authentic virions, however, the large number of S glycoproteins at the surface of coronaviruses is likely to increase the apparent binding affinity for sialoglycans through avidity, as described for influenza virus58. We posit that HCoV-OC43 and related \u03b2-coronavirus S glycoproteins evolved to dynamically interact with host sialosides and avoid irreversible attachment to decoy receptors via HE-mediated virion elution. Dynamic binding in combination with receptor-destruction could promote virion motility by directional sliding diffusion through high-density interaction sites, as recently reported for influenza A and C viruses59\u201361.\n\nOur structure rationalizes the results of our previous study in which the effect of individual HCoV-OC43 S domain A substitutions was assessed using a solid-phase lectin binding assay43. Substitution of Lys81 or Ser83 with alanine completely abrogated binding, as expected based on our holo-HCoV-OC43 S structure, due to disruption of the aforementioned electrostatic interactions with 9-O-Ac-Sia. Moreover, mutations of Leu80, Leu86 or Trp90 also disrupted binding, most likely as a result of alteration of the P1 and/or P2 hydrophobic pockets accommodating the ligand 9-O-acetyl and 5-N-acetyl methyl groups, respectively. Based on our structure, we predicted that substitution of Asn27 with alanine would also inhibit binding due to loss of a hydrogen-bond between the ligand 9-O-acetyl carbonyl and the Asn27 side chain amide. Using the same solid-phase lectin-interaction assays, we demonstrate this substitution resulted in loss of detectable binding, further validating our cryoEM results (Fig. 3 d).\n\nWe subsequently evaluated the importance of the identified interactions for HCoV-OC43 S-mediated infectivity using pseudotyped G-deficient vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-\u0394G). Substitutions at positions Asn27, Thr31, Leu80, Lys81, Ser83, Leu86 and Trp90 led to complete abrogation of viral entry (Fig. 3 e\u2013f), in agreement with our structural data, biolayer interferometry and solid-phase lectin-binding assays as well as the literature43. These findings (i) support the importance of the identified residues for interacting with 9-O-Ac-Sia in the context of a full-length, membrane-embedded, HCoV-OC43 S glycoprotein and (ii) indicate that attachment to oligosaccharide receptors using the binding site visualized by cryoEM plays a critical role in promoting HCoV-OC43 S-mediated viral entry.\n\nComparison of the stabilized apo- and holo-HCoV-OC43 S glycoprotein structures did not reveal conformational rearrangements upon binding to 9-O-Ac-Sia (the two structures can be superimposed with a C\u03b1 r.m.s.d of 0.2 \u00c5). To validate this finding, we investigated the effect of ligand binding to wild-type HCoV-OC43 S (i.e. with a native S1/S2 cleavage site sequence) in various biochemical conditions. Importantly, the HCoV-OC43 S ectodomain trimer remained uncleaved after secretion (Fig. S4 a), perhaps due to the paucity of furin present in the secretory pathway of HEK293F cells62. Incubation of the wild-type HCoV-OC43 S ectodomain trimer with trypsin at concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 28 \u03bcg.mL\u22121 (w/v), to recapitulate proteolytic priming13, led to cleavage at the S1/S2 boundary, as observed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. S4 a). Incubation with 28 \u03bcg.mL\u22121 trypsin also led to cleavage of a small fraction of S at a second site, yielding a band with an apparent molecular weight of ~55 kDa which could be consistent with cleavage at the S2\u2019 site (Fig. S4 a), an event believed to be restricted to fusion triggering upon receptor engagement for SARS-CoV S11 or MERS-CoV S12,63. EM analysis of negatively stained samples, however, showed that the HCoV-OC43 S trimers remained in the prefusion conformation and were highly stable even at the highest trypsin concentration tested (Fig. S4 b). Furthermore, we did not detect conformational changes (i) of pre-cleaved wild-type HCoV-OC43 S incubated with 100mM 9-O-Ac-Me-Sia, (ii) after trypsin cleavage of 9-O-Ac-Me-Sia-bound wild-type HCoV-OC43 S or (iii) of pre-cleaved wild-type HCoV-OC43 S incubated at pH 4.5 (Fig. S4 c\u2013f). Therefore, 9-O-Ac-Me-Sia binding or pH acidification of the medium, such as the one occurring in the endosomal compartment, did not trigger HCoV-OC43 S fusogenic conformational changes.\n\nTo evaluate the ability of our purified glycoprotein construct to undergo fusogenic conformational changes, we incubated the pre-cleaved wild-type HCoV-OC43 S ectodomain at 50\u00b0C for 25 min in absence or presence of isopropanol (used to dissolve the trypsin inhibitor added to stop the proteolytic reaction) Fig. S4 g\u2013h. In the former conditions, we noticed the formation of HCoV-OC43 S rosettes arising from the non-specific interactions of multiple postfusion trimers via the hydrophobic fusion peptides Fig. S4 h. These biochemical conditions lowered the energy barrier between the metastable prefusion state and the postfusion (ground) state, acting as a surrogate for receptor-mediated fusion activation. This indicated the wild-type HCoV-OC43 S ectodomain trimer could refold to the postfusion conformation although free 9-O-Ac-Me-Sia or pH acidification did not trigger this transition. It was previously established caveolin-mediated endocytosis is a major route of HCoV-OC43 entry into host cells64. Since we demonstrated interactions of sialoglycans with the identified site are necessary for S-mediated viral entry, we hypothesize that membrane fusion occurs upon formation of multivalent interactions with sialoglycans (via mechanical destabilization of the prefusion trimers) and/or binding to a putative proteinaceous receptor44, before or after virus internalization. In conclusion, 9-O-Ac-Sia-containing receptors appear to differ from the proteinaceous SARS-CoV receptor, as addition of monomeric angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ectodomain to wild-type SARS-CoV S trimers, in the presence of trypsin, promoted refolding to the postfusion state23,47.\n\nHCoV-OC43, BCoV, PHEV and HCoV-HKU1 are the four coronaviruses known to engage 9-O-Ac-Sia-capped sialoglycans to initiate infection of target cells. The A domain of their S glycoproteins share strikingly similar structures which can be superimposed with a C\u03b1 r.m.s.d. comprised between 0.8 and 2.0 \u00c5 (Fig. S5 a\u2013d).\n\nVirtually all residues participating in interactions with 9-O-Ac-Me-Sia or the formation of the binding groove are conserved in BCoV S and PHEV S, such as Asn27, Leu80, Lys81, Leu85, Leu86, Trp90, Phe95 and Thr31 (Fig. 4 a\u2013c). Ser83HCoV-OC43, however, is substituted with Thr83BCoV/PHEV and both side chains are expected to form a hydrogen bond with the C1-carboxylate of the ligand (Fig. 4 a\u2013c). These findings and the abrogation of BCoV and PHEV domain A-mediated hemagglutination of rat erythrocytes upon substituting Lys81/Thr83 or Trp90 with alanine43 indicate these two viruses interact with 9-O-Ac-Sia in an identical manner to HCoV-OC43 S. The binding pocket appears to be compatible with recognition of 9-O-Ac-Sia and of 9-O-acetyl-glycolyl-neuraminic acid. Although the latter saccharide is not found in humans, it is present at the termini of oligosaccharides decorating other mammalian and avian glycoproteins and glycolipids, and could be a receptor for BCoV and PHEV.\n\nMany of the ligand-interacting residues or residues indirectly involved in formation of the recognition site identified in the holo-HCoV-OC43 S structure are also strictly conserved in HCoV-HKU1 S, such as Asn26HCoV-HKU1 (Asn27HCoV-OC43), Leu79HCoV-HKU1 (Leu80HCoV-OC43), Lys80HCoV-HKU1 (Lys81HCoV-OC43), Leu85HCoV-HKU1 (Leu86HCoV-OC43), Trp89HCoV-HKU1 (Trp90HCoV-OC43) and Phe94HCoV-HKU1 (Phe95HCoV-HKU1) (Fig. 4 a,d), suggesting that HCoV-HKU1 S interacts with 9-O-Ac-sialoglycans using the same binding site as the one identified for HCoV-OC43 S. This hypothesis is supported by site-directed mutagenesis experiments showing that substitution of Lys80HCoV-HKU1, Thr82HCoV-HKU1 (Ser83HCoV-OC43) or Trp89HCoV-HKU1 with alanine abrogated HCoV-HKU1 domain A-mediated hemagglutination of rat erythrocytes43.\n\nOur results show all coronaviruses recognizing host cell 9-O-Ac-sialoglycans share a conserved binding pocket and bind to the ligand via virtually identical interactions. Strikingly, BCoV HE and influenza HEF similarly interact with 9-O-Ac-Sia despite ample differences in the architecture of their ligand-binding pockets33,34,43. Specifically, the two methyl groups of the ligand are docked into two hydrophobic depressions separated by an aromatic amino acid side chain, and hydrogen bonds are formed with the 5-nitrogen of the neuraminic acid core and the 9-O-acetyl carbonyl (Fig. 5 a\u2013c). The similarity across the three binding sites is reinforced by the observation that 9-O-Ac-Sia buries a comparable surface area at the interface with each of these glycoproteins and that the 9-O-acetyl moiety makes a major contribution to it in all three cases (~110 \u00c52). One notable difference, however, is that the C1 carboxylate anchors the ligand to HCoV-OC43 S via a salt bridge and a hydrogen bond whereas it relies on the formation of one or two hydrogen-bonds with the BCoV HE or influenza HEF lectin domains, respectively. These results expand on our previous biochemical work43 to demonstrate BCoV HE and influenza HEF use similar structural principles to other 9-O-Ac-sialoglycan-recognizing human and animal coronaviruses for engagement to host cell receptors.\n\nWe structurally identified and characterized with unprecedented detail the HCoV-OC43 S sialoglycan-binding site, which is located in a groove at the surface of domain A. This site is conserved in all other coronaviruses known to attach to 9-O-Ac-Sia including HCoV-HKU1 S, which is another endemic human coronavirus, or BCoV S, the presumptive zoonotic ancestor of HCoV-OC43. Our results provide a molecular framework explaining the specific recognition of 9-O-Ac-Sia-decorated oligosaccharides present at the surface of host cells targeted by these viruses. The \u03b2-sandwich architecture of domain A is conserved among all coronaviruses and some of them feature a duplication of this domain at the S glycoprotein N-terminal region16. Other coronaviruses like MERS-CoV (\u03b2-coronavirus), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV, \u03b3-coronavirus), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (\u03b1-coronavirus) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (\u03b1-coronavirus) have been described to also bind to sialoglycans (distinct from 9-O-Ac-sialosides) via their A domains during host cell infection42,65\u201367. The ligand-binding pocket identified in the holo-HCoV-OC43 S structure is not conserved in the MERS-CoV42 nor in the IBV A domains, for which structures are available, suggesting host attachment of this subset of viruses involve different interactions. The conserved topology of domain A among coronavirus S glycoproteins indicate it derived from divergent evolution of an ancestral galectin domain. Viral evolution and adaptation thus lead to the use of distinct binding-residues on the same domain putatively to acquire different ligand specificities such as 9-O-Ac-sialosides versus non-O-acetylated-sialoglycans. This evolutionary plasticity is reminiscent of what has been described for the BCoV HE lectin domain in comparison to influenza A/B hemagglutinin and influenza C/D HEF33,35.\n\nSialic acids cap numerous oligosaccharides found at the surface of eukaryotic cells and constitute an important class of receptors for several human pathogens35,37,38. Modulation of attachment to sialoglycans can therefore have profound effects on zoonotic transmission, tropism and virulence of many viruses. For instance, a single point mutation in the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus hemagglutinin was proposed to account for most of the preference switch from avian enteric tract receptors (\u03b12,3-linked sialic acid) to human respiratory tract receptors (\u03b12,6-linked sialic acid)58. Although influenza A/B hemagglutinin, influenza C/D HEF and coronavirus HE have distinct architectures compared to coronavirus S glycoproteins, common rules of ligand engagement emerge. These rules also appear to extend to the interactions of sialoglycans with adenoviruses68 and reoviruses69. In all cases, sialic acid binding involves burying a small surface area (300\u2013400 \u00c52) through contacts with a solvent-exposed groove of the protein. One face of the sialic acid ligand makes extensive interactions with the viral proteins, whereas the opposite, solvent-exposed face, makes few contacts. The binding affinity for sialic acids usually ranges between the micromolar and millimolar range and the aforementioned viruses display numerous oligomeric spikes to enhance adsorption to target receptors through avidity58.\n\nDespite these similarities, marked differences in the 3D organization of the binding sites explain the selectivity of different viruses for unmodified or modified sialic acids. The ligand-binding sites of BCoV HE, influenza HEF and a subset of coronavirus S glycoproteins have evolved to specifically recognize 9-O-Ac-Sia via hydrogen bonding with the 9-O-acetyl carbonyl moiety and formation of a hydrophobic pocket accommodating the 9-O-acetyl methyl32\u201334,43,55. In contrast, influenza hemagglutinin cannot accommodate 9-O-acetylated neuraminic acids due to steric restrictions, but a subset of hemagglutinins can bind to N-glycolyl neuraminic acids58,70. The HCoV-OC43 S, HCoV-HKU1 S, BCoV S and PHEV S glycoproteins therefore share the ligand specificity of influenza C/D HEF but are functionally more similar to influenza A/B hemagglutinin, by carrying receptor attachment and membrane fusion functions whereas a dedicated HE (coronaviruses) or neuraminidase (influenza A/B) is responsible for the receptor-destroying activity. To conclude, our results illuminate how coronaviruses recognize 9-O-Ac-sialosides to enable infection of susceptible cells and show a conserved strategy is utilized to engage such ligands across coronaviruses and orthomyxoviruses.\n\nThe fragment encoding the HCoV-OC43 S ectodomain (residues 15 to 1263, UniProtKB: Q696P8) was amplified by (RT-)PCR from the viral genome and placed into a modified pCAGGS mammalian expression vector with a CD5 N-terminal signal peptide (MPMGSLQPLATLYLLGMLVASVLA) and an engineered C-terminal extension encoding a GCN4 trimerization motif (IKRMKQIEDKIEEIESKQKKIENEIARIKKIK), an underlined thrombin cleavage site (LVPRGSLE), an 8-residue long Strep-Tag (WSHPQFEK) followed by a stop codon, as previously described9,15\u201317. This construct results in fusing the GCN4 trimerization motif in register with the HR2 helix at the C-terminal end of the HCoV-OC43 S-encoding ectodomain sequence. A mutant gene carrying three R to G amino acid mutations to abolish the furin cleavage (754-RRSRG-758 -> 754-GGSGG-758) at the S1-S2 junction (S2 cleavage site) was also generated following the same strategy. A pCAGGS vector encoding the HCoV-OC43 S domain A (residues 1\u2013306) C-terminally extended with a thrombin cleavage site followed by the Fc region of human IgG was generated as described before71.\n\nHEK293F cells were grown in suspension using FreeStyle 293 Expression Medium (Life technologies) at 37\u00b0C in a humidified 8% CO2 incubator rotating at 130 r.p.m. Wild-type or mutants HCoV-OC43 S ectodomain construct were transfected into 250 mL cultures with cells grown to a density of 1 million per mL using 293fectin (ThermoFisher Scientific). After four days, supernatant were collected and cells were kept in culture for additional four days, yielding two harvests per transfection. Recombinant wild-type or mutant HCoV-OC43 S ectodomain were purified from clarified supernatants using a 1 mL StrepTrap column (GE Healthcare). Purified proteins were concentrated and flash frozen in Tris-saline buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl) prior to negative staining and cryoEM analysis.\n\nProtein samples were adsorbed to glow-discharged carbon-coated copper grids for 30 seconds prior to 2% uranyl formate staining. Micrographs were recorded using the Leginon software72 on a 120kV FEI Tecnai G2 Spirit with a Gatan Ultrascan 4000 CCD camera at 67,000 nominal magnification. The defocus ranged from 1.0 to 2.0 \u03bcm and the pixel size was 1.6 \u00c5.\n\nWild-type HCoV-OC43 S ectodomain trimer at 1 mg.mL\u22121 (6.6 \u03bcM spike monomer) was digested or not with trypsin at 14 \u03bcg.mL\u22121 for 30 min at room temperature after which 1.5 mM PMSF was added to stop the reaction. The samples were subsequently incubated: 1) overnight at 4\u00b0C with 100 mM 9-O-Ac-Sia, 2) 25 min at 50\u00b0C or 3) 30 min at pH 4.5 using 20 mM Na-citrate buffer before being analyzed by negative staining EM and SDS-PAGE.\n\nThree microliters of HCoV-OC43 S at 1 mg.mL\u22121 were applied to a 2/2 C-flat grid (Protochips), which had been glow-discharged for 30 s at 20 mA. After observing preferential orientation, 2.7 \u03bcl of HCoV-OC43 S at 10 mg.mL\u22121 were mixed with 0.3 \u03bcl of n-Octyl-\u03b2-D-Glucopyranoside (OG) 180 mM immediately before being applied to a glow-discharged grid. Thereafter, grids were plunge-frozen in liquid ethane using an FEI Mark IV Vitrobot with 6.5\u20137.5 s blot time at 100% humidity and 20\u00b0C. Incubation of 1.1 \u03bcM HCoV-OC43 S with 100 mM 9-O-acetylated sialic acid (9-O-Ac-Sia) was performed overnight at 4\u00b0C and immediately before vitrification, OG was added to the mixture reaction at a final concentration of 18 mM. Data were acquired using an FEI Titan Krios transmission electron microscope operated at 300 kV and equipped with a Gatan K2 Summit direct detector and Gatan Quantum GIF energy filter, operated in zero-loss mode with a slit width of 20 eV. Automated data collection was carried out using Leginon72 at a nominal magnification of 130,000 x with a pixel size of 0.525 \u00c5 for apo-HCoV-OC43 S (super-resolution mode) and 1.05 \u00c5 for holo-HCoV-OC43 S (counted mode). The dose rate was adjusted to 8 counts/pixel/s, and each movie was acquired in mode fractionated in 50 (apo) or 60 (holo) frames of 200 ms. 2,211 and 2,402 micrographs were respectively collected for apo- and holo-HCoV-OC43 S with a defocus range comprised between 1.3 and 1.8 \u03bcm.\n\nMovie frame alignment, estimation of the microscope contrast-transfer function parameters, particle picking and extraction were carried out using Warp73. Particle images were extracted with a box size of 800 binned to 400 for apo-HCoV-OC43 S or with a box size of 400 for holo-HCoV-OC43 S both yielding a pixel size of 1.05 \u00c5. Reference free 2D classification in Relion was used to parse particles from the original 197,791 and 332,912 for apo and holo-HCoV-OC43 S, respectively. The MHV S cryoEM map9 was used to generate an initial model of apo-HCoV-OC43 S. The initial model of holo-HCoV-OC43 S was generated using the apo-HCoV-OC43 S map. Relion 3D classification without symmetry was utilized to select ~83,000 and ~178,000 particles from apo- and holo-HCoV-OC43 S, respectively. CTF refinement in Relion3.074 was used to refine per-particle defocus values. Particle images were subjected to the Bayesian polishing procedure implemented in Relion3.074,75 before performing another round of per-particle defocus refinement. The particles were then subjected to 3D classification without refining angles and shifts using the same soft mask as used during 3D refinement and with a tau value of 30. Final 3D refinement of the apo- and holo-HCoV-OC43 S datasets imposing C3 symmetry was carried out using non-uniform refinement in cryoSPARC76 and yielded reconstructions at 2.9 and 2.8 \u00c5 resolution, respectively. Local resolution estimation, filtering and sharpening was carried out using CryoSPARC. Reported resolutions are based on the gold-standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC) of 0.143 criterion77 and Fourier shell correlation curves were corrected for the effects of soft masking by high-resolution noise substitution78.\n\nUCSF Chimera79 and Coot80 were used to fit the MHV atomic model (PDB 3JCL) into the holo-HCoV-OC43 S cryoEM map. The models were subsequently manually rebuilt using Coot80. N-linked glycans were hand-built into the density where visible and the models were rebuilt and refined using Rosetta81\u201384. Models were analyzed using MolProbity85, Privateer86 and PISA87. Figures were generated using UCSF Chimera79 and ChimeraX88. Analysis of the ligand-binding site electrostatic surface potential was performed using PDB2PQR89 and APBS90.\n\nHCoV-OC43 S1A-Fc was expressed in HEK293T cells and purified from the cell culture supernatant by protein A chromatography, as described43. Monomeric domain A, wildtype or with a W90A substitution, was subsequently obtained by on-the bead thrombin cleavage33 after which the proteins were concentrated to up to 3.8 mg.mL\u22121 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), aliquoted and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until further use. BLI analysis was performed on an Octet RED384 machine. All assays were performed using Fortebio Kinetics Buffer (KB; PBS supplemented with 0.1% BSA, 0.02% Tween20 and 0.05% sodium azide) at 30\u00b0C. Synthetic biotinylated 6-sialyl-5-N-,9-O-acetyl-lactosamine (9OAc6SLN) or 6-sialyl-5-N-acetyl-lactosamine (6SLN) dissolved to 100 nM were loaded on streptavidin (SA) bio-sensors to maximum loading levels (i.e. until no further increase in reflection was observed). Sensors were washed in KB until a stable baseline was obtained. Binding of monomeric HCoV-OC43 S domain A was performed by moving receptor-loaded sensors to wells containing 100 \u03bcl of purified protein, dissolved in KB to various concentrations, for up to 3 min, followed by a 3 min dissociation step. To abolish unspecific binding, sensors were subjected to five successive association/dissociation cycles. To test whether binding of domain A was sialate-9-O-acetyl-dependent, biosensors loaded with 9OAc6SLN were de-O-acetylated by dipping them in wells containing 20 \u03bcg.mL\u22121 porcine torovirus P4 HE-Fc45 in KB for 30 min, followed by a washing step, prior to association/dissociation (pre-HE) or after a cycle of association/dissociation upon which the biosensors were subjected to a final cycle (post-HE). The equilibrium dissociation constant KD was determined from three independent experiments with the \u2018Response\u2019 option of the Octet Data Analysis software. The half-life of the domain A-9OAc6SLN complex was calculated manually from the dissociation curves.\n\nHCoV-OC43 S pseudotyped VSV-\u0394G particles were prepared as previously described43. Briefly, HEK 293T cells at 70% confluency were transfected with PEI-complexed plasmid DNA. For co-expression of HCoV-OC43 S and BCoV HE-Fc, S expression vectors and pCD5-BCoV HE-Fc were mixed at molar ratios of 8:1. At 48 h after transfection, cells were transduced with VSV-G\u2013pseudotyped VSV\u0394G/Fluc91 at a multiplicity of infection of 1. Cell-free supernatants were harvested at 24 h after transduction, filtered through 0.45-\u03bcm membranes, and virus particles were purified and concentrated by sucrose cushion ultracentrifugation at approximately 100,000 \u00d7 g for 3 h. Pelleted virions were resuspended in PBS and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until further use. Inoculation of HRT18 monolayers in 96-well format was performed with equal amounts of S-pseudotyped virions, as calculated from VSV-N content (roughly corresponding to the yield from 2 \u00d7 105 transfected and transduced cells), diluted in 10% FBS-supplemented DMEM. At 18h post-infection, cells were lysed using passive lysis buffer (Promega). Firefly luciferase expression was measured using a firefly luciferase assay system. Infection experiments were performed independently in triplicate, each time with three technical replicates. Pseudovirus incorporation of flag-tagged OC43 S was determined for the parental type and each of the mutants by Western blotting and by calculating the S content (measured with monoclonal antibody ANTI-FLAG\u00ae M2; Sigma) relative to that of VSV-N (measured with anti-VSV N monoclonal antibody 10G4; Kerafast)."}
