{"title": "Development of a Rapid Automated Influenza A, Influenza B, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus A/B Multiplex Real-Time RT-PCR Assay and Its Use during the 2009 H1N1 Swine-Origin Influenza Virus Epidemic in Milwaukee, Wisconsin", "body": "Tissue culture had been the gold standard for respiratory virus diagnosis until approximately the mid-1990s when large multiplex RT-PCR assays first became available clinically and commercially. 1-7 RT-PCR was quickly shown to be significantly more sensitive and highly specific for the detection of influenza (Flu) and respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV) (and most other respiratory viruses as well). Since that time, many laboratories (including the Midwest Respiratory Virus Program) have worked to develop automated platforms that would encompass nucleic acid extraction, RT-PCR amplification, and detection 8 -11 . The goals have been to decrease technician time to only a few minutes, to make the assay time only 2 to 3 hours (or faster), to decrease cost, and to keep the footprint of the equipment as small as possible. In early 2008, two multiplex RT-PCR assays received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance for the detection of Flu A, Flu B, and RSV A/B. xTAG RVP (Luminex Molecular Diagnostics, Toronto, ON, Canada) is capable of detecting 9 viruses and a combined 11 subtypes for 3 of these viruses. 12 This is an open format assay, which increases the chance for contamination, and requires approximately 8 hours for completion and the use of a Luminex flow cytometer. The second FDA-approved multiplex RT-PCR assay is the ProFlu\u03e9 Assay (Prodesse, Waukesha, WI), which is capable of detecting Flu A, Flu B, and RSV simultaneously. The assay takes approximately 3 hours, excluding extraction time, and as approved, is semiautomated: using automated extraction via the NucliSENS easyMAG System (bioM\u00e9 rieux, Durham, NC) or the MagNA Pure LC Instrument (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) followed by manual transfer for real-time thermocycling on a Smart Cycler II (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA). In addition to these multiplex tests, the FDA, in September 2008, approved a series of singleplex RT-PCR assays developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that are capable of typing Flu viruses as A or B and further subtyping Flu A viruses as H1, H3, or H5 subtypes. However, the reagents are only readily available to members of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Laboratory Response Network. 13 The dearth of FDA-approved Flu A, Flu B, and RSV assays has led a number of laboratories to develop their own \"in-house\" singleplex or multiplex semiautomated assays using commercial automated extractors, real-time thermocyclers, and research use-only reagents. Our laboratory has recently developed semiautomated and fully automated multiplex RT-PCR assays capable of detecting Flu A, Flu B, and RSV A/B with a noncompetitive RNA internal control (MS2 RNA phage, ZeptoMetrix Corp., Buffalo, NY). The semiautomated assay uses the Nu-cliSENS easyMAG System for automated nucleic acid extraction and a rapid microfluidics-based real-time thermocycler (Raider, HandyLab Inc., Ann Arbor, MI) for amplification and detection. The fully automated assay is run on the Jaguar (HandyLab, Inc.), which performs automated extraction followed by amplification and detection on a similar microfluidics-based real-time thermocycler. These platforms were chosen because they have an open format, which allows laboratories to run their own assays while maintaining high throughput with minimal hands-on technician time.\n\nThe assays were designed with Pleiades probes, which use modified bases for selecting specific melt temperatures and a minor groove binder (Epoch Biosciences, Inc., Bothell, WA). 14 Although this chemistry is similar to that of previously described Epoch analyte specific reagents, 15 those reagents required modification to perform optimally on the easyMAG/Raider platform. After optimization in the semiautomated system, the assay was adapted to the completely automated Jaguar system. On completion of analytical development, both assays were compared with tissue culture, an in-house RT-PCR-enzyme hybridization assay, and the FDA-approved ProFlu\u03e9 assay to determine specificity and sensitivity before routine use in our clinical laboratory.\n\nBeginning in March 2009, infections caused by a novel influenza virus [H1N1 swine origin influenza virus (S-OIV)] began to be recognized around the world. 16,17 On April 28, 2009, our laboratory detected and confirmed (April 29) the first patient with the novel Flu A S-OIV in the state of Wisconsin. The lack of knowledge concerning this new strain as well as public and medical concern over an apparently unprotected population led to many public health decisions that increased the number of patients and physicians seeking specific viral diagnostic information in a rapid time frame. We describe the use of this rapid, fully automated Flu A, Flu B, and RSV assay/system in testing large numbers of patient specimens over a very short time period during the ongoing S-OIV outbreak. This outbreak demonstrates the importance of having rapid, reliable, sensitive, and specific assays that allow clinicians and public health officials to react quickly and effectively during viral outbreaks.\n\nPrimers and probes were designed to highly conserved regions of the Flu A and Flu B matrix genes (M) and the RSV polymerase gene (L) and the bacteriophage MS2 A protein gene (internal control) ( Table 1 ). The probes for Flu A, Flu B, and RSV were labeled with the fluorescent dye FAM, and the MS2 probe was labeled with AP-593 (Epoch Biosciences, Inc.). Primer, probe, and assay design was performed in our laboratory. Many primer/ probe designs were obtained using the Influenza Primer Design Resource and are described in further detail in Bose et al 18 \n\nSamples run on the semiautomated NucliSENS easyMAG System/Raider thermocycler (easyMAG/Raider) were prepared by combining 400 l of clinical sample (or surrogate samples prepared for analytical testing, as described later) with 10 l of MS2 bacteriophage at a concentration of 1 \u03eb 10 6 plaque-forming units/ml. Samples were then combined with 1 ml of easyMAG lysis buffer, and RNA was extracted following the manufacturer's off-board lysis procedure with the generic 1.0 protocol. RNA was eluted in 25 l of elution buffer. Then 3.4 l of RNA was combined with 4.6 l of RT-PCR mix containing 2\u03eb Platinum Tfi mix, SuperScript III (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and primers/probes for all targets including the internal control and loaded into a cartridge, which was placed in a Raider thermocycler. On the Jaguar platform, 475 l of clinical sample (or surrogate samples prepared for analytical testing, as described later) was combined with 10 l (4.75 \u03eb 10 5 plaque-forming units/ml) of MS2 bacteriophage and loaded into the Jaguar sample tubes. RNA was extracted and eluted in 10 l of elution buffer and combined with 13.5 l of RT-PCR mix (as described above). Then 8 l of this mixture was transferred to one of two internal high-speed thermocyclers. All steps after sample addition proceeded in a fully automated format with sample transfer and cartridge loading occurring via a robotic arm. The final primer/probe concentrations in each platform were the same, as was the final amount of MS2/rxn (approximately 700 copies). The thermocycling parameters used in both systems were 20 minutes at 50\u00b0C (room temperature), 2 minutes at 95\u00b0C (denature), and 45 cycles of 15 seconds at 95\u00b0C, 30 seconds at 56\u00b0C, and 15 seconds at 76\u00b0C, followed by a subsequent melt analysis at 45-85\u00b0C at a rate of 0.1\u00b0C/second. This PCR protocol takes approximately 1.5 hours to run.\n\nResults were determined using a \"workbook\" (computational algorithm) in Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA) designed to convert the raw data produced by the Raider or the Jaguar to the final output format. Data were analyzed, and the tests were scored based on the amplification curves and melt profiles of the sample. Samples were considered positive if the FAM Ct value was \u054540, the amplification curve shape was appropriate, and the FAM melt profiles yielded a melting temperature (Tm) \u03ee2\u00b0C of those expected for RSV (74\u00b0C), Flu B (68\u00b0C), or Flu A (63\u00b0C) ( Figure 1A ). Samples were considered indeterminate if the FAM Ct value was \u03fe40.0 with an appropriate FAM Tm and amplification curve shape; indeterminate samples were repeated once. Samples were considered negative if the internal control (MS2) was positive (Tm of 73\u00b0C in the AP-593 channel) ( Figure  1B ) and the FAM Ct value was \u03fe40.0 with an incorrect or nonexistent Tm or an abnormal amplification curve. \n\nTwenty-three common respiratory pathogens and commensal organisms were spiked at high concentrations (\u03fe10 4 TCID 50 plaque-forming units, colony-forming units/ ml) into M4 viral transport medium. The following organisms were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas, VA) and were tested in both systems: adenovirus type 3 (ATCC VR-3), rhinovirus 1B (ATCC VR-481), coronavirus OC43 (ATCC VR-1558), herpes simplex virus type 1 (ATCC VR-1544), human parainfluenza viruses 1 (ATCC VR-94), 2 (ATCC VR-92), 3 (ATCC VR-93), and 4 (ATCC VR-1378), cytomegalovirus \n\nProFlu\u03e9 kits were purchased from the manufacturer and run according to the package insert. Clinical samples (200 l) were extracted using the easyMAG and eluted in 55 l as directed.\n\nOne hundred nasopharyngeal swab samples tested previously (and stored at \u03ea80\u00b0C in M4 viral transport medium) at the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin were determined to be positive for Flu A (n \u03ed 16), Flu B (n \u03ed 21), or RSV (n \u03ed 20) or negative (n \u03ed 43) by tissue culture. An aliquot of each sample was tested blindly in the easyMAG/Raider assay, the Jaguar assay, and the FDAapproved ProFlu\u03e9 assay. Tissue culture results were used as the true result for sensitivity and specificity calculations. However, when there was disagreement between tissue culture, easyMAG/Raider, Jaguar, or ProFlu\u03e9 assays, the RV-8 (described below) was used to resolve discordant results. Indeterminate results were excluded from sensitivity and specificity calculations.\n\nIn addition to the real-time RT-PCR assays, clinical samples were tested with an in-house large multiplex RT-PCR-enzyme hybridization assay that can simultaneously detect and type nine respiratory viruses (RV-8) including nucleoprotein gene, the PIV-2 hemagglutinin gene, the PIV-3 hemagglutinin gene, the human metapneumovirus fusion protein, and the adenovirus penton gene (primer sequences and analytical data are presented for these targets because they have no bearing on the current study). After PCR, 5 l of the reaction was probed with each of the probes according to well described protocols for RT-PCR- \n\nThe Jaguar assay has been successfully used as a screening assay since November 2008. Beginning in the last week of April 2009, 1232 specimens were tested over the first 2 weeks of the S-OIV outbreak. 27 Samples run in the Jaguar assay that tested positive for Flu A were subtyped and confirmed as Flu A (H1N1) S-OIV at the Midwest Respiratory Virus Program, Medical College of Wisconsin. 18, 28 Results\n\nThe limits of detection were 10 0 (10 0 ), 10 \u03ea2 (10 \u03ea2 ), 10 \u03ea1 (10 1 ), 10 \u03ea1 (10 \u03ea2 ), and 10 \u03ea1 (10 \u03ea1 ) TCID 50 /ml on the Jaguar and the easyMAG/Raider (in parentheses) for Flu A (H1N1), Flu A (H3N2), Flu B, RSV A, and RSV B, respectively.\n\nOf the 23 nonspecific organisms tested, only adenovirus type 3 gave a positive result (Flu A) on the easyMAG/ Raider at a concentration of 10 7 TCID 50 /ml. No dilutions below 10 7 TCID 50 /ml showed any sign of cross-reactivity. H. influenzae gave an indeterminate result on the easyMAG/Raider system at high concentrations. Crossreactivity was not seen in the Jaguar assay.\n\nThe RV-8 assay is still undergoing some slight modifications in an effort to incorporate an internal control and automate it; however, in the version used in this experiment the limits of detection are 10 1 , 10 1 , 10 2 , and 10 2 TCID 50 /ml for Flu A, Flu B, RSV A, and RSV B, respectively. In addition, no cross-reaction was seen when nonspecific organisms were probed with the Flu A, Flu B, RSV A, or RSV B probes.\n\nThe monthly coefficient of variation of the Ct for each sample run on the Jaguar platform was less than 5% each month with the exception of RSV B during December (Table 2) .\n\nThe semiautomated and fully automated Flu A, Flu B, and RSV assays described here exhibit greater sensitivity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value than the FDA-approved ProFlu\u03e9 assay (though the results are not statistically significant). All assays have the same specificity (Table 3) . Tissue culture results were used to calculate sensitivity and specificity. The RV-8 was used to resolve discordant results between the easyMAG/Raider, Jaguar, or ProFlu\u03e9 assays; however, this result was only noted for discussion and was not factored into the sensitivity and specificity calculations. Indeterminate results were excluded from sensitivity and specificity results.\n\nSens., sensitivity; CI, confidence interval; Spec., specificity; PPV, positive predictive value; NPV, negative predictive value. \n\nOf the 1232 samples screened in the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin laboratory over a 10-day period, we detected 134 Flu A-positive samples (Table 4) . 18, 28 The Jaguar assay demonstrated 100% positive agreement compared with two separate in-house validated molecular assays directed to different genetic targets but had two false-positive results (99.81% negative agreement). 18 \n\nAnalytically the semiautomated and fully automated assays described in this report are highly sensitive for Flu A, Flu B, and RSV A/B. All analytes can be detected in both platforms at concentrations of less then 10 TCID 50 /ml, which is comparable with detection seen with the ProFlu\u03e9 assay (LOD range from 10 2 to 10 \u03ea1 TCID 50 /ml). Although the LOD for most targets are equivalent on both easyMAG/ Raider and Jaguar systems, two exceptions are that the LOD of Flu B is approximately 2 log units better on the Jaguar then on the easyMAG/Raider platform and the LOD of RSV-A was 1 log unit better on the easyMAG/ Raider platform. Both assay formats are also very specific. Testing of 23 nonspecific organisms in both formats revealed that only adenovirus type 3 showed intermittent cross-reactivity in the easyMAG/Raider format at a very high concentration of 10 7 TCID 50 /ml. In addition, comparison of samples tested by tissue culture with those tested with the easyMAG/Raider, Jaguar, and ProFlu\u03e9 assays showed that all were 99% specific. The only discrepancies observed were that RSV was detected in a specimen that was negative by tissue culture. RSV was also detected in a Flu B-positive tissue culture sample, and its presence was confirmed during discrepant analysis as a dual Flu B and RSV infection. Clinical testing demonstrated that the easyMAG/Raider and Jaguar assays exhibited greater sensitivity than the ProFlu\u03e9 assay for all three analytes (although these differences are not statistically significant). Overall sensitivities of the easyMAG/ Raider and Jaguar formats were both greater than that observed for the ProFlu\u03e9 assay. Testing with these primers and probes was performed on a large number of virus isolates consisting of H1 to H15 subtypes of Flu A, Yamagata and Victoria lineages of Flu B, and A and B subtypes of RSV. In addition, at least 15 samples of each virus were collected in Milwaukee, WI, in 2008 and tested with the assay (these samples were used to calculate clinical sensitivity and specificity). Collectively, these viruses were from various hosts (for Flu A viruses), collection years (dating back to 1977 for Flu A, to 2004 for Flu B, and to 1985 for RSV), and geographic locations and showed that Tm values ranged from 62.4 to 64.1, 68.1 to 69.8, and 73.0 to 74.7 for Flu A, Flu B, and RSV, respectively. These data are not shown because although each target was tested with the same analyte-specific primers/probes at the proper concentrations, the compositions of the nonspecific primers/probes were not necessarily the same as those in the completed assay. However, during the course of our assay optimization we observed that changing any of the oligonucleotides, with the exception of the analyte-specific probe, yielded very little change in Tm for a given virus. For this reason we are confident that the Tm ranges reported above for Flu A, Flu B, and RSV viruses are highly representative of their true ranges using the finalized version of the assay described in this article. Both assay formats have rapid sample turnaround times with limited technician time. The Jaguar or easyMAG/ Raider platforms require approximately 20 or 40 minutes of technician time and can return results in 3.5 or 2.5 hours, respectively, for 24 samples. Automated multiplex assays can decrease the numbers of laboratory tests ordered per patient, the technician time used per sample, the cost per virus detected, and the overall chance for contamination. 29 -31 In addition, the Jaguar assay proved efficient in rapidly and accurately screening a large number of Flu A, Flu B, and RSV samples during the current outbreak of a novel Flu A (H1N1) virus S-OIV in Milwaukee, WI. Flu A samples were reflexed into several subtyping assays that also confirmed the Flu A typing result (including 23 Flu A-positive samples, which were confirmed as S-OIV by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's subtyping assay at the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene). These subtyping results indicated that this Flu A, Flu B, and RSV assay could successfully detect the matrix gene of all three circulating strains of Flu A (H1N1 human, H3N2 human, and H1N1 S-OIV). This outbreak demonstrates the importance of having rapid, reliable, sensitive, and specific assays that allow clinicians and public health officials to react quickly and effectively during viral outbreaks."}
