Gilchuk et al. perform structural and functional analysis of cooperativity in a cocktail of two human mAbs, recognizing major epitopes of ebolavirus glycoprotein (GP), and define cooperative binding of the GP as a mechanism for enhanced ebolavirus neutralization.\n\nHuman monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are promising therapeutic molecules that can be used for the prevention or treatment of viral infectious diseases. In recent years, advances in human B cell isolation techniques have led to the identification of large numbers of therapeutic mAb candidates against many life-threatening viral pathogens. These targets include antigenically variable viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (Sok and Burton, 2018) and influenza virus (Laursen and Wilson, 2013) , or newly emerging pathogens with high epidemic potential, including Ebola virus (Bornholdt et al., 2016) , Marburg virus (Flyak et al., 2015) , Zika virus (Sapparapu et al., 2016; Stettler et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016b) , Lassa virus (Robinson et al., 2016) , Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (Corti et al., 2016b) , poxviruses (Gilchuk et al., 2016) , Nipah virus (Geisbert et al., 2014) , and many other medically important viruses. Over 25 antiviral human mAbs are now being evaluated as human therapeutics in clinical trials (Walker and Burton, 2018) , including several for ebolavirus therapy (NIH, 2019) .\n\nAntibodies can mediate protection by direct virus neutralization and/or by engagement of innate immune cells via their Fc receptors (FcRs) (Crowe, 2017; Lu et al., 2018) . Potent neutralization, broad reactivity, and protective capacity are desirable mAb features, which could be used to select leads for development as a monotherapy or cocktail. A cocktail might offer greater efficacy and resistance to viral escape (Corti et al., 2016; Keeffe et al., 2018; Wec et al., 2019) , but the molecular and structural basis for the optimal combination of mAbs is ill-defined. Current mAb discovery approaches typically are focused on antibody variable fragment (Fv)-region-mediated biological functions of single isolated mAbs (e.g., binding and neutralization) or Fc-region-mediated effector functions (Walker and Burton, 2018) . Molecular interactions in which two or more mAbs recognize the same antigen in an enhanced (e.g., cooperative or synergistic) fashion are less well investigated, but these interactions might contribute greatly to the overall efficacy of protective cocktails (Carlsen et al., 2014; Doria-Rose et al., 2012; Howell et al., 2017; Mascola et al., 1997) . One key challenge that impedes progress in this area is that the structural determinants of cooperativity by neutralizing antibodies are poorly understood. Development of synergistic mAb cocktails against viruses with high antigenic variability, including HIV, hepatitis C, norovirus, influenza virus, or Ebola virus, is also thwarted by the fact that only a small subset of virus-specific mAbs available for incorporation in cocktails is broadly crossreactive to all field strains. Another challenge is the relatively small number of mAb combinations that can be tested iteratively for therapeutic efficacy given the high cost and labor of in vivo virus challenge studies, especially when non-human primate (NHP) large animal model testing is needed. Therefore, for the rational development of antiviral therapeutic mAb cocktails it is important to implement approaches to identify combinations of mAbs with optimized molecular interactions in formulated cocktails, along with structural and functional analysis to define features that mediate efficient protection by these mAbs.\n\nIn this study, we describe the design of a cooperative twoantibody cocktail possessing neutralizing activity against the primary ebolaviruses that are responsible for outbreaks in humans-Ebola (EBOV), Bundibugyo (BDBV), and Sudan (SUDV) viruses (Kuhn, 2017) . EBOV causes a severe disease in humans with 25% to 90% case fatality rates and significant epidemic potential. The largest epidemic to date occurred in 2013-2016 in West Africa with a total of 28,646 cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) and 11,323 deaths reported (Coltart et al., 2017) . This and the new ongoing outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) (CDC, 2019) highlighted the need to accelerate development of EVD therapeutics (Park et al., 2015; Urbanowicz et al., 2016) . The ebolavirus envelope (E) contains a single surface protein, the glycoprotein (GP), which is the major target for neutralizing mAbs (Lee and Saphire, 2009) . We conducted analysis of >1,800 human mAbs against the GP and identified two classes of broadly reactive mAbs that cooperate for binding to the GP and neutralization of the virus. High-resolution structures illuminated a mechanism of cooperativity. The two-antibody cocktail offered protection in mice against the most antigenically divergent virus SUDV and demonstrated high therapeutic efficacy against live EBOV challenge in NHPs. These findings offered a rational strategy for development of a potent two-antibody cocktail design based on structural features of mAb interactions with ebolavirus GPs.\n\nOur previous work identified two potent therapeutic candidate mAbs EBOV-515 (immunoglobulin G1 [IgG1] subclass) and EBOV-520 (IgG4 subclass) from the B cells in human survivors of EVD. Each of these mAbs binds to a conserved epitope on the base of the GP, neutralizes all three ebolaviruses causing the disease in humans (EBOV, SUDV, and BDBV), protects mice challenged with EBOV, and offers partial protection against BDBV and SUDV . This work also revealed the class of non-competing, glycan-cap-region-specific mAbs that enhance binding of EBOV-515 and EBOV-520 to the GP in a cooperative manner , suggesting a strategy for two-antibody cocktail design. Here, we screened >1,800 GP-reactive human mAbs and identified two previously described glycan-cap-specific EBOV-437 and EBOV-442 (Gilchuk et al., 2018) and one additional mAb EBOV-548 (all IgG1 originally) as suitable partners to EBOV-515 or EBOV-520 for the design of cooperative two-antibody cocktail (Figures S1A-E; Table S1 ). Partner candidate mAbs were filtered on the basis of (1) neutralizing activity against wild-type (WT) ebolavirus (EBOV at least); (2) broad reactivity to EBOV, BDBV, and SUDV GPs; (3) cooperative enhancement of EBOV-515 and EBOV-520 binding to the EBOV GP; and (4) capacity to protect against EBOV challenge in mice.\n\nBecause of the potential utility of these mAbs as components of a therapeutic cocktail, we sought to characterize in depth the cooperative effects mediated by combinations of two mAbs. As the first partner of the cocktail, we chose the most well-characterized base-region-specific mAb EBOV-520. We expressed the variable gene sequences for this mAb in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells as a recombinant IgG1-LALA Fc mutant molecule (rEBOV-520 LALA, or rEBOV-520) to diminish Fc effector function. rEBOV-520 LALA possessed the highest protective efficacy with low-dose treatment against EBOV in mice and acted principally via neutralization to protect against EBOV . The second cocktail partner, mAb EBOV-548, potently neutralized EBOV and showed the highest activity of three identified cooperative glycan-cap-specific mAbs in a cooperative binding to the GP with rEBOV-520 as a partner mAb. EBOV-548 was produced as a functionally competent IgG1 (designated here as rEBOV-548 IgG1 or rEBOV-548), because engagement of the Fc region might be important for protection by the GP glycan-cap-specific mAbs .\n\nTo assess the Fc-mediated killing of antigen-expressing cells by engineered variants of EBOV-520 and EBOV-548, we used a stably transfected EBOV-GP-expressing SNAP-tagged 293F cell line as a target and heterologous human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as a source of effector cells. The SNAP-tag is a self-labeling protein tag that allows specific labeling of a target cell line with fluorescent dye, facilitating detection of effector-cell-mediated killing activity by flow cytometry (Domi et al., 2018) . rEBOV-520 LALA showed low cytotoxic activity when compared with that of the control rEBOV-520 WT IgG1. rEBOV-548 IgG1 mediated efficient cell killing that was comparable to that of a recombinant form of a glycan-cap-directed mAb c13C6, which is included in the ZMapp TM cocktail ( Figure 1A ) (Davidson et al., 2015) . Similar functional profiles of these two mAbs were obtained using bead-or solid-phase-immobilized GP ectodomains and various human effector cells (Figures S1A and S1C). These findings confirmed the relatively high capacity of rEBOV-548 IgG1 to engage the Fc and diminished Fc function of rEBOV-520 LALA. All our next studies utilized these two Fc forms of rEBOV-520 and rEBOV-548.\n\nWe next assessed neutralizing activity of individual mAbs. rEBOV-520 potently neutralized all three ebolaviruses, whereas rEBOV-548 potently neutralized only EBOV and BDBV ( Figures  1B and S1A ). However, both mAbs were broadly reactive, as measured by binding to recombinant GP ectodomains or binding to full-length EBOV, BDBV, or SUDV GPs displayed on the surface of stably transduced Jurkat cell lines (Figures 1C, S1A, and S1B). We then tested mAb binding to each of the three Jurkat GP cell lines after treatment with thermolysin to mimic endosomal cathepsin cleavage to create a membrane-displayed cleaved GP (GP CL ). rEBOV-520 bound weakly to the intact GP but strongly to the GP CL , demonstrating a saturable doseresponse curve and $500to $1,000-fold increase in binding to the GP CL over the intact GP ( Figure 1C ). More efficient binding to the GP CL was concordant with higher neutralizing activity of EBOV-520 against the virus displaying the EBOV GP CL than the virus with the intact EBOV GP that we described in a previous A C B Figure 1 .

Viruses encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) were incubated with increasing concentrations of purified mAbs and infection was determined at 3 days after inoculation by measuring eGFP fluorescence in cells.\n\n(C) Binding of candidate mAbs to intact cell-surface-displayed EBOV GP (solid shapes) or cleaved EBOV GP CL (open shapes). Fluorescently labeled mAbs were incubated with a suspension of cells from a Jurkat cell line that was stably transduced with EBOV GP (Jurkat-EBOV GP), or the same cells treated with thermolysin to cleave GP (Jurkat-EBOV GP CL ); binding was assessed by flow cytometry. Dotted lines (black) indicate a dynamic range of mAb binding to the GP. Dashed lines show estimated curve slopes based on a constraint for saturating binding values.

(B) Binding to the Jurkat-EBOV GP was assessed by flow cytometry using Alexa Fluor 647 (AF647)-labeled mAb rEBOV-520 or rEBOV-548 alone (solid shape), or AF647-labeled mAb titrated into a fixed concentration (20 mg/mL) of unlabeled partner mAb (open shape) as indicated. Saturated binding was estimated as in Figure 1C . Effect from mAb composition was assessed by two-way ANOVA. Arrows show comparisons to estimate fold-increase in binding. (C) Concentration-dependent potentiation of GP binding by partner mAb was assessed as in (B) using a single concentration of labeled mAb alone or the same labeled mAb in the mixture with increasing concentrations of unlabeled partner mAb as indicated. Fold increase in binding to the GP is shown with numbers in orange. (D) rEBOV-548 potentiated neutralization of SUDV by rEBOV-520. Virus was incubated with increasing concentrations of rEBOV-520 alone (gray), or rEBOV-520 titrated into a sub-neutralizing concentration (20 mg/mL) of rEBOV-548 (green). Percent SUDV neutralization by rEBOV-548 alone is shown with dotted line. p value was estimated from a comparison of IC 50 values (Student's t test).\n\n(legend continued on next page) study . The glycan-cap-specific rEBOV-548 bound moderately and less efficiently to intact cell-surface-displayed GPs when compared with its binding to recombinant GPs ( Figures 1C and S1B ). Together, these results defined binding and functional features of the cocktail candidate mAbs and showed that the exposure of rEBOV-520 epitope is limited on the intact GPs of all three ebolaviruses. mAbs in the Cocktail Cooperate, Enabling Enhanced GP Binding, Virus Neutralization, and In Vivo Protection Negative stain electron microscopy (EM) analysis showed that rEBOV-520 and rEBOV-548 can bind to GPs simultaneously ( Figure 2A ). To characterize the cooperative effects of these two mAbs as a cocktail, we first assessed GP binding for each mAb in the presence or absence of the partner mAb. Fluorescently labeled rEBOV-520 or rEBOV-548 was titrated into a constant concentration of unlabeled partner mAb, as previously described , and relative fluorescence from binding of the labeled mAb to the intact cell-surface-displayed EBOV, BDBV, or SUDV GP was determined. At a constant concentration of 20 mg/mL, rEBOV-548 enhanced binding of rEBOV-520 to the GPs of all three ebolaviruses 2-to 3-fold when compared with binding of rEBOV-520 alone. The cooperativity was mediated by rEBOV-548, because rEBOV-520 had a minor effect on binding of rEBOV-548 to the GP ( Figure 2B ). Cooperative binding of rEBOV-520 to the intact homologous EBOV GP increased steadily with increased concentrations of rEBOV-548 and up to $5-fold higher than rEBOV-520 alone (Figure 2C) , indicating that a higher dose of rEBOV-548 would be necessary to leverage strong cooperative effect in a two-antibody cocktail. Binding of rEBOV-520 to the intact GP in the cocktail did not fully match the strong saturating binding of rEBOV-520 by itself to the proteolytically primed GP CL (Figure 2C) . Therefore, binding of rEBOV-548 only partially enhanced accessibility of the base epitope on the intact GP for recognition by rEBOV-520, compared with the accessibility to the epitope on GP CL . We next assessed whether cooperative binding conferred an enhanced neutralizing activity to the cocktail by using first the most antigenically divergent virus, SUDV. rEBOV-548 itself did not fully neutralize SUDV, and rEBOV-520 neutralized SUDV, but with modest potency ( Figure 1B and S1A). Consistent with the observed increase in cooperative binding of the SUDV GP ( Figure S2A ), rEBOV-548 at a sub-neutralizing concentration potentiated the neutralizing activity of rEBOV-520 against chimeric virus displaying the SUDV GP by reducing the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) value by $3-fold ( Figure 2D ). Neutralization by the cocktail was synergistic, as determined by the Chou and Talalay method that estimates the combination index (CI) to define the effect of drug combination: additive effects (CI = 1), synergism (CI < 1), and antagonism (CI >1) (Chou, 2010) . We also demonstrated synergy in neutralization of the virus with the homologous EBOV GP using the cocktail (a 1:1 mixture of rEBOV-520 and rEBOV-548) ( Figures  S2B and S2C ). Together, these data supported our finding for cooperative binding of rEBOV-520 and rEBOV-548 to the GP.\n\nWe next tested whether rEBOV-548 potentiated protection by rEBOV-520 in the cocktail against SUDV in vivo by using a stringent Stat1-deficient (Stat1 \u00c0/\u00c0 ) mouse challenge model that provides a uniform lethality (Raymond et al., 2011 ). An irrelevant mAb DENV 2D22 (IgG1 isotype) specific to the dengue virus E protein (Fibriansah et al., 2015) was used as a control. All SUDV-challenged mice that were treated with 10 mg/kg of rEBOV-548 mAb alone (which does not neutralize SUDV) on day 1 after infection succumbed to the disease by day 6 after infection, similarly to the animals in the control group. Treatment with rEBOV-520 alone delayed mortality; however, only 10% of animals survived. Treatment with the cocktail (a 1:1 mixture of rEBOV-520 and rEBOV-548) conferred higher protection, with 50% of animals surviving and an associated p value = 0.01 (Mantel-Cox test) when compared with the treatment with rEBOV-520 alone ( Figure 2E ). These results showed that rEBOV-548 complemented the activity of rEBOV-520 against SUDV in vivo. It is unknown whether protection in this model can predict protection against SUDV in NHPs.\n\nUse of antibody cocktails is attractive because this approach avoids the high risk of virus escape by this RNA virus that is inherent in monotherapy approaches. We hypothesized that the cocktail of rEBOV-520 and rEBOV-548 counteracts the escape more efficiently than individual mAbs do because each mAb possesses independent neutralizing activity (EBOV and BDBV at least) and together they exhibit an enhanced activity. We used high-throughput and quantitative real-time cell analysis assay (RTCA) that measures virus-induced cytopathic effect to screen for escape mutations in the presence of individual mAbs or the cocktail ( Figures S2D and S2E ). Recombinant vesicular stomatitis viruses (rVSVs) displaying the EBOV GP (rVSV/ EBOV GP) or SUDV GP (rVSV/SUDV GP) were incubated in the presence of increasing mAb concentrations, and we assessed neutralization in repeated passages in Vero cell monolayer cultures. Viruses escaping neutralization were assessed for susceptibility to neutralization by individual mAbs or the cocktail, and the genes encoding the GP were sequenced to confirm the presence of an escape mutation. Fifteen consecutive passages identified two rVSV/EBOV GP mutants that escaped neutralization by rEBOV-548 and one rVSV/SUDV GP mutant that escaped neutralization by rEBOV-520. Each of the mutants that we detected was selected in the presence of an individual mAb, and the mutations identified were within the predicted epitope for the respective mAb (Table S2 ). Virus escape was not detected in passages in the presence of the cocktail, as confirmed by neutralization of the late passage (E) Cooperative enhancement of protection against SUDV infection in mice by rEBOV-548. Stat1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice were inoculated with WT SUDV and treated at 1 dpi with 10 mg/kg rEBOV-520 alone, 10 mg/kg of rEBOV-548 alone, 20 mg/kg rEBOV-520/rEBOV-548 cocktail (1:1 mixture of each mAb), or mAb DENV 2D22 (control). Survival (top), combined clinical scores (middle), and combined body weights (bottom) of surviving mice are shown. Indicated groups were compared using Mantel-Cox test. A ''+'' indicates an animal found dead prior to reaching the pre-determined clinical score. Data are pooled from two to three independent experiments. Mean \u00b1 SD (n = 3) from at least two independent experiments are shown in (B)-(D). See also Figure S2 and Table S2. viruses with individual mAbs rEBOV-520 or rEBOV-548. The rVSV/EBOV GP mutants that escaped neutralization by rEBOV-548 that we isolated were neutralized fully by rEBOV-520 alone and by the cocktail, showing that if one neutralizing mAb loses activity because of a virus variant with an escape mutation, the other neutralizing mAb in the cocktail maintained activity (Table  S2) . These data strongly suggest that the use of this cocktail enhances the effective neutralizing potency of the mAbs and counteracts virus escape of the homologous EBOV. Although escape was not detected with the cocktail, the rEBOV-520 escape mutant we identified for rVSV/SUDV GP (N514Y, a conserved residue for EBOV, BDBV, and SUDV GP) was not fully neutralized by either mAb rEBOV-548 alone or by the cocktail, suggesting the possibility of escape by the heterologous SUDV.\n\nTherefore, cooperativity in GP binding by the cocktail could benefit therapeutic effectiveness by enhancing virus neutralization, enhancing in vivo protection, and reducing the risk of virus escape.\n\nThe Cocktail mAbs Recognize Relatively Conserved Epitopes of Two Major Antigenic Sites of the GP We previously reported negative stain EM reconstructions of EBOV-520 in complex with the GP . The epitope of EBOV-548 has not yet been characterized. We performed negative stain EM studies by using complexes of rEBOV-548 Fab alone or a combination of both rEBOV-548 and rEBOV-520 Fabs with recombinant trimeric EBOV GP DTM. rEBOV-548 recognized the glycan cap region and bound nearly perpendicular to the surface of the GP ( Figure 3A ), similar to the binding pose of c13C6, but also made interactions with the interior of the chalice within the outer domain of the glycan cap. c13C6, however, does not enhance rEBOV-520 binding, whereas rEBOV-548 does (data not shown).\n\nTo define key contact residues of the epitope, we used alanine scanning mutagenesis of the GP and tested the binding of rEBOV-548 to individual members of a shotgun mutagenesis alanine mutation library of the EBOV GP displayed in cells. We also generated antibody escape mutant EBOV viruses and determined their GP sequence. Mutations T240A, Y261A, R266A, T269A, T270A, I274A, and W275A reduced binding to the GP ( Figure 3B ), and escape mutation L273P reduced neutralizing potency. The key contact residues were positioned on the top of the glycan cap and within a region with relatively low sequence conservation. However, five of seven contact residues were conserved among EBOV, BDBV, and SUDV GPs (EBOV GP residues Y261 and R266 are non-conserved) that explained broad reactivity of rEBOV-548. Together, these studies identified a site of vulnerability for antibody recognition on the glycan cap that mediated cross-reactivity and cooperative binding in the cocktail of rEBOV-548 and rEBOV-520.\n\nWe next defined the structural determinants of GP binding and reactivity breadth for rEBOV-520 by resolving the crystal structure of rEBOV-520 Fab in complex with EBOV GP CL to 3.46 F resolution ( base of each protomer of GP CL , and the constant domains were oriented upward from the viral membrane ( Figure 3C ). The rE-BOV-520 footprint includes relatively conserved regions including the internal fusion loop (IFL) stem of the GP2 subunit and the hydrophobic pocket formed by five residues of the GP1 subunit and termed previously the ''3 10 '' pocket (Zhao et al., 2016; West et al., 2019) . The footprint of rEBOV-520 is distinct from that of the previously described broad human base-specific mAb ADI-15878 (Murin et al., 2018; West et al., 2018) but is similar to the footprint of the potent human-base-specific mAb ADI-15946 ( Figure 3D ), which fully neutralizes EBOV and BDBV but not SUDV (Wec et al., 2017; West et al., 2019) . Both ADI-15946 and rEBOV-520 bound to the 3 10 pocket and IFL stem regions of the fusion loop, unlike human mAb ADI-15878, which binds to the hydrophobic loop end of the structure and bridges to a neighboring GP protomer (King et al., 2019) . However, rEBOV-520 likely gained reactivity against SUDV by having a footprint slightly higher on the GP base than the ADI-15946, or a different angle of approach than that of ADI-15946, which was directed downward toward the viral membrane ( Figure 3C ), in contrast to ADI-15946, which is directed upward from the membrane (West et al., 2019) . This footprint allowed the mAb to avoid contact with the non-conserved EBOV GP residue N506 (R506 in SUDV GP) in the interface with rEBOV-520 ( Figure 3D )-a key contact residue for binding with complementarity determining region 3 of heavy chain (CDRH3) of ADI-15946 (West et al., 2019). Our findings highlighted the variability in epitopes of lead therapeutic candidate mAbs and identified rEBOV-520 as a distinct representative among the class of 3 10 pocket-targeting mAbs with an extended activity against SUDV.\n\nAnalysis of the rEBOV-520 Fab-GP CL crystal structure identified 26 GP CL residues in the interface with rEBOV-520 Fab, 16 located in GP1 (amino acid [aa] 70-78, 104, 106, 107, 134, 136, 137, and 139) and ten located in GP2 (aa 510-514, 516, 545-547, and 549). The 18-amino-acid-long CDRH3 interacted with a conformational epitope on the GP1-GP2 interface by making direct contacts with 13 GP1 (aa 70-78, 106, 107, 127, and 139) and 5 GP2 (aa 510-514) residues that are relatively conserved among EBOV, BDBV, and SUDV ( Figure S3A ). rEBOV-520 bound to the 3 10 pocket of the GP CL formed by GP1 residues 70-78 (all contacted with CDRH3) and GP2 residues 510-516 (four of seven contacted with CDRH3) that line the bottom part of the pocket ( Figure 4A ). In the unbound, full-length GP, the 3 10 pocket normally is occupied by the flexible descending b17-b18 loop of the glycan cap (GP1 residues 287-291) that impedes access to the pocket. Like ADI-15946 (West et al., 2019), rEBOV-520 either bound to a conformation of GP in which the b17-b18 loop is displaced, or actively displaced it from the pocket upon binding. The loop is not present in the GP CL , being removed by cleavage. We used hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) to compare deuterium labeling of peptides generated after digestion of the GP and GP CL with pepsin. Decrease in labeling of GP 3 10 pocket residues involved in the interface with CDRH3 confirmed limited accessibility of rEBOV-520 epitope in a structure of intact GP trimer ( Figure 4A and S3B). Cleavage removes the glycan cap with the b17-b18 loop and exposes the pocket, which explained enhanced binding of rEBOV-520 to GP CL ( Figure 1C ) and enhanced neutralization potency of this mAb against virions bearing the GP CL compared with intact GP . Previous work suggested that binding of the non-neutralizing macaque mAb FVM09 to the b17-b18 loop itself displaces the loop causing unmasking of the neutralizing epitopes for mAbs 2G4 and ADI-15946 on the GP base (Howell et al., 2017; West et al., 2019) . However, unlike with FVM09, Figure 4 . The Binding Site of rEBOV-520 Includes the 3 10 Pocket That Is Fully Exposed in GP CL but Masked by the b17-b18 Loop in Intact GP (A) An enlarged view showing occupation of the 3 10 pocket of the GP by rEBOV-520 CDRH3 residues. Ten residues of the CDRH3 tip are shown in orange cartoon. EBOV GP CL is shown in surface representation with GP1 in cyan and GP2 in yellow. The 3 10 pocket residues involved in the interface with rEBOV-520 CDRH3 and that showed a decrease in hydrogen-deuterium binding to the uncleaved GP as determined by HDX-MS, are mapped onto the surface of GP1 (light red) and GP2 (light yellow). (B) Individual alanine mutation of six residues in the b17-b18 loop that increased binding by mAb EBOV-520 (gray bars) but did not affect binding of a recombinant form of the GP base mAb KZ52 (white bars) were identified (top). Mean and range (half of the maximum minus minimum values) of at least two replicate data points are shown. Positions of identified residues in the b17-b18 loop (green) are shown on EBOV GP (PDB: 5JQ3) with gray spheres (bottom). See also Figure S3 . The crystal structure of apo-EBOV GP DMucDTM (PDB: 5JQ3) with the b18-b18 0 region (red) and the b17-b18 loop (green). On the right is the EBOV DMucDTM-rEBOV-520-rEBOV-548 cryo-EM structure; the rEBOV-548 CDRH3 loop is shown in blue.\n\n(legend continued on next page) whose binding was fully abolished by several alanine mutations in the b17-b18 loop (Howell et al., 2017) , none of the alanine mutations within the b17-b18 loop reduced rEBOV-548 binding to the GP (data not shown). Rather, alanine substitutions in several residues of the b17-b18 loop, which are distal to the rEBOV-548 epitope in the upper portion of the glycan cap, increased rEBOV-520 binding by $1.6to 3-fold compared with binding to the wild-type GP ( Figure 4B ). This suggested that rEBOV-548 does not bind to the b17-b18 loop, and binding to the loop itself is not required for cooperative enhancement of rEBOV-520 binding.\n\nTo determine the structural determinants of cooperativity within the cocktail, we solved a cryogenic EM (cryo-EM) structure of rEBOV-520 and rEBOV-548 Fab in complex with EBOV GP with the glycan cap intact and mucin-like domaindeleted (DMuc) at 4.1 \u00c5 resolution ( Figure 5A ; Table S4 ). To determine the contribution of rEBOV-548 to cooperativity, we also solved a cryo-EM structure of rEBOV-548 Fab alone in complex with EBOV GP DMuc at 4.0 \u00c5 resolution ( Figure S4 ; Table S4 ). We were unable to solve the structure in the glycan cap region in the complex of GP-rEBOV-520 Fab alone by cryo-EM (data not shown), which is likely due to flexibility of the glycan cap.\n\nUnlike the previously described mAb FVM09, our structure revealed that rEBOV-548 does not bind directly to the b17-b18 loop. Instead, the CDRH3 loop of rEBOV-548 directly interacted with the b17 strand (residues 272-275) of GP1, forming an extended beta sheet with the glycan cap, including highly conserved critical epitope residues I274 and W275 that were defined by loss of binding with alanine substitution and L273, for which mutation to proline resulted in loss of neutralizing activity. rEBOV-548, similarly to EBOV-442, inhibited glycan cap cleavage, which could be the molecular basis for neutralizing activity by these mAbs . Two non-conserved GP1 residues Y261 and R266, whose mutation to alanine decreased binding of rEBOV-548 ( Figure 3B ), did not directly contact the rEBOV-548 paratope and were not within the cleavage site. In the SUDV GP, natural mutations Y261H and R266L affected rEBOV-548 activity in a similar way by lowering the EC 50 for binding and reducing its neutralizing potency (Figures 1B, S1A, and S1B), suggesting destabilization of the epitope by these adjacent mutations. In both rEBOV-548 Fab alone and rEBOV-520 + rEBOV-548 Fab bound states, the b18-b18 0 domain, C-terminal of the GP b17-b18 loop was displaced and structurally mimicked by the CDRH3 loop of rEBOV-548 ( Figures 5B and S4 ). The rE-BOV-548 LC contacted GP1 through hydrophobic interactions at the loop between a1 and b17 (residues 268 and 269) and through Q27 L1 contacting residue D117, making a possible H-bond with the backbone of D117 ( Figure 5C ) that anchors the mAb to the inner chalice of the GP ( Figure 5A ). We observed rEBOV-548-mediated destabilization and dissociation of the GP trimer ( Figure S5A ). Such a dissociation was limited in the presence of the stalk-specific mAb ADI-16061 that was used to stabilize the GP for cryo-EM with rEBOV-548. It is unclear whether this disruption seen with soluble GPs also occurs in membrane-anchored GPs or whether it contributes to the synergy. Analysis of rEBOV-520 interactions in the structure of rEBOV-520 + rEBOV-548 bound to the GP showed that the rEBOV-520 CDRH3 loop makes additional contacts beyond the 3 10 pocket when the glycan cap is intact. These contacts include Y108 H3 with K510 in GP2, Y106 H3 with (C) Interaction of the rEBOV-548 LC residue Q27 L1 with GP1 residue D117.

See also Figures S4-S6 , Table S4 , and Video S1. Figure 6 . MAbs rEBOV-520 and rEBOV-548 Bind to the GP in a Manner That Mimics Interactions in Unliganded GP (A) rEBOV-548 CDRH3 loop residues that make contacts along the b17 sheet in GP1 (from K272-K276), forming several hydrogen bonds within an extended beta sheet in the glycan cap (black dotted lines) and mimic this interaction by the b18-b18 0 region in the unliganded structure are shown.\n\nAnother key contact shown is with W275, which is cradled within a hydrophobic pocket formed by the tip of the CDRH3 at W108 and H112. (B) Interaction of the rEBOV-520 CDRH3 loop residue W100 with the 3 10 pocket residue N512 in GP1 that mimics interaction by the b17-b18 loop residue in the unliganded structure, and additional interactions when the glycan cap is intact (Y108 with K510 in GP2, Y106 with T77 and a hydrophobic patch in GP1, and T104 with the base of the a1 helix at P250 in GP1) are shown. (legend continued on next page) T77 in GP1, and T104 H3 with P250 in the base of the a1 loop of GP1. The rEBOV-520 CDRH3 residue W100 H3 bound to N512 in GP2, displacing the b17-b18 loop and mimicking the N512 interaction with W291 GP1 of the b17-b18 loop in the unliganded structure ( Figure 5D ). Residues T77, K510, and N512 were highly conserved among EBOV, BDBV, and SUDV GPs.\n\nOf note, our previous study identified N512 as a key epitope residue for rEBOV-520, given that N512A mutation reduced binding to the GP . Therefore, for efficient binding rEBOV-520 must overcome interference of the b17-b18 loop (at W291 GP1 ) and a1 helix (at P250 GP1 ) contained in the glycan cap structure ( Figure 5E ). When two Fabs of the cocktail bound to the GP, the b18-b18 0 region is displaced and the glycan cap pulled back, along with the b17-b18 loop, to allow efficient binding of rEBOV-520 ( Figure 5F ). However, in a structure where rEBOV-548 bound to the GP alone, the glycan cap was not displaced to the degree it was when rEBOV-520 was bound but rather is reminiscent of the structure of unliganded GP. Although the b18 and b18 0 strands are displaced and replaced by rEBOV-548 CDRH3, the b17-b18 loop is largely intact and bound to the base of the IFL, blocking the 3 10 pocket ( Figure S4 ). Comparing solvent exclusion, the unliganded GP and the GP in a complex with rEBOV-548 alone appeared very similar, except for in the b18-b18 0 domain. Most of the region where the rEBOV-520 CDR3 bound was still excluded and the a1 helix was not displaced ( Figure S5B ), consistent with our observation that rEBOV-548 did not fully potentiate binding of rEBOV-520. These data suggested that in the cocktail, rEBOV-520 alone was largely responsible for complete displacement of the b17-b18 loop as well as displacing the a1 helix in the cocktail, whereas rEBOV-548 acted by displacement of the b18-b18 0 domain and the C-terminal portion of the b17-b18 loop, alleviating structural and kinetic restraints for efficient rEBOV-520 binding ( Figure S6 ). We concluded that structural remodeling is the principal mechanism for the enhanced GP binding and ebolavirus neutralization by the cocktail of two cooperative, naturally occurring human mAbs rEBOV-548 and rEBOV-520 (Figures 5G, 5H, and S6; Video S1).\n\nAnalysis of the molecular interaction between rEBOV-520 and rEBOV-548 with the GP illustrated that both mAbs use molecular mimicry whereby CDRH3 binds to the GP in a manner analogous to the interactions in the unliganded GP. Thus, rEBOV-548 CDRH3 interfaced with the b17 sheet of the glycan cap and mimicked the interaction of the b18-b18 0 region with the b17 sheet ( Figures 5B and 6A) , and rEBOV-520 CDRH3 interfaced with the 3 10 pocket residues mimicking the interaction by the b17-b18 loop in the unliganded GP (Figures 5D and 6B ). Together, these experiments defined key molecular features that mediate binding and cooperativity by the cocktail of two broadly neutralizing human mAbs.\n\nThe mAb Cocktail Protects Non-human Primates against EVD We next used a NHP rhesus macaque EBOV challenge model, which recapitulates many key features of EVD in humans (Geisbert et al., 2015; Bennett et al., 2017) , to determine the efficacy of treatment by the cocktail. Rhesus macaques were assigned to one treatment group of five animals. After intramuscular challenge with a lethal target dose of 1,000 plaque-forming units (PFU) of the Kikwit variant of EBOV, all NHPs of the treatment group received intravenously two 30 mg/kg doses of the cocktail (1:1 mixture of rEBOV-520 and rEBOV-548) spaced 3 days apart (days 3 and 6 after infection). An additional animal was studied as a contemporaneous control and was left untreated, along with ten historical untreated controls (7 days post-infection [dpi] median survival, inoculated by the same route with the same stock of virus). The control untreated animal developed a high clinical score and succumbed to the disease on day 6 after infection. The two-dose therapeutic cocktail treatment provided complete protection of NHPs from mortality and clinical signs of EVD ( Figures 7A, 7B , and S7). Before the first treatment (day 3 after infection) three of five NHPs from the treatment-designated group and also the control untreated NHP developed detectable viremia; plasma titers ranged from 6.7 log 10 to 7.3 log 10 genome equivalents (GEQs) per mL, as measured by qRT-PCR ( Figure 7C ). The plasma titer of infectious virus that was assessed by plaque assay on day 3 after infection was below the limit of detection in all animals. However, by day 6 after infection, the viral load in all untreated animals, including in the NHP control from this study and in the historical controls, was as high as >5 log 10 PFU/mL or >11 log 10 GEQ/ mL ( Figures 7C and S7 ). Concordant with full protection, by day 6 after infection all treated NHPs, including three registered as highly viremic on day 3 after infection, no longer had detectable viremia in the plasma. In various tissues harvested from treated animals on day 28 after infection, qRT-PCR analysis, which detects both infectious and non-infectious neutralized particles that have not yet been cleared, revealed virus, confirming active EBOV infection in all NHPs in the treatment group before treatment (Table S5) . We next assessed changes in blood chemistries that are typically associated with EVD to further characterize the efficacy of the mAb cocktail treatment (Table S6 ). The liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), which are indicators of EVD, were elevated in untreated NHPs on day 6 after infection-the peak of viremia and the disease ( Figures 7B and 7C ). Treated animals did not show signs of acute liver injury on day 6 after infection or later time points, displaying low amounts of ALT, GGT, ALP when compared with those of untreated NHP ( Figure 7D ; Table S6 ). To probe the possibility of selection of escape mutants in the presence of the cocktail, we assessed several peripheral tissues for the presence of live infectious\n\nOrange curves indicate treated and black curves indicate untreated animals in (A)-(D). Ten historical controls (gray) are shown for comparative purposes in (A). The black dotted line in (B) indicates the clinical score threshold for euthanasia. The black dotted line in (C) indicates the limit of detection (LOD) for genome equivalents (GEQ); each measurement represents the mean of technical duplicates. See also Figure S7 and Tables S5 and S6. virus to cover all NHPs and using a range of tissues that had the higher number of viral genomes detected by the qRT-PCR. All tested tissues from treated NHPs were confirmed to be negative for live virus on day 28 after infection, showing that the cocktail treatment provided sterilizing immunity (Figure 7E ). Human IgG capture ELISA of serum samples revealed that circulating cocktail mAbs in the treated NHPs ranged from 125 to 460 mg/mL ( Figure 7F ). Given the relevance of such high mAb concentration for strong cooperative interactions (Figure 2C) , cooperativity mediated by the cocktail likely contributed to the effectiveness of treatment.\n\nIn summary, the two-antibody cocktail that deploys multiple functions (a mechanism of neutralization for each of two mAbs, a synergy mediated by the cocktail, and Fc-mediated effector functions exhibited by rEBOV-548) demonstrated high potency to revert EVD in NHPs.\n\nHere, we reported determinants of cooperativity for improved virus binding and neutralization in the cocktail. Our studies define essential features of cooperative mAbs with implications for the design of therapeutic cocktails: (1) we showed that mAbs enabling cooperative neutralization of ebolaviruses are generated by the immune response of human EVD survivors, (2) we identified epitopes for cooperative human mAbs, (3) we described remodeling of glycan cap structures of the GP as a mechanism of mAb cooperativity, (4) we identified molecular mimicry as a mechanism of ebolavirus GP recognition by human mAbs, (5) we showed that a cocktail of two cooperative human mAbs could mediate enhanced activity against heterologous ebolaviruses, (6) we demonstrated therapeutic effectiveness of a two-antibody cocktail in NHPs against EVD, (7) we identified Fc-effector function variants of the GP base-and glycan-cap-specific mAbs that mediate protection against EVD in NHPs.\n\nTo date, monotherapy treatment with mAb114 or treatment with two fully human mAb cocktails, REGN-EB3 or MBP134 AF , have been evaluated for clinical development. MBP134 AF is a two-antibody cocktail with pan-ebolavirus activity that demonstrated efficacy in NHPs (Bornholdt et al., 2019) . REGN-EB3 is a three-antibody cocktail (Pascal et al., 2018) , and mAb114 is a single mAb that is specific to the receptor binding site of the GP (Corti et al., 2016a )-both are monospecific to EBOV. REGN-EB3 and mAb114 were recently assessed in the field in the DRC outbreak of human EVD, and early treatment was associated with reduction of the mortality rate to 6% with REGN-EB3 or to 11% with mAb114 (Nature News, 2019). mAb114 is the only EBOV antibody described that has been shown so far to protect NHPs in monotherapy settings. Even so, the protection mediated by the cocktail of mAb114 + mAb100 was better than that mediated by mAb114 alone (Corti et al., 2016a) . In the cocktail, there is also the potential benefit of avoiding the high risk of virus escape that is inherent in monotherapy approaches. Targeting cross-reactive epitopes might be another approach to reduce the viral escape, given that conserved regions are more likely to be critical for the virus function. Therefore, having a single broad cocktail that is at least as effective as the existing monospecific cock-tail against EBOV would be practical. The cocktail of rEBOV-520 and rEBOV-548 was formulated to add a principle of cooperativity (e.g., incorporation of a pair of non-competing and potently neutralizing mAbs that together exhibit an enhanced activity). Therefore, in addition to the reactivity breadth that extended to BDBV and SUDV, the cocktail of rE-BOV-520 and rEBOV-548 incorporated four principal activities against homologous EBOV: the independent neutralizing activities of (1) rEBOV-520 and (2) rEBOV-548, (3) an enhanced combined activity because of synergy in the cocktail, and (4) Fc-mediated effector function by rEBOV-548. A comparison to the historical NHPs studies with REGN-EB3, mAb114, and MBP134 AF qualifies the cocktail of EBOV-520 and EBOV-548 as highly protective against EBOV. The next studies should determine whether this cocktail protects NHPs against heterologous ebolaviruses.\n\nThe mAbs in the cocktail of rEBOV-520 and rEBOV-548 can act by several mechanisms. The GP binding studies demonstrated that the strongest enhancement by rEBOV-548 in the cocktail is achieved at higher mAb concentrations. Given the relatively high concentration of circulating mAbs after intravenous administration of IgG in treated NHPs, we suggest that enabled cooperativity is one of the mechanisms that likely contributed to the effectiveness of treatment, along with virus neutralization and Fc-mediated function.\n\nIndividual mAbs of the rEBOV-520 and rEBOV-548 cocktail potently neutralized EBOV and BDBV. Therefore, unlike with non-neutralizing synergistic mAb FVM09 (Howell et al., 2017) , synergy is added but not a necessary feature to achieve neutralization by the cocktail of rEBOV-520 and rEBOV-548. Synergistic cocktail formulated with two neutralizing mAbs would likely be more efficient to counteract viral escape.\n\nCooperativity in the cocktail of rEBOV-520 and rEBOV-548 is mediated by recognition of the glycan cap epitope and conformational epitope spanning GP1 and the IFL of GP2. Several studies identified the IFL as a site of vulnerability for potent mAbs that can act solely by neutralization to protect Wec et al., 2017) . MAbs recognizing glycan cap epitopes have been considered as inferior for therapeutic development because of possible cross-reactivity with soluble GPs (sGPs) (Mohan et al., 2012) . Recent studies, however, suggested an indispensable role for Fc-mediated effector functions in the protection against EBOV by glycancap-specific mAbs . It was unknown whether these functions (e.g., neutralizing activity and Fc engagement) in the cocktail of these two mAb specificities were essential and sufficient for efficacy in NHPs. Our study suggested that both functions could be important for virus control and EVD prevention by showing that the cocktail of the Fc-function-competent IgG1 form of glycan-cap-specific rEBOV-548 and functionally impaired IgG1-LALA form of neutralizing IFL-specific rEBOV-520 mediated therapeutic protection in NHPs.\n\nThe key structural aspect of this work is the finding that remodeling of the glycan cap is necessary for efficient binding of potent mAb rEBOV-520 to a vulnerable epitope on GP2, and this remodeling is facilitated in the presence of the GP1-specific mAb rEBOV-548. Therefore, this work defines cooperative interactions between mAbs of the two major epitope specificities for GP recognition, and unveils cooperative binding of the GP as a mechanism for the enhanced ebolavirus neutralization and protection. Principles of mAbantigen interactions demonstrated here with ebolavirus could aid in the design of therapeutic cocktails against other viral targets.\n\nDetailed methods are provided in the online version of this paper and include the following: Zivanov, J., Nakane, T., Forsberg, B.O., Kimanius, D., Hagen, W.J., Lindahl, E., and Scheres, S.H.

A male human survivor of the 2014 EVD outbreak in Nigeria was age 31 when infected and age 32 when PBMCs were collected. PBMCs were collected after the illness had resolved, following written informed consent. At time of blood collection, plasma samples were tested by qRT-PCR and found to be negative for the presence of viral RNA. The studies were approved by the Institutional Review Board of Vanderbilt University Medical Center.\n\nVero-E6 (monkey, female origin), THP-1 (human, male origin), and Jurkat (human, male origin) cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Vero-E6 cells were cultured in Minimal Essential Medium (MEM) (ThermoFisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin at 5% CO 2 , 37 C. THP-1 and Jurkat cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (GIBCO) medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (GIBCO), 1% GlutaMax (GIBCO), 100 units/mL of penicillin, and 100 mg/mL of streptomycin (GIBCO) at 37 C in 5% CO 2 . The MFP-2 line is a non-secreting mouse-human trioma cell line (sex information is not available) that was generated by fusing a murine myeloma cell line with a human myeloma cell line, yielding the intermediate heteromyeloma B6B11, followed by fusion with a human lymphocyte. This cell line was cultured as described previously (Yu et al., 2008) . A 293F cell line (human, female origin) stably-transfected to express SNAP-tagged EBOV GP was described previously (Domi et al., 2018) . ExpiCHO (hamster, female origin) and FreeStyle 293F (human, female origin) cell lines were purchased from ThermoFisher Scientific and cultured according to the manufacturer's protocol. The Jurkat-EBOV GP . All cell lines were tested on a monthly basis for Mycoplasma and found to be negative in all cases.\n\nThe authentic EBOV-eGFP, mouse-adapted EBOV Mayinga (EBOV-MA, GenBank: AF49101) and SUDV strain Gulu were described previously (Bray et al., 1998; Sanchez and Rollin, 2005; Towner et al., 2005) . The chimeric infectious EBOV/BDBV-GP and EBOV/ SUDV-GP viruses expressing eGFP were obtained by replacing the gene encoding EBOV GP with that of BDBV (GenBank: KU174137) or SUDV (GenBank: KU174142), respectively (Ilinykh et al., 2016) .\n\nSeven-to eight-week old female BALB/c mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory, and 7-to 8-week-old female 129S6/ SvEv-Stat1tm1Rds mice (Stat1 \u00c0/\u00c0 ) were obtained from Taconic Biosciences. Mice were housed in microisolator cages and provided food and water ad libitum. Challenge studies were conducted under maximum containment in an animal biosafety level 4 (ABSL-4) facility of the Galveston National Laboratory, UTMB. The animal protocols for testing of mAbs in mice were approved by the \n\nFour-to six-year old male (n = 3) and female (n = 3) rhesus macaques used in this study were obtained from PrimGen. NHP research adhered to principles stated in the eighth edition of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.

The cells were cryopreserved in the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen until use. The EBOV GP-reactive memory B cells were labeled with the recombinant EBOV GP protein that was produced in Drosophila Schneider 2 (S2) cells as described below and purified by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) as described previously (Bornholdt et al., 2016) . This step resulted in $5,000 sorted EBOV GP-reactive memory B cells. Human B cell hybridomas were generated as described previously (Yu et al., 2008) with some modifications. Briefly, FACS-isolated GP-reactive B cells were bulk-expanded on irradiated NIH 3T3 cells that had been engineered to express human IL-21, CD40L (CD154), and BAFF in medium A (STEMCELL Technologies) supplemented with CpG, a Chk2 inhibitor (Sigma-Aldrich), and cyclosporine A (Sigma-Aldrich). After 8 days cells were bulk-fused with MFP-2 myeloma cells using an established electrofusion technique (Yu et al., 2008) , which resulted in generation of $1,100 individual hybridoma lines. After the fusion reaction, hybridoma lines were cultured in ClonaCell-HY Medium E (STEMCELL Technologies) supplemented with HAT (hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine) Media Supplement (Sigma-Aldrich) in 384-well plates for 18 days before screening of supernatants for antibody production.\n\nScreening strategy to identify partner mAbs for therapeutic cocktail Our previous work used Jurkat cell surface displayed EBOV GP to assess competition-binding groups of the GP reactive mAbs that isolated from human survivor of EVD outbreak in the DRC . This study revealed that binding of two broadly-reactive glycan cap specific mAbs increases binding of broadly-neutralizing and highly protective base-specific mAbs EBOV-515 and EBOV-520 . Here, for the development of cooperative mAb cocktail, we performed a comprehensive screening from $1,800 individual GP-reactive B cell line supernatants ($1,100 from this study and $750 from previous study with the DRC outbreak survivor) to identify a suitable partner mAb for these potent base-specific mAb. The criteria for down-selection of the partner mAb candidates included (a) high neutralizing activity against live pathogenic virus (neutralizing at least EBOV); (b) broad reactivity to EBOV, BDBV, and SUDV GP; (c) synergistic activity that was defined as the ability of mAb to enhance binding of EBOV-515 and EBOV-520 (at least 2-fold enhancement) when compared to binding of the base-specific mAb alone; and (d) efficacy of monotherapy in mice to protect against live EBOV challenge. Supernatants from each well of the 384-well culture plates with expanded hybridoma lines first were assessed for neutralizing activity against live EBOV using one 1:5 supernatant dilution in 96-well plate format as detailed below in the Neutralization assays section. Next, hybridoma lines that fully neutralized EBOV at the supernatant dilution tested were assessed by ELISA for reactivity against recombinant EBOV, BDBV, and SUDV GP. The broadly-reactive clones identified were tested for neutralizing activity against live BDBV and SUDV. Hybridoma cell lines producing cross-reactive and neutralizing mAbs (mAbs that reacted to all three GPs and neutralized at least EBOV and BDBV) were cloned biologically by single-cell fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Hybridomas were expanded in Medium E (STEMCELL Technologies) until 50% confluent in 75-cm 2 flasks (Corning). Purified mAbs were tested using a competition-binding assay with intact Jurkat-EBOV GP (A) or thermolysin cleaved Jurkat-EBOV GP CL to identify major antigenic sites. Identified mAbs that (a) competed with the reference glycan cap specific mAbs c13C16 (Davidson et al., 2015) or BDBV289 (Flyak et al., 2916) on intact GP, and (b) recognized intact but not cleaved GP, were assessed for cooperative binding to Jurkat cell surface displayed EBOV GP in the presence of the GP base-specific mAbs EBOV-515 or EBOV-520 (described below). This screening approach resulted in identification of broadly-reactive glycan cap region-specific mAbs EBOV-437, EBOV-442, and EBOV-548. Antibodies EBOV-442 and EBOV-548 potently neutralized EBOV and BDBV and offered partial protection (80 to 40% survival) in vivo in mice lethally challenged with live EBOV. mAb EBOV-548 showed the highest cooperativity with EBOV-515 and EBOV-520; based on this feature it was selected for further testing in the cocktail with EBOV-520.\n\nThe isotype and subclass of secreted antibodies were determined using murine anti-human IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 or IgG4 mouse antibodies conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Southern Biotech). Antibody heavy-and light-chain variable region genes were sequenced from RNA obtained from hybridoma lines that had been cloned biologically by flow cytometric sorting. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN). A modified 5 0 RACE (Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends) approach was used (Turchaninova et al., 2016) . Briefly, 5 mL total RNA was mixed with cDNA synthesis primer mix (10 mM each) and incubated for 2 min at 70 C and then decrease the incubation temperature to 42 C to anneal the synthesis primers (1-3 min). After incubation, a mixture containing 5X first-strand buffer (Clontech), DTT (20 mM), 5 0 template switch oligo (10 mM), dNTP solution (10 mM each) and 10X SMARTScribe Reverse Transcriptase (Clontech) was added to the primer-annealed total RNA reaction and incubated for 60 min at 42 C. The first-strand synthesis reaction was purified using the Ampure Size Select Magnetic Bead Kit at a ratio of 1.8X (Beckman Coulter). Following, a single PCR amplification reaction containing 5 mL first-strand cDNA, 2X Q5 High Fidelity Mastermix (NEB), dNTP (10 mM each), forward universal primer (10 mM) and reverse primer mix (0.2 mM each in heavy-chain mix, 0.2 mM each in light-chain mix) were subjected to thermal cycling with the following conditions: initial denaturation for 1 min 30 s followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 98 C for 10 s, annealing at 60 C for 20 s, and extension at 72 C for 40 s, followed by a final extension step at 72 C for 4 min. All primer sequences used in this protocol were previously described (Turchaninova et al., 2016) . The first PCR reaction was purified using the Ampure Size Select Magnetic Bead Kit at a ratio of 0.6X (Beckman Coulter). Amplicon libraries were then prepared according to the Pacific Biosciences Multiplex SMRT Sequencing protocol and sequenced on a Pacific Biosciences Sequel platform. Raw sequencing data was demultiplexed and circular consensus sequences (CCS) were determined using the Pacific Biosciences SMRT Analysis tool suite. The identities of gene segments, CDRs, and mutations from germlines were determined by alignment using the ImMunoGeneTics database (Giudicelli and Lefranc, 2011) .\n\nFor recombinant mAb production, cDNA encoding the genes of heavy and light chains were cloned into DNA plasmid expression vectors encoding IgG1 or IgG1-LALA -or Fab-heavy chain (McLean et al., 2000) and transformed into E. coli cells. mAb proteins were produced after transient transfection of ExpiCHO cells following the manufacturer's protocol and were purified from filtered culture supernatants by fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) on an EKTA instrument using HiTrap MabSelect Sure column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Purified mAbs were buffer exchanged into PBS, filtered using sterile 0.45-mm pore size filter devices (Millipore), concentrated, and stored in aliquots at \u00c080 C until use.\n\nThe ectodomains of EBOV GP DTM (residues 1-636; strain Makona; GenBank: KM233070), BDBV GP DTM (residues 1-643; strain 200706291 Uganda; GenBank: NC_014373), SUDV GP DTM (residues 1-637; strain Gulu; GenBank: NC_006432), and MARV GP DTM (residues 1-648; strain Angola2005; GenBank: DQ447653) were expressed and purified as described before .\n\nWells of microtiter plates were coated with purified, recombinant EBOV, BDBV, SUDV, or MARV GP DTM and incubated at 4 C overnight. Plates were blocked with 2% non-fat dry milk and 2% normal goat serum in DPBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 (DPBS-T) for 1 h. For mAb screening assays, hybridoma culture supernatants were diluted in blocking buffer 1:5, added to the wells, and incubated for 1 h at ambient temperature. The bound antibodies were detected using goat anti-human IgG conjugated with HRP (horseradish peroxidase) (Southern Biotech) and TMB (3,3 0 ,5,5 0 -tetramethylbenzidine) substrate (ThermoFisher Scientific). Color development was monitored, 1N hydrochloric acid was added to stop the reaction, and the absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a spectrophotometer (Biotek). For dose-response and cross-reactivity assays, serial dilutions of purified mAbs were applied to the wells in triplicate or quadruplicate, and mAb binding was detected as detailed above.\n\nThe Octet Red TM 96e instrument (FortkBio, Pall) was used to assess binding kinetics of indicated mAbs to EBOV GP. Streptavidin sensors (Forte 0 Bio) were used to capture biotinylated EBOV GP 0.5 mg/mL in 1X kinetics buffer (PBS containing 0.002% Tween-20 and 0.1 or 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma-Aldrich), as indicated. Binding was performed using serial two-fold dilutions of mAbs. The baseline and dissociation steps were carried out in the 1X kinetics buffer at 30 or 37 C as per the vendor's recommendations. Kinetic binding data are adequately described by 1:1 binding model but accounting for trimeric nature of immobilized GP and bivalent IgG analyte the associating stoichiometry is likely reflected more complex avidity effects. Therefore, data represent an apparent K D values (K D app ; Table S1), as previously described (Davidson et al., 2015) .\n\nBinding to Jurkat cell surface displayed EBOV, BDBV, or SUDV GPs was assessed with mAbs that were directly fluorescentlylabeled. Briefly, mAbs were labeled with AF647 NHS ester (ThermoFisher Scientific) by following the manufacturer's protocol. Labeled mAbs were buffer exchanged into PBS using desalting Zeba columns (ThermoFisher Scientific) and stored at 4 C with 0.1% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.01% sodium azide. Cells were washed with the incubation buffer containing DPBS (Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline), 2% of heat-inactivated FBS and 2 mM EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, sodium salt) (pH 8.0) by centrifugation at 400 x g for 5 min at ambient temperature. For antibody staining, $5 G 10 4 cells were added per each well of V-bottom 96-well plate (Corning) in 5 mL of the incubation buffer. Serial dilutions of antibody were added to the cells in triplicate or quadruplicate for total volume of 50 mL per well, followed by 1 h incubation at room temperature, or 4 C in some experiments. Unbound antibody was removed by washing with 200 mL of the incubation buffer. Staining of cells was measured by flow cytometric analysis using an IntelliCyt iQue Screener Plus high throughput cytometer (Intellicyt Corp.). Data for up to 20,000 events were acquired, and data were analyzed with ForeCyt (Intellicyt Corp.) software. Dead cells were excluded from the analysis on the basis of forward and side scatter gate for viable cell population. Binding to un-transduced Jurkat cells or binding of dengue antigen-specific mAb DENV 2D22 served as negative controls for most experiments. In some experiments, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in DPBS after staining and before flow cytometric analysis.\n\nTo assess binding of mAbs to cleaved GP, Jurkat-EBOV, -BDBV, or -SUDV GP cells were treated with 0.5 mg/mL of thermolysin (Promega) in PBS for 20 min at 37 C. Cells staining and flow cytometric analysis was performed as described above. The reaction was inhibited by washing cells with the incubation buffer containing DPBS, 2% of heat-inactivated FBS and 2 mM EDTA (pH 8.0). Binding to un-transduced Jurkat (mock) or uncleaved Jurkat-EBOV GP served as controls. EC 50 values for saturated binding of mAb to GP CL were determined using Prism 7.2 software (GraphPad) after log transformation of mAb concentration and median fluorescence intensity (MFI) values using sigmoidal dose-response nonlinear regression analysis. For non-saturating mAb binding, which observed with intact GP, EC 50 values were calculated by linear regression analysis using EC 50 and maximum response (Bmax) values that determined from saturating binding to GP CL as above.\n\nCooperative binding to cell surface displayed GP The assay was performed as described previously . Briefly, Jurkat-EBOV, BDBV, or SUDV GP cells were incubated in triplicates with AF647-labeled first mAb alone (typically the GP-base specific mAb) or the same labeled mAb that titrated into a fixed concentration (typically 10 to 20 mg/mL) of the unlabeled second mAb (typically the GP glycan cap specific mAb). Cells were washed, and antibody binding was analyzed by flow cytometry using IntelliCyt iQue Screener Plus flow cytometer. Background values were determined from binding of the fluorescently labeled mAb to un-transduced (mock) Jurkat cells. Maximal values for saturated binding of rEBOV-520 or rEBOV-548 were estimated from the dose-response binding curves of the GP-base specific mAb rEBOV-520 with respective cell surface displayed cleaved GPs (GP CL ), which was based on a similar ratio of AF647 conjugation to rEBOV-520 and rEBOV-548. Results are expressed as the percent of maximal binding minus background signal from mock control for each tested condition with labeled mAb.\n\nEpitope mapping using an EBOV GP alanine-scan mutation library Epitope mapping was carried out as described previously (Davidson et al., 2015) . Comprehensive high-throughput alanine scanning ('shotgun mutagenesis') was carried out on an expression construct for EBOV GP lacking the mucin-like domain (residues 311-461) (based on the Yambuku-Mayinga variant GP sequence), mutagenizing GP residues 33-310 and 462-676 to create a library of clones, each representing an individual point mutant. Residues were changed to alanine (with alanine residues changed to serine). The resulting library, covering 492 of 493 (99.9%) of target residues, was arrayed into 384-well plates, one mutant per well, then transfected into HEK293T cells and allowed to express for 22 h. Cells, unfixed or fixed in 4% PFA, were incubated with primary antibody and then with an AF488-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). After washing, cellular fluorescence was detected using the Intellicyt flow cytometer. mAb reactivity against each mutant EBOV GP clone was calculated relative to wildtype EBOV GP reactivity by subtracting the signal from mock-transfected controls and normalizing to the signal from wild-type GPtransfected controls. Mutated residues within clones were identified as critical to the mAb epitope if they did not support reactivity of the test mAb but did support reactivity of other control EBOV mAbs. This counter-screen strategy facilitated the exclusion of GP mutants that were misfolded locally or that exhibited an expression defect (Davidson and Doranz, 2014) .\n\nTo generate escape mutants, 100 PFU of EBOV-eGFP were combined with 2-fold dilutions of the respective mAb starting at 200 mg/mL in U-bottom 96-well plates and incubated for 1 h at 37 C. Mixtures were applied on Vero-E6 cell monolayer cultures in 96-well plates and incubated for 1 h. Supernatants were removed, freshly-diluted mAb was added at the same concentrations in 200 mL of MEM supplemented with 2% FBS, and plates were incubated for 7 days at 37 C. Viruses that replicated in the presence of the highest concentrations of mAb, as determined by monitoring eGFP fluorescence by microscopy, were collected. Twenty (20) mL aliquots were incubated with 2-fold dilutions of mAbs starting at 200 mg/mL, and viruses were propagated in the presence of mAbs as described above. The procedure was repeated once more with mAb dilutions starting at 400 mg/mL. Viruses that replicated at the highest mAb concentrations were amplified in Vero-E6 cell culture monolayers in 24-well plates in the presence of mAbs at 200 mg/mL for 7 days. Cellular RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent, and cDNA copies of viral RNA encoding GP were amplified by RT-PCR and sequenced. To verify isolated escape mutants, 100 PFU of the viruses in MEM supplemented with 2% FBS in triplicate were combined in U-bottom 96-well plates with 8 to 12 two-fold dilutions of mAb, starting at 200 mg/mL and incubated for 1 h at 37 C. The virus/antibody mixtures then were applied in triplicate to Vero-E6 cell culture monolayers in 96-well plates, incubated for 1 h at 37 C, washed with MEM, overlaid with 200 mL of MEM containing 2% FBS and 0.8% methylcellulose, and incubated for 48 h at 37 C. Plates were fixed with 10% phosphate-buffered formalin (Fisher). Plaques were counted using fluorescence microscopy.\n\nVirus neutralization assays were performed in a high-throughput format using the recombinant EBOV-eGFP or chimeric EBOV viruses in which GP was replaced with its counterpart from BDBV or SUDV, as described previously (Ilinykh et al., 2016) . Briefly, four-fold dilutions of the respective mAb starting at 200 mg/mL were mixed in triplicate with 400 PFU of the virus in U-bottom 96-well plates and incubated for 1 h at 37 C. Mixtures were applied on Vero-E6 cell monolayer cultures in 96-well plates and incubated for four days at 37 C. In the absence of mAb neutralizing activity, the infection resulted in uniform eGFP fluorescence from the monolayer of cells that was readily detected by fluorescence microscopy. Fluorescence was measured using Synergy HT microplate reader (BioTek).\n\nFor assessing cooperative neutralization of SUDV by the cocktail of two mAbs, virus was incubated with increasing concentrations of rEBOV-520 or rEBOV-548 alone, or rEBOV-520 titrated into a fixed concentration (20 mg/mL) of rEBOV-548 in triplicate.\n\nTo screen for escape mutations in the presence of individual mAbs or the cocktail, we used a high-throughput and quantitative real-time cell analysis assay and xCELLigence Analyzer (ACEA Biosciences Inc.) that assesses kinetic changes in cell physiology, including virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE). Fifty (50) mL of cell culture medium (DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS) was added to each well of a 96-well E-plate to obtain background reading. Eighteen thousand (18,000) Vero-E6 cells in 50 mL of cell culture medium were seeded per each well and plate was placed on the analyzer. Measurements were taken automatically every 15 min and the sensograms were visualized using RTCA software version 2.1.0 (ACEA Biosciences Inc). For the first passage, rVSV/ EBOV GP or rVSV/SUDV GP viruses (0.3 MOI, $6,000 PFU per well) were mixed with eight two-fold dilutions of individual mAbs or the cocktail of rEBOV-520/rEBOV-548 (1:1 mAbs ratio) starting at 25 mg/mL in a total volume of 100 mL and incubated for 1 h at 37 C. At 12 h after seeding the cells, the virus/mAb mixtures were added in 2 to 7 replicates to the cells in 96-well E-plates. Wells containing virus only in the absence of mAb and wells containing only Vero cells in medium were included on each plate as controls. Plates were measured continuously (every 15 min) for over 48 h to assess virus neutralization. Ten (10) mL aliquots from the wells with viruses that replicated at the highest mAb concentrations ($500-6,000 PFU) were used for the repeated passage for total 15 passages with rVSV/EBOV GP and 5 passages with rVSV/SUDV GP. The escape mutants were identified by CPE in wells containing typically neutralizing concentrations of mAbs. To verify the escape mutation, isolated viruses were tested with 100 mg/mL of each individual mAb and the cocktail using RTCA neutralization assay, and then sequenced. Controls included viruses from the late passages that did not escape neutralization in the presence of the cocktail, and viruses incubated in a presence of control mAb DENV 2D22. These viruses were assessed against individual mAbs (rEBOV-520, rEBOV-548, and DENV 2D22) and the cocktail, and then sequenced.\n\nRapid fluorometric antibody-mediated cytotoxicity assay (RFADCC) Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity of EBOV GP-reactive IgG or Fab was quantified with an EBOV-adapted modification of the RFADCC assay (Domi et al., 2018; Orlandi et al., 2016) . Briefly, a target cell line was made by transfecting 293F cells with a full-length DNA expressing GP from the EBOV-Kikwit isolate followed by transfecting with two separate DNA constructs expressing eGFP and the chimeric CCR5-SNAP tag protein. The new cell line, designated EBOV GPkik-293FS eGFP CCR5-SNAP, expresses EBOV-Kikwit GP on the plasma membrane, eGFP in the cytoplasm and the SNAP-tag CCR5, which can be specifically labeled with SNAP-Surface AF647 (NEB), on the cell surface (Domi et al., 2018) . A recombinant form of a human anti-EBOV GP mAb KZ52 (a neutralizing antibody) (IBT Bioservices) was used as a positive control and the unrelated human mAb DENV 2D22 as a negative control. The ADCC activity was quantified by incubating three-fold serial dilutions of mAbs with EBOV GPkik-293FS eGFP CCR5-SNAP target cells for 15 min at ambient temperature and then adding human PBMC as effector cells for 2 h at 37 C, after which cells were washed once with PBS, fixed with 2% PFA, stained and analyzed with an LSRII Fortessa flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Data analysis was performed with FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc.). The percentage cytotoxicity of the mAb was determined as the number of target cells losing eGFP signal (by virtue of ADCC) but retaining the surface expression of CCR5-SNAP. glycans were then added and trimmed to fit EM density using the model with the best statistics, followed by manual adjustment in Coot (Emsley et al., 2010) followed by a final round of refinement in Rosetta, including glycans and restraining backbone coordinates. For the EBOV GP DMucDTM (Makona) complex with rEBOV-548 alone, an additional refinement in Phenix was performed to idealize geometry. Glycans were validated using PDB-care (L\u20ac utteke and von der Lieth, 2004) and Privateer (Agirre et al., 2015) . All model figures were generated using UCSF Chimera (Pettersen et al., 2004) . To estimate change in GP solvent exclusion upon Fabs binding, GP1,2 from an unliganded GP structure (PDB: 5JQ3), and GP1,2 bound to the respective Fabs were used to create a surface map in UCSF chimera (Pettersen et al., 2004) and then normalized to Gly-X-Gly tripeptides (Bendell et al., 2014) to determine a normalized solvent excluded surface (SES).\n\nEpitope mapping using peptide fragmentation and hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) To maximize peptide sequence coverage, the optimized digestion and quench conditions were determined prior to deuteration studies. Briefly, EBOV GP DTM or EBOV GP CL samples were diluted with DPBS buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1.9 mM KH 2 PO 4 , pH = 7.4) at 0 C and then quenched with 0.8% formic acid (v/v) containing various concentration of guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl; 0.8-8 M) and Tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP) (0.1 or 1.0 M). Eight (8) M GuHCl, 0.5 M TCEP in PBS pH = 2.0 gave an optimal peptide coverage map.\n\nHydrogen-deuterium exchange reactions were initiated by diluting protein samples with D 2 O in DPBS buffer at a 1:2 ratio (v/v) at 10 s, 100 s or 1,000 s prior to quenching and on-line pepsin digestion. Non-deuterated samples served as controls. Using a Waters nano-ACQUITY UPLC system with an HDX manager (Waters Corp.), samples were injected onto an immobilized pepsin column (Waters Enzymate TM ) where digestion was performed at 20 C and 4,700 psi at a flow of 100 mL/min of 0.1% formic acid in H 2 O. The resulting peptides were collected on a VanGuard BEH C18 1.7 mm guard column (Waters Corp.) and separated over a Waters BEH C18 1.7 mm, 1 mm x 100 mm column using a gradient of 5%-25% acetonitrile over 6 min. The column was coupled to a Waters Xevo G2-XS instrument, eluent was electrosprayed, and MS E scans were performed with lock-mass acquisition (Leucine enkephalin, m/z 556.2771). The capillary was set to 2.8kV, source temperature to 80 C, desolvation temperature to 175 C, desolvation gas to 400 L/h and the instrument was scanned over a m/z range of 50-2,000. All experiments were carried out in triplicate. Waters Protein-Lynx LGobal Server 3.0.3 software (Waters Corp.) was used to identify the peptide ions with an FDR of 4%, using non-specific protease cleavage, a minimum number of fragment ion matches per peptide of three, and oxidation of methionine as variable modification. DynamX 3.0 (Waters Corp) was used for the analysis of the mass spectra. Non-deuterated samples and equilibrium-deuterated back-exchange control samples served as controls. The centroids of the isotopic envelopes of non-deuterated, functionally deuterated, and fully deuterated peptides were measured using DXMS Explorer, and then converted to corresponding deuteration levels with corrections for back-exchange.\n\nCrystallography and structure determination EBOV GP for co-crystallization with EBOV-520 was expressed as mucin-like domain-deleted GP (GP DMuc) in Drosophila S2 cells using a single pMT-puro plasmid encoding a C-terminally Strep-tagged construct lacking the transmembrane domain. The protein was purified using a StrepTrap HP affinity chromatography column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) followed by cleavage of the Strep tag at an Enterokinase cleavage site using EKMax (ThermoFisher Scientific). To prepare GP CL , purified GP DMuc was incubated with 1.5% thermolysin overnight at room temperature to mimic endosomal cathepsin cleavage followed by further purification using a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL SEC column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). EBOV-520 Fab for co-crystallization with EBOV GP CL was prepared by incubating EBOV-520 IgG with 2% papain for 4 h at 37 C; the digestion was quenched using 50 mM iodoacetamide. The Fab was purified from the reaction mixture using a MonoQ 5/50 GL ion-exchange column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) followed by further purification using a Superdex 75 Increase 10/300 GL SEC column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences).\n\nThe GP CL -EBOV-520 Fab complex was obtained by incubating GP CL with a 3-fold molar excess of EBOV-520 Fab overnight at 4 C followed by purification using a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL SEC column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). The complex was screened for crystallization using a Douglas Instruments Oryx8, and the protein crystallized in a solution of 0.1 M HEPES pH 7.0 and 1.4 M ammonium sulfate. Diffraction data to 3.46 F resolution were collected at beamline 23-IDD at the Advanced Photon Source. The diffraction images were processed using iMosflm (Battye et al., 2011) and scaled using Aimless (Evans and Murshudov, 2013) . Molecular replacement, model building, and structure refinement were carried out using the PHENIX suite of programs . Chains G and H of the PDB entry 5HJ3 were used as molecular replacement search models for GP CL , and chains Y and Z of the PDB entry 4YK4 were used as a search model for EBOV-520 Fab following model pruning using Sculptor (Bunkyczi and Read, 2011) . The molecular graphics application Coot (Emsley et al., 2010 ) was used for model inspection and manual refinement. A single GP CL monomer and a single EBOV-520 Fab were contained within the asymmetric unit of the P4 1 32 crystals, and crystal symmetry was applied to generate the model of the biologically relevant trimer shown in all figures.\n\nThe descriptive statistics mean \u00b1 SEM or mean \u00b1 SD were determined for continuous variables as noted. Survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan Meier method and curves compared using the two-sided log rank test (Mantel-Cox) with subjects right censored, if they survived until the end of the study. EC 50 values for mAb binding were determined after log transformation of antibody concentration using sigmoidal dose-response nonlinear regression analysis. In neutralization assays, IC 50 values were calculated after log transformation of antibody concentrations using a 3-parameter nonlinear fit analysis. The effect of antibody composition on the GP binding (single mAb or two-antibody mixture) and p values were estimated by overall test from untransformed MFI flow cytometric values using two-way ANOVA. In neutralization assays, mAb synergy by cocktails was quantified with Compu-Syn software using approach that estimates the combination index (CI) to define the effect of drug combination (Chou, 2010) . CI values were calculated for each tested concentration of mAb combination, and CI values < 1 considered as evidence of synergy. Viral titers in plasma were compared using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test (two-tailed) where column medians compared to a value that equals to the limit of detection for the plaque assay (1.4 log 10 PFU/mL). p < 0.05 considered as significant. Technical and biological replicates are indicated in the figure legends. Statistical analyses were performed using Prism v7.2 (GraphPad).\n\nThe EBOV GP CL \u00c0EBOV-520 Fab crystal structure, the EBOV GP DMuc DTM (Makona)\u00c0rEBOV-520\u00c0rEBOV-548 Fab cryo-EM structure, and EBOV GP DMuc DTM (Makona)\u00c0rEBOV-548 Fab structure has been deposited in the PDB with accession code 6OZ9, 6PCI, and 6UYE respectively.
