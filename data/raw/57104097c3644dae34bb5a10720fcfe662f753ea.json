{"title": "Identification of 6 0 -b-fluoro-homoaristeromycin as a potent inhibitor of chikungunya virus replication", "body": "RNA viruses have RNA as their genetic material and many important human pathogens have single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) in their genome [1] . The Baltimore classification distinguishes three groups of RNA viruses based on the nature of their genome and mode of replication: double-stranded RNA viruses, negative-sense ssRNA viruses, and positive-sense ssRNA (\u00feRNA) viruses [1, 2] . The \u00feRNA viruses form the largest group and contain many important human pathogens, such as dengue virus, hepatitis C virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus [3] , middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus [4] , Zika virus (ZIKV) [5] , and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) [6] . Antiviral therapy is still lacking for most of these viruses that have a serious impact on human health. Thus, it is desirable to develop new antiviral agents for the treatment of viral diseases caused by RNA viruses.\n\nThe genome of a \u00feRNA virus functions as messenger RNA (mRNA) and can be directly translated by host ribosomes into viral (poly)proteins that ultimately form the replication complexes that drive the replication of viral RNA. The 5 0 -end of the genomes of most \u00feRNA viruses contain a cap structure that is important for translation, RNA stability and evasion of host innate immune responses. Capping of viral RNA is usually carried out by one or multiple viral proteins that use S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) as the methyl donor. Cellular S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) hydrolase is a pivotal enzyme in the regeneration cycle of SAM, which serves as a methyl donor in cellular methylation reactions and is required for viral mRNA capping [7] . Inhibition of SAH hydrolase leads to the accumulation of SAH, which in turn inhibits SAM-dependent methylation reactions, including those required for the maturation of viral RNA [7] . Thus, SAH hydrolase is a promising target for the development of broad-spectrum antiviral agents [8] .\n\nA variety of carbocyclic adenosine analogues with antiviral activity, including aristeromycin are assumed to exert their antiviral action via the inhibition of SAH hydrolase [9] . A close correlation has been detected between the antiviral effects of various carbocyclic and acyclic adenosine analogues and their inhibitory effects on SAH hydrolase in biochemical assays with purified protein [9] . These compounds were observed to be weak inhibitors of flavivirus replication in plaque reduction assays [10] , whereas they exhibited potent antiviral activity against the replication of ss(\u00c0)RNA viruses such as Ebola [11] . Among these, aristeromycin (1) (Fig. 1) is the representative carbocyclic nucleoside, which was first synthesized in racemic form in 1966 and shortly thereafter, isolated from the fermentation broth of Streptomyces citricolor [12] . It displays potent antiviral activity against several RNA viruses, that result from the inhibition of the SAH hydrolase [8] . Although it is a potent SAH hydrolase inhibitor, its therapeutic utility is limited, because of its significant toxicity [13] . This cytotoxicity may be caused by 5 0phosphorylation of the compound and its inhibition of cellular RNA polymerases and/or incorporation into cellular RNA [13] .\n\nBased on the potent antiviral activity of 1, we recently reported the synthesis of enantiomerically pure 6 0 -fluorinated-aristeromycin analogues and their potent anti-RNA virus activities [14] . Among these, 6,6 0 -difluoro-aristeromycin 2 exhibits potent antiviral activities against MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, ZIKV, and CHIKV [14] . However, compound 2 still exhibited substantial cytotoxicity, although it was less cytotoxic than 1. This cytotoxicity may be attributed to 5 0 -phosphorylation, similar to what is presumed for 1. Therefore, it is desirable to design aristeromycin analogues that retain their inhibitory activity towards SAH hydrolase without being 5 0 -phosphorylated by cellular kinases. Therefore, our strategy was to design 5 0 -homologated analogues that are expected to displace the phosphate-susceptible 5 0 -hydroxyl from the phosphate-transfer zone in the kinases. The feasibility of this strategy is supported by the fact that (\u00c0)-homoaristeromycin is inactive against HSV-1 and HSV-2, possibly, due to its failure to be phosphorylated [15] . Thus, we designed and synthesized 6 0 -fluorinated-5 0 -homoaristeromycin analogues 3aee, which combined the one-carbon homologation at the 5 0 -position with the bioisosteric displacement of the hydrogen with the fluorine at the 6 0 -position. It was expected that compounds 3aee would retain the inhibitory activity against SAH hydrolase, whereas the lack of 5 0phosphorylation would lead to lower cytotoxicity.\n\nHere, we report the synthesis of enantiomerically pure 6 0 -fluorinated-5 0 -homoaristeromycin analogues 3aee via the electrophilic fluorination [14, 16, 17] of the silyl enol ether with Selectfluor as the key step and assessment of their antiviral activity.\n\nTo synthesize the final nucleosides 3aee, we designed the retrosynthetic analysis, as illustrated in Scheme 1. Final nucleoside 3 was derived from amino intermediate 4 by the linear purine base build-up approach. Amino derivative 4 was easily derived from ketone 5 via the stereoselective reduction of the ketone and S N 2 displacement with azide as key steps. 6-Fluoroketone 5 was synthesized using stereoselective electrophilic fluorination of silyl enol ether, which was obtained from key intermediate 6. Ketone 6 was derived from D-cyclopentenone 7, using a Michael reaction as a key step. Intermediate 7 was efficiently derived from D-ribose according to our previously published procedure with a minor modification [16, 17] .\n\nKey intermediate 6 was synthesized according to our previously published procedure, as shown in Scheme 2 [17] . Briefly, D-ribose was converted to diene 8 in four steps without purification in a 64% yield. The ring-closing metathesis (RCM) reaction of 6 with Neolyst M2 instead of Grubbs' catalyst, followed by pyridinium dichromate (PDC) oxidation afforded the cyclopentenone 7 in a 56% yield. This modified procedure created desired intermediate 7 in six steps with a 36% overall yield [16] .\n\nThe Michael addition of 7 with vinylmagnesium bromide in the presence of copper(I) bromide afforded vinyl ketone 9 [18] in a 76% yield. Reduction of 9 with sodium borohydride yielded a-alcohol 10a as the single stereoisomer, which was protected with a tertbutyldiphenylsilyl (TBDPS) group to yield 10b. The hydroborationoxidation of 10b with a borane-dimethyl sulphide complex afforded primary alcohol 11. The removal of the TBDPS group of 11 with tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride (TBAF) yielded diol 12, in which the primary hydroxyl group was selectively protected with a TBDPS group to afford 13. Oxidation of the remaining secondary alcohol in 13 with tetra-n-propylammonium perruthenate (TPAP) and Nmethylmorpholine N-oxide (NMO) afforded ketone 6 [17] , which served as the key starting material for the electrophilic fluorination.\n\nKetone 6 was converted to the amines 18a and 18b, which were the key precursors for the synthesis of the final nucleosides, as shown in Scheme 3. Ketone 6 was treated with lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide (LiHMDS), followed by trapping the resulting enolate with chlorotriethylsilane (TESCl) to produce silyl enol ether. The silyl enol ether was treated with electrophilic fluorine, octane ditetrafluoroborate) to produce desired 6-b-fluoro-cyclopentanone 14 as the single stereoisomer, which was equilibrated to geminal diol because of the electronegative fluorine atom [14, 16, 17] . The b stereochemistry of fluorine was obtained because of the steric hindrance by the 2,3-isopropylidene group, which was confirmed by long-range coupling between H-8 and 6 0 -b-F and Xray crystallography after conversion to adenosine derivative 3a. 6,6-Difluoro ketone 15 was synthesized from 14 in a 50% yield using the same procedure. Fluoro ketones 14 and 15 were reduced with sodium borohydride to produce alcohols 16a and 16b, respectively. First, we attempted a direct condensation reaction with 6chloropurine under the Mitsunobu conditions to obtain the desired nucleoside, but it failed to yield the desired condensed product. Direct S N 2 reactions of triflates synthesized from 16a and 16b with a 6-chloropurine anion were also unsuccessful. Thus, we decided to utilize the linear purine base build-up approach [14] . The S N 2 displacement of triflates of 16a and 16b with a linear, less bulky and more powerful nucleophile, NaN 3 proceeded smoothly to yield azido derivatives 17a and 17b, respectively. Catalytic reduction of 17a and 17b with 10% Pd/C yielded amines 18a and 18b, respectively. 6-Fluoroamine 18a was treated with 5-amino-4,6dichloropyrimidine and triethylamine in n-butanol under microwave irradiation to yield 19a (Scheme 4) [14, 16] . However, weaker nucleophile, 6,6-difluoroamine 18b did not give desired product 19b under the same microwave conditions. Thus, we used a stronger electrophile, 4,6-dichloro-5-formamidopyrimidine rather than 5-amino-4,6-dichloropyrimidine, which afforded the desired product 19b in a good yield. The cyclisation of 19a and 19b with diethoxymethyl acetate yielded 6-chloropurine nucleosides 20a and 20b, respectively. The H-8 proton in the 1 H NMR spectrum of 20a was split as a doublet with a small coupling constant (J \u00bc 2.4 Hz), which resulted from the long-range coupling between H-8 and 6 0 -b-F, which confirmed the desired stereochemistry of 6 0 -F, as well as 6-chloropurine.\n\nTreatment of 20a and 20b with 50% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid yielded 6-chloropurine nucleosides 21a and 21b, respectively. For the synthesis of adenosine derivatives, 21a was treated with saturated tert-butanolic ammonia to yield 3a, whereas 21b was converted to 3d using saturated methanolic ammonia solution in a steel bomb. Treatment of 21a and 21b with 40% aqueous methylamine afforded N [6]-methyladenosine nucleosides 3b and 3e, respectively. Hydrolysis of 21a with 1 N HCl in 1,4-dioxane yielded inosine derivative 3c. The structure of 3a was confirmed by singlecrystal X-ray crystallography [19] (Fig. 2 ).\n\nThe synthesized nucleosides 3a-3e were assayed for their inhibitory activity against SAH hydrolase as well as their antiviral activity against the \u00feRNA viruses, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, ZIKV, and CHIKV using cytopathic effect (CPE) reduction assays (Table 1 ) [14] .\n\nThe 6 0 -fluorinated adenosine analogues (n \u00bc 2) 3a and 3b exhibited potent inhibitory activity against SAH hydrolase. 6,6 0 -Difluoroadenosine analogues 3d and 3e also inhibited SAH hydrolase, but to a lesser extent. For example, 6 0 -b-fluoroadenosine analogue 3a was 5.6 times more potent than 6,6 0 -difluoroadenosine analogue 3d. A similar trend was observed with 6 0 -fluorinatedadenosine analogues (n \u00bc 1), 2a and 2b. 6 0 -b-Fluoro-N [6]-methyladenosine 3b showed similar inhibitory activity to that of 6 0 -bfluoroadenosine 3a. A similar trend was observed with 6,6 0difluoro-adenosine 3d and 6,6 0 -difluoro-N [6]-methyladenosine 3e. However, the inosine analogue 3c did not inhibit SAH hydrolase, as no inhibitory activity was observed at the highest dose tested (100 mM).\n\nAmong the compounds tested, 6 0 -b-fluoro-homoaristeromycin 3a showed potent antiviral activity (EC 50 \u00bc 0.12 mM) against CHIKV without noticeable cytotoxicity up to 250 mM (highest dose tested).\n\nThis antiviral activity did not merely seem to depend on the inhibition of SAH hydrolase, as 3a and 3b inhibited the enzyme with 3a displayed anti-CHIKV activity. Regular 6 0 -b-fluoro-aristeromycin 2a was inactive against CHIKV. In addition, although 6,6 0 -difluoroaristeromycin 2b displayed broad-spectrum antiviral activity against several RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, CHIKV, and ZIKV, the corresponding homologated analogue 3d did not exhibit antiviral activity, despite its potent inhibitory activity towards SAH hydrolase. These results demonstrate that other factors besides the inhibitory activity towards SAH hydrolase may be involved in the antiviral activity of this series. More detailed studies on the antiviral activity of 3a and its mode of action will be published elsewhere (Kovacikova et al., submitted).\n\nTo reduce the cytotoxicity of 6 0 -fluorinated aristeromycin analogues 2a and 2b, which is likely due to their 5 0 -phosphorylation by cellular kinases, we designed and synthesized 6 0 -fluorinated homoaristeromycin analogues 3ae3e. These nucleosides were synthesized from D-ribose, using the Michael reaction, stereoselective electrophilic fluorination, and linear purine base build-up as key steps. Among the compounds tested, 6 0 -b-fluoro-homoaristeromycin (3a) showed potent anti-CHIKV activity (EC 50 \u00bc 0.12 mM) without noticeable cytotoxicity at concentrations up to 250 mM, which resulted in a high selectivity index (SI) of more than 2083. This indicates that one carbon homologation may prevent 5 0 -phosphorylation, which results in low cytotoxicity. This homologation had no effect on the inhibitory activity towards SAH hydrolase, as compounds 3a and 2a inhibited this enzyme with similar IC 50 values (0.36 and 0.37 mM). The antiviral activity of 3a was specific for CHIKV and to a lesser extent some other alphaviruses, whereas other viruses have been shown to be sensitive to the SAH hydrolase inhibitors 2a and 2b. This suggests that the potent anti-CHIKV activity of 3a is based on more than merely the inhibition of SAH hydrolase. This study shows that 6 0 -b-fluoro-homoaristeromycin (3a) is a promising new template for the development of anti-CHIKV agents.\n\n, Scheme 4. Synthesis of 6 0 -fluorinated homoaristeromycin analogues 3ae3e. \n\nProton ( 1 H) and carbon 13 C{ 1 H} NMR spectra were obtained on a Bruker AV 400 (400/100 MHz), AMX 500 (500/125 MHz), Jeol JNM-ECA 600 (600/150 MHz) or Bruker AVANCE III 800 (800/200 MHz) spectrometer.

Coupling constants were reported in Hertz. The chemical shifts were reported as ppm (d) relative to the solvent peak. All reactions were routinely carried out under an inert atmosphere of dry nitrogen. IKA RCT basic type heating mantle was used to provide a constant heat source. Microwave-assisted reactions were carried out in sealed vessels using a Biotage Initiator\u00fe US/JPN (part no. 356007) microwave reactor and the reaction temperatures were monitored by an external surface IR sensor. High resolution mass spectra were measured with electrospray-ionization quadrupole time-of-flight (ESI-Q-TOF) techniques. Melting points were recorded on Barnstead electrothermal 9100 instrument and are uncorrected. Reactions were checked by thin layer chromatography (Kieselgel 60 F254, Merck). Spots were detected by viewing under a UV light, and by colorizing with charring after dipping in a p-anisaldehyde solution. The crude compounds were purified by column chromatography on a silica gel (Kieselgel 60, 70e230 mesh, Merck).
