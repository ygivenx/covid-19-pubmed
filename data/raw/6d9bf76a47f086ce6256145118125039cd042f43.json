{"title": "Journal Pre-proof Identification of potential cross-protective epitope between 2019-nCoV and SARS virus", "body": "Recently, a new type of unknown virus causing Severe Acute Respiratory (SARI) was reported in Wuhan City, Hubei province, China (WHO, 2020b) . Infection of this virus was first reported in December, 2019, and origin of the virus was traced back to a large seafood/wide animal market in Wuhan City. The serious clinical symptoms of the viral infection, including fever, dry cough, dyspnea, and pneumonia, may result in progressive respiratory failure and even death. Moreover, the quick spread of the virus has caused epidemic in China, as well as infection cases worldwide. The whole genome sequence of Wuhan new virus (WH-Human_1) was first released on Jan 10, 2020 (Zhang, 2020) , and followed by additional ones released in GISAID (Shu and McCauley, 2017) . Later, this new virus was determined and announced as a new type of coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by WHO (WHO, 2020a).\n\nCoronaviruses (CoVs) are single-stranded RNA viruses which belong to order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, subfamily Coronavirinae (Schoeman and Fielding, 2019) and have been classified into four major groups: \u03b1-CoVs\uff0c\u03b2-CoVs, \u03b3-CoVs and \u03b4-CoVs with 17 subtypes (Saminathan et al., 2014) . CoVs primarily infect wild animals including mammals and birds. They also infect humans and cause various diseases such as upper and lower respiratory tract infections, and respiratory syndromes. Among them, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV can cause serious respiratory syndrome in human (Schoeman and Fielding, 2019) . For instance, the outbreak of SARS in 2003 led to a pandemic with 8906 infected cases and 774 deaths reported worldwide (WHO, 2003) . Meanwhile, the outbreak of MERS confirmed 2229 cases globally, including 791 associated deaths (WHO, 2018).\n\nThe coronaviral genome normally encodes four structural proteins including spike (S) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein, membrane (M2) protein and envelope (E) protein (Schoeman and Fielding, 2019) . S protein contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD), and mediates the attachment of viruses to the surface receptors in host cells, as well as the subsequent fusion between the viral and host cell membranes to facilitate viral entry into host cells (Kirchdoerfer et al., 2016) . Multiple binding and neutralization epitopes have been identified in the S proteins of CoVs (Hwang et al., 2006; Prabakaran et al., 2006; Reguera et al., 2012) , which makes S protein an essential antigen for vaccine design.\n\nLatest bioinformatic analysis indicated that 2019-nCoV is phylogenetically close to SARS-CoV and Bat CoV (BCov) (Xu et al., 2020) . The genomes of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV share over 79% sequence similarity on average (Shi et al., 2020) and their S proteins share 76.47% identity (Xu et al., 2020 ). Yet the antigenicity similarity between them remains unknown and is urgently needed for vaccine design.\n\nCross-reactive epitopes (CREs) are shared or similar epitope regions on the antigen surface among viruses which can be bound or neutralized by the same antibodies.\n\nDesirably, if any CREs were identified, previous antibodies for other CoVs might be re-utilized to facilitate 2019-nCoV intervention.\n\nPreviously, we have developed an algorithm, namely Conformational Epitope (CE)-BLAST, which enables antigenic similarity computation for new emerging pathogens, and have utilized it to successfully identify CREs between the dengue and Zika viruses (Qiu et al., 2018) . In this study, we investigated the antigenic similarity of 2019-nCoV to other coronaviruses based on their spike antigens.\n\nSequences of S protein were downloaded for known coronavirus from Uniprot, and 2019-nCoV sequences were obtained from Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and GISAID (Supplementary data). After data processing, a total of 53 unique S proteins were selected and structure modelled which represent different subtypes of CoVs, including 2019-nCoV (WH-Human_1), 3 SARS strains, 2 BCoV strains and 47 strains from other CoVs (Table S1 ). S proteins of 2019-nCoV and SARS share high structural similarity with a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 1.21\u00c5 according to modeling structures. Individual epitope residues were derived from immune-complexes of CoV S protein, and further merged into 6 epitope regions (Table S2 ). Mapping the epitope regions to 3D structure of S protein of 2019-nCoV demonstrated that, five epitope regions are located in RBD (Fig. S1 ). For each region, CE-BLAST calculates the similarity score of antigenicity between CoV pairs by comparing the physic-chemical difference in 3D adjacent structural regions (Qiu et al., 2018) . The higher the score, the better potential for cross-reaction between the paired antigens.\n\nThe antigenic clustering of the 53 CoV strains was made according to the score matrix for each epitope region (Figs. 1 and S2 ). It can be seen that, though the clustering results may vary slightly for different regions, the antigenicity of CoV S proteins can be generally divided into two major groups. Detailed results for the 6 th epitope region shown in Fig.1A and B displayed the detailed clustering of 2019-nCoV group, as well as the similarity score between them. Antigenically, 2019-nCoV is most similar to SARS-CoV, and followed by BCoV (Fig. 1B) . High similarity scores above 0.80 were detected between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV strains. Considering the default cutoff of 0.75 as antigenically similar (Qiu et al., 2018) , these results indicate the existence of potential CREs between 2019-nCoV and SARS virus.\n\nFurther structural mapping showed the potential CREs in the S protein of 2019-nCoV (Fig. 1C) and SARS (Fig. 1D ). Fig. 1E shows the multiple sequence alignment (MSA) for 2019-nCoV and SARS strains. MSA results of full sequences can be found in Fig. S3 . The potential CREs are conformational epitopes, in which the component residues are close in 3D space but disconnected in protein sequence (Fig.   1E ). Compare to SARS\uff0cmost mutations at CRE sites are residual substitutions of amino acids with similar properties, such as changes of alkaline residue Lys (K) to Arg (R), aromatic residue Phe (F) to Trp (W).\n\nRecently\uff0cthe binding sites of S protein to human ACE2 were identified as residues 455, 486, 493, 501 and 505 (numbered according to 2019-nCoV S protein sequence), which are located near the potential CRE positions (Fig. 1E) . Interestingly, though no direct overlapping, the potential CRE residues are highly adjacent to essential ACE2 binding sites in 3D structure (Shi et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020) , suggesting that neutralization antibodies targeting CRE may also interfere or even block the interaction between the new coronavirus and ACE2 receptor because of steric hindrance (Fig. 1F ). As such, the CRE region recommended here may likely become cross-protective epitope between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV.\n\nIn this study, we used computational method CE-BLAST to identify the potential CREs between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV. CE-BLAST requires epitope structures as input file. Epitopes are usually referred as highly specific and continuous areas on the surface of an antigen which can be recognized and bound by corresponding antibodies.\n\nPrevious analysis on antibody-antigen complexes found that more than 90% of epitope residues appeared conformational (Van Regenmortel, 1996) . As conformational epitopes can be influenced by various factors such as mutation/insertion/deletion, structure change, or neighboring mutations, examining sequence conservation alone is usually not enough to evaluate the similarity of epitope regions among viruses.\n\nIn addition to the epitope similarity between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, we also examined the location and residual distribution for each epitope region in S protein of 2019-nCoV. As Fig. S1 indicates, epitope region 3 is located in S1 domain, which is far from the important ACE2 binding site. For the rest 5 regions, though located in receptor binding domain, some epitope residues become spatially scattered, rather than maintaining the epitope conformation, such as the case in region 1. Thus, region 6 was recommended here for CRE candidates because of its high score, surface continuity, and proximity to essential binding sites of ACE2. Possibility of additional CRE may also exist in other regions of S protein, or other antigens between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV. It is noted that, these potential CREs are highly conformational. Following antibody design and screening is suggested to consider the whole domain, as antibodies derived from linear epitopes might have difficulty in fully recognizing the CRE structures.\n\nIn summary, highly similar epitope was identified computationally between the 2019-nCoV and SARS virus, in the region of the binding site of the S proteins to the human ACE2 receptor. This timely work may shed light on the vaccine intervention for the emergent 2019-nCoV. "}
