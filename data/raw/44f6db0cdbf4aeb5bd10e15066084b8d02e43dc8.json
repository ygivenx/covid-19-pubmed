{"title": "A contribution to the ectoparasite fauna of bats (Mammalia: Chiroptera) in Mindoro Island, Philippines: I. Blood sucking Diptera (Nycteribiidae, Streblidae) and Siphonaptera (Ischnopsyllidae)", "body": "Ectoparasites are externally borne organisms that are well-adapted as blood or lymph feeders (Patterson et al., 1998; Patterson et al., 2007) . Early studies on bat ectoparasites in the Philippines were on various arthropod groups including bat flies (Ferris, 1924a (Ferris, ,b, 1925a Theodor 1955 Theodor , 1963 Maa, 1962 Maa, , 1966 Maa, , 1968 Maa, , 1971 Maa, , 1975 Cuy, 1980a Cuy, ,b, 1981 , fleas (Hopkins and Rothschild, 1956) , chiggers (Womersley, 1957) , ticks (Kohls, 1950) , laelaptoids (Delfinado, 1960) , spinturnicid mites (Delfinado and Baker, 1963; Baker and Delfinado, 1964; Prasad, 1970; Cuy, 1979) and sarcoptid mites (Klompen, 1992) . The most recent literature on bat ectoparasites in * E-mail: jdalvarez1@up.edu.ph the Philippines include those by Zabat and Eduardo (2011) and Alvarez et al. (2015) .\n\nAlthough there is an immense diversity of ectoparasites associated with bats, they are often disregarded or neglected in the study of bat ecology (Messenger et al., 2003) . For instance, only a few studies have reported on the ectoparasites of bats in Mindoro. In his synopsis of Philippine bat flies, Cuy (1980a,b) reported only four species from Mindoro. In addition, Theodor (1963) described two new species (Penicillidia oligacantha and P. acuminata) which was erroneously reported by Ferris (1924b) as Penicillidia jenynsii. In 1981, Cuy also noted the presence of Eucampsipoda philippinensis in the island. Thus, only seven bat fly species are known in Mindoro.\n\nThese ectoparasites are of veterinary importance as potential vectors that enable pathogens and potentially pathogenic microorganisms to bypass barriers such as fur and skin (Messenger et al., 2003; Dick and Patterson, 2006) . In the Philippines, bats were recently shown to harbour parasitic protozoans (Murakoshi et al., 2016) and viruses (Watanabe et al., 2010; Taniguchi et al., 2011; Tsuda et al., 2012) , although their zoonosis are still indefinite. Bat flies are also reported to harbour fungi belonging to Order Laloulbeniales (Blackwell, 1980; Marshall, 1982) .\n\nIn this paper, we provide an update on the bat fly and flea fauna present in Mindoro Island, particularly in the vicinities of Naujan Lake National Park.\n\nMist nets were used to capture bats. Upon removal from the nets, captured bats were placed separately in clean cloth bags for further identification and ectoparasite collection. We followed the treatment of Ingle and Heaney (1992) regarding bat nomenclature. Bats were identified to species level (Table 1) . Voucher specimens were also collected for each species as stipulated in the Gratuitous Permit No. 2011-0002 issued by the Philippine Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), and were deposited at the University of the Philippines Los Ba\u00f1os Museum of Natural History (UPLB MNH), Philippines. Bats that were not sacrificed and preserved as voucher specimens were released back to the wild. Prior to release, bats were fed with sugar-water solution for energy.\n\nBats that were sacrificed were euthanized with ethyl acetate. Afterwards, the surface of the bats was inspected closely with particular attention to body parts typically preferred by certain parasites, i.e. head, patagia and axilla. Ectoparasites were collected with a pair of forceps and placed in vials containing 70% ethanol.\n\nEctoparasites were identified using the identification key of Cuy (1980a,b) and Hopkins and Rothschild (1956) . Streblidae, Ischnopsyllidae and representative individuals of Nycteribiidae were cleared in 10% potassium hydroxide (KOH) and mounted in modified Hoyer's medium. Unmounted specimens of nycteribiids were stored in 70% ethanol. Host and distribution records were based on available literature on ectoparasites of bats in the Philippines (Cuy, 1980a (Cuy, ,b, 1981 Alvarez et al., 2015) . Voucher specimens were deposited at the Entomological Collections, UPLB MNH.\n\nFrom the 11 species of bats that were collected, 83 individuals of ectoparasites, including seven species of nycteribiid flies, five species of streblid flies and one species of ischnopsyllid flea were documented (Table 2 ). This number includes five new host and eight new island records. Raymondia pagodarum (Diptera: Streblidae) is a new record to Mindoro and the Philippines. These species are given below.\n\nFamily Nycteribiidae Subfamily Cyclopodiinae Genus Cyclopodia Cyclopodia garrula Maa 1968 Cuy, 1980b Cuy, , 1981 ) Cuy, 1980b Cuy, , 1981 ) Cuy, 1980b Cuy, , 1981 ) + Eucampsipoda sundaica + (Cuy, 1980b (Cuy, , 1981 ) + Eucampsipoda philippinensis + (Cuy, 1980b (Cuy, , 1981 ) Theodor, 1963; Cuy, 1981 ) \u2212 Penicillidia acuminata + (Theodor, 1963; Cuy, 1981 This species was previously recorded on Harpyionycteris whiteheadi (Cuy, 1980b) and Ptenochirus jagori (Alvarez et al., 2015; present study) . It is endemic to the Philippines and previously recorded only from Mindanao (Maa, 1968) and Luzon (Alvarez et al., 2015) . The current collection represents a new distribution record for C. garrula.\n\nSpecimens examined: On P. jagori, one female (UPLBMNH DIP-1588).\n\nPreviously recorded from the pteropodids Pteropus vampyrus, P. hypomelanus, P. speciosus, Acerodon jubatus and Rousettus amplexicaudatus (Cuy, 1980b (Cuy, , 1981 , this bat fly species is newly recorded on Pteropus pumilus, a bat species endemic to the Philippines. Cyclopodia horsfieldi is widespread in Thailand, Cambodia and Indonesia. In the Philippines, it is recorded in Luzon, Mindoro, Palawan (Busuanga, Culion, Balabac), Leyte, Panay, Guimaras and Mindanao (Camiguin, Jolo) (Cuy, 1980b) .\n\nSpecimens examined: On P. pumilus, four males and eight females (UPLBMNH DIP-1589 to 1600).\n\nEucampsipoda inermis is a parasite of the pteropodids Rousettus amplexicudatus and Eonycteris spelaea. In the Philippines, it is distributed in Luzon, Catanduanes, Mindoro, Palawan (Busuanga, Balabac), Samar, Leyte, Cebu, Negros and Mindanao (Samal, Jolo). It is also widely distributed in Myanmar, Thailand and Indonesia (Cuy, 1980b) .\n\nSpecimens examined: On R. amplexicaudatus, 13 males and six females. (UPLBMNH DIP-1601 to 1613, 1615 to 1620); on E. spelaea, one male (UPLBMNH DIP-1614).\n\nThis endemic species was previously recorded from Luzon, Leyte, Mindoro, Negros, Polillo and Marinduque. Host records include Eonycteris robusta, Hipposideros diadema, R. amplexicaudatus, Miniopterus schreibersii (Cuy, 1980b (Cuy, , 1981 and P. jagori (Alvarez et al., 2015) .\n\nSpecimens examined: On R. amplexicaudatus, one male, one female (UPLBMNH DIP-1633, 1634).\n\nEucampsipoda sundaica is parasitic on R. amplexicaudatus and E. spelaea (Cuy, 1980b) . This species is widely distributed in India, Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines (Luzon, Mindoro, Palawan, Leyte, Negros and Mindanao) (Cuy, 1980b (Cuy, , 1981 .\n\nSpecimens examined: On E. spelaea, two females (UPLBMNH DIP-1621, 1622).\n\nLeptocyclopodia ferrarii mabuhai Maa 1975 This subspecies is recorded on the fruit bats Cynopterus brachyotis, P. jagori, Haplonycteris fischeri, Macroglossus minimus, E. spelaea and the insectivorous bat H. diadema. This endemic subspecies is distributed in Luzon, Leyte, Panay, Guimaras, Negros, Camiguin, Mindanao and recently reported for the first time in Mindoro.\n\nSpecimens examined: On C. brachyotis, one male, two females (UPLBMNH DIP-1623 , 1624 , 2431 . Theodor 1959 This is another endemic species that is parasitic on the fruit bats P. jagori, C. brachyotis, R. amplexicaudatus, E. robusta and M. minimus. Cuy (1980b) noted that this species is distributed in Luzon, Mindoro, Leyte, Bohol, Cebu, Negros, Camiguin and Mindanao.\n\nSpecimens examined: On P. jagori. two males and one female (UPLBMNH DIP-1625, 1627, 1628); on C. brachyotis, one female (UPLBMNH DIP-1626).\n\nMegastrebla parvior Maa 1962 In the synopsis of Cuy (1980a) , Megastrebla parvior is parasitic on the vespertilionids Miniopterus australis and M. schreibersii, the hipposiderid H. diadema and the pteropodids R. amplexicaudatus, E. spelaea and E. robusta. In the current survey, it is newly recorded from the pteropodid M. minimus. This species is also newly reported in Mindoro, adding to its distribution in Luzon, Leyte, Negros, Cebu, Palawan, Balabac, Mindanao and Samal (Cuy, 1980a) . It is also found in India, Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia (Cuy, 1981) .\n\nSpecimens examined: On M. minimus, one male (UPLBMNH DIP-1630); on R. amplexicaudatus, one male and two females (UPLBMNH DIP-1629 , 1631 , 1632 .\n\nThis species is common in the Oriental and Australian regions. In the Philippines, it is distributed in Luzon, Polillo, Tablas, Mindanao and in this study, it is recorded for the first time in Mindoro. In his account on the bat flies of the Philippines, Cuy (1980a) \n\nThis is an endemic species previously recorded only from the hipposiderid H. diadema and the pteropodid E. robusta. This study reports its presence in R. arcuatus. In addition to its record in Luzon and Mindanao (Cuy, 1980a) , its distribution extends to Mindoro.\n\nSpecimens examined: On R. arcuatus, one male and two females (UPLBMNH-DIP-2444 to 2446).\n\nThe occurrence of this streblid bat fly in the Philippines is reported for the first time, extending its known geographical distribution. In the Oriental region, this species has overlapping distribution with R. pseudopagodarum but extends to tropical South Pacific islands such as the Solomon Islands, Papua (New Guinea) and New Britain (Maa, 1962) . In this study, it was recorded only from Hipposideros bicolor.\n\nSpecimens examined: On H. bicolor, three females (UPLBMNH-DIP-2403 to 2405).\n\nThis species is widely distributed in the Southeast Asia region, including Borneo, China, Malaya and the Philippines. In the country, it is recorded from Palawan, Negros, Mindanao, Luzon and currently in Mindoro (additional record). In the Philippines, it is known to parasitize R. arcuatus, R. rufus, R. virgo, Hipposideros galeritus (=H. diadema), Miniopterus schreibersii, M. australis, R. amplexicaudatus and E, spelaea (Cuy, 1980a) .\n\nSpecimens examined: On R. arcuatus, one male, nine females (UPLBMNH-DIP-2432 to 2436, 2439 to 2443).\n\nThis species is similar to T. breviceps but can be distinguished by the form of the clasper and crochet in males, and the large sinus and small number of bristles (\u22646) on sternite VII in females. The two species also overlap in their host species.\n\nThaumapsylla longiforceps is distributed in the Oriental and Australian regions. In its Oriental range, it is reported from Miniopterus tristis (Philippines), R. amplexicaudatus (Java) and C. brachyotis (Borneo) (Hopkins and Rothschild, 1956) . Its distribution extends to New Guinea where it is a parasite of H. diadema (Hopkins and Rothschild, 1956) . This is the first record of this species in Mindoro. Previously, it was collected from Montalban, Rizal Province in Luzon Island (Hopkins and Rothschild, 1956) .\n\nSpecimens examined: On R. amplexicaudatus, three males, one female (UPLBMNH-SIP-0001 to 0004).\n\nPrior to this survey, there were only seven species of ectoparasites recorded from bats in Mindoro. For the recent collection, we documented an additional seven species, including R. pagodarum, which is a new record to Mindoro and the Philippines. Thus, 14 species of bat ectoparasites are currently known from the island. This also includes four species and one subspecies endemic to the Philippines. This number, however, is probably an underestimate and subsequent collections of other bat species will likely add to the ectoparasite fauna of Mindoro.\n\nThe pteropodid fauna of Mindoro island has amongst the most endemic species compared to any other island in the Philippines, with two endemic species, Desmalopex microleucopterus (Esselstyn et al., 2008) and Styloctenium mindorensis (Esselstyn, 2007) . However, we were only able to capture four pteropodid species. Other pteropodids known from the island include A. jubatus, D. microleucopterus, E. robusta, H. fischeri, H. whiteheadi, P. vampyrus and S. mindorensis (Heaney et al., 2010) . From these bat species that were not collected in the current study, it is possible to document at least 16 species of bat flies which are not previously reported on the island. Information on the ectoparasites of the recently described species of bats (i.e. D. microleucopterus and S. mindorensis) from Mindoro is non-existent.\n\nDuring our survey, we were able to capture only five species of insectivorous bats. However, a further 21 species of bats have been recorded in Mindoro. These insect bats are usually cave dwelling and we failed to document any cave within the vicinities of Naujan Lake. More extensive collections are necessary to document more ectoparasite species that could be new host and locality records or new to science. Large samples are also necessary to determine and establish patterns of host-parasite relationships. During our sampling, we used the typical mist nets, which are less efficient in capturing echolocating bats that easily evade these nets. Thus, use of multiple methods to capture host bats is recommended for future studies. in specimen preparations. Special thanks to the anonymous reviewer for improving the manuscript."}
