{"title": "Integrated Blood Barcode Chips", "body": "A polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) mold containing 13-20 parallel microfluidic channels, with each channel conveying a different DNA oligomer as DEAL code, was fabricated by soft lithography. The PDMS mold was bonded to a polylysine-coated glass slide via thermal treatment at 80\u00b0C for 2 hours. The polyamine surfaces permit significantly higher DNA loading than do more traditional aminated surfaces. DNA \u201cbars\u201d of 2 micrometers in width have been successfully patterned using this technique. In the present study, a 20-micrometer (\u03bcm) channel width was chosen because the fluorescence microarray scanner we used has a resolution of 5\u03bcm. Nevertheless, the current design already resulted in a DNA barcode array an order of magnitude denser than conventional microarrays fabricated by pin-spotting. The coding DNA solutions (A-M for the cancer serum test and AA-HH for the finger-prick blood test) prepared in 1xPBS were flowed into individual channels, and then allowed to evaporate completely. Finally, the PDMS was peeled off and the substrate with DNA barcode arrays was baked at 80\u00b0C for 2-4 hours. The DNA solution concentration was \u223c100\u03bcM in all experiments except in the hCG test, leading to a high loading of \u223c6\u00d71013molecules/cm2 (assuming 50% was collected onto substrate).\n\nThe fabrication of PDMS devices for the IBBCs was accomplished through a two-layer soft lithography approach. The control layer was molded from a SU8 2010 negative photoresist (\u223c20um in thickness) silicon master using a mixture of GE RTV 615 PDMS prepolymer part A and part B (5:1). The flow layer was fabricated by spin-casting the pre-polymer of GE RTV 615 PDMS part A and part B (20:1) onto a SPR 220 positive photoresist master at \u223c2000rpm for 1minute. The SPR 220 mold was \u223c17 \u03bcm in height after rounding via thermal treatment. The control layer PDMS chip was then carefully aligned and placed onto the flow layer, which was still situated on its silicon master, and an additional 60min thermal treatment at 80\u00b0C was performed to enable bonding. Afterward, this two-layer PDMS chip was cut off the flow layer master and access holes were drilled. Finally, the tow-layer PDMS chip was thermally bonded onto the barcode-patterned glass slide (described above), yielding a completed integrated blood barcode chip (IBBC). In this chip, the DEAL barcode stripes are orientated perpendicular to the microfluidic assay channels. Typically, 8-12 identical units were integrated in a single chip with the dimensions of 2.5cm\u00d77cm.\n\nThe stored serum samples from 11 breast cancer patients(all female) and 11 prostate cancer patients(all male) were acquired from Asterand. Nineteen out of 22 patients were Caucasian and the remaining three were Asian, Hispanic and African-American. The medical history is summarized in the supplementary materials.\n\nThe IBBCs were first blocked with the buffer solution for 30-60 minutes. The buffer solution prepared was 1% w/v Bovine Serum Albumin Fraction V (Sigma) in 150 mM 1x PBS without calcium/magnesium salts (Irvine Scientific). The fluid loading was conducted using a Tygon\u00ae plastic tubing that is interfaced to the IBBC inlet with a 23 gauge metal pin. The Fluidigm\u00ae solenoid unit was exploited to control the pressure on/off for both control valves and flow channels. A pressure of 8-10 psi was applied to actuate the valves, whereas the loading of fluid into assay channels was carried out with a lower pressure (0.5-3psi) depending on the channel flow resistance and the desired flow rate. Then DNA-antibody conjugates (\u223c50-100nM) were flowed through the plasma assay channels for \u223c30-45min. This step transformed the DNA arrays into capture-antibody arrays. Unbound conjugates were washed off by flowing buffer solution through the channels. At this step, the IBBC was ready for the blood test. Two blood samples prepared as mentioned above were flowed into the IBBCs within 1 minute of collection. The IBBC quickly separated plasma from whole blood, and the plasma proteins of interest were captured in the assay zone where DEAL barcode arrays were placed. This whole process from finger-prick to plasma protein capture took <10 minutes. In the cancer-patient serum experiment, the as-received serum samples were flowed into IBBCs without any pre-treament (i.e. no purification or dilution). Afterwards, a mixture of biotin-labeled detection antibodies (\u223c50-100nM) for the entire protein panel and the fluorescence Cy5-straptavidin conjugates (\u223c100nM) were flowed sequentially into IBBCs to complete the DEAL immunoassay. The unbound fluorescence probes were rinsed off by flowing the buffer solution for 10 minutes. At last, the PDMS chip was removed from the glass slide. The slide was immediately rinsed in \u00bd x PBS solution and deionized water, and then dried with a nitrogen gun. Finally, the DEAL barcode slide was scanned by a microarray scanner.\n\nAll the barcode array slides used in quantation were scanned using an Axon Genepix 4000B two-color laser microarray scanner at the same instrumental settings \u2014100% and 33% for the laser power of 635nm and 532nm, respectively. Optical gains are 800 and 700 for 635nm and 532nm, respectively. The brightness and contrast were set at 87 and 88. The output JPEG images were carefully skewed and resized to fit the standard mask design of barcode array. Then, an image processing software, NIH imageJ, was employed to produce intensity line profiles of barcodes in all assay channels. Finally, all the line profile data files were loaded into home-developed program embedded as an excel macro to generate a spread sheet that lists the average intensities of all 13 bars in each of 20 barcodes. The means and standard divisions were computed using the Microcal origin. Non-supervised clustering of patients was performed using the software Cluster and the heat map was generated from the software Treeview, both developed by the M. Eisen\u2019s group. To assess the significance of two patient (sub)groups, student t analysis was performed on selected proteins and all p-values were calculated at significance level of 0.05 if not specified."}
