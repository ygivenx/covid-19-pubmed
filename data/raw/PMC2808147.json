{"title": "Fluorescence Competition Assay Measurements of Free Energy Changes for RNA Pseudoknots\u2020", "body": "Oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (IDT), which purified them by HPLC and tested molecular weights by mass spectroscopy. Fluorescent oligonucleotides had fluorescein attached by a linker of six carbons (6-FAM). The concentrations of single-strand oligonucleotides were calculated from 80 \u00b0C absorbance and single-strand extinction coefficients, approximated by IDT by a nearest-neighbor model (56,57).\n\nOptical melting was performed in standard melting buffer [1.0 M NaCl, 20 mM sodium cacodylate, and 0.5 mM Na2EDTA (pH 7.0)]. Single strands for forming non-self-complementary duplexes were mixed in 1:1 molar ratios, then annealed at 85 \u00b0C for 2 min, and cooled to 5 \u00b0C at a rate of \u223c5 \u00b0C/min. Absorbance versus temperature melting curves were measured at 280 nm with a heating rate of 1 \u00b0C/min on a Beckman Coulter DU 640 spectrophotometer controlled by a Beckman Coulter high-performance temperature controller cooled with water flow. Duplexes were melted over a 60-fold range in oligonucleotide concentration. Data were analyzed by fitting the transition to a two-state model with sloping baselines using a nonlinear least-squares program (58,59).\n\nFRET-based titration assays have been used to directly detect free energy differences between a \u201creference\u201d structure and a related \u201ctest\u201d structure of DNA, which allows calculation of the free energy for the test structure (53). Figure 2A illustrates the application of this method for measuring the free energy of an RNA pseudoknot. The pseudoknot (P) is labeled with fluorescein at the 3\u2032 end and acts as the FRET donor strand. The fluorescence intensity for the pseudoknot at 10 nM in 250 \u03bcL of standard melting buffer is measured and used as the starting point of the titration. In comparison to the BWYV pseudoknot reported elsewhere (44,45), which is named 437D PSK (Figure 1B), there is a GC dangling 3\u2032 end here (Figure 2A), so the fluorescein is not directly adjacent to the pseudoknot. This construct is called PSK 1. The free energy contribution for this dangling 3\u2032 end was measured by melting the model duplexes 5\u2032CUGGC/3\u2032FCGGACCG and 5\u2032CUGGC/3\u2032GACCG, where F is fluorescein. To measure the free energy change for the formation of PSK 1, a strand was designed to be Watson\u2212Crick complementary to the sequence at the 3\u2032 end of the pseudoknot so that its binding could compete with formation of stem 2 and thus unfold the pseudoknot. This strand was labeled with a quencher (Iowa Black FQ) to serve as an acceptor and named competitor 1. Titrations were performed in 1.0 M NaCl, 20 mM sodium cacodylate, and 0.5 mM Na2EDTA, at pH 6.0, 7.0, or 8.0. Aliquots of a mixture of the concentrated acceptor strand and 10 nM donor strand were added to a 10 nM donor strand solution, so the donor concentration remains constant. Aliquots were added until the fluorescence intensity remained constant within experimental error. There were typically 10 points (at least seven points) in the titration curves, from point zero to saturation. In this process, the competitor strand will break the pseudoknot and form a reference structure, whose free energy can be predicted with the INN-HB model (39) combined with hairpin loop (60) and dangling end (61,62) free energy parameters (see the Supporting Information).\n\nFollowing Gelfand et al. (53), for each titration point, the solution to be measured at pH 6.0 or 7.0 was annealed for 3 min at 75 \u00b0C in a water bath and then equilibrated at 37 \u00b0C for at least 15 min in a 4 mm \u00d7 4 mm quartz cuvette in a HORIBA Jobin Yvon Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer. To check for equilibrium, fluorescence intensity was measured for 150 s at intervals of 5 min. If no change was observed between two measurements, then the average over the last 150 s was taken as the fluorescence intensity of the titration point. Fluorescence was excited at 494 nm with a 2 nm band-pass, and emission was measured at the peak of the emission, 520 nm, with a 1 nm band-pass.\n\nFor titration points in buffer at pH 8.0, the annealing process was omitted to avoid hydrolysis, and the measuring time for fluorescence intensity was shortened to 30 s to avoid photobleaching. The time for equilibrating was at least 30 min. To check for equilibrium, fluorescence intensity was measured at intervals of 10 min. All other operations were the same as in buffers at pH 6.0 or 7.0.\n\nDuplex formation quenches the fluorescence by up to 30% of a 3\u2032-dangling fluorescein directly adjacent to a terminal G\u2212C base pair. Thus, a fluorescence competition assay does not require a non-nucleotide quencher. This permits a fluorescence competition assay in which only the short competition strand is labeled, which is more economical than synthesizing fluorescently labeled pseudoknots (Figure 2B). In this case, the equilibrium is forced to shift to the reference structure with an increase in the pseudoknot concentration. The free energy of this reference structure can be calculated by combination of optical melting results with duplex 5\u2032GAACAAACGG/3\u2032AACUUGUUUGF (Table 1) and the INN-HB model (39) with hairpin loop (60) and coaxial stacking (63) free energy parameters (see the Supporting Information).\n\nBecause the 5\u2032 end dangling GG used for crystallography is not related to the competition and it is expected to stabilize stem 1 of the pseudoknot by only 0.4 kcal/mol (61,62,64), it was eliminated to give the construct called PSK 2 (Figure 2B). Note, however, that the 5\u2032 nucleotide is labeled C3 to match with the 437D PSK numbering in Figure 1B.\n\nIn FCA experiments, the initial solution was the fluorescein-labeled competitor 2 at 2 nM in 250 \u03bcL of standard melting buffer and its fluorescence intensity was measured for the zero point of titration. Aliquots of a mixture of concentrated pseudoknot and 2 nM competitor 2 were added. Then, the solution was annealed at 75 \u00b0C for 3 min and equilibrated for at least 15 min at 37 \u00b0C. The relative fluorescence intensity was measured in the same way as in FCA/DA experiments except with a 4 nm emission band-pass.\n\nBelow is the derivation of the equation for fluorescence intensity as a function of solution composition for FCA titrations. The derivation for FCA/DA is similar. Figure 3 illustrates the equilibria involved in the calculations.\n\nRelative to fluorescein, the fluorescence from nucleotides is very low and can be neglected. The fluorescence comes from fluorescein in the free competitor single strand (C) or reference structure (RS). Therefore, the fluorescence intensity, F, iswhere fC and fRS are the fluorescence efficiencies for the competitor and reference structure, respectively, [C] is the concentration of free competitor strand, and [RS] is the concentration of the reference structure. The total concentration of the competitor strand isFrom eqs 1 and 2\n\nIn the solution, the pseudoknot RNA could be in different forms: pseudoknot ([P] for the concentration), reference structure, and hairpin ([H] for its concentration). Therefore, the total concentration of pseudoknot RNA can be expressed asOther possible conformations of the pseudoknot could be added to the equation if needed. The equilibrium constant, Kc, for the competition (Figure 3A) can be written asFrom eqs 2, 4, and 5Equation 6 can be rewritten asSolving for [RS] givesBecause [RS] cannot be larger than [C]T or [P]T, the only valid solution isVia substitution of [RS] in eq 3 by eq 9, the fluorescence intensity can be expressed as\n\nThe value of fC is known from the fluorescence of the competitor solution; [C]T and [P]T are the concentrations added, so the titration curve was fit to fRS and Kc by the Newton\u2212Gaussian method as implemented in Statistical Analysis System (SAS) from SAS Institute Inc.\n\nFigure 4B is a free energy diagram for the competition. In the solution, there is the equilibrium between pseudoknot and hairpin, with equilibrium constant K1:The free energy difference between pseudoknot and hairpin is \u0394G10:where \u0394GPSK0 is the free energy change for forming the pseudoknot from random coil and \u0394GHP0 is the free energy change for forming the hairpin from random coil.\n\nThere is also the equilibrium among hairpin, competitor, and reference structure, with equilibrium constant K2:\n\nThe free energy difference between reference structure and hairpin is \u0394G20:where \u0394GRS0 is the free energy change for forming the reference structure from random coil.\n\nSubstituting [P] in eq 5 by eq 11 givesTherefore\n\nRelating the equilibrium constants to free energy changeswhere R is the gas constant (1.987 cal K\u22121 mol\u22121) and T is the absolute temperature. ThereforeIf \u2212(\u0394G20 \u2212 \u0394GC0) > 1.2 kcal/mol, then\n\nSubstituting \u0394G20 in eq 21 by eq 14 givesSubstituting \u0394G10 in eq 12 by eq 22 gives\u0394GRS0 and \u0394GHP0 can be calculated with the combination of melting model duplexes (Table 1) and the INN-HB model (39,40) with hairpin loop (60), dangling end (61,62), and coaxial stacking (63) free energy parameters (see the Supporting Information). \u0394GC0 is measured with the FCA titration. Thus, the free energy change from hairpin to pseudoknot, \u0394G10, and the free energy change for forming the pseudoknot from the unfolded RNA, \u0394GPSK0, can be determined. \n\nTo test for binding between free fluorescein and RNA, the fluorescence of free fluorescein titrated into standard melting buffer (buffer/fluorescein) was compared to the fluorescence of free fluorescein titrated into RNA single strand (5\u2032GAACAAACGG3\u2032) or duplex (5\u2032GAACAAACGG/3\u2032CUUGUUUG) (buffer/oligonucleotide/fluorescein) at 100 nM. Presumably, intercalation of the dye would change the emission profile or the intensity of emission. In titrations with 2, 20, 100, and 1000 nM fluorescein, however, the fluorescence from the buffer/fluorescein solution was always within experimental error of the fluorescence from the buffer/oligonucleotide/fluorescein solution.\n\nThe fluorescence of fluorescein covalently linked to the 5\u2032 end of an oligonucleotide is quenched upon duplex formation (Figure 2B and 2D). Evidently, fluorescein interacts with the helix, presumably by stacking and possibly forming hydrogen bonds. UV melting experiments reveal that covalently linked fluorescein stabilizes a duplex (Table 1), which also indicates interaction between fluorescein and the helix. A fluorescein\u2212quencher pair also stabilizes a duplex (Table 1). These interactions must be taken into account when the free energy for the reference structure with a pseudoknot is calculated. Values and increments from Tm\u22121 versus ln([C]T/4) plots in Table 1 were used for the calculation of pseudoknot free energy.\n\nPanels C and D of Figure 2 show fluorescence titrations for FCA/DA on PSK 1 and FCA on PSK 2, respectively, along with the fitted curves for each experiment at pH 7.0. The free energy diagrams including free energy change calculations are shown in panels A and B of Figure 4, respectively. To compare with previous measurements on 437D PSK (44,45), the predicted free energy increment (62) for the two 5\u2032 dangling G residues on 437D PSK (Figure 1B) was included in the predicted \u0394G37,HP0 for the FCA experiment, and for the FCA/DA experiment, the total free energy of the pseudoknot was made less favorable by the free energy increment for the 3\u2032 dangling GCF in PSK 1 (see the Supporting Information, II). The table in Figure 4 summarizes the results from the two versions of fluorescence competition assays. The two titration methods give similar results for \u0394G37,437D PSK0 and \u0394G37,437D PSK\u2212HP0, even though they employ very different concentrations of the pseudoknot and different competitors. The results suggest that intermolecular interactions of the pseudoknot sequences are negligible under the experimental conditions.\n\nThe table in Figure 4 lists the free energy changes of the pseudoknot to stem 1 hairpin for 437D PSK (\u0394G37,437D PSK\u2212HP0) measured by FCA/DA at pH 6.0, 7.0, and 8.0 and 37 \u00b0C. The values are 4.0, 3.5, and 2.8 kcal/mol, respectively. The pseudoknot is destabilized as the pH increases. These results agree with expectations from the BWYV pseudoknot crystal structure (PDB entry 437D). In the crystal structure, there is a quadruple-base interaction with a hydrogen bond between protonated C8 and G12 at the joint of stems 1 and 2 (Figure 1C). An increasing pH will weaken this interaction and destabilize the pseudoknot. The FCA/DA results, however, give a destabilization of 1.2 \u00b1 0.6 kcal/mol between pH 6.0 and 8.0 at 37 \u00b0C, whereas previous measurements by DSC and optical melting at temperatures between 49 and 82 \u00b0C gave destabilizations of 3.4 \u00b1 1.1 and 2.6 \u00b1 1.1 kcal/mol, respectively, when extrapolated to 37 \u00b0C (44).\n\nFree energies of BWYV PSK 2 mutants in the stem 2\u2212loop 1 region were measured by FCA. Figure 5 summarizes the mutations. Except for PSK-CG, 5\u2032FGUUUGUUC3\u2032 was the competition strand, i.e., the same as for PSK 2. For PSK-CG, the competition strand was 5\u2032FCGUUUGUUC3\u2032, to allow saturated binding at convenient concentrations of the pseudoknot. Table 2 lists the measured \u0394G370 values for the transition from pseudoknot to hairpin (PSK\u2212HP) and from unfolded RNA to pseudoknot (PSK), along with predictions by the statistical polymer model (SPM) of Cao and Chen (42) and the NUPACK model (33). The value of \u0394G37,PSK\u2212HP0 shows the relative stability of the pseudoknot to the stem 1 hairpin, which is important for the function of many pseudoknots (18,27,30,31). Some mutations make the free energy of the pseudoknot more favorable, but it may not make the pseudoknot more stable relative to the corresponding hairpin and vice versa. Table 2 also lists the changes (\u0394\u0394G370) of \u0394G370 for the transitions due to mutations to PSK 2. This provides insight into the effects of different factors on pseudoknot stability.\n\nThe 437D PSK thermodynamics have been measured by Nixon and Giedroc using UV melting and DSC (44) and by Soto et al. using UV melting (45). Nixon and Giedroc conducted the measurement in 0.5 M K+ buffer (pH 6.0, 7.0, and 8.0) with a pseudoknot concentration of 34.8 \u03bcM. Soto et al. used 0.5 M Na+ buffer (pH 7.0) with \u223c1.8 \u03bcM pseudoknot and reported their results for \u0394H0 and Tm, which allows \u0394G370 to be calculated from the relation \u0394G370 = \u0394H0 \u2212 310.15\u0394H0/Tm. Both groups obtained their thermodynamics from deconvoluting UV melting or DSC curves with overlapping transitions. They assign the melting curves in the same way, i.e., as three two-state transitions in the thermal denaturation: F \u2192 PK \u2192 S1 \u2192 U, where F is a completely folded pseudoknot, including tertiary interactions, PK is the secondary structure of the pseudoknot, S1 is the stem 1 hairpin corresponding to the pseudoknot, and U is the completely unfolded pseudoknot. The sum of the first two transitions (F \u2192 PK \u2192 S1) corresponds to the 437D PSK\u2212HP transition measured here. The sum of \u0394G370 for the F \u2192 PK and PK \u2192 S1 transitions is listed under \u0394G370 for the 437D PSK\u2212HP transition in Table 3. As Soto et al. stated, there are \u223c10 \u00b0C differences in the melting temperatures for both the F \u2192 PK and PK \u2192 S1 transitions between the two reports, which could be due to the different cations (67\u221269). This produces a difference of 1.6 kcal/mol in \u0394G37,PSK\u2212HP0 between the measurements of the two groups.\n\nThe 437D PSK sequence (Figure 1B) has different termini compared to the sequences used for FCA/DA and FCA experiments (Figure 2). As described in Results, the FCA/DA and FCA results were adjusted to account for these differences (see the Supporting Information, II). The resulting free energies for 437D PSK, stem 1 hairpin, and 437D PSK\u2212HP transitions are listed in Table 3. The average value of \u0394G370 measured by FCA/DA and FCA for the 437D PSK\u2212HP transition in 1.0 M Na+ is 3.2 kcal/mol. This value is 2.4 kcal/mol more favorable than the value from averaging UV melting and DSC experiments in 0.5 M Na+ or K+ buffer. The higher cation concentration is expected to stabilize the RNA pseudoknot structure relative to the corresponding hairpin, but it apparently destabilizes it.\n\nAs the pH was increased from 6.0 to 7.0 and from 7.0 to 8.0, the pseudoknot was destabilized by 0.5 \u00b1 0.4 and 0.7 \u00b1 0.4 kcal/mol for FCA/DA measurements, by 1.2 \u00b1 1.2 and 1.3 \u00b1 0.5 kcal/mol for UV melting measurements, and by 2.3 \u00b1 1.2 and 1.1 \u00b1 0.5 kcal/mol for DSC measurements, respectively (44). FCA/DA, UV melting, and DSC results agree that an increasing pH destabilizes the BWYV pseudoknot as expected from the crystal structure (PDB entry 437D).\n\nA difference between the fluorescence competition assay (FCA and FCA/DA) experiments and thermal melting (UV melting and DSC) is the temperature of the experiment. The FCA/DA and FCA experiments were conducted at 37 \u00b0C, while \u0394G370 values of the 437D PSK from UV melting and DSC were extrapolated from the melting temperatures, which were \u223c60 and \u223c80 \u00b0C for the first two transitions, respectively, at 0.5 M Na+ or K+. In the extrapolations to 37 \u00b0C, the enthalpy and entropy changes were considered temperature-independent; i.e., the heat capacity change (\u0394Cp0) was assumed to be zero. In general, however, the unfolding of RNA is accompanied by a non-zero \u0394Cp0, which can be as large as hundreds of calories per kelvin per mole per base pair or base triple (70). If \u0394Cp0 is approximated as a temperature-independent constant, thenThus, if \u0394Cp0 is taken into consideration, then the extrapolated thermodynamic parameters will vary. For example, a short self-complementary duplex (5\u2032CCGG)2 has a \u0394Cp0 of \u2212382 cal K\u22121 mol\u22121 for folding (58), and \u0394G370 is 1.0 kcal/mol less favorable when taking \u0394Cp0 into account than without it if \u0394G370 is extrapolated from 80 \u00b0C (71). Optical melting of the BWYV pseudoknot in different Na+ concentrations provides results at different temperatures (45). While the error limits on \u0394HT0 do not allow a reliable value for \u0394Cp0 to be determined, linear least-squares fittings of listed \u0394HT0 values versus Tm at 40, 74, 120, 204, and 504 mM Na+ for F \u2192 PK (Tm range of 48\u221267 \u00b0C), PK \u2192 S1 (Tm range of 63\u221284 \u00b0C), and S1 \u2192 U (Tm range of 81\u221292 \u00b0C) transitions provide \u0394Cp0 estimates of \u2212700, \u2212300, and \u221220 cal K\u22121 mol\u22121 for unfolding, respectively (Supporting Information). If these \u0394Cp0 values are included, then the average \u0394G370 calculated by eq 26 for the PSK\u2212HP transition from UV melting and DSC experiments in 0.5 M Na+ or K+ buffer will be less favorable by 1.4 kcal/mol relative to the average \u0394G370 without considering \u0394Cp0 values. However, for the S1 \u2192 U transition, the \u0394G370 difference with \u0394Cp0 considered is within 0.1 kcal/mol of that without considering \u0394Cp0.\n\nThere are a number of other possible reasons for differences in absolute values for \u0394G370 determined by fluorescence competition and thermal melting. Nevertheless, the increments determined by any particular method for changes in sequence or conditions should be reliable at the temperature at which the experiment was conducted.\n\nFor FCA/DA and FCA, an important source of error is the estimation of the free energy for the reference structure. Here, the stem 1 hairpin is an important part of the reference structure. For 437D PSK, the stability of the stem 1 hairpin is estimated from the INN-HB model (39) combined with hairpin loop (60) and dangling end (61,62) free energy parameters to be \u22128.2 kcal/mol at 37 \u00b0C. Using the \u0394H0 and Tm obtained by fitting of the three thermal denaturation curves for this transition from UV melting and DSC experiments (44,45) produced values of \u22128.3, \u22127.8, and \u22128.4 kcal/mol giving an average of \u22128.2 kcal/mol at 37 \u00b0C, consistent with the estimate from the INN-HB model (Table 3). Both calculations ignore any \u0394Cp0 contributions, but both rely on measurements of hairpins with Tm values of >60 \u00b0C (44,45,72,73). Moreover, when the \u0394H0 values obtained at different salt concentrations and therefore Tm values (45) are plotted versus Tm, the apparent \u0394Cp0 is \u221220.4 cal K\u22121 mol\u22121, which is negligible. The NUPACK program used the INN-HB model and also predicted a \u0394G370 of \u22128.2 kcal/mol for the stem 1 hairpin by using the latest version of free energy parameters (39,60\u221262). The heuristic program, Kinefold (37), estimates the free energy of the stem 1 hairpin as \u22127.3 kcal/mol, which is 0.9 kcal/mol less favorable than the values from the current INN-HB model and experiments.\n\nThe experimental results for pseudoknots can be compared to predictions (Table 3). For calculating the free energy of a pseudoknot (see the Supporting Information), both the SPM (42) and NUPACK (33) models consider that stem free energies are one of the main contributions, and they are estimated by the INN-HB model (39). Both models consider that the loops make unfavorable contributions to the free energy of the pseudoknot. The NUPACK model, however, counts a penalty for initiating the pseudoknot, then assigns penalty values to each base in the loop without considering loop sequence or position, and assigns penalty values to each base pair that borders the interior of the pseudoknot, without considering the base pair type, loop\u2212stem correlation, or tertiary interactions. Similar to Aalberts\u2019 model (26), but with volume exclusion considered, SPM calculates the entropies for the loops with a statistical mechanical polymer model that treats loops 1 and 3 differently and takes the entropies (\u0394Sloops0) as a penalty. Conformational states allowed by different lengths of stems and loops were considered. Also, the entropy for assembling the stem\u2212loop motifs (\u0394Sassemble0) is counted as a penalty. As with the NUPACK model, loop sequence and tertiary interactions are not included. The two models predict a similar free energy for 437D PSK (Table 3). The predictions are very close to the results from FCA/DA and FCA experiments. The models predict 437D PSK is not as stable at 37 \u00b0C as measured by UV melting and DSC, however. Kinefold predicts the pseudoknot is even less stable than these models and the FCA/DA and FCA results.\n\nAs stated by Su et al. (55), the geometries of stems 1 and 2 differ significantly from a standard A-form duplex. For example, stems 1 and 2 have average propeller twists of 15\u00b0 and 26\u00b0, respectively, compared to 18.6\u00b0 for the A-form. The effect of the twist on stability is unclear. For the sake of simplicity, both the SPM (42) and NUPACK (33) models use the INN-HB model (39) to calculate the free energy for the stems as a component of the free energy of a pseudoknot. Theimer et al. hypothesized that the systematic deviation of pseudoknot unfolding energetics from measurements and predictions by the INN-HB model should be attributed to tertiary interactions (47). This could be tested by mutations that change only the nearest neighbors without changing tertiary interactions.\n\nFrom the BWYV pseudoknot\u2019s crystal structure (PDB entry 437D), mutation of the C11-G27 base pair to a U11-A27 base pair [PSK-U11A27 (see Figure 5)] changes only two nearest-neighbor stacks in stem 2. Table 2 shows that \u0394\u0394G37,PSK\u2212HP0 and \u0394\u0394G37,PSK0 for this mutation from BWYV PSK 2 are predicted to be \u22121.4 and 1.4 kcal/mol, respectively, by the INN-HB model as implemented in SPM and NUPACK. The FCA experimental results for \u0394\u0394G37,PSK\u2212HP0 and \u0394\u0394G37,PSK0 for this mutation are \u22121.2 and 1.2 kcal/mol, respectively, which is within experimental error of the prediction. This is evidence of the validity of the INN-HB model in the middle of pseudoknot stem 2. Similar agreement for substituting internal base pairs in stems 1 and 2 has been reported for the T4 pseudoknot (47).\n\nAs an additional C\u2212G or U\u2212A base pair is added to the top of stem 2 to give PSK-CG and PSK-UA (Figure 5), SPM and NUPACK predict the free energy for the pseudoknot by adding an additional INN-HB nearest-neighbor stack (\u22123.3 and \u22122.4 kcal/mol, respectively). The FCA experiment, however, shows free energy changes of \u22120.6 and 0.4 kcal/mol, respectively, from this additional base pair. In the two cases, the additional base pair is less stabilizing by 2.7 and 2.8 kcal/mol, respectively, than expected. One uncertainty in this comparison is the prediction of \u0394G370 for the hairpin in the RS2 complex (see the Supporting Information). This prediction is not likely wrong by more than 1 kcal/mol, however. Similar to the hypothesis from Theimer et al. (47), a likely explanation for the difference between prediction and experiment is induced conformational changes. In an A-type RNA helix, a base pair twists the end of the duplex by 33.1\u00b0 (74). As calculated by the polymer model of Aalberts and Hodas (26), the distance between G7 and C9e/U9e (Figure 5) through the major groove of stem 2 in PSK-CG and PSK-UA is the same as the distance between G7 and C10 in BWYV PSK 2. Therefore, nucleotides in loop 1 have to twist to connect G7 and C9e or U9e in PSK-CG or PSK-UA, respectively. That could affect the tertiary interactions among C8, G12, A25, and C26 (Figure 1B,C), which stabilize the BWYV pseudoknot as much as \u22123.1 kcal/mol at 37 \u00b0C (75), and therefore destabilize the pseudoknot. From FCA measurements, the penalty for breaking this tertiary interaction is \u223c2.8 kcal/mol at 37 \u00b0C. Evidently, loop size and tertiary interactions play an important role in pseudoknot stability.\n\nConsidering only nearest-neighbor parameters, \u0394G37,PSK\u2212CG0 \u2212 \u0394G37,PSK\u2212UA0 is predicted to be \u22120.9 kcal/mol. The FCA experimental results give a difference of \u22121.0 kcal/mol. While the INN-HB model does not predict the free energy increment from addition of another base pair to stem 2, it does predict the difference in increment between a C\u2212G pair and an A\u2212U pair. This is expected if the primary effect of adding a base pair is disruption of tertiary interactions.\n\nThe coincidence of the free energy from FCA/DA and FCA and predictions for 437D PSK (Table 3) also suggests the importance of tertiary interactions. The crystal structure shows U13 flipping out without forming a base pair with A25, while there is a complicated tertiary interaction among C8, G12, C26, A25, and C14 (Figure 1B,C). Therefore, the nearest neighbors will be affected because some hydrogen bonds and base stacking are lost in the structure. In predictions, U13 and A25 are paired and their nearest-neighbor free energy parameters for stacking with the G12-C26 base pair and for coaxial stacking with the G7-C14 base pair contribute to the predicted free energy. If these stacks are not included, then the pseudoknot will be predicted not to form, and only the stem 1 hairpin will be predicted to form. The predictions agree with the FCA/DA and FCA measurements, however. Apparently, the tertiary interactions compensate for the free energy loss from not forming a U13-A25 base pair. Alternatively, crystallization may trap one of two or more structures present in solution.\n\nWhile SPM (42) and NUPACK (33) use different models to estimate the penalty for pseudoknot loops, they both gave reasonable approximations for 437D PSK (Tables 2 and 3). To test the models further, the length of loop 1 was changed. Loop 1 was lengthened with different nucleotides to produce PSK-4A, PSK-4C, and PSK-4C-C9 (Figure 5 and Table 2). As Table 2 shows, increasing the size of loop 1 destabilized the pseudoknot, as predicted by SPM and NUPACK. The measured \u0394\u0394G37,PSK\u22124A0 and \u0394\u0394G37,PSK\u22124C0 are 1.1 and 1.4 kcal/mol, respectively, close to the predictions of 1.0 kcal/mol for either of them by SPM. The mutations are slightly more destabilizing than the NUPACK predictions of 0.4 kcal/mol for either of them. Again, the comparisons depend on the predicted \u0394G370 for the hairpin in the RS2 complex (see the Supporting Information).\n\nNeither the SPM nor NUPACK model predicts the large PSK destabilization calculated between PSK-4C and PSK-4C-C9 (Figure 5 and Table 2). The difference may reflect an unfavorable free energy for formation of loop 1 with all C\u2019s. Hairpin loops with oligo-C sequences are unusually unstable (60,76). Hairpin loops of C3 and C6 are \u223c1.5 and \u223c3.4 kcal/mol, respectively, less stable at 37 \u00b0C than other hairpin loops with the same number of nucleotides. Some of this destabilization may reflect the extra free energy required to unstack C\u2019s, e.g., \u223c0.3 kcal/mol more at 37 \u00b0C for poly-C than for poly-A (77). The FCA results suggest that there may also be an oligo-C effect for the free energy for pseudoknot loops. In PSK-4C-C9, loop 1 is formed by six C\u2019s and its free energy is \u223c1 kcal/mol less favorable than the free energy of PSK-4A or PSK-4C. This penalty is different from the penalty for a C6 hairpin loop but similar to the penalty for a C3 hairpin. Obviously, the C6 hairpin loop and C6 pseudoknot loop 1 have different conformations. A penalty of 1.0 kcal/mol is assigned to C6 pseudoknot loop 1. If this penalty is counted in SPM, then the SPM prediction will be closer to the FCA result. The results suggest that the SPM statistical model, which includes size exclusion effects, gives good agreement between predictions and experiments for loop 1.\n\nPSK-4A-U11A27 can be considered as a mutant from PSK-U11A27 via addition of four A\u2019s to loop 1, or a mutant from PSK-4A via mutation of the C11-G27 base pair to a U11-A27 base pair. The nearest-neighbor model in the stems predicts \u0394G37,PSK-4A-U11A270 \u2212 \u0394G37,PSK-4A0 to be 1.4 kcal/mol, and the SPM predicts \u0394G37,PSK-4A-U11A270 \u2212 \u0394G37,PSK-U11A270 to be \u223c1.0 kcal/mol. The FCA experiments for mutation from PSK-4A and PSK-U11A27 to PSK-4A-U11A27 give \u0394\u0394G370 values of \u22121.1 and \u22121.2 kcal/mol, respectively. This is surprising because the mutations make the pseudoknot more stable rather than less stable as expected. The deviation could come from additional tertiary interactions between one or more A\u2019s in loop 1 and the UA pair in stem 2. For example, an A\u00b7A-U base triple with the non-Watson\u2212Crick A in the major groove is possible (78,79). Another new interaction perhaps facilitated by the increased flexibility of an A\u2212U compared to a G\u2212C pair is also possible. That suggests again that stem\u2212loop tertiary interactions can be a large factor for the free energy of a pseudoknot.\n\nThe sequence dependence of stabilities for modified BWYV pseudoknots provides insight into several factors important for predictions. (1) The INN-HB model can be used to estimate the free energy contribution from stem 2 if tertiary interactions are not involved. Because the crystal structure of the BWYV pseudoknot indicates that stem 2 has a propeller twist that deviates more from A-form than stem 1, this suggests that the INN-HB model will also work the same way for stem 1. (2) As reported previously (44,75), tertiary interactions between the stem and loop are a major contributor to pseudoknot free energy. For example, a possible newly formed A\u00b7A-U base triple in the stem 2\u2212loop 1 region in PSK-4A-U11A27 could stabilize the pseudoknot by \u22122.2 kcal/mol. In the BWYV pseudoknot, the structure in the joint part of the stem 1\u2212loop 3 region and stem 2\u2212loop 1 region is \u201cdistorted\u201d and an expected base pair with coaxial stacking in the secondary structure is therefore absent. The free energy loss for this distortion, however, can be compensated by the tertiary interactions (Figure 1C). Thus, in the absence of structural information and thermodynamic parameters for tertiary interactions, it is reasonable to include possible base pairs and coaxial stacking at the joint in predicting the free energy of a pseudoknot. These interactions are possible, so their absence implies that the tertiary interactions must be even more favorable. (3) The statistical polymer model (SPM) provides excellent approximations for the length dependence of loop 1. There will also be sequence dependence, however, which is not dependent on tertiary interactions. For example, oligo-C loops are unusually unstable.\n\nThe following model for predicting pseudoknot stability is consistent with FCA results:\n\nAs in SPM (42), \u0394Gstems0 and possible \u0394Gcoaxial stacking0 can be calculated with nearest-neighbor parameters (39,63), and Sloops0 and \u0394Gassemble0 can be calculated from statistical mechanics using a lattice model (42). \u0394Gloop sequence0 is a term that will require many more experiments before approximations are available beyond oligo-C penalties. The \u0394Gnet of tertiaries0 term accounts for tertiary interactions between the stems and loops, and there is currently no good model for calculating it. Presumably, the three-dimensional structure of the pseudoknot is important for allowing nucleotides to interact, and certain base triples will be especially stable. Further experiments and comparisons with and between structures are needed to provide approximations, but the inclusion of possible base pairs and coaxial stacking at the interface limits the underestimation of pseudoknot stability due to the lack of approximations for \u0394Gnet of tertiaries0.\n\nFluorescence competition assays (FCA) based on FRET or quenching of fluorescence by nucleotides provide thermodynamic information about pseudoknots. The method has an advantage in that it probes a certain transition at a defined temperature and does not require a temperature extrapolation. The method is sensitive and therefore requires small amounts of sample. This allowed measurements of the sequence dependence of stability contributions from elements in the loop 1\u2212stem 2 region of pseudoknots. In general, fluorescence competition assays allow systematic studies of RNA stability that can inform writing of algorithms for predicting and/or designing RNA secondary structures.\n\nIn agreement with previous studies (44,75), tertiary interactions can provide large contributions to pseudoknot free energy that can be on the same order of magnitude as those from a Watson\u2212Crick base pair. The free energy from the loops can be estimated with the statistical polymer model of Cao and Chen (42), which will eventually require augmentation with a sequence-dependent term. This is similar to approaches in algorithms for predicting RNA secondary structure, where a length-dependent increment for loops is augmented with a sequence-dependent increment (60). Further experiments are necessary for understanding the sequence dependence of thermodynamics for the stem 1\u2212loop 3 region and for tertiary interactions. In the absence of in-depth knowledge of the sequence dependence of stability, however, rapidly acquired experimental constraints from NMR spectra can be used to reveal pseudoknot structures (38)."}
