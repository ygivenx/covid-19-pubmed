{"title": "Synthesis and antiviral properties of novel indole-based thiosemicarbazides and 4-thiazolidinones", "body": "Viral diseases continue to cause serious morbidity and mortality worldwide. For several virus infections, no antiviral medications are presently available. There is a clear need for new antiviral agents with new mechanisms of action or broad-spectrum activity, to face the issues of drug-resistant mutant viruses or emerging and neglected viruses.\n\nThe Picornaviridae are a family of non-enveloped, singlestranded RNA-viruses for which no antiviral drugs are yet available. Among these, the Enterovirus genus is of particular medical importance. 1 It contains the Coxsackie viruses which are classified into group A (serotypes A1 to A24) and group B (serotypes B1 to B6) based on early observations of the pathogenicity in mice. 2 Coxsackie virus group B (CVB) and, to a lesser extent, Coxsackie virus group A and some other enteroviruses, are the main viral causes of myocarditis and pericarditis. CVB is also associated with a wide variety of other diseases, including diabetes, common cold, cardiomyopathy, neurological disorders and inflammation. 3 Outbreaks of CVB occur annually throughout the world. Several synthetic molecules have been reported to be selective inhibitors of enteroviruses, and some of these have entered into clinical trials. [4] [5] [6] [7] Unfortunately, neither of these investigational compounds has been formally approved for the treatment of acute enteroviral (including Coxsackie virus) infections.\n\nThe indole core is a ubiquitous substructure in a large number of biologically active natural and synthetic molecules. Delavirdine (I), arbidol (II) and methisazone (III) (Fig. 1 ) are indole derived marketed drugs that have been used to treat viral diseases. Arbidol is an influenza virus inhibitor which is marketed in Russia, China and a few other countries. It was reported to have a wide spectrum of antiviral activity against a number of enveloped and non-enveloped viruses in addition to influenza viruses. 8 For instance, arbidol was found to exhibit potent inhibitory activity against CVB3 and CVB5. 3, 9 Another indole compound, N-methylisatin-b-thiosemicarbazone, methisazone, was used in the preventive treatment of smallpox after 1962. Based on in vitro studies, the antiviral spectrum of methisazone appears to include diverse DNA and RNA viruses. 10, 11 A series of investigations on isatin-b-thiosemicarbazones revealed their antiviral properties against various virus types, such as herpes simplex virus (HSV), 12 Moloney leukemia virus, 13 Japanese encephalitis virus 14 and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). 15 In a recent report by Zhang et al., 16 an isatin-b-hydrazone derivative (encoded ID45) was described as a promising antiviral agent against CVB3. Broad antiviral in vitro activity that includes CVB2 17 or CVB4 18 was further reported for some 2,3,5-trisubstituted indole derivatives synthesized by Giampieri et al. 17 and isoindolylureas synthesized by Verma et al. 18 Another class are indole-2-carboxamide derivatives, some of which were revealed to have promising antiviral properties during the http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2015.12.008 0968-0896/\u00d3 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Compounds with this scaffold were found to inhibit the replication of neurotropic alphavirus, 19 HIV-1, 20 HIV-1 wild type or drug-resistant mutant strains, and CVB4. 21 Another relevant scaffold is the 4-thiazolidinone substructure, which is present in several small synthetic molecules endowed with in vitro antiviral characteristics. [22] [23] [24] In view of these literature reports, we have focused our work on the design and synthesis of a new series of indolylthiosemicarbazides (6a-6g) and their cyclization products, 4-thiazolidinones (7a-7g). These new compounds were evaluated for in vitro antiviral activity against a wide variety of DNA and RNA viruses.\n\nThe synthetic pathways for the preparation of the target products are illustrated in Scheme 1. The key intermediate 5 was previously synthesized and patented by Ba-Maung et al. as an angiogenesis inhibitor. 25 The structures of the new compounds were established by microanalysis, IR, 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR (proton decoupled and APT), 2D-NMR (HSQC and HMBC) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). The absolute stereochemistry of 7d was determined by an X-ray diffraction study. 26 The absence of the NAH 2 resonance of the intermediate hydrazide (5) at d 4.48 ppm together with three new resonances located at about d 9.68-9.82, 9.35-9.57 and 7.80-8.43 ppm assigned to the N 1 H, N 2 H and N 4 H protons, supported the synthesis of new thiosemicarbazides (6a-6g). Observation of new lactam C@O bands (1710-1728 cm \u00c01 ) besides C@O amide bands (1636-1670 cm \u00c01 ) in the IR spectra of 7a-7g provided evidence for ring closure. New singlets assigned to the methylene protons of 4-thiazolidinone ring (d 3.95-4.05 ppm) in the 1 H NMR spectra of 7a-7g provided further confirmation. Peaks associated with the indole subunit were observed in the expected regions and were assigned on the basis of 1 H-1 H and 1 H-19 F couplings. 13 Figure 1 . Structures of some indole containing antiviral drugs delavirdine (I), arbidol (II) and methisazone (III).\n\nAntiviral evaluation in cell-based assays revealed that compounds 6a, 6b, 6c and 6d have interesting activity against Coxsackie B4 virus. This effect, observed in two different cell lines (HeLa and Vero; Table 1 ), was quite strong since the antiviral EC 50 values were in the range of 0.4-2.1 lg/mL, and the values for the selectivity index (ratio of cytotoxic to antivirally effective concentration; see values between square brackets in Table 1) were between 9 and 56. Compound 6b (with an ethyl substituent) was slightly more potent than the analogs carrying a methyl (6a), propyl (6c) or allyl (6d) moiety; this is also visible from the doseresponse curves shown in Figure 2 . Besides, 6b, 6c and 6d also inhibited the replication of two other RNA viruses, Sindbis virus and respiratory syncytial virus, although these EC 50 values were higher compared to those noted for Coxsackie B4 virus. Of note, the analogs carrying a larger butyl (6e) or aromatic (6f and 6g) substituent at the R position were devoid of this antiviral activity. The crucial role of the free thiosemicarbazide moiety was evident from the fact that their cyclized analogs, 4-thiazolidinones (7a-7g), did not produce any antiviral effect.\n\nCompounds 6a-6g and 7a-7g did not display activity against any of the other RNA-viruses tested (such as HIV or influenza virus), nor against DNA-viruses (i.e. HSV-1, HSV-2, feline herpesvirus and vaccinia virus) ( Table 2 ). On the other hand, this broad antiviral testing allowed to determine the cytotoxicity of the test compounds in diverse mammalian cell lines (Table 3 ). This analysis revealed that the 4-thiazolidinone derivatives (7) were consistently less cytotoxic than the corresponding thiosemicarbazides (6) . Within series 6, the compounds endowed with anti-Coxsackie B4 virus activity (6a-6d) tended to be less cytotoxic than the antivirally inactive counterparts 6e-6g.\n\nWe have efficiently synthesized novel thiosemicarbazide (6a-6g) and 4-thiazolidinone (7a-7g) derivatives with the 5-fluoro-3phenyl-1H-indole scaffold, and evaluated their in vitro antiviral activity against a broad range of DNA and RNA viruses. Compounds 6a, 6b, 6c and 6d exhibited significant and selective inhibitory effect on the replication of Coxsackie B4 virus. Compounds 6b, 6c and 6d also had weaker antiviral activity against Sindbis virus and respiratory syncytial virus. The SAR analysis indicated that keeping the free thiosemicarbazide moiety is crucial for the antiviral activity since the cyclization products (7a-7g) did not produce any antiviral effect. Also, it was observed that the presence of a bulkier butyl (6e) or aromatic (6f and 6g) substituent at the R position led to a dramatic decrease in biological activity.\n\nIn conclusion, the promising anti-Coxsackie B4 virus activity of new indolylthiosemicarbazide derivatives (6a-6d) makes them interesting lead compounds for further antiviral drug development. Hence, we have embarked on further structural optimization, besides mechanistic antiviral experiments, to improve and understand this antiviral activity. \n\nTo a solution of 1 (0.02 mol) in ethanol (10 mL), water (10 mL) and concd HCl (6 mL), 7% aqueous NaNO 2 solution (10 mL) was added dropwise at 0\u00b0C with stirring. The resulting solution of diazonium salt (2) was poured into a cooled (0\u00b0C) mixture of ethyl 2-benzyl-3-oxobutanoate (0.02 mol), ethanol (10 mL), water (10 mL) and KOH (5.4 g) while stirring. The resulting mixture was refrigerated overnight. The red oily residue thus obtained was separated, washed with water and used without further purification.\n\nA solution of 3 (0.02 mol) in concd HCl (20 mL) was heated under reflux for 4 h. The crude product was filtered off, washed with water until tested neutral to litmus and used without further purification.\n\nA mixture of 4 (0.02 mol), ethanol (20 mL) and H 2 NNH 2 \u00c1H 2 O (98%, 8 mL) was heated under reflux for 6 h. The resulting brown \n\nThe compounds were evaluated for antiviral activity in cell culture by using cytopathic effect (CPE) reduction assays with a broad and diverse panel of DNA-and RNA-viruses. 27, 28 Human cervix carcinoma HeLa cells were used to study vesicular stomatitis virus, Coxsackie B4 virus, and respiratory syncytial virus. African green monkey kidney Vero cells were used to evaluate para-influenza virus type 3, reovirus type 1, Sindbis virus, Coxsackie B4 virus, and Punta Toro virus. Viruses evaluated on human embryonic lung fibroblast cells were herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, vaccinia virus, and vesicular stomatitis virus. Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were used for antiviral evaluation against influenza A and B viruses. Feline herpes virus and feline canine virus were grown in Crandell-Rees feline kidney cells. Finally, HIV-1 and HIV-2 were monitored in human T-lymphoblast MT4 cells. 29 To perform the antiviral assays, the viruses were added to subconfluent cultures of the cells in 96-well plates, and at the same time, the test compounds were added in serial dilutions. Appropriate reference compounds were included, that is, the viral entry inhibitor dextran sulfate (MW 5000); the broad antiviral agent ribavirin; the antiherpetic agents ganciclovir and brivudin and the HIV inhibitor azidothymidine. After 3-6 days incubation at 37\u00b0C (or 35\u00b0C in the case of influenza virus), the compounds' inhibitory effect on virus-induced cytopathic effect as well as their cytotoxicity were monitored by light microscopy or by performing the MTS cell viability assay (CellTiter 96 \u00d2 AQ ueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay from Promega). Antiviral activity was expressed as the 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ) whereas cytotoxicity was defined as the minimal cytotoxic concentration (based on microscopy) or CC 50 (50% cytotoxic concentration, assessed by the MTS assay)."}
