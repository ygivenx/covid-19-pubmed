{"title": "Construction of a recombinant rhinovirus accommodating fluorescent marker expression", "body": "Rhinovirus (RV) is the most frequent viral infectious agent of the respiratory tract in humans and is the predominant cause of the common cold.1 More importantly, RV has emerged as the most frequent pathogen associated with asthma exacerbations in infants, children, and adults.2, 3, 4\n\n\nRV is placed in the Picornaviridae family, genus Enterovirus, with three species based on phylogenetic sequence criteria.5, 6 Clinical specimens collected from in the 1960s and 1970s yielded approximately 100 different species A and B strains which were subsequently serotyped.7, 8 More recently, a diverse group of previously unrecognized human viruses from species C was found to be common causes of respiratory illness.4 To understand RV pathogenesis, human and animal models have been developed. Human studies have employed experimental infection with RV\u2010A16.9, 10 Mouse studies have used RV\u2010A1B wild\u2010type mice11 or RV\u2010A16 in mice that are transgenic for human intercellular adhesion molecule\u20101.12 These models have been particularly useful in studying RV\u2010induced exacerbations of allergic airways disease. To detect RV in the tissues, investigators have employed the monoclonal antibody R16\u20107.9, 13, 14 This antibody, originally developed by Wai\u2010Ming Lee at the University of Wisconsin, binds to the VP2 capsid protein of the closely related RV\u2010A16 and RV\u2010A1 strains,6 but not to RV\u2010A2, RV\u2010B14, or RV\u2010A49.15 Because the presence of more than 100 different RV serotypes makes it infeasible to develop a cross\u2010reactive antibody for RV, we sought to develop a recombinant virus with a fluorescent marker that could be used for tracking of RV infection in vivo.\n\nSimilar to other picornaviruses, RV is icosahedral, nonenveloped particle which is composed of 60 copies each of four capsid proteins, VP1, VP2, VP3, and the small myristoylated VP4.16, 17 The capsid encases a positive\u2010sense single\u2010stranded RNA (ssRNA) genome of approximately 7200 nucleotides.18 Following virus entry and genome release into the host cell cytoplasm, the RV ssRNA is translated into a single polyprotein that undergoes proteolytic cleavage by viral proteases 2Apro and 3Cpro,\n8, 19, 20 with the exception of the autocatalytic cleavage of precursor VP0 into VP2 and VP4 in the presence of viral RNA during the assembly process.21\n\n\nRV infectious cDNA clones have been constructed and used as a molecular tool to study RV viral protein function and mutation\u2010phenotype association, as well as a vaccine vector for foreign gene expression.17, 22, 23, 24, 25 In the current study, we engineered a recombinant RV1A (RV1A\u2010iLOV) with insertion of the coding sequence for iLOV (for light, oxygen, or voltage sensing), a small\u2010size fluorescent marker.26 RV1A\u2010iLOV is viable, and its expressed iLOV protein is trackable both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that RV1A\u2010iLOV may be a useful tool in the study of RV pathogenesis. However, the detection of iLOV\u2010expressing RV in fixed tissue required the use of an anti\u2010iLOV antibody, limiting the value of this construct.\n\nH1\u2010Hela and THP\u20101 cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Plasmids pEGFP\u2010N1 (Clontech, Mountain View, CA), pRL (Renilla luciferase; Promega, Madison, WI), and pUC18\u2010ilOV (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ) were used to amplify the DNA fragments of green fluorescent protein (GFP), Renilla luciferase (RL), and iLOV, respectively. (For the detailed iLOV nucleotide sequence, see Table S1.) Antibody to RV VP2/VP0 was obtained from QED Biosciences (San Diego, CA). Anti\u2010GFP Ab was purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA). A synthesized peptide fragment of iLOV (CLGRNARFLQGPETD) was generated and used to generate anti\u2010iLOV antibody (GenScript). Bafilomycin was purchased from Merck Millipore (Burlington, MA).\n\nThe RV infectious cDNA clone encoding replication\u2010competent RV\u20101A, pMJ3\u2010RV1A, was kindly provided by W. T. Jackson, University of Maryland27 and served as a backbone for either GFP\u2010, RL\u2010, or iLOV\u2010expressing viruses. GFP, RL, and iLOV open reading frames (ORFs) were designed to be flanked by the edited nucleotide sequences encoding the viral 2Apro cleavage site with silent mutations introduced as described previously24 (Figure 1A, Table S2). Respective GFP, RL, and iLOV inserts were PCR amplified from existing clones using the primers listed in Table S1. The PCR products, which contained Apa I restriction enzyme cleavage sites on the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends, were digested with Apa I, ligated to pMJ3\u2010RV1A, and transformed in E. coli (DH5\u03b1, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The resultant clones were sequenced to confirm the correct orientation of the inserts.\n\nInfectious cDNA clones encoding RV1A, RV1A\u2010GFP, RV1A\u2010RL, and RV1A\u2010iLOV were linearized by Mlu I restriction enzyme digestion. To produce replication\u2010competent virus, full\u2010length viral RNA transcripts were generated using the MEGAscript T7 Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and transfected into H1\u2010HeLa cells using Lipofectamine MessengerMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific). After 48 hours, cells underwent three freeze\u2010thaw cycles and were subjected to centrifugation at 13 800 g for supernatant collection. The virus\u2010containing supernatant stocks were designated as passage 0 (P0). H1\u2010HeLa cells were subsequently used to passage the virus for subsequent in vitro virus stability and in vivo studies. RV1A\u2010GFP and RV1A\u2010RL underwent plaque purification for insert analysis. RV was concentrated and partially purified from infected HeLa cell lysates by ultrafiltration using a 100 kDa cutoff filter, as described.11 Viral quantity was determined by plaque assay28 or quantitative one\u2010step real\u2010time polymerase chain reaction for positive\u2010strand viral RNA using RV\u2010specific primers and probes (forward primer: 5\u2032\u2010GTGAAGAGCCSCRTGTGCT\u20103\u2032; reverse primer: 5\u2032\u2010GCTSCAGGGTTAAGGTTAGCC\u20103\u2032; probe: 5\u2032\u2010FAM\u2010TGAGTCCTCCGGCCCCTGAATG\u2010TAMRA\u20103\u2032).29 The limit of detection for this viral copy number analysis is between 0 and 10 copies. The presence of the GFP, RL, and iLOV inserts was determined using RV\u2010specific flanking primers (forward primer: 5\u2032\u2010CATTCTGTTGTCATCACAACACA\u20103\u2032; reverse primer: 5\u2032\u2010CACCTATAGTGTTTGTGCGGT\u20103\u2032). iLOV insert quantity was measured by quantitative real\u2010time PCR using specific primers encoding for iLOV (forward primer: 5\u2032\u2010GATTCCTGCAAGGACCAGAG\u20103\u2032; reverse primer: 5\u2032\u2010CCGCTCTTGGTGTAGTTGAT\u20103\u2032).\n\nH1\u2010HeLa cells were infected with RV1A\u2010iLOV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 for 24 h. Infected cells were then subjected to fluorescent microscopy. In selected experiments, RV1A\u2010iLOV\u2013infected cells were fixed and stained with Alexa Fluor 555\u2013conjugated mouse anti\u2010RV VP2/VP0 (clone R16\u20107; QED Bioscience). Images were visualized using an Olympus IX71\u2010inverted phase/epifluorescence microscope and digital CCD camera.\n\nAnimal usage followed guidelines set forth in the Principles of Laboratory Animal Care from the National Society for Medical Research. Six\u2010day\u2010old or 8\u2010 to 10\u2010week\u2010old BALB/c mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) were treated intranasally with 15 or 50 \u03bcL of 108 plaque forming units of virus and harvested 24 hours later.\n\nFor histology, mouse lungs were perfused through the pulmonary artery with PBS containing 5 mmol/L EDTA and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde overnight. For immunohistochemistry, lung sections were stained with rabbit anti\u2010iLOV, then incubated with biotinylated secondary goat\u2010IgG, ABC reagent (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), diaminobenzidine (DAB, Sigma\u2010Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), and Gill's hematoxylin (Fisher Scientific, Kalamazoo, MI). For fluorescence microscopy, slides were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488\u2013conjugated iLOV, Alexa Fluor 555\u2013conjugated mouse anti\u2010RV VP2/VP0, and Cy5\u2013anti\u2010mouse CD68 (Biolegend, San Diego, CA). Nuclei were stained with 4\u2032,6\u2010diamidino\u20102\u2010phenylindole (DAPI). Images were acquired with a Zeiss ApoTome confocal microscope (Microscopy and Image Analysis Core, University of Michigan).\n\nLung RNA was extracted with TRIzol Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) combined with on\u2010column digestion of genomic DNA (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA). cDNA was synthesized from 1 \u03bcg of RNA and subjected to quantitative real\u2010time PCR using specific mRNA primers encoding for IL\u20101\u03b2, IFN\u2010\u03b2, IFN\u2010\u03b3, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL10, CCL2, CCL5, and IL\u201010 (Table S2). For each sample, the level of gene expression was normalized to its own GAPDH mRNA.\n\nHeLa cells were infected with sham, RV1A or RV1A\u2010iLOV at an MOI of 0.1 for 24 hours. Cells were subjected to flow cytometry and analyzed on an LSR Fortessa (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). For in vivo experiments, lungs from sham\u2010, RV1A\u2010, and RV1A\u2010iLOV\u2010treated BALB/c mice were perfused with PBS containing EDTA, minced, and digested in collagenase IV. Cells were filtered and washed with RBC lysis buffer, and dead cells were stained with Pac\u2010Orange Live/Dead fixable dead staining dye (Fisher Scientific, Kalamazoo, MI, USA). To identify iLOV\u2010positive cells, cells were stained for surface markers with anti\u2010CD45 (BioLegend) and anti\u2010CD11b (Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA). Cells were then fixed, permeabilized, and incubated with the Cy3\u2010tagged anti\u2010iLOV prior to flow cytometry. Data were collected and analyzed using FACSDiva (BD Biosciences) and FlowJo software (TreeStar, Ashland, OR).\n\nData are represented as mean \u00b1 SE. Statistical significance was assessed using an unpaired t test or one\u2010way ANOVA, as appropriate. Group differences were pinpointed by a Tukey's multiple\u2010comparison test.\n\nGFP with flanking 2Apro cleavage sites was designed to be inserted between the RV genomic sequences encoding the VP1 and 2A proteins (Figure 1A). To stabilize the genome, silent mutations were introduced into the coding sequences of both the flanking 2Apro cleavage sites (Table S1), as described previously.24 To generate viral stocks, genomic RNA transcripts made from the RV1A\u2010GFP infectious clone were transfected into H1\u2010HeLa cells followed by three consecutive passages (P1\u2010P3). A cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed in HeLa cell\u2010infected RV1A\u2010GFP (Figure 1B). However, we were unable to detect GFP expression by Western blot (Figure 1C) or immunofluorescence (Figures 1D). We also constructed recombinant RV1A\u2010expressing Renilla luciferase (RL) protein to determine whether the size of the GFP insert exceeded the limited packaging capacity of RV. To examine the presence of intact GFP and RL ORFs from RV1A\u2010GFP and RV1A\u2010RL, RT\u2010PCR was performed for plaque\u2010purified RV1A\u2010GFP and RV1A\u2010RL using RV\u2010specific flanking primers. Results showed that the GFP and RL sequences were deleted (Figure 1E). Sequence analysis of inserts confirmed these results (data not shown).\n\nWe reasoned that the approximately 753 nt GFP and 1005 nt RL ORFs (including engineered flanking sequences) exceeded the limited packaging capacity of RV.24 We therefore chose an alternative smaller fluorescent protein, iLOV (~366 nt). RV1A\u2010iLOV was generated following the design and generation procedure of RV1A\u2010GFP. CPE and growth kinetics of RV1A\u2010iLOV were determined in HeLa cells. In comparison with the parental virus, the RV1A\u2010iLOV displayed a slightly reduced cytopathic effect and growth rate (Figure 2A,B). By immunofluorescence, iLOV signal (green) appeared in RV1A\u2010iLOV\u2013infected cells only, further confirming the expression of iLOV (Figure 2C). Western blot analysis using rabbit sera recognizing the iLOV protein showed expression of a product of the predicted molecular weight in RV1A\u2010iLOV\u2013infected cells (Figure 2D), while viral capsid proteins VP0 and VP2 were detected in both RV1A\u2010 and RV1A\u2010iLOV\u2013infected cells.\n\nNext, we examined the genetic stability of RV1A\u2010iLOV in HeLa cells. iLOV expression was observed in RV1A\u2010iLOV P1\u2010 and P5\u2010infected HeLa cells by live\u2010cell imaging and flow cytometry (Figure 3A\u2010D). All VP2/0\u2010positive cells were iLOV\u2010positive. Analysis of the P1 and P5 RV1A\u2010iLOV stocks by RT\u2010PCR revealed that exogenous iLOV DNA was stably retained within the RV genome over five passages (P1 to P5) (Figure 3E). Sequence analysis of the iLOV insert confirmed these results and revealed no mutations (data not shown).\n\nWe explored the application of RV1A\u2010ilOV to antiviral drug screening. Bafilomycin has previously been shown to inhibit RV infection.30 We infected HeLa cells with RV1A\u2010iLOV at an MOI of 0.1 for 24 hours in the presence of different concentrations of bafilomycin. iLOV expression was examined using flow cytometry (Figure 4A). Consistent with previous work,30 bafilomycin completely inhibited iLOV expression at a concentration of 0.1 \u03bcmol/L (Figure 4A,B) and significantly reduced the viral titers of both RV1A and RV1A\u2010iLOV (Figure 4C). These results demonstrate the potential utility of the iLOV construct to measure RV protein expression in vitro.\n\nWe previously showed RV1B, a minor group virus, triggers inflammation and cytokine expression in mice.11 We therefore tested whether the iLOV insert influences RV replication and RV\u2010induced inflammatory responses in vivo. Eight\u2010week\u2010old mice were infected with RV1A and RV1A\u2010iLOV for up to 4 days, and lungs were harvested at different time points after infection and processed for positive\u2010strand viral RNA. Measurement of RV copy number and viral titers showed no statistical difference in viral load between RV1A\u2010iLOV and the parental RV1A at each of the indicated time points (Figure 5A).\n\nStudies in coxsackievirus have shown that large insertions at the analogous capsid protein P\u20101D protease 2A junction may delete readily.31, 32 iLOV stability in vivo was therefore examined by RT\u2010PCR at each of the indicated time points (Figure 5B). The intact iLOV fragment (~600\u2010bp band) along with a size\u2010reduced band (~300 bp) appeared in RV1A\u2010iLOV\u2013infected mice. Sequence analysis of the size\u2010reduced band revealed the deletion of the coding sequence for intact iLOV plus three nucleotides from 2Apro (see sequence in Table S1). Retention of the iLOV insert was approximately 90% at the indicated time points (Figure 5B,C).\n\nWe next examined cytokine mRNA expression in RV1A\u2010iLOV\u2013infected mice. Lungs were harvested one day after infection. Similar to the parental RV1A virus, RV1A\u2010iLOV increased lung mRNA levels of Il1b, Ifnb1, Ifng, Cxcl1, Cxcl10, Cxcl2, and Ccl2 (Figure 5D). However, Ifng and Cxcl10 mRNA expressions were decreased for RV1A\u2010iLOV compared to RV1A, perhaps because of the slightly reduced growth rate. No induction of Ccl5 or Il10 was observed for either RV1A or RV1A\u2010ilOV.\n\nHeLa cells were plated on coverslips, infected with RV1A\u2010iLOV, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. A fluorescent signal was visualized, but the signal was rapidly quenched, likely due to the oxidation and bleaching of iLOV\u2010bound flavin mononucleotide. Similarly, imaging of fixed lung tissue from RV1A\u2010iLOV\u2013infected mice failed to reveal a fluorescent signal. We therefore employed an anti\u2010iLOV antibody for immunohistochemical staining and immunofluorescence imaging. We infected mice with RV1A\u2010iLOV and harvested lungs one day postinfection. We have previously shown that, besides airway epithelial cells, RV colocalizes with CD68+ macrophages.13, 14 Immunohistochemical staining with anti\u2010iLOV showed signal in both the epithelium and macrophages (Figure 6A). Immunofluorescence similarly indicated localization in the airway epithelium, as well as colocalization of iLOV (green) with VP2/0 (red) and a macrophage marker, CD68 (blue, Figure 6B).\n\nWe have previously shown that RV infection induces lung infiltration with CD11b\u2010positive, M2\u2010polarized exudative macrophages.33 For the analysis of intracellular iLOV, aliquots of lung mince were fixed, permeabilized, and incubated with the Cy3\u2010tagged anti\u2010iLOV prior to flow cytometry. Flow cytometric analysis showed similar increases in the percentage for CD45 +  CD11b+ cells in both RV1A\u2010 and RV1A\u2010iLOV\u2013infected mice (Figure 6C), confirming the colocalization of lung macrophages and RV. However, a signal was detected in CD45+ CD11b+ cells only in RV1A\u2010iLOV\u2013infected mice. Taken together, these results suggest RV1A\u2010iLOV as a potential tool to study RV\u2010induced responses in immature mice.\n\nIn the present study, we sought to design and generate a recombinant RV1A accommodating fluorescent marker expression, thereby allowing tracking of viral infection in vivo. Using reverse genetics, we engineered and constructed recombinant RV1A infectious cDNA clones harboring the coding sequences of GFP, RL, or iLOV. GFP and RL were not expressed in cultured cells due to deletion during replication, consistent with the limited packaging capability of other picornaviruses. On the other hand, the smaller fluorescent protein construct, iLOV, was stably expressed in RV1A\u2010iLOV\u2013infected cells both in vitro and in vivo. Evaluation of iLOV expression was used to assess the antiviral effects of bafilomycin in RV1A\u2010iLOV\u2013infected cells in vitro. Further, in vivo studies showed that, compared to parental virus, RV1A\u2010iLOV yielded a similar viral load and level of cytokine mRNA expression in the lungs of infected mice. These results suggest RV1A\u2010iLOV may be a useful molecular tool for studying the life cycle and pathogenesis of RV.\n\nConstruction of recombinant viruses expressing fluorescent markers, especially GFP, has been applied through reverse genetics to RNA viruses including influenza virus,34 Zika virus,35 West Nile virus,36 respiratory syncytial virus,37 murine coronavirus,38 and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus.39 However, insertion of large fluorescent protein coding sequences into the genome of the picornaviruses, a group of small RNA viruses whose genome sizes range from 7.2 to 8.5 kb, has been problematic. Insertion of the GFP ORF into poliovirus severely impaired viral replication and was deleted in the course of cell culture serial passage.40 In addition, an attempt to construct a recombinant foot\u2010and\u2010mouth disease virus (FMDV) expressing GFP or Renilla luciferase protein failed, likely due to the limited packaging capability.41 Subsequent construction of viruses containing increasingly larger inserts suggested 300\u2013400 nt as the maximum size to be inserted into FMDV genome. Consistent with this, RV1A has been used to express a 393\u2010nt\u2013long fragment of HIV gag gene.24 Shorter antigenic tags have also been inserted into the nonstructural proteins of poliovirus.42\n\n\nCompared to GFP, fluorescent proteins based on flavin\u2010binding LOV (light, oxygen, or voltage sensing) domain offer advantages owing to their smaller size (354 nt), pH, and thermal stability.43 iLOV was created from the LOV2 domain of the phototropin 2 plant blue light receptor of Arabidopsis thaliana.26 Unlike GFP\u2010based fluorescent proteins which are inherently fluorescent, LOV domains specifically function as photosensory modules and typically bind flavin mononucleotide as an ultraviolet blue light\u2010absorbing chromophore. Accordingly, iLOV has been used as a reporter gene in recombinant FMDV41 and reovirus.44 However, in the latter studies, iLOV expression was only examined in cultured mammalian cells, not in vivo experiments. We now show that iLOV is expressed in RV1A\u2010iLOV\u2013infected cells in vivo. Though some deletion occurs during in vivo infection, over 90% of the recombinant RV1A\u2010iLOV retains the iLOV sequence. However, while iLOV was readily detectable in cultured HeLa cells, the iLOV fluorescence was rapidly lost in fixed cells and lung tissue, likely due to the oxidation and bleaching of iLOV\u2010bound flavin mononucleotide. We therefore required the use of anti\u2010iLOV antibody to detect RV1A\u2010iLOV.\n\nSimilar to viral proteins, iLOV protein is released from the RV polyprotein through viral proteinase\u2010mediated auto\u2010cleavage during viral protein production, an early step of viral replication. Detection of iLOV in mouse tissue is therefore highly suggestive of viral replication, particularly in the airway epithelium. However, it remains unclear whether iLOV signal in macrophages represents replication or engulfment of the virus by phagocytosis. Viral replication in cultured macrophages is limited,45 though it has recently been shown that airway epithelial cells promote rhinovirus replication in monocytic cells.46\n\n\nBecause there are more than 100 different RV serotypes (in species A and B alone), it is infeasible to develop a cross\u2010reactive antibody for RV. Until now, only one antibody has been available for this purpose, the monoclonal antibody R16\u20107. This antibody binds to the VP2 capsid protein of the closely related RV\u2010A16 and RV\u2010A1 strains6 but not to RV\u2010A2, RV\u2010B14, or RV\u2010A49.15 We developed a recombinant virus with a fluorescent marker that could be used for tracking of RV infection in vivo. We designed the iLOV sequence to be flanked with 2Apro cleavage sites and then inserted between the RV genomic sequences encoding the VP1 and 2A proteins. 2Apro mediates auto\u2010cleavage between VP1 and 2A proteins.20, 47 Since self\u2010catalytic cleavage is a characteristic of picornavirus replication, this design should allow extension of our technique to all human RVs. Given the fact that iLOV sequence was stably maintained within RV1A genome during consecutive passages, it is plausible that other RVs serotypes would accommodate and maintain the stability of iLOV sequence. Though the 2Apro cleavage sites of numerous RV serotypes are heterogeneous,48 designing the flanked 2Apro cleavage sequence to be serotype\u2010specific would guarantee the release of iLOV. Besides VP1\u20102A cleavage site, the junction site between 5\u2032UTR and the N\u2010terminus of VP4 has been used to insert GFP in the genome of coxsackie A16 virus49; however, the insertion impaired viral replication. Taken together, these data suggest that the construction strategy for RV1A\u2010iLOV could be applied to other RV serotypes for studying the life cycle of RV in cultured cells, screening for antiviral drugs and for the pathogenesis of RV."}
