{"title": "Persistent viremia by a novel parvovirus in a slow loris (Nycticebus coucang) with diffuse histiocytic sarcoma", "body": "The Sunda slow loris (Nycticebus coucang), a Strepsirrhine primate which belongs to the family Lorisidae, is a nocturnal, arboreal prosimian species native to Indonesia (Sumatra), western Malaysia (Peninsular Malaysia), Singapore and southern Thailand (Nekaris and Streicher, 2008). Slow loris, listed as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation and Nature (IUCN) (IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, available at: www.iucnredlist.org), are protected by law in Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia since their conservation status is a matter of concern. The biggest threat endangering those animals is the pet trade\u2014they are the most commonly protected primates species sold as exotic pets in southeast Asia (Nekaris and Nijman, 2007), but habitat loss and the fact they are killed as crop pests also jeopardize their survival (Nekaris and Streicher, 2008). Because of these reasons a better understanding of the causes and the dynamics of diseases in N. coucang is advantageous for conservation attempts and captive management of this species (Remick et al., 2009). In addition, valuable information can be gathered by the study of diseases in non-human primates, which in turn might be beneficial for human health.\n\nWe investigated a case of histiocytic sarcoma (HS) in a N. coucang identified at the Duke Lemur Center (DLC) in Durham, North Carolina. HS is a highly aggressive hematopoietic tumor defined as a malignant proliferation of cells showing morphological and immunophenotypic features of mature tissue histiocytes, cells of the innate immune system derived from bone marrow monocytes which differentiate into dendritic cells and tissue localized macrophages (Fulmer and Mauldin, 2007; Takahashi and Nakamura, 2013). Tumors can be localized or disseminated with lymph nodes being the most common site of proliferation, followed by organs of the gastrointestinal tract, spleen, soft tissues, and skin (Takahashi and Nakamura, 2013). It is a rare type of cancer in humans and cases have been reported in other species of animals, including chickens, dogs, cats, camels, macaques, and lemurs (Fulmer and Mauldin, 2007; Friedrichs and Young, 2008; Soshin et al., 2008; Molenaar et al., 2009; Remick et al., 2009; Takahashi and Nakamura, 2013). Although the cause of HS is largely unknown, a viral etiology can be postulated as the existence of viruses involved in the development of hematopoietic cancers have been recognized, as in the case of Epstein Barr and human T-lymphotropic virus-induced human lymphomas and similar viruses in non-human primates (Miller et al., 1972; Donahue et al., 1992; Feichtinger et al., 1992; Vereide and Sugden, 2009; Qayyum and Choi, 2014). Additionally it has been proven that the subgroup J avian leukosis virus is associated with the development of histiocytic sarcomatosis in chickens (Pandiri et al., 2009) and an association between persistent Epstein Barr virus infection and human HS has been reported (Kramer et al., 1985). In this study we applied a sequence independent virus discovery technique combined with high throughput sequencing, VIDISCA-454 (De Vries et al., 2011), to investigate the possible involvement of a previously unknown virus in the development of HS in a N. coucang. Several sequences with homology to parvoviral genes were identified indicating the presence of a novel parvovirus, whose genome was subsequently fully sequenced.\n\nParvoviruses (viral family Parvoviridae) are small non-enveloped single stranded DNA viruses which are able to infect a wide range of species of vertebrates (subfamily Parvovirinae) and arthropods (subfamily Densovirinae). According to the latest ICTV classification (2013) 8 genera are recognized within the subfamily Parvovirinae and 5 of them include viruses infecting primates (Cotmore et al., 2013; Cotmore and Tattersall, 2014). Some parvoviruses classified within the genus Dependoparvovirus need the presence of a helper virus for a productive infection while viruses within other genera\u2014the so called autonomous parvoviruses\u2014are S phase\u2013dependent: cells must undergo the S phase of growth for viral replication to occur (Berns, 1990).\n\nThe spectrum of parvovirus induced diseases, which mainly involve young individuals, is very wide and varies from more severe forms [like severe enteritis with high mortality in young dogs (Goddard and Leisewitz, 2010), erythema infectiosum or hydrops fetalis in children both caused by parvovirus B19 (Heegaard and Brown, 2002, p. 19), or the Aleutian disease in minks (Best and Bloom, 2005)] to milder forms [like common respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases in humans (Jartti et al., 2012)]. Finally, parvovirus infections can also occur in asymptomatic individuals (Heegaard and Brown, 2002, p. 19; Lau et al., 2008; Clegg et al., 2012). Although there is no formal proof of the existence of oncoviruses within this family, parvoviruses have been reported in literature to be associated with both solid and hematopoietic cancers (Fisgin et al., 2002; Li et al., 2012; Schildgen et al., 2013; Ibrahem et al., 2014). However, since they rely on actively replicating cells, the increased presence of these viruses in individuals with cancer might also derive from the permissive nature of the tumor cells and some of these viruses have even proven to possess oncosuppressive effects on transformed cells (Berns, 1990; N\u00fcesch et al., 2012).\n\nBesides reporting the discovery and the molecular characterization of a novel parvovirus, the scope of this study was to determine whether a possible correlation existed between this virus and the presence of the histiocytic sarcoma in a N. coucang.\n\nThe virus was identified in a 22 year old, male Nycticebus coucang (slow loris) named Buddha, held in captivity for 22 years at the Duke University Primate Center and which had no prior significant health issues. The individual was diagnosed with neoplasia and euthanized due to poor condition, although a routine physical inspection 8 months before death revealed an enlarged spleen. A complete postmortem examination was performed.\n\nRepresentative tissues of Buddha were collected and fixed in 10% neutral formalin. Fixed tissue was processed routinely into paraffin blocks and sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and reviewed by a board of certified veterinary pathologist.\n\nTwenty serum samples (belonging to 16 individuals: 11 N. coucang and 5 Nycticebus pygmaeus) and 61 organs collected at necropsy (belonging to 17 individuals: 11 N. coucang\u2014including Buddha\u2014and 6 N. pygmaeus) were screened for the presence of the virus. Organ samples included 17 livers, 6 spleens, 15 kidneys, 10 lungs, 6 hearts, 7 intestines (5 small intestines and 2 large intestines). Altogether these samples belonged to 25 individuals (18 N. coucang and 7 N. pygmaeus) with various types of disease. Liver, spleen, kidney, lung, and intestine samples from Buddha were available as well as serum or whole blood collected on 4 different time points: year 2000 (serum), year 2005 (serum), year 2007 (whole blood), and year 2008 (serum).\n\nSerum samples and organs were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until virological examinations were performed.\n\nHousing management and sample collection from the animals in this report were approved by the appropriate federal and institutional regulatory authorities.\n\nSequence independent virus discovery was performed on a serum sample collected from Buddha at necropsy (2008) with the previously described VIDISCA-454 procedure (De Vries et al., 2011) with minor modifications. After a centrifugation and DNase treatment to remove both intact cells and host DNA derived from broken cells, viral nucleic acids were isolated from 100 \u03bcl of serum with the QIAmp DNA mini kit (Qiagen). Subsequent to the ligation of adaptors containing specific Roche-454 primer binding sequences, an amplicon size-selection was performed to prevent the amplification of DNA fragments smaller than 200 bp using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter), followed by 30 cycles of PCR amplification. The amplified library was subjected to 2 consecutive purification rounds with Agencourt AMPure XP beads to completely remove excess primers and short fragments and DNA concentration was measured on a Qubit Fluorometer (Quant-it ds DNA HS kit, Invitrogen). The library was pooled with other samples, the average size of the whole library was estimated with Agilent 2100Bioanalyzer (high sensitivity DNA kit, Agilent Technologies) and the final concentration (copies/\u03bcl) was calculated using the KAPA Library Quantification kit (KAPA Biosystems). Samples were then diluted to a final concentration of 1 million copies/\u03bcl and used as input for the emulsion PCR (LIB-A emPCR kit, Roche) and 454 pyrosequencing (Roche).\n\nAfter sequencing, primer sequences were trimmed from every read and sequences were assembled with CodonCode Aligner software, version 3.5.6. The contigs (consensus sequences derived from reads found multiple times) and unassembled sequences were compared to known nucleotide and protein sequences in the GenBank database using different standalone BLAST tools (blastn and tblastx) (Altschul et al., 1990). Blast results were visualized using the MEGAN software version 4.70.4 (Huson et al., 2011).\n\nSpecific primers were designed on the viral sequences identified with VIDISCA-454 and PCRs using DreamTaq DNA polymerase (Thermo Scientific) were performed to connect fragments. Sequencing reactions were carried out with nested primers directly on the amplified products using the Big Dye terminator chemistry (BigDye\u00ae Terminator v1.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit, Applied Biosystems).\n\nThe ends of the genome were determined using genomic fragments obtained by specific digestion with 2 different restriction enzymes (MseI and CviAII from New England Biolabs) to obtain overlapping fragments, to which VIDISCA adaptors were subsequently ligated; semi specific PCRs were then performed with a combination of one primer annealing to the known viral sequence and one to the adaptor. After sequencing the obtained amplicons, the novel sequence was used as a template for new primer design and the whole procedure was repeated until reaching the end of the genome. Specific PCRs were used as confirmation. All primers used for PCR and sequencing reactions are available upon request.\n\nDNA isolations were performed from 100 \u03bcl of serum with the QIAmp DNA mini kit (Qiagen) and from 40 \u03bcl of blood or about 20 mg of tissue (about 5 mg for spleen) with the DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen). Absolute quantification of viral DNA (copies/ml of serum or blood and copies/g of tissue) was achieved using plasmid-based standards: a portion of the NS1 ORF (position in the complete genome: nt 1129\u20131527) was amplified and cloned into TOPO\u00ae cloning vector according to the instructions of the manufacturer (TOPO\u00ae TA cloning, Invitrogen), followed by plasmid purification (Plasmid DNA purification Nucleobond Xtra Midi, Macherey-Nagel) and quantification (NanoDrop 2000c, Thermo Scientific). Quantitative Real Time PCR assays were performed with IQ Supermix (BioRad) and using 4 \u03bcl of DNA as input, with the following primers and probe: Buddha_RT_F, GCTAATCTGGTGGGAAGAAGG; Buddha_RT_R, CCTTTGCGATCTACCCTGAC; Buddha_RT_P, 5\u2032FAM\u2014CCGCCAAGGAGAGCCTTAGCAC\u2014TAMRA 3\u2032. Real-time PCR reactions were performed with the Light Cycler 480 system (Roche).\n\nTo detect possible differences between sequences obtained from various organs or different years, all positive samples were subjected to a specific amplification of a 1231 nt long portion of the VP1 gene using DreamTaq DNA polymerase (Thermo Scientific) with primers Buddha_VP_5F\u2014ATGTCTCCACTCATTCTGGTG\u2014and Buddha_14_R\u2014ACGATCTGGGTAGATGACTTC. Amplicons were diluted 1:10 and directly sequenced employing the Big Dye terminator chemistry (BigDye\u00ae Terminator v1.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit, Applied Biosystems).\n\nTo detect the presence of latent viral forms (extra-chromosomal circular episomal DNA or integrated DNA) in the different tissues, specific PCR-based assays were designed. A graphical overview of the methods used to detect latency is available in Figure 1. For this purpose the DNA isolated from all organs collected during the necropsy of Buddha (lung, liver, spleen, kidney, small, and large intestine) and from blood (collected one year before the animal died) were used as input.\n\nTo detect the presence of circularized viral genome an inverted nested PCR was performed using primers annealing at the end of the two open reading frames (ORFs) (Figure 1A): I_Buddha_R1\u2014CCTTGTTCGATCTGTCCAAAATAATTGC\u2014and I_Buddha_F1\u2014CCAGTAGTGGAGAAGTCATCTACCC\u2014for the first step of amplification; I_Buddha_R2\u2014GTAATTGCTTTAATGGCTTTGATTCCCAG\u2014and I-Buddha_F2\u2014TGGAAGTCGAGTAAAATACCGACACATG\u2014for the nested amplification. As a control DNA isolated from serum samples (collected in 2008 both with and without VIDISCA pre-treatment) was also included.\n\nTo detect chromosome-integrated viral forms 3 different approaches have been employed, of which 2 involved a specific enzymatic digestion of the isolated DNA (Figure 1B): 7.5 \u03bcl DNA eluate was cut (restriction site at nucleotides 868\u2013873) in a 20 \u03bcl reaction mix containing 5 U of NdeI restriction enzyme (New England Biolabs) during an incubation of 2 h at 37\u00b0C. Prior to inactivation, 5 \u03bcl of cut DNA were collected and used to perform a specific ligation of VIDISCA adaptors (De Vries et al., 2011) to the digested fragments using 4 U of T4 DNA ligase (life technologies). Afterwards 2 semi virus-specific nested amplifications were performed using one primer complementary to the virus (I_Buddha_R1 and I_Buddha_R2 for the 5\u2032 side; I_Buddha_F1 and I_Buddha_F2 for the 3\u2032 side) and one adaptor specific primer. In parallel, 5 \u03bcl of the cut DNA was subjected to an inactivation step for 20 min at 65\u00b0C, followed by an overnight incubation at room temperature with 4 U of T4 DNA ligase to allow self-ligation and consequent circularization of the digested fragments (containing host sequences flanking the viral integrated DNA). Two specific inverted nested PCRs were used afterwards with primer pairs I_Buddha_F1/I_Buddha_R3 (TCCCGACACAAATAATCGGACAACC) and I_Buddha_R1/I_Buddha_F3 (GACGTGCTTTGTTAGAATCTGTTCCTG) during the first step and I_Buddha_F2/I_Buddha_R4 (GAAATTTGAATTTCCATCTTAGCTTGAGTC) and I_Buddha_R2/I_Buddha_F4 (CAAACCCTGCAATGGTGTGTAGATG) during the second amplification step.\n\nThe third approach for integrated DNA detection made use of the Alu elements, DNA sequences which are highly repeated in primate genomes (H\u00e4sler and Strub, 2006). A primer (Ny_Alu: CCTCCCAGAGTGCTAGGATTGCAC) binding to one of these region was designed (according to GenBank sequence with accession number DQ822059) and used alone (as a negative control) or in combination with viral specific primers (I_Buddha_R1 or I_Buddha_F1 for the first amplification step and I_Buddha_R2 or I_Buddha_F2 for the nested amplification) to amplify the putative integration region (Figure 1C).\n\nAll amplifications were performed by using 5 \u03bcl of DNA as input in a 50 \u03bcl PCR mix containing DreamTaq DNA polymerase (Thermo Scientific) and 0.2 \u03bcM primers: PCRs were performed according to the following thermo profile: initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles (25 during the nested PCR) at 95\u00b0C for 30 s, 60\u00b0C for 30 s and 72\u00b0C for 1.5 min (for the episomal DNA test) or 3 min (for the integration tests) and a final elongation cycle at 72\u00b0C for 7 min. Positive PCR products were cloned into the TOPO\u00ae cloning vector (TOPO\u00ae TA cloning, Invitrogen) and sequenced employing Big Dye terminator chemistry (BigDye\u00ae Terminator v1.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit, Applied Biosystems) using betaine at a final concentration of 1 M to resolve secondary structures in the DNA.\n\nTo characterize the phylogenetic placement of the novel virus, 38 NS1 amino acid sequences of known parvoviruses were downloaded from the GenBank database and aligned together with the one predicted in this study from the obtained nucleotide sequence using the Cobalt Multiple Alignment Tool (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/cobalt/). Only complete sequences were included in the analysis. Alignments were manually edited when needed with BioEdit software version 7.0.5.3 (Hall, 1999) and then used for phylogenetic inference. A model selection was performed to identify the best model for distance estimation and phylogenetic trees were constructed with Mega software version 6.06 (Tamura et al., 2013) using the Maximum-likelihood method (Felsenstein, 1981). To test the robustness of the analysis a bootstrap analysis (1000 replicates) (Felsenstein, 1985) was performed and only clusters associated with a value higher than 75% were considered significant.\n\nTo identify possible mutation between viral sequences amplified from different tissues or different time points, nucleotide sequences were aligned using ClustalX version 2.1 (Larkin et al., 2007) and identities between sequences were calculated with BioEdit software version 7.0.9.0 (Hall, 1999).\n\nDNA secondary structure predictions were obtained using the mfold web server (http://mfold.rna.albany.edu/?q=mfold/download-mfold).\n\nThe genomic sequence obtained in this study has been deposited in the GenBank database under the accession number KP120516.\n\nDuring the postmortem examination the principal observations included a significantly enlarged spleen with a homogeneous cut surface and a mottled liver with irregular patches of pallor. Pancreatic and mediastinal lymph nodes were enlarged.\n\nIncidental lesions included a cystic mass in the right mammary gland and several small ulcers in the fundus of the stomach. Histologic examination of the spleen revealed a loss of normal architecture and an intense infiltration of neoplastic round to polygonal cells with moderate variation in cell and nuclear sizes (anisocytosis and anisokaryosis). Mitotic figures were common and multinucleate cells were occasionally seen. In the liver there were similar neoplastic cell aggregates surrounding the portal veins and the central veins, expanding the associated connective tissue. Ingested red blood cells (erythrophagocytosis) by neoplastic cells were also observed. Affected lymph nodes were characterized by a loss of normal architecture which was replaced by sheets of round to polygonal neoplastic cells similar to those found in the liver and spleen. These findings led to a diagnosis of disseminated histiocytic sarcoma.\n\nAdditional findings included evidence of an apocrine gland cyst causing the mass in the right mammary gland. In addition there was evidence of inflammation and necrosis in the adrenal glands associated with a protozoal infection, interpreted to be Toxoplasma gondii. In addition, large deeply basophilic intranuclear inclusions were found in a minority of adrenal cortical cells. Renal tubules contained eosinophilic droplets in the epithelial cells, as is often seen in mice with histiocytic sarcoma, although the cause is not known. Chronic interstitial nephritis was also evident.\n\nTo explore the possibility of viral involvement in the etiopathogenesis of the HS we used VIDISCA-454, a sequence independent virus identification technique which is able to detect virtually any DNA and RNA virus from various clinical samples (van der Hoek et al., 2004; Canuti et al., 2011; Jazaeri Farsani et al., 2013; Tan et al., 2013; Canuti et al., 2014; Oude Munnink et al., 2014; Pariani et al., 2014). A total of 8003 sequence reads were obtained from the serum sample of the slow loris with HS and, among these, 5 sequences were identified with homology to different members of the Parvovirinae subfamily: 3 were identified with blastn (nucleotide identity: 62\u201370%) and 2 were only recognizable when identity search was performed at amino acid level (amino acid identity: 69\u201382%). Those recognized as viral fragments were used as template for primer design, and a combination of specific PCRs and genome walking techniques allowed retrieval of the almost complete genomic sequence of the virus (only part of the terminal repeats is lacking), which was tentatively named Slow Loris parvovirus 1 (Sl.L-PV-1). The genomic sequence allowed us to identify 3 further viral sequences which were not identifiable via identity search. In total 35 reads (0.44% of the total) belonged to the novel virus.\n\nThe rules set by the parvovirus study group in the latest ICTV report mention that a novel parvovirus, which lacked isolation, can be classified within the Parvoviridae family only if the complete coding sequence is provided and the typical parvoviral motif patterns can be recognized (Cotmore et al., 2013).\n\nThe genome of the novel parvovirus is 4844 nt and the genomic organization reflects the other members of the Parvovirinae subfamily with 2 large ORFs and terminal sequences which form end loop structures important for viral replication, although the structure of the loops could not be entirely resolved since only partial sequences could be retrieved (Figure 2) (Berns, 1990). The first ORF\u2014located at the 5\u2032 part of the genome (nt 146\u20131894)\u2014putatively encodes for the non-structural protein NS1 (582 AA). The second ORF\u2014located at the 3\u2032 part (nt 2187\u20134655)\u2014encodes for the capsid protein VP1 (822 AA).\n\nOther molecular features typical of parvoviruses were also identified (Figure 2). A phospholipase A2 domain of Sl.L-PV-1, that is conserved in the majority of parvoviruses and which is essential for viral genome transfer to the nucleus, is located at the N-terminal part of the VP1 unique region and contains the typical PLA2 catalytic domain (HDXXY, AA 140\u2013144) and Ca++ binding loop (YXGXG, AA 117\u2013121) (Z\u00e1dori et al., 2001).\n\nAnother molecular marker of parvoviruses is the presence of conserved helicase sequence motifs in the NS1 protein (Walker et al., 1997; Lou et al., 2012). Within the carboxy-terminal half of the NS1 protein of Sl.L-PV-1 (AA 336-423) the typical ATP binding loop or p-loop (Walker box A: GXXXXGK(T/S)) could be identified, immediately followed by the Mg++ binding Walker B (hhhh(D/E)E) and B' motifs. Finally, the C motif (a stretch of hydrophobic residues usually followed by asparagine), common to the helicases belonging to the superfamily type III, was also present (Figure 2).\n\nWe were able to obtain only part of the sequences from the terminal non coding regions, 148 and 192 nt of the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 end respectively. An alignment of these 2 sequences shows that they are 100% identical (but oriented in the opposite direction) and start differentiating from the ATG start codon of NS1, which becomes ACG on the 3\u2032 side terminal sequence (Figure 3). These data suggest that Sl.L-PV-1 possesses identical inverted terminal repeats. Besides, a 44 nt sequence was identified which is present only on the 3\u2032 side of the genome, just after the TAA stop codon of VP1/VP2, that contains a 21 nt region that can fold into a small hairpin (Figures 2, 3).\n\nPhylogenetic analysis of Sl.L-PV-1 was performed using the predicted amino acid sequences of the NS1 protein belonging to members of the Parvovirinae subfamily (Figure 4). In the phylogenetic tree the 8 Parvovirinae genera are indicated: each defined cluster was supported by a significant bootstrap value (between 93 and 100). Only 2 viruses did not cluster in any of these 8 clades: a parvovirus identified in Artibeus jamaicensis fruit bat (Aj-Bt-PV-1, which we previously reported as the first member of a novel parvovirus genus, Canuti et al., 2011) and the Sl.L-PV-1. Both viruses are located between the Dependoparvovirus and the Tetraparvovirus genera and do not significantly cluster with any other known parvovirus, possibly representing 2 independent still undefined genera.\n\nTo better clarify the relationship between Sl.L-PV-1 and the most closely related parvoviruses, the amino acid identities of both NS1 and VP1 proteins within and between the clades were calculated (Table 1). Considering NS1 protein, the virus with the highest identity to Sl.L-PV-1 was the Bovine adeno-associated virus (BAAV, 29.1%), followed by other members of the Dependoparvovirus genus, which, on average, was the clade closest to Sl.L-PV-1. The Tetraparvovirus clade and Aj-Bt-PV-1 are approximately equidistant from Sl.L-PV-1. The same trend could be noted for Aj-Bt-PV-1.\n\nThe classification rules for parvoviruses state that a genus is defined as a monophyletic group in which the NS1 amino acidic sequences of all included viruses are generally more than 30% identical to each other and less than 30% identical to those of other genera (Cotmore et al., 2013). According to our analysis, both Aj-Bt-PV-1 and Sl.L-PV-1 could be considered the first members of 2 novel genera: their NS1 amino acid sequences are less than 30% identical to the ones of the viruses in the closest genera (Table 1), less than 25 and 27% respectively, and they are not part of a bootstrap supported monophyletic group (Figure 4).\n\nTwenty serum and 61 organ samples altogether belonging to 25 individuals (18 N. coucang and 7 N. pygmaeus) were screened for the presence of Sl.L-PV-1, but only samples collected from the animal in which the virus was originally identified were positive. All organs collected during necropsy were positive for the virus, with high viral loads as shown in Table 2. Liver, spleen, and kidneys were the organs where the virus reached the highest loads.\n\nSurprisingly, all blood/serum samples collected at different time points were PCR positive. Those samples were collected from Buddha on a time frame of 8 years (from the year 2000 until 2008) and the virus was constantly found at moderately high concentrations, with the highest titre found in whole blood (5.39E + 08 DNA copies/ml) 7 months prior to the death of the animal (Table 2).\n\nA 1231 nt fragment of the VP1 ORF end was sequenced from all positive samples in order to detect variation between different body sites or among the 8 years of infection: 16 polymorphic sites were noted (Table 3). The polymorphisms predominantly included transitions (81.25%, 13/16) and only two were non-synonymous. If we consider only the sequences obtained from serum there is an accumulation of 5 substitutions (all transitions located between codons 405 and 536) during the years, one of which leads to an amino acid change. However, no fixation can be accounted if we consider altogether the sequences from 2008 (those retrieved both from serum and from all the organs).\n\nThe appearance of new variable sites over time can also be noted, like at codon position 645 where a polymorphism appeared only in 2008. Interesting to notice is that kidneys and, most of all, the intestine are the locations where most polymorphic sites characterizing earlier time points were conserved (positions 742, 763, and 777).\n\nSince the virus was detected in samples collected from Buddha during 8 years the presence of integrated or episomal viral genomes could be postulated. Besides, the disruption of an oncolytic gene caused by viral integration could have been at the origin of the HS and therefore the presence of integrated viral genomes in all tissues (including whole blood) was investigated by means of three different methods - since the integration location could not be predicted (Figure 1). No evidence for integrated viruses could be found. In addition, there was also no evidence of a circular covalently closed genomic form which could have persisted in tissues as an episomal form.\n\nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
