{"title": "Kingdom of Saudi Arabia b Ministry of Health", "body": "Since the emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, there have been 755 cases with a total 320 deaths in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. 1 The virus was initially thought to affect older adults and those with underlying medical conditions. 2 The reporting of asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic cases decreased the overall mortality rate and the mean age. 3 Data on viral kinetics in the respiratory tract and other body fluids are scarce. In a recent case study, MERS-CoV shedding from the respiratory tract was detected until day 24 of illness. 4 In this study we investigated the viral shedding of MERS-CoV in the respiratory secretions of patients who were ill and those with mild disease who underwent repeated testing.\n\nPatients who underwent more than one virological test for MERS-CoV at least 1 day apart were included in the analysis. Repeat testing was done non-systematically using respiratory tract samples from September 1, 2012 to September 31, 2013.\n\nThe types of respiratory specimen collected from patients and contacts were sputum samples, nose and throat swabs, nasopharyngeal swabs, and endotracheal aspirate samples.\n\nWith regard to MERS-CoV screening, clinical samples were screened by real-time PCR (RT-PCR) amplification test, as described previously, with amplification targeting both the upstream E protein gene (upE) and ORF1a for confirmation; these are standard assays used in KSA for MERS-CoV testing. 2 The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate the time to negative repeat MERS-CoV RT-PCR test. 'Positive test' curves were drawn for patients and contacts who had repeated testing. The statistical significance of the difference between the curves was assessed using a log-rank test. SPSS software (SPSS for Windows, Version 11. Chicago, IL: SPSS Inc.; 2002) was used for the analysis.\n\nTwenty-six individuals (13 patients and 13 contacts) underwent repeat respiratory sample testing until a negative test result was obtained. Table 1 shows the specimen type by category. Most samples from MERS-CoV cases were tracheal aspirate/sputum (p = 0.0006) and most samples from contacts were nose and throat swabs (p = 0.0002). The Kaplan-Meier curve showed that contacts cleared the virus at a much earlier time than patients ( Figure 1 ). On day 12, 30% of contacts and 76% of cases were still positive for MERS-CoV by PCR.\n\nThe viral kinetics and the time of shedding of MERS-CoV in the respiratory tract are not known. In previous case reports, MERS-CoV was isolated from the respiratory tract secretions up to day 24 in one patient, 4 and day 18 in another. 6 In this large retrospective analysis, cases had more prolonged viral shedding from the respiratory tract than contacts. The difference is related to the severity of the disease and the significant underlying comorbidities among the cases. However, the study did not examine viral shedding systematically and thus patients with more severe disease may have been selected for repeat testing rather than those who had milder disease. A systematic and prospective study is required to further delineate the kinetics of MERS-CoV, not only in respiratory secretions but also in other body fluids (blood, urine, and stool). The reporting of these data is important to further characterize the pathogenesis of this disease and for better application of the infection prevention and control measures required. The need to quantify the viral load is also very important for any recommendations regarding the need for isolation of those who continue to have positive MERS-CoV by PCR. The presence of viral RNA in respiratory secretions may indicate a replicating or a dead virus.\n\nAlthough the data showed a difference between cases and contacts -contacts had more upper respiratory tract swabs tested, while cases had lower respiratory tract samples tested -the difference could be attributed to the sample type rather than the exposure type. We have previously shown that lower respiratory tract samples yield higher MERS-CoV viral loads and genome fractions than upper respiratory tract samples. 7 Since cases had lower respiratory tract samples collected more often than upper respiratory tract samples, this indicates that cases were more ill and probably shed virus much longer. This finding, if confirmed by the prospective systematic collection of respiratory samples, would highlight the importance of applying prolonged infection control measures in severely ill patients with MERS-CoV in the healthcare setting. The pattern of transmission of MERS-CoV is well characterized as sporadic, intra-familial, and healthcareassociated. [8] [9] [10] The transmission of MERS-CoV within healthcare facilities was noted in the Al-Hasa outbreak, 11 and of 95 cases in one report, 63.2% were healthcare-associated and 13.7% were intra-familial transmission. 12 In support of the low infectivity of asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic cases is the finding of a low transmission rate within family contacts. 13 Conflict of interest: No conflict of interest to declare.
