{"title": "The first-in-class peptide binder to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein 5 6", "body": "A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) from Wuhan, China, has caused 207,855 confirmed 53 cases and 8,648 deaths globally, according to the COVID-19 situation report from WHO on Mar 54 19, 2020 (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/), 55 and the number is continually growing. Similar to the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002, SARS-CoV-2 56 causes severe respiratory problems. Coughing, fever, difficulties in breathing and/or shortage of 57 breath are the common symptoms. Aged patients with pre-existing medical conditions are at most 58 risk with a mortality rate ~1.5% or even higher in some regions. Moreover, human-to-human 59 transmission can occur rapidly by close contact. To slow this pandemic and treat infected patients, 60 rapid development of specific antiviral drugs is of the highest urgency. 61\n\nThe closely-related SARS-CoV coronavirus invades host cells by binding the angiotensin-62 converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on human cell surface through its viral spike protein (S) [1-63 4] . It was recently established that SARS-CoV-2 uses the same receptor for host cell entry [5, 6] . 64\n\nRecent crystallographic studies of the SARS-CoV-2-S receptor binding domain (RBD) and full-65 length human ACE2 receptor revealed key amino acid residues at the contact interface between 66 the two proteins and provide valuable structural information that can be leveraged for the 67 development of disruptors specific for the SARS-CoV-2/ACE2 protein-protein interaction (PPI) [7, 68 8] . Small-molecule inhibitors are often less effective at disrupting extended protein binding 69 interfaces [9] . Peptides, on the other hand, offer a synthetically accessible solution to disrupt PPIs 70 by binding at interface regions containing multiple contact \"hot spots\" [10] . 71\n\nWe hypothesize that disruption of the viral SARS-CoV-2-RBD-host ACE2 interaction with 72 peptide-based binders will prevent virus entry into human cells, offering a novel opportunity for 73 therapeutic intervention. Toward this aim, we launched a campaign to rapidly discover peptide 74 binders to SARS-CoV-2-RBD. Analyzing the RBD-ACE2 co-crystal structure, we found that 75 SARS-CoV-2-RBD/ACE2 interface spans a large elongated surface area, as is common for PPIs. 76 .

Using bio-layer interferometry, we determined that SBP1 binds 79 SARS-CoV-2-RBD with low nanomolar affinity (dissociation constant, K D = 47 nM). SBP1 is a 80 first-in-class peptide binder to SARS-CoV-2-RBD, potentially inhibiting entry of the virus into 81 human cells. In addition, the human protein-derived sequence of SBP1 is fully proteinogenic, and 82\n\nis not expected to be immunogenic. Taken together, computational simulations coupled with 83 automated flow peptide synthesis technology enable an accelerated discovery loop from design 84 to experimental validation, and rapidly delivered SBP1 as a promising pre-clinical drug lead. \n\nUsing the Amber force field [12], a helical peptide sequence (spike-binding peptide 1, 92 SBP1) derived from the \u03b11 helix of ACE2 peptidase domain (ACE2-PD) in complex with SARS-93\n\nCoV-2-RBD was simulated under TIP3P explicit water conditions. Analyzing the simulation 94 trajectory after 200 ns, we found that SBP1 remains on the spike RBD protein surface in a stable The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.19.999318 doi: bioRxiv preprint Automated fast-flow peptide synthesis yielded >95% pure compound 102\n\nThe two biotinylated peptides, SBP1 and SBP2, derived from the \u03b11 helix were prepared 103 by automated fast-flow peptide synthesis [11, 13] with a total synthesis time of 1.5 h for a total of 104 35 couplings. After cleavage from resin, global deprotection, and subsequent C18 solid-phase 105 extraction, the purity of the crude peptides was estimated to be >95% for both biotinylated SBP1 106 and SBP2 based on LC-MS TIC chromatograms (supplemental Fig. 1A and 1B). We assessed 107 this purity as acceptable for direct downstream biological characterizations. 108\n\nBio-layer interferometry was employed to measure the affinity of synthesized peptides 110 (e.g., SBP1) to glycosylated SARS-CoV-2-RBD or the human protein menin as a negative control. 111\n\nBiotinylated peptide was immobilized onto streptavidin (SA) biosensors. After fitting the 112 association and dissociation curves from serial dilutions of protein, the dissociation constant (KD) 113 of SBP1 to the RBD was determined to be 47 nM with the average K on = 4.69 \u00d7 10 4 M -1 s -1 and 114 K off = 2.2 \u00d7 10 -3 s -1 (Fig. 2E ). However, SBP2 (a truncate of SBP1) did not associate with the spike 115 RBD protein (Fig. 2F ). SBP1 had no observable binding to the negative control human protein 116 menin (Fig. 2G ). Together, these data indicate that SBP1 specifically binds SARS-CoV-2-RBD 117 with low nanomolar affinity. 118 119\n\nRecently published cryo-EM and co-crystal structures of the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 with 121 human ACE2 have identified this PPI as key step for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 to human cells. 122\n\nBlocking this binding interface represents a highly promising therapeutic strategy, as it could 123 potentially hinder SARS-CoV-2 from entering cells and replicating. 124 .

Small molecule compounds are unlikely to bind 126 large protein surfaces that do not have distinct binding pockets. Peptides, on the other hand, 127 display a larger surface area and chemical functionalities that can mimic and disrupt the native 128 PPI, as is the case for the clinically approved HIV peptide drug Fuzeon [14, 15] . 129\n\nThe identification of a suitable starting point for drug discovery campaigns can be time- were smaller than 0.8 nm from starting coordinates ( Fig. 2A) . These results indicated the potential 138 of identifying a SARS-CoV-2-RBD-binding peptide derived from the human ACE2 \u03b11 helix. 139 A 23-mer peptide sequence (SBP1) was synthesized by automated flow peptide synthesis. 140\n\nThe 23 residues selected from the ACE2 \u03b11 helix sequence (IEEQAKTFLDKFNHEAEDLFYQS) 141 showed low fluctuations along the MD simulation trajectory and several important interactions 142 with the spike protein were observed consistently with multiple lines of published data [8, 16] . We 143 decided to use this peptide (SBP1) as an experimental starting point for the development of a 144 SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binder. Our rapid automated flow peptide synthesizer [11, 13] enabled 145 the synthesis of tens of milligrams of SBP1 peptide within minutes. The crude purity was 146 determined to be >95% and therefore sufficient for binding validation by bio-layer interferometry 147 (BLI). 148 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder. It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10. 1101 /2020 The interaction between SBP1 and the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was validated 149 by bio-layer interferometry. The K D , derived from protein association and dissociation kinetics, 150 was found to be 47 nM after averaging the fitting values at different protein concentrations (Fig.  151   2E ). This binding affinity is comparable with that of full length ACE2 binding to SARS-CoV-2-RBD 152 (14.7 nM) [7] . Excess of SBP1 therefore, could potentially cover spike proteins on SARS-CoV-2 153 surface and outcompete the binding for ACE2. Further optimization of the sequence length and 154 amino acid composition are in progress, in order produce binders with higher PPI inhibitory activity. 155 SBP1 is a \"fully human,\" endogenous peptide and therefore likely to be well tolerated by 156 the human immune system. The amino acid sequence of SBP1 is entirely derived from human 157 ACE2 and should be recognized as endogenous by the human immune system. This feature 158 could be highly beneficial in later stages of pre-clinical development. Challenges associated with 159 peptide drugs, such as proteolytic degradation and rapid renal elimination, will be addressed in 160 the near future by chemical modifications of the sequence. 161\n\nIn conclusion, a peptide sequence derived from human ACE2 was found to bind the 162 SARS-CoV-2 spike protein RBD with low nanomolar affinity. We believe disruption of the SARS-163\n\nCoV-2-RBD/ACE2 binding interface with high-affinity peptides represents a promising strategy for 164 preventing virus entry in human cells and paves the way for new COVID-19 treatment and 165 diagnostic modalities. Upon request, we will make available our peptide binder and all upcoming 166 optimized variants to research facilities testing and developing potential COVID-19 treatments. 167\n\nRapid discovery, synthesis, and testing of potential drug leads should help the global scientific 168 and healthcare communities efficiently address the ongoing crisis.

Amber 177 force field was used to model the protein and peptide. The MD simulation system was equilibrated 178 at 300 K for 2 ns. Periodic boundary conditions were used and long-range electrostatic 179 interactions were calculated with particle mesh Ewald method, with non-bonded cutoff set to 12.0 180 \u00c5. SHAKE algorithm was used to constrain bonds involving hydrogen atoms. Time step is 2 fs 181 and the trajectories were recorded every 10 ps. After simulation production runs, trajectory files 182 were loaded into the VMD software for further analysis. \n\nAfter peptide synthesis, the peptidyl resin was rinsed with dichloromethane briefly and then dried 193 in a vacuum chamber overnight. Next day, approximately 5 mL of cleavage solution (94% TFA, 194 1% TIPS, 2.5% EDT, 2.5% water) was added into the syringe containing the resin. The syringe 195 was kept at room temperature for 2 h before injecting the cleavage solution into a 50 mL conical 196 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.
