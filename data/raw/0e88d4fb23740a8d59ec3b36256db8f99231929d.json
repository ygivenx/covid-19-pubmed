{"title": "MATHEMATICAL PREDICTIONS FOR COVID-19 AS A GLOBAL PANDEMIC", "body": "A recent study by Nesteruk (2020) and Ming and Zhang (2020) focuses on the epidemic outbreak cased by COVID-19 coronavirus due to the global trend of the pandemic with its origin from mainland China. In his study, Nesteruk (2020) used the popular SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Removed) model to obtain optimal values for the model parameters with the use of statistical approach and hence predicated the number of infected, susceptible and removed persons versus time. This model approach by Nesteruk (2020) has been a major breakthrough in modelling disease control as used by several authors (Ming and Zhang, 2020 and Kimbir (2018) among others). However, although there exist a global interest in knowing the rate of infection that will occur over time globally, it is of great interest to propose a mathematical model for the end in the spread and subsequent elimination of the virus. Hence, in this study we adopt solutions from Victor and Oduwole (2020) for a new deterministic endemic model (Susceptible -Exposed -Infectious -Removed -Undetectable -Susceptible: SEIRUS) originally developed for the control of the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Africa.\n\nThe resulting equations are a system of coupled homogenous differential equations. Numerical experiments with relevant simulation showing how the variation of the reproductive number (R0) affect the number of infected individuals is carried out. Conscious effort through evaluating the new deterministic SEIRUS model is done to reduce the reproductive number (R0) to zero for a possible halt of the spread of the disease thereby leading to an endemic equilibrium to eradicate the disease in a later time in the future.\n\nIn summary, this study aims to develop and evaluate the new deterministic endemic SEIRUS compartmental model of the COVID-19 coronavirus dynamics which combines quarantine/observatory procedures and behavioral change/social distancing in the control and eradication of the disease in the most exposed sub-population.\n\nThe wide spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus and the lack or inefficiency of purposeful and result based intervention is a great call for other empirical and scientific interventions which seeks to review strategic models and recommendations of social and scientific research for disease control.\n\nAlthough previous studies have been tailored towards the epidemiology and the disease-free equilibrium where the reproductive number of the infectious population is at its barest minimum, this study seeks to study the evaluative impact of the endemic equilibrium of a new endemic deterministic model while taking into consideration that possibility of the recovered population being Undetectable and fit to be moved to the Susceptible compartment which will therefore imply a zero secondary infection of the disease globally.\n\nAlso, this research work will contribute significantly to recent research findings by Nesteruk (2020) and Ming and Zhang (2020) as well as inform government, non-government organizations as well as policy maker's decision on sustainable policies to prevent the spread of the disease based on specific age groups of the active population.\n\n.

An infected individual is one who has contracted the coronavirus and is at some stage of infection. A removed individual is one that is confirmed to have the virus with its expected symptoms and is under quarantine while following relevant observatory procedures. A member of the undetectable class is one that has been removed and does not secrete the virus anymore and has been satisfied by the WHO standard to be in the undetectable class.\n\nThe following diagram describes the dynamic of SEIRUS framework, and will be useful in the formulation of model equations.\n\n.

This implies that as a pandemic as declared by WHO (2020) the COVID-19 coronavirus does not have a curative vaccine yet and precautionary measures are advised through quarantine and observatory procedures. Also, the Basic Reproductive number ( 0 < 1) by Equation (33) shows that there is a chance of decline of secondary infections when the ratio between the incidence rate in the population and the total number of infected population quarantined with observatory procedure.\n\nThe effort to evaluate the disease equilibrium shows that unless there is a dedicated effort from government, decision makers and stakeholders, the world would hardly be reed of the COVID-19\n\ncoronavirus and further spread is eminent. Therefore, as corroborated by the studies of Nesteruk (2020) and Ming and Zhang (2020) , the rate of infection will continue to increase despite the increased rate of recovery because of the absence of vaccine at the moment.\n\nMeanwhile, with observatory procedures and quarantine the rate of recovery will not only be enhanced, the chances of total recovery where the virus nor it symptoms will be undetectable is achievable as the rate of detection becomes negligibly small in the bodies of the recovered population.\n\n.
