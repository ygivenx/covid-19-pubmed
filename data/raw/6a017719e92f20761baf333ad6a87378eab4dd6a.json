{"title": "Priming with rAAV encoding RBD of SARS-CoV S protein and boosting with RBD-specific peptides for T cell epitopes increase T cell responses and provide protection against SRAS-CoV infection NIH Public Access Author Manuscript", "body": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is the latest-reported emerging infectious disease caused by SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Since the end of the SARS outbreak in July, 2003, a number of SARS cases have been sporadically reported, raising a serious safety concern [1] [2] [3] . The presence of natural reservoir also suggests that there is a risk for reintroduction of SARS-CoV-like virus from animals into humans [4] . The development of prevention strategies, particularly the generation of effective and safe vaccines against SARS-CoV, therefore, is an important task in current SARS research.\n\nMost existing vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV are based on the S protein. Studies have shown that vaccination of African green monkeys with an attenuated parainfluenza virus encoding SARS-CoV S protein results in the production of SARS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies, protecting vaccinated animals from subsequent SARS-CoV challenge [5] . It is also indicated that the S, among all structural proteins of SARS-CoV, is the only significant neutralization and protective antigen, and that a single mucosal immunization with S protein efficiently suppresses SARS-CoV infection [6] . Furthermore, the receptor-binding domain (RBD), a fragment of S protein, has been demonstrated to be a major neutralization determinant in the development of subunit vaccines against SARS [7, 8] . These reports suggest that S protein of SARS-CoV, especially RBD, is highly effective in prevention of SARS.\n\nRecently, it has been reported that strategies in using combination of different vaccines improve humoral or cellular immune responses. Prime with SARS-CoV S-expressing DNA and boost with adenoviral vector encoding S induce optimal CD8 T cell immunity, while boost with the inactivated SARS-CoV plus adjuvant stimulate the CD4 T cell immunity and the antibody response [9] . The humoral immune response and IFN-\u03b3 secretion were also enhanced by priming with DNA-based vaccine and boosting with a recombinant adenovirus encoding N protein of SARS-CoV [10] . These reports demonstrate that an ideal SARS vaccine can be developed by rational design of appropriate prime-boost strategies.\n\nWe have previously reported that a recombinant adeno-associated virus encoding RBD of SARS-CoV S protein (RBD-rAAV) induced SARS-CoV-specific IgG antibody with neutralizing activity [11] . In the RBD region, a CD4 + T cell epitope, N60 (residues 435-444: NYNYKYRYLR) and a CD8 + T cell epitope, N50 (residues 365-374, KCYGVSATKL) have been identified respectively [12, 13] . In this study, we primed with RBD-rAAV and boosted with RBD-peptides (RBD-Pep) specific for CD4 + and CD8 + T cell epitopes and compared the immune responses and protective effects to those vaccinated with RBD-rAAV or RBD-Pep alone in a mouse model.\n\nRBD-rAAV was produced as previously described [11] . Briefly, RBD-rAAV plasmid was cotransfected with pHelper and pAAV-RC plasmids into HEK293T cells using a calcium phosphate transfection method (Stratagene, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfected cells and supernatant were harvested 72 h post-transfection. After purification and titration as described previously [11] , RBD-rAAV was adjusted to 10 12 viral particles (VP)/ ml in PBS. Peptides N50 (CD8 + T cell epitope) and N60 (CD4 + T cell epitope) derived from RBD of SARS-CoV S protein [13] , plus CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) 1826 (TCC ATG ACG TTC CTG ACG TT) (RBD-Pep) were used for prime and boost immunizations in this study.\n\nFemale BALB/c mice at the age of 4 -6 weeks were used for the vaccination. All mice for the study were purchased from Laboratory Animal Unit (LAU) in the University of Hong Kong. Animals were housed in the animal facility of the Department of Microbiology, University of Hong Kong, and maintained in accordance with the animal care protocol. All of the animal studies were approved by the Department of Health, the Government of Hong Kong Special Administration Region (SAR).\n\nMice were vaccinated following protocols described previously with some modifications [11, 14] . Mice were separated into 4 groups (9 mice per group) and primed with RBD-rAAV [intramuscular (i.m.), 2 \u00d7 10 11 VP /200 \u03bcl)] or RBD-peptides (N50 and N60, 50 \u03bcg each) plus CpG ODN (25 \u03bcg) [subcutaneous, (s.c.)] or blank AAV, and boosted with RBD-rAAV or RBD-Pep or AAV, respectively. Each group was further divided into two subgroups (5 mice in subgroup 1 and 4 mice in subgroup 2). Forty days after the first immunization, the mice in the subgroup 1 were anesthetized with diethyl ether. Their sera were collected by retro-orbital puncture for detection of IgG and neutralizing antibodies (NA) by ELISA and neutralizing assay, respectively. The spleens were harvested for detection of T cell immunity by ELISPOT and flow cytometry analysis. The mice in the subgroup 2 were challenged with SARS-CoV and lung samples were collected for viral load detection 3 days post-challenge (Fig. 1 ).\n\nSpecific CD4 and CD8 T cells in vaccinated mice were detected by ELISPOT mouse kit (Mabtech, Sweden) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, 96-well ELISPOT plates were coated with anti-IL-4, -IL-10 and -IFN-\u03b3 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) overnight at 4\u00b0C\n\n, and blocked by sterile RPMI-1640 containing 10% FBS for 2 h at room temperature. Singlecell suspensions prepared from spleens of vaccinated mice were added to the wells at the concentration of 2 \u00d7 10 5 cells/well. Cells were incubated for 24 h in the presence or absence of the RBD-peptide N50 or N60 (1 \u03bcg/ml) plus anti-mouse CD28 (1 \u03bcg/ml; BD Pharmingen, USA) at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO 2 , followed by washes with PBS. The cells were sequentially incubated with biotinylated labeled anti-mouse IL-4, IL-10 and IFN-\u03b3 mAbs at 1: 1000 for 2 h at room temperature, streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (HRP) for 1 h at room temperature and 3,3\u2032 ,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate solutions for around 15 min, with extensive washes between incubations. The spots of IL-4, IL-10 and IFN-\u03b3-producing T cells were counted by ELISPOT reader system and ImmunoSpot 3 software (Cellular Technology Ltd., Ohio, USA).\n\nSpecific CD8 T cells in vaccinated mice were further measured by intracellular cytokine staining and flow cytomety analysis. Single-cell suspensions (2 \u00d7 10 6 ) from spleens of vaccinated mice were stimulated with or without the RBD-peptide N50 (1 \u03bcg/ml) plus anti-CD28 antibody (1 \u03bcg/ml). Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA, 5 ng/ml; Sigma, USA) and ionomycin (250 ng/ml; Sigma) were used as positive controls. Cells with stimulatory agents were incubated for 5 h at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2 in the presence of GolgiPlug TM containing Brefeldin A (1 \u03bcl/ml; BD Pharmingen). The cells were fixed using Cytofix/Cytoperm TM Plus kit in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol (BD Pharmingen), and stained directly with conjugated mAbs specific for cell surface antigens [anti-mouse-CD3 (PerCP) and anti-mouse-CD8 (APC)] and intracellular cytokines [anti-mouse-IL-2 (PE) and anti-mouse-IFN-\u03b3 (FITC); BD Pharmingen] for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C. Appropriate isotype-matched controls for cytokines were included in each staining. Data were acquired using a flow cytometer (FACSCaliber, BD, USA). Lymphocyte population was gated by forward light scatter versus side light scatter, and 20,000 events for CD3 + CD8 + lymphocyte subpopulation were acquired to determine the percentage of CD8 + T cells positive for specific cytokines. Data were analyzed by CellQuest software (BD Biosciences, USA).\n\nSpecific IgG antibody against SARS-CoV in sera of vaccinated mice was tested by ELISA using the protocol described previously with some modification [11] . Briefly, serially diluted mouse sera were added to 96-well microtiter plates pre-coated with the protein mixture from SARS-CoV viral lysates. The plates were incubated at 37 \u00baC for 30 min, followed by four washes with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T). Bound antibodies were then reacted with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (DAKO, Denmark) at 37 \u00baC for 20 min. After four washes, TMB substrate solutions were added to the plates and the reaction was stopped by adding 1N H 2 SO 4 . The absorbance at 450 nm was measured by an ELISA plate reader (Victor 1420 Multilabel Counter, PerkinElmer, USA).\n\nTiters of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV in sera of vaccinated mice were measured by neutralization assay in Vero E6 cells as previously described [11, 15, 16] . Briefly, cells were seeded at 10 4 /well in 96-well culture plates and cultured at 37 \u00b0C to form a monolayer. Serial 2-fold dilutions of serum samples were separately mixed with 100 TCID 50 of SARS-CoV GZ50 strain (GenBank accession no. AY304495), incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h, and added to the monolayer of Vero E6 cells in tetraplicate. Cells infected with 100 TCID 50 SARS-CoV and without the virus were applied as positive and negative controls, respectively. Cytopathic effect (CPE) in each well was observed daily and recorded on day 3 post-infection. The neutralizing titers of mouse antisera that completely prevented CPE in 50% of the wells were calculated by Reed-Muench method.\n\nForty days post-vaccination, mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane and i.n. inoculated with 50 \u03bcl of SARS-CoV strain GZ50 (5 \u00d7 10 5 TCID 50 ) according to the national animal care and use guidelines in an approved animal BSL-3 laboratory. The mice were sacrificed 3 days after virus challenge and mouse lungs were removed. The lung tissues were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C for virological tests.\n\nThe viral RNA copies in lung tissues of challenged mice were determined by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (Q-RT-PCR) according to the protocol described previously with some modification [15, 17, 18] . Briefly, total RNA was extracted from 20 mg of lung tissues using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen Inc, USA). cDNA was synthesized using random primers and SuperScript II RT kit (Invitrogen, USA). Extracted RNA (10 \u03bcl) was reverse transcribed in a 20 \u03bcl reaction mixture containing 1 \u00d7 first strand buffer, 100 mM DTT, 10 mM each dNTP, 50 ng random primers, 40 U RNaseOUT, and 200 U SSIIRT at 42\u00b0C for 50 min, followed by 15 min at 70 \u00b0C. The solution was incubated with RNase H (Invitrogen, USA) at 37 \u00b0C for 20 min. Synthesized cDNA was quantified using Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, USA) in 20 \u03bcl mixture containing 5 \u03bcl cDNA (1 : 10), 10 \u03bcl 2 \u00d7 Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix, 3 \u03bcl RNase-free H 2 O, 10 \u03bcM forward primer F (5'-GCTTAGGCCCTTTGAGAGAGACA-3') and reverse primer R (5'-GCCAATGCCAGTAGTGGTGTAA-3') in Mx3000 QPCR System (Stratagene, USA).\n\nValues were presented as mean with standard error (SE). Statistical significance among different vaccination groups was calculated by Student's t test using Stata statistical software. The P values less than 0.05 were considered significant.\n\nTh1 and Th2 responses induced by vaccinations were evaluated by detection of IFN-\u03b3 producing cells (Th1) and IL-4-/IL-10-secreting cells (Th2) in splenocyte cultures of vaccinated mice 24 h post-stimulation with N60, a peptide corresponding to the CD4 + T cell epitope in RBD. As shown in Fig. 2 , RBD-rAAV prime/RBD-Pep boost vaccination induced similar frequencies of IFN-\u03b3-producing cells (Th1) as those of RBD-rAAV prime/RBD-rAAV boost (P > 0.05), which were significantly higher than those of other groups (P < 0.05) ( Fig.  2A) . RBD-rAAV prime/RBD-Pep boost immunization elicited a higher level (P < 0.05) of IL-4-producting Th2 cells which are responsible for up-regulation of immune responses, but a lower level (P < 0.05) of IL-10-secreting Th2 cells that play roles in down-regulation of immune responses, as compared to those of RBD-rAAV prime/RBD-rAAV boost vaccination (Fig. 2B, 2C) . However, boost doses of RBD-Pep or blank AAV did not induce significant generation of IL-4-and IL-10-producing Th2 cells in the vaccinated mice (Fig. 2B, 2C) . The above results suggested that RBD-rAAV prime/RBD-peptide boost vaccination was able to induce similar Th1 and stronger Th2 responses than RBD-rAAV prime/RBD-rAAV boost vaccination.\n\nTo examine the induction of CTL responses by different vaccination protocols, cells from spleens of vaccinated mice were stimulated with or without RBD-peptide N50 (CD8 + T cell epitope) and detected for IFN-\u03b3-and IL-2-producing cells by ELISPOT. As shown in Fig. 3A , RBD-rAAV prime/RBD-Pep boost vaccination induced the highest level of IFN-\u03b3-secreting cells (197 SFC/10 6 splenocytes), seconded by RBD-rAAV prime/RBD-rAAV boost vaccination (123 SFC/10 6 splenocytes). Both RBD-Pep and RBD-rAAV prime/RBD-rAAV boost vaccinations elicited similar levels of IL-2-secreting cells, which were significantly higher than other vaccinations (P < 0.05) (Fig. 3B) . The CTL responses were further confirmed by detection of IFN-\u03b3-and IL-2-producing CD8 + T lymphocytes using cell surface markers and intracellular cytokine staining followed by flow cytometry analysis (Fig. 4) . The results demonstrated that RBD-rAAV prime/RBD-Pep boost vaccination induced higher level of IFN\u03b3-producing CD8 + T cells (0.51%) than that of RBD-rAAV prime/RBD-rAAV boost (0.28%), while IL-2-producing CD8 + T lymphocytes induced by these two vaccinations were similar. Nevertheless, no or very low levels of IFN-\u03b3-and IL-2-secreting CD8+ T cells were detected in splenocytes from mice with RBD-Pep prime/RBD-Pep boost, and AAV prime/AAV boost vaccinations. These results demonstrated that RBD-rAAV prime/RBD-peptide boost induced stronger CTL response, especially IFN-\u03b3-producing CD8 + T lymphocytes, than other vaccinations.\n\nHumoral immune responses in vaccinated mice were evaluated by detection of SARS-CoVspecific serum IgG titers using ELISA. As shown in Fig. 5A , RBD-rAAV prime/RBD-Pep boost was able to induce high level of SARS-CoV-specific IgG production, in consistent with RBD-rAAV prime/RBD-rAAV boost vaccination. However, RBD-Pep prime/RBD-Pep boost only induced low levels of SARS-CoV-specific antibodies. RBD-rAAV prime/RBD-Pep boost could also induced similar level of neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV as that of the RBD-rAAV prime/RBD-rAAV boost vaccination (Fig. 5B) . In contrast, the titer of neutralizing antibody induced by RBD-Pep prime/RBD-Pep boost vaccination was significantly lower than the above two vaccination strategies (P < 0.05). Similar to serum IgG, no significant neutralizing antibody was detected in mice immunized with AAV prime/AAV boost (Fig. 5A,  5B) . The above results indicated that RBD-rAAV prime with RBD-Pep boost vaccination could induce strong neutralizing antibody response.\n\nProtective efficacies of vaccinations with different protocols were further investigated in mice (4 mice/group) intranasally challenged with SARS-CoV strain GZ50 40 days post-vaccination. Mice were sacrificed 3 days after the challenge, and virus replication in lung tissues was detected by Q-RT-PCR. It was shown in Fig. 6 that SARS-CoV viral load in lung tissues was significantly reduced in mice vaccinated with RBD-Pep. Very low level of viral load was detected in lung tissues of RBD-rAAV prime/RBD-Pep boost group, similar to that in lung tissues of RBD-rAAV prime/RBD-rAAV boost group. Notably, boost doses of RBD-Pep and blank AAV did not provide protection to SARS-CoV challenge, with significantly higher level of viral load (P < 0.05, Fig. 6 ). These results demonstrated that like boost doses of RBD-rAAV, vaccination of RBD-rAAV prime/RBD-peptide boost was able to significantly inhibit SARS-CoV infection.\n\nDevelopment of vaccines is needed for prevention of SARS in case of the disease reemergence. Most reported vaccines against SARS-CoV are based on the full-length S protein or its fragments [19, 20] , but vaccination with MVA-based vaccine containing the full-length S protein may cause enhanced hepatitis in the vaccinated animals [21] . In this regard, fragments of SARS-CoV S protein are more practical and safer for developing vaccines. It has been shown that the S1 domain, especially the RBD region, is the main fragment and major determinant in eliciting neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV [7, 8] . In previous studies, we have also demonstrated that candidate vaccines based on the RBD induced high titers of neutralizing antibodies and prevented subsequent SARS-CoV challenge in vaccinated mice [11, 15] . These suggest that RBD of SARS S protein is an important target in developing safe and effective SARS vaccines [22] [23] [24] .\n\nPrime-boost vaccinations have been used as a strategy for development of SARS vaccines. DNA vaccines boosted with inactivated virus or viral protein fragments have been shown to improve immune responses, including neutralizing antibody response, against SARS-CoV [9, 25, 26] . It was also reported that the immunization by priming with a DNA plasmid encoding SARS-CoV N protein (pcDNA3.1-N) and boosting with an adenoviral vector expressing the same protein (rAd-N) effectively elicited strong SARS-CoV-N-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in vaccinated mice [27] . In this study, we further demonstrated that the immune responses could be enhanced by priming with RBD-rAAV and boosting with RBDpeptides corresponding to the T cell epitopes in the RBD region of SARS-CoV S protein, as compared to those of prime-boost vaccinations with RBD-rAAV or RBD-Pep alone. Our results indicated that RBD-rAAV prime/RBD-Pep boost induced similar Th1 but higher levels of Th2 and CTL responses than vaccinations with RBD-rAAV alone (Fig. 2-4) . It was further shown that RBD-rAAV prime/RBD-peptide boost induced higher neutralizing antibody level than RBD-rAAV vaccination alone, even though the titer of SARS-CoV-specific IgG antibody detected by ELISA was slightly lower than that of RBD-rAAV vaccination (Fig. 5) . Importantly, the RBD-rAAV prime/RBD-peptide boost vaccinated mice were protected from subsequent SARS-CoV challenge (Fig. 6) . These results indicated that RBD-rAAV prime/ RBD-Pep boost vaccination can greatly promote cellular immune responses and neutralizing antibody production in the vaccinated mice, which may play important roles in the suppression of SARS-CoV infection in the challenged mice.\n\nRecombinant AAV (rAAV)-based vaccine has been shown to be a promising vaccine candidate due to its ability in inducing antigen-specific humoral and/or cellular immune responses against other pathogens [28] [29] [30] . However, i.m. vaccination with rAAV, especially repeated doses, might induce a humoral immune response against viral AAV capsid proteins [31] , affecting the immune efficacy of rAAV-based vaccines. In this respect, RBD-rAAV prime with specific peptide boost may prevent the disadvantages induced by repeated i.m. RBD-rAAV vaccinations, while eliciting similar or even higher immune responses and protective effects.\n\nOne key issue for vaccine development is how to provide cross-protection against infection by rapidly mutated viruses, because the mutants may escape from protective effects of the vaccination. Generally, T cell epitopes are much more conserved than neutralizing antibody epitopes. We have compared amino acid sequences of N50 and N60 peptides, which were used for boost vaccination, between 25 human SARS-CoV strains and 5 civet cat SARS-CoV strains deposited in Genebank. N50 is completely conserved in these strains, and only one strain (Sino1-11) shows a single amino acid change in N60. Thus, the strategy of boosting with T cell peptide may plausibly provide cross-protection against quickly mutated viruses.\n\nAnother important issue for vaccine development is whether the vaccination can provide longterm protection. Our previous results showed that majority of the N50-and N60-specific IFN\u03b3-producing T cells were IL-7R\u03b1 + (CD127) and CD62L \u2212 in both CD4 + and CD8 + T cell populations [13] . Our present work also demonstrated that the peptide N50 boost vaccination induced much higher level of CD8 + IFN-\u03b3-producing T cells. It has been found that IL-7R\u03b1 + antigen-specific T cells preferentially develop into long-term (effector) memory T cells [32] and effector memory T cells predominantly persist in peripheral sites, the key portals of entry for pathogens [33] . Thus, vaccination with RBD-rAAV prim/RBD-peptide boost may provide long-term protection against SARS-CoV.\n\nIn conclusion, prime with RBD-rAAV and boost with T cell epitope peptides may be an ideal vaccine strategy to provide effective, cross-and long-term protective effects against SARS-CoV infection. Immunization and detection procedures. Mice of 4 groups were primed with RBD-rAAV, or RBD-peptides (N50 and N60) plus CpG ODN (RBD-Pep), or blank AAV, and boosted with RBD-rAAV, RBD-Pep or AVV, respectively. Ten days post-boost, sera and spleens were collected from the mice in subgroup 1 for detection of IgG and NA titers by ELISA and neutralization assay, respectively, and for detection of Th and CTL responses by ELISPOT and flow cytometry analysis. The mice in subgroup 2 were challenged with SARS-CoV, and the viral loads in lung tissues were determined 3 days later. Detection of SARS-CoV RBD-specific Th responses by ELISPOT.
