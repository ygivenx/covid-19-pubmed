{"title": "Centre for Population Health Sciences", "body": "Lower respiratory infections (LRIs) are the leading infectious cause of death among children younger than 5 years globally, and mortality due to LRIs has declined substantially since the 1990s. 1 Accelerating and main taining these declines is essential to meeting Sustainable Development Goals for under5 childhood mortality and ensuring that children everywhere have the opportunity to live a full, healthy life. Yet, no country has a national pneumonia control strategy and pneu monia attracts a small fraction of international development assistance and research and development funding. 2 Several global initiatives have sought to fill this gap and provide guidance on the most efficient interventions to avert illness and mortality and to champion LRI as a pre ventable cause of death. [2] [3] [4] [5] These programmes have typically categorised risk factors and interventions into groups that are defined by the stage in the morbidity pathway at which they occur, including protection against illness, prevention of infection, and treatment of disease. 4, 5 The decline in under5 LRI mortality has not been universal and has varied between countries. 6 Under standing why it declined faster in some countries than in others provides specific, actionable evidence to further reduce disease burden. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017 (GBD 2017) is a systematic, scientific effort to quantify morbidity and mortality, including LRIs and their risk factors. We used results from GBD 2017 to assess which countries have performed best in reducing under5 LRI mortality and compare countries on the basis of mortality rates, case fatality, and changes in risk factor exposure. This Article identifies countries where the change in under5 LRI mortality has been largest, and uses the expansive set of estimates produced for GBD 2017 to analyse these changes, aiming to assess how and why they have occurred and to provide a roadmap for strategies to accelerate declines in mortality.\n\nDetailed methods on GBD and on LRI estimation in GBD have been previously published. 1, [6] [7] [8] [9] We describe these methods briefly. There were no substantial modelling changes between GBD 2016 and GBD 2017. LRIs are defined as diseases of the lower airways including pneumonia and bronchiolitis. Uncertainty in the LRI estimates are maintained through the modelling process using draws and is reflected as 2\u00b75th and 97\u00b75th percentiles of the posterior distribution. In compliance with the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting, data and code for GBD 2017 are publicly available. There are four main components of the analysis that we share here: LRI mortality estimation; LRI morbidity estimation; estimation of LRI mortality attributable to the inde pendent effects of risk factors; and an analysis of trends in LRI mortality.\n\nMost causes of death in GBD 2017, including LRI, are modelled with the Cause of Death Ensemble model tool. 1, 10 This statistical tool is designed to create a wide \n\nEvidence before this study Lower respiratory infections (LRIs) haven previously been identified as the leading infectious cause of death among children younger than 5 years. Several prominent global burden estimation groups, the WHO Maternal and Child Epidemiology Estimation group, and the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) have iteratively quantified the morbidity and mortality associated with LRIs. Based on these findings, several initiatives have sought to give guidance about effective ways to reduce health loss due to LRIs, including the Global Action Plan for Pneumonia and Diarrhoea, The Missing Piece, and a 2013 Lancet Series about effective ways to reduce child mortality. We have previously published estimates of LRI mortality from GBD 2015 and 2016 and in those Articles, have looked at risks and interventions. We conducted a search in PubMed on April 30, 2019, using the search terms \"(\"lower respiratory infection\" OR pneumonia) AND mortality AND global AND risk AND trend*)\". After removing publications using GBD results, we found 49 articles, many of which reported on single risk factors or countries. These manuscripts have been primarily cross-sectional and, to our knowledge, no other study has attempted to evaluate changes in LRI disease burden over time due to demographic changes and changes in risk factor exposure.\n\nHere we report findings from GBD 2017, which builds on previous iterations of GBD with additional data and modelling improvements. We use estimates for 13 risk factors or interventions for LRI morbidity or mortality, produced for GBD, to evaluate changes in LRI mortality among children younger than 5 years. We use a conceptual framework to group these risk factors into categories of those that primarily prevent initial LRI episodes (such as the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine) and those that primarily protect children with LRIs from dying (such as antibiotic therapy). A major component of GBD is producing internally consistent and externally comparable estimates for all locations and over time, which allows us to identify countries where the incidence or mortality has changed most rapidly and to evaluate the risk factors or interventions are most associated with these changes. We provide cross-sectional and longitudinal estimates of the reasons for which children are dying from LRIs, how this varies, and where specific interventions might have the greatest impact.\n\nThe incidence and mortality due to LRIs among HIV-negative children younger than 5 years has declined in many parts of the world, particularly because of decreased exposure to household air pollution, reductions in prevalence of childhood wasting, and increased vaccine coverage. However, there is variation by country, suggesting that there is no single intervention that will substantially reduce LRI mortality in every country. Individual countries or regions must consider their specific context to identify strategies to reduce LRI disease burden. Our results, while being mindful of the limitations of modelled estimates, can help provide the evidence needed to develop plans to give children everywhere a chance at a life free from LRIs.\n\nvariety of models using a covariate selection algorithm and then to weight these models on the basis of their out ofsample predictive validity. We combined these models into an ensemble that predicts LRI mortality by age, sex, year, and location from 1980 to 2017. The model for LRI used vital registration data, demographic surveillance data, and verbal autopsy data. Covariates included childhood growth failure, ambient and household air pollution, nutritional deficiency, SocioDemographic Index (SDI), and maternal education, among others (appendix pp 6). Causes of death in the GBD study are mutually exclusive and each death has one cause. Importantly, any LRI death among people with HIV is considered to have HIV as the underlying cause of death, therefore our results represent LRI mortality among HIV negative children younger than 5 years (appendix p 2).\n\nThe incidence and prevalence of LRI were modelled using DisModMR 2.1 (DisMod), a Bayesian meta regression tool. 7 One of the primary advantages of DisMod is that it enforces consistency between incidence, prevalence, recovery, and mortality by solving a series of ordinary differential equations. Input data for this model are from populationrepresentative surveys, healthcare utilisation records, and scientific literature. We used two covariates to help predict in areas with little or no data coverage: a composite indicator of the cumulative risk exposure for LRI, called the summary exposure variable and developed for GBD, and the SDI (appendix pp 9, 10).\n\nWe applied the results of the aforementioned models to spatiotemporal patterns. We compared estimates of LRI mortality and incidence in 1990 and 2017. To group countries into categories of similar burden, we identified country groupings on the basis of the burden in 1990. We split countries into four groups on the basis of the median mortality rate and incidence in 1990 and defined them as: high mortality and high incidence, high mortality and low incidence, low mortality and high incidence, and low mortality and low incidence.\n\nThe case fatality ratio is defined as the ratio of number of deaths to number of incident cases. We fit a lognormal regression using SDI to predict the expected change in LRI case fatality ratio. This was considered the baseline change in case fatality ratio that is explained by SDI.\n\nRisk factors in GBD 2017 are causally related to LRI incidence or mortality. 8 In this study, we analysed 13 of the risk factors for LRI identified in GBD 2017 (ambient air pollution, household air pollution, low Haemophilus influenzae type b [Hib] vaccine coverage, low pneu mococcal conjugate vaccine [PCV] coverage, no handwashing, secondhand smoking, zinc deficiency, breastfeeding, low antibiotic coverage, low birthweight and short gestation, stunting, underweight, and wasting; appendix pp [13] [14] [15] . The estimation strategy for risk factors involved a counterfactual approach that quantifies the level of exposure to the risk factor in a population and the relative risk of LRI given exposure. Typically, the exposure in a population is modelled on the basis of surveys and scientific literature and the risk of LRI is derived from published metaanalyses. Childhood growth failure risks were estimated as a continuous exposure of the height or weight Z scores. Likewise, air pollution was considered a continuous exposure of the amount of fine particulate matter smaller than 2\u00b75 \u03bcm in diameter. Other risk factors, such as low vaccine coverage, are modelled when the exposure is a population prevalence of being exposed to that risk factor (eg, the population prevalence of being unvaccinated for low vaccine coverage). Descriptions of the riskfactor exposure models and relative risks are provided in the appendix (pp 13-66). Risk factors in GBD are part of a comparative risk assessment framework and are modelled independently. 8 Therefore, in our study, the burden associated with each risk factor can be considered as the LRI mortality that could be averted if exposure to that risk factor was eliminated. Since they were modelled independently, our analysis does not quantify the potential impact of combined interventions and combining riskfactor burden by summing risk factors is not appropriate and could lead to greater attribution than disease burden.\n\nTo assess the efficiency of targeted interventions for each risk factor among children younger than 5 years, we took advantage of the counterfactual definition of riskfactor burden such that the LRI mortality rate attributable to each risk factor was equivalent to the reduction expected given complete absence of the risk factor. 8 For example, for vaccines, the risk exposure was defined as no vaccination, so the counterfactual was full vaccine coverage.\n\nWe classified risk factors into two categories based on their biological mechanism of risk and modelled after a conceptualisation proposed by the Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Pneumonia and Diarrhoea. 3 Conceptually, prevention risks are those that increase the probability of developing a LRI and include ambient air pollution, household air pollution, low Hib vaccine coverage, low PCV coverage, no access to a handwashing station with soap and water, secondhand smoke exposure, and zinc deficiency (appendix p 12). Protection risks are those that increase the probability of dying once a child developed an LRI and include suboptimal breastfeeding, low antibiotic coverage, low birthweight and short gestation, childhood stunting, childhood underweight, and child hood wasting (appendix p 13-15). We decomposed the effect of the change in exposure to each risk factor on See Online for appendix For input data see https:// vizhub.healthdata.org/epi/ For data used in the model for LRI see http://ghdx. healthdata.org/gbd-2017 and https://vizhub.healthdata.org/ cod/ the LRI mortality rate between 1990 and 2017, accounting for the independent effects of population growth, population ageing, and other drivers of LRI mortality. This process has been described in detail elsewhere. 6, 8 Role of the funding source\n\nThe funder of the study played no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. All collaborators had full access to all the data in the study and the corresponding author \n\nGlobally, LRIs were the leading infectious cause of death among children younger than 5 years in 2017 (808 920 deaths, 95% uncertainty interval [UI] 747 286-873 591; table), responsible for 15\u00b70% (14\u00b70-16\u00b70) of all under5 deaths. There was no substantial difference in the under5 LRI mortality rate between boys (118\u00b72 deaths, 108\u00b72-129\u00b76, per 100 000 boys) and girls (119\u00b75 deaths, 109\u00b76-129\u00b76, per 100 000 girls; data are available on GBDCompare). Since 1990, there has been a substantial decrease in the number of deaths (65\u00b74% decrease, 61\u00b75-68\u00b75; from 2 337 538 deaths to 808 920 deaths), the mortality rate (67\u00b72% decrease, 63\u00b76-70\u00b72; from 362\u00b77 deaths, 330\u00b71-392\u00b70, per 100 000 children to 118\u00b79 deaths, 109\u00b78-128\u00b73, per 100 000 children; table), and the percent of under5 deaths that were due to LRIs (24\u00b76% decrease, 17\u00b72-30\u00b74; from 19\u00b79%, 18\u00b71-21\u00b74, to 15\u00b70%, 14\u00b70-16\u00b70) among children younger than 5 years.\n\nMost \n\nEstimates for every country are available in the appendix (pp 67-92). UI=uncertainty interval.\n\nSlovenia (<0\u00b71%, <0\u00b71 to <0\u00b71), whereas the highest occurred in Nigeria (5\u00b78%, 5\u00b74 to 6\u00b70) and Tajikistan (4\u00b72%, 4\u00b72 to 4\u00b73; figure 3; appendix pp 67-92). In 2017, if all countries with a case fatality ratio exceeding the global average had been reduced to the global average, then 291 611 deaths would be averted. Some countries in central Asia (eg, Azerbaijan, Mongolia, and Tajikistan) and in western subSaharan Africa (eg, Guinea, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone) had case fatality ratios much higher than expected on the basis of SDI alone (figure 3). If these countries had experienced case fatality ratios corresponding with the average relationship between case fatality ratio and SDI, an additional 326 900 deaths, including 133 600 in Nigeria, could possibly have been averted in 2017.\n\nOverall, 93\u00b74% (95% UI 90\u00b73 to 95\u00b77) of under5 LRI mortality could be attributed to risk factors and interventions modelled by GBD in 2017 ( PCV coverage, and 9\u00b76% (<0\u00b71 to 20\u00b76) due to low Hib vaccine coverage (data available on GBDCompare).\n\nAt the global level, changes to all risk factors for LRI mortality accounted for a 12\u00b72% decrease (95% UI 11\u00b76-13\u00b71) between 1990 and 2017 (figure 4; appendix pp 93-111). Globally, increased Hib vaccine coverage (11\u00b74%, 0\u00b70-24\u00b75) and PCV coverage (6\u00b73%, 6\u00b71-6\u00b73) were responsible for large decreases in LRI mortality among children younger than 5 years between 1990 and 2017 (figure 4; appendix pp 93-111). This effect was evident also in all subgroups of countries classified according to their mortality and incidence rates in 1990. Although decreased exposure to household air pollution reduced LRI mortality by 8\u00b74% (6\u00b78-9\u00b72), increased exposure to ambient air pollution increased mortality by 4\u00b71% (2\u00b77-6\u00b72; figure 4 ).\n\nIn 1990, both the mortality and incidence rates were higher than the corresponding countrygroup mean values in 68 countries, which were categorised as high mortality and high incidence (upper right quadrant of figure 1A ; figure 4A ). From 1990 to 2017, the under5 LRI mortality rate declined by a greater amount than the global median in 50 (74%) of these 68 countries and the LRI mortality rate decreased by a mean of 398\u00b70 deaths (95% UI 100\u00b77-857\u00b78) per 100 000 children in these countries (figures 1, 4A). These countries tended to have large decreases in LRI mortality attributable to changes in childhood growth failure indicators, including a mean 12\u00b77% (2\u00b73-31\u00b72) reduction due to childhood wasting, 5\u00b75% (1\u00b75-9\u00b75) reduction due to childhood stunting, and 5\u00b71% (1\u00b76-10\u00b72) reduction due to childhood underweight ( figure 4A ). Among the countries with the -30 000 to <-10 000 -10 000 to <-8000 -8000 to <-6000 -6000 to <-4 000 -4000 to <-2000 -2000 to <0 0 to <2500 2500 to 10 000 figure 4A ; appendix pp 93-111). In 29 countries, the mortality rate was higher than the global median but the incidence was lower than the global median in 1990. We classified these countries as having high mortality and low incidence (upper left quadrant of figure 1; figure 4B ). This group of countries had a mean decline in LRI mortality rate of 245\u00b70 deaths (44\u00b77-514\u00b76) per 100 000 children during 1990-2017. Countries in this group tended to have large reductions in LRI mortality attributable to changes in household air pollution (mean decrease 13\u00b71% [5\u00b76-21\u00b75]), including a 24\u00b76% (17\u00b79-30\u00b76) decline in Swaziland (eSwatini). Increased Hib vaccine coverage also contributed to a substantial reduction in LRI mortality in this group of countries (16\u00b70% decrease [10\u00b70-23\u00b78]). This group also had small declines in LRI mortality attributable to improved breastfeeding (mean 1\u00b70% [0\u00b70-2\u00b72]) and zinc deficiency (mean 0\u00b76% [0\u00b72-2\u00b73]). The LRI mortality rate decreased by 662\u00b72 deaths (554\u00b77-755\u00b76) per 100 000 children in Nigeria, where the largest attributable changes were due to household air pollution (18\u00b73% decrease [11\u00b79-22\u00b79]), childhood wasting (9\u00b79% decrease [8\u00b75-11\u00b71]), and childhood stunting (6\u00b74% decrease [1\u00b74-13\u00b75]; figure 4B ; appendix pp 93-111).\n\nIn 29 countries, the mortality rate was lower than the global median in 1990 but the incidence was higher than the global median. We classified these countries as having low mortality and high incidence (lower right quadrant of figure 1; figure 4C ). The LRI mortality rate decreased by 45\u00b79 deaths (95% UI 7\u00b78-90\u00b74) per 100 000 children in these countries and the absolute change in the LRI mortality rate was in the 3rd quintile for 18 (62%) of 29 countries. Relative to other groups, this group of countries had greater reductions attributable to behavioural risk factors such as no handwashing (1\u00b70% mean decline [0\u00b72-3\u00b70]), secondhand smoke exposure (2\u00b72% mean decline [0\u00b73-3\u00b77]), and childhood wasting (10\u00b73% mean decline [2\u00b73-22\u00b72]). Although vaccine coverage reduced LRI mortality in this country group, this reduction was similar to the allcountry mean for Hib vaccine coverage (13\u00b79% mean reduction [5\u00b72-22\u00b78]) and slower than the allcountry mean for PCV coverage (9\u00b70% mean reduction [6\u00b74-24\u00b76]). By contrast, these countries had mean increases in LRI mortality attributable to low antibiotic coverage (2\u00b76% median increase [1\u00b71-4\u00b78]) and low birthweight and short gestation (2\u00b76% median increase [0\u00b71-5\u00b77]). Many of these countries did not introduce the PCV, which was responsible for an increase in LRI mortality in ten countries (figure 4C), with Jordan (11\u00b70% increase [6\u00b72-15\u00b79]) and Ukraine (6\u00b77% increase [3\u00b78-9\u00b78]) having the largest increase in mortality rate due to low PCV coverage (appendix pp 93-111).\n\nIn 69 countries, both mortality and incidence were lower than the global median in 1990. We classified these countries as having low mortality and low incidence (lower left quadrant of figure 1; figure 4D ). The mean \n\nPrevention risk factors (%) Protection risk factors (%) A Quintile 5th quintile 4th quintile 3rd quintile 2nd quintile 1st quintile (Figure 4 continues on the next page) -1\u00b77\n\ndecline in LRI mortality rate in these countries was 13\u00b77 deaths (95% UI 1\u00b77 to 39\u00b79) per 100 000 children.\n\nMany of these countries reduced exposure to ambient air pollution (the greatest reduction was a 3\u00b75% decline, 2\u00b75 to 3\u00b78, in the Czech Republic). The mean decline due to secondhand smoke exposure was 2\u00b72% (-0\u00b73 to 5\u00b79) and was greatest in Greece (8\u00b78% reduction, 7\u00b73 to 10\u00b79) and Iceland (7\u00b75% reduction, 5\u00b76 to 9\u00b74; figure 4D ). Countries in this group generally had decreases in LRI mortality attributable to greater vaccine coverage but these changes were similar to the decrease across all countries (appendix pp 93-111).\n\nto changes in risk factor exposure by country, 1990-2017 Countries are grouped by their mortality and incidence (higher or lower than the global median in 1990, as identified by the quandrants in figure 1A ) and are ordered within each group from slowest absolute change in under-5 LRI mortality rate per 1000 children between 1990 and 2017. Colors indicate the quintile for the absolute change in each risk factor attributable fraction among all countries. Country groupings are: (A) high mortality, high incidence (n=68); (B) high mortality, low incidence (n=29); (C) low mortality, high incidence (n=29); and (D) low mortality, low incidence (n=69). \n\nAt the global level, LRI mortality declined substantially among children younger than 5 years between 1990 and 2017. Despite these declines, such progress has not occurred equally across countries, and LRIs remained the leading infectious cause of death among children younger than 5 years in 2017. In most locations, LRI incidence declined more slowly than mortality, suggesting that improvements in protecting against death are probably outpacing improvements in reducing the underlying risk of infection. Although SDI is strongly associated with under5 LRI mortality, changes in SDI were not strongly associated with changes in mortality rates between 1990 and 2017. At the global level, 93\u00b74% of under5 LRI deaths were attributable to a risk factor. Among risk factors estimated in GBD 2017, we have conceptualised the change in under5 LRI burden into two components, the changes in risks that predispose children to disease (prevention risk factors) and those that increase the risk of mortality given disease (protection risk factors). These categories are likely to partly overlap. For example, childhood growth failure, via immunological mechanisms, might make children both more likely to get sick and die from an LRI. Such a distinction is broad but provides a conceptual framework with which to assess the relationship between trends in risk factor exposure, mortality, incidence, and case fatality. One of the main findings from our study is that the drivers of change in LRI mortality are not universal and might be highly specific to each location and that strategies to reduce health loss due to LRI must be tailored to a given setting. For example, the three countries with the greatest absolute decline in LRI mortality rate were Niger (1019\u00b73 fewer deaths per 100 000 children), Laos (944\u00b74 fewer deaths per 100 000 children) and Afghanistan (919\u00b70 fewer deaths per 100 000 children). The Hib and pneumococcal vaccines were responsible for the largest percent change in Niger, whereas changes in childhood wasting explained more than 20% of the decline in Laos and Afghanistan, and lower exposure to household air pollution in Afghanistan decreased LRI mortality rate by 19\u00b73%. By contrast, the two countries that observed the largest relative decline in LRI mortality between 1990 and 2017, China and Turkey, had relatively small changes attributable to changes in risk factors. Under5 LRI mortality in China decreased by 91\u00b72% between 1990 and 2017, whereas the mortality rate decreased by 26\u00b72% because of changes in risk factor exposure. This suggests that other factors might explain the change in some countries.\n\nOther studies have identified economic development, healthcare reform to provide governmentsponsored health care in rural areas, 11, 12 improved detection of pneumonia following the severe acute respiratory syndrome and influenza virus subtype H1N1 pandemics, and programmes to reduce household air pollution from solid fuels as the main drivers of reduction in LRI mortality in China. 13 The decline in LRI mortality in China might also be related to a socalled nutritional transitionsimilar to a transition previously observed in the USA and other highincome countries, but occurring at lower gross national product 14 -and might be explained by agricultural policies (including sub sidisation and subsequent increase in soya bean oil and soya consumption), 15 urbanisation, 16 liberalisation of food production, 15 and rapid economic development (exceeding 8% annually) in China during this time. 17 This study did not include covariates that would specifically capture changes in infrastructure or food production but such changes might be reflected in the rapid increase in SDI observed in China between 1990 and 2017, and these trends deserve further investigation. Interventions and structural policies that aim to improve childhood nutrition can play a substantial role in protecting children from dying because of infectious diseases, including LRIs. 5 China and Turkey have some of the fastest improvements in the Healthcare Access and Quality Index, a composite metric of amenable mortality. 18 This improvement in preventing amenable causes of death suggests that the healthcare systems in these countries have improved and are likely to have contributed to the rapid declines in LRI mortality. Access to care, adherence to treatment protocols, maternal education, appropriate technology, and adequate healthcare staffing have all been identified as predictors of under5 LRI survival 5 that were not quantified in this study and might be components of a comprehensive LRI treatment strategy.\n\nOur study found that low antibiotic use for LRIs was responsible for an increase in LRI mortality, particularly among countries with high mortality in 1990. An analysis of appropriate antibiotic therapy for child hood pneumonia determined that the availability and acces sibility of WHOrecommended antibiotics is not equitable in some locations with substantial variation within countries. 19 Antibiotic use for symptoms of pneumonia varied greatly among lowincome and middleincome countries, 20 and was estimated at just 18\u00b78% globally, in 2017, in this study. A cohort study consisting of eight sites and a mixture of urban and rural locations found that 61% of children aged 0-2 years with acute LRI received antibiotics, including 69% in rural Tanzania and 86% in urban Bangladesh. 21 Community case management of acute respiratory infections could reduce pneumoniarelated mortality by 32%, according to a systematic review, 22 and effective treatments such as oxygen therapy, rehydration, and antibiotics can dramatically reduce LRI mortality.\n\nAppropriate care for LRIs might also depend on the availability and utilisation of health care. Primary health care in some lowincome and middleincome countries has experienced challenges in funding, with general underuse of facilities and neglected human resources. Nigeria had the highest case fatality ratio globally in 2017 (5\u00b77%, 95% UI 5\u00b74-6\u00b70) but had average coverage of antibiotics, suggesting other factors might be driving the high rate. Nigeria is a country of complex demographic, geographic, and cultural characteristics with substantial variation in health and healthcare utilisation and performance indicators. 23 It has the highest population of any country in Africa and by far the most deaths due to LRI among children younger than 5 years. Yet, a review of published literature on child health interventions found only 18 papers from Nigeria. 24 Building evidence from highburden countries should be a priority and is essential to a complete understanding of health loss due to LRI. One qualitative study 25 revealed demandside barriers to healthcare utilisation in Nigeria, suggesting that costs, physical distance, cultural considerations, and knowledge of symptoms and warning signs might all play a role in delayed careseeking and could explain behaviours in other locations. In one study 26 of six countries in sub Saharan Africa, only 30% of care givers recognised fast breathing or difficulty in breathing as a symptom of LRI. Among several countries in western subSaharan Africa, the proportion of care givers who reported seeking treatment for symptoms of pneumonia ranged from 27\u00b74% in Chad to 73\u00b72% in Sierra Leone and was 41\u00b79% in Nigeria. 26 Appropriate care and treatment to protect against LRI mortality are important but the two risk factors responsible for the largest reduction in LRI mortality at the global level and for the largest prevention of incident episodes of LRI are Hib vaccine coverage and household air pollution. Vaccines have been an important part of LRI prevention in many countries. In 2011, 2% of US$30\u00b76 billion in international assistance for health spending was spent on pneumonia, and about 82% of that was through Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, suggesting that nearly all pneumonia funding was for vaccines. 27 A different analysis found that between 2000 and 2015, pneumonia received approximately $3 billion in funding for research and development, compared with more than $38 billion that went towards HIV/AIDS research during the same time. 28 Of that $3 billion, about $839 million went to treatment, another $164 million to diagnostics, and $858 million went to vaccines. 28 Globally, Hib and pneumococcal vaccines were responsible for an estimated 11\u00b74% (Hib) and 6\u00b73% (PCV) decrease in LRI mortality. Although nearly every country has introduced the Hib vaccine in their immunisation programmes, several highburden countries such as Nigeria, Chad, and Somalia have not introduced the pneumococcal vaccine. Studies have shown substantial reductions in hospital admissions for pneumonia, invasive Hib, and pneumococcal pneumonia following vaccine introduction. [29] [30] [31] [32] Although more countries might introduce PCV with Gavi support, there is uncertainty regarding the sustainability of these vaccines among countries that approach graduation from Gavi. 33 The continued and expanded use of these vaccines have substantial impacts on under5 LRI mortality and should be prioritised as part of routine immunisation programmes to prevent these deaths.\n\nTwo other risk factors that are associated with preventing incident cases of LRI had opposite trends in burden attribution. Between 1990 and 2017, LRI mortality decreased by 8\u00b74% globally due to reductions in household air pollution but increased by 4\u00b71% due to ambient air pollution. A pair of systematic reviews and metaanalyses found that exposure to household air pollution from solid fuel use increased the risk of pneumonia among children younger than 5 years. 34, 35 A pair of randomised controlled trials found little statistical evidence of a reduction in pneumonia incidence with provision of chimneys 36 or cleaner burning cookstoves, 37 and several more studies investigating household air pollution and childhood pneumonia are in progress. 38, 39 This suggests that the provision of chimneys or cleaner burning practices does not result in a sufficient reduction of air pollution to translate into a reduction in health effects. This finding is consistent with the analysis and recommendations by the WHO guidelines. Rapid urbanisation in many countries and a shift from conventional heating sources, such as coal and wood, to natural gas have probably contributed to reduced exposure to household air pollution. 40 Reduced exposure to household air pollution was strongly associated with decreased incidence and mortality, particularly in highburden countries in our study. We have previously described the interplay between develop ment and ambient air pollution that is occurring in many countries that are rapidly urbanising and growing economically. 6 Preventing LRI cases and deaths should be a part of any policy conversation regarding the burning of fossil fuels, and focusing on health effects of carbonbased energy might be a powerful rhetorical tool in developing policy to reduce air pollution. [41] [42] [43] There are several limitations in this study. We have previously described some of the data gaps associated with LRI mortality modelling, specifically among countries with the highest estimated LRI burden. 6 All our estimates are reported with uncertainty intervals and these intervals are larger in areas where we have fewer data. We attempt to improve our models by using patterns from locations where we do have data and by the relationship between LRI mortality and covariates. Many of the covariates used in the mortality modelling are also part of the risk factor attribution. Risk factors in GBD are typically a combination of populationlevel exposure and the relative risk of an outcome. The exposure to each risk factor is a covariate in our model. This analysis is strengthened by our ability to use risk factors to predict time trends in LRI mortality. Yet, the risk factor exposure used at multiple points in this analysis are also modelled values, dependent on data availability. Although we have quantified several interventions for LRI healthloss and antibiotic use, we do not explicitly account for healthcare For WHO guidelines on indoor air quality see https://www.who. int/airpollution/guidelines/ household-fuel-combustion/ IAQ_HHFC_guidelines.pdf seeking behaviours, primary healthcare availability, and specific recommended diagnostics or treatments for LRI. Understanding patterns in diagnostics and the use of pulse oximetry, chest xrays, and oxygen therapy might reveal additional information about the drivers in LRI mortality trends. We do not have a modelled covariate for influenza vaccine coverage. Additionally, our model quantifies LRI deaths in HIVnegative people only because any deaths due to select infectious diseases, including LRI, among people with HIV, are classified as HIV deaths in the International Classification of Diseases; these deaths are captured in the overall HIV related mortality estimation in GBD. 1 To date, we have not separately quantified LRI deaths in HIVinfected people. As GBD is an iterative endeavour, we can examine this in our future work. The global reduction in under5 LRI mortality from 1990 to 2017 should be viewed as simultaneously a major public health achievement and as a call for renewed efforts to continue to reduce the burden of disease. Declines in LRI burden over time have been highly specific by location and are not fully explained by improvements in sociodemographic status alone. These results illustrate the contribution of improvements in air pollution, Hib and PCV vaccine coverage, child nutrition, and effective treatment to reducing disease and death due to LRI. Quantitative estimates of LRI incidence, mortality, and risk factor exposure can serve as a tool to sustain the progress made since 1990 and to design targeted strategies for countries where high LRI burden remains."}
