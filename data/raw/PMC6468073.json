{"title": "Influenza B associated paediatric acute respiratory infection hospitalization in central vietnam", "body": "Influenza viruses belong to the family Orthomyxoviridae, which possess a segmented negative\u2010stranded RNA genome.1, 2 Among three influenza types, namely, type\u2010 A, B and C, influenza A and B often cause seasonal acute respiratory infections (ARI) epidemics and impose a high socioeconomic burden, particularly among children and the elderly population.3, 4 In temperate climate regions, peaks of influenza\u2010associated ARIs may appear in early autumn through winter,5 whereas year\u2010round circulation with no apparent seasonal trend may be seen in tropical climate regions.6, 7, 8, 9\n\n\nInfluenza B differs from type\u2010 A in terms of genetic composition and its ability to infect only humans and seals.10, 11 Two surface glycoproteins, Haemagglutinin (HA) and Neuraminidase (NA), play pivotal roles during pathogenesis.12 Unlike influenza A, influenza B does not possess multiple subtypes. Instead, influenza B obtains its genetic variation mainly through genetic drift, including nucleotide substitutions, insertions, and deletions, which explains the slower molecular evolutionary rate and smaller capacity to cause seasonal ARI outbreaks compared to influenza A.13, 14 Genetic reassortment of influenza B genetic components was previously documented15; however, its frequency is not as high as that of influenza A due to its limited animal reservoir.\n\nDespite the clinical importance of influenza B among ARI cases, majority of previous literature focused on influenza A. Therefore, clinical and molecular epidemiological information on influenza B is relatively limited worldwide.\n\nThe first influenza B strain B/Lee/40 was isolated in 1940.16 In the 1970s, influenza B diverged into two genetically and antigenically distinct lineages, Victoria\u2010like (B/Victoria/2/87) and Yamagata\u2010like (B/Yamagata/16/88) lineages.17, 18 Since then, the two lineages have been co\u2010circulating in many regions of the world.19 Previous studies from Cambodia, China, India, and Taiwan have reported the increase of influenza B\u2010associated ARI cases in the following seasons after the emergence of the pandemic A/H1N1pdm09 strain.4, 17, 18, 20, 21 Furthermore, some studies presented the circulation of Victoria lineage as a dominant type in the post\u2010A/H1N1pdm09 period,17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23 whereas others showed co\u2010circulation of both lineages.3, 4 Regardless of a few epidemiological studies on influenza B lineage\u2010specific clinical presentation,21, 23 the clinical aspect of two genetically distinct lineages has not been clearly understood up to date.\n\nIn this study, we investigated the incidence and clinical\u2010epidemiological characteristics of paediatric hospitalized influenza B ARI cases in Vietnam.\n\nPopulation\u2010based prospective paediatric ARI surveillance in Khanh Hoa province, Nha Trang, Vietnam was established in February 2007.24 All children from 16 communes admitted to the paediatric ward of Khanh Hoa General Hospital (KHGH), which is the only hospital in the region, due to ARI symptoms (cough and/or difficulty breathing) from February 2007 to June 2013 were enrolled in the current study. Nha Trang city in south central region of Vietnam has a hot and dry season or tropical climate with a short rainy or wet season from September to December. The detailed characterization of the target population was described in the previous study.24 Written informed consent from the parents or guardians of all the enrolled ARI children were obtained. Nasopharyngeal (NP) swab, clinical\u2010epidemiological information, chest radiograph, and laboratory test data were collected from each enrollee. Currently, vaccination against influenza type A and B is not included in the nationwide immunization program in Vietnam. Its availability in our study site is limited and not commonly used among children.\n\nLower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) was defined based on the modified World Health Organization (WHO) Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses (IMCI) algorithms.25 The presence of tachypnea (respiratory rate >60/min for children \u22661 month, >50/min for 2\u201011 months and >40/min for 12\u201059 months of age) was categorized as mild LRTIs. Furthermore, children with a general danger sign (the situation in which children were either unable to drink, under convulsion, or lethargy), chest\u2010wall indrawing, or stridor were categorized as severe LRTIs. Radiologically\u2010confirmed pneumonia was defined as the presence of either substantial alveolar consolidation or pleural effusion in chest X\u2010ray result following the standardized interpretation method established by WHO Vaccine Trial Investigators Group.26 ARI cases with abnormal shadow but neither substantial alveolar consolidation nor pleural effusion were categorized into chest X\u2010ray abnormality or other lower respiratory infections.26\n\n\nViral nucleic acids were extracted from ARI patient's NP swabs using QIA Viral RNA Minikit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA, USA) following the company's instructions. Four multiplex Reverse Transcriptase (RT)\u2010PCR assays were performed for screening 13 respiratory viruses, including RSV, influenza A and B, Human Metapneumovirus, Parainfluenza virus 1\u20104, Human Coronavirus (229E and OC43), Adenovirus, and Bocavirus as previously described.24 For the current study, the presence of bacterial pathogens in the clinical samples was not tested.\n\nInfluenza B\u2010confirmed ARI samples were genotyped by Haemagglutinin (HA) gene sequencing using BigDye Terminator ver.3.1 cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystem, Foster City, CA, USA) with 3730 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystem, Foster City, CA, USA). Influenza B reference sequences including WHO recommended vaccine strains for northern hemisphere from 2007 to 2014 (https://www.who.int/influenza/vaccines/virus/recommendations/en/) were obtained from GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) and EpiFlu database within Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID)(http://platform.gisaid.org) and included in phylogenetic analysis as previously described.17, 23, 27 These reference strains were used in order to further classify lineage into groups based on Worldwide Influenza Centre (WIC) (https://www.crick.ac.uk/partnerships/worldwide-influenza-centre). Multiple nucleotide sequences of HA gene were aligned and edited with ClustalW algorism implemented within BioEdit ver.7.2.0. KAKUSAN4 (http://www.fifthdimension.jp/products/kakusan/) was used for the selection of best\u2010fit nucleotide substitution model.28 Phylogenetic analyses were performed with Maximum\u2010Likelihood (ML) method under HKY\u201085 substitution model (gamma\u2010distribution) with bootstrap value of 1000 replicates using MEGA ver.6.0.6.29\n\n\nEither two\u2010tailed Pearson's chi\u2010squared or Fisher's exact test was performed to compare the proportions between independent groups. For continuous variables, either Mann\u2013Whitney U test or Kruskal\u2013Wallis test were utilized to compare the median values between independent groups. In the multivariate analysis, Generalized Linear Model with log\u2010binomial regression was applied to estimate adjusted Relative Risk (Adj RR) and 95% Confidence Interval (CI). To control demographic confounding variables in the multivariate regression analysis, both forward\u2010selection step and biologically plausible approaches were taken into account. For the estimation of potential impact of A/H1N1pdm09 emergence on influenza B\u2010associated ARI hospitalization incidence among Vietnamese children, we utilized the Generalized Linear Model (GLM) with Poisson distribution.30 The following equation was used as a standard regression model:Yt\u223cPoisson\u03bct\nlog(\u03bct)=\u03b20+\u03b21T+\u03b22xt+f(t)\n\nY\nt: the number of influenza B\u2010associated ARI hospitalization cases at time (t)\nT: the time (in month\u2010interval) elapsed since the beginning of paediatric ARI surveillance in central Vietnam (February, 2007)\nX\nt: the variable for \u201cpre\u2010A/H1N1pdm09\u201d (February 2007\u2010March 2010)(coded as 0) and \u201cPost\u2010A/H1N1pdm09\u201d (April 2010\u2010June 2013)(coded as 1)\n\n\nwhere the function of f (t) adjusts for short\u2010term seasonal trend using the Fourier term (pairs of sine\u2010cosine functions) with four harmonic terms (2 sine\u2010cosine pairs). The values of Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) in the models with different numbers of harmonic terms [up to 12 (6 sine\u2010cosine pairs)] were compared in order to determine the best\u2010fit harmonic terms in the final model.31 The \u201cPost\u2010A/H1N1pdm09\u201d was defined as (April 2010\u2010June 2013), based on the AIC comparison in 12 different models (1 month interval), in which \u201cPost\u2010A/H1N1pdm09\u201d was defined at different time points, starting from January 2010 to December 2010. All the statistical analyses were performed using STATA ver.14.1 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA). P\u2010values less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.\n\nThis study was approved by the institutional ethical review boards of the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology (NIHE), Hanoi, Vietnam (Approved Number: IRB\u2010VN01057), and the Institute of Tropical Medicine, Nagasaki University, Japan (Approved Number: 09031837). The study was conducted in accordance with the approved guidelines.\n\nDuring the investigation period, February 2007 through June 2013, a total of 4429 paediatric ARI hospitalization cases were enrolled (Table 1), among which 496 were influenza A (single infection), and 129 were influenza B (single infection). Four cases were infected with both influenza A and B. Yearly incidences of paediatric ARI hospitalizations, LRTIs, and overall influenza\u2010associated ARI hospitalizations (both influenza A and B inclusive) were summarized in Table 1. The age\u2010stratified prevalence of influenza A and B among paediatric ARI hospitalizations were summarized in Table S1.\n\nThe incidence of influenza A and B\u2010associated paediatric ARI hospitalization were highest among children younger than 2 years (Table 1). During the first three years of the study period (2007\u20102009), the incidence of influenza B ARI hospitalization among children younger than two were relatively low, ranging from 18.2 to 164 per 100 000 population compared to influenza A, which was 636 to 1491 per 100 000. However, the incidence of influenza B ARI hospitalization among children younger than two increased noticeably in the post\u2010A/H1N1pdm09 period, particularly in 2010 [255 (95% CI: 139\u2010427)] and 2012 [527 (95% CI: 353\u2010756)]. The results of Generalized Linear Model (GLM) confirmed that there was statistical evidence of an increase in influenza B\u2010associated paediatric ARI hospitalization in \u201cPost\u2010A/H1N1pdm09\u201d (April 2010\u2010June 2013) when compared to \u201cPre\u2010A/H1N1pdm09\u201d (February 2007\u2010March 2010) [Incidence Relative Risk (IRR) 3.12, 95% CI: 1.01\u20109.61, P = 0.047] _ENREF_17. On the other hand, there was no statistical evidence of an increase in influenza A\u2010related ARI hospitalization incidence in post\u2010A/H1N1pdm09 compared to Pre\u2010A/H1N1pdm09 period [IRR 0.69, 95% CI: 0.35\u20101.38, P = 0.293].\n\nWith regard to the demographic and clinical characterization of overall paediatric ARI hospitalization cases enrolled in the current study (n = 4,429), 2,602 were male (58.8%), and the median age (in months) was 16.6 (IQR: 8.6\u201027.3). Other demographic information, including socioeconomic status, medical history, as well as detailed clinical information, was summarized in Table 2.\n\nThe demographic and clinical characteristics between influenza B (n = 133) and non\u2010influenza B ARI groups (n = 4296) were compared (Table 2). The male proportion was higher in the non\u2010influenza B ARI group (50.4%, influenza B vs 59.0%, non\u2010influenza B, P = 0.046). Regarding the median age (in month), the influenza B ARI group was older (22.9, influenza B vs 16.5, non\u2010influenza B, P < 0.001), and the greater proportion of ARI children were 3 years or older in the influenza B ARI group. Furthermore, family smoking was more frequent in the influenza B ARI group (P = 0.003).\n\nWith respect to the clinical information, the respiratory rate (per min) was faster in the non\u2010influenza B ARI group (32.0, influenza B vs 33.0, non\u2010influenza B, P = 0.012) (Table 2). Furthermore, ARI children with wheeze (P = 0.005) and breathing difficulty (P = 0.022) were more common in the non\u2010influenza B ARI group. The proportion of paediatric ARI hospitalizations with chest X\u2010ray abnormal findings was also greater in the non\u2010influenza B ARI group (15.0%, influenza B vs 29.0%, non\u2010influenza B, P < 0.001). The result of multivariate analyses presented that non\u2010influenza B ARI cases were associated with the increased risks of respiratory clinical presentations after adjusting for sex, age, and family smoking status. For instance, the risk of wheeze was 1.51 (95% CI: 1.07\u20102.13) times, breathing difficulty was 2.21 (95% CI: 1.09\u20104.48) times, and chest X\u2010ray abnormality was 2.56 (95% CI: 1.54\u20104.25) times greater in non\u2010influenza B ARI cases. The median WBC titre was higher in the non\u2010influenza B ARI group (9.2 \u00d7 103 cells/uL, influenza B vs 11.5 \u00d7 103 cells/uL, non\u2010influenza B, P < 0.001).\n\nFurthermore, in the comparison between influenza A and B, influenza B\u2010associated ARI hospitalizations were slightly older with different age distribution pattern (P = 0.002) (Table S2). Parental smoking was more common in influenza B ARI group (P = 0.011). Regarding the clinical information, influenza A group was associated with higher body temperature (P = 0.003) as well as frequent presence of chest X\u2010ray abnormality (P < 0.001).\n\nAmong 133 influenza B\u2010associated paediatric ARI hospitalization cases detected from February 2007\u2010June 2013, a total of 106 influenza B samples were analyzed for Haemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein nucleotide sequences. Of 106 influenza B HA gene sequenced ARI samples, 91 (85.9%) were successfully sequenced and utilized for phylogenetic analysis.\n\nRegarding the influenza B lineage\u2010specific seasonal trend during the current investigation period, no distinct trend was observed in the pre\u2010A/H1N1pdm09 period (Figure 1). However, starting from post\u2010A/H1N1pdm09, two peaks of influenza B\u2010associated ARIs appeared within a year: from February through June and from October through December (Figure 1), which was mainly contributed by Victoria lineage\u2010related ARI hospitalizations, particularly in 2010 (n = 28) and 2012 (n = 37) (Table S3). On the contrary, the overall number of Yamagata lineage\u2010related ARI hospitalizations was limited throughout the investigation period in both pre\u2010 and post\u2010A/H1N1pdm09 periods.\n\nIn the demographic characteristics comparison between influenza B Victoria (n = 72) and Yamagata (n = 19) lineages, the median age (in month) was older among Victoria lineage ARI cases (25.8, Victoria lineage vs 19.7, Yamagata lineage, P = 0.056) with a slightly higher proportion of ARIs in the 2 years and older age group in Victoria lineage (P = 0.126) (Table 3). Furthermore, kindergarten attendance was more frequent in the Victoria lineage ARI group (55.6%, Victoria lineage vs 21.1%, Yamagata lineage, P = 0.010). ARI hospitalizations, with the presence of underlying medical conditions and co\u2010infection with other respiratory viruses, were common in both lineages.\n\nRegarding the clinical manifestation comparison between influenza B lineages, SpO2 (\u226690%) was more commonly seen in the Yamagata lineage ARI group (15.8%, Yamagata lineage vs 1.4%, Victoria lineage, P = 0.028) (Table 3). Furthermore, the median body temperature (\u00b0C) was higher in the Yamagata lineage (38.5, Yamagata lineage vs 37.6, Victoria lineage, P = 0.017). Other respiratory\u2010related clinical information, such as the presence of wheeze, tachypnea, and chest X\u2010ray abnormal findings were also relatively more common in Yamagata lineage ARI group with no statistically significant differences.\n\nThe seasonal prevalence of WHO Groups in both influenza B lineages, circulating during the present study period, was investigated. With respect to the Victoria lineage, a remarkable shift in the dominantly circulating WHO Group was detected in post\u2010A/H1N1pdm09 period: Group 5 (B/Singapore/19/2009) was the dominant type during Mar 2010\u2010Mar 2011, which was rapidly replaced by Group 1 (B/Brisbane/60/2008) in Dec 2011\u2010Apr 2013 (Figure 2).\n\nRegarding the seasonal prevalence of Yamagata lineage WHO Group, Group 2 and 3 were detected with no particular circulation trend or shift in dominant Group over the course of investigation period. A detailed seasonal prevalence of WHO Groups in both influenza B lineages was summarized in Table S3.\n\nFirstly, demographic information among WHO Groups (1, 4, and 5) of Victoria lineage was compared (Table 4). There were no significant differences in sex distribution and median age among the three groups. Daycare attendance was more common in Group 5 compared to Group 1 (73.1%, Group 5 vs 45.2%, Group 1, P = 0.043). Furthermore, the proportion of hospitalized ARI children with antibiotic usage prior to the hospital admission (P < 0.001) and the presence of underlying medical conditions (P = 0.002) was greater in Group 1 compared to Groups 4 and 5. In addition, co\u2010infections with other respiratory viruses were common in both Groups 1 and 5 (16.7%, Group 1 vs 30.8%, Group 5, P = 0.231).\n\nWith respect to clinical characterization of WHO Groups in Victoria lineage, wheeze (P = 0.002), tachypnea (P = 0.026), and crackle (P = 0.019) were more commonly observed in Group 1 than in the other two groups (Table 4). Furthermore, hospitalized ARI cases with Group 1 presented the greater proportion of LRTIs compared to Group 5 (23.8%, Group 1 vs 3.9%, Group 5, P = 0.041). Although statistically not significant, ARI children infected with Group 1 presented relatively higher proportions of chest X\u2010ray abnormality and radiologically\u2010confirmed pneumonia in comparison to Groups 4 and 5.\n\nFor demographic and clinical information comparison in Yamagata lineage WHO Groups, we could only include eleven ARI cases of Group 2 and seven of Group 3 in the statistical analyses (Table S4). With regard to demographic characterization, no statistically significant differences were detected between Groups 2 and 3. Both Group 2\u2010 and Group 3\u2010associated ARI hospitalizations were commonly observed among children younger than 2 years. The results of a comparison in clinical manifestations did not reveal any significant differences.\n\nThis is the first study to describe the detailed clinical\u2010epidemiological information of influenza B among hospitalized paediatric ARI cases in Vietnam. During the study period, both influenza A and B ARI hospitalizations were frequently detected in children younger than 2 years. The first A/H1N1pdm09\u2010associated ARI hospitalization case was reported in July 2009.32 Noticeably, the incidence of influenza B ARI hospitalization in the post\u2010A/H1N1pdm09 period increased dramatically, particularly in 2010 and 2012. Furthermore, Victoria lineage was dominant in post\u2010A/H1N1pdm09, and the dominantly circulating WHO Group shifted each year. Importantly, Victoria lineage WHO Group 1\u2010associated ARIs were clinically more severe in comparison with Group 5, presenting greater proportions in wheeze, tachypnea, and LRTI. Therefore, our current results highlight both the increased clinical importance of influenza B among paediatric ARI hospitalizations in central Vietnam in the post\u2010A/H1N1pdm09 period and the difference in respiratory\u2010related clinical severity among WHO Groups of Victoria lineage, which could help in the future nationwide influenza vaccination program and for proper clinical management in hospital settings.\n\nDuring the current investigation period, overall influenza (A/B)\u2010associated paediatric ARI hospitalization incidence ranged from 122 to 267 (per 100 000 population) (Table 1). Both influenza A and B ARI incidences were high among children under 5 years. In fact, the proportion of hospitalized ARI children over 5 years was greater in the influenza B ARI group compared to influenza A (8.8%, influenza A vs 15.5%, influenza B, P = 0.002) (data not shown), which was consistent with the previous reports from China and Finland.3, 33, 34 In the current study site, influenza B\u2010related paediatric ARI hospitalization incidence was low in Pre\u2010A/H1N1pdm09 period. However, influenza B ARI incidence dramatically increased in post\u2010A/H1N1pdm09, which resembled the previous reports from Brazil, Cambodia, China, India, and Taiwan.4, 17, 18, 20, 21, 35 As it was previously described, the emergence of A/H1N1pdm09 strain might have affected the viral etiology and seasonal circulation pattern of childhood ARIs.36 We concluded that the A/H1N1pdm09 outbreak occurred around mid\u20102009 in our study site and assumed that a large population in the community might have been infected with this new A/H1N1pdm09 strain. This may have led to the development of non\u2010specific antiviral immunity in the target community, which may have disrupted the circulation trend of other respiratory viruses, including influenza B. Interestingly, we also observed unusual split of RSV seasonal peak in 2010 as we previously described.37 Further studies would be necessary to understand the effect of A/H1N1pdm09 on respiratory virus circulation trend.\n\nAmong all the paediatric ARI hospitalization cases enrolled in the current study, 133 were influenza B positive (Table 2). The median age in influenza B ARI group was older than non\u2010influenza B ARIs, and influenza B group presented the higher proportion of family smoking, which is known to be one of the major risk factors for influenza morbidity and mortality.38, 39 Passive smoking from family member might have an effect on suppression of humoral\u2010 and cell\u2010mediated immunity, which makes children more susceptible to influenza infections. However, the mechanism is not fully understood. Passive smoking in general may put children at the risk of ARI hospitalization due to viral infection; however, there is not yet clear evidence regarding the absolute effect of passive smoking on ARI hospitalization in different viral pathogens. The slightly older age of infection by influenza B compared to non\u2010influenza B (22.9 months vs 16.5 months, P < 0.001) may explain an increased susceptibility by passive smoking in older age group. In the future study, we need to follow up children with positive passive smoking status in order to understand the effect of passive smoking on virus\u2010related ARI hospitalization in each virus respectively. Regarding clinical manifestation, influenza B ARI group was less severe than non\u2010influenza B, which might be due to the fact that influenza B ARI cases were relatively older. Also, the higher blood WBC titre in non\u2010influenza B ARI group was most likely due to a certain proportion of bacteria\u2010associated ARIs counted in non\u2010influenza B ARI group. In the comparison between influenza A and B, there were no remarkable differences except for the higher prevalence of parental smoking in influenza B ARI group (Table S2). Further study would be necessary to understand the effect of secondary smoking on susceptibility against influenza infection. In the clinical information comparison, influenza A group presented higher body temperature and frequent presence of chest X\u2010ray abnormality. Yet, other clinical presentations were similar between two. Although a study mentioned that influenza B patients frequently presented gastrointestinal symptoms,40 the actual difference in clinical severity between influenza A and B has been controversial up to date.41, 42, 43 Further continuous epidemiological surveillance would be necessary to gain a deeper understanding in the clinical aspect of influenza infection.\n\nWith respect to influenza B lineage specific seasonal trend in our study site, Victoria lineage was dominant in post\u2010A/H1N1pdm09 period (Figure 1), which was similar to studies from India, Cambodia, and Taiwan.4, 17, 18, 20 A previous report described Victoria lineage might possess greater viral transmissibility based on the estimated reproductive number (Re) as well as the faster molecular evolutionary rate compared to Yamagata lineage.44 The difference in viral transmissibility capacity between genetically distinct lineages may explain the predominance by Victoria lineage in the current study site. Furthermore, the difference in viral virulence may have played a role in increase of Victoria lineage\u2010associated ARI hospitalizations. We also have to take the lineage\u2010specific sero\u2010epidemiological information into account to gain a better understanding of influenza B lineage circulation pattern. A study from Taiwan suggested switching of dominantly circulating lineage may occur every 2\u20103 years.18 In the future study, we will continue monitoring the lineage\u2010specific circulation trend of influenza B strains in order to investigate the lineage\u2010specific viral transmissibility based on the viral genetic variation.\n\nRegarding the demographic information of influenza B lineages, median age was slightly older in Victoria lineage (Table 3), which contradicted the reports from China and Slovenia that presented Victoria lineage ARIs were younger than Yamagata lineage.21, 45 The difference in age of infection has been controversial due to the differences in inclusion criteria among studies. Furthermore, clinical aspect of influenza B lineages is poorly understood. In the current study, the clinical data did not present a significant difference between lineages (Table 3), which was in line with previous reports from China, France, Serbia, and Slovenia.41, 45, 46, 47, 48 Although the body temperature was slightly higher in Yamagata lineage ARIs, it was probably due to the difference in age distribution. In our study, the hospitalization duration did not differ between lineages, which contradicted the previous study that presented longer time to symptom resolution in Victoria lineage.47 Moreover, another study by Chi et al reported that Yamagata lineage ARIs were associated with invasive LRTI.49 Therefore, there exists inconsistency regarding the information of influenza B lineage\u2010specific demographic and clinical characteristics.\n\nRegarding the seasonal circulation trend of WHO Groups in each lineage, we did not find a distinct circulation trend in the pre\u2010A/H1N1pdm09 period (Figure 2). However, starting from the post\u2010A/H1N1pdm09 period, WHO Group\u2010specific circulation trend became apparent in Victoria lineage, in which Group 5 was dominant during Mar 2010\u2010Mar 2011, and then followed by Group 1 in Dec 2011\u2010Apr 2013. In HA glycoprotein coding region that we targeted for nucleotide sequencing in the current study, Group 1 and 5 possess distinct amino acid (AA) substitutions at two sites within major antigenic regions: 120\u2010loop (Lysine (K) in Group 1 and Asparagine (N) in Group 5) and 160\u2010loop (Lysine (K) in Group 1 and Asparagine (N) in Group 5)(B/Brisbane/60/2008 strain (Accession number: FJ766840) as the reference of AA position).50 These two AA substitutions were located proximity to the biding site to SA\u2010galactose linkage, yet not within actual binding site. Therefore, genetically distinct groups may have different receptor binding affinities, viral transmissibility, which may have been linked with the sudden increase by Group 5 in Mar 2010\u2010Mar 2011. Further studies would be necessary to understand the role of differences in AA composition within major antigenic region on the receptor binding capacity and viral transmissibility.\n\nOur current result was consistent with the previous finding that a dominantly circulating Group in 1 year would be replaced by another Group in the following year.22 To the best of our knowledge, this was the first study describing the dramatic shift in Groups between years in Vietnam.\n\nMost importantly, ARI cases infected with Victoria lineage Group 1 were more frequently associated with severe clinical manifestations such as wheeze, tachypnea, crackle and LRTI in comparison with Group 4 and 5. One possible explanation is the distinct amino acid composition within HA gene of Victoria lineage Groups may possess Group\u2010specific binding preference to sialic acid (SA)\u2010galactose linkage, \u03b12,3 or \u03b12,6. It was previously described that few amino acid substitutions in HA glycoprotein could affect receptor binding specificity.51 For example, Asp\u2010225\u2010Gly substitution of A/H1N1pdm09 strain resulted in increased binding affinity to \u03b12,3\u2010SA linkage, which enhanced disease severity.52, 53, 54 It is important to investigate the clinical role of two amino acid substitutions within major antigenic regions between Victoria lineage Group 1 and 5. Therefore, the pathological and clinical importance of Victoria lineage Group\u2010specific amino acid composition within HA glycoprotein antigenic regions needs to be further investigated.\n\nAs one of the limitations in the clinical manifestation comparison of WHO groups, we were not capable of performing multivariate analysis adjusting for confounding variables due to the small sample size in each Group. Since the presence of an underlying medical condition was described to be one of the major risk factors for developing severe influenza B\u2010related ARI infection,46 our primary clinical finding of the association of Victoria lineage Group 1 with clinical severity, should be carefully interpreted as its severity could have been effected by the higher prevalence of an underlying medical condition in Group 1. Co\u2010infection with other respiratory viruses should be taken into account in future analysis as the frequency of co\u2010infection with other respiratory pathogens were relatively high in both WHO Group 1 and 5, rate of which was comparable to previous studies.55, 56 Some previous studies have described the importance of viral co\u2010infection on clinical outcome.57, 58 Bacterial co\u2010infection among influenza ARIs is also known to be the risk factor for developing severe clinical manifestation.59 However, we did not conduct bacteria detection in the current study. Nevertheless, WBC count did not differ among Groups. In future studies, it would be important to elucidate the biological role of bacterial co\u2010infection on influenza B infections. Lastly, we did not obtain clinical data from those who did not require hospitalization, which made it difficult to estimate the clinical importance of influenza B as well as viral transmissibility. In the future study, we would collect data from mild ARIs and healthy children in the target community to gain a better understanding of the clinical role of influenza B.\n\nThe authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\n\nKA, DAD and LMY designed the study.
