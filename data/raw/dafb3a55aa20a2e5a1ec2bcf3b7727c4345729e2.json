{"title": "Article T-bet + Treg Cells Undergo Abortive Th1 Cell Differentiation due to Impaired Expression of IL-12 Receptor b2", "body": "The appropriate differentiation of naive T helper cells into functionally specialized effector lineages is critical for generating productive immune responses against different types of pathogens. T helper 1 (Th1) cells are required for immunity to intracellular pathogens and develop from naive precursors via a multistep mechanism involving sequential activation of the transcription factors STAT1, T-bet, and STAT4. Initially, T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation in conjunction with STAT1 activation by cytokines such as IFN-g induce low-level expression of the transcription factor T-bet, which in turn drives expression of the inducible IL-12 receptor component IL-12Rb2 (Afkarian et al., 2002; Mullen et al., 2001) . This allows the cells to undergo IL-12-dependent activation of STAT4, whereupon STAT4 and T-bet act independently and synergistically to drive expression of the signature inflammatory cytokine IFN-g, as well as other genes required for the proper function of Th1 cells (Thieu et al., 2008; Wei et al., 2010) .\n\nIn addition to effector Th subsets, Foxp3 + regulatory T (Treg) cells comprise a distinct CD4 + T cell lineage important for dampening inflammation and preventing autoimmunity (Sakaguchi et al., 2008) . Treg cell differentiation occurs primarily in the thymus, where developing T cells upregulate Foxp3 upon recognition of self-antigen and stimulation with IL-2 or IL-15. Thus, the TCR repertoire of Treg cells is believed to be heavily biased toward autoreactivity (Lio and Hsieh, 2011) . Like conventional CD4 + Th cells, Treg cells can be subdivided into distinct subsets on the basis of differential expression of homing receptors and activation markers (Huehn et al., 2004; Min et al., 2007) , and multiple functional mechanisms of suppression have been ascribed to Treg cells (Vignali et al., 2008; Shevach, 2009; Tang and Bluestone, 2008) . Indeed, the ability of Treg cells to control different types of Th cell responses depends on their expression of specific Th cell-associated transcription factors Koch et al., 2009; Zheng et al., 2009) . For example, although T-bet is considered the ''master regulator'' of Th1 cell differentiation, Treg cells selectively upregulate T-bet during type 1 inflammatory responses in vivo, and T-betdeficient Treg cells display diminished expression of the Th1 cell-associated chemokine receptor CXCR3 and fail to rescue Foxp3-deficient mice from Th1 cell-mediated inflammatory disease (Koch et al., 2009) . Thus, the phenotypic and functional heterogeneity of Treg cells helps ensure that they can modulate different types of immune responses in both lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissue sites (Campbell and Koch, 2011) .\n\nThe diversity of peripheral Treg cells suggests that they alter their migratory, functional, and homeostatic properties in response to contextual cues from the immune environment. However, the mechanisms guiding the development of specialized Treg cell subsets, and the ways in which they mirror and diverge from the comparatively well-characterized pathways of effector T cell differentiation, have not been extensively explored. In addition, the autoreactivity of Treg cells presents a significant danger if they were to acquire proinflammatory effector functions. Thus, strict mechanisms that limit the functional reprogramming of Treg cells during strong inflammatory responses are thought to exist. For instance, despite upregulating T-bet during Th1 cell inflammatory responses, T-bet + Treg cells do not typically produce IFN-g (Koch et al., 2009 ). However, IFN-g-producing Treg cells have been observed during the dysregulated immune responses associated with autoimmune disease or infection-induced immunopathologies (Oldenhove et al., 2009; Zhao et al., 2011) . This has led to the notion that Treg cells retain a considerable degree of functional plasticity (Zhou et al., 2009) , although this notion has been questioned in subsequent studies (Rubtsov et al., 2010; Miyao et al., 2012) .\n\nIn this study, we examined the cellular and molecular pathway leading to the upregulation of T-bet by Treg cells and explored the mechanisms limiting their ability to acquire proinflammatory effector functions in Th1 cell-polarizing inflammatory environments. We demonstrate that activation of STAT1 by effector T cell-derived IFN-g induced T-bet expression in Treg cells. However, delayed induction of the IL-12 receptor component IL-12 Rb2 prevented Treg cells from completing STAT4dependent Th1 cell differentiation during acute type 1 inflammatory responses. Thus, abortive Th1 cell differentiation driven by activation of STAT1, but not STAT4, results in the generation of functionally specialized T-bet + Treg cells that effectively modulate Th1 cell responses without acquiring proinflammatory effector functions.\n\nWe recently identified and characterized a population of T-bet + CXCR3 + Treg cells that express elevated amounts of Il10 and that are important for regulating strong Th1 cell responses (Koch et al., 2009) . Moreover, the frequency of this Treg cell population is increased during Th1 cell responses, but substantially reduced in mice lacking STAT1. This suggests that like effector T cells, Treg cells upregulate T-bet during Th1 cell responses after STAT1 activation. Consistent with this, nearly all Foxp3 + Treg cells rapidly phosphorylated STAT1 after treatment with the STAT1-activating cytokines IFN-g or IL-27 ( Figure S1 available online). Additionally, in vitro stimulation in the presence of either IFN-g or IL-27 potently induced T-bet expression in sorted CD4 + Foxp3 + CD62L + CXCR3 \u00c0 naive phenotype Treg cells (Figure 1A) . To determine whether Treg cells are exposed to STAT1-activating cytokines in vivo, we constructed mixed bone marrow (BM) chimeras using congenically marked wildtype and Stat1 \u00c0/\u00c0 donors and compared the phenotype of Foxp3 + Treg cells derived from each donor 8 weeks later. Indeed, whereas $25%-30% of the splenic Treg cells from the wild-type donor were T-bet + CXCR3 + , this population of Treg cells was nearly absent from the Stat1 \u00c0/\u00c0 cells ( Figure 1B) .\n\nTreg cell expression of T-bet and CXCR3 is reduced in mice lacking the STAT1-activating IFN-g receptor (IFN-gR [Koch et al., 2009] ), indicating that IFN-g is the principle STAT1-activating cytokine driving the development of T-bet + CXCR3 + Treg cells. Moreover, CXCR3 + Treg cells from Ifngr \u00c0/\u00c0 mice displayed a slight (<2-fold) decrease in T-bet protein expression relative to CXCR3 + Treg cells from wild-type animals ( Figure S2 ), further (B) Flow cytometric analysis of CXCR3 and T-bet expression by gated wild-type-or Stat1 \u00c0/\u00c0 -derived CD4 + Foxp3 + splenocytes in mixed bone marrow chimeras.

However, tissue inflammation results in the upregulation of numerous inflammatory and regulatory cytokines, several of which (i.e., IL-27) can activate STAT1 and may induce T-bet and CXCR3 expression in Treg cells in the absence of IFN-g. To determine whether these cytokines can compensate for loss of IFN-g signaling during strong inflammatory responses in vivo, we induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a demyelinating inflammatory disease mediated by autoreactive Th1 and Th17 cells (Dardalhon et al., 2008) , in mixed BM chimeras containing a 1:1 ratio of congenically marked wild-type and Ifngr1 \u00c0/\u00c0 cells. Loss of IFN-gRmediated signaling did not impair the accumulation of CD4 + T cells in the central nervous system (CNS; data not shown). However, expression of T-bet and CXCR3 were substantially reduced in Ifngr1 \u00c0/\u00c0 Treg cells in both the CNS and spleen (Figure 1C and data not shown) . Additionally, consistent with the large amount of Il10 expressed by CXCR3 + Treg cells, Ifngr1 \u00c0/\u00c0 Treg cells in the CNS showed decreased IL-10 production at day 19 ( Figure 1D ), a late time point associated with Treg cellmediated amelioration of disease (Korn et al., 2007; McGeachy et al., 2005) . Thus, even during strong inflammatory responses associated with EAE, IFN-g promotes the functional specialization of Treg cells by controlling the expression of molecules such as CXCR3 and IL-10 that are critical for Treg cell-mediated disease suppression (McGeachy et al., 2005; M\u00fc ller et al., 2007) .\n\nThe homeostasis of Treg cells is controlled in part by IL-2 produced by CD4 + CD44 hi Foxp3 \u00c0 effector T cells (Setoguchi et al., 2005) , establishing a link between effector T cell activation and Treg cell abundance. To determine whether effector T cells also control Treg cell specialization via production of IFN-g, we injected a 9:1 ratio of BM cells from Tcrb \u00c0/\u00c0 Tcrd \u00c0/\u00c0 and Ifng \u00c0/\u00c0 donors into irradiated Tcrb \u00c0/\u00c0 Tcrd \u00c0/\u00c0 recipients in order to construct animals in which all nonhematopoietic cells, as well as 90% of non-T cells, were IFN-g sufficient, whereas all T cells were derived from Ifng \u00c0/\u00c0 donor BM. Control chimeras were generated using a 9:1 mixture of Tcrb \u00c0/\u00c0 Tcrd \u00c0/\u00c0 and wild-type BM cells. We found the that frequency of T-bet + CXCR3 + Treg cells in the spleens, peripheral lymph nodes, and peritoneal cavities of mice lacking T cell-derived IFN-g was substantially lower than in the wild-type control chimeras ( Figure 2A ).\n\nTo determine whether IFN-g produced by effector T cells is sufficient to induce CXCR3 and T-bet expression by Treg cells, we transferred OVA-specific CD4 + Th1 cells from OT-II TCR transgenic mice into wild-type and Ifng \u00c0/\u00c0 recipients. These mice were then given OVA 323-339 peptide (OVAp) in PBS on days 1 and 4 after transfer, and we examined the endogenous Treg cells in these animals 3 days later. Indeed, in both wildtype and Ifng \u00c0/\u00c0 mice given OT-II Th1 cells and OVAp, we observed a 3-to 4-fold increase in the fraction of T-bet + CXCR3 + Treg cells as compared to mice receiving OVAp alone ( Figure 2B ). Similarly, activation of effector CD8 + T cells from OT-I TCR transgenic mice in vivo also increased Treg cell expression of T-bet and CXCR3 ( Figure S3 ). Thus, through the production of IFN-g, both CD4 + and CD8 + effector T cells can directly control the specialization of Treg cells.\n\nIn addition to the STAT1 activating cytokines, IL-12 has an essential role in Th1 cell differentiation (Trinchieri, 2003; Hsieh et al., 1993; Manetti et al., 1993) , and activation of STAT4 via the IL-12 receptor is necessary for expression of genes required for Th1 cell function (Thieu et al., 2008; Wei et al., 2010) . However, Treg cell expression of T-bet and CXCR3 was unaltered in IL-12Rb2-deficient mice ( Figures 3A and S2 ), indicating that STAT4 activation via IL-12R is dispensable for the differentiation of T-bet + Treg cells.\n\nAlthough most T cells express the IL-12 receptor subunit IL-12Rb1, naive CD4 + T cells lack expression of IL-12Rb2 and \n\n(A) Representative flow cytometric analysis of CXCR3 and T-bet expression by CD4 + Foxp3 + cells isolated from the spleens of mixed bone marrow chimeras containing T cells derived from WT (left) or Ifng \u00c0/\u00c0 (right) donors. The graph shows the frequency of CXCR3 + T-bet + cells among total CD4 + Foxp3 + (Treg) cells isolated from the spleens, peripheral lymph nodes (PLN), and peritoneal exudate cells (PEC) of the indicated chimeras.

Induction of IL-12Rb2 downstream of STAT1 and T-bet is a key checkpoint in Th1 cell development (Afkarian et al., 2002; Mullen et al., 2001) . Indeed, whereas both Foxp3 + CXCR3 + Treg cells and Foxp3 \u00c0 CXCR3 + Th1 cells expressed Il12rb1, expression of Il12rb2 was $100-fold lower in CXCR3 + Treg cells ( Figure 3B ). Accordingly, these cells failed to phosphorylate STAT4 in response to IL-12 in vitro ( Figure 3C ). To determine whether Foxp3 + CXCR3 + Treg cells showed evidence of STAT4 activation, we compared expression of several STAT4-controlled genes in sorted Foxp3 + CXCR3 + Treg cells and Foxp3 \u00c0 CXCR3 + Th1 cells (Wei et al., 2010) . Consistent with their lack of IL-12 responsiveness, expression of each of these genes was substantially lower in the CXCR3 + Treg cells compared with the Foxp3 \u00c0 Th1 cells ( Figure 3D ). Thus, despite having undergone STAT1-dependent T-bet upregulation, CXCR3 + Treg cells failed to acquire IL-12 responsiveness through upregulation of IL-12Rb2 and consequently lacked the STAT4-dependent genetic signature characteristic of fully differentiated Th1 cells.\n\nThe striking lack of IL-12 responsiveness in T-bet + CXCR3 + Treg cells suggests that regulation of IL-12Rb2 expression is different in Foxp3 + and Foxp3 \u00c0 cells. Alternatively, chronic TCR stimulation can inhibit IL-12Rb2 induction (Schulz et al., 2009) , and this may limit its expression in autoreactive Treg cells. To differentiate between these possibilities, we compared acquisition of IL-12 responsiveness in Foxp3 + and Foxp3 \u00c0 CD4 + T cells stimulated in vitro under identical conditions.

(D) Representative qPCR analysis of expression the STAT4 regulated genes Nkg7, Id2, Il21, and Ffar by sorted Foxp3 + CXCR3 + or Foxp3 \u00c0 CXCR3 + CD4 + splenocytes isolated from Foxp3 gfp mice. Data in all panels are representative of at least two independent experiments. type CD4 + CD62L + CXCR3 \u00c0 Foxp3 \u00c0 and CD4 + CD62L + CXCR3 \u00c0 Foxp3 + T cells were activated in the presence of IL-2 and IFN-g for 3 days, at which point the cells were removed from the TCR stimulus and cultured in cytokines for three additional days. We measured STAT4 phosphorylation after IL-12 treatment in the Foxp3 + and Foxp3 \u00c0 cells daily starting at day 2 of culture. IL-12 responsiveness in the Foxp3 \u00c0 cells was evident by day 2 of activation, peaked by day 4, and was maintained throughout the remainder of the culture ( Figure 4A , top). In comparison, acquisition of IL-12 responsiveness was substantially delayed in the Foxp3 + Treg cells, which did not become IL-12 responsive until day 4 of culture ( Figure 4A , bottom). However, by day 6 the Foxp3 + and Foxp3 \u00c0 cells displayed roughly equivalent STAT4 phosphorylation after IL-12 treatment. Importantly, Treg cells became IL-12 responsive on day 4 of culture even when removed from the TCR stimulus at earlier time points (day 1 or 2) postactivation (data not shown), indicating that TCR stimulation is not the primary factor inhibiting their expression of Il12rb2.\n\nThe delay in acquisition of IL-12 responsiveness suggests that T-bet-dependent induction of Il12rb2 expression is impaired in Treg cells. To directly test this, we sorted Foxp3 + and Foxp3 \u00c0 CD4 + T cells from T-bet-deficient Tbx21 \u00c0/\u00c0 Foxp3 gfp mice, stimulated them in vitro with plate-bound anti-CD3 and anti-CD28, and infected them with a retroviral construct encoding a T-betestrogen receptor (T-bet-ER) fusion protein whose activity is modulated by the estrogen analog 4-hydroxytamoxifin (4-HT). The infected cells were cultured for 3 days with varying concentrations of 4-HT, at which point we assessed their expression of Cxcr3 and Il12rb2. As expected, activation of T-bet led to robust induction of Cxcr3 mRNA expression in both Foxp3 + and Foxp3 \u00c0 cells ( Figure S4 ). However, induction of Il12rb2 was observed only in Foxp3 \u00c0 cells ( Figure 4B ), demonstrating that the regulation of this gene is markedly different in Foxp3 + and Foxp3 \u00c0 CD4 + T cells.\n\nTo explore the molecular basis for the differential regulation of Il12rb2 in Foxp3 + and Foxp3 \u00c0 cells, we compared the epigenetic status of the Il12rb2 promoter in naive CD4 + T cells and Treg cells through analysis of genome-wide histone modification data (Wei et al., 2009) . In naive CD4 + T cells, the Il12rb2 promoter is marked by both permissive H3K4me3 and repressive H3K27me3 histone modifications ( Figure 4C , top). Consistent with the rapid induction of Il12rb2 in developing Th1 cells, this bivalent state is believed to repress gene transcription while keeping the promoter ''poised'' for activation-induced expression (Bernstein et al., 2006) . By contrast, only H3K27me3 marks are found at the Il12rb2 promoter in Treg cells ( Figure 4C , bottom). Thus, expression in Treg cells probably requires substantial epigenetic remodeling of the Il12rb2 promoter, involving both the removal of repressive histone modifications and the addition of permissive modifications.\n\nAlthough IL-12 has been reported to induce IFN-g-production by Foxp3 + Treg cells in vitro, it does so inefficiently, with only $5% of CD4 + Foxp3 + cells producing IFN-g after activation for 3 days in the presence of IL-12 (Wei et al., 2009) . Moreover, a recent study demonstrating that Foxp3 + cells contain a small population of effector T cells suggests that at least some of the observed IFN-g production could result from these contaminating cells (Miyao et al., 2012) . Indeed, we found that IL-12 alone failed to induce IFN-g expression by sorted CD4 + CD62L + CXCR3 \u00c0 Foxp3 + naive phenotype Treg cells, which are less likely to contain contaminating activated effector cells ( Figure S5 ).\n\nThe stringent regulation of IL-12Rb2 expression in autoreactive Treg cells may serve as a tolerance mechanism that prevents them from undergoing IL-12-dependent functional differentiation and acquiring potentially dangerous proinflammatory properties such as the ability to produce IFN-g. Alternatively, the inability of Treg cells to produce IFN-g may result from direct inhibition of Ifng expression by Foxp3 or other Treg cell-specific repressive mechanisms. To determine how IL-12 receptor signaling functionally impacts Treg cells, we activated sorted CD4 + Foxp3 + CD62L + CXCR3 \u00c0 naive phenotype Treg cells in the presence of IFN-g for 6 days to render the cells IL-12 responsive. We then cultured these cells with or without IL-12 for 3 additional days, examined their ability to produce IFN-g, and assessed their suppressive function in vitro. Despite the reported ability of Foxp3 to directly inhibit IFN-g expression (Ono et al., 2007) , IL-12 potently induced IFN-g production in both Foxp3 + and Foxp3 \u00c0 cells that had been ''primed'' with IFN-g ( Figure 5A ). In addition, IL-12 treatment substantially reduced the ability of Treg cells to inhibit effector T cell proliferation ( Figure 5B ). Thus, IL-12 can alter the balance between pro-and anti-inflammatory functions in Treg cells, emphasizing the importance of regulating IL-12 responsiveness in order to maintain Treg cellmediated immune suppression during strong type 1 inflammatory responses.\n\nTreg Cells Undergo Abortive Th1 Cell Development during Acute Bacterial Infection Although robust, production of IL-12 during infection with intracellular pathogens is typically very transient. Because Treg cells are poised to respond to IFN-g, but display delayed induction of (B) qPCR analysis of Il12rb2 mRNA expression by CD4 + Foxp3 + and CD4 + Foxp3 \u00c0 cells isolated from Tbx21 \u00c0/\u00c0 Foxp3 gfp mice, infected with the T-bet-ER encoding retroviruses, and cultured for 3 days with the indicated doses of 4-HT. Data are presented as fold induction of mRNA expression over infected cells not given 4-HT and are representative of two independent experiments. (C) Distribution of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 histone modifications along the Il12rb2 locus in the indicated CD4 + T cell subsets. ChIP-Seq data (Wei et al., 2009 ) was mapped to the Feb. 2006 (NCBI36/mm8) mouse genome assembly with the UCSC genome browser. Annotation of the Il12rb2 locus appears above, and the peaks represent the density of sequence tags assigned to each chromosomal region. The region surrounding the proximal promoter and exon 1 of Il12rb2 is boxed.\n\nAbortive Th1 Cell Differentiation of Treg Cells IL-12Rb2, we predicted that during acute type 1 inflammatory responses they would undergo partial Th1 cell differentiation driven by activation of STAT1 but not STAT4. To test this, we monitored cytokine responses in different splenic lymphocyte populations throughout the course of acute infection with the intracellular bacterial pathogen L. monocytogenes, which provokes a strong, IL-12-dependent Th1 response.\n\nConsistent with the transient appearance of IL-12p70 in the serum of L. monocytogenes-infected mice (Way et al., 2007; Seki et al., 2002) , the Il12a and Il12b genes were strongly upregulated in the spleen within 1 day of infection, after which their expression was rapidly extinguished ( Figure 6A and data not shown). Moreover, direct ex vivo analysis of CD4 + Foxp3 \u00c0 CD44 hi T cells (without any in vitro restimulation) showed that $25% of these effector T cells in the spleen were phospho(p)-STAT4 + on day 1 after infection and that a substantial fraction of the pSTAT4 + cells were also producing IFN-g ( Figures 6B and 6C) . However, mirroring the sharp decline in IL-12 cytokine expression, the frequency of pSTAT4 + IFN-g-producing effector T cells fell dramatically on days 2 and 3 after infection. By contrast, less than 5% of splenic Treg cells were pSTAT4 + directly ex vivo at any time point examined during infection ( Figures 6B, middle, and 6C) . Indeed, IL-12 responsiveness, as measured by the ability to phosphorylate STAT4 after in vitro IL-12 treatment, emerged in only a small fraction of Treg cells between days 3-5 postinfection, after production of IL-12 had ceased ( Figure 6B, right) .\n\nCoincident with the robust IFN-g production by effector T cells, we observed a dramatic increase in STAT1 phosphorylation in Treg cells on days 1 and 2 postinfection ( Figure 7A) . Accordingly, expression of T-bet and CXCR3 was dramatically elevated in Treg cells from L. monocytogenes infected mice. However, consistent with their inability to respond to IL-12 early in infection, very few Treg cells acquired the ability to produce IFN-g ( Figure 7B ). To determine whether IL-12 receptor signaling is required for the small degree of IFN-g production by Treg cells during L. monocytogenes infection, we reconstituted Tcrb \u00c0/\u00c0 Tcrd \u00c0/\u00c0 mice with a 1:1 mixture of splenocytes from wildtype and Il12rb2 \u00c0/\u00c0 donors and infected them with L. monocytogenes 10 days later. Indeed, whereas a small fraction of wild-type Treg cells acquired the ability to produce IFN-g after infection, this was blunted in the Il12rb2 \u00c0/\u00c0 Treg cells ( Figure 7C ). Taken together, these data confirm our in vitro findings regarding the ability of Treg cells to respond to IFN-g and IL-12 in an in vivo setting of acute inflammation and indicate that the relative inability of Treg cells to respond to IL-12 limits their functional reprogramming into IFN-g-producing cells.\n\nIn this study, we examined how Treg cells respond to inflammatory cytokines produced during strong Th1 cell responses in vitro and in vivo. We define a mechanism whereby impaired upregulation of IL-12Rb2 causes Treg cells to undergo abortive Th1 cell differentiation driven by activation of STAT1 but not STAT4. This results in the phenotypic and functional specialization of Treg cells via induction of T-bet and prevents them from IL-12-dependent functional reprogramming leading to their acquisition of potentially harmful proinflammatory effector functions.\n\nIncreasing evidence indicates that Treg cells both sense and respond to changes in the immune environment and that this is necessary for proper immunoregulation. For instance, IL-10dependent activation of STAT3 is important for the ability of Treg cells to effectively restrain Th17 cell-mediated inflammatory responses (Chaudhry et al., 2011) . Additionally, Treg cell abundance is tightly linked to the size of the dendritic cell compartment, given that depletion or expansion of dendritic cells in vivo serves to reduce or augment Treg cell numbers, respectively (Darrasse-J\u00e8 ze et al., 2009) . Treg cells are also sensitive to changes in the amount of IL-2 produced by CD4 + Foxp3 \u00c0 CD44 hi T cells, and this is thought to be a mechanism by which Treg cell abundance can be rapidly altered as the number of effector T cells fluctuates (Setoguchi et al., 2005) . Here, we show that Treg cells upregulated expression of the key transcription factor T-bet downstream of STAT1 activation in direct response to IFN-g produced by CD4 + and CD8 + effector T cells. Thus, in addition to controlling Treg cell abundance, cytokines produced by effector T cells can also drive the phenotypic and functional specialization of Treg cells. However, although we demonstrated that T cells are a key source of the IFN-g that acted on Treg cells in vivo, other IFN-g-producing populations, such as NK and NKT cells, may also influence the phenotypic and functional specialization of Treg cells when they are potently activated. Additionally, other STAT1-activating cytokines such as IL-27 or type 1 interferons may also help drive T-bet expression by Treg cells when produced in abundance during parasitic or viral infections.

Prior to analysis, sorted Foxp3 + and Foxp3 \u00c0 naive phenotype cells were activated and cultured for 6 days in the presence of IL-2 and IFN-g, after which they were washed and incubated for 3 days in media containing IL-2 with or without IL-12, as indicated. (B) Flow cytometric analysis of CFSE dilution by labeled CD4 + CD25 \u00c0 effector T cells activated in the presence of the indicated cellular ratios of CD4 + Foxp3 + Treg cells sorted from Foxp3 gfp mice activated in the presence of IFN-g and/or IL-12 as described in ( Although STAT1 activation initiates Th1 cell development, IL-12-dependent STAT4 activation is required for full Th1 cell differentiation. Indeed, STAT4 and T-bet have distinct, yet overlapping functions in establishing the Th1 cell-specific gene expression program. For instance, STAT4 induces the high level of T-bet expression necessary for the terminal differentiation of Th1 effector cells, and activated STAT4 synergizes with T-bet to drive expression of IFN-g (Thieu et al., 2008; Mullen et al., 2001) . Similarly, IL-12 controls the level of T-bet expression in CD8 + effector T cells and dictates whether CD8 + T cells become ''short-lived effector cells'' or long-lived ''memory-precursor effector cells'' (Joshi et al., 2007) . Consistent with their lack of ex vivo IL-12 responsiveness, T-bet + CXCR3 + Treg cells express 5-to 10-fold less T-bet than fully differentiated Th1 cells and do not produce IFN-g (Koch et al., 2009 ). Moreover, we show that they lack expression of other STAT4 regulated genes, and thus we conclude that these Treg cells have undergone a form of incomplete Th1 cell differentiation driven by activation of STAT1 but not STAT4.\n\nDespite being a key checkpoint in Th1 cell development, the molecular control of Il12Rb2 expression is still poorly understood. Although its expression after STAT1 activation is T-bet dependent, it is unclear whether T-bet acts directly on the Il12rb2 locus. Notably, a number of IFN-g activation site (GAS) elements are found upstream of the Il12rb2 coding sequence, indicating that expression of this gene may be directly regulated by STAT1 (Letimier et al., 2007) . Moreover, IL-12-dependent STAT4 activation can feed-forward and enhance Il12rb2 expression (Becskei and Grusby, 2007) . In addition, TCR stimulation alone results in recruitment of the Brg1-containing BAF chromatin remodeling complex to the Il12rb2 locus, which promotes histone hyperacetylation and potentiates STAT-induced Il12rb2 expression (Letimier et al., 2007) . However, the presence of abundant H3K27me3 histone modifications at the Il12rb2 promoter probably acts to temporally delay IL-12Rb2 induction in Treg cells until H3K27 demethylases such as Jumonji 3 can be recruited and remove this chromatin mark (De Santa et al., 2007) . Although Foxp3 is a potent transcriptional repressor, it is not found at or near the Il12rb2 locus (Zheng et al., 2007; Marson et al., 2007) , and deletion of Foxp3 in established Treg cells does not result in Il12rb2 upregulation (Williams and Rudensky, 2007) . In addition, IL-12 can potently induce IFN-g production from TGF-b-induced Treg cells in vitro (Feng et al., 2011) , which are believed to retain a greater degree of phenotypic and functional plasticity than the in vivo-derived natural Treg cells we examined. Thus, repression of Il12rb2 expression appears to be part of the Foxp3-independent program of Treg cell differentiation, and further studies are needed to establish the precise molecular mechanisms that regulate Il12rb2 expression in effector and regulatory T cells.\n\nDuring acute inflammation, cells of the innate immune system transiently produce IL-12 after pathogen recognition, and we showed that delayed induction of IL-12Rb2 prevented Treg cells from sensing and responding to IL-12 during acute L. monocytogenes infection. However, acquisition of IL-12 responsiveness after prolonged STAT1 activation predicts that Treg cells would be more susceptible to functional reprogramming during sustained or dysregulated inflammatory responses. Accordingly, we observed that IL-12 potentiated production of IFN-g and decreased the suppressive function of IFN-g pretreated Treg cells. Moreover, unlike the transient IL-12 production we observed during L. monocytogenes infection, sustained IL-12 production during the lethal intestinal inflammation caused by oral infection with Toxoplasma is associated with functional reprogramming of Treg cells into IFN-g-producing Th1-like cells (Oldenhove et al., 2009) , and IFN-g-producing Treg cells are also found in the CNS during chronic corona-virus-induced encephalomyelitis (Zhao et al., 2011) . Finally, consistent with our results indicating that sustained STAT1 activation renders Treg cells susceptible to IL-12-mediated functional reprogramming, IFN-g production is observed in Treg cells displaying elevated STAT1 activation due to loss of the microRNA miR-146a (Lu et al., 2010) . Thus, although Foxp3 has been reported to inhibit expression of IFN-g by Treg cells (Ono et al., 2007) , IL-12 appears to be sufficient to overcome this blockade, and impaired IL-12Rb2 induction helps limit the functional reprogramming of Treg cells during Th1 cell inflammation. This also provides a molecular mechanism that helps reconcile conflicting data regarding the susceptibility of Treg cells to functional reprogramming in resolving versus chronic inflammatory conditions (Oldenhove et al., 2009; Rubtsov et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2011) .\n\nBy demonstrating that cytokines produced by activated effector T cells can influence the specialization of Treg cells, our data help elucidate how immune homeostasis is maintained after the initiation of robust T cell responses. We also identify the regulated expression of IL-12Rb2 as a key checkpoint that functions to prevent Treg cells from obtaining proinflammatory effector functions and that may contribute to the ''functional plasticity'' of Treg cells observed during uncontrolled inflammation. Further examining how Treg cells respond to specific signals in the immune environment will provide new insights into how Treg cell activity is controlled during different types of immune responses, and is vital for developing and optimizing cellular and molecular therapies aimed at manipulating Treg cell activity in the contexts of autoimmunity, cancer, transplantation, and chronic infection.\n\nMice C57BL/6J, B6.129P2-Tcrb tm1Mom Tcrd tm1Mom /J (Tcrb \u00c0/\u00c0 Tcrd \u00c0/\u00c0 ), B6.129S7-Ifngr1 tm1Agt /J (Ifngr1 \u00c0/\u00c0 ), B6.129S7-Ifng tm1Ts /J (Ifng \u00c0/\u00c0 ), B6.129S1-Il12rb2 tm1Jm /J (Il12rb2 \u00c0/\u00c0 ), B6.Cg-Tg(TcraTcrb)425Cbn/J (OT-II), and B6-Tg(TcraTcrb)1100Mjb/J (OT-I) mice were purchased from the Jackson expression by gated CD4 + Foxp3 + splenic Treg cells from either uninfected mice or at day 7 after L. monocytogenes infection.
