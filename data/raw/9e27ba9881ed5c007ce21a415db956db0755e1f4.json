{"title": "Design, synthesis, antiviral and cytotoxic evaluation of novel acyclic phosphonate nucleotide analogues with a 5,6-dihydro- 1H-[1,2,3]triazolo[4,5-d]pyridazine-4,7-dione system", "body": "In the past two decades acyclic nucleoside phosphonates (ANPs) have become one of the most important classes of antiviral drugs [1] . Three of them (adefovir, cidofovir, tenofovir; Fig. 1 ) have been marketed for treatment of viral infection caused by HIV, HBV, HSV and other DNA viruses [2] [3] [4] [5] . The concept of acyclic nucleosides is based on the assumption that an acyclic moiety most often bearing an oxygen atom mimics the furanose ring at least partially. Acyclic nucleoside phosphonates require conversion in vivo to their triphosphate metabolites to become active [2, 6] . The replacement of the natural phosphate moiety by a phosphonate group makes analogues less susceptible to enzymatic hydrolysis [7, 8] .\n\nFurther studies in this field brought a new generation of nucleotide/nucleoside analogues in which natural nucleobases were modified as exemplified by the 2,4diaminopyrimidine framework present in antiviral HPMPO-DAPy and PMPO-DAPy [9] [10] [11] and the 1,2,4triazole ring in ribavirin (Fig. 2) [12] .\n\nThe antiviral activity of ribavirin stimulated interest in replacing the 1,2,4-triazole system with an isomeric 1,2,3triazole ring because several 1,2,3-triazoles exhibit antibacterial [13] [14] [15] , antifungal [15] [16] [17] , anticancer [18] [19] [20] , anti-inflammatory [21, 22] and antiviral [23] [24] [25] [26] properties. It was found that carbocyclic analogues 1 and phosphonocarbocyclic analogues 2 of ribavirin displayed antiviral activity against HIV-1 (Fig. 3 ) [27] .\n\nFurthermore, preliminary structure-activity relationship evaluation of 1,2,3-triazole nucleoside phosphonates 3 and 4 suggested that this scaffold could be further optimised to afford selective inhibitors of HCV replication (Fig. 4) [28] .\n\nOn the other hand, it was reported that nucleoside analogues 5 and 6 containing the 5,6-dihydro-1H-imidazo [4,5- Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s00706-013-1137-x) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. d]pyridazine-4,7-dione ring instead of the natural purine framework exhibited antiviral activity by inhibition of a viral helicase from West Nile Virus (WNV) and HCV (Fig. 5) . These observations may be useful in designing a lead structure for the development of new classes of antiviral agents [29] .\n\nBased on the active compounds already discussed, a novel series of phosphonate analogues 11 having the 5,6dihydro-1H- [1, 2, 3] triazolo [4,5-d] pyridazine-4,7-dione system was designed as potential antiviral agents (Scheme 1). Furthermore, because their immediate precursor dihydrazides 10 as well as diamides 9 share several common structural features with ribavirin, they also may show antiviral activity. The key step of our synthetic plan involves the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate and x-azidoalkylphosphonates 7 which contain structurally diversified alkyl chains to provide the intermediate diesters 8.\n\nThe 1,2,3-triazoles 8a-8d and 8f were synthesised in 64-98 % yield employing the Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of the corresponding azidophosphonates 7 and dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate at 110\u00b0C in the same way as the known compounds 8e and 8g [30, 31] . They were finally purified either by chromatography on a silica gel column or by crystallisation (Scheme 1).\n\nThe required azidoalkylphosphonates 7a-7e and 7g have already been described in the literature [30, [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] . Azidophosphonate 7f was obtained in the Abramov reaction [37, 38] from 3-azidopropanal [39] and diethyl phosphite in 34 % yield (Scheme 2). It was found that 3-azidopropanal is unstable in the presence of triethylamine used as a catalyst in this reaction. For this reason only 0.4 equiv. of diethyl phosphite was applied to avoid tedious separation of 7f from the reaction mixture.\n\nThe diamides 9a-9g were obtained from diesters 8a-8g by ammonolysis according to a standard protocol (Scheme 1) [6, 40] . The crude products were subjected to column chromatography on silica gel and finally purified Cyclic nucleoside analogues based on the 5,6-dihydro-1Himidazo [4,5-d] pyridazine-4,7-dione framework by crystallisation to give 9a-9g in 37-61 % yields. The 1 H NMR spectra of diamides 9a-9g in chloroform-d confirmed the nonequivalence of protons from the carbamoyl groups because in the 6.0-10.8 ppm region four broad singlets were always observed.\n\nThe diesters 8a-8g were also converted to the corresponding dihydrazides 10a-10g with hydrazine hydrate (Scheme 1). Preliminary attempts at synthesising dihydrazide 10a followed the literature procedure [41] and showed that refluxing phosphonate 8a and hydrazine hydrate in ethanolic solution for 5 h led to the formation of several products. The 31 P NMR spectrum of the reaction mixture revealed the presence of the expected phosphonate 10a (76 %), bicyclic 1,2,3-triazolopyridazinedione 11a (11 %) and their monodealkylated counterparts 12a and 13a (10 and 3 %, respectively) (Fig. 6 ). When hydrazinolysis of the diester 8a was conducted for 2 h only phosphonates 10a (79 %) and 11a (21 %) were produced. For this reason syntheses of dihydrazides 10b-10g were performed under the same conditions. However, it appeared that for compounds 8c and 8g significant dealkylation still occurred. In both cases the respective crude reaction mixtures contained almost 50 % of by-products. Purifications on silica gel columns and crystallisations gave dihydrazides 10a-10g in 28-66 % yields.\n\nFinally, heating dihydrazides 10a-10g with 10 % hydrochloric acid for 2.5 h gave [1, 2, 3] triazolo [4,5-d] pyridazine-4,7-diones 11a-11g (Scheme 1) in 30-66 % yields [41] .\n\nDetailed analyses of 1 H and 13 C NMR spectral data revealed conformational preferences of phosphonates described in this paper. Compounds 8a-11a contain an 1,2substituted ethylene fragment which does not freely rotate around a C-C bond because their 1 H NMR spectra display AA 0 XX 0 P patterns. A similar spectrum was also noticed for 2-azidoethylphosphonate [31] . Antiperiplanar disposition of the diethoxyphosphoryl groups and substituted 1,2,3triazoles 14a (Fig. 7) was proved by the presence of two identical 3 J(P-H X ) = 10.5 Hz couplings which were calculated from the 1 H{ 31 P} NMR spectrum of 8a.\n\nIn the 1 H NMR spectra of compounds 8g, 10g, and 11g three hydrogen atoms attached to the two-carbon linker appeared as deceptively simple but very similar ABXP spectral patterns. However, the relevant 3 J(H1-H2a) and 3 J(H1-H2b) coupling constants were precisely calculated (10.2 and 3.6 Hz, respectively) from the 1 H NMR spectrum of diamide 9g. These values [42] together with small couplings for 3 J(P-H2a) and 3 J(P-H2b) [43, 44] allowed us to unequivocally establish 14g (Fig. 7) as the preferred conformation of phosphonate 9g although other phosphonates from this series very likely adopt the same anti conformation. Large values (16.9-19.2 Hz) of 3 J(P-CC-C3) [44] [45] [46] observed in the 13 C NMR spectra of phosphonates 8-11 containing a three-carbon fragment between the phosphorus atom and the 1,2,3-triazole ring (series b, e, and f) evidenced the preference of antiperiplanar conformations 14b, 14e, and 14f ( Fig. 7) for these compounds. This conclusion was further supported by vicinal H1-H2 couplings calculated for 2-and 1-hydroxyphosphonates (series e and f) which clearly indicated gauche (3.0-3.6 Hz) and anti (9.6-10.8 Hz) arrangements of the respective H-C1C2-H protons.\n\nAlthough values (9.3-12.1 Hz) of 3 J(P-C-O-C) were easily extracted from the 13 C NMR spectra of phosphonates 8-11 (series c) they could not be unequivocally applied in the estimation of the extent to which rotation around the PC-OC bond is hindered because the angular dependence of 3 J(P-C-O-C) has not been established so far. However, the rotation around the OC-CN bond is not restricted because vicinal H 2 C-CH 2 coupling constants observed for phosphonates 8c-11c fall in the 4.8-5. 2 Hz range. On the other hand, on the basis of the values of 3 J(HC-CH) found for PH 2 C-CH 2 O and OH 2 C-CH 2 N units (7.2-7.8 and 5.1-5.7 Hz, respectively), full conformational freedom within a five-atom linker in phosphonates 8-11 (series d) is anticipated.\n\nThe synthesised compounds 9a-9g, 10a-10g, and 11a-11g were evaluated for their antiviral activities against a wide variety of DNA and RNA viruses using the following cell- The antiviral activity was expressed as the EC 50 : the compound concentration required to reduce virus plaques formation (VZV, CMV) by 50 % or to reduce virus-induced cytopathogenicity by 50 % (other viruses). None of the compounds showed appreciable antiviral activity at subtoxic concentrations.\n\nThe cytotoxicity of the tested compounds towards the uninfected host cells was defined as the minimum cytotoxic concentration (MMC) that causes a microscopically detectable alteration of normal cell morphology. The 50 % cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ), i.e. causing a 50 % decrease in cell viability, was determined using a colorimetric 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2Htetrazolium (MTS) assay system. None of the tested compounds affected the cell morphology of Vero, HEL, HeLa or CRFK cells (MCC or CC 50 ) at compound concentrations up to 100 lM. They were also not cytostatic against murine leukemia and human CEM and HeLa cells at 100 lM.\n\nPhosphonylated 1,2,3-triazoles 8a-8g were obtained in good to excellent yields by 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition between x-azidophosphonates 7a-7g and dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate. New series of diamides 9a-9g, dihydrazides 10a-10g and 1,2,3-triazolopyridazinediones 11a-11g were efficiently synthesised as phosphonate analogues of acyclic nucleosides in which nucleobases were replaced by substituted 1,2,3-triazoles. Compounds 8-11 (series a, b, e, f, g) exist in single conformations in which diethoxyphosphoryl and substituted 1,2,3-triazolyl (series a and b) or (1,2,3triazolyl)methyl groups (series e, f, g) prefer the anti orientation.\n\nAll synthesised compounds were evaluated for their antiviral activity against DNA and RNA viruses and were inactive. None of the compounds were cytotoxic (Vero, HEL, HeLa) or cytostatic (L1210, CEM, HeLa) at a concentration up to 100 lM.\n\nThe 1 H NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl 3 , CD 3 OD or D 2 O on the following spectrometers: Varian Mercury-300 and Bruker Avance III (600 MHz) with TMS as an internal standard; chemical shifts d in ppm with respect to TMS; coupling constants J in Hz. The 13 C NMR spectra were recorded for CDCl 3 , CD 3 OD or D 2 O solutions on Varian Mercury-300 and Bruker Avance III (600 MHz) machines at 75.5 and 150.5 MHz, respectively. The 31 P NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl 3 , CD 3 OD or D 2 O on Varian Mercury-300 and Bruker Avance III (600 MHz) spectrometers at 121.5 and 243 MHz, respectively. IR spectra were measured on an Infinity MI-60 FT-IR spectrometer. Melting points were determined on the Boetius apparatus. Elemental analyses were performed by the microanalytical laboratory of the host institution on Perkin Elmer PE 2400 CHNS analyzer and the results were found to be in good agreement (\u00b10.3 %) with the calculated values.\n\nThe following absorbents were used: column chromatography, Merck silica gel 60 (70-230 mesh); analytical TLC, Merck TLC plastic sheets, silica gel 60 F 254 . TLC plates were developed in chloroform-methanol solvent systems. Visualization of spots was effected with iodine vapours. All solvents were dried according to standard literature methods. Synthesis of 1,2,3-triazoles 8a-8g (general procedure) A solution of azidophosphonate 7a-7g (1.00 mmol) and dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate 13 (1.00 mmol) in 4 cm 3 toluene was refluxed for 4 h. The reaction mixtures were concentrated to dryness to leave yellow oils which were purified on silica gel columns with chloroform/methanol (100:1, v/v) or were crystallised to give 1,2,3-triazoles 8a-8g. Synthesis of diamides 9a-9g (general procedure)\n\nTo a solution of the diester 8a-8g (1.00 mmol) in 14 cm 3 ethanol 16 cm 3 was added aqueous ammonia. The reaction mixtures were stirred at room temperature for 24 h. Ethanol and excess ammonia were evaporated in vacuo. Diamides 9a-9g were purified on silica gel columns with chloroform/methanol or by crystallisation. 3,361, 3,259, 3,110, 2,990, 2,959, 2,901, 1,689,  1,613, 1,454, 1,303, 1,219, 1,118, 1,048, 1,019 , 967, 943 cm -1 ; 1 H NMR (CD 3 OD, 600 MHz): d = 1.29 (t, J = 7.1 Hz, 6H, CH 3 CH 2 OP), 3.89 (d, J = 8.5 Hz, 2H, PCH 2 ), 4.06 (t, J = 5.2 Hz, 2H, OCH 2 CH 2 N), 4.06-4.10 (m, 4H, CH 3 CH 2 OP), 5.14 (t, J = 5.2 Hz, 2H, CH 2 N) ppm; 13 \n\nA solution of the diester 8a-8g (0.73 mmol) and 0.530 cm 3 hydrazine hydrate (10.8 mmol) in 6 cm 3 ethanol was refluxed for 2 h. The reaction mixtures were concentrated to give yellow oils or solids which were subjected to chromatography on a silica gel column with chloroform/ methanol or crystallisation to obtain dihydrazides 10a-10g. Synthesis of 1,2,3-triazolopyridazinediones 11a-11g (general procedure)\n\nA mixture of the dihydrazide 10a-10g (0.50 mmol) and 5 cm 3 10 % hydrochloric acid was heated at 90\u00b0C for 2.5 h. After concentration in vacuo, crude products were purified on a silica gel column with chloroform/methanol or crystallised from the appropriate solvent. \n\nThe compounds were evaluated against the following viruses: herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) strain KOS, thymidine kinase-deficient (TK -) HSV-1 KOS strain resistant to ACV (ACV r ), herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) strain G, cytomegalovirus (strains AD-169 and Davis), varicella-zoster virus (VZV) (strains OKA and YS), vaccinia virus Lederle strain, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) strain Long, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), coxsackie b4 virus, parainfluenza 3, influenza virus A (subtypes H1N1, H3N2), influenza virus B, reovirus-1, Sindbis virus and Punta Toro virus. The antiviral assays were based on inhibition of virus-induced cytopathicity or plaque formation in human embryonic lung (HEL) fibroblasts, African green monkey cells (Vero), human epithelial cervix carcinoma cells (HeLa) or MDCK. Confluent cell cultures in microtiter 96-well plates were inoculated with 100 CCID 50 of virus (1 CCID 50 being the virus dose to infect 50 % of the cell cultures) or 20 or 100 plaque forming units (PFU) (for VZV and CMV, respectively) in the presence of varying concentrations of the test compounds. Viral cytopathicity or plaque formation was recorded as soon as it reached completion in the control virus-infected cell cultures that were not treated with the test compounds. Antiviral activity was expressed as the EC 50 or compound concentration required to reduce virus-induced cytopathogenicity or viral plaque formation by 50 %.\n\nInhibition of HIV-1(III B )-and HIV-2(ROD)-induced cytopathicity in CEM cell cultures was measured in microtiter 96-well plates containing 3 9 10 5 CEM cells/ cm 3 infected with 100 CCID50 of HIV per cm 3 and containing appropriate dilutions of the test compounds. After 4-5 days of incubation at 37\u00b0C in a CO 2 -controlled humidified atmosphere, CEM giant cell (syncytium) formation was examined microscopically. The EC 50 (50 % effective concentration) was defined as the compound concentration required to inhibit HIV-induced giant cell formation by 50 %.\n\nAll assays were performed in 96-well microtiter plates. To each well were added (5-7.5) 9 10 4 tumour cells and a given amount of the test compound. The cells were allowed to proliferate for 48 h (murine leukemia L1210 cells) or 72 h (human lymphocytic CEM and human cervix carcinoma HeLa cells) at 37\u00b0C in a humidified CO 2 -controlled atmosphere. At the end of the incubation period, the cells were counted in a Coulter counter. The IC 50 (50 % inhibitory concentration) was defined as the concentration of the compound that inhibited cell proliferation by 50 %."}
