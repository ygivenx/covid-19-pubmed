{"title": "Elevated Temperature Triggers Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus F Protein Six-Helix Bundle Formation NIH Public Access", "body": "Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an enveloped negative-sense ssRNA virus of the pneumovirus group in the paramyxoviridae family (Collins et al., 2001) . RSV is a major cause of pediatric respiratory disease, resulting in severe lower respiratory tract infection in infants, immunocompromised patients, and the elderly (Collins et al., 2001) . There are no effective vaccines available for RSV. Currently approved antiviral therapy for RSV infection is limited to ribavirin, a broad-spectrum antiviral drug with limited efficacy. Prophylactic treatment with the anti-RSV monoclonal antibody, palivizumab, is effective in reducing the severity of disease but is only recommended for high-risk patients (Johnson et al., 1997; Groothuis et al., 1993; Pollack and Groothuis, 2002) . Therefore development of new therapies for the treatment of RSV infection is a high priority.\n\nRSV enters cells by binding to the target cell surface and fusing its envelope with the plasma membrane of the target cell. There are three viral glycoproteins on the envelope surface: the attachment glycoprotein (G), the fusion (F) protein, and the small hydrophobic (SH) protein (Heminway et al., 1994) . However, several lines of evidence indicate that only F, the fusion protein, is both necessary and sufficient for virus entry and cell fusion (Karron et al., 1997; Bukreyev et al., 1997; Kahn et al., 1999; Teecharpornkul et al., 2001) . Thus, the critical role of the F protein in virus entry, along with the fact that F is highly conserved and is a major antigen for neutralizing antibodies, makes it an attractive therapeutic target (Johnson et al., 1987; Eckert et al., 1999; Collins et al., 2001 , Zhao et al., 2000 .\n\nThe RSV F protein is synthesized as a 70 kDa precursor (F0) that is processed by proteolytic cleavage in the trans-Golgi complex to yield two disulphide-linked subunits: F1 and F2 ( Fig.  1A ; Anderson et al., 1982; Collins and Mottet 1991; Collins et al., 1984) . The mature F protein is expressed as a homotrimer on the cell-surface (Calder et al., 2000) . The ectodomain of the F1 transmembrane subunit contains two heptad repeat regions, HR1 and HR2, and an Nterminal fusion peptide (Fig. 1A ) (Collins et al., 2001) . Processing of the F0 precursor has been proposed to generate a \"metastable\" F1/F2 complex (Zhao et al., 2000) . In one proposed model, receptor binding triggers conformational changes in the metastable F protein, resulting in insertion of the N-terminal fusion peptide into the target cell membrane. The HR1 and HR2 heptad repeat regions then interact to form a six-helix bundle structure (Carr et al., 1997; Eckert and Kim, 2001) . According to this model, formation of the six-helix bundle structure facilitates membrane fusion by bringing the viral and cellular membranes into close apposition (Chan and Kim, 1998; Eckert and Kim, 2001; Russell et al., 2001) . The presence of heptad repeat regions that are capable of associating to form a six-helix bundle structure is a feature of several enveloped virus fusion proteins, suggesting a common membrane fusion mechanism (Lamb, 1993; Hernandez et al., 1996; Melikyan et al., 2000; Skehel and Wiley, 2000; Lamb and Kolakofsky, 2001) . In support of this model, peptides corresponding to the RSV F protein HR1 and HR2 regions (N and C peptides, respectively) have been shown to form a six-helix coiledcoil bundle structure, wherein three C peptides pack in an antiparallel fashion into the outer grooves of a central N peptide trimeric coiled-coil ( Fig. 3B ) (Zhao et al., 2000; Matthews et al., 2000; Lawless-Delmedico et al., 2000) . This model is also supported in part by the fact that C peptides are often potent inhibitors of fusion mediated by viral fusion proteins, including the RSV F protein (Lambert et al., 1996; Wang et al., 2003) . In the case of HIV, C peptide inhibitors have been shown to interact with the HR1 region of the HIV gp41 fusion protein during an intermediate stage of conformational change to form a dead-end peptide-gp41 hybrid six-helix bundle structure (Kilgore et al., 2003) . One HIV C peptide inhibitor, enfuvirtide, has been approved for the treatment of HIV infection. Thus, inhibition of viral fusion protein six-helix bundle formation is a validated therapeutic approach for the treatment of viral disease (Wild et al., 1992 (Wild et al., ,1994 Chan and Kim, 1998; Eckert et al., 1999; Zhao et al., 2000) .\n\nThe description of a six-helix bundle structure formed by N and C peptides derived from RSV F protein, along with the fact that RSV C peptides potently inhibit fusion, suggest that RSV F protein undergoes conformation changes during fusion that are analogous to those described in the HIV, SV5, influenza, and related viral systems. Electron microscopy studies of RSV F protein have revealed that trypsin treatment causes a change in conformation from a lollipopshaped structure to a cone-shaped structure, which are thought to represent the native and fusion-active states, respectively (Calder et al., 2000) . However, it has yet to be demonstrated directly that native, membrane-anchored RSV F protein can be triggered to undergo conformational changes leading to the formation of a six-helix bundle structure. Indeed, it is not yet known what triggers these conformational changes. Since, like HIV, RSV fusion takes place at the cell surface and is pH independent (Srinivasakumar et al., 1991; Collins et al., 2001) , it is presumed that binding of F protein to a cellular receptor triggers conformational changes. Although several ligands have been identified that bind to RSV F protein, it remains unclear whether any one of these ligands is a bona fide receptor for RSV (Pastey et al., 2000; Behera et al., 2001; Sano et al., 2003; Hallak et al., 2000) . The lack of a system in which to study native RSV F protein six-helix bundle formation hinders the development of therapeutics targeting F protein conformational changes.\n\nIn the present study, we generated conformation-specific antibodies to recombinant peptide immunogens modeling the RSV F protein six-helix bundle structure. We show that a low level of RSV F protein in the six-helix bundle conformation exists on the surface of RSV-infected cells in a culture that is actively undergoing fusion. We utilized the six-helix-bundle-specific antibodies as probes to characterize potential triggers of F protein conformational change. We determined that elevated temperature serves as an efficient in vitro trigger of F protein conformation change leading to six-helix bundle formation. The implications of these findings for the development of antiviral therapeutics or vaccines targeting the RSV F protein are discussed.\n\nIn order to generate antibodies against RSV 6HB, peptides corresponding to the HR regions of RSV F protein were expressed to generate immunogens that mimic the RSV-F fusion core 6HB structure.\n\nWe first engineered codon-optimized synthetic bacterial expression constructs expressing a linked N and C single-chain peptide (NC), the N peptide, or the C peptide using sequences derived from the work of Zhao et al. (Zhao et al., 2000) (Figure 1 ). In each synthetic cDNA construct, selected nucleotide residues in the HR1 and HR2 coding sequences from wild-type RSV F cDNA (Accession # VGNZA2) were replaced with residues that favor optimal expression in E. coli (Fig. 1B) . The recombinant RSV peptides (N, C, and NC single-chain) were expressed as histidine (His)-tagged fusion peptides in E. coli (Fig 1B) . The His-tag was cleaved off with factor-Xa, the peptides were desalted, lyophilized and resuspended at a concentration of ~0.5 mg/ml in water.\n\nThe linked single-chain NC peptide or a 1:1 mixture of individual N and C peptides (N+C) are hypothesized to form a complex in vitro that mimics the authentic 6HB structure formed due to coiled-coil interactions of RSV-F HR \u03b1-helical domains during the fusion process. The 14amino-acid-long glycine-rich peptide inserted between the N and C domains allows for folding and interaction between the arms of the NC peptide (Fig. 1C) .\n\nThe recombinant RSV peptides were analyzed by SDS-PAGE before and after factor-Xa cleavage to determine their approximate molecular weights. The larger size of the His-tagged peptides is due to the presence of uncleaved TRX, Thrombin, and S-Tags encoded in the pET-32a leader sequence that precedes the engineered IEGR (Factor Xa)-RSV peptides (N, C, and NC) (Fig. 1C) . Factor-Xa enzyme-mediated cleavage of the His-tagged peptides releases free-N, C, or NC peptide, respectively ( Fig 1C) . The predicted molecular weights of the N (57aa), C (45aa), and NC (116 aa) peptides based on their amino acid (aa) sequences were 6.13, 5.11, and 12.21 kDa, respectively (Fig. 1C) . The migration pattern of the RSV peptides relative to a 36-amino-acid (4.5 kDa) control peptide (DP-178) and molecular weight markers coincided well with their predicted molecular weights (compare Fig 2A with Fig 1C) .\n\nTo determine whether antibodies to RSV could recognize the recombinant peptides, an immunoblot of the recombinant peptides was probed using RSV neutralizing polyclonal serum. The \u03b1RSV polyclonal serum recognized the N and NC peptides thus confirming that these peptides contained authentic F protein epitopes (Fig. 2B) . Surprisingly, the C peptide did not appear to react with \u03b1RSV serum; only faint background bands were seen, likely attributed to cross-reactivity with contaminating bacterial proteins. One possible explanation for this observation is the presence of a conserved N-linked glycosylation site (aa: 500 NQS 502 ) within the HR2 (C-peptide region) domain in the Fusion protein (Figs. 1A and 1C, Collins et al., 2001 ,Zimmer et al., 2001 . Perhaps the presence of the carbohydrate side chain makes this region poorly antigenic. Alternatively, the HR2-C region may be buried within the native, untriggered RSV F protein oligomer and inaccessible to circulating antibodies. Studies of soluble F proteins suggest that this latter explanation is unlikely, since the HR2 region is proposed to form a stalk structure in the pre-fusion state (Lamb and Jardetzky, 2007) .\n\nThe C (HR2) and N (HR1) peptides have been reported to potently inhibit RSV fusion and infection (Lambert et al 1994; Gao et al. 2003) . To determine whether the peptides that we generated had antiviral activity, we tested each peptide (N, C, NC, or an N+C mixture) for its ability to inhibit RSV infection and syncytia formation in vitro in a dose-response assay. Consistent with previous observations (Lambert et al., 1996; Wang et al., 2003) , both the N and C peptides were found to inhibit RSV infection (data not shown). Also consistent with previous reports, the C peptide was found to be more potent than the N peptide (IC 50 = 8.0 \u03bcg/ml [1.6 \u03bcM] and 62.5 \u03bcg/ml [10.2 \u03bcM], respectively). The existence of a prehairpin intermediate conformation for RSV F1 is strongly supported by our observation and by others that RSV infection can be potently inhibited by HR-C peptides (Lambert et al., 1996; Wang et al., 2003) .\n\nWe further found that the linked peptide NC did not exhibit any noticeable antiviral activity (data not shown). Similarly, mixing N-and C-peptides together in equimolar ratio (N+C) resulted in the loss of antiviral activity of either peptide, presumably due to 6HB-like structure formation (data not shown). Circular Dichroism reveals that the RSV peptide NC or an equimolar mixture of N and C peptides (N+C) assumes a helicity characteristic of a six-helix bundle structure Circular dichroism (CD) was performed to determine whether the peptides NC or N+C have the solution structures similar to those predicted for the RSV fusion core from previous studies Wild et al., 1992) . We therefore analyzed the helicity of the NC peptide (or a 1:1 mixture of N and C, [N+C] ). The CD spectra for a 10\u03bcM sample of peptide NC in PBS at 4 \u00b0C, displayed a double minima at 222 and 208nm that is characteristic of the high degree of \u03b1-helical secondary structure found in the 6HB complex ( Fig 2C) . The mean molar elipticity value of \u221227,000 at 222nm indicates that under the conditions of the experiment the protein is ~85% helical. Similar results were obtained with a 1:1 mixture of the individual N-and C-peptide constructs (data not shown). These data indicate that the complex formed by the recombinant RSV peptides, NC or N+C, models the 6HB structure in a manner similar to peptides utilized in previous studies (Lawless-Delmedico et al., 2000; , Zhao et al., 2000 .\n\nPeptide ELISA demonstrates that the antibodies generated against recombinant peptide complexes are specific for 6HB epitopes\n\nHaving established that these peptides possess the characteristics of a 6HB structure, the recombinant peptide complexes NC or N+C were used as immunogens to raise antibodies that would recognize the 6HB epitope generated during the RSV F-mediated fusion process. Three guinea pigs were immunized with each immunogen (NC or N+C mixed peptides). We have used this approach previously to generate antibodies against the HIV gp41 6HB structure that forms following triggering with CD4 (deRosny et al., Furuta et al., 1998) .\n\nA peptide-based indirect ELISA was used for initial characterization of the antiserum. The peptides NC or N+C were highly immunogenic and yielded relatively high-titer antiserum ( Fig  3A) , which we designated as \u03b1-NC or \u03b1-N+C. The antibody responses were directed primarily against peptide complexes NC or N+C rather than individual peptides N or C (Fig. 3B ). Furthermore the reactivity of antiserum \u03b1-NC (or \u03b1-N+C) to peptides NC or N+C could be completely adsorbed out by either immunogens (NC or N+C) but not by free peptides N or C ( Fig 3C) . These observations demonstrate that \u03b1-NC antibodies predominantly recognize 6HBspecific epitopes. The \u03b1NC or \u03b1-N+C antiserum did not react with a peptide complex corresponding to HIV 6HB (P15+P16) indicating its specificity to RSV 6HB (data not shown). Our results are also supported by findings in the HIV system, wherein a polyclonal 6HBspecific antiserum displayed similar specificity to a gp41 6HB peptide complex (deRosny et al., 2001). Collectively, these results demonstrate that the antiserum generated against the NC or N+C peptides was predominantly complex-specific and therefore suitable to probe for RSV-F 6HB structure. Since the \u03b1NC antibodies displayed a higher titer ( Fig 3A) as well as lower cross reactivity to free peptides N or C (Fig 3B) , this antiserum (84F = \u03b1NC; Fig 3A) was used for further characterization.\n\nThe antiserum \u03b1NC (or \u03b1N+C), when used to probe lysate strips prepared from RSV infected cells, reacted to protein with molecular weight ~48-50 kDa (F1 subunit) predominantly and to an ~70 kDa (F0) protein (Fig 4A) , suggesting that these antisera recognized epitopes in the RSV F protein.\n\nIn immunoprecipitation (IP) experiments, the \u03b1NC (or \u03b1N+C) antiserum immunoprecipitated F1 subunit from RSV-infected cell lysate, but no F0 form whatsoever was observed (Fig.4B ). These results are consistent with the \u03b1NC antibody epitopes being located in the F1 subunit (Fig. 4) . The lack of binding to F0 was interesting, since studies of soluble hPIV3 F protein suggest that cleavage of the F precursor is not required for adoption of a post-fusion conformation (Lamb and Jardetzky, 2007) . It may be that the requirements for 6HB formation differ between soluble and native, membrane-bound F proteins (Ruiz-Arguello et al., Yin et al., 2005 Yin et al., ,2006 . Conversely, the reactivity of the \u03b1NC antibody to the F0 form of RSV F protein in the western blot ( Fig 4A) could either be non-specific or result from small amounts of antibodies against uncomplexed N and C components that bind to denatured F0 (and, potentially, F1). Collectively, the above findings, along with the results of the peptide ELISA, strongly suggest that the F1 epitope recognized by the \u03b1NC antiserum is the RSV 6HB structure ( Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 ).\n\nWe next employed cell-surface immunoprecipitation to determine if 6HB epitopes could be found on the surface of RSV-infected cells that are actively undergoing cell fusion. Using the \u03b1NC serum, F1 subunit was immunoprecipitated from the surface of RSV infected cells ( Fig  5B) . In order to determine if the F1 being immunoprecipitated from the cell-surface was indeed a 6HB conformation of F1, we adsorbed the \u03b1NC antiserum with peptides N, C, NC, or N+C, respectively, and used this serum in cell-surface IP experiments. Our results show that adsorption of the antiserum with NC (or N+C; data not shown) peptides that mimic the RSV F 6HB structure completely abolished the capacity of \u03b1NC antiserum to immunoprecipitate F1 protein. Whereas, adsorption with peptides N or C alone did not prevent F1 binding (Fig. 5B ).\n\nThe peptide-adsorption cell-surface IP results, along with peptide-ELISA binding data, demonstrate that \u03b1-NC antibodies are conformation-specific for 6HB epitopes and, therefore, can be used to detect the final conformation state of the RSV F protein. Our results provide proof-of-concept that, starting with synthetic-peptide immunogens that mimic the RSV F 6HB structure, it is possible to generate antibodies that specifically bind the 6HB epitopes being created on the surface of RSV-infected cells undergoing fusion.\n\nUsing flow cytometry, the staining of RSV-infected cells with \u03b1NC antiserum detected the presence of a low level of F protein in the 6HB conformation on the cell-surface ( Fig 6A) . The mean fluorescence due to antibody binding to 6HB epitopes was significantly lower in comparison with the total F protein detected using an \u03b1-F monoclonal antibody (Fig. 6B) . These data generated using flow cytometry correlated well with cell-surface IP results and suggested that a low level of F protein 6HB exists on the surface of RSV-infected cells.\n\nUsing flow cytometry, we rapidly ruled out the possibility that the following conditions / reagents would trigger a conformation change in cell-surface expressed RSV F into its fusion active six-helix bundle formation: 1) addition of reported F-interacting proteins such as RhoA or ICAM-1 or glycosaminoglycans (such as heparin, heparan sulphate, dextran sulphate or Chondroitin B); 2) human or bovine lactoferrin, reported to interact with G or F glycoprotein; 3) exposure to different pH (3.2-11.0) or trypsin or disulphide bond reducing agents (\u03b2-Mercaptoethanol or dTT) or denaturing agent (SDS) (data not shown).\n\nPrevious work using a soluble form of the F protein from parainfluenza virus type 5 (PIV5) demonstrated an effect of temperature on the conformational state of the protein (Connolly et al., 2006) . To determine if elevated temperature could trigger 6HB formation in native RSV F protein, we incubated RSV-infected cells for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C or 37 \u00b0C or a range of temperature from 37 \u00b0C to 65 \u00b0C prior to staining with 6HB antibody. Following incubation at temperatures between 45 \u00b0C -55 \u00b0C, a specific increase in staining of RSV-infected cells, but not uninfected control cells, was observed ( Fig. 7A and data not shown). Repeated testing of the effects of temperature on triggering during a 5 min incubation using a thermocycler revealed that triggering reaches a plateau between 50 \u00b0C and 55 \u00b0C (Fig. 7A ). At 55 \u00b0C the level of staining by 6HB-specific antibody was almost equivalent to that observed with an anti-F monoclonal antibody positive control (data not shown), suggesting that a large proportion of the total population of F protein expressed on the cell surface was triggered under these conditions. In order to identify the optimal time for triggering RSV infected Vero cells were incubated at 55 \u00b0C for various lengths of time up to an hour prior to staining. Exposure to 55 \u00b0C for a 15 min duration resulted in the most dramatic/rapid increase in triggering (Fig. 7B ). Only small and gradual increases in triggering were observed beyond 15 min exposure up to 45 minutes, and then this effect subsided. These data, along with the results of 5-min temperature-course experiments (Fig. 7A ), demonstrated that a short incubation of 5-15 minutes at 50 -55 \u00b0C was sufficient to trigger optimal 6HB formation on the surface of RSV-infected cells.\n\nTriggering was compared for four different cell lines: Vero, Hep2, HeLa and Hela-S3. The results demonstrated that the best combination of F expression and triggering signal-to-noise was observed with Vero cells (data not shown).\n\nIn order to confirm that the 55 \u00b0C incubation was not having deleterious effects on cellmembranes, RSV-infected Vero cells treated at 55 \u00b0C for \u00bd hour were stained with antibodies that recognize two intracellular constituents: 1) Rho A (found on the intracellular face of the plasma membrane) or 2) the Golgi-complex (Sigma Golgi-specific antibody #2404). We observed that flow cytometry staining to RhoA or the Golgi-complex was dramatically increased in uninfected Vero cells following treatment with detergent-containing buffer (Perm 2, BD Biosciences); whereas, no increase was observed following incubation at 55 \u00b0C for \u00bd hr in the absence of detergent (data not shown). These results demonstrated that significant cell-permeabilization was not occurring at 55 \u00b0C, and the triggering detected at that temperature was, instead, due to 6HB formation in cell-surface expressed F protein. The specificity of the staining following a 55 \u00b0C trigger was further confirmed in experiments which showed that no significant staining above background was observed following adsorption of antibodies to 6HB complexes in an N+C peptide mixture (Fig 7C) .\n\nA cell-surface immunoprecipitation experiment was performed in which 6HB-specific \u03b1NC antiserum was incubated with RSV-infected cells at increasing temperatures for 15 min. Following this triggering step, unbound antibody was washed away, and the immune complexes were then immunoprecipitated. As is shown in Fig. 8A , the amount of RSV F protein on the cell surface that was recognized by \u03b1NC antiserum was significantly increased at temperatures above 37\u00b0 C, with the highest level being pulled down at 50-55\u00b0 C. These results were consistent with the results presented in Fig. 7 from flow cytometry experiments and confirmed that the increased antibody binding detected at elevated temperature was specific for the RSV F protein.\n\nTo confirm the specificity of the antibody binding to the six-helix bundle conformation of RSV F following temperature triggering, a cell-surface IP experiment was performed in which 6HBspecific NC antiserum was pre-incubated with either the N, C, or NC single-chain peptide or a mixture of the N and C peptides (N+C) prior to incubation with RSV-infected cells at 55\u00b0 C for 15 min. As is shown in Fig.8B , virtually all of the reactivity of the NC antiserum for temperature-triggered RSV F protein was adsorbed out by the NC single-chain 6HB peptide or an equimolar mixture of N+C peptide complexes; whereas, the N or C peptide alone failed to adsorb out all of the antibodies. These results confirm that elevated temperature triggers RSV F protein 6HB formation on the surface of infected cells.\n\nIn this study, we describe the generation of reagents and identification of a system that permits the study of 6HB formation directly in native, membrane-anchored F protein expressed on the surface of RSV-infected cells. Using conformation-specific antibodies to the RSV F 6HB structure, we directly demonstrate that elevated temperature is an efficient trigger of F protein conformational change. The flow cytometry-based assay described in this report is an attractive starting point for the development of novel strategies for discovery of RSV fusion inhibitors. We have previously used a similar approach successfully to study HIV-1 gp41 6HB formation following triggering with CD4 and to identify small molecule inhibitors of HIV-1 fusion (Salzwedel et al., unpublished results, Furuta et al., 1998; deRosny et al., 2001) .\n\nThe physiologic trigger(s) that activate conformational changes in RSV F are not known. The activation of most paramyxovirus F proteins at neutral pH is triggered by a three-step process including 1) binding of a viral receptor-binding protein such as HN or H to its cellular receptor; 2) interaction of HN with F, and 3) conformational changes in F that mediate membrane fusion In the case of HIV, the fusion protein, gp41, is triggered by binding of its associated subunit (gp120) to CD4 receptor on the target cell surface (Hernandez et al., 1996) . Since, like HIV, RSV fusion takes place at the cell surface and is pH independent (Collins et al., 2001) , it is likely that F protein also interacts with a cell-surface receptor, although such a receptor has not yet been identified. We could not test hydrostatic pressure for its reported effect to induce fusion active state due to the need for specialized equipment (Gaspar et al., 2002) . Similarly we could not test urea or guanidine HCl in our system due to their deleterious effect on cells ( A few early studies discovered that the low pH triggering effect for influenza hemagglutinin (HA) could be substituted by elevated temperature in the range of 58-62 \u00b0C (Wharton, 1986; Haywood and Boyer, 1986; Ruigrok, 1987) . The heat-triggered conformational change in HA coincided with the formation of a fusogenic 6HB conformation that is biochemically indistinguishable from the low pH-triggered conformation (Carr et al., 1997) . These studies suggested to us that elevated temperature could potentially serve as a trigger for RSV F protein.\n\nUsing the \u03b1NC antibody as a probe, we observed in flow cytometry and cell-surface IP experiments that exposure of RSV infected cells to a temperature of 45-55 \u00b0C for 5-15 min was sufficient to cause a 3-5-fold increase in the formation of 6HB conformation of F (Figs. 7B and 7C). We concluded that elevated temperature could serve as an efficient in vitro trigger of 6HB formation in RSV-F.\n\nOne caveat of this study is that we cannot completely rule out the possibility that the \u03b1-NC antibodies may recognize a conformation of the HR2 domain that is not represented by the free C peptide. Such an epitope could potentially be unmasked by partial denaturation during incubation at elevated temperature and may not faithfully represent a conformation of the F protein that is related to authentic conformational changes. Alternatively, it is possible that the antibodies may detect an intermediate conformation of the F protein rather than the post-fusion 6HB structure. However, we consider these scenarios to be unlikely given the results obtained. The authors demonstrated that this form of the protein could be triggered to undergo conformational change to its more stable post-fusion state by heating to 50 \u00b0C (range: 45 \u00b0C -60 \u00b0C). Upon triggering at 50 \u00b0C, PIV5-F GCNt associated with liposome membranes, formed rosettes, and lost or gained reactivity to conformation-specific antibodies that were predicted to recognize pre-or post-fusion conformational states, respectively. A change in the shape of the soluble protein from a prefusion \"ball-and-stem\" to a more elongated post-fusion \"golf-tee\" shape was also observed by electron microscopy (Connolly et al., 2006) . Thus, our findings that elevated temperature serves as a surrogate trigger of RSV F conformational changes is consistent with previous studies of F protein conformational change in other paramyxovirus systems (Lamb and Jardetzky, 2007) .\n\nStudy of the process of conformation change in fusion proteins from a diverse group of enveloped viruses including SV5, Influenza HA and HIV have lead to the development of a 'spring-loaded trap' model (Carr, 1993; Russell, 2003) . In this model it is suggested that the non-fusogenic neutral pH conformation of viral fusion glycoproteins (vFGps), including the native F1-F2 complex in paramyxoviruses such as RSV, exist in a kinetically trapped highenergy state, and that energy is released as a result of conformation change in the protein. In agreement with the spring-trap model, at neutral pH, heat, urea, or pressure can 'loosen' the native non-fusogenic form, causing it to transition spontaneously into a fusogenic form, suggesting that the native state of vFGps is 'metastable' (Carr et al., 1993 (Carr et al., , 1997 Paterson et al., 2000; Wharton et al., 2000; Gaspar et al., 2000; Epand et al., 2002) . These studies also propose that physiological triggers such as pH change or receptor binding fulfill a common energy requirement for performing the work of membrane fusion that could be satisfied directly by an increase in temperature or other destabilizing force such as urea or pressure (Patterson et al., 2000; Wharton et al., 1986 Wharton et al., ,2000 Carr et al., 1997; Haywood et al., 1986; Ruigrok et al., 1987; Epand et al., 2002; Seth et al., 2003) . The energy released during the 6HB formation is used to perform the work of membrane fusion (Melikyan et al., 2000) . Our demonstration here that heat can trigger the formation of the 6HB structure in the RSV fusion protein is consistent with the native state of RSV F protein existing in a metastable state. Our findings, therefore, extend the metastability hypothesis to RSV, a member of the pneumovirus genus in the family Paramyxoviridae.\n\nThe assay system described in this report has potential applications in the testing of future RSV receptor candidates by measuring their triggering effect on F protein conformational change. Similarly, this approach could be used to further study the requirements for 6HB formation in native RSV F. For example: Do RSV G or SH proteins have any influence on this effect? Does F0 undergo the same conformational change as cleaved F1? The thermal triggering approach could also be adapted to study the conformational changes of fusion proteins from other viruses for which receptors have yet to be identified. The triggering event and the conformational changes in the RSV F protein leading to 6HB formation are attractive antiviral targets, since disruption of these key steps can prevent F protein mediated membrane fusion. For treating HIV infection, a C peptide inhibitor (enfuvirtide; T-20) has been approved that targets the HIV gp41 fusion protein during an intermediate stage of conformational change to form a dead-end peptide-gp41 hybrid six-helix bundle structure (Wild et al., 1994; Kilgore et al., 2003; Matthews et al., 2004) . Thus, inhibition of viral fusion protein six-helix bundle formation is a validated therapeutic approach for the treatment of viral disease. The RSV 6HB antibody probe and temperature triggering technique that we describe could be applied towards the development of high-throughput drug screening assays to identify small molecule drugs that specifically block the conformation changes in the fusion protein. Proof-of-concept for this idea has been provided by the identification of an influenza virus fusion inhibitor capable of blocking temperature-induced 6HB formation in influenza virus HA (Yoshimoto et al., 1999) .\n\nVero cells and the A2 strain of human RSV were obtained from the ATCC. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum containing antibiotics. Virus was propagated and titrated in Vero cells. The following antibodies were used: anti-RSV polyclonal antibodies (B65860G, Biodesign), anti-F protein mAb (RSV3216, Serotec), anti-F protein mAb (858-1, Chemicon), anti-G protein mAb (858-2, Chemicon), anti-RhoA mAb (26C4, sc-418, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Golgi mAb (G-2404, Sigma), donkey antigoat IgG-HRP (AP180P, Chemicon).\n\nSynthetic genes encoding the heptad repeat regions, HR1 (N) and HR2 (C), of RSV F protein (A2 strain; accession number VGNZA2) were designed based on the work of Zhao et al. (Zhao et al., 2000) and codon optimized for optimal expression in Escherichia coli (Fig. 1) . A cDNA construct (HR1/HR2) encoding both heptad repeat regions, HR1 (amino acid residues 153-209 of RSV F) and HR2 (amino acid residues 476-520 of RSV F), linked via a glycine-rich linker was generated (Fig 1, B and C) . Briefly, a series of overlapping complementary oligonucleotides spanning the entire length of either the N or C coding sequence was designed. The codons within the oligo sequences were biased for optimal expression in E. coli (Fig. 1B) . The oligos were annealed and extended in the appropriate order in successive PCR reactions to form two complete double-stranded DNAs encoding either N peptide (HR1) or C peptide (HR2). The resulting HR1 or HR2 PCR products were then re-amplified in a final PCR reaction using an upstream primer encoding a Bam HI-factor-Xa cleavage sequence (residues IEGR) at the 5' end and a reverse primer encoding the restriction site Hind III at the 3' end. The final PCR product from each reaction was cloned into the Bam HI-Hind III sites of the pET32a bacterial expression vector (Novagen) to generate the cDNAs HR1 or HR2, respectively. The linked HR1/HR2 cDNA (Fig 1B) was constructed by first amplifying the individual cDNA fragments, HR1 and HR2, in separate PCR reactions using complementary, overlapping primers that encoded each half of the intervening linker sequence, as well as a unique Kpn I site at their 5' ends. The resulting PCR fragments encoding HR1 or HR2 were then ligated together at their Kpn I site to yield a fragment encoding both HR1 and HR2, joined via a glycinerich linker (NC; Fig. 1C ). The ligated HR1/HR2 was amplified once more in a PCR reaction using a primer encoding the 5' end of HR1 and a primer encoding the 3' end of HR2. The final product was cloned via Bam HI-Hind III into the pET32a vector to yield the HR1/HR2 cDNA that encoded the single-chain NC peptide (Fig. 1, B and C) . The constructs HR1, HR2, and HR1/HR2 were sequenced in their entirety. The hexahistidine tag encoded in the pET32a vector allowed for histidine affinity purification of the fusion peptide.\n\nThe recombinant RSV peptides were expressed as histidine-tagged fusion proteins in E coli ( Fig. 1 , B, C and Fig. 2A) . The plasmids HR1, HR2, or HR1/HR2 were transformed into E.coli strain pLysS (Novagen) for protein expression. Individual colonies of transformed bacteria were inoculated into Luria-Bertani (LB) broth and grown to an optical density of 0.6 at 600 nm. Protein expression was induced with 1 mM isopropyl-\u03b2-D-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 hr. The cells were harvested by pelleting in a centrifuge. The cell pellet was lysed with Benzonase reagent (Novagen), and lysate was clarified by centrifugation. The histidine-tagged fusion proteins in the lysates were captured on Ni +2 affinity columns. The eluted histidine-tagged fusion proteins were dialyzed against factor-Xa cleavage buffer (50mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0]-100mM NaCl-2mM CaCl 2 ) in order to set up factor-Xa digestion. The fusion proteins were digested with factor-Xa (1:500 wt/wt ratio of protease:tagged protein) for 24h at room temperature to remove the leader peptide and histidine tag residues. The leader peptidehistidine tag was removed from the cleavage mixture by passing the mixture over a Ni +2 affinity column; the flow-through contained the RSV peptides (N, C, or NC) (Fig. 2A) . The N and NC peptides were further desalted by passing through PD-10 Sephadex columns. The peptides were lyophilized and resuspended in ultra pure water. The RSV peptides (N, C, or NC) were each adjusted to 0.5 mg/ml final concentration.\n\nPurified N, C, or NC peptides, along with their histidine-tagged forms, were separated by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) using 12% polyacrylamide Bis-Tris Novex gels (Invitrogen) alongside Multimark molecular weight marker and a commercially synthesized peptide of known molecular weight (~4.5 kDa). The proteins were detected by Coomassie blue staining.\n\nIn order to ascertain if the synthetic peptides could be recognized by anti-RSV (\u03b1RSV) antibodies, the purified N, C, or NC peptides were separated by SDS-PAGE as above, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with goat \u03b1RSV polyclonal serum. Antibody binding was detected using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat secondary antibody and the ECL chemiluminescent detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).\n\nThe N, C, and NC peptides or a 1:1 equimolar mixture of N and C peptides (N+C) was tested in a dose-response assay for their ability to inhibit RSV-mediated cell fusion and infection in vitro using a modification of an RSV microneutralization assay (Johnson 1997) . Briefly, 100 TCID 50 of RSV was mixed with various concentrations of each RSV peptide. After a 1-hr preincubation at room temperature, the peptide/virus mixture was added to a Vero cell monolayer in a 96-well plate (2 \u00d7 10 4 cells/well). The plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 5 days and then scored visually for inhibition of virus-mediated cell killing.\n\nCD measurements were obtained with an Aviv Associates model 202 spectropolarimeter calibrated with a standard solution of 10-camphorsulfonic acid as per Wild et al., (1992) . Samples contained 10-50 \u03bcM total concentration of peptide (either NC or the N+C peptide mixture) in 0.1 M NaCl / 10 mM potassium phosphate, adjusted to pH 7.0. Spectra was collected at 1 \u00b0C with 1.5 mM bandwidth, a 0.5 nm step size, and a 2.0-sec time constant in either 1-or 10-mm-path-length cells. Blank-corrected data was smoothed with a third-order polynomial function. A thermoelectric cell holder accurate to within 1 \u00b0C regulated sample temperature.\n\nTo generate antibodies against the RSV F protein 6HB structure, two groups of 3 guinea pigs were immunized with either the single-chain peptide, NC, or an equimolar (1:1) mixture of the N and C peptides, N+C. All of the animals were primed subcutaneously with 200 \u03bcg of total peptide in complete Freund's adjuvant and boosted three times with 100 \u03bcg peptide in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. The pre-immunization (PI) sera and final bleeds postimmunization were stored at -20 \u00b0C.\n\nAn indirect ELISA was established to determine the reactivity of anti-NC (\u03b1NC) or anti-N+C (\u03b1N+C) antiserum to RSV peptides (N, C, NC, and the N+C mixture). 96-well Immulon-2 plates (VWR cat. # 62402-972) were coated with 100 ng/well of each peptide antigen. After blocking with 1% BSA, serum samples were added in duplicate and allowed to incubate for 2 hr at 37 \u00b0C. After incubation, the plates were washed in PBS-0.05% Tween-20 and a phosphatase-labeled anti-guinea pig secondary antibody was added at a 1:5000 dilution. After a 1-hr incubation at room temperature with the secondary antibody, substrate (fast pnitrophenyl phosphate, Sigma) was added, and absorbance was detected at 405 nm in a plate reader.\n\nImmunoblot strips prepared from RSV-infected cell-lysate were probed with \u03b1NC or \u03b1N+C antiserum. Briefly, a lysate was prepared from RSV-infected Vero cells. RSV proteins in the lysate were separated by SDS-PAGE (12%). The proteins were then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and strips were prepared for probing individually with different antibodies to RSV proteins. The RSV lysate strips were probed with \u03b1N+C or \u03b1NC serum at a dilution of 1:500 in 5% milk-PBS. The strip-blots were probed with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, followed by detection using the ECL chemiluminescent detection system.\n\nThe \u03b1NC and \u03b1N+C antisera were tested for their ability to immunoprecipitate RSV proteins from the lysates of RSV-infected cells. RSV-infected Vero cells were lysed in 0.2 ml lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40-150mM NaCl-100mM Tris [pH 8.0]) and clarified by centrifugation at 13000 rpm for 20 minutes. 2 \u03bcl of \u03b1NC or \u03b1N+C antiserum was added to clarified lysate and incubated for 1 hr at 4 \u00b0C. Protein G agarose beads (Invitrogen) were then added and incubated for 1 hr at 4 \u00b0C. The antigen-antibody-bead complexes were washed five times in wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 300mM NaCl-0.5% IGEPAL, 50mM Tris [pH 7.5]) and resuspended in protein-loading buffer (Invitrogen). The immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (10%). The proteins were then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, the membrane was blocked in blocking buffer (5% milk-PBS) and probed with a \u03b1-RSV polyclonal antibody (Biodesign International cat. # B65860G) at a 1:500 dilution in blocking buffer. The blots were washed and probed with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-goat secondary antibody (Chemicon International cat. # AP180P) at a dilution of 1:10,000 in blocking buffer. The blots were washed again and the proteins were detected by chemiluminescence using the ECL chemiluminescent detection system.\n\nCell-surface immunoprecipitation (IP) was used to selectively immunoprecipitate the fusion protein expressed on the cell-surface of RSV infected Vero cells. Vero cells were infected with RSV at 0.03-0.05 MOI. 48h post infection RSV infected Vero monolayer was washed three times with PBS and resuspended into a single-cell suspension using enzyme-free celldissociation buffer (Invitrogen). The cells were pelleted and resuspended in stain/wash buffer (SWB: PBS containing 1% BSA-0.1% NaN 3 ) at a concentration of 2 \u00d7 10 7 cells/ml. 100 \u03bcl of cell suspension (2 \u00d7 10 6 cells) was used for each cell-surface IP. 2 \u03bcl of primary antibody, \u03b1NC or \u03b1-F monoclonal (Chemicon International # MAB858-1) was used in each IP. The antibody-cell mixture was incubated for 1h at 4 \u00b0C. Following this, the cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed in 0.2 ml lysis buffer. The clarified lysate was then processed and analyzed as described in lysate-IP experiment. The immunoprecipitated proteins were separated using SDS-PAGE (10%) and immunoblotting was performed as for the lysate IP described above.\n\nIn temperature triggering cell-surface IP experiments, a master mix was prepared wherein \u03b1NC antibody was added at the concentration of 2.0 \u03bcl /100 \u03bcl of RSV infected Vero cells (2 \u00d7 10 6 cells) resuspended in SWB. After thorough mixing, 100 \u03bcl aliquots were distributed into 0.5 ml PCR tubes for heat treatment in a thermocycler. The cells were exposed to elevated temperature in the range of 4 \u00b0C -55\u00b0C (or the indicated temperature) for 5-15 min (or the indicated time period). Following temperature treatment, all subsequent steps of the cellsurface IP and immunoblotting were performed as described above.\n\nAntibody staining and flow cytometry analysis was used to determine the level of F protein 6HB present on the surface of RSV-infected cells. RSV infected Vero cells were resuspended in stain/wash buffer at a concentration of 2 \u00d7 10 7 cells/ml. 50 \u03bcl (1 \u00d7 10 6 cells) of the cellsuspension was used for flow cytometry. A 1:50 dilution (2.0 \u03bcl) of \u03b1NC or control monoclonal antibodies \u03b1F or \u03b1G were used as primary antibodies for each flow cytometry sample. The cells were incubated with antiserum for 1 hr at 4 \u00b0C and then washed twice in stain/wash buffer. A secondary antibody, FITC-labeled \u03b1-guinea pig antibody at a final concentration of 1 \u03bcg/ml in stain/wash buffer was added to each sample and incubated for 45 min at 4 \u00b0C. The cells were washed twice and then resuspended in stain/wash buffer and analyzed using a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur flow cytometer and CellQuest software.\n\nFlow cytometry in the above format was used as a screening assay to search for potential trigger of RSV 6HB formation. We tested a wide variety of ligands and conditions such as recombinant Gallina et al., 2002 ). We exposed RSV infected Vero cells to elevated temperature (above 37 \u00b0C up to 65 \u00b0C) for varying time period in course of identifying temperature as a trigger of 6HB formation of RSV F protein The integrity of the cells following triggering at 55 \u00b0C was further confirmed using control antibodies to intracellular proteins Rho A or Golgi complex. In order to compare the level of staining obtained at 55\u00b0C with that obtained following a true-cell membrane permeabilization effect, we used a cell-permeabilization buffer (Perm2 FACS-permeabilizing solution 2, Becton Dickinson) to permeabilize the cells prior to flow cytometry staining. 2 \u00d7 10 7 RSV infected Vero cells/ml or uninfected Vero cells were treated with 1\u00d7 Perm 2 buffer as per manufacturer's recommendation. Briefly, the cells were exposed to 1\u00d7 Perm 2 solution prepared in water for \u00bd hr, followed by 2 washes in stain/wash buffer and resuspended back into original cellconcentration (i.e., 2 \u00d7 10 7 cells/ml). A 50 \u03bcl (= 1\u00d710 6 cells) aliquot of cells was used in each flow cytometry experiment as above. The staining to cellular protein 'RhoA' or a cell-organelle 'Golgi complex' was determined with monoclonal antibodies \u03b1-RhoA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. # SC418) or \u03b1-Golgi, (Sigma #2404), respectively. HR2 (or C region), the fusion peptide (FP), and the transmembrane domain (TM). In the F2 subunit, the location of an additional predicted heptad repeat, HR3 is shown. Cleavage sites designate the location of furin cleavage sites in F2 and the F2-F1 junction, respectively. The\n\nA) Coomasie stained polyacrylamide gel showing the molecular weights of the histidine-tagged fusion peptide and purified RSV peptides (N, C, or NC) released by factor Xa cleavage of the corresponding histidine-tagged fusion proteins. A commercially synthesized HIV peptide, DP-178 (~4.5kd in size), was included for comparison. B) \u03b1RSV serum recognizes the peptides, N and NC but not the C peptide in an immunoblot. The arrow indicates the predicted migration for the C-peptide that was not recognized by \u03b1RSV serum. C) Circular Dichroism spectra of the NC single-chain peptide are consistent with a 6HB solution structure. The double minima at 222 and 208 nm are characteristic of the high level of helical secondary structure found in a 6HB.\n\nCell-surface IP demonstrates the presence of 6HB epitopes on the surface of RSV-infected cells actively undergoing fusion. Cell-surface reactivity to these epitopes can be adsorbed out with NC or N+C peptide mixtures but not with individual N or C peptides. 7) as compared to those triggered at 37 \u00b0C (lane 5). The amount of F1 subunit immunoprecipitated following 45 \u00b0C triggering appeared to be somewhat lower than that observed at 50-55 \u00b0C, however, it still appeared to be higher than that observed at 37 \u00b0C or 40\u00b0C\n\n(compare lane 8 with lanes 5 and 9, respectively). Lane 1 is a control showing F expression in RSV-infected cells immunoprecipitated with an anti-F monoclonal antibody (858-1). The pre-immunization serum (PI) did not immunoprecipitate any relevant proteins either in uninfected or RSV-infected cells (lanes 2 and 3) . B) Specificity of the \u03b1-NC antiserum binding at elevated temperature for 6HB epitope. Increased amount of 6HB formed during elevated temperature can be adsorbed out with corresponding 6HB peptides. The \u03b1-NC antiserum was preadsorbed with 5 \u03bcg each of peptides NC, N, C, or N+C, respectively or PBS (-) overnight at 4 \u00b0C and used in triggering experiments at 55 \u00b0C for 15min as described above. The NC and N+C peptides appeared to almost completely adsorb out the reactivity of \u03b1-NC antiserum at 55 \u00b0C (compare lanes 3 and 6 with lane 2). The adsorption of \u03b1-NC antiserum with N peptide alone (lane 4) or C peptide alone (lane 5) did not appear to significantly impair their ability to immunoprecipitate F1 subunit."}
