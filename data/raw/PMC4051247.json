{"title": "Poly(amidoamine) Dendrimer Nanocarriers and Their\nAerosol Formulations for siRNA Delivery to the Lung Epithelium", "body": "RNA interference (RNAi)\npromotes silencing of gene expression in\na post-transcriptional manner.1,2 The delivery of exogenous\ndouble-stranded small interfering RNA (ds-siRNA, typically consisting\nof 20\u201327 base pairs),3 which targets\nthe RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) located in the cell cytoplasm,\nis considered a very promising therapeutic approach in the treatment\nof a broad range of diseases.4,5 RNAi-based therapies\nhave also shown great potential in the treatment of pulmonary disorders\nincluding lung cancer,6 cystic fibrosis,7 asthma,8 chronic obstructive\npulmonary disease (COPD),8 respiratory\nsyncytial virus (RSV),9 and severe acute\nrespiratory syndrome (SARS) viral infection.10 However, further progress on siRNA-based technologies that target\nlung ailments has been hindered by the lack of adequate carriers capable\nof overcoming the extra and intracellular barriers present in the\nlung tissue, and challenges in formulating siRNA and their carriers\nin portable oral inhalation (OI) devices for the local delivery of\nsiRNA to the lungs.4,11,12\n\nPoly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers are highly monodispersed,\nhyperbranched\npolymers that contain easily functionalizable surface groups, and\nthus represent promising structures for the construction of effective\ndrug carriers and gene transfer vehicles.13,14 Amine-terminated PAMAM dendrimers have their surface groups (primary\namines) protonated at physiological conditions.15 They can thus efficiently bind to nucleic acids, forming\nnanoscale complexes termed dendriplexes16 that may offer opportunities to improve targeting of siRNA to the\ncell cytosol. Even though many publications have addressed the transfection\nof cells using dendrimer\u2013DNA complexes,17 few reports have discussed the gene silencing (with siRNA3,18 or antisense oligonucleotide19) with\nPAMAM dendrimers in cells that are models of the lung alveolar epithelium.\n\nOnce a suitable carrier for the delivery of siRNA to the cytosol\nof lung cells is found, another important consideration is the ability\nto target the siRNA\u2013carrier complex to the lungs. OI is a very\npromising route of administration for siRNA to the pulmonary epithelium\nsince it provides a direct and noninvasive means of targeting the\nlungs.20 Pressurized metered-dose inhalers\n(pMDIs) are important devices within the context of siRNA delivery\nto the lungs as they are the least expensive and most widely used\nOI devices. pMDIs are portable, have long shelf life, are reliable,\nand can be used even in patients with compromised lung function as\nthey are propellant based.21 However, due\nto formulations challenges, there has been no report in the literature\nto date of siRNA or siRNA\u2013carrier systems formulated in pMDIs.\n\nOn the basis of the challenges and opportunities discussed above,\nwe propose in this work the development of propellant-based OI formulations\nof siRNA\u2013dendrimer complexes for the efficient silencing of\ngenes of the lung epithelium. We report the preparation and characterization\nof siRNA\u2013G4NH2 dendriplexes, and evaluate the in vitro gene knockdown efficiency in a model lung alveolar epithelial cell\nline. We propose different formulation strategies for the dendriplexes,\nand study their aerosol performance. The relevance of this study stems\nfrom the fact that this is the first work to report the formulation\nof inhalable siRNA with aerosol properties suitable to deep lung deposition\nin pMDIs, which are the least expensive and most widely used portable\ninhalers available in the market. This study is relevant because,\nalso for the first time, it shows that siRNA\u2013G4NH2 dendriplexes\ncan efficiently target lung alveolar epithelial cells A549, and silence\ngenes even after siRNA has been exposed to the propellant environment.\n\nGeneration-four, amine-terminated poly(amidoamine)\ndendrimer (PAMAM G4NH2, 14,215 g \u00d7 mol\u20131, 64\nNH2 surface groups) was purchased from Dendritech Inc.

Mica sheet\nwas purchased from Ted Pella Inc. (Redding, CA, U.S.A.).\n\nDendriplexes\nwere formed by combining equal volumes (10\u2013100\n\u03bcL) of negatively charged siRNA (50\u2013150 \u03bcg \u00d7\nmL\u20131, RNase free DI-water) and positively charged\nPAMAM G4NH2 (150\u20133000 \u03bcg \u00d7 mL\u20131, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4 buffer RNase free).18,23 siRNA solution was added dropwise into the G4NH2 solution under\nvortex at 3000 rpm (VWR Digital Vortex Mixer) for 1 min. The siRNA\u2013G4NH2\ndispersions were kept at room temperature for at least 30 min before\nany experiments, in order to ensure complete formation of the dendriplexes.23 The G4NH2 concentration was varied in order\nto prepare dendriplexes at different N/P ratios\u2014the molar ratio\nbetween the primary amine groups (N) from G4NH2 and phosphate groups\n(P) from siRNA.24\n\nsiRNA\u2013G4NH2\ndendriplex dispersions (minimum of five independent batches, n = 5) were quantitatively analyzed using PicoGreen assay25 in a Synergy 2 Microplate Reader (BioTek, VT)\nfor the uncomplexed siRNA content, which was calculated using a linear\ncalibration curve (siRNA concentration vs fluorescent units). PicoGreen\nis an ultrasensitive fluorescent nucleic acid stain used to quantify\ndouble-stranded DNA (ds-DNA)25 and ds-siRNA\nin solution.26 The siRNA complexation efficiency\n(CE) was calculated on the basis of the difference between the initial\namount of siRNA added during the formation of the dendriplexes and\nthe non-entrapped free siRNA remaining in the dendriplex dispersion,\ni.e., an indirect measurement of the siRNA content complexed with\nPAMAM G4NH2 within dendriplexes.\n\nLight Scattering (LS, Malvern\nZetaSizer Nano ZS) was used to evaluate\nthe hydrodynamic size (diameter) and zeta potential (\u03b6) of the\nsiRNA\u2013G4NH2 dendriplexes. Samples were diluted to 80 nM siRNA,\nand measurements were performed at 25 \u00b0C using refractive index,\nviscosity, and dielectric constant of the buffer (for size) or DI-water\n(for \u03b6). Dendriplexes were formed in RNase free DI-water for\n\u03b6, which was calculated using the Smoluchowski Model.24 A minimum of three independent batches (n = 3) were used to calculated an average size and \u03b6.\n\nScanning electron microscopy (SEM, Jeol/EO JSM-6510LV-LGS, 25 kV)\nand AFM (Pico SPM LE Molecular Imaging) were used to investigate the\ngeometric size and morphology of the dendriplexes, which were formed\nin RNase-free DI-water. For SEM imaging, several drops of the siRNA\u2013G4NH2\ndispersion were deposited on a microscope cover glass, dried overnight,\nand sputter-coated with gold (Ernest Fullan) under vacuum for 40 s.\nThe sizes of the dendriplexes were estimated from the SEM images using\nImageJ 1.42q27 to confirm the size range\ndetermined by LS. The histogram of the measured diameters (>400\nparticles)\nwas fit to a Gaussian distribution, from which average and standard\ndeviation were calculated. For AFM imaging, 20 \u03bcL of siRNA\u2013G4NH2\ndendriplex dispersion was deposited on a freshly cleaved mica sheet\nand incubated at room temperature for 5 min28 to allow the binding of the dendriplexes onto the substrate. The\nsubstrate was then washed with few drops of DI-water, and dried with\ngentle air flow. AFM images were obtained using a Multi-75 silicon\nAFM probe in AC tapping mode.28\n\nThe capacity of G4NH2 to form\ncomplexes with siRNA was also examined by gel electrophoresis. A known\nvolume of the dendriplex dispersion (equivalent to 300 ng siRNA) was\nloaded in the slots of casted nondenaturing agarose gel (1.5% w/v\nin tris base, acetic acid, and EDTA (TAE) 1X pH 8.2 buffer) stained\nwith ethidium bromide (0.5 \u03bcg \u00d7 mL\u20131).\nThe electrophoresis was performed at 60 V (E0160-VWR Mini Gel Electrophoresis)\nfor 40 min, and the siRNA\u2013dye migration was visualized under\nUV irradiation (FOTO/Analyst Investigator/Eclipse with UV Transilluminator\nFotodyne Inc.). The images were recorded using the FOTO/Analyst PC\nImage software (v.5).\n\nThree RNase\nprotection assays\nwere performed. (i) the determination of the minimal RNase A concentration\nneeded to completely degrade free siRNA is described in the Supporting Information (SI). (ii) The effect\nof the N/P ratio on the protection efficiency against RNase A degradation\nwas also evaluated. Briefly, siRNA\u2013G4NH2 dendriplexes at different\nN/P ratios were formed in buffer as described earlier, and 6 \u03bcL\ndendriplex dispersions (equivalent to 250 ng siRNA) were incubated\nwith 8 \u03bcL RNase A in TE 1X pH 8 buffer (0.162 \u03bcg RNase\nA per 1 \u03bcg siRNA) for 6 h at 37 \u00b0C; following the addition\nof RiboLock RNase inhibitor (RI, 1 \u03bcL = 40\nU) and incubation for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C to stop degradation reaction.23 Dendriplexes were dissociated by adding 8 \u03bcL\nheparin (455 U per 1 \u03bcg siRNA) in TE 1X pH 8 buffer following\nincubation for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. Samples were frozen at \u221220\n\u00b0C overnight, and the integrity of siRNA was determined by gel\nelectrophoresis at the same conditions as those applied for gel retardation\nassay. (iii) The third set of experiments consisted in determining\nthe effect of RNase concentration on the siRNA integrity at a fixed\nN/P ratio. Briefly, siRNA\u2013G4NH2 dendriplexes at N/P 5 were\nincubated with increased concentrations of RNase (0.35, 0.7, 1.0,\n1.5, and 3.5 \u03bcg RNase A per 1 \u03bcg siRNA) for 6 h at 37\n\u00b0C, following the treatments with RI and heparin, as described\nearlier. Appropriate controls (free siRNA and dendriplexes \u00b1\nRNase A, and \u00b1 heparin treatments) were included in these experiments.\nHeparin decomplexation assay is described in SI.\n\nsiRNA\u2013G4NH2\ndendriplexes at different N/P ratios were formed in buffer as described\nearlier. A known volume of 0.1 M citrate/phosphate buffer (pH 5 or\n7.4, to mimic intracellular endosomes/lysosomes and cytosol,29 respectively) was added to the dendriplexes\ndispersion (2.2 \u03bcg siRNA) to make 2 mL, and samples were incubated\nin a water bath at 37 \u00b0C. Aliquots of 50 \u03bcL were taken\nout at each time point, placed in a black 96-well microplate, and\nfrozen at \u221220 \u00b0C. The collected samples were quantitatively\nanalyzed using PicoGreen assay25 in Synergy\n2 Microplate Reader (BioTek, VT) for the amount of siRNA released\nwith time, which was calculated using a linear calibration curve (siRNA\nconcentration vs fluorescent units) and taking into account the amount\nof free and complexed siRNA removed from the sample in each aliquot\nof 50 \u03bcL. Experiments were performed in triplicates (n = 3).\n\nA549 cells (passages\n5\u20138 from the original passage provided by ATCC) were seeded\nin 96-well microplate (5 \u00d7 103 cells per well) and\ncultured in 200 \u03bcL DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% AB\n(v/v) for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 (Thermo Scientific\nIncubator, NAPCO 8000WJ). For the cytotoxicity of free PAMAM G4NH2,\ncells were rinsed with PBS 1X buffer, the medium was replaced by 200\n\u03bcL of regular culture medium containing increased concentrations\nof G4NH2 dendrimer (0\u2013500 \u03bcM), and the cells were kept\nin the incubator for 48 h at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2. For\nthe cytotoxicity of dendriplexes, cells were rinsed with PBS 1X buffer,\nand the medium was replaced by 100 \u03bcL DMEM containing increasing\nconcentrations of siRNA\u2013G4NH2 dendriplexes at N/P 30 (0\u201325\n\u03bcM G4NH2, and 0\u20131.25 \u03bcM siRNA) formed in buffer\nas described earlier. Cells were kept in the incubator for 6 h at\n37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2. They were then overlaid with 100\n\u03bcL of regular culture medium (the dendriplexes were kept in\ncontact with the cells) and incubated for 72 h at 37 \u00b0C and 5%\nCO2. The protocol for the in vitro cytotoxicity\nof dendriplexes was designed according to the in vitro gene knockdown experimental conditions, and therefore, slightly\ndifferent from the protocol for dendrimer alone. The concentration\nranges of G4NH2 and siRNA used in the cytotoxicity experiments reported\nhere were designed in such way that the concentrations of G4NH2 and\nsiRNA applied in all gene knockdown and aerosol characterization fall\nwithin that. Equally important, the incubation time in the cytotoxicity\nexperiments falls within the usual time times (24\u201396 h) applied\nin gene knockdown experiments.30 The cell\nviability was assessed by MTS cell proliferation assay.31 Briefly, cells were rinsed with PBS 1X buffer,\nand 100 \u03bcL DMEM was added to the cells, followed by 20 \u03bcL\nMTS/PMS solution. Cells were incubated in this DMEM/MTS/PMS mixture\nfor 4 h at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2. MTS is bioreduced into\nformazan (which is soluble in the culture medium) by dehydrogenase\nenzymes found in metabolically active cells.31 Absorbance of formazan at 490 nm was measured directly from the\n96-well microplate (Molecular Devices, Spectra Max 250), and it is\nproportional to the number of living cells. Thus, cell viability (%)\nwas calculated as the ratio between the absorbance of treated (incubated\nwith free G4NH2 or dendriplexes) and untreated (G4NH2 and dendriplexes\nfree) cells. Experiments were performed applying seven independent\nwells per each condition (n = 7).\n\nIn order to\nevaluate the knockdown efficiency achieved by siRNA-based dendriplexes,\nA549 cells stably expressing eGFP were developed as detailed in SI. After successfully establishing the eGFP\nA549 cell line, eGFP knockdown experiments were performed. We tested\nboth a ds-siRNA targeting eGFP\u2014the positive sequence, called\nsiRNA(+), and an eGFP-mismatch ds-siRNA, the scramble or negative\nsequence called siRNA(\u2212). Dendriplexes at different N/P ratios\nwere formed between PAMAM G4NH2 and siRNA(+) and siRNA(\u2212) as\ndescribed earlier. Commercial transfection reagents (Lipofectamine\n2000 and TransFast)30,32 were used as positive controls,\nand free siRNA (+ and \u2212) was used as a negative control. All\neGFP knockdown experiments were performed according to Lipofectamine\n2000 protocol.30 First, eGFP stable A549\ncells were seeded in a 75 cm2 cell culture flask and subcultured\nuntil approximately 90% confluence. The cell culture medium (DMEM\nsupplemented with 10% FBS and 2.5 \u03bcg \u00d7 mL\u20131 puromycin selective antibiotic) was changed every 2 days. Then,\neGFP stable A549 cells (passages 10\u201320 from the original passage\nprovided by ATCC) were seeded in a 24-well microplate (50,000 cells\nper well) and cultured in 500 \u03bcL DMEM supplemented with 10%\nFBS (v/v, no antibiotics) for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 (Thermo Scientific Incubator, NAPCO 8000WJ). Cells were rinsed with\nPBS 1X buffer, and 250 \u03bcL transfection medium (DMEM containing\n80 nM of siRNA (+ or \u2212) equivalent to 20 pmol per well) was\nadded, and the transfection proceeded for 6 h at 37 \u00b0C and 5%\nCO2. The transfection medium was then replaced with 500\n\u03bcL culture medium (DMEM + 10% FBS, no antibiotics), and the\ncells were returned to the incubator for 72 h at 37 \u00b0C and 5%\nCO2. Cells were resuspended in 1 mL PBS 1X buffer, and\nthe median fluorescent intensity (MFI) was measured by flow cytometry\n(FACS, HWCRC 615 - BD LSR II Analyzer in Microscopy) with data from\n10,000 to 20,000 cells. Untreated non-eGFP and eGFP stable A549 cells\n(no siRNA or dendriplexes) were used as further controls. The MFI\nlevel of eGFP expression in untreated eGFP stable A549 cells was taken\nas 100%. The % eGFP knockdown efficiency was calculated by correlating\nthe eGFP expression of untreated stable eGFP A549 cells with that\nfrom transfected cells.\n\nThe effect of the propellant HFA-227\non the biological activity of the anti-eGFP ds-siRNA was also investigated.\nBriefly, a known amount of siRNA(+) dissolved in RNase free DI-water\nwas placed in a pressure proof glass vial, frozen at \u221220 \u00b0C\novernight, and lyophilized (Labconco Freeze Zone 1) at \u221247\n\u00b0C and 0.055 mbar for 48 h. The vial was closed with a pressure\nvalve (HiP, 15-11AF1) and propellant HFA-227 was filled into the vial\nwith the help of a manual syringe pump (HiP, 50-6-15) and a home-built\nhigh-pressure filler. The siRNA(+) was stored in HFA-227 at 25 \u00b0C\nand saturation pressure of the propellant, simulating a pMDI formulation\nof free siRNA(+). After two months, the propellant HFA-227 was released\nby depressurization, and the siRNA(+) was allowed to dry at room temperature,\nfollowing its dissolution in a known volume of RNase A free DI-water,\nmaking a siRNA(+) concentration of 10 nmol per 1 mL. As control, an\naliquot of the lyophilized siRNA(+) was kept in the freezer at \u221220\n\u00b0C instead of being stored in pressurized, liquid HFA. Gene knockdown\nexperiments (as described earlier) were performed with the siRNA(+)\nto evaluate the effect of storage under a compressed HFA environment.\nAll transfection experiments (siRNA as received, stored in HFA and\nfreezer) were performed, at minimum, in triplicates (n = 3).\n\nFirst, the biodegradable, water-soluble, and HFA-philic CSLA co-oligomer\nwas synthesized according to our previous work.33 CSLA was composed by short segments of lactide [oligo(LA)]\ngrafted onto low-Mw CS via ring-opening\npolymerization.33 Details about the synthesis\nand characterization can be found in SI. Emulsification diffusion33 was employed\nto prepare core\u2013shell microparticles of CSLA loaded with siRNA\u2013G4NH2\ndendriplexes. Briefly, 15 mg CSLA was dissolved in 800 \u03bcL RNase\nfree DI-water, and combined with 200 \u03bcL dispersion of siRNA\u2013G4NH2\nat N/P 10. The mixture (equivalent to 5\u201310 \u03bcg siRNA)\nwas emulsified in 19 mL ethyl acetate using a sonication bath (VWR,\nP250D, set to 180 W) for 5 min at 15\u201320 \u00b0C making a water-in-oil\n(W/O) emulsion, which was quickly transferred to 180 mL ethyl acetate.\nCore\u2013shell microparticles (CSLA as shell) loaded with siRNA\u2013G4NH2\ndendriplexes within their core were thus formed, collected via centrifugation\n(5000 rpm for 20 min), and dried in air-flow at room temperature.\n\nsiRNA\u2013G4NH2 dendriplexes at N/P 10 were formed in buffer\nas described earlier, and 200 \u03bcL of a dendriplex dispersion\n(equivalent to 10 \u03bcg siRNA) was combined with 30 mg mannitol\npreviously dissolved in 800 \u03bcL RNase free DI-water. The mixture\nwas spray-dried (BUCHI Mini Spray Dryer B-290) using the following\nparameters: atomizing air flow = 473 L\u00b7h\u20131,\naspiration = 70%, pump ratio = 5%, nozzle cleaner = 0, inlet temperature\n= 45 \u00b0C, outlet temperature = 30\u201333 \u00b0C. Nitrogen\nwas the atomizing gas, and dry mannitol microparticles loaded with\ndendriplexes (white powder) were accumulated in the collection vessel\nat the end of the glass cyclone, from where they were collected to\nbe used in further experiments.\n\nsiRNA loading efficiency into microparticles\nwas assessed by densitometry.7 Briefly,\na known amount of particles was dissolved in 200 \u03bcL TE 1X pH\n8 buffer and incubated at room temperature overnight, so that the\nwater-soluble mannitol or CSLA shell could be broken down. Next, a\nknown mass of heparin (equivalent to 455 U per 1 \u03bcg siRNA, based\non the estimation that all siRNA was loaded into microparticles) was\nadded to the mixture, which was vortexed until heparin dissolution.\nThe system was incubated for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C, so that siRNA complexed\nwith the G4NH2 could be released (see heparin decomplexation assay\nin SI). Samples were frozen at \u221220\n\u00b0C overnight, and gel electrophoresis was performed at conditions\napplied for the gel retardation assay. The siRNA content encapsulated\ninto the microparticles was quantified by densitometry using ImageJ\n1.42q27 based on the electrophoresis images.\nAppropriate controls were employed\u2014free siRNA mixed with heparin\n(positive control), and CSLA (or mannitol) mixed with heparin (no\nsiRNA, negative control). Four independent batches (n = 4) of dendriplexes loaded into microparticles were used to calculate\nan average and standard deviation of the loading. In addition, the\nintegrity of the siRNA after dendriplexes formation followed by encapsulation\ninto CSLA or mannitol microparticles was also determined.\n\nThe\nsize (diameter) of the microparticles was assessed by LS. Briefly,\nparticles loaded with siRNA\u2013G4NH2 at N/P 10 were dispersed\nin HPFP (2 mg per 1 mL) using a sonication bath, and measurements\nwere performed at 25 \u00b0C using refractive index, viscosity, and\ndielectric constant of the HPFP, which is a model of propellant HFA\nthat is liquid at ambient conditions.34 Next, HPFP was evaporated, and 1 mL RNase free DI-water was added\nto the microparticles to break down the CSLA shell (or mannitol) and\nrelease the siRNA from the dendriplexes. LS measurements were performed\nat 25 \u00b0C using refractive index, viscosity, and dielectric constant\nof the water, and thus, the hydrodynamic diameter of the dendriplexes\nwas recorded, but at this time, in the presence of the CSLA (or mannitol)\ndissolved in the aqueous medium. SEM was used to investigate the geometrical\nsize and morphology of the microparticles, which were dispersed in\nHPFP using a sonication bath. Several drops of the dispersion were\ndeposited on a microscope cover glass, the HPFP was quickly evaporated\nby air flow, and the glass was sputter-coated with gold (Ernest Fullan)\nunder vacuum for 40 s, following the SEM images.\n\nA known mass of microparticles (CSLA or\nmannitol) encapsulating siRNA\u2013G4NH2 dendriplexes (at N/P 10)\nwas weighed into pressure proof glass vials (8412-B, West Pharmaceutical\nServices) and crimp-sealed (CroPharm, Inc.) with a 63 \u03bcL metering\nvalves (EPDM, 3 M Drug Delivery Systems). A known volume of propellant\nHFA-227 was added with the help of a manual syringe pump (HiP, 50-6-15)\nand a home-built high pressure filler in order to make a 2 mg \u00d7\nmL\u20131 concentration.33 The particles were dispersed in the propellant using a sonication\nbath (VWR, P250D, set to 180 W, 15\u201320 \u00b0C).33 The physical stability was investigated via\na sedimentation rate experiment, that is, by visually monitoring the\nquality of the dispersions as a function of time after stopping the\nmechanical energy from the sonication\u2013digital images were taken\naccording to the time.33 pMDI formulations\nof free siRNA\u2013G4NH2 dendriplexes at N/P 10 were attempted,\nas described in SI. However, the free dendriplexes\nwere found not to disperse in the propellant to any degree.\n\nAn\neight-stage Andersen Cascade Impactor (ACI, Copley Scientific), fitted\nwith a USP induction port and operated with a flow rate of 28.3 L\n\u00d7 min\u20131 at 25 \u00b0C and 75% relative humidity,35 was used to evaluate the aerosol properties\nof the pMDI formulations, which were prepared as described earlier.\nPrior to each ACI test, the formulation was dispersed in the propellant\nwith the help of a sonication bath for 10\u201315 min at 15\u201320\n\u00b0C. After five actuations were fired to waste, the next 50\u201365\nactuations (depending on the siRNA concentration in the formulation)\nwere fired into the ACI, with an interval of 10 s between each actuation.33 After each test, the ACI was disassembled and\nhad the actuator (AC), induction port (IP), and all stages rinsed\nwith and kept in 20 mL RNase free DI-water for 6 h in order to break\ndown the water-soluble CSLA shell (or mannitol) from the microparticles\ncontaining siRNA\u2013G4NH2 dendriplexes. Samples were frozen at\n\u221220 \u00b0C overnight and lyophilized (Labconco Freeze Zone\n1) at \u221247 \u00b0C and 0.055 mbar for 48 h. The collected powder\nwas dissolved in 100 \u03bcL TE 1X buffer pH 8 and incubated with\na known mass of heparin (equivalent to 455 U per 1 \u03bcg siRNA,\nas described in SI) for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C,\nin order to dissociate the siRNA from the PAMAM G4NH2. Samples were\nfrozen (\u221220 \u00b0C) overnight, loaded into the slots of nondenaturing\nagarose gel following electrophoresis at conditions applied for gel\nretardation assay. The siRNA content in each ACI stage was quantified\nby densitometry using ImageJ 1.42q27 based\non the electrophoresis images and appropriate controls (presence or\nabsence of siRNA, as described earlier). The aerosol characteristics\nwere thus calculated: (i) fine particle fraction [FPF: the siRNA content\non the respirable stages of the ACI (from stage 3 to filter) over\nthe total siRNA content released into the impactor (from IP to filter)\nexcluding the siRNA remaining in the actuator];33 (ii) respirable fraction (RF: the siRNA content collected\nfrom stage 0 to filter over the total siRNA released into the impactor);36 (iii) % siRNA recovered, and siRNA content in\na single puff dose; (iv) mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD);\nand (v) geometric standard deviation (GSD). MMAD and GSD were calculated\nas described in the literature.33 ACI experiments\nwere performed in duplicates (n = 2).\n\nOriginPro 8 SR0 v8.0724 (B724)\nwas used to perform statistical analysis. Data were compared using\nOne-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey\u2019s posthoc\ntest. Means were considered statistically significant different with\na p value <0.05.\n\nsiRNA\u2013G4NH2\ndendriplexes at different N/P ratios were prepared\nand characterized with respect to their morphology, size and surface\ncharge according to AFM, SEM and LS. The results are summarized in\nTable 1. Details of the characterization for\none N/P ratio (N/P = 20), including AFM and SEM micrographs, are shown\nin Figure 1.\n\nIt was observed that the hydrodynamic diameter of the dendriplexes\ndid not vary substantially with the N/P ratio. As measured by LS,\nthe size average of all N/P ratios combined was 257 nm. This value\nwas confirmed by SEM (size average of 258 nm), and since these techniques\nprovide a good representation of the sizes of dendriplexes in solution,\nthey were preferred to the sizes estimated from AFM images (\u223c100\nnm). Discrepancies between the sizes of dendriplexes obtained from\nLS and AFM images have already been reported,28 and are likely due to sample preparation. As seen in the literature,28,37,38 the size of dendriplexes usually\ndisplays significant heterogeneities, as is the case for polyplexes\nprepared with other cationic polymers. This heterogeneity has been\nattributed to the electrostatic and entropic nature of the complexation\nprocess.37\n\nThe overall surface charge\nof the siRNA\u2013G4NH2 dendriplexes\nwere fairly similar, and did not show any specific trend as a function\nN/P either, with an average value of \u223c34 mV, also in agreement\nwith previous studies of dendriplexes with PAMAM dendrimers.38\n\nThe ability\nof G4NH2 to form\ncomplexes with siRNA as a function of the N/P ratio was investigated\nby gel electrophoresis combined with PicoGreen assay. The results\nare summarized in Table 1 and Figure 2.\n\nThe complexation efficiency (CE)\nof G4NH2 to siRNA is seen to be\nlow (<80%) at N/P < 1. However, almost all siRNA was complexed\nwith the PAMAM G4NH2 dendrimer at N/P ratios >2 (siRNA CE >\n95%).\nThese quantitative results assessed by PicoGreen assay\u2014measuring\nthe uncomplexed siRNA remaining in solution after dendriplex formation,\ni.e., an indirect method of quantifying the siRNA CE\u2014were confirmed\nby gel electrophoresis (inset in Figure 2). The siRNA band is seen to disappear in the gel\nas the N/P ratio increases, indicating that the siRNA was largely\ncomplexed with the PAMAM G4NH2 dendrimer and, thus, was unable to\nflow through the pores of the gel (compare lanes 2\u201311: siRNA\u2013G4NH2 dendriplexes formed at N/P 0.2\u201330, with lane 1: untreated siRNA control). Therefore, these results\nreinforce the observation that highly positively charged PAMAM G4NH2\nis able to condense siRNA into NPs very efficiently, since very little\nuncomplexed siRNA was found to be free in the supernatant after the\ncomplexation process (N/P > 2).\n\nsiRNA is\nvulnerable to degradation by RNases,39 and\none of the important potential advantages in using\nnanocarriers in siRNA therapeutic technologies is the ability to protect\nthis frail cargo. Thus, in order to evaluate the ability of PAMAM\nG4NH2 to protect siRNA from RNase degradation, siRNA\u2013G4NH2\ndendriplexes were formed at several N/P ratios and incubated with\nthe RNase A (the lowest concentration found to digest free siRNA completely\n\u22120.162 \u03bcg RNase A per 1 \u03bcg siRNA \u2013 as seen\nin the SI) for 6 h at 37 \u00b0C, following\nRNase inhibitor and heparin treatments, and gel electrophoresis so\nas to release and quantify the nondegraded siRNA. The results are\npresented in Figure 3. PAMAM G4NH2 is seen\nto efficiently protect siRNA from RNase A degradation upon complexation.\nAs seen in Figure 3, for all tested N/P ratios,\nthe siRNA released from the dendriplexes after being kept in contact\nwith RNase A (lanes 3, 7, 11, and 15) was comparable to the siRNA\nextracted from the dendriplexes which were not exposed to RNase A\n(lanes 5, 9, 13, and 17 - positive controls, respectively).\n\nNext, siRNA\u2013G4NH2 dendriplexes formed at\nN/P 5 were incubated\nwith increasing concentrations of RNase A (0.35, 0.7, 1.0, 1.5, and\n3.5 \u03bcg per 1 \u03bcg siRNA) for 6 h at 37 \u00b0C, following\nRNase inhibitor and heparin treatments, and gel electrophoresis, in\norder to probe the protection efficiency provided by the dendrimers\nat increasing RNase A concentrations. The results are shown in Figure 4 and again indicate that the siRNA was sufficiently\nprotected from RNase degradation upon complexation with PAMAM G4NH2.\nEven at this relatively low N/P ratio (N/P of 5), the siRNA was well\nprotected when kept in contact with very high concentrations of RNase\nA (3.5 \u03bcg per 1 \u03bcg siRNA); in Figure 4, compare the siRNA from dendriplexes incubated in presence\n(lane 20) and absence (lane 22)\nof RNase A.\n\nThe siRNA release from the dendriplexes was evaluated in\nvitro at 37 \u00b0C, in citrate/phosphate buffer at pHs 7.4\nand 5, in order to mimic cytosol and endosomes/lysosomes, respectively.29 The results are shown in Figure 5, and indicate that the siRNA in vitro release\nprofile from dendriplexes (N/P 10, 20, and 30) is highly dependent\nupon the pH. The release is much slower at acidic medium than at physiological\npH. At low pHs (<5) all primary and tertiary amines from PAMAM\nG4NH2 are protonated,40 and consequently\nthe electrostatic interactions between the positively charged dendrimer\nand negatively charged siRNA increase, which results in stronger binding\nand lower siRNA released at low pH. At physiological pH 7.4 the tertiary\namines are deprotonated, and only the primary amines are protonated,40 which decreases the electrostatic interactions\nbetween siRNA and G4NH2, and as a result, the release of the siRNA\nincreases at higher pH.\n\nThis degree of compactness observed at lower pHs\nis also manifested\nby the fact that no burst release is observed at pH 5.0. On the other\nhand, at physiological pH, a burst release was observed after 1\u20132\ndays, and it was \u223c3.5% or 5.5 pmol\u2014based on the initial\nloading of siRNA into dendriplexes. After 3\u20135 days, it was\nobserved that 8\u201310% siRNA was released from the dendriplexes,\nwhich corresponds to 13\u201316 pmol. The results in Figure 5 show that 48, 24, and 34% of the total siRNA complexed\nwith G4NH2 is released from the dendriplexes at N/P 10, 20, and 30,\nrespectively, after 20 days in citrate/phosphate buffer pH 7.4 at\n37 \u00b0C. While no literature results are available for the in vitro release of siRNA from PAMAM dendriplexes, we can\ncontrast the results obtained here with the release of oligonucleotide\n(ON) from PEI polyplexes.41 At N/P 15 and\n40 in PBS pH 7.4 and 37 \u00b0C, 55% ON was released from PEI after\n20 days (i.e., ON was released faster from PEI at N/P 40 than N/P\n15), a result somehow similar to that observed here\u2013siRNA released\nslightly faster from G4NH2 at N/P 30 than N/P 20 in buffer pH 7.4.\nThis is likely due to hydrophilization41 operated by G4NH2, i.e., dendriplexes formed at higher N/P have\nincreased G4NH2 content, which can contribute for more rapid entry\nof water molecules into the dendriplexes. Water molecules can penetrate\nthroughout the G4NH2 interior, cause the dendrimer structure to swell\n(due to the favorable interaction of water molecules with the primary\nand tertiary amines),42,43 and thus release the siRNA. However,\nthe amount of siRNA released from dendriplexes at N/P 30 was statistically\nsignificant different from that at N/P 20 at 12 h and day 2 only.\nSince the in vitro release was conducted with 24\ntime points, we demonstrate that, in 92% of all time points, the siRNA\nreleased from dendriplexes at N/P 20 and 30 was not statistically\nsignificantly different (n = 3 for each time point,\nOne-Way ANOVA followed by Tukey\u2019s posthoc test, p value <0.05).\n\nCationic dendritic polymers, such as polypropyleneimine\n(PPI), poly-l-lysine (PLL), and PAMAM, may induce significant in vitro cytotoxicity due to the high density of cationic\ngroups on their surface.44 There are many\nreports discussing the concentration- and generation-dependent toxicity\nof dendrimers,13,28,44\u221246 which is a critical factor to be considered when\nevaluating the potential of dendrimers as nanocarriers for siRNA delivery.\nHere, in vitro cytotoxicity studies were performed\nwith A549 cells by incubating them with free PAMAM G4NH2, and siRNA\u2013G4NH2\ndendriplexes at N/P 30, according to the MTS cell proliferation assay.31 The cell viability results are shown in Figure 6.\n\nThe results presented in Figure 6a\nindicate\nthat the viability of A549 was >85% when the cells were in contact\nwith PAMAM G4NH2 for 48 h at concentrations up to 5 \u03bcM. This\nresult is in agreement with previous literature reporting that the\nviability of A549 cells was >80% for G4NH2 at low concentrations\nof\n0.7 and 7 \u03bcM, as evaluated by MTT cell proliferation assay after\n72 h of incubation.47 Several other works\nreport different cytotoxicity results for PAMAM G4NH2,45,46,48 and thus, the cytotoxicity of\nG4NH2 is dependent upon concentration, cell type, and incubation time.49 PAMAM dendrimers are known to be cytotoxic by\ncausing membrane rupture, substantially related to the formation of\ncavities in the cellular membrane.49 Toxicity\nand other dendritic properties (interactions, mechanisms of cellular\nuptake, and intracellular fate) are most likely governed by the surface\ngroups.50\n\nThe toxic effects of siRNA\u2013G4NH2\ndendriplexes at N/P 30\n(the highest N/P ratio applied in the gene knockdown experiments discussed\nnext) to A549 were also investigated via MTS assay after 72 h of contact\nof dendriplexes with the cells. The results in Figure 6b indicate that the cytotoxicity of the dendriplexes at N/P\n30 was low, even at the highest concentration studied\u2013viability\nof A549 cells was \u223c80% at 25 and 1.25 \u03bcM of G4NH2 and\nsiRNA, respectively. In addition, the in vitro viability\nof A549 cells incubated with siRNA\u2013G4NH2 dendriplexes at N/P\n30 (72 h) is comparable to that with G4NH2 alone (48 h) at the same\nG4NH2 concentration, e.g., cell viability of \u223c90% (Figure 6a and b) at 0.25 \u03bcM G4NH2; and \u223c75%\nand 80% (Figures 6a and b, respectively) at\n25 \u03bcM G4NH2. Moreover, the in vitro viability\nof A549 cells after incubation with 5 and 50 \u03bcM G4NH2 alone\n(48 h) was found not statistically significantly different from that\nwith 25/1.25 \u03bcM G4NH2\u2013siRNA at N/P 30 (72 h) (n = 7, One-Way ANOVA followed by Tukey\u2019s posthoc\ntest, p value <0.05). These results suggest that\nsiRNA\u2013G4NH2 dendriplexes did not become more toxic than G4NH2\nalone.\n\nIt has been reported in literature that J-774 cells (macrophage-like\ncell line) showed 90\u201395% viability after 24 h incubation with\nsiRNA\u2013G4NH2 dendriplexes at N/P 10 (0.05 \u03bcM siRNA) as\nmeasured by MTT assay.51 Here, at the same\n0.05 \u03bcM siRNA concentration, A549 cells showed \u223c85% viability.\nThis result is interesting since the time of incubation and N/P ratio\nwere both 3-fold higher than that reported in literature.51 Other work showed that the viability of A549\nwas reduced to 45% when the cells were incubated with G5NH2/ON (20\nmer and 0.16 \u03bcM) dendriplexes at N/P 15 for 4 h, following measure\nby CellTiter-Blue.19 Here, at similar 0.125\n\u03bcM RNA concentration, the viability of A549 cells was \u223c80%.\nThus, it can be seen that the in vitro cell viability\nresulting from the delivery of siRNA using PAMAM dendrimers is variable\nat some extent and depends on several factors\u2014e.g., dendrimer\nsurface groups and generation, physicochemical properties of the siRNA\u2013dendrimer\ndendriplexes, assay, experimental conditions, cell type and passage,\nand certainly, some interlab variability can be observed as well.\n\nThe in vitro cytotoxicity results are necessary\nfor the gene knockdown studies. When working in concentration regions\nof no toxicity, gene knockdown is not confounded with nonspecific\ntoxicity. At the harshest conditions of the in vitro cytotoxicity studies, the cell viability of A549 was still \u223c80%\nafter 72 h of incubation with siRNA\u2013G4NH2 dendriplexes at N/P\n30 containing 25 and 1.25 \u03bcM G4NH2 and siRNA, respectively.\nIn contrast, at the harshest condition of the in vitro gene knockdown experiments (discussed next), the A549 cells were\nincubated for 6 h only, with dendriplexes at N/P 30 containing 1.95\n\u03bcM and 80 nM G4NH2 and siRNA, respectively. At these G4NH2 and\nsiRNA concentrations, the viability of A549 cells was at least \u223c90%\n(Figure 6b), and expected to be higher at smaller\nN/P ratios. It is worthwhile to mention that cellular debris (due\nto dead or damaged dying cells) was gated out during the FACS analyses\nto prevent any toxic effects of the G4NH2 alone and/or siRNA\u2013G4NH2\ndendriplexes to mask the true gene knockdown.\n\nFACS of A549 cells stably expressing eGFP was\nused to investigate the gene silencing efficiency of siRNA\u2013G4NH2\ndendriplexes. Lipofectamine 2000 (LF) and TransFast (TF) were the\ncommercial transfection reagents selected as positive controls. TF\nis originally designed as a transfection reagent for DNA,32 but it has shown gene suppression of \u223c60\u201390%\nwhen used to deliver siRNA in vitro.52 Free siRNA was used as the negative control. A549 cells\nthat were not transduced (no eGFP) were used as reference. Cellular\ndebris was gated out during FACS to prevent the small toxicity of\nthe nanocarriers to mask true gene knockdown. Transfection of eGFP\nstable A549 cells was performed with ds-siRNA targeting eGFP, the\npositive sequence siRNA(+), and an eGFP-mismatch ds-siRNA, the nonrelevant\nnegative sequence siRNA(\u2212). The results are shown in Figure 7, and indicate that the gene knockdown efficiency\nof siRNA(+)\u2013G4NH2 dendriplexes varied from 22 to 37%, and was\nintermediate between the positive controls (LF at 72% and TF at 70%),\nand free siRNA(+) (2.8%). The gene silencing efficiency of the eGFP\ncells treated with the commercial reagents and dendriplexes at N/P\n5, 10, 20 and 30, was found to be statistically significantly different\nfrom that of eGFP cells treated with free siRNA(+) only. Additionally,\nno statistically significant difference was found when comparing the\neGFP knockdown efficiency as a function of the N/P ratio (minimum n = 3, One-Way ANOVA followed by Tukey\u2019s posthoc\ntest, p value <0.05).\n\nFew reports in literature have\ninvestigated the in vitro knockdown efficiency by\nsiRNA or antisense oligonucleotide (AON)\ndelivered via dendriplexes to A549 lung alveolar epithelial cells.\nDendrosomes (dendriplexes formed between G5NH2 and AON incorporated\ninto liposomes) have shown suppression of the PKC-\u03b1 gene expression\nbetween ca. 27\u201374% at messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels,\nrespectively.19 Dendriplexes formed between\nfolate\u2013PEG appended to cyclodextrin\u2013G3NH2 conjugates\nand siRNA have provided luciferase knockdown ranging from \u223c15\u201350%,3 and up to 80% with siRNA\u2013G7NH2 dendriplexes.18 Such variability in the in vitro gene silencing efficiency is expected due to the differences in\nthe target gene, assay to assess the knockdown, experimental conditions\nduring transfection (e.g., N/P ratio, treatment times, siRNA and AON\nconcentrations), generation of the PAMAM dendrimer, and presence of\nother molecules/structures in the carrier.\n\nWhile no gene knockdown\nresult has been reported for siRNA\u2013G4NH2\ndendriplexes on A549 cells, we contrast our results with the literature\nfor other cell types. siRNA\u2013G4NH2 dendriplexes at N/P 10 caused\n12.5 and 22% inhibition of eGFP expression in J-774 (macrophage-like)\nand T98G (human glioblastoma) cell lines, respectively,51 and 10% eGFP knockdown in C-166 (mouse yolk\nsac embryo) cells.48 Thus, the eGFP silencing\nefficiency (\u223c22\u201337%) obtained with siRNA\u2013G4NH2\ndendriplexes on the A549 alveolar epithelial cells is comparable to\nother cell types and falls within the range reported for other PAMAM-based\ndendriplexes (with and without the help of other molecules/structures).\nDespite this low-to-moderate gene silencing in vitro, the proposed siRNA\u2013G4NH2 dendriplexes have the potential\nto demonstrate gene silencing in vivo (following\noptimization, but such is not the focus of this work), since PAMAM-based\nnanocarreirs have shown promising results in the delivering siRNA in vivo, even if the gene silencing efficiency in\nvivo is lower compared to that observed in vitro.3,23,53 This is due to the\nsiRNA potency, i.e., very small amounts of siRNA (once properly delivered\nto the target site) are shown sufficient for effective in\nvivo gene silencing.54\u221256\n\nIt is worth noticing a\nreduction in eGFP expression in A549 cells\nis also observed when the scramble siRNA(\u2212) was delivered using\nLF (34%), TF (19.5%), and G4NH2 (6\u201315%): Figure 7. It has been shown that LF/siRNA(\u2212) complexes cause\nmeasurable and undesirable gene silencing \u223c25\u201350% in\ndifferent cell types.57,58 This unwanted eGFP suppression\nis most likely due to off-target effects,59 which can be due to toxicity of nanocarrier,57 and also due to the similarity between the nucleotide sequence\nfrom the siRNA(\u2212) and short motifs in mRNA and other unrelated\ngenes not targeted during the transfection.59,60 Alterations in gene expression in vitro and in vivo have been also reported for several types of nanocarriers,\nincluding linear and branched PEI,61 PEG\u2013PEI,61 polypropylenimine (PPI),62 diaminobutane (DAB).62 Off-target\neffects in RNAi are quite common and an issue of consideration when\ndeveloping RNAi technologies,60 but may\nbe hard to avoid,59 and are still not well\nunderstood.61\n\nIn order to test whether\nthe biological activity of the siRNA was preserved after the formulation\nin the pMDI (under HFA atmosphere), the gene knockdown activity of\ndendriplexes formed with siRNA(+) that was lyophilized and stored\nunder HFA-227 at 25 \u00b0C and saturation pressure of the propellant\nfor two months, was compared to a control (lyophilized but stored\nat \u221220 \u00b0C). Gene knockdown experiments were performed\non eGFP A549 cells as discussed above, with dendriplexes having an\nN/P ratio of 20, and the results are shown in Figure 7. Even after storage conditions in propellant HFA, it can\nbe observed that the siRNA(+) was still biologically active to silence\nthe eGFP expression in A549 cells: \u223c69% and 22% eGFP knockdown\nfor TF and dendriplexes at N/P 20, respectively. Similar values were\nobtained with the control siRNA(+) that was not stored under HFA-227,\nbut at \u221220 \u00b0C in freezer (FRE)\u201467% and 22% for\nTF and N/P 20, respectively. The gene silencing efficiency was found\nto be statistically significant between the eGFP cells treated with\nTF/siRNA(+) and dendriplexes at N/P 20\u2013for both storages in\nHFA and FRE, when compared to cells treated with free siRNA(+) as\nreceived. Most importantly, the gene knockdown efficiency provided\nby dendriplexes at N/P 20 (and TF) prepared with siRNA(+) as received,\nstored in HFA and FRE, was found not to be statistically significantly\ndifferent (minimum n = 3, One-Way ANOVA followed\nby Tukey\u2019s posthoc test, p value <0.05).\nCollectively, these results indicate that the biological activity\nof the siRNA is kept after long-term exposure in propellant HFA.\n\nThere are major obstacles in the regional delivery\nof the dendriplexes to the lungs when using OI devices. While the\ndendriplexes are in the order of nanometers in size, the optimum aerosol\nsize for deep lung deposition is in the micrometer range (0.5\u20135\n\u03bcm).63 Particles with an aerodynamic\ndiameter <0.5 \u03bcm may be exhaled, while those >5 \u03bcm\ntend to be deposited in the mouth and throat, ending up in the digestive\ntract. Moreover, alveolar macrophages are most selective to particles\nof 1\u20133 \u03bcm, and less efficient toward larger (\u22736\n\u03bcm) and smaller (\u2272260 nm) particles.12 In the case of pMDIs, another hurdle that needs to be overcome\nis the physical stabilization of the microparticle dispersions (suspension)\nin the low dielectric propellant HFA.64,65\n\nIt is\nnecessary, therefore, to develop particle engineering strategies capable\nof forming stable suspension of the dendriplexes in the form of microparticles\nsuitable for deep lung deposition and able to minimize the uptake\nby alveolar macrophages. We demonstrate in this work two such strategies.\nOne consists in encapsulating the dendriplexes within mannitol microparticles,\nvia spray drying; the other consists in using a CSLA co-oligomer shell\nthat is formed during emulsification diffusion. Mannitol was chosen\nas it has high aqueous solubility, it is a generally recognized as\na safe (GRAS) excipient widely used as bulking agent and nonactive\ncarrier in dry powder inhalers.66 Mannitol\nparticles alone also have shown to have less adhesion/cohesion in\npropellant HFA, slower sedimentation rates, and superior aerosol performance\nthan other sugars, such as lactose.67 The\nCSLA co-oligomer was chosen because it is water-soluble and interfacially\nactive at the W/O interface of the emulsion droplets (it migrates/resides\nat the interface formed between the small water droplets into the\nlarge ethyl acetate organic phase).65 During\nthe emulsification diffusion, the dendriplexes are kept within the\nwater emulsion droplets, and then encapsulated by the CSLA co-oligomer\nresiding at the W/O interface of the emulsion droplets. Thus, the\norganic phase is not expected to be in contact with the siRNA of the\ndendriplexes and/or affect somehow the dendriplex aggregates within\nthe CSLA microparticles. In addition, the CSLA co-oligomer is degradable\nand non-HFA soluble\u2013i.e., the shell will not disintegrate in\nHFA but will break down when in contact with the fluid lining the\nlungs.65 The ester groups from the LA are\nHFA-philic,64,68 and microparticles formed with\nCSLA shell have shown enhanced physical stability in propellant HFAs.33,36,65 An important detail is that the\nnonactive ingredients used to form these microparticles (mannitol\nand CSLA) can readily dissolve in aqueous media65,66 as the fluid lining the lungs, thus releasing the nanosized dendriplexes,\nand consequently minimizing the alveolar macrophage uptake. In addition,\nit is also worthwhile to point out that we have previously shown that\nCSLA does not impact the gene transfer potential of CSLA-based microparticles\nas carriers for CS-pDNA complexes.33\n\nThe size and morphology of the CSLA and mannitol microparticles\ncontaining siRNA\u2013G4NH2 dendriplexes at N/P 10 were evaluated\nby LS and SEM. The results are shown in Figure 8. Microparticles were loaded with dendriplexes at N/P 10 instead\nof N/P 5 and 20 (even though dendriplexes at N/P 5, 10, and 20 resulted\nin similar in vitro gene knockdown efficiency, as\nshown in Figure 7) because N/P 10 produced\nslightly smaller and more stable dendriplexes in solution (please\nrefer to Table 1) than did N/P 5 and 20.\n\nThe hydrodynamic diameter of CSLA and mannitol microparticles\nmeasured\nby LS was found to be 2.0 \u00b1 0.8 \u03bcm and 4.6 \u00b1 0.9 \u03bcm,\nrespectively, as shown in Figure 8; average\nand standard deviation were calculated based on eight (n = 8) independent batches. These results suggest that the spherical\ndendriplexes carrying microparticles are in the desired size range\nfor appropriate deep lung deposition.67\n\nIt is worthwhile to mention that the size of the dendriplexes\nat\nN/P 10 was measured by LS after contacting the microparticles with\naqueous solution, and it was found to be 236 \u00b1 75 nm and 192\n\u00b1 38 nm for CSLA and mannitol, respectively. Size distribution\nby LS is shown as inset in Figure 8; average and standard deviation calculated based on five\n(n = 5) independent experiments. Thus, the hydrodynamic\ndiameter of the dendriplexes at N/P 10 released from the shell are\nreadily comparable to those (Table 1) before\nloading into CSLA or mannitol microparticles and are nonstatistically\nsignificantly different (n = 5, One-Way ANOVA followed\nby Tukey\u2019s posthoc test, p value <0.05).\nThis demonstrates that the process of forming the microparticles does\nnot seem to induce any undesirable irreversible aggregation of the\ndendriplexes.\n\nThe siRNA loading efficiency (% siRNA encapsulated\ninto microparticles\nfrom the initial content complexed with dendrimers) into CSLA and\nmannitol microparticles was measured via densitometry using ImageJ,27 based on the images obtained from gel electrophoresis\n(insets in Figure 8) using\nthe protocol discussed in Experimental Section. The siRNA loading efficiency within the microparticles of 49.0\n\u00b1 8.4% was found for CSLA (230 \u00b1 20 ng siRNA per 1 mg CSLA\nparticles), and 25.4 \u00b1 4.0% (229 \u00b1 47 ng siRNA per 1 mg\nmannitol particles) for mannitol. The final siRNA yield was 65% and\n50% (w/w) after emulsification diffusion and spray drying, considering\nthe initial content of CSLA and mannitol, respectively.\n\nThe\nintegrity of the siRNA after particle preparation was also\nobserved using the same gel images (inset in Figure 8). The siRNA bands after particle preparation was\nfound to be very similar (position in the gel) to the untreated siRNA\ncontrol (compare lanes 1 and 3).\nThe intensity of the band in lane 3, which corresponds\nto the siRNA released from microparticles, is weaker due to the fact\nthat less siRNA is added to the gel (see loading efficiency above).\nCollectively, these results demonstrate the feasibility of encapsulating\nsiRNA-based dendriplexes into CSLA and mannitol microparticles via\nemulsification diffusion and spray drying processes, respectively.\nThe siRNA was successfully loaded into such microparticles (which\nshowed appropriate size for formulation in pMDIs), it conserved its\nintegrity, and the hydrodynamic diameter of the dendriplexes was kept\nafter particle processing and shell dissolution.\n\nSedimentation rate experiments of the microparticles\ncontaining dendriplexes at 25 \u00b0C and saturation pressure of the\npropellant were performed in order to evaluate their physical stability\nin HFA. Microparticles were weighed into pressure proof glass vials,\ncrimp sealed with 63 \u03bcL metering valves, and a known volume\nof propellant HFA-227 was added to make 2 mg \u00d7 mL\u20131. The particles were dispersed with the aid of a sonication bath\nfor 30 min at 15\u201320 \u00b0C. Stability of the formulations\nwas determined visually via sedimentation rate/flocculation as a function\nof the time after stopping the mechanical energy input from the sonication\nbath. Digital images were taken, and the results are presented as insets in Figure 9.\n\nDispersions of both CSLA and mannitol microparticles containing\nsiRNA\u2013G4NH2 dendriplexes at N/P 10 in propellant HFA-227 showed\ngood physical stability. While some aggregation could be observed\non the walls of the canister and in the bulk propellant, no strong\nflocculation/irreversible aggregation was observed (insets in Figure 9). Aggregates formed due to sedimentation\ncould be easily redispersed by simple manual agitation. In the case\nof CSLA, the improved physical stability compared to dendriplexes\nalone, which are not dispersible in propellant HFA (see SI) arises due to the enhanced solvation of the\nester groups from (LA chains) of CSLA by the propellant HFA.64,68 In the case of the mannitol, the reasons for the enhanced stability\nare less clear, but we expect to have an improved density matching\nto that of HFA-227 since spherical spray-dried mannitol microparticles\nproduce densities \u223c1.47\u20131.51 g \u00d7 cm\u20133 (depending on the spray-drying conditions)69 and the density of HFA-227 is 1.39 at 25 \u00b0C.34 Moreover, the fact that the cohesive force for mannitol\nin HFA is relatively lower compared to other those of other sugars,\nsuch as lactose,67 indicates an enhanced\nsolvation of that surface in the propellant, but this is a relative\nobservation, and no quantitative comparison with the cohesive interaction\nbetween CSLA particles and those with mannitol is available.\n\nAn eight-stage ACI was used to quantify the\naerosol properties of the HFA-based formulations containing the mannitol\nand CSLA engineered microparticles, with siRNA\u2013G4NH2 dendriplexes\n(N/P 10) loaded within their core. As described earlier, free dendriplexes\n(negative control, with no mannitol or CSLA shell) did not disperse\nat all in propellant HFA-227 (the dendriplexes remained stuck onto\nthe walls of the canister, and thus ACI tests could not even be performed).\nThe siRNA content for the microparticle formulations was quantified\nby incubation of each ACI stage with RNase free DI-water (which broke\ndown the mannitol or CSLA shell, thus releasing the dendriplexes to\nthe aqueous solution) followed by freezing, lyophilization, heparin\ndecomplexation assay (which dissociates the siRNA from the G4NH2),\ngel electrophoresis, and densitometry using the gel images, as described\nearlier. A summary of the results is shown in Table 2, and plotted as % in Figure 9.\n\nThe FPF, an important aerosol characteristic\nthat serves as a measure\nof the therapeutically beneficial portion of the inhaled mass of siRNA\nwhich would reach the lower respiratory tract,70 was determined from the ACI results. The FPF for mannitol\nand CSLA microparticles was determined to be 49% and 46%, respectively,\nwhich is excellent, falling within those of commercial HFA-based pMDIs\nfor small-molecule therapeutics (30\u201355% on average)65,71 even though no optimization was attempted in our case. It is worth\nnoticing that FPFs for both formulations were not significantly different\n(n = 2, One-Way ANOVA followed by Tukey\u2019s\nposthoc test, p value <0.05). The respirable fraction\n(RF) (siRNA content collected from stage 0 to filter over the total\nsiRNA released into the impactor36) was\nfound to be slightly higher for pMDIs formulated with mannitol microparticles\n(77%) than those with CSLA (64%), but these results were not statistically\nsignificantly different from each other (n = 2, One-Way\nANOVA followed by Tukey\u2019s posthoc test, p value\n<0.05).\n\nThe MMAD and GSD are properties that characterize\nthe particles\nin the aerosol spray. MMAD represents the aerodynamic diameter (AD)\non a mass basis, and GSD is a measure of the spread of particle size\naround this median.72 As seen in Table 2, the MMAD and GSD of the CSLA and mannitol microparticles\nloaded with siRNA\u2013G4NH2 dendriplexes were not statistically\nsignificantly different from each other: MMAD of 1.9 and 2.6 \u03bcm,\nand GDS of 3.7 and 3.8 on average, respectively (n = 2, One-Way ANOVA followed by Tukey\u2019s posthoc test, p value <0.05). These results indicate that microparticles\nfrom both strategies, mannitol and CSLA, would be able to deliver\nsiRNA to the deep lungs.\n\nThe MMAD (by ACI) and hydrodynamic\ndiameter (by LS) of CSLA microparticles\nwere similar to each other (1.9 and 2.0 \u03bcm on average, respectively),\nbut different for mannitol microparticles (2.6 and 4.6 \u03bcm on\naverage, respectively). Differences between aerodynamic and hydrodynamic\ndiameters of particles are somehow expected because the aerodynamic\ndiameter is a property that depends on shape, density, and size (geometric\ndiameter) of the particles.73,74 For spherical particles\nwith density of 1, the geometric and aerodynamic diameters should\nbe the same, provided that there is no aggregation.74 Hydrodynamic diameter is expected to be slightly larger\nthan geometric diameter75 due to the presence\nof a solvation layer around the particle.\n\nThe most significant\ndifference in both strategies came in the\nform of the total siRNA recovered and the siRNA content in a single\npuff dose (n = 2, One-Way ANOVA followed by Tukey\u2019s\nposthoc test, p value <0.05). While the fraction\nrecovered in the mannitol formulation was only 28%, 85% was recovered\nin the CSLA formulation. The single puff dose in the mannitol formulation\nwas only 9.5 ng, while that for CSLA engineered microparticles was\n26 ng. These results indicate that the strategy of encapsulating siRNA\u2013G4NH2\ninto CSLA microparticles using the emulsification diffusion technique\nseems to have greater efficiency for delivering siRNA to the lungs.\nCollectively, the results shown here indicate that pMDI formulations\nfrom both microparticle engineering strategies proposed produce aerosols\nconducive to deep deposition of siRNA to the lungs. However, in terms\nof total siRNA recovered and the amount of siRNA actuated from the\npMDI, the CSLA strategy displayed a much greater efficiency.\n\nIn this work we demonstrate, for the first time, the ability to\nformulate siRNA in pMDIs. This carries great weight as pMDIs are the\nleast expensive and most widely used portable oral inhalation devices\navailable in the market today and also because of the tremendous promise\nof therapeutic siRNA in treating lung diseases, as indicated by the\nmany ongoing clinical trials where the lungs are the target tissue.11,76 We show that complexes between siRNA and positively charged PAMAM\ndendrimers (G4NH2) can successfully silence the production of genes\nin a model alveolar epithelial cell (A549), and aerosols of pMDIs\nformulated with those nanosized complexes encapsulated either in a\nGRAS component (mannitol) or a biodegradable co-oligomer (CSLA) have\nhigh respirable fractions (up to 77%), and fine particle fractions\n(\u223c50%), which are comparable to those of highly optimized commercial\npMDIs for small-molecule therapeutics. We also show that, even after\nexposure to the propellant HFA used in pMDIs, the biological activity\nof the siRNA (gene silencing) is still maintained. Moreover, the dendriplexes\nare shown to preserve their characteristics after particle engineering,\na necessary feature to reproduce its gene silencing ability after\ndelivery to deep lungs. This work is highly complementary to other\nstudies that have demonstrated the possibility of delivering siRNA\nto the lungs using dry powder inhalers77,78 and nebulizers,79 which are other important tools available to\nthe clinicians to target medically important lung disorders along\nwith pMDIs."}
