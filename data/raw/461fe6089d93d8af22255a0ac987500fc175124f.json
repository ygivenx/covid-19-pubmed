{"title": "", "body": "Abdominal distention has several causes. These causes may be present alone or in combination. A mnemonic classifies the causes using an \"8F scheme\": fluid, fat, food, feces, flatus, fetus, formidable organomegaly and feeble abdominal musculature.\n\nFluid accumulation in the peritoneal cavity is the most common cause of pathologic abdominal distention and of marked abdominal distention, but it is not as common in cats as in dogs.\n\n\u2022 In broad definitions (used here), fluid in the peritoneal cavity is referred to as peritoneal effusion or ascites. In terms of clinical pathology, the type of fluid may be a transudate, modified transudate, septic exudate, non-septic exudate, chyle, blood, bile or urine. In narrow definitions, peritoneal effusion and ascites refer to transudates and modified transudates. Characteristics of the various types of fluids vary somewhat with laboratories, but the following definitions are typical.\n\n-Transudate -clear and colorless, specific gravity (SG) \u2264 1.013-1.018, total protein <25 g/L (2.5 g/dl), low cellularity (total nucleated cell count < 1.0-1.5 \u00d7 10 9 /L [1000-1500/\u03bcl]). -Modified transudate -clear to slightly cloudy, straw-colored to pink-white, SG > 1.013-1.018, total protein between 25 and 50 g/L (2.5-5.0 g/dl), and total nucleated cell count < 5.0-7.0 \u00d7 10 9 /L (< 5000-7000/\u03bcl). Nucleated cells consist of mesothelial cells, non-degenerate neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes. -Exudate -turbid to opaque white to yellow or red, SG > 1.018, high protein (> 25 g/L [2.5 g/dl]), highly cellular (total nucleated cell count > 5.0 \u00d7 10 9 /L [5000/\u03bcl]).\n\n\u2022 Ligation of portosystemic shunt (p 475) Ligation of a portosystemic shunt may lead to ascites secondary to portal hypertension.\n\nAcquired coagulopathy may cause abdominal hemorrhage.\n\n\u2022 Traumatic hemorrhage*(p 471)\n\nAbdominal hemorrhage may occur with blunt trauma (e.g. motor vehicle accident, falling from heights), penetrating trauma (e.g. abdominal bite wound), or post-operatively.\n\n\u2022 Traumatic rupture of the urinary bladder or urethra* (p 463)\n\nThe urinary bladder may rupture from motor vehicle trauma, falling from heights, bladder expression, cystocentesis, penetrating trauma and as a complication of urethral obstruction. Abdominal fluid is urine \u00b1 blood.\n\n\u2022 Umbilical, inguinal and traumatic abdominal wall hernia (p 478) Owners may misinterpret change in abdominal contour due to herniation of abdominal fat or organs as abdominal distention.\n\n\u2022 Ruptured gall bladder or bile duct (p 478) Motor vehicle trauma, falling from heights, gunshot wounds and cholelithiasis may cause rupture of the gall bladder or a major bile duct. Fluid is dark bile-stained and a modified transudate to exudate.\n\nOwners may misinterpret a change in abdominal contour due to herniation of abdominal fat or organs as abdominal distention.\n\n-Cell types in a non-septic exudate are similar to a modified transudate, except for feline infectious peritonitis, where the predominant cells are nondegenerate neutrophils, and in some neoplastic effusions, where malignant cells predominate. -Cells in a septic exudate are predominantly neutrophils. The fluid is further characterized by the presence of intracellular bacteria, degenerate changes in the neutrophils and a foul odor. -Degenerate and non-degenerate neutrophils are distinguished on the appearance of their nuclei. Non-degenerate neutrophils appear similar to peripheral blood neutrophils and have tightly clumped, basophilic nuclear chromatin.\n\nAs the neutrophils age, the nuclei become hypersegmented, and then pyknotic (tightly clumped sphere), and then eventually break up into several smaller tightly clumped spheres (karyorrhexis). This aging change should not be confused with degenerative change. Degenerate neutrophils have swollen pale eosinophilic nuclei resulting from increased membrane permeability to water. Toxic changes in the cytoplasm (basophilia, vacuolation and Dohle bodies) may also be present. -In a recent report, a nucleated cell count > 13 \u00d7 10 9 /L (13 000/\u03bcl) was highly sensitive and specific for septic peritonitis, although cats with FIP were not included. -Protein content characteristic of an exudate may be confirmed by Rivalta's test (see Feline infectious peritonitis). -Chyle -opaque and white to pink (slightly cloudy and straw-colored in fasting animals), SG variable, protein 2.0-7.0 g/L (20-70 g/dl), and total nucleated cell count < 10 \u00d7 10 9 /L (10 000/\u03bcl) containing a large number of small lymphocytes (chyle is comprised of lymph and chylomicrons). The fluid in the tube separates into a cream-like layer when refrigerated. Chylous effusions are also characterized by fluid triglyceride level greater than serum triglyceride level, fluid cholesterol level lower than serum cholesterol level, and a fluid cholesterol:triglyceride ratio < 1 (with the values measured in mg/dl). -Blood -cloudy and red (centrifugation results in a clear supernatant above red sediment), SG, protein and total nucleated cell count consistent with peripheral blood. Effusion may contain clots but does not clot further after withdrawal. Platelets disappear within several hours, and erythrophagocytosis by macrophages begins within 1 day, and this can be used to help age the effusion. -Bile -clear to cloudy and dark yellow with a green or orange tinge, SG > 1.018, protein > 25 g/L (2.5 g/dl), total nucleated cells > 5 \u00d7 10 9 /L (5000/\u03bcl) with cell composition similar to modified transudate, but may become a highly cellular septic exudate. Bilirubin may be confirmed using a urine dipstick or by seeing bilirubin crystals free in the fluid or in macrophages. -Urine -clear to slightly cloudy and pale yellow, variable SG and protein content. It may be a transudate, but total nucleated cells are often > 3 \u00d7 10 9 /L (3000/\u03bcl) with cell composition similar to modified transudate, and it may become a highly cellular septic exudate. \u2022 While in theory a specific disease process causes a specific type of fluid, in reality the type of fluid may vary somewhat. In particular, the disorders that generally cause pure transudates are occasionally associated with modified transudates, and vice versa. This may be due to modification of fluid production by concurrent disorders as well as variable criteria for characterizing the fluids. The implication of this fact is that a specific differential diagnosis should not be ruled out strictly on the grounds that the type of fluid is not the classic type for that disorder.\n\n-Although protein content is one of the classic clinicopathologic values by which to categorize fluids, protein levels were recently reported to be similar in septic and non-septic peritoneal fluids. \u2022 The peritoneal cavity is lined by a serous membrane (serosa) and normally contains a small amount of fluid that serves as a lubricant for the abdominal organs. Normal peritoneal fluid is a transudate (ultrafiltrate) that comes from interstitial fluid produced by local capillary beds, which diffuses across the serosa into the peritoneal cavity. The serosa is equally permeable to diffusion of the fluid back into the interstitium, but most is reabsorbed from the abdomen by uptake by lymphatics, especially of the diaphragm. The ultrafiltrate contains protein that is in equilibrium with plasma protein. The mechanisms that promote formation of subcutaneous edema will thus promote formation of peritoneal fluid. These mechanisms are:\n\n-Reduced plasma colloidal osmotic (oncotic) pressure due to hypoalbuminemia. Hypoalbuminemia occurs by the same mechanisms as in dogs, i.e. reduced hepatic production, or renal, gastrointestinal or cutaneous loss. Hypoalbuminemia severe enough to cause spontaneous effusions or edema (typically \u2264 10-15 g/L [1-1.5 g/dl) is rare in cats. As albumin levels drop there is a progressive risk for exacerbation of ascites formed by other mechanisms, for example, increased hydrostatic pressure. When spontaneous fluid accumulation occurs, subcutaneous edema may develop preferentially to pleural and peritoneal effusions. Peritoneal fluid is a transudate. -Increased capillary hydrostatic pressure. This may occur from fluid overload, decreased arteriolar resistance, and increased venous pressure. Cats with fluid overload usually develop pulmonary or subcutaneous edema preferentially to pleural and peritoneal effusions. Fluid overload causes a transudate. -Portal venous hypertension is an increase in venous pressure unique to the abdomen. It is classified anatomically as pre-hepatic (which is also pre-sinusoidal), hepatic (pre-sinusoidal, sinusoidal, or post-sinusoidal), or post-hepatic (which is also post-sinusoidal) in origin. Anatomic location affects protein content of the ascitic fluid and is relevant to differential diagnoses. Pre-sinusoidal disorders usually cause a pure transudate. Sinusoidal and post-sinusoidal disorders increase hepatic sinusoidal pressure, which, in addition to portal hypertension, causes effusion of hepatic lymph from the hepatic lymphatics through the surface of the liver. Hepatic lymph is high in protein. Chyle in the peritoneal cavity is an uncommon nonspecific finding indicating that lymphatic rupture has occurred. Chylous effusion may occur with any of the basic mechanisms that promote peritoneal fluid production except for hypoalbuminemia. Most cases are caused by neoplasia, and fewer are caused by inflammation, right heart failure and liver disease. Other causes are rare in cats, including primary abdominal lymphangiectasia and traumatic rupture of a major lymphatic vessel.\n\nBlood in the peritoneal cavity results from injury to blood vessels, spontaneous or traumatic rupture of abnormal blood-filled spaces, or a coagulopathy. Hemoperitoneum is not as common in cats as dogs, because abdominal trauma does not commonly cause severe abdominal hemorrhage in cats, and hemangiosarcoma is rare. Other causes of hemoperitoneum in the dog such as anticoagulant rodenticide poisoning, perforated gastrointestinal ulcers, and splenic torsions, are also uncommon in cats. Clinical signs due to acute anemia and local effects of hemorrhage vary with the severity of bleeding. Signs of acute hypovolemia, e.g. weakness, lethargy, hypothermia, pale mucus membranes, tachycardia and weak pulses, occur with a smaller volume of blood loss than do abdominal distention. In most cases of hemoperitoneum in cats, abdominal distention is not noted. In converse, cats with abdominal distention due to acute blood loss will have signs of hypovolemia.\n\nBile in the peritoneal cavity results from traumatic injury to the gall bladder or bile ducts. It is rare in cats. The presence of bile may be associated with septic or non-septic peritonitis, with increases in bacteria and/or protein and neutrophils accordingly.\n\nUrine in the peritoneal cavity usually results from traumatic injury to the urinary bladder. It is uncommon in cats. Rarely direct effusion of urine may occur with severe cystitis. The presence of urine may be associated with septic or non-septic peritonitis, with increases in bacteria and/or protein and neutrophils accordingly. Rupture of the bladder may also cause abdominal hemorrhage.\n\nFat accumulates because of overeating and underactivity. Fat accumulates within the abdomen as well as within the abdominal subcutaneous tissue, especially of the caudal ventral abdomen.\n\nFood may cause increased distention of the stomach and small intestine after a large meal. This is a physiologic cause of organomegaly.\n\nFeces may cause increased distention of the large intestine after a large meal. This is a physiologic cause of organomegaly. More often, increased accumulation of feces in the large intestine is a sign of constipation. Severe constipation (obstipation, megacolon) may result in marked abdominal distention.\n\nFlatus (gastrointestinal air) is not physiologically common in cats. Flatus may develop secondary to aerophagia in dyspneic cats and as a sign of primary intestinal disorders. Gastric dilation-volvulus is rare. Abdominal distention may also develop from pneumoperitoneum. Sources of air include gastric perforation, gastrointestinal rupture, extension of air from the thoracic cavity, penetrating abdominal wounds and intra-abdominal gas-forming bacteria.\n\nFetuses are a cause of physiologic organomegaly.\n\nFormidable organomegaly usually results from markedly distended hollow organs (bladder, intestinal tract, uterus) or neoplasia. Granulomatous inflammation, cyst and pseudocyst formation is less common. Rare causes include heterotopic ossification. Acute inflammation of an organ usually causes minimal to moderate organomegaly and does not cause abdominal distention.\n\nFeeble abdominal musculature is caused by hyperadrenocorticism.\n\nAbdominal distention and/or fluid may be signs of: \u2022 A primary abdominal disorder or physiologic change. Any abdominal organ may be involved. \u2022 An extra-abdominal disorder.\n\n\u2022 A systemic disorder.\n\nPeritoneal fluid may be accompanied by pleural fluid, pericardial fluid or subcutaneous edema.\n\nA large volume of abdominal fluid, in addition to causing abdominal distention, may cause dyspnea (diaphragmatic compression), anorexia (compression of the stomach), increased frequency of urination (compression of the bladder), abdominal discomfort, and difficulty walking. A large volume of fluid can also compress the caudal vena cava and decrease venous return to the heart.\n\nThe chief complaint may be abdominal distention, perceived weight gain, signs due to abdominal distention, or signs of an underlying or associated disease.\n\nMost causes of abdominal distention may result in minimal to marked distention, but most commonly result in minimal to mild distention. The most common causes of abdominal distention in cats are physiologic -pregnancy and obesity. The most common pathologic cause of moderate to marked abdominal distention is abdominal effusion. The most common causes of marked abdominal effusion are right heart failure, feline infectious peritonitis and neoplasia.\n\nFat is easily confused with fluid, both peripherally and in the abdomen, and the two cannot always be distinguished by palpation alone. However, cats with severe abdominal distention due to fluid will have a more taught abdomen than severely obese cats, and body contour will change more with position when distention is due to fluid. Fluid is confirmed on physical examination only if a fluid thrill or abdominal organ is noted with ballottement, which requires a large volume of fluid. Smaller amounts of fluid may cause the abdominal organs, especially the loops of intestine, to feel more slippery than usual, or to be less distinct than usual, on palpation.\n\nOrganomegaly is easily detected on abdominal palpation, with the exception of hepatomegaly where falciform fat may preclude palpation of the liver. \u2022 Mild distention of the intestines with air may make them less distinct than usual on palpation. \u2022 Free-living toms may have firm abdominal musculature and be more difficult to palpate.\n\nAbdominal pain may be signaled by contraction of abdominal musculature, vocalization on abdominal palpation, attempting to escape, and defensive aggression. Some clinicians believe that cats with abdominal pain may not react, and that inactivity and remaining hunched-up also signify abdominal pain. Abdominal pain may be caused by trauma, inflammation of a specific organ, peritonitis, acute over-distention of the bladder or gastrointestinal tract, and over-exuberant palpation. Abdominal pain may be mimicked by back pain (uncommon in cats), or the cat objecting to veterinary examination. Fluid distention due to transudates and modified transudates is not painful.\n\nAbdominal radiography, abdominal ultrasound examination, and abdominocentesis will reveal the cause of abdominal distention if clinical findings are inconclusive.\n\n\u2022 If imaging is planned it should be performed prior to abdominocentesis (1) to identify organomegaly, and (2) because a small amount of air may enter the abdomen during abdominocentesis, which may create imaging artifacts.\n\n-Radiography will not detect small volumes of fluid. There is progressive loss of abdominal detail with increasing amounts of fluid, and large-volume ascites creates a homogeneous softtissue density. Radiography is not very useful to distinguish the type of fluid, except that exudates tend to produce a \"ground-glass appearance\" because the presence of flocculent material produces variation in radiographic density. -Ultrasonography will detect small volumes of fluid, and may identify flocculent densities in exudates and debris on the serosa. \u2022 Abdominocentesis will usually be positive if there is > 4-5 ml/kg of fluid.\n\n-If fluid is detected during an ultrasound examination, ultrasound-guided aspiration of the fluid is recommended. -For blind abdominocentesis, the cat is best supported in the standing position or held in the restrainer's arms with the ventrum parallel to the ground. Ideally the bladder should be empty.\n\n-If a large volume of fluid is known to be present, a regular needle, butterfly needle, intravenous catheter or peritoneal lavage catheter attached to a syringe \u00b1 three-way stopcock may be used to remove the desired volume. Following surgical preparation of the skin, the needle or catheter is inserted along the ventral midline caudal to the umbilicus. -If the procedure is being used to diagnose the presence of a small volume of fluid, a 1-inch, 22-G needle should be inserted along the ventral midline caudal to the umbilicus, and the fluid allowed to drip out by gravity. Samples should be collected into an EDTA (purple top) tube and into a clot tube (red top). If no fluid appears, the needle should be gently twisted, and, if this is unsuccessful, a syringe may be attached and gentle suction applied. If midline abdominocentesis is negative, the abdomen may be \"divided\" into four quadrants with the umbilicus as the center point, and the procedure repeated in each quadrant, stopping when a sample is obtained. -Minimal analysis of the fluid consists of visual inspection, specific gravity, packed cell volume and total protein (measured by refractometer or urine dipstick), and cytologic examination using a routine hematology stain. Fluids with high cellularity may be examined using a smear similar to a blood smear or using a squash smear. Fluids with low cellularity should be centrifuged prior to examination and/or examined using a linesmear technique, a technique similar to a blood smear, but where the spreader slide is rapidly drawn back several millimeters before the end of the sample slide, thus concentrating the cells in a line. More extensive evaluation may include cell counts, bilirubin, urea, creatinine, potassium, glucose, bibarbonate, lactate, pH, albumin, globulin, cholesterol, triglyceride, amylase and lipase levels, RT-PCR for feline coronavirus, Gram-stain and microbial culture. -If abdominocentesis is unsuccessful, diagnostic peritoneal lavage may be performed.\n\n-The bladder is emptied and the cat is restrained in dorsal or left lateral recumbency. -The skin is surgically prepared. An intravenous catheter (which may be fenestrated with a scalpel blade, although this may make the catheter more difficult to advance and more prone to kinking or breakage) or peritoneal dialysis/lavage catheter (preferred) is inserted caudally, or right laterally, to the umbilicus (dissection may be used), and directed caudally and towards the right. -20 ml/kg warm saline is infused by gravity or injected over 2-5 minutes. The cat is gently rolled from side-to-side (catheter in place), and then after 2-5 minutes a diagnostic sample is retrieved by gravity or by aspiration (it is neither necessary nor possible to retrieve all the infused fluid). The catheter is removed and the skin incision sutured. -Complications from presence of a large volume of ascites may necessitate large-volume abdominocentesis. This is normally a safe procedure, however: -The fluid may rapidly re-accumulate, especially if intra-abdominal pressure from the fluid (tamponade) was in equilibrium with the forces promoting fluid accumulation. Very rapid re-accumulation could lead to acute hypovolemia. This is most likely to occur with hypoproteinemia and right-sided heart failure. -Repetitive large-volume abdominocentesis will promote hypoproteinemia because of repetitive loss of protein in the ascitic fluid. -For these reasons it is recommended to remove enough fluid to resolve secondary problems, but not to try to empty the abdomen.\n\nThe prognosis for cats with peritoneal effusion is generally poor, especially if accompanied by pleural effusion.\n\n\u2022 Disproportionately large abdomen compared to head, thorax and distal limbs.\n\nObesity results from caloric intake in excess of that required for basal metabolism and physical activity.\n\nOverfeeding prior to maturity may cause adipocyte proliferation predisposing to obesity in maturity.\n\nAdipocyte numbers gradually increase with aging and basal metabolic rate decreases.\n\nSome cats are probably more likely to become obese by genetic predisposition.\n\nNeutering promotes obesity in part because sex hormones affect appetite and protein and fat metabolism. Neutered cats have lower basal energy requirements and are also less likely to roam.\n\n\u2022 Neutered male cats are more prone to obesity than neutered female cats. \u2022 Obesity in neutered male cats is primarily due to increased food intake.\n\nPhysical activity is reduced in many housecats and with aging. Reduced physical activity reduces caloric needs, and also results in reduced muscle mass, which in turn lowers basal metabolic rate.\n\nOffering highly palatable foods and boredom may increase calorie intake.\n\nThis effect is most pronounced with megesterol acetate and benzodiazepines, but may occur occasionally with glucocorticoids and phenobarbital. Various drugs may also reduce physical activity.\n\nEndocrine disorders causing obesity are rare in cats.\n\n\u2022 Hypothyroidism is usually caused by treatment of hyperthyroidism. Naturally occurring hypothyroidism in mature cats is rare, but may be idiopathic or immune-mediated as in the dog. \u2022 Acromegaly may cause initial obesity by appetite stimulation and weight gain by stimulation of bone and muscle growth. Cats with acromegaly ultimately develop diabetes mellitus, which causes weight loss. \u2022 Hyperadrenocorticism may cause initial obesity by appetite stimulation. Many cats with hyperadrenocorticism develop diabetes mellitus, which causes weight loss. \u2022 Insulinoma could theoretically promote obesity because of the anabolic effects of insulin, but this has not been reported.\n\nObesity causes or increases the risk for insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, diabetes mellitus, hepatic lipidosis, feline lower urinary tract disease, musculoskeletal problems, bacterial skin infections, increased risk of surgical and anesthetic complications and impaired immune function. Obesity as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and neoplasia in cats has not been reported.\n\nObesity is typically most pronounced in the abdominal region, although the thorax, neck and upper limbs will also have increased subcutaneous fat.\n\n\u2022 If abdominal distention is due to intra-abdominal fat, it will be accompanied by deposition of subcutaneous fat. Large subcutaneous fat depots may accumulate in the inguinal area.\n\nSigns of adult-onset hypothyroidism include lethargy, inappetence, mild hypothermia and heat-seeking behavior, skin changes (dry lusterless hair, scale formation, alopecia, myxedema), bradycardia and reproductive problems. Obesity may be severe.\n\nSigns of acromegaly include signs of diabetes mellitus, facial and carpopedal dysmorphism, and cardiomegaly. Signs of hyperadrenocorticism include signs of diabetes mellitus, abdominal distention, alopecia and fragile skin. The signs of insulinoma are those of hypoglycemia.\n\nDiagnosis of obesity is usually made on the basis of physical examination. Abdominal radiography or ultrasound examination can be used to confirm obesity as a cause of abdominal distention if necessary.\n\nThere is usually a history of a highly palatable, highcalorie diet being consumed and physical inactivity.\n\nThere is absence of other clinical signs of other causes of abdominal distention.\n\nIf there are signs of endocrinopathy, it should be confirmed by appropriate testing. Endocrinopathies are rare causes of obesity.\n\n\u2022 Hypothyroidism may be suspected on the basis of clinical signs, a low T4 and/or free T4 (measured by equilibrium dialysis validated for cats), and absence of evidence for a concurrent disorder causing euthyroid sick syndrome.\n\n-If there is a history of treatment for hyperthyroidism, the above findings plus response to therapy are sufficient for a diagnosis. -If naturally occurring hypothyroidism is suspected, additional testing is recommended. Similar to testing for hypothyroidism in dogs, interpretation of tests is controversial. -TSH response tests using animal-origin TSH have been used in the past, but such TSH is no longer widely available. Recombinant human TSH is now available, and protocols using this preparation should be defined in the future. -TRH response test may be used: Obtain baseline serum sample, give 0.1 mg/kg IV, obtain post serum sample at 4 hours. A normal response is a > 50% increase from baseline. -The assay for canine TSH has been used anecdotally but has not been validated for the cat. -Thyroid biopsy may be obtained, demonstrating atrophy or thyroiditis. -If there is a response to therapy, thyroid supplement can then be withdrawn to observe for recurrence of signs.\n\nThe principal cause of abdominal distention that may be confused with fat is fluid. However, many cats with ascites are chronically ill and have muscle wasting.\n\nPregnancy -in pregnant cats the degree of abdominal distention may be disproportionate to the amount of subcutaneous fat.\n\nObesity is a common disorder and may make diagnosis of other concurrent causes of abdominal distention difficult by interfering with palpation.\n\nFor successful management of obesity, it is essential that the owner is committed to the goal that their cat achieves a healthy body weight. The owner needs to understand and believe that appropriate management of obesity leads to a more active and healthier pet, and a longer life of their pet. The evidence that only 53% of obese cats were alive after 4 years compared to 83% of cats with optimum body weight may help to convince some owners of the importance of weight loss.\n\nPrimary obesity is best treated by offering a hypocaloric diet designed for weight loss in cats. These diets generally have reduced fat and higher carbohydrate than maintenance diets, and a higher concentration of essential nutrients. Some are also high in fiber. Newer weight-loss diets for cats have restricted carbohydrate (<25% ME) and are high in protein.\n\nA satiety effect of insoluble fiber (e.g. cellulose) used as a bulking agent has not been proven in cats, and foods rich in such fiber increase the risk of constipation. Fermentable fiber may promote satiety.\n\nBecause some obese cats have very low metabolic rates, it is best to calculate the amount of energy being consumed by the cat, and then reduce energy fed to 80% of current consumption. Using current energy consumption as a basis for restricting calories, makes it more likely that successful weight loss will be achieved in the first month of the program, which makes it more likely the owner will continue the program.\n\n\u2022 If current energy consumption cannot be determined, a guideline is to offer 60-75% of energy theoretically required for maintenance of ideal body weight (i.e. 60-75% of 60 kcal/kg ideal body weight/day) and adjust every 2-4 weeks to achieve a loss of about 1% of body weight per week.\n\nAt 1% weight loss per week, about 90% of weight will be lost from fat and <10% from lean body tissue. More severe calorie restriction decreases the proportion lost from fat and increases the proportion of weight lost from lean body tissue. Losses of body weight greater than 2% per week are dangerous as hepatic lipidosis may develop. During a weight loss program it is important to verify that the cat is eating regularly. Fasting will increase the risk for developing hepatic lipidosis.\n\nIt is important not to restrict calories by restricting protein.\n\nDietary additives may help promote weight loss and/or ameliorate secondary glucose intolerance, and are being added to commercial diets for cats. \u2022 l-carnitine increases fatty acid oxidation and promotes fat loss, while preserving muscle mass. It also appears beneficial in treating cats with hepatic lipidosis. Supplemental l-carnitine can be dosed orally (250 mg/cat q 24 h of pharmacological grade product added to food or formulated as aqueous suspension). \u2022 Vitamin A promotes weight loss by stimulating uncoupling protein formation, which increases energy loss as heat. Vitamin A also decreases leptin (a hormone involved in fat metabolism) concentrations, which may improve insulin sensitivity. \u2022 Chromium, fermentable fiber and low glycemic index starch sources (corn, sorghum) may improve glucose tolerance status by improving insulin sensitivity, increasing insulin secretion and decreasing post-prandial glucose concentrations, respectively. \u2022 Increasing physical activity is also beneficial, but is not as easy to achieve in cats as in dogs. The most practical approach is to encourage the owner to engage in regular active play with the cat, such as having the cat chase an object on a string or a light spot, although it is not known what constitutes a proper \"feline exercise program\". Other alternatives for indoor cats are to provide an outdoor enclosure or leash-controlled outdoor activity sessions.\n\n-Cats given environmental enrichments such as additional food dishes, water bowls and litter boxes, plus climbing towers, window perches, scratching posts, cat spas, grooming supplies and toys, had increased activity levels and greater weight loss compared to cats that did not have an enriched environment Surgical debulking of fat or liposuction has not been reported in cats and is not recommended.\n\nThe use of drugs is currently not recommended. Dehydroepiandrosterone may cause severe adverse reactions in cats. Thyroid hormone should only be used in cases of proven hypothyroidism. The initial dose is 0.05-1.0 mg once a day, with a goal of maintaining serum T4 between 20-40 nmol/L 4-6 hours after dosing.\n\nThe prognosis for weight reduction is dependent upon compliance.\n\nThe prognosis for complications of obesity depends upon the severity of obesity and other factors affecting the complicating disorder.\n\nThe prognosis for hypothyroidism is excellent.\n\nThe ration should be restricted or a hypocaloric diet offered as soon as the propensity for obesity is noticed. Physical activity should be encouraged.\n\n\u2022 Mild to marked abdominal distention in breeding cats.\n\nIntentional or unintentional breeding.\n\nPrevious signs of estrus.\n\nAbdominal distention usually does not become apparent until the last 1-2 weeks of gestation. It is easiest to detect in queens that are thin, have a short haircoat, have had previous pregnancies, and have large litters.\n\nMammary gland development (\"milk bar\") usually does not become apparent until the last week of gestation, although pinking of the nipples may be noted sooner. Abdominal distention is usually noted before development of a milk bar.\n\nNesting behavior does not begin until 1-2 days before delivery.\n\nHistory of estrus, indoor/outdoor lifestyle, escape from indoors, or intentional breeding.\n\nFetal membranes can usually be palpated from day 17-25 of gestation, and occasionally up to day 35. The fetuses palpate as distinct water-filled spheres (\"tiny bladders\"). An enlarged uterus is palpable as a tubular organ between the colon and bladder from day 25 of gestation and on.\n\nFetuses can be seen by ultrasound examination beginning day 11-14 of gestation; fetal heartbeats can be seen by day 22-24.\n\nFetal mineralization is first detectable by radiography beginning day 38 of gestation, but is most reliable for identifying fetal skeletons after day 45 of gestation. This corresponds to the period that abdominal distention becomes apparent.\n\n\u2022 The above times are based on breeding dates and are not as reliable as times based on days prior to parturition. In a recent report, fetal mineralization was first detectable 25-29 days prior to parturition, and the vertebral column detectable by day 22-27 prior to parturition. The pattern of progressive mineralization was used to accurately predict day of parturition.\n\nCats with uncomplicated pregnancies are healthy, and as such the main differential diagnosis is obesity. However, obese cats are more often neutered, and obese cats also have evidence of increased subcutaneous inguinal fat. Palpation of an enlarged uterus is usually possible in pregnant cats, and palpation findings can be confirmed by imaging.\n\nIf a sick cat with abdominal distention with an unknown pregnancy is presented for examination, all other causes for abdominal distention should be considered. If the only cause of abdominal distention found during work-up appears to be an enlarged uterus, then acute metritis or spontaneous abortion should be considered, as well as an unrelated disorder complicating pregnancy.\n\nOvariohysterectomy if the pregnancy is unwanted.\n\nGood -dystocia is uncommon in cats.\n\nOvariohysterectomy; isolate from toms during heat.\n\n\u2022 Depression, anorexia, weight loss, fever, pleural or peritoneal effusion.\n\nFIP is caused by strains of feline coronavirus (FCoV). These virulent stains have the ability to replicate in macrophages as well as in epithelial cells. The viru-lent FIP strains arise from mutations in the avirulent (enteric) strains during replication of the latter. Both type I (genuine) FCoV and type II FCoV (which result from recombination between FCoV and canine coronavirus) can give rise to FIP strains.\n\nThe virus initially replicates in epithelial cells of the pharynx, respiratory system and intestinal tract.\n\nAntibodies are produced, which fail to eliminate the virus and facilitate its uptake by macrophages, where the virus further replicates.\n\nMacrophages migrate in the blood to venules of various tissues, e.g. the serosa of the abdomen. The macrophages exit the venules, and virus replication continues. Antigen-antibody complexes form around the venules, attracting neutrophils. The result is a pyogranulomatous vasculitis, resulting in effusion.\n\nFIP is more common in cats infected with feline leukemia virus (FeLV) in areas where FeLV is frequent.\n\nMost common in cats 3 months to 3 years old. There may also be an increased prevalence in geriatric cats.\n\nFIP occurs in two main forms: wet (effusive) and dry. Non-specific signs (depression, anorexia, weight loss, fever) are common in both forms.\n\nIn wet FIP, pericardial, pleural and/or peritoneal effusions occur.\n\n\u2022 Initially abdominal organs, especially the intestines, may not feel as distinct as usual. \u2022 Later, as fluid accumulates, marked painless distention of the abdomen occurs.\n\nIn dry FIP, signs are referable to the organ involved.\n\n\u2022 FIP may cause chronic hepatitis, which could result in abdominal distention from hepatomegaly and ascites from portal hypertension. \u2022 Massive mesenteric lymphadenopathy has also been reported.\n\nNo routinely performed test has 100% sensitivity or specificity, and diagnosis always relies on a combination of clinical signs and laboratory test results.\n\nA complete blood count may reveal a mature neutrophilia (chronic inflammation), lymphopenia (stress), and high plasma total protein (increased globulins and fibrinogen).\n\nA serum chemistry profile may reveal hyperglobulinemia and a decreased albumin to globulin ratio. (Total serum protein is less than plasma protein because of the absence of fibrinogen.) Liver enzymes \u00b1 bilirubin will be elevated if there is hepatic involvement. Abdominal radiography or ultrasonography will demonstrate peritoneal fluid, typically containing echogenic debris.\n\nAbdominocentesis. Cytologic, biochemical and immunologic tests on the abdominal fluid are more useful than blood tests. These tests include: \u2022 Cytology. Peritoneal fluid from a cat with wet FIP will typically reveal a non-septic exudate. The fluid is pale to straw-colored, may contain white flecks (fibrin) and may clot upon standing. Cytology reveals a high-protein background (stippling, crescent formation) and mature neutrophils. Chylous effusion may also occur. \u2022 Total protein, albumin and globulin levels. As in serum, but of more diagnostic value: the higher the total protein and globulin level, and lower the albumin to globulin ratio, the more likely the cat has FIP. Total protein \u2265 120 g/L (12 g/dl) had a specificity of 99% and positive predictive value of 89% in one study, while gamma-globulins \u2265 30 g/L (3.0 g/dl) and gamma-globulin content >32% in the fluid as demonstrated by protein electrophoresis have been reported to have 100% specificity and positive predictive values for FIP. An albumin to globulin ratio of 1 was reported to have a negative predictive value of 91% (and a higher ratio would presumably have a higher negative predictive value.) -Rivalta's test is useful to confirm that the fluid is an exudate, by testing for coagulation of protein in an acetic acid solution. Five ml of distilled water and one drop of 98% (glacial) acetic acid are mixed in a test tube. Vinegar should be a practical alternative to use as a point-of-care test.\n\nOne drop of the effusion is carefully layered on the surface of the solution. If the drop disappears and the solution remains clear, the test is negative and the fluid is a transudate. If the drop retains its shape, remains on the surface, or slowly floats down, the test is positive and the fluid is an exudate. Rivalta's test may also be positive in septic peritonitis and lymphoma (i.e. other causes of exudates), but these disorders can usually be ruled in or out with other tests. -Glucose may be detected with a urine dipstick but the diagnostic value of glucose level is not known. -Direct immunofluorescence of FCoV antigen in the peritoneal fluid macrophages. This has been reported to have a specificity and positive predictive value of 100%, and negative predictive value of 57-89%. -Utility of measuring FCoV antibody in the effusion varies, but it is at least as good as, and probably better, than a serum test. -Preliminary results indicate that RT-PCR for FCoV in the effusion is of high sensitivity and specificity. -Adenosine deaminase activity. The level in the fluid is usually higher than with other causes, but the test is not routinely available.\n\nAn FeLV test should be performed.\n\nExploratory surgery or laparoscopy with reveal multifocal small (e.g. 1-5 mm) white serosal plaques. Biopsies of abdominal lesions seen at surgery or laparascopy reveal pyogranulomatous to granulomatous inflammation. Immunohistochemistry may be used to demonstrate FCoV antigen within tissues. Viral culture may be available through research facilities.\n\nDifferential diagnoses for cats with non-specific signs and peritoneal fluid include neoplasia, pancreatitis and right heart failure.\n\nThe main differential diagnoses for abdominal distention due to a non-septic exudate are steatitis and cholangiohepatitis. With steatitis, the abdomen is usually painful on palpation and abdominal fat is yellow to brown.\n\nDifferential diagnoses for liver disease include cholangiohepatitis, lipidosis and neoplasia.\n\nSupportive care.\n\nLarge-volume abdominocentesis.\n\nCorticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents at standard doses have been used with limited success.\n\nAntiviral drugs have been used with limited success.\n\nRecombinant human and recombinant feline interferons appear to prolong survival in some cats.\n\nRecombinant feline interferon has been used at a dose of 1 million U/kg SC every other day until remission of clinical signs, followed by 1 million U/kg SC once a week. Prednisolone has been given concurrently at an initial dose of 2 mg/kg once a day and then tapered to 0.5 mg/kg every other day. A common recommendation is to use low-dose human recombinant interferonalpha at 30 U/cat/day PO for 7 days on alternate weeks, although there are little firm data documenting benefit.\n\nThe thromboxane synthetase inhibitor ozagrel hydrochloride, 5-10 mg/kg, combined with prednisolone, 2 mg/kg, dramatically improved clinical signs in two cases, but ozagrel is not readily available.\n\nDapsone is effective in the treatment of vasculitis but has not been evaluated for FIP.\n\nEffusive FIP is almost always fatal within a few days to months of onset of signs.\n\nFIP is most common in multiple cat households where cats are exposed to FCoV.\n\nFCoV transmission occurs by inhalation of virus shed from oronasal secretions or ingestion of virus shed in feces.\n\nAn important time of transmission is from asymptomatic queens to kittens at 5-7 weeks of age.\n\nIn utero infection may occur, but this usually leads to abortion or neonatal loss.\n\nRoutine disinfection is important because the virus is readily inactivated.\n\nDo not introduce FCoV test-positive cats into a household. Identifying FCoV carriers prior to introduction in a multi-cat facility is the main value of FIP tests.\n\nFor catteries with a history of FCoV infections, isolate queens 2-3 weeks before parturition, quarantine queen and kittens after parturition, and then wean kittens at 4-5 weeks of age and isolate. \n\nMulticentric nodal lymphoma, characterized by peripheral lymphadenopathy, frequently involves the liver and/or spleen. This form is often associated with FeLV infection and is occasionally associated with FIV infection.\n\nAlimentary lymphoma may affect various sites in the gastrointestinal tract and mesenteric lymph nodes, and may extend into the liver, spleen or kidneys. Extra-abdominal sites (e.g. lung, bone marrow) may also be involved. Alimentary lymphoma is infrequently associated with FeLV infection, and is occasionally associated with FIV infection. \u2022 It has long been believed that chronic inflammatory bowel disease may progress to lymphoma.\n\nAlternatively, severe inflammatory bowel disease may actually represent an indolent lymphoma. A progressive course of disease is more consistent with lymphoma while a waxing and waning course is more consistent with inflammatory bowel disease. \u2022 Alimentary lymphoma has historically been considered to be primarily of B-cell origin. There is increasing evidence of T-cell alimentary lymphoma, especially with low-grade lymphomas.\n\nSolitary hepatic, splenic or renal lymphoma may also occur. \n\nAbdominal radiography or ultrasonography may demonstrate an intestinal mass or intestinal thickening, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, lymphadenopathy or peritoneal fluid. Biopsy of gastrointestinal tract or other abdominal organ.\n\n\u2022 In addition to making a diagnosis, the biopsy should be used to grade the lymphoma with respect to its aggressiveness. High-grade lymphomas are poorly differentiated and may be further characterized as immunoblastic or lymphoblastic. Lowgrade lymphomas are well differentiated and may also be referred to as lymphocytic. Intermediate forms also occur. The percentage of cell types varies between studies, but overall low-grade lymphomas are less common than intermediate and high-grade lymphomas. \u2022 Lymphocytic gastrointestinal lymphoma may have a tendency to be epitheliotropic (to involve the mucosa) and to be of T-cell origin.\n\nFeLV and FIV tests should be obtained.\n\nIron-deficiency anemia from chronic gastrointestinal hemorrhage may occur with alimentary lymphoma.\n\nPeritoneal fluid may be a transudate, modified transudate, septic exudate, chylous or hemorrhagic effusion, and may contain neoplastic cells.\n\nDifferential diagnoses for generalized lymphadenopathy include atypical hyperplasia, hyperplasia in response to generalized skin diseases, immunologic disorders and systemic infections, widely metastatic neoplasia, and generalized bacterial or fungal lymphadenitis.\n\nDifferential diagnoses for lethargy, anorexia, weight loss, vomiting and diarrhea include inflammatory bowel disease, other gastrointestinal neoplasia, pancreatitis, systemic mycoses and cholangiohepatitis. Other than inflammatory bowel disease, these disorders may also cause lethargy, anorexia and weight loss without vomiting and diarrhea.\n\nDifferential diagnoses for marked splenomegaly include mast cell tumor and other tumors.\n\nChemotherapy as described in Chapter 31 Aggressive lymphomas should be treated aggressively and indolent lymphomas should be treated more conservatively.\n\nCats with high-grade lymphoma should be treated with a multi-agent protocol.\n\nCats with low-grade lymphoma (usually alimentary) may be treated with less aggressive protocols such as prednisone and chlorambucil.\n\nSplenectomy may be considered for splenic lymphoma if there is no evidence of lymphoma at another site. Because there is always the possibility of undetected microscopic lymphoma at another site, surgery should be reserved for cats where there is poor response to, or unacceptable side effects with, chemotherapy.\n\nSurgical removal of a gastrointestinal lymphomatous mass should be reserved for cats where the tumor is causing gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation. Surgical removal in addition to chemotherapy in other cases does not appear to be of added benefit.\n\nResponse to chemotherapy in several case series provides general information, but it is difficult to give a prognosis for an individual cat. Ultimately the only way to determine prognosis is to treat the cat and observe response.\n\nThe prognosis for multicentric lymphoma is discussed in The Cat With Enlarged Lymph Nodes.\n\nIn recent reports, about one-third to two-thirds of cats with alimentary lymphoma achieved a complete remission with chemotherapy, many of the other cats achieved a partial remission (with overall response rates up to 90%), and 1-year survival about 20-40%. Some of these cats will become long-term survivors and are considered to be cured.\n\nRegardless of anatomic location, usually only cats that achieve a complete remission with induction chemotherapy have the possibility of being cured.\n\nFeLV status, FIV status, sex, tumor burden and location, histologic grade and immunophenotype do not independently consistently predict achievement of remission, duration of remission or survival. Some of the weakness of prognostic factors may reflect different criteria for anatomic location and histologic grade as well as the poor statistical power of relatively small case series. Certain combination of factors may affect prognosis. For example, cats with well-differentiated intestinal epitheliotropic lymphoma have a better prognosis than with other forms of abdominal lymphoma. In one report, 69% achieved complete remission with a median survival of 22.8 months.\n\nMost cats tolerate chemotherapy for lymphoma and fatal complications of chemotherapy are rare.\n\n\u2022 Chronic anorexia, lethargy, weight loss.\n\nAnorexia, lethargy and weight loss.\n\nVariable fever, vomiting, diarrhea, icterus, palpable mass, depending upon the location of the tumor. \u2022 Absence of vomiting or diarrhea does not rule out a gastrointestinal tumor.\n\nAbdominal fluid \u00b1 abdominal distention may be present because of pre-hepatic or hepatic portal hypertension, lymphatic obstruction or hemorrhage. A large abdominal mass may contribute to abdominal distention.\n\n\u2022 Splenic or hepatic hemangiosarcoma is the most common neoplastic cause of hemoperitoneum, but it is much less common than in the dog. Other tumors may also spontaneously bleed. \u2022 Abdominal fluid has been recognized with many solid tumors, including those of the liver, pancreas, kidney, intestinal tract and peritoneum (mesothelioma).\n\nIron-deficiency anemia from chronic gastrointestinal hemorrhage may occur with gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas.\n\nAbdominal radiography or ultrasonography may demonstrate an abdominal mass, organomegaly or peritoneal fluid.\n\nBiopsy of suspected neoplastic tissue.\n\nAbdominal fluid may be a transudate, modified transudate, chylous or hemorrhagic effusion, and may contain neoplastic cells.\n\nDifferential diagnoses for a cat with subacute to chronic non-specific signs and peritoneal fluid include cholangiohepatitis, pancreatitis, tuberculosis, pyogranulomatous bacterial infections, systemic mycoses and toxoplasmosis.\n\nDifferential diagnoses for an abdominal mass include cyst, focal necrosis, abscess, granulomatous inflammation, intussusception and heterotopic ossification of the liver. Most of these will not commonly cause abdominal distention or fluid.\n\nDifferential diagnosis for a thickened peritoneum or peritoneum covered with multiple plaques or nodules other than mesothelioma or metastatic neoplasia include FIP, tuberculosis and sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis.\n\nMost solid tumors are best treated by surgical excision, but they are often unresectable by the time ascites develops.\n\nBenefit of chemotherapy for most abdominal solid tumors is not known, but effect is likely to be poor in most cases, and anorexia is common with aggressive combination protocols. Use of carboplatin or lomustine as single agents may be considered in that side effects in most cats are minimal.\n\nRadiation therapy may be considered, but in many cases will not be feasible.\n\nAbdominocentesis may be used to reduce signs attributable to marked abdominal distention.\n\nRutin, 50 mg/kg PO tid, may be considered to reduce effusion if it is chylous. (It may also be used to help alleviate chylous effusions due to other causes.)\n\nIntracavitary chemotherapy with carboplatin or thiotepa may be considered in an effort to alleviate effusion due to widespread metastasis or mesothelioma.\n\nDiuretics may reduce malignant ascites in some cases. Furosemide, 1 mg/kg PO/SC/IV once to twice daily, or spironolactone, 1-2 mg/kg PO, bid may be tried.\n\n\u2022 Depression, anorexia, weight loss, marked splenomegaly (splenic mast cell tumor). \u2022 Depression, anorexia, weight loss, vomiting, diarrhea (intestinal mast cell tumor).\n\nMast cell tumor is a spontaneously arising neoplasm and is not related to FeLV or FIV infection.\n\nSplenic mast cell tumor frequently metastasizes; organs involved, in decreasing order of frequency, are liver, abdominal or thoracic lymph nodes, bone marrow and peripheral blood, lung and intestine.\n\nIntestinal mast cell tumor most commonly involves the small intestine, and may involve multiple sites. Metastasis to liver and mesenteric lymph nodes is common; metastasis to spleen, lung and bone marrow may also occur. \n\nAbdominal radiography or ultrasonography may demonstrate splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, intestinal mass, lymphadenopathy or peritoneal fluid.\n\n\u2022 Sonographic abnormalities of the spleen include splenomegaly, irregular contour, mottled appearance, and hyperechoic and hypoechoic nodules. Lymph nodes may be hypoechoic. Intestinal masses are hypoechoic and there is loss of normal wall layering. Effusion is anechoic.\n\nFine-needle biopsy of spleen, gastrointestinal mass or other organ based on clinical signs will often reveal neoplastic mast cells. Surgical biopsy of intestinal masses may be required for diagnosis. Intraoperative cytology is recommended, so that wide surgical excision of the tumor(s) may follow.\n\n\u2022 Abdominal fluid usually contains mast cells with or without eosinophils. Occasionally no mast cells are present.\n\nOther laboratory findings include hyperglobulinemia and coagulation abnormalities.\n\nEosinophilia may occur with visceral mast cell tumors.\n\nThe main differential diagnosis for marked splenomegaly is lymphoma, but it does not typically cause the massive splenomegaly seen in cats with mast cell tumor.\n\nThe main differential diagnoses for an intestinal mass and abdominal distention are adenocarcinoma and lymphoma. Chronic intussusceptions are rare, and would not typically be associated with abdominal distention or fluid.\n\nThe presence of eosinophils in peritoneal fluid is not specific for mast cell tumor, and has also been seen with lymphoma, septic peritonitis and pneumothorax. However, the presence of mast cells is highly specific for visceral mast cell tumor.\n\nSplenectomy or excision with 5-10 cm margins of intestinal masses.\n\nThe benefit or detriment of chemotherapy in addition to surgery is not known. Prednisone alone or protocols used to treat lymphoma may be considered.\n\nThe prognosis for splenic mast cell tumor is good, even with evidence of widespread dissemination. Median survival post-splenectomy is 12-19 months, and peripheral mastocytosis declines.\n\nThe prognosis for intestinal mast cell tumor is poor, with most cats being euthanized soon after diagnosis or treatment.\n\n\u2022 Dyspnea due to pleural effusion.\n\nCats with right heart failure usually develop pleural effusion. Peritoneal effusion is a less common occurrence.\n\n\u2022 Peritoneal effusion has been observed with congenital tricuspid valve dysplasia, patent ductus arteriosus and intrapericardial heterotopic liver. \u2022 Peritoneal effusion has been observed with acquired pericardial effusion (which in-itself may be a sign of right heart failure), persistent atrial standstill, traumatic tricuspid valvular insufficiency, tricuspid valvular endocarditis, myocarditis, heartworm disease, severe chronic anemia, and dilated, hypertrophic and restrictive cardiomyopathy. Of these various disorders, dilated cardiomyopathy is most likely to cause peritoneal effusion.\n\nPulmonary edema may also be present due to left heart failure.\n\nPeritoneal effusion is usually accompanied by pleural effusion. Pleural effusion \u00b1 pulmonary edema will cause dyspnea.\n\n\u2022 Most peritoneal effusion due to right heart failure causes undetected to minimal abdominal distention.\n\n\u2022 Marked abdominal distention is occasionally the predominant clinical sign.\n\nOther signs of heart disease variably present include jugular distention, murmur, gallop rhythm, tachycardia, bradycardia and irregular rhythm.\n\nRadiography is useful to demonstrate pleural effusion and large-volume peritoneal effusion.\n\nEchocardiography will assess myocardial function, and valvular competency, and may demonstrate transdiaphragmatic peritoneal effusion. If echocardiography is not available, non-selective angiocardiography is useful to diagnose dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\n\nElectrocardiography will characterize arrhythmias.\n\nAbdominal ultrasonography will demonstrate peritoneal fluid.\n\nAbdominocentesis usually reveals a modified transudate.\n\nThe main differential diagnosis for a cat presented in acute heart failure characterized by cardiogenic shock, dyspnea and abdominal fluid is acute abdominal hemorrhage. Pulmonary crackles will usually be present in heart failure.\n\nThe main differential diagnosis for a cat with chronic heart failure characterized by pleural and peritoneal effusions is neoplasia. Other differential diagnoses include iatrogenic volume overload, hypoalbuminemia, feline infectious peritonitis and systemic bacterial and mycotic infections.\n\nThe treatment of heart failure is discussed in The Cat With an Enlarged Heart or Abnormal Heart Sounds.\n\nSpecific treatment of peritoneal effusion is usually not required.\n\nDiuretic therapy (e.g. furosemide, initial dose 1-2 mg/kg bid) will help reduce abdominal fluid.\n\nLarge-volume abdominocentesis should be considered for ascites not responsive to diuretic treatment that is causing diaphragmatic compression, stomach compression or abdominal discomfort.\n\nThe prognosis for cats with ascites due to right heart failure is poor, because of the poor prognosis of most of the underling heart diseases.\n\nFor a specific heart disease, it is not known if the presence of peritoneal effusion in addition to pleural effusion changes prognosis.\n\n\u2022 Acute depression, anorexia, dehydration, vomiting, anuria.\n\nCauses are listed in approximate decreasing order of frequency. These causes include: \u2022 Blunt abdominal trauma.\n\n-Motor vehicle trauma is the most common cause, followed by falling from heights, although a ruptured urinary bladder is not a common injury, especially compared to other traumatic injuries (e.g. pelvic fractures, facial injuries). Trauma usually causes rupture at the apex of the bladder. \u2022 Urethral catheterization.\n\n-This is most likely to occur when treating urethral obstruction. Rupture usually occurs in the urethra or neck of the bladder. Urethral obstruction may also spontaneously lead to urethral rupture without catheterization. \u2022 Expression of the urinary bladder.\n\n-This is most likely to occur when trying to express the bladder in an unsedated cat with urethral spasm following relief of urethral obstruction, or following cystocentesis. \u2022 Cystocentesis.\n\n-This rarely causes rupture of the bladder, but has occurred when performing cystocentesis on cats with a severely distended bladder following urethral obstruction. \u2022 Penetrating abdominal trauma.\n\n-Bite wounds, staking injuries and bullet wounds are uncommon causes of urinary tract trauma.\n\nAcute bladder rupture occasionally causes marked hemorrhage into the abdomen or into the bladder (with massive clot formation).\n\nClinical signs are due to post-renal uremia and associated disorders.\n\nNon-specific signs of uroperitoneum include variable depression, lethargy, anorexia and dehydration.\n\nBody temperature and heart rate may be elevated, normal or low. Vomiting is common. Abdominal pain may be present.\n\nMany cats are not urinating, but presence of urination does not rule out urinary tract rupture. (If urination is present, there may be hematuria.)\n\nSimilarly, a palpable bladder does not rule out rupture of either the bladder or urethra.\n\nAbdominal distention and a fluid wave are occasionally evident. Urethral rupture may also cause inguinal subcutaneous edema (there may also be signs of inflammation due to cellulitis).\n\nA serum chemistry profile will reveal mild to marked elevations in urea and creatinine levels unless the animal is tested shortly after injury. Hyperkalemia may also be present.\n\nAbdominal ultrasonography will demonstrate peritoneal fluid.\n\nPeritoneal fluid is initially a pale yellow to serosanguineous transudate, and cytology will be unremarkable, unless the cat is a tom, where sperm may be present. Cell counts may increase with time (> 3\u00d710 9 /L, 3000/\u03bcl) resulting in a modified transudate. Secondary septic peritonitis will result in an exudate with degenerate neutrophils and bacteria.\n\n\u2022 Creatinine or potassium levels in the abdominal fluid greater than that of the serum are strongly suggestive of uroperitoneum. (It is not sufficient to simply measure those parameters in the peritoneal fluid because azotemic animals with ascites will also have creatinine and potassium in the ascitic fluid.) The higher the abdominal fluid:serum creatinine and potassium ratios, the more likely the cat has uroperitoneum. In one study of cats with uroperitoneum, the abdominal fluid:serum creatinine ratio ranged from 1.1:1 to 4:1, with a mean of 2:1, and the abdominal fluid:serum potassium ratio ranged from 1.2:1 to 2.4:1, with a mean of 1.9:1. Abdominal fluid:serum urea ratios are not as reliable because of more rapid equilibration of urea.\n\nContrast radiography will demonstrate a rupture of the bladder or urethra. To demonstrate a rupture of the bladder, the radiograph should be obtained just as the final amount of contrast material is injected. If only a small amount of contrast material leaks out of the bladder, it may be rapidly diluted in the peritoneal fluid resulting in a false-negative study.\n\nDifferential diagnoses for a cat presented for no urination include ethylene glycol or lily poisoning, or urethral obstruction.\n\nDifferential diagnoses for a cat presented with acute depression and peritoneal fluid include right heart failure, acute pancreatitis, liver disease with ascites and hepatic encephalopathy, and acute abdominal hemorrhage (mucous membranes will be pale).\n\nOther rare causes of uroperitoneum include spontaneous leakage at the site of a bladder tumor, traumatic avulsion of a ureter, transudation of urine through a severely inflamed bladder wall and leakage post-nephrotomy. Radiographic contrast studies will facilitate diagnosis. An excretory urogram may be required to demonstrate an avulsed ureter.\n\nFluid therapy to correct dehydration and reduce uremia.\n\nAntibiotics if there is secondary septic peritonitis, e.g. ampicillin, cefoxitin at standard doses.\n\nLarge-volume abdominocentesis to reduce uremia. Peritoneal dialysis will further reduce uremia but is not usually required.\n\nRuptured urinary bladders are usually surgically repaired.\n\nNon-surgical management (catheterization to keep the bladder empty) has been described in other species. It may be considered if the cat is too unstable for surgery, but will not usually reduce costs because of the longer hospitalization period.\n\nRuptured urethras may be treated by surgical repair or by placement of an ante-pubic urinary catheter, or less optimally by chronic urethral catheterization.\n\nUroperitoneum in-itself carries a good prognosis. Uremia will rapidly resolve once the urinary tract is repaired. Chemical peritonitis from urine also usually rapidly resolves. Prognosis is largely determined by associated injuries.\n\n\u2022 Chronic straining to defecate.\n\nSee main reference on page 783 for details (The Constipated or Straining Cat).\n\nVariable anorexia, lethargy, weight loss, unkempt haircoat and vomiting.\n\nStraining to defecate, with the resultant minimal passage of feces that may be dry or mucoid.\n\nLarge volume of firm feces in the colon on abdominal palpation. Digital rectal examination may reveal narrowing of pelvic canal secondary to fractures or tumor. Neurologic examination may reveal sacral nerve injury.\n\nMarked colonic dilation may occur causing abdominal distention.\n\nAbdominal radiography will demonstrate marked accumulation of feces in the colon.\n\nThe main differential diagnosis for a cat with chronic dyschezia, tenesmus and abdominal distention is colonic neoplasia with metastases resulting in obstructive ascites.\n\nFor the cat with megacolon sufficiently severe to cause abdominal distention, subtotal colectomy is recommended.\n\nIf medical therapy is desired, correct dehydration, administer parenteral antibiotics (e.g. ampicillin) to protect against bacterial translocation, and administer multiple small volume enemas with lactulose prior to anesthetizing the cat for manual disimpaction. Use of enema soap will facilitate the latter (do not use chlorhexidine soaps). If disimpaction is successful, chronic therapy consists of a low-residue diet, lactulose and prokinetic agents (e.g. cisapride).\n\n\u2022 Mild excess in abdominal fluid encountered during pediatric ovariohysterectomy.\n\nMore peritoneal fluid may be encountered when spaying a cat at an early age (e.g. 3 months) than at a traditional age (e.g. 6 months).\n\nThe fluid is a transudate.\n\nFIP, where the fluid is a non-septic exudate.\n\nNone required.\n\n\u2022 Acute depression and anorexia.\n\n\u2022 Ascites may develop.\n\nSee main reference on page 272 (The Cat With Depression, Anorexia or Dehydration).\n\nCat may be of any age, with no sex or breed predilection, except perhaps for Siamese cats.\n\nDuration of clinical signs prior to presentation varies from several days to more than 3 weeks.\n\nDepression and/or anorexia are the most common historical signs and may be the only signs present. The most common physical abnormalities are dehydration and hypothermia. Fever is uncommon.\n\nOther inconsistent signs include weight loss, vomiting, diarrhea, cranial abdominal pain, cranial abdominal mass, dyspnea, ataxia and disorientation, and shock. Polydipsia may be present, but is usually due to concurrent diabetes mellitus.\n\n\u2022 Peritoneal effusion may occur, and in some cases may be of sufficient quantity to cause abdominal distention. Peritoneal effusion may be more likely to occur when there is concurrent liver disease. Pleural effusion may also occur.\n\nBecause clinical and laboratory findings are nonspecific, diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion.\n\nPancreatitis should be considered in any cat with unexplained acute depression. Pancreatitis should also be considered in any critically ill cat developing ascites, pleural effusion or hypothermia.\n\nLaboratory findings are variable and are most valuable in ruling out other causes of depression and anorexia. The most sensitive and specific tests are elevations in feline trypsin-like immunoreactivity and feline pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity. No laboratory abnormality appears to be correlated with the development or severity of effusion. \u2022 Peritoneal effusion is usually a modified transudate, but may be a non-septic exudate.\n\nDiagnostic imaging findings are also variable.\n\n\u2022 On abdominal radiographs, decreased contrast may be present due to effusion. This may be restricted to the cranial abdomen or be more generalized. \u2022 Other radiographic findings supportive of pancreatitis include a mass effect in the right cranial quadrant (displacement of organs), and localized dilation of loops of intestine (ileus). Normal findings do not rule out pancreatitis. \u2022 On abdominal ultrasonography, accumulation of peritoneal fluid around the pancreas is a highly specific finding for pancreatitis. Generalized peritoneal effusion is a less specific finding. \u2022 Other ultrasonographic findings with a high specificity for pancreatitis include pancreatic regular or irregular enlargement, pancreatic hypoechogenicity, hyperechogenicity of peripancreatic fat (may be difficult to appreciate), and dilation of the pancreatic duct in the left lobe. Normal findings do not rule out pancreatitis. \u2022 Definitive ante-mortem diagnosis requires biopsy obtained by exploratory laparotomy or laparoscopy.\n\nDifferential diagnoses for cats with pancreatitis causing acute depression and abdominal fluid include septic peritonitis, acute abdominal hemorrhage, right heart failure, ruptured urinary bladder, ruptured gall bladder, steatitis, toxoplasmosis, ligation of a portosystemic shunt and, uncommonly, hepatic encephalopathy where liver disease is also causing ascites.\n\nFor cats with pancreatitis causing subacute depression and abdominal fluid, the primary differential diagnoses are neoplasia, feline infectious peritonitis and right heart failure.\n\nSurgical debridement of grossly necrotic tissue and therapeutic abdominal lavage, or closed therapeutic abdominal lavage using a technique similar to diagnostic peritoneal lavage, should be considered if peritoneal fluid is an exudate.\n\nIf there is a large volume of ascites that is a modified transudate, therapeutic abdominocentesis should be considered, and it should definitely be performed if there is a problem secondary to a volume effect (e.g. dyspnea from diaphragmatic compression), but the benefit of the procedure on the course of the disease is not known.\n\n\u2022 Acute depression, anorexia, fever, abdominal pain.\n\nAcute onset of depression and anorexia; the cat may be moribund.\n\nVariable vomiting and diarrhea. These are most likely if the cause is a perforating intestinal foreign body.\n\nInitial fever, tachycardia \u00b1 dark pink mucous membranes, but these signs may progress rapidly to normothermia or hypothermia, bradycardia and pale mucous membranes with severe sepsis or septic shock (see The Cat With Acute Depression, Anorexia and Dehydration).\n\nPain is present on abdominal palpation in about 2/3 of cases. The cat is probably less likely to react if it is moribund. Mild abdominal distention may be present.\n\nPolypnea and icterus may be present.\n\nHistory or signs of abdominal surgery, sharp or blunt trauma to abdomen, linear or sharp gastrointestinal foreign body, pre-existing infection of abdominal organ (e.g. hepatic abscess, pyometra), pre-existing abdominal neoplasia, pre-existing disorder with ascites, pre-existing infection outside of abdomen causing peritonitis by extension or hematogenous spread, ingestion of raw meat (source of Salmonella spp.), or inappropriate use of NSAIDs. In some cases no cause can be found. Septic peritonitis is less common in cats than dogs.\n\nA complete blood count usually reveals hemoconcentration and a left shift and toxic neutrophils. The total neutrophil count may be elevated, normal or low, depending upon the severity and acuteness of inflammation. Mild anemia may be present.\n\nA serum chemistry profile may reveal hyperalbuminemia (dehydration), hypoalbuminemia (abdominal exudation), hyperglycemia (stress) or hypoglycemia (severe sepsis).\n\nAbdominal radiography may demonstrate loss of detail and \"ground-glass\" appearance and/or free gas in the abdomen. Abdominal ultrasonography may demonstrate peritoneal fluid and ileus. Imaging may also reveal evidence of pleural fluid.\n\nAbdominocentesis may yield fluid. The fluid is a septic exudate, although intra-cellular bacteria may not be seen. Sensitivity of cytology is reported as approximately 60-90%, although in a recent case series peritoneal fluid cytology and a nucleated cell count > 13\u00d710 9 /L (13 000/\u03bcl) had a diagnostic accuracy of 100% in cats. Abdominal fluid should be Gram-stained and cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The most frequently isolated organisms are Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp and Clostridium spp.\n\n\u2022 In a recent report, glucose levels in septic peritoneal fluid were usually lower than blood glucose levels, and a difference of > 1.1 mmol/L (20 mg/dl) was highly specific for septic peritonitis. In contrast, glucose levels in non-septic effusions were equal or higher than blood levels. (This study did not include cats with FIP.) In addition, septic effusions tended to have a lower pH and higher lactate levels than nonseptic effusions. \u2022 Food particles may be seen with gastrointestinal perforation. \u2022 If abdominocentesis is unsuccessful, and pre-surgical confirmation of septic peritonitis is desired, diagnostic peritoneal lavage should be performed.\n\nDifferential diagnoses for an acutely depressed cat with abdominal distention and/or pain include trauma, urethral obstruction, panleukopenia and other causes of acute enteritis, acute pancreatitis and acute pyelonephritis.\n\nDifferential diagnoses for a moribund cat with abdominal distention include urethral obstruction, hepatic encephalopathy, feline infectious peritonitis, advanced neoplasia, heart failure and hemoperitoneum.\n\nSupportive care and treatment for hypotension or shock, including intravenous fluids, is required.\n\nBroad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics, e.g. ampicillin and gentamicin; cefoxitin (second-generation cephalosporin); cefazolin (first-generation cephalosporin) combined with enrofloxacin and metronidazole or clindamycin; or imipenem-cilastatin as a single agent. It should be remembered that enrofloxacin is not licensed for parenteral use in the cat, and there are anecdotal reports of blindness following a single injection. If \"sulfur granules\" are seen suggestive of Actinomyces spp. or Nocardia spp., then initial empirical therapy should consist of penicillin G or ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulfa, or imipenem-cilastatin.\n\nExploratory laparatomy to address underlying cause of peritonitis and to lavage abdomen. Post-operative openabdomen management or closed-suction drainage systems are often required to treat severe generalized peritonitis. With such management, the prognosis for cats appears to be similar to dogs, with average survival rates of 60-80%.\n\n\u2022 Vomiting and/or diarrhea.\n\nCats with acute or chronic gastroenteritis will have vomiting and/or diarrhea of variable frequency and severity.\n\nOther variable clinical signs include depression, anorexia, dehydration, weight loss, reduced growth rate in kittens, abdominal pain, melena and hematochezia.\n\nAbdominal distention may occur because of ileus, with intestinal fluid retention, flatus (especially in acute gastroenteritis), thickening of the intestinal wall (especially in chronic gastroenteritis, e.g. inflammatory bowel disease), or rarely because of ascites due to protein-losing enteropathy. Enlarged intestines contribute to the prominent abdominal contour characteristic of malnourished kittens with a heavy roundworm burden.\n\n\u2022 Abdominal distention is usually mild except in neonatal kittens where it may be severe. \u2022 Distended loops of intestine may feel more or less distinct than usual. Palpation may yield a \"squishy\" or spongy sensation and create borborygmus. \u2022 Thickened loops of intestine will feel more prominent on abdominal palpation.\n\nAbdominal radiographs will always demonstrate dilation of the intestines with air, and may demonstrate dilation of the intestines with fluid. Neither plain nor contrast radiographs are very useful to evaluate thickness of the intestinal walls.\n\nAbdominal ultrasonography is very useful to rule out peritoneal fluid, to demonstrate intestinal wall thickening and to evaluate intestinal motility.\n\nDifferential diagnoses for cats with vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal distention include acute pancreatitis, cholangiohepatitis, hepatic lipidosis, gastrointestinal neoplasia and acute renal failure with volume overload.\n\nTreatment of the primary disease.\n\nSevere gastrointestinal distention by flatus in neonates should be relieved by intubation (stomach air) or trans-abdominal enterocentesis (intestinal air).\n\nSimethicone is not of proven value to reduce flatus formation in humans, and is likely of no benefit in cats.\n\n\u2022 Anorexia, fever, dyspnea and signs of ocular inflammation in mature cats. \u2022 Fading neonate.\n\nSee main references on page 375 for details (The Pyrexic Cat ).\n\nNon-specific signs of depression, anorexia, weight loss and fever are common.\n\nSpecific clinical signs vary with the various organs involved.\n\n\u2022 Common signs include uveitis, dyspnea (pneumonia) and muscle pain. \u2022 All abdominal organs may be infected by Toxoplasma gondii. Specific clinical signs of abdominal infection are usually due to hepatitis and hepatic necrosis (icterus), and mesenteric lymphadenopathy (palpable nodes). Vomiting, diarrhea and pain on abdominal palpation may be present. Peritoneal fluid may also be present, but is unlikely to cause abdominal distention.\n\nSpecific signs may also be due to concurrent disorders causing immunosuppression.\n\nRoutine laboratory results are variable. Neutrophilia is common with systemic infection. Hepatitis is common, causing elevations in liver enzymes and bilirubin.\n\nAbdominal imaging may reveal hepatomegaly, changes consistent with pancreatitis (see The Cat With Acute Anorexia, Depression or Dehydration), mesenteric lymphadenopathy and peritoneal fluid.\n\nPeritoneal fluid is presumably a transudate or modified transudate, which may contain tachyzooites.\n\nAbnormalities at exploratory laparatomy include hepatomegaly, reticular pattern to the surface of the liver with multiple 1-3 mm spots, thickened pancreas with saponification of peripancreatic fat, lymphadenopathy and focal thickening of the intestines.\n\nBiopsies of abdominal organs may reveal mixed inflammation, tachyzooites, and occasionally cysts. Histology will also reveal multifocal necrosis.\n\nElevated IgM titer; four-fold rise in IgG titers 3 weeks apart. Serology gives the most interpretable information if both acute and convalescent IgM and IgG titers are obtained.\n\nDifferential diagnoses for cats with hepatopathy, mesenteric lymphadenopathy and peritoneal fluid include concurrent inflammatory bowel disease and pancreatitis, alimentary lymphoma, FIP, tuberculosis and systemic fungal infections. Of these, only the infectious diseases are likely to also cause pleural fluid, pneumonia (except for FIP), or uveitis.\n\nClindamycin 10-25 mg/kg PO, IM, IV bid continuing at least 2 weeks beyond resolution of clinical signs.\n\nSulfadiazine (30 mg/kg PO bid) and pyrimethamine (0.5 mg/kg PO bid) may be used if clindamycin is not available or not tolerated. Folinic acid (5 mg/day) or brewer's yeast (100 mg/kg/day) may be required to correct myelosuppression resulting from folinic acid deficiency caused by therapy.\n\nTrimethoprim-sulfonamide 30 mg/kg bid may be considered if these are the only drugs available.\n\nSupportive care.\n\n\u2022 Chronic weight loss, vomiting, diarrhea, mesenteric lymphadenopathy. Cats with advanced disease may develop obstructive ascites.\n\nLaboratory results are variable, but non-regenerative anemia is common.\n\nAbdominal radiographs may reveal mesenteric lymphadenopathy and peritoneal fluid. Abdominal ultrasonography may reveal intestinal thickening, mesenteric lymphadenopathy, and peritoneal fluid. Lymph nodes may be calcified.\n\nPeritoneal fluid may presumably be a transudate, modified transudate, chylous or exudate. Macrophages containing acid-fast bacteria may be seen.\n\nCytology and histology of a biopsy of the intestinal tract and mesenteric lymph nodes reveal granulomatous to pyogranulomatous inflammation. Acid-fast bacteria are usually detectable in biopsies.\n\nCulture is possible at selected laboratories, but may take weeks for a positive result. \n\nMany cats with hyperadrenocorticism have diabetes mellitus, which causes the polyuria and polydipsia. Polyphagia may be due to both diabetes and hyperadrenocorticism, and may be severe.\n\nMuscle wasting is due to both disorders. This contributes to abdominal distention, which is manifested as a \"pot-bellied\" appearance, similar to the dog.\n\nDermatologic signs include unkempt haircoat, patchy alopecia, and skin that tears and bruises easily.\n\nConfirmatory testing and distinguishing a pituitary tumor from an adrenal tumor is similar to the dog, involving urine cortisol:creatinine ratio, ACTH stimulation test, dexamethasone suppression tests, plasma ACTH level, abdominal ultrasonography and CT-scanning or magnetic resonance imaging.\n\nOther causes of insulin-resistant diabetes mellitus.\n\nMuscle wasting from another chronic disease plus marked obesity or peritoneal fluid can mimic the potbellied appearance of hyperadrenocorticism.\n\nHypophysectomy and adrenectomy have historically provided the most consistent results.\n\nTrilostane has alleviated clinical signs of pituitarydependent hyperadrenocorticism in all reported cases.\n\nMitotane and ketoconazole have inconsistent results.\n\nPituitary irradiation has inconsistent results.\n\n\u2022 Dyspnea due to pulmonary edema, and/or subcutaneous edema.\n\nExcessive fluid therapy tends to cause pulmonary or subcutaneous edema more than pleural or peritoneal effusions.\n\nFluid therapy may exacerbate pre-existing ascites by causing increased hydrostatic pressure or exacerbating hypoalbuminemia. The presence of a mechanism for ascites formation may divert fluid away from the lungs or subcutaneous tissue into the peritoneal space.\n\nHistory of fluid therapy and improvement of ascites with decreasing fluid rates or diuretic therapy.\n\n\u2022 Abdominal distention following a large meal.\n\nMild abdominal distention is commonly noted in kittens following nursing or drinking.\n\nOccasionally a mature cat may eat an unusually large quantity of food sufficient to cause noticeable abdominal distention. This is most likely to happen when offering a new, highly palatable food, in cats that have fasted, and in cats with polyphagia.\n\nHistory of consuming a large meal.\n\nPalpable distention of gastrointestinal tract.\n\nRadiography will demonstrate a large quantity of ingesta.\n\n\u2022 Mild abdominal distention in a dyspneic cat.\n\nDyspnea.\n\nMildly distended stomach or loops of intestine on abdominal palpation. Loops of intestine may feel more or less distinct than usual. Palpation may yield a \"squishy\" or spongy sensation and create borborygmus.\n\nPalpable distention of gastrointestinal tract by air.\n\nRadiography will confirm air in the gastrointestinal tract and rule out dyspnea due to diaphragmatic compression by a large volume of fluid causing abdominal distention.\n\n\u2022 Pale mucous membranes, weak pulses, tachycardia. \u2022 External signs of trauma.\n\nWith blunt trauma in cats (e.g. motor vehicle accidents, falling from heights), thoracic injuries and resulting dyspnea are more common or clinically important than abdominal injuries. Abdominal hemorrhage may occur but is rarely life threatening.\n\n\u2022 Signs of blunt trauma may be present, including shorn nails, excoriations of the skin, fractured teeth and mandible, epistaxis and pelvic fractures.\n\nPenetrating trauma is less common than blunt trauma, and includes bite wounds, staking injuries and bullet wounds. Bacterial peritonitis is more common or clinically important than acute abdominal hemorrhage.\n\n\u2022 The wound may be difficult to visualize or palpate, but palpation of the abdominal wall at the wound site will usually incite a painful response. The severity of bleeding varies with the organs and blood vessels that are injured.\n\nAbdominal hemorrhage may occur following surgery or external biopsy procedures (e.g. percutaneous liver biopsy).\n\nRegardless of the type of trauma, the signs of abdominal hemorrhage are those of acute hypovolemia. Abdominal distention is unlikely.\n\nAbdominal ultrasonography will usually demonstrate peritoneal fluid. Abdominocentesis may yield blood.\n\n\u2022 Following percutaneous biopsy of an abdominal organ, tachycardia is the first sign of hemorrhage and this finding is more sensitive than ultrasound or abdominocentesis to detect active bleeding.\n\n\u2022 Anorexia, lethargy, weight loss, icterus.\n\nSee main reference on page 425 for details (The Yellow Cat or Cat With Elevated Liver Enzymes).\n\nAnorexia, lethargy and weight loss.\n\nVariable icterus, vomiting, diarrhea.\n\nAscites is uncommon, especially ascites sufficient to cause abdominal distention.\n\n\u2022 Ascites is reported more frequently in some case series, which may represent distinct sub-types of chronic liver diseases.\n\nHepatomegaly is common with lipidosis, but is usually not sufficient to cause abdominal distention.\n\nThese liver diseases may be suspected on the basic of clinical signs and variably elevated liver enzymes.\n\nAbdominal ultrasonography may reveal a normal or enlarged liver, altered hepatic echogenicity and peritoneal fluid.\n\nPeritoneal fluid is usually a transudate or modified transudate. Occasionally, high protein fluid typical of an exudate occurs with non-suppurative cholangiohepatitis.\n\nDefinitive diagnosis requires liver biopsy.\n\nDifferential diagnoses for a cat with signs of liver abnormalities and peritoneal fluid include hepatic neoplasia and other chronic liver diseases, acute pancreatitis, right heart failure, feline infectious peritonitis and toxoplasmosis.\n\nNutritional support.\n\nTherapeutic abdominocentesis is not required.\n\n\u2022 Depression, anorexia and reluctance to move.\n\nDepression, anorexia, fever and reluctance to move because of pain.\n\nAbdominal distention may occur from fluid and firm abdominal fat, and the abdomen may be tense because of pain.\n\nOther clinical signs include fever and firm and lumpy subcutaneous fat with or without accompanying lymphadenopathy.\n\nHistory of a diet high in oxidized unsaturated fats (e.g. rancid tuna) and/or deficient in vitamin E. Rare in cats fed commercial foods.\n\nBiopsy of fat -may be grossly yellow to brown.\n\nAbdominal ultrasound examination may reveal peritoneal fluid. Abdominocentesis may reveal a sterile exudate high in protein and mature neutrophils, similar to that seen with feline infectious peritonitis, or a chylous effusion. Associated sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis has also been reported.\n\n\u2022 Spontaneous bleeding and re-bleeding after trauma.\n\nSpontaneous bleeding and re-bleeding may occur at various sites, including within the abdomen, although thoracic hemorrhage tends to be more common.\n\nSigns due to acute anemia and abdominal distention vary with the severity of blood loss.\n\nAbdominal ultrasonography will demonstrate peritoneal fluid. Abdominocentesis will confirm that the fluid is blood.\n\nCats bleeding from hemophilia A or hemophilia B will have prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time. Definitive diagnosis is by quantification of factor VIII or factor IX, respectively.\n\nDevon Rex cats bleeding from inherited vitamin K responsive coagulopathy will have prolonged prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time, which resolve with vitamin K therapy.\n\nCats bleeding from coagulopathy due to vitamin K antagonist rodenticide poisoning will have prolonged prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and PIVKA clotting time, which resolve with vitamin K therapy.\n\nCats bleeding from coagulopathy due to liver disease (e.g. hepatic lipidosis or cholangiohepatitis) will have prolonged prothrombin time and/or activated partial thromboplastin time. If the prothrombin time is elevated, it may normalize with vitamin K therapy.\n\nHemorrhage due to abdominal neoplasia, trauma, or hepatic necrosis, amyloidosis, or peliosis.\n\nTransfusion.\n\nVitamin K for Devon Rex cats, vitamin K antagonist rodenticide poisoning, and cats with liver disease with prolonged prothrombin times (see main references on page 509 for details, The Bleeding Cat).\n\nEnvironment that minimizes trauma.\n\n\u2022 Chronic depression, anorexia, weight loss.\n\n\u2022 Polyuria/polydipsia if chronic renal failure.\n\n\u2022 Subcutaneous edema and/or ascites if nephrotic syndrome.\n\nSigns are those of chronic renal failure and/or nephrotic syndrome. Concurrent signs may be present from an underlying disease (FeLV infection, FIP, Mycoplasma arthritis and other chronic infections, systemic lupus erythematosus and other immune-mediated disorders, mercury intoxication). Dyspnea may occur due to pleural effusion or pulmonary thromboembolism.\n\nA serum chemistry profile will reveal azotemia with chronic renal failure, and severe hypoalbuminemia with nephrotic syndrome.\n\nUrinalysis will reveal inappropriately low urine specific gravity with chronic renal failure, and marked proteinuria with nephrotic syndrome (note that proteinuria will raise specific gravity).\n\nAbdominal imaging may reveal small kidneys, altered renal echogenicity or peritoneal fluid.\n\nKidney biopsy will reveal glomerulonephritis.\n\nPotential underlying diseases should be investigated. Littermates should be evaluated for familial disease.\n\nOther causes of chronic weight loss and ascites include FIP, neoplasia, pancreatitis, liver diseases, right heart failure, steatitis and tuberculosis. If the peritoneal fluid is a transudate, the main differential diagnosis is neoplasia.\n\nTreat the underlying disorder if possible.\n\nPrednisone (initial dose 2-4 mg/kg/day) has been recommended but is of questionable value.\n\nTreatments that are ineffective in most dogs include cytotoxic drugs and cyclosporine.\n\nTreatments of potential benefit in dogs include ACEinhibitors (e.g. enalapril, benazepril) to reduce hypoproteinemia, n-3 fatty acids to reduce inflammation and inhibit platelets, and low-dose aspirin (0.5 mg/kg PO every other day) to inhibit platelets.\n\nPlasma transfusions will temporarily ameliorate hypoalbuminemia.\n\n\u2022 Chronic straining to urinate and incontinence.\n\nDysuria characterized by increased time in litter box, straining, and dribbling urine from paradoxical incontinence.\n\nTumors affecting mucosa may cause hematuria.\n\nUrinary bladder may be markedly enlarged (\u00b1 atonic), sufficient to cause abdominal distention.\n\nDifficulty in passing urinary catheter.\n\nAbdominal radiography will confirm enlargement of the bladder. Contrast urethrogram or excretory urogram may identify narrowing of urethra or a mass at the trigone.\n\nAbdominal ultrasonography will confirm enlargement of the bladder and may identify a mass at the trigone.\n\nDefinitive diagnosis requires biopsy, which may require surgery.\n\nClassical signs \u2022 Ascites.\n\nA fistula between the hepatic arterial system and portal venous system causes ascites from pre-sinusoidal portal hypertension. Other signs could include poor weight gain, reduced appetite, and dyspnea secondary to ascites. Congestive heart failure and hepatic encephalopathy from secondary porto-systemic shunting are theoretical sequelae.\n\nUsually a congenital lesion, therefore seen in young animal, but could occur secondary to trauma or surgery.\n\nRare.\n\nAbdominal ultrasound examination will confirm peritoneal fluid and may detect a cavernous lesion. Doppler ultrasound may detect high-velocity turbulent blood flow through the fistula.\n\nAbdominocentesis reveals a transudate.\n\nAngiography may be used to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nExploratory laparotomy may reveal prominent subcapsular hepatic blood vessels.\n\nClassical signs \u2022 Ascites.\n\n\u2022 Hepatic encephalopathy.\n\nAn underdeveloped portal venous system causes ascites from pre-sinusoidal portal hypertension in a young animal. Other signs could include hepatic encephalopathy, poor weight gain, reduced appetite and dyspnea secondary to ascites.\n\nRare.\n\nElevated serum bile acids.\n\nAbdominal ultrasound examination will confirm peritoneal fluid and a small liver.\n\nAbdominocentesis reveals a transudate.\n\nAngiography or exploratory laparatomy may be used to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nClassical signs \u2022 Ascites.\n\nLigation of a portosystemic shunt may cause ascites from pre-sinusoidal portal hypertension.\n\nCommon for 2 days following surgical ligation of a portosystemic shunt. Ascites is less likely to occur with an ameroid constrictor or cellophane banding.\n\nAbdominal ultrasound examination will confirm peritoneal fluid.\n\nAbdominocentesis reveals a transudate to modified transudate.\n\n\u2022 Lethargy, anorexia, weight loss, anemia, hepatomegaly.\n\nAmyloidosis is a systemic disease with deposition of amyloid protein AA in numerous tissues including the liver.\n\n\u2022 In most cases, including familial amyloidosis in Abyssinian cats, renal failure from renal amyloidosis dominates the clinical presentation. Nephrotic syndrome causing ascites is rare because amyloid affects primarily the renal medulla. \u2022 In some cases, including as a familial disease in some lines of Siamese cats and Oriental shorthair cats, amyloid deposition in the liver is clinically most important.\n\n-Signs are mostly due to chronic liver disease (lethargy, anorexia, weight loss), or acute hemorrhage (anemia, hemoperitoneum) resulting from spontaneous hepatic rupture. Signs of liver failure (icterus, hepatic encephalopathy) are not common. -Abdominal distention may occur due to hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, intestinal dilation and hemoperitoneum.\n\nLiver enzymes are normal to variably elevated.\n\nLiver biopsy will demonstrate amyloid. If amyloidosis is suspected, biopsy of the intestinal tract may be considered to demonstrate amyloid deposition because there is an increased risk of hemorrhage from liver biopsy.\n\n\u2022 Acute depression and anorexia.\n\nHepatic necrosis may result from a wide variety of mechanisms (e.g. tissue hypoxia, free radical forma-tion) and specific etiologies (e.g. feline infectious peritonitis, virulent systemic feline calicivirus infection, toxoplasmosis, acetaminophen and diazepam toxicosis).\n\nClinical signs are due to the specific cause and to acute liver injury, which may range from subclinical to fulminant hepatic failure with hepatic encephalopathy.\n\nNecrotic liver tissue may spontaneously hemorrhage resulting in peritoneal fluid and acute anemia.\n\nLiver biopsy will demonstrate necrosis.\n\nAbdominal ultrasonography will confirm the presence of peritoneal fluid. Abdominocentesis will confirm that the fluid is blood.\n\n\u2022 Spontaneous abdominal hemorrhage.\n\nVariable clinical signs include: \u2022 Spontaneous abdominal hemorrhage from irregular blood-filled cystic spaces, which may result in pale mucous membranes, collapse or abdominal distention. \u2022 Signs of liver disease, including hepatomegaly or jaundice. Telangiectasia is often present. \u2022 Weight loss, dyspnea.\n\nAbdominal radiographs may reveal hepatomegaly or loss of abdominal detail.\n\nAbdominal ultrasound examination will reveal hypoechoic regions in liver \u00b1 peritoneal fluid.\n\nFine-needle aspiration of liver lesions should yield blood. Abdominocentesis may yield blood.\n\nHistology of liver biopsy will confirm the diagnosis.\n\nPeliosis hepatis may be caused by Bartonella henselae infection in humans, and the two have been associated in a dog, so testing for this organism should be considered.\n\n\u2022 Lethargy, anorexia, and weight loss.\n\nNon-specific signs are most common.\n\nIn a case series about a quarter of cats had a fever and about a third were hypothermic. One third of cats had abdominal pain.\n\nRare disorder.\n\nVariable neutrophilia, anemia, hypoalbuminemia, hyperbilirubinemia and elevation in liver enzymes.\n\nUltrasound may demonstrate hypoechoic or mixed hypoechoic/hyperechoic lesions in the liver and abdominal effusion.\n\nAbdominal fluid cytology usually reveals degenerate neutrophils and bacteria. Degenerate neutrophils without bacteria and hemorrhagic effusion have also been seen.\n\nCulture of hepatic lesions.\n\n\u2022 Abdominal distention. \u2022 Polyuria and polydipsia. \u2022 Inappetence and weight loss.\n\nAbdominal distention occurs due to the formation of unilateral or bilateral fluid-filled sacs. The sacs lack an epithelial lining and contain either a transudate of serum, urine, or uncommonly, blood.\n\nAbout 75% of cats have concurrent chronic renal failure, but cause and effect are not known.\n\nCats are presented for abdominal distention and/or clinical signs of chronic renal failure such as polyuria, polydipsia, inappetence and weight loss.\n\nAbdominal radiography will demonstrate large kidneys. Ultrasonography will demonstrate small kidneys within fluid-filled structures.\n\nPresence of fluid may be confirmed by abdominocentesis. Analysis of fluid will reveal a transudate, urine or blood.\n\nRoutine hematology and serum biochemistry may reveal changes consistent with chronic renal failure.\n\n\u2022 None.\n\nMost \"ectopic pregnancies\" are not associated with clinical signs, and are an incidental finding during ovariohysterectomy.\n\nBecause extra-uterine fetuses usually occur secondary to uterine rupture, marked hemorrhage at the time of rupture or septic peritonitis may occur, which may result in peritoneal fluid.\n\nAscites without systemic signs of illness may also occur.\n\nAbdominal radiography or ultrasonography will demonstrate a mummified fetus \u00b1 peritoneal fluid.\n\n\u2022 Marked abdominal distention due to ascites.\n\nBudd-Chiari-like syndrome is congenital or acquired obstruction of the venous outflow of the liver, including the hepatic venules, hepatic veins and caudal vena cava, causing post-sinusoidal portal hypertension. It is rare in cats. Cases have included veno-occlusive disease and fibrous webs in the caudal vena cava.\n\nThe predominant clinical sign is progressive abdominal distention due to fluid.\n\nAngiography will demonstrate caudal vena caval obstruction.\n\nLiver biopsy will demonstrate veno-occlusive disease.\n\nAbdominocentesis will reveal a modified transudate.\n\n\u2022 Marked abdominal distention.\n\nMild pneumoperitoneum usually occurs following laparotomy and intentional marked pneumoperitoneum occurs during laparascopy.\n\nMarked spontaneous pneumoperitoneum usually results from a perforating gastric ulcer or neoplasm, rupture of the stomach or large intestine, or less often as an extension from pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. Small intestinal rupture usually does not cause marked pneumoperitoneum unless it is a complication of endoscopy, which uses insufflation. Gas may also enter from penetrating abdominal wounds or perforation of the bladder during traumatic urinary tract catheterization, or may be produced by intra-abdominal bacteria, but such gas does not usually cause abdominal distention.\n\nThe predominant clinical sign of marked pneumoperitoneum is marked abdominal distention due to air, and acute onset of depression if associated with gastrointestinal tract rupture.\n\n\u2022 Perforating gastric ulcers may result in marked pneumoperitoneum without generalized peritonitis and may be associated with minimal systemic signs. \u2022 Gastrointestinal perforation may occur with minimal-to-absent pneumoperitoneum.\n\nRadiography will demonstrate free air in the abdomen. This is best seen along the peritoneal surface of the diaphragm and the fundus of the stomach. Lateral views obtained in dorsal or sternal recumbency will demonstrate the air if standard views are inconclusive.\n\nWith marked pneumoperitoneum, abdominocentesis will reveal air. Abdominocentesis may also reveal abdominal fluid, the characteristics of which will vary with the cause.\n\n\u2022 Localized swelling of the abdomen.\n\nCongenital or acquired hernias are usually evident as localized changes in abdominal contour.\n\n\u2022 Owners may misinterpret marked displacement of abdominal fat or organs into the hernia as abdominal distention.\n\nWith acquired traumatic abdominal hernias there are usually also internal or external signs of motor vehicle trauma or fight wounds.\n\n\u2022 Ventral abdominal herniation may be associated with rupture of the cranial pubic ligament.\n\nThe focal nature of the lesion is usually evident on abdominal palpation, especially if the hernia is reducible.\n\nAbdominal imaging or surgical exploration may be necessary to confirm the hernia.\n\n\u2022 Undefined.\n\nPositive titers and seroconversion to Leptospira spp. have been documented in various sick cats.\n\nClinical signs are variable and many are attributable to concurrent diseases. \u2022 Abdominal distention due to ascites has been reported.\n\nThe disease in cats is rare compared to dogs.\n\nMost cats with positive titers have had some evidence of liver disease, e.g. increased liver enzymes, bilirubin or ascites.\n\nCurrently diagnosis in dogs relies on demonstrating a four-fold rise in acute and convalescent titers, and arguably the same criteria should be applied to cats.\n\n\u2022 Tympanic cranial abdomen, shock.\n\nGastric dilation-volvulus is rare in cats. Clinical signs are similar to dogs.\n\nAbdominal distention occurs because of dilation of the stomach with air.\n\nAbdominal radiography will demonstrate marked gastric distention with air.\n\n\u2022 Progressive icterus and abdominal distention."}
