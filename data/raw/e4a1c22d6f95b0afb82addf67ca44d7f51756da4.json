{"title": "The Nucleocapsid Protein of SARS-CoV-2 Abolished Pluripotency in Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells", "body": "Right now, the COVID-19 pandemic is sweeping the world, causing a huge crisis in public health and economics globally. According to the continuously updated data from World Health Organization, to date, more than 300,000 infected cases were confirmed, while more than 13,000 individuals died because of COVID-19 (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novelcoronavirus-2019). Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which was proved to be the pathogen of COVID-19, has 79% identity in genomes with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [1] . 12 coding regions were predicted in SARS-CoV-2, including spike protein, nucleocapsid protein, envelope protein, and membrane protein [1] [2] [3] . The Cryo-EM structure of spike protein had been determined [4] , and more and more evidences showed that the spike protein binds human ACE2 to entry into host cells [4, 5] , which indicated that SARS-CoV-2 might share similar pathogenic mechanisms with SARS-CoV. Because of the very limited knowledge of SARS-CoV-2, we sought to understand the biology of SARS-CoV-2 based on the . CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license author/funder.

Unlike the spike protein with a certain mutation frequency, the sequence of nucleocapsid protein was more stable [7] , which meant it was an ideal target for diagnostic tools [8] [9] [10] and antiviral therapy [11, 12] . The pathogenic effects in host cells caused by the nucleocapsid protein were also studied. It was reported that the nucleocapsid protein inhibited type I interferon production after virion infected the host cells [13] , which was considered as a possible mechanism of immune escape. The nucleocapsid protein inhibited cell cytokinesis and proliferation [14] , and regulated several pathways, such as transforming growth factor-beta signaling [15] , AP-1 signal transduction pathway [16] , and NF-KappaB pathway [17] .\n\nBesides, the nucleocapsid protein was reported as an apoptosis inducer in COS-1 cells [18, 19] and HPF cells [20] .\n\nAs the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 (nCoVN) has 88.1% identity with the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV [1] , it is reasonable to speculate that they share a same pathogenic pathway in host cells. The original goal of this study is to determine the physiological malfunctions in human cardiomyocytes overexpressing nCoVN by using human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and direct differentiation protocols. Unexpectedly, the morphology of iPSC altered obviously when nCoVN had been expressed for 14 days. We turned to investigate whether nCoVN obstructed the pluripotency maintenance in iPSC. Here, we present a new deleterious effect of nCoVN to human pluripotent stem cells.\n\nAs ACE2 is the major receptor of SARS-CoV-2 on the cell membrane [4, 5] , we first examined whether ACE2 were expressed in the stem cells. Thanks to the gene expression data collection in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/), it is convenient to analyze the ACE2 expression profiles in sorts of stem cells,. Figure 1A exhibited the ACE2 expression values in different stem cells from different projects, including human embryonic stem cells [21] , iPSC [22] , human epithelial stem cells [22] , human adipose stem cells [23] , human hematopoietic stem cells [24] , and human mesenchymal stem cells [25] . The expression values of a housekeeping gene GAPDH were simultaneously collected as controls. ACE2 was expressed in each kind of stem cells, though the expression values were relatively low compared with GAPDH. The reverse transcription-PCR (RT-RCR) results showed that ACE2 was expressed in iPSC, iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CM) and human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC), suggesting these cells were the potential targets of SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure 1B) .\n\nTo study whether physiological activities in iPSC were disturbed by nCoVN, a human induced pluripotent stem cell line (iPSC-nCoVN) in which the expression of nCoVN could be modulated by a Tet-On system was generated by a lentiviral expression system. In this system, nCoVN cDNA sequence was conjugated to puromycin resistance gene through a T2A peptide encoding sequence, and the transcription was relied on the induction of tetracycline or doxycycline (Dox). After puromycin selection, iPSC-nCoVN were divided into two groups: one was induced by Dox for nCoVN expression (Dox+), the other was added with DMSO as a control set (DMSO+). The transcriptional level of nCoVN was detected by Real-time PCR in iPSC, Dox+ and DMSO+ groups.\n\nnCoVN expression increased about 267-fold in Dox+ group ( Figure 2A ). The proliferation rate was compared between iPSC and Dox+ groups by using a Cell Counting Kit-8. The absorbance at 450 nm (A450) was measured at 24 hours, 42 hours, 48 hours, 60 hours and 72 hours after cell seeding.\n\nAfter three days of cell seeding, iPSC showed a higher proliferation rate than Dox+ group, indicating that nCoVN might hamper the growth and division of iPSC ( Figure 2B ). This observation was consistent with the previous finding about the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV [14] . We continued to induce nCoVN expression in iPSC. The morphology of some sub-clones started to change after a 7-day induction; most of the cells exhibited distinct shapes from wild-type iPSC after a 14-day induction; after induction for 28 days, a typical fibroblast-like morphology was appeared ( Figure 2C ). The antibodies against fibroblast markers alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and S100A4 were used to verify the cell type of these fibroblast-like cells. The results from immunofluorescence assays confirmed that Dox+ cells had turned to fibroblasts ( Figure 2D ).\n\nNext, we examined the pluripotency markers in iPSC and iPSC-nCoVN. The pluripotency markers SSEA4 and TRA-1-81, which were expressed on the membranes of human embryonic stem cells and iPSC, were widely applied in identification of pluripotent stem cells [26, 27] .

To further test the pluripotency in iPSC and iPSC-nCoVN, we directly differentiated these cells to cardiomyocytes by using a routine protocol and under same conditions.\n\nAs expected, the differentiation efficiency could reach 60% in iPSC; however, on differentiation day 12, only a very small portion of cells were expressed cardiac Troponin T, accompanied by most of cells death (Figure 4 ). This differentiation assay provided solid evidence that the pluripotency maintenance of iPSC-nCoVN was disrupted by nCoVN.\n\nAccording to the current knowledge about the life cycle of SARS-CoV, the nucleocapsid protein was translated by the host cell translation protein synthesis machinery [28, 29] , and was localized mainly in the cytoplasm [30] . The primary function of nucleocapsid protein was to package the viral genome into nucleocapsids to protect the genomic RNA [28] . During the formation of nucleocapsids, numerous nucleocapsid proteins bound to the viral RNA and started oligomerization. The viral reproductive strategies would synthesize nucleocapsid proteins as many as possible to meet the requirements of viral assembly, which meant the nucleocapsid proteins were overproduced. The findings that redundant nucleocapsid proteins interfered with the normal physiology of host cells were reported [13] [14] [15] [18] [19] [20] . In this study, we first presented that nCovN abolished pluripotency, reduced the proliferation rate, but did not cause apoptosis in human induced pluripotent stem cells.\n\nLong-term expression of nCovN drove iPSC to fibroblasts in spite of using the stem cell culture conditions. It was reported that the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV facilitated TGF-\u03b2-induced PAI-1 expression to promote lung fibrosis [15] , which was also the possible pathway that nCovN turned iPSC to fibroblasts.\n\nIn addition, how nCovN breaks the pluripotency maintenance of iPSC is still a riddle. The pluripotency maintenance in stem cells requires delicate regulations to maintain the balance of pluripotency gene expression in a complicated network. Since nCovN is able to bind RNAs, it is possible that nCovN suppresses the key pluripotency gene's translation through occupying the particular sites of RNAs. Although the mechanism is unknown, the toxic effects of nCovN are clear, which reminds us that SARS-CoV-2 could impair the reproductive system and hematopoietic system.

We followed and modified the protocol from Zhang lab to detect MOI of the lentivirus and perform transduction [34] . After 24 hours of transduction, medium was changed to .

After 2-3 days' selection, which resulting in a transduction efficiency of ~30%, cells were dissociated and re-plated in new 6-well plates for future culture. \n\nIPSC and iPSC-nCoVN were seeded in 96-well plates with the same cell number. After 24 hours, CCK-8 reagent was added in the medium to monitor the proliferation rate (Beyotime, C0038). The absorbance at 450 nm was measured at 24 hours, 42 hours, 48 hours, 60 hours and 72 hours. The cell-free medium with CCK-8 reagent were used as blank control sets. The data were analyzed and plotted using GraphPad Prism 6.\n\nCells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 20 minutes and washed three times with 1\u00d7 PBS.
