Conclusions References", "body": "Most secretory and membrane proteins contain carbohydrate moieties covalently attached through an amide linkage to asparagine residues. This has been shown to occur through the en bloc trasfer of a preformed oligosaccharide from a lipid-linked donor to specific glycosylation sites containing the required Asn-X-Ser(Thr) acceptor consensus sequence (for reviews, see Hubbard and Ivatt, 1981; Kornfeld and Kornfeld, 1985; Struck and Lennarz, 1980) . The mature lipid-linked oligosaccharide, 1 containing a Glc 3 Man 9 GlcNAc 2 structure ( Fig. 1) , is transferred cotranslationally to the nascent polypeptide chain on the luminal face of the rough Fig. 1 . Processing of Asn-linked oligosaccharides to a representative biantennary complex structure. The scheme depicts the processing from the transfer of Glc 3 Man 9 GlcNAc 2 from its dolichol pyrophosphoryl derivative to the nascent polypeptide chain still bound to the ribosome, followed by processing reactions in the ER and Golgi complex. Oligosaccharide processing enzymes are listed above the line; the reaction they catalyze is diagramed below the line (except for the alternate processing reaction, 3a). The subcellular localization of processing events are depicted by the brackets. Structures susceptible or resistant to digestion by endo H, an enzyme frequently used as a diagnostic test for processing to complex structures, are indicated.

The luminal orientation of these oligosaccharides results in a defined luminal polarity for all subsequent oligosaccharide processing events. Oligosaccharides of the nascent glycoproteins can then be modified from this common precursor to a variety of mature structures. Minimal modification will result in oligosaccharides containing mannose-terminal branches (high-mannosetype), while more extensive modification may result in structures containing GlcNAc, Gal, fucose, and sialic acid characteristic of complex-type oligosaccharides (Fig. 1) . Partial processing of one or more oligosaccharide branches may also result in both mannose-terminal and complextype modifications on different branches of the same oligosaccharide (hybrid type) (for review, see Kornfeld and Kornfeld, 1985) .\n\nModification of the common precursor to form these mature structures begins almost immediately after the cotranslational oligosaccharide transfer. The outer a-l,2-glucose and the inner two a-l,3-glucosyl residues are removed by glucosidases I and II, respectively. Each of these enzymes has been purified to homogeneity and has been localized to the mem- branes of the RER (Burns and Touster, 1982; Brada and Dubach, 1984; Hettkamp et al., 1984; Hino and Rothman, 1985) . The removal of a single a-l,2-mannosyl residue on some glycoproteins by the action of an ER mannosidase apparently occurs prior to the transfer of these molecules to the Golgi complex (see Section II,A). Further trimming of a-l,2-mannosyl residues proceeds in the Golgi complex by the action of mannosidase I (see Section II,B). This enzyme is responsible for the complete removal of a-l,2-mannosyl residues to form Man 5 GlcNAc 2 . Removal of the final two mannosyl residues to yield the Man 3 GlcNAc 2 core structure present on complex-type oligosaccharides requires the prior addition of a GlcNAc residue to the 2 position of the mannose on the a-1,3 branch of Man 5 GlcNAc 2 (see Fig. 1 ). This transfer is accomplished by GlcNAc transferase I, an enzyme which has been purified and characterized from bovine colostrum (Harpaz and Schachter, 1980a) and rabbit liver (Oppenheimer and Hill, 1981) . After the formation of GlcNAcMan 5 GlcNAc 2 , a second Golgi mannosidase, mannosidase II (see Section II,C) catalyzes the removal of the two remaining terminal a-1,3-and a-l,6-linked mannosyl residues. The rigid substrate specificity of this enzyme therefore results in an overlap of the trimming phase of complex-type oligosaccharide synthesis with the subsequent elongation phase.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 2 , the formation of GlcNAcMan 5 GlcNAc 2 by GlcNAc transferase I is the committed step in the synthesis of either hybrid or complex structures while mannosidase II catalyzes the committed step toward exclusively complex-type structures. Further elaboration of hybrid and complex branches by the addition of GlcNAc, Gal, fucose, and sialic acid results in the varied mature structures found in mammalian glycoproteins. The order of addition and substrate requirements for many of these terminal transferase reactions have been established (Schachter et al., 1983) , and several of the enzymes have been purified to homogeneity (for review, see Kornfeld and Kornfeld, 1985) .\n\nWith the exception of the two glucosidases and the ER mannosidase, all of the enzymes involved in the later stages of oligosaccharide processing were found to be enriched in the membranes of the Golgi complex (Dunphy and . The recent use of immunolocalization techniques has also revealed that several of these activities appear to be enriched in discrete subregions of the Golgi elements (for review, see Dunphy and Rothman, 1985) .\n\nThe \u03b1-mannosidase activities involved in processing of nascent highmannose oligosaccharides to complex-type structures can therefore be reduced to three steps. Evidence will be presented that the removal of one or more a-l,2-mannosyl residues from some nascent oligosaccharides may occur in the RER. This cleavage is followed by a complete removal of a-l,2-mannosyl residues by mannosidase I in the Golgi complex. Finally, a-1,3-and a-l,6-mannosyl residues are removed by mannosidase II following the prior addition of a GlcNAc residue to a specific position by GlcNAc transferase I. A more detailed examination of these three enzyme systems will be presented in this chapter along with a brief discussion of other alternate enzyme systems.\n\nThe first evidence for the presence of a neutral, nonlysosomal mannosidase which could be assayed with the synthetic substrate /?-nitrophenyl-a-D-mannoside was presented by March and Gourlay (1971) . This enzyme was found to differ significantly from the lysosomal mannosidase and subsequently from an \u03b1-mannosidase activity of Golgi membranes (see Table I ). It was characterized by an extreme instability during purification, a pH optimum significantly higher than the previously characterized mannosidase activities and a requirement for divalent cations for activity and/or stability (Shoup and Touster, 1976) . Utilizing the stabilizing effect of the competitive inhibitor mannosylamine, Shoup and Touster (1976) purified the enzyme from a rat liver high-speed supernatant fraction 12,000-fold to 90% purity and characterized it as an oligomeric enzyme with a subunit molecular weight of 110,000. Sucrose gradient centrifugation and gel filtration suggested that the enzyme was a tetramer of four Shoup and Touster (1976) , Bischoff and Kornfeld (1983) . b Tulsiani and Touster (1986) , Tulsiani et al.

The enzyme had an unusually low K m for the synthetic substrate /?-nitrophenyl mannoside (0.14 mM) relative to the lysosomal and Golgi enzymes (10 and 30 mM, respectively) and differed also in its inability to bind to concanavalin A (Con A) and cross-react with antiserum raised against the other two enzymes (see Table I ).\n\nThe physiological role of this mannosidase activity in the cytosol is, however, unclear in view of the fact that the known metabolic processes requiring mannosidase activities are restricted to the membrane systems of the Golgi complex, lysosomes, and possibly the endoplasmic reticulum. Cell fractionation of rat liver by the method of DeDuve et al. (1955) demonstrated that less than 5% of the pH 6.5 mannosidase activity could be found in sedimentable, membrane-bound form (Dewald and Touster, 1973) . These results obviously suggested that the enzyme was cytosolic in origin. The role of the enzyme in vivo therefore remained in question.\n\nIn 1983, with a growing body of evidence for the existence of a previously undetected mannosidase activity in the membranes of the ER (see Section III,A,2), Bischoff and Kornfeld (1983) , using the rat liver cell fractionation procedure of Kreibich et al. (1978) to isolate membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum, found a mannosidase activity similar to that of the cytoplasmic enzyme in a washed ER membrane preparation. This residual activity in the membranes, however, required 0.2% deoxycholate for solubilization. Although the membrane-bound activity could have been at most 25% of the total cytosolic-like mannosidase activity (i.e., ER plus cytosol) even when protease inhibitors were added to the homogenization medium, Bischoffand Kornfeld hypothesized, by analogy to other ER proteins which are readily released from membranes during homogenization, that the soluble cytosolic form was generated by proteolytic degradation of the membrane-bound enzyme.\n\nGlucosidase II in rat liver is also found in both soluble and membranebound forms when the tissue is homogenized in the absence of protease inhibitors (Burns and Touster, 1982) but is found almost exclusively in the membrane-bound form in the presence of protease inhibitors (Brada and Dubach, 1984) . Hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase), an integral membrane protein of the ER, is also readily released in soluble form from cell extracts by endogeneous proteases which cleave the intact 97 kDa polypeptide to a soluble 50-55 kDa species (Chin et al., 1982) . Addition of protease inhibitors during cell lysis can also protect the enzyme from proteolytic release in soluble form. A similar bimodal distribution of enzyme activities has been found for yeast aglucosidase (Kilker et al., 1981) and \u03b1-mannosidase (Jelinek-Kelly et al., 1985) . A mannosidase activity responsible for the hydrolysis of the single mannose removed during yeast oligosaccharide processing (Byrd et al., 1982) was demonstrated to be predominantly in the soluble fraction of yeast homogenates (Jelinek-Kelly et aL, 1985) even though in vivo studies on yeast transport mutants, which block the exit of glycoproteins from the ER, suggested that this activity resides in the ER. Glycoproteins accumulating in the ER of these cells contained the structure Man 8 GlcNAc 2 (Esmon et al, 1984) .\n\nBy analogy to glucosidase I and HMG-CoA reductase one would therefore expect to enhance the ER mannosidase activity in a membrane fraction when cells were disrupted in the presence of protease inhibitors. There was, however, no change in the distribution of the mannosidase activity in the presence of a wide variety of protease inhibitors (Bischoff and Kornfeld, 1983) . In fact, in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and rat hepatoma H35 cells, the microsome-bound mannosidase activity represented as little as 3-5% of the total \"cytosolic/ER-like\" activity (Bischoff and .\n\nMore recently Bischoffand have presented additional evidence that the soluble and membrane-bound forms of the enzyme are two forms of the same enzyme, exhibiting similar substrate specificity, K m forp-nitrophenyl mannoside, and pH optima. Neither enzyme is inhibited by swainsonine or deoxymannojirimycin (dMM) (Bischoffand Kornfeld, 1984) , and both are quite unstable. In addition, antibody raised against the soluble form of the enzyme purified essentially by the method of Shoup and Touster (1976) could cross-react and immunoprecipitate the enzyme solubilized from ER membranes. The only significant differences between the two forms of the enzyme were (1) the membrane-bound form requires deoxycholate for solubilization and (2) the two enzymes differ in their specificity toward Man 9 GlcNAc 2 . The latter difference will be discussed in greater detail below.\n\nThe presence of a small portion of an enzyme activity associated with the membranes of the ER would not, by itself, be very convincing evidence for the assignment to that subcellular compartment. Additional support for the hypothesis that this enzyme is the ER processing mannosidase comes from an examination of the relative activity of the enzyme toward individual high-mannose oligosaccharides. The crude enzyme solubilized from ER membranes has a higher initial rate of hydrolysis for the Man 9 GlcNAc species when compared to the Man 8 _ 6 GlcNAc structures (Bischoffand . As discussed below (Section II,A,2), evidence is accumulating for a dMM-insensitive mannosidase activity in ER membranes capable of cleaving Man 9 GlcNAc 2 to a specific Man 8 GlcNAc 2 isomer; thus the specificity of the ER mannosidase activity was consistent with such a role. Unfortunately, when a more detailed examination of the substrate specificity of the purified soluble enzyme was performed, no preference for Man 9 GlcNAc 2 was found . Analysis of the intermediate structures generated by the digestion of Man 9 GlcNAc revealed that there is no apparent specificity in the removal of mannosyl residues by either the soluble or the membrane-associated enzyme. suggest that the difference between the free oligosaccharides and the protein-bound structures may confer steric or conformational features to the latter substrates allowing a greater specificity of hydrolysis. There may also be differences in specificity between the enzyme in association with the ER lipid bilayer in comparison to a soluble or detergent-solubilized form of the enzyme. Finally, in a temporal respect, nascent glycoproteins would presumably encounter an ER mannosidase for only a brief period prior to routing elsewhere in the cell. This would result in a limited availability for mannose removal.\n\nThe view that there is a specific Man 9 GlcNAc to Man 8 GlcNAc cleaving activity in mammalian cells is supported by consideration of oligosaccharide processing in yeast. Precursors of yeast glycoproteins contain the same Glc 3 Man 9 GlcNAc 2 structure as mammalian cells and convert it to an extended phosphomannan structure by the sequential removal of the three glucose residues and a single central mannose residue prior to extensive mannose and phosphate addition (Byrd et al., 1982) . The trimming of the mannose residue to form a single Man 8 GlcNAc 2 isomer is accomplished by a specific ER processing enzyme (see discussion above). There are significant differences between this enzyme and the ER processing mannosidase of rat liver, however. The yeast enzyme shows the appropriate substrate specificity in vitro, has no activity toward the synthetic substrate /?-nitrophenylmannoside, and is inhibited by the mammalian mannosidase I inhibitor, dMM (Jelinek-Kelly et al., 1985) . Although there are differences between the yeast and mammalian mannosidase processing systems it appears that at least the preferential processing of the central terminal a-l,2-mannose residue has been retained through evolution (Bischoff, 1985) .\n\nIn summary, there is a considerable amount of evidence that the ER mannosidase is closely related to the cytosolic enzyme. The relationship between the two enzymes remains to be established. Other questions are the following: What is the nature of the association of this mannosidase with the ER membrane? What is the basis for the significant differences in the in vivo and in vitro substrate specificity of this enzyme? Finally, what is the physiological role of redundant a-l,2-mannosidase activities in the cell? The recent report on the substrate specificities of cytosolic and lysosomal mannosidases should be considered in relation to possible roles of the enzymes (Tulsiani and Touster, 1987) .\n\nThe presence of an a-l,2-mannosidase activity in ER membranes has been supported by studies in several laboratories. The earliest studies employed inhibitors of protein translocation. Tartakoff and Vassali (1979) presented suggestive evidence of mannosidase cleavage of immunoglobulin M (IgM) \u03bc-chain oligosaccharides in the presence of carbonyl cyanide Af-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), an oxidative phosphorylation uncoupler which inhibits the transport of nascent glycoproteins from the ER to the Golgi complex. The cleavage of thyroglobulin oligosaccharides to Man 8 GlcNAc 2 in the presence of CCCP in calf thyroid slices (Godelaine et al.y 1981) also supported the view that a single mannose residue could be removed in the ER. Processing of IgA oligosaccharides in the presence of CCCP, in contrast, could proceed well beyond Man 8 GlcNAc 2 to a Man 6 GlcNAc 2 structure (Hickman et al., 1984) .\n\nEvidence for the ER mannosidase cleavage of viral and cellular proteins in the absence of translocation inhibitors has also been presented. The precursor for Sindbis virus glycoproteins E2 and E3 is a single polypeptide (PE2) in the ER containing Man 8 GlcNAc 2 oligosaccharides. Following proteolytic cleavage in the Golgi complex these glycoproteins are rapidly converted to complex oligosaccharides (Hakimi and Atkinson, 1982) . In fact, nascent vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G glycoprotein still bound to poly somes has been found to contain a variety of intermediates of glucose trimming (Glc 3 Man 9 GlcN Ac to Man 9 GlcNAc) as well as a significant amount of Man 8 GlcNAc (Atkinson and Lee, 1984) . Similar results were obtained with a mutant of VSV G protein which accumulates in the ER, namely, the glycoprotein accumulates with Man 8 GlcNAc (Gabel and Bergmann, 1985) . A note of caution is appropriate in interpreting these results and some of those discussed below because the transfer of nonglucosylated oligosaccharide from lipid to protein has been detected in mammalian cells (Romero and Herscovics, 1986) .\n\nRotavirus SAH, a lytic virus which assembles and buds into the lumen of the ER, contains a coat glycoprotein, VP7, with high-mannose oligosaccharides. Since viral particles have been localized by electron microscopy exclusively to the ER, these membrane proteins should be analogous to endogenous ER membrane glycoproteins. VP7 in cellular extracts pulse-labeled with [ 3 H]mannose for 5 min followed by a 90 min chase accumulated Man 8 _ 6 GlcNAc 2 while VP7 of the mature virus contained Man 8 _ 5 GlcNAc 2 (Kabcenell and Atkinson, 1985) . Treatment with CCCP resulted in the production of predominantly Man 8 GlcNAc 2 structures. These results may therefore suggest that VP7 must be transported across an energy barrier in order to be processed beyond Man 8 GlcNAc 2 .\n\nSimilar structures for endogenous ER proteins have also been obtained. HMG-CoA reductase (Liscum et al., 1983) , ribophorin I (Rosenfeld et al, 1984) , and prolyl hydroxylase (Kedersha et al., (1985) , all integral ER membrane proteins, were found to contain a collection of high-mannose oligosaccharides ranging from Man 8 GlcNAc 2 to as low as Man 5 GlcNAc 2 . The human liver z variant of a r antitrypsin, which accumulates in the ER as a result of a genetic defect, was also found to contain oligosaccharides ranging from Man 7 GlcNAc 2 to Man 5 GlcNAc 2 (Hercz and Harpaz, 1980) .\n\nAdditional support for the presence of one or more ER mannosidase activities was presented when the ER membrane protein HMG-CoA reductase was synthesized in the presence of the mannosidase I inhibitor, dMM . The glycoprotein synthesized in the absence of dMM contains Man 8 _ 6 GlcNAc 2 structures. In the presence of the inhibitor, however, the HMG-CoA reductase-bound oligosaccharides were predominantly Man 8 GlcNAc 2 . These results suggest that there are two a-1,2-mannosidase activities involved in the processing of this ER membrane glycoprotein. The first activity is very close to the site of protein synthesis (RER) and is insensitive to inhibition by dMM, while the second activity is sensitive to dMM and, based on the rotavirus CCCP results discussed above, may be spatially separated from the first activity. Preliminary evidence for a dMM-sensitive ER mannosidase involved in the processing of the oligosaccharides on a rat growth hormone-influenza hemagglutinin hybrid protein has recently been presented (Rizzolo and Kornfeld, 1987) . In addition, Schweden et al. (1986) have isolated a dMMsensitive a-l,2-mannosidase from calf liver microsomes which recognizes Man 9 _ 7 GlcNAc 2 but not Man 6 GlcNAc 2 and has a requirement for divalent cations (see section B.2). Whether this second dMM-sensitive activity represents an alternate form of the previously characterized Golgi mannosidase I which may reside in low levels in ER membranes and slowly act on resident ER membrane proteins or is an additional previously uncharacterized ER mannosidase is presently under investigation.\n\nIt is interesting to note that when analogous experiments with dMM treatment were performed on the total cell and secreted glycoproteins of rat hepatocytes the predominant structure on the oligosaccharides on these glycoproteins was Man 9 GlcNAc 2 with smaller amounts of Man 8 GlcNAc 2 . The dMM-insensitive a-l,2-mannosidase activity in this cell line is apparently acting on less than half of the total cellular glycoproteins. The mannosidase processing of cellular and se-creted glycoprotiens may therefore have more than one route depending on the polypeptide structure of the substrate.\n\nInfluencing the Extent of Oligosaccharide Processing The extent of processing of cellular glycoproteins would be expected to reflect the cellular processing machinery that they have encountered. Thus, ER membrane glycoproteins contain predominantly high-mannose oligiosaccharides while cell surface glycoproteins contain predominantly complex-type structures, reflecting the differences in transport of the respective macromolecules through the Golgi processing machinery. An alternate mechanism for the regulation in processing of the bulk cell surface or secreted glycoproteins is to regulate the levels of individual processing enzymes in the cell. Many cell surface or secreted proteins, however, contain incompletely processed oligosaccharides at individual sites. In general, this does not correlate with a lack of the appropriate processing enzyme in the host cell. The factors influencing the extent of oligosaccharide processing at individual sites has, therefore, been the subject of study by several investigators.\n\nThe maturation of Sindbis virus oligosaccharides was examined by determining the accessibility of individual glycosylation sites to digestion by endo-\u00df-7V-acetylglucosaminidase H (endo H) (Hsieh et al., 1983a) . In this case, glycosylation sites on mature viral glycoproteins were examined in two host cell lines. Glycosylation sites which were readily accessible to digestion by endo H in a mutant cell line lacking GlcNAc transferase I were the same sites which were destined to become complex structures in the corresponding control cell line. Sites which were destined to remain high-mannose structures in the intact native viral glycoproteins were inaccessible to endo H cleavage in the absence of prior denaturation. Similar results were obtained in the processing of the high-mannose oligosaccharides of yeast carboxypeptidase Y and invertase (Trimble et al., 1983) . Sites which contained large phosphorylated mannan side chains were readily accessible to endo H digestion while the sites which could be cleaved by endo H only after protein denaturation were smaller and contained no phosphate.\n\nThe processing of oligosaccharides at a particular glycosylation site can depend not only on the accessibility of the entire structure to processing enzymes but also on the ability of a given processing enzyme in different host systems to gain conformational access to the oligosaccharide. The oligosaccharides of Sindbis virus glycoproteins, when grown on three different host cell lines, were found to vary in the extent of host-dependent processing at the individual glycosylation sites. Oligosaccharides at one site on glycoprotein El were predominantly complex-type structures in baby hamster kidney cells but were high-mannose structures at the same site in chick embryo fibroblasts. Other glycosylation sites in the same molecule were maintained as exclusively complex-type structures (Hsieh et al., 1983b) . The observation that a second glycosylation site on the same molecule can be processed to a complex structure in all three host cell lines suggests that the host-dependent variation in glycosylation did not result from alternate transport routes containing differing processing machinery. Since the polypeptide structure and presumably the conformation of the viral glycoprotein substrate remained constant, the only differences between the cell lines were probably the limits in the steric constraints required by one host cell processing enzyme to gain access to the viral glycosylation site when compared to the equivalent processing enzyme of the other cell lines.\n\nAdditional evidence for site-specific rates of oligosaccharide processing has recently been presented in the processing of the \u03bc chain of IgM in a murine plasmacytoma cell line (Brown and Hickman, 1986) . Individual glycosylation sites on this glycoprotein were isolated, and the time course of oligosaccharide processing at each site was assessed. Surprisingly, sites which were destined to be high-mannose oligosaccharides with Man 6 _ 5 GlcNAc 2 structures were processed to these structures after only a 30-min chase, while those destined to eventually become complex structures remained Man 8 _ 7 GlcNAc even after a 180-min chase. Since the isomeric forms of Man 8 GlcNAc 2 at each of the sites were identical, the differences in processing time could not result from a difference in the order of mannose removal, but merely the rate of removal. These authors hypothesized that the rate of processing of the oligosaccharides at these individual sites depends on the extent of substrate accessibility of each processing intermediate to the processing enzymes at each site. Ratelimiting steps in processing might therefore reflect conditions where the constraints on substrate accessibility were most severe. Accumulation of specific intermediates of processing would not need to reflect a delay in the transport of a glycoprotein substrate to the site of a new processing mannosidase, as suggested previously by these authors (Hickman et aL, 1984) , but merely reflects a rate-limiting processing step.\n\nHost-dependent processing of glycoproteins has also been studied in vitro. Bovine pancreatic ribonuclease B, a glycoprotein containing predominantly Man 5 GlcNAc 2 oligosaccharides, was added to Golgi membrane preparations from either rat liver or bovine pancreas in the presence of the GlcNAc transferase donor substrate UDP-GlcNAc (Williams and Lennarz, 1984) . The rat liver Golgi membranes proceeded to process this native substrate through the GlcNAc transferase I and mannosidase II steps to an endo H-resistant form in contrast to the bovine membranes which processed the glycoprotein only after prior denaturation.\n\nFurther evidence for the influence of the combined 3-dimensional conformation of a polypeptide and oligosaccharide at a glycosylation site has been presented by several investigators. The oligosaccharide structures of myeloma IgG heavy (H) and light (L) chains were analyzed by Savvidou et al. (1984) using proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (\u0389 NMR). In this case the majority of the L-chain oligosaccharides contained fully bisected biantennary complex oligosaccharides while the H chain contained predominantly nonbisected biantennary complex structures. Since the oligosaccharides at both sites contained complex structures, and since the H and L chains had already become covalently associated prior to the addition of the bisecting GlcNAc, the differences in structure could not be due to host-dependent variation or to a general lack of \"accessibility\" of the oligosaccharide. These authors present evidence, however, that the conformation of the oligosaccharide on the H chain is constrained through an interaction with the polypeptide chain in such a way that is renders the oligosaccharide unable to be recognized by GlcNAc transferase III, the enzyme which adds the bisecting GlcNAc.\n\nAn analogous situation was revealed when the ovalbumin gene was expressed in a heterologous mouse L cell line (Sheares and Robbins, 1986) . Mature chicken ovalbumin contains a variety of high-mannose and bisected hybrid oligosaccharides at the single glycosylation site (Yamashita et al., 1978) . When the protein was expressed in mouse L cells the polypeptide was glycosylated at the same single glycosylation site, but the oligosaccharides at this site contained 27% complex, 23% high-mannose, and 50% nonbisected hybrid-type oligosaccharides. Although the addition by GlcNAc transferase III of a bisecting GlcNAc on chicken ovalbumin would convert these oligosaccharides to a structure which is no longer a substrate for mannosidase II, an explanation which has been used to account for bisected hybrid structures on this protein (Schachter et al., 1982) , in the mouse L cells ovalbumin oligosaccharides contain hybrid structures even in the absence of a bisecting GlcNAc. The negligible amount of hybrid oligosaccharides in the total cell glycoproteins suggests that ovalbumin hybrid structures do not result merely from a stoichiometric competition between mannosidase II and galactosyltransferase, but that an interaction between the oligosaccharide and the polypeptide on ovalbumin hinders the action of mannosidase II even in the absence of a bisecting GlcNAc. Whether this is caused by the mere proximity of the polypeptide to essential oligosaccharide structural features or an interaction between the oligosaccharide and the polypeptide which alters the oligosaccharide conformation will require further structural analysis.\n\nThe factors influencing the rate and extent of oligosaccharide processing are, therefore, quite complex. The implications for mannosidase processing reactions are that the appropriate mannosidase not only needs to be available but also needs to be accessible in respect both to freedom from steric hindrance in binding to the substrate and to recognition of an appropriate conformation of the oligosaccharide.\n\nCleavage of a-l,2-mannosyl residues was originally believed to occur exclusively in the Golgi complex by mannosidase I (Tabas and Kornfeld, 1979) . As described above, however, several investigators have suggested that the early stages of mannose trimming may occur in the ER. Although these studies support the hypothesis of a Man 9 GlcNAc 2 to Man 8 GlcNAc 2 cleaving activity in ER membranes, they leave open the question of whether further trimming occurs at this location by an alternate mannosidase I-like activity Brown and Hickman, 1986; Schwenden et al., 1986) or in the Golgi complex by the previously characterized enzyme (Tabas and Kornfeld, 1979) . Since mannosidase I activity has been localized to the eis (Dunphy et al., 1981; Rothman, 1981) or medial (Dunphy and Rothman, 1985) regions of the Golgi complex by a combination of kinetic and cell fractionation studies, the question of how ER glycoproteins are processed beyond a Man 8 GlcNAc 2 structure in the ER remains unanswered. Although the possibility of an additional ER mannosidase exists, the evidence does not exclude mannosidase I was a processing enzyme even for ER proteins.\n\nMost of the evidence for a dMM-sensitive ER mannosidase is derived from in vivo studies on resident ER glycoproteins which accumulate Man 8 _ 6 GlcNAc 2 structures (see Section II,A,2). Through the prolonged life span of these glycoproteins in the ER, either the oligosaccharides could potentially be subject to digestion by the normally low steady-state level of the Golgi mannosidase I activity residing in ER membranes while in transit to the Golgi complex or, alternatively, the ER glycoproteins could be involved in a cycle of transport and recapture of vesicles from the ER to the Golgi complex. Only low steady-state levels of ER components in the eis Golgi elements would be expected to be necessary in order to allow a reequilibration of more highly processed oligosaccharides back into the more extensive ER pool of these proteins.\n\nIn contrast, the mannosidase I localization studies have employed ki-netic studies on viral glycoproteins in conjunction with cell fractionation to determine the sequence and functional distribution of enzyme activities in Golgi subfractions. Early studies assigned mannosidase I activity to the eis side of the Golgi complex along with fatty acyl transferase, in contrast to the trans localization of galactosyl-and sialyltransferases (Dunphy et al. y 1981; Rothman, 1981) . Subsequent work has shown that the eis membranes could be subdivided into early (eis) membranes, containing the enzymes involved in the synthesis of mannose 6-phosphate on precursors of lysosomal enzymes, and the later (medial) enzymes of oligosaccharide processing, mannosidase II, GlcNAc transferase I, GlcNAc transferase IV, and fucosyltransferase (Goldberg and Kornfeld, 1983) . Although mannosidase I was not resolved in these studies, Dunphy and Rothman (1985) have shown that the enzyme cofractionates with this subset of medial Golgi enzymes in CHO cells.\n\nAlthough these cell fractionation studies can adequately determine the site of the bulk of the mannosidase I-like activity in the cell, the technique is not sufficiently precise to determine the portion of the activity residing in eis Golgi or ER membranes. In addition, since no attempt was made to discriminate between potential multiple Man 9 GlcNAc-cleaving activities in these cells, the mannosidase I profiles may also result from a composite of multiple activities concentrated in distinct compartments. A more precise technique for the analysis of the subcellular localization of this enzyme would be to use immunocytochemistry. Fortunately, the enzyme has recently been purified, and a specific antibody has been raised (see Section II,B,2). Immunocytochemistry and immunoprecipitation studies should, therefore, be able to assign a precise site for this enzyme and determine if alternate enzymes are available for high-mannose processing (see discussion below).\n\nThe existence of multiple forms of mannosidase I-like activities from rat liver Golgi membranes has, in fact, been previously described (Tulsiani et ah, 1982b) . A further description of their isolation and characterization is provided below.\n\nMannosidase I was partially purified first by Tabas and Kornfeld (1979) . Subsequently, Tulsiani et al. (1982b) fractionated the enzyme by phosphocellulose chromatography into two distinct activities. The unadsorbed activity (mannosidase IA) was characterized by an absence of any action on the synthetic substrate p-nitrophenyl mannoside, while the activity which was eluted with a salt gradient (mannosidase IB) had a low, but significant, action on this substrate. In addition, the two enzymes differed significantly in thermolability and in their activity toward Man 5 GlcNAc.\n\nMannosidase IA had approximately 4 times greater activity toward this substrate than mannosidase IB. Both activities could also be fractionated on DEAE-cellulose into binding and nonbinding fractions, but no catalytic differences between these forms could be detected. This behavior had previously been observed for mannosidase II (Tulsiani et al., 1977) and mannosidase IA (Tabas and Kornfeld, 1979) and suggests that all of these enzymes exhibit charge heterogeneity due to posttranslational modifications or protein sequence variations producing structural isozymes.\n\nThe substrate specificities of the enzymes have been studied by two groups with conflicting results. Tabas and Kornfeld (1979) assayed the activity of mannosidase IA against high-mannose substrates and found the greatest activity toward Man 7 GlcNAc. Tulsiani et al. (1982b) , however, found that the highest activities for both mannosidase IA and IB were toward the largest substrates, Man 9 GlcNAc and Man 8 GlcNAc. The K m of mannosidase IA toward Man 8 GlcNAc was 100 \u03bc\u039c (Tabas and Kornfeld, 1979) . The activity toward Man 5 GlcNAc, which contains no a-1,2-linked mannosyl residues, was quite low for both enzymes, confirming a specificity for a-l,2-linkages (Tulsiani et al., 1982b) .\n\nWhen the hydrolysis products of a mannosidase IA digestion were examined by acetolysis, a very specific sequence of mannose removal was detected (Tabas and Kornfeld, 1979) . Surprisingly, the enzyme readily cleaved the upper and lower mannosyl branches of the Man 9 GlcNAc structure but cleaved the central a-l,2-mannose only after prolonged incubation. This is in contrast to recent work by D. R. P. Tulsiani and O. Touster (unpublished) on purified mannosidase IA (see below) and also in contrast to several other studies, all of which indicate that the central a-1,2-mannosyl residue is the first to be removed from mammalian glycoproteins in vivo Cohen and Ballou, 1980; Brown and Hickman, 1986; Bischoffand Kornfeld, 1986) . Since the processing of approximately half of the total cellular glycoproteins in rat hepatocytes is blocked by dMM at Man 9 GlcNAc rather than at the Man 8 GlcNAc product , and since mannosidase IA appears to produce the same Man 8 GlcNAc isomer found in vivo, the initial processing of these glycoproteins is apparently being carried out by Golgi mannosidase I, or by another dMM-sensitive enzyme, rather than by ER mannosidase.\n\nMannosidase IA purified to homogeneity from rat liver Golgi membranes by several Chromatographie steps (Tulsiani and Touster, 1986 ) has a subunit molecular weight of approximately 57,000 and an oligomeric molecular weight of approximately 230,000. It therefore appears to be a tetramer composed of identical or very similar subunits. Since several proteins including mannosidase II (Moremen and Touster, 1985) and glucosidase II (Brada and Dubach, 1984) have been shown to be cleaved by proteases during purification, further studies are presently underway to confirm that the isolated enzyme represents the intact macromolecule present in vivo. Recent work (D.R.P. Tulsiani and O. Touster, unpublished) indicates that mannosidase IA is a glycoprotein since it binds to Con A. However, it appears not to have the terminal sugars characteristic of complex oligosaccharides, since it does not bind to immobilized ricin, lentil lectin, or serotonin. The enzyme is inhibited by dMM, with a 50% inhibition at 1 \u03bc\u039c, but as much as 5% of the activity is resistant to concentrations as high as 2 mM.\n\nRecent substrate specificity studies on purified mannosidase IA confirm the earlier finding (Tulsiani et al., 1982b) that the enzyme has the highest activity toward Man 9 GlcNAc, with activity descending through the series from Man 8 GlcNAc to Man 5 GlcNAc. Analysis by acetolysis of the intermediates of Man 9 GlcNAc degradation by homogeneous mannosidase IA as stated above is in contradiction to the previous studies by Tabas and Kornfeld (1979) , which employed a partially purified preparation of mannosidase IA. The homogeneous enzyme preferentially removes the central mannose on Man 9 GlcNAc yielding a single Man 8 GlcNAc isomer and further cleaves through two Man 7 GlcNAc isomers, and a single Man 6 GlcNAc isomer, to the final Man 5 GlcNAc structure which is a substrate for GlcNAc transferase I.\n\nImmunoprecipitation studies with antibody raised to homogeneous mannosidase IA cross-reacted with mannosidase IB, a result suggesting that these two forms of the enzyme share antigenic determinants (D. R. P. Tulsiani and O. Touster, unpublished) . It is likely, therefore, that mannosidases IA and IB share a common subunit or that they represent two different isoforms of the same molecule by analogy to the A and B forms of human liver lysosomal \u03b1-mannosidase (Cheng et al., 1986) . This acidic mannosidase is composed of two immunologically identical charge isomers generated from the differential processing of the large subunit of one form.\n\nA partial purification of a neutral a-l,2-mannosidase activity from rabbit liver microsomes has been accomplished (Forsee and Schutzbach, 1981) , and its interaction with phospholipids has been examined Schutzbach, 1981, 1983; Forsee et al., 1982) . Rat liver mannosidase IA differs from this enzyme in not being activated by phospholipid (D. R. P. Tulsiani and O. Touster, unpublished) .\n\nThe use of a mannosidase I inhibitor to study the role of mannosidase processing on subsequent transport was first described by Fuhrmann et al. (1984) . These authors, in examining the effect of dMM on the process-ing of IgM and IgD, found that while the secretion of these glycoproteins was not affected by the inhibitor, the oligosaccharides of the secreted material contained mostly Man 9 GlcNAc (75%) along with Man 8 GlcNAc (25%) structures. Subsequent studies have shown that this inhibitor will cause the accumulation of Man 9 GlcNAc 2 on the glycoproteins of Rous sarcoma virus (Bosch et al., 1985) , influenza virus (Elbein et al., 1984; Burke et al., 1984) , and vesicular stomatitis virus (Burke et al., 1984) while not interfering with their cell surface expression or viral infectivity. The cell surface expression of the human class I histocompatibility antigens was also not altered by this inhibitor (Burke et al., 1984) . In HepG2 cells dMM caused a delay in the proteolytic processing of cathepsin D while increasing the fraction of the enzyme which was secreted (Nauerth et al., 1985) , but in parallel studies in fibroblasts the inhibitor did not alter either the segregation or maturation of the enzyme. 1-Deoxymannojirimycin in combination with other analogous glycosidase inhibitors such as deoxynorjirimycin, castanospermine, and swainsonine should therefore by a useful tool in determining the precise role of the sequential steps of oligosaccharide maturation on localization and biological activity of cellular and secreted glycoproteins.\n\nA second type of mannosidase inhibitor which will be a valuable tool for the analysis of the role of oligosaccharide processing on glycoprotein metabolism is the methyl-p-nitrophenyltriazene (MNT) derivative of mannose (Docherty et al., 1986) . Similar MNT derivatives of galactose and glucose have been shown to irreversibly inhibit the corresponding galactosidases and glucosidases (Van Diggelen et al., 1980) and have been instrumental in both examining the expression of these enzymes in human cells (Van Diggelen et al., 1981) and uncovering the metabolic defect in combined galactosidase and neuraminidase deficiency (Van Diggelen et al., 1981) . Treatment of perfused rat liver by Docherty et al. (1986) with mannose-MNT resulted in the secretion of a r acid glycoprotein containing Man 9 _ 7 GlcNAc. Recovery of the secretion of normal complex-type structures following the removal of the inhibitor took over 24 hr, probably reflecting the synthesis of new enzyme. Since this compound results in the irreversible inhibition of mannosidases it could also theoretically be used as a covalent active site probe. Further studies on the inhibition of isolated processing mannosidases would be helpful, however, to further assess the inhibitor studies in vivo. Unfortunately, the restricted availability of the mannose-MNT derivative and the difficulty of synthesis of mannosylmethylamine, the precursor of mannose-MNT, may also prove to be factors affecting the general use of the inhibitor in processing studies.\n\nEarly studies on the processing of N-linked oligosaccharides suggested that the maturation of newly synthesized oligosaccharides to mature complex structures involved cleavage of all but the final three core mannose residues prior to addition of complex terminal sugars . These authors also mentioned concurrent studies on a ricin-resistant CHO cell line, clone 15B, which revealed that a deficiency in a GlcNAc transferase caused the accumulation of oligosaccharides with a Man 5 GlcNAc 2 structure. This observation was, in fact, the first evidence that the full cleavage of mannosyl residues to the Man 3 GlcNAc 2 core found in complex oligosaccharides required the prior addition of a GlcNAc. Several investigators Tulsiani et al., 1982b; Harpaz and Schachter, 1980b) have since shown that rat liver contains an enzyme which is dependent on the prior addition by GlcNAc transferase I of a single GlcNAc in an a-1,2 linkage to the lower a-1,3 branch of Man 5 GlcNAc 2 . This mannosidase cleaves both the a-1,3-and a-1,6-mannose residues of GlcNAcMan 5 GlcNAc 2 but does not recognize as a substrate Man 5 GlcNAc 2 , GlcNAc 2 Man 5 GlcNAc 2 (with one bisecting \u00df-1,4-GlcNAc on the core \u00df-l,4-mannose), or GalGlcNAcMan 5 GlcNAc 2 (Tulsiani et al., 1982b; Schachter et al., 1982) . Thus this enzyme, with a very restricted substrate specificity toward two specific a-1,3-and a-1,6mannosyl residues on GlcNAcMan 5 GlcNAc 2 , was named mannosidase II for its position as the second Golgi processing mannosidase in the maturation of complex oligosaccharides (Tulsiani et al., 1982b) .\n\nSeveral years before the discovery of a GlcNAc transferase I-dependent a-l,3/a-l,6-mannosidase, Dewald and Touster (1973) observed a mannosidase in Golgi membranes that was active toward the synthetic substrate p-nitrophenylmannose. This enzyme was an integral membrane protein enriched in Golgi membranes and was clearly distinct from the lysosomal and soluble mannosidases on the basis of pH optimum, immunological cross-reactivity, molecular weight, and kinetic properties. The enzyme was purified from rat liver Golgi membranes (Tulsiani et al., 1977) and found to have a subunit molecular weight of 124,000 (Moremen and Touster, 1985) . Early work indicated that the enzyme is a glycoprotein inasmuch as it stained for carbohydrate and bound to Con A.\n\nSubstrate specificity studies (Tulsiani et al., 1982b) have shown that this enzyme is the GlcNAcMan 5 GlcNAc 2 cleaving enzyme, since the ac-tivities toward /?-nitrophenylmannose and GlcNAcMan 5 NAc 2 copurify, respond similarly to effectors, and show similar rates of inactivation. In addition, both activities are inhibited by swainsonine, an indolizidine alkaloid which also inhibits the lysosomal enzyme (Tulsiani et al., 1982a) . Activity of the enzyme toward GlcNAcMan 5 GlcNAc is at least 10-fold higher than the corresponding activity toward the high-mannose oligosaccharides Man 9 _ 5 GlcNAc. Lack of activity toward oligosaccharides containing a bisecting GlcNAc or a galactose added to the nonreducing GlcNAc of GlcNAcMan 5 GlcNAc 2 implies that the relative levels of any of three key processing enzymes, namely, mannosidase II, GlcNAc transferase III, and galactosyltransferase, will determine the fate of oligosaccharide processing toward complex, bisected hybrid, or hybrid structures, respectively. Thus, a relative excess of mannosidase II will result in the cleavage to GlcNAcMan 3 GlcNAc 2 prior to the substrate being \"frozen\" in a hybrid structure by GlcNAc transferase III or galactosyltransferase activities. This cleavage will route the resultant oligosaccharide toward the formation of complex structures.\n\nSuggestive evidence for the regulation of the route of glycoprotein maturation by adjusting the processing enzyme levels was presented in studies on the chicken oviduct. The relative abundance of GlcNAc transferase III over mannosidase II was used as an explanation for the abundance of bisected hybrid structures on glycoproteins from these tissues (Schachter et al., 1982) , but as discussed earlier (see Section II,A,3) other factors can also contribute to the abundance of hybrid structures on ovalbumin.\n\nThe relative abundance of complex oligosaccharides on cellular and secreted glycoproteins can also be accounted for by the spatial separation of mannosidase II and galactosyltransferase activities. Mannosidase II has been shown by immunocytochemistry to have a broad distribution throughout Golgi membranes (Novikoff et al., 1983) , with a relative abundance of activity in the medial Golgi cisternae (Farquhar, 1985) . Galactosyltransferase, in contrast, is found localized in the last few cisternae on the trans side of the Golgi complex (Roth and Berger, 1982) . This separation into subregions of Golgi localization for competing processing reactions would, therefore, act to assure the appropriate routing of modification for cellular glycoproteins toward complex structures.\n\nSwainsonine was originally found to be an inhibitor of glycoprotein processing, with the authors suggesting that the accumulating oligosaccharides were Man 9 _ 8 GlcNAc 2 (Elbein et al., 1981 (Elbein et al., , 1982 . Inhibition studies on isolated mannosidases suggested, however, that the compound inhibited mannosidase II, not mannosidase I (Tulsiani et al., 1982a) . The inhibition was subsequently shown to cause the synthesis of hybrid structures both in vitro and in vivo supporting the conclusions that, in the absence of mannosidase III, galactosyltransferase could route oligosaccharide processing toward hybrid structures.\n\nThe effect of swainsonine on glycoprotein transport and expression are quite uniform (Table II) . In general, though hybrid structures are induced, there are few cases of swainsonine causing an altered function of cellular or secreted glycoproteins. Yeo et al. (1985) detected a slight acceleration in intracellular transport of the secretory glycoproteins transferrin, ceruloplasmin, a 2 -niacroglobulin, and \u00abi-antitrypsin while no alteration in the rate of transport of the nonglycoprotein albumin was observed. The inhibitor was also shown to inhibit receptor-mediated uptake by the mannose receptor (Arumugham and Tanzer, 1983a; Chung et al., 1984) but this probably results from the production of cell surface glycoproteins containing hybrid oligosaccharides. These structures, which are effective ligands for the mannose receptor, probably compete with exogenously added ligand for receptor binding. Swainsonine was also found to be a potent immunomodulator both in vitro and in vivo (Kino et al., 1985) , while inhibitor treatment of tumor cells has been shown to alter the recognition of these cells by allogeneic lymphocytes (Powell et al., 1985) . Therefore, although mannosidase II and the resulting complex oligosaccharides it produces may not be essential for the expression or localization of specific glycoproteins in homogeneous cell populations in culture, the interaction of heterogeneous cell populations in mammalian tissues may be more strongly effected by the shift in oligosaccharide structure.\n\nSwainsonine was originally isolated from toxic plants of the genus Swainsona. Since the symptoms of Swainsona toxicity and hereditary lysosomal mannosidosis are similar and since this compound also inhibits the lysosomal enzyme in vitro, it was originally proposed (Colegate et al., 1979; Dorling et al., 1978 Dorling et al., , 1980 that this compound induces a phenocopy of the hereditary mannosidosis. Subsequent studies have shown, however, that swainsonine induced kidney and excreted oligosaccharides have branched Man 3 _ 5 GlcNAc structures (Daniel et al., 1984) while in human hereditary mannosidosis urinary oligosaccharides contain predominantly linear Man 5 _ 2 GlcNAc structures (Matsuura et al., 1981) . At the present time it appears that the toxic effect of swainsonine may result from a combination of the inhibition of the lysosomal enzyme and an alteration of glycoprotein processing. Swainsonine has been found to be the active agent in loco weed toxicity (Tulsiani et al., 1984) .\n\nStudies examining the synthesis, topology, posttranslational modification, and turnover of cellular and secreted glycoproteins have been useful in determining the routing and life history of these macromolecules. The availability of a highly specific antibody against mannosidase II has allowed these types of studies also to be performed on this Golgi enzyme (Moremen and Touster, 1985) . The enzyme is synthesized in both 3T3 and HeLa cells as a 124 kDa polypeptide containing endo H-sensitive oligosaccharides which contribute ~7 kDa to the apparent molecular mass of the molecule. In both cell lines the oligosaccharides are eventually converted to mostly (HeLa) or entirely (3T3) endo H-resistant structures. The HeLa cell enzyme is further processed by the addition of O-linked oligosaccharides which cause a shift in apparent molecular mass to 134-136 kDa. These studies demonstrated the addition of sulfate to the relinked oligosaccharides of mannosidase II in both cell lines as well as covalently bound phosphate and palmitate. The phosphate on the HeLa cell enzyme was found as serine phosphate moieties. The half-life of the enzyme in both cell lines was about 20 hr, which was slightly shorter than the rate of turnover of the total cellular protein.\n\nTopology studies (Moremen and Touster, 1986a) have revealed that the catalytic domain, as expected, was oriented toward the lumen of the Golgi membrane. An unexpected result, however, was that the catalytic domain was quite resistant to digestion by a wide variety of the proteases used in the topology studies. Chymotrypsin, pronase, and proteinase K could all cleave the intact 124 kDa polypeptide to a 110 kDa form which, at least after chymotrypsin digestion, retained all of the original catalytic activity. A similar cleavage could be accomplished by trypsin or V-8 protease to a 115 kDa form. This cleavage could not be demonstrated in nonpermeabilized intact Golgi membranes. In saponin-permeabilized membranes chymotrypsin cleavage resulted in the production of the 110 kDa cleaved form, which, if the membranes were sedimented, was found in soluble form in the supernatant. Both the cleavage and release were dependent on the presence of both detergent and protease. These results suggest that the 110 kDa form represents a soluble form of the enzyme generated by protease digestion. Triton X-114 phase separation studies confirmed that the 110 kDa polypeptide represents a hydrophilic catalytic domain while the 124 kDa intact enzyme is a hydrophobic integral membrane protein.\n\nThe unusual nature of conversion in phase separation behavior following chymotrypsin treatment and the unusual stability of the catalytic domain to further digestion have allowed the development of a novel, high-yield purification procedure for the 110 kDa catalytic domain. Comparison of this species with the intact enzyme has revealed that the 110 kDa form exhibits an identical K m and inhibition by swainsonine as the intact enzyme. This cleavage product also contains most, if not all, of the carbohydrate of the intact glycoprotein. Sequencing and amino acid analysis of both forms of the enzyme have revealed that the 110 kDa form differs from the intact enzyme by an amino-terminal fragment highly enriched in hydrophobic amino acids (Moremen and Touster, 1986b) .\n\nThese results suggest that mannosidase II is anchored to the Golgi membranes through an amino-terminal membrane-anchoring domain, an orientation characteristic of an increasing number of integral membrane enzymes and receptor proteins (for review, see Wickner and Lodish, 1985) . The fact that the catalytic domain does not appear to be independently associated with the membrane suggests that the proteolytically sensitive -14 kDa region may function to anchor the catalytic domain to the membrane and also may contain the structural information necessary for Golgi localization. This hypothesis is presently being examined by cloning the enzyme and testing the expression and localization of the intact and modified versions of the gene in cultured cells.\n\nProcessing Mannosidases Tulsiani and Touster (1985) presented evidence for a novel \u00ab-mannosidase in rat brain. This enzyme, which was partially purified from a crude rat brain microsomal fraction, has a pH optimum of 6.0 and was found to have specificity toward the a-1,2, a-1,3, and a-1,6 linkages present in high-mannose oligosaccharides. The enzyme can cleave Man 9 _ 5 GlcNAc down to Man 3 GlcNAc and exhibits similar rates of reaction toward Man 8 GlcNAc, Man 5 GlcNAc, and GlcNAcMan 5 GlcNAc. p-Nitrophenyl mannose is a very poor substrate for the enzyme, and the enzyme is not inhibited by swainsonine or dMM. The fact that it does not bind to Con A suggests that it is not a glycoprotein.\n\nThese results indicate that this brain membrane-bound enzyme is distinct from any of the previously characterized processing mannosidases, the cytosolic mannosidase, or the lysosomal mannosidase (see Table I ). The fact that no detectable mannosidase II was present in rat brain was also used as an explanation for the absence of neurological effects or oligosaccharide accumulation;in rat brain following the feeding of swainsonine. A surprising finding was that this novel brain mannosidase crossreacted with an antibody raised to the rat liver cytosolic mannosidase.\n\nThe two enzymes differ in several respects, however. The brain membrane enzyme does not act on p-nitrophenyl mannoside and is not inhibited by zinc ions. The two enzymes are similar in their pH optima, lack of binding to Con A, and lack of sensitivity to swainsonine or dMM. Immunohistochemical staining using an antibody raised against the brain cytosolic enzyme revealed that, while most of the reactivity was in the cytosol, postsynaptic densities were also immunoreactive (Zannetta et al.y 1983) . The possibility was presented that the cytosolic and membrane-bound forms both possess a common subunit or are derived from a common precursor (Tulsiani and Touster, 1985) .\n\nThe presence of a single enzyme in brain microsomes of the rat, pig, and sheep capable of fully processing Man 9 GlcNAc to a Man 3 GlcNAc structure without the intermediate synthesis of the GlcNAcMan 5 GlcNAc structure necessary for mannosidase II activity suggests that this tissue may have a novel method for oligosaccharide processing. Glycosyltransferases might extend the trimannosyl core structure of this product into the complex oligosaccharides of brain tissue. However, in spite of the apparent absence of mannosidase II in brain, swainsonine administration to the pig and sheep produces the accumulation of brain glycoproteins containing oligosaccharides that appear to be of the hybrid type (D. R. P. Tulsiani and O. Touster, unpublished) . This result suggests that the brain of at least two species contains a swainsonine-sensitive a-mannosidase other than mannosidase II.\n\nThis chapter has summarized the present state of research on mannosidases involved in glycoprotein processing. In spite of the advances made in understanding the roles of these enzymes, many intriguing questions still remain. The apparent multiplicity of mannosidases cleaving early high-mannose intermediates suggests that there may be a distinct physiological function for each of the a-l,2-mannosidase activities. The finding of a broad-specificity membrane-bound mannosidase in brain also raises questions about alternate routes of biosynthesis of glycoproteins. Finally, fundamental questions in cell biology, such as determinants for the localization of organellar glycoproteins and regulation of the levels of glycoprotein processing enzymes in the cell, are being pursued through the cloning and expression of processing mannosidases. The solutions to these and other problems will, we hope, lead to a further understanding of the role of glycoprotein structure in the physiology of a cell."}
