{"title": "39. The cat with tremor or twitching Diseases causing tremor or twitching COARSE TREMOR AND TWITCHING (INTENTIONAL)", "body": "\u2022 Tremor is an involuntary, rhythmic, oscillatory movement of all or part of the body. It results from the alternate or synchronous contraction of reciprocally innervated, antagonistic muscles.\n\n\u2022 Disease of the nervous system (central and peripheral) and muscle may result in tremor, shaking or twitching. \u2022 Usually tremors with increased amplitudes and slower frequencies (coarse tremor) are associated with cerebellar disorders. Those tremors with decreased amplitudes and faster frequencies (fine tremor) are associated with diffuse central nervous system disease or muscle weakness. \u2022 Tremor can have differing amplitudes (the distance traveled during the movement) and frequencies (how fast the tremor is).\n\n\u2022 Disease of the nervous system that results in persistent, generalized (whole body) tremor is usually diffuse (encephalitis). Using storage diseases as an example, these diseases tend to be breed-associated. Clinical signs usually begin in cats less than 1 year of age. Slowly progressive signs are typical and there is no hyperesthesia. When the disease involves the cerebellum, ataxia and hypermetria are most common.\n\nTumors involving the cerebellum usually occur in middle-aged to older cats. Clinical signs of cerebella dysfunction may occur acutely or be more chronically progressive.\n\n\u2022 Cerebellar hypoplasia** (p 855)\n\nCats are born with or develop this disease immediately after birth. Clinical signs become apparent when the cat begins moving and are most obvious when the animal begins walking (somewhere between 4-8 weeks of age). Intention tremor, ataxia and hypermetria are often found.\n\n\u2022 Encephalitis (p 859) Viral, fungal, protozoan, bacterial, rickettsial and parasitic agents are potential causes. Multifocal central nervous system signs are most common. Fever and leukocytosis are inconsistent findings. Other signs of a polysystemic disease such as coughing, vomiting or diarrhea may be associated.\n\nUsually associated with an acute onset of clinical signs reflective of an intracranial problem. Signs present often include alterations in consciousness, paresis and cranial nerve abnormalities. Fresh blood from lacerations on or around the head, skull fractures, blood in the ear canals and scleral hemorrhage may be clues to a previous traumatic incident.\n\n\u2022 Degenerative diseases of the nervous system (p 867)\n\nSome of these diseases are inherited with clinical signs beginning in cats less than 1 year of age. Examples include hypomyelination or dysmyelination and motor neuronopathies. Affected animals tend to have a \"bouncy\" movement. With other degenerative diseases, such as encephalomyelopathy of young cats and spongiform encephalopathy, tremoring may be acquired in young to middleaged cats.\n\n\u2022 Myotonia (p 866)\n\nClinical signs are most often recognized in cats between 1-12 months of age. Classically affected cats have a stiff-stilted gait with increased size of the muscles. Tremor, if present, is usually of short duration and episodic.\n\nMost often occurs after thyroidectomy. Muscle weakness, tetany and tremors are typical. Preparturient hypocalcemia presents as anorexia, lethargy, trembling, muscle twitching and weakness. Primary hypoparathyroidism occurs in young to middle-aged cats and can result in similar clinical signs.\n\nTypically older cats or Burmese < 1 year of age. Signs include weakness, inability or reluctance to walk or jump, stiff, stilted gait, neck ventroflexion and sensitivity to palpation of larger muscle groups. A short duration tremor may be present episodically and usually when the cat attempts purposeful movement.\n\n\u2022 Neoplasia (p 869)\n\nA 2-year-old cat has been reported with diffuse tremor resulting from multiple meningiomas. Clinical signs progressed to paresis and ataxia.\n\n\u2022 Encephalomyelitis (p 864)\n\nClinical signs are often diffuse and may not localize to a single area within the nervous system. Fever and leukocytosis may be present but are inconsistent findings. The associated tremor tends to involve the entire body and is rapid and of low amplitude (fine).\n\n\u2022 Myasthenia gravis (p 866)\n\nTypically adult cats or Siamese < 1 year of age. Tremor usually is episodic and occurs during movement. Generalized weakness, a stiff, stilted gait prior to collapse, ventral neck flexion and decreased palpebral reflexes may also be seen. The gait improves with rest.\n\nThis is a diffuse nervous system disease that primarily affects the spinal cord. A viral cause is suspected. Signs have a slow onset and are chronically progressive. They include pelvic limb ataxia, paresis, hypermetria, intention tremors, decreased pupillary light reflexes, seizures and hyperesthesia over the thoracolumbar area.\n\n\u2022 Feline hyperesthesia syndrome* (p 862)\n\nA syndrome in which cats become suddenly startled, agitated and often run madly, usually when stimulated over the thoracolumbar area of the spine. Skin rippling and spasms occur usually over the lumbar region and the cat may lick or bite this area.\n\nTremor is an involuntary, rhythmic, oscillatory movement of all or part of the body. It results from the alter-nate or synchronous contraction of reciprocally innervated, antagonistic muscles.\n\nTremor can be localized to one body area or be generalized and involve the whole body.\n\nTremors usually have a characteristic distance of travel (amplitude) and speed of travel (frequency). Tremors can be categorized generally into those that have an increased amplitude with a slower frequency (coarse tremor) or a decreased amplitude with a faster frequency (fine tremor).\n\nDisease of the nervous system (central and peripheral) and muscle may result in involuntary tremor, shaking or twitching.\n\nCerebellar disease usually results in a coarser tremor that worsens (increases in frequency or amplitude) when the animal moves in a goal-oriented fashion (intention tremor).\n\nOther signs of cerebellar disease that accompany cerebellar tremor include ataxia (incoordination; swaying from side to side), dysmetria (\"goose-stepping\"; overflexing of the limbs when walking), menace deficits (with normal vision, palpebral, and pupillary light reflexes), head tilt and nystagmus.\n\nFine tremor (decreased amplitude and increased frequency) is more often associated with diffuse neuronal disease or muscle weakness that result in involuntary muscle contraction.\n\nDiseases of the intracranial nervous system (primarily the cerebellum) resulting in tremor include storage diseases, brain tumor, encephalitis and vascularbased diseases.\n\nSystemic metabolic diseases altering neuronal or muscle membrane potentials (such as hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, hypokalemia) can result in tremor.\n\nDiseases that decrease neuronal impulse conduction via abnormalities of myelin (hypomyelination) often result in tremor.\n\nDiseases of the nervous system that result in persistent, fine tremor are usually diffuse (encephalitis). \n\nClinical signs are most apparent when the animal begins purposeful movement and attempts to walk.\n\nTremor accompanying the disease usually has a slower frequency (2-6 times/second) and larger amplitude.\n\nThe tremor worsens (increases in frequency or amplitude), when the cat moves in a goal-oriented way (e.g. bends down to eat), which is termed an intention tremor.\n\nOther signs include ataxia (incoordination; swaying from side to side), hypermetria (\"goose-stepping\"; overflexing of the limbs when walking), menace deficits (with normal vision and pupillary light reflexes), head tilt, and nystagmus (combination quick followed by slow movement of the eyes).\n\nClinical signs usually remain static or improve with growth as the cat compensates, causing the tremor to become less apparent.\n\nAntemortem testing for this disease often results in negative or normal findings.\n\nDefinitive diagnosis is usually rendered only at necropsy and histopathological examination of the nervous tissue.\n\nIn some instances of cerebellar atrophy, a smaller than normal cerebellum may be seen on magnetic resonance imaging of the intracranial nervous system. This is most readily seen on the sagittal view.\n\nOccasionally, inflammatory cells may be present in cerebrospinal fluid examination in cats with active panleukopenia viral infection. Cerebrospinal fluid with the other degenerative cerebellar conditions and with previous panleukopenia infection is usually normal.\n\nIn this age of cat, other inflammatory central nervous system abnormalities such as toxoplasmosis infection is possible.\n\nCongenital anatomical defects of the cerebellar may be present.\n\nTrauma occurring at a young age may permanently damage the cerebellum.\n\nNo treatment is currently helpful for cats affected with this disease.\n\nClinical signs associated with previous panleukopenia virus infection of the developing cerebellum usually remain static or improve with growth, causing the tremor to become less apparent.\n\nDo not vaccinate queens with modified live panleukopenia virus vaccine. \n\nExogenous injury to the brain occurs most commonly from automobile trauma, although gunshot wounds and falls may also occur.\n\nCerebellar involvement may result in intention tremor, decerebellate rigidity (extension of all four limbs and the trunk), ataxia, hypermetria, head tilt and nystamus.\n\nSigns usually begin acutely after trauma.\n\nIntracranial signs most commonly seen include stupor and coma, paresis and gait abnormalities, and cranial nerve deficits.\n\nEvidence of external trauma to the head and face such as facial lacerations, bleeding from the nose and mouth, bruising or hemorrhage in the external ear canals may be clues to the traumatic etiology, however, some animals that are uncoordinated may fall and injure themselves secondarily.\n\nThe diagnosis of trauma is usually straightforward when the trauma is witnessed.\n\nIn some instances, animals are presented with an acute onset of neurological signs and an unknown history, examining for external signs of trauma such as lacerations or skull fractures is important.\n\nEvaluating the retinas and external ear canals for acute hemorrhage may also provide clues to the diagnosis.\n\nAdvanced imaging studies such as CT or MR imaging are useful, primarily for determining structural damage to the brain.\n\n\u2022 Signs usually begin or are present in cats less than 1 year of age. \u2022 Signs usually are slowly progressive or remain unchanged. \u2022 Signs include coarse tremor, hypermetria, ataxia, intention tremor and menace deficits.\n\nSee main reference on pages 934 and 935 for details (The Cat With Ataxia Without Weakness).\n\nCerebellar degeneration is usually an inherited disease.\n\nA hereditary cerebellar degeneration has been described in Japan in cats. An autosomal recessive mode of inheritance was presumed.\n\nCerebellar degeneration with neuroaxonal dystrophy has been reported in domestic tricolored cats. This is inherited as an autosomal-recessive trait.\n\nStorage diseases result from inherited (or less commonly, acquired) intracellular metabolic derangements that result in abnormal metabolism of cellular products. Cellular products accumulate and afferent neuronal cells physiologically or mechanically, resulting in cellular dysfunction, and hence, clinical signs. Examples include gangliosidosis, sphingomyelinosis, globoid cell leukodystrophy and mannosidosis.\n\nClinical signs usually begin between 3-12 months of age.\n\nCerebellar disease usually results in a coarse tremor that worsens (increases in frequency or amplitude) when the animal moves in a goal-oriented fashion (intention tremor).\n\nOther signs of cerebellar disease that accompany cerebellar tremor include ataxia (incoordination; swaying from side to side), dysmetria (\"goose-stepping\"; overflexing of the limbs when walking), menace deficits (with normal vision and pupillary light reflexes), head tilt, and nystagmus (combination quickly followed by slow movement of the eyes).\n\nClinical signs of the hereditary cerebellar degeneration described in Japan in cats begin around 7-8 weeks of age and include head tremor along with ataxia, dysmetria, and intention tremor.\n\nCerebellar degeneration with neuroaxonal dystrophy in domestic tricolored cats results in head tremors and shaking. Clinical signs begin at 5-6 weeks of age and progress to ataxia and hypermetria. Affected kittens have a lilac color that darkens with age.\n\nIn cats with sphingomyelinosis (Niemann-Pick type C disease) clinical signs begin early in life (< 6 months) and progress to ataxia and hypermetria, absent menace responses, and occasionally positional nystagmus. Death usually occurs by 8-10 months of age.\n\nBalinese cats. Head tremor, head bobbing and dysmetria begin at 3-4 months of age. Clinical signs progress to ataxia and paresis, worse in the pelvic limbs.\n\nAntemortem testing for these diseases often results in negative or normal findings.\n\nDefinitive diagnosis is often rendered only at necropsy and histopathological examination of the nervous tissue.\n\nIn some instances of cerebellar atrophy, a smaller than normal cerebellum may be seen on magnetic resonance imaging of the intracranial nervous system. This is most readily seen on the sagittal view.\n\nCerebrospinal fluid with these degenerative cerebellar conditions is normal.\n\nWith hereditary cerebellar degeneration described in Japan in cats there is marked loss of Purkinje cells upon histologic evaluation of the cerebellum.\n\nIn cats with sphingomyelinosis (Niemann-Pick type C disease) cerebellar atrophy, Purkinje cell loss, and neuroaxonal dystrophy are the predominant pathological changes.\n\nIn this age of cat, other inflammatory central nervous system abnormalities such as toxoplasmosis infection is possible.\n\nCongenital anatomical defects of the cerebellar may be present.\n\nTrauma occurring at a young age may permanently damage the cerebellum.\n\nNo treatment is currently helpful for affected cats.\n\nClinical signs associated with degenerative cerebellar diseases progressively worsen.\n\nAnimals are commonly euthanized due to the progressive incapacitation.\n\nDo not breed cats affected that have produced kittens with a presumed genetic or congenital cerebellar disease.\n\n\u2022 Signs usually begin in cats 5 years of age or older. \u2022 Signs usually are progressive over weeks to months. \u2022 Occasionally, clinical signs begin acutely. \u2022 Intention tremor is often associated with other signs of cerebellar disease including ataxia, dysmetria, menace deficits, head tilt and nystagmus.\n\nSee main reference on page 824 for details (The Cat With Stupor or Coma).\n\nSigns reflect either primary nervous parenchymal damage from the tumor or secondary pathophysiological sequelae such as hemorrhage and edema.\n\nMeningiomas are the most common brain tumor in cats and are usually histologically benign.\n\nLess frequent tumors arise from astrocytes, oligdendrogliocytes, ependymal cells and choroid plexus cells.\n\nNeoplasia may secondarily involve the brain via metastasis or via direct extension from extraneural sites.\n\nClinical signs usually begin in cats 5 years of age or older.\n\nClinical signs usually are progressive over weeks to months.\n\nOccasionally, clinical signs begin acutely.\n\nIntention tremor is often associated with other signs of cerebellar disease including ataxia (incoordination; swaying from side to side), dysmetria (\"goose-stepping\"; overflexing of the limbs when walking), menace deficits (with normal vision and pupillary light reflexes), head tilt, and nystagmus (combination quick followed by slow movement of the eyes).\n\nRoutine laboratory investigations are normal.\n\nDiagnosis of a structural intracranial abnormality in the brain is most readily accomplished with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging or computed tomography (CT) of the brain.\n\nA broad-based, extra-axial (arising outside and pushing into the parenchyma) contrast-enhancing mass on CT or MR imaging is found in most instances of meningioma.\n\nThe CT and MR appearance of gliomas is varied and enhancement after contrast administration may not be present. As these tumors arise from brain parenchymal cells, they are found within the neuroaxis (intraaxial).\n\nChoroid plexus tumors, because of the increased concentration of blood vessels within the tumor, often enhance markedly after contrast administration.\n\nBecause of their association with the ventricular system, associated hydrocephalus is common.\n\nCerebrospinal fluid often has increased protein concentration but this finding is not pathognomonic for neoplasia.\n\nCerebrospinal fluid can contain evidence of inflammation (contains elevations in nucleated cells and protein content). If CSF is the only assessment made, an erroneous diagnosis of encephalitis may be rendered.\n\nCongenital and inherited cerebellar diseases occur in younger animals.\n\nCerebrovascular, traumatic and inflammatory conditions can mimic the signs of a brain tumor.\n\nCorticosteroids (prednisolone 1-2 mg/kg q 12 h) may reduce peritumoral edema and improve clinical signs.\n\nSurgical removal of primary brain tumors may be accomplished, especially with meningioma.\n\nA well-encapsulated, firm whitish mass is most often encountered at surgery in cats. Cortical parenchyma is usually not infiltrated but rather compressed in cats, leaving indentations in the nervous tissue parenchyma after resection.\n\nRadiation therapy (45-48 Gy) may control tumor growth of some brain tumors.\n\n\u2022 Diffuse or multifocal neurological signs.\n\n\u2022 Cerebellar signs such as intention tremor, ataxia, hypermetria, head tilt and nystagmus. \u2022 Cervical pain can be present. \u2022 Fever is an inconsistent finding. \u2022 Clues of systemic inflammatory disease such as chorioretinitis are often present. \u2022 Other signs of polysystemic disease such as coughing, vomiting or diarrhea may be present.\n\nThe source of the inflammatory reaction includes both infectious and non-infectious etiologies.\n\nNumerous infectious agents have been incriminated, with the incidence of infectious agents causing meningitis varying with geographic location.\n\nInfectious agents causing brain disease include viral (feline infectious peritonitis), fungal (cryptococcosis, blastomycosis, histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, aspergillosis), protozoal (toxoplasmosis), bacterial, rickettsial and unclassified organisms (protothecosis).\n\nareas of the nervous system including the intracranial structures and spinal cord. Very young and, conversely, very old cats seem predisposed. Of the two forms of FIP that exist in cats, the \"dry\" form commonly affects the nervous system. This viral infection results in an immune complex vasculitis, which is responsible for most of the pathological effects.\n\nToxoplasmosis (Toxoplasma gondii) can affect the nervous system at any level including the brain and spinal cord.\n\nNeosporosis results in necrotizing encephalitis in cats experimentally inoculated with Neospora caninum.\n\nOnly those cats that were concurrently immunosuppressed by administration of methylprednisolone had severe histological brain lesions.\n\nOf the fungal diseases of the brain in cats, cryptococcosis caused by Cryptococcus neoformans is the most common. The central nervous system is often affected through direct extension of the infection from the nasal passages or from disseminated infection from other organs.\n\nInvolvement of the intracranial nervous can occur with parasites such as Cuterebra larvae, toxocara, and aberrant heartworm migration.\n\nDepression, inappetence or anorexia and weight loss are common.\n\nClinical signs often reflect multiple levels of neurological involvement. Neurological signs may indicate diffuse or multifocal disease and often do not localize to a single area within the nervous system.\n\nParesis, gait abnormalities, proprioceptive deficits, cranial nerve defects, and occasionally stupor or coma may occur.\n\nCerebellar signs such as intention tremor, ataxia, hypermetria, head tilt and nystagmus may occur with involvement of the cerebellum.\n\nCervical pain can be present.\n\nFever is an inconsistent finding.\n\nFundic examination is important to look for clues of systemic inflammatory disease as chorioretinitis, which is often present with diseases causing systematic infection.\n\nOther systemic signs such as vomiting, coughing, and diarrhea may be seen concurrently.\n\nComplete blood cell count may show evidence of systemic inflammation (e.g. leukocytosis).\n\nSerum biochemical analysis may show evidence of systemic abnormalities if the disease diffusely affects the body (e.g. vasculitis) such as elevated globulin, CK, liver enzymes or creatinine.\n\nEvaluation of titers for the infectious diseases often helps to rule in or out the diseases.\n\nCerebrospinal fluid analysis (CSF) will usually show evidence of increased nucleated cells and/or elevated protein content. Occasionally, CSF will be normal.\n\n\u2022 Evidence of inflammation on CSF evaluation alone, however, is not specific for primary encephalitis as other CNS disease (e.g. neoplasia) may result in a CSF pleocytosis and protein increases. With cryptococcosis, identification of the organism from cytological evaluation of samples such as CSF, nasal discharge and skin lesions supports the diagnosis. A neutrophilic pleocytosis, and occasionally an eosinophilic pleocytosis may be found on CSF analysis. If positive, detection of the cryptococcal capsular antigen in serum is usually diagnostic. Tissue biopsy and fungal culture of CSF may be more definitive in the diagnosis as occasionally the serum titer is negative.\n\nWith parasites such as Cuterebra larvae, toxocara, and aberrant heartworm migration, CSF may show inflammation with eosinophils is some instances.\n\nImaging studies (CT and MR) are helpful for defining structural lesions. Multifocal, contrast-enhancing lesions are usually seen. Occasionally, non-contrastenhancing lesions are present, especially with toxoplasmosis.\n\nMultifocal signs are more suggestive of encephalitis.\n\nCats with encephalitis may present with signs similar to other intracranial diseases such as brain tumor, trauma, hydrocephalus and cerebrovascular disease.\n\nTreatment is directed at a specific infectious cause if found.\n\nWithout a definable cause of the encephalitis, the author uses trimethoprim-sulfadiazine (30 mg/kg PO q 12 h), clindamycin (25 mg/kg q 12 h), and corticosteroids (prednisone 1-2 mg/kg PO q 12 h) in combination.\n\nWhile corticosteroids are contraindicated with infectious diseases, they are often beneficial in the acute treatment of brain inflammation and edema. These associated pathophysiological events often lead to more neurologic deterioration than the organism itself.\n\nIf rickettsial diseases are endemic, chloramphenicol or doxocycline can be substituted or added to the regime.\n\nIf the animal is receiving phenobarbital, do not use chloramphenicol as this drug will decrease the metabolism of the barbiturate and the animal will become comatose and possible die. Also, chloramphenicol may result in bone-marrow suppression in cats.\n\nWith feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), no specific treatment is effective. Immunosuppressive therapy may result in short-term improvement of clinical signs.\n\nWith toxoplasmosis, treatment includes clindamycin and trimethoprim sulfa antibiotics.\n\nFor cryptococcosis treatments that have had some success for cyrptococcosis in cats include amphotericin B, fluconazole, itraconazole and flucytosine. See page 26 (The Cat With Signs of Chronic Nasal Disease) for treatment details.\n\nWith CNS parasites, treatment has not been attempted uniformly and treatment recommendations are anecdotal.\n\nMany of the encephalities are poorly responsive to treatment, and therefore morbidity and mortality is > 50%.\n\nSome infectious encephalities (e.g. toxoplasmosis) may be cured with appropriate treatment.\n\n\u2022 Tremors may be persistent or intermittent.\n\n\u2022 A history of exposure to a toxin is most helpful in diagnosis. \u2022 Diffuse CNS is often present in association with other systemic signs such as vomiting and diarrhea.\n\nToxins may lower the threshold for stimulation or directly stimulate muscles and nerves to result in tremor.\n\nOrganophosphate intoxication potentiates the effect of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction and other synapses, by binding with and inactivating acetylcholinesterase. This leads to increased acetylcholine concentrations at the neuromuscular junction, increased receptor stimulation and fatigue.\n\nHexachlorophene causes vacuolation of white matter that leads to abnormal impulse generation.\n\nCats with acute organophosphate intoxication may have signs including miosis, salivation, urination, defecation, as well as muscle weakness.\n\nA more persistent weakness without associated autonomic signs can occur with chronic organophosphate toxicity. Cats may attempt to walk a few steps, then collapse in sternal recumbency mimicking catoplexy/narcolepsy.\n\nHexachlorophene toxicity results in tremors as the primary clinical sign.\n\nIvermectin toxicosis has resulted in generalized ataxia, tremor, weakness, incoordination and miosis in a kitten.\n\nHistory of exposure to a toxic product is most helpful in establishing a diagnosis.\n\nFor organophosphate toxicity, decreased concentration of serum cholinesterase activity may lend support to the diagnosis. Depending upon the laboratory, values less than 500 IU/L (normal 900-1200 IU/L) are considered consistent with organophosphate toxicity. Cats with polyneuropathy from chronic OP toxicity may have normal serum cholinesterase activity.\n\nRule out other diffuse causes of tremor such as metabolic disease.\n\nPhysiological functions such as shivering from cold or apprehension should be considered.\n\nFor organophosphate toxicity, treatment includes protopam chloride 2-PAM (20 mg/kg q 12 h IV) which reactivates cholinesterase and diphenhydramine (1-2 mg/kg PO q 8-12 h) which reduces muscle fasciculations.\n\n\u2022 Atropine (0. \n\nThe cause is unknown.\n\nOne theory is that this activity is a manifestation of a focal seizure.\n\nAnother theory suggests that it is similar to the obsessivecompulsive behavior associated with Tourette's syndrome in humans, which is the result of dopaminergic hyperinnervation.\n\nSimilar clinical signs have been associated with a vacuolar myopathy in cats and toxoplasmosis.\n\nOthers have suggested that this may be behavioral disorder.\n\nSome believe that it begins with an inflammatory stimulus such as flea or food allergy dermatitis.\n\nCats may become agitated and aggressive and show skin rippling and muscle spasms, usually over the lumbar area with stimulation such as stroking over the thoracolumbar region.\n\nCats may appear as though they were startled, then exhibit frenzied behavior such as licking or biting at the flanks, back and tail or running.\n\nCats may appear as though they are hallucinating and have dilated pupils.\n\nSudden startling, running, frantic meowing, growling, hissing, swishing of the tail may also occur.\n\nEpisodes may occur multiple times in a day and last 1/2 min to 5 minutes.\n\nDiagnosis is usually made solely on clinical signs.\n\nA complete neurological examination should be performed to identify pain or deficits suggesting an underlying spinal lesion.\n\nSpinal radiographs should be performed to rule out lumbar and lumbosacral lesions.\n\nBiopsy of the paraspinal muscles should be used to rule out vacuolar myopathy.\n\nIgM and paired IgG titers 3-4 weeks apart can be used to help rule out active toxoplasmosis.\n\nDetermine if the cat is exhibiting normal behavior during estrus.\n\nInitial treatment should be with anti-inflammatory drugs. Corticosteroid therapy (prednisolone) may help if a flea allergy or other inflammatory stimulus is suspected. NSAIDs like piroxicam or meloxicam or megestrol can also be tried.\n\nBehavior-modifying drugs such as the tricyclic antidepressants amitryptyline (2 mg/kg or 5-10 mg/cat PO q 24 h), clomipramine (1-5 mg/cat PO q 12-24 h) or the selective seritonin uptake inhibitors fluoxetine (Prozac 0.5-4 mg/cat PO q 24 h) or paroxetine (Paxil, 0.5 mg/kg PO q 24 h) may be helpful in some cats.\n\nAnticonvulsants (phenobarbital beginning at 3 mg/kg PO q 12 h with dose adjustments to maintain trough serum levels at 20-35 \u03bcg/ml) may help if anti-inflammatory and behavior-modifying drugs are unsuccessful.\n\nFeeding food without preservatives has been suggested as helpful.\n\nCarnitine/coenzyme Q12 may help cats with vacuolar myopathy. Also antioxidants and omega-3 fatty acids may be useful.\n\nDecrease environmental stress.\n\nConsistent results with any treatment have not been obtained.\n\nFlea prevention.\n\nDecrease stress in the environment.\n\n\u2022 Tremor associated with this disorder is usually of short duration and episodic. \u2022 Stiffness and muscle spasm may also occur. \u2022 Twitching of the ears or facial muscles may be present. \u2022 Weakness, lethargy and anorexia are typical.\n\nDecreases in calcium decrease the threshold for neuronal and muscle depolarization.\n\nHypocalcemia most often results from iatrogenic injury to the parathyroid gland during surgical removal of thyroid tumors.\n\nPrimary hypoparathyroidism is reported but is rare.\n\nHypocalcemia associated with queening (eclampsia) is rarely reported but occurs.\n\nClinical signs include weakness, tetany and tremors.\n\nSpontaneous muscle depolarization can manifest as muscle fasciculation, cramping, rigidity and twitching.\n\nQueens with preparturient hypocalcemia present with anorexia, lethargy, trembing, muscle twitching and weakness. They resemble the clinical picture of hypocalcemia in cows (predominantly weakness), rather than the violent muscle tremor of eclampsia in dogs.\n\nCats with primary hypoparathyroidism are more often male and typically range from 6 months to 7 years of age. Signs include lethargy and anorexia and a sudden or gradual onset of neuromuscular signs including focal (e.g. ears or facial muscles) or generalized muscle tremors, seizures, weakness or ataxia.\n\nDiagnosis is confirmed by finding decreased (usually less than < 1.5 mmol/l (6 mg/dl) serum calcium on serum biochemical analysis.\n\nRule out other inflammatory causes of muscle disease and acute organophosphate toxicity (history of exposure, signs and low cholinesterase activity).\n\nPhysiological functions such as shivering from cold or apprehension should be considered.\n\nTreatment involves calcium supplementation and vitamin D therapy.\n\nIf clinical signs are present, rapid institution of treatment is indicated with 0.5-1.5 ml/kg IV of 10% calcium gluconate. Infuse calcium slowly over 10 minutes while monitoring heart rate. Stop infusion if bradycardia occurs.\n\n(1-2 ml of 10% calcium gluconate diluted 1:1 in 0.9% saline q 8 hours) or IV calcium (10-20 ml of 10% calcium gluconate in 500 ml of 0.9% saline) with rate adjusted to maintain normocalcemia. Monitor calcium 2-3 times daily initially.\n\nLonger-term maintenance includes oral calcium (25 mg/kg q 8-12 hours) and vitamin D. The active form of endogenous vitamin D 3 (called calcitriol or 1,25 dihydroxycholecalciferol) is used at 2.5-10 ng/kg q 24 hours or synthetic vitamin D 3 (dihydrotachysterol) at 0.02-0.03 mg/kg q 24 hours for 3 days, then 0.01-0.02 mg/kg q 6-24 hours.\n\nCalcium should be monitored carefully, as hypercalemia is nephrotoxic.\n\nAdjustments to doses should be made every 1-3 days based on calcium concentrations.\n\nIf hypocalcemia is the result of thyroidectomy, calcium and vitamin D therapy can be reduced gradually over 2-3 weeks, and stopped if calcium remains in the normal range.\n\nAcute hypocalcemia following bilateral thyroidectomy can be fatal if not recognized early and appropriate therapy instituted.\n\nWhen performing bilateral thyroidectomy, allow 3-4 weeks between removal of each lobe.\n\n\u2022 Any aged cat may be affected.\n\n\u2022 A diffuse, whole-body, low-amplitude, higher-frequency tremor is present \u2022 Animals may twitch periodically. \u2022 Neurological signs are often diffuse.\n\nThis syndrome is associated with histological evidence of inflammation of the CNS. However, a consistent infectious etiology has not been identified.\n\nEncephalomyelitis is a much rarer cause of tremor in cats compared to dogs.\n\nAny age of cat may be affected.\n\nA diffuse, whole-body, low-amplitude (fine), higherfrequency tremor is present.\n\nAnimals may also twitch periodically.\n\nOther neurological signs that may be present in cats with encephalomyelitis include seizures, blindness, conscious proprioceptive deficits and cranial nerve deficits.\n\nNeurological signs may not localize to a single area within the nervous system.\n\nFever and leukocytes may be present but are inconsistent findings.\n\nEvidence of chorioretinitis may be present on fundic examination.\n\nCerebrospinal fluid may contain increased numbers of nucleated cells and/or elevated protein concentrations.\n\nNucleated cell counts can vary from mildly inflammatory (0.005-0.020 \u00d7 10 9 cells/L [5-20 cells/\u03bcl]; normal < 0.002-0.005 \u00d7 10 9 cells/L [2-5 cells/\u03bcl]) to greatly inflammatory (> 0.05 \u00d7 10 9 cells/L [50 cells/\u03bcl]).\n\nThe nucleated cell type is variable, but most often is a mononuclear cell population. Neutrophils may also be seen.\n\nIn cats with FIP, CSF protein concentrations are usually elevated at greater than 2 g/L (200 mg/dl), and nucleated cell counts are greater than 0.1 \u00d7 10 9 cells/L (100 cells/\u03bcl).\n\nIn cats with FIP the predominant nucleated cell type present in the CSF is neutrophils\n\nIn cats with encephalitis from other suspected viral etiologies, CSF protein concentrations are usually less than 1 g/L (100 mg/dl), and nucleated cell counts are less than 0.05 \u00d7 10 9 cells/L (50 cells/\u03bcl).\n\nAdvanced imaging studies (CT or MR) may show multifocal lesions. Often these lesions are enhanced by intravenous contrast administration.\n\nRule out other inflammatory, metabolic, and degenerative causes of tremor.\n\nPhysiological functions such as shivering from cold or apprehension should be considered.\n\nTreatment with corticosteroids (prednisolone 2 mg/kg q 12 h initially) may improve clinical signs.\n\nIf clinical signs improve, the corticosteroid therapy should be slowly tapered (over months) to prevent recurrence.\n\nClinical response to corticosteroid is variable. \n\nSignalment is typically aged cats > 8 years or young Burmese < 1 year (usually 2-6 months).\n\nTypically there is a history of acute onset of weakness. However, decreased activity and inappetence are often present for weeks to months prior to presentation.\n\nA short-duration tremor may be present episodically and usually when the cat attempts purposeful movement\n\nClinical signs include ventral neck flexion, stiff, stilted gait, and a reluctance to walk or jump. Typically, weak cats do not walk far, but soon sit or lie, flopping down, instead of carefully sitting as normal cats do. Sensitivity to palpation of larger muscle groups may be noticed.\n\nDyspnea occurs when the potassium is very low (2.0-2.5 mmol/L), because of weakness of the respiratory muscles. It may occur after fluid administration because volume dilution and increased urinary potassium loss induced by diuresis may lead to further worsening of the hypokalemia.\n\nYoung Burmese cats are susceptible to this disease, and potassium depletion may have played a role in the previously described myopathy of Burmese cats.\n\nTransient episodes of weakness may occur beginning between 2-12 months of age.\n\nDiagnosis is made by finding decreased serum potassium concentrations (usually < 3.5 mmol/L) in association with clinical signs. The severity of signs varies between cats when potassium is 2.5-3.5 mmol/L. Below 2.5 mmol/L and especially below 2.0 mmol/L, signs are life threatening, with death occurring from respiratory muscle failure.\n\nSerum creatine kinase (CK) may be elevated reflecting the mypoathy associated with hypokalemia.\n\nElectrodiagnostic evaluation is rarely performed. Abnormalities that may be found include increased insertional activity, fibrillation potentials and positive sharp waves, and some bizarre high-frequency discharges.\n\nMuscle biopsies often have minimal change present. Mild myonecrosis is possible.\n\n\u2022 Usually present in young cats as a congenital problem. \u2022 Stiffness and muscle spasm found at gait. \u2022 Steps are short and the limbs are stilted. \u2022 There is an increase in muscle size.\n\nCats with myotonia have sustained muscle contraction, which is initiated voluntarily or with stimulation, and sustained involuntarily.\n\nExcessive muscle contraction is thought to be due to an abnormal muscle cell membrane that supports persistent depolarization.\n\nSigns are first evident in young cats < 1-2 years of age.\n\nAffected cats often have a stiff, stilted gait and have large, bulky muscles on palpation.\n\nMuscle dimpling may occur with direct muscle percussion.\n\nTremor, if present, is usually of short duration and episodic.\n\nElectromyography demonstrates the characteristic myotonic potentials (sounds like a motorcycle revving its engines), and muscle biopsies may be supportive of the diagnosis.\n\nRule out other myopathies such as X-linked muscular dystrophy (increased serum creatine kinase, typical muscle biopsy findings). Myotonia has characteristic EMG findings.\n\nNo treatment has been described in cats.\n\n\u2022 Adult cats or Siamese < 1 year of age. \u2022 Tremor with this disease is usually episodic and occurs during attempts at movement, muscle weakness induced by movement. \u2022 Ventral neck flexion may also be seen. \n\nMuscle tremors are usually episodic and occur in muscles that are being used. This is a rare disease in cats. Generally a disease of adult cats, except for the congenital form in Siamese which presents at < 6 months of age.\n\nExercise intolerance and episodic weakness induced by walking or playing are typical signs. The cat may walk a few steps and flop down. Recovery occurs with rest.\n\nA stiff, stilted gait is often noted prior to collapse.\n\nWeakness of facial muscle may also be seen, and this is most evident as a decrease in the palpebral reflex and narrowing of the palpebral fissure. This appears to be a more consistent finding in cats versus dogs.\n\nMegaesophagus is uncommon and may lead to aspiration pneumonia.\n\nOne cat has been reported with a jaw-drop and dysphagia as the only clinical signs.\n\nDiagnosis is based upon clinical signs of exerciseinduced weakness that is resolved with edrophonium.\n\nAn edrophonium response test may suggest the disease if strongly positive. Edrophonium is an anticholinesterase that potentiates acetylcholine (ACH) at the neuromuscular junction. When given IV (0.1 mg/kg), this drug can reverse the clinical weakness seen with myasthenia gravis for a short period of time.\n\nElectromyography and nerve conduction studies will be normal. A decremental response may be seen during repeated stimulation of a peripheral nerve in some, but not all cats.\n\nSingle-fiber EMG is a relatively new technique that may aid diagnosis of this disease in the future.\n\nDocumentation of antibodies to the acetylcholine receptor in serum appears to be the most definitive diagnostic test. In congenital disease, however, these antibodies will not be present.\n\n\u2022 Some degenerative diseases occur in younger animals and some in older animals. \n\nA number of degenerative nervous system diseases have been reported in various locations around the world. These include encephalomyelopathy, spongiform encephalopathy, hypo or dysmyelination and motor neuronopathies.\n\nSome degenerative diseases occur in younger animals and some in older animals. Some of the degenerative diseases are inherited and signs begin in cats less than a year of age.\n\nAn encephalomyelopathy of young cats has been reported in the United Kingdom. Wallerian degeneration was noted primarily involving the spinocerebellar pathways and the ventral funiculus of the spinal cord. A viral etiology was suggested but not proven.\n\nA spongiform encephalopathy occurs in older cats in the United Kingdom and a prion may be the cause.\n\nHypomyelination or dysmyelination of the CNS has been reported in two Siamese cats. Pathologically there was a deficiency of myelin primarily in the ventral and lateral aspects of the spinal cord. Abnormal oligodendrocyte numbers or function is the suggested pathogenic mechanism.\n\nMotor neuronopathies are diseases that affect the cell bodies of the lower motor neuron leading to degeneration of the cell in the ventral horn of the spinal cord and occasionally the cranial nerve nuclei. Histologic lesions are most severe in the ventral spinal gray matter and consist of neuronal cell loss and gliosis.\n\nWith the encephalomyelopathy of young cats reported in the United Kingdom, cats 3-12 months were affected, however, the disease was seen in cats up to 3 years of age. Clinical signs usually are progressive over weeks to months.\n\nSigns include ataxia, paresis, and \"head shaking\". Ataxia of the pelvic limbs was the initial clinical sign noted.\n\nSpongiform encephalopathy occurs in older cats, and clinical signs include muscle tremors, ataxia, dilated unresponsive pupils, jaw champing, salivation, and behavior abnormalities. In one additional cat the tremor was most obvious in the pelvic limbs. Signs progressed to severe ataxia and hypermetria.\n\nClinical signs of hypomyelination or dysmyelination consist of diffuse tremor accompanied by frenzied behavior and indiscriminate biting. Clinical signs are worsened with activity. Reported cats were young Siamese < 1 year of age.\n\nMotor neuronopathies were reported in adult cats and signs included tremor, progressive weakness, cervical ventroflexion, dysphagia, and muscle atrophy.\n\nAntemortem testing for many of these diseases often results in negative or normal findings.\n\nDefinitive diagnosis is often rendered only at necropsy and histopathological examination of the nervous tissue.\n\nIn some instances of motor neuronopathies, mild to moderate fibrillation potentials were found in the appendicular and paraspinal muscles with electromyography.\n\nCerebrospinal fluid with these degenerative conditions is normal.\n\nRule out other metabolic, inflammatory, and toxic causes of tremor.\n\nPhysiological functions such as shivering from cold or apprehension should be considered.\n\nNo treatment is currently helpful or has been attempted for affected cats.\n\nClinical signs associated with degenerative diseases progressively worsen.\n\nAnimals are commonly euthanized due to the progressive incapacitation.\n\nDo not breed cats affected that have produced kittens with a presumed inherited disease.\n\n\u2022 Young to middle-aged cats have been affected. \u2022 Clinical signs have a slow onset and are chronically progressive. \u2022 Signs are variable but include pelvic limb ataxia, seizures, paresis, hypermetria, intention tremors, decreased pupillary light reflexes, and hyperesthesia over the thoracolumbar area.\n\nLesions primarily occur in the spinal cord and include severe degeneration and loss of neurons, perivascular mononuclear cuffing, lymphocytic meningitis, neuronphagia and glial nodules.\n\nA viral etiology was suggested but not proved.\n\nYoung to middle-aged cats have been affected."}
