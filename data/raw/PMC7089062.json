{"title": "Short communication: antiviral activity of porcine IFN-\u03bb3 against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus in vitro", "body": "Interferons (IFNs) play an important role in the innate and adaptive immune responses against viral infections [20]. Type III IFNs (IFN-\u03bbs) were first identified in 2003 and are encoded by 1\u20133 functional genes in most mammalian species [22]. Humans and chickens have three IFN-\u03bbs as follows: IFN-\u03bb1 (IL-29), IFN-\u03bb2 (IL-28A), and IFN-\u03bb3 [12]. Mice have genes only for IFN-\u03bb2 and IFN-\u03bb3 [7]. Two members, IFN-\u03bb1 (IL-29) and IFN-\u03bb3 (IL-28B), have been recently identified in swine [21].\n\nDistinct from the receptors for type I and II IFNs, type III IFN exerts its action through a heterodimeric cellular receptor that is composed of IL28-R\u03b1, a type III IFN specific subunit, and IL10-R\u03b2, a subunit shared by other IL-10-related cytokines [18]. As IFN-\u03bbs bind to these unique receptors, they activate Janus kinase I, together with signaling transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) factors 1 and 2, resulting in the formation of the IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) complexes [14]. This then induces the transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), such as 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase (2\u2032,5\u2032-OAS) and MxA genes [14]. IFN-\u03bbs share a number of common biological characteristics with type I IFN, such as antiviral, antiproliferative, and antitumor activities [3, 8, 9, 17]. The expression of IFN-\u03bbs can be induced by viral infection or treatment with poly (I:C) as well as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [17]. Previous studies have demonstrated that IFN-\u03bbs can induce protection against several viruses in cell culture, such as West Nile virus [16], influenza A virus [10], porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus [15], and foot-and-mouth disease virus [5].\n\nPorcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a member of the family Coronaviridae, and is an important etiological agent of lethal watery diarrhea in piglets, resulting in large economic losses in many Asian and European countries [23, 24]. Previous research has demonstrated that PEDV infection suppresses the production of IFN-\u03b2, and viral papain-like protease 2 has been identified as a type I interferon antagonist [4, 6, 24, 25]. In this study, poIFN-\u03bb3 was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli using the pET-32a vector. In addition, the molecular characterization of poIFN-\u03bb3 was analyzed, and the antiviral activity of poIFN-\u03bb3 against PEDV was evaluated. Furthermore, a real-time quantitative PCR assay was used to quantify the expression levels of ISGs, OAS1, and Mx1 induced by poIFN-\u03bb3 to elucidate the mechanism of poIFN-\u03bb3 antiviral efficacy.\n\nBased on our experiments, poIFN-\u03bb3 gene was amplified using RT-PCR from ST cells stimulated with poly (I:C) and subcloned into pET-32a expression vector, transformed into host bacteria Rosetta gami B. The recombinant poIFN-\u03bb3 was expressed by IPTG induction and existed in inclusion bodies (Fig. 1). PoIFN-\u03bb3 was purified by Ni\u2013NTA affinity chromatography using an \u00c4KTA purifier FPLC (GE Healthcare). After refolding, the eluted protein was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and filtered through a 0.22-\u03bcm filter and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C for further use. The purified poIFN-\u03bb3 protein was tested via the CPE inhibition assay using Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)/MDBK systems. The results demonstrated that poIFN-\u03bb3 possessed an anti-VSV activity.\n\n\nThe sequencing results demonstrated that the full-length cDNA of poIFN-\u03bb3 contains 588 bp and encodes 196 amino acid residues. The identified poIFN-\u03bb3 sequence encodes a protein of MW = 21486.09 with a pI of 9.27 (http://web.expasy.org/compute_pi/). Moreover, a predicted signal peptide is located between amino acids 1 and 23 [2] and a putative N-linked glycosylation sequence was between amino acids 71 and 74 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetNGlyc/) (Fig. 2a, c).\n\n\nTo gain insight into the poIFN-\u03bb3, BLASTN was performed using the IFN-\u03bb3 sequences from nine species in GenBank. The nucleic acid sequence analysis revealed that poIFN-\u03bb3 had a high similarity to Ovis aries IFN-\u03bb3 (GenBank No. XM_004015683; 87.4 %), Bos taurus IFN-\u03bb3 (GenBank No.XM_003585012; 85.5 %), Tupaia belangeri IFN-\u03bb3 (GenBank No. JX185489; 80.9 %), Pan troglodytes IFN-\u03bb3 (GenBank No. XM_001135462; 80.9 %), Homo sapiens IFN-\u03bb3 (GenBank No. NM_172139; 78.9 %), and Equus caballus IFN-\u03bb3 (GenBank No. NM_172139; 78.1 %), respectively. The amino acid sequence analysis results showed that poIFN-\u03bb3 also has a high identity to O. aries (78.1 %), B. taurus (76.0 %), T. belangeri (71.3 %), E. caballus (69.9 %), and H. sapiens (69.9 %) IFN-\u03bb3. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using the MEGA program and a neighbor-joining analysis method based on the DNA sequences. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that the poIFN-\u03bb3 is located on the same branch as the B. taurus and O. aries genes (Fig. 2b).\n\nFor the studies of antiviral activity, PEDV strain CV777 was used as a model virus to evaluate the antiviral activity of poIFN-\u03bb3. The virus was propagated and titrated in Vero E6 cells. Recombinant poIFN-\u03bb3 were expressed, purified, and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C in our laboratory. For the anti-PEDV effects, Vero E6 cells were incubated with poIFN-\u03bb3 either 24 h prior to PEDV infection, simultaneously with PEDV infection, or 12 h after PEDV infection. The productive PEDV infection was determined at day 2 postinfection. The viral titer was determined using TCID50. Also, the amounts of viral RNAs were detected by a real-time quantitative RT-PCR [13]. The results indicated that poIFN-\u03bb3 could effectively inhibit the PEDV replication under three different treatment conditions. The highest inhibition of PEDV was observed in Vero E6 cell cultures pretreated with poIFN-\u03bb3 (prior to PEDV infection) (Fig. 3a). To evaluate the dose-dependent effect of poIFN-\u03bb3 on PEDV infection, Vero E6 cells were pretreated with poIFN-\u03bb3 (10, 100, or 1000 ng/mL doses of poIFN-\u03bb3) for 24 h prior to PEDV infection. The cells were then infected with PEDV for 2 h, washed, and replenished with fresh medium containing the indicated poIFN-\u03bb3. Then, after 48 h infection, the cells were submitted to three freeze\u2013thaw cycles and titrated by TCID50. Treatment with 10, 100, or 1000 ng/mL doses of poIFN-\u03bb3 could protect Vero E6 cells from PEDV infection (Fig. 3c). As shown in Fig. 3b, treatment of Vero E6 cells with poIFN-\u03bb3 (100 ng/mL) could inhibit the replication of PEDV at 12, 24, 36, and 48 h after infection. Therefore, poIFN-\u03bb3 could significantly inhibit PEDV propagation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In addition, the results demonstrated that the poIFN-\u03bb3 can effectively reduce the amounts of PEDV RNAs in samples poIFN-\u03bb3 prior to PEDV infection. And, accompanying dose of poIFN-\u03bb3 increased (from 10 to 1000 ng/ml) and PEDV RNAs were reduced (Fig. 3d, e). These results were consistent with the TCID50 assay.\n\n\nTo better illustrate the mechanism of antiviral activity elicited by poIFN-\u03bb3 in Vero E6 cells, for the analysis of gene expression, we focused on ISGs (including ISG15, Mx1, and OAS1 and the primers of these three genes are listed in Table 1) in which the expression has been shown to be up regulated by type III IFN in other species [1]. Vero E6 cells were treated with 100 ng/mL poIFN-\u03bb3 and cell samples were collected 24 h posttreatment. Untreated Vero E6 cells were also collected as a calibrator to evaluate the mRNA levels of the chosen ISGs. GAPDH was used as a housekeeping gene for sample normalization. Total RNA was extracted from these Vero E6 cells, and qRT-PCR was performed using LightCycler\u00ae 96 SW 1.1 system and a SYBR Green I PCR master mix (Baoshengwu, Dalian, China). The samples were analyzed in triplicate. Levels of mRNA were calculated using the \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$2^{{ - \\Delta \\Delta C_{t} }}$$\\end{document}2-\u0394\u0394Ct method, which expresses mRNA in treated cells relative to untreated cells after normalizing to GAPDH. As shown in Fig. 4, all tested IFNs induced a significant increase in the mRNA expression of the antiviral genes ISG15, OAS1, and Mx1, all of which have well-known antiviral properties and may affect PEDV replication.\n\n\n\nPEDV replicates in the small intestine epithelial cells, resulting in an acute and highly contagious enteric disease [11]. Recently, studies have proved the importance of IFN-\u03bb for restricting viral infection in the intestinal epithelium [19]. IFN-\u03bb plays a potent antiviral state by regulating the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Therefore, IFN-\u03bb is important to efficiently restrict enteric coronavirus infections in the intestinal epithelial surface, including PEDV, TGEV, and possibly PDCoV infections. Correspondingly, these viruses may influence the host IFN-\u03bb response. So, it is beneficial to understand the pathogenic mechanisms of porcine enteric coronaviruses and host responses to such infections [26].\n\nIn summary, poIFN-\u03bb3 was successfully cloned, expressed, and possesses antiviral activity against PEDV in a dose- and time-dependent manner in vitro, suggesting that poIFN-\u03bb3 may be a broad-spectrum antiviral agent. The treatment of Vero E6 cells with poIFN-\u03bb3 induced the expressions of ISG15, OAS1, and Mx1. Moreover, this study provides a foundation to utilize type III IFNs as useful antiviral agents against swine infectious diseases."}
