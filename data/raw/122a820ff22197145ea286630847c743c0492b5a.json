{"title": "Identification of the Active Site Residues in the nsP2 Proteinase of Sindbis Virus", "body": "Proteins encoded by plus-stranded RNA viruses are commonly produced as polyproteins which are posttranslationally processed by one or more virally encoded proteolytic enzymes (reviewed in ). Viral proteinases have been described which resemble cellular proteinases belonging to three distinct families: the aspartate proteases that resemble pepsin, the serine/cysteine proteinases that resemble ttypsin or chymotrypsin, and the thiol proteases that resemble papain. The best characterized viral proteases are the aspartate proteases encoded by retroviruses. The residues making up the catalytic triad (Asp, Thr, Gly) of the HIV proteinase have been confirmed by site-specific mutagenesis (Loeb et a/., 1989) , and the structure of the proteinase has been determined to high resolution by X-ray crystallography (Navia et al,, 1989) . The three-dimensional folding of the viral proteinase resembles pepsin, suggesting a common evolutionary origin.\n\nProteinases similar to ttypsin or chymotrypsin have been identified in picornaviruses; alphaviruses; plant ' To whom reprint requests should be addressed. * Present address: Academic Hospital Leiden.

Originally these domains were predicted to have proteolytic activity based on the presence of certain conserved amino acid residues and on the basis of protein-modeling studies (Bazan and Fletterick, 1989; Boege et a/., 1981; Gorbalenya et al., 1989; Hahn eta/., 1985) . The catalytic triad of trypsin is composed of a serine, a histidine, and an aspartic acid; in the flavivirus NS3 proteinase (Chambers et a/., 1990) , the pestivirus p80 proteinase (Wiskerchen eta/., 1991) , and the alphavirus capsid proteinase , such a triad has been confirmed by mutagenesis. Furthermore, the crystal structure of the Sindbis alphavirus capsid protein has been determined to 3 A, and the C-terminal 151 amino acids are folded into a structure remarkably similar to that of chymotrypsin, with His-141, Asp-163, and Ser-215 forming the catalytic site (Choi et al., 1991 b) . The similarity in the folding of this capsid protein to that of chymotrypsin suggests that the virus acquired a proteinase from a host at some time in the past, and that all of the viral chymotrypsin-like proteinases will in fact be similar in structure.\n\nThe poliovirus 3C proteinase and the comparable 3C-like proteinases found in plant viruses and coronaviruses are also believed to be related to chymotrypsin, but in these cases the catalytic serine has been replaced by cysteine (reviewed in Bazan and Fletterick, 1990; Goldbach, 1990; Harris eta/., 1990) . Mutagenesis experiments and X-ray structure experiments should shortly confirm or disprove this prediction.\n\nRecently, we proposed that the nonstructural proteinase of Sindbis alphavirus was related to papain, thus representing a third family of viral proteinases (Hardy and Strauss, 1989; Strauss and Strauss, 1990) , and Gorbalenya et al. (199 1) proposed that papain-like proteinases were present in several RNA viruses. In papain, a cysteine and a histidine form a catalytic dyad, and there is conflicting evidence as to whether an asparagine residue is also an essential component of the active site (Higaki et al., 1987; Kamphuis et al., 1985) . Other proposed papain-like proteinases in RNA viruses include two domains within ORFl a of coronaviruses identified by protein modeling studies (Baker et al., 1991; Lee et al., 1991) and the HC-Pro protein of potyviruses, in which the catalytic Cys and His residues have been identified by mutagenesis (Oh and Carrington, 1989) . Interestingly, in a number of cases viruses encode proteinases of more than one type. Coronaviruses, for example, encode one or two proteins with sequences characteristic of a papain-like proteinase as well as one with similarity to a 3C-like proteinase within ORFl a (Boursnell eta/., 1987; Lee et al., 1991) . Similarly, in potyviruses there is both a 3Clike proteinase (the 49-kDa protein) as well as a papainlike proteinase (the HC or helper component protein) (Oh and Carrington, 1989 ). Finally, as described above, the alphaviruses possess a chymotrypsin-like structural proteinase and a papain-like nonstructural proteinase.\n\nIn this paper we report that Cys-481 and His-558 have been identified as the catalytic dyad of the Sindbis virus nsP2 nonstructural proteinase. Furthermore, we present data to show that none of the asparagine residues in the proteinase domain of Sindbis nsP2 that are conserved among alphaviruses are absolutely required for proteolytic activity, but that Trp-559, adjacent to His-558, is essential for function.\n\nFor mutagenesis, the Bglll (nt 2288) to Pstl (nt 3949) fragment from Toto50, a cDNA clone containing the entire sequence of Sindbis virus from which infectious RNA can be transcribed with SP6 polymerase (Rice et a/., 1987) was inserted into the replicative form of M 13mpl8, which had been digested with BarnHI and WI, to form M 13mpl8T2.155.\n\nUracil-containing single-stranded DNA was prepared from phage by the method of Kunkel (1985) and used as the template for oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (Zoller and Smith, 1984) after removal of low-molecular-weight material using NACS PrePac cartridges (Bethesda Research Laboratories). Both degenerate oligonucleotides capable of producing multiple mutations and oligonucleotides containing a single altered codon were used. Single-stranded DNAs from mutated bacteriophages were sequenced using appropriate sequencing primers and Sequenase (United States Biochemical) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mutated fragments 1236 nt in length were excised from M 13mpl8T2.155\n\nreplicative form with C/al and Pstl and inserted into the full-length clone by a three-piece ligation with the f'stl(3948) + Spel(5262) and Spel(5262) + CIal(2712) fragments of Toto50. Fulllength clones were checked for the presence of the mutations by direct sequencing of the double stranded plasmid DNA as previously described (Shirako et al., 1991) .\n\nMiniprep DNA (Sambrook et al., 1989) was treated with RNase A, linearized with Xhol, and treated with Proteinase K followed by repeated phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. Linearized DNA was resuspended in RNase-free TNE and frozen at -70\" until use. RNA transcripts were synthesized with SP6 polymerase as previously described (Rice et al., 1987) . Approximately 10 to 50 ng of RNA were translated in 9 PI of nuclease-treated, methionine-depleted reticulocyte lysate (Promega) supplemented with 20 pII/ of an amino acid mixture minus methionine and 1 O-l 5 PC [35S]methionine, for 90 min at 30\". Translation mixes were diluted 1: 1 with 2X Laemmli sample buffer containing 10% P-mercaptoethanol, and analyzed on 1 Oq/o SDS-containing polyactylamide gels (Laemmli, 1970) . Gels were fluorographed using En3Hance (NEN Research Products) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\nInfectivity assays RNA transcribed in vitro was transfected onto confluent monolayers of BHK cells in six-well cluster dishes (Costar) using the DEAE-Dextran method described in Rice et al. (1987) . For plaque assays the monolayers were overlayered with Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 19/o agarose. Plates were incubated for 2 days at 30\" and stained for at least 8 hr at 30\" with neutral red.\n\nDuring infection by Sindbis virus, the viral genome of 11.7 kb serves as a messenger for the translation of RNA-mutants previously mapped (Hahn er al., 1989) . Solid-stalked symbols indicate reduced or absent proteolytic activity; open symbols have wild type enzymatic activity as determined in w'fro. The shape of the symbol indicates the parental wild type amino acid; circles for Cys, squares for His, and triangles for Asn. Checkered diamonds indicate that the mutants are temperature-sensitive for proteolysis in viva . These substitutions are Phe-509 + Leu, Ala-51 7 + Thr, Asp-522 + Asn. and Gly-736 -, Ser. the nonstructural proteins that form the viral replicase (Strauss and Strauss, 1986) . Two polyproteins are produced upon translation. The first terminates at an inframe opal codon at nucleotides 5748-5750 and this polyprotein of 1896 amino acids is subsequently cleaved into nonstructural proteins nsP1, nsP2, and nsP3, numbered in order from 5' to 3' along the viral genome. The second polyprotein of 25 13 amino acids is produced by readthrough of the opal codon and contains in addition the sequences of nsP4; cleavage of this longer polyprotein produces nsP1, nsP2, nsP3, and nsP4, as well as nsP34, which is also thought to be functionally important . The genome organization and cleavage sites in the polyproteins are schematically illustrated in Fig. 1 .\n\nWhen Sindbis RNA, whether derived from the virion or from SP6 transcripts, is translated in a cell-free system, cleavage occurs at all three sites in the polyproteins to produce mature nsP1, nsP2, nsP3, and nsP4 and various intermediates (de Groot eta/., 1990 (de Groot eta/., , 1991 Hardy and Strauss, 1989) . In addition some unprocessed P123 and P1234 usually remain. The polypeptides produced in such a translation are shown in Fig.  2A (labeled \"Wild Type\"). The proteinase that cleaves all three sites in the polyproteins has been mapped by deletion studies to the C-terminal half of nsP2; only deletions that invaded the domain between amino acids 475 and 728 abolished all activity of the enzyme, and both nsP2 and polyproteins containing nsP2 were found to be proteolytically active (de Groot eta/., 1990; Hardy and Strauss, 1989) . Hardy and Strauss (1989) proposed that the enzyme is a papain-like proteinase in which Cys-481 and one of the five conserved histidines in this region form the active site of the enzyme.\n\nTo confirm that Cys-481 is required for activity of the nsP2 proteinase, we changed this residue to serine, glycine, or arginine. We also examined the effect of changing Cys-525, one of the two remaining conserved cysteine residues in the C-terminal half of nsP2, to serine or arginine, as well as changing Ser-535, which is found in a domain of limited similarity to the active site serine of serine proteinases, to threonine. The mutations were introduced into a full-length cDNA construct, and RNA was transcribed with SP6 RNA polymerase and translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysates. Representative results with the substitutions for Cys-481 and Cys-525 are shown in Fig. 2 , results for Ser-535 are shown in Fig. 3 , and a summary of these results is given in Table 1 . In the case of every mutant tested, multiple independent clones were examined to guard against the possibility that extraneous changes other than the mutation of interest might have affected the results.\n\nChange of Cys-481 to serine, glycine, or arginine resulted in abolishment of proteolytic activity. However, at least one substitution for Cys-525 and for Ser-535 resulted in an active enzyme. Taken together, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that Cys-481 is in fact a component of the active site of the nsP2 proteinase.\n\nHis-558 is also required for cleavage All five conserved histidines in the proteinase region, His-558, His-61 9, His-701, His-702, and His-709, were site specifically changed to alanine. In addition, His-558 was also changed to glutamine and tyrosine, and His-709 was also changed to tyrosine and arginine. Results for a representative sample of these mutants are shown in Fig. 3 , and the results for all of the His mutants are summarized in Table 1 . All three changes in His-558 totally abolished proteolytic activity. In contrast, change of any of the other four histidine residues to alanine, or change of His-709 to tyrosine, resulted in an active protease. Thus His-558 is uniquely required for proteolytic activity, and we postu- late that this residue forms part of the active site of the nsP2 proteinase.\n\nAs a word of caution on this method of determining catalytic site residues of a proteinase, note that two other substitutions, presumably not in the catalytic ' \"Lethal\" rndrcates that no plaques were found after transfection. Wild type constructs in this assay give \"Large\" plaques. \"Not detn.\" means that the viability was not tested. site, also abolished the enzymatic activity: His-709 + Arg and Cys-525 + Arg. It appears that the large, positively charged arginine residue perturbs the structure such that the protein is no longer proteolytically active. To rule out such structural alterations, in most cases we have tested more than one substitution for the wild type residue.\n\nIt has been suggested that in addition a cysteine and a histidine an asparagine residue is also important for catalysis by papain (Garavito et a/., 1977; Higaki et a/., 1987) . To investigate the possible role of an asparagine residue in the catalytic activity of the nsP2 proteinase, we mutagenized all four asparagine residues within the catalytic domain that are conserved among alphaviruses, namely Asn-561, Asn-609, Asn-614, and Asn-693. In each case we changed the asparagine to both aspartic acid and to serine, and the results are summarized in Table 2 . Substitution of either serine or aspartic acid for Asn-56 1 and Asn-6 14 produced enzymes with near wild type activity. Substitutions at Asn-693 gave variable amounts of processing, which depended upon the particular preparation of reticulocyte lysate used. Some experiments showed almost wild type processing (data not shown), while in the translation shown in Fig. 4 Asp-693 and Ser-693 both show markedly reduced processing. Similar variability in processing during in vitro translation in reticulocyte lysates has been noted for constructs containing the NS3 proteinase of flaviviruses (Preugschat et a/., 1991) . The reason for such variability is not clear, but may be due to variation in the translation efficiency or in the fidelity of folding of the translated proteins.\n\nAsn-609 + Ser gave reduced and variable processing; in the translation shown in Fig. 4 normal products are made but in very reduced amounts. For Asn-609 + Asp certain constructs seemed completely inactive, while others gave very incomplete processing, the extent of which was again dependent upon the reticulocyte preparation used. The severely reduced activity of the enzyme containing the Asn-609 + Asp mutation was not due to some additional lesion elsewhere in the protein. As a control a restriction fragment of 375 nucleotides containing this change from the mutant construct was excised, sequenced in its entirety, and reinserted into the Toto background, and the resulting construct was also nearly inactive. Presumably the presence of a charged residue at this position alters the overall conformation of the protein, leading to reduced activity. Multiple independent isolates of this mutation all had similar phenotypes.\n\nWe conclude that none of the conserved asparagines is absolutely required for proteolysis by the nsP2 proteinase, although substitutions for Asn-609 markedly reduce the activity of the enzyme, apparently without affecting the specificity for the cleavage sites. These results suggest that an asparagine residue is not a component of the active site of the enzyme.\n\nIn the case of most papain-family proteinases, the amino acid C-terminal to the catalytic histidine is small. In plant and animal proteinases, glycine or alanine is present at this position, whereas in other viral proteinases cysteine, serine, orvaline is found. However, all of the alphaviruses have tryptophan in this position. To determine whether Trp-559 was essential for proteoly- sis, we examined the mutant Trp-559 + Ala. When this construct was transcribed and translated in vitro, it was totally inactive. We conclude that Trp-559 is required for activity of the nsP2 protease.\n\nWe have tested a number of these constructs for viability, since the mutations had been inserted into a full-length clone of Sindbis virus from which infectious RNA can be transcribed in vitro. BHK cells were transfected with this RNA to look for the formation of plaques and the results of these experiments are shown in the last columns of Tables 1 and 2. In all cases in which proteolysis was abolished, no plaques could be detected after transfection, indicating that proteolytic processing of the nonstructural polyprotein is essential for Sindbis replication. These lethal mutations include all substitutions tested for the catalytic Cys-481 and His-558, as well as for Arg-709, Arg-525, and Ala-559.\n\nThe effects of the asparagine substitutions are not as straightforward. Asp-561 and Ser-561 gave normal processing during in vitro translation but produced small plaques and mixed plaque sizes respectively after transfection (Table 2) . On the other hand, the Ser-609 virus, which showed very little processing, gave wild type large plaques and the Asp-609 variant, which scarcely processed at all, gave minute plaques. Still more interesting are the results with the substitutions at Asn-614. Ser-614 gave processing similar to wild type and made slightly smaller plaques than the wild type. Asp-6 14 gave normal amounts of the fully processed proteins nsP1, nsP2, and nsP3 and seemed to process more effectively, since no uncleaved P123 was seen after in vitro translation (Fig. 4) but surprisingly, Asp-61 4 is lethal. Ser-693, which produced variable processing results, is also lethal.\n\nWe have shown that Cys-481 and His-558 are required for proteolytic activity by the Sindbis virus nsP2 proteinase. Any change in either of these residues abolished all activity by the enzyme and we propose that these two residues form the catalytic dyad of a papain-like proteinase. We also found that Trp-559 is required for proteolytic activity. All of the mutations which we made in this study, as well as temperaturesensitive mutations mapped in the proteinase domain of nsP2 (Hahn et al., 1989) are shown diagramatically in Fig. 1 . It is notable that in some cases substitution with an arginine residue killed the enzymatic activity, whereas substitution of other residues did not.\n\nA great deal has been learned about the thiol papain-like proteinases over the last few years. These proteinases include the prototype papain from papaya and other plant enzymes such as actinidin from kiwifruit and bromelain from pineapple as well as animal lysosomal enzymes such as the various cathepsins and calpain (reviewed in Baker and Drenth, 1987; Brocklehurst, 1987) . The crystal structure of papain has been determined to 1.65A resolution (Kamphuis et al., 1984) , but structural information is lacking for other enzymes. Because the amino acid similarities around the active site residues or throughout the rest of the proteins are limited and even the spacing between the active cysteine and histidine is quite variable, it remains to be determined what the relationships are between the plant, animal, and viral enzymes. In particular, it is not clear whether the folding of the viral proteins resembles that of the plant or animal proteins; similar folding would be strongly indicative of the descent of animal, viral, and plant proteins from a common ancestral enzyme.\n\nIn addition to the catalytic Cys-25 and His-l 59 residues of papain, other amino acid residues have been suggested to be important for catalysis. One such residue is Asn-175 which occupies precisely the same position in a possible catalytic triad of papain as Asp-l 02 in the catalytic triad of trypsin (Garavito et a/., 1977; Higaki et a/., 1987) . Furthermore, there is considerable sequence identity among papain-like enzymes around this amino acid. In order to examine whether an asparagine might be required for activity of the Sindbis nsP2 proteinase, all four asparagine residues within the proteinase domain that are conserved among alphaviruses were subjected to mutagenesis. In every case at least one substitution was partially tolerated, and we conclude that no asparagine residue is absolutely essential for proteolysis. This is not to say that changes at various asparagine residues were without effect: changes at both Asn-609 and Asn-693 reduced the extent of proteolysis, and Asp-614 appeared to enhance proteolysis.\n\nIf the role of Asn-175 in papain were to stabilize the active site histidine in a tautomerically favorable conformation through its hydrogen bonding to a nitrogen in the imadozole ring of His-l 59, it is conceivable that Trp-559 adjacent to His-558 could fulfill a related role in alphaviruses. As described above, the presence of a tryptophan following the active site histidine is exceptional among all of the papain-like enzymes described to date. In this model Trp-559 might interact with Trp-482 adjacent to the catalytic cysteine to maintain His-558 and Cys-481 in an active conformation.\n\nIn any event, an important role for this tryptophan residue is FIG. 5. Aligned amino acid sequences of papain-like proteinases in the vicinity of the conserved Cys and His catalytic residues, Alignment of the sequences in according to Gorbalenya et al. (1991) . Sequences are from the following sources: papain (Mitchel eta/., 1970) ; actinidin (Carne and Moore, 1978) ; bromelain. stem bromelain (Ritonja et al., 1989) ; CPl and CP2, cysteine proteinases I and II from Dicryostelium discoideum (Pears eta/., 1985) ; cathepsin H and cathepsin L, human cathepsins (Wiederanders et a/., 1991) ; cathepsin B, human cathepsin B (Ritonja eta/., 1985) ; calpain, chicken calpain (Ohno eta/., 1984) ; IBV, avian infectious bronchitis virus (Boursnell eta/., 1987) ; MHVl and MHV2, two copies of a papain-like proteinase in the long ORF 1 of mouse hepatitis virus (Lee er al., 1991) ; RUB, rubella virus (Dominguez et al., 1990) ; SIN, Sindbis virus (Strauss et a/., 1984) ; SF, Semliki Forest virus (Takkinen, 1986) ; ONN, O'Nyong-nyong virus (Levinson et al., 1990) ; RR, Ross River virus (Faragher et a/., 1988) ; TEV, tobacco etch virus, PPV, plum pox virus, TVMV, tobacco vein mosaic virus, and PVY. potato virus Y (Oh and Carrington, 1989) ; BaYMV, barley yellow mosaic virus (Kashiwazaki et al., 1991) ; HAV, hypovirulence-associated virus of chestnut blight fungus (Choi et a/., 1991a) . Numbers preceeding the first amino acid are either the number of residues to the known N-terminus of the protein (parentheses), or the number of residues to the beginning of the ORF encoding the proteinase (square brackets). Residues which are the same as those of papain are indicated with a dot. Within the alphaviruses and the potyviruses, residues which are conserved among four of five and three of four viruses, respectively, are boxed suggested by the fact that change of this residue to alanine resulted in loss of enzymatic activity.\n\nOther residues that have been proposed to be important for catalysis in papain-like enzymes include Gly-23, the two residues N-terminal to the catalytic Cys-25, and Gln-19, all of which are invariant in the plant and animal enzymes. It was suggested that these residues were involved in substrate binding and that a longer side chain at position 23 might block substrate binding by approaching too closely the side chain of Gln-19 (Baker and Drenth, 1987) . In alphaviruses the residue corresponding to position 23 of papain is asparagine, whereas that at position 19 is Ser in Sindbis virus and Gln in other alphaviruses (Fig. 5) . No firm conclusions can be drawn in the absence of crystal structures, because the substrate specificity of alphavirus nsP2 is very different from that of papain or cathepsin. Papain has a strong preference for bulky hydrophobic amino acids, phenylalanine, tyrosine, valine, or leucine in the P2 position (the penultimate amino acid relative to the site of cleavage), while the animal cathepsins require nonpolar side chains at this position. The P2 position of alphavirus cleavage sites is always glycine. When this glycine is changed to valine or to glutamic acid, the site becomes noncleavable . Comparisons of this nature assume that the overall folding of the viral proteinases is similar to that of papain, but confirmation of this will require three-dimensional crystal structures of the viral counterparts.\n\nFinally, there is the question of the viability of the various mutants. It is not surprising that mutations which kill the proteinase are lethal, such as the substitutions at Cys-481, His-558 and Trp-559, or that some substitutions which gave severely reduced processing were lethal or gave minute plaques. It was more surprising to discover that at position 614 the change from Asn to Asp-614 gave enhanced cleavage and apparently normal cleavage products but was lethal for viral replication, while the change to Ser-6 14 gave normal processing and normal virus production. Note that in Fig. 4 that the most obvious difference in the translation/processing pattern of Asp-61 4 was the lack of any residual P123. With the wild type, the amount of residual P123 varied with the batch of reticulocyte lysate, and there was a significant amount in the experiment shown in Fig. 4 . The lethality of this particular substitution may indicate a separate and necessary role for P123 (or for some other processing intermediate) in alphavirus replication. Similarly, it is of interest to compare the results for the two substitutions at Asn-693. Both gave variable and somewhat reduced proteolysis, but in one case (Ser-693) the change was also lethal. This may mean that slight changes in the rate of proteolysis, which may not be detectable in the cell-free translation system used, can still interfere with efficient virus replication. It is also possible that some of these changes affect the overall conformation of nsP2 and polyproteins containing nsP2. Such an altered conformation could affect the helicase activity or impair some as yet unknown function of nsP2 other than proteolysis. The fact that many changes are poorly tolerated illustrates the fact that the alphaviruses, as isolated in nature, appear to be optimized for replication."}
