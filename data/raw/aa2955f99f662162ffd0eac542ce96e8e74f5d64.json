{"title": "Peptide domains involved in the localization of the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus nucleocapsid protein to the nucleolus", "body": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is caused by an enveloped, positive-stranded RNA virus, PRRSV, belonging to the family Arteriviridae (Benfield et al., 1992; Plagemann, 1996; Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998) . PRRSV isolates are further divided into North American and European genotypes, represented by VR-2332 and the Lelystad virus, respectively (Nelsen et al., 1999) . Other members of the arterivirus group include lactate dehydro-genase-elevating virus (LDV) of mice, equine arteritis virus (EAV), and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV). The arteriviruses, toroviruses, and coronaviruses are members of a single order, Nidovirales (Cavanagh, 1997) . The arteriviruses structurally resemble togaviruses but similar to coronaviruses replicate via a nested 3\u0408-coterminal set of subgenomic mRNAs, which possess a common leader and a poly-A tail (Lai, 1990; Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998) .\n\nThe 15-kDa nonglycosylated N protein does not possess a signal peptide and is translated and maintained as mature 123 and 128 amino acid proteins, for VR-2332 and Lelystad viruses, respectively (Mardassi et al., 1996) . Even though the North American and European PRRSV N proteins are only about 63% identical at the amino acid level, they share a common antigenic region between amino acids 52 and 69 (Rodriguez et al., 1997; Meulenberg et al., 1998; Wootton et al., 1998) . During virus replication, the N protein localizes to the cytoplasm and nucleolus of cultured porcine macrophages and MARC-145 cells infected with either North American or European PRRSV genotypes (Rowland et al., 1999 ). An identical nucleolar-cytoplasmic distribution pattern is observed for the N protein of another arterivirus, EAV (Tijms et al., 2002) , and for the N proteins of group I, II, and III coronaviruses Wurm et al., 2001) . The arterivirus and coronavirus N proteins, when expressed alone or fused to the red-shifted enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), localize to the nucleolus, demonstrating that translocation across the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and accumulation in the nucleolus are independent of other viral proteins (Rowland et al., 1999; Wurm et al., 2001; Tijms et al., 2002) .\n\nWithin a population of infected cells, the intracellular distribution of arterivirus and coronavirus N proteins is highly variable. For example, a small percentage of coronavirus-infected cells possess N in the nucleolus . In a similar study using PRRSV, we observed that the percentage of infected cells containing N in the nucleolus was dependent on when observations were made. In addition, cells were identified that contained N in the nucleoplasmic region surrounding the nucleoli. These observations suggest that the localization of N to the nucleolus is a complex and highly regulated process.\n\nThe translocation of a protein from the cytoplasm, across the NPC, and into the nucleus is initiated by the binding of a nuclear localization signal (NLS) on the cargo protein to the importin-\u2423 shuttle protein. The cargo/importin-\u2423 complex binds to a second shuttle protein, importin-\u2424, which is then targeted to the NPC. In the presence of additional accessory proteins, including Ran-GDP, and ATP as a source of energy, the cargo/importin complex is transported across the NPC and released into the nucleoplasm (reviewed in Gorlich and Kutay, 1999) . Classical NLS sequences incorporate regions enriched in basic amino acids and generally conform to one of three types (Nakai and Kanehisa, 1992; Hicks and Raikhel, 1995) . The \"pat4\" NLS consists of a continuous stretch of four basic amino acids (lysine or arginine) or three basic amino acids associated with histidine or proline. The \"pat7\" NLS starts with a proline and is followed within three residues by a segment containing three basic residues out of four. The third type of NLS, known as a \"bipartite\" motif, consists of two basic amino acids, a 10-amino-acid spacer, and a 5-amino-acid segment containing at least three basic residues. There are exceptions to these established rules. Proteins that lack an NLS can localize to the nucleus as a result of cotransport with other nuclear proteins. Proteins which possess an NLS may remain cytoplasmic, especially if the NLS is not exposed on the protein's surface (Roberts et al., 1987) . And finally, small proteins less than 50 -70 kDa can passively diffuse through the nuclear pore complex (Paine, 1975; Gorlich and Kutay, 1999) . The addition of an NLS to a small protein that passively diffuses through the NPC confers to that protein all of the properties of NLS-dependent transport (Jans and Hubner, 1996) .\n\nUnlike the nucleus, the nucleolus is not a membranebound organelle. Therefore, the targeting of a protein to the nucleolus occurs through the diffusion of the protein through the nucleoplasm and accumulation in the nucleolus. Localization to the nucleolus is mediated by a nucleolar targeting sequence (NoTS), which functions by forming an interaction with a nucleolar component, such as a nucleolar protein, rRNA, or rDNA, or small nucleolar RNAs. By definition, the NoTS by itself cannot translocate a protein across the NPC, but once in the nucleoplasm is capable of targeting the protein to the nucleolus (Lixin et al., 2001) . Another route to the nucleolus is the direct translocation of a protein from the cytoplasm to the nucleolus by cotransport with a nucleolar shuttle protein, such as nucleolin, fribrillarin, and B-23, which normally shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleolus. The purpose of this study was to gain insight into the mechanism of PRRSV N protein localization to the nucleolus by characterizing the individual oligopeptides domains, which participated in the translocation of the N protein across the NPC and localization to the nucleolus.\n\nPrevious work by us described the accumulation of the PRRSV N protein in MARC-145 cells during infection and after expression of recombinant N protein tagged with EGFP (Rowland et al., 1999) . The purpose of this series of experiments was to determine if the translocation of N protein was dependent on a specific NLS domain. Peptide sequence analysis of the N protein of the North American PRRSV isolate SDSU-23983 using the PSORT computer program identified two NLS motifs, a \"pat-4\" NLS, 10-KRKK, and a \"pat-7\" NLS, 41-PGKKNKK (Fig. 1 ). Based on a hydrophilicity plot of the peptide sequence, both NLSs were predicted to be located in regions of the N protein that are highly hydrophilic and accessible for interaction with shuttle proteins. For convenience, the putative NLSs were designated NLS-1 and NLS-2, respectively. Peptide sequences of the N protein from 70 North American isolates deposited in GenBank showed that both NLSs are highly conserved among North American PRRSV isolates. The principal difference between isolates was the conserved substitution of lysines with arginines (data not shown). The European Lelystad virus N protein also contains NLS-1 and NLS-2 domains, which are located at residues 9 and 47, respectively.\n\nThe intracellular properties of the N protein were studied in MARC-145 cells transfected with N protein gene fragments cloned into a pEGFP-N1 expression vector. The nomenclature \"N1\" describes the insertion of the fragment upstream of the EGFP and within the context of the first open reading frame. MARC-145 cells, a monkey kidney cell line, were chosen because they support PRRSV replication to relatively high levels (Kim et al., 1993) . As shown in Fig.  2A and B, the 25-kDa EGFP localized to the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm, which is consistent with passive diffusion. EGFP was excluded from the nucleolus and some cytoplasmic compartments. The fusion of N protein to EGFP altered the distribution of EGFP, resulting in the accumulation of fluorescent label in the nucleolus and decreased accumulation in the nucleoplasm surrounding the nucleoli (Fig. 2C and D). In previous work, colocalization of anti-N protein and nucleolar-specific antibodies were used to identify the nucleolus as the site of N protein accumulation (Rowland et al., 1999) . Nucleoli, when viewed under phase-contrast microscopy, are apparent as highly refractive bodies within the nucleus.\n\nTo determine if NLS-1 and NLS-2 could function as legitimate localization signal sequences, N peptides 1-14 and 39 -48 were tagged with EGFP and expressed in MARC-145 cells. The protein products of NP(1-14)-EGFP and NP(39 -48)-EGFP accumulated in the nucleus and nucleolus, with a small amount of fluorescence remaining in the cytoplasm (see Fig. 2E and F). These data indicated that NLS-1 and NLS-2 could function as NLS domains suffi-cient to localize EGFP to the nucleus, but provided no information on which NLS participated in the translocation of the native N protein to the nucleus. Therefore, the localization properties of NP-EGFP were studied after inactivation of each NLS. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to replace key lysine and arginine residues, the essential residues involved NLS function, with uncharged alanines or glycines. The mutant protein, NP(1-123,G10G11)-EGFP, which lacked an intact NLS-1, localized to the nucleolus (see Fig. 2I ). In a second experiment, NLS-1 was completely removed by deleting the first 14 amino acids from the N-terminus. The protein product, NP(14 -123)-EGFP, also localized to the nucleolus, indicating that NLS-1 was not involved in nuclear translocation.\n\nInactivation of NLS-2 was accomplished by replacing lysine residues at positions 43 and 44 with glycines. Removal of either lysine reduced the accumulation of NP-EGFP in the nucleolus (data not shown), whereas NP(1-123,G43G44)-EGFP, which lacked both lysines, was retained in the cytoplasm and excluded from the nucleus/ nucleolus, as shown in Fig. 2H . A phase-contrast image of the same cell ( Fig. 2G ) confirmed that nucleoli were present. These results suggested that lysines-43 and -44 formed part of the functional NLS peptide domain, which was required for the entry of N protein into the nucleus. Another possibility was that nuclear localization activity was lost in the mutant protein as a result of refolding caused by the lysine substitutions. We took advantage of a panel of six anti-N monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to probe the con- Hopp and Woods (1981) . The inset contains the complete amino acid sequence of the N protein from SDSU-23983, the PRRSV isolate used in this study. Domains that formed NLS motifs were identified using the PSORT computer program (Nakai and Kanehisa, 1992) and labeled NLS-1 and NLS-2. A hydrophobic region, between amino acids 106 and 117, contained a potential nuclear export signal (NES) sequence.\n\nformation of wild-type and mutant N proteins. All mAbs are known to interact with conformation-dependent epitopes distributed throughout the last 90 amino acids of the PRRSV N protein (see Table 1 ; Nelson et al., 1993; Wootton et al., 1998 Wootton et al., , 2001 . The results of the antibody binding studies are summarized in Table 1 . All antibodies reacted with the full-length NP-EGFP fusion protein, indicating that EGFP did not affect mAb recognition and presumably did not alter N protein conformation (Table 1) . There was no immunoreactivity with EGFP alone or EGFP fused to a small N peptide, such as NP(43-72), which contained a small linear segment of the conformational epitope recognized by mAb. All mAbs reacted with the NLS-1 and NLS-2 mutant proteins, NP(14 -123)-EGFP and NP(1-123,G43G44)-EGFP, respectively. Even though four of the six mAbs (MR-40, EP-147, JP-24, VO-17) recognize the same N proteins regions, amino acids 52 to 69 and 112 to 123, these mAb are distinguished from each other based on differences in reactivity with field isolates and mutant recombinant N proteins (personal communication, Eric Nelson, South Dakota State University; Wootton et al., 2001) . Together these data identify NLS-2 as the principal localization signal sequence involved in the translocation of the native N protein into the nucleus.\n\nAdditional site-directed mutagenesis studies were performed within NLS-2 to further delineate key residues in- Table 2 . NP(1-123,G46G47), which lacked lysines 46 and 47, remained in the cytoplasm and retained reactivity with the panel of mAbs. The removal of other amino acid pairs, such as asparagine-45/lysine-46, lysine-47/lysine-48, and lysine-48/asparagine-49, resulted in noticeable reduction in nucleolar localization. The substitution of proline-41 and asparagine-42 with alanines did not affect the amounts of nucleolar fluorescence, but did produce a noticeable increase in the accumulation of NP-EGFP in the nucleoplasm surrounding the nucleoli with what appeared to be a corresponding decrease of fluorescence in the cytoplasm.\n\nResidues located outside of the predicted NLS also affected localization. For example, the substitution of lysine-48 and asparagine-49 with alanines produced a noticeable reduction in nucleolar fluorescence. Together these data identify 43-KKNKK as forming the core localization domain within the 41-PGKKNKK NLS-2 sequence. Furthermore, residues outside of this core sequence can affect N protein localization.\n\nThe 1-14 peptide, which contained the NLS-1 sequence, KKRK, was able to function as an NLS sufficient to accumulate the EGFP tag in the nucleus, but was inactive in the context of the native protein. The lack of localization activity from NLS-1 could reflect the inhibitory activity of adjacent residues, which could block the interaction between the NLS and the receptor domain on the shuttle protein. Another possibility was that the NLS was blocked as a result of the tertiary or quaternary conformation of the N protein. Since mutations in the C-terminal 11 amino acids can significantly alter the conformation of the N protein (Wootton et al., 1998) , we investigated the possibility that mutations in the C-terminus, sufficient to affect recognition by mAb, would reveal nuclear localization activity from NLS-1. The experimental approach was to follow the intracellular localization of the NLS-2 mutant, NP(1-115,G43G44), which contained an eight-amino-acid dele- Wootton et al. (1998) and are identified by beginning and ending amino acid. c ND, not determined. 1-123, G43) . . G . . . . . . . \u03e9\u03e9\u03e9 \u03ea \u03e9\u03e9 NP (1-123, G44) . . .

The result, presented in Fig. 3B , showed that NP(1-115,G43G44)-EGFP localized to the nucleolus, whereas the parent mutant protein NP(1-123,G43,G44)-EGFP remained cytoplasmic. To confirm that localization of NP(1-115,G43G44) was NLS-1 dependent, we followed the localization of a NLS double mutant, NP(14 -115,G43G44)-EGFP. As shown in Fig. 3C , the pro-tein product was retained in the cytoplasm, demonstrating the loss of NLS activity after removal of NLS-1. Removal of eight amino acids from the N protein resulted in the loss of immunoreactivity with SR-30 and VO-17 mAbs (Table  1) , but did not alter recognition by SDOW-17, MR-30, or JP-24. The ability of a mutation in the C-terminus of the N protein to recover activity from NLS-1, which is located at the opposite end of the protein, demonstrates that the overall conformation of the native N protein is responsible for blocking NLS-1 activity. Furthermore, since the deletion of amino acids did not affect binding by three of the six mAbs, only a small conformational change is necessary to expose NLS-1.\n\nTo further support the notion that N protein nuclear transport is NLS-mediated, we investigated the ability of N to interact with importin-\u2423 and -\u2424 proteins in a GST-bead binding assay. Immunoprecipitation of radiolabled proteins from infected cell lysates or in vitro translated products using N-specific antibodies yielded a protein, which migrated at approximately 15 kDa (Fig. 4A, lane 1, Fig. 4B , lane 3). Immunoprecipitation of in vitro translated N protein, derived from the pCITE vector, yielded a slightly slower migrating product (Fig. 4B, lane 3) . The slower migration was consistent with the addition of amino acid residues contributed by the pCITE vector. Since the PRRSV N protein typically forms noncovalent homodimers (Wootton and Yoo, 2003), GST-N was able to precipitate radiolabeled N from cell lysates from infected but not mockinfected cells (Fig, 4B, lanes 4 and 5) . As a negative control, Sepharose GST alone failed to pull down proteins corresponding to the size of native (Fig. 4B lanes 1 and 2) or in vitro translated N proteins (data not shown). N proteins from PRRSV-infected cells or from in vitro translation were Fig. 3 . Recovery of NLS-1 activity in N proteins that contain a truncation of eight amino acids from the C-terminus. Mutant N proteins were expressed as EGFP fusion proteins. The composition of each construct is illustrated to the right of the photomicrographs. Arrows point to the nucleus in each cell. N (B, lanes 4 and 5) . N protein products derived from in vitro translation were slightly larger due to the incorporation of a His-Tag and additional amino acids incorporated from multiple cloning site of the pCITE vector. able to form an interaction with GST-importin-\u2423 and GSTimportin-\u2424 (see Fig. 4A ). No bands of the correct molecular size were observed when radiolabeled proteins from mockinfected cells or translation products from pCITE vector RNA were incubated with GST-importin proteins. These data show that nuclear shuttle proteins have the capacity to form specific interactions with the PRRSV N protein. Furthermore, the capacity of importin-\u2423 and importin-\u2424 to bind in vitro translated N protein indicates that N-importin interactions are independent of other viral proteins.\n\nProteins that localize to the nucleolus typically possess a nucleolar localization signal (NoLS) motif. The NoLS associated with viral proteins is usually no longer than 20 amino acid residues and possesses at least nine basic resi-dues overall, including one continuous stretch of four basic amino acids, or two stretches of three basic amino acids. Furthermore, an NLS is usually embedded within the NoLS peptide sequence (Kubota et al., 1999) . Peptide sequence analysis of the regions surrounding NLS-1 and NLS-2 showed no identity with this type of NoLS motif (see Fig.  1 ). Therefore, to locate the smallest peptide sufficient to function as an NoLS, amino acids we followed the localization of NP-EGFP fusion proteins after sequentially removal of amino acid residues from the N-and C-terminal ends. A summary of the results, presented in Fig. 5 , showed that the N protein construct lacking the first 40 amino acids (NP(41-123)) or last 51 amino acids (NP(1-72)) produced a nucleolar-cytoplasmic distribution pattern similar to the full-length N protein, with a small amount of fluorescence in the nucleoplasmic region surrounding the nucleoli. Removal of a single amino acid from either construct, NP(42- 123) or NP(1-71), produced a change in the distribution of EGFP fluorescence, which was most noticeable as an increase in the accumulation of the fusion protein in the nucleoplasm surrounding the nucleoli combined with a corresponding decrease of fluorescent protein in the cytoplasm ( Fig. 5D and E) . The 41-72 peptide, when fused to EGFP, localized to the cytoplasm and the nucleolus (Fig. 5G ) demonstrating that the 41-72 oligopeptide alone can produce a localization pattern similar to the full-length wildtype N protein, supporting the possibility that this domain contains the NoLS sequence.\n\nIn previous work, we characterized the nucleolar localization of the PRRSV N protein during infection of MARC-145 cells with North American and European PRRSV isolates and following transfection of cells with an N protein-EGFP fusion gene (Rowland et al., 1999) . The results of this current study extend these observations by identifying peptide domains, which participate in N protein translocation across the NPC and accumulation in the nucleolus.\n\nPeptide sequence analysis of the PRRSV N protein revealed two putative NLSs, which were predicted to be located in regions with high accessibility (Fig. 1) . However, only one NLS, NLS-2, was found to be involved in nuclear transport of the native protein. Further analysis of NLS-2 revealed a sequence, 43-KKNKK, which formed the core of the NLS (Table 2 ). The removal of lysine residue pairs 43-KK or 46-KK abolished nuclear transport, but did not affect recognition by a panel of conformation-dependent anti-N mAbs. Therefore, in the context of the native N protein, NLS-2 is necessary and sufficient to transport the N protein into the nucleus.\n\nThe inactivation or complete removal of NLS-1 had no effect on N protein nuclear translocation, since mAbs prepared against the whole N protein molecule generally fail to recognize the region covered by the first 30 amino acids, even though this region possesses several charged residues (Wootton et al., 1998) . Therefore, the absence of immunoreactivity suggests that the N-terminal region, including NLS-1, is normally hidden from the surface of the protein. NLS-1 nuclear localization activity was recovered following the removal of eight amino acids from the C-terminus. The loss of SR-30 and VO-17 reactivity indicated a change in the conformation of the N protein, sufficient to expose NLS-1. Another possibility is that NLS-1 is normally blocked as a result of oligomerization with other N protein molecules. Oligomerization with other N protein molecules may block NLS-1 without affecting the accessibility of NLS-2. In the context of the native protein, NLS-1 can be considered a cryptic NLS.\n\nNLS-dependent nuclear transport is initiated by the interaction between the NLS on the cargo protein with importin-\u2423 (Gorlich and Mattaj, 1996) . A separate importin-\u2424-binding (IBB) domain on the N-terminus of the importin-\u2423 is responsible for forming the interaction between the importin-\u2423/cargo complex and importin-\u2424 (Moroianu et al., 1996) . Importin-\u2424 does not contain an NLS binding site; however, the NLS on viral proteins, such as HIV Rev, can bind directly to importin-\u2424 (Henderson and Percipalle, 1997) . Using a pull-down assay, we demonstrated that the N protein of PRRSV is able to form interactions with murine GST-importin-\u2423 and -\u2424 proteins (Fig.  4) . Furthermore, the formation of an N protein/importin complex using in vitro translated N demonstrates that N protein binding is independent of other viral proteins. Even though these results demonstrate the capacity of N to form stable interactions with importin, these data do not exclude the possibility for the participation of other shuttle proteins in the translocation of N into the nucleus/nucleolus. For example, major nucleolar proteins, such as nucleolin and B-23, can function in the transport of viral proteins from the cytoplasm to the nucleolus through the interaction between long stretches of acidic residues in B-23 and nucleolin with highly basic NoLS domains. B-23 can form stable interactions with Tat, Rev, Rex, and adenovirus V proteins (Frankhauser et al., 1991; Stauber and Pavlakis, 1998; Adachi et al., 1993; Matthews, 2001) . Hiscox et al. (2001) , after comparing the peptide sequences of infectious bronchitis virus and PRRSV N proteins, concluded that the PRRSV NoLS was located between amino acids 37 and 52 (Table  3) . However, our results present a modified picture in which an overlapping peptide covering amino acids 41-72 was capable of reproducing the nucleolar-cytoplasmic localization pattern of the wild-type N protein (Fig. 5) . Even though the 41-72 domain contains an NLS, which is consistent with other viral NoLS sequences, there are some notable differences. The overall length is longer than the 20 amino acids for the typical viral NoLS sequences (Table 3 ) (Kubota et al., 1999) . The second difference is a paucity of basic residues (eight lysines/arginines) and the incorporation of five negatively charged amino residues, making the 41-72 domain relatively more acidic when compared with other viral NoLS domains. At this time we propose that the 41-72 peptide contains an NLS, represented by the core peptide KKNKK, and a separate nucleolar localization domain, which targets N to the nucleolus. The EAV N protein contains a potential nuclear export signal (NES) sequence located at residue 54, which may participate in the translocation of N from the nucleus and into the cytoplasm (Tijms et al., 2002) . The classical NES motif, found in HIV Rev and cellular proteins, is X-R (2-4) -X-R 2 -X-R-X, where X represents a hydrophobic amino acid, such as leucine, isoleucine, or valine, and the letter R represents any amino acid (Fischer et al., 1995; Hope, 1999; Henderson and Eleftheriou, 2000) . Almost all classical NES sequences contain the X-R-X tripeptide core sequence. The HIV Rev protein NES is LGLPPLERLTL (the hydrophobic residues are underlined). The PRRSV N protein contains two regions, sufficiently enriched in hydrophobic amino acids, to function as potential NES sequences. The first, located between amino acids 19 and 30, does not contain an X-R-X sequence. The second peptide, 106-LPTHHTVR-LIRV, contains at least one core tripeptide sequence (in bold and see Fig. 1 ). A nearly identical peptide sequence is found in the N protein of the Lelystad virus. It remains to be determined if the PRRSV protein is exported from the nucleus by way of a classical NES.\n\nThe function of N in the nucleolus is not known. Chen et al. (2002) showed that a coronavirus N protein was able to bind nucleolin, which was associated with the inhibition of cytokinesis, a possible viral strategy to divert biosynthetic resources from the dividing nucleus and into the cytoplasm. Nucleolar N could also have a neutral effect on cell function, i.e., a simple case of molecular mimicry. For instance, peptide regions enriched in basic amino acids, required to bind viral RNA, can mimic NLS and/or NoLS sequences (LaCasse and Lefebvre, 1995) . One intriguing possibility is that localization of N protein to the nucleus/nucleolus represents a novel host cell protection strategy. The sequestration of large quantities of nucleocapsid precursor in the nucleolus would deprive a cytoplasmic virus of an essential structural protein. The incorporation of an export signal in the N protein would represent a counterstrategy, which would ensure that a sufficient quantity of N protein was returned to the cytoplasm where it could participate in the assembly of virions.\n\nRestriction sites were added to the 5\u0408 end of the respective sense and antisense PCR primers used to amplify the desired regions of the N gene. PCR products were doubledigested with the appropriate restriction enzymes and ligated into pEGFP-N1 (Clontech Inc.). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by overlapping extension PCR (Ho et al., 1989; Jespersen et al., 1997) . Briefly, two fragments of N gene were amplified separately using overlapping primers that contained the desired mutation. Equal amounts of each PCR product were added to the reaction and the overlap extension was carried out for five cycles at 95\u00b0C for 30 s, 58\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min.\n\nTransfection of DNA into MARC-145 cells, a PRRSVpermissive cell line (Kim et al., 1993) , was performed using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions. Approximately 24 h prior to transfection, 2 \u03eb 10 5 cells/well were seeded into a 6-well plate. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were viewed under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus) equipped with a standard FITC excitation filter. In some experiments, cells were trypsinized, placed on 10-well slides, and incubated in a humidified chamber. After further incubation to allow cells to reattach, slides were fixed in acetone for 10 min.\n\nCells on glass slides were fixed in acetone, air dried, and then stained with anti-N protein monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) SDOW-17, SR-30, JP-24, EP-147, VO-17, or MR-39 (a generous gift of Eric Nelson, South Dakota State University, Brookings, SD). All antibodies were diluted 1:100 in PBS with 5% FBS and incubated on slides for 2 h at room temperature. Mouse antibodies were detected with biotinylated anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) diluted 1:200 and incubated on slides for 1 h at room temperature, followed by a 20-min incubation with a 1:1,000 dilution of streptavidin-Texas Red (Molecular Probes). EGFP and Texas Red were visualized in the same cell under a fluorescence microscope using 488-nm (FITC) and 540-nm (rhodamine) excitation filters, respectively.\n\nPlasmids mImp-\u2423 (PTAC58) and mImp-\u2424 (PTAC97), used to express the mouse importin-\u2423 and importin-\u2424 glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins, respectively, were a generous gift from Dr. David Jans (John Curtin School of Medical Research, Canberra City, Australia). GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (Novagen) as described in Wootton et al. (1998) . One hundred milliliters of log phase bacterial culture was induced with 1 mM IPTG, and after 3 h bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 5 ml of PBS, and sonicated on ice three times for 30 s. Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1%, and proteins were disassociated for 30 min at 4\u00b0C with constant agitation. The insoluble fraction was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant, containing the GST fusion proteins, was incubated with 100 l of a 50% slurry of glutathione Sepharose 4B beads (Pharmacia) overnight at 4\u00b0C. Beads complexed to the GST fusion proteins were collected at 500g and washed three times in PBS and resuspended in a final volume of 250 l of PBS containing 30% glycerol and 0.1% Triton X-100. To produce radiolabeled recombinant N protein, the N gene was cloned into pCITE and transcribed in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase MEGAscript (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting RNA was translated using the rabbit reticulocyte lysate translation kit (Promega) in the presence of 50 Ci/ml of [ 35 S]methionine (New England Nuclear, specific activity 3000 Ci/mmol). To produce the radiolabeled authentic viral N protein, PRRSVinfected MARC-145 cells were labeled at 30 h post-infection with 50 Ci/ml of [ 35 S]methionine for 8 h. Cells were washed and lysed using RIPA buffer (TNE with 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% SDS).\n\nApproximately equal amounts GST fusion proteins complexed to glutathione-Sepharose beads in a 20% slurry were incubated with radiolabeled N protein in incubation buffer (final concentration: 40 mM Hepes [pH 7.5], 100 mM KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 20 mM \u2424-mercaptoethanol) for 2 h or overnight at 4\u00b0C with constant agitation. The beads were rinsed four times with incubation buffer, boiled for 5 min in reducing Laemmli sample buffer, and analyzed by electrophoresis on 15% bis-polyacrylamide gel containing SDS. Gels were dried and exposed to Phosphorimager (Molecular Dynamics)."}
