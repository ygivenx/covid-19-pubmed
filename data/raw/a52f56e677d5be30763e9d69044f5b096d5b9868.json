{"title": "PURIFICATION STRATEGIES FOR SENDAI VIRUS MEMBRANE PRO- TEINS", "body": "When membrane proteins are purified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), they generally behave differently from the hydrophilic reference proteins used to investigate the performance of the many currently available HPLC-sorbents. Many proteins are much more hydrophobic than the reference proteins and, as a consequence, show a tendency to aggregate. Because of this, they are often difficult to purify. The strategy for purifying such a protein strongly depends on its properties and its ultimate application. We have used Sendai virus proteins as model compounds for the development of HPLC methods for the purification of hydrophobic membrane proteins. Size-exclusion, ion-exchange and reversed-phase HPLC were used to purify these proteins1s2.\n\nSendai virus is a paramyxovirus of mice and belongs to the same genus as the human para-influenza viruses. The Sendai virus envelope is composed of a lipid bi- layer in which two integral membrane proteins are embedded, the hemagglutininneuraminidase (HN, M, = 68 000) and the fusion protein (F, M, = 65 000). These proteins are present as spikes on the outside of the virus particle, extending into the solvent. The HN protein is found in the monomeric, a dimeric and a tetrameric form, while the F protein consists of two components Fi (M, = 50000) and F2 (Mr = 13 000-15 000) which are connected by one disulfide bridge. Recently, the base sequences of the Sendai virus proteins were determined3+; the molecular weights based on the amino acid sequences, are 61495 and 63 408 for F and HN, respectively. However, these figures do not include carbohydrate groups and, therefore, we will use the earlier mentioned higher molecular weights, which are based on data from sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE).\n\nIn the present study, we investigated the suitability of various HPLC methods for the purification of hydrophobic membrane proteins. This study included repeated size-exclusion HPLC, reversed-phase HPLC with a large-pore (100 nm) packing material and metal chelate affinity and ion-exchange HPLC in the presence of the non-UV absorbing detergent decylpolyethyleneglycol-300 (decyl-PEG).\n\nSendai virus was grown in lo-day-old embryonated chicken eggs. Allantoic fluid was collected after 48 h of virus growth at 36\u00b0C. Debris was pelleted at 2000 g for 20 min and vii-ions were pelleted at 22 000 rpm (70 000 g) for 30 min. The vii-ions were suspended in 5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) and extracted with decyl-PEG-300 4/5 (Janssen Chimica, Beerse, Belgium or Kwant-Hoog Vacolie Recycling and Synthese, Bedum, The Netherlands) or Triton X-100 (BDH, Poole, U.K.) at a final concentration of 2% (w/w) for 20 min at room temperature. The detergent to viral protein ratio was 2 (w/w). After centrifugation for 90 min at 100000 g, the extracted viral proteins HN and F were present in the supernatant, which was stored in 200 ~1 portions at -80\u00b0C.\n\nChromatography was performed with a system consisting of a Waters M 6000A pump (Waters, Etten-Leur, The Netherlands) or a LKB 2150 pump (LKB, Zoetermeer, The Netherlands), a Rheodyne 7125 injector (Inacom, Veenendaal, The Netherlands), and a Waters 441 detector or a Pye Unicam LC-UV detector (Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands). Gradients were generated by a low-pressure mixing system, existing of an Acorn computer (Acorn, Cambridge, U.K.), interfaced with a three-way solenoid valve (Lee, Westbrook, CT, U.S.A.)6.\n\nSize-exclusion HPLC was performed on a TSK 4000SW column (600 x 7.5 mm I.D.) (Toyo Soda, Tokyo, Japan) by elution with 0.1% SDS in 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.5). Samples (200 ~1 detergent extract) were subjected to chromatography without any pretreatment. The flow-rate was 1 ml/min and the absorbance was monitored at 280 nm.\n\nAnion-exchange HPLC was carried out on a Mono Q HR 515 (50 x 5 mm I.D.) column (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden), which was eluted with a 24-min gradient from 0 to 0.5 M sodium chloride in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), containing 0.1% (w/w) decyl-PEG. The flow-rate was 1 ml/min and the absorbance was monitored at 280 nm.\n\nMetal chelate affinity HPLC was carried out on a TSK Chelate-SPW (75 x 7.5 mm I.D.) column (Toyo Soda). Two different gradient programs were used for elution. The first program was essentially as described by Kato et al. ' , except that we added 0.1% (w/w) decyl-PEG to the buffers. Briefly: the column was washed with 10 ml 0.05 M EDTA in 0.5 M sodium chloride and then equilibrated with 5 ml of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), containing 0.5 M sodium chloride and 0.1% decyl-PEG (buffer A). Then the column was loaded with 5 ml of 0.2 M zinc chloride and equilibrated again with 15 ml of buffer A. The column was eluted with a 30 min-gradient from 0 to 0.1 it4 glycine in buffer A at a flow-rate of 0.5 ml/min. In the second program, both buffers contained 0.2 M sodium acetate (pH 7.0) and 0.1% (w/w) decyl-PEG. In addition, buffer A contained 0.5 M sodium chloride, and buffer B contained 0.5 M ammonium chloride. The column was equilibrated with buffer A, and subsequently loaded with 5 ml of 0.2 M zinc chloride in buffer A and 10 ml of buffer B. Before application of the sample, the column was re-equilibrated with buffer A and eluted with a 30-min gradient from buffer A to buffer B at a flow-rate of 0.5 ml/min. The absorbance was monitored at 280 nm.\n\nReversed-phase HPLC was performed by eluting detergent extracts from a Phenyl SPW-RP column (50 x 4.6 mm I.D., Toyo Soda) with a 24-min gradient from 15 to 75% acetonitrile in water containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. The flow-rate was 1 ml/min, and the absorbance was monitored at 214 nm. In some cases, the extracts were reduced by incubation at 37\u00b0C for 20 min in 20 mM dithiotreitol (DTT).\n\nFractions were collected in 11 x 70 mm minisorp-tubes (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark). After reversed-phase HPLC, the organic solvent was removed by evaporation in a SpeedVac centrifuge (Savant Instruments, Hicksville, NY, U.S.A.) and the remaining aqueous solution was freeze-dried. Fractions obtained after size-exclusion, anion-exchange, and metal chelate HPLC were dialyzed against water by covering the minisorp-tubes with a square piece of dialysis tubing and closing them by fitting a slice of silicone tubing (1.5 cm diameter) over the dialysis membrane. After dialysis, the fractions were freeze-dried in the tubes.\n\nThe eluate fractions were analyzed on 8, 10, or 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels!. Polypeptide bands were visualized by silver-stainingg.\n\nWhen a Triton X-100 extract of Sendai virus is boiled and reduced prior to chromatography in 0.1% SDS, the HN and Fr proteins cannot be separated (Fig.  1 , + red). Without reduction, the di and tetrameric forms of HN remain intact, and separation is obtained between F and these forms of HN (Fig. 1, -red and ref. 1 ). In the present study, the detergent extract was subjected to size-exclusion HPLC without any pretreatment. The elution pattern is shown in Fig. 2A HN are mainly present in fractions 3-5 and l-3, respectively. Fraction 1, containing tetrameric HN and F, was dialyzed against water, freeze-dried and again subjected to size-exclusion HPLC on TSK 4000SW under the same conditions. The elution pattern and the SDS-PAGE analysis in Fig. 2B show that an excellent separation of the tetramer HN from the F protein is ach.ieved.\n\nAnion-Exchange HPLC was carried out as described earlier', except that 0.1% of the non-W absorbing detergent decyl-PEG was used instead of Triton X-100. The separation was as before': HN was eluted first in several sharp peaks, followed by a broad peak containing the F protein.\n\nTwo different gradient programs were used: In the first program, a glycine gradient was used to elute the proteins, and in the second a gradient from sodium chloride to ammonium chloride. In both programs, 0.1 %\\ decyl-PEG was present in the buffers. Both programs gave essentially the same results. An example obtained with the second program is shown in Fig. 3 . The F protein was hardly retarded and was eluted in several peaks. The HN protein was retarded and was eluted in peaks 4 and 5.\n\nA non-reduced Sendai virus extract was applied to a 100 nm reversed-phase Fig. 2A was dialyzed against water, freeze-dried, and subjected to sire-exclusion HPLC under the same elution conditions as above. The molecular weight of reference proteins is indicated in kilodaltons. l = Triton X-100.\n\ncolumn without removal of the decyl-PEG. Two relatively broad peaks were obtained, both of which contained the tetramer and the dimer of HN and the F protein (see Fig. 4 ). In addition, the same procedure was applied to a reduced Sendai virus extract. Results were similar to those described earlier2. The Sendai virus membrane I  I  I  I  6 12 mln proteins were eluted in the following order: Fz, HN, and then Fr. The detergent did not interfere with the elution.\n\nYields for most proteins varied from 50-90% independent of the HPLC method. Quantitative recoveries were obtained after reversed-phase HPLC of the Fz protein.\n\nThe non-ionic detergent decyl-PEG, which contains an average of 7 oxyethylene units, was shown to be more efficient than Triton X-100 in extracting the HN and F proteins from purified Sendai vu-ions. More than twice as much protein was extracted from the lipid bilayer 2. Decyl-PEG also has the convenient property that it is transparent at 280 nm, and, therefore, we have used it as an additive in the gradient programs for ion-exchange and metal chelate affinity HPLC. Moreover, Flow-rate, 1 ml/mm; UV detection at 214 mn. Fractions (l-7) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 8% gels.\n\ndecyl-PEG does not interfere with detection at 214 nm in reversed-phase HPLC, and, as a consequence, it was not necessary to remove the detergent prior to chromatography.\n\nSize-exclusion HPLC of a boiled Sendai virus extract yields relatively pure proteins because of the large difference in molecular weight between the tetramer and the dimer of HN and the F protein (272, 136 and 65 kilodaltons, respectively). Nevertheless, the F peak still contains the HN dimer. In an earlier paperlo, we used decyl-PEG in the elution buffer for size-exclusion HPLC. This resulted in a number of broad peaks, all of which contained the F protein. It was concluded that micelles of different size were separated. In the presence of SDS, a similar phenomenon is observed when the protein sample is not boiled prior to chromatography. The F protein is eluted in multimeric forms from the size-exclusion column. Dialysis against water is sufficient to break up the large micelles, which, in addition to the F protein, contain the HN multimers. These effects were utilized to achieve the separation shown in Fig. 2B , which yielded a pure preparation of F protein and the tetramer of HN.\n\nIn the elution buffers for ion-exchange HPLC we have used Triton X-100'. which has the disadvantage that it strongly absorbs at 280 nm. In another study\" we also used Brij 35, which does not absorb at 280 nm. This resulted in a similar separation, but tailing of peaks was observed. The addition of 0.1% decyl-PEG did not give rise to these problems and it does not interfere with protein detection at 280 nm.\n\nMetal chelate affinity chromatography was introduced by Porath et al.' 2 Separation is based on differences in affinity of the column matrix, which contains iminodiacetic acid with a metal ion, for particular amino acid side chains in a protein.\n\nThe most important amino acids in this respect are His, Trp, and Cys12,13. However. these particular amino acids in a protein will not always have access to the column ligand. Lee and Richards14 studied the side chain accessibility in RNase S, lysozyrne and myoglobin. Of the three amino acids, His, Trp, and Cys, His and Trp are often accessible, while Cys is only occasionally accessible. Cys is often located in the interior part of proteins as part of a disulfide bridge. The Sendai virus HN protein contains almost twice as much His and Trp as the F protein, which may explain why the HN protein was retained longer than the F protein. The proteins were eluted in more than one peak (See Fig. 3) . As mentioned before, mild chromatographic conditions may result in the Sendai virus proteins being contained in different micelles.\n\nThe addition of divalent cations (e.g. Fe'+, Ca2+, Co'+) to non-ionic detergents may result in precipitation l 5. Zinc chloride in combination with decyl-PEG did not cause precipitation, in contrast to Cu2+. Therefore Zn2+, could be used in the elution buffer.\n\nRecently, we found that a reversed-phase packing material with large pores (100 nm) was particularly suitable for the purification of a reduced Sendai virus extract2J6. The detergent extract contained the 13-15 kilodaltons F2 protein, the 50 kilodaltons Fr protein and the monomer of the HN protein (68 kilodaltons). When the extract was not reduced, it contained proteins with much higher molecular weights (up to 272 kilodaltons). In the present study, the unreduced extract was chromatographed on the RPLC column. The results (Fig. 4) show that the large proteins could be eluted but no separation between the tetramer and the dimer of HN and the F protein was obtained. The broad peaks may be caused by repeated precipitation and dissolution of these large membrane proteins. In view ofthese results, the strategy for the purification of a particular membrane protein will primarily depend on its ultimate use. When the structural integrity of the protein is of less importance, ix, in amino acid sequence studies, all modes of HPLC can be used, either alone or in combination. When the structure of the protein must remain intact for further studies, buffer systems of physiological pH, in which a mild detergent is included, are recommended. Secondary factors which may play a role, especially in reversed-phase HPLC of membrane proteins, are the overall hydrophobicity and the size of the protein. Membrane proteins are generally more hydrophobic than an average protein (see Table I ). An average membrane protein contains 30% large hydrophobic amino acids and the average percentage of such amino acids in 314 families of proteinsz9 is 20.2%. As a consequence, a membrane protein will have more sites available for interaction with hydrophobic column ligands, and relatively high concentrations of organic solvent will be needed for elution. A similar effect is caused by the size of the protein. A larger protein will have more interaction sites with a column matrix than a small protein. This is reflected in the results obtained with reversed-phase HPLC of Sendai virus proteins. The smallest protein, Fz (13-15 kilodaltons), can be purified and is recovered quantitatively, whereas the other proteins, F1, HN, F, and the dimer and tetramer of HN, can only be purified partially2 or not at all by reversed-phase HPLC.\n\nIn conclusion, the results of this study indicate that the integral membrane proteins of Sendai virus, the hydrophobicity of which is similar to that of an average membrane protein, and which cover a broad molecular weight range (from 13 to 272 kilodaltons), can be used as reference membrane proteins to evaluate chromatographic purification methods."}
