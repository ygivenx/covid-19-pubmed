{"title": "\"The Duty to Prevent\" during an epidemic situation like 2015 Korean MERS outbreak", "body": "ciples: consent, implied consent, special training, reciprocity, and oaths and codes. This duty can be interpreted as the responsibility of preventive medicine specialists, as doctors accredited by the country, to play the professional role expected of them by local communities in critical situations [2] . And epidemic surveillance is the first task of preventive medicine specialists in their role of disease management [7] .\n\nEthical obligations based on ethical principles should be differentiated from ethical virtues [2, 8] . While obligations specify roles and responsibilities, virtues are the character traits underlying personal attitude and behavior in fulfilling a just cause [2, 8] . The major character traits required of epidemiologists are benevolence, honesty, prudence, excellence, and integrity [2] . Especially, solidarity and loyalty are additional character traits that are utmost important, as they ensure the trust of the local community [8] .\n\nHowever, these character traits cannot be acquired by education, and should be cultivated by individuals [9] . In this regard, specialist training programs should be help residents more efficiently carry out their \"duty to prevent\". Additionally, the proper methods for wearing and removing protective coveralls should be taught without fail during training so that specialists can protect themselves from infection. Along with these efforts, the most desirable attitude for bridging the ethical gap during a pandemic is the voluntary participation of the specialists [10] .\n\nThe author has no conflicts of interest to declare for this study.\n\nSupplementary material (Korean version) is available at http: //www.e-epih.org/."}
