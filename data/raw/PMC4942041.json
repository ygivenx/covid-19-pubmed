{"title": "Transmission parameters of the A/H1N1 (2009) influenza virus pandemic: a review", "body": "In April 2009, a new influenza virus A/H1N1 (2009) was isolated in Mexico and has rapidly spread over the world, being reported in 214 countries 1 year after its first identification.\n1\n The spread of the virus was extremely fast worldwide.\n2\n As soon as the new virus was identified, a major issue was to estimate the transmissibility of the new virus. In the guidance document \u2018Global surveillance during an influenza pandemic\u2019 released by the World Health Organization, three parameters were highlighted that should be documented quickly in this respect: the incubation period (time between infection and symptoms), the serial interval (time between symptoms onset in primary case and secondary case), and the reproduction ratio/number (average number of secondary cases per primary case).\n3\n These parameters are instrumental to assessing the feasibility and efficacy of intervention strategies against pandemic influenza.\n4\n\n\n\nInformation regarding the serial interval and the reproduction number from past pandemics has been limited. For the serial interval, the best information concerned seasonal influenza infections\n5\n, \n6\n and no information was available regarding past pandemics. There was comparatively more information regarding reproduction numbers, with estimates obtained in the last four pandemics (1889, 1918, 1957, 1968).\n7\n, \n8\n, \n9\n, \n10\n, \n11\n, \n12\n Estimates have ranged between 1 and 6 depending not only on place, time, wave, but also on the methods and assumptions used in estimation.\n\nAs we have now entered the post\u2010pandemic period for H1N1(2009),\n13\n it is timely to review the results of all studies regarding the serial interval or generation time for the A/H1N1 flu, as well as the reproduction numbers, to allow comparison with previous pandemics and help in planning. Here, we present the results of a systematic review of published estimates concerning the first wave of A/H1N1 (2009) concerning the serial interval and the reproduction number.\n\nThe generation time (GT) is the time interval between the date of infection in one case and that in its infector.\n14\n It is difficult to measure in practice, as the actual time of infection is not observed. The serial interval (SI), i.e., the time interval between the date of symptoms onset in one case and that in its infector, is therefore often considered instead of the GT because it has the same mean.\n14\n The GT or SI informs on the speed of transmission of the disease. It is not an intrinsic property of the disease, but a combination of biology (how much and when is a person infectious) and behavior (how many and when contacts leading to infection occur).\n15\n\n\n\nA random sample of pairs of secondary case and their infector would allow unbiased estimation of the SI but is seldom available. In practice, various designs are used to observe pairs of infectee/infector, and this may impact the observed distribution.\n16\n For example, cases may be observed in households, where common exposure may have led to coprimary cases and ongoing transmission to an overlap of secondary and tertiary cases. Statistical modeling is therefore required to recover the true SI distribution.\n\nThe reproduction number (or reproduction ratio), denoted R, is defined as the average number of secondary cases caused by one index case.\n17\n A reproduction number may be calculated at any time during an outbreak, a value larger than 1 corresponding to epidemic spread of the disease. In practice, additional qualifiers are often used when reporting a reproduction number: \u2018initial\u2019 in the beginning of an epidemic; \u2018basic\u2019 when the whole population is initially susceptible to the disease \u2013R is in this case denoted R\n0; \u2018effective\u2019 when the natural course of the outbreak is altered, for example, by interventions. Several methods are available to estimate reproduction numbers: using attack rates,\n18\n the exponential growth rate,\n19\n averaging over transmission chains.\n20\n An assumption regarding the GT distribution may be required to estimate the reproduction number; in this case, a shorter mean GT will likely lead to a smaller reproduction number estimate.\n\nWe systematically searched MEDLINE, Eurosurveillance (http://www.eurosurveillance.org), and Plos Currents Influenza (http://currents.plos.org/influenza) for published articles reporting estimates of the generation time/serial interval and reproduction numbers during the first wave of the A/H1N1 2009 flu pandemic. We used the following queries:\n\n\nQ1\u2013 (influenza OR flu) AND (H1N1 OR pandemic OR A/H1N1) AND (reproduction OR reproductive) AND (ratio OR rate OR number)Q2\u2013 (influenza OR flu) AND (H1N1 OR pandemic OR A/H1N1) AND [\u2018serial interval\u2019 OR \u2018generation time\u2019 OR \u2018generation interval\u2019 OR (\u2018onset\u2019 AND \u2018time\u2019)]\n\n\nThe search was performed on July 28, 2010, and was limited to publications in English after April 2009.\n\nQuery Q1 reported 101 hits in MEDLINE, and query Q2 reported 75 hits in MEDLINE. All publications were reviewed for relevance, and we finally retained 36 papers presenting original estimates of reproduction numbers, the serial interval, or the generation time.\n\nFor all studies, we abstracted the date of publication, the place and date where the data were collected, the estimate of the reproduction number and of the mean SI or GT and its confidence interval when reported; we summarized how the data were collected and the method for analysis. We focused on reproduction number estimates described as \u2018basic\u2019 or \u2018initial\u2019. In studies where the reproduction number was estimated as a function of time, we reported the range of R(t) values.\n\nSeventeen independent estimates of the mean SI or GT during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic were reported in sixteen studies. Details are reported in Table 1 and Figure 1. The data were collected early in the pandemic, between April and August 2009.\n\nIn a first group of 13 studies, estimation was based on the analysis of observed time intervals between cases and their close contacts, especially in households. Cases and their households or contacts were included as part of the local health authorities response to the pandemic, except in one study where households had been included in a prospective clinical trial.\n21\n Whether the data were prospective or retrospective was not reported except in two retrospective cases.\n22\n, \n23\n\n\n\nHousehold contacts only were used in eight studies,\n21\n, \n23\n, \n24\n, \n25\n, \n26\n, \n27\n, \n28\n, \n29\n yielding mean SIs in the range of 2\u00b76\u20134\u00b74 days. In all but one study, the index case was the first case in the household. Household observed serial intervals were defined as the difference in date of symptoms onset between incident cases and the index case. In the study where the index case could be different from the first, all cases after the index were considered as secondary cases of the index case.\n27\n The other five studies included contacts not limited to the household,\n22\n, \n30\n, \n31\n, \n32\n, \n33\n with mean SIs in the range of 2\u00b75\u20133\u00b75 days. Here, pairs of infector/infectee were identified where the infector was the only, or most probable, source of infection.\n\nThe largest estimate (4\u00b74 days; range = [1,9]) was obtained from only five serial intervals observed in three households.\n29\n One estimate (2\u00b76 days, range = [1,3]) was based on eight observed household SI; however, only the first non\u2010index\u2010case in the household was used.\n28\n In four instances, only the median SI was reported,\n22\n, \n23\n, \n26\n, \n30\n and we computed the empirical mean of observed SI when the data were detailed enough: the mean SI was 3\u00b75 days (CI 95% [2\u00b79, 4\u00b71])\n26\n and 3 days (95% CI [2\u00b75\u20133\u00b75]),\n23\n very similar to the reported medians. In these calculations, coprimary cases (same day as index case) and those occurring more than 7 days after the index case were excluded.\n\nIn all but two cases, the mean SI was calculated as the empirical mean of observed intervals, excluding the possibility of tertiary transmission. More sophisticated modeling allowing for several generations of transmission was carried out in the two other cases. In the first case, a household\u2010based study, the empirical mean SI (excluding coprimary cases and cases >7 days after) was 2\u00b79 days (95% CI [2\u00b77, 3\u00b71]).\n24\n After modeling, the reported mean SI decreased to 2\u00b76 days (95% CI [2\u00b72, 3\u00b75]). In the second case, derived from the FF100 cohort in the UK, the empirical mean SI of observed serial intervals was 3\u00b74 days (95% CI [2\u00b79, 3\u00b79]) and the reported mean SI decreased to 2\u00b75 days (95% CI [2\u00b71, 2\u00b79]) after modeling.\n31\n\n\n\nAn overall estimate of the mean SI derived from these studies (excluding\n28\n), weighting by the number of observed SIs used for estimation in each study, was 3\u00b70 days (CI 95% [2\u00b74, 3\u00b76]). No correlation was found between the reported SI and the size of the study (P = 0\u00b73) or the date of report (P = 0\u00b73). Household\u2010based studies did not yield different estimates of the mean SI than close\u2010contact studies (P = 0\u00b715).\n\nA second group of four studies reported the SI or GT estimated by modeling epidemic curves. These included the smallest estimate of all, a mean GT of 1\u00b79 days (CI 95% [1\u00b73, 2\u00b77]) in a Mexican village,\n34\n and the largest, a mean GT of 4\u20135 days in Ontario.\n35\n The two other estimates used epidemic curves in the United States and Mexico, with results in the range of 2\u00b76\u20133\u00b72 days for the mean SI or GT. White estimated the mean SI at 2\u00b76 days (CI 95% [1\u00b79, 3\u00b73]), but accounting for increased case ascertainment in time reduced this estimate to 2\u00b72 days.\n36\n In Yang, the mean GT was 2\u00b77 or 3\u00b72 days depending on the assumed parametric form (Weibull or gamma).\n29\n\n\n\nReproduction numbers were reported in 24 studies (see Table 2 and Figure 2) for 20 countries. All studies focused on the first few months of the pandemic, with data obtained between March and October 2009. Overall, the estimates at the community level (town, region or country) varied between 1\u00b71 and 3\u00b71, with a median value of 1\u00b76. In the Netherlands, as in other European countries (except the UK), the reproduction number was smaller than 1 (R = 0\u00b75) in the period considered.\n32\n, \n37\n The largest estimate (R = 3\u00b73) was obtained from the analysis of a school outbreak.\n22\n Ten papers qualified the reproduction number as \u2018basic\u2019, with a range from 1\u00b73 to 2\u00b73, all assuming that the whole population was susceptible at first; this range was not significantly different from that of the otherwise reported R values.\n\nIn 15 analyses, the exponential growth rate estimated from the initial epidemic curve was used to estimate the reproduction number, with a range of values between 0\u00b75 and 3\u00b71. The method for estimating the exponential growth rate was variable (for example, Poisson regression,\n38\n birth and death process,\n39\n least squares,\n40\n modified logistic growth\n41\n), as was the GT distribution (mean GT between 1\u00b79 and 4\u00b71) and the formula linking the exponential growth rate to the reproduction number. Other methods of estimation included fitting the output of transmission models to the data.\n34\n, \n35\n, \n42\n In two instances, the reproduction number was estimated using cases seen in tourists returning from Mexico, yielding 1\u00b74 (95% CI [1\u00b72, 1\u00b78])\n34\n when comparing the number of cases in 9 countries to model predictions and 1\u00b77 (CI 95% [1\u00b76, 1\u00b79]) using only the date of first introduction in 12 countries.\n43\n\n\n\nNo correlation was found in the reported reproduction number and the GT used in its computation (r = \u22120\u00b704; P = 0\u00b783). There was a decreasing trend in the reported values with time (r = \u22120\u00b75, P = 0\u00b7004), large estimates being more frequent at first. A first explanation was the inclusion of correction for under\u2010reporting: while no correction was applied for an early estimate in Mexico (R = 2\u00b72\n38\n) and another analysis (R = 2\u00b73\n29\n), accounting for an increasing trend in case reporting led to large differences, from 2\u00b74 to 1\u00b76 after such correction in Australia,\n44\n from 2\u00b72 to 1\u00b77 in the United States,\n36\n and from 2 to 1\u00b74 in Mexico.\n42\n Another issue was the importance of school outbreaks in the early epidemic curve, so that the estimated reproduction number was not representative of transmission in the community. For example, the R estimate was 2\u00b73 in Japan with a GT of 1\u00b79 days,\n39\n but the reproduction number was approximately 1\u00b73 when transmission was later established in the community.\n45\n Considering only estimates for which underdeclaration was taken into account and the generation time was close to 3 days, the reproduction number was between 1\u00b72 and 2\u00b73, with median value 1\u00b75.\n\nA striking feature of the household/close\u2010contact studies for the mean SI was that most estimates were in the range of 2\u00b75\u20133\u00b75 days, although the sampling as well as the methods of analysis was different. Overall, the weighted mean SI of all estimates was 3\u00b70 days (CI 95% [2\u00b77, 3\u00b73]), but this reduced to 2\u00b76 days in the studies where tertiary transmission was accounted for. Studies in households may have provided the best framework to estimate the SI, as potential contacts could be more easily identified. The only truly prospective study yielded little information (8 events),\n21\n so that the best evidence remains that from American households.\n24\n\n\n\nThe number of studies documenting the serial interval in the 2009 influenza pandemic contrasts with the relative absence of information for past pandemics or seasonal influenza. Indeed, before 2009, the two best documented values for the mean SI concerned seasonal influenza, with two estimates obtained in household\u2010based studies: 2\u00b76 days (CI 95% 2\u00b71, 3\u00b70)\n6\n and 3\u00b76 days (CI 95% [2\u00b79, 4\u00b73])\n5\n; no information was available for past pandemics. The current estimate for A/H1N1 (2009) was somewhat closer to the first estimate; it was also in good agreement with the 2\u00b78 days obtained by using the profile of viral excretion as a indicative of the GT distribution.\n46\n\n\n\nAs reported mean SIs are rather short, it is worth examining whether the mean SI could have been biased downwards. Changes in behavior and interventions may make long serial intervals unlikely. There was little information regarding behavior change and interventions in the reported studies: household members were, for example, instructed in simple hand\u2010hygiene,\n21\n some index cases received antiviral treatment,\n26\n but neither isolation nor quarantine was reported. As all studies concerned the early phase of the pandemic, differences in attitude toward the A/H1N1 flu may have been limited. A second issue is that the combination of rapid transmission and limited number of contacts in households may lead to small intervals.\n16\n The secondary attack rates were modest (13%,\n24\n 11\u00b72%,\n31\n 11\u00b73%,\n23\n 8%\n21\n), arguing against a large effect in this respect because of susceptible depletion. A short follow\u2010up could also limit the possibility of observing long serial intervals. In most studies when this was reported, the duration of follow\u2010up in households was approximately 1 week so that few secondary cases should have been missed. Finally, some cases counted as secondary may have been attributed to common exposure (coprimary cases), leading to a downward bias. However, in most cases, cases occurring on the same date as the index case were excluded from the calculations, therefore limiting this bias.\n\nUpward bias could occur because of successive generations of influenza overlapping in small time periods.\n15\n Indeed, some observed serial intervals in close\u2010contact studies may be between primary and tertiary cases rather than secondary cases. Two studies used modeling to explicitly account for such phenomenon: in both approaches, the modeled mean SI was shorter than the empirical mean of observed values (2\u00b76 vs. 2\u00b79\n24\n; 2\u00b75 vs. 3\u00b74\n31\n). This suggests that tertiary transmission is always an issue for estimating the serial interval of influenza, and further implies that estimates reported in the other 11 studies could have been biased upwards.\n\nThe GT or SI estimates obtained by modeling epidemic curves were more variable. In such approaches, the mean GT depends on the structure of the model\n14\n: in the classical SEIR model, it is L + I, where L and I are the average durations of the latent and infectious period, so that the mean GT should have been 6 days instead of 4\u20135 days in Canada\n35\n; when the E and I stages are split into two (as in \n34\n, \n46\n), the mean GT is L + 3/4 \u00d7 I, so that it should have been 1\u00b76 days rather than 1\u00b79 days in the La Gloria epidemic in Mexico.\n34\n The two other modeling approaches yielded estimates similar to those in households/close\u2010contact studies.\n\nReproduction numbers for the A/H1N1 2009 pandemic varied according to place, methods, and hypotheses, with a reported range from 1\u00b71 to 3\u00b73. While the most used approach relied on determining the initial exponential growth, the formulas and fitting methods changed with authors and how the initial exponential growth period was chosen was little documented. When provided, the sensitivity analyses illustrated that somewhat arbitrary hypotheses (choice of the GT, correction for under\u2010reporting, exponential growth period,\u2026) had a large effect on the reported value. In Mexico alone, estimates ranged between 1\u00b72 and 3\u00b71 during the same period.\n29\n, \n34\n, \n38\n, \n40\n, \n42\n Factors explaining these differences were numerous. The first is differences in data, either by nature (travelers back from Mexico or suspected/confirmed cases in Mexico or local epidemics or genetic sequence) or by collection time. For example, cases were added to the epidemic curve in retrospect, so that early estimates were biased upwards.\n38\n A second factor was the choice of the GT distribution, shorter mean GTs leading to smaller reproduction number estimates: from 3\u00b71 (mean GT = 4 days) to 2\u00b72 (mean GT = 3 days),\n38\n from 3\u00b74 (mean GT = 5\u00b75 days) to 1\u00b79 (mean GT = 2\u00b73 days; supplementary material\n29\n), and from 2\u00b70 (mean GT = 2\u00b76 days) to 1\u00b74 (mean GT = 1\u00b79 days\n34\n). When similar mean GTs were allowed (approximately 3 days), less variability was present (2\u00b72,\n38\n 2\u00b70,\n34\n 2\u00b73\n29\n). A third factor was underdeclaration in the initial period of the pandemic, leading to smaller estimates: from 2 to 1\u00b74\n42\n and from 2\u00b76 to 2\u00b74.\n29\n Methods less dependent on the completeness of the data (genetic sequences, travelers out of Mexico) consistently led to lower estimates, from 1\u00b72 to 1\u00b77.\n\nThe short mean GT (1\u00b79 days\n34\n) estimated early in Mexico may have led to underestimation when it was used to estimate the reproduction number in later studies. The impact was moderate: for example, the reproduction number in several countries from the southern hemisphere ranged between 1\u00b72 to 1\u00b76 using a GT of 1\u00b79 days\n41\n and increased by approximately 10% when a mean GT of 2\u00b78 days was used. In practice, collecting data that allow the joint estimation of the serial interval and reproduction ratio should be encouraged to limit these uncertainties.\n48\n\n\n\nIn approximately one report of two, the authors described the estimated reproduction ratio as \u2018basic\u2019 (i.e., R\n0), while others used \u2018initial\u2019, \u2018effective\u2019, several qualifiers or none. Estimating R\n0 requires an additional assumption on the initial susceptibility of the population, and all authors reporting R\n0 assumed, often implicitly, that the whole population was initially susceptible. It is now known that adults over 50 years of age were less susceptible to the disease,\n24\n, \n49\n making this assumption incorrect. Practically, this means that it is unlikely that any of the reported estimates were truly \u2018basic\u2019 and that accounting for differential susceptibility will be required to obtain R\n0 estimates. For public health purposes, however, it is the initial R which is the most relevant estimates as it informs on the required strength of interventions and is useful to calibrate mathematical models. In this respect, the reproduction number may have been poorly estimated at the start of the pandemic, as a result of poor case ascertainment; how imported cases in the course of the outbreak were accounted for in estimation; and the over\u2010representation of places like schools where transmission was large.\n45\n Several new methods have been proposed to estimate the reproduction number during the pandemic,\n34\n, \n36\n, \n42\n, \n50\n, \n51\n which should now be compared in terms of data requirements, applicability, and how they deal with the issues listed earlier to help select best practice.\n\nOverall, the initial reproduction number estimates of A/H1N1 (2009) pandemic ranged from 1\u00b72 to 2\u00b73 with median value 1\u00b75 when correction for underdeclaration was applied and the mean GT was approximately 3 days. This was lower than the median for 1889, 1918, and 1957, but compared with 1968 (see Figure 2). For example, the reproduction number (using a mean GT of 2\u00b78 days) was between 1\u00b77 and 3\u00b70 (median 2\u00b71) in 96 cities in 1889,\n7\n between 1\u00b73 and 2\u00b75 in 1918 (using estimates obtained with GTs approximately 3 days),\n8\n, \n11\n, \n12\n, \n52\n, \n53\n, \n54\n lower than 2 in 1957,\n10\n, \n55\n, \n56\n, \n57\n and in the range of 1\u20132 in 1968.\n9\n, \n57\n\n\n\nA large number of studies have documented transmission parameters for the A/H1N1 (2009) pandemic almost in real time. Short generation times and low reproduction number were characteristic in the first year of introduction of the virus. The A/H1N1 (2009) pandemic led to less mortality than previous pandemics, compared with past flu pandemics regarding transmission."}
