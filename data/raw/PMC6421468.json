{"title": "OAS-RNase L innate immune pathway mediates the cytotoxicity of a DNA-demethylating drug", "body": "DNMTi\u2019s induce the accumulation of self dsRNA in several different tumor cell types (7, 14, 15). We confirmed this observation in A549 NSCLC cells treated with 50 \u03bcM AZA for 48 h by visualizing cytoplasmic dsRNA accumulation with a monoclonal antibody against dsRNA (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). While there was no detectable dsRNA in untreated cells, accumulation of dsRNA in the cytoplasm was apparent after AZA treatment. To determine whether RNase L affects AZA sensitivity, we compared parental vector control A549 cells (wild type; WT) with RNase L knockout (KO) cells, previously generated with CRISPR-Cas9 technology (33) (SI Appendix, Fig. S2A). Cells treated with different amounts of AZA were monitored for survival as a function of time using an IncuCyte real-time cell imaging system (Essen Bioscience) and a dual-dye method. While the majority of WT cells appeared dead after 48 h of AZA treatment, the AZA-treated RNase L KO cells appeared normal (Fig. 1 A\u2013D). Quantification of WT cell survival showed that 63 and 77% of the cells had died by 60 h in response to 50 or 100 \u03bcM AZA, respectively (Fig. 1E). Cell death in WT cells was observed at concentrations of 6 \u03bcM AZA or greater. In contrast, the RNase L KO cells were highly resistant to 100 \u03bcM AZA after 60 h, with little or no death (Fig. 1F).\n\nTo confirm that RNase L was responsible for AZA sensitivity, RNase L KO A549 cells were transiently transduced with lentiviral constructs encoding either WT or nuclease-dead mutant (R667A) RNase L (34) (Fig. 1G). Knockin (K-In) of WT RNase L sensitized the cells to AZA, leading to decreased cell survival, whereas introduction of mutant RNase L (R667A) had a diminished effect on cell survival (Fig. 1H). These results demonstrate that AZA-induced cell death requires RNase L with a functional catalytic domain.\n\nImmortalized, human mammary epithelial hTert-HME1 (HME) cells were also rendered highly resistant to AZA by knockout of RNase L (Fig. 2 A\u2013C). The relative contributions of the different OAS isoforms to AZA-induced cell death were determined with double-knockout (DKO) HME cells, each expressing only one of the three enzymatically competent OAS isoforms. DKO cells lacking OAS2 and 3, OAS1 and 3, or OAS1 and 2 express only OAS1 (O1), 2 (O2), or 3 (O3), respectively (Fig. 2D). Survival of the different types of untreated cells was unaffected by OAS DKO or triple-knockout (TKO) genotypes (Fig. 2 E and H). Interestingly, expression of any of the three OAS isoforms rendered HME cells nearly as sensitive to AZA as the WT cells (Fig. 2F). However, compared with WT cells, the HME cells lacking all three OAS isoforms, namely TKO cells, were relatively resistant to AZA (Fig. 2 G and I), presumably because these cells are unable to synthesize 2-5A and are thus unable to activate RNase L. The observation that the OAS TKO cells are less resistant to AZA than RNase L KO cells suggests alternative functions of OAS isozymes that are not dependent on RNase L function (Fig. 2 C and I).\n\ndsRNA signaling to the type I IFN genes requires the MDA5-RIG-I/MAVS pathway (35). Therefore, to determine whether IFN production, with subsequent OAS induction, is required for AZA-induced cell death, A549 cells in which MAVS was knocked out individually or in combination with RNase L were used (SI Appendix, Fig. S2A). MAVS KO A549 cells were only slightly less sensitive to AZA treatment than WT cells, suggesting that, although IFN production may have contributed to AZA-mediated cell death, its effects were modest (SI Appendix, Fig. S2 B and C). However, the RNase L-MAVS DKO cells were resistant to AZA at concentrations as high as 50 \u03bcM (SI Appendix, Fig. S2D), similar to RNase L KO cells (Fig. 1F). These results suggest that basal levels of OAS1 to 3 in A549 cells, confirmed by gene expression analysis (SI Appendix, Table S1), are sufficient for the cell-lethal effect of AZA, through RNase L activation.\n\nTo determine the mode of cell death by AZA, caspase-3/7 activation was monitored as a marker of apoptosis by real-time imaging with the IncuCyte system and software (Fig. 3). While WT A549 cells activate caspase-3/7 strongly in response to AZA, the RNase L KO A549 cells were resistant to AZA (Fig. 3 A and B). MAVS KO cells showed a modest reduction in caspase-3/7 activation, whereas RNase L-MAVS DKO cells were highly resistant, similar to the RNase L single-KO cells (Fig. 3 B\u2013D). As a positive control, the pan-caspase inhibitor ZVAD-FMK greatly suppressed caspase-3/7 activation, as expected.\n\nTo confirm that AZA treatment induces apoptosis, PARP cleavage was monitored in Western assays. Treatment of WT A549 cells with 50 \u03bcM AZA for 48 h resulted in cleaved PARP (Fig. 3E). In contrast, identical treatment of RNase L KO A549 cells did not lead to PARP [poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase] cleavage. Thus, AZA induction of both caspase-3/7 activation and PARP cleavage in WT but not in RNase L KO cells indicates cell death occurred through the proapoptotic activity of RNase L (25, 26, 36).\n\nTo further validate the involvement of RNase L in AZA-mediated cell death, a potent small-molecule inhibitor of RNase L, valoneic acid dilactone (VAL), was used. Treatment of A549 cells with 10 \u03bcM VAL protected them against the cytotoxic effect of AZA (Fig. 4 A and B). Similarly, VAL suppressed caspase-3/7 activation in response to AZA, showing that apoptosis was prevented by chemical inhibition of RNase L (Fig. 4C).\n\nPreviously, we reported that RNase L activity triggers the phosphorylation of JNKs, and also that JNK-deficient cells are resistant to RNase L-mediated apoptosis (29). Accordingly, AZA-induced cell death was inhibited by treating WT A549 cells with the JNK inhibitor SP600125 (Fig. 4D). The RNase L KO cells were resistant to AZA in the absence or presence of this inhibitor (Fig. 4E). The rescue from cell death by the JNK inhibitor implicates JNK in the RNase L-dependent mechanism of apoptosis in response to AZA treatment.\n\n2-5A is degraded in cells through the action of the 2\u2032,5\u2032-phosphodiesterases AKAP7 and PDE12 (30, 31, 37). Therefore, to increase 2-5A accumulation and RNase L activity during AZA treatment, the genes encoding AKAP7 and PDE12 were knocked out in A549 cells, individually and in combination (Fig. 5A). Previously, ablation of either AKAP7 or PDE12 increased 2-5A levels by retarding its degradation (31, 37). Deletion of AKAP7 slightly increased cell-death rates in the presence of AZA, whereas PDE12 knockout had a much larger effect (Fig. 5B). The DKO for both AKAP7 and PDE12 greatly increased cell death in response to AZA (Fig. 5B). These results suggest that extending the half-life of 2-5A in cells by depleting or inhibiting 2-5A catabolic enzymes increases sensitivity to AZA.\n\nTo determine whether direct activation of RNase L would impact tumor cell killing by AZA, WT and RNase L KO A549 cells were treated with AZA alone, transfected with 2-5A, or treated with both agents (Fig. 5 C and D). Whereas transfection with a low dose of 2-5A (1 \u03bcM) by itself had no effect on WT cell survival and AZA (25 \u03bcM) by itself reduced cell survival, the combination of 2-5A (1 \u03bcM) and AZA (25 \u03bcM) eliminated nearly all cells (Fig. 5C). In contrast, RNase L KO cells were completely resistant to AZA, 2-5A, or the combination of both agents (Fig. 5D). These results demonstrate that exogenous 2-5A increases the cell-lethal effect of AZA and that the mechanism of action is entirely dependent on RNase L.\n\nADAR1 edits adenosine (A) to inosine (I) in dsRNA, which destabilizes dsRNA because A:U base pairs are more stable than I:U mismatches (38\u201340). Our prior study suggested that the accumulation of constitutively produced self dsRNA in ADAR1 KO cells leads to OAS-RNase L activation and cell death (28). Because the knockout of ADAR1 is lethal in A549 cells, it was necessary to use combination knockout cells for these experiments. To determine whether ADAR1 antagonizes the cell-lethal effect of AZA, A549 cells of different ADAR1, MAVS, and RNase L genotypes were treated with AZA. Western blots for these cell lines are shown in Fig. 5E and SI Appendix, Fig. S3 (in which IFN was used to induce levels of ADAR1 p150). ADAR1 p150, and to a lesser extent OAS1, was also induced by AZA (SI Appendix, Fig. S3B). Cells with ADAR1-RNase L-MAVS TKO or ADAR1-RNase L DKO were resistant to AZA (Fig. 5F). In contrast, ADAR1-MAVS DKO cells showed increased AZA sensitivity compared with WT cells, presumably because of increased accumulation of self dsRNA due to the absence of ADAR1 (Fig. 5F). To further determine the relative contribution of ADAR1 isoforms, A549 cells lacking the IFN-inducible ADAR1 p150 isoform were compared with WT A549 cells (Fig. 5G and SI Appendix, Fig. S3). ADAR1 p150 KO cells were more sensitive to AZA, suggesting that p150 is primarily involved in AZA-induced cytotoxicity. These results indicate that the AZA sensitivity of cells can be increased by ADAR1 deficiency.\n\nIR induces type I IFN signaling, and OAS genes are included in the IFN-related DNA damage resistance signature, whose expression correlates with radiation resistance in cancer cells (32, 41). To determine the effect of IR on AZA-mediated cell death through the OAS-RNase L pathway, WT and RNase L KO A549 cells were exposed to 10 Gy of IR and then either mock-treated or treated with 12.5 or 25 \u00b5M AZA (Fig. 5 H\u2013J). The kinetics of cell death was determined by real-time cell imaging. There was no effect on cell viability of IR treatment alone in WT and RNase L KO cells, as A549 cells are relatively resistant to radiation (Fig. 5H). However, the combination of AZA and IR significantly increased the cell-death rates in WT cells compared with AZA treatment alone, whereas the RNase L KO cells were resistant to IR and AZA (Fig. 5 I and J). These results suggest that IR increases RNase L-dependent cell death triggered by AZA treatment.\n\nTo determine whether AZA sensitivity is correlated with OAS-RNase L levels in different tumor cell types, we interrogated gene expression profiles of the NCI-60 database of 60 human tumor cell lines in the presence or absence of AZA (Fig. 6 and SI Appendix, Table S1). In these 60 cell lines, representative of the histologic and genetic diversity of cancer, the expression levels of OAS1 (Fig. 6A) and OASL (Fig. 6B) predict sensitivity to AZA; that is, the higher the expression levels of these enzymes, the greater the sensitivity of the cells to the lethal effect of AZA. These results suggest that OAS1 levels, in particular, can be a marker for sensitivity to AZA-induced cytotoxicity.\n\nDNMTi\u2019s have long been known to induce an IFN response that is characterized by ISG expression (16), although the molecular mechanism has only recently been elucidated. Hypomethylation of DNA resulting from DNMTi treatment leads to production of self dsRNA from ERVs, short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs), and other repetitive DNA elements, triggering an innate immune response that resembles the response induced by viral infections, or by ADAR1 KO in the absence of viral infection (14, 15, 28, 42). dsRNA signals through the MDA5-RIG-I/MAVS/IRF3\u2013IRF7 pathway to induce type I and III IFNs which, in turn, induce the expression of ISGs, including OAS1 to 3, that mediate most biological effects of these IFNs. For example, DAC was shown to induce an IFN response in colorectal cancer-initiating cells (CICs) through the MDA5/MAVS/IRF7 signaling pathway (14). Long-term growth of CICs was inhibited following transient treatment with a low dose of DAC. Similarly, the cellular response to DNMTi\u2019s (AZA or DAC) was characterized by high expression of ERVs and IFN, which sensitized melanomas to immunotherapy with anti\u2013CTLA-4 (15).\n\ndsRNA also directly activates two types of IFN-induced enzymes, the protein kinase PKR, which blocks translational initiation, and OAS1 to 3, which synthesize 2-5A activators of RNase L (43). The only well-established function of 2-5A is activation of RNase L, an antiviral protein with proapoptotic activity (21, 25, 26, 36). Here we observe that deletion of RNase L or OAS1 to 3 isoforms renders cells highly resistant to AZA-induced death. These results are in contrast to the consequences of viral infections of cells, in which OAS3 is the dominant OAS isoform, at least in some cell types (33). In addition to demethylating DNA, AZA treatment leads to RNA demethylation (44), which increases RNA immune signaling through TLR3 (45). However, the dependence on the dsRNA-activated OAS-RNase L pathway for AZA-induced cell death suggests that it is DNA demethylation leading to dsRNA, and not RNA demethylation, that is responsible for the cytotoxic response. RNase L causes apoptosis through a ribotoxic stress pathway involving JNK-dependent signaling (29). Consistent with the involvement of RNase L in AZA-induced cell death is the observation that a small-molecule inhibitor of JNK suppresses apoptosis in response to AZA.\n\nPreviously, AZA-induced cytotoxicity was linked to reversible DNA damage stemming from the formation of covalent complexes between DNA and DNMTs (46, 47). Also, during DNA damage induced by IR or chemotherapeutic agents, U1 and U2 small noncoding RNAs accumulate in the cytoplasm, activating the pathogen recognition receptor RIG-I and IFN-dependent signaling (32). In support of this idea, we show here that IR increases the cytotoxicity of AZA through RNase L. Very interestingly, many different primary malignant tumors, including those of the head and neck, lung, prostate, breast, and high-grade gliomas, express high levels of OAS expression as part of the IFN-related DNA damage resistance signature (41). Therefore, AZA-induced cell death through OAS-RNase L is likely to preferentially target these cancer cells in vivo.\n\nGenetic deficiency in the dsRNA-editing enzyme ADAR1 can lead to RNase L-dependent death (28) or IFN-stimulated translational arrest through PKR (48). There are similarities between the cellular effects of AZA treatment and ADAR1 mutation, in that both lead to the formation of self dsRNA, transcribed from repetitive DNA elements, including Alu (SINE) and hERV elements (14, 15, 48). When ADAR1 is mutated, the deficiency in self dsRNA editing is believed to lead to increased activation of OAS-RNase L, whereas during AZA treatment it is likely that increased transcription of repetitive DNA elements causes OAS-RNase L activation. Since ADAR1 deletion is lethal in A549 cells, we used ADAR1-MAVS DKO A549 cells in our experiments (28). Because both ADAR1 knockout and AZA treatment result in the synthesis of self dsRNA, the combination of ADAR1 deficiency with AZA treatment was especially cytotoxic.\n\nInduction of type I IFNs by dsRNA occurs through the MDA5-RIG-I/MAVS/IRF3\u2013IRF7-NF-\u03baB signaling pathway (49). To determine whether the same pathway is required for AZA-induced cell death, MAVS KO cells were studied. MAVS deletion reduced but did not prevent cell death by OAS-RNase L in response to AZA treatment, a result similar to our findings in ADAR1 KO cells (28). Therefore, basal levels of OAS isozymes are sufficient to mediate cell death through RNase L activation (Fig. 1 and SI Appendix, Table S1). Prior studies on mouse hepatitis virus showed that, in mouse bone marrow macrophages, basal levels of OAS are sufficient for RNase L activation (33, 50). Taken together, these results reveal that IFN does not need to be induced for an antiviral or cell-death response through OAS-RNase L, provided that sufficient basal levels of OAS and RNase L are present. Furthermore, the correlation of basal OAS1 and OASL levels with AZA sensitivity in the NCI-60 tumor cell panel indicates that OAS1 (or OASL) can be a biomarker for AZA sensitivity in cancer.\n\nPrior studies on the antitumor activities of AZA and DAC showed effects against melanoma through increased immune checkpoint therapy (15) and against colorectal cancer through targeting of colorectal cancer-initiating cells (14). Also, an earlier study showed that DAC could overcome resistance to IFN-induced apoptosis in renal carcinoma and melanoma (51). DNMTi treatment of mouse cells with mutant p53 led to massive dsRNA accumulation, originating at least in part from the transcription of repetitive DNA elements, culminating in a cell-suicidal type I IFN response (42). The transcribed repetitive DNA elements included SINEs, satellite repeats, endogenous IAP retroviral DNA, and noncoding RNA genes (42). However, A549 and HME cells are p53-wild type (52, 53), yet both are AZA-sensitive. Therefore, AZA sensitivity, and the involvement of RNase L in AZA-induced cell death, is not limited to cells with mutant p53, at least not in the human cell types examined in this study.\n\nOur findings suggest strategies for increasing the anticancer effects of AZA. For instance, combining AZA with IR was highly effective in eliminating tumor cells in an RNase L-dependent manner. We also showed that knockout of PDE12 or AKAP7, which impair 2-5A degradation, increased tumor cell killing by AZA. Therefore, treatments that increase RNase L activity directly or indirectly, for instance by inhibiting PDE12 (30, 37) and/or AKAP7 (31), are predicted to increase the antitumor activities of AZA or DAC. Alternatively, inhibitors of RNase L, such VAL, are expected to mitigate the cytotoxicity of AZA. Therefore, our studies have therapeutic implications for either increasing the efficacy of DNMTi treatment of cancer or mitigating its toxicity.\n\nDetailed materials and methods for construction of gene knockout cells, immunoblotting procedures, cell-death assays, caspase-3/7 assays, IR, immunofluorescence, and statistics are described in SI Appendix."}
