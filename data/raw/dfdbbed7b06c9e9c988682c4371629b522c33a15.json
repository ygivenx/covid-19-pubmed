{"title": "Evaluation of an octahydroisochromene scaffold used as a novel SARS 3CL protease inhibitor", "body": "In 2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a life-threatening pneumonia, spread across Southeast Asia and affected about 8500 patients with > 800 fatalities. [1] [2] [3] The causative virus is a new betacoronavirus (\u03b2CoV) containing a 29.7-kb positive-strand RNA genome. Two large replicative polyproteins, pp1a (486 kDa) and pp1ab (790 kDa), are coded in the genome as precursor proteins to yield functional proteins. [4] [5] [6] Among the functional proteins, a 3C-like cysteine protease (SARS 3CL pro ) processes the polyprotein to produce itself as well as a variety of proteins necessary to re-construct the virus particles. Thus, SARS 3CL pro is thought to be an ideal target for anti-SARS agents. Numerous studies on SARS 3CL pro inhibitors have been reported, 7, 8 but no therapeutic agents are available at present.\n\nIn the course of our previous studies on SARS 3CL pro inhibitors, 9 a substrate-based peptide aldehyde (1) was shown to be a potent inhibitor (IC 50 = 98 nM) for a mutant protease, R188I SARS 3CL pro . 10 Analysis of the X-ray crystal structure of 1 complexed with R188I SARS 3CL pro revealed that the P2 site cyclohexyl ring of 1 interacts with the S2 pocket of the protease via a hydrophobic interaction. The distance between the 2-position carbon atom of the cyclohexyl-ring and \u03b1-nitrogen atom of cyclohexylalanine (Cha) was 3.48 \u00c5 (Fig. 1 ). This result suggested that the cyclohexyl ring may be connected to the peptide chain via a methylene linker, yielding a new inhibitor scaffold containing a hydrophobic decahydroisoquinoline ring. The resulting decahydroisoquinoline inhibitor (2) showed inhibitory activity as expected, but with moderate potency (IC 50 = 63 \u03bcM). 11 Analysis of the Xray crystal structure of inhibitor 2 complexed with R188I SARS 3CL pro revealed the lack of interactions with the P3 to P4 sites in substratebased inhibitor 1.\n\nIn this study, an octahydroisochromene scaffold was selected as a novel hydrophobic fused-ring in inhibitor 3 instead of decahydroisoquinoline to evaluate the effect of the configuration of the fusedring structure and novel substituents on the ring system (Fig. 2) . 12 The configuration of the octahydroisochromene ring in 3 can be easily controlled using a stereo-selective ring-closing reaction featuring the nucleophilic opening of an epoxide. The synthesis of the requisite oxygen-containing precursor used in the ring-closing reaction can be achieved using established stereo-selective reactions such as the Sharpless-Katsuki asymmetric epoxidation and Sharpless dihydroxylation reaction. In addition, the effect of the substituent at the 1-position in the fused-ring system of 3 may also be evaluated; the effects of different substituents in this position have not been assessed in our previous studies using the decahydroisoquinoline scaffold in 2. 12 inhibitors containing an octahydroisochromene scaffold with four different substituents at the 1-position were designed and synthesized.\n\nThe retrosynthetic analysis of octahydroisochromene inhibitor 3 is shown in Scheme 1. (S)-2-Amino-3-imidazolyl propanal (His-al), the warhead part of 3, was to be introduced using a reductive amination reaction between His-al and octahydroisochromene derivative 4. The substituent at the 1-position of the octahydroisochromene ring in 4 was also introduced using a reductive amination reaction of the requisite amine and the aldehyde constructed via oxidative cleavage of the 1,2diol in key intermediate 5. Construction of the octahydroisochromene ring in 5, a key step in the synthesis, may be carried out using an intramolecular nucleophilic addition reaction of the hydroxyl group to the epoxide in cyclohexyl derivative 6. The configuration of the resulting ring structure in 5 can be controlled using a combination of the stereo-chemistry of the nucleophilic secondary hydroxyl group and electrophilic epoxide in 6, which make it possible to selectively form the four possible configurations of the ring system in 5. The configuration of the nucleophilic hydroxyl groups in 6 can be controlled using a Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation reaction 13 on the olefin in 7 and the configuration of the electrophilic epoxide in 7 can be selectively constructed using a Sharpless-Katsuki asymmetric epoxidation reaction 14 on the allylic alcohol obtained upon the functional group conversion of commercially available diol 8.\n\nSynthesis of key intermediate 5 was achieved starting from a commercially available compound (8) according to the route shown in Scheme 2. Monoprotection of diol 8 using tert-butyl diphenylsilyl chloride (TBDPSCl) followed by oxidation of the unprotected alcohol in the resulting product via a Ley-Griffith oxidation reaction using tetrapropyl ammonium perruthenate (TPAP) gave the corresponding aldehyde. The product was used with any purification, and reacted with (methoxymethyl)triphenylphosphonium chloride to give 9. The methoxyvinyl group in 9 was then converted to the corresponding aldehyde upon treatment with 10-camphorsulfonic acid. The isolated aldehyde was reacted with methyl triphenylphosphonium chloride to yield a terminal olefin. The TBDPS group in the product was then removed upon treatment with tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride (TBAF) to give 10. The primary alcohol in 10 was oxidized via a Ley-Griffith oxidation reaction and the resulting aldehyde homologated using a Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons (HWE) reaction upon reaction with ethyl 2-(diethoxyphosphoryl)acetate to give 11. The ethyl ester in 11 was reduced with diisobutyl aluminum hydride (DIBAL-H) and the resulting allylic alcohol stereo-specifically oxidized via a Sharpless-Katsuki asymmetric epoxidation reaction using tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) in the presence of titanium tetraisopropoxide (TTIP) and (S, S)-diethyltartrate ((-)-DET) to yield 12 as a single diastereomer. The terminal olefin in 12 was then oxidized via a Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation reaction using potassium osmate (VI) dehydrate (K 2 OsO 2 (OH) 4 ) and potassium ferricyanide (K 3 Fe(CN) 6 ) in the presence of hydroquinine (anthraquinone-1,4-diyl) diether ((DHQ) 2 AQN). The formation of the expected diol was confirmed by 1 H NMR spectroscopy with the simultaneous production of a small amount of the cyclized product (13) formed via the nucleophilic addition of the resulting alcohol. Thus, the mixture was treated with p-toluenesulfonic acid without any further purification to convert the remaining dihydroxylated product into the desired cyclized product (13) . However, whether product 13 was formed as a single diasteroisomer or an inseparable mixture of diastereomers could not be determined using 1 H NMR spectroscopy. Thus, the product was converted into the final products containing different substituents at the 1-position of the octahydroisochromene scaffold to evaluate whether the fused ring structure would function as a novel inhibitor scaffold. Conversion of key intermediate 13 into the final product was carried out according to the route shown in Scheme 3. The terminal 1,2-diol in 13 was oxidatively cleaved using sodium periodate and the resulting aldehyde subjected to a reductive amination reaction with four different amines in the presence of NaBH 3 CN. Each aminated product was then methylated with paraformaldehyde to give 14a-d. The primary alcohol in each product was oxidized using N-tert-butylbenzensulfenamide/1-chloropyrrolidine-2,5-dione (NCS) and the resulting aldehydes were reductively condensed with H-His-N(OMe)Me to give their corresponding Weinreb amides (15a-d). 15 Each product was finally reduced to their corresponding aldehyde upon treatment with DIBAL-H and purified by LC/MS to give the desired aldehyde product (16a-d), which exhibited a broad single peak in LC.\n\nTo access whether the octahydroisochromene derivatives containing substituents at the 1-position of the ring system function as a novel inhibitor scaffold, the inhibitory activity of compounds 16a-d toward SARS 3CL pro was preliminary evaluated by the IC 50 values obtained using the procedure described below. As summarized in Table 1 , compound 16a bearing an n-butyl group showed moderate inhibitory activity, whereas 16c bearing an isobutyl group showed no inhibitory activity. Compounds 16b and 16d bearing allyl and benzyl substituents, respectively showed weak activity. Although the absolute configurations of 16a to 16d were not identified, these results strongly suggested that the octahydroisochromene scaffold can function as a novel hydrophobic scaffold in the SARS 3CL pro inhibitor and may also interact with the protease at the 1-position of the fused-ring system.\n\nConfirmation of the configuration of compounds 16a-d was then conducted based on the above findings. Since it was unclear whether key intermediate 13 used for the above syntheses was formed as a single diastereomer or an inseparable mixture of diastereoisomers using 1 H NMR spectroscopy, the 13 C NMR spectrum of 13 was examined and two signals were detected for the methine carbon atom neighboring an oxygen atom in the octahydroisochromene scaffold ( Fig. S-1 ). This result strongly suggests that triol 13 obtained using the Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation reaction using (DHQ) 2 AQN as a ligand was formed as a 1.5:1 diastereoisomeric mixture (Scheme 2 and entry 1 in Table 2 ). Thus, the reaction conditions used in the asymmetric dihydroxylation were evaluated focusing on the chiral ligand, a key factor in the stereo-selectivity of the reaction. 16 Precursor 12 was treated with K 2 OsO 2 (OH) 4 and K 3 Fe(CN) 6 with or without the chiral ligand as stated above (Scheme 2) and the products immediately converted into triol 13 upon treatment with p-toluenesulfonic acid. The diastereoisomeric ratio of the products was estimated using the methine carbon atom signal in the 13 C NMR spectrum. Table 2 shows that in the absence of the chiral ligand, an equal amount of both the possible diastereomers was obtained (entry 4). A slight preference for one diastereomer was observed when hydroquinine (anthraquinone-1,4-diyl) diether ((DHQ) 2 AQN) was used as the chiral ligand, as in Scheme 2 (Table 2, entry 1). In contrast, a much better preference for one diastereoisomer was observed when 1,4-bis(dihydroquinine)phthalazine ((DHQ) 2 PHAL) or hydroquinidine-2,5-diphenyl-4,6-pyrimidinediyl diether ((DHQ) 2 Pyr) was used as the chiral ligand. (DHQ) 2 Pyr (entry 3) showed a slightly better diastereoisomeric ratio (dr = 7:1) than (DHQ) 2 PHAL (entry 2, dr = 6:1), which made it technically feasible to isolate the major product. As expected, the diastereoisomeric ratio was inverted when hydroquinidine-2,5-diphenyl-4,6-pyrimidinediyl diether ((DHQD) 2 Pyr) was used as the chiral ligand (entry 5, dr = 1:15).\n\nTo determine the configuration of each diastereomer (13a and 13b), the major product obtained after the asymmetric dihydroxylation reaction using (DHQ) 2 Pyr as the chiral ligand (Table 2, entry 3) was isolated and purified using preparative thin layer chromatography (PTLC). In the 1 H NMR spectrum of the major product, a nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) was observed between the protons at the 1and 3-positions of the octahydroisochromene ring and between the protons at the 3-positon and bridgehead \u03b1-position, which indicates that these protons adopt a cis-\u03b1-configuration ( Fig. S-1a) . The coupling constant between the proton at the 1-position and the neighboring proton of the secondary alcohol was observed to be 9.7 Hz, which also indicates the cis-configuration of the protons. Taken together, it was estimated that the configuration of the major product was (1-S, 3-R) 13a, as shown in Table 1 . 17 Although the confirmed structure of 13a was the opposite to that expected for the asymmetric dihydroxylation reaction, it has been occasionally reported depending on the substrate used. 18, 19 In this specific substrate, steric hindrance due to the epoxy alcohol interferes with the ordinary interactions with the chiral ligand to direct attack of potassium osmate to the terminal olefin from the less sterically hindered face ( Fig. S-1c ).\n\nBased on these results, the stereo-selective synthesis of all the possible diastereomers derived from the oxygen atom in the octahydroisochromene ring were then carried out to evaluate the steric effect of the fused ring on their inhibitory activity. In these syntheses, the separation and purification of the major product was achieved in the final step of the synthesis using LC/MS instead of purifying intermediate 13 (Scheme 3). In addition, an n-butyl group was employed as the suitable substituent at the 1-position in accordance with our preliminary evaluation of the inhibitory activity using the diastereo-isomeric mixtures of compounds 16a-d ( Table 1) .\n\nThe synthetic route used to prepare (1-S, 3-R) 3a is shown in Scheme 4-(i). The allylic alcohol obtained from the reduction of ester 11 was oxidized via a Sharpless-Katsuki asymmetric epoxidation reaction using (-)-DET as the chiral ligand to give 12 as a single diastereoisomer. The terminal olefin in 12 was then oxidized via a Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation reaction using (DHQ) 2 Pyr as the chiral ligand to give 13a as the major product (dr = 7:1). The mixture was then used for the following reactions without separating the major product. Oxidative cleavage of the 1,2-diol in 13a and the subsequent reductive amination reaction using n-butyl amine and paraformaldehyde were conducted as described for compound 14a (Scheme 3). The final coupling with H-His-N(OMe)Me followed by reduction with DIBAL-H was carried out as described for compound 16a (Scheme 3) to yield 3a as the major product. Since the diasteroisomeric ratio of the major product was relatively high (dr = 7:1), purification of the desired 3a could be achieved using LC/MS without difficulty. A diastereoisomer 3b with the configuration of (1-S, 3-S) was synthesized by employing a combination of (-)-DET and (DHQD) 2 Pyr, which were used in the Sharpless-Katsuki asymmetric epoxidation reaction (yielding a single diastereoisomer) Scheme 3. Synthetic route used to prepare inhibitors 16a-d. Table 1 IC 50 values obtained for compounds 16a-d. and the Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation reaction (dr = 1:15), respectively. The product was then purified using LC/MS with high homogeneity. Further, diastereoisomers, 3c and 3d, were synthesized with the configurations of (1-R, 3-R) and (1-R, 3-S), respectively; this was achieved by employing synthetic routes as shown in Scheme 4-(ii). For the construction of the configuration of (1-R, 3-R) in 13c, a combination of (+)-DET and (DHQ) 2 Pyr was used, which were utilized in the Sharpless-Katsuki asymmetric epoxidation reaction (yielding a single diastereoisomer) and the Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation reaction (dr = 8:1), respectively. Similarly, the construction for the configuration of (1-R, 3-S) in 13d was performed using a combination of (+)-DET and (DHQD) 2 Pyr, which were utilized in the Sharpless-Katsuki asymmetric epoxidation reaction (yielding a single diastereoisomer) and the Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation reaction (dr > 29:1), respectively. In both syntheses, the diastereo-excess (dr) was exceedingly high, which led to both the products, 13c and 13d, being obtained as single diastereoisomers. Likewise, each product was then converted to 3c or 3d as mentioned above and purified using LC/MS with high homogeneity. Table 3 IC 50 values obtained for inhibitors 3a-d.\n\nThe inhibitory activities of 16a-d and 3a-d were evaluated based on the IC 50 values obtained according to a literature procedure (Table 1 and 3). 9 In brief, a peptide substrate, H-Thr-Ser-Ala-Val-Leu-Gln-Ser-Gly-Phe-Arg-Lys-NH 2 , was incubated with R188I SARS 3CL pro at 37\u00b0C for 2 h in the presence of each inhibitor and the resulting mixture was analyzed using analytical HPLC performed on a C18 reversed-phase column. The IC 50 value of 16a was estimated from the sigmoidal plot obtained from the decrease in the digested substrate ( Fig. S-2) . However, the as-obtained IC 50 value (Table 1 ) was an approximate value and only indicated the inhibition tendency because the obtained plot was not well fitted to the expected sigmoidal curve due to the presence of only 40% of the desired diastereomer (derived from the diastereoisomeric mixture of 13, dr = 1.5:1). Compound 16b and 16d showed 50% inhibition at 400 \u03bcM and 16d showed weak inhibition even at 1600 \u03bcM. In spite of these vague results, they strongly suggest that the octahydroisochromene ring functions as a novel hydrophobic scaffold in the SARS 3CL pro inhibitor. It was also expected that a medium size linear alkyl group at the 1-position, such as n-butyl in 16a, can interact with SARS 3CL pro at a specific site, but bulkier substituents such as the branched group in 16c or planar groups in 16b and 16d exhibit less interactions.\n\nThe IC 50 values observed for the diastereoisomerically pure (3a-d) ranged from 95 to 780 \u03bcM, a rather wide range, which clearly indicates the steric effect of the octahydroisochromene scaffold on the inhibitory activity (Table 3) . Compound 3b was most active (IC 50 = 95 \u03bcM) and had a (1S, 3S)-configuration in the ring system. Compound 3c was the least active (IC 50 = 780 \u03bcM) with an enantiomeric (1R, 3R)-configuration when compared to 3b. The results suggest that converting the stereocenter at the 1-position has a more significant effect on the inhibitory activity than changing the stereochemistry at the 3-position.\n\nThe interactions between compounds 3a-d and R188I SARS 3CL pro were proposed using a docking model constructed with Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) software. The fused-ring system containing the aldehyde warhead of the decahydroisoquinoline inhibitor complexed with the protease (PDB: 4TWW) 11 was used as a template for the docking model. The docking scores obtained for inhibitors 3a, 3b, and 3d were similar (3a, -8.3615 kcal/mol; 3b, -8.3982 kcal/mol; 3d, -8.4354 kcal/mol), whereas the docking score for 3c was rather low (-7.9265 kcal/mol). The docking mode for 3b (IC 50 = 95 \u03bcM) showed nearly the same interactions with the protease as the parent decahydroisoquinoline inhibitor at its P1 site imidazole as well as those at the P2 site fused-ring system (Fig. 3a) . The warhead aldehyde was also directed toward the active center of the protease, as-observed in the case of the decahydroisoquinolin inhibitor (Fig. 3a ). In addition, the nbutyl substituent at the 1-position of the octahydroisochromene scaffold in 3b was assumed to be situated on the surface of the protease near the S1\u2032 to S2\u2032 pockets (Fig. 3b) . In contrast, the docking mode for less potent inhibitor 3c (IC 50 = 780 \u03bcM) showed different interactions at the P1 site imidazole and aldehyde warhead at the active center of the protease, although the interactions with the fused-ring system were expected to be similar to 3b (Fig. 3c ). The interactions with the n-butyl substituent at the 1-position of the octahydroisochromene scaffold in 3c were different from those of inhibitor 3b. The different modes of interaction observed for 3b and 3c were derived from the change in the configuration of the octahydroisochromene scaffold, which caused an 88% decrease in the inhibitory activity. To confirm the estimated interactions, X-ray crystallographic analysis of 3b complexed with R188I SARS 3CL pro is now underway in our laboratory.\n\nAs an alternative non-peptide scaffold to decahydroisoquinoline 11, 12 , using an octahydroisochromen scaffold has been introduced into a fused-ring type SARS 3CL protease inhibitor as a novel hydrophobic core to interact with the S2 pocket of the protease. Alkyl and aryl substituents were also introduced to the 1-position of the octahydroisochromene scaffold to form additional interactions with the protease. Sharpless-Katsuki asymmetric epoxidation and Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation reaction were used to construct the four possible diastereoisomers of the octahydroisochromene scaffold by selecting the appropriate chiral ligand in each asymmetric reaction. The purity and stereochemistry of the synthesized key intermediate 13 were confirmed using 1 H NMR, NOE, and 13 C NMR spectroscopy. Introductions of the P1 site His-al and substituent at the 1-position was achieved using successive reductive amination reactions.\n\nInhibitor 16a was prepared as a diastereo-isomeric mixture derived from the Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation reaction and showed moderate inhibitory activity toward R188I SARS 3CL pro . In contrast, the diastereoisomeric mixtures of 16b, 16c and 16d, which contain bulky or planar substituents at the 1-position, showed lower inhibitory activity. These results strongly suggested the functionality of the octahydroisochromene as a core hydrophobic scaffold for the S2 pocket of the protease and the additional interactions formed between the 1-position of the scaffold when the substituent is a linear alkyl group of moderate size. Based on these positive findings, the effects of the stereochemistry of the octahydroisochromene scaffold were examined and the results suggest that a specific configuration of the octahydroisochromene, (1S, 3S) 3b, directed the P1 site imidazole and the warhead aldehyde to their counterpart pockets in the protease. In addition, the n-butyl substituent at 1-position of the fused-ring system in 3b was also expected to form some interactions with the protease. In contrast, these functional groups in the enantiomeric octahydroisochromene inhibitor, (1R, 3R) 3c, were probably misdirected causing an 88% decrease in the inhibitory activity. Thus, detailed analysis of these interactions based on X-ray crystal analysis of 3b complexed with R188I SARS 3CL pro to optimize the substituent at the 1position as well as an alternative warhead group are ongoing in our laboratory. \n\nSilica gel 70PF 254 Plate-Wako was used for TLC and column chromatography was performed on Wakogel\u00ae 60 N (particle size, 63-212 \u03bcm) or Wakogel\u00ae C-300E (particle size, 45-75 \u03bcm).
