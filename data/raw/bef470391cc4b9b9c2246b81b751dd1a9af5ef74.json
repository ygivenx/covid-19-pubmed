{"title": "Natural Infection with the Porcine Respiratory Coronavirus Induces Protective Lactogenic Immunity against Transmissible Gastroenteritis", "body": "The gut epithelium of the newborn piglet is the main target of the transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) coronavirus (TGEV) which is therefore a specific enteropathogenic virus (Haelterman, 1972) . The tonsils and respiratory tract are considered as secondary targets (Kemeny et al., 1975; Kemeny and Woods, 1977; Furuuchi et al., 1979) and respiratory disorders caused by TGEV are unknown. Since 1984, TGEV seroconversion has been observed in the swine population of different European countries in the absence of any clinical disease. These countries include Belgium (Pensaert et al., 1986) , Denmark (P. Have, personal communication, 1987), France (Jestin et al., 1987) and England (Brown and Cartwright, 1986) . A porcine respiratory, non-enteric coronavirus related to TGEV was isolated in Belgium (Pensaert et al., 1986 ), in Denmark (P. Have, personal communication, 1987 , in England (Garwes et al., 1988) and in France (Duret et al., 1988) . This porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) induces a serological response that cannot be distinguished from that of TGEV-infected pigs by seroneutralization test in cell culture. PRCV and TGEV show a close antigenic relationship and can be distinguished from each other only by use of appropriate monoclonal antibodies (Garwes et al., 1988; Laude, 1988) . This shows that several epitopes located in the C and D domains of gpE2 of TGEV are absent on the gpE2 of PRCV (Laude, 1988) . Our objective was to evaluate the degree of passive protection against experimental TGE challenge exposure among 57 piglets nursing from seven seropositive sows from two herds which had been infected by PRCV > 1 year ago.\n\nThe McClurkin swine testicle (ST) cell line was used for virus titration (plaque assay under agarose) and seroneutralization tests. RP-D is a pig kidney cell line previously described by Laude et al. (1981) and used for the preparation of Purdue-115 and Nouzilly virus stocks.\n\nThe highly virulent Gep-II strain of TGEV is an isolate from an acute outbreak of TGE among swine in France (Aynaud et al., 1985 ) . A virulent virus stock (106 LDso ml-1 ) was prepared from the contents of the small intestine of colostrum-deprived newborn piglets inoculated with Gep-II strain and harvested 24 h post-inoculation. The virus stock was shown to be free of rotavirus by a virus enzyme-linked cell immunoassay (VELCIA) (Grom and Bernard, 1985 ) . The Nouzilly strain is an attenuated mutant of TGEV obtained in our laboratory by serial cycles of survivor selection in the gastric juice of adult pigs. The properties of the Nouzilly strain were described previously (188-SG strain) (Aynaud et al., 1985; Nguyen et al., 1987) . The high-passage Purdue-115 strain of TGEV was used for neutralizing antibody titration.\n\nEighteen pregnant sows used in this study were either Large Whites or Meishans. Seven seropositive sows were obtained from two herds which had seroconverted against PRCV > 1 year ago without TGE symptoms (Szymansky, unpublished results, 1988) . Eleven seronegative sows were obtained from a herd free of TGE and PRCV. Each group of sows was housed in isolated units (Nouzilly) before and after parturition.\n\nFifteen milliliters of Nouzilly virus-infected RP-D cell supernatant (5 \u00d7 106 plaque-forming units ml-1 ), diluted in 300 ml of McIlvaine's buffer (0.025 M, pH 4.0) were administered per os to fasting sows (no food or water during 24 h prior to vaccination). A first virus dose was administered 42-49 days before parturition and a second virus dose (booster) was administered 7-15 days before farrowing.\n\nWhen they were 2-17 days old, suckling piglets were challenged with the Gep-II strain by oral administration of 1 ml containing 1000 LDso. Clinical signs and mortality rate were scored during the 15 days post-exposure. Neutralizing antibody response in serum and delipidated milk were examined using a microneutralization test in ST cells as previously described (Toma and Benet, 1976) . Litters were considered to be protected if < 30% of the piglets died.\n\nThe monoclonal antibody (MAb) E4 was kindly provided by Dr. N. Juntti, SVA, Biomedicum, Uppsala, Sweden. The MAb 44-4 was kindly provided by Dr. H. Laude, INRA, 78350 Jouy-en-Josas, France (Delmas et al., 1986) ; it neutralizes TGEV and reacts by indirect immunofluorescence with TGEV antigens, but not with PRCV. MAb 44-4 is used as a representative reagent for enteric TGE viruses. MAb E4 strongly neutralizes both TGEV and PRCV, and is used as a representative of a common epitope located in the A domain (Delmas et al., 1986) of the peplomer glycoprotein E2. A blocking ELISA was developed in Lindholm using pelleted Purdue-115 virus as an antigen. Virus was adsorbed directly onto the plates followed by overnight incubation with dilutions of test sera in PBS-Tween 20. The tests were completed using successively a predetermined dilution of monoclonal antibody and peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG. Titers were calculated by interpolation as the dilution giving 50% inhibition (E4) or 25% inhibition (44-4) compared with a negative reference. A 50% cut-off level was selected for the E4 test on the basis of a statistical analysis of results obtained by examining 748 TGEVseronegative samples. These samples showed, on average, 0% inhibition with a standard deviation of + 11% inhibition. Thus, the 50% cut-off level allows for a very specific test while maintaining a sensitivity that is, on average, four times higher than the neutralization test for serum samples (data not shown). The 25% cut-off level for the 44-4 test was chosen primarily to obtain a reasonable test sensitivity. On the basis of statistical analysis of 197 PRCV antibody-positive samples the 44-4 test showed, on average, 9% inhibition with a standard deviation of + 10%. With a cut-off level of 25%, this would correspond to a probability of getting a false-positive sample of P=0.05 (one-sided test).\n\nThe results are presented in Table 1 . All 57 piglets nursed by the seven PRCVinfected sows were challenge exposed to virulent TGEV when 6-10 days old. All litters, except 30 and 232, developed diarrhea, but variable degrees of disease were observed. Mild and delayed clinical signs were observed in litters from Sows 44, 113 and 913. In contrast, acute symptoms of typical TGE (vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration) were observed in Litters 87 and 111. Five sows out of seven protected their piglets resulting in a mortality rate of 44% within 10 days after challenge exposure.\n\nAll piglets nursing from seven susceptible seronegative sows developed acute TGE resulting in a mortality rate of 91%. Although most piglets nursed by four sows orally immunized with the attenuated Nouzilly strain of TGEV developed diarrhea, two litters out of four were protected resulting in a mortality of 40%.\n\nThe results are presented in Table 2 . At challenge exposure, antibody was detected in serum and milk samples of all infected or vaccinated sows (except PRCV-infected Sow 111 ) but not in those from seven control sows. Whatever the immunization procedure no correlation was seen between antibody level and degree of passive protection transmitted to suckling piglets (correlation coefficient, rZ=O.154 for serum and r2=0.096 for milk, P>0.05). All seven PRCV-infected sows were seropositive 204 and 64 days before challenge exposure (data not shown). Using the seroneutralization test, it was not possible to distinguish the serological response of TGE-vaccinated sows from that of PRCV-infected sows.\n\nThe results are presented in Table 2 . At challenge exposure, serum and milk samples of all but one PRCV-infected sow were positive for antibodies specific for E4 epitope and negative for 44-4.\n\nIn contrast, serum and milk samples of all four TGEV-vaccinated sows contained antibodies specific for E4 and 44-4 epitopes. Ten days after challenge exposure, 44-4 antibodies are detected in four (44, 111, 232, 913) out of seven PRCV-infected sows (data not shown).\n\nUsing a blocking ELISA with two appropriate MAbs, we demonstrated that seven seropositive sows from naturally infected herds developed an antibody response specific for PRCV. This is based on recent data from H. Laude concerning the molecular antigenic characterization of PRCV isolates (Laude, 1988) . Serological differentiation between PRCV and TGEV infection is clearly possible using these monoclonal antibodies (P. Have, unpublished results, 1987; Garwes et al., 1988; Caillebaut et al., 1988) .\n\nOur results show that natural infection with PRCV induces protective lactogenic immunity against TGE. However, protection was not complete in that only two litters out of seven did not show morbidity after challenge exposure, and five out of seven sows had protected their litters. This level was comparable with that of sows vaccinated with the Nouzilly strain, and contrasts with the absence of protection by all the seronegative sows. The age of litters at challenge could be a relevant factor. Age-related resistance to TGEV is well documented and the choice of a highly virulent TGEV for challenge of litters is crucial. We rejected the Miller strain because of its moderate pathogenicity. The mortality rate observed with the Miller strain by Moxley (Moxley, 1983) and by us does not exceed 60-70% (data not shown). In contrast, with the Gep-II strain, most (91%) of the 2-to 17-day-old control piglets died. In this experiment, it is not possible to show any difference by ANOVA analysis between age average of the three groups (F2.,5 = 0.549, P = 0.62). In contrast, the difference in the average mortality is highly significant (F2.15 = 5.047, P = 0.02 ).\n\nAll PRCV-infected sows (except Sow 111) and all TGEV-immunized sows had antibody in serum and milk whatever the degree of passive protection that was transmitted to suckling piglets. Ten days after challenge, all TGEV-immunized sows showed an anamnestic neutralizing antibody response in serum and milk. An anamnestic antibody response specifically of E4 epitope was detectable in sera of all seven PRCV-infected sows. Hooyberghs et al. (1988) found conflicting evidence that sows naturally infected with PRCV may not adequately protect their litters against natural TGE challenge in the field. This discrepancy could be explained by the conditions used for evaluation of protective immunity. In our case, a standardized challenge with a highly virulent strain of TGEV was carried out under experimental conditions among sows of different but known immune status. During natural TGE outbreaks, the occurrence of other enteropathogens, known for their ability to enhance the pathogenicity of TGEV (E. coli, Rotavirus, Coccidia), cannot be excluded. It is interesting to observe that a decrease of clinical TGE in Europe has been concomitant with development of PRCV seroconversion in the swine population. This feature can be considered as an argument in favor of cross-protection between TGEV and PRCV.\n\nOur results show evidence of cross-protection between PRCV and TGEV, but further investigations are needed to check if TGEV vaccination or TGEV infection protects swine against respiratory infection caused by PRCV. If such complete cross-protection is confirmed, PRCV infection could be considered as an interesting and valuable experimental model to elucidate the mechanism of immunological link between the lung and the mammary gland in the sow."}
