{"title": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease is rare in children: An update from Saudi Arabia", "body": "Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first isolated in 2012 from a patient in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA)[1]. As more cases were reported, the case fatality rate changed to 40% from 60%[2-5]. In addition, initially there was a predominance of males; later this ratio decreased[2,6]. MERS-CoV is characterized by three different patterns of disease: Sporadic cases, intra-familial transmission[7-9] and health care associated infection[2,3,10-16]. Despite the increased number overtime and the multiple health care associated outbreaks[17], the number of pediatric cases remained low during the study period[18]. The initial description of 47 cases included only a 14-year-old child[4]. The first pediatric case was a 2-year-old child reported from Jeddah, KSA on June 28, 2013[19]. Later an additional three asymptomatic children were reported[4]. The largest report of childhood MERS-CoV cases included eleven, of which two patients were symptomatic and nine were asymptomatic[18]. The exact reason for this low prevalence of the disease in children is not known. In this study, we summarize the reported MERS-CoV cases and the associated clinical presentation and the outcome.\n\nRelevant data were placed into an excel sheet and analyzed accordingly. Descriptive analytic statistics were used in the final analysis as deemed necessary, including mean and standard deviation when applicable and frequency. The statistical review of the study was performed by a biomedical statistician. Statistical review is performed before the submission of the manuscript.\n\nFrom June 2012, to April 19, 2016, there were a total of 31 pediatric MERS-CoV cases as shown in Table 1. Of all the cases, thirteen (13) or 42% were asymptomatic, and there were 17 males, 10 females and 4 unreported (a male to female ratio of 1.7:1). The mean age of patients was 9.8 + 5.4 (0.75-17) years. Twenty-five cases (80.6%) were reported from KSA; the other patients were in Jordan, United Arab Emirates and the Republic of Korea (Table 1). The most common source of the infection was household contact (10 of 15 with reported source), and 5 patients acquired the infection within a health care facility. About one half of the cases were reported in 2014, and 29% were reported in 2013 and 22.6% in 2015 (Table 2).\n\nScreening of pediatric patients for MERS-CoV infection using real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction showed that only 9 out of 552 (1.6%) were positive in KSA[23]. However, serologic testing of pediatric patients admitted with lower respiratory tract infection in Jordan and Saudi Arabia revealed no positive tests[24,25] (Table 3).\n\nThe effect of MERS-CoV infection on the fetus was described in eight cases[26-29] as summarized in Table 4. The mean age of the mothers was 32.25 + 3.4 years, and the mean gestational age was 28.4 + 6.3 wk. Death of the fetus was observed in 3 (37.5%) of the 8 fetuses.\n\nDespite the total number of MERS cases increasing, especially in KSA, the number of pediatric cases remained low during the study period. Initially, the testing in KSA was directed towards hospitalized patients with severe pneumonia. In 2015, the Saudi Ministry of Health added a specific case definition for MERS-CoV infection in children[30]. The definition includes those \u2264 14 years, meets the adult case definition and has either a history of exposure to a confirmed or suspected MERS-CoV in the proceeding 14 d or a history of contact with camels or camel products in the proceeding 14 d[30]. The case definition also includes children with unexplained severe pneumonia[30]. The 2015 change in the case definition does not account for the low rate of childhood MERS-CoV infection as 33% of the cases were reported in 2014 before the case definition was changed. One of the reasons for an increased number of cases in 2014 during the Jeddah outbreak was increased testing of asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patients[11].\n\nThe pattern of MERS-CoV pediatric cases was similar to the 2003 SARS outbreak. Children were less affected than adults and children less than 2 years of age had milder disease[31]. In the largest screening of contacts, the rate of MERS-CoV positive children (1.6%, 9/616) compared to 2.2% (99/4440) in adults (P = 0.23)[23]. Thus, in this study utilizing MERS-CoV PCR the positivity rate did not differ in children and adults.\n\nIn adults with MERS-CoV infections, three patterns of transmissions were observed: Sporadic (primary) cases presumed to be due to animal exposure (mainly camels), household contacts or health care associated infections[32]. In KSA, the majority (45%) of cases were health care-associated infections, 38% were primary cases, and 13% were household contacts[32]. In contrast, in the majority of pediatric cases that reported source of acquisition (66.7% of the 15 with reported source), the disease was acquired through household contact. This pattern indicates a low exposure of children to animals and a higher rate of health care associated infections in adult wards. The male to female ratio (2.8:1 and 3.3:1) was initially high[3,4]. This apparent male predominance could be explained by the nature of hospital outbreaks[2]. Eventually the male to female ratio was reduced to 1.3:1 to 1.8:1[5,6]. Consistent with these studies, the male to female ratio in children with MERS-CoV was 1.7:1 and may indicate similar exposure of children to index cases in the household settings and differential host factors.\n\nPossible explanations for the lower number of pediatric cases compared to adults include differential testing of adult patients and milder diseases in children; although, serologic testing of pediatric patients in KSA and Jordan did not reveal any positive cases[24,25]. In the largest sero-epidemiologic survey in KSA, the study did not include children and thus it is difficult to establish the rate of sero-positivity in children[31].\n\nThe MERS-CoV infection rate in children remains low and possible explanations include: A milder disease in children, asymptomatic infection, or the presence of yet to be identified factors. The development of a shorter duration of MERS in children is another possible explanation. If this is the case, it may limit the development of a positive serology. In one study, delayed antibody responses as measured with the neutralization test was associated with severe diseases[33]. The longevity of antibodies in MERS-CoV cases might be limited as was the case with SARS[33,34]. The only study of serology among children was done among hospitalized pediatric cases who presented with lower respiratory tract infections[25]. There is no systematic screening of exposed children using serologic testing; this limited the interpretation of available serologic studies.\n\nLittle data also exist regarding the effect and the likelihood of MERS-CoV in pregnancy. Eight cases were reported[26,27,29]. The outcome was favorable in the majority of cases. The exact prevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies and exposure of pregnant women to MERS-CoV is not known.\n\nIn conclusion, the number of MERS-CoV infections in pediatric patients remains low. Possible explanations include low exposure, presence of asymptomatic, mildly symptomatic patients or the presence of yet to be identified factors. The immune system predisposing to severe disease and to fatal outcome remains unknown. An exploration of the virus-host interaction may add to the understanding of the low prevalence in this age group.\n\nMiddle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first isolated in 2012 from a patient in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA).
