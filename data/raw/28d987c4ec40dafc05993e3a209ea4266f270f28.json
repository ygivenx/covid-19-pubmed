{"title": "SUPPLEMENTAL TEXT MATERIALS AND METHODS", "body": "MAKER. Gene models were first predicted using the program's est2genome prediction model. Gene models and HMM profiles were then refined seven times through iterative MAKER runs using the same physical evidence as above. Output from this final iteration of SNAP predictions, as well as the predictions from the self-trained Genemark-ES and Augustus were then combined using the tool EVM. EVM also utilized RNAseq evidence aligned against the S. neurona genome using Tophat and cufflinks. Protein and EST alignments were also provided using exonerate according to parameters specificied by EVM. An assembled alignment of cufflinks transcripts and EST transcripts from S. neurona was also provided by PASA using default parameters.\n\nEVM was found to predict fewer, high-quality genes than MAKER, which was found to output more apparently spurious gene models. EVM gene models were therefore used in any case that the gene models were predicted in any range overlapping or separate from genes predicted by MAKER. MAKER annotations are associated with an \"edit score\" ranging from 0 to 1 and defining the perceived distance between predicted gene models and physical evidence. In cases where MAKER predicted gene models in regions of the genome with zero overlap with any EVM gene predictions, the gene predictions were retained in the final set of predicted genes only if the AED score was less than 0.1 or when the AED score was below 0.5 and the identified protein was homologous to a T. gondii gene (BLASTP e-value less than 1e- 20) or contained a PFAM protein domain (18) .\n\nThe apicoplast genome was first sequenced and assembled from S. neurona (strain SN3) merozoites maintained in bovine turbinate cell monolayers. Paired-end libraries of 3 and 8 Kbp were generated using the GS FLX titanium rapid library and paired end adaptor kit. Sequences generated from a Roche GS FLX genome sequencer were assembled using Newbler version 2.5.3 (454 Life Sciences, Roche Applied Science, Branford, CT) with the -large parameter turned off. All other parameters were set to default. In order to identify the apicoplast genome, candidate scaffolds were screened by length 25-35 Kbp and tRNA content as identified by tRNAscan-SE (19) . We identified a single scaffold of size 34,488 composed of two contigs one of length 5,780 bp and the other 24,002 bp joined by a paired-end read creating a gap of 4,706 bp. Comparison of the two contigs against Toxoplasma gondii's apicoplast genome with BLAST revealed that the smaller contig was part of the inverted repeat (IR) but at roughly half the size. The remaining contig was identified as the other section of the apicoplast genome. The average coverage of the smaller contig (502.8X) was roughly more than twice the coverage of the larger contig (192.5X) indicating the IR had collapsed during assembly. Gene model predictions and annotation was performed using programs MAKER (14) , and Apollo (20), tRNAscan-SE (18) and ARAGORN (21) . MAKER was used to scan the apicoplast genome against all apicoplast-encoded protein sequences from P. falciparum, T. gondii and E. tenella obtained from PlasmoDB (22) , ToxoDB (23) and Genbank (NC_004823.1) respectively. Output from MAKER was loaded into Apollo where coding regions were visualized and aligned to UAA or UAG stop codons and ATG start codons. Hypothetical protein sequences were manually curated to account for alternative codon usage. SSUrRNA and LSUrRNA were found by comparisons to T. gondii via BLASTN. tRNAs were found by tRNAscan-SE server using default parameters for a Mito/Chloroplast source (http://lowelab.ucsc.edu/tRNAscan-SE/). The tRNA-Leu in the region after rps4 was found by tRNAscan-SE with search mode: Cove only. tRNAs were further confirmed by the program ARAGORN using default parameters. Mapping of S. neurona SO SN1 reads to the SN3 reference apicoplast sequence was performed with the GATK pipeline (24) .\n\nTo obtain a prediction of the SRS complement for S. neurona gene models were scanned against 8 SRS family domains using HMMER3's hmmscan tool (25) and HMM files generated previously (26) . HMM alignments were required to be contiguous and over 100 amino acids in length, i-evalue < 0.001 and at least 4 cysteine residues were required over the length of the alignment. Domain families were assigned according to the maximum domain score. To predict orthologs to genes from other apicomplexan species we applied the InParanoid pipeline (27) . Metabolic genes were annotated using an inhouse pipeline based on the DETECT enzyme prediction tool (28) as described previously (29) . MCSCAN (30) was used to identify syntenic genes, requiring blocks of 3 collinear genes and using an intergenic space of 25,000 bp. Base pair separation was defined as a distance metric. Custom python scripts were then used to export identified links to the genome visualization tool, Circos (31) .\n\nFor a list of manually curated invasion-related genes for T. gondii, we calculated pairwise Pearson correlation coefficients from gene expression data derived from two previously published experiments (32, 33) . The first examined gene expression profiles of both tachyzoites and bradyzoites, involving 9 conditions; GEO accession GSE16037. The second was an expression study of the T. gondii cell cycle, involving 13 time points -0 to 12 hours post synchronization; GEO accession GSE19092. A network was then generated in which nodes represent genes and links between nodes indicate significant co-expression (Pearson correlation coefficient > 0.8). Network statistics were calculated using NetworkX (34) . The network was visualised using Cytoscape (35) .\n\nThe structural models for SnAMA1a (Ser2 -Ser358; SRCN_465) and SnAMA1b (Ser396 -Cys787; SRCN_461) were generated using Phyre2 (36) in intensive mode based off of a TgAMA1 (PDB ID 2X2Z) model (49 and 44% sequence identity with SnAMA1a and SnAMA1b, respectively), and manually edited in Coot (37) . For the complex with SnRON2D3, the region of the SnAMA1a DII loop (His273 -Ala294) corresponding to the region disordered in the TgAMA1 co-structure with a synthetic peptide of TgRON2D3 (TgRON2sp) was removed due to uncertainty in its position while in complex with SnRON2D3. The core 30 residues of SnRON2D3 (His788 to Ile815; SRCN_785) were modelled based on TgRON2sp from the published co-structure with TgAMA1 (38) . The SnAMA1a-SnRON2D3 model was refined using Rosetta FlexPepDock (39) with the complex showing the lowest Rosetta energy score chosen and analyzed by visual inspection, PISA (40), ProQ (41), ERRAT (42) , and MolProbity (43) .\n\nA set of ROP kinase proteins, assigned to individual ROPK subfamilies was obtained for T. gondii ME49, N. caninum NC1 and E. tenella (44) . Outliers consisting of shorter sequences and missing key motifs of protein kinase domain were discarded. A global alignment of the kinase domains of these proteins together with the set of S. neurona SO SN1 predicted ROP kinases was then generated using probcons v1.12 (45) and manually edited. TrimAl (46) was used to automatically remove columns of the alignments with a gap threshold of 0.7. A maximum likelihood (ML) phylogeny was reconstructed using PhyML (47) with 1,024 bootstrap replicates using LG substitution model and combined with a Bayesian phylogeny (MrBayes 3.1.2, (48)), using four Markov chains for 4 million generations with a burnin of 25%, using the mixed substitution model and gamma distribution for rate heterogenity. The less paraphyletic MrBayes tree was chosen as the main tree.\n\nTotal RNA (2 \u00b5g) was isolated from merozoites using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) and reverse transcribed using random primers and SuperScript II (Invitrogen). Gene expression was measured by Taqman qPCR using an Applied Biosystems 7900HT Real-Time PCR System. Primer and probe sets are provided in Table S4 (see supplemental material). The cycling program included 2 min at 50\u00b0C, 10 min incubation at 95\u00b0C followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s and 60\u00b0C for 1 min. Sarcocystis GAPDH1, ACT1, TUBA1 and EF1 were used as reference genes to normalize the quantity of transcripts (50) . Transcript levels were represented as 2 \u2212\u0394CT to show absolute levels of transcript relative to every gene examined.\n\nA genome scale metabolic reconstruction for S. neurona was initially constructed based on a previous model for T. gondii -iCS382 (51) . This reconstruction was supplemented with enzyme predictions obtained using the DETECT algorithm (28) , those supported by both BLAST and PRIAM evidence as we have done previously (39) , as well as InParanoid defined orthologs of previously curated T. gondii enzymes (27) . Non-essential enzymes with gene assignments in T. gondii but lacking orthologs in S. neurona were removed from the reconstruction. Of the 42 reactions unique to T. gondii, 18 were captured in iCS382 of which 9 were found to be essential and therefore included in the S. neurona reconstruction. The reconstruction is maintained as a spreadsheet (see Table S5 in the supplemental material) in a standard format (51) . Flux balance analysis (FBA) was performed using the COBRA Toolbox (version 1.3.4) in MATLAB (52) . As previous, each reaction in the model is supplied upper and lower constraints for its flux (for reversible reactions -1000 to 1000 mmol/gDWh; for irreversible reactions 0-1000 mmol/gDWh). In addition, for reactions with single-gene associations, constraints were included in the model based on a previously published set of RNA Seq data for 5 day T. gondii (53) as well as our own RNA Seq dataset generated for S. neurona. Each reaction receiving a flux constraint based on its associated gene expression relative to the highest gene expression value in the data set and scaled linearly so that the predicted doubling time for T. gondii matched the in vivo observation of 11.8 h (54). Single knockouts were simulated for each reaction in the model by setting the constraints of the reaction to 0. Knockout effects were assessed by computing a growth ratio, which is the biomass production rate of the knockout divided by that of the wild type.\n\nWe identified 13 enzymes in the S. neurona genome which have not previously been reported in T. gondii, which all appear expressed in the merozoite stage, include 3-hydroxyacyl-ACP-dehydratase (EC \n\nAn intriguing finding in our annotation efforts was the prediction of an alpha-glucosidase (EC:3.2.1.20) which has the capability of hydrolysing terminal, non-reducing (1->4)-linked alpha-D-glucose residues. While subsequent investigations reveal the presence of orthologs in T. gondii, N. caninum and E. tenella, we note that there is confusion in their current annotations. For example, the T. gondii homolog (TGME49_253030) is annotated in the ToxoDB resource with both alpha-glucosidase and glucan 1,3-alpha-glucosidase (EC:3.2.1.84) activities. Phylogenetic analyses reveal the coccidian homologs to partition with a clade of apparent glucan 1,3-alpha-glucosidases ( Figure S5 in the supplemental material). However, within this clade is a protein with experimentally confirmed evidence for alpha-glucosidase activity, while all proteins annotated with glucan 1,3-alpha-glucosidase activity were through less robust electronic annotations. Furthermore, glucan 1,3-alpha-glucosidase activity is performed by a heterodimer in which the alpha subunit performs the catalytic reaction, while the beta subunit is involved in substrate specificity and targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum. While homologs of the alpha subunit were identified in the coccidian and cryptosporidium lineages, we found no evidence for a homolog of the beta subunit in any apicomplexan genome. Further, most of the apicomplexan homologs contain an N-terminal region conserved in parts and interspersed with species-specific insertions and deletions. Together these findings suggest the apicomplexan proteins possess alpha-glucosidase activity, supporting the potential to exploit alternative carbon sources such as maltose, glycogen and sucrose. Since the conversion of sucrose by alphaglucosidase to fructose and glucose provide additional functionality to our metabolic reconstruction, we performed an in silico investigation to examine its potential impact on growth.\n\nNew reactions added to iCS382 to simulate T. gondii growth:\n\nAlpha-glucosidase activity was added (EC:3.2.1.20; R00801), and an additional activity for hexokinase was described for the phosphorylation of fructose using ATP (EC:2.7. 1.1; R00760) . Moreover, fructose and sucrose transport (accompanied by ATP hydrolysis) were added. An artificial diffusion reaction was added for 2-oxobutanoate, originally a deadend metabolite, so as to allow its movement in and out of the system; this reaction was principally added because it was added to the S. neurona model.\n\nIn addition to the reactions to simulate T. gondii growth, two reactions catalysed by EC:4.3.1.19 were added: L-threonine ammonia-lyase (R00996) and L-serine ammonia-lyase activities (R00220). The artificial diffusion reaction for 2-oxobutanoate was added so as to unblock the reaction for L-threonine ammonia-lyase activity which produces 2-oxobutanoate. As per the principle of conservation of mass, if 2-oxobutanoate remained unutilized in the system (therefore a deadend), any reaction producing the metabolite would be blocked, or unusable. Furthermore, the following nine reactions were retained in the T. gondii model, but removed in the S. neurona model due to a lack of genetic evidence:\n\n(i) 1.

The cycling conditions included an initial denaturation at 95 o C for 3 min 35 cycles of denaturation at 95 o C for 30sec, annealing as shown in the table and extension at 68 o C for 1min, followed by a final extension at 68oC for 2min. The amplified PCR products were analyzed on 1.5% agarose gels. The 635bp product amplified using primer pair F1-R3 was purified using a PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and was sequenced in both directions at Advanced Genetic Technologies Center, University of Kentucky. (C) Electrophoretic analysis of rps4 fragment insert PCR reactions PCR product sequence confirms the presence the rps4 fragment insert. Multiple sequence alignment of the sequence from the PCR products, the fragment insert and the original gene show no mutations of the rps4 gene fragment insert from the original gene suggesting it is a relatively recent event ( Figure S2 ).\n\nThe multiple sequence alignment is composed of 4 sequences: the rps4 gene, the rps4 fragment insert, and the sequence from each strand of the 635 bp PCR product.
