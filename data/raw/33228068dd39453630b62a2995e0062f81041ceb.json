{"title": "Type I Interferon Signaling Disrupts the Hepatic Urea Cycle and Alters Systemic Metabolism to Suppress T Cell Function In Brief Article Type I Interferon Signaling Disrupts the Hepatic Urea Cycle and Alters Systemic Metabolism to Suppress T Cell Function", "body": "The liver is a central regulator of metabolism, but how infection-induced changes in liver metabolism affect immune responses and pathology remains enigmatic. Lercher et al. demonstrate that hepatocyte-intrinsic type I interferon (IFN-I) represses metabolism during chronic viral infection. Specifically, IFN-I disrupts the urea cycle in hepatocytes, altering serum arginine and ornithine levels, which dampen antiviral T cells responses and liver pathology.\n\nInfections induce complex host responses linked to antiviral defense, inflammation, and tissue damage and repair. We hypothesized that the liver, as a central metabolic hub, may orchestrate systemic metabolic changes during infection. We infected mice with chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), performed RNA sequencing and proteomics of liver tissue, and integrated these data with serum metabolomics at different infection phases. Widespread reprogramming of liver metabolism occurred early after infection, correlating with type I interferon (IFN-I) responses. Viral infection induced metabolic alterations of the liver that depended on the interferon alpha/beta receptor (IFNAR1). Hepatocyte-intrinsic IFNAR1 repressed the transcription of metabolic genes, including Otc and Ass1, which encode urea cycle enzymes. This led to decreased arginine and increased ornithine concentrations in the circulation, resulting in suppressed virus-specific CD8 + T cell responses and ameliorated liver pathology. These findings establish IFN-I-induced modulation of hepatic metabolism and the urea cycle as an endogenous mechanism of immunoregulation.\n\nPathogens and concurrent tissue damage elicit complex context-dependent inflammatory response programs (Hotamisligil, 2017) . Chronic infections represent a particular challenge for the host organism, which is exposed to prolonged inflammation that may predispose to various co-morbidities, such as susceptibility to secondary infections and cancer (Okin and Medzhitov, 2012; Rehermann and Nascimbeni, 2005; Virgin et al., 2009) . The same inflammatory pathways can also control cellular tissue homeostasis and metabolism (Kotas and Medzhitov, 2015; Medzhitov, 2008; O'Neill and Pearce, 2016) . Different cell types and organs communicate with each other through soluble cytokines, thereby determining the quality, magnitude, and duration of both local and systemic immune responses (Medzhitov, 2008) . The liver is a central metabolic organ but also represents an immunoregulatory hub between blood-borne pathogens and the immune system (Jenne and Kubes, 2013; Protzer et al., 2012; Racanelli and Rehermann, 2006) . Hepatocytes are the functional unit of the liver parenchyma and the most abundant cell type of the liver. As such, their principal task is the turnover of metabolites during homeostasis. Yet they are also important immune signaling platforms that produce and react to a range of cytokines upon inflammation (Crispe, 2016; Racanelli and Rehermann, 2006; Zhou et al., 2016) . Hepatocytes themselves are permissible to a variety of chronic viruses, including hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) in humans and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) in mice (Guidotti et al., 1999; Rehermann and Nascimbeni, 2005) . The chronic infection model of LCMV represents a well-established and pathophysiologically relevant experimental model for the study of host-pathogen interactions and immune responses that induce a vigorous CD8 T-cell-dependent hepatitis (Zehn and Wherry, 2015; Zinkernagel et al., 1986) . The involved immunopathologic mechanisms seen in the LCMV model are similar to those observed in patients chronically infected with HBV or HCV (Guidotti et al., 1999; Rehermann and Nascimbeni, 2005) . Soluble inflammatory signals act mainly through cytokine receptors (Hotamisligil, 2017; Protzer et al., 2012; Racanelli and Rehermann, 2006) . Type I interferons (IFN-Is) are central antiviral cytokines that signal through the ubiquitously expressed IFNAR receptor, which is composed of the two subunits IFNAR1 and IFNAR2. This induces the expression of a broad array of genes described as interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). ISGs exert antiviral functions by direct interference with viral replication and immunoregulatory properties (McNab et al., 2015; Schoggins et al., 2011) . More recently, IFN-Is are also recognized as modulators of metabolism, such as cellular lipid metabolism and redox homeostasis Pantel et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2016; York et al., 2015) . Cytokine-induced regulation of liver metabolism is expected to result in altered metabolite turnover and release that impacts distal organs (van den Berghe, 1991; Norata et al., 2015) . Immune cells and in particular T cells critically depend on certain metabolites to efficiently perform their functions and are thus susceptible to altered metabolite availability (Chang et al., 2015; Geiger et al., 2016; Johnson et al., 2018; Pearce et al., 2009) . In line with this, a frequent immune evasion mechanism of cancer is the depletion of essential amino acids or glucose in the tumor microenvironment (Buck et al., 2017; Chang et al., 2015; Ma et al., 2017; Murray, 2016) .\n\nIn this study, we investigated the chronic infection model of LCMV using an unbiased integrative approach to unveil inflammation-driven endogenous regulation of liver metabolism and its impact on systemic immune responses and tissue pathology.\n\nWe infected C57BL/6J wild-type mice with 2 3 10 6 focus forming units (FFUs) of the chronic strain clone 13 of LCMV and quantified infectious virus particles and viral RNA in the liver ( Figure 1A ). This confirmed the peak of viral propagation around day 8 after infection with a subsequent decline of viral loads. Liver damage was assessed by the clinical hallmark parameters alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) that peaked on day 8-12 after infection ( Figure 1B) . In an unbiased approach to virus-induced changes in the liver, we collected liver tissue from infected mice at different phases of infection (day 2 z innate phase; day 8 z peak of disease; day 30 z chronic phase; day 60 z resolving phase) and performed transcriptome analyses by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). The transcriptomic data showed high intra-replica reproducibility and individual samples clustered according to the time course of infection (Figure 1C) , highlighting phase-specific changes in gene expression and the gradual recovery of mice by 60 days after infection. In total, 3,626 transcripts were differentially regulated (Table S1A ) and the most differentially expressed genes were found on days 2 and 8 after infection ( Figure S1A ). Hierarchical clustering identified three broad categories of gene expression programs, including transcripts that were found already regulated on day 2 (clusters 1-4) or induced on day 8 (clusters 5-10) as well as transcripts that were repressed during infection (clusters 11-15; Figure 1D ; Table S2A ). To corroborate transcriptional alterations, we performed tissue proteomics and quantified 5,586 proteins in the liver (Table S1B) . Protein changes correlated with differentially expressed transcripts (Figures 1E and S1B; Table S2C ). Of the identified clusters, differentially expressed genes associated with antiviral IFN-I signaling were found to be enriched on day 2 (clusters 1-4; Figure 1F ; Table S2B) although leukocyte-associated genes were mainly found on day 8 after infection (clusters 5-10; Figure 1F ; Table S2B ). Some of these differential expression changes are likely to reflect hepatic immune cell infiltration ( Figure S1C ).\n\nOur enrichment analyses indicated widespread metabolic reprogramming of liver tissue during LCMV infection ( Figure S1D ), with particularly pronounced effects seen for downregulated metabolic pathways relating to lipid and amino acid metabolism on days 2 and 8 after infection (clusters 11-15; Figure 1F ; Table  S2B ). This is in line with our recent study about the modulation of circulating lipids during acute LCMV infection (Kosack et al., 2017) . For an in-depth integration of these metabolic changes, we performed enrichment analyses of the union of differentially regulated transcripts and proteins at each stage of viral infection on Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) metabolic pathways. We identified global reprogramming of processes related to all the major classes of metabolites. Modulation of hepatic pathways involving lipids and essential amino acids was initiated on day 2 and peaking on day 8 after infection Symbols represent the arithmetic mean \u00b1 SEM; ns, not significant; *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001 (Student's t test). See also Figure S1.\n\n( Figure 1G ; Table S1C ). Differentially expressed metabolic processes were also found in the chronic and resolving phases of infection, although the number of modulated transcripts and proteins were lower (Figures 1G, S1A, and S1B).\n\nTo address the effects of virus-induced alterations on the metabolic output of the liver, we performed targeted metabolomics of serum, focusing on amino acids, biogenic amines, sphingolipids, acylcarnitines, and glycerophospholipids. We found 99 of 180 metabolites to be significantly regulated at one or more time points ( Figure 1H ; Table S3A ). Downregulation of metabolites on day 2 ( Figure S1E ) was observed for glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids ( Figure 1H ; clusters 1 and 3) although acylcarnitines ( Figure 1H ; cluster 4) were rather upregulated on day 8 after infection ( Figure 1H ). Systemic amino acids and biogenic amines exhibited a sustained decline from day 2 to day 8 and gradually recovered in the later phases of infection ( Figure 1H ; cluster 2). This affected almost exclusively essential and semi-essential proteinogenic amino acids (His, Ile, Leu, Met, Trp, Val, and Arg; Figure 1H ) and coincided with transcriptional regulation of amino-acid-related metabolic pathways on day 8 (Figures 1F-1H and S1F; Table S1C ). Together, our integrated transcriptomic and proteomic analysis linked changes in the liver with altered systemic metabolite levels during chronic viral infection.\n\nMice infected with LCMV strain clone 13 develop infection-associated cachexia (Baazim et al., 2019) and display reduced food intake ( Figure S2A) . We therefore performed a pair-feeding experiment to investigate the impact of infection-associated changes in food uptake to the metabolic reprogramming of the liver 8 days after infection. Uninfected mice received restricted amounts of food equivalent to the amounts consumed by infected mice. Subsequently, we collected liver tissue of infected, pair-fed, and naive animals and performed transcriptome analyses. These results indicated that most of the observed transcriptional changes were linked to viral infection and independent of anorexic behavior (Figures 2A, S2B , and S2C). Uninfected pair-fed mice showed only minor differential gene expression changes that pertained mainly to lipid metabolism (Figures 2B and 2C; Table S4 ). Together, these experiments demonstrated that the majority of the observed virus-induced metabolic changes in the liver, including amino-acid-related pathways, correlated with the infection status of the mice and were independent of altered food intake ( Figures 1H and 2D ).\n\nThe observed changes of hepatic amino acid metabolism became noticeable as early as 2 days, which coincides with peak serum levels of IFN-a and IFN-b in mice infected with LCMV . Thus, we aimed to dissect a potential role of early IFN-I signaling in the observed changes in the liver. To measure the impact of IFN-I signaling on liver parenchyma, we performed an extracellular metabolic flux analysis of primary murine hepatocytes upon stimulation with IFN-b in vitro. IFN-b affected proxies for mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis in an IFNAR1-dependent manner ( Figures 3A  and 3B ), indicating that IFN-I signaling affects metabolism of hepatocytes. To deconvolute tissue heterogeneity in vivo and to assess the contribution of IFN-I signaling to metabolic reprogramming in the liver, we took advantage of a genetic model of hepatocyte-specific ablation of Ifnar1 (Alb-Cre ERT2 Ifnar1 fl/fl [Ifnar1 D/D ]) and respective littermate controls (Alb-Cre ERT2 Ifnar1 +/+ [Ifnar1 +/+ ]). These mice did not reveal any genotypespecific differences in viremia or serum concentration of IFN-a 1.5 days after infection ( Figures S3A-S3C) , suggesting that any potential differences seen in expression profiling of liver tissue from Ifnar1 D/D versus Ifnar1 +/+ mice is unlikely to be due to altered viral loads and/or systemic IFN-I responses. Moreover, naive and infected Ifnar1 D/D versus Ifnar1 +/+ animals displayed comparable abundances of immune-cell-related transcripts, suggesting only minor differences of immune cell infiltration between the genotypes at this early time point after infection ( Figure S3D ). Next, we analyzed transcriptomic changes of liver tissue taken from uninfected and infected mice of either genotype at the peak of serum IFN-a levels and employed a limma (2 3 2 factorial) interaction model. This resulted in a set of 526 hepatocyte-intrinsic IFNAR1-regulated genes, which were found to be associated with both classical ISG responses as well as metabolic processes (Figures 3C, 3D, and S3E; Table S5A ). The regulated genes could be divided into two major classes-IFNAR1-stimulated (cluster 1) and IFNAR1-repressed (cluster 2) genes ( Figure 3C ; Table S5B ). The majority of induced genes were well-known classical ISGs encoding for antiviral effectors (cluster 1; Figure 3D ; Table S5C ; Schoggins et al., 2011) . Interferon-repressed genes (IRGs), which are not that well characterized (Mostafavi et al., 2016; Schoggins et al., 2011) , were found to be strongly enriched for metabolism-associated processes (cluster 2; Figure 3D ; Table S5C ). In addition, clusters 3 and 4 contained genes whose maintained expression depended on intact IFNAR1 signaling and were also associated with metabolic processes ( Figure 3D ; Table S5C ). Hepatocyte-intrinsic IFNAR1 signaling mainly regulated metabolic genes on day 2 after infection. Notably, a bioinformatic intersection with our longitudinal data obtained from chronically infected wild-type mice suggested that the IFN-I-dependent regulation of many of these genes is maintained beyond these early time points ( Figure 3E ). Specifically, virus-induced gene regulation of amino-acidrelated pathways (Figure 1 ) was driven by hepatocyte-intrinsic IFNAR1 signaling ( Figure 3E ) and corresponded with the differentially regulated metabolites observed in infected wild-type mice ( Figure 1H ). To investigate whether these metabolic changes depended on hepatocyte-intrinsic IFNAR1 signaling, we performed metabolomics and found that systemic serum levels were indeed regulated by local IFNAR1 signaling of hepatocytes ( Figure S3F ). In a more stringent analysis using the limma (2 3 2 factorial) interaction model, we found 15 serum metabolites to be regulated by hepatocyte-intrinsic IFNAR1 signaling, including the semi-essential amino acid arginine and its downstream metabolite ornithine ( Figure 3F ). In summary, our data indicate that hepatocyte-intrinsic IFNAR1 signaling acts as a transcriptional regulator of liver metabolism and results in changes of circulating metabolites during infection.\n\nSignaling Breaks the Urea Cycle Arginine and ornithine are both key metabolites of the urea cycle. The involved enzymes are encoded by Arg1, Otc, and Ass1, which are primarily expressed in the liver, as well as Asl, which is ubiquitously expressed (Uhl\u00e9 n et al., 2015) . Expression analysis of liver tissue of uninfected and infected Ifnar1 D/D and Ifnar1 +/+ mice highlighted that expression of Otc and Ass1 was repressed in a hepatocyte-intrinsic IFNAR1-dependent manner ( Figures 4A, S4A , and S4B). Arg1 was induced, whereas Asl was repressed upon infection, both independent of hepatocyte-intrinsic IFNAR1 signaling ( Figure 4A ). These infectioninduced transcriptional changes of the urea cycle genes Otc, Ass1, Asl, and Arg1 were maintained on transcriptomic and proteomic level up to 30 days after infection, with the most pronounced effects seen on days 2 and 8 ( Figures S4C-S4F ). Of note, the regulation of Otc and Ass1 was independent of food intake ( Figure S4G ).\n\nTo corroborate the hepatocyte-specific origin of the observed reprogramming of the hepatic urea cycle, we performed singlecell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) of primary murine hepatocytes isolated from naive or LCMV-infected wild-type mice 2 days after infection. Both samples showed comparable numbers of reads (uninfected: 1,493.5; infected: 1,429.0) and genes (uninfected: 705.5; infected: 761.0) per cell. We identified 348 differentially expressed genes in hepatocytes that correlated well with changes observed in bulk liver tissue (Figures 1, S4H , and S4I). Accordingly, genes induced in hepatocytes were associated with antiviral innate immune responses, whereas repressed genes were vastly associated with metabolic processes (Figures S4J and S4K) . Hepatocytes clustered by the infection status of the mice ( Figure 4B ), and we confirmed hepatocyte-intrinsic repression of Ass1 and Otc upon infection, which inversely correlated with expression levels of the ISG Ifit1 on the single-cell level (Figures 4C and 4D) . Transcriptional repression of Otc and Ass1 manifested in reduced abundance of OTC and ASS1 proteins in hepatocytes as observed by immunohistochemistry on days 2 and 8 after infection ( Figures 4E and 4F ). As expected, STAT1, a master regulator of IFNAR1 downstream signaling, was significantly upregulated in hepatocytes ( Figures 4E and 4F ). The modulation of Otc and Ass1 on day 2 and day 8 after infection was confirmed by real-time PCR in sorted hepatocytes ( Figure 4G ). In line with this, liver tissue of infected mice exhibited reduced enzymatic activity of OTC and ASS1, which we measured by the abundance of the 13 C-labeled reaction products argininosuccinate (ASS1) or citrulline (OTC) after pulsing with 13 C-labeled sub-strates. Addition of the ASS1-specific inhibitor a-methyl-DL-aspartic acid (MDLA) abolished production of argininosuccinate and indicated specificity of the assay ( Figure S4L ). In line with the IFNAR1-dependent increase of systemic ornithine levels upon infection ( Figure 4A ), these data indicate that IFNAR1 represses the degradation of ornithine via OTC in hepatocytes.

Symbols represent the arithmetic mean \u00b1 SEM; *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01 (Student's t test). See also Figure S3 .\n\n(legend on next page)\n\nThe downregulation of Asl expression, together with decreased argininosuccinate, is expected to aggravate the infectioninduced break in the urea cycle by limiting arginine re-synthesis ( Figure 4A ). We confirmed the aforementioned transcriptional changes of the urea cycle and upregulation of Ifit1 in the viral infection model of coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) by realtime PCR ( Figure S4M ). To test whether similar responses in the liver are seen in an inflammatory context, we administered the synthetic viral RNA analog and TLR3 agonist polyinosinicpolycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) intraperitoneally to wild-type mice. Poly(I:C) treatment resulted in strong induction of Ifit1 and corroborated the upregulation of Arg1 and downregulation of Otc and Ass1 in liver tissue by real-time PCR ( Figure S4N ). Treatment with 100 ng recombinant IFN-a induced an ISG signature in the liver but did not yield reproducible changes of expression of these genes (data not shown), suggesting that interferon signaling is required, but not sufficient to regulate the urea cycle.\n\nNext, we aimed to address whether viral infection leads to hyperammonemia, a hallmark parameter of urea cycle deficiency (UCD). Indeed, blood ammonia levels were significantly increased from 2 up to 8 days after LCMV infection, correlating with downregulation of the ammonia-fixating enzyme Cps1 ( Figures 5A and S5A ). This prompted us to further characterize the observed urea-cycle-related metabolic changes on a systemic level by in vivo tracing of 13 C 6 heavy-isotope-labeled arginine ( Figure 5B ). Liver tissue of infected mice that received a bolus of 13 C 6 arginine showed increased concentration of labeled ornithine and citrulline ( Figure 5C ). Arginine was not detected in the liver as reported previously (Wu et al., 2009 ). These local metabolic changes in the liver tissue, together with transcriptomic and proteomic changes in hepatocytes highly correlated with changes in systemic metabolism. We detected increased 13 C 6 arginine degradation in the serum ( Figure 5D ), which is consistent with the induction of Arg1 (Figures 4A and S4C) . Together with IFNAR1-dependent repression of Otc and Ass1 ( Figures 4A-4D ), this resulted in the systemic accumulation of 13 C 5 ornithine and 13 C 5 citrulline, respectively (Figure 5D) . In accordance with increased arginine degradation and decreased ornithine degradation, we detected elevated levels of 13 C 1 -labeled urea in liver tissue ( Figure S5B) , whereas 13 C 1 -labeled urea was only mildly elevated in the circulation ( Figure S5C ). Together with the reduction of 13 C 5 arginine, the end product of this pathway, these results support the notion that viral infection initiates a break of the hepatic urea cycle as early as 2 days after infection that persists at least until 8 days after infection and alters levels of metabolites in the circulation ( Figure S5D ).\n\nConsistently, we observed a significant decrease of the arginine-to-ornithine ratio in the serum of mice infected with LCMV as a result of both reduced arginine and increased ornithine levels ( Figures 5E and S5E ). Similar changes in serum concentration of arginine and ornithine were seen upon infection with MHV ( Figures S5F and S5G ). Taken altogether, our results derived from different experimental models demonstrate conserved transcriptional and metabolic modulation of the urea cycle upon viral infection.\n\nSystemic Arginine-Ornithine Homeostasis Is a Regulator of Antiviral Adaptive Immunity Because activated T cells are auxotrophic for arginine (Geiger et al., 2016; Murray, 2016) , we hypothesized that an altered arginine-to-ornithine serum ratio might exert immunomodulatory function. To test this in vitro, primary naive murine splenic CD8 T cells were activated with anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies for 3 days and IFN-g and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) production was assessed by flow cytometry. CD8 T cells cultured in medium with 11.5 mM arginine, a concentration comparable to the observed changes in vivo, displayed reduced cytokine production compared to standard cell culture medium containing 1,150 mM arginine ( Figure 6A ). Addition of ornithine, which is absent in standard cell culture medium, resulted in an additive suppressive effect on cytokine production ( Figure 6A ). This indicated that decreased concentrations of arginine impact CD8 T cell responses and that these effects are aggravated by a simultaneous increase of ornithine.\n\nTo experimentally uncouple the observed changes in the urea cycle from other co-occurring effects in vivo, we treated wild-type mice with recombinant pegylated human arginase 1 (recArg1) (Cheng et al., 2007) to aggravate the observed endogenous regulation of arginine and ornithine in the circulation. As expected, recArg1 converted arginine to ornithine in the serum and closely recapitulated the decreased arginine-to-ornithine ratio seen upon viral infection ( Figures 5E and S6A ). Administration of recArg1 did not affect the abundance of splenic T cells of infected and uninfected animals on day 8 after infection (Figure S6B ). Yet, we recognized an impaired shift from naive (CD62L + CD44 \u00c0 ) to effector (CD62L \u00c0 CD44 + ) T cells ( Figures  S6C and S6D) . Further, the numbers of virus-specific CD8 For metabolite data in (A), one of two representative experiments is shown. For (B)-(G), single-cell transcriptomic and histological data are derived from one experiment. Symbols represent the arithmetic mean \u00b1 SEM; *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001 (Student's t test). Log 2 fold changes and adjusted p values for single-cell RNA-seq data were computed as described in the STAR Methods. See also Figure S4 .\n\nT cells ( Figure 6B ) and their ability to produce the cytokines IFN-g and TNF-a upon peptide re-stimulation ( Figures 6C-6E ) were diminished upon recArg1 treatment. Virus-specific CD4 T cells were similarly affected ( Figure S6E ). CD8 T cell effector function remained impaired in recArg1-treated animals at least up to 50 days after infection ( Figure 6F ) and coincided with elevated viral loads in blood ( Figure 6G ) and organs 8 and 50 days after infection ( Figures S6F-S6I ). To investigate whether impaired cytokine production of CD8 T cells upon recArg1 treatment coincides with exhaustion, we analyzed PD1 expression on virusspecific CD8 T cells in the blood of mice 30 days after infection. This did not reveal any obvious differences for PD1 upon treatment with recArg1 ( Figure S6J ). Strikingly, treatment with recArg1 significantly ameliorated virus-induced CD8 T-cellmediated tissue damage as determined by reduced serum concentration of ALT and AST ( Figures 6H and 6I ). We conclude that modulation of the systemic arginine-to-ornithine ratio regulates antiviral T cell responses to ameliorate virus-induced tissue damage.\n\nMetabolic adjustments are crucial for activation and differentiation of immune cells (Jha et al., 2015; Pearce and Pearce, 2013; Pearce et al., 2009) . Our study identified an IFNAR1-dependent mechanism whereby hepatocytes receive instructions to repress the transcription of genes with metabolic function. The role of IFN-repressed genes in disease and homeostasis is still poorly understood. Yet it is noticeable that IFN-I-driven expression signatures from other organs and cell types do not appear to feature similar global repressive gene regulation (Mostafavi et al., 2016; Schoggins et al., 2011) . This potentially highlights a unique feature of the liver, which rapidly integrates inflammatory cues from the environment to modulate its intrinsic metabolism and, as a consequence, its systemic metabolic output to peripheral organs. This IFNAR1-mediated metabolic reprogramming of the liver may give rise to an unfavorable environment for pathogens ( (B) Schematic depiction of the carbon flow in urea cycle starting from 13 C 6 arginine illustrating 13 C-labeled (full circles) and unlabeled 12 C atoms of the respective metabolites.\n\n(C) Concentrations of 13 C 6 -labeled arginine, 13 C 5 -labeled ornithine, and 13 C 5 -labeled citrulline in liver tissue of naive and LCMV-infected (2 and 8 days after infection) mice (n = 3-6).\n\n(D) Concentrations of 13 C 6 -labeled arginine, 13 C 5 -labeled ornithine, and 13 C 5 -labeled citrulline in serum of naive and LCMV-infected (2 and 8 days after infection) mice (n = 3-6).\n\n(E) Systemic arginine-to-ornithine ratio of LCMV-infected (n = 8) wild-type animals.

See also Figure S5 .\n\ninstruct tissue repair and regeneration to prevent extensive tissue pathology. None of these options are mutually exclusive, and host damage control may be achieved by modulating disease tolerance and/or reducing immune effectors (Medzhitov, 2008 ). Next to other metabolic changes, we identified a regulatory effect of IFNAR1 signaling on the urea cycle, a central metabolic pathway that is primarily expressed in the liver. Its primary function is the conversion of circulating toxic ammonia into non-toxic urea with a fumarate shunt connecting the urea cycle to the TCA cycle (Meijer et al., 1990) . Fumarate can subsequently be metabolized to aspartate and a-ketoglutarate, two major precursors of de novo amino acid synthesis. Hence, the urea cycle is a central metabolic pathway that is crucial for both detoxication as well as cellular proliferation (Watford, 2003) .\n\nWe modeled the altered levels of serum arginine and ornithine upon viral infection by administration of recombinant arginase and demonstrate a suppressive effect on virus-specific CD8 T cell responses. This is in line with nutrient availability as an important factor that may either boost or dampen effector functions of T cells (Chang et al., 2015; Geiger et al., 2016; Johnson et al., 2018; Ma et al., 2017; Sinclair et al., 2013; Van de Velde and Murray, 2016) . A recent study identified that T cells may actively shape serum metabolite levels themselves, thereby creating potential functional feedback loops between systemic metabolism and T cell activation (Miyajima et al., 2017) . This study adds another regulatory layer next to well-established mechanisms, including T cell exhaustion, of how the host may fine-tune adaptive immunity during chronic infection (Wherry and Kurachi, 2015) .\n\nThe urea cycle is linked to amino acid, polyamine, and nucleotide metabolic pathways and represents a major hub of systemic nitrogen metabolism, which contributes to the formation of advanced liver disease (Li et al., 2019) . Accordingly, inherited urea cycle disorders (UCDs) and the resulting hyperammonemia with altered serum levels of the associated metabolites display severe health threats (Mew et al., 2003) . We found that mice infected with LCMV display hyperammonemia, a hallmark of hepatic encephalopathy (Tranah et al., 2013) . Additional investigations will be required to address whether infection-associated hyperammonemia may modulate sickness behavior and influence disease progression (Dantzer et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2019) .\n\nDownregulation or even loss of Otc and Ass1 are common features of many cancers, limiting aspartate consumption by the urea cycle and instead feeding into de novo nucleotide synthesis associated with tumor growth (Feun et al., 2012; Lam et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2018; Rabinovich et al., 2015) . Otc and Ass1 are also crucial for de novo arginine synthesis. As a result, many tumors are auxotrophic for arginine, which renders arginine a metabolic vulnerability that is currently therapeutically exploited by recArg1 treatment of cancer patients (De Santo et al., 2018) . In line, UCDs and in particular Ass1 deficiency of tumors potentially synergize with checkpoint blockade treatment in tumors (Lee et al., 2018) . Interestingly, reduced serum levels of arginine are associated with less liver tissue damage in chronic HBV infection although increased serum levels of arginine and arginine derivatives have been associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (Dumas et al., 2014; Li et al., 2011; Pallett et al., 2015; Soga et al., 2011) . Finally, deregulated ornithine metabolism and increased synthesis of polyamines may also impact cellular proliferation as well as the replication of diverse groups of viruses, potentially impacting on infection-associated cancer formation and progression (Casero et al., 2018; Mounce et al., 2016) . Using different approaches, we demonstrate that virusinduced IFNAR1 signaling in hepatocytes leads to downregulation of Otc and Ass1. The simultaneous upregulation of Arg1 during viral infection of the liver suggests that, during infection, hepatocytes are reprogrammed toward increased arginine degradation and ornithine accumulation. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that infiltrating immune cells, including myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), may contribute to increased Arg1 expression in the liver (Gabrilovich, 2017) . In line with this, our 13 C 6 heavy-isotope-labeling experiments confirmed that viral infection increases the hepatic conversion of arginine to ornithine and correlates with systemic accumulation of ornithine and citrulline. The observed infection-dependent reduction of the urea cycle end product 13 C 5 arginine further supported the notion of an IFNAR1-mediated break of the urea cycle. Still, these results do not rule out the potential additional contributions of extrahepatic events, as changes in the endocrine system are likely co-occurring with systemic metabolic reprogramming and/or sickness behavior during infection. Previous studies also established a link between hepatic autophagy, hepatocytederived circulating ARG1, and the systemic arginine-toornithine ratio, leading to reduced tumor growth in mice (Poillet-Perez et al., 2018) . These lines of evidence suggest that endogenous metabolic reprogramming of the urea cycle modulates the pathophysiology during infectious disease. Our results may also provide a potential explanation for why many non-hepatotropic infections result in concomitant hepatitis (Adams and Hubscher, 2006; Lalazar and Ilan, 2014) . Taken together, our study provides evidence for an infectioninduced reprogramming of the urea cycle in hepatocytes, a central metabolic pathway in the liver, leading to hyperammonemia alongside with the deregulation of systemic metabolism. We identified hepatocyte-intrinsic IFNAR1 signaling as a key regulator of circulating levels of arginine and ornithine to fine-tune adaptive immunity. This endogenous cytokinedriven mechanism of immunomodulation and host protection across organs could be targeted to ameliorate tissue pathology in infectious and inflammatory diseases.\n\nDetailed methods are provided in the online version of this paper and include the following: \n\nInquires for further information or requests for resources and reagents should be directed and will be fulfilled by the lead contact Andreas Bergthaler (abergthaler@cemm.oeaw.ac.at). This study did not generate new unique reagents. \n\nLymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) was grown on BHK-21 cells (baby hamster kidney cells derived from 5 unsexed newborns, ATCC CCL-10) and titer was determined in a modified focus forming assay using Vero cells (female green monkey kidney cells, ATCC CCL-81) . Mice were intravenously infected with 2x10 6 focus forming units (FFU) of LCMV. Murine hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV) was generated using 17CL1 cells (spontaneously transformed 3T3 cell line established from unsexed BALB/c mouse embryos) (Sturman and Takemoto, 1972) and titer was determined by standards plaque assay on L929 cells (male murine fibroblasts, ATCC CCL-1) (Cervantes- Barragan et al., 2007) . Mice were intraperitoneally infected with 10 3 plaque forming units (PFU) of MHV.\n\nMice were sacrificed at the time points indicated in the legends. Tissue samples were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u00c080 C until further analyses. For serum collection, blood was collected at the respective time points, samples were centrifuged at 10.000 rpm for 5 min at 4 C. The serum was transferred into a new tube and stored at \u00c080 C until further analyses.\n\nPegylated recombinant human Arginase 1 (PEG-BCT-100, Bio-Cancer Treatment International) was administered to mice via intraperitoneal injection at a dosage of 50 mg/kg. Mice were treated twice per week. Treatment was started one day prior to LCMV infection. Control mice received the same volume of PBS. Conditional Ifnar1 ablation on hepatocytes Tamoxifen (T5658, Sigma) was dissolved in sterile sunflower oil (S5007, Sigma) containing 10% ethanol (v/v) and stored at \u00c020 C for a maximum of 2 weeks. To induce hepatocyte specific Ifnar1 ablation, Cre-Alb ERT2 Ifnar1 fl/fl and Cre-Alb ERT2 Ifnar1 +/+ control mice were administered 50 mg/kg tamoxifen intraperitoneally for 5 consecutive days (Metzger et al., 2005) . Experiments were started the day after the last dose.\n\npoly(I:C) treatment Mice were challenged with poly(I:C) (invivogen, #tlrl-pic) via intraperitoneal injection at a dosage of 4 mg/kg. Control mice received PBS. Liver tissue was harvested and analyzed via real-time PCR at the indicated time points.\n\nMice were anesthetized (Ketamine/Xylazine: 1:3, 0.1 ml/10 g mouse, Vetoquinol) and the liver was cannulated via the portal vein and perfused with 20 mL HBSS (GIBCO) containing 0.5 mM EGTA (Sigma) followed by digestion of the liver with 20 mL L15 medium (GIBCO) containing 40 mg/L Liberase (Roche) at a rate of 5 mL/min. The liver was isolated, placed in a Petri dish with digestion medium (L15 with 40 mg/L Liberase) and the liver capsule was diligently removed. Cells were centrifuged at 50 g for 5 min at 4 C, resuspended in William's E medium containing 10% FCS (PAA) and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin-Glutamine (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and plated. Cells were stimulated at the time of plating.\n\nNaive or LCMV-infected C57BL/6J mice were given an intravenous bolus of 500 mg 13 C 6 labeled arginine (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, CLM-2265-H-PK) dissolved in PBS. Mice were sacrificed 20 min afterward and serum and tissues of interest were harvested and stored at \u00c080 C. Per mg tissue (approximately 100 mg per sample), 3 mL 80% (v/v) methanol were added and tissue samples were homogenized using a Precellys 24 tissue homogenizer (Precellys CK14 lysing kit, Bertin). 50 mL of homogenized tissue or serum were mixed with 450 mL of methanol and 250 mL of water and vortexed for 10 s. Afterward, 450 mL chloroform were added per sample and mixed by vortexing for 10 s, incubated on ice for 5 min and vortexed again for 10 s before centrifuging them for 10 min at 1000 g. The upper aqueous phase was collected, dried (nitrogen evaporator) and reconstituted in 50 mL of methanol. Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 1000 g and supernatants were used for LC-MS analysis. A Vanquish UHPLC system (Thermo Scientific) coupled to an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos (Thermo Scientific) mass spectrometer was used for the LC-MS analysis. The chromatographic separation for samples was carried out on an ACQUITY UPLC BEH Amide, 1.7 mm, 2.1x100 mm analytical column (Waters) equipped with a VanGuard: BEH C18, 2.1x5mm pre-column (Waters). The column was maintained at a temperature of 40 C and 2 mL sample were injected per run. The mobile phase A was 0.15% v/v formic acid in water and mobile phase B was 0.15% v/v formic acid in 85% v/v acetonitrile with 10 mM ammonium formate. The gradient elution with a flow rate 0.4 mL/min was performed with a total analysis time of 17 min. The mass spectrometer was operated in a positive electrospray ionization mode: spray voltage 3.5 kV; sheath gas flow rate 60 arb; auxiliary gas flow rate 20 arb; capillary temperature 285 C. For analysis, a full MS scan mode with a scan range m/z 50 to 400, resolution 120.000, AGC target 2e5 and a maximum injection time 50 ms was applied. For detection of urea the scan range was adjusted to m/z 50 to 250 at a resolution of 500.000.\n\nLiver tissue lysis and buffer conditions for enzymatic assays for OTC and ASS1 were previously described (Diez-Fernandez et al., 2016; Guerreiro et al., 2009) . Briefly, liver tissue was lysed in 10 mM HEPES, 0.05% Triton X-100, 0.5 mM DTT, 2 mM EDTA, 1X Halt Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 78447), pH 7.4 using a TissueLyser (QIAGEN) at 30 Hz for 3x 30 s. Protein concentrations were measured in the cleared lysate using a Bradford assay. 100 mg of protein were used for each assay. For OTC activity, 200 mL of 50 mM Tris-Acetate, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM L-Ornithine 13 C 5 (Cambridge Isotype Laboratories, CLM-4724-PK, 1 mM Carbamoyl Phosphate (Sigma, C4135), 1X Halt Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 78447), pH 8.3 and samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 C. For ASS1 activity, 200 mL of 20 mM HEPES, 2 mM ATP (Thermo Fisher Scientific, R1441), 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM L-Aspartate 13 C 4 (Cambridge Isotype Laboratories, CLM-1801-H-PK), 1 mM L-Citrulline (Sigma, C7629), 1X Halt Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 78447), pH 7 and samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 C. For experiments using the ASS1-specific inhibitor a-Methyl-DL-aspartic acid (MDLA, M6001, Sigma), 100 mg of total liver protein extract were treated with 10 mM MDLA and the enzymatic assay was performed as described above (Guerreiro et al., 2009) .\n\nFollowing the incubation, 10 mL of sample was immediately mixed with 90 mL methanol and subsequently prepared for mass spectrometric analysis of labeled downstream metabolites. 13 C labeled argininosuccinate or 13 C labeled citrulline was detected using a Vanquish UHPLC system (Thermo Scientific) coupled to an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos (Thermo Scientific) mass spectrometer was used for the LC-MS analysis. The chromatographic separation for samples was carried out on an ACQUITY HSS T3, 1.8 mm, 2.1x100 mm analytical column (Waters) equipped with a VanGuard HSS T3, 2.1x5 mm pre-column (Waters). The column was maintained at a temperature of 40 C and 2 mL sample were injected per run. The mobile phase A was 0.1% formic acid (v/v) in water and mobile phase B was 0.1% formic acid (v/v) in methanol. The gradient elution with a flow rate 0.5 mL/min was performed with a total analysis time of 10 min. The mass spectrometer was for 1h. The assay was run according to the manufacturer's instructions. Oligomycin (2 mM), Carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP, 0.25 mM) and Rotenone/Antimycin A (500 nM) were subsequently injected into wells at the desired time points. Raw data were analyzed using Wave Desktop Software (Agilent, version 2.0) and exported and graphed in GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Sorftware, version 7.0a).\n\nSpleens of mice were harvested and dissociated through a 40 mm cell strainer (Falcon). The pellet was resuspended in 1 mL red blood cell lysis buffer (eBioscience, #00-4300-54) and incubated at room temperature for 1 min. Subsequently the reaction was stopped by addition of 9 mL PBS. Cells were counted and CD8 T cells isolated using a magnetic activated cell sorting negative selection (MACS) kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Miltenyi Biotec, . 96 well plates were coated over night at 4 C with 1 mg/mL anti CD3e (BD, #553238) and 2 mg/mL anti CD28 (BD, #553295) in a total volume of 60 mL PBS per well. Wells were washed with PBS and 5x10 4 cells were plated per well in RPMI 1640 medium for SILAC (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #88365), supplemented with 10% dialyzed FCS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, # A3382001), 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin-Glutamine (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 50 mM b-mercaptoethanol (Sigma, #M6250) and 20 U/mL IL-2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #34-8021-82). Medium was supplemented with indicated concentrations of L-arginine (Sigma, #A5006) and/or L-ornithine (Sigma, #O2375) and cultured up to 72h before proceeding with intracellular cytokine staining.\n\nTo sample blood, 3-4 drops of blood were collected in 1 mL MEM medium (GIBCO) supplemented with 2000 U/L heparin (Heparin-Natrium-5000-ratiopharm). Red blood cells were lysed by adding 500 mL red blood cell lysis buffer (eBioscience, #00-4300-54) and incubated at room temperature for 1 min. Samples were spun down (1500 rpm), resuspended in 100 mL PBS and plated in a 96 well plate. Spleens were dissociated into a single cell suspension using a 40 mm cell strainer (Falcon) and resuspended in 10 mL of PBS (GIBCO). An aliquot of cell suspension was used for counting to calculate total number of cells per spleen. 200 mL per sample (approx. 2x10 6 cells) were plated in a 96 well plate. Plates were spun and supernatants were removed.\n\nFor tetramer staining, cells were resuspended in 25 mL PBS containing GP33 (1:500) and NP396 (1:250) tetramers (NIH Tetramer Core Facility) and incubated at 37 C for 15 min. For intracellular cytokine staining (ICS), cell pellets were resuspended in 50 mL of RPMI 1640 medium (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% FCS (PAA) and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin-Glutamine (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 50 mM b-mercaptoethanol (Sigma), containing LCMV peptides (1:1000, Peptide 2.0 Inc.) and Protein Transport Inhibitor Cocktail (eBioscience, #00-4980-03; 1:500, Thermo Fisher Scientific). As positive control, cells were treated with Cell Stimulation Cocktail (eBioscience, #00-4970-93). Cells were incubated for 4 h at 37 C and then surface antigens were stained as described above. Afterward, a master mix of desired antibodies in 25 mL FACS buffer containing 0.05% saponin (Sigma, 47036) against intracellular antigens of interest were added and incubated for 90 min at 4 C (IFNg: PE-Cy7, clone XMG1.2; IL-2: PE, clone JES6-5H4; TNFa: APC, clone MP6-XT22; all Biolegend. all 1:200). Next, cells were washed twice with FACS buffer, resuspended in 100 mL and analyzed by flow cytometry.\n\nThree TMT 6-plex runs were carried out to monitor the changes in liver protein abundance during the entire course of infection. The first run included biological replicates from day 2 and day 8 after infection along with the uninfected controls. The second run included replicate samples of uninfected controls, day 30 and day 60 after infection. To account for the effect of aging, the third run included uninfected controls at day 0 and day 123, along with infected samples from day 123 (all in biological replicates). Identical uninfected controls (day 0) were included in all three TMT 6-plex runs as an internal control to monitor reproducibility between the runs. Liver tissues were homogenized (TissueLyser II, QIAGEN) in 1.5 mL 50 mM HEPES buffer, pH 8.5 supplemented with 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA, Pierce Biotechnology, Thermo Scientific, IL). Further processing was adapted from a filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) method previously described (Manza et al., 2005; Wisniewski et al., 2009 ). For each sample, 100 mg of the liver tissue lysate was reduced with 100 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and transferred into VIVACON 500 filter unit (Vivaproucts, Littleton, MA). SDS-containing buffer was removed from the sample by centrifugation and exchanged with 8 M urea in 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer. Proteins were alkylated with 50 mM iodoacetamide and washed with 50 mM triethyl ammonium bicarbonate (TEAB). Finally, porcine trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) was used for protein digestion in an enzyme to protein ratio of 1:100 w/w. 7 or up to 17 samples were multiplexed per lane and run on a 50bp single-end flow cell in a HiSeq2000 or HiSeq3000 sequencer (Illumina), respectively. Called bases by the Illumina Realtime Analysis software were converted into BAM format using Illumina2bam and demultiplexed using BamIndexDecoder (https://github.com/wtsi-npg/illumina2bam). The RNA-seq analysis pipeline was performed with Tuxedo. Reads were mapped on the mouse reference genome (Mus musculus, Ensembl e87, December 2016) using TopHat2 (v2.0.10). Cufflinks (v2.2.1) was employed to assemble transcripts from spliced read alignments, using the Ensembl e87 transcriptome as the reference as well as de novo assembly of transcript models. Further, differential analysis of gene expression was quantified with Cuffdiff (v2.2.1). Transcriptome sets of all replicates for each sample group were combined with Cuffmerge. Expression values in graphs are reported as FPKM (fragments per kilobase pf transcript per million). Differential gene expression is attested based on expression level R 1 FPKM, adjusted p value % 0.05 and absolute log2 fold-change of 1 (heatmap) or 0.6 (circos plot).\n\nWe performed single-cell RNA-sequencing on a 10X Genomics Chromium Single Cell Controller with the Chromium Single Cell 3 0 V3 Kit following the manufacturer's instructions. Sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 3000 instrument in 2x75bp paired-end mode. We used the Cell Ranger (v3.0.2) 10X Genomics software to demultiplex the raw sequencing data and align them to the mouse GRCm38 reference genome. We proceeded with the analysis of the UMI counts using the R Bioconductor package Seurat v3.1.0 (Stuart et al., 2019) . The two samples, uninfected and 2 days post infection, were merged and processed together. Cells with more than 30% mitochondrial content were discarded. Mitochondrial genes, as well as genes that were not detected in more than 1 cell were discarded. We used markers for Kupffer (Clec4f, Csf1r, C1qc, C1qa, C1qb) , endothelial (Kdr, Egfl7, Igfbp7, Aqp1) and hepatocyte (Apoa1, Apob, Pck1, G6pc, Ttr) cells for cell identification (Halpern et al., 2017) . In order to focus on hepatocytes, we kept only those cells that had a summed expression of hepatocyte markers greater than both the summed expression of Kupffer as well as endothelial cells markers. We also eliminated cells that had less than 0.5% of Alb reads. The normalization of the UMI counts was performed with the SCTransform from the Seurat Package, with the regression variable on the condition (uninfected and 2 dpi) . We further ran PCA on the normalized counts and the 3.000 most variable genes. Based on the Jack Straw method we selected the first 20 principal components explaining most of the variability and proceeded with a UMAP low-dimensional projection. Differential analysis between the 2 conditions was performed using the FindMarkers function in Seurat, based on the Wilcox test with a Bonferroni correction. Genes were considered as differentially expressed if they had an absolute average log2 fold-change greater than 0.2 and an adjusted p value smaller than 0.05.\n\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the gene set with a minimum average expression level across conditions of 5 FPKM. Only the 10% most variable (computed on the coefficient of variance) genes were considered for the PCA analysis.\n\nHierarchical clustering of different gene sets FPKM or CPM expression as well as metabolite abundance values were performed using a Pearson distance measure with an average clustering method. A k-means ++ (z-norm) clustering approach using ExpressCluster software v1.3 (http://cbdm.hms.harvard.edu/LabMembersPges/SD.html) was performed on the union of differentially modulated genes or metabolites.\n\nFor the interaction model (2x2 factorial design) of naive versus LCMV-infected Ifnar1 D/D and Ifnar1 +/+ , we quantified gene expression as the number of reads covering each gene. The gene expression on the mouse Ensembl e87 transcripts was quantified from the previously TopHat2 mapped reads with featureCounts (Liao et al., 2014) . Raw read counts were normalized with the voom (Law et al., 2014) function of the limma package (Smyth, 2004) . Normalized expression values, reported as log2 counts per million (CPM), were then processed through limma's empirical Bayes models. We implemented limma's interaction model as a two (Ifnar1 +/+ , Ifnar1 D/D ) by two (naive, LCMV-infected) factorial design. Genes differentially modulated in the interaction model have been selected based on a minimum log2 CPM of 0, an adjusted p value % 0.05 and a minimum log2 fold-change absolute value of 1 (heatmap) or 0.6 (circos plot).\n\nEnrichment analyses on the union of differential modulated entities (transcripts and/or proteins) specific clusters were done in Cytoscape ClueGO (Bindea et al., 2009) For metabolic pathway enrichment analyses, we took the union of differentially expressed genes (expression R 1 FPKM, absolute log2 fold-change R 0.7, adjusted p value % 0.05) and proteins (absolute log2 fold-change R 0.25 and adjusted ratio p value < 0.05 and sample p value < 0.05) across all time points. We extracted metabolism-associated genes from KEGG (Kanehisa and Goto, 2000) metabolic pathways database. Only the pathways with q value of enrichment < 0.05 were considered. The enriched pathways are represented as a circos plot (Krzywinski et al., 2009) , with the width of each ribbon in a given category representing the percentage of genes at each time point among all genes leading to enrichments in the respective category. The color gradient (from lighter to darker) represents the percentage of pathways in each category that were found as enriched at a specific time point.\n\nMass spectrometry data processing The acquired raw MS data files were processed with msconvert (ProteoWizard Library v2.1.2708) and converted into MASCOT generic format (mgf) files. Peptides were identified by searching the resultant peak lists against the SwissProt mouse database version v2013.01_20130110 (24615 sequences; 14280050 residues) with the search engines MASCOT (v2.3.02, MatrixScience, London, UK) and Phenyx (v2.5.14, GeneBio, Geneva, Switzerland). Submission to the search engines was done via a Perl script that performs an initial search with relatively broad mass tolerances (MASCOT only) on both the precursor and fragment ions (\u00b110 ppm and \u00b1 0.6 Da, respectively). High-confidence peptide identifications were used to recalibrate all precursors and fragment ion masses prior to a second search with narrower mass tolerances (\u00b14 ppm and \u00b1 0.025 Da). Trypsin was chosen as cleavage specificity with the maximum of 1 miscleavage site allowed. Carbamidomethyl cysteine, N-terminal and lysine-modified TMT 6-plex were set as fixed modifications, whereas oxidized methionine was set as a variable modification.\n\nTo validate the proteins, MASCOT and Phenyx output files were processed by internally developed parsers. Proteins with R 2 unique peptides above a score T1, or with a single peptide above a score T2, were selected as unambiguous identifications. Additional peptides for these validated proteins with score > T3 were also accepted. For MASCOT and Phenyx, T1, T2, and T3 peptide scores were equal to 16, 40, 10 and 5.5, 9.5, 3.5, respectively (P value < 10 \u00c03 ). The validated proteins retrieved by the two algorithms were merged, any spectral conflicts discarded, and grouped according to shared peptides. A false positive detection rate (FDR) of < 1% and < 1% was determined for proteins and peptides, respectively, by applying the same procedure against a reversed database.\n\nThe log2 fold-change cutoffs for differential protein modulation were determined based on pairwise comparisons of protein abundances between the two replicates of uninfected control samples across the 3 independent runs. The 2.5% and 97.5% quartiles of the inter-replica pairwise log2 fold-change was computed. Based on the quartile values, we have set the cutoff at 0.25 and \u00c00.25 for up-and down-modulated proteins, respectively. Additional to the log2 fold-change, statistical significance of observed changes was calculated by Isobar software (Breitwieser et al., 2011) . Adjusted P value ratio as well as the P value samples as calculated by Isobar were asked to be less than 0.05.\n\nMetabolite measurements using the AbsoluteIDQ p180 Kit (Biocrates Life Science AG) were validated with the supplied software MetIDQ, Version 5-4-8-DB100-Boron-2607 (Biocrates Life Sciences). All metabolite abundances inferior to the limit of detection (LOD) were replaced with a value equal to half the LOD. We eliminated all metabolites that did not have an average abundance superior to LOD in at least one condition. Modulation of metabolites was assessed through a t test between conditions. The cutoffs for the modulation were obtained based on all the inter-replica pairwise comparisons of wild-type uninfected samples. The 2.5 and 97.5 quartiles of these inter-replica log fold-change were used to define the cutoffs. The cutoffs were \u00c00.44 and 0.65 for the whole liver dynamics serum metabolite measurements. For serum measurements of Ifnar1 D/D and Ifnar1 +/+ mice at 1.5 days post infection, based on the same approach, we have set the cutoffs at \u00c00.73 and 0.4. Significance was inferred based on a p value inferior to 0.05. For the interaction model (2x2 factorial design) of naive versus LCMV-infected Ifnar1 D/D and Ifnar1 +/+ , we implemented limma's interaction model as a two (Ifnar1 +/+ , Ifnar1 D/D ) by two (naive, LCMV-infected) factorial design. Significantly modulated metabolites in the interaction model were identified by an absolute log2 fold change of 0.7 and a p value inferior to 0.05.\n\nMetabolite tracing data were processed using the TraceFinder 4.1 software (Thermo Scientific).\n\nImages were photographed using an Olympus BX 53 microscope, and were quantified using HistoQuest TM software (TissueGnostics GmbH, Vienna, Austria).\n\nData are presented as arithmetic mean \u00b1 SEM. Statistical significances were calculated using a Student's t test when comparing two groups or using two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction when comparing longitudinal changes. * p < 0.05 ** p < 0.01 *** p < 0.001.\n\nProteomic data (PRIDE: PXD011122) and transcriptomic data (GEO: GSE123688, which includes GEO: GSE118703, GSE123684, GSE118819 and GSE137082 and PRIDE: PXD011122) are deposited in the PRIDE and GEO databases, respectively."}
