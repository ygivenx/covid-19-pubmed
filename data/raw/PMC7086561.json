{"title": "A time-of\u2013drug addition approach to target identification of antiviral compounds", "body": "The in vitro tests most commonly used to determine the target of action of anti-HIV drugs are assays measuring the activity of the following viral enzymes: reverse transcriptase (RT) (polymerase and RNaseH activity)3,4,5,6,7, integrase8,9 and protease10. The advantage of these enzymatic assays in the test tube is that they are straightforward to perform, do not require any special safety infrastructure and produce clear interpretable results. However, if there are no previous indications of the presumed target of a new drug, it is difficult to know with which assay to start. In that case, viral resistance is selected against the inhibitor and the target of action is then needed to be determined by sequence analysis, which is time-consuming and cumbersome. Currently, many other test-tube assays have been described for measuring the distinct interactions (protein-protein, RNA-protein) that are essential for viral replication, and new assays are being developed11,12.\n\nHowever, on the basis of test-tube studies of mechanisms of action, several compounds have been mistakenly ascribed to inhibit a certain target that, upon further study in cell culture, appeared to inhibit an off-site target. For example, suramin was first found to be a very potent inhibitor of the retroviral reverse transcription process in the test tube and to block the in vitro infectivity and cytopathic effect of HIV3,13. It was not only the first antiviral drug to be shown in vitro to block HIV infection but was also the first to be proven effective in suppressing HIV replication in HIV-infected patients14. Although suramin was originally pursued for its anti-HIV potential because of its RT-inhibitory capacity, it has since become clear that, in cell culture, suramin primarily targets the viral adsorption step15 involving the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 (ref. 16). Another example is the Tat inhibitor CGP64222 (ref. 17), shown to target viral entry in cell culture18. Yet another example is L-chicoric acid and its derivatives, which counteract HIV-1 integrase activity in vitro but in cell culture block virus entry19,20. Therefore, tools to characterize the mechanism of action of virus inhibitors in cell culture are required to define their correct targets of action21.\n\nThere are several tests for studying the target of action of antiviral compounds in cell culture. For example, by comparing the activity of a compound on acutely1 versus persistently or latently infected cells22,23,24, it can be easily determined whether an inhibitor targets a pre- or a postintegrational step of the viral replication cycle25. A drug blocking the production of a new virus from persistently infected cells presumably targets a postintegrational event because in the persistent infection system all preintegrational steps, such as virus binding, reverse transcription and integration, are omitted. Alternatively, for several steps in the HIV replication cycle (e.g., virus binding26, integration21, transcription27 and viral budding28), there exist specific tests in cells that can be performed to study the effect of a potential inhibitor of this target. For example, if one presumes that a newly discovered inhibitor interferes with virus binding, a virus-binding assay26 can be performed. However, none of these assays combine all these properties in just one test that covers a full replication cycle.\n\nCompound concentration. The antiviral activity (IC50) and toxicity (CC50) of a compound should be determined before a TOA experiment is performed. The concentration of compound used in the TOA experiment is 100-fold its IC50, as established in an MT-4/MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay1. It should be confirmed that the compound is not toxic to the cells at this concentration; if so, a lower concentration should be used, although we recommend not to use a concentration lower than tenfold its IC50, as this could result in an insufficient inhibition of viral replication. Moreover we recommend checking the solubility of the compound in aqueous medium at the intended concentration, as precipitation reduces the final concentration of the compound.\n\nVirus replication capacity. Not any cell line can be used in this protocol. It is important to use a highly susceptible cell line in combination with a highly replicative virus to ensure that replication can be accurately measured 31 h after infection (in the case of HIV). A pretest should be carried out to ensure that sufficiently high virus production is measured after 31 h of infection (Fig. 1). For other viruses, the time required for one replication round should first be determined in order to assign a suitable detection window. In addition, the amount of inoculum required should be optimized to ensure that sufficient virus is released into the supernatant at the time of harvest.\n\nControls. If available, always include sufficient control/reference compounds that are well established in their target of interaction.\n\nDetection of viral replication. The virus replication can be monitored in different ways. For HIV, usually the virus-associated p24 antigen in the supernatant of infected cells is quantified by ELISA (commercially available through different suppliers). Other methods such as virus-associated RT activity (assay kits are available through different suppliers) or quantitative RT-PCR33 can be used as alternatives.\n\n\nCentrifuge (Multifuge 3S-R, Heraeus)Centrifuge tubes (50 ml; TPP, cat. no. 91050)Eppendorf high-performance microcentrifuge 5417R (Eppendorf, cat. no. 5407 000.317 and cat. no. 5490 061.004 (FA-45-24-11 fixed-angle rotor 24 \u00d7 1.5/2.0 ml, including aerosol-tight, aluminum lid))Cup Eppendorf 1.5-ml safe lock (Eppendorf, cat. no.

This can be stored at 4 \u00b0C for 1 month.\nPreparation of stock solutions of test compoundsHomogeneous aliquots of the test compounds have to be prepared. These can be prepared as described earlier in reference 1. The most commonly used solvents are DMSO, water or buffer solutions. Ensure that the compounds dissolve well in the solvent used. As a rule of thumb, for long-term storage the compounds are stored at 4 \u00b0C; however, the storage conditions and the maximum storage duration depend on the compound concerned. If one presumes degradation of a compound, we advise comparing the antiviral activity of a fresh solution with that of an old solution in the antiviral MT-4/MTT assay1. During the experiment, the compound solutions need to be maintained at room temperature (21 \u00b0C), protected from light.\n\n\nTiming 45 min, plus 1 h incubation time5To this cell suspension, add the required amount of virus to reach a multiplicity of infection of 0.5 or 7.2 \u00d7 104 CCID50 per well; this is bulk infection (See Box 2 for virus titration and Box 3 for example calculations).CautionAll experiments using virus should be performed in an appropriate safety laboratory (L3) by trained and skilled personnel, taking the required security precautions, especially as virus stocks with high titer are to be used in these experiments.6Immediately after infection, add 200 \u03bcl of this suspension (bulk infection) to the 1.5-ml tubes containing 22 \u03bcl of each compound solution at 1,000-fold its IC50; these are the tubes from Step 2, which represent time point 0.7Place the 1.5-ml tubes and the rest of the bulk infection at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Incubate for 1 h.8After 1 h of incubation, add 1 ml of complete medium to each 1.5-ml tube and enlarge the volume of the bulk suspension to 40 ml with complete medium.9Pellet the infected cells in the 1.5-ml tubes and in the bulk infection by centrifugation (4 min, 330g, room temperature). Remove the supernatants and resuspend the cells in 40 ml of complete medium.10Repeat Step 9 twice (a total of three centrifugations), and finally resuspend in complete medium (200 \u03bcl for the 1.5-ml tubes and 5 \u00d7 105 cells per ml for the bulk infection).Critical StepAppropriate washing to remove the unbound virus is necessary to minimize background.11During the washing steps (Steps 9 and 10), add 22 \u03bcl of each compound solution in the wells of the 96-well plate, which will be used for time points 0 and 1 h.12Transfer 200 \u03bcl from the bulk suspension to all wells of time point 1 h and transfer 200 \u03bcl from the 1.5-ml tubes to the 22 \u03bcl of compound solution in the plate corresponding to time point 0.13Mix the bulk suspension again and add 200 \u03bcl to each remaining well in the 96-well plate that will be used for the experiment. Place the plate at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air, and store the compound solutions in the dark at room temperature.\n\nTiming 5 min for each time point, with intervals of 1 h14Each hour, add 22 \u03bcl of the compound dilution to the wells corresponding to the correct time point and place the plate back at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air.15At 31 h after infection, microscopically score the plate for cytotoxicity by visually monitoring the cell morphology and/or for eventual crystallization/precipitation of the compounds in solution. Next, take 110 \u03bcl supernatant from each well, inactivate by adding 12 \u03bcl Triton X-100 (5%) and store at \u221280 \u00b0C until you can quantify the virus-associated p24 core antigen by ELISA.Pause pointThe samples may be stored at \u221280 \u00b0C (for up to 6 months) without affecting the results.16Quantify the virus-associated p24 core antigen in the supernatant by ELISA; we use a commercially available kit from PerkinElmer and follow the manufacturer's instructions.17Plot the amount of p24 (pg ml\u22121) versus time points (see Fig. 3, panel b).\nTroubleshooting\n\n\nTroubleshooting advice can be found in Table 1.\n\n\nSample preparation\n\n\nSteps 1\u20134: 35 min\n\n\nInfection\n\n\nSteps 5 and 6: 10 min\n\nStep 7: 1-h incubation\n\nSteps 8\u201312: \u223c30 min\n\nStep 13: 5 min\n\n\nCompound addition\n\n\nStep 14: 5 min for each compound, with intervals of 1 h\n\nStep 15: 20 min\n\nStep 16: Time required to perform p24 ELISA is dependent on the kit and corresponding manufacturer's instructions\n\nStep 17: 10 min\n\nTime from start of experiment until obtaining the final results: \u223c2 d\n\nThis protocol enables the target of action of newly discovered antiviral drugs to be determined in cell culture. For example, the RT inhibitor AZT is able to inhibit the replication of HIV-1 when it is present within the first 3 h of infection (Fig. 3b); on the contrary, when it is added at 4 h after infection or later, it is unable to inhibit the viral replication because its target of action (the reverse transcription process) has already occurred and the target is no longer of importance for the further replication of the virus in a single round of infection. It should be pointed out that it is imperative to include control drugs with a known and well-characterized target of action in each experiment. When a drug with an unknown target of action shows a similar profile to the established anti-HIV agent, it strongly suggests that this drug targets the same process or at least targets one that is operative at the same time. Most notably, using this assay makes it possible to discriminate between an RT inhibitor of the nucleoside RT inhibitor type (NRTI) versus NNRTI type (Fig. 3). Indeed, we have consistently observed in all experiments that NRTIs (2\u2032,3\u2032-dideoxynucleoside (ddN) analogs) lose their antiviral activity exactly 1 h before that of any NNRTI. This is most likely because of the fact that ddN analogs need to undergo phosphorylation by cellular enzymes before becoming active, as chain terminators, in the RT reaction.\n\nOne should keep in mind that for drugs with a dual target of action, i.e., one molecule targeting two distinct steps within the replication cycle, always the last occurring target in the viral replication will be revealed by this experiment, as this is the last step at which replication can be blocked by the inhibitor. To illustrate this point, several combinations of two well-known HIV inhibitors were combined in one experiment (Fig. 4). In the case of dextran sulfate (an inhibitor of viral entry) combined with AZT (an RT inhibitor), the TOA assay only reveals reverse transcription as a target for this combination. For AZT combined with L-870,810 (an integrase inhibitor), only the integrase is revealed as a target. A special example of drugs with a dual mechanism of action are polysulfonate dendrimers, which at low concentrations in cell culture inhibit the viral adsorption but when added at higher concentrations also target a process coinciding with the viral reverse transcription (Fig. 5)34. This can be explained by both the extent of cellular uptake of the drug(s) at different concentrations and their differential potency against different processes. Therefore, in a TOA experiment, it is advised to test compounds at different concentrations.\n\nIt is possible that a compound will not completely block HIV replication. In many cases this is because of the compound being present at too low a concentration to completely inhibit the virus replication or having too low an intrinsic potency. In the first case, this can be remedied by increasing the concentration of the compound, but cytotoxicity and solubility in aqueous medium of the compound will be limiting factors. We have noticed that there are compounds that are able to inhibit the viral replication and generate an IC50 value in the replication assay but that do not reach a complete (100%) block of viral replication because of a lack of intrinsic potency. Even when no complete inhibition of viral replication can be established with a certain compound, a satisfactory and reliable result could be obtained in this TOA assay. In this case, one can expect to see a residual amount of p24 at time points occurring before the target of the compound that is not zero (only reached when there is a 100% block of viral replication) but lower than in the control without the compound. It is also possible that sometimes a slight slope in loss of activity will be observed instead of a clear jump. This can be because of toxicity of the compound or because the compound is targeting a step in the viral replication that involves an iterative process that takes place for several hours.\n\nMany variations of the TOA experiment can be envisaged, e.g., a so-called negative TOA experiment can be performed for drugs that need time to be processed by the host cell to become active in the cells. In such an experiment, the compound is added at different time points before the virus infection takes place. A similar approach can be used when the mechanism of action of a compound is based on the down- or upregulation of a cellular co-factor involved in viral replication. In addition, shorter time periods between compound addition (15 or 30 min) can be used instead of the 1-h interval."}
