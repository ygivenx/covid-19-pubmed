{"title": "Kidney impairment is associated with in-hospital death of COVID- 19 patients", "body": "In December 2019, a series of unknown origins cases of acute respiratory illness occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China 1-2 . High-throughput sequencing indicated a novel betacoronavirus that is currently named \"severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\" (SARS-CoV-2) 3 . On February 11 th 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) officially named disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 as \"Coronavirus Disease 2019\" . The disease has rapidly spread from Wuhan to other areas globally. As of February, 17th, Chinese health authorities announced that 70641 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus infection and 1772 death cases had been reported in 31 provinciallevel regions. Of note, in Wuhan, 41152 COVID-19 cases with 1309 deaths were confirmed at the same day, which indicated that the proportion of severe cases and the mortality rate in Wuhan were much higher than those in other provinces in China.\n\nHowever, the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 cases remain largely unclear.\n\nIdentifying and eliminating factors that predict a negative outcome is the key to improve survival from COVID-19, especially in Wuhan.\n\nAlthough diffuse alveolar damage and acute respiratory failure were the main features of COVID-19 4 , the involvement of other organs need to be considered. After lung infection, the infiltrated virus may enter the blood circulation, accumulate in kidney and cause damage to renal resident cells. Indeed, RNAaemia, defined as a positive result for real-time PCR in the plasma sample, was found in 15% COVID-19 patients 4 . It is reported that 6.7% patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 developed acute renal impairment and the mortality of SARS patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) was 91.7% 5 . Thus, the kidney impairment and outcome in patients infected by SARS-CoV-2, which resembles SARS in 2003, were urgently warranted.\n\nIn this large consecutive cohort study of COVID-19 adult patients in a tertiary teaching hospital with 3 branches and more than 4000 beds, which was designated for critical COVID-19 cases by local government, we aimed to demonstrate the prevalence and in-hospital outcome of kidney impairments in COVID-19 patients.\n\nAll consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to Tongji hospital, Tongji medical college, Huazhong university of science and technology from January 28 to February 11, 2020 were enrolled. Tongji hospital, located in Wuhan, Hubei Province, the endemic areas of COVID-19, is one of the major tertiary teaching hospitals. Tongji hospital was assigned responsibility for the treatments of severe COVID-19 patients by Wuhan government on January 31 th . All patients who were enrolled in this study were diagnosed as COVID-19 according to the guidance provided by the Chinese National Health Commission. Patients with a history of maintenance dialysis or renal transplantation were excluded. The clinical outcomes were monitored up to February 17, 2020, the final date of follow-up. relatively fewer patients (26.9%) demonstrated hematuria (Table 2) .\n\nCompared with patients with normal baseline Scr, the age and the percentage of male and severe subgroups were significantly higher in patients with elevated baseline Scr (Table 1) . Moreover, patients with elevated baseline Scr demonstrated higher leukocyte count, lower lymphocyte count and platelet count. The coagulant function abnormality, including prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time and higher Ddimer, were more common in patients with elevated baseline Scr. The percentage of increased procalcitonin and the level of aspartate aminotransferase and lactose dehydrogenase were also higher in patients with elevated baseline Scr. Of note, the gap of peak and baseline Scr was much greater in patients with elevated baseline Scr ( Table   2 ).\n\nDuring hospitalization, AKI was documented in 22 (3.2%) patients. The incidence of AKI was significantly higher in patients with elevated baseline Scr (9.1%) than patients with normal baseline Scr (2.0%). Moreover, patients with elevated baseline Scr developed more severe AKI (Table 1 ). Figure 1a showed serial measurement of Scr of each patient with AKI. Most of AKI occurred within 7 days after admission. For patients with normal baseline Scr, AKI occurred later and tended to recovered more rapidly.\n\nHowever, AKI happened more quickly and severe in patients with elevated baseline Scr.\n\nThe in-hospital death occurred in 89 (12.5%) patients in our study. The incidence of in-hospital death in patients with elevated baseline Scr was 30.9%, which was significantly higher than patients with normal baseline Scr (9.2%) ( Table 1 ). The All rights reserved.

Scr showed apparent increase in dead patients during hospitalization, while a downward trend was observed in live patients (Figure 1b) .\n\nKaplan-Meier analysis revealed a significantly higher in-hospital death rate for patients with kidney impairments, including elevated baseline Scr, elevated baseline blood urea nitrogen (BUN), proteinuria, hematuria and AKI ( Figure 2 ). Univariate Cox regression analysis showed that older than age 65, severe disease, leukocyte count greater than 4\u00d710 9 /L and lymphocyte count less than 1.5\u00d710 9 /L were associated with in-hospital death. Besides, kidney impairment indicators mentioned above were also associated with in-hospital death (Table 3) (Table 3 ).\n\nIn this large consecutive cohort study conducted in a tertiary teaching hospital with 3 branches in Wuhan, we have determined the prevalence of kidney impairment in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was high. By analyzing clinic data and patients' outcome, we also demonstrated that kidney impairment was associated with in-hospital All rights reserved.

Indeed, multiple organ involvements including the liver, gastrointestinal tract and kidney have been reported during the course of SARS in 2003 8 and COVID-19 9 . Of note, the high prevalence of kidney impairment at baseline may be explained by the fact that many COVID-19 patients couldn't be admitted to hospital in the early stage of disease outbreak because of large number of patients and limited beds in hospital in Wuhan. In addition, another explanation is that some COVID-19 patients may have a past history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and CKD patients have a proinflammatory milieu and functional defects in innate and adaptive immune cell populations 10 . In a community-based cohort of nearly 10,000 adult individuals, reduced eGFR and elevated albumin creatinine ratio were associated with higher risk for hospitalization with infection and subsequent mortality 11 . Furthermore, CKD patients have a higher risk for upper respiratory tract infection 12 and pneumonia 13 .\n\nAKI is a syndrome of abrupt loss of kidney function that is strongly associated with higher mortality and morbidity 14 . In our cohort the detect rate of AKI in COVID-19 patients was 3.2%, which was similar to that reported in previous studies with small patients numbers 1, 4, 9, 15 and higher than 0.5% in a large observational study 16 . This may be explained by that the proportion of severe patients was extremely high in previous case series and only 15.7% in the large observational study. In our large cohort study, 35.5% patients were severe and this may illustrate the real detection rate of AKI in All rights reserved.

Importantly, the present method of detecting AKI is mainly based on changes in Scr and the frequency of Scr tests has a substantial impact on the detection rate of AKI 17 . In a nationwide cross-sectional survey of hospitalized adult patients in China, the detection rate of AKI was only 0.99% by KDIGO criteria 18 . After adjusting for frequency of Scr, the incidence of AKI in Chinese hospitalized adults gave rise to 11.6% 19 . Thus, in order to improve early detection kidney injury, more frequent Human tissues RNA-seq data demonstrate that the ACE2 expression in urinary organs (kidney) was much higher (nearly 100-fold) than that in respiratory organs (lung) 22 .\n\nTherefore, the kidney impairment may be caused by coronavirus entering the cells through ACE2 that are highly expressed in the kidney. Second, deposition of immune complexes of viral antigen or virus-induced specific immunological effector mechanisms (specific T lymphocyte or antibody) may damage the kidney. However, the data of kidney specimens from SARS patients showed normal glomerular histology with absence of electron-dense deposits, indicating the possibility of an active immunemediated glomerulonephritis was low. Thus, kidney histology of COVID-19 patients is All rights reserved.

It is reported that AKI is associated with an increased risk of death in patients with SARS 5 , which is in consistence with our study.\n\nWe also confirmed the value of Scr on admission in predicting the in-hospital death of patients with COVID-19 and AKI was more likely to occur in patients with elevated baseline Scr. It is noteworthy that most COVID-19 patients developed acute kidney injury in the early period of hospitalization, especially in only 2 days after admission in patients with elevated baseline Scr. Therefore, in the treatment of COVID-19, early prevention of kidney impairment, including adequate hemodynamic support and avoiding nephrotoxic drugs, is particularly important and early renal replacement treatment may improve the patients' prognosis. Beyond insufficiency in kidney function\uff0c the abnormal urine analysis, including proteinuria and hematuria, was also associated with in-hospital death. This indicated that more attention should be paid to urine test in clinic.\n\nEven though this study included a large number of patients from a tertiary teaching hospital in Wuhan, there are several limitations.

However, the large number of COVID-19 case in this study may minimize the potential for bias. Second, although we attempted to adjust for many confounders, there may exist confounders either unmeasured or unknown that could explain our observed results. Third, the clinic data of patient after discharge is lacking, so we could not assess the effect of COVID-19 on long-term outcome. The further impact of COVID-19 on patients' kidney function, especially the incidence of chronic kidney disease in these patients should be the focus of future research.\n\nThe prevalence of kidney impairment (abnormal urine analysis and kidney dysfunction) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was high. After adjustment for confounders, kidney impairment was associated with higher risk of in-hospital death. the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is \n\nThe study protocol and waived written informed consent was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Tongji Hospital (No. TJ-C20200132). the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02. 18.20023242 doi: medRxiv preprint "}
