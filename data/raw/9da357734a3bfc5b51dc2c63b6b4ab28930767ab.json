The thorough clinical profile of COVID-19 has not been completely comprehended.\n\nReported illnesses range from mild to severe or even death. The severity of COVID-19 varies among individual patients during the same outbreak and among patient groups during different outbreaks in different regions.\n\nThe immune response in COVID-19 patients, either systemic or local, has not been well studied even one month after the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Although the chest CT scan has suggested progressive pneumonia in COVID-19 patients, the inflammatory process and immune reaction have not been detailed. In one report, elevation of neutrophil cellularity, serum IL-6, and c-reactive protein was found together with lymphopenia in COVID-19 patients 3 . Other clinical studies indicate that COVID-19 patients develop lymphopenia and high-levels of various cytokines such as G-CSF, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1A, and TNF-\u03b1 4, 5 . The surge of proinflammatory cytokines incurred the cytokine storm which might induce viral sepsis and tissue/organ damages to result in shock or even multiple organ failure. SARS-CoV-2specific antibodies seem to be produced in COVID-19 patients, suggesting the mounting of humoral responses 3 . However, the comprehensive status of either innate immunity or adaptive immunity in COVID-19 patients remains largely unknown.\n\nIn the current study, we analyzed multiple cytokines and immune cell populations in the blood of Chinese COVID-19 patients. Our study outlines the immunopathological profile in COVID-19 patients, and may provide helpful information for developing future therapies against SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n.

The reagents, calibrators, and quality controls were from the same vendor.\n\nTo analyze serum cytokines, the whole blood was centrifuged at 500\u00d7g for 5 minutes at 4 o C. The serum was carefully harvested and stored at -80 o C before analysis.\n\nMultiple serum cytokines were quantified using the Human Th1/Th2 Cytokine Kit II (Guangzhou Weimi Bio-Tech) following the manufacturer's manual.\n\nTo measure lymphocytes and T cell subsets, 100 \u00b5l of whole blood was incubated in 900 \u00b5l of Tris-NH 4 Cl buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at room temperature for 5 minutes to lyse erythrocytes. After two washes with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), cells were incubated with BD Multitest 6-Color TBNK Reagent or BD Multitest CD3/CD8/CD45/CD4 (BD Biosciences) following the vendor's instructions. After another two washes with PBS, cells were resuspended in 500 \u00b5l of PBS To evaluate regulatory T cells, erythrocytes were lysed as described above. The blood samples were then incubated with FITC-conjugated CD4 antibody, Violet 450conjugated CD127 antibody, Percp-conjugated CD45 antibody, and APC-conjugated CD25 antibody (5\u00b5g/ml each, all from BD Biosciences) for 15 minutes on ice. After another two washes with PBS, cells were resuspended in 500 \u00b5l of PBS.\n\nSamples were analyzed on a BD FACSCanto Plus flow cytometer. Among all collected events, single events were gated between FSC-A and FSC-H. Cell debris was excluded and intact cells were then gated from single events based on FSC-A and SSC.

As indicated in Figure 1A , WBC number was significantly decreased in mild patients as compared with the control group. However, WBC number was not remarkably changed in severe patients. Total lymphocyte number was decreased in severe patients but not in mild patients, suggesting the lymphopenia severe patients ( Figure 1B ). Neutrophils were increased in severe patients but not in mild patients ( Figure 1C ). The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), consistent with the change in lymphocytes, was moderately increased in mild patients and profoundly increased in severe patients, in comparison to the control group ( Figure 1D ). To analyze the adaptive immune cell populations, we conducted flow cytometry analysis on CD45+CD3+ total T cells, CD3+CD4+ T helper cells and CD3+CD8+ cytotoxic T cells ( Figure 1E ). We found a similar decrease in CD45+ lymphocytes in COVID-19 patients ( Figure 1F ). Total T cell number was significantly decreased in COVID-19 patients, but no significant difference was observed between mild and severe patients ( Figure 1G ). Similarly, CD4+ T helper cells and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells were diminished in COVID-19 patients as compared with the control group, but no significant difference was found between mild and severe patients ( Figure 1H & 1I) . The ratio between CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells was not changed ( Figure 1J) .\n\n.

A similar decrease was also seen in COVID-19 patients' NK cells ( Figure 2C ). No remarkable change in NKT cellularity was observed in COVID-19 patients ( Figure 2D ).\n\nTregs are an important T cell subset for immune tolerance and anti-inflammatory reaction. In our study, we measured the cellularity of CD3+CD4+CD25+CD127-T cells which were considered a Treg-enriched population ( Figure 3A ). We found that Tregs were increased in mild COVID-19 patients as compared with controls ( Figure   3B ). There was only a slight increase in Tregs in severe patients ( Figure 3B ). Figure 4A ). As demonstrated in Figure 4B , as compared with controls, IL-2 was considerably increased in severe patients but not in mild patients. IL-4 was remarkably raised in mild patients but not in severe patients ( Figure 4C ). IL-6 was significantly increased in severe patients but not in mild patients ( Figure 4D ). Like IL-2 and IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-\u03b1 were significantly increased in severe patients but not in mild patients ( Figure 4E & 4F) .\n\nIFN-\u03b3, however, showed no significant change in COVID-19 patients ( Figure 4G ).\n\n.

IL-2 was not significantly changed in mild patients along the stay ( Figure 4H ). No dramatic temporal change of IL-4 was observed in either mild patients or severe patients ( Figure 4I ). The IL-6 level in mild patients was always very low, while IL-6 was drastically increased in severe patients. Interestingly, as IL-2, IL-6 stayed at a relatively stable levels within two weeks, and then went up on day 15-20 followed by a decline back to the initial level ( Figure 4J ). IL-10, too, was always higher in severe patients than mild patients. Besides, IL-10 in severe patients underwent a further up-regulation on day 5-10 and day 10-15, respectively ( Figure 4K ). The changes in the levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 were almost neglectable ( Figure 4L & 4M) , suggesting that they probably are not good indicators of COVID-19 severity.\n\n.

As a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious probably owing to the virus spread through asymptomatic-infected individuals 6 . Until recently, very few publications characterized the comprehensive changes in the innate and adaptive immunity in SARS-CoV-2 infected people, although some non-peer reviewed sources such as Medrxiv released some information.\n\nIn the present clinical study, we analyzed almost all immune cell types in both mild and severe COVID-19 patients. We found lymphopenia consistent with former reports 4, 7, 8 . Neutrophils, however, were increased in severe patients. It is noteworthy that the lymphopenia seemed to arise from a comprehensive reduction of all lymphocyte populations, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells, and NK cells.\n\nThe decrease in blood lymphocytes might be due to the recruitment of reactive lymphocytes in the lungs. It will be helpful to investigate infiltrating cells in the lungs to test if the infiltrates are predominantly lymphocytes other than granulocytes.\n\nAnother possibility is that lymphocytes are more sensitive than granulocytes to the disturbed homeostasis and then underwent significant cell death. Whatever the case, lymphopenia is an indicator of severe COVID-19.\n\nCOVID-19 patients. This phenomenon might suggest the recruitment of reactive antiviral CD8+ T cells into the infection site. According to reported T cell response in SARS-CoV infection, CD8+ T cell reaction was more frequent and robust than CD4+ T cell reaction 9 . It is therefore possible that this is also the case in COVID-19. Indeed, a latest case report shows the sign of excessive T cell activation in COVID-19, as .

However, B cell and NK cell number were also remarkably reduced in severe patients, suggesting a profound suppression of lymphocytes. Interestingly, Tregs, which play a crucial role in immunoregulation and anti-inflammatory response 10 , were elevated in mild patients, suggesting a possible immunosuppression. In severe patients, the Tregs cellularity was comparable to that in control individuals, probably due to an overall T cell deficiency. Although the reduction of lymphocytes is clear, the changes in the functions of lymphocyte populations remain unknown. In future it will be necessary to test the functions of distinct immune cell populations, so as to tell whether the innate or adaptive immunity is activated or impaired in COVID-19.\n\nRecent research reveals the fatal cytokine storm in critical COVID-19 patients.\n\nIncreased serum IL-6, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1A, and TNF\u03b1 were observed in COVID-19 patients 8 . Several cytokine levels were also evaluated in our study. We found that serum IL-2, IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-\u03b1 were mainly up-regulated in severe patients, while the first three cytokines exhibited a more meaningful increase. Thus, serum IL-2, IL-6, IL-10 could be used to assess the severity of COVID-19.\n\nCytokines are produced by both innate immune cells and adaptive immune cells. IL-2 is mainly secreted by activated T cells 11, 12 . The higher IL-2 level in COVID-19\n\npatients likely reflects T cell activation. IL-6 is a well-known pro-inflammatory cytokine but it can also act as an anti-inflammatory mediator 13 . The cellular sources of IL-6 include myeloid cells, T cells, smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, etc 14 . In .

IL-10 acts as an anti-inflammatory cytokine deriving from alternatively activated macrophages, Th2 cells, Tregs, etc 16 In conclusion, our study shows that the comprehensive decrease of lymphocytes, and the elevation of IL-2 and IL-6 are reliable indicators of severe COVID-19.\n\n.
