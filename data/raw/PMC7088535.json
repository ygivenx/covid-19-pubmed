{"title": "Apocynin protects endothelial cells from endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis via IRE1\u03b1 engagement", "body": "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) functions as a dynamic organelle responsible for folding of secretory and membrane proteins. Perturbations of ER homeostasis lead to accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins, thus triggering ER stress. To restore the ER homeostasis, adaptive signaling cascade known as unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated. Among the three UPR branches, inositol-requiring enzyme 1\u03b1 (IRE1\u03b1) is the most sensitive arm. As we have reviewed previously [1], IRE1\u03b1 functions as an intriguing cell fate switch. IRE1\u03b1 contains a kinase domain and an endoribonuclease (RNase) domain. The best characterized substrate for the RNase domain of IRE1\u03b1 is X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1). Upon ER stress, XBP1 is spliced by IRE1\u03b1, thereby generating XBP1s, an active transcription factor encoding various adaptive genes. The IRE1\u03b1-XBP1 axis exerts adaptive and pro-survival effect, while other signaling pathways such as IRE1\u03b1-TRAF2-JNK axis evoke pro-apoptotic effect.\n\nEndothelial cells (ECs) line the intima of blood vessels and sense the mechanical and chemical stimulations in blood flow. Influenced by the elevation or reduction of blood nutrients, ECs are very metabolically active cells. With a high amount of protein synthesis, ECs are predisposed to ER stress [2]. Stressors such as hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia may cause ER stress. In response, the ECs initiate UPR to promote survival. However, in the case of unresolved and sustained ER stress, the UPR can result in EC apoptosis [3, 4]. Accumulating evidence showed that ER stress-induced EC apoptosis is implicated in a variety of human diseases, including diabetes [5], atherosclerosis [6], and neurodegeneration [7]. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms of ER stress-elicited EC apoptosis remain elusive. Thus, it is important to clarify the mechanisms and find potential therapeutic agents for these diseases.\n\nApocynin (APO), isolated from Picrorhiza kurroa, is widely used as an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase (NOX) [8]. In addition, mounting evidence showed the anti-inflammatory activity of apocynin in various cells and animal models of inflammation [9, 10]. Moreover, the anti-apoptotic effect of apocynin was demonstrated in recent studies as well. The protective role of apocynin in EC apoptosis was verified in sepsis [11], retinopathy of prematurity [12], and pulmonary hypertension [13]. Furthermore, our previous study revealed the protective effect of apocynin on heat stress-induced EC apoptosis [14]. Until now, most of the studies have attributed the protective effect of apocynin to the inhibition of NOX activity and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. However, it is noted that apocynin attenuated the increased ER stress in the remote non-infarcted myocardium after myocardial infarction in rabbits [15]. Therefore, we wonder whether apocynin protects ECs from apoptosis via the regulation of ER stress signaling.\n\nA recent study showed that IRE1\u03b1 overexpression inhibited ER stress-mediated apoptosis in BMP2-stimulated ATDC5 cells [16]. Moreover, the protective effect of IRE1\u03b1 in ER stress-evoked apoptosis was also described in coronavirus infection [17]. Accordingly, we hypothesized that apocynin may be involved in the regulation of ER stress sensor IRE1\u03b1 expression, thereby promoting EC survival during ER stress.\n\nIn the present study, we strive to determine whether apocynin mediates the anti-apoptotic effect in ECs under ER stress via the regulation of IRE1\u03b1 signaling pathways.\n\nApocynin (A10809) and thapsigargin (T9033) were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, USA). The sequences of oligonucleotide for control and IRE1\u03b1 siRNA were synthesized by GenePharma (Shanghai, China). The siRNA-targeted sequences were as follows: control siRNA, sense 5\u2032-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUTT-3\u2032 and antisense 5\u2032-ACGUGACACGUUCGGAGAATT-3\u2032; IRE1\u03b1 siRNA, sense 5\u2032-AGACAGAGGCCAAGAGCAATT-3\u2032 and antisense 5\u2032-UUGCUCUUGGCCUCUGUCUTT-3\u2032. Antibodies against IRE1\u03b1 (#3294, CST, MA, USA), p-JNK (#4668, CST, MA, USA), JNK (#9252, CST, MA, USA), XBP1u (sc-7160, Santa, CA, USA), XBP1s (#647501, Biolegend, San Diego, USA), and cleaved caspase 3 (#9665, CST, MA, USA) were used. Anti-\u03b2-actin monoclonal antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated species-specific secondary antibodies were from Zhongshan Golden Bridge Bio-technology (Beijing, China). TRIzol reagent and the Transcriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit were from Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA). THUNDERBIRD SYBR qPCR Mix was from Toyobo (Osaka, Japan). Annexin V-FITC/PI apoptosis detection kit was from Beyotime (Beijing, China). Other chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma unless indicated.\n\nHuman umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were obtained from ScienCell Research Laboratories (Carlsbad, CA). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium-Ham\u2019s Nutrient Mixture F-12 (DMEM/F12) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 \u00b5g/mL streptomycin (GIBCO, Grand Island, NY) at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air.\n\nHUVECs were harvested and lysed in cell lysis buffer according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Total protein concentrations were determined by the BCA assay. Western blotting was performed as previously described [18]. Primary antibodies against IRE1\u03b1 (1:1000), p-JNK (1:1000), JNK (1:1000), XBP1u (1:200), XBP1s (1:500), and cleaved caspase 3 (1:1000) were used. The secondary antibody were diluted at 1:8000. Protein bands were visualized with chemiluminescence and imaged with an imaging station. Image J was used to measure the density of the bands.\n\nTotal RNA was extracted using a TRIzol RNA isolation system according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized with the Transcriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Real-time PCR was performed using the ABI PRISM\u00ae 7500 Sequence Detection System with a THUNDERBIRD SYBR qPCR Mix kit. The following primers were used: human IRE1\u03b1 forward, 5\u2032-GGCCTGGTCACCACAATTAGA-3\u2032; human IRE1\u03b1 reverse, 5\u2032-TTTGGGAAGCCTGGTCTCC-3\u2032; human XBP1s forward, 5\u2032-CTGAGTCCGAATCAGGTGCAG-3\u2032; human XBP1s reverse, 5\u2032-ATCCATGGGGAGATGTTCTGG-3\u2032; human \u03b2-actin forward, 5\u2032-CATGTACGTTGCTATCCAGGC-3\u2032; human \u03b2-actin reverse, 5\u2032-CTCCTTAATGTCACGCACGAT-3\u2032; human GAPDH forward, 5\u2032-TGTTCGACAGTCAGCCGC-3\u2032; human GAPDH reverse, 5\u2032-GGTGTCTGAGCGATGTGGC-3\u2032.\n\nTo visually identify EC apoptosis, double staining with FITC-conjugated Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) was conducted. After experimental treatments, HUVECs were washed twice with PBS and stained for 15 min in the dark with 5 mL Annexin V-FITC and 10 mL PI in binding buffer at room temperature. The staining results were imaged using a Zeiss LSM780 laser confocal scanning microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).\n\nData were expressed as means \u00b1 s.d. of at least three independent experiments and analyzed using SPSS version 16.0 software. Statistical comparisons were performed using a one-way analysis of variance followed by post hoc pairwise comparisons. P < 0.05 was considered significant.\n\nFirst, we wondered whether apocynin can alleviate ER stress-induced EC apoptosis. In order to induce ER stress in ECs, we applied thapsigargin (TG), a specific irreversible inhibitor of ER calcium-ATPase, for the following experiments. Given that JNK signaling pathway participates in ER stress-induced cell apoptosis [17], we detected the phosphorylation levels of JNK. As revealed in Fig. 1a, TG application caused a significant increase in JNK phosphorylation, while apocynin pretreatment at the concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1 mmol/L strongly mitigated this effect. This result reveals that apocynin may protect EC from ER stress-induced apoptosis. Then, to further investigate the anti-apoptotic role of apocynin, we evaluated the cleavage of caspase 3. We found that TG evoked a significant increase in cleaved caspase 3 expression (Fig. 1b). Nevertheless, apocynin pretreatment diminished this effect robustly (Fig. 1b). Subsequently, annexin V-FITC/PI staining was conducted to verify the anti-apoptotic role of apocynin. Consistent with the western blot results, TG induced an obvious increase in EC apoptosis, while apocynin significantly alleviated ER stress-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1c, d). Hence, these data clearly highlight the anti-apoptotic role of apocynin in ER stress-mediated EC apoptosis.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, to investigate whether IRE1\u03b1 is implicated in apocynin-mediated anti-apoptotic effect, we adopted the siRNA-mediated IRE1\u03b1 knockdown strategy. Results showed that transfection of IRE1\u03b1 siRNA significantly reduced IRE1\u03b1 protein expression, as well as abolished apocynin-induced upregulation of IRE1\u03b1 expression (Fig. 2a). To further clarify the role of IRE1\u03b1 in APO-induced anti-apoptotic effect, expression levels of cleaved caspase 3 were detected after IRE1\u03b1 siRNA treatment. The results demonstrated that IRE1\u03b1 siRNA transfection augmented TG-induced caspase 3 cleavage and abolished apocynin-mitigated caspase 3 cleavage during ER stress, while control siRNA treatment had neither effect on TG-induced increase in cleaved caspase 3, nor on apocynin-mitigated caspase 3 cleavage (Fig. 2b). To fully confirm these results, we performed the annexin V-FITC/PI staining. Consistently, IRE1\u03b1 knockdown abolished the anti-apoptotic effect of apocynin in ECs during ER stress. As revealed in Fig. 2c, d, in comparison to Control siRNA+APO+TG group, the IRE1\u03b1 siRNA+APO+TG group showed an increased level of apoptosis significantly. Taken together, these results indicate that apocynin prevents ECs from ER stress-elicited apoptosis, and that this effect is at least partly dependent on IRE1\u03b1.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo determine whether apocynin mediates anti-apoptotic effect through regulation of IRE1\u03b1, we next proceeded to examine the protein expression levels of IRE1\u03b1. Total proteins were extracted from HUVECs after apocynin (0.5 mmol/L) treatment for 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 24 h, respectively. Then, protein expression levels of IRE1\u03b1 were determined by western blotting. As shown in Fig. 3a, IRE1\u03b1 protein expression was gradually increased, reached a peak at 8 h and then slightly decreased from 16 to 24 h. Next, IRE1\u03b1 protein expression was examined in HUVECs subjected to different concentrations of apocynin for 8 h (Fig. 3b). The results showed that IRE1\u03b1 protein expression was significantly enhanced by apocynin at the concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 1 mmol/L. To further validate the effects of apocynin on IRE1\u03b1 expression, qRT-PCR assays were performed. As a result, the mRNA expression of IRE1\u03b1 was obviously increased after the application of apocynin (0.5 mmol/L) for 8 h (Fig. 3c). Hence, these results suggest that apocynin upregulates the expression of IRE1\u03b1 in both protein and mRNA levels.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt has been known that XBP1 was the main target of IRE1\u03b1 [1]. Thus, we next detected the protein and mRNA expression levels of XBP1s in HUVECs after apocynin stimulation. Unexpectedly, apocynin exhibited no significant influence on the expression of XBP1s, neither in protein nor in mRNA levels (Fig. 4a\u2013c). However, when ER stress occurred, apocynin contributed to the generation of XBP1s greatly. As revealed in Fig. 4d, TG elicited a moderate degree of XBP1 splicing in HUVECs, while the application of 0.5 mmol/L apocynin in HUVECs resulted in more XBP1s production. In addition, the APO+TG group showed a significant reduction in XBP1u (the unspliced form of XBP1), compared with the TG group (Fig. 5). These results suggest that apocynin intensifies the pro-survival IRE1\u03b1-mediated XBP1 splicing, which may serve as a protective mechanism against EC apoptosis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nER stress-induced EC apoptosis has been implicated in a variety of pathological processes. The ER stress sensor IRE1\u03b1 has long been recognized as an important cell fate switch. Apocynin, widely used as an NOX inhibitor, was also demonstrated to suppress ER stress in kidney dysfunction [19], Alzheimer disease (AD), and myocardial infarction [15]. The protective role of apocynin in ER stress was generally considered as a result of inhibition of NOX-derived ROS. However, we wondered whether apocynin influences IRE1\u03b1 signaling pathways and thus participates in the regulation of EC apoptosis.\n\nIn the present study, we found that apocynin exhibited anti-apoptotic effect in ECs during ER stress. JNK phosphorylation levels, cleaved caspase 3 expression levels, and annexin V-FITC/PI staining were examined. As expected, apocynin abated TG-induced JNK phosphorylation, caspase 3 cleavage and apoptosis in ECs. However, IRE1\u03b1 knockdown significantly diminished the anti-apoptotic effect of apocynin in ECs, which implied the possibility that apocynin protects from ER stress-induced EC apoptosis via IRE1\u03b1 enhancement.\n\nNext, to the best of our knowledge, we identified the role of apocynin in the regulation of IRE1\u03b1 expression for the first time. Our data showed that apocynin enhanced IRE1\u03b1 expression in both protein and mRNA levels in ECs. These results suggested that IRE1\u03b1 is involved in apocynin-mediated anti-apoptotic signals. Previously, we have reviewed that IRE1\u03b1-evoked XBP1 splicing promotes cell survival [1]. Therefore, we then detected the protein and mRNA expression levels of XBP1s. Interestingly, no significant alteration of XBP1s expression was observed, neither in protein nor in mRNA levels. As we all know, TG induces ER stress and activates IRE1\u03b1, which further mediates pro-survival XBP1 splicing at the initial stage. However, if the adaptive UPR signaling pathways fail to rebalance ER homeostasis, IRE1\u03b1 may promote several pro-apoptotic signaling pathways, including regulated IRE1\u03b1-dependent decay (RIDD) and IRE1\u03b1-TRAF2 axis [1]. In the present study, we found that the degree of XBP1 splicing, characterized by an increase in XBP1s and a decrease in XBP1u, was higher in TG-stimulated ECs with apocynin pretreatment when compared with TG stimulation alone. This result can be explained that apocynin enhances IRE1\u03b1 expression and thus promotes the adaptability of ECs. Therefore, when ER stress occurs, XBP1 splicing process can be intensified in condition of the high-level IRE1\u03b1 deposit, tilting the balance of IRE1\u03b1 signaling toward EC survival. Taken together, we believe that apocynin promotes pro-survival IRE1\u03b1-XBP1 axis and thus protects ECs from ER stress-elicited apoptosis.\n\nUntil now, most studies have attributed the anti-apoptotic effect of apocynin to the inhibition of NOX. Our results provide a novel mechanism explanation for the protective role of apocynin in ER stress-induced EC apoptosis. Crosstalk between ER stress and oxidative stress was evidenced in various disease processes such as cardiovascular pathology [20]. ER stress, characterized by protein misfolding, can induce ROS production and oxidative stress [21]. Likewise, oxidative stress disturbs redox homeostasis in the ER and causes ER stress. ER stress and oxidative stress can accentuate each other and activate pro-apoptosis signaling [22]. Intriguingly, additional evidence indicate that ER stress in ECs can be uncoupled from oxidative stress and that some antioxidants can alleviate oxidative stress but not ER stress [23]. Previous study showed that the activation of NOX in myocardium mediated increased ER stress, contributing to myocyte apoptosis [15]. And siRNA knockdown of the cytosolic subunit of NOX, p47phox, abrogated TG-induced apoptosis in H9C2 cells [24]. Using p47phox gene knockout mice, Maria found that NOX acts as an intermediate for ER stress in endothelial dysfunction [25]. Therefore, whether NOX is involved in the anti-apoptotic role of apocynin in ECs during ER stress remains to be identified.\n\nBesides the research findings, there are also some limitations in this study. For example, the exact mechanism by which apocynin upregulates the expression of IRE1\u03b1 is still yet to be explored in the future. It also remains to be further investigated on whether and how apocynin affects dimerization and autotransphosphorylation of IRE1\u03b1. IRE1\u03b1 exists as a monomer in basal conditions, while the luminal domain of IRE1\u03b1 undergoes dimerization upon activation. The dimerization promotes autotransphosphorylation and leads to the activation of RNase domain which is responsible for XBP1s generation. Accordingly, the detection for IRE1\u03b1 dimerization and autotransphosphorylation is important to clarify the activation behavior of IRE1\u03b1. IRE1\u03b1 dimerization can be evaluated by detecting the foci formation of IRE1\u03b1-GFP [26] and BiFC assay [27]. Recently, Amin-Wetzel et al. also established a new method to measure the endogenous IRE1\u03b1 dimerization in cells [28]. Newbatt et al. reported a DELFIA technology that is specific for detecting IRE1\u03b1 autotransphosphorylation [29]. Hopefully, we can apply some of these methods to clarify whether apocynin regulates the activation of IRE1\u03b1 directly.\n\nIn conclusion, the present study revealed that apocynin protects ECs from ER stress-induced apoptosis and this effect is partly dependent on IRE1\u03b1. Apocynin upregulates the expression of IRE1\u03b1 and promotes IRE1\u03b1-mediated XBP1 splicing. Our findings shed light on the novel protective mechanism of apocynin, which may provide a potential pharmacologic target for ER stress-associated human diseases."}
