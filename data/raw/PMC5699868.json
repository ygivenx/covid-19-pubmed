{"title": "An unfolded protein-induced conformational switch activates mammalian IRE1", "body": "Protein-folding homeostasis is critical for proper cell function. Accordingly, cells evolved surveillance mechanisms to monitor protein-folding status and elicit adaptive responses to adjust protein-folding capacity according to need (Balchin et al., 2016; Bukau et al., 2006; Walter and Ron, 2011). In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where the majority of transmembrane and soluble secretory proteins fold and mature, protein-folding homeostasis is ensured by a network of signaling pathways collectively known as the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Walter and Ron, 2011). In metazoans, perturbations leading to the accumulation of mis- or unfolded proteins in the ER are recognized as \u2018ER stress\u2019 by three unique ER-resident UPR sensors, IRE1, PERK and ATF6 (Cox et al., 1993; Cox and Walter, 1996; Harding et al., 2000; Niwa et al., 1999; Sidrauski and Walter, 1997; Tirasophon et al., 2000; Walter and Ron, 2011; Yoshida et al., 1998; Yoshida et al., 2001). These sensors transmit information about the protein-folding status in the ER and drive gene expression programs that modulate both the protein-folding load and folding capacity of the ER. If ER stress remains unmitigated, the UPR induces pro-apoptotic pathways, thereby placing the network at the center life-or-death decisions that affect the progression of numerous diseases (Bi et al., 2005; Feldman et al., 2005; Lin et al., 2007; Lu et al., 2014; Vidal et al., 2012; Walter and Ron, 2011; Zhang and Kaufman, 2008).\n\nIRE1 drives the most conserved branch of the UPR, which exhibits remarkably similar mechanistic aspects shared between yeast and mammals (Arag\u00f3n et al., 2009; Korennykh et al., 2009; Li et al., 2010). In mammals, IRE1 exists in two isoforms, \u03b1 and \u03b2. IRE1\u03b1 is ubiquitously expressed, whereas IRE1\u03b2 expression is restricted to gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts (Bertolotti et al., 2001; Tsuru et al., 2013). Both IRE1 orthologs are trans-membrane kinase/nucleases that oligomerize in the ER-membrane in response to ER stress (Arag\u00f3n et al., 2009; Li et al., 2010). Oligomerization is crucial for IRE1 activation as it allows for trans-autophosphorylation and allosteric activation of its endonuclease domain, which for IRE1\u03b1 then initiates the unconventional splicing of the XBP1 mRNA (Arag\u00f3n et al., 2009; Cox et al., 1993; Cox and Walter, 1996; Korennykh et al., 2009; Li et al., 2010; Sidrauski and Walter, 1997; Yoshida et al., 1998; Yoshida et al., 2001). Spliced XBP1 mRNA encodes the transcription factor XBP1s, which activates the transcription of several target genes involved in restoring ER homeostasis (Acosta-Alvear et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2003). While the XBP1 mRNA is the only known splicing target of IRE1, active IRE1 can also cleave ER-localized mRNAs in a process known as regulated IRE1-dependent decay of messenger RNAs (RIDD), which serves to limit the amount of client proteins entering the ER, thus helping alleviate the folding stress (Hollien et al., 2009; Hollien and Weissman, 2006).\n\nTwo alternative models are used to describe how IRE1\u2019s lumenal domain senses ER stress: a recent model where unfolded proteins act directly as activating ligands and an earlier model where IRE1 lumenal domain is indirectly activated through dissociation of the ER-chaperone BiP.\n\nThe direct activation model emerged from the crystal structure of the core lumenal domain (cLD) from S. cerevisiae IRE1 (yIRE1; \u2018y\u2019 for yeast), where yIRE1 cLD dimers join via a 2-fold symmetric interface IF1L (\u2018L\u2019 for lumenal). A putative peptide-binding groove that architecturally resembles that of the major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs) extends across this interface (Credle et al., 2005). yIRE1 selectively binds a misfolded mutant of carboxypeptidase Y (Gly255Arg, CPY*) in vivo, and purified yIRE1 cLD directly interacts with peptides in vitro, leading to its oligomerization. Taken together, these observations support the model that direct binding of unfolded proteins in the ER lumen to IRE1 induces its oligomerization leading to IRE1 activation (Gardner and Walter, 2011).\n\nDue to structural differences between human and yeast IRE1 lumenal domains, it is not yet clear if this mechanism is also used by mammalian IRE1. Although the crystal structure of human IRE1\u03b1 (hIRE1\u03b1) cLD displays conserved structural elements in its core, there are several notable differences between the crystal structures of human and yeast IRE1 cLD known to date (Figure 1). First, the helices flanking the groove in yIRE1 cLD are too closely juxtaposed in the human structure to allow formation of the MHC-like groove present in the yeast (Zhou et al., 2006). Second, the yIRE1 cLD structure displays a second interface, IF2L, which provides contacts for higher order oligomerization, which was experimentally validated to be indispensable for yIRE1 activation in vivo (Figure 1). In the yIRE1 cLD, an \u03b1-helix\u2013turn region forms an important element in IF2L making contacts with the incomplete \u03b2-propeller in the neighboring protomer. Notably, the residues corresponding to the \u03b1-helix\u2013turn are not resolved in the hIRE1\u03b1 cLD crystal structure (aa V307-Y358). Instead, hIRE1\u03b1 cLD has two other symmetry mates in addition to the dimerization interface, which appear to be crystal lattice contacts that are predicted to be too energetically unstable to form biologically important oligomerization interfaces (Zhou et al., 2006). Indeed, the equivalent of an IF2L cannot form in the depicted hIRE1\u03b1 cLD structure because of a steric hindrance from a prominent \u03b1-helix (\u2018\u03b1B helix\u2019; aa V245-I263) that is absent in yIRE1 cLD (Figure 1) (Zhou et al., 2006).\n\nThe structural differences between IRE1 orthologs were cast to support the indirect model of IRE1 activation in higher eukaryotes (Zhou et al., 2006). This model poses that due to the aforementioned structural differences\u2014rather than direct unfolded protein binding\u2014it is the reversible dissociation of the ER-resident Hsp70-type chaperone BiP from IRE1\u2019s lumenal domain the main driving force regulating hIRE1\u03b1 activity (Zhou et al., 2006). According to this view, titration of BiP to unfolded proteins upon ER stress licenses IRE1 activation (Bertolotti et al., 2000; Carrara et al., 2015; Oikawa et al., 2009; Zhou et al., 2006). In yeast, however, this view has been experimentally refuted (Kimata et al., 2004; Pincus et al., 2010).\n\nConsidering the degree of conservation at various features of IRE1 mechanism of action from yeast to mammals, we favor the unifying direct activation model. Such model finds support in the notion that all structures adopted by a protein in a crystal lattice represent a singular snapshot of many possible conformational states. Therefore, it is entirely plausible that human and yeast IRE1 cLD use a common mechanism of activation and that the divergent structures aforementioned represent different states in a spectrum of possible conformational states that the IRE1 cLD from any species could assume. In this scenario, the crystal structure of hIRE1\u03b1 cLD represents a \u2018closed\u2019 conformation that can shift towards an \u2018open\u2019 state to allow peptide binding in the MHC-like groove that is apparent in the structure of the yeast ortholog (Video 1) (Gardner et al., 2013; Gardner and Walter, 2011). As such, this model predicts specific outcomes that can be experimentally tested. Specifically, that (i) human IRE1 \u03b1 cLD can bind to unfolded polypeptides, (ii) unfolded polypeptide binding stabilizes the open conformation of the hIRE1\u03b1 cLD, and (iii) the open conformation of hIRE1\u03b1 cLD favors its oligomerization.\n\nHere, we used complementary biochemical and structural approaches to experimentally explore the mechanism of human IRE1\u03b1 activation. We show that hIRE1\u03b1 cLD\u2014just like its yeast ortholog\u2014directly binds select peptides with a characteristic amino acid bias. State-of-the-art NMR experiments that probe dynamic conformational states further support an activation mechanism involving peptide binding to the MHC-like groove and stabilizing the open conformation of hIRE1\u03b1 cLD. Moreover, we provide insights into the mechanism that couples peptide binding and oligomerization to produce active IRE1 oligomers. Importantly, we show by mutational analysis that lumenal domain driven oligomerization is crucial for IRE1 function in mammalian cells. Taken together, our results resolve the discrepancies between existing models of IRE1 activation and supports a model in which unfolded polypeptides can bind and directly activate human IRE1.\n\nTo test whether, akin to yeast IRE1, mammalian IRE1 also binds unfolded proteins directly, we employed peptide tiling arrays. To identify hIRE1\u03b1 cLD-binding peptides, we designed tiling arrays utilizing ER-targeted model proteins known to induce the UPR either by overproduction (proinsulin and 8ab protein from SARS-corona virus [Scheuner et al., 2001; Sung et al., 2009]) or through destabilizing point mutations (myelin protein zero (MPZ)). The peptide arrays were composed by tiling 18-mer peptides that step through the entire protein sequence, shifting by three amino acids between adjacent spots. We incubated the peptide arrays with purified hIRE1\u03b1 cLD fused N-terminally to maltose-binding protein (MBP) and probed with an anti-MBP antibody. As shown in Figure 2A (left panel), MBP-hIRE1\u03b1 cLD bound a select subset of peptides on the arrays. To maximize the available sequence space, we analyzed binding of MBP-hIRE1\u03b1 cLD to these peptides irrespective of their topological accessibility in the ER lumen. hIRE1\u03b1 cLD recognized peptide sequences found in both the ER-lumenal and cytosolic domains of MPZ, which we considered together in our analyses to define the chemical properties of cLD peptide recognition. We found that hIRE1\u03b1 cLD-binding peptides with the top 10% binding scores were enriched in cysteine, tyrosine, tryptophan, and arginine (Figure 2B, Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A, p<0.05). By contrast, aspartate and glutamate were strongly disfavored, together with glutamine, valine, and serine.\n\nAt a first glance, the amino acid preferences displayed by mammalian IRE1 cLD resemble those of the other chaperones including the ER chaperone BiP (Blond-Elguindi et al., 1993; Deuerling et al., 2003; Flynn et al., 1991). Like BiP, hIRE1\u03b1 cLD favored binding to aromatic and positively charged residues (Blond-Elguindi et al., 1993; Otero et al., 2010). BiP is a highly abundant chaperone in the ER lumen, whereas IRE1 is present at orders of magnitude lower levels (Ghaemmaghami et al., 2003). Therefore, if IRE1 and BiP recognize the same regions of unfolded proteins, the peptide-binding activity of hIRE1\u03b1 cLD would depend entirely on saturation of BiP by unfolded substrate proteins\u2014a scenario difficult to reconcile with IRE1\u2019s task of dynamically sensing ER stress. To address this point, we compared the binding preferences of mammalian BiP (fused to an N-terminal 10x-histidine tag) on the same peptide arrays. We found sequences recognized by both hIRE1\u03b1 cLD and BiP (Figure 2A, Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A,B). Importantly, however, we also found profound differences. While IRE1 tolerated both prolines and histidines, BiP strongly disfavored these amino acids (Figure 2B, Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A, p<0.05). Conversely, BiP tolerated serine and threonines, while IRE1 strongly disfavored them. Thus, IRE1 can recognize regions of unfolded proteins to which BiP would not readily bind and vice versa, thereby providing a plausible explanation of how IRE1 could recognize unfolded proteins despite of the vast excess of BiP over hIRE1\u03b1 LD in the ER.\n\nTo measure binding affinities of hIRE1\u03b1 cLD\u2019s interaction with peptides in solution, we selected the two peptides with the highest binding scores in the peptide arrays (MPZ- and 8ab-derived peptides, henceforth referred to as \u2018MPZ1\u2019 and \u20188ab1\u2019, respectively) and attached fluorophores at their N-termini. Fluorescence anisotropy revealed that hIRE1\u03b1 cLD bound to MPZ1 with K1/2 = 24 \u00b1 4.7 \u00b5M and to 8ab1 with K1/2 = 5 \u00b1 1.7 \u00b5M (Figure 2C). (Note that we used K1/2 to denote a measure of affinity because, as we show below, hIRE1\u03b1 cLD exists in solution as an ensemble of different interconverting conformational states and our measurements therefore score several superimposed equilibria. The measured affinities therefore do not reflect true Kd values). These affinities fall within the same order of magnitude of chaperone binding to unfolded proteins, supporting the notion that similar modes of fast transient interactions with unfolded proteins are adopted by both IRE1 and chaperones (Karag\u00f6z et al., 2014; Marcinowski et al., 2011; Street et al., 2011).\n\nTo identify the minimal region in MPZ1 for binding to hIRE1\u03b1 cLD, we next divided MPZ1 into 12, 11 and 9 amino acid long fragments representing its N-terminal (MPZ1-N), middle (MPZ1-M) and C-terminal (MPZ1-C) regions and measured their respective affinities for hIRE1\u03b1 cLD. hIRE1\u03b1 cLD bound to MPZ1-N with a similar affinity as the full-length peptide (K1/2 = 16.0 \u00b1 2.6 \u00b5M, Figure 2D), whereas the other peptide fragments displayed much lower binding affinities (K1/2 = 377 \u00b1 54 \u00b5M and 572 \u00b1 107 \u00b5M, respectively, assuming similar maximum anisotropy values as for the MPZ1-N peptide). We further truncated MPZ1-N by two residues at a time from either its N- or C-terminus. Deleting amino acids from the C-terminus gradually decreased the affinity (Figure 2E). By contrast, deletion of the first two hydrophobic residues from the N-terminus (leucine and isoleucine) abolished its binding to hIRE1\u03b1 cLD (Figure 2F). These analyses revealed that the minimum peptide length with a comparable binding affinity to the full-length MPZ1 peptide is a 12-mer. This 12-mer peptide matches the chemical properties we found for hIRE1\u03b1 cLD-binding peptides: it is enriched in aromatics, hydrophobic amino acids and arginines, indicating that specific binding contacts play a role in hIRE1\u03b1 cLD\u2019s interaction with unfolded proteins.\n\nTo validate that peptides are valid surrogates for unfolded proteins, we next tested binding of intact but constitutively unfolded proteins to hIRE1\u03b1 cLD. Immunoglobulins (IgGs) mature in the ER using a well-characterized folding pathway, wherein the constant region domain of the IgG heavy chain (CH1) remains disordered until it binds to its cognate partner, the constant region domain of the IgG light chain CL (Feige et al., 2009). We measured the binding affinity of CH1 to hIRE1\u03b1 cLD by thermophoresis, which reports on changes in the hydration shell of a biomolecule upon interaction with a partner in solution (Jerabek-Willemsen et al., 2011). By contrast to earlier findings that showed no measurable binding of hIRE1\u03b1 cLD to CH1 under different experimental conditions (Carrara et al., 2015), our experiments showed that hIRE1\u03b1 cLD interacts with CH1 with a K1/2 = 29.2 \u00b1 1.2 \u00b5M (Figure 2G). To further validate this observation, we measured binding of hIRE1\u03b1 cLD to another model unfolded protein by fluorescence anisotropy, the folding mutant of staphylococcal nuclease \u0394131\u0394 (Street et al., 2011). We observed a comparable binding affinity of K1/2 = 21.4 \u00b1 2.3 \u00b5M (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2). Our data thus show that hIRE1\u03b1 cLD binds to full-length unfolded proteins with similar affinity as peptides, suggesting that these proteins display a distinct single binding site for hIRE1\u03b1 cLD.\n\nTo test whether multiple binding sites would increase the affinity for hIRE1\u03b1 cLD, we synthesized a peptide consisting of two MPZ1-N tandem repeats separated by a 5-amino acid spacer (MPZ1-N-2X). Intriguingly, MPZ1-N-2X bound to hIRE1\u03b1 cLD with an order of magnitude higher affinity (K1/2 = 0.456 \u00b1 0.07 \u00b5M) compared to MPZ1 peptide (Figure 2H). As we show below, the increased apparent affinity is due to avidity of hIRE1\u03b1 cLD to the peptide.\n\nTo capture evidence for structural rearrangements in hIRE1\u03b1 cLD predicted by a switch-mechanism that oscillates between inactive closed and active open conformations as we suggest in the Introduction, we employed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. NMR spectroscopy reveals structural information at the atomic level for dynamic protein complexes and is well suited to study structural changes in hIRE1\u03b1 cLD upon its interaction with peptides and unfolded proteins. The hIRE1\u03b1 cLD dimer is ~80 kDa and thus is well above the size limit for conventional NMR approaches. We therefore used methyl transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy (methyl-TROSY), a specific NMR method that allows to extract structural information from large proteins after selective isotopic labeling of side chain methyl groups with carbon-13 (13C) (Tugarinov et al., 2004; Tugarinov et al., 2007) in select amino acids including isoleucines. hIRE1\u03b1 cLD has 12 isoleucines per monomer, which are evenly distributed throughout the protein (Figure 3A). In hIRE1\u03b1 cLD\u2019s methyl-TROSY spectra, we resolved seven peaks corresponding to isoleucines (Figure 3B), which then served as sensors of peptide binding and accompanying conformational changes. All isoleucine peaks in hIRE1\u03b1 cLD\u2019s NMR spectrum displayed broad line widths (Figure 3B), which is indicative of chemical exchange resulting from hIRE1\u03b1 cLD sampling multiple conformational states at the conditions of the NMR experiments. These data revealed that hIRE1\u03b1 cLD is dynamic in solution.\n\nTo assign the resolved peaks to specific amino acids in the hIRE1\u03b1 cLD sequence, we mutated each isoleucine to leucine, alanine or valine and monitored the disappearance of each resolved peak in methyl-TROSY spectra of the mutant proteins. This approach allowed us to assign six isoleucine peaks unambiguously (Figure 3C,D, Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 1, 2 and 3). To further increase the number of NMR visible probes in hIRE1\u03b1 cLD, we mutated Leu186 and Thr159 to isoleucines (Figure 3E,F, Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C and F). Leu186 lies in an amphipathic unstructured loop surrounding the putative groove in hIRE1\u03b1 cLD. The Leu186Ile peak displayed high signal intensity consistent with a dynamic and flexible position (Figure 3F, Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1F). By contrast, Thr159 lies at the \u03b2-sheet floor in hIRE1\u03b1 cLD structure where its side chain faces towards the MHC-like groove and, as expected, the Thr159Ile substitution resulted in a low-intensity peak (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C).\n\nWe further enhanced the coverage of hIRE1\u03b1 cLD with NMR-visible probes in complementary experiments in which we labeled threonine side chains with 13C at their \u03b32 methyl groups (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4). There are 33 threonine residues in hIRE1\u03b1 cLD, 24 of which were detected by the NMR experiments. While we did not assign threonine peaks in hIRE1\u03b1 cLD spectrum due to high spectral crowding, they provided an additional \u2018fingerprint\u2019 reporting on peptide binding-induced changes in hIRE1\u03b1 cLD.\n\nNext, we used methyl-TROSY experiment to monitor changes in the environment of isoleucines and threonines in hIRE1\u03b1 cLD upon peptide binding. A largely overlapping subset of isoleucine and threonine peaks shifted when hIRE1\u03b1 cLD bound to the peptides MPZ1 or 8ab1, indicating a change in a localized environment upon peptide binding (Figure 4A,B, Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C). Yet, a subset of isoleucine and threonine peaks displayed peptide specific changes. The chemical shifts displayed by the isoleucine peaks were not very large yet reproducible upon binding of different peptides allowing us to probe peptide induced changes in hIRE1\u03b1 cLD. By contrast, the threonine peaks displayed larger chemical shifts, which is expected from their higher solvent exposure rendering them more sensitive to binding events (Figure 4B, Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B and C). Mapping the chemical shift perturbations of the isoleucine peaks upon peptide binding on the hIRE1\u03b1 cLD structure (Figure 4A\u2013E, Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B, Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2) revealed that the isoleucine resonances that shifted most significantly lie on the floor of the central \u03b2-sheet (marked by Ile124, Ile128, Thr159Ile) (Figure 4D and E). Among these isoleucines, only the side chain of Thr159Ile faces towards the MHC-like groove. We noted that in comparison to the isoleucines 124 and 128, Thr159Ile peak displayed a larger shift upon peptide binding (Figure 4C and E, Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1D). In addition to the central \u03b2-sheet floor, the \u03b1B helix that lies at the ends of hIRE1\u03b1 cLD dimer (marked by Ile263), and the \u03b2-sandwich connecting the \u03b2-sheet floor to the \u03b1B helix (marked by Ile52) were affected, albeit to a lesser extent. By contrast, the unstructured loop extending from the MHC-like groove (marked by Ile186) was only slightly affected and the isoleucines positioned in the flexible region that are not resolved in the crystal structure (marked by Ile326 and Ile334) did not shift (Figure 4D,E).\n\nImportantly, binding of the unfolded protein CH1 shifted the same peaks in the hIRE1\u03b1 cLD spectra as the short peptides suggesting peptides and unfolded protein chains interact with hIRE1\u03b1 cLD in a similar way (Figure 4F, Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2). Taken together, these results indicate that peptide as well as unfolded protein binding populate a distinct conformational state of hRE1\u03b1 cLD, consistent with a peptide-induced closed-to-open conformational transition. Moreover, the results are consistent with a model in which peptide binding induces conformational changes that propagate from the MHC-like groove via the \u03b2-sandwich to affect the regions involved in oligomerization.\n\nTo map the peptide-binding site in hIRE1\u03b1 cLD with higher precision, we employed paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) experiments (Gaponenko et al., 2000; Gillespie and Shortle, 1997) using MPZ1 modified with a nitroxide spin label, 3-(2-Iodoacetamido)-PROXYL, at cysteine residue, Cys5 (Figure 5A,B). The unpaired electron in the spin label broadens (in a range of 1 to 2.5 nm) or entirely erases (distances <1 nm) NMR signals in its vicinity in a distance dependent manner (Gottstein et al., 2012). Binding of the spin label attached peptide to hIRE1\u03b1 cLD would result in a decrease in the intensity of isoleucine peaks depending on their relative distance to the peptide-binding site. Therefore, we analyzed the changes in the intensities of all isoleucine signals upon binding of MPZ1-proxyl peptide to hIRE1\u03b1 cLD (Figure 5B, Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C). Binding of MPZ1-proxyl to hIRE1\u03b1 cLD erased the otherwise very strong signal of Leu186Ile and broadened that of Ile124 (Figure 5B\u2013D and Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C). Importantly, Ile128 and Ile263 signals, which shifted upon MPZ1 binding as discussed above (Figure 4E), broadened to a lesser extent, suggesting that these residues lie further from the peptide-binding site (Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C and D). Their resonances therefore shifted due to peptide-induced distant conformational rearrangements. Displaying the normalized PRE effect on hIRE1\u03b1 cLD structure revealed that MPZ1-proxyl binding mapped to the center of the MHC-like groove, suggesting that peptides bind to MHC-like groove and induce distant conformational changes in hIRE1\u03b1 cLD (Figure 5D).\n\nTo test whether the distant conformational changes in hIRE1\u03b1 cLD monitored by the NMR experiments are due to peptide binding-induced oligomerization, we employed analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) sedimentation velocity experiments to assess the oligomeric status of hIRE1\u03b1 cLD in the absence and presence of peptides. At the concentration range used at NMR experiments (25\u201375 \u00b5M), hIRE1\u03b1 cLD was found as a mixture of various oligomeric states, where the main peaks corresponded to dimers and tetramers (with higher amount of tetramers formed at higher concentrations, see Figure 6A). Notably, binding of MPZ1-N to hIRE1\u03b1 cLD at the NMR concentrations sharpened the tetramer peak and induced formation of larger oligomeric species in these experiments (Figure 6A). The peptide concentration used in these experiments does not saturate hIRE1\u03b1 cLD molecules based on a determined K1/2 of 16.0 \u00b1 2.6 \u00b5M, therefore only a small population of hIRE1\u03b1 cLD formed higher oligomers (depicted as the pink area) (Figure 6A).\n\nTo assess hIRE1\u03b1 cLD\u2019s oligomeric status at varying hIRE1\u03b1 cLD concentrations, we performed size exclusion chromatography and found that hIRE1\u03b1 cLD eluted at earlier fractions in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A). AUC data confirmed these findings and showed that at concentrations close to its dimerization constant of 2.5 \u00b5M, hIRE1\u03b1 cLD sediment as a single peak with a sedimentation coefficient corresponding to a mixture of monomers and dimers (Figure 6B, Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B). In this concentration regime (from 1 to 2.5 \u00b5M), the hIRE1\u03b1 cLD peak progressively shifted to higher sedimentation values with increasing hIRE1\u03b1 cLD concentration (Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B). Peptide binding to hIRE1\u03b1 cLD shifted the hIRE1\u03b1 cLD population to even higher sedimentation values (Figure 6B, blue trace), indicating that under these conditions peptide binding stabilized hIRE1\u03b1 cLD dimers and lead to the formation of oligomers.\n\nAs hIRE1\u03b1 cLD populated distinct oligomeric states in a concentration-dependent manner, we next compared the conformational state of hIRE1\u03b1 cLD at 5 \u00b5M (no higher-order oligomer formation detected by AUC) to 50 \u00b5M (based on Figure 6C, approximately 60% higher-order oligomer formation) by NMR spectroscopy to probe for the structural differences assumed by these two distinct states (Figure 6C,D). In these experiments, we relied on the high sensitivity of selective isoleucine labeling strategy, which could readily detect hIRE1\u03b1 cLD signals at concentrations as low as 5 \u00b5M (Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A,B).\n\nNotably and similar to effects observed upon peptide binding, oligomerization changed the environment of the \u03b1B helix (marked by Ile263) and the \u03b2-sandwich connecting the \u03b2-sheet floor to the \u03b1B helix (marked by Ile52) that both lie at the tips of hIRE1\u03b1 cLD dimers (Figure 6D,E, Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2C). These data suggest that these isoleucines are part of the oligomerization interface and/or that their conformational rearrangements are coupled to the formation of the interface. Moreover, NMR experiments showed chemical shifts in the isoleucines on the beta sheet floor of the groove (marked by Ile124 and Ile128) upon formation of higher oligomers (Figure 6E). These coupled, global conformational differences observed by NMR strongly underscore the notion that oligomeric hIRE1\u03b1 cLD adopts an active conformation and displays higher affinity for unfolded protein ligands. To address this notion, we set out to experimentally determine the oligomerization interface and then impair the oligomerization of hIRE1\u03b1 cLD by mutation.\n\nWe employed a chemical cross-linking strategy coupled to mass spectrometry to experimentally determine residues that map to the oligomerization interface in hIRE1\u03b1 cLD. To this end, we cross-linked hIRE1\u03b1 cLD in the presence and absence of peptides by a homobifunctional cross-linker, BS3 (bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate), which crosslinks primary amines mainly present in lysine side chains. Denaturing SDS-PAGE analysis of hIRE1\u03b1 cLD after cross-linking revealed that cross-linking captured oligomeric hIRE1\u03b1 cLD (Figure 7A, Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1). We separately isolated the bands corresponding to hIRE1\u03b1 cLD monomers, dimers and higher oligomers from the gel and analyzed peptides by mass spectrometry. We identified cross-linked peptides by accurate mass measurement of both candidate peptides and their fragment ions (Chu et al., 2010; Trnka et al., 2014). In comparative analyses, we separated intra- from inter-molecular cross-links by focusing on peaks that were present only in the covalent dimers and higher oligomers (Wu et al., 2013; Zeng-Elmore et al., 2014). These analyses revealed five abundant cross-links between lysines 120\u2022120, 53\u2022347, 53\u2022349, 53\u2022351 and 265\u2022351 (Figure 7A, Table 1).\n\nPrevious studies of BS3-cross-linked proteins with known crystal structures established that the distance between the \u03b1C atoms of cross-linked lysines is less than 28 \u00c5 for most cross-links but can be up to 33 \u00c5 for a few cases due to local protein flexibility (Leitner et al., 2010), in agreement with the additive lengths of the cross-linker itself plus twice the length of the lysine side chain. The Lys120\u2022120 cross-link maps to hIRE1\u03b1 cLD\u2019s dimerization interface (IF1L), whereas the four other cross-links are compatible with being positioned at hIRE1\u03b1 cLD oligomerization interface, IF2L. The cross-links Lys53\u2022347, Lys53\u2022349, Lys53\u2022351 and Lys265\u2022351 each involve one lysine residue (Lys53 and Lys263) that is close to the isoleucines (Ile52 and Ile263) that shifted upon hIRE1\u03b1 cLD oligomerization (Figure 6D,E), suggesting that they report on the formation of hIRE1\u03b1 cLD\u2019s putative oligomerization interface IF2L. Lys347, Lys349 and Lys351 are located in a region that was not resolved in hIRE1\u03b1 cLD crystal structure, suggesting that these regions are contributing to the formation of the oligomerization interface in hIRE1\u03b1 cLD.\n\nWe next threaded the sequence of hIRE1\u03b1 cLD into the yeast crystal structure of the oligomeric state, which fulfilled the distance restraints imposed by the cross-links (Figure 7B,C). This structural model predicted an extensive interface formed by hIRE1\u03b1 cLD oligomers that involves residues from parts of hIRE1 cLD that are not resolved in the crystal structure, as well as the incomplete \u03b2-propeller involved in the formation of the oligomerization interface in yeast Ire1 cLD (Figure 7C).\n\nWe used the predictive power of the structural model (hIRE1 cLD threaded into the yeast structure) to identify a patch of four hydrophobic residues WLLI (aa 359\u2013362) suggested to contribute to the hIRE1\u03b1 cLD oligomerization interface IF2L (Figure 7C, Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2). Assuming that these residues would be critical for oligomerization, we mutated them (WLLI359-362 to GSGS359-362; \u2018IF2L mutant\u2019) and assessed whether the hIRE1\u03b1 cLD IF2L mutant formed oligomers by AUC sedimentation velocity analysis. The experiments revealed that, at a concentration (50 \u00b5M) where wild type hIRE1\u03b1 cLD readily forms oligomers, the hIRE1\u03b1 cLD IF2L mutant sediment as a single dimeric peak, showing that the mutation prevents hIRE1\u03b1 cLD oligomerization (Figure 7D).\n\nTo assess whether hIRE1\u03b1 cLD IF2L mutant is functional, we tested peptide binding by fluorescent anisotropy experiments. The IF2L mutant bound MPZ1-N and MPZ1-N-2X peptide at similar affinities to the wild type protein (with K1/2 = 5.4 \u00b1 1.4 \u00b5M and K1/2 = 0.95 \u00b1 0.4 \u00b5M, respectively) (Figure 7E, Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3A). These results indicated that hIRE1\u03b1 cLD dimer is the functional unit for peptide binding and that hIRE1\u03b1 cLD oligomers do not display a higher affinity conformation. Moreover, they also showed that the avidity effect that resulted in higher affinity binding of MPZ1-N-2X peptide to hIRE1\u03b1 cLD does not require formation of higher hIRE1\u03b1 cLD oligomers. AUC data confirmed these analyses and showed that binding of MPZ1-N-2X to hIRE1\u03b1 cLD IF2Lmutant stabilized dimer formation but did not lead to formation of oligomers bridged by MPZ1-N-2X peptide (Figure 7E, Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3B and C).\n\nThe hIRE1\u03b1 cLD IF2L mutant therefore enabled us to decouple peptide induced allosteric communication from the formation of oligomers, both of which could have contributed to the shift of the isoleucine peaks in the NMR experiments. To address this notion, we repeated the NMR experiments with the IF2L mutant (Figure 7F, Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 4A\u2013C). Similar to WT hIRE1\u03b1 cLD, MPZ1-N peptide binding to hIRE1\u03b1 cLD IF2L mutant shifted isoleucines in the \u03b2-sheet floor (marked by Ile124 and Ile128) (Figure 7F and G, Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 4B and C). Importantly, isoleucine peaks (Ile52 and Ile263) close to the oligomerization interfaces also shifted upon peptide binding to the hIRE1\u03b1 cLD IF2L mutant. Thus peptide binding-induced conformational changes in isoleucines distant to the peptide binding site persisted in the hIRE1\u03b1 cLD IF2L mutant. Interestingly, MPZ1-N-2X binding shifted isoleucine peaks in the same direction and to a similar extent as binding of MPZ1-N, indicating that hIRE1\u03b1 cLD IF2L binds to the same site in these peptides (Figure 7G, Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 4B and C). These data suggest that the increased affinity of MPZ1-N-2X is due to a decreased rate of dissociation of the peptide.\n\nTo test the importance of lumenal domain driven oligomerization for hIRE1\u03b1 function in vivo, we generated cell lines that stably express hIRE1\u03b1 IF2L mutant as the only form of hIRE1\u03b1. To this end, we introduced the hIRE1\u03b1 IF2L mutant into mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) deficient for both isoforms of IRE1 (IRE1\u03b1\u2212/\u2212/IRE1\u03b2\u2212/\u2212). In addition, we attached a GFP tag to IRE1\u2019s cytoplasmic flexible linker retaining its function as published previously for HEK293 cells (Li et al., 2010). In parallel, we introduced hIRE1\u03b1-GFP to IRE1\u03b1\u2212/\u2212/IRE1\u03b2\u2212/\u2212 MEFs to compare hIRE1\u03b1 activity at similar conditions. In these cell lines, we controlled hIRE1\u03b1 expression via a doxycycline-inducible promoter. In the absence of doxycycline, cells expressed low levels of hIRE1\u03b1 due to the leakiness of the promoter. In those conditions, the expression level of the hIRE1\u03b1-GFP-IF2L mutant was similar to hIRE1\u03b1-GFP and to the level of endogenous IRE1\u03b1 from wild-type MEFs, as assessed by Western blot analysis (Figure 8A,B).\n\nWe next monitored the XBP1 mRNA splicing activity of IRE1 in IRE1\u03b1\u2212/\u2212/IRE1\u03b2\u2212/\u2212 MEFs harboring hIRE1\u03b1-GFP or hIRE1\u03b1-GFP-IF2L mutant (Figure 8C). We found that unlike hIRE1\u03b1-GFP, hIRE1\u03b1-GFP-IF2L mutant did not splice XBP1 mRNA after induction of ER stress by tunicamycin, a chemical stressor that impairs ER-folding homeostasis by inhibiting N-linked glycosylation (Figure 8C, Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1) (Heifetz et al., 1979). IRE1\u2019s RNase activity is preceded by the autophosphorylation of its kinase domain, which can be monitored by a phospho-specific antibody. Western blot analysis showed no signal corresponding to phospho-IRE1 in the IRE1\u03b1\u2212/\u2212/IRE1\u03b2\u2212/\u2212 cells expressing hIRE1\u03b1--GFP-IF2L, by contrast to the same cells reconstituted with wild type hIRE1\u03b1-GFP, or in contrast to wild type MEFs, in which we detected phosphorylation of the endogenous protein (Figure 8B, Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2). Lastly, confocal microscopy revealed that under ER stress conditions where hIRE1\u03b1-GFP readily formed foci (>70%, n = 88, Figure 8D, Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 3A), reflecting its assembly into active oligomers, the hIRE1\u03b1-GFP-IF2L mutant failed to do so (Figure 8D, Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 3B and C). These data confirmed that cLD-mediated oligomerization is crucial for IRE1 function in cells.\n\nTo date, the mechanism by which mammalian IRE1 senses ER stress has remained controversial. Here, we provide evidence that activation of human IRE1\u03b1 occurs via direct recognition of unfolded proteins and that the mechanism of ER stress sensing is conserved from yeast to mammals. This conclusion is based on six independent lines of evidence. First, we found that hIRE1\u03b1 cLD binds peptides with a characteristic amino acid bias. Second, NMR spectroscopy suggested that peptides bind to hIRE1\u03b1 cLD\u2019s MHC-like groove and induce a conformational change including the distant \u03b1B helix. In this way, occupation of the peptide-binding groove is allosterically communicated, which, we propose, culminates in the formation of a functional oligomerization interface corresponding to IF2L in yIRE1 cLD. Third, binding of minimal-length peptides induces formation of hIRE1\u03b1 cLD oligomers as assessed by AUC analyses, further supporting this notion. Fourth, cross-linking experiments captured the oligomerization interfaces, which allowed identification of a functionally crucial hydrophobic patch at IF2L. Fifth, mutation of this patch uncoupled peptide binding from oligomerization but retained the allosteric coupling within the domain. Sixth, impairing the oligomerization of hIRE1\u03b1 cLD abolished IRE1\u2019s activity in living cells, attesting to the physiological relevance of the activation mechanism proposed here.\n\nTaken together, our data converge on a model (Figure 9) in which unfolded protein-binding activates a switch in hIRE1\u03b1\u2019s cLD, leading to rearrangements that render it compatible with the formation of IF2L and therefore stabilizing an active oligomeric conformation (Video 1). cLD-mediated oligomerization on the lumenal side of the ER, in turn, would juxtapose hIRE1\u03b1\u2019s cytosolic kinase domains in the face-to-face confirmation allowing its trans-autophosphorylation, followed by stacking of its RNase domains in back-to-back orientation. These conformational rearrangements then lead to RNase activation, and thus allowing information flow across the ER membrane. Interestingly, our data show that impairment of lumenal domain oligomerization diminished IRE1\u2019s both RNase and kinase activities in cells.\n\nCurrently due to lack of biochemical and structural understanding of IRE1\u2019s interaction with the ER-resident chaperone BiP, its role in regulating IRE1 activity remains unknown. Although it is clear that BiP is released from IRE1 upon ER stress (Bertolotti et al., 2000), current models proposing BiP as the primary regulator of IRE1 activity do not address how active IRE1 oligomers would form (Carrara et al., 2015; Oikawa et al., 2009; Zhou et al., 2006). By contrast, our data indicate that peptide-binding is important for lumenal domain-driven IRE1 oligomerization, leading to its activation. We therefore consider it most plausible that BiP binding modulates the response via tuning IRE1\u2019s oligomerization equilibrium, similar to what was shown for the yeast counterpart (Pincus et al., 2010). In this way, BiP binding would buffer IRE1 activity at the early stages of the ER stress when the chaperones are not overwhelmed by the unfolded protein load, and during the deactivation phase, when the protein folding homeostasis is achieved. In this scenario, unfolded protein accumulation exerts synergistic effects on IRE1 activation, simultaneously freeing more IRE1 from BiP upon ER stress and inducing IRE1\u2019s oligomerization/activation through their direct binding to the sensor (Pincus et al., 2010).\n\nDespite these profound similarities in the salient features of ER stress sensing and processing, yeast and human IRE1\u03b1 cLD display some distinct oligomerization properties. Whereas yIRE1 cLD precipitously assembles into larger oligomers at concentrations that exceed its dimerization constant (Gardner and Walter, 2011), hIRE1\u03b1 cLD forms discrete dimers, which in a concentration-dependent manner gradually assemble into tetramers. hIRE1\u03b1 cLD oligomers are in a dynamic equilibrium of different states, apparent from our size exclusion chromatography and AUC analyses and hIRE1\u03b1 cLD forms even larger oligomers when bound to peptides. These observations are consistent with the model that the \u03b1B helix, which may hinder formation of hIRE1\u03b1 oligomers as previously suggested (Zhou et al., 2006) participates in conformational changes that release its block on oligomerization. At higher hIRE1\u03b1 cLD concentrations, the conformational equilibrium of the \u03b1B helix is shifted towards the active state. Peptide binding allosterically releases this inhibition and stabilizes the active hIRE1\u03b1 oligomers. We anticipate that the effect of peptide binding-induced oligomerization would be more pronounced under physiological conditions, where hIRE1\u03b1 is tethered to ER-membrane with diffusion limited to two dimensions.\n\nWe speculate that the conformational change in the \u03b1B helix allows the incomplete \u03b2-propeller to form contacts with the residues from the flexible region, which is not resolved in the crystal structure (V307-Y358) forming the oligomerization interface in hIRE1\u03b1 cLD. In this conformation, \u03b1B helix may provide additional contact sites contributing to the oligomerization interface. Interestingly, one of the symmetry mates captured by hIRE1\u03b1 cLD crystal structure shows contacts of the \u03b1B helix with the hydrophobic stretch (359WLLI362), which we show to be important for oligomerization. We anticipate that in addition to this hydrophobic stretch, additional contacts contributed by these flexible parts may further facilitate oligomer formation.\n\nhIRE1\u03b1 cLD\u2019s groove is enriched in aromatic residues and displays a negatively charged surface. In this way, the amino acids lining the groove chemically complement hIRE1\u03b1 cLD binding peptides identified in our study, which are enriched in aromatics and arginines. In the crystal structure of hIRE1\u03b1 cLD in the \u2018closed\u2019 conformation, the \u03b1-helices forming the MHC-like groove are close together and mask the residues on the \u03b2-sheet floor. When these helices are moved approximately 6 \u00c5 apart from one another, the groove deepens and exposes more hydrophobicity mostly contributed by newly exposed aromatic residues. Thus, opening the groove exposes surface chemistry that is conducive to IRE1 binding peptides. Our data support a model in which widening of the groove is allosterically coupled to the formation of the IF2L-like oligomerization interfaces.\n\nWe showed that a 12-mer peptide is the shortest derivative of MPZ1 peptide that binds hIRE1\u03b1 cLD with undiminished affinity when compared to the original 21-mer peptide, indicating that a 12-mer provides maximal contact with cognate interfaces in hIRE1\u03b1 cLD groove. It is plausible that similar to MHC molecules, select amino acids in unfolded polypeptides act as \u2018anchor residues\u2019 providing contact sites for hIRE1 \u03b1 cLD binding (Fremont et al., 1992; Matsumura et al., 1992; Wilson and Fremont, 1993). Notably, assuming an extended peptide backbone with an average length of 3.4 \u00c5 per peptide bond, a 12-mer peptide can fit without constraints into the 39 \u00c5-long groove in the structural model presented here. This notion suggests that the groove ensures preferential binding of fully exposed, unfolded 39\u00c5-stretch of a polypeptide chain. This recognition principle is therefore similar to that of Hsp70-type chaperones, where the structural constraints in the cavity of the substrate-binding domain allow interaction with the substrates only in their extended, unfolded conformation, although Hsp70 only binds a seven amino acids stretch (R\u00fcdiger et al., 1997a; R\u00fcdiger et al., 1997b).\n\nSupporting the notion of mechanistic similarities in unfolded protein recognition between chaperone proteins and IRE1, hIRE1\u03b1 cLD and the ER-resident chaperone BiP bind partially overlapping as well as distinct sets of peptides tested in our peptide arrays, as previously shown for the orthologous yeast proteins (Gardner and Walter, 2011). Importantly, the presence of distinct hIRE1\u03b1 cLD binding peptides liberates IRE1 from an otherwise inevitable failure to compete with highly abundant BiP for binding sites in unfolded proteins. hIRE1\u03b1 cLD\u2019s affinity for peptides measured here varied between 5 and 30 \u00b5M, which is within the same order of magnitude but at the lower range of those reported for most chaperones (Karag\u00f6z et al., 2014; Marcinowski et al., 2011; Street et al., 2011). For example, hIRE1\u03b1 cLD binds the IgG\u2019s CH1 unfolded domain with ~30 \u00b5M affinity whereas BiP was shown to bind the same protein with ~7 \u00b5M (Marcinowski et al., 2011). We surmise that this difference has been selected in evolution to set the threshold for unfolded protein recognition slightly higher for the UPR sensors when compared to that of chaperones so that the UPR is not triggered until a critical concentration of unfolded proteins accumulates. Moreover, our data with the MPZ1-N-2X peptide suggested that IRE1 could display higher affinity for select polypeptides that present more than a single IRE1 binding site.\n\nIRE1 dysfunction contributes to the development of numerous diseases, including cancer (such as multiple myeloma [Mimura et al., 2012]), metabolic disorders (such as obesity and diabetes [Fonseca et al., 2009; Hotamisligil, 2010]) and neurodegenerative diseases (such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Hungtinton\u2019s disease [Hetz et al., 2009; Matus et al., 2009; Vidal et al., 2012]). Depending on the disease context, IRE1 makes life or death decisions in response to altered ER function manifested in these pathological conditions (Walter P. and D., 2011). Our data showing that unfolded proteins stabilize a distinct IRE1 conformation suggest novel approaches to manipulate IRE1 pharmacologically. For example, it will be promising to design or screen for small molecule modulators that lock IRE1\u2019s groove in the open or closed conformation based on the chemical signature of the IRE1 binding peptides identified here. Such compounds could act as agonists or antagonists of IRE1 activity. As such, it should be possible to develop new classes of pharmaceuticals to induce or inhibit the IRE1 branch of the UPR, driving the desired IRE1 output depending on the disease context.\n\nSynthetic peptides were ordered from Elim Biosciences and GenScript at >95% purity.\n\nTo express MBP-hIRE1\u03b1 cLD (aa 24\u2013389), human IRE1\u03b1 cDNA sequences were cloned into a pMalC2p vector to create a hIRE1\u03b1 cLD fused on its N-terminus to MBP. To express His10-hIRE1\u03b1 cLD, hIRE1\u03b1 cLD was cloned into pet16b(+) vector containing a FactorXa protease cleavage site. Additionally, His10-hIRE1\u03b1 cLD and IRE1 LD coding sequences were cloned into pet47b(+) vector with a preScission protease cleavage site. Hamster BiP with an N-terminal His10-tag was cloned into pet16b(+) vector, which was modified to introduce a preScission protease site C-terminal to the His10-tag. For expression of the proteins, the plasmid of interest was transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21DE3* RIPL (Agilent Technologies) or Rosetta2 cells (Novagen). Cells were grown in Luria Broth at 37\u00b0C until OD600 = 0.6. Protein expression was induced with 0.3 mM IPTG, and cells were grown at 21\u00b0C overnight. For selective labeling, cells were grown according to published protocols (Tugarinov and Kay, 2004). Briefly, cells were grown at minimal media in D2O supplemented with deuterated glucose as the primary carbon source. For purification, cells were resuspended in Lysis Buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.2, 400 mM NaCl, 4 mM dithiothreitol (DTT)(or 5 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, if a nickel column was used)) and were lysed in an Avestin EmulsiFlex-C3 cell disruptor at 16,000 psi. The supernatant was collected after centrifugation for 40 min at 30,000xg. MBP-IRE1 cLD constructs were purified on an MBP-amylose resin (New England Biolabs) and eluted with 10 mM amylose in Elution Buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 4 mM DTT) after washing the column with 20 column volumes of Lysis Buffer. The eluate was then diluted with 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.2) buffer to 50 mM NaCl and applied to a MonoQ ion exchange column and eluted with a linear gradient from 50 mM to 1 M NaCl. The protein was further purified on a Superdex 200 10/300 gel filtration column equilibrated with Buffer A (25 mM HEPES pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM tris(2carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP). The initial purification of His6- and His10-hIRE1\u03b1 cLD and His10-BiP constructs were performed on a His-TRAP column (GE Healthcare), where the protein was eluted with gradient from 20 mM to 500 mM imidazole. The eluate was purified on a MonoQ column, before the His6-tag (pet47b+) or His10-tag (pet16b+) were removed by either PreScission protease (GE Healthcare, 1 unit of enzyme for 100 \u00b5g of protein) or FactorXa (NEB, 1 \u00b5g of FactorXa per 100 \u00b5g of protein), respectively. The tag removal was performed at 4o C overnight after the protein concentration was adjusted to 1 mg/mL. CH1 domain of IgG was purified under reducing conditions as described (Feige et al., 2009). Protein concentrations were determined using extinction coefficient at 280 nm predicted by the Expasy ProtParam tool (http://web.expasy.org/protparam/).\n\nPeptide arrays were purchased from the MIT Biopolymers Laboratory. The tiling arrays were composed of 18-mer peptides that were tiled along the CPY*, MPZ, insulin, lysozyme and PTIP sequences with a three amino acid shift between adjacent spots. In the mutational arrays, peptides were synthesized to systematically mutate each amino acid in the core region of the CPY*-derived peptide. The arrays were incubated in 100% methanol for 10 min, then in Binding Buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 0.02% Tween-20, 2 mM DTT) three times for 10 min each. For BiP experiments, ADP and MgCl2 were added to the binding buffer to final concentrations of 1 mM and 5 mM, respectively. The arrays were then incubated for 1 hr at room temperature with 500 nM MBP-hIRE1\u03b1 cLD or His10-BiP and washed again three times with 10 min incubation in between the washes in Binding Buffer to remove any unbound protein. Using a semi-dry transfer apparatus, the bound protein was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and detected with anti-MBP antiserum (NEB) or anti-His6 antibody (Abcam). The contribution of each amino acid to hIRE1\u03b1 cLD and BiP binding was calculated as described previously (Gardner and Walter, 2011). The peptide arrays were quantified using Max Quant. The binding intensity in each spot was normalized to max signal intensity in the peptide array. The peptides with the top 10% binding scores were selected and the occurrence of each amino acid in these top-binding peptides was calculated. This value is normalized to their abundance in the arrays (Figure 2A). To calculate experimental error, the amino acid occurrences of top binders were calculated for independent replicates. The statistical significance (p<0.05) is determined using non-paired t-test by the Prism software (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A).\n\nFor fluorescence anisotropy measurements, MPZ1 peptide attached to 5-carboxyfluorescein (5-FAM) at its C-terminus was obtained at >95% purity from ELIM Biopharmaceuticals. For the remaining peptides (8ab1, MPZ1-N, MPZ1-M, MPZ1-C and MPZ1-N) derivatives were synthesized with 5-FAM attached to their N-terminus by GenScript at >95% purity. Binding affinities of hIRE1\u03b1 cLD or IRE1 mutants to FAM-labeled peptides were measured by the change in fluorescence anisotropy on a Spectramax-M5 plate reader with excitation at 485 nm and emission at 525 nm with increasing concentrations of hIRE1\u03b1 cLD. Fluorescently labeled peptides were used in a concentration range of 50\u2013100 nM. The reaction volume of each data point was 20 \u00b5L and the measurements were performed in 384-well, black flat-bottomed plates after incubation of peptide with hIRE1\u03b1 cLD or its mutants for 30 min at 25o C. Binding curves were fitted using Prism Software (GraphPad) using the following equation: Fbound = rfree + (rmax- rfree)/(1 + 10((LogK1/2-X)\u2022nH)), where Fbound is the fraction of peptide bound, rmax and rfree are the anisotropy values at maximum and minimum plateaus, respectively. nH is the Hill coefficient and x is the concentration of the protein in log scale. Curvefitting was performed with minimal constraints to obtain K1/2 values with high R2 values. However, as this equation does not take into account the equilibria between hIRE1\u03b1 cLD dimers/oligomers, these apperant K1/2 values do not reflect the dissociation constant.\n\nMST experiments were performed with a Monolith NT.115 instrument (NanoTemper Technologies, Germany). All experiments were done with the following buffer: 25 mM HEPES pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP, 0.025% Tween-20. hIRE1\u03b1 cLD was labeled using the Monolith NT Protein labeling Kit Red-Maleimide. Labeled protein was used in the measurements at a concentration of 50 nM. It was mixed with equal volumes unlabeled interaction partner in two-fold serial dilutions. Hydrophilic-treated capillaries (NanoTemper Technologies) were used for all the measurements. All experiments were performed at 50% LED power and 40-60\u201380% IR-laser at 25\u00b0C.\n\nSedimentation velocity experiments were carried out in a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical centrifuge at 40,000xg at 20\u00b0C with An-60 Ti rotor. All experiments were performed in buffer containing 25 mM HEPES pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT. Samples (400 \u00b5L) and reference buffer (410 \u00b5L) were loaded into AUC cells for each experiment. Samples of hIRE1\u03b1 cLD at 5 \u00b5M were scanned at 280 nm, whereas hIRE1\u03b1 cLD at concentrations higher than 25 \u00b5M were scanned at 290 nm to prevent detector saturation at high protein concentrations. Data analysis was performed using the SEDFIT software employing the c(s) method with time invariant and radial invariant noise fitting (Schuck, 2000). Buffer viscosity was calculated by Sednterp.\n\nNMR experiments were performed on an 800 MHz Bruker AVANCE-I spectrometer with a TXI Cryoprobe equipped with an actively shielded Z-gradient at 298.0 K. Samples were buffer-exchanged into 25 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl and 2 mM DTT in 100% D2O on Vivaspin columns (Millipore). The concentration of WT hIRE1\u03b1 cLD and hIRE1\u03b1 cLD mutants varied from 25 to 400 \u00b5M in 250 \u00b5L volume. Samples were placed in a Shigemi advanced NMR microtube. For peptide and unfolded protein binding experiments, the peptides were dissolved in the same buffer at high concentrations (1\u20132 mM) and titrated in 1:0.5, 1:1 and 1:2 molar ratios. Two-dimensional [13C, 1 H]-HMQC methyl correlation experiments on 13CH3\u2013Ile hIRE1\u03b1 cLD were acquired with 86* and 768* complex points in the 13C and 1H dimensions, respectively. All spectra were processed with TOPSPIN 3.2 and analyzed with Sparky.\n\nMPZ1 peptide at 200 \u00b5M was labeled with 3-(2-iodoacetamido)-proxyl (Sigma) at the single cysteine, Cys5 in 25 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl in the presence of 2 mM spin-label at 4\u00b0C for 8 hr. The labeled peptide was then dialyzed in a Slide-a-Lyzer dialysis cassette (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 2 kDa cut-off to remove the excess spin-label and to exchange the buffer to deuterated buffer (25 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT) for NMR experiments. Control samples used in the reference experiments contained (1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrroline-3-methyl) methanethiosulfonate spin-label that was treated the same way as the proxyl-labeled peptide. Wild type hIRE1\u03b1 cLD and quadruple mutant hIRE1\u03b1 cLD (Leu186Ile, Ile326/334/362Val) and single mutant Leu186Ile were used in PRE experiments at 75 \u00b5M and 100 \u00b5M protein concentration respectively, in the presence and absence of equimolar concentrations of MPZ1-proxyl peptide. We normalized the PRE effect with the surface exposed area displayed by that isoleucine to exclude possible contributions from non-specific interactions with the spin label attached peptide (Clore and Iwahara, 2009). The normalized PRE values are calculated as follows, the solvent accessible surface area for isoleucines are calculated using the \u2018GETAREA\u2019 webserver (http://curie.utmb.edu/getarea.html, [Fraczkiewicz and Braun, 1998]) based on hIRE1\u03b1 cLD crystal structure. The maximum solvent accessible surface by these isoleucines is normalized to one and the normalized values are multiplied with the PRE effect. The PRE effect is calculated by dividing the intensity of isoleucine signals in the control experiments with the isoleucine signals in the presence of MPZ1-proxyl peptide.\n\n10 \u00b5M, 20 \u00b5M and 50 \u00b5M hIRE1\u03b1 cLD was incubated with 500 \u00b5M and 1 mM BS3 cross-linker for 15 and 30 min at room temperature. Same reaction was performed for hIRE1 cLD pre-bound to 50 \u00b5M MPZ1-N for 30 min on ice. The reaction was stopped with the addition of 1M Tris-HCl at pH 8.0 at end concentration of 50 mM Tris-HCl, and incubated for 10 min at room temperature before running the SDS-PAGE gel.\n\nCross-linked products were in-gel digested and analyzed by LC-MS and LC-MS-MS as described previously (Wu et al., 2013; Zeng-Elmore et al., 2014). Briefly, 1 \u03bcl aliquot of the digestion mixture was injected into an Dionex Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano UHPLC system (Dionex Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA), and separated by a 75 \u03bcm \u00d7 25 cm PepMap RSLC column (100 \u00c5, 2 \u00b5m) at a flow rate of ~450 nl/min. The eluant was connected directly to a nanoelectrospray ionization source of an LTQ Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). LC-MS data were acquired in an information-dependent acquisition mode, cycling between a MS scan (m/z 315\u20132,000) acquired in the Orbitrap, followed by low-energy CID analysis on three most intense multiply charged precursors acquired in the linear ion trap.\n\nCross-linked peptides were identified using an integrated module in Protein Prospector, based on a bioinformatic strategy described previously (Chu et al., 2010; Trnka et al., 2014). The score of a cross-linked peptide was based on number and types of fragment ions identified, as well as the sequence and charge state of the cross-linked peptide. Only results where the score difference is greater than 0 (i.e. the cross-linked peptide match was better than a single peptide match alone) are considered. Tandem MS spectra of cross-linked peptides were manually inspected to ensure data quality. With the threshold of peptide score and expectation value for oligomer-only cross-linked peptides, no decoy match was returned.\n\nThe coding sequence of wild type GFP-tagged IRE1 (Li et al., 2010) was amplified by PCR with Phsuion polymerase (NEB) and oligonucleotides with engineered restriction sites. The PCR product was introduced into the Gateway entry vector pSHUTTLE-CMV-TO (kind gift of A. Ashkenazi, Genentech and (Gray et al., 2007) atcognate KpnI and EcoRI sites. The hIRE1\u03b1-GFP- IF2L mutant was generated in pSHUTTLE-CMV-TO by site directed mutagenesis of the wild-type sequence. The resulting clones were recombined into pGpHUSH.puro (kind gift of A. Ashkenazi, Genentech and [Gray et al., 2007]), a single lentivirus expression vector that allows the doxycyline-regulatable (TetON) expression of a gene-of-interest. VSV-G pseudotyped lentiviral particles were prepared using standard protocols using 293METR packaging cells (kind gift of Brian Ravinovich, formerly at MD Anderson Cancer Center, [Rabinovich et al., 2006]). Viral supernatants were concentrated by filtration (Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter device, 100 kDa MWCO) and used to infect target cells by centrifugal inoculation (spinoculation) at 2000 rpm inn a Beckman GH3.8 rotor outfitted with plate carriers for 90 min in presence of 8 ug/mL polybrene. The cells were left to recover overnight following infection and were then subjected to puromycin selection as described below.\n\nIRE1 double-knockout Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEF) (IRE1\u03b1\u2212/\u2212/IRE1\u03b2\u2212/\u2212) and wild-type MEFs (kind gift of D. Ron, University of Cambridge). were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were not tested for the mycoplasma contamination. Lentiviral-transduced cells were selected with 6 \u00b5g/mL puromycin for 72 hr based on the puromycin concentration defined by the kill curve. Subsequently, a pulse of 25 nM doxycycline was given to induce expression of the GFP-tagged IRE1 transgenes for 10\u201312 hr. The following day, the doxycycline was washed out and pseudoclonal cell populations were selected by fluorescent activated cell sorting based on GFP expression for both wild-type (hIRE1\u03b1-GFP) and IF2L mutant (hIRE1\u03b1-GFP-IF2L mutant) forms of IRE1. The cells were selected in a FACS Aria instrument (BD FACSAria3), gating for a very narrow GFP expressing population. This procedure ensures selection of a pseudoclonal population where most cells have similar levels of expression of the transgene of interest while avoiding typical problems associated with monoclonal selection of IRE1-expressing cells; namely an aberrant UPR. The pseudoclonal populations were expanded and frozen as source stocks for experiments.\n\nIRE1 double-knockout MEFs (IRE1\u03b1\u2212/\u2212/IRE1\u03b2\u2212/\u2212) reconstituted with of hIRE1\u03b1 -GFP or hIRE1\u03b1-GFP-IF2L mutant were split 2 days before imaging onto ibiTreat dishes (ibidi) at 5 \u00d7 104 cells/dish. 25 nM Doxyccline containing medium was added for 10\u201312 hr, withdrawn before imaging and replaced with imaging media consisting of Fluorobrite DMEM (Thermo Scientific), 2.5% FBS, and 5 mM Hepes at a pH of 7.0 . Cells were imaged at 37oC on a spinning disk confocal with Yokogawa CSUX A1 scan head, Andor iXon EMCCD camera and 40x Plan Apo air Objective NA 0.95 with a 1.5x tube lens for additional magnification giving 60x final or 100X objective. Images were acquired using 488 nm laser at a rate of one frame per 3 min with 300 ms exposure time for each time point for an hour. Images were collected after different time points following induction of ER stress by tunicamycin (5 \u00b5g/mL) or thapsigargin (100 nM).\n\nIRE1 double-knockout MEFs (IRE1\u03b1\u2212/\u2212/IRE1\u03b2\u2212/\u2212) reconstituted with of hIRE1\u03b1 -GFP and hIRE1\u03b1-GFP-IF2L mutant were grown similar to live cell imaging experiments. After stress induction at various time points, cells were washed three times with PBS followed by 3 min fixation with 100% methanol, and a three subsequent 5 min washes with PBS. As these fixation conditions kept GFP intact, immunostaining of hIRE1\u03b1 for fluorescence imaging was not required. DAPI staining is performed according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Thermo Fisher).\n\nCells exposed to DMSO or thapsigargin (100 nM) or tunicamycin (5 \u00b5g/ml) were collected in 0.5 ml of TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies) from a six well dish and total RNA was extracted following the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. To generate cDNAs, 500 ng of total RNA were reverse transcribed using the SuperScript VILO system (Life Technologies) following the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. The resulting 20 \u00b5l reverse transcription reactions were diluted to 10 times to 200 \u00b5l with 10 mM Tris\u2013 HCl pH 8.2, and 1% of this dilution was used for multiplex semiquantitative PCR. The multiplex PCR was set up using 1 \u00b5M of the forward reverese primers, 0.4 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Thermo Scientific), 0.2 mM of each dNTP, and 1.5 mM MgCl2, in a 20 \u00b5l reaction using the following buffer system: 75 mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 8.8, 20 mM (NH4)SO4, and 0.01% Tween-20. The oligonucleotide sequences are the following: Hs_XBP1_Fwd: 50 -GGAGTT AAGACAGCGCTTGG-30; Hs_XBP1_Rev: 50 -ACTGGGTCCAAGTTG TCCAG-30. The PCR products were amplified for 28 cycles and resolved on 3% agarose gels (1:1 mixture of regular and low-melting point agarose) stained with ethidium bromide.\n\nCells were lysed in SDS-PAGE loading buffer (1% SDS, 62.5 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 10% glycerol). Lysates were sonicated and equal amounts were loaded on SDS-PAGE gels (BioRad, Hercules, CA). Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and probed with primary antibodies diluted in Phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20% and 5% bovine serum albumin at 4\u00b0C, overnight. The following antibodies were used: anti-IRE1 (1:1000) (14C10, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), anti-GAPDH (1:1000) (14C10, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA and anti-phosho IRE1 antibody(1:500). IRE1 anti-phospho antibody is a kind gift of Avi Ashkenazi\u2019s group at Genentech. An HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ) was employed to detect immunereactive bands using enhanced chemiluminescence (SuperSignal; Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) detected by Li-Cor instrument (Li-Core Biosciences)."}
