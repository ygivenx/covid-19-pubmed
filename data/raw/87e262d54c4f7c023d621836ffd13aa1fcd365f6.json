{"title": "HHS Public Access Author manuscript Simultaneous Intranasal/Intravascular Antibody Labeling of CD4 + T Cells in Mouse Lungs", "body": "Avertin ( \n\nTo distinguish memory T cells in the circulation and tissues, a method for intravascular staining of T cells has been developed (Anderson et al., 2012) . This method has been widely used to define memory T cells in many organs and tissues, including lungs, spleens and intestines. However, memory T cells in the respiratory tract are located in three unique anatomic locations, i.e., airway, parenchyma and pulmonary vasculature. Intravascular staining cannot distinguish cells in the airway and parenchyma, since they are both isolated from the circulation and intravascularly-administered antibodies will not stain these two populations. We designed a simultaneous intranasal/intravascular antibody labeling assay that can label and distinguish cells in all three locations using minimal amount of antibodies.\n\nCD90 \n\nPolystyrene foam (Regular polystyrene box top)\n\nRocker (Labnet, catalog number: S0500)\n\nRefrigerated tabletop centrifuge (Beckman Coulter, model: Allegra 6R)\n\nHemocytometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog number: 99503)\n\nFlow cytometer (BD, model: FACSVerse) \n\nPut a plastic desiccator in a fume hood. Place some gauze in the bottom chamber followed by 5 ml of isoflurane. (see Note 2)\n\nPlace a mouse on the grate inside the desiccator (see Note 3).\n\nLoad a P200 micropipette with 100 \u00b5l of CD45-BV510 antibody.\n\nImmediately after the rate of respiration slows, pick up the mouse, hold it vertically and slowly deliver 100 \u00b5l of CD45-BV510 antibody onto the mouse nostrils. Hold the mouse upright so that the liquid on the nostrils is completely aspirated into the lungs.\n\nPlace the mouse back in the cage. After 2 min, turn on the heat lamp over the cage and warm up the mouse for 1 min.\n\n1 CD45 and CD90 are expressed by all CD4 + T cells. Both CD45 and CD90 antibodies can be used to stain CD4 + T cells in the lung and circulation. Phycoerythrin (PE), APC, BV (or their derivatives)-conjugated antibodies are preferentially chosen since these molecules have large molecular weights that will minimize airway/vascular leakage during in vivo labeling.\n\n2 Make sure to tape over the center hole in the plastic desiccator grate because small mice are sometimes able to squeeze through this hole and jump into the bottom, isoflurane-filled chamber. 3 Here we used an antigen-experienced mouse that had been immunized with a construct expressing the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein (Zhao et al., 2016) . This protocol can be applied to study memory and effector as well as na\u00efve CD4 + T cells in mouse lungs.\n\nRemove the mouse from the cage, put it in a mouse restrainer and inject 0.5 \u00b5g CD90.2-APC-eFuor 780 antibody in 300 \u00b5l DPBS through the tail vein with the 1 ml insulin syringe prepared in point 1.\n\nRelease the mouse from the restrainer and immediately anesthetize the mouse by intraperitoneal injection of 300 \u00b5l of avertin solution. Secure the mouse in the palm of the hand and hold it horizontally, then insert the needle at a shallow angle tangential to the mouse and slowly dispense avertin solution into the peritoneal cavity.\n\nPrepare a 1 ml syringe with 20 G \u00d7 1 needle. Carefully pass about 1.25 inches 20 G tubing onto the needle. Sharpen the end of the tubing with scissors. Load the syringe with 1 ml complete RPMI 1640 medium and put it on ice until use ( Figure 1 ).\n\nWhen the mouse is fully anesthetized, typically within 2 min, immobilize it on a piece of polystyrene foam with absorbent pad on top by pinning each limb with a 25 G \u00d7 5/8 needle.\n\nUse a spray bottle filled with 70% ethanol to wet the fur of the mouse.\n\nCut open the skin covering the abdominal and thoracic cavities through to the lower jaw. Use scissors to remove the tissue from the neck and expose the trachea.\n\nUse tweezers to separate the trachea from the underlying tissue and place a 200 \u00b5l tip under the trachea.\n\nUse a razor to cut through \u00bd of the trachea. Insert the 1 ml syringe with 20 G \u00d7 1 needle into the incision. Lavage for 4 times with complete RPMI 1640 medium. Collect the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in a 15 ml conical tube on ice. Typically 3-3.5 ml of BALF is recovered (Figure 1 ).\n\nSpin down cells for 5 min at 400 \u00d7 g at 4 \u00b0C in a bucket tabletop centrifuge and resuspend the cells in 1 ml of ice cold FACS buffer (see Note 5).\n\nAfter collection of BALF, cutting open the abdominal cavity to expose the underside of the diaphragm. Cut through the diaphragm with scissors and then remove the ribcage to fully expose the heart and lung.\n\nFill a 10 ml syringe with ice cold sterile DPBS and attach a 25 G \u00d7 5/8 needle. Insert the needle into the left ventricle of the heart and smoothly dispense 5 ml of DPBS into the heart. In the meantime, use tweezers to break the right atria to allow blood to drain from circulation. Remove the needle from the left ventricle\n\nGently mix 50 \u00b5l cells and 50 \u00b5l antibodies together in a FACS tube.\n\nIncubate the cells in the dark for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C.\n\nWash the cells once with 2 ml of FACS buffer at 400 \u00d7 g for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C.\n\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 100 \u00b5l FACS buffer.\n\nPass the cells through a 70 \u00b5m cell strainer into new FACS tubes using a pipetman. Acquire FACS data using a flow cytometer and analyze data using Flowjo software (Figure 2 ). (see Note 7)\n\nFlow cytometry gating strategy Intranasal administration of antibodies Video 1"}
