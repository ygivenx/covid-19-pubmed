{"title": "Fractional Dosing of Yellow Fever Vaccine to Extend Supply: A Modeling Study 1 2 AUTHORS 3", "body": "Methods 27 We estimate the effective reproductive number for YF in Angola using disease natural history 28 and case report data. With simple mathematical models of YF transmission, we calculate the 29 infection attack rate (IAR, the proportion of population infected over the course of an epidemic) 30 under varying levels of transmissibility and five-fold fractional-dose vaccine efficacy for two 31 vaccination scenarios: (i) random vaccination in a hypothetical population that is completely 32 susceptible; (ii) the Kinshasa vaccination campaign in July-August 2016 with different age cutoff 33 for fractional-dose vaccines. 34 35\n\nFindings 36 We estimate the effective reproductive number early in the Angola outbreak was between 5\u00b72 37 and 7\u00b71. If vaccine action is all-or-nothing (i.e. a proportion VE of vaccinees receives complete 38 and the remainder receive no protection), n-fold fractionation can dramatically reduce IAR as 39 long as efficacy VE exceeds 1/n. This benefit threshold becomes more stringent if vaccine action 40\n\nis leaky (i.e. the susceptibility of each vaccinee is reduced by a factor that is equal to the vaccine 41 efficacy VE). The age cutoff for fractional-dose vaccines chosen by the WHO for the Kinshasa 42 vaccination campaign (namely, 2 years) provides the largest reduction in IAR if the efficacy of 43 five-fold fractional-dose vaccines exceeds 20%. 44\n\nYellow fever (YF) has resurged in Angola and threatens to spread to other countries with 53 relatively low YF vaccine coverage. As of 8 July 2016, YF cases have been exported from Angola 54\n\nto Kenya (2 cases), China (11), and DRC (59), raising concern that YF could resurge in other 55\n\npopulations where competent vectors are present and vaccine coverage is low. 1, 2 Indeed, DRC 56 has already declared a YF epidemic in Kinshasa and two other provinces. A broad band of sub-57\n\nSaharan Africa north of Namibia and Zambia is at risk 58\n\n(http://www.cdc.gov/yellowfever/maps/africa.html), as is much of the northern portion of 59\n\nSouth America (http://www.cdc.gov/yellowfever/maps/south_america.html). The global 60 community is increasingly concerned for the risk of YF emergence in Asia, where the disease 61 has been curiously absent despite seemingly amenable conditions. 62\n\nThere is a safe, highly effective live-attenuated vaccine against YF. 3 However, the global 63 emergency stockpile of YF vaccines, which has been maintained at approximately 6\u00b78 million 64 doses before 2016, has already been depleted twice by the Angola outbreak. With a throughput 65 of only 2 to 4 million doses per month, YF vaccine supply is inadequate given the large urban 66 populations at risk for YF infection. In response to such shortage, dose fractionation has been 67\n\nproposed to maximize the public health benefit of the available YF vaccines. 4 Under dose 68 fractionation, a smaller amount of antigen would be used per dose in order to increase the 69 number of persons who can be vaccinated with a given quantity of vaccine. 3 This strategy was 70 previously proposed to extend pre-pandemic influenza vaccine supplies. 5 If dose fractionation 71\n\nwere consistently adopted, equity of YF vaccine access would also be enhanced both within and 72\n\nacross countries at risk, as more people could benefit from vaccination without depriving 73 others. 6 74 Indeed, following the SAGE endorsement on 17 June 2016, the WHO recommended dose 75 fractionation in its emergency YF vaccination campaign in July-August 2016 to vaccinate 8 76 million people in Kinshasa, 3 million in anterior Angola and 4\u00b73 million along the DRC-Angola 77 corridor. 7 Specifically, 2\u00b75 million standard-dose vaccines would be allocated to Kinshasa where 78 200,000 standard-dose vaccines would be given to children age 9 months to 2 years and the 79 remaining allocation are to be fractionated five-fold and administered to the rest of the 80 population. 81\n\nThe evidence base for fractional-dose YF vaccines is built upon two studies that compared the 82 safety and immunogenicity of standard-dose and five-fold fractional-dose YF vaccines. The first 83 is a randomized, noninferiority trial which showed that 0\u00b71 ml intradermal (ID) vaccination with 84 the 17D YF vaccine was equally safe and immunogenic compared to the standard 0\u00b75ml 85 subcutaneous vaccination. 8 We estimate the initial reproductive number of the YF outbreak in Angola as the average 138 reproductive number among all cases who developed symptoms one serial interval before 139 vaccination campaign began to affect disease transmission (see Figure 1 ). fractionation, we assume that vaccine efficacy of n-fold fractional-dose vaccines for n between 150 1 and 5 increases linearly with the amount of antigen in the vaccines (see appendix for 151 explanation). Potential increases in vaccine wastage during dose-sparing would be mostly due 152\n\nto unused, reconstituted vaccines 18 or increased vaccine failure due to inexperience with 153 intradermal administration among vaccinators. In the setting of mass vaccination campaigns, 154\n\nwastage due to unused vaccine doses will likely to be negligible because vaccination sessions 155 will be large. 156\n\nInfection attack rate 157 We use IAR as the outcome measure for evaluating the impact of dose fractionation. We 158 calculate IAR using the classical final size approach which is exact for directly transmitted SIR-159 type diseases 19 but only an approximation for vector-borne diseases. 20 Nonetheless, this 160 dose vaccines will be given to children aged between 9 months and 2 years (which is 202 sufficient for vaccinating all unvaccinated children in this age range) and the remaining 203 allocation will be fractionated to one-fifth of the standard dose and given to the rest of 204 the population. We compare the outcome when the vaccines are administered (i) in 205 standard dose only (strategy S) and (ii) according to the WHO dose-sparing strategy with 206 alternative age cutoffs for fractional-dose vaccines ranging from 2 to 20 years (strategy 207 F). For the latter, let Z be the age cutoff and ( ) p Z be the proportion of population 208 targeted for standard-dose vaccination. For a given standard-dose vaccine coverage V , 209 the proportion of population receiving standard-dose and fractional-dose vaccines are 210\n\n, respectively. Therefore, the effective vaccine 211 coverage after the vaccination campaign is 212\n\nimmediately before the campaign (i.e. at the end of June 2016). See appendix for the 214 calculation details. 215\n\nThe sponsors of the study had no role in the study design, data collection, data analysis, writing 217 of the report, or the decision to publish.

Figure 1 shows that the initial reproductive 223 number of YF in Angola was 5\u00b72 (95% CI 4\u00b73, 6\u00b71) and 7\u00b71 (5\u00b75, 8\u00b77) if the mean mosquito 224 lifespan was 7 and 14 days, respectively. While these estimates may reflect partial immunity 225 due to prior vaccination or exposure among some of the population (we estimated that around 226 28% of the Angola population had been vaccinated before the YF epidemic; see appendix for 227 calculation details), we assume that the basic reproductive number of a future outbreak in 228 another population would range between 4 and 12 due to varying vector ecology and levels of 229 preexisting immunity in the population. 230 Figure 2A The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

In short, dose fractionation reduces IAR when (i) the standard-239 dose vaccine supply is insufficient to halt disease transmission and (ii) fractional-dose vaccine 240 efficacy is above 0\u00b72. 241\n\nIf vaccine action is \"leaky,\" then the benefit threshold (the efficacy of n-fold fractionated doses 242 necessary to reduce IAR) is higher than 1/n and increases with transmission intensity (Figure 3 ). 243\n\nThis occurs because under the leaky model each infectious bite is assumed to be less likely to 244 cause infection if the host is vaccinated, but the probability of infection grows as the person 245 receives more infectious bites. Figure 3 shows, under the leaky model of vaccine action, dose 246\n\nfractionation is much less beneficial if vaccine action is leaky, efficacy is modest, and R 0 is high. 247\n\nSee appendix for the mathematical details. 248\n\nA recent study suggested that the mosquito biting rate for individuals aged 20 or above is 1\u00b722 249 times higher than those age under 20. 24 We performed a sensitivity analysis to show that our 250 results are unaffected by such heterogeneity. See \"Hetereogeneity in biting rates\" in the 251 appendix for details. 252\n\nThe WHO vaccination campaign in Kinshasa. We estimate that the vaccine coverage in 253\n\nKinshasa was 20% at the end of June 2016 before the vaccination campaign began. assess the robustness of the conclusion that dose fractionation is likely to be beneficial, against 280 the possibility that in fact efficacy of fractionated doses is lower than anticipated, we consider 281 the possibility that five-fold fractionated dosing fails to immunize a proportion (1-VE(5)) of 282\n\nrecipients. We find that as long as at least 20% of recipients are fully immunized by the vaccine, 283 more people would be immunized by vaccinating five times as many people with one-fifth the 284 dose, and so the population-wide benefits of higher coverage would outweigh the lower 285 efficacy of fractionated dosing for individual vaccinees. 286\n\nEven more unlikely, in our opinion, is that fractionated doses would be substantially less 287 efficacious according to a \"leaky\" model, in which all vaccinated individuals were imperfectly 288 protected against infection from each infectious bite, with the same probability of infection 289 from each bite, reduced by vaccine by a proportion VE (see appendix for details). If this were 290 the case however, we found that especially in high-transmission areas, the fractionated-dose 291\n\nvaccine would need to be 80-90% efficacious to provide a benefit over standard dosing. 292\n\nOur analysis is not intended to recommend extending coverage to the point of knowingly 293 compromising efficacy. Rather, our analysis indicates that a strategy of fractionation to a dose 294 that provides equivalent immunogenicity to standard dosing would be greatly beneficial if 295 efficacy is equivalent to standard dosing, and would still be beneficial if, unexpectedly, efficacy 296\n\nwere somewhat lower than for standard dosing. 297\n\nWe have used five-fold fractionation as an example because it is the strategy with the best 298 evidence base of equal immunogenicity. However, some data suggest that more than five-fold 299 fractionation could be equally immunogenic, and of course the benefits of fractionation would 300 be greater if more than five-fold fractionation were logistically possible and comparably 301 efficacious. 302\n\nWe have considered fractional dosing for residents of areas at high risk for transmission. 303\n\nAnother group of interest are travelers, for whom we must also consider longevity of response, 304\n\nlower levels of exposure, and more detailed discussions on equity outside the scope of this 305 modeling paper. The cost of fractional-dose strategies will depend on the route of 306\n\nadministration, but could potentially be substantially less expensive per vaccine recipient. 18 307 .

We assume homogeneous mixing of the population 308 (reasonable at least locally for a vector-borne disease). We also fix a particular value of R 0 for 309 each calculation, and assume this value is maintained until the epidemic has swept through a 310 population. In reality, R 0 will vary seasonally as vector abundance, extrinsic incubation period, 311\n\nand other factors vary. The existence of a high-transmission season might enhance the benefits 312 of fractional-dose vaccination. Most importantly, there will be a premium on achieving high 313 vaccine coverage before the peak of transmission to maximally impact transmission, and this 314 will be limited by supply constraints that could be partially relieved by fractionation. Systematic review 438 We searched PubMed and Google Scholar on June 10, 2016, with the terms \"yellow fever\" and 439 \"vaccine\" or \"dose sparing\". We did not find any reports of randomized trials of yellow fever 440 (YF) vaccine efficacy, at full or lower doses. Three relatively recent studies suggest similar 441 immunological responses at five-fold, or more, fractionation as compared to the current dose 442 antigen levels. 8, 9, 27 While several recent perspective articles propose the dose-sparing strategy 443\n\nin response to the current shortage, 2-4 to our knowledge this is the first study to test the 444 robustness of this strategy (in terms of its epidemiologic impact) against the uncertainties 445 surrounding fractional-dose YF vaccine efficacy and mode of action (e.g. \"all-or-nothing\" and 446 \"leaky\"). 447 448\n\nAdded value of the study 449 We estimate that the reproductive number of the YF epidemic in Angola during 2016 is 5\u00b72 to 450 7\u00b71. Our study is the first to provide an estimate of the transmissibility of YF in urban settings. 451 We Our results support the growing evidence that dose-sparing strategies should be adopted as an 461 option for extending the currently sparse YF vaccine supply. 462 463 .

The target population size in Kinshasa is around 8.05 million, with 629 potentially 1-2 million additional people from adjacent areas. Of the 2.5 million standard-630 dose vaccines, 200,000 will be administered to children age 9 months to 2 years in standard 631 dose (which is sufficient for vaccinating all unvaccinated children in this age range) and the 632 rest of the vaccine stockpile will be administered to the rest of the population as five-fold 633 fractional-dose vaccines. As such, when considering alternative age cutoff for fractional-634 dose vaccines, we assume that the vaccine stockpile is sufficient to vaccinate all individuals 635\n\nin Kinshasa that have not yet been vaccinated as of 30 June 2016. 636\n\nWe consider the all-or-nothing YF vaccine action mechanism more likely than the leaky 638 vaccine action model for the following reasons: based on the limited evidence on 639 immunogenicity of fractional doses to date, we consider it unlikely that reducing the dose 640 five-fold or perhaps further from current preparations would result in dramatically lower 641 efficacy of the leaky type. Visual inspection of the data from a dose fractionation trial of the 642 17DD vaccine in Brazil shows that for doses down to 47x below the standard dose, the 643 distribution of serologic responses was indistinguishable from those for the standard dose, 644\n\nsuggesting that efficacy should be nearly equivalent to that for full doses. This was 645 confirmed by the analysis of peak viremia, which was equivalent for standard dose and for 646 doses down to 11% of the full dose (9-fold fractionation). It was further confirmed by peak 647 cytokine responses, which were comparable to the standard dose for all cytokines tested, 648 down to at least a 9-fold fractional dose. For even lower doses, the proportion 649 seroconverting after vaccination was lower than the 97% observed for the full dose, but the 650 antibody response among the seroconverters appears to be similar at all doses. 9 These data 651 collectively suggest that down to approximately 9-fold fractional dosing of this vaccine the 652 response should be equivalent, and that for further fractionation there may be a failure to 653 induce any substantial response in a fraction of recipients, but the neutralizing antibody 654 titres in those who do respond should be comparable. This pattern is consistent with an all-655 or-nothing model. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. \n\n.
