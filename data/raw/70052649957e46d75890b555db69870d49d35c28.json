{"title": "Genetic characterization of bovine coronavirus in Vietnam", "body": "Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) was first identified during an outbreak of diarrhea among neonatal calves in the 1970s [1] . Later, it occurred in association with winter dysentery in adult cattle and with respiratory tract disorders in calves and cattle [2, 3] . BCoV infection causes acute diarrhea in young calves and reduces milk production by dairy cows, both of which lead to significant economic losses [4] . More recently, preventing BCoV infection has become more important due to reported interspecies transmission of BCoV among feedlot cattle and zoo ruminants [5] .\n\nBCoV is a betacoronavirus (order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae) that harbors a single-stranded, non-segmented, positive-sense RNA genome (26-31 kb) encoding five major structural proteins: the nucleocapsid (N) protein, the transmembrane (M) glycoprotein, the spike (S) glycoprotein, the envelope (E) protein, and the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) glycoprotein [6] . The S glycoprotein comprises two subunits: S1 and S2. The N-terminal S1 subunit is a domain necessary for host surface receptor interaction prior to virus entry and is important for pathogenesis [7] . The HE protein also plays a role in virus entry and release from infected host cells [8] . The hypervariable region of the S protein is used to determine the genetic variability and evolution of BCoV virus [9, 10] .\n\nTo date, BCoV infection has been reported in calves and adult cattle in many cattle-producing countries. In Vietnam, it has been reported that ELISA was applied to investigate the calf diarrhea in the Hue city and resulted that Bovine rotavirus and BCoV-positives of samples were 37.7% and 33.3%, respectively [11] . However, limited information is available about BCoV circulating in Vietnamese cow farms. Here, we examined the prevalence of BCoV infection among calves in Vietnam and genetically characterized Vietnamese BCoVs through phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses of the S and HE proteins.\n\nBetween 2017 and 2018, diarrheic fecal samples (n = 232) were collected from cows on farms located in Vietnam [Nam Dinh (ND), Phu Ly Ha Nam (PL), Duy Tien Ha Nam (DT), Binh Luc Ha Nam (BL), Moc Chau-Son La (MC), Vinh Phuc (VP), Nghe An (NA), Ha Tinh (HT), and TP HCM (HCM)]. All cows were aged between 0.5 and 72 months and had diarrhea. BCoV-positive feces were diagnosed using a Rapid BoviD-5 antigen kit (BioNote Inc., Hwaseong, Gyeonggi-do, Korea) and PCR analysis using previously described primer sets [4] . Sixteen of the fecal samples (from calf aged 0.5-4 months) tested positive for BCoV (6.9%, 16/232); the samples were designated ND65, PL83, PL84, DT97, BL104, MC199, VP200, NA226, HT293, HCM304, HCM305, HCM306, HCM307, HT315, HT316, and HT317 (Supplemental Table and Figure) .\n\nThe full-length S and HE gene sequences of 16 Vietnamese BCoVs were aligned using Clustal X 1.83 software [12] and compared with reference sequences (100 spike genes and 41 HE genes) collected from the NCBI GenBank database ( The software jModelTest 2.1.10 is used to estimate the best-fit model using Akaike and Bayesian information criteria [13] . The best-fit model for the BCoV S and HE genes was the GTR + I + G model. BCoV sequences were used to generate a BEAST input file using BEAUti within BEAST package v1.8.1. The rates of nucleotide substitution per site/per year and the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) were estimated using a Bayesian MCMC approach [14] . Each dataset was simulated using the following options: generation, 80,000,000; burn-in, 10%; and ESSs, > 300. The resulting convergence was analyzed using Tracer 1.5 [14] . Trees were presented as MCC trees using TreeAnnotator 1.7.4 and visualized using Figtree 1.4 [15] . The MCC tree for the S gene indicated that BCoV strains were divided into three diverse clusters (Fig. 1 ). Cluster 1 (C1) comprised 56 BCoVs isolates (identified between 1983 and 2018) derived from the USA (n = 4), China (n = 2), Korea (n = 30), Cuba (n = 4), and Vietnam (n = 16). Cluster 2 (C2) contained 51 BCoVs identified between 1992 and 2014 in European countries: Denmark (n = 7), Sweden (n = 26), France (n = 15), Ireland (n = 1), and Italy (n = 2). Cluster 3 (C3) comprised 9 BCoV strains identified between 1965 and 1994 in Canada (n = 1), USA (n = 4), Korea (n = 3) , and Japan (n = 1). A previous study suggests that HCoV-OC43, BCoVs, and BCoV-like viruses are distributed within three main sub-clusters, named C1 (BCoVs and BCoV-like from America and Asia), C2 (BCoVs from Europe), and C3 (prototype, vaccine, or attenuated BCoV strains) [16] . Antigenic variability and evolution of BCoVs has been reported mainly in strains from USA and Korea, suggesting that BCoV strains take different evolutionary pathways in different countries [4] . Cuban BCoVs clustered with USA BCoV strains (the US/ OH1/2003 strain derived from an antelope and the US/ OH3/2003 strain derived from a giraffe), suggesting that these viruses have a common ancestor [17] .\n\nThe evolutionary rate of BCoV was estimated to be 3.2013 \u00d7 10 \u22124 substitutions/site/year (95% highest posterior density (HPD) 2.3252 \u00d7 10 \u22124 -4.1831 \u00d7 10 \u22124 ) according to ESS (396.6217) , and the tMRCA of 116 BCoVs was estimated to be 1937 (95% HPD 1922 (95% HPD -1951 . According to the MCC tree, C1 first appeared in 1962 (95% HPD 1950 -1973 : calendar), C2 in 1948 (95% HPD 1928 -1964 : calendar), and C3 in 1943 (95% HPD 1932 -1954 ( Table 1 ). The tMRCA of Vietnam strains was estimated to be 1962 (95% HPD 1950 (95% HPD -1973 . Molecular clock analysis of S gene sequences suggested that BCoV and CRCoV diverged from a common ancestor in 1951, whereas BCoV and HCoV-OC43 diverged in 1899 [5] .\n\nTo test the hypothesis that the full-length S gene of BCoV undergoes positive selection, we examined site models and branch site models implemented in the BASEML and CODEML program of the PAML v4.6 package [18] . The substitution rate ratios for non-synonymous (dN) versus synonymous (dS) mutations (\u03c9) were calculated. The \u03c9 ratio for C1, C2, C3, and Vietnam BCoV strains were 0.15734, 0.11613, 1.90805, and 0.10297, respectively (Table 1) . Naive empirical Bayes (NEB) analysis identified positively selected sites within the S protein in the C1 cluster as aa 179 and aa 501 (p > 99%), whereas Bayes empirical Bayes analysis identified four aa positions (11, 179, 499, 501, 1352) (p > 99%) ( Table 1) . NEB analysis estimated positively selected sites in the C2 cluster as aa 113, aa 501, and aa 525 (p > 99%) ( Table 1) . Two strong positive selection sites were detected within the receptor-binding subunit of the S protein gene, spanning aa residues 109-131 and aa 497-527 [5] . The selection pattern along the S glycoprotein implies adaptive evolution of BCoVs, suggesting a successful mechanism by which the virus continually circulates among cattle and other ruminants [5] .\n\nThe BCoV HE gene separated into two clusters (Fig. 2a) . C1 comprised 50 BCoVs from the USA (n = 3), Vietnam (n = 16), and Korea (n = 31), and C3 comprised 6 BCoVs from the USA (n = 2), Canada (n = 1), and Korea (n = 3) . The evolutionary rate of the BCoV HE gene was estimated to be 4.5630 \u00d7 10 \u22124 substitutions/site/year (95% HPD 3.1982 \u00d7 10 \u22124 -6.0408 \u00d7 10 \u22124 ) according to ESS (4448.7229) . The tMRCA on the MCC tree of BCoV HE gene suggests that C1 and C3 diverged 41.3604 years ago 1 3 1928 1938 1948 1958 1968 1978 1988 1998 2008 2018 - "}
