{"title": "Nitric oxide synthase Type II expression by different cell types in MHV-JHM encephalitis suggests distinct roles for nitric oxide in acute versus persistent virus infection", "body": "Nitric oxide NO production in the CNS results from \u017d . the activity of nitric oxide synthases NOS , of which three isoforms have been identified to date. These enzymes vary in their cellular distribution and regulation. Constitutively expressed NOS types I and III have relatively restricted cellular distributions in the CNS to neurons and endothelial cells, respectively, and their activities are regulated by intracellular calcium levels. These isoforms are thought to synthesize NO important for such physiological processes as intercellular signalling and vasoregulation. In contrast, \u017d CNS cells do not express NOS type II also referred to as . \u017d inducible or iNOS unless appropriately activated Simmons and Murphy, 1992; Corradin et al., 1993; Nunokawa et al., 1993; Minc-Golomb et al., 1994; Borgerding and . Murphy, 1995 . which express NOS II in vitro is the requirement for transcriptional induction by exposure to specific proinflammatory cytokines or bacterial endotoxins. Cellular release of NO with NOS II expression is, therefore, thought to be important primarily under pathophysiological conditions when such inducers are present, for example in CNS infections.\n\nA detailed understanding of the immune mechanisms responsible for viral clearance and for persistent viral infection in the CNS is currently lacking. Increasing evidence has accumulated to support the idea that activation of NOS II expression and NO production is an important component in the immune response to specific CNS infections, possibly contributing to the resulting pathology \u017dCross et al., 1993; Koprowski et al., 1993; Campbell et . al., 1994; Dighiero et al., 1994; Van Dam et al., 1995 . Phagocytic cells expressing NOS II and producing NO have been shown to be cytotoxic for cells infected with \u017d intracellular pathogens Adams et al., 1990; Chao et al., . 1993; Vouldoukis et al., 1995 and murine macrophages \u017d . induced with interferon IFN -g to express NOS II have been shown to inhibit replication of ectromelia, vaccinia, \u017d and herpes simplex-1 viruses in vitro Karupiah et al., . 1993 .

Schneider-Schaulies et al., 1993 . The release of NO with acute and chronic viral infection may, therefore, function protectively to clear virus from the CNS. However, since \u017d the cytotoxic effects of NO or of peroxynitrite, formed by . its interaction with superoxide anion are non-specific, NOS II induction in the CNS could have detrimental or lethal effects, not only on invading pathogens and infected \u017d cells but also on nearby uninfected endogenous cells Chao et al., 1992; Merrill et al., 1993; Dawson et al., 1994;  .

The neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus \u017d . MHV-JHM is a member of the coronavirus family, enveloped RNA viruses with positive-sense RNA genomes.

Acute CNS infection with this virus in susceptible animals results in lytic infection of a variety of endogenous parenchymal cells, producing a rapidly fatal meningoencephalitis. Previous studies have reported the importance of CD4 q and CD8 q cell infiltration in the clearance of MHV virus, with \u017d cytokines as possible mediators Sussman et al., 1989; Williamson and Stohlman, 1990; Korner et al., 1991;  . Yamaguchi et al., 1991; Pearce et al., 1994 . In addition to acute encephalitis, infection with this virus causes acute and chronic demyelinating diseases \u017dLampert et al., 1973; Weiner, 1973; Nagashima et al., 1978; Sorensen et al., 1980; Stohlman and Weiner, 1981; Lavi et al., 1984; Erlich et al., 1987;  . Wang et al., 1992 with pathological features similar to human multiple sclerosis. Previously, we have described the expression of multiple cytokines and NOS II protein in the CNS of mice acutely and persistently infected with \u017d . MHV-JHM Here we report NOS II expression during acute MHV-JHM infection, describing the time course and cellular distribution of both NOS II mRNA and protein with acute MHV-JHM meningoencephalitis. Differences between the cellular distribution of NOS II expression with acute and persistent MHV-JHM infections are also confirmed, suggesting different roles for the NO released.\n\nA total of 51 mice were used in this study. Thirty-eight mice were used for NOS II mRNA detection by RT-PCR, and 13 were used for NOS II in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry studies. For the acute encephalitis \u017d studies, pathogen-free adult C57BLr6 mice Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, Maine or Harlan Laboratories, Indi-. anapolis, IN were infected intranasally with MHV- JHM \u017d 4 . 5 = 10 PFU . At 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 days post-infection, mice were intracardially perfused with PBS and brains were harvested. Tissue was either frozen at y708C imme-\u017d diately or placed in Histochoice MB fixative Amresco, . Solon, OH overnight prior to paraffin embedding. Control animals were uninfected animals housed in separate cages. For the persistent infection studies, C57BLr6 dams were immunized and their offspring inoculated intranasally with \u017d . MHV-JHM as described previously Mice subsequently exhibiting hindlimb paralysis were sacrificed and spinal cord tissues were handled as described above. Control animals were infected but asymptomatic.\n\nRAW 264.7, a mouse macrophage cell line, was ob-\u017d tained from the American Type Culture Collection Rock-. ville, MD and grown in Dulbecco's MEM with 10% FCS and 50 mgrml gentamicin at 378C in 5% CO r95% air. 2 \u017d Cells exposed 5 h to 50 Urml murine IFN-g GibcoBRL, . Grand Island, NY and 500 ngrml lipopolysaccharide \u017d . LPS, Sigma, St. Louis, MO were used as a source of NOS II RNA for RT-PCR. MHV-JHM used in all studies \u017d was grown and titered as described previously Perlman et . al., 1987 . 2.3. RNA extraction \u017d Total RNA was extracted from 200-400 mg wet . \u017d weight mouse brain or spinal cord using TRISOLV Bio-. tecx Laboratories, Houston, TX according to manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was quantitated by absorbance at 260 nm. Total RNA used for RT-PCR was first \u017d treated with 2 U of RNase-free DNase Promega, Madison, . WI for 1 h at 378C to remove possible genomic DNA contamination.\n\nA non-quantitative RT-PCR method for the detection of NOS II RNA using NOS II specific primers, followed by Southern blotting using a 32 P-end-labeled internal oligonucleotide probe, was performed as described previously \u017d . Grzybicki et al., 1996 . The expected PCR product was 441 bp. Beta-actin primers were synthesized using pub-( ) \u017d . lished sequences Montgomery and Dallman, 1991 and the predicted PCR product was 571 bp.\n\nMouse brain or spinal cord tissues were harvested as described above and placed in Histochoice MB fixative \u017d . AMRESCO, Solon, OH overnight followed by dehydration and embedding in paraffin. The exact chemical composition of Histochoice MB fixative is protected by the manufacturer; however, it is a non-crosslinking fixativerpreservative, and the manufacturer's directions were followed exactly for tissue fixation. 15 mm sagittal \u017d . \u017d . brain or horizontal spinal cord sections were cut and \u017d . mounted onto silanized Sigma, St. Louis, MO Superfrost \u017d . Plus Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA slides, dried overnight, and stored at y208C. NOS II probes were 665 bp 35 S-labeled single-stranded antisense or sense RNA, and their synthesis and the in situ hybridization procedure used to detect NOS II message was a modification of a \u017d . method described by and has been \u017d . described previously Grzybicki et al., 1996 . Briefly, after de-paraffinization in xylenes and rehydration in graded ethanols, sections were pretreated with 25 mgrml Pro-\u017d . teinase K Gibco BRL Grand Island, NY in 0.1 M Tris, pH 8, and 0.05 M EDTA. This was followed by immersion \u017d . in 0.25% volrvol acetic anhydride in 0.1 M triethanolamine and dehydration through graded ethanols. Sections were then hybridized with 1 = 106 cpmrsection probe in a Tris-buffered hybridization solution in a humid chamber overnight at 558C. After overnight hybridization, sections were washed in SSC and then treated with RNase \u017d . A 20 mgrml, BMB, Indianapolis, IN . Slides were washed in progressively stringent SSC washes, dehydrated through graded ethanols, and air-dried. Emulsion autoradiography was performed using Kodak NTB-2 emulsion, and slides were exposed for 14-16 days at 48C before development. Slides were counterstained with with hematoxylin and \u017d . \u017d . eosin H and E or methyl green 0.25% aqueous , dehydrated, and mounted in Permount before examination by light microscopy.\n\nBrains or spinal cords were harvested and processed as described for in situ hybridization. NOS II was detected using an immunoperoxidase technique as described previ-\u017d . ously Grzybicki et al., 1996 . Briefly, sections were incu-\u017d bated with rabbit anti-murine NOS II Ab diluted 1:100, . Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY followed by \u017d goat anti-rabbit biotinylated IgG secondary Ab 1:200, . Sigma, St. Louis, MO . Specific protein was detected using an avidin-biotinylated horseradish peroxidase com-\u017d . plex ABC kit used according to the manufacturer's in-\u017d . structions Vector, Burlingame, CA . Staining reactions were performed with 3,3 X -diaminobenzidine as substrate and enhanced in the presence of nickel chloride. Before being mounted, sections were counterstained in methyl \u017d . green 0.25% aqueous . Specificity of the commercial NOS II polyclonal antibody was confirmed by immunoblotting. Antibody was preabsorbed overnight against IFN-grLPS-activated RAW cells fixed with Histochoice. This \u017d . preabsorbed antibody 1:1000 was then immunoblotted against NOS II-upregulated murine whole brain protein samples separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE gels. Parallel immunoblots were run using non-preabsorbed NOS II polyclonal antibody and NOS II murine monoclonal antibody \u017d . Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY . Immunoblots using non-preabsorbed but not preabsorbed antibody revealed the presence of a single protein band of the ex-\u017d .\u017d . pected size 130 kD data not shown .\n\nGFAP detection was achieved using a murine mono-\u017d . .

The controls employed for all antibodies were reactions lacking primary antibody.\n\nSections from CNS tissue used for in situ hybridization analysis or immunocytochemistry were stained with H and \u017d . E andror luxol fast blue LFB in order to verify pathological changes consistent with acute meningoencephalitis or to detect areas of demyelination. For acute infection, unimmunized mice were sacrificed at different time points after intranasal inoculation with 50,000 PFU of MHV-JHM and whole brain was harvested. For persistent infection, mice suckled from immunized dams were intranasally inoculated with 50,000 PFU of MHV-JHM. Animals exhibiting hindlimb paralysis weeks later were sacrificed and spinal cord was harvested. RNA extraction followed by RT-PCRrSouthern blotting was performed. The expected size cDNA product is 441 bp, indicated by the arrowhead. Lane 1, 'no target' control; 2-6, acutely infected mice three, four, five, six, and seven days post-inoculation; 7 and 8, persistent infection with hindlimb paralysis; 9, uninfected control; 10, LPSqIFN-g induced RAW \u017d . cells positive control . \n\nFor the acute encephalitis experiments, 50,000 PFU of MHV-JHM were intranasally inoculated into a total of 14 unimmunized, adult C57BLr6 mice. Mice surviving to \u017d day 5 began to exhibit clinical signs of infection hunch-. ing, ruffled fur, irritability and lethargy which progressed to a moribund state by day 7. Mice were sacrificed 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 days after infection and brain tissues were analyzed for NOS II mRNA. Southern analysis of RT-PCR products revealed the presence of NOS II mRNA in tissues of 5r5 mice 7 days after infection, 3r3 mice 6 days after infection, and 1r2 mice 5 days after infection. NOS II mRNA was not detected in the brains of two mice 4 and 3 \u017d . days after infection. Uninfected control brains 2r2 did \u017d . not express NOS II mRNA Fig. 1 .\n\nSpinal cord tissue was harvested from eight C57BLr6 mice with persistent MHV-JHM infection exhibiting hindlimb paralysis and analyzed for NOS II mRNA. The length of time from inoculation to manifestation of clinical paralysis ranged from 30 to 65 days. Southern analysis of RT-PCR products revealed the presence of NOS II mRNA \u017d in spinal cords of 7r8 mice with hindlimb paralysis Fig. .\n\n1 . Spinal cord tissue from 1r4 infected but asymptomatic mice expressed NOS II mRNA by this method.\n\nIn situ hybridization analysis utilizing a 35 S-labeled NOS II antisense cRNA probe was performed on multiple brain sections from one mouse sacrificed 7 days after acute infection, one mouse sacrificed 6 days after acute infection, and an uninfected control mouse. Changes consistent with diffuse acute encephalitis were evident on H and E staining of sections from these animals, including diffuse and extensive meningeal, perivascular, and parenchymal mononuclear infiltrates as well as multifocal areas of necrosis. NOS II mRNA evidenced by silver grain clustering was present in cells in brains on both days 6 and 7 after infection. These round cells were present in the meninges, clustered around blood vessels in the parenchyma, and scattered diffusely throughout the brain . parenchyma Fig. 2A , frontal cortex . The morphological appearance of the positive cells as well as their pattern of distribution suggested that they were infiltrating mononuclear phagocytes. Confirmation of this cell type expression \u017d was achieved with demonstration of NOS II protein see . below . NOS II sense cRNA probe hybridization analysis on adjacent sections revealed only a background scattering \u017d . of silver grains Fig. 2B . NOS II antisense probe hybridizations performed on brain sections from an uninfected control mouse revealed no evident clustering of \u017d . silver grains in any brain area data not shown .\n\nIn situ hybridization analysis was also performed on multiple sections at several levels in the spinal cord from two mice exhibiting hindlimb paralysis. Multifocal chronic-active demyelinated lesions were evident by H and E and LFB staining in the spinal cords of both of these \u017d . mice Fig. 3 . Lesions were characterized by a well-demarcated edge with surrounding inflammatory cells and a gliotic center. Antisense probe hybridization revealed NOS II mRNA apparent by silver grain clustering present in the white and gray matter adjacent to demyelinated foci and \u017d . scattered in demyelinated areas Fig. 4A . Such clustering was not evident after hybridization with the control sense probe, which resulted in only a background scattering of \u017d . silver grains Fig. 4B .\n\nImmunohistochemical staining of multiple brain sections from each of two mice sacrificed at 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 days after acute infection utilizing a polyclonal antibody to NOS II revealed the presence of positive cells at all time points. Similar to the general histological distribution pattern of cells expressing NOS II mRNA in acutely infected brains described above, the only cells positive for NOS II protein were round cells without processes present in the meninges, around vessels in the brain parenchyma, and \u017d scattered diffusely throughout the brain parenchyma Fig. . 5A . Specifically, neurons and vascular endothelial cells did not stain positively in any sections. Control reactions lacking primary antibody were without positive cells in \u017d . any brain region data not shown . Additionally, reactions \u017d using preabsorbed NOS II antibody see Materials and . Methods were also without positive cells in any brain \u017d . region data not shown .\n\nImmunohistochemical staining was performed on sections adjacent to those found to contain NOS II positive cells utilizing F4r80 and GFAP antibodies in an effort to \u017d . \n\nImmunohistochemical staining was also performed on sections adjacent to those found to contain NOS II positive cells utilizing a monoclonal antibody against MHV-JHM in order to verify infection and to compare the spatial and temporal expression of NOS II protein with that of viral antigen.\n\nOn day 3 post-infection, rare cells positive for virus were seen in the olfactory bulb and olfactory cortex. Only rare cells positive for NOS II were seen at this time point, but they were also located in the olfactory bulb.\n\nAt 4 days after infection, virus was present in the olfactory bulb, olfactory nuclei, medial preoptic area, and in one focus of the pons. Cells positive for NOS II protein were also seen in the olfactory bulb and olfactory nuclei, but none were seen in the preoptic area or brainstem. Scattered positive cells were seen in the rostral frontal cortex.\n\nAt day 5 after infection, virus was present less abundantly in the olfactory areas, but was seen diffusely in the ventromedial brain, particularly in the ventral tegmental \u017d . \u017d . area VTA Fig. 6A . Both dorsal and ventral areas of the brainstem also contained virus. Cells positive for NOS II at this time point were also seen in the ventromedial brain, \u017d . particularly the VTA Fig. 6B , and in the basal ganglia and brainstem. However, NOS II positive cells were also abundant in the hippocampus, particularly in the meninges \u017d . of the hippocampal area Fig. 6C and in the septal area. Many positive cells were also still present in the olfactory regions.\n\nOn day 6 after infection, virus was more diffusely located throughout the brain, with abundant virus in the entire ventral brain as well as in the subcortical gray matter, particularly the central gray region and the septal area. Virus was also abundant in the brainstem. Cells expressing NOS II were also present in the ventromedial brain, particularly the VTA, as well as in the septal area, subcortical gray matter, and brainstem, with NOS II expression at this time point particularly abundant in the midbrain. Unlike the distribution of virus, NOS II positive cells remained abundant in the hippocampus, especially in the meninges, and there were also scattered positive cells throughout the cortex.\n\nIn general, viral antigen appeared to move rostro-caudally with time after infection, and to be present in the brain multifocally, with patches of positive cells seen in the regions described above. The distribution of NOS II positive cells on the whole appeared to be more diffuse, with single cells and clusters of cells scattered in the parenchyma, conspicuously around vessels and in meninges in the regions described above. While there was some overlap between areas with cells positive for virus and areas with NOS II positive cells, their spatial and temporal patterns of expression did not appear to correlate directly.\n\nImmunohistochemical staining of multiple spinal cord sections with chronic-active lesions from two persistently infected mice also revealed the presence of cells positive for NOS II protein. These cells were located in the white matter of the spinal cord, most conspicuously in and adjacent to areas of demyelination. Cells positive for NOS II protein were of medium size and possessed both thick and thin elongated processes, morphologically resembling \u017d . astrocytes Fig. 7A and B . Based on shape alone, some of these cells could represent activated microglia; however, their size was generally too large for microglia, and the pattern of staining for F4r80 was unlike the pattern ob-\u017d . tained with NOS II staining see below . Therefore, despite the fact that infiltrating inflammatory cells were present in \u017d . these lesions see Fig. 3 they did not stain positively for NOS II protein. Control reactions lacking primary antibody \u017d were without positive cells in any cord region data not . shown .\n\nImmunohistochemical staining of cord sections adjacent to those found to contain NOS II positive cells was performed utilizing GFAP and F4r80 antibodies in an \u017d . effort to identify the cell type s expressing NOS II protein. The expression of GFAP protein was increased in areas of demyelination, indicating the presence of astrogliosis with persistent MHV-JHM infection. The pattern and distribution of cells positive for GFAP was the same as that of NOS II positive cells in and adjacent to demyeli-\u017d . nated foci Fig. 7C . The pattern and distribution of cells positive for F4r80 was unlike that of NOS II positive cells \u017d . data not shown . Therefore, a population of activated astrocytes appears to be the major source of NOS II under these conditions. These results confirm and extend our \u017d . earlier findings Immunohistochemical staining was performed on sections adjacent to those positive for NOS II utilizing a monoclonal antibody against MHV-JHM to verify viral \n\nThe present study reveals the time course and cellular distribution of NOS II message and protein in mice with acute MHV-JHM meningoencephalitis. Detailed descrip-\u017d tions of acute MHV infection from previous studies Bailey et al., 1949; Cheever et al., 1949 Lampert et al., 1973 . Weiner, 1973; Lavi et al., 1984; show that inoculation of unimmunized mice results in the presence of viral antigen in the brain by day 3 after infection, increasing progressively until death. Infected cells are neurons and other parenchymal cells, with approximately 35% of infected cells identified as astrocytes \u017d . Perlman and Ries, 1987 . MHV-JHM produces a lytic infection, directly destroying infected cells. Pathological changes seen with acute infection are not unlike other acute encephalitides: leptomeningeal, perivascular, and parenchymal inflammatory infiltrates are present, with proliferating astrocytes and activated microglia surrounding neurons. One unique feature of this acute viral infection is the presence of abundant necrosis.\n\nNOS II mRNA expression in acute infection appears to correlate with the severity of clinical signs, appearing in some mice on day 5 after infection and in all mice on days 6 and 7 after infection. These observations suggest that NOS II induction and NO release may contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease; however, in this rapidly progessive infection it is more likely that CNS dysfunction is a result of neuronal and general parenchymal damage caused directly by the virus. Non-specific cytotoxic effects on cells adjacent to infiltrated macrophages in acute MHV-JHM infection may produce some CNS damage. This would be expected since activated phagocytes also produce superoxide anion which could interact with NO to produce peroxynitrite. However, the observation that significant numbers of NOS II positive macrophages are present in the brain parenchyma only at late stages of the disease when extensive CNS damage has already occurred, suggests that the amount of NO-associated injury is probably not enough to significantly alter the course of the disease. One would predict, therefore, that administration of a specific NOS II inhibitor would not affect the clinical course of this acute infection. Infiltrating macrophages also express NOS II in Borna and Rabies encephalitides, but in these cases the NO released is thought to contribute significantly to CNS damage and therefore clinical disease \u017d . Zheng et al., 1993; Van Dam et al., 1995 . In this model, infected resident CNS cells do not appear to express NOS II, and NOS II expression is also not completely spatially correlated with virus. These observations could be explained by the sensitivity limit of the assay; it is possible that neurons, glia, or other cells may be producing low levels of NOS II which are undetectable by immunohistochemistry. This explanation is not likely since NOS II was demonstrated in endogenous cells with persistent infection. Alternatively, it may take longer than \u017d . expected based on in vitro data to induce astrocytes or other CNS cells to express NOS II in vivo. More likely, a complex system of regulation for NOS II expression by soluble mediators andror virus may exist in vivo. Therefore, NO release does not appear to be a component of the innate immune response to acute infection with this virus or to play a significant role in viral clearance. This is \u017d . unlike Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus LCMV infection, in which infiltrating macrophages also express NOS II. Here, administration of antimacrophage agents before LCMV infection results in a significant increase and prolongation of viremia, suggesting a role for \u017d macrophage NO release in clearance of virus Cross et al., . 1993 . Other reports have shown NOS II induction in virus-in-\u017d . fected glial cells in vivo Dighiero et al., 1994 and a recent study describes NOS II expression in non-infected but nearby glial cells in VSV-infected brain, expression \u017d . coinciding with decreased viral titers These studies, together with the observations reported here, suggest that, while NOS II induction occurs in a \u017d variety of acute CNS viral infections leading to the hypothesis that consequent NO release may be a generalized . anti-viral defense mechanism , NO release actually plays a role in the innate immune response only in specific acute CNS viral infections.\n\nThe observation that NOS II induction does not occur in astrocytes in acutely infected mice also points to a lack of direct correlation between astrogliosis and NOS II induction. While it is clear that astrocyte 'activation' occurs with acute MHV-JHM infection, as seen by an increase in GFAP staining over the disease course, NOS II is not induced in these activated astrocytes. One role astrocytes may be playing during acute infection, which could contribute to the pathogenesis of this disease, is that of producers of chemokines, molecules contributing to the \u017d influx of inflammatory cells into the CNS Vanguri and . Farber, 1994; Hurwitz et al., 1995 . In this study, 7r8 spinal cords of mice with hindlimb paralysis and 1r4 infected but asymptomatic mice contained NOS II mRNA by PCR. The observation that one of the mice with clinical symptoms did not appear to express NOS II mRNA is most likely due to inter-animal variation in time course and quantitative expression of NOS II. One control animal also expressed NOS II; this expression could have been induced by some component of the experimental manipulation. Alternatively, viral infection in this animal may have induced a subclinical inflammatory response which nevertheless induced NOS II. Performing these experiments on larger numbers of animals would clarify these points. The fact that we observed a consistent pattern of NOS II expression by PCR in the animals ( ) studied which was confirmed by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical studies supports the conclusion that NOS II is upregulated in persistently infected mice with hindlimb paralysis.\n\nThe chronic demyelinating process occurring with per-\u017d sistent MHV-JHM infection has been well described Bailey et al., 1949; Cheever et al., 1949; Nagashima et al., 1978; Sorensen et al., 1980; Stohlman and Weiner, 1981; Lavi et al., 1984; Erlich et al., 1987;  . Wang et al., 1992; and exhibits similarities to human multiple sclerosis. Oligodendrocytes and astrocytes are target cells for persistent infection with \u017d MHV-JHM Perlman et al., 1988; Bailey . et al., 1949; Cheever et al., 1949; , and a recent report identifies astrocyte-to-astrocyte spread of virus as an important component of the establishment of \u017d persistent infection in the spinal cord white matter In contrast to acute infection these astrocytes express NOS II, suggesting that virus-infected cells may be transcriptionally induced in an effort to clear virus. Upregulation of NOS II transcription may be stimulated either directly by virus or after exposure to proin-\u017d . flammatory cytokines IFN-g , TNF-a released locally by other infected or activated cells. The ongoing presence of virus in the spinal cord with demyelination indicates that, if NOS II induction with NO release is an anti-viral defense mechanism under these conditions, it is not entirely successful; however, NO cytotoxicity may significantly limit an infection which would otherwise be overwhelming. In vitro studies are needed to clarify whether astrocytes can be induced to express NOS II and release NO in response to persistent MHV-JHM viral infection alone, but our observations suggest this as a possibility.\n\nA CNS milieu is created in rodents persistently infected with MHV-JHM and in other models of demyelinating \u017d diseases in which proinflammatory cytokines IFN-g , IL-1, . TNF-a known to induce NOS II in vitro are produced in \u017d significant quantities Hartung et al., . 1992; Bauer et al., 1993; Renno et al., 1995 . Under these conditions, it has been hypothesized that NOS II induction and sustained NO release could mediate the destruction of myelin and oligodendrocytes via a 'bystander' effect andror by raising intracellular levels of cGMP which increases the susceptibility of cells to TNF-a toxicity \u017d . Sherman et al., 1992 . Astrocytic expression of NOS II in demyelinated lesions from persistently infected animals supports this hypothesis. Therefore, the administration of a specific NOS II inhibitor might be predicted to prevent or ameliorate development of pathological changes in the spinal cord and clinical symptoms in mice with persistent \u017d . infection, as reported by Cross et al. 1993 for experimental allergic encephalomyelitis.\n\nIn summary, the results of this study suggest a role for NOS II expression and NO release as part of the acquired immune response to acute MHV-JHM infection but do not support a significant role in viral clearance. Due to the relatively late temporal expression of NOS II, this NO release probably does not contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of acute disease. In contrast, NOS II expression and NO release may be a component of the innate immune response to persistent MHV-JHM infection and, via a 'bystander' effect, contribute to CNS injury. The lack of specific NOS II inhibitors has so far precluded definitive testing of this hypothesis. However, the availability of \u017d NOS II-deficient mice MacMicking et al., 1995; Wei et . al., 1995 now provides an opportunity to clarify roles for NOS II induction and NO release in MHV-JHM and other CNS viral diseases. \u017d . \u017d .
