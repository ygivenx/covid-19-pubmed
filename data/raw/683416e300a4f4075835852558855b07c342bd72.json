Additionally, the E protein of PRVABC59 and FLR strains 129 expressed in C6/36, Vero, THP-1, and SNB19 cell lines were primarily decorated with tri-130 sialylated tri-antennary N-glycans (3603.0 m/z) and-with a lesser abundance-di-sialylated bi-131 and tri-antennary (2792.5 and 3241.8 m/z) and tetra-sialylated tri-antennary (3964.2 m/z) N-132 glycans ( Supplementary Fig. 4c, d) . Minor N-glycans including Man 5 GlcNAc 2 (1579.9 m/z), 133 monosialylated bi-antennary (2431.4 m/z), core-fucosylated mono-galactosylated bi-antennary 134 (2040.2 m/z), core-fucosylated asialo bi-antennary (2244.3 m/z), and core-fucosylated mono-135 sialylated bi-antennary (2605.5 m/z) N-glycans were also identified ( Supplementary Fig. 4c, d) . 136 Similar to the African lineage, the E proteins of Asian lineage revealed a more restricted N-137 glycan profile when expressed in LLC-MK2 cells. The di-sialylated bi-antennary (2792.5 m/z) 138 N-glycan was identified as the most abundant N-glycan, with very low to no expression of more 139 complex N-glycans. The core-fucosylated agalactosylated (1836.0 m/z) and mono-sialylated bi-140 antennary (2431.4 m/z) were, respectively, the second and third most relatively abundant N-141 glycans reported (Supplementary Fig. 4c, d) . Lastly, the N-glycan profiles of the PRVABC59 142 and FLR strains of E expressed in JEG-3 cells showed a lower abundance of highly sialylated N-143 glycans such as the tri-and tetra-sialylated tri-antennary N-glycans (3603.0 and 3964.2 m/z) 144 compared to the virus produced in the C6/36, Vero, THP-1, and SNB19 cells. By contrast, the E 145 of the PRVABC59 strain showed an increased abundance of both mono-sialylated N-glycans 146 (2431.4 and 2880.6 m/z) and non-sialylated N-glycans (2040.2, 2070.2 and 2244 .3 m/z). 147 All rights reserved.

In both of these cell lines, the major N-glycans found were Man 5 GlcNAc 2 (1579.9 m/z), 150 asialo-bi-antennary (2070.2 m/z), and core fucosylated asialo-bi-antennary (2244.3 m/z) N-151 glycans (Supplementary Fig. 4e) . When produced in LLC-MK2 cells, however, the N-glycan 152 profile of the E protein from the SJRP strain was comparable to the profiles found for the four 153 other strains, with the di-sialylated bi-antennary (2792.6 m/z) and the core-fucosylated 154 agalactosylated (1836.1 m/z) N-glycans being the most abundant. Contrasting the other E 155 proteins produced in C6/36, LLC-MK2 and Vero cells, Man5 (1579.9 m/z) was found to be the 156 most abundant N-glycan on the SJRP strain. However, the N-glycan profiles generated from the 157 E protein of SJRP strain expressed in THP-1, SNB19, and JEG-3 cells revealed a high relative 158 abundance of di-sialylated bi-antennary (2792.5 m/z), tri-antennary (3241.8 m/z), and tri-159 sialylated tri-antennary (3603.0 m/z) with little to no expression of less complex non-sialylated 160 N-glycans such as Man 5 GlcNAc 2 (Supplementary Fig. 4e) . 161 The major proportion (> 5%) of N-glycan spectra at 3603.0 mz, 3241.8 mz, 2792.6 mz, 3964.2 162 mz, 1836.0 mz, and 2040.2 mz were identified on ZIKV E produced in these cell lines. These 163 heterogenous N-glycan structures of the studied ZIKV E include high (oligo)-mannose; these and 164 other N-glycans compositionally are predicted to include the residues N-acetylgalactosamine 165 (GalNAc), N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), N-acetylneuraminic acid (NeuAc), galactose (Gal), 166 glucose (Glc), fucose (Fuc), and sialic acid. In addition, we found many other glycan forms with 167 high heterogeneity but smaller proportion (< 5%); these were not further characterized.

This approach relies on specificities of 173 immobilized lectins that recognize specific glycan features on cell surface glycoproteins, 174 resulting in their binding to the array. These data revealed that different cell lines harbor 175 differential cell-surface glycosylation (Fig. 3) that might impact the glycosylation of the virus 176 produced in these cells. In general, the expression of several cell-surface glycan structures 177 correlated with viral N-glycan features (Supplementary Table 3 ).

In this study, we used MS to 213 characterize the E protein N-glycans of ZIKV derived from insect cells and mammalian cells. 214 We showed for the first time that ZIKV E, which is required for host cell receptor binding, is 215 differentially glycosylated in a cell-type different fashion.

This has also been described for other viruses including ZIKV E, which were mostly decorated with bi-antennary di-sialylated and core-fucosylated 234 agalactosylated N-glycans ( Fig. 2-3, Supplementary Fig. 4) . Collectively, these findings 235 indicate that not only virus characteristics; e.g. strain or lineage, but also host cell physiology has 236 an impact on the glycosylation pattern of ZIKV E which may affect viral pathogenesis of ZIKV 237 strains.\n\n238 All rights reserved.

We 239 predict that the processed complex (mammalian-derived virus) or paucimannose (insect-derived 240 virus) glycan is at position N154 which is not essential for virus production and spread in 241 mosquito or mammalian cells 48 , as the high mannose-type N-glycans have been reported to be 242 present at the N154 residue in DI domain of ZIKV E within the conserved glycosylation motif 1, SNB-19 and JEG-3 cells ( Fig. 2-3, Supplementary Fig. 4) , suggesting that decoration of 250 ZIKV E with sialylated N-glycans may correlate with diverse tissue tropism of the virus. Taken 251 together, these findings lead us to hypothesize that the \"N-glycotype\" of the recently emergent 252 Asian strains is mediating the incidence of the new neuropathogenic potential of ZIKV infection.\n\nThe results of our study revealed high heterogeneity in structure and composition of the N-254 glycans linked to ZIKV E produced by both insect and various mammalian cells including 255 monocytes, placental, and neural cell types. The heterogeneity of N-glycan has also been linked 256 to DENV E protein in terms of structure and composition 23 . The N-glycan on DENV E protein 257 that is produced by mammalian cells is a mixture of high-mannose glycan and complex glycan. Mosquito cells, by contrast, provide a mix of high-mannose glycan and paucimannose glycan 46 .\n\nIt has been shown that ZIKV replication in macaques also restores the absent N-glycosylation 260 site in MR766 strain 51 , suggesting that the passage history (host animal and cell line types) 261 All rights reserved.

Briefly, culture supernatants were centrifuged at 6,000 rpm for 381 10 min, and a 0.45\u00b5m filter was used to remove cell debris.
