Other approaches, however, are being explored.\n\nWe declare that we have no confl icts of interest other than those disclosed in the original paper. sample size, duration, and cost to a degree that renders paediatric vaccine trials unaff ordable. Measurement of the eff ect of tuberculosis vaccines on latent infection is an important outcome for vaccine effi cacy trials. The tuberculin skin test would not be an appropriate method, because of a lack of specifi city. Hence our use of an interferon \u03b3 release assay (IGRA), although the variability and dynamics of IGRA are accepted. 2, 3 We agree that simple IGRA conversion might overestimate the true incidence of tuberculosis infection in young children, and should not be used in isolation for diagnosis of disease. Further data analysis using exploratory cutoff s might clarify the nature of true IGRA conversion. 2 The biological importance of a positive IGRA is underlined by the eight-fold higher tuberculosis disease incidence among adolescents with simple IGRA conversion in our community. 3 We agree with Pramod Upadhyay that socioeconomic factors, including nutrition, play a key role in the tuberculosis epidemic, and should be explored. Further analysis of the MVA85A trial dataset will look at characteristics of infants meeting effi cacy endpoints, including nutritional status.\n\nIn this trial all infants received multivitamins and iron supplements for 2 months before and 1 month after enrolment. We excluded acutely ill or clinically malnourished infants from enrolment. During followup, triggers for admission and tuberculosis investigations included a failure to thrive or signifi cant weight loss. In addition, these infants were referred to the health services for nutritional support. We failed to fi nd any helminth infections in the majority of samples from admitted infants and their mothers (data not shown).\n\nBCG does have established consistent effi cacy against disseminated tuberculosis, 4 and has shown effi cacy in some trials against\n\nWe thank Marcel Behr and colleagues for their comments. We share their view on the importance of endpoint specifi city in tuberculosis vaccine effi cacy trials but disagree with their interpretation of our data. 1 Since the incidence rate ratios (IRR) for endpoints 0-4 presented in Behr and colleagues' table do not diff er statistically, no diff erences in vaccine effi cacy might be inferred from the IRR point estimates presented. Pulmonary tuberculosis in young children is known to be pauci-bacillary, and only a minority is positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. However, endpoint 1 contained more microbiologically positive cases than negative cases, suggesting that our composite clinical case defi nition was rigorous. 1 We agree that this clinical phenotype plus microbiological confi rmation would represent an ideal diagnostic gold standard, however a defi nition of childhood tuberculosis that requires microbiological confi rmation in all cases might increase Table 3 , for patient 1, the fi rst row for May 9 should not have been included, and the second row for May 9 should have been listed as a plasma specimen.

Enough nutritional diet for all the children should be viewed as the best strategy, as a public health strategy which would surely protect many children from tuberculosis and other infections."}
