{"title": "", "body": "various pneumonias caused by diverse viral organisms, CT features include poorly defined centrilobular nodules, GGO with a lobular distribution, segmental consolidation, and diffuse GGO with thickened interlobular septa (3) . Pleural effusion or necrotic lung abnormality is rarely seen. Particularly, in severe acute respiratory syndrome, for which corona viruses are also being implicated, common CT features are GGO and lower lobe and peripheral lung distributions (4). In middle-east respiratory syndrome (MERS) caused by coronavirus infection, bilateral subpleural and lower lung zone-predominant GGO and consolidation were the most commonly observed findings (5, 6) .\n\nThe main role of imaging in viral infection lies in the detection or exclusion of pneumonia. Other roles include narrowing down of the differential diagnosis of pneumonia with respect to the involved causative organisms in consideration of the patterns, distribution, and extent of lung abnormalities. Further diagnostic approaches may be clued into. The response to antibiotic therapy may be evaluated using follow-up imaging studies (7) . Particularly with the pattern approach, viral pneumonia in an immunocompetent cohort can be further divided into three patterns, namely, bilateral bronchopneumonia, organizing pneumonia, and diffuse alveolar damage patterns. With this approach, patient management (necessitating ventilation support) and prognostication could be determined. Kang kjronline.org show a poor prognosis and need ventilation therapy in the intensive care unit (8) . In cases of MERS, the mean number of lung segments involved was higher in the mortality group than in the recovered group, and pleural effusion correlated with a poor prognosis (9) .\n\nAlthough CT findings of 2019-nCoV pneumonia were well described in the current study (1) and in the study by Chung et al. (2) , the authors did not depict the detailed distribution or the extent of lung abnormalities. With a detailed analysis, authors could have drawn specific patterns of lung abnormalities, including organizing pneumonia, bilateral bronchopneumonia, and diffuse alveolar damage patterns. If such a pattern could have been drawn, the patient prognosis could have been predicted.\n\nThe author has no potential conflicts of interest to disclose.\n\nORCID iD Kyung Soo Lee https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3660-5728"}
