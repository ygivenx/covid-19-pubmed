{"title": "Intradermal Immunization with rAAV1 Vector Induces Robust Memory CD8 + T Cell Responses Independently of Transgene Expression in DCs", "body": "Since the initial reports showing that recombinant vectors derived from the single-stranded DNA parvovirus adeno-associated virus (rAAV) could generate adaptive immune responses against the encoded transgene, 1-3 rAAVs have progressively drawn interest as potential vaccine vehicles. rAAVs can lead to a high level of transgene expression in target tissue, are devoid of any encoded viral gene, and have been well tolerated in clinical trials so far. 4, 5 Numerous serotypes and capsid variants have further been characterized, allowing both heterologous prime/boost regimens as well as broad tissue tropism, of particular interest for the induction of local immunity. Experiments conducted in various animal models have confirmed the ability of rAAV to drive sustained protective humoral immunity through a variety of injection routes. 6 However, reports of function-ally impaired memory CD8 + T cell responses induced following intramuscular immunization led to the current paradigm that rAAV vectors are poorly suited for the induction of cellular immunity, 7, 8 a key requirement for protective immunity against intracellular pathogens.\n\nSub-cellular localization of the transgene product, 3, 9 presence of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II epitopes, 9 vector dose, capsid serotype, route of immunization, 2,10 and target tissue inflammatory status 11, 12 have all been shown to influence the generation of adaptive immunity following rAAV injection. 13 A key limitation of rAAV vectors in generating potent cytotoxic T cell (cytotoxic T lymphocyte [CTL]) responses to encoded transgenes notably resides in the limited triggering of local inflammation and poor transduction of antigen-presenting cells achieved by most common rAAV serotypes. [14] [15] [16] [17] The latter most probably imposes an enhanced reliance on efficient cross-presentation of tissue-expressed transgene products by dendritic cells (DCs) for efficient T cell priming following rAAV-mediated vaccination.\n\nWhile muscles harbor few macrophages and DCs at the steady state, [18] [19] [20] the skin houses an extensive network of residing DCs 21 and represents a very well-characterized tissue for vaccine delivery. 22 Efficient cross-presentation capacity from defined subsets of skin DCs have been reported. 23, 24 More importantly, experimental data obtained in the context of vaccinia virus immunization suggest that the direct presentation pathway is dispensable in the context of intradermal, but not intramuscular, immunization. 25 In spite of clear interest for potential rAAV-based vaccines, scarce data exist regarding adaptive immune responses induced following rAAV intradermal immunization, with, to our knowledge, only one report focused on anti-transgene humoral responses. 26 Using a model rAAV2/1 vector, we report in this study that, in synergy with CD4 + T cell help, targeting the skin with rAAV2/1 vectors expressing a model ovalbumin transgene leads to increased numbers and quality of all main anti-transgene memory CD8 + T cell subsets. Most importantly, this process appeared to solely rely on the enhanced cross-presentation of skin-expressed transgene products, eliminating the need for additional strategies aimed at enhancing rAAV-mediated DC transduction.\n\nTo investigate the impact of skin targeting on the generation of memory CD8 + T cell responses in the context of rAAV-based vaccines, we made use of an rAAV2/1 vector encoding a full-length membrane-bound form of the ovalbumin model antigen fused to the UTY 246 and DBY 608 male HY antigen epitopes (rAAV2/1-mOVA-HY) ( Figure 1A) . We previously described, in the context of intramuscular immunization, that this rAAV2/1 construct induces strong OVA 257 -specific CD8 + T cell and DBY 608 -specific CD4 + T cell responses in female mice. 9 In male mice, who are naturally tolerant to male antigens, the DBY 608 -specific CD4 + T cell response is absent, 27 while the OVA 257 -specific CD8 + T cell response is curtailed and strongly dependent on transgene expression in hematopoietic cells. 9 Of importance, male mice respond similarly to CD4-depleted female mice in this setting, 9 and the MHC class II-restricted OVA 323 epitope does not lead to detectable CD4 + T cell response.\n\nWe first tested whether OVA 257 -and DBY 608 -specific T cell responses could be obtained following intradermal immunization. Two weeks after immunization in the ear, a clear DBY 608 -specific CD4 + Th1 response could be observed in the spleen of C57BL/6 female, but not male, mice ( Figure 1B) Mean \u00b1 SEM (n = 8-10 mice per group, pooled from at least three independent experiments). *p < 0.05 and ****p < 0.0001 (two-way ANOVA/Sidak's test). (D) Female mice were immunized in the ear dermis (i.d.) with 5 \u00c2 10 10 vg rAAV2/1-mOVA-HY (mOVA-HY). Injected ear was collected at day 14 after immunization, and 20-mm ear sections were stained with anti-CD8 (red) and anti-MHC class II (blue) antibodies. Left image shows the Z-project (maximum intensity) of an original 1,345 \u00c2 852 \u00c2 8-mm mosaic image acquired on a LEICA SP8 confocal microscope using a 40\u00c2/1.30 Oil CS2 PL APO objective. Right image shows an enlargement of the region of interest depicted in the top right corner of the left image. Images analysis was performed using ImageJ software.\n\nOVA 257 -specific CD8 + T cell response could be observed in the blood ( Figure 1C ) and spleen (data not shown) of intradermally immunized female mice, to levels similar to intramuscularly immunized mice. CD8 + T cell infiltration could further be observed in the dermis and epidermis of injected ears ( Figure 1D ). In male mice, in the absence of CD4 + T cell help, the OVA 257 -specific CD8 + T cell response was reduced ( Figure 1C ), as previously seen following intramuscular immunization 9 ( Figure 1C ). These results thus highlight the skin as a suitable target organ for vaccination with rAAV2/1-based vaccines, and they extend our previous observations in the skeletal muscle regarding the impact of CD4 + T cell help on primary CD8 + T cell responses induced by rAAV2/1 vectors.\n\nRoute of Immunization and CD4 + T Cell Help Synergize in Regulating the Induction of Bona Fide Memory CD8 + T Cells following rAAV2/1 Immunization\n\nTo characterize the impact of the route of immunization on the formation of memory CD8 + T cells following rAAV-mediated immunization, we next analyzed the phenotype of memory CD8 + T cells generated following a single prime with this model rAAV-based vaccine. By day 60-80, intramuscular immunization with rAAV2/1, in the absence of help, mostly induced low numbers of splenic OVA-specific (OVA 257 + ) terminally differentiated effector (CD44 hi KLRG1 + CD62L \u00c0 T eff ) and effector memory (CD44 hi KLRG1 \u00c0 CD62L \u00c0 T em ) CD8 + T cells as well as a population of draining lymph node-resident OVA 257 + CD8 + T em (Figures S1A and S1B). Importantly, as compared to a control rAAV2/1 vector, no significant population of central memory (CD44 hi KLRG1 \u00c0 CD62L + T cm ) CD8 + T cells could be detected in the lymphoid organs of most of the intramuscularly immunized mice.\n\nThe overall frequency of OVA-specific memory CD8 + T cells being generated appeared greatly impacted by CD4 + T cell help, but not by the route of administration, in line with our observations at the peak of the effector CD8 + T cell response (Figures 2A and 2B ). However, in the context of intramuscular immunization, simply adding CD4 + T cell help (female intramuscular versus male intramuscular) did not lead to an increased generation of central memory (T cm ) and effector memory (T em ) CD8 + T cells ( Figures 2B and 2C) . CD4 + T cell help indeed mostly induced splenic KLRG1 + effector CD8 + T cells ( Figure 2C ). Significant increases in OVA 257 + CD8 + T cm and T em in both spleen and draining lymph nodes were solely observed following intradermal immunization in the presence of CD4 + T cell help (female intradermal) ( Figure 2C ). This result suggested a key role for skin-derived cues, in synergy with CD4 + T cell help, in the regulation of long-term memory CD8 + T cell differentiation.\n\nRe-expression of receptors involved in receiving survival signals from the environment is a key step for long-term memory T cell generation. IL-7Ra (CD127), naturally expressed by naive T cells, downregulated upon activation, and re-expressed upon memory differentiation, 28 is a prototype example of such receptors. In the context of an intramuscular immunization in the absence of help, IL-7Ra was weakly re-expressed by both anti-transgene long-lived effector and effector memory populations generated ( Figure S1C ). Simply switching from an intramuscular to an intradermal route of immunization was sufficient to restore IL-7Ra reexpression on splenic OVA 257 + T em ( Figure 2D ), to levels even higher than on naive CD8 + T cells, and partial re-expression on splenic KLRG1 + T eff (data not shown). CD4 + T cell help alone had little to no impact. Interestingly, the OVA 257 + T cm population, uniquely generated following intradermal immunization in the presence of CD4 + T cell help, bore an even higher level of IL-7Ra ( Figure 2E ).\n\nAnother key property of memory CD8 + T cells, and predictive marker of protective immunity, 29, 30 is their capacity to rapidly perform multiple effector functions, including the production of various effector cytokines. Intramuscular immunization in the absence of CD4 + T cell help led to OVA-specific CD8 + T cells mostly capable of producing interferon (IFN)g, with less than 30% and 5% capable of producing tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) and interleukin-2 (IL-2), respectively ( Figure 3A ). CD4 + T cell help or skin targeting independently enhanced the overall polyfunctionality of generated memory T cells in the spleen ( Figure 3B ). Intradermal immunization, however, had the highest impact on IL-2 production ( Figure 3A) , as well as a unique impact on the differentiation of polyfunctional memory CTLs in draining lymph nodes ( Figure 3B ).\n\nOverall these results demonstrate a key synergy between CD4 + T cell help and the route of administration in controlling the full acquisition of a bona fide central and effector/memory phenotype on anti-transgene CD8 + T cells following rAAV immunization. These results are further in line with the absence of detectable long-term expression of the transgene in the skin, but not in the muscle, as previously described, 7 of immunized female mice ( Figure S2 ).\n\nBeside transgene intrinsic factors, such as encoded MHC class II epitopes, the ability of a given rAAV serotype to efficiently transduce DCs in vivo, and thus lead to efficient direct presentation of the transgene product, has been brought forward as a key limiting factor for rAAV vectors in inducing potent CTL responses. 14-17 Underlying evidences for such a paradigm, however, have mostly been derived from intramuscular or intraperitoneal immunizations, and they might not fully reflect known differences in peripheral tissues' DC networks and potential to cross-present exogenous antigens. We thus next investigated the requirement for transgene expression in DCs for the induction of CD8 + T cell responses upon rAAV2/1 vector administration in the skin.\n\nTo address this question, we made use of an miR142-3p-regulated rAAV2/1-mOVA-HY construct ( Figure 4A ). The microRNA miR142-3p is naturally expressed in all cells of the hematopoietic lineage. The adjunction of miR142-3p target sequences to the transgene was shown to lead to a robust suppression of transgene expression www.moleculartherapy.org in all hematopoietic cells, including DC populations, upon lentiviral transduction. 31 Similar results were obtained here using rAAV2/1mediated transduction of the DC2.4 H2-K b -expressing murine DC cell line ( Figure S3A ), with similar transduction efficiency for both vectors ( Figure S3B ). It should be noted that, in line with previous reports in human DCs, 32 this single-stranded rAAV construct appeared poorly expressed in DCs and only led to limited direct transgene pre- Figure 2 . Route of Immunization and CD4 + T Cell Help Synergize in Regulating the Generation of Effector/ Memory CD8 + T Cells Anti-OVA memory CD8 + T cell responses were analyzed between day 60 and day 80 post-immunization in the spleen or draining lymph nodes (dLNs) of male or female mice immunized in the tibialis anterior (i.m.) or ear dermis (i.d.) with 3 \u00c2 10 10 vg rAAV2/1-mOVA-HY (mOVA-HY) (see also Figure S1 for mice immunized with a control rAAV2/1 vector Relative IL-7Ra expression is represented as the ratio of the indicated cell population MedianFI over the MedianFI of the endogenous naive CD8 + T cell population of the same individual to account for potential inter-experimental variations in the CD127 staining. Only mice with significant levels of each OVA 257 + T memory subset of interest (above mean + 3 SD of control vector) were included in the analysis. Mean \u00b1 SEM (A-E, n = 5-11 mice per group, pooled from at least three independent experiments). n.s., nonsignificant; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, and ****p < 0.0001 (A-D, two-way ANOVA/Sidak's test; E, repeatedmeasure (RM) one-way ANOVA/Sidak's test).\n\nsentation in vitro in the DC2.4 cell line, even at the highest MOI ( Figure S3C ).\n\nAs previously shown, 9 intramuscular immunization with an miR142-3p-regulated rAAV2/1-mOVA-HY construct, in the absence of the DBY 608 -specific CD4 + Th1 response, did lead to a reduced CD8 + T cell response ( Figure 4B ). In contrast, similar CD8 + T cell responses were observed for both constructs following intradermal immunization in male mice, with only a mild reduction in the intensity of the response at day 14. These results suggested that direct priming by DCs is dispensable for the induction of strong CD8 + T cell responses following skin targeting with rAAV2/1 vectors. In the context of intramuscular immunization, however, efficient cross-priming of transgene-specific CTLs with tissue-expressed transgene products was only seen in the presence of a concomitant DBY 608 -specific helper T cell response ( Figure 4C ). Importantly, we also observed that potent generation of all memory subsets following immunization with our miR142-3p-regulated construct appeared to follow the same rules as seen with the wild-type mOVA-HY construct. Maximal induction of all effector/memory Only mice with significant levels of OVA 257 + memory T cells in the spleen (above mean + 3 SD of control vector) were included in this analysis (n = 5-8 mice per group, pooled from at least three independent experiments). Analysis and presentation of distributions were performed using SPICE version 5.1 on background-(unstimulated) corrected data. Pairwise comparison of all distributions inside each panel was performed using a Student's t test and a partial permutation test as described; 56 only significant (p < 0.05) differences are displayed (*p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01).\n\nsubsets, and most notably OVA 257 + CD8 + T cm , was only achieved when combining skin targeting and strong CD4 + T cell help (Figure 5A) , and it reached frequencies indistinguishable from those generated with the wild-type mOVA-HY construct for all effector/ memory subsets. Similar trends were observed when analyzing CD127 expression on OVA 257 + CD8 + T em and T cm (Figures 5B and 5C) and overall polyfunctionality of generated anti-transgene memory CTLs ( Figure 5D ). It should be noted, however, that after intramuscular immunization CD4 + T cell help alone was insufficient to restore maximal CTL polyfunctionality against an miR142-3pregulated transgene ( Figure 5D ), unlike the wild-type mOVA-HY construct. Targeting the skin proved indispensable in this context.\n\nTo further test whether memory CTL responses generated by the sole cross-presentation of skin-expressed transgene products confers protective advantage in the context of a secondary pathogen encounter, we challenged mice intraperitoneally (i.p.) with lethal doses of 10 6 colony-forming units (CFUs) of OVA-expressing recombinant Listeria monocytogenes (Lm-OVA). Protective immunity against this model pathogen has been shown to rely mostly on Lmspecific CTLs. 33 Female mice previously immunized with a control rAAV2/1 vector gradually lost weight up to day 3 post-infection ( Figure 5E ), at which time point the mice being analyzed harbored up to 10 8 CFUs of Lm-OVA in the spleen, in line with the known kinetic of pathogenesis associated with Lm infection. 34 In contrast, intradermal cross-priming induced by a single rAAV2/1-mOVA-HY-miR immunization was sufficient to achieve clear protection, with weight loss curtailed by day 2 ( Figure 5E ) and complete clearance of the bacterial load by day 3 in 90% of analyzed female mice. Infection was also controlled in rAAV2/1-mOVA-HY-miR-immunized male mice ( Figure 5E ), both intradermal and intramuscular, but weight loss was only curtailed by day 3, and incomplete bacterial clearance could be observed in 30% of intramuscularly immunized male mice at this time point. This observation is in line with the quantitatively and qualitatively enhanced effector/memory CD8 + T cell responses observed in the presence of CD4 + T cell help ( Figure 5A ).\n\nThe results obtained in our model system with the miR142-3p-regulated construct suggested key differences regarding the reliance of CTL responses on efficient transgene expression in DCs between the muscle and the skin, two tissues routinely targeted for vaccination. As differences in cross-priming could result from either enhanced tissue-expressed transgene cross-presentation or local environmental cues enhancing T cell priming, we next aimed at directly monitoring cross-presentation events in vivo.\n\nIn mice immunized with rAAV2/1-mOVA-HY via the intramuscular route, robust activation of transferred naive OVA-specific T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic OT-1 CD8 + T cells was detected by day 5 and restricted to muscle-draining lymph nodes ( Figure S4 ). Surprisingly, no clear transgene expression could be detected at this time point in any of the DC subpopulations sorted from the injected tibialis anterior muscle or its draining lymph nodes ( Figure 6A ; Figure S5 ), despite clear expression in the injected tibialis anterior muscle. Low expression, equivalent to the level seen in DC2.4 cells in the context of a 10 4 MOI ( Figure S3A ), could only be detected in CD11b + migratory DCs harvested from ear draining lymph nodes in two of three experiments following rAAV2/1-mOVA-HY, but not rAAV2/1-mOVA-HY-miR142-3pT, intradermal immunization ( Figures 6B  and 6C ). OVA 257 presentation, however, was reproducibly observed from lymphoid CD8a + DCs and migratory CD103 + and CD11b + DCs following both intramuscular and intradermal immunization with the rAAV2/1-mOVA-HY vector ( Figures 6D and 6E) , with notably strong presentation from ear-draining lymph node CD103 + migratory DCs. In line with the restriction of transgene expression to non-hematopoietic tissues, the miR142-3p-regulated OVA transgene appeared solely presented by migratory DCs in both skin and muscle-draining lymph nodes, with presentation in the latter mostly restricted to the CD103 + subset ( Figure 6E ).\n\nAs the CD103 + migratory DC subset only accounted for less than 10% of all DCs in both skin and muscle-draining lymph nodes at this time point ( Figure S5A ), we went back in vivo to assess the physiological consequences of restricting transgene expression to non-hematopoietic lineages. The addition of miR142-3p target sequences to the construct led to a reduced and delayed presentation of OVA 257 following intramuscular immunization ( Figure 7A ), in line with the observed reduction in DC presentation and in the primary CD8 + T cell responses (Figures 4B and 6E) . CD4 + T cell help only had a limited impact on the presentation of the miR142-3p-regulated transgene ( Figure 7B ). Interestingly, robust activation of transferred OT-1 was already detected by day 5 following intradermal immunization with the miR142-3p-regulated mOVA-HY construct and to levels continuously higher than in the intramuscular control group up to day 9 ( Figure 7C ). As this could simply reflect a quantitative effect rather than a qualitative difference with respect to the contribution of the cross-presentation pathway following skin delivery, we further analyzed OVA 257 presentation following intradermal immunization using lower doses of both wild-type and miR142-3p-regulated mOVA-HY constructs. In contrast to the striking difference in OVA 257 presentation observed at day 5 between both constructs following immunization in the muscle at the highest dose ( Figure 7A ), MHC class I presentation of skin-targeted OVA transgene was equally effective at all doses studied ( Figure 7D ).\n\nOverall our results confirm a marked dependency on cross-presentation for the overall MHC class I presentation of rAAV transgenes, with no detectable direct presentation by major DC subsets in our experimental setting. They further suggest a dual source, tissue and hematopoietic cell derived, for transgene cross-presentation, with skin DCs exhibiting an enhanced potential for cross-presentation of tissue-expressed neo-antigens. The limited cross-presentation efficacy of muscle-expressed antigen imposes enhanced reliance on additional cues from the immune system, such as CD4 + T cell help, to induce potent cross-priming of CTL responses.

Mean \u00b1 SEM (A-D, n = 5-11 mice per group, pooled from at least three independent experiments). n.s., non-significant; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, and ****p < 0.0001 (A and B, two-way ANOVA/Sidak's test; C, RM one-way ANOVA/Sidak's test). \n\nIn this study, we made use of a unique model transgene to address three potential requirements for optimal rAAV-induced CD8 + T cell memory: CD4 + T cell help, direct expression of the transgene in antigen-presenting cell, and optimal immunization route. Our results first exemplify a previously unappreciated synergy between CD4 + T cell help and skin targeting in regulating optimal differentiation of anti-transgene CTL memory. Of outmost interest for rAAV vaccines, our results further demonstrate a strong requirement for transgene cross-presentation in the context of rAAV immunization, and they highlight transgene expression in hematopoietic cells as an important source of antigen for cross-presentation in the context of intramuscular, but not intradermal, immunization.\n\nThe first key finding of our study is that targeting the skin, as compared to the skeletal muscle, resulted in a significant increase in the frequencies of systemic antigen-specific CD62L \u00c0 CD127 high KLRG1 \u00c0 T em and CD62L + CD127 high KLRG1 \u00c0 T cm CD8 + T cells. This further correlated with an increased frequency of antigen-specific IL-2 + TNF-a + IFNg + triple producers. IL-2 is a key cytokine for secondary proliferation of memory CD8 + T cells, 35 and the absence of potent IL-2 producers among rAAV-induced memory CTLs following intramuscular immunization has been correlated with reduced responses to a secondary boost. 7, 8 The impact of the route of administration on the priming of anti-transgene CTLs reported in our study is in line with previous reports performed in the context of gene therapy and vaccination with rAAV2 vectors. 2, 36 Namely, compared to intramuscular immunization, subcutaneous immunization has been shown to induce stronger CTL responses, 2 and intranasal immunization has been shown to induce enhanced frequencies of IL-2-producing anti-transgene CD8 + T cell responses. 36 While the precise phenotypes of memory CTL being generated has not been fully examined in these studies, we would like to suggest that the results obtained here in the skin regarding the quality of memory CD8 + T cell responses apply to other routes of immunization, such as the intranasal route.\n\nAn interesting question raised by our study is the exact nature of the mechanism(s) driving long-term memory CD8 + T cell differentiation following intradermal immunization. A number of mechanisms have been considered so far to explain the limited induction of potent effector/memory CTLs following intramuscular immunization with rAAV vectors. This includes rAAV-intrinsic, poor DC transduction ability 14 and insufficient inflammatory responses leading to poor MHC class I upregulation on myocytes 16 and sustained transgene expression, 7, 16 or transgene-intrinsic limitations, lack of potent MHC class II epitope in the construct. 7, 8 Our results suggest that a combination of signals might be needed. CD4 + T cell help is indeed required for the generation of bona fide memory CTLs following intradermal immunization with rAAV2/1 vectors, in line with its key impact on CTL cross-priming via DC \"licensing\" 37 or IL-2 production. 38 CD4 + T cell help by itself, however, only promoted enhanced differentiation of terminally differentiated KLRG1 + effector CD8 + T cells in the context of intramuscular immunization, as previously shown in the context of immune responses to several pathogens. 39 Interestingly, targeting the skin did not result in enhanced transgene expression in DCs at the time of the first wave of antigen presentation in the draining lymph node, although we cannot rule out earlier expression leading to multiple distinct T cell-DC interactions. 40 Moreover, the induction of potent anti-transgene memory CD8 + T cell responses following intradermal immunization appeared independent of transgene expression in hematopoietic cells. Finally, targeting the skin was indeed associated with a better long-term clearance of the transgene. However, whether loss of transgene expression precedes or is the result of the enhanced differentiation of CTLs is still unknown.\n\nDifferences in environmental cues [41] [42] [43] or DC subsets 44 are among the numerous mechanisms already proposed for the regulation of effector/memory CD8 + T cell fate. Our starting hypothesis was that the skin, which naturally harbors a very large and diverse DC population 21 in direct contact with the commensal flora, 45 would be less dependent than the skeletal muscle on vector-intrinsic inflammatory properties for the recruitment and activation of memory CD8 + T cells through the cross-presentation pathway. Combining, for the first time, in vivo and ex vivo analysis of transgene presentation by DCs with restriction of transgene expression to non-hematopoietic cells, our data highlight key differences between skeletal muscle and skin in anti-transgene T cell priming. In the context of intramuscular immunization, we found that presentation of hematopoietic cell-expressed transgene by lymph node-resident CD8a + DCs was essential to drive potent CD8 + T cell responses. Following intradermal immunization, lymphoid CD8a + DCs, as well as migratory CD103 + DCs, similarly presented hematopoietic cell-expressed transgene products. However, the complete loss of such presentation events only led to a 2-fold reduction at the peak of the primary CD8 + T cell response, and the sole cross-presentation of skin-expressed transgene was sufficient for the maximal induction of memory CTL responses. This points to a Previous studies had highlighted the potency of cross-presentation in vivo for the induction of primary CTL responses to vaccinia virus, 25 modified vaccinia virus Ankara, 46 or lentivirus vectors. 47 Our results now illustrate the key impact of the cellular source of antigen on the efficiency of such cross-presentation events, complementing previous studies in the field. 47, 48 Enhanced cross-presentation of cell-associ-ated antigen following local (intradermal) rather than systemic (intravenous) delivery has been described in the context of a membranebound OVA model antigen. 49 Our results suggest that this might represent a unique property of the skin not shared by all other peripheral tissues, including the skeletal muscle. The potency of skin-expressed transgene cross-presentation further suggests that efficient induction of memory CTL responses should solely depend on the ability of a given vector to drive antigen expression in non-hematopoietic skin cells. While this extends beyond the initial scope of this study, understanding whether this holds true in the context of other rAAV serotypes as well as injection techniques designed to better target the various layers of the skin, such as micro-needles, 50 patches and skin surface stripping, 22 or transcutaneous vaccination via laser microporation, 51 could prove of key interest. Overall, our study highlights the skin as a potentially interesting target site for future rAAV-based vaccines. Adding to the dose-sparing potential of intradermal immunization, 52 we believe that these results will prompt for a more global assessment of the potential of individual rAAV serotype to induce strong cell-mediated immune responses and protective memory following intradermal vaccination.\n\nThe 53 and donor Rag1 \u00c0/\u00c0 OT-I (CD45.2) mice, carrying a TCR specific for OVA 257 bound to H-2K b , were bred in our animal facility.\n\nThe mOVA-HY-expressing constructs and recombinant AAV2/1pseudotyped vectors were prepared as previously described. 9 Briefly, the mOVA cDNA 54 was fused to DBY 608 and UTY 246 epitopes encoding sequences encompassed, respectively, by five N-terminal and 15 C-terminal amino acids and four N-terminal and four C-terminal amino acids of their original protein sequence to ensure normal processing. This construct was further inserted in a pSMD2 AAV2 plasmid between the hPGK promoter and a polyA signal to create the pSMD2-mOVA-HY construct. For the pSMD2-mOVA-HY-miR construct, four repeats of the miR142-3p target sequence 31 were additionally inserted in the 3 0 UTR of the pSMD2-mOVA-HY plasmid. The control vectors used throughout this study were AAV2/1-pseudotyped vector coding for the Cre recombinase.\n\nLymphoid organ-cell suspensions were prepared from immunized recipients by mechanically dissociating spleen, pooled popliteal and inguinal (muscle-draining) lymph nodes, or pooled superficial cervical (parotid and mandibular; ear-draining) lymph nodes in sterile 1\u00c2 PBS containing 0.1% human serum albumin (HSA). 2 \u00c2 10 6 cells per organ were then directly stained or re-stimulated for 5 hr in vitro in 200 mL complete RPMI medium containing 2 mg/mL brefeldin A (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 mg/mL OVA 257 peptide (SIINFEKL, ProteoGenix).\n\nOT-1 cell suspensions were prepared by mechanically dispersing pooled spleen, inguinal, axillary, cervical, and mesenteric lymph nodes of donor Rag1 \u00c0/\u00c0 OT-I mice in sterile 1\u00c2 PBS containing 0.1% HSA. Cell suspensions were further stained in 1\u00c2 PBS containing 2 mg/mL Violet Proliferation Dye 450 (VPD, BD Biosciences) for 8 min at 37 C followed by two washes in 1\u00c2 PBS containing 2% HSA and 0.1% HSA, respectively. The 2 \u00c2 10 6 VPD-labeled cells were then injected into the retro-orbital venous sinus of previously immunized mice in a final volume of 200 mL 1\u00c2 PBS.\n\nFor DC sorts, draining lymph nodes or injected tissues from three rAAV2/1-immunized mice were pooled for each experiment. Draining lymph node-cell suspensions were prepared by incubating for 45 min at 37 C in 1\u00c2 PBS containing 2.5 mg/mL Collagenase D (Roche), 3 mM CaCl 2 and 20 mg/mL DNase-I (Sigma-Aldrich), and they were further enriched for B220 \u00c0 CD90.2 \u00c0 NK1.1 \u00c0 cells using functional grade purified anti-B220 (RA3-6B2) and anti-NK1. manufacturer's instructions, and subsequent staining was performed in eBioscience Permeabilization buffer (eBioscience) for 30 min at 4 C using a combination of PE anti-IL-2 (JES6-5H4), PE-Cy7 anti-TNF-a (MP6-XT22), and APC anti-IFNg (XMG1.2). Data were collected on a FACSCanto II or LSR-II Fortessa flow cytometer and further analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star). All antibodies were purchased from BioLegend unless stated otherwise.\n\nMice were challenged i.p. with 10 6 CFUs of a recombinant strain of Listeria monocytogenes expressing OVA and an erythromycin resistance marker. 55 Then 3 days after the challenge, spleen was homogenized and lysed in 0.9% NaCl, and bacterial titers were assessed by plating dilutions on brain-heart infusion agar supplemented with 5 mg/mL erythromycin and grown for 2 to 3 days at 37 C. The lowest dilution used was a 1/16 dilution of the original solution, giving us a limit of detection <100 CFUs/spleen.\n\nTotal RNA was isolated using the NucleoSpin RNA purification kit (Macherey-Nagel) according to the manufacturer's instructions and further submitted to an extra DNase treatment step using the TURBO DNA-free kit (Life Technologies). For quantification of OVA mRNA, total RNA was further reverse transcribed using random primers and the SuperScript II Reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies). 4 mL cDNA was then subjected to real-time PCR amplification using Ova-F (5 0 -AAGCAGGCAGAGAGGTGGTA-3 0 ), Ova-R (5 0 -GAA TGGATGGTCAGCCCTAA-3 0 ), b-actin-F (5 0 -AAGATCTGGCAC CACACCTTCT-3 0 ), and b-actin-R (5 0 -TTTTCACGGTTGGCCT TAGG-3 0 ) primers. For all reaction mixtures, 10 mL QuantiFast SYBR Green mastermix (Life Technologies) was used in a final volume of 20 mL, with OVA primers at 500 nM and b-actin primers at 400 nM. Quantification of the relative amounts of OVA mRNA for each sample was then done using the DDCt method, normalizing against b-actin mRNA and using as common reference for all experiments cDNA generated from a pool of rAAV2/1-cOVA-injected tibialis anterior from Rag2 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice.\n\nAll data are shown as mean \u00b1 SEM. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism Software version 6. When indicated, non-parametric Wilcoxon tests (two groups), Kruskal-Wallis/Dunn's test or repeated-measure (RM) one-way ANOVA (three or more groups), or two-way ANOVA followed by Sidak's post-test analysis (two variables, such as CD4 + T cell help and route of immunization) was performed for selected pairwise comparisons. The minimal level of confidence at which the result was considered significant was p < 0.05 (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, and ****p < 0.0001).\n\nSupplemental Information includes five figures and can be found with this article online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymthe.2017.06.019."}
