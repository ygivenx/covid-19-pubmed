{"title": "Chapters 33.1 and 33.2 Chapter 33", "body": "While traditional manufacturing and agricultural work have engaged increasingly smaller percentages of workers in developed countries, newer production sectors, characterized by the utilization of rapidly evolving technologies, have gained increasing importance in the US and world economy. The most prominent of these are microelectronics, biotechnology, aerospace, and communications technologies. Compared to more traditional sectors, these activities involve different workforce demographics, novel environments, potential exposures to incompletely studied physical, chemical, and biologic hazards under rapid and changing workplace conditions. These characteristics require the development of new paradigms for occupational health practice and workplace hazard control. The purpose of this chapter is to outline some of the workplace health issues in these sectors, focusing on microelectronics and biotechnology, and to propose directions future practice might profitably evolve.\n\nUnlike conventional manufacturing, which may entail sharp distinctions between the work experience of minimally skilled hourly workers, skilled technicians, and supervisors, the new high technology workplace usually requires a substantially higher proportion of workers with advanced skills and integration. Engineers and scientists often work closely with skilled technicians. Many will perform multiple, complex tasks which are frequently changing. Moreover, for reasons including economic volatility, advancement opportunities, and competitive hiring practices, workers in these industries tend to change employers, job duties, and locations frequently, creating complex work histories. For obvious reasons, the workforce in most of the sector is relatively younger, more diverse in ethnicity and gender, and there are few unions or trade organizations relative to traditional sectors.\n\nThe work environment can be even more radically different. Most new technologies involve manipulation of materials and products that are intrinsically costly, such as a silicon wafer or a genetically modified sow, so production systems are organized around product quality assurance. One consequence, evident in both the electronics and biotechnology industries, is the shift of production from factory environments to 'clean' rooms -specialized, limited-access work areas where workers wear protective clothing and equipment that limits the possibility of contaminating the product physically, chemically, or biologically. Lighting, ventilation and other ambient conditions are set to protect the product, creating environments with unusual characteristics. For example, any particle inadvertently introduced into the air in semiconductor wafer fabrication rooms (fabs) is rapidly removed by filtration. Likewise, reverse isolation techniques are used to breed genetically engineered animals for biomedical uses. In each setting, the increasingly critical need to separate product (the wafers) from people to avoid particulate contamination -through automation, robotics, and separately exhausted enclosures -has led to reductions in the potential exposure to production chemicals. However, workers frequently wear uncomfortable personal protective equipment, have more limited opportunities for breaks, and have little flexibility to make environmental or task accommodations (such as opening windows) that can enhance and humanize the work experience in more traditional settings. Protection of the product may also impose constraints on the extent to which mechanical aspects of work can be modified, e.g., enhancing ergonomic risks, as occurs in the healthcare sector (see Chapter 17) , although use of automation and robotics can reduce some ergonomic hazards.\n\nPerhaps none of this would warrant unique consideration were it not for the nature of the hazards which have been introduced. For example, semiconductor wafer fabrication requires the use of a large number of chemicals, including inert, corrosive, and toxic gases, volatile organic compounds, polymers, and metals and metallic compounds. Many of these chemicals have not been well characterized toxicologically. Not only are there frequent introductions of new chemical agents in microelectronics and biohazards in biotechnology -often poorly tested or of unknown nature -but the exposure conditions can be unpredictable, sporadic, and generally hard to document.\n\nIn semiconductor manufacture, exposures are well controlled under usual conditions -samples typically contain very low or undetectable amounts of measured contaminants. 1 However, accidental leaks and spills occur infrequently which, as in other industries, are difficult to characterize and quantify. In biotechnology, as in other laboratory type settings, accidental exposures are the major concern, often controllable primarily by rigorous training and work practice measures, contrary to the traditional hierarchy of industrial hygiene controls. The potential for infectious, allergenic, or toxic reactions to inadequately characterized intermediate materials or end products is daunting, impeding design of meaningful surveillance programs or the diagnostic evaluation of worker complaints or illnesses. In addition, as in healthcare, there is the formidable task of preventing biologic contamination of the product, such as immunocompromised animals bred for biomedical or research purposes.\n\nFinally, rapid advances in technology can result in frequently changing the materials and work processes. For example, in some parts of the semiconductor industry fabrication rooms are reconfigured every several years. Genetic manipulation of organisms may result in the introduction of numerous new strains and variants, rendering the usual notions of a 'complete' exposure history almost meaningless, let alone the feasibility of epidemiologic evaluation of the exposed workforce.\n\nManufacture of computer chips on silicon wafers involves exotic multi-step processes, which change frequently. The following is a brief overview; more complete discussion can be found in the suggested readings. [2] [3] [4] The first step is making the wafer -a large round platter of almost pure silicon or, less commonly, gallium arsenide. Wafer manufacturing occurs in a few separate dedicated manufacturing facilities, which are not part of the semiconductor wafer fabrication environment. To achieve this, quartz is reduced to silicon under very high temperature, ground to a powder then gassified in hydrogen and chlorine to trichlorosilane, which is reduced to pure silicon. A small crystal 'seed' is then dipped into the liquid silicon at the ends of a rod, allowing the crystal to grow while intentionally introducing very small quantities of impurities ('doping') such as boron, arsenic or phosphorus. These huge crystals are then machined (including grinding, slicing, and lapping), etched (in acid) and polished to form the wafer on which hundreds of chips (die) will then be fabricated.\n\nThe majority of the potentially toxic chemicals are introduced during fabrication. First a layer of silicon dioxide is applied, which is then protected by coating with a layer of photoresist. Photoresists contain light-reactive chemicals, polymers, and carrier solvents. As in conventional photography, the wafer is exposed to a light source, intense ultraviolet (UV) light. The light passes through a mask, containing the pattern for the circuitry, causing polymerization or solubilization of the exposed photoresist, dependent upon the type of photoresist (negative or positive). The resulting surface is developed, requiring use of chemicals, primarily strong bases. For the typical positive resist, exposed areas of solubilized photoresist are removed by the developer. The resulting unprotected silicon dioxide surface can then be etched off by application of etchantsacids (wet etch) or excited gases (plasma etch).\n\nDoping involves the introduction of desired chemical impurities into that portion of the surface of the wafer, which is now unprotected. This process may be accomplished by diffusion at high temperatures of dopant gases through the surface of the silicon or by ion implantation, in which the dopant ions are beamed, under vacuum and high electric fields, onto the wafer from heated filaments. In thin film, thin layers of materials, including silicon, silicon dioxide, and silicon nitride, are placed onto the surface of the wafer, in furnaces or chemical vapor deposition tools, to provide a layer that protects the underlying surface or serves as an insulator. Typically one wafer will go through repeated sequences of these steps to create multiple layers of complex circuitry.\n\nWhen the circuits are complete, the wafer is metallizedthe introduction of metallic circuit connectors, typically by vapor deposition. The fab and associated processes can thus be divided into four major functional areas, photolithography, etch, thin film (which includes ion implantation and metallization), and diffusion. Final processing includes inspection and chip separation, assembly into packaging, and testing, with the last three activities conducted outside the wafer fabrication facility, typically at a separate location.\n\nAs noted, there is an extensive array of chemicals used in the manufacturing process, mostly, but not exclusively, in enclosed areas. Although a detailed review of the chemicals is beyond the scope of this chapter, some of the major chemical and physical hazards are shown in Tables \n\nDespite the plethora of potential risk factors and the exotic nature of the chemicals and work, most health problems reported by physicians in the industry or practicing in areas where the industry is concentrated have been fairly commonplace. Skin irritation, possibly exacerbated by low humidity and protective clothing, is common. Eye irritation is also frequently encountered. 4, 5 Respiratory complaints may be more common than in other industries, 5,6 although the majority are self-limited and poorly characterized irritative symptoms. Asthmatics and others with pre-existing airway disorders may find the environment problematic, perhaps due to the dry air in the fab or low-level irritation, although some allergic asthmatics report improvement in symptoms in an environment free of pollens and other particulates. Not surprisingly, syndromes resembling nonspecific building-related illness and multiple chemical sensitivity have also arisen (see Chapter 49) .\n\nIn addition to these medical reports, musculoskeletal problems have been encountered, 7 as might be expected from the complex and constantly changing organization of the clean rooms, although, compared with other industries, the work is not generally heavy or repetitive. Complaints related to heat and protective clothing occur, although significant heat-related illness does not. Complaints of difficulty hearing also occur in the fab environment, which is noisy but rarely exceeds noise action levels. Noise-related hearing loss does not appear to occur, with the possible exception of workers in mechanical support areas outside the fab. 4 The greatest concerns in the industry have centered around reproductive health and cancer. Spontaneous abortion excess was first reported in a Massachusetts company in the mid 1980s. 8 This prompted two large studies on an industry-wide basis, which confirmed excesses of about 1.4fold in the fab overall and ranging up to 70% in certain job categories. 9,10 Although the specific cause for the early fetal losses could not be ascertained with certainty, the clustering around jobs with exposure to photoresist solvents implicated ethylene glycol ethers because of their known reproductive/developmental toxicity in animals. In response, the industry has substituted less toxic glycol ethers, such as propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate, or other alternative solvents, such as ethyl lactate, for these compounds. In addition, the industry has enhanced some engineering and other controls and generally created procedures that facilitate accommodations or transfers for concerned pregnant employees. Only a portion of the observed excess of spontaneous abortion in one of the studies could be explained on the basis of potential exposure to glycol ethers; excesses in other areas, such as etch, remain unexplained, raising the question of other contributing factors, e.g., unrecognized developmental toxicity of another agent or other factors, such as ergonomic factors or stress.\n\nThe issue of cancer risk remains unresolved. In addition to compounds which have been poorly studied, there are potential exposures, albeit well controlled, in the fabrication process to numerous known or suspect carcinogens, such as arsenic and sulfuric acid. The levels of exposure, however, are typically far below those observed in epidemiologic studies of other worker groups exposed to these materials. Only one small study of cancer has been undertaken among workers in this environment; it failed to show any consistent risk, although the power to detect an effect was very low. 11 Given the concerns, it is likely that further attempts to quantify cancer risks will be undertaken in the future.\n\nCurrent practice in the industry is widely variable; a few companies have responded to public and worker concerns by instituting extensive medical monitoring, in some cases with data analysis for groups by job or work area. At present there is little data to support specific surveillance activities beyond those currently required in the US under OSHA, namely the reporting of occupational illnesses and injuries. Unfortunately, even the more intensive approach, providing questionnaire and medical information on a regular basis, will be of limited value in addressing the major unanswered questions about worker risks. For one thing, the outcomes of interest are not known with any certainty, and include a wide range of possible health effects; there is no single specific condition to perform surveillance around. Traditional health surveillance is intrinsically crosssectional in nature, and therefore unlikely to provide a barometer to track more chronic effects of exposure should these occur. Moreover, the absence of linkage between symptoms or other health information and exposure reduces the ability to compare rates among groups with divergent exposures of interest. High employee turnover, combined with rapid changes in production processes and exposure patterns, further compound the difficulties associated with a traditional medical surveillance approach.\n\nAn alternative approach, perhaps in combination with ongoing symptom and health status surveillance, would be an aggressive 'sentinel event' approach. In this model, proactive scrutiny of all reported workplace events, combined with routine scrutiny of health insurance data to evaluate patterns of chronic diseases such as cancers among workers and retirees, may provide a more sensitive way to detect unsuspected adverse health consequences of the work. Although each observation would require confirmation by application of more formal epidemiologic methods, such an approach offers a coherent alternative when traditional surveillance strategies have limited efficacy given the nature of the exposures and the industry.\n\nAny surveillance approach would require institution of three important prerequisites. First, it would be crucial that company personnel records are coded in such a way as to distinguish to the fullest extent possible the actual nature of an employee's job, rather than generic job titles which might be administratively simpler but inadequate for surveillance purposes. Second, records must be retained electronically, with appropriate documentation, for a minimum of three, and preferably four or five decades. This is crucial to evaluate the risks of chronic health effects. Finally, it would be desirable for health insurance records to be maintained by appropriate health data management companies, so that rates of illness and disease can be evaluated without complex and costly epidemiologic reconstructions as has been the case up until now.\n\nThe advent of biotechnology allows us to move genetic material within and between species. In theory, this allows us to produce any desired gene product in the species of our choice, including the alteration of the human genome for therapeutic purposes. In practice, the applications of biotechnology have focused on certain key areas that show agronomic, economic, and/or therapeutic promise. This technology has created new potential hazards and newly exposed worker populations within the biotechnology industry.\n\nTwo key areas of concern will be addressed here: the handling of plants genetically modified for food and feed purposes, and the production of biopharmaceuticals. In the former circumstance, the inserted genes and their products are characterized and selected to be appropriate for human or animal consumption. Human health risks in this area appear to be of lesser concern and do not appear to differ qualitatively from the risks inherent in the conduct of conventional agriculture. Issues of ecologic harm, such as environmental changes in neighboring plants or organisms sharing the same ecosystem, continue to be hotly debated, given the vast and diverse settings in which these food crops may be introduced. In the pharmaceutical area, however, proteins with known or anticipated human pharmacologic activity are being produced in a wide variety of species, resulting in a higher potential for adverse effects upon worker health.\n\nGenes may be inserted into food and feed crops for a variety of reasons -to confer selective resistance to herbicides; to confer resistance to pests; to confer agronomic traits such as drought or salt tolerance; to alter storage, processing, or cooking characteristics; or to improve the nutritional characteristics of a food or animal feed. In order to function, an inserted gene must be accompanied by gene regulatory sequences that allow expression of the gene within the plant. At present, many gene inserts also contain a marker for antibiotic resistance which is necessary to select for plant cells which have successfully acquired the desired gene insert, but such sequences are either not utilized in newer products or are removed from these products during development. The inserted gene is generally intended to produce a functional protein, although in some cases (antisense DNA mediated resistance to viral pathogens), no protein expression occurs. The protein products used in food and feed crops fall into several categories. 12 They may express pesticidal activity as in the case of the Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) toxin, or confer resistance to herbicides by incorporating a resistant variant of a normally occurring enzymatic activity or by allowing a plant to degrade a particular herbicide. The inserted gene may result in new plant structural proteins, or may confer new or enhanced enzymatic activity upon the plant so that new nutrients or enhanced levels of nutrients are produced. Inserted genetic material may also act by down-regulating or up-regulating existing genes, and may potentially have unintended effects upon other genes within the plant cell either by direct insertion into those genes or by indirect regulatory (so-called pleotropic) effects. 13 Potential novel occupational exposures resulting from the production of genetically modified feed and food crops include: (1) exposure to the novel protein; (2) exposure to the products of enzymatic activity conferred by the inserted protein, which may be either anticipated or unanticipated;\n\n(3) exposure to endogenous or novel plant toxins resulting from pleotropic effects; (4) effects mediated by antibiotic marker genes; and (5) effects of the inserted gene sequence itself.\n\nFortunately, food and feed products undergo safety evaluation prior to marketing, 12 greatly reducing some of these hypothetical risks. Although gene insertion is random, genetic events in crop plants are characterized to assure that normally expressed genes are not disrupted. Inserted novel genes and proteins are isolated and sequenced to assure that the intended material has been inserted without alteration. The novel proteins themselves are subjected to acute animal toxicology testing. Modified crops are characterized biochemically to assure appropriate nutrient properties and composition, feeding studies are performed in animal species, and levels of known toxins endogenous to the particular plant species quantified. To address food allergenicity concerns, inserted proteins are examined for structural similarity to known food allergens and to assure that they are readily digestible and heat labile; testing which is believed to reduce the likelihood of gastrointestinal allergy. 14 DNA itself is not likely to be directly harmful; thus far no transfer of plant DNA to human, animals, or bacterial species has been demonstrated. 15 Currently available genetically modified crops are produced, processed, and sold in a manner identical to, and usually admixed with, conventional crop varieties. Thus, the worker population exposed to these materials and the modes of exposure are no different from those of the traditional food/feed workforce. An exception would be workers involved in the development of new and not yet fully characterized crops, whose exposure potential may be more like that in the biopharmaceutical industry discussed below.\n\nThus, the introduction of biotechnology crops, given the pre-market safety assessment of these products, does not appear to introduce significant novel risk to the food and feed production workforce. Toxic or other adverse effects from the gene insert, protein products, and products of enzymatic activity are not, in general, anticipated from a material suitable for food consumption. Any novel protein, even one which is not a gastrointestinal sensitizer, may be a potential human respiratory or skin allergen. Foods in general, particularly in the grinding or milling environment, are recognized occupational allergens, as are fungal and other contaminants of commodity crops.\n\nOverall, the general nature of the hazards for workers employed in the food and feed production industries does not appear to be qualitatively altered by the introduction of marketed biotechnology crops, and it appears unlikely that quantitative risks are increased to any meaningful extent once one looks beyond the product development laboratory. The area of biopharmaceuticals presents a very different picture.\n\nHistorically, development and production of pharmaceutical agents and biomedical devices involved well-delineated, traditional work activities readily identifiable by today's occupational physician. Compounds of interest were synthesized in chemistry laboratories, purified, and tested for their chemical properties. Using animal facilities, the products of these laboratories were then tested for therapeutic and adverse effects first in smaller, then in larger animals. If the results were satisfactory, production would begin, typically on a small scale at first, to provide enough material for further trials and testing. Finally, successful drugs went into large-scale production in chemical production facilities, unique only in that they are equipped as necessary to meet the standards of pharmaceutical production. Health hazards for each of these sets of activities -the chemistry lab, the vivarium, and the factory -could be addressed using relatively traditional industrial hygiene techniques, complicated perhaps by the novelty of some of the compounds tested, the need to utilize hazardous microorganisms to test antimicrobial agents; and the potential for zoonotic infections in animal facilities.\n\nWith the development of recombinant DNA technology and the explosion in knowledge of the genome, the traditional pathway to drug development is changing. Although chemistry laboratories have not disappeared, the 'source' of an increasing fraction of new pharmaceuticals is not organic synthesis but biologic synthesis, i.e., a protein product of a selected gene or a metabolic product resulting from gene insertion. In this new paradigm, the initial steps in drug development involve identification of a relevant DNA sequence which codes for a desired protein (or occasionally DNA or RNA) product. This sequence may be an existing gene from a plant or animal species, a modified gene, or even a fully synthetic DNA sequence. This DNA sequence, along with appropriate regulatory sequences (promoters, etc) is then inserted into the genome of an organism which will become, in effect, the 'factory' producing the desired agent.\n\nUntil recently, biosynthesis most often occurred in bacterial, mold, or yeast cultures or in immortalized lines of human or animal cells. The hazards of such classical 'fermentation-like' systems, regardless of scale, are reasonably well understood. However, in the coming decade, the organisms engineered to yield the voluminous quantities of proteins needed for commercial purposes will primarily be agricultural crops such as corn or tobacco. To accomplish plant-mediated synthesis, a gene of interest is inserted into plant cells under laboratory conditions using bacterial or viral vectors or mechanical (micro-projectile) means. Cells bearing the desired gene are identified, and the desired cells are grown into adult plants, from which further clones or stock can be obtained. Plants are then grown and selected to cull out offspring lacking desired expression of the trait of interest, typically at a seed production facility. Once the seed stock is established, 'production' occurs on a farm; the therapeutic agent is then isolated and purified from the harvested product.\n\nBiotechnology is not limited to plants. Increasingly medical 'devices' may be grown in animals, such as the genetically modified swine expressing human rather than porcine cell surface markers, which may become the major source of organs for transplantation. As with drugs, breeding of these unique clones occurs in something resembling a laboratory, but once bred, the livestock are raised and harvested in a setting more like a farm. However, these highly specialized animals require more than just food and water; they require isolation from any organisms which could harm them and, especially, from any organisms which might persist in tissues, with or without harm to the pig, and subsequently harm an immunocompromised patient. Thus, the farm setting is modified to provide isolation from pathogenic organisms.\n\nUndoubtedly, there will be many variations on these themes as the full potential of new genetic technologies becomes clear. The sea-change, however, has already occurred: the practice of occupational health and safety for the population of genetic technology workers will require coping with a new and rapidly changing set of hazards, with work occurring in surprising new settings, and with worker populations (e.g., farm workers) dealing with many hazards -both novel and traditional. At present there is virtually no road map for the practice of occupational medicine in this domain.\n\nHazards in the biotechnology industry are best thought of in categories, since strategies for control are relatively unique to each class. The major groupings are: chemical, physical, and infectious and non-infectious biohazards. Since the first two groups are comprised of standard occupational health concerns, the focus of the discussion that follows will be on the infectious and non-infectious biologic risks. However, traditional health hazards (such as noise) can be easily overlooked when occurring in novel settings, and the need for continued vigilance for these traditional hazards cannot be overemphasized.\n\nBiomedical and pharmaceutical laboratories have a long tradition of utilizing infectious agents. The control of the associated hazards, using containment levels appropriate for the specific organism involved and for any genetic modifications present, has worked reasonably well over time. Existing documents 16, 17 provide clear criteria for application of the different biosafety levels, and clear prescriptions as to the appropriate precautions. To date, there is no evidence that laboratory recombination per se has incrementally altered the risks from any organisms handled in the lab, although concerns about the potential of new strains, especially those with markers for antibiotic resistance, may pose new concerns about waste and environmental disposition.\n\nAnimal use in the laboratory is not new, although it has received proportionally less attention in occupational health than in the veterinary medicine literature. Traditional zoonotic infections such as Q-fever, while not novel, continue to be an issue. The risks of agents as Herpes B from primates and prion diseases from the handling of human or animal CNS tissue represent some of the most daunting new threats, requiring that any lab handling potentially infectious material have appropriate consultation and control mechanisms in place.\n\nIn addition, new possibilities are raised by the emerging genetic technologies. Foremost is the use of vectors for transfection of animal cells. Although usually harvested from wild-types with limited pathogenicity to human hosts, viral agents selected for this work are themselves modified in the process, but are typically not well studied, since their role in the research is circumscribed and generally short-lived. Whether, for example, a non-human adenovirus carrying one or more modified genes could pose a risk to workers remains unexplored, and is unlikely to be explored until an 'incident' occurs. Although viral and bacterial vectors are also utilized for plant transfection, these agents do not appear to have any propensity to infect humans or animals.\n\nOf greater concern may be the viral vectors utilized for human gene therapy since, by design, these agents will infect the human host. These agents may be derived from a wide variety of viral strains including the retroviruses, adenoviruses, adenovirus-associated viruses, vaccinia, and the herpesviruses. 18 In general, these agents are replication deficient and thus cause only transient viremia. While most agents result in the transient, epichromosomal presence of the novel genes, some agents (primarily retroviruses) can permanently incorporate novel DNA into the human genome. 18 In general, large inocula are needed to have a significant effect, since the agents do not replicate. However, large accidental inoculations or inadvertent infection with replication-competent strains could cause serious occupational illness. Also the possibility remains that a replication-incompetent strain could acquire the ability to replicate via unintended genetic events or as a result of co-infection with another viral strain. 18 Likewise, laboratories will likely utilize genetically modified, rather than traditional laboratory animals. Until now this has been largely limited to transgenic rodents whose potential to spread infection to humans appears limited. However, with the advent of larger genetically modified species, such as pigs, new possibilities arise, such as human transmission of new agents or more efficient transmission of old ones. Many if not most of the major viral infections of humans are suspected to have had animal origins, and many viruses are quite remarkable in the range of hosts they may infect. The 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), traced to food workers handling wild civet carcasses, is a compelling example. The emergence of prion variants in new host animals, as occurred in the 1980s with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease), indicates that particular caution is necessary regarding the handling of any CNS tissues or contaminated material.\n\nUnfortunately, the range of possibilities is virtually infinite; possibilities specific to a given lab or technology will necessarily require detailed attention to the particular exposures, with broad appreciation for the 'possible'. The emergence of new human pathogens in animal species has been occurring as a natural phenomenon with great regularity, especially in the case of influenza viruses. It is not presently clear how the risks of this phenomenon in biotechnology systems compare with the risks inherent in the natural environment.\n\nA larger concern is the non-infectious occupational risk associated with genetically modified organisms and their products. Generally, these can be grouped into three classes. First are the potential toxicities of the protein products themselves. As discussed above, genetically modified plant products developed for human and animal consumption are of relatively limited concern in this regard, beyond the risk of newly introduced allergens and some alterations in plant composition.\n\nWe can be less confident about the risks of pharmaceutical protein products. Technology now allows constructs of various cytokines, cytokine inhibitors, agonists, and antagonists of numerous 'receptors' or other proteins in the body, including highly specific agents such as monoclonal antibodies. Although these proteins generally constitute a small portion of total protein production, many of these agents manifest remarkably high levels of biologic activity following parenteral administration, with effective doses in the microgram range. These proteins are unlikely to be well absorbed via the upper or lower respiratory tract, intact skin or gastrointestinal routes. However, some proteins and/or possibly peptide fragments may be absorbed, especially under dusty conditions. While some dust exposure may occur in the harvest or handling of whole crops, greater potential for dust exposure exists when crops such as corn or tobacco leaf are ground or milled to allow extraction of the desired material. Given the high biologic activity of these materials, systemic effects may be possible despite very low bioavailability.\n\nIt is possible that genetically modified agents may directly affect mucous membranes of the upper and lower respiratory tract and even the gastrointestinal tract. For example, a monoclonal antibody directed against inflammatory mediators, or cell surface markers, might precipitate lung injury by modulating pulmonary immune function of the airway epithelium. Although this risk is, at present, entirely theoretical, vigilance is required as we proceed into the future.\n\nThe majority of therapeutic proteins have undergone development in non-plant systems prior to initiating plant-mediated production, and many of these agents have undergone preclinical and early clinical testing either in animals and/or appropriate patient groups (often patients with rare or fatal conditions). However, the general safety of these materials for working adults typically has not been established. In particular, since protein agents must generally be administered parenterally for therapeutic purposes, these agents have rarely been studied via traditional routes of occupational exposure. Assessment of occupational risks is further complicated by the often high degree of biologic specificity of the proteins, which may have activity in only a limited number of species or be active only in humans. Thus, depending upon the degree of species specificity, traditional animal testing may fail to reveal hazards relevant to the workplace. The development of numerous such protein agents annually increases the likelihood of difficulties arising in exposed workers, but the ultimate magnitude of these difficulties remains undefined.\n\nAnother concern, and the one which has received the most attention in relationship to genetically modified foods, is the potential for exposed workers to develop allergic responses to new protein antigens. While proteins inserted into crops intended for food or feed use are selected to minimize the risk of gastrointestinal sensitization, the potential for pharmaceutical proteins to incite allergic pulmonary responses may be more substantial. Although there are algorithms and approaches for predicting gastrointestinal (i.e. food) allergenicity, 14 the predictive value of these algorithms for respiratory allergenicity is unknown, especially for workers who may be repeatedly exposed. Given that new proteins can potentially be allergenic, allergic responses such as dermatitis, urticaria, asthma, rhinitis, and anaphylaxis are potential adverse effects. It will generally not be feasible to screen workforces for sensitivity to these new products, since the antigens will likely be novel to humans and markers for sensitivity not developed until allergic responses occur and are fully evaluated.\n\nThe introduction of new or enhanced enzymatic activities and synthetic pathways may also introduce novel metabolic products, either intentionally or otherwise. Similarly, one may see so-called pleotropic effects in which the insertion of a foreign gene alters cell metabolism in unexpected ways as a result of changes in protein or cell function. 13 For example, a plant which previously expressed low levels of a toxin may express larger quantities of the toxin, or a previously unexpressed pathway may become active. Again, while food and feed products undergo substantial testing which may uncover such phenomena, such comprehensive testing is not necessarily undertaken for plants intended for biopharmaceutical production.\n\nAt this time, there is no simple way to look singly or collectively at these metabolic effects; singly, because it is unknown in advance what single product to study, and collectively because laboratory animals are limited in their food consumption. Even if a crop is tested, the animals may not consume enough of the whole plant product to assess the toxicity of a low-concentration material. Although there are presently no recognized cases of occupational illness resulting from pleotropic effects induced by modern genetic technologies, pleotropic effects of traditional breeding have, on at least one occasion, precipitated an outbreak of occupational illness in the form of photodermatitis resulting from unanticipated increases in psoralin levels in celery. 12 Hopefully, rapidly evolving technology in the area of gene expression profiling and metabolite analysis 13 will allow a more comprehensive approach to this area of hazard assessment in the near future.\n\nFor the reasons proposed above, current knowledge about occupational health for non-traditional hazards, particularly in the biopharmaceuticals area, remains extremely limited. There are a handful of reassuring reports that the recombinant DNA technologies in microbes of the last generation has not conferred important new infectious risks, as noted, but relevance to the new enterprises is unclear. Moreover, it appears inevitable that the production of new gene products will rise dramatically given the recent sequencing of the human genome and other advances in biotechnology. This assures that many workers will be working with unknown materials for the foreseeable future, many in novel workplace circumstances.\n\nFor workers in the traditional food and feed industries, including farming, the introduction of evaluated biotechnology crops will probably produce at most modest change in qualitative and quantitative health risk. This is in contrast to the evolving situation in the area of biotechnology research and biopharmaceuticals. Regarding these latter two areas, the potential for adverse outcomes, albeit remote in any single situation, is likely high in the aggregate, and the safety of the technology -given already high levels of public scrutiny -as well as the workers hangs in the balance.\n\nThe fact that there are neither well-defined surveillance approaches nor specific regulations should encourage higher, not lower, levels of professional input. Moreover, unlike some traditional aspects of occupational health in which intimate knowledge of modern medicine and biology is generally not critical, consultants in this industry will need to have substantial scientific expertise as they evaluate product by product, and class by class, the potential for human exposure and risk created by new developments. In these novel environments, care providers must be careful not to overlook obvious traditional risks like animal allergy, zoonoses, noise, and ergonomic issues. Beyond this, a number of suggestions from the authors may prove useful to the care provider in approaching the biotechnology work environment. The ultimate need for, and efficacy of, these approaches remain to be determined. 1. For farm workers and other food/feed industry workers handling approved genetically modified plants, no unique surveillance beyond usual measures appears to be mandated as this time. One plausible risk is allergy to inserted proteins, a risk already common to foodstuffs and contaminants such as molds. If immunologic studies of exposed workers are performed, consideration should be given both to novel and to the far greater number of non-novel antigenic proteins present. 2. In evaluating and managing the infectious/ transmissible risks of recombinant vectors and modified organisms in the laboratory settingincluding microbes, plants, and animals -current guidelines from the National Institutes of Health 16 and the American Society for Microbiology 17 appear adequate. However, it is important to recognize that these criteria are based upon planned (or readily anticipated) and controlled events. Unanticipated genetic events may occur, particularly in animal species, with resulting novel pathogens, although the likelihood and extent of such events is unclear. Practitioners must therefore remain alert to the possibility of unique infectious presentations within the biotechnology workforce. 3. In evaluating the risks of biopharmaceutical products, the occupational physician should consider several characteristics which may not be evident on casual consideration of available toxicology data. These factors include the following.\n\n\u2022 Is the molecule biologically active as produced in the organism, or is further processing necessary to result in an active moiety? \u2022 Does the molecule produce biologic effects independently or is some other exogenous factor required for toxicity (i.e., an antibody designed to carry a radioisotope to tumor cells would not likely present a hazard until radio-labeled)? \u2022 Does the target of the molecule occur in the general population, or is it only manifest in specific diseases? \u2022 Does the receptor for the protein exist on externally exposed surfaces such as the mucous membranes of the gastrointestinal or respiratory tract, or exist in the mucous coating of these surfaces? \u2022 What is known, if anything, about absorption of the particular molecule or about the activity and absorption of fragments derived from it? \u2022 Is the molecule known to have acute toxicologic effects (i.e., cholera toxin) or is it structurally or functionally analogous to a known toxin based upon bioinformatic (e.g., protein sequence homology) analysis? \u2022 What degree of species specificity does the molecule exhibit, and how will this affect the ability of animal testing systems to reveal useful information in regard to human hazards? \u2022 Given such specificity, can a sufficiently predictive animal model be developed (such as an animal transgenic for the human receptor, or a homologous molecule having a different species specificity to allow testing)? \u2022 Does a human disease model exist which may shed light on the possible effects of the product? For exam-ple, acquired immunodeficiency could model potential effects of a protein which eliminates T-cell function or interferes with interleukin-2 activity. \u2022 Is the protein a known human allergen and/or does it exhibit homology to known allergens? \u2022 Is the protein of human origin or has it been 'humanized' in sequence to reduce antigenicity? 4. In the absence of adequate predictive data, care should be exercised in the handling of biopharmaceutical proteins outside of the well-controlled laboratory environment. This is particularly true for dry operations such as grinding or milling. While it is highly likely that, in most situations, no unusual effect will arise, exposure should be carefully controlled using industrial hygiene and personal protective equipment as necessary. The occupational physician should be vigilant for anticipated and even unanticipated clinical effects, especially those which might be mediated by direct action of the product upon the lining of the respiratory and/or gastrointestinal tracts. 5. In assessing allergic responses in the workplace, one should consider both the novel and existing antigen potential of the biotechnology product. Several additional administrative and technical practices may be helpful in addressing the occupational health needs of the biotechnology community.\n\nFirst, we would propose that every development facility, including seed farms and other agricultural facilities where biotechnology products (other than approved food/feed products) are handled, have available internal and/or external medical resources whose responsibilities are separate from product development and production. Such groups would have regular meetings with investigators developing new products, and would have both the resources and authority to provide caution where unforeseen risks are contemplated. These resources should include consultants knowledgeable in the necessary areas of molecular biology, virology, infectious disease, etc, depending upon the nature of the hazards involved.\n\nSecondly, we would recommend that each development facility constitute a biosafety committee to review the worker-related safety aspects of biotechnology projects before inception. While this function is mandated for facilities receiving Federal dollars in the USA, privately funded research groups would be advised to follow this model and to provide the committee sufficient resources and authority to assure effectiveness. Inclusion of occupational medicine on the IBC seems well advised. We believe that community member participation is an important aspect of biosafety committee function, and encourages community involvement with the need for business confidentiality and the freedom to disclose public hazards appropriately balanced.\n\nFinally, institutional review boards (IRBs) can contribute to the oversight of biotechnology projects when those projects involve human subject research. Recent liability concerns, may, unfortunately, limit the access of private industry to independent IRBs in university settings.\n\nHopefully, a more systematic approach to occupational medicine in biotechnology will result, including productive and cost-effective approaches to surveillance, control and, if necessary, regulation.\n\nThe events of September 2001 dramatically highlighted the occupational hazards facing police and firefighters. Of the rescue workers fatally injured in the World Trade Center attacks in New York, 335 were firefighters and 61 were police officers or detectives. 1 The evolving homeland security roles of the public safety sector encompass domestic consequence management of a broad spectrum of threats of terrorist or trans-national attack. Clinicians evaluating police officers and firefighters either for preventive services, including fitness for duty determinations, or for acute or chronic medical complaints potentially related to work must take into account the unique aspects and expanding scope of firefighting and police duties. Even in the absence of major disasters, both professions experience high rates of work-related illness, injury and mortality. While many hazards of law enforcement and fire service work are by necessity sporadic and unpredictable, a more thorough understanding of the risks facing these public safety workers could lead to improvement in current preventive efforts.\n\nThis chapter will outline hazardous exposures faced by police and firefighters and summarize studies of health outcomes related to exposures and recommendations for preventive interventions. Many of the specific hazards are discussed in greater detail in other chapters of this book.\n\nThere are approximately 1.1 million firefighters in the US, organized into more than 26,000 local fire departments. 2 Interior structural firefighting is a complex operation that can be divided into several stages. These include (1) alarm, during which personal protective equipment including self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) is donned prior to and during transportation to the incident scene; (2) entry, when the burning structure is breached and rescue operations begin; (3) suppression, involving venting and extinguishment of the fire; (4) overhaul, when the firefighters remove furnishings, open walls, and pull ceilings to ensure that the fire is completely extinguished, and (5) termination, during which equipment is recovered, and hundreds of feet of 1.5 to 6 inch diameter hoselines are drained and re-packed onto the engines. While fighting structure fires remains a core function of fire departments, the number of responses to medical emergencies and hazardous materials incidents has more than doubled in the past 20 years. 3 Other dangerous aspects of the firefighter's job include responding to emergencies using warning lights and sirens through traffic, operating in poorly controlled environments such as motor vehicle accident or crime scenes, and operating in a wide array of technical rescue situations, including working in confined spaces, high elevations, extremes of temperature, and urban environments.\n\nApproximately three-fourths of firefighters are volunteers and the remainder are career personnel. The occupational hazards facing each group may differ in frequency and depend on the operational scope of the local department. Career fire departments generally respond to a greater number of calls, and typically protect larger populations and occupancies than volunteer departments.\n\nAs Figure 18 .2.1 shows, there has been a 38.9% decrease in the number of US structure fires over the last 20 years. 4 This has been associated with a moderate decrease in total line-of-duty firefighter fatalities, though the occupational injury and mortality rates per fire appear to be stable or rising, with rates of 25 injuries per 1000 fires and 6.5 fatalities per 100,000 fires. [5] [6] [7] Firefighting accounts for only 9% of fire service emergency call volume nationally, yet roughly 50% of line-ofduty deaths and 60-80% of injuries occur on the fire-ground 7 as shown in Figure 18 .2.2. While the high rate of fatalities on the fireground might suggest that such deaths could be due to physical trauma or direct exposure to heat and smoke, in fact roughly half of firefighter deaths on the fireground are caused by heart attacks 6 or motor vehicle crashes (see below). \n\nFighting structure fires involves many physically demanding and potentially hazardous tasks, including climbing ladders, crawling through confined spaces, lifting heavy tools and building materials, and maneuvering on elevated surfaces where there is a risk of falls. These activities must be performed while wearing heavy fire retardant clothing, a helmet, self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) respirator, and other protective gear that may weigh in excess of 50 pounds. There is consequently a need for physical fitness and a constant potential for traumatic injury or death. A study of National Fire Incident Reporting System data found that risk factors for acute injury while fighting fires included a greater than 5 alarm fire, structures greater than three stories, and at least one civilian being injured. 8 While there is a risk from physical assault violence by patients and others during provision of emergency medicine services (EMS), this risk has been found to be low. 9 Heat is a critical exposure hazard when fighting fires. Interior structural firefighting can transiently involve exposures to temperatures exceeding 700\u00b0F, and the protective clothing worn by firefighters is designed to afford thermal protection from such environments in a time/dose-related manner 10 (see Chapter 34) . Unfortunately, the heavy thermal and flame protective equipment adds significant weight and ergonomic disadvantage. It severely impairs the\n\nSandy Bogucki, Peter M Rabinowitz body's normal mechanisms for heat dissipation, and the inability to release heat generated by muscular activity during firefighting (despite profuse sweating) puts firefighters at increased risk for clinically significant heat stress. Even without thermal stress from a fire, the clothing has been shown to significantly increase core body temperature during physical activity. 11 Typical noise exposures are of relatively short duration and high intensity, which may be different from the steady-state noise in many industrial environments. Amplified electronic or mechanical sirens are designed to be louder than background traffic noise, and are capable of sound pressure levels of 120 dB or more. The exposures to personnel riding in an ambulance or fire apparatus can exceed 100 dB. Since such exposures are short duration, the OSHA permissible exposure levels of 85 dBA may not be exceeded over an 8-hour time weighted average. [12] [13] [14] The high rate of hearing loss in firefighters, however, suggests that such short exposures may be intense enough to cause lasting damage. Pump operators, who stand next to the diesel engines that are maintained in high idle throughout incidents to power the apparatus' water delivery capability, may experience the highest overall noise exposure during a shift. A number of engineering controls have been used to reduce siren noise exposures, so that the noise exposure may vary by the type and locations of sirens used by a particular department. In addition, active noise cancellation hearing protective devices employing radio communication can reduce noise exposures due to predictable sources such as sirens, but to date are not widely in use.\n\nSmoke from burning materials exposes firefighters to a wide range of potentially toxic gases, fumes, vapors and particulates. The most common and significant is carbon monoxide. 15 The use of synthetic polymers and materials in building construction and interior furnishings since the 1930s has added to the complexity of the gases released during structural fires 16 (see Chapter 19.5) . The exact mixture of chemicals depends on the material that is burning as well as the temperature of the fire. Materials that contain nitrogen, sulfur, and halogens can release hydrogen cyanide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, ammonia, and halogen acids. Silk, polyvinyl chloride, plastics, wool, and insulation can release hydrogen chloride, hydrogen fluoride, isocyanates, and acrolein. 17 Other potential components of smoke include aldehydes, benzene, benzpyrenes and other polyaromatic hydrocarbons, phosgene, and\n\nHazard Potential health outcome particulates. 3 Until recently, training fires were often conducted using reclaimed oils from gas stations or industries and such oil fires may have contained PCBs, metals, and other contaminants. Additionally, stored chemicals like pesticides, manufacturing compounds or intermediates, and hydrocarbon fuels all produce toxic products of combustion in fires involving commercial, public and residential occupancies.\n\nSince the 1970s, inhalation exposure has presumably decreased significantly due to the widespread use of SCBA for respiratory protection during firefighting and Hazardous Material (HAZMAT), emergency operations. 18 Recent studies suggest, however, that despite the use of protective equipment, there is ongoing evidence of exposure to polyaromatic hydrocarbons and other products of combustion during firefighting. 19, 20 One reason may be the common practice of removing SCBA during overhaul operations, when the dense smoke and heat have cleared, 21, 22 despite knowledge that the density of visible or carbonaceous smoke is not correlated with toxic gas concentrations in combustion environments. 17 Furthermore, recent testing of commercially available SCBAs for exclusion of weaponized chemicals by NIOSH has demonstrated that certain organic agents rapidly permeate some face pieces. HAZMAT responders use special protective equipment to provide an impermeable vapor-liquid barrier that completely encapsulates the wearer, including the SCBA. The implications for firefighters using SCBA alone for respiratory protection in fire environments with high concentrations of organic or non-polar gases require further investigation.\n\nMost fire departments respond to HAZMAT incidents in their local jurisdictions, yet this function, when performed with proper protective equipment as described above, probably adds little to lifetime occupational chemical exposures in firefighters. 23, 24 A recent study found that even though elevated levels of PCBs and polychlorinated dibenzofurans were found on the protective suits of firefighters, there was no evidence of significant exposure. 25 Diesel fumes are a potentially significant hazard. Inadequate attention was paid to ventilation of fire stations when diesel engines replaced horses early in the last century. Traditionally, living and sleeping accommodations for on-duty firefighters have been located above apparatus floors with open stairwells and pole passages providing direct conduits for exhaust fumes and gases generated by the trucks. High ambient diesel emissions levels in fire station living quarters have been documented 26 leading to efforts to design fire stations with better separation of living quarters from apparatus bays. Many departments have also installed emissions management systems in their apparatus garages to actively vent each vehicle's exhaust. Despite availability of such solutions, many personnel are still headquartered in old construction fire stations where diesel fumes and other environmental threats persist.\n\nFirefighters routinely face both personal danger as well as exposure to potentially upsetting traumatic events in others. It has been proposed that these activities would predispose firefighters to post-traumatic stress disorders and other psychologic problems. 27 The need for functioning at high levels of physical exertion, even in the absence of physic danger, has been associated with psychologic strain. 28\n\nIn their role as emergency medical responders, firefighters are at risk of exposure to blood-borne pathogens, tuberculosis, and other infectious disease agents. 29, 30 Other potential biologic hazards include mold and bacterial growth from building materials.\n\nAn important cause of line-of-duty fire service fatalities is motor vehicle accidents. As with many other hazards, the risk of motor vehicle accidents differs between career and volunteer departments. Career fire departments respond to a greater number of calls, and have significant losses due to apparatus accidents. Volunteer firefighters often respond to incident scenes in privately owned vehicles, and may be at increased risk for accidents due to excessive speed and crossing of intersections without sirens or warning lights. An additional cause of apparatus accidents in the volunteer fire service involves tanker trucks. Water for firefighting must be shuttled to incident scenes in rural areas without fire hydrants by water tankers. The high center of gravity and tendency of water loads to shift have contributed to incidents of tanker vehicle rollovers and volunteer fatalities. 31\n\nA number of studies have examined patterns of morbidity and mortality in firefighters. The results of such studies must be viewed in light of at least two important epidemiologic aspects of firefighter health. First, career firefighters generally have to demonstrate above average physical stamina and strength at the time of entry into the profession. Individuals who remain actively employed as firefighters are also likely to be healthy enough to continue performing the physically demanding job duties. There is consequently a significant 'healthy worker effect' in cohorts of firefighters, and rates of illness would be expected to be lower than the general population due to this selection bias. Secondly, exposures to chemicals and particulates during firefighting operations should have decreased in recent decades due to the increased use of respiratory protection. Changes in patterns of diseases resulting from such exposures may only emerge slowly, over decades, due to the protracted latency of many of these conditions.\n\nAcute musculoskeletal disorders are the most common type of line-of-duty injuries for firefighters, followed by lacerations and bruises. Together, these categories accounted for 77% of all reported US firefighter injuries in 2000. 7 Muscular sprains, strains and chronic, recurring pain are also the leading causes of lost time and disability in the career fire service. 7, 32 Back injuries are the most prevalent permanently disabling problem in most departments, accounting for over half of line-of-duty disability retirements of career firefighters. 33 The incidence may be higher in departments that provide emergency medical services.\n\nAs mentioned above, myocardial infarction and cardiac sudden death account for about half of line-of-duty deaths in firefighters. Workers' compensation statutes in many localities include a presumption that if heart disease or hypertension develops in a firefighter, a work-related association due to occupational stress is present. Cohort mortality studies have failed to consistently demonstrate that the rate of death from cardiovascular disease is greater than the general population, 34, 35 although an apparent absence of the healthy worker effect has been noted in firefighter cardiovascular mortality rates.\n\nClearly, firefighting involves periods of extreme physical exertion, with high aerobic demands and static loads. The physiologic workload of fireground tasks may exceed 15-18 METs, 36 and typically involves asymmetric upper body work. Carbon monoxide exposures lead to tissue hypoxia and worsened cardiovascular demand. These factors alone or in combination could potentially unmask occult coronary artery disease not detected by standard cardiac stress testing. The sporadic nature of these occupational demands, however, is not sufficient to maintain either strength or aerobic fitness, and until recently little attention has been paid to the need for vigorous, ongoing, job-specific fitness programs. A study of body mass index in firefighters found that 87% were overweight, and the obesity was correlated with increased cholesterol and blood pressure. 37 While the ranks of career firefighters thin rapidly over age 50, largely due to job-related disability retirements, 32, 33 volunteer firefighters may remain active into their eighth decade, serving as fire police or otherwise assisting at emergency scenes. The data show that many of the fatal, lineof-duty heart attacks occur in these older, predominantly male volunteers. Most firefighters who die of heart attacks in the line of duty have a previous medical history of coronary artery disease. 5\n\nA number of cohort studies have examined malignancyrelated mortality in firefighters. 34, 35, [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] Increased standardized mortality ratios for malignant melanoma, multiple myeloma, leukemia, and cancers of the bladder, kidney, brain, and colon have been reported, although results have not been consistent among studies with respect to these cancers. Furthermore, many of these studies did not show an increasing risk with duration of employment. 3 The inconsistency of these studies must be viewed in light of the variability of individual and local exposure histories and the healthy worker effect discussed earlier. About one-third of the states in the US have presumptive occupational cancer statutes in place for firefighters.\n\nDespite the use of respiratory protection, firefighters continue to be at risk for respiratory effects of exposure to irritant chemicals and particulates. Severe smoke inhalation can lead to burns of the respiratory tract, pulmonary edema, and ARDS (see Chapter 19.5) . Less severe exposures can cause significant irritant effects, including reactive airway dysfunction syndrome (RADS) and asthma. After the World Trade Center attacks, an increase of cough ('World Trade Center cough') and bronchial hyper-responsiveness was noted in firefighters exposed to high concentrations of particulates. 47 In addition to airway irritation and asthma, other acute respiratory effects may result from exposure to particulates and smoke. A recent case report described acute eosinophilic pneumonia in a firefighter involved in the World Trade Center disaster. 48 An increased rate of sarcoidosis has been reported among firefighters compared to emergency medical service controls, 49 but this association remains unclear.\n\nWhile respiratory hazards are also encountered in responding to hazardous materials incidents, a study of hazardous material firefighters found no excess of respiratory disease compared to other firefighters. 50\n\nThe two main clinical results of heat and/or exposure in the fire service are burns and heat stress. For the past 10 years, burns have accounted for approximately 6% of firefighter line-of-duty injuries and fatalities. 6, 32, 33 First degree and small, second degree burns are probably vastly under-reported in the fire service, and are common during structural and wild land firefighting.\n\nIn recent years there have been several firefighter deaths due to heat stroke during training and emergency operations. The incidence of heat-related illness or symptomatic heat stress, like small burns, is undoubtedly underestimated by fire service statistics. Prevention of heat stress is discussed further below.\n\nHigh rates of post-traumatic symptoms have been noted in firefighter populations. 51, 52 Following the 2001 World Trade Center attack, the rate of psychologic stressrelated incidents among firefighter rescue workers increased 17-fold. 1 A study of firefighters with posttraumatic stress disorder complaints revealed an association of such symptoms with alcohol-related problems. 53 The efficacy of post-incident interventions aimed at reducing their psychologic impact on emergency services personnel is unproven.\n\nDespite the fact that firefighter noise exposures do not exceed OSHA limits when adjusted for intermittency, several studies have found that rates of hearing loss for firefighters are in excess of what would be expected from aging alone. Due to often asymmetric exposures such as sirens on vehicles, such hearing loss may exhibit a predominantly unilateral pattern more often than in other working populations. 54, 55 \n\nDespite their risk of exposure to blood-borne pathogens, studies of public safety workers have not detected an elevated risk of hepatitis C above the background population. [56] [57] [58] Similarly, occupational transmission of HIV or tuberculosis to firefighters appears to occur infrequently.\n\nMost fire departments require physician involvement in two very dissimilar roles. These are emergency medical services (EMS) medical direction and provision of occupational medical services. Some departments also include physician officer(s), referred to as fire surgeon(s) or chief medical officer(s). These individuals may serve in EMS, occupational medical, or other advisory capacity, but are distinguished by their status as sworn members of the department and their assigned responsibilities in emergency operations. In some small, rural departments, it may be necessary for a single community physician to provide both EMS medical direction and occupational medical services, although the qualifications are different, and there may be intrinsic conflicts between the roles. 59 Some fire service consensus standards require the occupational medical provider to serve on the department's safety committee. 60 This requires a level of operational involvement that has not been typical of contract medical providers, but is consistent with plantbased industrial occupational medical models.\n\nA key aspect of providing occupational medicine services to firefighters is an awareness of existing guidelines for medical evaluations of fire service candidates and members. The International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF)/International Association of Fire Chiefs (IAFC) Joint Labor-Management Fitness and Wellness Initiative 61 prescribes a comprehensive, annual program of medical and fitness evaluations for fire service personnel. Piloted by the fire departments in ten large, metropolitan areas in the US and Canada, this program's objectives include not only decreasing the morbidity and mortality of a career in firefighting, but also collection and analysis of the aggregate data to better define and track them. The second set of medical evaluation specifications for firefighters is published by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) in NFPA 1582, Standard on Medical Requirements for Fire Fighters and Information for Fire Department Physicians. 62 These standards are regularly updated, and serve as the basis for many individual health and safety programs for firefighters.\n\nNFPA 1582 includes a model list of essential job tasks of interior structural firefighters that can be used by medical professionals to understand the demands of the job provided it has been validated by the administration of the contracting fire department. Efforts to merge the similar but distinct sets of requirements published by the IAFF/IAFC and the NFPA into a single, coherent standard are in progress.\n\nIn order to be eligible for hire, a prospective firefighter must generally pass a series of rigorous physical performance tests, requiring significant muscular strength and overall physical fitness. A preplacement evaluation by a clinician occurs after a candidate is accepted or hired by the department, but before beginning training or participating in emergency responses. The two main purposes for this initial evaluation are detection of any medical conditions that could interfere with the individual's ability to safely perform all of the essential job functions, and establishment of baseline values for a number of clinical parameters that should be followed throughout a firefighter's career.\n\nClinicians performing such preplacement examinations should attempt to get a detailed description of the duties required of firefighters or other members of fire departments, and customize the medical evaluation process to match the job. The most rigorous medical certification processes generally involve those whose essential job tasks include interior structural firefighting in urban environments, driving fire apparatus, and certain technical rescue specialists such as divers, flyers and others. In evaluating fitness for duty in such positions, the clinician must take into account the impact of any medical limitations on both the firefighter, as well as coworkers and the public.\n\nFirefighters in departments that employ only defensive (exterior) fire suppression tactics, members of fire police squads, and command staff in many departments may not need to meet the same medical requirements as interior structural firefighters. Likewise, firefighters in small suburban jurisdictions may not need to be able to climb six or more flights of stairs carrying high-rise hose packs if there are no occupied structures more than three stories high.\n\nA comprehensive discussion of the medical conditions that could compromise a firefighter's fitness for duty is beyond the scope of this chapter. Most of the potentially disqualifying conditions are readily recognized by medical providers, as they interfere with an individual's normal functioning, and it is clear that they could not routinely meet the physiologic demands of firefighting. The most common, problematic medical conditions confronted by fire department physicians include monocular vision, hearing deficits, diabetes mellitus, seizure disorders, and, of course, coronary artery disease. NFPA 1582 sets disqualification criteria for each of these conditions. The following brief discussion serves only to introduce some of the key issues related to these conditions. New monocular vision results in impaired depth perception and narrows visual fields. These are significant concerns on the fireground, as awareness of surrounding hazards, and ability to negotiate ladders, crawl along floor joists and work on roofs are all essential job tasks. With training following loss of vision in one eye, firefighters can compensate for their impaired depth perception, but the loss of peripheral vision should disqualify them from driving fire department apparatus during emergency responses.\n\nUnaided hearing in noisy conditions is a medical prerequisite for safe functioning on the fireground. There are a number of sounds at various volumes and frequencies that a firefighter must perceive on the fireground. It is essential that personnel be able to hear and communicate effectively over portable radios. They must also hear and localize calls or cries in fire rescue situations. Firefighters engaged in an interior fire attack are typically notified of the need for immediate evacuation due to untenable conditions or impending structure collapse by the sounding of apparatus air horns. All of these critical sounds must be detected and understood by firefighters in an environment of high background noise. Furthermore, this must be accomplished without the use of hearing aids, as there are currently none available that are certified to work when soaked in water, and this is a common condition during fireground operations.\n\nBoth epilepsy and insulin-requiring diabetes mellitus with a history of incapacitating hypoglycemia are associated with unpredictable episodes of impaired sensorium and functioning. Many individuals with these conditions, however, are fully capable of doing the physical work required of firefighters, although considerable clinical judgment is required to clear them for full duties. The emergency response and fireground environments may increase the risk and certainly compound the consequences of sudden incapacitation due to seizure or hypoglycemia. Shift work and night responses result in personnel fatigue while busy shifts or protracted incidents requiring personal protective equipment can result in transient dehydration and irregular food intake. Photic stimulation from flashing strobe lights together with the noise and emotional content of the fireground could serve as triggers for seizure activity. The early symptoms of hypoglycemia are indistinguishable from those experienced by many firefighters maximally exerting themselves under situational-induced catecholamine excess, and may be more likely ignored.\n\nCoronary insufficiency or other cardiac condition that can compromise a firefighter's capacity to perform work requires comprehensive evaluation and definitive intervention. Once a diagnosis of cardiac disease has been established and treated, a candidate or firefighter can only be considered medically qualified for duty if there is no evidence of significant ongoing ischemic disease. The individual must be able to exercise to a high workload on cardiac stress testing without symptoms or electrocardiograph changes, and the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) must be normal. This last requirement is a main reason for aggressive evaluation of personnel with cardiac risk factors and/or suggestive symptoms. Interventions such as revascularization, medication and modification of cardiac risk factors performed prior to actual myocardial infarction result in preservation of LVEF and may represent the difference between permanent medical disqualification and job retention for firefighters with cardiac disease.\n\nPeriodic, frequently annual, evaluations of firefighters are performed to detect early changes that could individually or in aggregate indicate interim exposures during emergency operations or failures in workplace occupational safety measures. These evaluations also screen for development of medical conditions that could compromise a firefighter's fitness for duty. OSHA requires a regular respiratory history and examination program for personnel using respirators, including SCBA, and this is conducted as part of the periodic medical evaluation in most departments. NFPA and IAFF/IAFC have developed guidelines for fire service-specific periodic examinations.\n\nMany fire departments also require firefighters to undergo medical evaluation prior to returning to duty following acute exposure to hazardous chemicals or certain infectious agents, after protracted absence for significant illness or injury, and prior to retirement, especially where serviceconnected disability may be involved. Medical and work capacity evaluation must consider the specific requirements of the individual's job. For example, following a cardiac or other systemic illness it may be advisable to refer a firefighter for exercise stress testing to ensure physiologic capacity to perform at high workloads. Prescriptive, jobspecific work hardening with a physical therapist may be appropriate in some cases. It may also be necessary to recommend restricted duty for some firefighters during rehabilitation from injury or illness.\n\nOccupational medical programs for fire departments should be more than just periodic, medical fitness-for-duty evaluations. Such programs should also help co-ordinate fitness and wellness initiatives for personnel, and should co-ordinate with fire department administrators to integrate traditional injury prevention strategies into departmental safety protocols. A physician should serve on the department's safety committee, which is mandated by NFPA 1500, Standard on Fire Department Occupational Safety. 60 In this capacity, the physician would participate in investigations of incidents that resulted in line-of-duty illness or injury to personnel, and should provide guidance for local programs requiring the use of hearing protection and vehicle restraints while riding in fire apparatus and hoods, gloves and SCBA during fire suppression.\n\nDespite the rigorous physical fitness standards for initial hire into the fire service, many departments do not require that firefighters continue to maintain optimal physical conditioning. Inclusion of physical fitness initiatives in fire service occupational medical programs has been effective in reducing this toll in some studies. 63 Aerobic fitness is the best predictor of tolerance to heat, 64 adding even more incentive to fire departments to include physical fitness in their occupational medical programs. It is also vital that organized rehab sectors and procedures be established at fire incident scenes in order to rest and rehydrate crews, while sheltering them from environmental extremes, on a rotating basis. This will decrease the morbidity associated with uncompensable heat stress, especially in unacclimated personnel. Fire department occupational medical physicians may be contractually responsible for co-ordinating with EMS physician medical directors to develop rehab sector medical protocols. 62 Fire department medical programs should include early access to specialty burn centers for definitive care of firefighters who sustain significant burn injuries, hyperbaric chambers for treatment of severe carbon monoxide intoxication, and other contingencies as dictated by local hazards.\n\nFire service occupational medical providers should maintain and compare records longitudinally in order to remain vigilant for clusters of medical conditions that may be related to a point source exposure, like a large pesticide fire, or ongoing exposure to environmental threats like asbestos, infectious organisms or noise. As in any industrial setting, such occurrences should be investigated, documented, reported as required or appropriate, and proactively mitigated where possible.\n\nAs of 2000, there were 710,000 full-time sworn personnel in US state and local law enforcement agencies. 65 Police officers experience high rates of injuries and workrelated fatalities. As an occupational group, however, they have not been as extensively studied as firefighters. Compared to firefighters, there is a lack of published guidelines regarding optimal occupational medicine services for police officers.\n\nPolice officers, during the course of their career, encounter a variety of physical, chemical, and psychologic hazards. Many of these are similar to those faced by firefighters, and are listed in Table 18 .2.2. Current understanding of the importance of these hazards and their impact on morbidity and mortality in this occupational group is limited due to a lack of carefully designed studies.\n\nPolice officers may experience direct physical violence such as gunshot or blunt trauma, resulting in injuries and death. In addition, pursuit of suspects may involve climbing, running and jumping, which further exposes them to risk of falls and acute musculoskeletal injuries.\n\nRadar used for traffic surveillance is capable of emitting small amounts of microwave radiation. Actual measurements of microwave levels at the level of the testicles have indicated that exposure levels are minimal, 66 but efforts should be made to avoid excessive exposures.\n\nSeveral studies have studied the effect of prolonged exposure to traffic fumes and other air pollutants for police officers engaged in traffic work. Elevated exposures to lead, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, and benzene have been reported. [67] [68] [69] \n\nPsychologic stressors include the need for heightened awareness of potentially life-threatening dangers for prolonged periods of time, as well as the reaction to incidents of violence and other psychologically disturbing events. Such 'critical incidents' are considered to be a major risk factor for impaired psychologic functioning, including sleep disturbances and decreased functioning. 70 They are also potentially risk factors for cardiovascular conditions and motor vehicle accidents.\n\nInfectious disease risks encountered by policemen are similar to those reported for other emergency first responders, and include tuberculosis, hepatitis, and HIV exposures. 29, 30, 71, 72 Studies of health outcomes in police Similar to firefighters, it is likely that studies of police cohorts are affected by both selection bias and the healthy worker effect. It has been noted that police workers differ anthropometrically from the general population, being taller and heavier than other occupational groups. 73 The level of physical conditioning required for entry into police work could select for individuals with lower overall risk for chronic disease, making it more difficult to detect occupation-specific increases in disease rates.\n\nThe psychologic stress experienced by police officers may lead to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. As with firefighters, many workers' compensation statutes include presumptive compensation for heart disease or hypertensive conditions developing during the course of a police officer's career. While it seems biologically plausible that the psychologic stress of police work could lead to sympathetically mediated elevations in blood pressure and development of cardiovascular complications, there 278 Occupational Health of Police and Firefighters Hazard Potential health outcome has been insufficient study of this association, and the existing studies provide conflicting results. A study of Iowa police officers found that the reported rate of cardiovascular disease was increased compared to the general population, 74 while a study of vital statistics found an increased risk of ischemic heart disease associated with the police profession. 75 A study of police officers in Rome did not demonstrate an elevated risk of cardiovascular mortality. 76\n\nOther occupational hazards linked to police work include back injuries and other musculoskeletal injuries due to ergonomic hazards. However, it is not clear that the overall risk and incidence of such injuries are greater than the general population. A 40-year follow-up study of a police cohort did not find an excess of death due to all accidents compared to the general population. 77\n\nA recent report of a cancer cluster in police discussed the possibility of cancer effects due to police radar. Concern has been raised about risk of testicular and brain tumors due to microwave radiation from radar devices. 78 There is a lack of definite scientific evidence to support such an association (see Chapter 33)\n\nA study of 551 police officers found that while critical incidents predisposed to nightmares, the general work environment was associated with increased sleep disturbances compared to a reference population. 70 In a study of police work and aging, maladaptive behaviors such as gambling and drinking were associated with perceived work stresses. 79 A study of police officers who had experienced traumatic events found that 7% met criteria of post-traumatic stress disorder based on a structured interview, while 34% had post-traumatic stress symptoms. 80 Psychologic stress may also lead to an increase in the risk of suicide for police officers. A study which compared police workers to municipal workers found a relative risk of 2.65 for suicide over homicide and accidents combined; 81 however, a recent review of studies of suicide and police officers did not find strong evidence of an increased risk. 82\n\nClinicians providing occupational medicine services for police officers face many similar issues to their work with firefighters. There is a need for both initial preplacement screening to identify medical conditions that could interfere with the demands of the job, periodic medical surveillance for work-related conditions, and preventive programs to reduce morbidity due to medical and psychologic problems. For example, concern that acute exposure to traumatic events could lead to the development of post-traumatic stress disorder has led to the development of mental health interventions such as critical incident debriefing 83 although the effectiveness of such interventions is uncertain. 84 Ongoing programs to maintain physical fitness and reduce risk factors for cardiovascular disease have also been initiated. However, many police departments have not instituted such preventive services, and there is a dearth of published guidelines for police health and safety relative to those promulgated for firefighters.\n\nOccupational medical programs for fire and police department include initial and periodic medical evaluations to identify conditions that could interfere with a firefighter or police worker's ability to safely perform their duties.\n\nOccupational medical providers should also be actively involved in safety programs, including serving on health and safety committees and collaborating with administrators on policies and procedures relating to prevention of line-of-duty injuries and fatalities. Assistance in development of rehabilitation sector protocols, hearing conservation programs, physical fitness programs and investigating incidents involving injuries or deaths of firefighters and police, as well as clusters of suspected occupational disease, are examples of occupational medical support for these individuals. Ongoing research to better define the most important risks and adverse health outcomes for these professions will help focus future efforts toward enhanced prevention."}
