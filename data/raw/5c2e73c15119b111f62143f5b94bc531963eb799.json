{"title": "", "body": "Abstract-A series of ~-hydroxy-~~aminoguanidine (HAG) derivatives were studied and compared for their effects on ribonu~leotide reductase activity in cell-free extracts; on nucleic acid synthesis and the growth of human colon carcinoma HT-29 cells; and on mouse leukemia L1210 cells in culture. The HAG derivatives ~RCH=NNHC(=NH) NHOH-tosy~ate] studied could be grouped as: (1) hydroxybenzylidines; (2) methoxyben~lidines;\n\nand (3) nitrobenzylidines substituted at the R position. 2'-Hydroxybenzylidine-HAG, the lead compound, was relatively active in both H'T-29 cells and L1210 cells (20 rt S and 13 f 4 pM for SO% inhibition of HT-29 and L1210 cell growth respectively). The monohydroxybenzylidene compounds were generally more active than the dihydroxy-and trihydroxybenzylidene-HAG derivatives. The methoxybenzylidene-HAGS were as active as the monohydroxybenzylidene-HAGS.\n\n2'-Hydroxy-4'-methoxybenzylidene-HAG was much more active than 2',4'dihydroxybenzylidene-HAG.\n\nThe mononitrobenzylidene-HAGS were more active than the dinitrobenzylidene-HAG compound. In general, L1210 cells were more sensitive to the effects of the HAG compounds than were HT-29 cells. There was good agreement between the concentration of drng required to inhibit the growth of HT-29 cells and that required to inhibit the growth of L1210 cells. There was also good correlation between the ability of HAG derivatives to inhibit r~bonu~leotide reductase activity and to inhibit tumor cell growth. Some derivatives, such as 2', 3', 4', inhibited L1210 cell growth by SO% at lower concentrations (7.8 and II .9 PM respectively) than the concentrations needed for SO% inhibition of HT.29 cell growth (1% and 234 HM respectively) and r~bonucleotide reductase activity (122 and 188 PM respectively). The studies of nucleic acid synthesis in Li210 cells using j3H]cytidine as a precursor showed that 2', 3', inhibited DNA synthesis at a lower concentration (29 FM for SO% inhibition) than was needed for the inhibition of RNA synthesis and formation of [jH]deoxycytidine nucleotides in the acid-soluble fraction (320 and 820 PM for SO% inhibition respectively). These results indicate that 2', 3', inhibits DNA synthesis in L1210 cells through other mechanisms rather than exclusively through the inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase activity.\n\nA series of N-hydroxy-N'-aminoguanidine (HAGS) derivatives have been synthesized by Lien's group and have been shown to inhibit tumor cell growth and +ihnnnrl~ntiA~ +~&rrtacp R&vity [l-7] . m_p H_A_G .-YYI...\"*\"Y.'..I .\"....._.l__ derivatives, which have a core structure resembling hydroxyurea, are believed to act through the same mechanism as hydroxyurea, a specific inhibitor of the non-heme iron subunit of ribonucleotide reductase. In a series of papers from this laboratory [4-71, it was reported that small structural changes in the R-groups attached to HAG altered the inhibitory effects of these compounds on both ribonucleotide reductase activity and L1210 cell growth. Further, it was found that there was good correlation between the ability of the HAG derivatives to inhibit L1210 cell growth and to inhibit ribonucleotide reductase activity [4] .

Mouse leukemia L1210 cells were grown in suspension culture in RPM1 1640 culture medium supplemented with 10% horse serum, sodium bicarbonate (2 g/L). and gentamicin sulfate (50 mg/L). Human colon carcinoma HT-29 cells were grown as a monolayer in RPM1 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 40 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-l-piperazine-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), pH 7.4, and gentamicin sulfnte (50 me/L).\n\nMicroculture ietrazolium assay. Single cell suspensions of L1210 celis were obtained by mechanical disa~gregation and of HT-29 cells by trypsinization. The cell counts were performed using a Coulter counter. model ZBI. A modification of the microculture tetrazolium assay (MTT assay) was used, as described by Carmichael et al. [9] . HT-29 cells were seeded into each well of 96well plates at 1500 cells/ well in 150,uL of RPM1 1640 medium. After 48 hr of incubation at 37\" in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO,/95% air, drugs in SOpL of medium were added to triplicate culture wells, and plates were incubated for 6 days at 37\". Fifteen microliters of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2.5diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT, 5 mg/mL in phosphate-buffered saline) was added to each well, and the plates were incubated for 4 hr. At the end of the incubation, the medium was removed from each well, and 150 @L of DMSO was added to solubilize the Mu-formazan product. Absorbance at 490nm (test fiiter) and 630 nm (reference filter) was measured with a Dynatech MR700 microplate reader (Alexandria, VA). L1210 cells were seeded into wells in microculture plates in 15OpL of culture medium 1000 cells/well and were incubated at 37\". After 24 hr of incubation, drugs in 50 ,uL of culture medium were added to each well. After 2 days of exposure to drugs, MTT (15 JLL. 5 mg/mL) was added to each well and the ceils were incubated for 4 hr at 37\". The plates were centrifuged for 10 min at 5OOg and the culture medium was aspirated carefully. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 15OpL) was added to solubilize the formazan product. After thorough mixing with a multichannel pipetter, absorbance at 570 and 630nm was measured.\n\nAssay of ribonucleotide reductase activity. CDP reductase activity was measured by the method of Steeper and Steuart [lo] . The reaction mixture contained in a final volume of 15OvL: [\"C]CDP (25 nmol, 0.05 PCi), dithioerythritol (900 nmol), magnesium acetate (600 nmol), ATP (300 nmol), and the partially purified enzyme from Ehrich ascites tumor cells. Since DMSO (final concentration of 0.2%) was required to solubilize the HAG derivatives, all controls received the same amount ot DMSO. All assays were carried out in triplicate. The icsO values were estimated by using the method of Chou and Talalay [ 1 I].\n\n[3H]Cytidinr~ rneru/w/i.sn~. The cells were cultured in 8mL of fresh medium in a flask at a final concentration of 6.4 x 10' cells/ml (HT-29 cells) or 4.2 X 10h cells/mL (L1210 cells) with or without drugs. After a YO-min incubation at 37\" in humidified 95% air/S% CO,. ]H]cytidine (2 @i) was added to each flask and the cells were incubated further for 30 min. At the end of the incubation period. the cell suspensions were cooled and centrifuged. The cells were collected and subjected to a modified Schmidt-Thannhauser procedure [4, 121 . The acid-soluble fraction was obtained by extraction of the cells with 1 mL of 6% perchloric acid (three times). The acidsoluble fraction was neutralized with 5 M KOH, and the KCIOJ was removed by centrifugation.\n\nThe supernatant fluid was Iyophilized. dissolved in 0.7 mL of 0. I M Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, and then incubated with crude snake venom (Crotalus atrox, 3.2 mg) for 4 hr at 37\". The reaction was stopped by heating the tube in a boning water bath for 4min and the samples were applied to a f-mL column of Dowex-l-borate to separate deoxyc~~t~dine from cytidine 1131. The acid-insoluble fraction was dissolved in I mL of 0.5 M NaOH and incubated overnight at 37\". The solution was cooled and 60% perchloric acid was added to reprecipitate DNA. After centrifugation. the supernatant fluid (RNA) was transferred to another tube, and the pellet was solubilized in 0.5 M NaQH.\n\nceils and L1210 c&s. The microculture tetrazolium assay (MTT assay) was used to evaluate the effects of HAG derivatives on the growth of HT-29 cells and LI210 cells. The structures of the HAG derivatives [RCN=NNHC(=NH)N~~OH tosylate] are given in Fig. 1 : and the data are presented in Table I . Group I compounds were hydroxylated-benzylidene derivatives. The monohydroxylated benzylidine-HAG (IA) was the most active in this group of compounds; 2',4'-dihydroxybenzylidene-HAG (IB) was the least active. L1210 cells were much more sensitive to compounds IC and IE than were HT-29 cells as measured by the MTT growth assay. To confirm these differences, growth studies were conducted in which cell counts were made. Cell count data (not shown) showed that these differences between the rcsfl values for HT-29 and L1210 cells were real and were not due to an artifact of the MTT assay. Group II compounds were methoxy-substituted analogs. Compounds IIA and IIB were more active as inhibitors of tumor cell growth than was compound IIC. Group III compounds had nitro-groups substituted on the benzylidene ring. The mononitro-substituted compounds (IIIA, B and D) were more active than dinitro-substituted HAG (IIIC). In general, L1210 cells were more sensitive to the growth inhibitory effects of these HAG compounds than were the HT-29 cells.\n\nEffect~s of HAG derivutives on r~bo~ucieot~d~~ redz~ct~.~e uctiuity. 'The effects of HAG derivatives on ribonucleotide reductase activity were studied using CDP as the substrate for ribonLIcle~tide reductase. As seen in Table 1 , in general there was good correlation between the effects of these compounds on ribonucleotide reductase activity and on tumor cell growth. For some derivatives, such as 3',6'-dimethoxybenzylidine-HAG (IIC) and 2'hydroxy-5'-nitrobenzylidine-HAG (IIIB), relatively higher concentrations of these compounds were required to inhibit ~bonucIeotide reductase activity than to inhibit tumor cell~growth. For other compounds such as 3',4',5'-(IE) and 2'.3',4'-trihy-droxybenzylidin~-GAG (IC), there was not a good correlation between the inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase and the inhibition of L1210 cell growth. These compounds inhibited L1210 cell growth at much lower concentrations than those required for the inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase activity. (in situ ribonucleotide reductase activity) were measured. As shown in Fig. 2 , the incorporation of [3H]cytidine into RNA and DNA fractions was ;nh;h;t.=.rt by 2',3',4'_trih.,rl mu,rhPn7~rlirlinP_UA~ IIIIIIVLL~U LL.L.,\"I\"raJ \"\"\"'J\"\"\".~~ 11' LV (IC) in HT-29 cells in a similar fashion; the formation of [3H]deoxycytidine nucleotide required higher concentrations of 2~,3i,4'-trihydroxybenzylidine-HAG (IC). In L1210 cells, 2',3',4'-trihydroxybenzylidine-HAG (IC) inhibited DNA synthesis to a greater extent than either RNA synthesis or deoxycytidine nucleotide formation.\n\nThe reaction in which ribonucleoside 5'-diphosphates are reduced to the corresponding 2'-deoxyribonucleoside 5'-diphosphates is catalyzed by ribonucleotide reductase. This step is the rate-limiting process in the de nouo synthesis of the deoxyribonucleoside trophosphates required for DNA synthesis [14-161. Ribonucleotide reductase activity is cetl cycle dependent and increases dramatically at late G,-early S phase [17, 181. Further. it has been shown that the activity of this enzyme is elevated in relation to the growth rate of a tumor [ 19. 201. Thus. ribonucleotide reductase is an appropriate site for enzvme-targeted chenlotherapy. The results of our St&es indicate that the inhibition of tumor cell growth by the HAG derivatives is generally related to their inhibitory effects on ribonucleotide reductaae activity. Some HAG derivatives, such as 2', . may have additional mechanisms of action. Elford er al. [21] have studied a series of polyhydroxybenzeIle derivatives of hydroxamic acid. Using an assay with the stable free-radical, diphenylpicrylhydrazyl.\n\nit was shown that the trihydroxy-derivatives of benzohydroxamic acids consumed the free-radical at a rate at least 80 times that of the monohydroxybenzohydroxamic acid. It is possible that 2',3',4'trihydroxybenzylidene-HAG (IC) also has other int~cellular sites of action involving an ~l~teracti[)n with free radicals.\n\n2',3',4'-Trihydroxybenzylidine-HAG (1C) also inhibited RNA synthesis. This result differs from that of hydroxyurea, in that hydroxyurca (and other HAG derivatives) does not inhibit RNA synthesis on short-term incubation [S]. It is not clear whether the inhibition of RNA synthesis by this compound is essential for the inhibition of tumor cell growth.\n\nSmall structural changes in the R-group of HAG derivatives greatly aftered the potency of these derivatives. The potency of the HAG derivatives was compared on the basis of their ICKY) values. The IC~(, values for tumor cell growth were determined by MTT assay. These values corresponded very closely to the icso values that were determined for some of the HAG compounds by direct cell count using the Coulter counter. With respect to the hydroxybenzylidene-HAGS, the monohydroxybenzylidine- In contrast, the substitution of a methoxy group on the 4-position (IIA) did not alter the inhibitory natrlrp nf the UAG C1eriwtivm\n\nThe ~TPCP~,.P nf a .'U.UlV VL L..\" 114.w YII.,ULL,VY. AL.\" y,.,\"\"..C\" <II u hydroxy substituent at the 3'-position of the R-group seemed to play an important role in inhibiting L1210 cell growth. In the methoxybenzyiidine-GAG group of compounds, placement of a methoxy substituent(s) on the benzyiidine ring at either the 4'-or 6'position did not alter the effect of 2'-hydroxybenzylidine-HAG (IA) on ribonucleotide reductase activity and tumor cell growth. However. 3,6-dimethoxybenzylidine-HAG (IIC) was less active in both HT-29 cells and L1210 cells than was 2'hydroxy-4'-methoxybenzylidine-HAG (IIA) or 2'hydroxy-4',6'-dimethoxybenzylidine-HAG (IIB), and it had almost no activity as an inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase activity.\n\nThe addition of a chloro substituent on 3'-nitrobenzylidine-HAG did not alter its inhibitory properties.\n\nWhen the activity of 2'-hydroxy-5'-nitrobenzylid~ne-HAG (IIIB) was compared with that of 2'-hydroxybenzylidine-HAG (IA), it was seen that a nitro substituent at the 5'-position of the Rgroup increased the activity of 2'-hydroxybenzylidine-HAG in L1210 cells 5.5-fold and decreased its ~bonucleotid~ reductase inhibitory activity by 55%. When the activity of 2'-hydroxy-3',5'-dinitrobenzylidine-HAG (IIIC) was compared with that of 2'-hydroxy-5'-nitrobenzylidine-HAG (IIIB), it was seen that the addition of the nitro substituent at the 3'-position of the phenyl ring decreased the activity of this compound as an inhibitor of the growth of HT-29 and L1210 cells. The presence of a nitro substituent either increased or decreased the inhibition of tumor cell growth and ribonucleotide reductase activity relative to 2'-hydroxybenzylidene-HAG. It appears that the effect of a nitro substituent depends on the ring position or the number of nitro substituents on the phenyl ring of 2'-hydroxybenzylidine-HAGS .\n\nIn conclusion, our results show that most of the HAG derivatives examined in this series were more active in both f-IT-29 cells and L1210 cells than hydroxyurea\n\n(IQ values for HT-29 and L1210 cells were 206 and 38 I.LM respectively).\n\nThese compounds appeared to inhibit tumor cell growth by inhibiting cellular ribonucleotide reductase activity, while some of the comnounds anneared to inhibit I.1210 ceil r ---------=r--------._______. ----_ --__ growth at lower concentrations by targeting other metabolic sites as well as ribonucleotide reductase.\n\nThe potency of the HAG derivatives as inhibitors of ribonucleotide reductase and tumor cell growth depended not only on the nature of the substituent but also on the location of the substituent on the phenyl ring."}
