{"title": "In-vivo targeted tagging of RNA isolates cell specific transcriptional responses to environmental stimuli and identifies liver-to-adipose RNA transfer 2 3", "body": "Small molecule design and genetic approach for targeted in-vivo labeling of RNA 93 5-Ethynyl Uridine (5EU) is a synthetic uridine analogue extensively used in RNA turnover studies 94 [27] [28] [29] . The nitrogenous base contains an alkyne group that can be covalently linked to an azide 95 group using a simple copper mediated reaction called click chemistry [30, 31] . This synthetic base 96 has been demonstrated to incorporate into transcribing RNA in place of uridine and have little to 97 no biological effects thereafter [27] . Following administration to mice, 5EU is readily taken up by 98 cells with no regard to cell identity, depending to some extent on the administration method and 99 dosage used [27] . Here, we present a novel method for the targeted in-vivo delivery of 5EU. 100 To achieve this, we designed a 'pro-drug' of the 5EU base (HD5EU) that is based on the 'Hep-101 Direct' pro-drug design [32, 33] (Figure 1a) . This design was developed to target small molecules 102 and nucleotide analogues to the human CYP3A4 enzyme and several small molecules of this 103 design have been or are currently in clinical studies [34] [35] [36] . The human CYP3A4 enzyme 104 catalyzes an oxidative cleavage of the HD5EU small molecule which, following a spontaneous 105 beta-elimination, results in the formation of 5EU mono-phosphate that can then be incorporated 106 into transcribing RNA (Figure 1a ). HD5EU was synthesized by Chiroblock GmbH, the identity 107 of the final product was validated using MS, p-NMR and h-NMR and the molecule's purity was 108 assessed at over 98% (Sup. Figure 1a-d) . 109 In addition to the HD5EU small molecule we took advantage of the published humanized liver 110 specific CYP3A4 mouse line FVB/129P2-Cyp3a13 tm1Ahs Del(5Cyp3a57-Cyp3a59) 1Ahs 111 Tg(APOE-CYP3A4) A1Ahs obtained from Taconic [37, 38] . These humanized mice (hCYP3A4) 112 express the human CYP3A4 enzyme under a modified Apolipoprotein E (APOE) promoter and 113 are stably knocked out for nine homologous murine genes, thus leaving the human enzyme as the 114 sole member of the enzyme family to be expressed in a Cre-independent, tissue-specific manner 115 in-vivo. In keeping with published data on the activity of the modified ApoE promoter [39] , qRT-116 PCR and WB analyses demonstrate restricted expression of the human Cyp3a4 enzyme to liver 117 and kidney (Figure 1b-c) . As such, upon administration of the HD5EU small molecule to the 118 humanized CYP3A4 mice, we expect the molecule to be metabolized to bioavailable 5EU mono- 143 To test and validate the metabolism of the HD5EU small molecule, we first isolated primary 144 hepatocytes from hCYP3A4 mice. Following an 8 hour treatment of primary hepatocytes with 145 1mM HD5EU or 5EU, nuclear staining similar to 5EU labeling is clearly evident following click- We administered HD5EU to humanized CYP3A4 mice and already 2 hours following 153 administration found robust nuclear staining in hepatocytes and kidney epithelial cells but in no 154 .

This in contrast to mice administered with 5EU where nuclear staining was 155 evident in multiple tissues (Figure 2b-c and sup. Figure 2a) . Of note, animals administered with 156 HD5EU did not demonstrate any visible side effects. In addition we could not detect any signs of 157 DNA damage or apoptosis in the liver during the different treatment regimens as demonstrated by 158 staining for phosph-P53 and cleaved Caspase-3, supporting HD5EU as a non-toxic agent (Sup To validate that nuclear staining evident in-vitro and in-vivo following HD5EU treatment is indeed 177 indicative of 5EU incorporation into transcribing RNA, we adopted the mass-spectrometry method 178 described by Su et. al [41] . Using a column with a smaller inner diameter and lower flow rates to 179 improve the response of individual nucleotides, we were able to identify a wide range of 180 unmodified and modified nucleotides (Sup. Table 1 ). 5EU (m/z 269.0768) was well separated quantify 5EU incorporation into both short (less than 200bp) and long RNA isolated from the liver 195 of HD5EU treated mice, 2 hours following the administration of the compound (Figure 3f-g) . 8h 196 following HD5EU administration 5EU was still detectable in long RNA (though it could not be 197 accurately quantified as it was below quantification limit), whilst only a moderate reduction was 198 detected in short RNA. 199 Taken together, these results confirm that HD5EU is metabolized in a CYP3A4 dependent manner 200 to 5EU, which is then incorporated into transcribing RNA.

In addition, following a 2 hour treatment 221 with HD5EU we failed to generate libraries following biotinylation and pull-down from plasma 222 and from additional tissues of the HD5EU-treated mice, this in contrast to liver and kidney where 223 expected library amplicons were generated (Sup.

Cerevisiae with labeled small RNAs derived from mouse liver. reprogramming. 237 We continued to examine if in-vivo labeling enriches for transcriptional programs of specific 238 cellular populations within complex tissues in-vivo, such as the proximal renal epithelial cells in 239 the kidney and hepatocytes in liver, and whether detection of environmentally induced 240 transcriptional reprogramming is possible. To this end we fed mice with high fat (HFD) or control 241 low fat (LFD) diets for two weeks. Following this acute HFD exposure, which is expected to alter 242 the transcriptional program in the liver [42], we administered HD5EU 2 hours before sacrificing. 243 We then continued to generate poly-A RNA libraries from kidney and liver input and pull-down 244 RNA.\n\nFollowing mapping with the STAR aligner [43], transcript quantification using HTSeq-count and 246 differential pull-down analyses using the NOISeq package [44], we defined pulled-down 247 transcripts as those whose abundance can be estimated with a high degree of confidence to be at The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

The brush boarder membrane in the kidney is a unique feature of proximal 255 renal epithelial cells [46] , and among pulled-down transcripts, the Solute Carrier Family 9 member 256 A3 (Slc9a3) is one of its specific markers. Slc9a3 is the sodium-hydrogen antiporter 3, which is 257 highly expressed in the proximal tubule and allows active transport of sodium to the cell.

Importantly, with no need for 301 the disruption of the tissue architecture or interference with the cellular microenvironment. Additional support in favor of the hepatic origin of plasma labeled transcripts can be found in 359 fragments originating from protein coding genes. These protein coding fragments demonstrate a 360 significant enrichment for liver specific and highly expressed genes, whilst transcripts 361 constitutively depleted in pull-down RNA demonstrate an enrichment for bone marrow specific 362 protein coding fragments, genes related to hematopoietic differentiation and genes specific to 363 neutrophil function. (Figure 5d and sup. table 11) . This result may suggests that the 364 hematopoietic system is one of the major contributors of circulating RNAs. HFD and LFD specific 365 pulled-down protein coding transcripts demonstrate differential enrichment for annotations 366 including adipocytokine signaling and mitochondrial electron transport respectively (Figure 5e ).\n\nThe significant enrichment found for liver specific protein coding genes among pulled-down 368 transcripts supports the hypothesis that pulled-down ccfRNA transcripts originate in hepatocytes, 369 where Cyp3a4 expression metabolizes HD5EU to 5EU, allowing its incorporation into nascent The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

As expected given the 417 increased dietary intake of free fatty acids following HFD feeding, downregulation of Srebf1 and 418 of several target genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis such as FasN, Acaca, and Scd2 is evident 419 (Figure 6c-d) . (Figure 4b-g) . In addition, environmentally induced transcriptional reprogramming is evident 469 following labelling (Figure 4h-k) . As opposed to recently described methods [14, 17, 20, 22] and Critically, and uniquely to iTag-RNA, we are also able to enrich for liver derived plasma ccfRNA 474 following an administration of multiple doses of HD5EU ( Figure 5) . Pulled-down plasma 475 ccfRNAs demonstrate an enrichment for liver derived RNA fragments of protein-coding genes, 476 whilst depleted transcripts demonstrate an enrichment for annotation relating to function and 477 differentiation of the hematopoietic system. Apart from fragments of protein coding genes, liver 478 secreted ccfRNA include various small RNA transcripts such as miRNA, mt-tRNAs and tRNAs.\n\nGiven the evident enrichment for mitochondrial transcripts following pull-down, our results 480 .

The functional significance of these tRNA fragments is unclear, but several studies have 482 suggested tRNAs and tRNA fragments can mediate cellular signaling, and that the overall tRNA 483 pool and composition within a cell has functional significance [70] . 484 We continued to explore the possibility that ccfRNAs are taken up by tissues in-vivo to mediate administration was always carried out at ZG-3 to avoid circadian effects.
