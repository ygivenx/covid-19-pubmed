{"title": "Title: Estimating the risk of COVID-19 death during the course of the outbreak in Korea", "body": "Since the first reports of cases from Wuhan in the Hubei Province of China in December 2019, more than 49\n\nChina [1] . Based on the estimates by a joint World Health Organization (WHO)-China fact-finding mission, 51 the epidemic in China peaked between late January and early February 2020 [2] . However, the virus has 52 been seeded in numerous countries and is now generating sustained outbreaks in many areas of the world 53 with the rate of new cases outpacing the rate of China. As of March 21,2020, the global cumulative number 54 of reported infections and deaths were 266,073 and 11,183, respectively [1] . Outside China, new cases 55 initially occurred mainly among travelers from China and their contacts, but local transmission is now 56 driving major outbreaks in numerous countries including U.S., Italy, Spain, Germany, and Iran [1] . 57\n\nThe spread of 2019 novel coronavirus disease in South Korea started on Jan 19, 2020, 58 when the first confirmed case of Chinese nationality entered the country from Wuhan, China [3] . Since 59 then, SARS-CoV-2 has continued to spread in Korea in the form of a series of clusters of variable size and 60 geographic location in addition to imported cases [4] . As of March 21, 2020, the cumulative number of 61 COVID-19 reported cases and deaths in Korea are at 8,799 and 102, respectively [5] . 62\n\nIn order to accurately estimate the epidemiological and economic burden with an emerging 63 infectious disease, assessing the associated risk for death from the disease as well as its transmission 64 potential are critical. Although the transmission modes of COVID-19 are not entirely understood, person-65 to-person spread via respiratory droplets appears to be the main mode of transmission. The transmissibility 66 of COVID-19 was found to be relatively high, with the mean basic reproduction number in the range 1.4-67 1.6 in Korea ([4]) and 2-7.1 for China [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . In the absence of vaccines against COVID-19 or antiviral 68 drugs for its treatment, epidemic control relies on the implementation of symptom monitoring and non-69 pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing and movement restrictions. It is worth noting that in 70\n\nKorea, movement restriction orders represent legal public health measures, including quarantine (isolation), 71 home isolation, or controlled travel [14] . 72 .

Gyeongsangbuk-do, estimates were low at the early stage and then increased and peaked in the midst of the 141 study period, and are now following a decreasing trend similar to the other two areas, reaching estimates 142 around 2.5%. 143\n\nThe latest estimates (March 21, 2020) of the time-delay adjusted CFR are at 1.3% (95% CrI: 1.0-144 In this paper we have derived estimates of the CFR for the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic in Korea, 151 a country that has relies on intensive social distancing and mass testing of suspected COVID-19 cases to 152 mitigate incidence levels of the disease and deliver early medical care to the most vulnerable, potentially 153 lowering the risk of death. Specifically, we have estimated time-delay adjusted CFR in three different 154 geographic areas in Korea and found that the most severely affected areas were Gyeongsangbuk-do while 155 the rest of Korea exhibits milder severity impact. Specifically, the delay-adjusted CFR in Gyeongsangbuk-156 do, largely driven by hospital-based transmission, was relatively high, being estimated at 2.4% (95% CrI: 157 1.6-3.4%), which is about 2-fold higher than our estimate for Daegu and for all regions in Korea. These 158 findings suggest that the situation in Gyeongsangbuk-do is more severe compared with the other affected 159 areas in Korea. 160\n\nOne can note a considerable increase in fatality risks with older age by multiple folds, with the 161 oldest age group exhibiting the highest case fatality. It was also reported that the risk of symptomatic 162 infection also increases with age, although this may be partially affected by preferential ascertainment of 163 In addition, our estimates on CFR are relatively lower than the CFR obtained from affected areas in China 174 (ranging from 1.41%-5.25%), based on the cases and deaths observed to date [18, 29] . In general, the CFR 175 of the same disease might vary greatly in different countries or even different regions of the same country, 176 partially due to differences in health control policies, availability of healthcare, medical standards, and 177 detection efficiency. In Korea, an extensive COVID-19 testing regime has been instituted, and authorities 178 launched a massive contact tracing as case numbers grew. As a result, the country has tested more people In conclusion, our estimates of the risk for death from COVID-19 in Korea as of March 21, 2020, 221 were as high as 2.4% in Gyeongsangbuk-do and as low as 0.7% in the less severely affected areas in Korea, 222 and this difference in CFR is likely influenced by nosocomial transmission of the disease. In the absence 223 of pharmaceutical interventions (i.e., vaccination and antiviral drugs), the control of COVID-19 is highly 224 .

The estimates of 226 CFR associated with COVID-19 is thus critical to help inform the assessments of health impacts and to 227 determine both the intensity and appropriateness of mitigation strategies as the epidemic unfolds. 228 .
