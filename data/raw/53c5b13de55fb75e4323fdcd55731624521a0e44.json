{"title": "Protein Composition of Coronavirus OC 43", "body": "A human coronavirus, strain OC 43, was propagated in suckling mouse brain and purified 5000-fold with a 90% yield. Purity of the virus was confirmed by electrophoretie, ultracentrifugal, and electron microscopic procedures. Immunodiffusion and immunoelectrophoresis tests revealed one precipitin line with normal mouse brain, three with purified virus, and four with crude virus when tested against anti-pure virus or anti-crude virus animal serums. The association of a host cell antigen with the virion was confirmed by standard HI and CF tests. of the bromelin-treatedvirus was 1.15 g/cm3 and of the intact OC 43 virion was 1.18 g/ems. By analytical ultracentrifugation the corrected sedimentation coefficient (~~0,~) of the OC 43 virion was determined to be 390 f 16 S, and the apparent molecular weight (MW,) was calculated to be 112 f 5 X 106daltons. INTRODUCTION Coronaviruses, a recently described group of human and animal viruses, resemble myxoviruses in size and structure, although various physical and host,-sensitivity characteristics set them apart. These factors have been thoroughly outlined in reviews by Estola (1970) and Bradburne and Tyrrell (1971) .\n\nAntigenic characterization of the avian infectious bronchitis virus, the first of the coronaviruses to be described, has revealed three soluble viral antigens in allantoic fluids of infected embryonated eggs (Tevethia and Cunningham, 1968) . Similar studies on human coronaviruses have only recently been conducted (McIntosh et al., 1969; Bradburne, 1970; Kaye et al., 1970) . In this report we describe the structural protein and antigenic composition of OC 43 virus harvested and purified from suckling mouse brain (SMB).\n\nSource and puri$ication of virus. OC 43 strain of human coronavirus was grown to high infectivity titers (~O'LD~O/.O~ ml) in SMB and harvested as a 20 % suspension in 0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The virus was extensively purified by temperature-dependent adsorption to and elution from fresh human \"0\" erythrocytes and by batch CaHP04 chromatography (Kaye et al., 1970) . The final purified virus suspen-sion was concenhrated either by ultrafiltration with XMlOOA or XM300 Diaflo membranes (Amicon CorporatiorQ, Lexington, MA), by pelleting at 20,000 rpm (26,400g) for 2 hr in a Beckman No. 40 rotor, or by hydrogel extraction (Lyphogel, Gelman Instrument Company, Ann Arbor, MI), depending upon the test's to be performed on the product.\n\nPreparation of imlnune sercG. Antiserums to crude virus (20 % suspension in PBS), normal SMB (20 70 in PBS), and purified virus were prepared in adult Swiss white mice, both as serum and ascitic fluid, in adult ,gu.inea pigs (Hartley strain), and in adult White Leghorn chickens. For the production of antiserum in mice, five weekly ip injections of 0.5 ml antigen were given, and the mice were exsanguinated 2 weeks after the last injection. For product'ion of as&c fiuid in mice, four weekly ip injections of 0.5 ml antigen were given (Days 0, 7, 14, 21) , by 0.2 ml of a 10% suspension of sarcoma M/TG ip on Day 25; 0.5 ml antigen ip on Day 28; paracentesis on Days 36, 39, and 42; and exsanguination on Day 42.\n\nThe schedule for producing antiserum in guinea pigs consist'ed of five weekly SC injections of 2.6 ml of a 50-50 mixture of antigen emulsified in Freund's incomplete adjuvant; guinea pigs were exsangtinat'ed 2 weeks after the final injection. In chickens a brief schedule was used t'o enhance the titer of precipitating antibodies. Two milliliters of antigen were given ip and 2 ml of a 50-50 mixture of antigen in Freund's complete adjuvant were given im in four sites (0.5 ml/site) on Days 0 and 7; the chickens were exsangainated en Day 13.\n\nPseimmunizat'ion serum samples were obtained from all experimental animals, and serum w-as obtained from control animals to monitor adventitious infections.\n\nSerologic tests. Hemagglutinin (HA) titrations were performed in \"the microtiter system with 0.01 l/l PBS diluent, pH 7.2, and 0.5 % adult chicken red blood cells (RBC) (IIierholzer et al., 1969) . Indirect HA (INA) tests for incomplete l~emagglutil~~~s were performed in the following manner. Seriai dilutions of test antigens were mixed ie 0.025-ml vol with 0.025 ml of 2 hemagglut,inin-inhibition ) antibody units of guinea pig anti-p virus serum and incubated for 2 hr at room temperature, T-W HA units of crude virus in 0.025 ml were added and the t'est reincubated for 4 hr at room temperature. er addition of 0.05 ml. of 0.5 % chicken R suspension and incubation for I hr at room tempera$urc, tests were observed for absence of i:nhibition ix wells containing dilutions of test materials.\n\nComplement $x&ion. (CF) tests. CF tesrs were performed by the standardized microt,iter method with overnight fixatiorl of 5 unit's of complement (Casey, 1965 )~ Protein n2easurenwnts. Protein determinations were made by the method of Lowry et al. (1951) and read in a spectropbotometer at 750 nm against a. BSA standard curve.\n\nImmunodi$usion ( )* Ouchterlony double-diffusion. tests lvere carried out OLZ 25 x 75-mm glass slides containing 4 mi 0.7 % agarose (Ma!lestad Lab ries, R polis, MS) in 0.81 N st-ith merthiolate as preservative. Wells 3 mm in diameter and 9 mm apart, cent.er-to-center, were filled three times. The plates were incuba,ted at room t'emperature for 2 days, photographed, stained with amido black (set: IE procedure), and rephotographed.\n\nI~n-nnzunoeZeci~o~horesis (123). 133 was performed on 25 X 75-mm slides containing 4 ml I % agarose in 0,025 A1 Tris-barbitalsodium barbital buffer, pH 8.8. Antiger a-& 1.5 mm in diameter were filled with 0.02-Q.03 ml sample. The samples were eleetrophoresed for 75 min at, 24\" and 250 V at 5-&nA/'siide in a 0.50 M Tris-barbital-sodium barbital buffer, ppi 8.8. Arcs of preeipit'ate developed after application of appropriat'e ant'isera to l-mm troughs and incubation for li da>-at room t,emperature, Aft'er immunoelect8rophoresis the a,ger slides were sta,ined for protein and protcinbound lipid (Uriel, 1964) . The slides were washed for 2 days in 2 % NaCl, rinsed for 2 days in distilled water, and dried overnight under filt,er paper at room temperature. For protein staining, the slides were immersed in amide black 10B (0.1% stain in 10 % acetic acid and 45 % methanol) for 20 min and destained through several rinses in the acetic acid-methanol solvent. For lipids, slides were stained with oil red 0 (saturated solution in 60 % ethanol) and destained in 50 % ethanol.\n\nPolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed based on the method of Holowczak and Joklik (1967) . Gels, 6 X 60 mm, were composed of 7.5 % acrylamide, 0.20 % N , N'methylenebisacrylamide, 0.1% sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), 0.0575 % N ,N ,N',N'tetramethylethylenediamine, and 0.07 % ammonium persulfate, in 0.01 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. Samples to be electrophoresed were solubilized by incubation for 1 hr at 37\" with equal volumes of the 0.01 M phosphate buffer containing 4% SLS, 2 % 2-mercaptoethanol (ME), and 1.0 M urea. Samples were then heated at 100\" for 1 min. The materials were dialyzed overnight at room temperature against the phosphate buffer containing 0.1% SLS, 0.1% ME, and 0.05 M urea. Samples thus treated and containing 75-135 pg of protein were stabilized to lo-20% sucrose and applied to the gels. The gels were electrophoresed at 78-86 V and at 3.5 mA per tube at room temperature until a tracking dye, 0.05 % bromphenol blue, migrated to 1 mm from the distal end of the gel (about 60 min). The reservoir buffer in both chambers during electrophoresis was 0.01 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, with 0.1% SLS.\n\nThe gels were removed from the support tubes and stained for protein, protein-bound lipid, and protein-bound carbohydrate. For protein staining, the gels were fixed with 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) for 4 hr, stained with 0.05 % Coomassie blue in 10 % TCA for 8-12 hr, and destained for 3-5 days in 10 % TCA (Chrambach et al., 1967) . Alternately, gels were stained with 0.1% Coomassie blue in 50 % methanol/7.5% acetic acid and power-destained as described by Maize1 et al. (1970) . For lipid staining, gels were immersed in saturated oil red 0 in 60 % ethanol for 2 hr, destained with 50% ethanol for 2 hr, and rehydrated in distilled water (Crowle, 1961) . For carbohydrate staining, gels were oxidized with 1% periodic acid in 3 % acetic acid for 1 hr, rinsed in distilled water for 1 hr, stained with 0.5% reduced acidified basic fuchsin (Schiff's reagent) for 45 min, destained in distilled water, and stored in 1% sodium metabisulfite (Clarke, 1964) .\n\nAll gels were scanned for accurate detection and quantitation of bands with a Gilford model 2410 linear transport coupled to a model 2000 recording spectrophotometer (Gilford Laboratories, Oberlin, OH). Gels stained with Coomassie blue were scanned at 640 nm, those with oil red 0 at the absorption maximum of 492 nm, and those with Schiff's reagent at the absorption maximum of 534 nm.\n\nMolecular weight determinations of the separated polypeptides were performed by PAGE as described by Shapiro et al. (1967) . Solubilized cyt. c, RNAse, hemoglobin, carboxypeptidase A, pepsin (all from Nutritional Biochemicals Company, Cleveland, OH), trypsin, ovalbumin, bovine serum albumin (Schwarz/Mann, Orangeburg, NY), and fetuin (GIBCO, Grand Island, NY), and nonsolubilized purified human IgG (courtesy of Dr. H. Daugharty, Center for Disease Control) were used as molecular weight standards in coelectrophoresis and companion electrophoresis runs. Fetuin was also used as a carbohydrate standard.\n\nEnzyme treatment. Purified virus was treated with bromelin (NBC, Cleveland, OH) in a reducing buffer with dithiothreitol as described by Compans et al. (1970) and was subsequently repurified on a 5-40% potassium tartrate gradient by equilibrium centrifugation at 75,000g.\n\nElectron microscopy (EM). Negative contrast electron microscopy was carried out with concentrated samples sprayed onto carbon-coated grids, stained with 2.0 % sodium phosphotungstate (PTA), and examined at 80 kV with a Philips EM-300 electron microscope.\n\nUltracentrifugal analysis. Sedimentation coefficients and est.imates of molecular weight were determined at 15, 16, and 18,000 rpm and at 20.0\" with a An-H titanium rotor and 12-mm Kel-F cells in a Beckman Model E ultracentrifuge equipped with schlieren, interference, and uv optical systems. The virus samples were dialyzed against 0.01 M sodium borate buffer, pH 8.0, with 0.16 M NaCl, and contained 1-2 mg protein per 0.4 ml. Apparent molecular weight (iWW,> was calculated from eqrations derived by Svedberg and Pedersen (1940) and as applied by Burness and Clothier (1970) .\n\nV&YLS purity. The virus used throughout these studies was purified to a 5000-fold decrease in total protein, with a yield of he purity of the virus (at an HA titer of 1.3 X IOj) was confirmed by immunologic procedures, density gradient centrifugation, electron microscopy, and analytical procedures. Electron microscopy at low and high magnifications showed very clean fields of particles exhibit,ing the pleomorphism typical of this virus (Almeida and Tyrrell, 1967; Almeida and Waterson, 1970; Apostolov eE GEL, 1970; McIntosh et al., 1970; Bradburne and Tyrrell, 1971) . Analytical ultracentrifugation revealed a sharp peak at 15,000 rpm with as little as 1.0 mg protein in the sample; this peak had the same sedimentation rate as one of several broad peaks observed when crude virus (at 2-4 mg protein/.4 ml) was sedimented under identical conditions. Acrylamide gels loaded with untreated concentrated supernatant fluids obtained from eentrifugation (23,SOOg, 2 hr) of purified virus suspensions revealed no protein bands. Imnunixation and serology. Mice, guinea pigs, and chickens were immunized with normal SMB (NSMB), crude SW%grown OC 43, and purified virus. All sera obtaine before and during the course of immunization were tested for III, CF, and precipitating antibody. Preimmunization serum samples and sera from normal animals were consistently negative. Among the postimmunization serum samples, mouse as&tic fluid and chicken antisera had the lowest HI and Cl? antibody tit'ers to OC 43 virus and guinea pig antisera had the highest titers (Table 1)~ ice and guinea pigs immunized shoxved low-level and CF nst the purified CC antigen. Inznzunodi$usion with unsolubilid zi~zis~ Mouse as&tic fluids and mose antiserums prepared against crude virus and purified virus gave predominantly single bands (of identity) with pure or crude virus in standard ID tests. However, test's with guinea pig and chicken anti-crude and anti-pnre virus sera showed two precipitin bands of complete identity bet'ween pure and crude virus, and one additional band of identity between pure virus, crude virus, and NSl8B (Fig.  IA) . These results suggest that. the CC 43 virion contains at least one mouse brain antigen Addit'ional evidence of host antigen in the intact virus is en by the identical he between anti-KS1$ serum and the three concentrated antigens (Fig. 333) . Immune-~ electrophoresis of t'hese same antigenantiserum eombinations demonstrated three or four preeipit,in arcs with crude virus and two-three arcs with purified virus, and con. firmed the presence of a mouse brain protein associated with the purified virus (Fig. 2) . PAGE with solubilixed virus. The purified virus was solubilized with SLS-ME-urea, and the resulting proteins were separated by PAGE. The staining patterns with Coomassie blue revealed a minimum of six bands, five of which might be considered major (Fig. 3) . One additional very faint band was occasionally observed between bands one and two.\n\nThe molecular weights of the viral proteins, as determined by co-and companion electrophoresis with proteins of known molecular weights, were estimated to be 191,000; 104,000; 60,000; 47,000; 30,000; and 15,000 in decreasing order (Fig. 4) . The very faint band was located in the 165,000-dalton region of several gels. Gels were also stained for lipid and carbohydrate (Fig. 5) No. 1 was more evident in gels in which the sample was not heated, than in those in which it was heated at 100\u00b0C for 1 min. Glycopolypeptide No. 2 (8 %) was found in the smallest quantity ( Table 2) .\n\nComposition of the projection antigen. The spikes on the virion surface have previously been associated with HA activity and are thought to comprise the major antigens measured by both the HI and CF tests. Hence these surface spikes or \"projection ant,igens,\" unlike influenza virus, appear to consist of a single species (Kaye et al., 1970) . Absence of neuraminidase was confirmed using a highly sensitive assay system (Laver and Kilbourne, 1966; Laver and Valentine, 1969) : overnight incubation of lo5 HA units of virus with fetuin failed to yield any detectable sialic acid.\n\nAttempts to determine directly which polypeptides comprise the external antigen were unsuccessful. Bands from acrylamide gels were eluted in PBS, dialyzed, and titrated for direct and indirect hemagglutination. In both tests, the apparent residual SLS adversely affected the erythrocytes.\n\nRepeated attempts to determine the composition of the projection antigen by selectively removing the entire projection from the virus envelope also were of limited value. The agents used represented the major chemical groups often employed in similar studies : reduc ing agents (6.0 M guanidine + 5.0 mlVl dithiothreitol (DTT); 0.003 and 0.03 M DTT; 0.005, 0.05, and 0.5 ,U 2mercaptoethylamine) ; oxidizing agents (67.0 and 85.7 % dimethylsulfoxide; 0.1 and 0.2 % fl-propiolactone); ionic detergents (0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 % desoxycholate; 0.5 % Tween 20) ; and nonionic detergents (1.0 % Nonidet P-40; 1.0% P-40 + 0.5 M urea). These chemical treatments, all used in selected buffer, salt, pH, and temperature environments, were uniformly nonselective and were overly destructive to the entire virion.\n\nThe bromelin procedure described by Compans et al. (1970) for infiuenzaviruses purified virus was monitored every 30 mill was employed as an indirect means of locat-under the electron microscope. The ~rojeeing t,he proteins comprising the projection tions were completely degraded after 2 Ix of antigen. 'The effect of bromelin treatment on incubation at, 37\u00b0C with 0.13 % bromelia. ET AL. The 2-hr test samples, along with the appropriate virus and enzyme controls, were repurified on 5-40% aqueous neutral potassium tartrate gradients in an SW39L rotor at 75,000g for 8 hr. The untreated control virus banded in the 1.18 g/cm3 region of the gradient and was associated with a sharp HA peak. By EM this band was found to consist of typical virions (Fig. 6A, B) . The bromelintreated virus banded in the 1.15 g/cm3 region of the gradient; by EM this band contained completely \"despiked\" but fully enveloped virus particles (Fig. 6C-E) . All biological activity was lost by the enzyme treatment (Table 3 ). The repurified virus control, the purified \"despiked\" particles, and the comparable area from the gradient purification of the bromelin control sample were examined by PAGE. Polypeptides 2 and 6-both glycoproteins-were absent in the bromelin-treated sample (Fig. 7) .\n\nSedimentation coeficient and molecular weight of vi&n. Analytical ultracentrifugation of intact, purified virus (HA titer 2.6 X 105) at 15, 16, and 18,000 rpm revealed a single distinct peak with a sedimentation coefficient (sz~,~) of 368 =t 14 X lo-l3 sec. Corrections for solvent density and viscosity and for partial specific volume of the virus resulted in an S;,,, value of 380 f 15 S. The virus concentration was extrapolated to infinite dilution from the data of Burness and Clothier (1970) to give a fully corrected sedimentation coefficient (X,\",,,) of approximately 390 + 16 S. The apparent molecular weight (Il!UV,) was calculated to be 112 & 5 X lo6 daltons, so that the particle weight of one OC 43 virion is approximately I8 =t 1. x lo-l7 g.\n\nThe coronavirus virion has been the subject of a number of studies during the past few years and much is now known about its morphology.\n\nThe coronaviruses contain Rn'A (Hamre et al., 1967; Becker et al., 1967; Bradburne and Tyrrell, 1971 ) which may be present as a form of ribonucleoprotein (RXP) or internal nucleocapsid. Tevethia and Cunningham (1968) thought t,hat \"'antigen 2\" of avian infectious bronchitis (MB) virus was RNP since it was sensitive to both ribonuclease and proteolytic enzymes. Becker et a,Z., (1967) described an \"inner shell\" which may have been an internal nucleocapsid. More positive proof is ofi'cred by Apostoiov ei al. (1970) who found in AIB virus a threadlike internal component 7-8 nm in diameter.\n\nMost reports agree that coronaviruses possess an outer double membrane and an inner layer (Becker et al., 1967; ~4postolov et al.: 1970; Gppal and Chu, 1970; Oshiro et al., 1971) . For APB and 2293 viruses, Becker et al. (1967) described a 7-8-nm thick outer shell, a 4-8 nm electronlucent. zone, and a 9-17-nm thick inner shell. Oshiro et al. (1971) found a similar pattern in the Linder strain of 2293. Apostolov et al. (1970) describe this envelope as a \"S-layered unit, membrane structure.\" The viral envelope of and 2293 appears to contain host lipoecker et al., 1967; Berry and 68, Apostolov et a,l., 1970) . This finding is consistent with the mode of virus reproduction-budding from intracytoplasmic cisternae (Becker et aE.> 1967; Hamre et al., 1967; ~4postolov et al., 1970; Oshiro et al., 1971) .\n\nThe projections of coronaviruses are approximately 10 nm across the club or petalshaped terminus and are 15 to 2O-nm long (Almeida and Tyrrell, 1967; Bradbume and Tyrrell, 1971) . They may be composed of two antigens (Tevethia and Cunningham, 1968) .\n\nThe number of antigens associated with t'he coronaviruses is still not clear. Part of t'he problem ma#y relate to the inability to eff ecOively disrupt, the virus. Two-thrri: bands were seen in ID tests and three-four preeipitin arcs were seen in IE t&s with crude QC 43 virus and anticrude or anti-pure virus sera. These were only observed with highly eoncentrat'ed antigen prepara.tions. The addSon of SLS or of Na N-!anroylsarcosinate in various concentrations failed ?'o increase the number of precipitin iincs. Our findings support the multipliciLy of bands observed in other st'udies (Tevethia and Cunningham, 1968; McIntosh et ai., 1969 , Bradbusne, 1970 .\n\nThe one arc found at the antigen well in ID and PE tests was probably whole virus. Another preeipitin line was nlwa.ys eontinuous with the X?SSXB material and was, therefore, host related. The host-related antigen may correspond to the anti-host activity measured in HI and CF testd, This is consistent with the observation of Berry and Almeida (1968) in IE tests, probably were the results of electrophoretic breakdown of the virus spikes; indeed, IE tests performed with bromelintreated (despilled) particles did not exhibit these lines. In these tests only a single arc developed, and this represented a structure with considerably greater electrophoretic mobility than was exhibited by whole virus. Such observations suggest the antigens reactive in the ID or IE tests are probably associated with the virion surface. At least one or two additional preeipitin lines might be expected under con&t&s of compl&e v3~ disruption and release of internal components. Indeed tbis would be suspected b?-oi:r studies with PAGE.\n\nA minimum of six polypeptide componer3s were demonstrated under the described CGEditions of solubilising and examining purified virus by PAGE. These components ranged in molecular weight from 15,000 to \"rS1,O@hB daltons. However, these molecular w?rright ET AL. figures can only be considered as approximations since the reliability of the PAGE procedure when used for molecular weight determinations is greatest for proteins in the range of 15,000-165,000 MW and since several sources of error are inherent in the PAGE technique. The six or possibly seven bands found in acrylamide gels most likely represented distinct polypeptides and not oligomers because the inclusion of 1.0 M urea as a hydrogen bond-breaking agent in the solubilizing mixture and the use of heat at 100' would minimize protein aggregation.\n\nThe classification of the polypeptides as glyco-or glycolipoproteins must be considered as tentative at this point, since the ,chemical nature of these complexes cannot be precisely defined by differential staining techniques. The use of more sensitive procedures to confirm the nature of these polypeptides awaits the successful adaptation of OC 43 coronavirus to growth in tissue culture systems.\n\nBy indirect methods several of these polypeptides can be related to virus structural components. Glycopolypeptides No. 2 (MW 104,000) and No. 6 (MW 15,000) which together constituted 22 % of virus protein were associated with the surface projections. Because of its lipid content, one might speculate that the high molecular weight glycolipopolypeptide (No. 1) representing 13 % of the total protein may be the outermost layer of the three-layered envelope.\n\nThe remaining polypeptides are not readily localized. Glycopolypeptide\n\nNo. 3, representing 23 % of the total virus protein, polypeptide No. 5, representing 26 %, and polypeptide No. 4, a relatively low MW (47,000 daltons) protein making up 16 % of the protein are still unaccounted for. These proteins may comprise the remaining two layers of the virus membrane and the protein moiety of the RNP, respectively. The faint band (approximately 165,000 daltons) occasionally observed in acrylamide gels could not represent more than 2% of total virus, and may not be structural protein. In any event, the presence of a minimum of six or seven polypeptides in a virus with a molecular weight of 112 million suggests a highly complex structural organization."}
