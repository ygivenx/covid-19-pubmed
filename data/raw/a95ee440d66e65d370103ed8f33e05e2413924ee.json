{"title": "Articles Tropism and innate host responses of a novel avian infl uenza A H7N9 virus: an analysis of ex-vivo and in-vitro cultures of the human respiratory tract", "body": "As of July 7, 2013, 132 laboratory-confi rmed human infections with a novel infl uenza A H7N9 virus have been reported from ten provinces and municipalities in China by the National Health and Family Planning Commission, and one additional case has been reported from Taipei Centres for Disease Control. There have been 43 deaths so far. 1, 2 The source of human infection appears to be poultry. 1, [3] [4] [5] There is so far no evidence of sustained humanto-human transmission within the community. Genetic analysis of these viruses revealed that all eight gene segments were of avian origin; six internal gene segments were derived from avian infl uenza A H9N2 viruses found in poultry in Asia, and the haemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes were derived from infl uenza viruses circulating in ducks and wild birds, respectively. 1 Human infections with other H7 infl uenza viruses (H7N2, H7N3, and H7N7) have previously been reported in the Netherlands, Canada, USA, and UK 6 in association with outbreaks in poultry and resulted in conjunctivitis with mild upper respiratory symptoms. However, there was one fatal case in the Netherlands. 6, 7 Cytokine dysregulation contributes to the pathogenesis of human disease caused by highly pathogenic avian infl uenza A H5N1 as well as the 1918 pandemic H1N1 viruses. [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] By comparison with seasonal infl uenza viruses, some highly pathogenic avian infl uenza H5N1 viruses induced higher concentrations of proinfl ammatory cytokines from human alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages. 8, 9, [11] [12] [13] We previously used ex-vivo cultures of human conjunctiva, nasopharynx, tonsil, bronchus and lung to investigate infl uenza 14, 15 and coronavirus tropism 16 and used in-vitro cultures of polarised primary human alveolar epithelial cells and peripheral blood monocyte derived macrophages to compare innate immune responses elicited by diff erent infl uenza viruses. 8, 9, 12, 13 In this study, we used these ex-vivo and in-vitro models of cultured human tissues and cells to compare the virus tropism and host innate immune responses of the novel A H7N9 infl uenza virus with that of the pandemic H1N1 virus, highly pathogenic avian infl uenza H5N1 and H7N7 viruses, and a low pathogenic duck H7N9 virus.\n\nWe used avian infl uenza A H7N9 viruses, A/ Shanghai/1/2013 (Sh1/H7N9) and A/Shanghai/2/2013 (Sh2/H7N9); a duck H7N9 virus, A/Duck/Jiangxi/ 3286/ 2009 (duck/H7N9), with a diff erent genetic derivation from the two H7N9 viruses as a control; a highly pathogenic avian infl uenza H7N7 virus isolated from a human patient with fatal disease, A/Netherlands/219/2003 (NL/219/H7N7); a highly pathogenic avian infl uenza H5N1 virus isolated from a fatal human infection, A/Hong Kong/483/1997 (H5N1); and a 2009 pandemic infl uenza virus, A/California/07/2009 (H1N1pdm). See appendix for further details. All experiments were done in a biosafety level 3 facility and the use of human tissues had been previously approved by the local institutional review board.\n\nFresh bronchus, lung, nasopharynx, and tonsil tissues were obtained from patients aged 51 to 65 years undergoing elective surgery in Hong Kong and were removed as part of clinical care but surplus for routine diagnostic requirements as detailed previously. [14] [15] [16] Methods of culture, infection, and analysis are detailed in the appendix.\n\nThe eff ect of desialylation of turkey red blood cells on virus haemagglutination was compared (appendix). Sialidase DAS181 (NexBio, San Diego, CA, USA), which removes both \u03b1-2,3-linked and \u03b1-2,6-linked sialic acids, and Sialidase S (Prozyme, Hayward, CA, USA), which removes only \u03b1-2,3-linked sialic acids, were compared with untreated turkey red blood cells as controls.\n\nTo assess innate immune responses, primary human pneumocytes and peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages were derived and used for infection with infl uenza virus as previously described. 8, 9 They were \n\nSee Online for appendix infected with infl uenza A viruses at a multiplicity of infection of two. The primers and methods used for these assays have been reported previously 8, 9, 14, 16 and detailed methods for quantifi cation of cytokine mRNA protein are available in the appendix.\n\nExperiments with the human ex-vivo cultures and in-vitro cultures of macrophages and pneumocytes were done independently with at least three diff erent donors, each in duplicate. Results shown in fi gures are the calculated mean and SEM. Mock infected tissues served as negative controls. The diff erences in log 10 transformed viral titres and quantitative cytokine and chemokine mRNAs between viruses and over time were compared with two-way ANOVA followed by a Bonferroni multiple-comparison test. Diff erences were deemed signifi cant at p<0\u00b705.\n\nThe sponsors had no role in study design, data collection, analysis, or interpretation, or in the writing of the report. JSMP, YG, and JMN had full access to all data in the study and had fi nal responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.\n\nThe human A H7N9 viruses Sh1/H7N9 and Sh2/H7N9 replicated effi ciently in ex-vivo cultures of the human bronchus and lung (fi gure 1). Sh1/H7N9 and Sh2/ H7N9 viruses replicated similarly in bronchus, but Sh1/H7N9 replicated to signifi cantly higher titres than Sh2/H7N9 in the lung. Sh1/H7N9 and Sh2/H7N9 virus titres in the bronchus and lung were higher than those observed with H5N1 virus. Sh1/H7N9 and Sh2/H7N9 virus titres in bronchus were similar to that observed with the H1N1pdm virus, but Sh1/H7N9 replicated to higher titres in the lung. Sh1/H7N9 replicated to higher titres than NL/219/H7N7 virus, and NL/219/H7N7 replicated to higher titres than H5N1 virus, in bronchus and lung. Limited experimental replicates of ex-vivo nasopharyngeal (n=2) and tonsil (n=1) cultures restrict statistical analysis, but there was a trend suggesting productive replication of Sh1/H7N9 and Sh2/H7N9 in nasopharynx (appendix). Duck/H7N9 failed to replicate in any of these tissues. Sh2/H7N9 replicated in nasopharyngeal tissues at 33\u00b0C (appendix). Immunohistochemistry showed that Sh1/H7N9 and Sh2/H7N9 viruses extensively infected bronchial epithelium, infecting both ciliated and non-ciliated bronchial epithelial cells (fi gure 2C, E), the extent of infection being greater than that seen with H5N1 (fi gure 2G) and other avian viruses (table 1). In the lung, Sh1/H7N9 and Sh2/H7N9 infected mainly type II pneumocytes (fi gure 3) and alveolar macrophages (fi gure 3 and appendix). There was no evidence of infection of vascular endothelium in the blood vessels of the lung. The duck/H7N9 virus, which diff ers in its genetic origin from the viruses causing the current human H7N9 outbreak, failed to infect or replicate in any of the human tissues tested, with the exception of occasional cells expressing viral antigen seen in the bronchial epithelium (table 1) . Treatment of turkey red blood cells with a sialidase that specifi cally cleaves the \u03b1-2,3-linked sialic acid with galactose did not have any eff ect on haemagglutination of either Sh1/H7N9 or Sh2/H7N9, whereas it completely abolished haemagglutination of H5N1 virus (table 2) . As a control, DAS181, a sialidase that cleaves both the \u03b1-2,3 and \u03b1-2,6 links of sialic acid, abolished the haemagglutination of human and avian infl uenza viruses including that of Sh1/H7N9 and Sh2/H7N9.\n\nIn human peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages, infl uenza viral matrix ( . In parallel, H5N1 virus elicited more CCL5 and TNF\u03b1 protein secretion compared with H1N1pdm (fi gure 5). Overall, the induction of proinfl ammatory cytokines by Sh1/H7N9 or Sh2/H7N9 appeared to be intermediate between those induced by H5N1 and H1N1pdm viruses. Sh1/H7N9 and Sh2/H7N9 viruses both induced signifi cantly higher concentrations of CCL5 and CXCL10 mRNA than did H1N1pdm virus, but less interferon \u03b2 and TNF\u03b1 compared with H5N1 (fi gure 4).\n\nThe mRNA expression of genes related to interferon and interferon receptor signalling in human peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages after Sh1/H7N9, Sh2/H7N9, H5N1, and H1N1pdm virus infection was investigated by cDNA PCR array and expressed as foldchange over mock infected cells (appendix). Only genes that were three or more fold changes overexpressed or underexpressed relative to H1N1pdm were noted. The interferon stimulated genes MX1, ISG15, IFI35, IFI44, IFIH1, and OAS1 were eff ectively upregulated by Sh1/H7N9 and Sh2/H7N9 infections (data not shown). Expression of IL20RB, IFNAR1, IL20RA, IL22RA2, IL2RB, IL9R, and IRF4 were overexpressed by either Sh1/H7N9 or Sh2/H7N9 infection compared with H1N1pdm infection. IL10RB and IL4R were more downregulated by Sh1/H7N9 or Sh2/H7N9 compared with H1N1pdm.\n\nIn primary human pneumocytes, replication of Sh1/ H7N9 and Sh2/H7N9 viruses (multiplicity of infection of two) were similar, as assessed by viral M-gene quantitation at 1, 6, and 24 h after infection, whereas Sh2/H7N9 had a signifi cantly higher M-gene level compared with H5N1 (p=0\u00b705) and H1N1pdm (p=0\u00b70346) at 24 h after infection (fi gure 6A). As expected, H5N1 virus induced signifi cantly more levels of interferon \u03b2, interleukin 29, CCL4, CCL5, and CXCL10 mRNA than did H1N1pdm virus infection. Sh1/H7N9 and/or Sh2/ H7N9 elicited signifi cantly more interferon \u03b2, interleukin 29, CCL5, and CXCL10 mRNA than did H1N1pdm virus infection. However, Sh1/H7N9 and Sh2/H7N9 viruses both elicited less interferon \u03b2, interleukin 29, and CCL5 mRNA than did H5N1 virus (fi gure 6). In virusinfected cell supernatants, H5N1 virus induced signifi cantly more CCL5 protein than did H1N1pdm, Sh1/H7N9, and Sh2/H7N9 viruses and more CXCL10 protein than did H1N1pdm (fi gure 7).\n\nSh1/H7N9 and Sh2/H7N9 viruses replicated effi ciently in ex-vivo cultures of human bronchus and lung with The reciprocal of the haemagglutination titre is denoted. Three independent experiments were done with identical results. Immunohistochemistry of ex-vivo cultures of the human bronchus showed Sh1/H7N9 and Sh2/H7N9 virus infection of both ciliated and non-ciliated epithelial cells. H5N1 only led to limited infection in the human bronchus with infection restricted to ciliated bronchial epithelial cells. In the alveoli, H7N9-infected cells were mainly type II pneumocytes and macrophages. Type II alveolar epithelial cells are important in producing surfactant proteins A and D and are crucial in reconstituting damaged type I alveolar epithelium. Loss of type II pneumocytes would lead to impairment of the repair processes after alveolar damage. The tropism of Sh1/H7N9 and Sh2/H7N9 infection in the alveoli is similar to that seen with H5N1 infection, 17 but the extent of infection of the bronchus and lung is signifi cantly greater than that seen with H5N1. Although individual genetic and environmental variability might result in diverse phenotypes, that three separate donors yielded very similar trends is interesting (data not shown). Future work needs to address whether genetic (eg, IFITM3) or other host factors play a part in susceptibility to infection of ex-vivo human respiratory cultures.\n\nSh1/H7N9 and Sh2/H7N9 viruses diff er in aminoacid residues Gln226Leu, Ser138Ala, and Gly186Val (H7/H3 numbering) in haemagglutinin, which are expected to enhance binding of Sh2/H7N9 to \u03b1-2,6 glycans found in the human upper airways. 4 However, Sh1/H7N9 and Sh2/H7N9 infect human bronchus with similar effi ciency. A sialidase specifi c for cleaving the \u03b1-2,3 glycosidic abolished the haemagglutination of turkey red blood cells by H5N1 virus, but did not aff ect haemagglutination by Sh1/H7N9 or Sh2/H7N9 viruses suggesting that both Sh1/H7N9 and Sh2/H7N9 predominantly bind \u03b1-2,6 glycans, irrespective of diff erences in aminoacid residues Gln226Leu, Ser138Ala, and Gly186Val of haemagglutinin. Both Sh1/ H7N9 and Sh2/H7N9 have lost a glycosylation site (Thy160Ala) in the 150-loop of haemagglutinin that is known to result in increased affi nity for binding \u03b1-2,6linked glycans in H5N1 viruses. 4 By contrast, others have reported that a recombinant Sh2/H7N9-like virus haemagglutinin bound poorly to human trachea and a Gly228Ser aminoacid change was needed to confer improved binding to the human upper airways. 18 Recombinant viral haemagglutinin might not accurately refl ect haemagglutinin binding of native virions where multivalent trimeric haemagglutinin is present together with neuraminidase and fails to take into account any Recent mass spectrometric data have shown that the bronchus contains sialylated \u03b1-2,3 glycans, 19 explaining its infection by avian viruses (H5N1 and H7N7) whose glycan array profi les indicate predominant \u03b1-2,3 receptor binding. Receptor binding and structural analysis of Sh2/H7N9-like virus haemagglutinin shows effi cient binding of both \u03b1-2,3 and \u03b1-2,6 receptors. 20 The functional changes in receptor binding and PB2 Glu627Lys are some of the key functional changes identifi ed by Herfst and colleagues 21 in 2012 to be important in adapting an avian H5N1 virus towards transmission in mammals. Since A/Hong Kong/483/97 (H5N1) virus also has lysine at position 627 in PB2, the effi cient replication of H7N9 viruses in human ex-vivo cultures of the bronchus is unlikely to be explained solely on this basis.\n\nAutopsy data for the lung would provide useful data to understand the pathogenesis of human A H7N9 disease. However, autopsy data usually only provide information about lung pathology at late stages of the illness and thus fail to provide insights into virus tropism in the early stages of infection. Thus data from experimental infection of ex-vivo cultures of the respiratory tract provide unique insights into virus tropism and pathogenesis. Reported patients with H7N9 disease have been older than those with human infections with avian H5N1 or H9N2 viruses, and severe disease appears to be more common with increasing age. 3 The biological basis for this unusual epidemiological pattern needs to be understood because it diff ers from that seen in individuals infected with H5N1. Whether milder cases in young people are unrecognised, thereby skewing the case-fatality ratio as well as the age distribution, is unclear. Paediatric lung and bronchial tissues diff er from adult tissues in the balance of sialylated \u03b1-2,3 and \u03b1-2,6 glycans, 19 and this factor might contribute to the increased disease severity with increasing age. However, using similar techniques we found that Sh1/H7N9 and Sh2/ H7N9 viruses effi ciently infected ex-vivo lung from a 1-year-old child (data not shown). Chronic lung disease increases numbers of type II pneumocytes (the target cells for infl uenza viruses) and might contribute to an increased disease severity compared with younger, healthier individuals. 22 Dysregulation of proinfl ammatory innate immune responses by highly pathogenic avian infl uenza H5N1 virus contributed to the unusual severity of human H5N1 disease and investigation of whether Sh1 or Sh2/H7N9 virus infections lead to exaggerated proinfl ammatory innate immune responses was relevant. Since ex-vivo cultures are heterogeneous in cell type and susceptibility to virus and the infecting dose cannot be precisely controlled, we chose to compare innate immune responses to H7N9 infection with that of highly pathogenic avian infl uenza H5N1 and H1N1pdm viruses in well defi ned primary human macrophages and alveolar epithelial cells. By comparison with H5N1 virus (a high cytokine-inducing virus) and H1N1pdm virus (a low cytokine-inducing virus), Sh1/H7N9 and Sh2/H7N9 appear to have an intermediate phenotype in their intrinsic capacity to induce proinfl ammatory cytokines such as CCL5 and TNF\u03b1. The expression of interferon stimulated genes (eg, MX1, ISG15) did not appear to be impaired. Lungs and serum of mice experimentally infected with Sh2/H7N9 also had lower concentrations of proinfl ammatory chemokines and cytokines compared with those of H5N1-infected mice. 23 In a patient with mild disease and one with severe disease in whom cytokine concentrations were studied, there was no diff erence in proinfl ammatory cytokines in serum. However, the patient who died had high serum concentrations of the antiinfl ammatory cytokine serum interleukin 10. 5 Raised plasma or lung cytokine concentration might be secondary to more severe pathology in severely ill patients, 24 or secondary to increased replication competence of a virus rather than being the intrinsic cause of such pathology. Therefore, the experiments we have described in which similar virus infecting doses of diff erent viruses are compared for their capacity for cytokine induction provides important data to defi ne the intrinsic viral capacity for proinfl ammatory cytokine induction, which might be of relevance for pathogenesis and therapy. From our fi ndings, Sh2/H7N9-like viruses appear to be intrinsically more potent inducers of the proinfl ammatory cytokine responses than are H1N1pdm viruses, but less so than H5N1 viruses. Thus, proinfl ammatory cytokine responses might contribute in part to the severity of human H7N9 disease, but the unusual tissue tropism of this virus for human bronchus and lung and attendant direct viral cytopathology probably has a more important role in pathogenesis, as was seen with the novel Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. 16 Our fi ndings suggest that Sh2/H7N9-like avian viruses are exceptionally fi t to infect mammalian species including human beings. Ferrets experimentally infected with Sh2/H7N9 showed effi cient virus replication in the respiratory tract with ineffi cient ferret-to-ferret transmission by airborne droplets. 25 Although no sustained human-to-human transmission has been noted to date, the effi cient replication of these H7N9 viruses in the human respiratory tract and the detection (albeit ineffi cient) of ferret-to-ferret transmission by the airborne route by these viruses without previous adaptation increases the pandemic concern associated with these viruses.\n\nMCWC contributed to study design and coordination, analysis and interpretation of results, experiments, and writing of the report.
