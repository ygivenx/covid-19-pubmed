{"title": "Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Quasispecies That Include Homologues of Human Isolates Revealed through Whole-Genome Analysis and Virus Cultured from Dromedary Camels in Saudi Arabia", "body": "Total nucleic acids from nasal swab, rectal swab or cell culture supernatant samples were extracted on a QiaCube with Cador reagent kits (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Superscript III and random hexamer primers were used to generate cDNA preparations (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Second-strand cDNA synthesis for high-throughput sequencing was carried out by random primer extension with Klenow enzyme (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA).\n\nHigh-throughput sequencing was performed in parallel on random-primed cDNA preparations and MERS-CoV-enriched PCR product pools. To enrich for MERS-CoV sequences from total nucleic acid extracts, PCR amplifications employing a set of overlapping PCR primers spanning the whole genome in approximately 2.0- to 2.5-kb fragments were performed as described (15). PCR products were pooled and sequenced on both the Ion Torrent and Illumina platforms.\n\nSequencing on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) resulted in an average of approximately 20 to 50 million reads per sample. cDNA preparations were sheared (E210 sonicator; Covaris, Woburn, MA, USA) for an average fragment size of 200 bp and added to Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) for purification, and libraries were prepared with Kapa high-throughput library preparation kits (Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, MA, USA). Sequencing was performed using a read length of 100 nt, followed by an independent read of the 6-nt bar code. Samples were demultiplexed using Illumina-supplied CASAVA software and exported as FastQ files. More than 90% of Illumina reads passed the Q30 filter. Demultiplexed FastQ files were mapped against GenBank scaffolds (KF600620 and KF186567) with Bowtie 2 mapper 2.0.6 (http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net [16]). Sequencing on the Ion Torrent PGM platform was performed with Ion PGM Sequencing 200 kits on Ion 318 chips (Life Technologies), yielding on average 1.5 to 2.5 million reads per sample with a mean length of approximately 166 nt. cDNA preparations were sheared (Ion Shear Plus kit; Life Technologies) for an average fragment size of 200 bp and added to Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) for purification, libraries were prepared with Kapa library preparation/Ion Torrent series kits (Kapa), and emulsion PCR was performed with Ion PGM Template OT2 200 kits (Life Technologies). Ion Torrent reads were demultiplexed and exported as FastQ files by the Ion Torrent PGM software. After bar code and adaptor trimming, length filtering, masking of low-complexity regions, and subtraction of ribosomal and host sequences, reads were mapped as described for Illumina data. Consensus sequences from mapping assemblies were generated by using SAMtools/BCFtools 0.1.19 software (http://samtools.sourceforge.net [17]).\n\nBased on available sequence information, a set of 25 nested consensus primer sets were designed to generate overlapping PCR products of approximately 1.3 kb that comprise the full genome (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). Random-primed cDNA was PCR amplified with individual primer pairs and AmpliTaq Gold (Life Technologies). The PCR products were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and QIAquick gel extraction kits (Qiagen) and subsequently sequenced on both strands by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (GeneWiz, South Plainfield, NJ, USA). Products from selected PCRs were also cloned into pGEM-T Easy plasmid vector (Life Technologies), and 16 individual clones were dideoxy sequenced in order to assess clonal sequence diversity.\n\nQuantitative real-time PCR used OneStep Real-Time qPCR buffer (Life Technologies) and UpE primer/probes (18).\n\nOne hundred fifty microliters of nasal swab in universal virus transport medium (Becton, Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) was filtered (0.45 \u03bcm; Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), and the filtrate was inoculated on Vero E6 cells grown to semiconfluence in T25 culture flasks with Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM)-10% fetal calf serum. The inoculum was removed after 2.5 h, cells were gently rinsed, and fresh medium was added (T-0). Supernatant was tested for MERS-CoV by quantitative real-time PCR after 48 h (T-48), and supernatant as well as cell homogenate harvested at 66 h postinfection (T-66).\n\nSequence data were analyzed using software packages Geneious (Biomatters, Auckland, New Zealand), MEGA (http://www.megasoftware.net [19]), and Wisconsin GCG (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA). Phylogenetic analysis was performed by the neighbor-joining method implemented in MEGA 5.2, running 1,000 pseudoreplicate analyses to assess statistical support.\n\nFull genomic sequences of MERS-CoV from DC were deposited in GenBank under the indicated accession numbers: samples KSA-363-Taif-21, KJ713298; KSA-378-Taif-36, KJ713296; KSA-376-Taif-34, KJ713299; KSA-503-Taif-45, KJ713297; and KSA-505-Taif-47, KJ713295."}
