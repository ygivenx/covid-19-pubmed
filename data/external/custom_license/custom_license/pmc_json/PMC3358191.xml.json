HCWs had slightly higher rates of seropositivity than nonclinical staff; however, this difference was not statistically significant. Our data are supported by results of another recent study, which found that being a HCW was not a risk factor for serologically confirmed seasonal influenza virus infection and that the risk of HCWs acquiring influenza was more strongly associated with household than workplace exposure (12). That study found a seroconversion rate of 11.2% in HCWs and 10.3% in non-HCWs. However, it examined only doctors and nurses, whereas our study included other types of frontline HCWs. Another study reported a seroprevalence for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 of 26.7% in HCWs, which was not significantly different from the seroprevalence of the general population (13). Neither of these studies examined use of PPE.",

However, results of other studies examining the relationship between seroprevalence and increasing age are conflicting (15\u201318). Immune mechanisms other than type-specific antibodies may be providing protection for older participants. Other possibilities are that older persons have older children who may be less likely to acquire or transmit influenza or that older participants were more conscientious with respiratory etiquette and hand hygiene; attempts to measure these factors were not included in this study.",

Furthermore, at least as many cases of confirmed pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza were seen at hospital 2 as were seen at the other hospitals (Table 1). Factors such as reported compliance with PPE, were adjusted for in the multivariable analysis to reduce the effect of hospital type on influenza risk.

Miller et al. reported that 89.1% of participants with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 had an antibody titer of >32 three weeks after infection, although a baseline serum sample was not taken; therefore, seroconversion could not be demonstrated (17). None of the participants with positive PCR results reported taking NIs, and all had serum samples taken >2 weeks after the positive nose swab specimen, allowing sufficient time for seroconversion. Our results are likely to be true positives, as all swabs were only taken when patients were symptomatic. Previously, virus isolation has been the gold standard for influenza detection but RT-PCR is now considered to be more sensitive and specific. A previous study by some of the current authors has shown that seroconversion occurs in 80%\u201390% of serum samples if they are tested a sufficient time after infection (confirmed by RT-PCR) (19). Nasal swabs are a relatively peripheral type of sample (20). If viral load is low in the nose, the sample may be insufficient as an antigenic stimulus to induce a detectable level of seroconversion in the serum. This may be the explanation for the lack of seroconversion seen in some PCR-positive cases in this study.",

This is not ideal, because some participants may have had preexisting cross-reactive antibodies, as reported by others (15,16). However, this cross-reactivity has been most commonly found in older persons >65 years of age, a population which was underrepresented in our study. The explanation given for presence of cross-reactive antibodies in older persons has been past exposure to other antigenically similar viruses or a lifetime exposure to influenza A virus (17). Because this exposure could not have occurred in our younger study participants (median age 38 years) and serum samples were collected toward the end of the pandemic wave when many would have already been exposed, reactivity likely was specific to pandemic (H1N1) 2009. These factors support the use of a single antibody measurement for diagnosis.",

This is a particular problem potentially for recall of exposures (e.g., to others with influenza or for use of PPE). However, many of the predictor variables were not subject to recall bias (e.g., clinical or nonclinical status, work place, age, gender, occupation, and number of children in the household). In addition, in order to influence the results, the 2 exposure groups would have had to exhibit differential recall. Although it could be postulated that HCWs may have perceived that they were at greater risk for exposure and may have therefore been more conscientious when filling out questionnaires, we believe that because of the large amount of public awareness of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 at that time, it is unlikely that this group would have been more conscientious than the nonclinical group.",
