Although chlamydia is treatable with antibiotics, a lack of obvious symptoms complicates diagnosis. Now, a cheap dipstick test called 'Firstburst', which gives a result 'on-the-spot' in less than 25 minutes, has been developed. Bonus features of the test are its simplicity of use and stability at high temperatures. Wellcome Trust",

After training for 4\u20136 months, the rats can correctly identify samples that contain Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of the disease. Project director Bart Weetjens has now obtained funding to train a team of 400 'sniffer rats'. Rats can analyse more than 100 samples in just 30 minutes compared with the 20 samples per day that a trained scientist can tackle. Lives could be saved because early TB detection is essential for effective treatment. SciDevNet",

            "text": "A major hurdle to vaccination for meningitis is the existence of multiple strains of bacteria (known as groups A, B and C) that can cause the disease. An engineered meningococcal strain that provides protection in mice against all three groups of meningococcal bacteria has now been developed. Meningitis is fatal in 1 in 10 infected children in the United Kingdom and many survivors are left severely handicapped. Vaccines presently in use don't protect against all three strains. So, this breakthrough could be the first step towards a single vaccine for humans. BBC",

Although the now-recovered patient hasn't been linked to any known SARS source, the authorities are slaughtering civet cats, because tests on a gene from the virus that infected the patient showed similarities to a coronavirus found in civets.

More than twenty nations responded by banning all US beef imports. 450 calves from a herd containing the sole offspring of the infected cow have since been culled. Genetic tests confirmed that the infected cow was born in Canada before August 1997 \u2014 when both countries banned the practice of using cattle feed that contained parts of cattle and sheep \u2014 so the United States could now retain BSE-free status. Stanley Prusiner, who won the Nobel prize for discovering prions, previously voiced concerns about the failure of the US Department of Agriculture to test enough cows to detect BSE. Only about 10% of the \u223c200,000 downer cattle slaughtered in 2003 were tested, even though an inability to walk is a known symptom of BSE. Because 90% of beef consumption is domestic, pressure could mount to improve the testing programme. Reuters",
