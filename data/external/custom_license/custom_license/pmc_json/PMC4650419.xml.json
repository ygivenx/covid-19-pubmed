            "text": "Since September 2012, 1 368 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection by the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have officially been reported to World Health Organization as of 17 July 2015, including at least 490 related deaths with a fatality rate of \u223c35.8% (http://www.who.int/csr/don/17-july-2015-mers-korea/en/). The symptoms caused by MERS-CoV infection, including fever, cough and shortness of breath1,2, are very similar to those caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SRAS-CoV), which had a fatality rate of \u223c10% during its epidemic in 2002-20033. In contrast to SARS-CoV, which was highly contagious3, MERS-CoV remains rather limited in its transmissibility. Nevertheless, there is accumulating evidence showing person-to-person transmission of the virus among close contacts4,5. Between May and June 2015, there was an outbreak of MERS-CoV infection with a considerable number of cases in the Republic of Korea6. As of 21 July 2015, 186 MERS cases, including one of the secondary infected cases that had travelled to Guangdong province of China had been confirmed and 36 deaths were caused (http://www.wpro.who.int/outbreaks_emergencies/wpro_coronavirus/en/). In addition, there have also been cases confirmed in Thailand, Philippines, Saudi Arabia and United Arab during this period (http://www.who.int/csr/don/archive/year/2015/en/). This raises a long-term concern that MERS-CoV could become pandemic in the future. It is therefore an urgent need to develop effective measures to counter its threat to global public health. However, there are neither vaccines nor antiviral therapeutics available to prevent or treat MERS thus far.",

In coronaviruses, the viral component most frequently targeted by antibodies is the surface-located envelope spike (S) glycoprotein, which is normally cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits to mediate receptor recognition and membrane fusion, respectively7,8,9,10. Accordingly, MERS-CoV enters into target cells initially through the interaction of its S1 subunit with the cellular receptor human CD26 (hCD26, also known as dipeptidyl peptidase 4, DPP4)11 and subsequently by fusion between the viral envelope and the host cell lipid bilayer mediated by the S2 subunit8,9,11,12. We and others previously dissected the entry process of MERS-CoV by presenting the structure of the S1 receptor-binding domain (RBD) in complex with hCD267,13,14 and the atomic structure of the S2 fusion core15,16. These structural studies clearly showed that the RBD of MERS-CoV (MERS-RBD), which is composed of a core subdomain and an external subdomain, directly interacts with the receptor via its external region7,13,14. Thus, disrupting the interaction between MERS-RBD and hCD26 by mAbs could be a useful therapy for MERS-CoV infection.",

In addition, two groups recently reported the isolation of human mAbs with potent neutralizing activities from the B-cell repertoire of healthy donors20,21 and one group utilized the VelocImmune technology and VelociGene technology to rapidly develop fully human neutralizing mAbs against MERS-CoV22. All the mAbs targeted the RBD region of the MERS-CoV S for neutralization. These results indicate that MERS-RBD, which behaves as a well-defined protein entity, could be used as a useful immunogen for neutralizing mAb production.

We subsequently solved the structure of 4C2 bound to MERS-RBD, from which the neutralizing determinant was structurally delineated at the atomic level. Furthermore, we also humanized 4C2 based on the solved structure, and demonstrated that the resultant humanized antibody exhibits similar neutralizing activity and biochemical characters to the parental mouse antibody. Finally the humanized mAb was tested in vivo and was shown to significantly reduce the virus titers in MERS-CoV-infected mice.",

Their close proximity led to strong steric clashes in at least two regions. One is related to the CDR2 loop of the 4C2 heavy chain which collides with the N229-linked carbohydrate moiety in the receptor, while the other lies in the D/E loop of the heavy chain V-domain, bumping into the loop preceding the extended \u03b21-strand of the hCD26 propeller blade IV (Figure 2B). We also compared the footprints of 4C2 and hCD26 in MERS-RBD by characterizing the interface residues located within 4.5 \u00c5 distance from the bound antibody or receptor. Though most of the amino acids recognized by 4C2 are distinct from those interacting with hCD26, five residues, including W535, E536, D539, Y540 and R542, overlapped in the two footprints (Figure 2B). Hence, 4C2 could interfere with MERS-RBD/hCD26 interaction by both presenting strong steric hindrance and competing for the hCD26-interface residues, thereby neutralizing the virus infection (Figure 2C).",

In the heavy chain, CDR1 (HCDR1) contributes to epitope binding by stacking residues S31-T33 against amino acids W535, D539, Y540 and R542 in MERS-RBD (Figure 3A). Nevertheless, the interaction at this site is rather limited, with only a moderate number of van der waals (vdw) contacts (Table 3). In contrast, both CDR2 and CDR3 of the heavy chain (HCDR2 and HCDR3) engage the viral ligand in a much broader manner by providing multiple (76 for HCDR2 and 59 for HCDR3, Table 3) vdw and several (3 for HCDR2 and 4 for HCDR3, Figure 3B and 3C) H-bond interactions. The former includes residues T50, S52-Y57 and Y59, contacting mainly MERS-RBD K496, W535-E536 and D539 (Figure 3B), while the latter involves D99-D102 and D104 of the antibody, interacting with the ligand residues V527-S532, W535, Y540 and K543 (Figure 3C). As for the light chain, both CDR1 and CDR2 (LCDR1 and LCDR2) were more important than CDR3 (LCDR3) for epitope recognition, contrasting with the heavy chain, which relied mostly on the HCDR2 and 3 for ligand engagement. A total of 40 and 69 vdw contacts (Table 3) were individually contributed by LCDR1 and LCDR2, respectively, involving D28, Y32, Y49-Y50, R53 and H55-S56 of the antibody and Y397-N398, K400, P525, V527-S532 and K543-Q544 of the viral ligand (Figure 3D and 3E). LCDR3, however, only provided 18 vdw interactions (Table 3) by stacking 4C2 residues G91-N92, L94 and R96 against MERS-RBD amino acids S532 and W535 (Figure 3F).

We therefore sought to humanize the antibody, while at the same time maintaining its capacity to bind to MERS-RBD. With this detailed information about binding in hand, we tailored our humanization strategy for the antibody into two aspects: first, finding the human antibody with highest sequence identity to 4C2, and second, preserving all the 4C2 interface residues. Using BLAST, the anti-plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein 3 (aPFP3; Genbank accession number: AAX82494.1), which exhibits a sequence identity of 86.7% to the heavy chain variable domain of our antibody, was selected as the template for 4C2 humanization. The subsequent humanized sequence thereby comprises all the scaffold residues of aPFP3 and the amino acids of 4C2 CDRs. To maintain the binding potency to MERS-RBD, the interface residues flanking CDR2 of the light chain, including R53, H55 and S56, were also swapped into the humanized antibody. In addition, the 4C2 residues, e.g., S30, T51, S52 and T93 of the light chain, which were located in the middle of the CDR loops and should therefore play a role in maintaining a proper fold for ligand recognition, were also preserved, whereas T97 of the heavy chain, which resides at the end of the F strand and is thereby unlikely to affect the conformation of the adjacent CDR3 loop, was replaced with the equivalent human residue (Figure 3G).",

For both the phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and the irrelevant antibody (using a chimeric 13C6 antibody targeting Ebola virus GP as an iso-antibody control) groups, the viral load plateaued at \u223c106 PFU/g tissue at 3 dpi and then decreased to \u223c104PFU/g tissue at 3 dpi and then decreased to \u223c104 PFU/g tissue at 5 dpi (Figure 4E and 4F). As a protection test, pre- and post-infection treatment of mice with 4C2h both significantly abated the virus titers in lung. In each case, the viral load decreased by \u223c2 orders of magnitude to \u223c104.5 PFU/g tissue at 3 dpi and to lower than 102 (which is below the limit of detection) PFU/g tissue at 5 dpi (Figure 4E and 4F).

Studies in rhesus macaques have shown that combination of ribavirin and interferon \u03b1-2b are effective as both primary treatment and prophylaxis against MERS-CoV24. Nevertheless, this combination strategy was only tested in 20 patients and has not been investigated in any large randomized clinical trial25. With neither effective drugs nor vaccines to treat or prevent MERS-CoV infection, neutralizing antibodies, which have been shown in various virus infection and cancer therapies26,27,28 to have remarkable capacities for clinical applications, especially in recent work on Ebola disease treatment with mAb cocktails29, could represent an important strategic reserve to prepare for a potential pandemic. In this study, we isolated and characterized two mouse neutralizing mAbs, 4C2 and 2E6, which exhibit one to two digit nanomolar ND50 against MERS-CoV infection assessed using pseudotyped and infectious viruses. Both mAbs were demonstrated to competitively inhibit the binding of hCD26 to MERS-RBD, thereby disrupting virus/receptor interactions. We further dissected the epitope-recognition basis of 4C2 by determining the structure of antibody bound with MERS-RBD and humanized the antibody by preserving all interface residues. Furthermore, the protective efficacies of the humanized mAbs were validated in vivo. Our results hereby contribute to global efforts to control MERS-CoV infection and transmission by providing one well-characterized neutralizing mAb.",

This conformational epitope is composed of MERS-RBD residues Y397-N398, K400, L495-K496, P525, V527-S532, W535-E536, and D539-Q544 (Figure 3 and Table 4). It is interesting that this region is largely different from the receptor-binding interface engaging hCD26 (Figure 2), though several interface residues are indeed shared by the antibody and the receptor. The competitive inhibition of receptor binding by 4C2 is therefore largely attributed to the steric hindrance created between 4C2 and hCD26 upon antibody engagement, especially that between the antibody heavy chain CDR2 and the N229-linked carbohydrates of the receptor. This mechanism seems to separate our antibody from those isolated by Tang et al.20 from the nonimmune human Ab-phage library. The major epitope region for those human mAbs, e.g., Ab 1F8, 3A1 and 3B12, were mapped to the receptor-binding motif that directly interfaces with hCD26. The S mutations at positions 512, 540 and 542 identified in the escape mutants could completely abrogate the neutralization activities of the antibodies20. The mAb 4C2, however, does not engage T512 and only contacts Y540 and R542 with negligible vdw interactions (1 and 4 vdw contacts for Y540 and R542, respectively; Table 4). Therefore, it is unlikely that substitutions at these residues would also compromise 4C2 activity. Furthermore, though multiple RBD mutations have been identified in the natural variants of human MERS-CoV isolates30, none were involved in the 4C2 epitope recipe. Given the advantage of using a cocktail of neutralizing mAbs to target non-cross-resistant epitopes and thus to decrease the possibility of viral escape, our humanized 4C2 antibody would be a useful addition to any formulation of anti-MERS-CoV antibodies.",

            "text": "In this study, the humanization of 4C2 was instructed by the structure of the antibody bound to MERS-RBD. By switching its sequence to the homologous human antibody sequence but preserving all the interface residues, we managed to humanize the antibody maximally while simultaneously maintaining its binding capacity to the viral ligand. It is noteworthy that the 4C2/MERS-RBD binding, unlike a majority of other structurally defined antibody/antigen interactions31,32,33,34, relies more on the CDR2 loop region (145 vdw contacts for HCDR2 and LCDR2) than on the CDR1 (56 contacts for HCDR1 and LCDR1) or CDR3 (77 contacts for HCDR3 and LCDR3) regions. The LCDR2 loop, which is defined as a three-residue motif composed of Y50, T51 and S52 based on the IMGT data, only accounts for approximately half of the vdw contacts contributed by LCDR2. Four amino acids flanking LCDR2, including Y49, R53, H55 and S56, provided the other half of the vdw interactions and were therefore retained in the humanized antibody. Accordingly, our neutralization test indeed showed that humanized 4C2 exhibited similar inhibitory activity against MERS-CoV infection to the parental mouse antibody in vitro while it also can abate virus titers efficiently in vivo. This highlights the advantage of structure-based humanization strategies. Despite the recent success in identifying mAbs targeting several different viruses from human antibody libraries35,36,37,38, the conventional method of initially isolating neutralizing mAbs from immunized animals (e.g., mice) and subsequently humanizing the mAbs for therapeutic applications remains a dominant strategy for mAb discovery. Our work presents an example of bridging the identification and humanization steps via crystallography for mAbs targeting MERS-CoV. Similar strategies might be applied to other viruses.",
