Each step is controlled by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that densely coat mRNAs and form large mRNA ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs)1. The usage of splice sites in pre-mRNAs is determined by serine- and arginine-rich (SR) proteins, a family of essential RBPs comprising 12 members (SRSF1\u2013SRSF12)2. SR proteins contain one or two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and bind to specific sequences within exons, promoting their inclusion by recruiting the spliceosome to nearby splice sites. This recruitment is mediated by their arginine- and serine-rich (RS) domain, a low-complexity C-terminal region enriched in serine-arginine dipeptides that interacts with spliceosomal proteins; for example, U170K or U2AF2 (ref. 3).",

In renal cancer cells, SRSF7 is both a target and a regulator of microRNAs miR-30a-5p and miR-181a-5p (ref. 14). SRSF7 was also suggested to regulate its own transcript levels through the inclusion of an ultraconserved alternative exon, called poison cassette exon (PCE), a process referred to as unproductive splicing. The PCE contains a premature termination codon (PTC) and causes the rapid cytoplasmic degradation of the transcript by NMD15,16. SRSF7 transcript levels are also crossregulated by SRSF3, which binds to the PCE and promotes its inclusion17.",

Indeed, NMD inhibition using cycloheximide (CHX) increased SRSF7-PCE and SRSF7-PCE1/4 levels in wild-type (WT) cells, confirming that they are bona fide NMD targets (Fig. 1f). However, in SRSF7 OE cells, SRSF7-PCE transcript levels were not increased by CHX treatment, which was validated by quantitative PCR (qPCR) with reverse transcription (Fig. 1g). Cytoplasmic-nuclear fractionation confirmed that both PCE-containing isoforms are exported to the cytoplasm, but whereas SRSF7-PCE1/4 is degraded by NMD, SRSF7-PCE is NMD-resistant (Fig. 1h and Extended Data Fig. 1d,e). Intron-containing isoforms SRSF7-I3a+b and SRSF7-I3b were also NMD-resistant, probably due to their nuclear retention. NMD was not globally compromised in SRSF7 OE cells since SRSF7-PCE1/4 was stabilized by CHX to the same extent in WT and SRSF7 OE cells (Fig. 1g). These results hint at a multilayered auto-regulatory mechanism, where SRSF7 OE promotes the generation of various SRSF7 transcript isoforms that are NMD-sensitive (SRSF7-PCE1/4) or NMD-resistant (SRSF7-PCE).",

This polypeptide was indeed detectable in SRSF7 OE cells using both anti-GFP and mAb104 antibodies (Extended Data Fig. 2d,e, pink asterisk). MS/MS analyses after IP confirmed the presence of peptides mapping to the junction between the RS domain and the GFP tag (Extended Data Fig. 2f,g), although few peptides mapped to the RS domain itself and none to the unique 11-amino acid N terminus. This is likely due to the low abundance of this protein, small peptide sizes and the high charge and repetitive nature of RS domains. The in-frame start codon of SRSF7_RS is ultraconserved in mammals and the same protein halves would also arise from translation of the human SRSF7-PCE isoform (Extended Data Fig. 2h). Altogether, our data reveal that upon PCE inclusion, the resulting transcript encodes two SRSF7 protein halves (referred to as Split-ORFs).",

SRSF7 binding to the PCE might promote translation of Split-ORF2 as it shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm26 and was previously shown to promote the translation of unspliced viral and reporter transcripts9,27. To test where SRSF7 binds in SRSF7-PCE transcripts when they undergo translation, we performed iCLIP on monosomal and polysomal fractions (piCLIP)26 (Fig. 2f and Extended Data Fig. 2i,j). piCLIP reads were virtually absent from coding exons of SRSF7, consistent with efficient translation of the ORF and removal of SRSF7 by translating ribosomes, but two abundant crosslink peaks were present upstream of the AUG of SRSF7_RS (Fig. 2f, green arrows, and Supplementary Table 3). This raises the possibility that SRSF7 binding promotes translation of Split-ORF2, thereby protecting SRSF7-PCE transcripts from NMD.

The presence of radioactively labeled RNA-protein complexes between 15 and 35 kDa whose abundance increased upon SRSF7 OE indicated that SRSF7_RRM indeed binds to RNA (Fig. 3b). We found similar consensus binding motifs for endogenous SRSF7, SRSF7-GFP and SRSF7_RRM (GAYGAY) (Fig. 3c) and all three proteins bound SRSF7 transcripts to a similar extent (Supplementary Table 4), indicating that SRSF7_RRM has a similar RNA-binding specificity and affinity as full-length SRSF7. Moreover, all SRSF7 variants bound near the 5\u2032 splice sites of introns 3a, 3b and 5, which all remain partly unspliced on SRSF7 OE, while other introns are efficiently spliced (Fig. 3d, green arrows). However, SRSF7_RRM lacked the strong binding peak of full-length SRSF7 (WT and OE) and SRSF7-GFP near the 3\u2032 splice site of intron 3a (black arrow), expected to promote PCE inclusion.",

SRSF7-GFP and SRSF7_RRM-GFP formed larger bead aggregates compared to GFP alone, likely caused by simultaneous binding to RNA molecules within the lysates (Fig. 5c). Addition of in vitro-transcribed SRSF7 PCE RNA that contains ~34 predicted SRSF7 binding sites (Extended Data Fig. 5b) produced super-aggregates of beads coated with SRSF7-GFP but not SRSF7_RRM-GFP, indicating that oligomerization via the RS domain drives aggregation. Notably, addition of SRSF3 PCE RNA, which has a similar length (460 nt) and GC content (51 versus 45%) but contains few SRSF7 binding sites, did not cause super-aggregates (Extended Data Fig. 5b,c). Together, these results indicate that both sequence-specific RNA binding and oligomerization of SRSF7 are required to promote high-order assembly of mRNPs in vitro.",

Very few SRSF7-I3+5 isoforms were detectable, and SRSF7 bodies were drastically diminished and showed poor colocalization with SRSF7-mutZn protein (Fig. 6d\u2013f and Extended Data Fig. 6d\u2013h). To verify the altered RNA-binding specificity of SRSF7_mutZn, we performed iCLIP (Extended Data Fig. 6i and Supplementary Table 6). SRSF7 and SRSF7_mutZn showed 84% overlap in bound target transcripts, but SRSF7_mutZn crosslinked more to introns and less to exons (Extended Data Fig. 6j,k). The binding motif of SRSF7_mutZn changed from purine-rich GAYGAY triplets to pyrimidine-rich CNYC motifs, similar to the SRSF3 binding motif (Fig. 6g), indicating that its RNA-binding specificity is now determined exclusively by its RRM, which is highly similar to the RRM of SRSF3 (ref. 38). Altogether, these data exclude the possibility that high levels of SRSF7 mRNA simply overwhelm the NMD machinery and confirm that sequence-specific binding and oligomerization of SRSF7 are required for body formation and auto-regulation in vivo.",

To test this hypothesis, we used BAC recombineering to mutate the in-frame AUG (Fig. 6h).

Two scenarios for the generation of Split-ORFs were common: the inclusion of an alternative exon, for example an ultraconserved PCE that provides a STOP and a downstream in-frame START codon, or the skipping of an alternative exon that generates a frameshift and a PTC in close proximity. In the latter case, a downstream in-frame START codon already present in the original ORF would be used.",

To test whether these RBPs express Split-ORFs under some conditions, we followed three different strategies. First, we generated P19 cell lines overexpressing either SRSF5- or SRSF6-GFP. WB using specific antibodies revealed that the levels of endogenous proteins were strongly decreased in the OE samples, indicative of auto-regulation (Fig. 7e). In both cases additional protein bands appeared whose sizes would fit the predicted Split-ORFs (Extended Data Fig. 7c). Second, we inspected binding of RBPs to their own NMD transcripts using available eCLIP and iCLIP data39\u201341. In several cases, such as BCLAF1, TIAL1, SRSF5, SRSF6 and HNRNPL, a conserved PCE that generates Split-ORFs was massively bound by the encoded RBP (Fig. 7f, data not shown). This indicates that this NMD isoform is made, stably detectable and possibly involved in an auto-regulatory feedback mechanism. Third, to assess whether some of the predicted Split-ORFs are translated in a physiological context, we interrogated publicly available Ribo-Seq data from mouse hearts42, 17Cl-1 cells infected with murine coronavirus, human cardiomyocytes42, A549 cells infected with Dengue virus and human embryonic kidney 293 cells43. We selected RBP-encoding transcripts where insertion of a unique NMD exon gives rise to Split-ORFs and counted Ribo-Seq footprint reads mapping to these exons. We identified 29 RBPs with at least two footprint reads within their Split-ORF-encoding NMD exon in mouse and 19 RBPs in human datasets (Fig. 7g, Extended Data Fig. 7d and Supplementary Table 10). Among those, SRSF5, SRSF6, SRSF7, BCLAF1, HNRNPL, PRPF39 and TIAL1 were found in both species. Our data indicate that PCE location, sequence and Split-ORF coding potential are conserved between mouse and human and widespread among multi-domain RBPs. Split-ORF translation would represent an intriguing mechanism to rescue transcripts from NMD and thereby generate distinct protein isoforms or contribute to the regulation of RBP expression. The individual mechanisms and functions require further studies.",

            "text": "We report the discovery of an intricate auto-regulatory feedback loop ensuring protein homeostasis of the essential splicing factor SRSF7. At low levels, SRSF7 binds the SRSF7 pre-mRNA in both exons flanking the PCE and promotes its skipping, thereby producing functional SRSF7 protein (Fig. 8, upper panel). Upon transient OE, SRSF7 binds to splice sites within the PCE and promotes its inclusion. PTC-containing SRSF7-PCE transcripts perform two different functions: normally they are NMD-sensitive and rapidly degraded in the cytoplasm, thereby decreasing the levels of functional SRSF7 protein (Fig. 8, middle panel). However, sustained SRSF7 OE, for example after oncogenic transformation, protects SRSF7-PCE transcripts from NMD. Under such conditions, they become bicistronic mRNAs encoding two SRSF7 protein halves, here termed Split-ORFs. Split-ORF1 is translated into SRSF7_RRM, which acts as a dominant-negative form of SRSF7 (Fig. 8, lower panel). It retains its RNA-binding specificity and nuclear localization but cannot recruit the spliceosome due to its missing RS domain. SRSF7_RRM can easily outcompete full-length SRSF7 as it is not stored in nuclear speckles and therefore readily available. Within SRSF7 pre-mRNA, it inhibits PCE inclusion and promotes retention of introns 3a, 3b and 5. The intron-containing SRSF7-I3+5 transcripts are sequestered in the nucleus and act as architectural RNAs (arcRNAs). Massive binding of SRSF7 and its oligomerization assemble large nuclear bodies at SRSF7 transcription sites (Fig. 8, lower panel), which sequester intron-retained but likely also fully spliced SRSF7 mRNAs. This results in a reduction of translatable SRSF7 transcripts in the cytoplasm and functional SRSF7 protein in the nucleus and ultimately restores normal SRSF7 levels.",

Similarly, SRSF7 binds to about 80 regularly spaced binding sites within intron 3 and the PCE. Oligomerization between SRSF7 proteins bound to distinct SRSF7-I3+5 transcripts likely triggers the formation of large nuclear bodies that undergo phase separation35. In line with this, SRSF7 bodies consist of multiple SRSF7-containing RNPs that are held together by weak hydrophobic interactions. Their assembly depends on transcription and their size correlates with the levels of SRSF7-I3+5 and the oligomerization capacity of SRSF7.

Ribosomes might fail to terminate at the PTC48 or reinitiate at downstream AUGs49. Alternatively, leaky scanning, ribosome shunting or initiation at an internal ribosomal entry site might cause ribosomes to skip the normal translation start site and initiate at the AUG within the PCE50,51. The detection of an N-terminally truncated SRSF7 peptide (SRSF7_RS-GFP), the conserved START codon in a strong Kozak context (ACCAUGG) and the presence of Ribo-Seq reads at the AUG (Figs. 2e and 7g) indicate that translation initiation might occur downstream of the PTC. Translation of Split-ORF2 resumes the original reading frame and would allow ribosomes to remove all EJCs, thereby rendering SRSF7-PCE transcripts NMD-resistant and allowing for bulk translation of Split-ORF1. Indeed, translational read-through and reinitiation have been shown to rescue transcripts from NMD52\u201354. Patients with nonsense mutations in genes causing several diseases have been shown to express NMD-resistant PTC-containing transcripts. In all cases, reinitiation at an AUG downstream of the PTC caused the expression of an N-terminally truncated protein, which delayed the symptoms or acted as a dominant-negative variant55\u201358. Ribosome profiling in human hearts further revealed that translation frequently occurs downstream of PTCs, which might prevent the degradation of transcripts with nonsense mutations42.",

However, a similar gene organization is found in SRSF5 and SRSF6, where PCE inclusion also generates Split-ORFs that separate RRM and RS domains. Moreover, the PCE of SRSF7 is 99% conserved between mouse and human, which is significantly higher than any coding exon of SRSF7 (ref. 15). Regulation of PCE inclusion and translation initiation would require high conservation only around the splice sites, the PTC and the downstream AUG, not within the middle region. However, our data indicate that sequence-specific binding of SRSF7 along the entire PCE is required for proper auto-regulation of SRSF7. Thus, the similar PCE organization for other SR proteins and the ultraconservation of PCE length, sequence and location indicate additional roles, such as the assembly of nuclear bodies.",

Extensive NMD might also result in large amounts of potentially harmful degradation products, which could induce transcriptional compensation of related genes, as recently shown in mouse ES cells59. Moreover, the reversible sequestration of functional SRSF7 transcripts and SRSF7 proteins in nuclear bodies provides a fast way to adjust protein levels when cellular conditions change. The nuclear-retained SRSF7-I3+5 isoforms might be spliced posttranscriptionally to increase protein expression when conditions become more favorable60,61. Ultimately, this regulatory mechanism could also represent an antiviral defense, since several viruses inactivate NMD and hijack SRSF7 for processing and translating their transcripts9,62\u201365. In line with this, Ribo-Seq reads are present on the PCE in cells infected with coronavirus (Fig. 7g).

Split-ORFs often precisely separate RNA-binding domains from the rest of the protein, offering a simple way to generate dominant-negative protein isoforms or to increase protein diversity. We confirmed the expression of Split-ORFs for other SR proteins by WB and identified Ribo-Seq reads within Split-ORF-encoding NMD exons of ~30 RBP transcripts. This indicates that multiple Split-ORFs are expressed and might contribute to the regulation of gene expression under certain physiological conditions.",

For this, all annotated NMD transcripts were obtained from the Ensembl database (v.95) using Biomart resulting in 6,996 mouse and 16,141 human sequences. First, NMD transcripts were translated in silico from the forward strand only allowing three possible reading frames. Second, all peptides with a minimal length of 50 amino acids were aligned with BlastP using local alignments74 against all proteins of the respective species using Ensembl proteins (v.95). All alignments with an E value \u226410 were retained. Third, all NMD transcripts were kept, which generate at least two peptides that align to the same protein sequence. Predicted ORFs were required to align with at least 50% of their sequence length and with at least 90% sequence identity to the Ensembl proteins. Both filters avoided short spurious ORF matches that were false positives. Fourth, after filtering, NMD transcripts with at least two matching ORFs were tested for encoded protein domains, by overlapping the ORF locations with annotated PFAM domains in Ensembl proteins75. Only PFAM domains that overlapped completely with matching ORFs were considered. To derive orthologous human and mouse genes we used the Biomart (Ensembl v.95). Fisher\u2019s Exact test was used to compute enrichment of a PFAM domain type using all genes with NMD transcripts as background. P values were corrected using FDR in R and an FDR \u2264 0.05 was considered significant. Gene-ontology enrichment of the identified NMD gene sets were conducted using the functional annotation tool of the DAVID webserver (https://david.ncifcrf.gov). Enriched categories with a corrected P \u2264 0.001 (Benjamini\u2013Hochberg) were considered significant.",

Middle: upon transient OE, SRSF7 binds to splice sites within the PCE and promotes its inclusion. SRSF7-PCE transcripts are rapidly degraded by NMD in the cytoplasm, and the levels of functional SRSF7 protein decreases. Bottom: sustained SRSF7 OE protects bicistronic SRSF7-PCE transcripts from NMD and translation produces two SRSF7 protein halves (SRSF7_RRM and SRSF7_RS). SRSF7_RRM acts as a dominant-negative form and outcompetes full-length SRSF7, inhibiting PCE inclusion and promoting retention of introns 3a, 3b and 5 instead. Intron-containing SRSF7-I3+5 transcripts now act as arcRNAs, which assemble nuclear bodies at SRSF7 transcription sites via massive binding of SRSF7 and its oligomerization. SRSF7 bodies sequester intron-retained and likely fully spliced SRSF7 mRNAs, resulting in the reduction of functional SRSF7 protein in the nucleus and translatable SRSF7 transcripts in the cytoplasm, ultimately restoring normal SRSF7 levels.",
