Ribavirin was included for coverage of a presumptive viral illness, given its in vitro activity against a variety of RNA and DNA viruses (5). As data on pathogenesis accrued, a hypothesis suggesting that lung injury may be immune mediated led to widespread use of corticosteroids in combination with ribavirin (6,7). Finally, isolation of SARS-CoV allowed for in vitro susceptibility studies that, in combination with increasing reports of toxicity attributed to ribavirin, resulted in discontinuation of ribavirin as a treatment for SARS in Toronto, although not in all affected areas (8,9).",

Early in the outbreak, however, we focused our attention on designing a trial to evaluate the efficacy of ribavirin, which was being used in Canada and Hong Kong and had been associated with clinical successes in uncontrolled reports (10,11). We believed that conducting such a trial was important, given the widespread use of ribavirin and its potential risks and benefits. Subsequently, reports of adverse events associated with its use, demonstrated lack of in vitro activity, and reports of clinical progression on therapy convinced Canadian clinicians to discontinue its use without further study (8,9,12). At this point, we do not feel that a trial of ribavirin therapy is warranted. Some may argue that such a trial would have been valuable, given the continued use of ribavirin for the treatment of SARS in Hong Kong and China (13).",

Although there may be a temptation to launch a trial rapidly after the onset of an outbreak, in most cases the etiologic agent should be identified with reasonable certainty before conducting trials of specific agents. Agents selected for study should have plausible mechanisms of action, activity established by in vitro studies, known toxicity profiles, and preliminary clinical evidence supporting their efficacy. Evidence should not consist solely of anecdotal case reports but should include some data derived from comparisons of treated and untreated patients. If other means of rejecting the hypothesis exist (i.e., in vitro studies, animal studies), but have not yet been conducted, a trial of the agent should be deferred and its resources allocated to trials testing agents that cannot be evaluated by other means. For example, the hypothesis that steroids can improve outcome in SARS by preventing or abrogating immune-mediated lung injury will be difficult to disprove by any means short of a trial.",

As a result, the specificity of diagnosis may be poor. Conducting a trial without a specific diagnostic test may result in the inclusion of patients without the condition of interest.

This was particularly problematic in returned travelers with respiratory illness.

Outbreaks of unknown and novel pathogens represent unique situations in which such data will not be available. The initial use of supportive care alone is a defendable position, particularly when minimal evidence exists to support the use of any therapeutic agent, and considerable evidence exists to support potential harm. This approach was adopted in the United States, and no fatal cases were reported, although only eight U.S. cases have been serologically confirmed (4). In parts of the world where outbreaks were larger, considerable pressure was placed on clinicians to offer specific therapies directed against SARS-CoV, even if such therapies were unproven and potentially dangerous. When unproven and potentially harmful therapeutic agents are being used in clinical practice, a simple, rapidly conducted trial may be beneficial. Protocols will need to allow for the evolution of clinical practice during the outbreak. Although changes in dose or duration may make interpretation of results more difficult, rigid adherence to initial protocols may make trials unacceptable to clinicians and potentially dangerous to patients. Such trials require ongoing communication with trial participants and timely disclosure of emerging information about efficacy and safety.",

A major role of the network would be to establish a communication system to connect front-line clinicians and network collaborators at multiple sites to facilitate an exchange of clinical information. This would allow accumulated clinical experience to be shared between sites and would provide a forum for the discussion of patient management issues. Furthermore, it could be used to identify and select hypotheses for evaluation, determine the feasibility of studies, and recruit clinicians to participate in trial design and implementation.

For example, a protocol for a trial of corticosteroids in SARS could be designed and approved now and implemented if another outbreak occurs. Additionally, a \u201crolling\u201d type of ethics approval could be developed, whereby portions of a trial could be approved while other elements are modified in real time as the trial is launched, with ongoing supervision and periodic re-approval by the ethics board.

For example, SARS studies conducted in Toronto required clinicians to obtain specimens such as nasopharyngeal swabs in addition to those collected for clinical purposes. Such actions increase the potential for both exposure to and acquisition of SARS.",

Although these exposures did not result from participation in the clinical trial, they highlight the difficulty of conducting clinical trials during an outbreak, especially when researchers are also involved in outbreak management and may be moving between institutions. Evidence that healthcare workers working part-time at several Toronto area hospitals transmitted SARS from one institution to another led to the public health requirement that healthcare workers be limited to a single institution. In particular, healthcare workers at hospitals in which transmission had occurred were not permitted to enter other hospitals. Such policies were important in limiting the spread of the outbreak but provide additional challenges to trial implementation.",

Integrating clinical care and trial monitoring can reduce the number of patient visits. Sharing specimens between clinical and research laboratories may eliminate the need for additional specimen collections, and symptom assessment by telephone interview would minimize the need for patient contact. The study should be coordinated centrally and communication between study sites should be by teleconference and email, until risks are defined and minimized. Travel between centers would be limited by providing data collection forms designed to be directly scanned and transmitted via the Internet. This would reduce transmission risk and also allow the participation of multiple international sites in a single trial.
