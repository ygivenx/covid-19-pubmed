Within 4 months after the first global alert about the\nnew disease, all known chains of transmission had been interrupted in an outbreak that\naffected 27 countries on all continents. Most public health experts and scientists\nbelieve that the question of whether SARS has become endemic can only be answered after\nat least 12 months of postoutbreak surveillance. The SARS experience, however, made one\nlesson clear early in its course: inadequate surveillance and response capacity in a\nsingle country can endanger national populations and the public health security of the\nentire world. As long as national capacities are weak, international mechanisms for\noutbreak alert and response will be needed as a global safety net that protects other\ncountries when one nation\u2019s surveillance and response systems fail.",

These events demonstrated the consequences that delayed national recognition\nand response to outbreaks could have: illness and death of national populations\nincluding health workers, potential spread to other countries, and significant\ndisruptions of travel and trade. These outbreaks also emphasized the need for a global\nsurveillance and response mechanism. The Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network\n(GOARN), set up in 1997 and formalized in 2000, was one major response to this need\n(World Health Organization [WHO], unpub. data and \n4\n). Though the network, which now has 120 partners throughout the world, currently\nidentifies and responds to more than 50 outbreaks in developing countries each year, the\nSARS outbreak was the first time that GOARN identified and responded to an outbreak that\nwas rapidly spreading internationally.",

Concurrently, GOARN response teams in Vietnam and Hong\nKong began collecting clinical and epidemiologic information about the patient and a\ngrowing number of others with similar symptoms. As more specimens entered the network\nlaboratories, influenza viruses were ruled out as the causative agent. WHO made its\nfirst global alert on March 12, followed by a second, on March 15, when more than 150\nsuspected new cases had been reported from several geographic areas, including Hong\nKong, Singapore, Vietnam and Canada (\n9\n,\n10\n). With the second alert, WHO provided a case definition and name, thus beginning\na coordinated global outbreak response that brought heightened vigilance everywhere and\nintense control efforts. GOARN linked some of the world\u2019s best laboratory\nscientists, clinicians, and epidemiologists electronically, in virtual networks that\nprovided rapid knowledge about the causative agent, mode of transmission, and other\nepidemiologic features (\n11\n). This real-time information made it possible for WHO to provide specific\nguidance to health workers on clinical management and protective measures to prevent\nfurther nosocomial spread. It also made possible recommendations to international\ntravelers to curtail international spread. Recommendations were at first nonspecific,\nurging international travelers to have a high level of suspicion if they had traveled to\nor from areas where the outbreak was occurring. But as more information became\navailable, airports were asked to screen passengers for history of contact with SARS and\nfor persons with current illness that fit the SARS case definition. Finally, when these\nrecommendations did not completely stop international spread, passengers themselves were\nasked to avoid travel to areas where contact tracing was unable to link all cases to\nknown chains of transmission (\n12\n). Within 4 months, transmission of SARS had been interrupted at all sites, and\non July 5, 2003, the SARS outbreak was declared contained (\n13\n).",
