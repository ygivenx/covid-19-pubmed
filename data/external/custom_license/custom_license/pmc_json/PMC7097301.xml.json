Loser et al. generated regulatory T cells in vitro by infecting naive T cells with a retrovirus encoding Foxp3, a transcription factor involved in the development of CD4+CD25+T cells. Injection of Foxp3-infected cells inhibited contact hypersensitivity and prevented the ongoing development of autoimmune dermatitis in sensitized mice.",

Simmons et al. searched for pH-dependent endosomal proteins that might be involved in infectivity and found that specific inhibitors of cathepsin L block SARS-CoV infection of cells in culture. Infection was shown to involve three steps: receptor binding, conformational change of the viral spike glycoprotein, and subsequent cathepsin L-mediated proteolysis within endosomes. Inhibitors that target cathepsin L could be beneficial as anti-infective drugs against SARS.",

This paper reports on the complexity of HIF1 signalling under various tumour conditions and reveals that HIF1 radiosensitizes tumours by promoting radiation-induced p53 activation, ATP metabolism and proliferation, yet causes radioresistance by stimulating endothelial cell survival. The success of HIF1 inhibitors as a complement to radiotherapy will therefore depend on the 'sequencing' of treatment.",
