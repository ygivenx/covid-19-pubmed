All Pap smears were reviewed according to 2001 Bethesda system (Solomon et al, 2002), and any high-grade lesion or worse detected was automatically referred to the follow-up system. Registration of the Pap test records was mandatory, and 24 million screening records were reported from 100 laboratories from 1995 to 2007. There were 5.6 million eligible women who participated in the screening programme at least once.

We used several complete and accurate national databases to assess efficacy. The significant rapid and gradual reduction observed in this study was obviously attributable to the programme. Organised cervical cancer screening is well-known to effectively reduce invasive cancer incidence in developed countries, and consistent findings were observed in this study. There was 48.0% reduction in invasive cancer incidence from 1995 to 2006 in women with an average triennial screening participation of 53.4% after 2000. Compared with the slow reduction in incidence before the national screening programme, the rapid reduction after the screening programme provides evidence for its efficacy.",

A recent study of cervical adenocarcinoma incidence in 13 European countries (Bray et al, 2005) found a decline in the United Kingdom, Denmark, and Sweden in the 1990s, primarily among women aged 30 years or more, and an increase in other countries. Improvements of Pap smear technique, such as the extended tip spatula or the endocervical brush, have aided general practitioners to collect inner cervix cells (Buntinx and Brouwers, 1996). However, the reduction in cervical adenocarcinoma incidence was not observed in all regions where extended tip spatula was generally used (Visioli et al, 2004). The awareness of adenocarcinoma in situ as precancerous lesions facilitated early detection of malignant lesions (Mitchell et al, 2004) with consequently increased incidence of adenocarcinoma. In Taiwan, the incidence of cervical adenocarcinoma increased for several years after the screening programme was implemented, and then reduced slightly. Whether this significantly reduces cervical adenocarcinoma incidence needs a longer time to determine.",
