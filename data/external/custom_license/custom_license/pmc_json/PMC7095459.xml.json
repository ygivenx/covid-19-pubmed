They cause high mortality \u2014 two in every five infected people die \u2014 but pose less of a global risk than more notorious viruses such as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). That is because infection requires close contact with the animal host, the Pteropus fruit bat, and does not seem to pass from human to human.",

The team used vaccinia to express two proteins that the Nipah virus uses to enter human cells. The research also showed that serum from vaccinated hamsters prevented onset of the disease in others. This suggests the possibility of an immunotherapeutic approach to treating Nipah, and perhaps its Hendra cousin.",
