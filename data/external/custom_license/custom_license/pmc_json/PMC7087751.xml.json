Coupled with increasing student interest has been a call for more training and opportunities in global health in medical education [3, 4]. Despite the demand for more global health education, only 37 % (47 out of 128 medical schools) in the United States and Canada had a global health component in their curricula as of 2010 [5]. In addition, in 2012, 36 percent of graduating seniors from US medical schools reported that their instruction in global health issues was inadequate [6].",

This is a result of the changing definition of international and global health over the course of the past few decades. Early international health opportunities for medical students often involved study in Europe and later included the South Pacific and North Africa. International health during this period was often defined within the broad context of tropical medicine [2]. At that time, medical school curricula included courses in tropical medicine/international health. In 1945, the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) reported that 96 % of US medical schools taught tropical medicine/international health. By 1954, the AAMC reported that only 7 % of US medical schools were offering courses in these areas [2]. Competitive forces in medical school curricula and the perception that international health as a subject was of little relevance, except for a small number of students, was thought to be responsible for the overall decline in international health education in US medical schools.",

The focus of these experiences has also evolved to include broader domains, including public health, primary care, preventive medicine and the assessment of health care delivery systems.",

Contributing factors included the inaccessibility of low-income country sites, financial barriers, few institutionalized linkages between US medical schools and overseas sites, and the absence of elective time in the medical school curriculum. Another limiting factor to medical students studying overseas included significant travel time requirements prior to the availability of jet transport in the late 1950s. However, with the increasing ease of travel and changes that addressed the aforementioned barriers, the number of students performing electives overseas steadily increased.",

The American Medical Student Association (AMSA) began publishing its International Health Opportunities Directory in 1984. This directory is now solely online and updated regularly. AMSA also published the first edition of A Student\u2019s Guide to International Health in 1986 [10]. Today there are networks of organizations that provide assistance to medical students so they can access and participate in global health experiences. In 2013, in an effort to address the ongoing demand for these experiences, the AAMC developed the Global Health Learning Opportunities (GHLO\u2122) Collaborative which serves as a resource to medical students and faculty throughout the country [11].

This objective aligns with discussions of global health over the past 10 years where the importance of health care and public health systems, especially in low- and middle-income countries, has been given increased attention [12].
