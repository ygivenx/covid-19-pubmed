Inhibition of this\nenzyme leads to the accumulation of SAH in the cell, which in turn\ninhibits S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM)-dependent\ntransmethylase reactions by feedback inhibition.13,14 Most of the viral MTases are dependent on SAM as the only methyl\ndonor. Compounds that target cellular proteins might exhibit a broader\nspectrum of activity, are less likely to lead to drug-resistance,\nbut have a higher likelihood of toxicity. Compounds that are specifically\naimed at viral proteins are expected to be less cytotoxic, but might\nhave a narrower spectrum of antiviral activity and might have a lower\nbarrier antiviral drug-resistance14 Thus,\nthe approach of targeting cellular proteins such as SAH hydrolase\ncan be considered as a promising strategy for the development of broad-spectrum\nantiviral agents.14 A number of compounds\nhave been reported to act as SAH hydrolase inhibitors.14 Type I inhibitors act through inactivation of\nthe NAD+ cofactor, and their inhibitory effect on the catalytic\nactivity of the enzyme can be reversed by the addition of excess NAD+.14 Type II inhibitors are irreversible\ninhibitors of the SAH hydrolase that form covalent bonds with amino\nacid residues in the active site of the enzyme. This irreversible\ninhibition cannot be reversed by the addition of NAD+ or\nadenosine or by dialysis.14",

None of the prodrugs 3a\u2013c exhibited\ninhibitory activity at concentrations up to 100 \u03bcM. This result\nis not surprising because adenosine is the substrate for SAH hydrolase.\nAmong the adenosine analogues, 6\u2032-\u03b2-fluoroaristeromycin\n(2a) exhibited the most potent inhibitory activity (IC50 = 0.37 \u03bcM), which was 3.6-fold more potent than the\ncontrol 1 (IC50 = 1.32 \u03bcM). However,\n6\u2032-\u03b1-fluoroaristeromycin (2b, IC50 = 9.70 \u03bcM) was 26-fold less potent than the corresponding\n6\u2032-\u03b2-fluoro analogue 2a and 7.4-fold less\nactive than the 6\u2032-unsubstituted compound 1. This\nindicates that the stereochemistry at the 6\u2032-position is important\nfor inhibitory activity. Interestingly, the introduction of two fluorines\nat the 6\u2032-position resulted in 2c (IC50 = 1.06 \u03bcM), which was slightly more potent than the control 1. The inhibitory activity of the 6\u2032-fluoro-aristeromycin\nseries can be ranked in the following order: 6\u2032-\u03b2-F >\n6\u2032,6\u2032-F,F > 6\u2032-H > 6\u2032-\u03b1-F.\nThe introduction\nof a methyl group at the N6-amino group\nof 2a, resulting in 2d, decreased the inhibitory\nactivity (IC50 = 4.39 \u03bcM) by 11.9-fold, while the\naddition of a methyl group to the N6-amino\ngroup of 2c, resulting in 2e, increased\nthe inhibitory activity (IC50 = 0.76 \u03bcM) by 1.7-fold.\nThese results demonstrate that the N6-methyladenine\nand the adenine moieties do not lead to a decrease in inhibitory activity.",

However, for CHIKV and ZIKV, 3a had EC50 values of 1.95 and 1.75 \u03bcM, respectively,\nwith good selectivity indices. Interestingly, the prodrug 3a was less potent, but also much less cytotoxic than the parent compound 2c, which is unusual as regularly the phosphoramidate is more\npotent than the parent drug.20 The phosphoramidate 3a might be slowly hydrolyzed to the 5\u2032-monophosphate\nby metabolic enzymes, or to the parent drug 2c by a phosphatase,\nwhich could inhibit SAH hydrolase, explaining the observed antiviral\neffect. Viral load reduction assays were performed with compound 2c by infecting cells with CHIKV, ZIKV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV,\nfollowed by treatment with different concentrations of 2c. At 30 hpi (CHIKV) or 48 hpi (ZIKV, SARS- and MERS-CoV), infectious\nprogeny titers in the medium were determined by plaque assay (Figure 2). Treatment with\nconcentrations higher than 1 \u03bcM of 2c reduced infectious\nCHIKV titers by more than 2 log. The effect on ZIKV infectious progeny\ntiters was limited and showed a \u223c1 log reduction. For SARS-CoV,\nthe reduction in infectious progeny titer was \u223c1.5 log at 2c\nconcentrations above 0.3 \u03bcM. The strongest antiviral effect\nwas observed for MERS-CoV, with a \u223c2.5 log reduction in infectious\nprogeny titers when infected cells were treated with 2c concentrations\nabove 0.3 \u03bcM.
