Fecal scores 1 and 2 were considered as diarrheic. The diarrheic calves, before any treatment, were clinically examined, and clinical data (rectal temperature, fecal consistency score, and presence of visible blood in feces) as well as data on sex, age, and days between disease onset and sampling were recorded per calf. After clinical examination, rectal fecal samples and jugular vein blood samples in tubes containing EDTA and plane tubes, free from anticoagulant, were collected from the calves. Also, the electrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded from each of the calves on a bipolar base apex lead using limb lead. Animals were kept in a standing position in a stock without any sedation. The ECG was recorded when the animals were thought to be in a quiet state using an alligator-type electrode attached to the skin. The positive electrode of lead I (left arm) was attached to the skin of the fifth intercostal space just caudal to the olecranon and the negative electrode (right arm) on the jugular furrow about the lower 1/3 of the left side of the neck, and the earth was attached away from these two electrodes (Rezakhani et al. 2004). All ECGs were obtained on a triple-channel ECG machine (Cardioline, Delta 1 Plus, Remco, Italy) with a paper speed of 25 mm/s and calibration of 10 mm equal to 1 mV.",

In the current study, ECG records were used for the evaluation and comparison of cardiac function between the two groups. From our results, significant differences there were seen between the two groups for the amplitude of P and QRS waves and the duration of T wave. Group B had a lower mean heart rate, which seems to cause a longer T wave duration in this group. Although differences of serum electrolytes between the two groups were not statistically significant, the difference of the P wave amplitude may be due to the different serum concentrations of some electrolytes. Hyperkalemia is the first suspect for ECG changes during calf diarrhea. The serum potassium level of group B was above the normal (3.9\u20135.8 mmol/L) (Kaneko et al. 1997). ECG patterns during the hyperkalemia are largely comparable between different species, and are characterized by a widening and flattening of P wave, broadening of QRS complex, increased P-R interval, shortening of the QT interval as well as tall, symmetric, peaked T waves (Pourjafar et al. 2008). No probable cause for the change in the QRS complex amplitude was found.",
