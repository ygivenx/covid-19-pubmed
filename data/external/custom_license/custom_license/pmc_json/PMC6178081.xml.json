Based on the genetic distance and serological characterization, the family consists of four genera: alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-coronaviruses (https://talk.ictvonline.org/ictv-reports/ictv_online_report/introduction/). Coronaviruses are important human pathogens that cause outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (de Groot et al. 2013; Drosten et al. 2003). Six human coronaviruses have been identified: human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV (Hu et al. 2015). HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63 are widespread in human populations and known to cause mild respiratory disease, while SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV had led to pandemics (Channappanavar and Perlman 2017). Stronger evidence showed that the direct ancestor of SARS-CoV, and likely MERS-CoV, originated in bats.",

According to dietary differences, bats are distinguished as insectivores and frugivores (Stuckey et al. 2017). Frugivore bats are ideal bushmeat because of huge body and thick-flesh for local people in some districts in Africa and Southeast Asia (Mickleburgh et al. 2009). Meanwhile, frugivore bats in African or Pacific countries harbor diversity of virulent viruses, such as marburgvirus, hendra virus, and nipha virus (Shi 2013). In China, cross-reactive antibody or phylogenetically related viruses to henipaviruses, ebolaviruses and rabies virus have been detected in Chinese fruit bats (He et al. 2015; Jiang et al. 2010; Li et al. 2008; Yang et al. 2017; Yuan et al. 2012). In addition, genetically diverse reoviruses, adenoviruses, and coronaviruses have been detected or isolated from fruit bats (Du et al. 2010; Li et al. 2016; Tan et al. 2017).",

Both were found in the Chinese brown fruit bat Rousettus leschenaulti (Huang et al. 2016; Lau et al. 2010; Woo et al. 2007). HKU9 includes more variants and are genetically diverse, while GCCDC1 is less diverse. The greatest difference between these two viral species is the presence of p10 gene, which is thought to have been obtained from a reovirus, in the GCCDC1 genome (Huang et al. 2016; Lau et al. 2010). In Yunnan province, there are at least three fruit bat species, Eonycteris spelaea, R. leschenaultia, and an unclassified Rousettus species (He et al. 2015; Yang et al. 2017). These bats frequently cohabitate in the same cave and can only be distinguished by bat experts or molecular identification.",

For HKU9-related CoVs, in addition to four previously reported lineages (Lau et al. 2010), a novel lineage was identified in this study. Previous studies reported that all group 2d coronaviruses within the betacoronavirus were from R. leschenaulti. In this study, we identified all bat species positive for coronavirus by sequencing the Cytb gene and found that HKU9 and GCCDC1 were from two different genera, Rousettus and Eonycteris, respectively. HKU9 consists 5 lineages. Lineage 1 and 2 are from R. leschenaulti and Lineages 3\u20135 are from an unidentified species Rousetta sp.
