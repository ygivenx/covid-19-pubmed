Lal, this book concentrates on emerging viral infections. The threat posed by the SARS coronavirus, avian influenza virus H5N1, henipaviruses, Ross River virus and viruses causing diseases in fish and shrimp is discussed in nine chapters. These chapters are predominantly written by Asian experts, but there are also two contributions by Australian groups of researchers and one by a specialist of the Swiss WHO. Special focus is placed on avian influenza H5N1 virus. Due to its possible spreading all over the globe, this infection may become increasingly dangerous. Besides viral characteristics, the conditions for causing a major pandemic are revealed in this book.",

            "text": "Some of the chapters concentrate on research activities on viruses, like the biochemical characterization of viral proteins, and thus they primarily aim at scientists and, maybe, medical doctors. Concerning different public health aspects, the remaining chapters are much more interesting for policy makers, governmental and non-governmental organizations and anyone who occupies oneself with public health. The influence of social and behavioural factors on the emergence of infectious diseases is pointed out as well as the effects of environmental factors. As human influence on ecological zones is not restricted to Southeast Asia, microbiological crossing of species barriers or the spreading of infectious diseases by global trade and tourism\u2014as discussed in the different chapters\u2014have to be understood as international problems of public health. This book furthermore underlines the importance of an international safety network of global surveillance and the continuous investment in public health to cope with the permanent threat of emerging or re-emerging infectious diseases.",
