Synthetic biology depends on the collaboration of specialists from different disciplines, as it requires knowledge in molecular biology, computer science, engineering, mathematics, physics and chemistry. Of the papers discussed in this short Review, it is only the research efforts to refactor the genome of a bacteriophage2 or to recode RNA viruses3,4,5 that belong to the category of synthetic biology. It can be predicted with certainty, however, that this will rapidly change in the coming years. In the future, large-scale changes will be introduced into numerous viruses, allowing the creation of redesigned particles that can provide new insights into biology or the design of new vectors that can prevent or cure infectious diseases, cure genetic deficiencies by delivering genes or treat cancer through oncolytic mechanisms, to name but a few applications.",

In particular, phosphoramidites (that is, nucleotides that carry protective groups on the reactive hydroxyl and phosphate groups of the ribose and the amine of the base) have been the building blocks of choice. During the past 20 years, numerous DNA synthesis companies have been established in response to an exploding demand for oligos (\u223c15\u201380 nucleotides (nt)) that are used for genetic analyses, PCR, diagnostic assays, sequence determination or other procedures. The turnaround time for an order of a 75-bp DNA, corresponding to yeast tRNAAla, with extra base pairs at each end encoding restriction sites for subcloning, is currently less than 1 week\u2014a fraction of the time and effort expended originally in Khorana's laboratory.",

It requires many oligos that must be purified, because their chemical synthesis is error prone (none of the successive chemical reactions during 3\u2032-to-5\u2032 chain elongation proceeds at 100%). For this reason, the building blocks for the assembly of large polynucleotides are generally no longer than 40\u201380 nt. Different approaches have been used to assemble oligos into large polynucleotides, although all have in common the processes of enzymatic chain elongation and/or ligation of hybridized overlapping oligos14,15. Examples are the 2.7-kbp plasmid containing the \u03b2-lactamase gene16 and the 4,917-kbp gene encoding the merozoite surface protein (MSP-1) of Plasmodium falciparum17. Currently, synthesizing genes or genomes is most cost efficient when done in part by commercial facilities, where the cost per base pair of finished and sequence-confirmed DNA is now as low $0.39 (E.W. and S.M., based on information obtained from an informal web survey).",

When grown in HeLa cells, an efficient tissue culture system for poliovirus proliferation, the synthetic virus (denoted sPV1(M)) showed no phenotypic changes compared with the wild-type PV1(M). However, when injected intracerebrally into CD155 tg mice, which are transgenic for the poliovirus receptor, CD155, the median lethal dose (LD50) was five orders of magnitude higher than that of the wild-type virus (LD50 values of 102 and 107 for the wild-type virus and sPV, respectively; E.W. and colleagues)18. Unexpectedly, the genetic locus for the enormous attenuation of sPV(M) was a single A residue at position 102 of the genome, located in the 5\u2032 nontranslated region (5\u2032 NTR) of the genome at a site long thought to serve as simply a spacer between two highly structured regions54. This unexpected result led us55 to develop a highly attenuated oncolytic poliovirus.",

The genome was completed in 2005 (refs. 44,45,46,47,48,49; reviewed in ref. 69). The development of reverse genetics technology for influenza viruses in 1999, which allowed the production of infectious virus entirely from plasmid-cloned influenza gene segments without helper virus36,37,70, makes it possible to produce influenza viruses with specific sequences for research into pathogenesis and molecular virology, as well as for vaccine production. This technology also made possible experiments using infectious viruses that contain 1918 influenza genes. Once the sequence was determined, the 1918 influenza virus gene segments were synthesized using commercially obtained overlapping oligos and subcloned into plasmids for 'rescue' using reverse genetics36,37,71. This was crucial, because sequence analysis alone offered no direct clues to the pathogenicity of the 1918 virus.",

The demonstrated role of the HA and PB1 genes in replication efficiency and virulence is particularly interesting because both genes were transferred by reassortment from an avian virus to the then-circulating human influenza virus, to generate the 1957 and 1968 pandemic strains. The acquisition of an avian influenza PB1 gene by reassortment might result in increased transcriptional activity of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and increased virus replication efficiency of a new pandemic strain49,81. The HA and its binding preference for particular sialic acid (SA)-terminated glycans has also been implicated in efficient transmission of the 1918 virus in ferrets (T.M.T. et al.)82. It has been generally suspected that a switch in receptor-binding preference that confers efficient transmission among humans would be a necessary step for avian influenza viruses in the generation of a pandemic virus. Notably, we (T.M.T. and colleagues) have found that mutation of two amino acid residues (D190E, D225G) in the HA, which was previously identified as sufficient to switch the receptor-binding preference of parental 1918 HA (\u03b12,6 SA receptor preference) to the avian \u03b12,3 SA receptor preference44,83, prevented transmission among ferrets without affecting the replication efficiency of the rescued 1918 virus82. These findings suggest that changes in receptor binding of avian influenza viruses could potentially move them one step closer to a pandemic phenotype.",

A major reason for the nearly unlimited possibilities of encoding a protein is the degeneracy in the genetic code (for example, several synonymous codons can specify the same amino acid). However, the preference for a synonymous codon is not the same in E. coli, in jellyfish or in human cells; this phenomenon is termed 'codon bias'. For example, in humans, the alanine codon GCC is used four times more frequently than the synonymous codon GCG. The cell's preference of one synonymous codon over another to specify the same amino acid is thought to relate to the abundance of the corresponding cognate tRNAs in the cell. Consequently, rare codons are associated with a suboptimal translation of an mRNA. Codon bias, then, may contribute to the restriction of the abundance of sequences encoding the same protein. Codons used frequently in the jellyfish may be used rarely in human cells, and thus expression of the jellyfish green fluorescent protein (GFP) in human cells is poor unless the codons of the jellyfish gene have been changed to those frequently used in human cells; accordingly, the GFP gene has been 'humanized' to achieve good expression in human cells94.",

Once this one virus has succeeded in overcoming the host cell, however, its burst size will be only one order of magnitude lower than that of the wild-type poliovirus. That is, although the dehumanized virus can replicate in HeLa cells, once released it has enormous problems in spreading to other cells. It should be noted that we have analyzed the sequences of the codon-deoptimized viruses for the emergence of higher-order structures that could have impeded replication.

It has been known since 1989 that in addition to, and independently of, codon usage, pairs of synonymous codons do not exist in the genome at the frequency that one might expect on the basis of the frequency of the two individual codons that make up the pair. This phenomenon, called 'codon pair bias', was discovered in prokaryotic cells98 but has since been seen in all other examined species, including humans99. For example, given the known codon frequencies in humans, the amino acid pair Ala-Glu is expected to be encoded by GCC GAA and GCA GAG about equally often. In fact, the codon pair GCC GAA is strongly underrepresented, despite containing the most frequent alanine codon, such that it is used only one-seventh as often as GCA GAG4. The functional significance of codon pair bias is a mystery, but it can be studied in systems, such as poliovirus, in which large-scale changes of codon pairing are likely to present with phenotypes in viral proliferation.",

It had neither of these phenotypes. PV-Max, therefore, was not a highly virulent variant virus, an observation that suggests that the end product of evolution of poliovirus had already optimized the encoding of polypeptide P1 (ref. 4) and cannot be 'improved'. For an RNA virus, which exists as a quasi-species, this is not unexpected. The signature of poliovirus is the efficient replication of its small genome, which, under optimal conditions, is driven by an irresistible desire to maintain optimal genome structure; that is, during replication, important replication signals are constantly rebuilt, and unnecessary nucleotide sequences (for example, foreign genes and duplications) are deleted. Indeed, the virus has an inexhaustible arsenal to achieve these goals\u2014by exploiting point mutations, by homologous or illegitimate recombination and even by the acquisition of foreign RNA sequences. These considerations do not mean that the sequence of PV-Max is the only other possible sequence that can express wild-type phenotypes in tissue culture and in CD155 tg mice. On the contrary, there are probably a huge number of sequences with wild-type phenotypes.",

Such a variant of a human pathogenic virus may enter the host by its normal route and replicate poorly, but still allow the host to mount an immune response strong enough to induce lasting protective immunity. In other words, a human virus with altered codon usage or altered codon pair usage could possibly serve as a vaccine. Recoding viral genomes, a process that we call 'synthetic attenuated virus engineering' (SAVE), may be a new and rapid route to discover vaccine candidates and prevent viral disease. Indeed, polioviruses harboring underrepresented codons or underrepresented codon pairs are attenuated in CD155 tg mice. Infection of these mice with a sublethal dose of codon- or codon pair\u2013deoptimized viruses induced an immune response that protected the animals against a lethal dose of the wild-type virus4,5.",

We also want to know to what extent computer-aided rational design can lead rapidly to vaccine candidates of a virus whose genetic and pathogenic properties are completely different from that of poliovirus. First, influenza virus is a negative-stranded RNA virus with a segmented genome; on entry into the host cell the virion must activate its virus-associated RNA polymerase, which will synthesize genome-complementary RNA for translation and replication. Second, many of the important steps in influenza virus replication occur in the cell nucleus, an environment that is avoided by nearly all other RNA viruses (for example, poliovirus can replicate even in enucleated cells). Third, influenza virus is an enveloped virus that replicates in the respiratory tract. Although this work is still in progress, our results show that, by codon pair deoptimization, it is possible to rapidly construct highly attenuated influenza viruses that, after a single cycle of immunization, protect mice against a lethal dose of wild-type influenza virus (S.M., D. Papamichail, J.R. Coleman, S. Skiena and E.W., unpublished data). Most importantly, the best of the constructed vaccine candidate strains offer a wide margin of safety at a relatively low concentration of inoculating virus (S.M., D. Papamichail, J.R. Coleman, S.

In a separate approach, the Wimmer group (S.M., E.W. and colleagues)5 has shuffled synonymous codons of the P1 region according to a specifically designed computer algorithm to maximize the number of nucleotide changes while retaining the existing codons (for example, without changing the codon bias). The resulting P1 sequence was synthesized and cloned into the backbone of poliovirus, yielding PV-SD5 (Fig. 2b). The P1 coding region of PV-SD contained 934 changes out of 2,643 nucleotides; that is, on average, every third nucleotide was different from that of the wild-type sequence. Notably, PV-SD replicated in HeLa cells with wild-type kinetics5. Apparently, the positioning of the synonymous codons in PV-SD, after the extensive codon shuffle, did not influence viral protein synthesis, confirming that synonymous mutations have an effect on the virus only when they are specifically directed to lower the codon bias5 or codon pair bias4. An intriguing conclusion from PV-SD is that, at the genome level, RNA viruses are promiscuous with respect to nucleotide changes, as long as these changes do not affect protein function or the rate of protein synthesis. In other words, RNA structures throughout much of the viral coding regions, with notable exceptions, such as cis-acting replication elements or encapsidation signals, are probably rather inconsequential.",

Hence, HRV14-SD would have probably been nonviable100. The poliovirus equivalent to the HRV14 cre maps to the P2 coding region101. We expected that scrambling the P2 coding sequence of the poliovirus genome would destroy the cre element and kill the virus, which is indeed what we have found (Y. Song, C. Ward, D. Futcher, S. Skiena, E.W. and S.M., unpublished data). Re-establishing the cre sequence in P2 by molecular engineering rescues the virus, which indicates that the P2 region does not contain any other important RNA sequences in addition to cre.

T. F. Knight described the work as \u201cthe most compelling example of work in synthetic biology to date\u201d104. From a scientific perspective, Endy's work demonstrated that overlapping genetic elements in the T7 genome were, in aggregate, non-essential for phage replication. Until these experiments, the community had been stressing the importance of these features, given that they are conserved across evolutionary distance, but the synthetic approach provided a way of clarifying this issue. From an engineering perspective, this work provided confidence that up to 5% of the DNA sequence of an organism can be changed while still maintaining its viability.",

In the reciprocal experiments, the exchange of most of the individual 1918 influenza virus genes with seasonal influenza Tx/91 virus genes did not alter the virulence of the lethal 1918 virus; however, substitution of the HA, NA or PB1 genes substantially affected the ability of this virus to cause severe disease in mice.

It is covalently linked at the 5\u2032 end to the small viral protein VPg (3B of the polyprotein), followed by a long 5\u2032 nontranslated region (5\u2032 NTR), a continuous open reading frame (ORF), a 3\u2032 NTR and poly(A). The 5\u2032 NTR consists of structural elements that control RNA replication (cloverleaf) and translation (the internal ribosomal entry site (IRES)). The ORF encodes the polyprotein, the single translation product of the viral mRNA. The polyprotein is proteolytically processed by viral proteinases 2Apro and 3C/3CDpro into functional proteins, which have been divided into the structural region (P1 and the capsid precursors) and the nonstructural regions P2 and P3 (replication proteins). The ORF is followed by a 3\u2032 NTR, which contributes to the control of RNA synthesis, and poly(A). The P1 coding region has been a target for codon and codon pair deoptimization. (b) Codon use statistics in synthetic P1 capsid designs. PV-SD maintains nearly identical codon frequencies compared to wild-type PV1(M), while maximizing codon positional changes within the sequence5. In PV-AB capsids, the use of nonpreferred codons was maximized. The length of the bars and the numbers behind each bar indicate the occurrence of each codon in the sequence. As a reference, the normal human synonymous codon frequencies for each amino acid are given. Adapted from S.M. et al.5.",

As the CPB decreases, translatability decreases and the attenuation effect on the virus increases.
