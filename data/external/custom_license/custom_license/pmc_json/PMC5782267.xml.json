Influenza real-time PCR was performed on combined nasal and throat swabs at 4 sentinel sites between May 2010 and December 2012. A subset of positive cases underwent antigenic analysis and antiviral susceptibility testing. All influenza PCR-negative ILI-specimens were cultured; a subset of culture-negative cases collected between May 2010 and April 2012 underwent RT-PCR for enteroviruses (EV), rhinoviruses (RV) and EV71.",

Among 586 ILI-patients (median age 5, 1-77 years), at least one respiratory virus was detected in 258 (44%) volunteers; 168 (29%) were positive by influenza PCR- 92 (55%) were flu A and 76 (45%) flu B. Among flu A, 48 (52%) were A/pH1N1, 43 (46%) A/H3N2 and one A/pH1N1 + B. Sixteen flu B isolates were B/Brisbane/60/2008 and four B/Malaysia/2506/2004. All 20 flu A and 16 flu B isolates tested were susceptible to oseltamivir and zanamivir. Influenza cases occurred almost exclusively in rainy season from June to November; vaccination coverage in 2010 and 2011 was \u223c 20% responding to A/pH1N1(2009) pandemic and was zero in 2012 among study subjects. Viral culture of 418 flu-PCR negative specimens detected adenovirus (5.7%), parainfluenza (3.8%), with no evidence of respiratory syncytial virus, metapneumovirus, coronavirus, or bocavirus. EV/RV RT-PCR detected 5.9% non-polio EV among 164 culture-negative specimens: coxsackievirus A4, A6, A8, A9, A12, B3, B4 and echovirus E6 and E9; no EV71 was found.",
