Although human-to-human transmission of H5N1 is inefficient [3], a conservative estimate of the effect on human health of an antigenic shift of the H5N1 virus is that up to 7.4 million deaths would occur worldwide [4]. In 1997, the first human H5N1 cases were reported in Hong Kong; this outbreak consisted of 18 human cases with six deaths [5]. Only two human cases of H5N1 influenza were reported in Hong Kong in 2003, despite intermittent reports of small numbers of dead birds being H5N1 carriers [6]. Hong Kong and other countries have since instigated H5N1 preparedness plans to control potential outbreaks, which primarily involve hospital infection control measures.",

            "text": "During the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic period from March through June 2003 in Hong Kong, disease-related perceptions in the general population not only changed dramatically over a short period of time, but they were associated with community panic levels and the adoption of prevention behaviors [7]. Public perceptions of H5N1, such as the low perceptions of its seriousness and lack of control of external causes of the outbreaks, are often at odds with the efforts put in place to control its spread [8]. Results obtained from our earlier baseline studies showed that unconfirmed beliefs about H5N1 disease transmission modes were also prevalent in Hong Kong and associated with immediate behavioral responses, particularly avoidance behaviors, such as the avoidance of eating poultry meat and the avoidance of crowded places [9]. A small-scale outbreak of human H5N1 in Hong Kong would cause increased psychological distress and the adoption of preventive behaviors in the general population [10, 11]. We also found that H5N1-related perceptions were associated with higher anticipated psychological distress and the adoption of personal prevention behaviors [10, 11]. Perceptions and anticipated community responses, however, do change over time. We subsequently conducted five additional surveys that were comparable to the aforementioned baseline study with the aim of monitoring changes in perceptions and anticipated community responses. The results are reported in this paper. The study reported here therefore monitored\u2014over a 28-month study period\u2014trends in H5N1-related risk perceptions, anticipated psychological responses, and anticipated personal preventive behaviors in the case that two to three new human-to-human H5N1 cases would be reported in Hong Kong.",

Random numbers were generated by the computer to represent page number, column. and row numbers. Six rounds of cross-sectional telephone surveys were conducted: survey 1, November 2005 (n = 503); survey 2, March 2006 (n = 501); survey 3, August 2006 (n = 502); survey 4, January 2007 (n = 501); survey 5, August 2007 (n = 770); survey 6, February 2008 (n = 750). A total of 3,527 individuals were therefore phoned during a 28-month period; the calls were placed between 6:30 and 10 p.m. to avoid an overrepresentation of unemployed people. The baseline study was conducted with a separate funding source, and surveys 2\u20136 were implemented roughly at 6-month intervals according to the study protocol. The eligible household member, whose last birthday was closest to the date of the survey, was invited to participate the study. Prospective participants were briefed on the study, and verbal informed consent was obtained before the commencement of the anonymous interview. At least three other independent telephone calls were made at different hours and days to those unanswered telephone numbers before the number was defined as invalid. Similar telephone survey methods have been used in a number of published studies related to SARS and H5N1 influenza [7\u201310, 12\u201314]. The response rate, defined as the number of completed interviews divided by the number of eligible households, was close to 60%. Approval for the study was obtained by the Survey and Behavioural Research Ethics Committee of the Chinese University of Hong Kong.",

Two binary-dependent variables were created: the number of anticipated behavioral responses (<9 or \u22659 out of 10 of the behavioral responses) and the number of anticipated emotionally distressful responses (<4 or \u22654 out of 6 of the behavioral responses). Relatively high cut-off points were selected to identify those who responded strongly to the reporting of new H5N1 cases, as it is expected that the majority of the general public would make some types of responses as human H5N1 transmission is unusual. Univariate odds ratios were derived for the associations between various independent variables and these two dependent variables. Those variables that were significant in the univariate analyses were used as candidates of subsequent multivariate stepwise logistic regression analyses. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS for Window ver. 14.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL), and a p value < 0.05 was taken as statistically significant.",

Extrapolating the answers of our respondents to the general population, however, it would appear that the general public in Hong Kong is responding rationally to this potential threat. Over time, high proportions of the general population worried less about a large-scale epidemic outbreak, showed increasing confidence in the governmental preparedness, and perceived lower susceptibility in contracting H5N1. In contrast, lower proportions of the study population believed that the human H5N1 would cause severe damage or would have unfavorable disease-related havoc (e.g., infectivity, fatality, epidemic duration), showed mental distress, or believed that the reporting of a few new human H5N1 cases would have a large impact on oneself. Compared to the baseline data, the prevalence of anticipated avoidance behaviors and the use of face-masks in public areas had also decreased by 20\u201330% at survey 6. Moreover, although the vast majority of the respondents at survey 6 believed that there was no effective treatment or vaccine for H5N1, neither of these two beliefs was associated with the mental distress dummy variable. All of these findings consistently suggest that the likelihood of community panic and irrational reactions at the initial phase of an H5N1 outbreak in Hong Kong has been decreasing. These trends mirrored the epidemiological data on inefficient human-to-human transmissions and reporting of geographically scattered human H5N1 cases. H5N1 has drawn less media attention, and reports on H5N1 have become less strident over time.",

Moreover, despite the observed declining trend on perceived susceptibility, the majority of the public remained vigilant and would adopt a large number of public health measures in the case of a local small-scale human H5N1 outbreak; however, it is an interesting finding that the prevalence of such anticipated behaviors did not decline over time. Preventive behaviors were adopted by the public on a very broad scale during the SARS period, and since then, the local government keeps reminding the public about such measures through frequent broadcasting in the media and advertisements/posters at all train stations. Habits and norms may therefore have been formed in the local general population. The community preparedness for adopting preventive measures is therefore very high as the general public in Hong Kong had been well drilled during the SARS period.",

The effectiveness of the face-mask in preventing influenza transmission is, however, controversial [18], although a local study showed that it did contribute to the control of SARS [19]. The psychological impact of a masked city may damage the economy and, in addition, relevant government guidelines on face-mask use in public venues would be required. Moreover, about half of the public would still show some form of avoidance behaviors, implying that severe economic loss and social distancing would still occur in the event of a human H5N1 outbreak.

Beliefs in airborne and waterborne transmission were also independent predictors of anticipated mental distress responses, whereas the belief in waterborne transmission was significantly associated with the number of anticipated behavioral responses. Moreover, the general public greatly underestimated the fatality rate of H5N1. Unlike the clustering of SARS cases, reporting of human H5N1 cases tended to be sporadic. Rectification of this misconception on the risk of fatality may result in short-time community distress, but the public would be better prepared to face the reality in the long run. It is therefore necessary to rectify the aforementioned misconceptions so as to reduce distress.",

Although self-reported responses may be slightly biased from social desirability, general trends in the data should still be valid. The response rates were modest but comparable to those of similar local studies [12\u201314, 21, 22]. Over time, there was a lack of significant changes as there were no human cases reported in Hong Kong, while such cases were reported intermittently in other countries. It should also be pointed out that while the declines from survey 1 to survey 5 were, in general, consistently observed, the change at survey 6 tended to be larger than previous changes. There is no particular explanation for these larger changes, although it can be speculated that by the end of the study period, H5N1 had received very little media attention for a relatively long time.
