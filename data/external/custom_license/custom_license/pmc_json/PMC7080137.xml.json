            "text": "Arbidol is a potent broad-spectrum antiviral molecule clinically approved in Russia for the treatment and prophylaxis of acute respiratory infections, including influenza A and B infections (Boriskin et al. 2008). Arbidol is also licensed for the treatment of rotavirus infection. Viruses that can be inhibited by arbidol include enveloped and non-enveloped viruses, RNA and DNA viruses, as well as pH-independent and pH-dependent ones. Arbidol therefore exhibits a broad and potent antiviral activity against a number of viruses which include viruses such as adenovirus, avian coronavirus, avian viruses, Chikungunya virus, Coxsackie virus B5, Hantaan virus, hepatitis B and C viruses, infectious bronchitis virus, influenza, poliovirus, and reovirus, among others (Brooks et al. 2012; Delogu et al. 2011; Deng et al. 2009; Liu et al. 2013; Perfetto et al. 2014; Shi et al. 2007; Zhong et al. 2009). Very recently other viruses such as Ebola virus, Tacarive arenavirus and human herpes virus 8 have been also shown to be inhibited in vitro by Arbidol (Pecheur et al. 2016). These differences in viral types undoubtedly highlight the broad spectrum of arbidol antiviral activity as well as that it must affect a common critical step in viral entry, fusion, and/or replication.",

It has been found previously that arbidol displays interfacial properties in membranes and intercalates in the phospholipid palisade structure of the membrane (Teissier et al. 2011b; Villalain 2010). Interestingly, arbidol interaction with membranes is more pronounced at acidic pH, i.e., the pH required for the crucial fusion step of several enveloped viruses (Pecheur et al. 2007; Teissier et al. 2011a). The molecule of arbidol has the capacity of forming hydrogen bonds with phospholipid molecules, having four possible acceptor groups and one possible donor group. At the same time, arbidol is a weak base which could be protonated when inserted in the membrane giving place to a positively charged molecule (Fig. 1) (Boriskin et al. 2008; Pecheur et al. 2007). Therefore, arbidol could be present in the membrane in two different species, protonated (Arp), and un-protonated (Arb). Arb/Arp interacts and modifies the physico-chemical properties of membrane phospholipids, more significantly on negatively charged phospholipids than on zwitterionic ones, suggesting that the active molecule of arbidol in the membrane is the protonated one, i.e., the positively charged molecule (Villalain 2010). Therefore, Arb/Arp could perturb membrane structure depending on the relative proportion of the protonated and un-protonated forms in the membrane.\n",

Arb has been shown to inhibit chikungunya hemagglutination, suggesting that Arb/Arp interferes with the replication cycle (Delogu et al. 2011). Arb/Arp even might have an immune-stimulating effect (Blaising et al. 2014). Arb/Arp acts via hydrophobic interactions with the cell membrane as well as through interaction with viral proteins inhibiting both viral fusion and viral entry into the cell. Furthermore, several viruses modulate lipid metabolism and modify the internal membrane environment to favor viral replication. (Blaising et al. 2014; Boriskin et al. 2008; Teissier et al. 2011a, b; Villalain 2010). Therefore, Arb/Arp could interact with membrane phospholipids, bind specific cellular, and/or viral proteins as well as could impair the formation of the membranous web necessary for viral replication.",

Molecular dynamics can be used to probe the dynamics, interaction, structure, and location of different types of molecules inserted in biological model membranes (Ingolfsson et al. 2014). The fact that Arb/Arp mode of action is most likely through membrane interaction, it seems reasonable to think that its mode of action might be at least partly attributable to its specific effect on the membrane structure, its specific interactions with particular lipid molecules and, last but not least, its location and orientation inside the membrane. Therefore, we have used a model membrane composed of two different phospholipids, a zwitterionic one, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) and a negatively charged one, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1\u2032-rac-glycerol (POPG). Our results support an interfacial location of Arb/Arp in the membrane, the existence of specific interactions with phospholipids and interestingly, Arb and Arp orientate differently in the membrane, facts that could explain, at least in part, some of its very interesting biological effects.",

The TIP3P model was used for water (Ozu et al. 2013). All simulations were carried out with a constant number of particles as an NPT ensemble at 1.0 atm and 310 K. The time step was 2 fs. Constant pressure was maintained by the Nos\u00e9-Hoover Langevin piston method (Feller et al. 1995; Martyna et al. 1994). Constant temperature was maintained by Langevin dynamics with a damping coefficient \u03b3 of 0.5 ps\u22121. The standard particle mesh Ewald method was used with periodic boundary conditions to calculate the long-range electrostatic interaction of the systems. Non-bonded interactions were cut-off after 12 \u00c5 with a smoothing function applied after 10 \u00c5 (Patra et al. 2003). Prior to simulation and in order to remove unfavorable atomic contacts, the membrane model systems were previously equilibrated for 1 ns after 50,000 steps of minimization. The production trajectory of the lipid systems was calculated for 175 ns. All simulations were conducted under electrostatically neutral environment with an appropriate number of sodium ions.",

            "text": "We have used a lipid bilayer model composed of 128 lipid molecules (64 lipids in each leaflet) in a rectangular box. It was comprised 16 molecules of cholesterol, 80 molecules of POPC, and 32 molecules of POPG surrounded by 5559 molecules of water. Thus the relationship POPC/POPG/Chol was 5:2:1. The solvent-to-lipid ratio was ~43, i.e., excess water (Murzyn et al. 2001). Figure 1 presents the structures and carbon numbering of the molecules considered in this study, the un-protonated form of arbidol, Arb, the protonated from of arbidol, Arp, POPC, and POPG. The bilayer lied in the xy plane, and the bilayer normal was parallel to the z-axis. Initially the simulation box had the dimensions of 8.9 nm in the x- and y-directions and 8 nm in the z-direction. The height of the simulation box and the cross-sectional area were allowed to vary independently of each other. Each water layer had an average dimension of 5.4 \u00c5 between membranes due to periodic boundary conditions. Arb/Arp was generated and minimized using Discovery Studio 4.0 software (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, USA). As it is well known, phosphatidylcholine is the dominant lipid species in biological membranes, cholesterol is omnipresent in many types of membranes giving them unique biophysical properties, and phosphatidylglycerol provides negative charge at the membrane surface (van Meer et al. 2008). From the negatively charged diacylglycerol-phospholipids that could be selected, i.e., PA, PG, and PS, we have chosen PG. PG\u2019s have almost identical phase transition properties as zwitterionic PC\u2019s with the same length fatty acid chains. Moreover, PG\u2019s are one of the most studied negatively charged phospholipids by biophysical methods. PA, similarly to PG, has one negative charge but its biophysical properties are significantly different. PS, in contrast to both PG and PA, has three charges, two negative and one positive, and its biophysical properties, compared to PC, are different. Being POPC and POPG the phospholipid molecules used in this work, the palmitoyl chain located in the sn-1 position is completely saturated, whereas the oleoyl chain located in the sn-2 position contains a cis double bond between the C9 and C10 carbons (see Fig. 1 for acyl chain numbering). The presence of the oleoyl chain in the sn-2 position increases the overall mobility of the hydrocarbon chains of the phospholipids and hence fluidity in the xy plane of the membrane. The lipid membrane models, including water, POPC, POPG, and cholesterol, were prepared using the Charmm-Gui web server (http://www.charmm-gui.org, Wu et al. 2014). ParamChem (https://cgenff.paramchem.org, Vanommeslaeghe et al. 2010) was used to obtain the CHARMM general force field (CGenFF) compatible stream file of Arb/Arp which contained the optimized parameter and topology data of the molecule (for the optimization guide see http://mackerell.umaryland.edu/~kenno/cgenff/). The automatic PSF generation plugin for VMD (Humphrey et al. 1996) utilized the Arb/Arp stream file data to obtain the psf and pdb files of Arb/Arp required by VMD/NAMD to build the complete system. Since Arb/Arp have a highly hydrophobic character and a high phospholipid/water partition coefficient (Villalain 2010), at the beginning of the simulation the Arb/Arp molecules were embedded at the center of the lipid bilayer in order to quickly reach convergence (Galiano and Villalain 2015; Kosinova et al. 2012).",

The time traces of the area per molecule for the system POPC/POPG/Chol/Arb corresponding to the z+ and z\u2212 leaflets are shown in Fig. S1A and S1C, respectively. As expected, no significant changes were found in the general bilayer properties in this diluted system, i.e., system having 128 lipid molecules and only 1 molecule of Arb. The data show that phospholipids and cholesterol were equilibrated early on the course of the simulation, either at the z+ or at the z\u2212 bilayer leaflets, indicating that the system reached a steady state after 1500 ps of simulation. The time traces of the molecular area for the system POPC/POPG/Chol/Arp and corresponding to the z+ and z\u2212 leaflets are shown in Fig. S1B and S1D, respectively.

Furthermore, the molecular area of both Arb and Arp presented a great variation along the whole simulation time in each membrane model system. This variation in molecular area should be due to differences in membrane location, molecule orientation, or both. Apart from that, comparing the molecular areas of Arb (Fig. S1A) and Arp (Fig. S1B), it is possible to see that Arb variation was greater than the Arp one. Whereas the molecular area of Arb along the whole simulation time oscillated between 30 and 105 A2, i.e., a difference of about 75 A2, the molecular area of Arp oscillated between 60 and 110 A2, i.e., a difference of about 50 A2.

In this way and for the last 2 ns of simulation, Arb was nearly perpendicular to the plane of the membrane. For Arp, the variation for this parameter (Fig. 3e) was lower along the whole range of the simulation than that observed for Arb, since varied from 0 \u00c5 (parallel) to near 9.7 \u00c5 (nearly perpendicular). However, Arp presented an average difference distance for the last 2 ns of about 3.5\u20134 \u00b1 3.5 \u00c5 (Fig. 3f), indicating that Arp was laid in a near parallel orientation to the membrane plane for the last 2 ns. It should be taken into account that Arb/Arp have two rings and a relatively rigid structure. Furthermore, the molecule does not completely span the leaflet of the bilayer.",

If the difference tends to be 0 \u00c5, there is a twist in the molecule so that both ends tend to be next to each other; on the other way, if the difference tends to be about 12 \u00c5, the molecule is in a complete extended configuration. As observed in Fig. 3g, the average distance between atoms 16 and 27 of Arb varied from about 9 \u00c5 to about 12 \u00c5 along the whole simulation time, whereas for Arp (Fig. 3h) the average distance between these atoms varied from about 8 \u00c5 to about 11 \u00c5. For the last 2 ns of the simulation, the two ends of Arb presented a distance of about 11 \u00b1 1 \u00c5, whereas it was about 9.75 \u00b1 1 \u00c5 for Arp (Fig. 3i).

            "text": "Mass density profiles for the model systems composed of POPC/POPG/Chol/Arb and POPC/POPG/Chol/Arp are shown in Fig. 4a, b, respectively. As seen in Fig. 4a, Arb is located at a lower depth than the phosphate groups of both phospholipids, POPC and POPG, reaching as low as the center of the bilayer, where the cholesterol tail is located. However, Arp, being located at a lower depth than the phosphate groups of both phospholipids, has a membrane depth similar to that of the OH group of cholesterol (Fig. 4b). The mass density profile of the phospholipid phosphate atoms in both systems was rather symmetric. In the case of the POPC/POPG/Chol/Arb system, the half bandwidths were about 5.7 and 5.9 \u00c5 for the z+ and z\u2212 leaflets, respectively. For the POPC/POPG/Chol/Arp system, the half bandwidths were of about 5.8 and 5.2 \u00c5 for the z+ and z\u2212 leaflets, respectively. However, there were significant differences in the mass density profile of the phosphate atoms in both systems for each type of phospholipid, i.e., POPC and POPG. For the POPC/POPG/Chol/Arb system (Fig. 4c), the maximum of the POPC phosphate atoms mass density was found at 21.47 and 20.98 \u00c5 for the z+ and z\u2212 leaflets, respectively, whereas for the POPG phosphate atoms they were 20.93 and 20.48 \u00c5, respectively. The difference between the POPC and POPG maxima were therefore 0.54 and 0.5 \u00c5 for the z+ and z\u2212 leaflets, respectively. For the POPC/POPG/Chol/Arp system (Fig. 4d), the maximum of the POPC phosphate atoms mass density was found at 21.38 and 21.17 \u00c5 for the z+ and z\u2212 leaflets, respectively, whereas for the POPG phosphate atoms they were 20.05 and 20.52 \u00c5, respectively. The difference between the POPC and POPG maxima were therefore 1.33 and 0.65 \u00c5 for the z+ and z\u2212 leaflets, respectively. This data would imply the existence of differences in the location of the phosphate atoms depending on phospholipid type. Furthermore, the location and/or orientation of Arp in the bilayer induced a larger distortion on the phosphate atoms of the phospholipids than Arb. This can be easily observed on the of the Arb/Arp mass density profile expansion shown on Fig. 4e. The Arb mass density profile is a broad one, with a half bandwidth of about 9.35 \u00c5, whereas the mass density profile half bandwidth of Arp is about 6.4 \u00c5. This data show us that the orientation of Arp in the membrane is nearly parallel to the membrane z-axis, whereas Arp tends to be perpendicular to it. This difference in molecule location and orientation in the membrane is the cause of the different effects commented above.\n",

In this work, we have studied the location and orientation of arbidol in the membrane by molecular dynamics simulations. The final configurations for both POPC/POPG/Chol/Arb and POPC/POPG/Chol/Arp membrane model systems are shown in Fig. 5a, b. At the start of the simulation, both Arb/Arp molecules were located in the middle of the palisade structure of the bilayer and at the same coordinates. At the end of the simulation, Arb locates in the middle of the palisade structure of the monolayer in a perpendicular orientation to the membrane surface. However, Arp locates near the surface in vicinity to the phospholipid interfacial region and nearly parallel to the membrane surface. Therefore, both Arb and Arp tend to locate preferentially in a definite part of the membrane, with a specific and completely different orientation. The different disposition of both molecules in the membrane could differently perturb the membrane structure depending on the relative proportion of the protonated and unprotonated forms in the membrane. Moreover, since Arp, positively charged, seems to interact stronger with POPG, negatively charged, than with POPC, it would be possible that the active molecule of arbidol in the membrane would be the protonated positively charged molecule. The broad antiviral activity of arbidol would rely on the effects it exerts on the membrane structure in general and in negatively charged phospholipids in particular.\n",
