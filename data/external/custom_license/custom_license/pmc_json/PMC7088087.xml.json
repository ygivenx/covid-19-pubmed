The morbidity and mortality associated with HP is mainly due to its hypokalemic complication, such as arrhythmias and respiratory failure. Although K+ replacement therapy may hasten recovery and prevent cardiopulmonary complications, a vigorous search for the underlying cause is mandatory to avoid missing treatable and curable disorders. Chronic licorice ingestion is one of the common causes of HP but still goes ignored.",

Furthermore, it may exert antiulcer, antiviral (coronavirus, HIV, and hepatitis C), and anticarcinogenic effects [3, 7, 1, 15]. Despite its potential therapeutic effects, licorice can produce pseudohyperaldosteronism characterized by hypokalemia and hypertension along with low plasma renin activity and aldosterone levels. In severe cases, paralysis due to profound hypokalemia may be the primary presentation and be misdiagnosed as other disorders, leading to improper management. In this report, we describe an elderly patient who presented with hypokalemic paralysis after chronic consumption of licorice as an alternative therapy for prostate cancer.",

The low plasma renin activity, low aldosterone level, and normal cortisol level found in this patient suggested a state of pseudohyperaldosteronism. Another review of his drug history revealed daily consumption of a Korean herbal tonic (approximately 800 ml/day) to treat his prostate cancer for the past 2 months. A large amount of glycyrrhizic acid (0.23 mg/ml herbal juice; 184 mg/day) was detected in the tonic by high-performance liquid chromatography. After cessation of the herbal tonic and supplementation of 800 mmol KCl over 2 weeks, his K+ returned to 4.0 mmol/l. At the 2-month follow-up, his blood pressure, electrolytes, acid-base status, and muscle strength had remained normal without the need for additional K+ supplementation.",

Measurements of blood and urine electrolytes and acid-base parameters can help the physician formulate a simple and rapid differential diagnosis [9]. In general, patients with hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HPP) due to an acute shift of K+ into cells have no acid-base disturbances and low urinary K+ excretion. In contrast, patients with HP that result from excess K+ deficit (non-HPP) usually have an acid-base abnormality. In this patient, his profound hypokalemia was associated with hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis. His low urinary K+ concentration (11 mmol/L) may mislead the physician into diagnosing poor K+ intake, gastrointestinal K+ loss, or increased K+ shift. However, two bedside indices of urine K+ excretion\u2014TTKG and UK+/UCr\u2014were both high, indicating excessive renal K+ excretion.",

Further evaluation of plasma renin, aldosterone, and cortisols levels helps narrow the differential diagnosis of a mineralocorticoid excess state. Low plasma renin activity and aldosterone levels represent pseudohyperaldosteronism. The normal plasma cortisol in a state of pseudohyperaldosteronism found in this patient point to the following causes: 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC) producing adenoma, Liddle\u2019s syndrome (activation mutation in Na+ channel), and failure of the 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-2 (11\u03b2-HSDH-2) enzyme to remove all cortisol such as apparent mineralocorticoid excess (hereditary defect) and licorice ingestion (inhibition). A comprehensive review of the patient\u2019s medication history eventually identified the cause as the chronic consumption of a licorice-containing herbal tonic to treat his hormone-refractory prostate cancer.",

Since cortisol and aldosterone are similar steroid hormones, the enzyme is necessary to inactivate cortisol before it can bind the aldosterone receptor inside principal cells [13]. When 11\u03b2-HSDH-2 is inhibited, an aldosterone-like effect is promulgated, which suppresses the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis and causes volume expansion, hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis. The amount of licorice necessary to produce hypokalemia varies. It has been shown that daily intake of 100 mg glycyrrhizic acid can produce these adverse effects [14]. Therefore, it is not surprising that this patient developed profound hypokalemia and paralysis after taking 184 mg glycyrrhizic acid daily for 2 months. The rather mild hypertension observed in this patient may be due to coexisting Na+ wasting related to partially obstructive uropathy from prostate cancer.",

Therefore, the prudent physician should at least acknowledge CAM use among patients and keep potential interactions and adverse effects in mind. In addition to the conventional treatments for prostate cancer, including radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, androgen deprivation therapy, and combined chemotherapy, saw palmetto and licorice are commonly used CAM therapies for hormone-refractory prostate cancer [17]. A licorice-containing mixture, PC-SPES, has been shown to be effective in prostate cancer patients, although the clinical trials enrolled only small numbers of patients [12]. The possible anticarcinogenic mechanisms include induction of cell-cycle arrest and cell-growth inhibition, estrogenic effects, scavenging of free radicals, and so on [8, 4]. Besides prostate cancer, licorice and its metabolites are also being studied in colorectal, breast, and other human cancers [11, 10].",
