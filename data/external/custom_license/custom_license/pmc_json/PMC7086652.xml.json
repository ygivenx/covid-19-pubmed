            "text": "Turkey coronaviral enteritis of varying severity, caused by turkey coronavirus (TCoV), has been reported in turkey flocks from multiple states in the United States since the 1990s. The major clinical signs of TCoV infection include depression, ruffled feathers, diarrhea, decreased body weight, and uneven flock growth. The most apparent gross lesions are markedly distended intestines with gaseous and watery content, particularly in the ileum and ceca. Salient histopathologic findings include shortening of the intestinal villi, an increase in crypt depth, and widening of intervillous spaces [1]. When turkeys are infected with TCoV and other infectious agents such as astrovirus, small round virus, and Escherichia coli (E. coli), they can develop poult enteritis-mortality syndrome (PEMS), which causes high mortality [2, 3]. Subsequent experimental studies of the TCoV isolates VR-911 and TCoV/ON/MG10/08 from Canada have shown that TCoV can cause symptoms similar to those caused by PEMS [3, 4]. Therefore, TCoV has been suggested to be the major causative pathogen for turkey enteritis, and secondary infections caused by other opportunistic microorganisms enhance the severity of TCoV enteritis and contribute to the development of PEMS. Turkey enteritis associated with TCoV infection has caused substantial economic losses in Indiana, North Carolina, Arkansas, and other states in the United States [5, 6], as well as in Canada [4], Europe [2, 7], and Brazil [8]. Currently, there are no vaccines to prevent the disease, and treatment of infected turkeys is often unsuccessful.",

            "text": "A member of the species Avian coronavirus (CoV) in the genus Gammacoronavirus and family Coronaviridae, TCoV has a positive single-stranded RNA genome that is approximately 27 Kb in size. The major structural proteins of TCoV include the spike (S), envelope (E), matrix (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. Comparisons of 3\u2019-end coding regions [9, 10] as well as the full genomes [11] of TCoV isolates and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) have suggested that TCoV arises through recombination in the S gene, because pairwise comparisons of S gene sequences have revealed only a 34 % similarity between TCoV isolates and IBV strains, whereas gene 3, M gene, gene 5, and N gene sequences have over 80 % similarity [9, 11, 12]. The S gene sequences of different TCoV isolates (93 %-99.7 %) are more conserved than those of various IBV strains (67.4 %-94.4 %), which could explain the close antigenic relationship of TCoV isolates compared with the distant antigenicity of different IBV serotypes [5, 10, 13, 14]. Investigations during TCoV outbreaks and genomic analyses of TCoV isolates have revealed that distinct TCoV isolates tend to circulate endemically, and their respective sequences group phylogenetically according to their state of origin [6, 7, 11]. However, these observations may have been biased because of the small number of TCoV sequences that were analyzed. In the present study, 24 TCoV isolates were recovered from clinical cases submitted to the Indiana Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory at Purdue University by turkey farms in Minnesota, Indiana, North Carolina, Missouri, Arkansas, Texas, South Carolina, and Pennsylvania between 1994 and 2010. The objective of the present study was to elucidate the relationship between the genotypes and geographic distribution of TCoV isolates from turkey farms in multiple states in the United States by using sequence analysis and comparing the full-length S gene.",

The putative peptide cleavage site separating the amino-terminus of the S1 subunit from the carboxyl terminus of the S2 subunits as well as a second possible peptide cleavage site in the S2 subunit were detected using the ProP server (http://www.cbs.dtu.uk/services/ProP/). The S1 subunit of TCoV was further designated as S1a at the amino-terminus (1-204 in TCoV/IN/540/94) and S1b at the carboxyl-terminus (205-536 in TCoV/IN/540/94) [7]. Figure 1 shows a diagram of the S protein of TCoV. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence similarities of the S genes of all 24 TCoV isolates were analyzed using the Clustal W alignment method in MEGA6 [16]. A phylogenetic tree based on full-length nucleotide sequences of the S gene was constructed using the maximum-likelihood method and the Kimura 2-parameter model. A phylogenetic tree based on deduced amino acid sequences of the S1a subunit, containing a hypervariable region (HVR), was constructed using the neighbor-joining method and the Jones\u2013Taylor\u2013Thornton model. A codon-based Z-test of positive selection for S gene sequences of various TCoV isolates was conducted to analyze the differences in the number of nonsynonymous (dN) and synonymous (dS) substitutions per site by using the Nei\u2013Gojobori method [17] in MEGA6.

A conserved sequence, NQGR/S, resembling the furin-dependent cleavage site in IBV [18] was identified in the S2 subunit in all TCoV isolates except the isolate TCoV/MO/2216/99, in which the critical arginine was mutated to glycine and the second probable protein cleavage site was lost. Rather than NQGR/S, French TCoV isolates had the PQGR/S sequence as the conserved cleavage motif in the S2 subunit. Only one HVR, spanning amino acid positions 126 to 134 (TCoV/IN/540/94) was found in the TCoV isolates, rather than the three HVRs identified in IBV [7]. Two 14-amino-acid insertions in heptad repeats (HR1 and HR2), the consensus motif (YIKWPWYVWL) in the transmembrane domain, and the late Golgi retention signal (YYTTF) for S protein were also observed in all 24 TCoV isolates.

In the present study, an antiserum against the isolate TCoV/IN/540/94 reacted with all 24 TCoV isolates from TCoV-infected turkeys and embryos by IFA assay (data not shown). The close antigenicity among TCoV isolates was associated with the high similarity of the S gene sequences, which ranged from 90.4 % to 99.4 %. The S genes of TCoV isolates were conserved compared with the diverse S genes among various IBV strains, which range from 67.4 % to 94 %, resulting in the existence of many serotypes of IBV [10]. The emergence of new IBV serotypes has been postulated to involve the recombination of S genes of vaccine strains of IBV in the field [20, 21]. In a previous study, different serotypes of TCoV/VA/73/03, TX/1038/98, and IN/517/94 were identified by using a neutralization test in conjunction with real-time RT-PCR despite the high level of amino acid sequence identity (96 % to 98 %) among these TCoV isolates [11]. Additional studies are necessary to clarify the antigenic relationships among the various TCoV isolates and serotypes.",

Along the alignment of these S protein sequences, the region of sequence with the most variation was between residues 126 and 134 of TCoV/IN/540/94 from the start codon of the S protein. Various deletions occurred in this region in different TCoV isolates. This region is in the vicinity of HVR II (residues 117 to 131) of the IBV S protein. HVR I (residues 56 to 69), II, and III (residues 250 to 365) of the IBV S protein are associated with three neutralizing epitopes. The sequences of these regions could be used for differential diagnosis of IBV serotypes [13, 22]. By contrast, similar regions of high variation corresponding to HVR I or III of IBV were not detected among the TCoV isolates examined. These differences illustrate why the S proteins of IBV strains are more diverse than those of TCoV isolates. Similar phylogenetic trees were constructed using the full-length S and S1a proteins. Thus, genotyping TCoV field isolates based on the S1a sequence containing HVR rather than the whole S1 gene or full-length S gene is more practical.",

Endemic circulation of distinct TCoV genotypes in France and North American are recognized because French TCoV isolates share only 60 % amino acid sequence identity in the S protein with North American TCoV isolates [7]. Distinct sources of recombination promoting the emergence of TCoV in North America and Europe has been suggested [7, 11]. The groupings of North Carolina, Texas, and Minnesota TCoV isolates also support the theory of endemic TCoV genotypes. The TCoV isolates from the outbreaks in Arkansas and North Carolina in 2012 also clustered geographically [6] and could be placed phylogenetically in group I in the present study. The 99.3 % amino acid sequence identity of the S proteins of two TCoV isolates recovered 20 years apart in Minnesota (TCoV/MN/ATCC/76 and TCoV/MN/310/96) implied that the TCoV isolate MN/ATCC/76 remained endemic and that no substantial genetic changes occurred over two decades. Conservation of TCoV isolates is also shown in the result that no positive selection of the S protein was found among the 24 TCoV isolates. Because Indiana isolates from 2004 and 2010 clustered in group I with most North Carolina isolates and Indiana isolates from 1994 and 2009 clustered in group II with Texas isolates, it is most likely that the turkey sources were the same for the turkey farms in North Carolina and Indiana in 2004 and 2010, whereas the turkey sources were the same for Texas and Indiana in 1994 and 2009.",
