Also in China, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) emerged late in 2002, first in Guangdong Province, subsequently spreading across China and worldwide to 29 countries. Probable SARS cases reached 8096, of which 774 individuals died (WHO 2003).",

First, they all began in China; the first SARS patient was identified in Guangdong Province in 2002, and human H7N9 influenza infection first emerged in Shanghai in 2013. Second, they have a relatively high mortality rate, approximately 9.6 % for SARS (WHO 2003) and approximately 37.1 % for human H7N9 influenza infections (WHO 2015). Third, they all caused worldwide alarm. Meanwhile they also have some differences, one being that SARS spread rapidly outside China and became epidemic in some other countries such as Canada, Singapore and Vietnam, although H7N9 influenza has been mainly confined to China. Another difference is that, unlike H7N9 influenza, SARS is capable of effective person-to-person transmission, although some research shows that the possibility of H7N9 influenza transmission via this route exists (Rudge and Coker 2013).",

There were 218 article literature from mainland China about H7N9, accounting for 57 % of all the journal articles on H7N9 influenza. Although the Chinese SARS Molecular Epidemiology Consortium published a journal article in Science in 2004 (Chinese SARS Molecular Epidemiology Consortium 2004), the Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences published an article in Science in 2005 (Li et al. 2005), most highter impact factor journal articles on SARS were published by institutes outside mainland China, such as British Columbia Cancer Agency Genome Sciences Centre (Canada), Frankfurt University Medical School (Germany), University of Hong Kong (Hong Kong), Erasmus Medical Centre (Netherlands) and Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med (UK). However, in the case of H7N9, this distribution changed distinctly.Mainland China have published 12 journal articles about H7N9 influenza in The Lancet, NEJM, Nature and Science since April 2013, taking up more than half of the total. Moreover, in the distribution of SARS article literature Citations by country and regions, mainland China is 14 %, compare with the H7N9 article literature is 65 %.",

The NEJM journal article from Zhejiang University in June 2013 analyzed the clinical findings in 111 cases of influenza H7N9 virus infection (Gao et al. 2013). The Lancet article from Chinese Academy of Sciences in June 2013 did phylogenetic analyses to extrapolate the potential origins of the virus and possible routes of reassortment events (Liu et al. 2013). The Nature article from the China CDC in July 2013 analyzed the biological features of the H7N9 influenza virus (Zhou et al. 2013). The Science article from Harbin Veterinary Research Institute in July 2013 found that one virus isolated from humans was highly transmissible in ferrets by respiratory droplets (Shi et al. 2013).",

For example, the SARS biological agent first appeared in China, but the gene sequence was first published by another country (Marra et al. 2003). Due to lack of experience, some health practitioners were infected and even died. Ten years later, the environment had changed notably. The overall capacity of the national disease prevention and control system has been greatly improved. A Web-based infectious disease reporting system has been built during the past decade, and it played a vital role in the response to H7N9 (Wang 2013). In 2008, China initiated major national science and technology projects including \u201cPrevention and Control of Major Infectious Diseases Including HIV/AIDS and Viral Hepatitis\u201d, together with the \u201c973\u201d project, \u201c863\u201d project and the National Natural Science Foundation, which promoted basic and applied research into emerging infectious disease. All of those have improved the science and technology support capability in response to emerging infectious diseases in China and the world.",
