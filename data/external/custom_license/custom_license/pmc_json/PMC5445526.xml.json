An extraordinary example is the star polymer,\nwhich emerged back in the early days of polymer science.3 Multiple polymer chains emanating from a central\nfocal point constitute the basic structure of star polymers.6 This unique topology imparts intriguing properties\nto star polymers, including low viscosity, multiple surface functional\ngroups, low crystallinity, etc.7,8 Nowadays, synthetic\nstar polymers can be prepared with delicate control over the arm number,\narm composition, molecular weight, polydispersity, etc.7 Sophisticated architectures with heterogeneous\ncompositions are not uncommon.9,10 By contrast, recombinant\nproteins are usually synthesized by the cellular machinery in an extremely\nprecise fashion.11 The stereochemistry,\nsequence, chain length, and even 3D folded structure are all determined\non the genetic level and faithfully reproduced in the biological system.\nThe topology is, however, usually restrained to linear configuration.\nTo date, there are only a few examples of nonlinear proteins, including\ncyclic proteins, tadpoles, stars, H-shape proteins, and catenanes,12,13 yet its full potential remains to be explored. It is thus highly\ndesired to further expand the topological dimension for protein engineering.",

To facilitate catenation, we consistently added short linkers\nwith sequence of GSGS before X and of SGGSG after X in both constructs\n(Figures S1 and S2). Upon expression in vivo, the X domain shall form entwined dimer, bringing\nA and B in vicinity to react and form the covalent catenanes. Hence,\nAXB is expected to have concatenated rings with relatively smaller\nsizes, and BXA would have almost the entire SpyCatcher domain concatenated.\nSince the A-B complex is tightly folded,43 the overall sizes of AXB and BXA should be similar. They all possess\ntwo N-termini and two C-termini, allowing the preparation of diverse\nmechanically interlocked protein topologies. When fusion proteins\nare tethered at one single terminus, obligate dimers will be obtained.\nWhen fusion proteins are tethered on both termini, four-arm star proteins\nwill be produced (Figure 1). To probe the topology, a proteolytic site recognized and\ncleaved by tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease was included in both\ndesigns near the X domain. Two mutants were also designed as controls.\nThe K344P mutant of the p53dim domain (X\u2032, where the lysine\nat position 344 is mutated to proline) could not form the entwined\ndimer and exists as a monomer.13,40 The D/A mutant of SpyTag\n(A\u2032) abolishes the chemical reactivity by changing the aspartic\nacid to nonreactive alanine (Figures S1 and S2).12 Therefore, AX\u2032B and BX\u2032A\nare expected to give cyclic monomer controls whereas A\u2032XB and\nBXA\u2032 serve as linear monomer controls. We anticipated that\nby placing SpyTag, SpyCatcher, and p53dim in close neighborhood, the\ncatenation efficiency can be dramatically improved. The resulting\nSpyX domains have relatively small overall sizes (\u223c24 kDa)\nand thus may serve as mechanically interlocking protein modules.",

The products\nwere analyzed by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and SDS\u2013PAGE.\nThe characterization results of AXB and BXA as well as their mutants\nare summarized in Figure 2. It is clear that both AXB and BXA were mainly obtained as\ndimers in the crude products (Figure 2A). For AXB, there are some chain-extended oligomers,\nwhereas, for BXA, it is almost exclusively dimer. After purification\nwith SEC, the dimers of AXB and BXA show up as monomodal peaks at\nretention volumes much lower than the cyclic monomer mutants (AX\u2032B\nand BX\u2032A) (Figures 2B and 2C). Interestingly, the linear\nmonomer mutants (A\u2032XB and BXA\u2032) elute at almost the\nsame time as the catenanes. It indicates that, in solution, the linear\nmutants exist as dimers due to the entwining of X and the complexation\nof A\u2032 and B regardless of covalent bond formation. It is also\nthe preorganization of A and B by X that promotes the highly efficient\ncatenation. The MALDI-TOF mass spectra also corroborated the dimer\nformation (Figures 2D and S3). For AXB, it gives mainly a\nmolecular peak of [M + H]+ at m/z of 47163 that is consistent with the expected value of\n47097 for AXB dimer within the range of error. The A\u2032XB and\nAX\u2032B both show mainly one molecular peak assigned as [M + H]+ at m/z of 23523 and 23524,\nrespectively. For BXA, the molecular peak of [M + H]+ at m/z of 49265 was only observed at relatively\nlow abundance as compared to the major peak assigned as [M + 2H]2+ at m/z of 24646.

Among them, only the last one breaks into cyclic\nmonomers in SDS\u2013PAGE. We used gel densitometry to quantify\nthe relative abundance of possible products.

Consistent with SDS\u2013PAGE\nanalysis, there are two very minor peaks with molecular weights of\n23544 and 23562, which can be assigned as the cyclic and linear monomers,\nrespectively. Upon partial digestion, the amounts of cyclic and linear\nmonomers increased rapidly, especially the linear one. Eventually,\nonly the peak assigned to the linear monomer can be observed (Figure S7). Throughout the process, we could\nnot observe any peaks corresponding to the linear dimer with molecular\nweight of 47114, which is the partially digested product of both simple\nand knotted cyclic dimers. The UPLC\u2013ESI-MS analysis of the\npartially digested products of BXA also gives similar results (Figure S8). It suggests that the cyclic dimers\nexist, if any, in extremely low abundance. Other indirect evidence\ncomes from the comparison between the AXB dimer and AX\u2032B dimer\nin SDS\u2013PAGE (Figure 2E, lanes 2 and 4). The dimer of AX\u2032B is most likely\na cyclic dimer, but it appears in a distinct position as compared\nto the dimer of AXB. So the existence of cyclic dimers in AXB is less\nlikely. Therefore, both AXB and BXA are indeed mechanically interlocked\nprotein catenanes.",

            "text": "Having established\nthat AXB and BXA are both very efficient in forming protein catenanes,\nwe further investigated how the introduction of various proteins would\naffect the catenation efficiency. The protein can be added either\nto the N-terminus or to the C-terminus of SpyX modules, or both. As\nan example, immunoglobulin-binding domain B1 of streptococcal protein\nG, a small folded protein known as GB1, has been used as the model\nprotein.50 Two consecutive domains have\nbeen added, leading to four constructs: (GB1)2-AXB, AXB-(GB1)2, (GB1)2-BXA, BXA-(GB1)2 (Figure S9). The proteins were expressed under\nthe same conditions as AXB and BXA. The SEC overlay of the crude expression\nproducts is shown in Figure 4A. It can be seen that both AXB and BXA effectively lead to\nthe formation of dimers and the dimer content in the crude product\nis already very high (up to 97% in BXA-(GB1)2). Since GB1\nprotein is known to exist as monomer, the products obtained here can\nbe regarded as obligate dimers of (GB1)2. After SEC purification,\nthe products show up as symmetric monomodal peaks, suggesting uniform\ncomposition. The SDS\u2013PAGE analysis reveals that there are also\ntrace amounts of monomers in the products, a scenario similar to that\nin AXB or BXA. The catenation efficiencies are summarized in Table 1, which are generally\ngood. The MALDI-TOF mass spectra further prove the dimer formation\n(Figure S10). For example, AXB-(GB1)2 shows a major molecular peak [M]+ of 74356, which\nmatches well with the calculated value of 74341 within the range of\nerror. The results suggest that the incorporation of folded protein\ndomains, either to the N- or to the C-terminus, does not affect the\nmechanical interlocking of SpyX modules, leading to the formation\nof obligate dimers. The results have more implications for engineering\nprotein activities that depend critically on the dimerization states,\nsuch as 3CL protease,51 or for creating\nmultifunctional proteins that can be used to make protein-based hydrogels.52",

            "text": "We have shown that SpyX modules (AXB and BXA)\nare highly efficient in forming mechanically interlocked architectures\nregardless of the tethering position of the fused proteins. But the\ncatenation efficiency varies as a direct consequence of the 3D arrangement\nof A, X, and B. In general, BXA is much more effective than AXB in\nguiding the mechanical interlocking of protein chains. The dimer content\nin the crude products can be almost quantitative (up to 97% for BXA-(GB1)2). We analyzed the crystal structures of X (PDB: 1SAK) and A\u2013B\ncomplex (PDB: 4MLS) and proposed possible models for AXB and BXA as shown in Figure 5. The chain topology\nof p53dim and SpyTag/SpyCatcher complex mandates their configuration\nin three-dimensional (3D) space. For p53dim, the intertwined structure\nmakes the N-terminus and C-terminus be at same side of the folded\nstructure. For A\u2013B complex, since SpyTag and the first strand\nof SpyCatcher are arranged in parallel \u03b2-sheet configuration,\nthe N-terminus of SpyTag and the N- and C-termini of SpyCatcher domain\nare crowded on the one end of the \u03b2-barrel. This is in perfect\nalignment with the configuration of BXA (Figure 5), leading to a more compact structure and\na better positioning for efficient reaction. The catenation efficiency\nis thus much higher. However, the configuration of AXB puts A and\nB in antiparallel arrangement. It would require either one to fold\nback in the opposite direction for reconstitution and reaction (Figure 5). This slows down\nthe reaction and decreases the catenation efficiency. The trend is\nconsistent for all fusion proteins. For AXB alone, the slower reaction\nbetween A and B leads to the accumulation of telechelic proteins,\nand thus, the intermolecular reactions are promoted to give more chain-extended\nproducts (Figure 2A).\nThe overall catenation efficiency was merely \u223c59%. For fusion\nproteins containing AXB, the tethered proteins exert significant steric\nhindrance due to excluded volume effect to discourage the intermolecular\nover intramolecular reactions, leading to higher catenation efficiency.\nThe effect is most evident if SpyTag is located between the protein\nof interest and p53dim domain. Therefore, (GB1)2-AXB has\na higher catenation efficiency (\u223c73%) than AXB-(GB1)2 (\u223c66%). A similar trend has also been observed in the BXA\nmodule, as shown by the higher catenation efficiency in BXA-(GB1)2 (\u223c83%) than (GB1)2-BXA (76%). This is somewhat\ncounterintuitive, yet not surprising since changing the location of\nSpyTag to the middle of the chain has been previously shown to increase\nthe yield of tadpole proteins.12 The 3D\nconfiguration of AXB and BXA is the origin of the difference in retention\nvolumes of various fusion proteins. For AXB, both N- and C-termini\npoint to the same side of the \u03b2-barrel and the tethered proteins\nare thus quite crowded, leading to a compact structure and a smaller\nhydrodynamic volume. For BXA, the N-terminus and C-terminus are pointing\nto the opposite ends of the \u03b2-barrel of the A\u2013B complex,\nand the tethered proteins are thus more expanded in 3D space, leading\nto apparently higher hydrodynamic volume in SEC (Figure 2A). This difference is also\nconsistently observed in each pair of SpyX-containing fusion proteins.",

The capability of SpyX modules for in vivo protein topology engineering is an extraordinary example demonstrating\nthe power of the \u201cassembly-reaction\u201d synergy. It expands\nthe scope of protein topology beyond linear configuration and serves\nas a versatile platform to further engineer the functional properties\nof proteins.",
