However, other viruses, including bovine torovirus (BToV), are also suspected to be etiologic agents of diarrhea [14, 15, 21], although the epidemiological situation of infections caused by these viruses in adult cattle remains unclear.",

The virus has a single-stranded RNA genome of positive polarity encoding RNA polymerase and four structural proteins: the spike (S), membrane (M), hemagglutinin-esterase (HE), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins [5]. Since the first isolation of BToV in 1982 from a case of neonatal calf diarrhea in the United States [34], several reports have confirmed the association of BToV with calf diarrhea in experimentally infected gnotobiotic calves and under field conditions [6, 8, 9, 13, 18]. Serological surveys have also revealed a high prevalence of antibodies to BToV in cattle populations, ranging between 55% and 95% [2, 14, 16, 33, 35]. Recently, Kuwabara et al. [16] succeeded in isolating BToV using a human rectal tumor cell line (HRT-18), which is expected to facilitate the diagnosis of BToV infection by virus neutralization tests and virus isolation.",

Fecal samples were also tested for Salmonella species using a standard technique, while Coccidium species and Cryptosporidium species were detected by a sucrose floatation method.

However, prior to the present study, no conclusive evidence for a link between BToV and epidemic diarrhea in adult cattle had been reported. Furthermore, epidemiological characterization of these diarrheal outbreaks remained unclear. Here, we examined the etiological agents and conducted detailed serological tests with samples from three outbreaks of adult cattle diarrhea in Niigata, Japan, and found that BToV was the only causative pathogen.",

The observed clinical signs were similar to those encountered in WD and BCV infections. Notably, none of the calves developed diarrhea during the outbreaks, a diagnostic characteristic that is also observed in WD and BCV infections in adult cows [27, 31]. Taken together, these results suggest that adult cattle diarrhea caused by BToV may have been misdiagnosed as WD or BCV infection by clinical investigations.",

Of note, a clear difference in sensitivity to BToV was observed between the two HRT-18 cell lines used in this study. Namely, the Niigata3(TC) strain could be isolated and propagated in HRT-18 Aichi cells, but not in HRT-18 Niigata cells. Similarly, strain Aichi/2004 could also not be propagated in HRT-18 Niigata cells, although both HRT-18 cell lines displayed high sensitivity to BCV (data not shown). These results indicate that the use of HRT-18 Aichi cells is critical for the in vitro propagation of BToV. Although the reason for the different sensitivity between the two HRT-18 cell lines to BToV is unknown, it is possible that the properties of the HRT-18 Aichi cells may have changed during passaging to increase BToV tropism.",

Recently, however, BToVs have been proposed to consist of a single serotype that includes at least two subtypes [12]. In the present study, rabbit antisera to strain Aichi/2004 showed no significant differences in virus neutralizing antibody titers between the Aichi/2004 and Niigata3(TC) strains, suggesting that these two strains belong to the same serotype. Nucleotide sequence analysis indicated that the BToV strains detected in the fecal samples from three outbreaks in Niigata prefecture were closely related to each other and to strain Aichi/2004. This finding, together with the serological results, suggests that these Japanese BToV strains may have evolved from a recent common ancestor.",

Electron microscopy photographs indicated that virus particles in fecal samples had long and short projections, whereas short projections were not seen on those in the culture supernatants of infected HTR-18 cells. Interestingly, in many laboratory strains of mouse hepatitis virus, the HE genes are inactivated, which apparently represents an in vitro artifact resulting from adaptation to propagation in cultured cells [37]. It is noteworthy that cell-culture-adapted equine torovirus Berne virus also possesses a truncated HE gene with deletions in the 5\u2032 region [22]. Taken together with the data presented in this study, the HE protein in BToV may be unnecessary for viral replication. Further examination of the biological properties of the HE protein in fecal- and cell-culture-adapted strains of BToV is needed to confirm this speculation.",
