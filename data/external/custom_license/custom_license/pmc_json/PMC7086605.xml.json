            "text": "Canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2), which was first identified and described in 1978 in both the United States and Australia, is closely related to feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) [1, 2, 15, 28]. This virus was named CPV-2 after an unrelated virus, canine parvovirus type 1 (CPV-1), which causes neonatal death in puppies [4, 5]. CPV-2 causes severe diarrhea and vomiting, and it has a predilection for young puppies, resulting in high mortality due to myocarditis and enteritis [31]. CPV-2 has spread rapidly, becoming globally distributed only two years after it was first identified, and it has been demonstrated to be a contagious pathogen to all populations of canids [12, 24]. Furthermore, CPV-2 has been evolving, and genetic variants continue to be identified. During 1979 and 1980, CPV-2 was completely replaced globally in canids by a new variant, CPV type 2a (CPV-2a) [22\u201324]. The virus underwent further antigenic drift, and a new variant, CPV type 2b (CPV-2b), was observed [25]. Subsequently, in 2000, another novel CPV variant (CPV-2c) was detected in several countries [10]. The mutations of variants have been mapped for VP2, which is the most abundant structural protein (CPV-2a: Val-555-Ile, Asp-305-Tyr, Ala-300-Gly, Ile-101-Thr and Met-87-Leu; CPV-2b: Ile-555-Val reversion and Asp-426-Asn; and CPV-2c: Asp-426-Glu).",

Nevertheless, regardless of the relatively high costs, there are some concerns about the effectiveness of the existing vaccines [8, 9, 11, 14] and some concerns about the efficacy of existing clinical therapies, which, in addition to symptomatic treatment, include antiserum and interferon treatment. Therefore, drug therapy for CPV-2 infection, as an alternative strategy, warrants more attention.",

In 1980, the antiviral effect of lithium chloride (LiCl) on DNA and RNA viruses was investigated. LiCl inhibited replication of the DNA virus herpes simplex but did not inhibit the replication of the RNA viruses encephalomyocarditis virus and influenza virus [29]. More recently, several reports have demonstrated the antiviral effect of LiCl on DNA viruses, such as herpes simplex virus [33], pseudorabies herpesvirus [30], and porcine parvovirus [7]. Lately, the antiviral effect of LiCl on RNA viruses, such as bronchitis coronavirus [13, 16], transmissible gastroenteritis virus [27], and type II porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus [18], has also been demonstrated. These reports indicate that LiCl might be a potential antiviral drug for other viruses.",

Examination by microscopy showed that CPV infection results in the detachment of many cells, while 60 mM treatment prevented most of cells from detaching (Fig. 3). These results indicate that treatment of F81 cells with LiCl inhibits CPV infection and reduces the cytopathic effect in a dose-dependent manner. The relative mRNA levels of INF-\u03b1 and INF-\u03b2 were also determined, but the levels in cells that had CPV, LiCl, and CPV+LiCl were not significantly different when compared to the mock-treated cells (Fig. 3C).\n\n",

First, LiCl concentrations of 0-60 mM were determined to have no significant toxicity in F81 cells and no significant effects on cell morphology. Second, after LiCl treatment, viral DNA and viral protein levels decreased and cell morphology improved. These results indicated that LiCl inhibits CPV infection of F81 cells. However, IFN expression was not affected by LiCl treatment, which indicates that the innate immune system is not impacted by LiCl. Thus, the potential antiviral effect of LiCl should be explored. The viral life cycle of CPV infection includes attachment to cells, entry into cells, and replication in the nucleus. These stages of the viral life cycle were evaluated after LiCl treatment in this study. CPV attaches to specific receptors on F81 cells in the initial step of the viral life cycle. The attachment step is significant for virus host tropism. We found that viral attachment was not affected by LiCl treatment. CPV replicates in the nucleus and requires that certain cellular factors are expressed during the S phase of the cell cycle. We also found that viral replication was not affected by LiCl treatment. CPV enters cells via an endocytic route that involves microtubule-dependent delivery of CPV to endosomes. This process is mediated by rapid removal of virus via clathrin-coated vesicles [21, 32]. Our results indicate that the CPV entry into F81 cells is inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by LiCl, which indicates that clathrin-coated vesicles might be affected by LiCl treatment.",
