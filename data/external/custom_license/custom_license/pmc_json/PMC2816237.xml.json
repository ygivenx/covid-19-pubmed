Interventions are strengths-based and grounded in Rogerian, Motivational Interviewing, and Solution Focused clinical orientations. Clients meet with a Treatment Education Coordinator (TEC) to assess their specific treatment-related questions, concerns, and barriers. The TEC and client strategize to create concrete steps to maintain adherence. Evidence-based tools, including symptom and barrier assessors, incentives, and regular follow ups, are utilized. Monitoring and evaluating outcomes is completed regularly through use of a specialized database, and qualitative surveys distributed to clients and referring parties.",

Implementing programs that offer unlimited sessions of mental health counseling and substance use treatment or harm-reduction strategies for people living with HIV could greatly increase treatment adherence. Additionally, public health policy could be modified with the aim of de-stigmatizing those living with HIV/AIDS. Effective legislation could include acts recognizing and legitimizing same sex couples. Comprehensive, accessible health care should be provided to anyone, regardless of socioeconomic status. These changes could help mitigate the shame reported by some people living with HIV/AIDS, potentially leading to greater help seeking behaviors and lower transmission rates. Additionally, embracing HIV testing as a routine component of primary care could help to reduce HIV incidence and minimize stigma, potentially leading to a number of positive personal and public health outcomes, including increased treatment adherence.",

It has been suggested that the relationship between anxiety and adherence may be indirect and influenced by other cognitive or psychosocial variables such as locus of control or knowledge of disease (Brownbridge & Fielding, 1994, DiMatteo et al., 2000). Anxiety has been related to adherence with antibiotic regimens (Cockburn et al., 1987), and for patients with asthma (Baiardini et al., 2006) and COPD (Dowson et al., 2004). A limitation of previous research on anxiety and adherence in ESRD is the failure to investigate the differential impact of anxiety on specific components of adherence (e.g., medication, appointment attendance, dietary guidelines).",

Data includes 124 veterans with ESRD referred for pre-surgical psychological evaluations for renal transplantation. Renal disease knowledge was assessed in several subcategories of diet, medication, and laboratory tests. Adherence was assessed with respect to diet, medication, and appointment attendance. Both knowledge and adherence were rated by clinicians based on patient self-report and renal team staff-report. Patients were divided into \u201canxious\u201d and \u201cnon-anxious\u201d groups based on self-reported presence of anxiety symptoms. Data analysis on self-reported compliance revealed that there were no group differences with regard to renal disease knowledge; however, patients in the anxious group were rated as significantly more compliant with renal diet and appointment attendance than non-anxious patients (t > 2.20, p < .05). In addition, regression analyses indicated that anxiety and knowledge significantly predicted compliance with appointment attendance [F(1,116) = 3.68, p = .05] and dietary adherence [F(4,115) = 5.95, p < .001]. Knowledge, but not anxiety, predicted medication adherence [F(3,114) = 3.63, p = .015]. Results for staff-reported compliance emphasized the role of disease knowledge over anxiety in predicting adherence.",

Providers agreed, in order of importance, that education, illiteracy, depression and alcohol and drug use negatively affect ART adherence; disagreed on the influence of income, gender and karma. Patients and providers agreed on the impact of HIV knowledge and alternative therapies (homeopathy, ayurveda, unani, yoga, reiki, astrology). Patients expressed concern about food insecurity, stigma, side effects, clinic wait time, distance from clinics and the frequency of visits required. Though medications are no-cost, patients noted the hidden costs of blood tests, travel to clinics, and days missed from work at clinics. For longer term patients, discontinuing medication following remission of symptoms occurred. Enabling migrant and traveling workers to obtain ART during time away from home, social support, increased patient morale, positive attitudes about medication and patient provider communication were identified as key elements in enhancing adherence. Conclusions: Preliminary findings highlight the need for a patient - provider collaborative approach to ART provision and enhancing adherence. Future initiatives to encourage providers and stakeholders to collectively explore existing policies for ART provision will be proposed. This study is supported by NIH grant no. R21NR011131.",

In the initial period after transplant older patients have higher rates of mortality and morbidity, but in the long-term some studies have suggested that older patients have better adjustment and quality of life compared to younger patients. The purpose of this study was: 1) to identify age differences in long-term adjustment to HT across a range of psychosocial adjustment measures, and 2) to examine other demographic and psychosocial predictors of overall adherence behavior. HT patients (n = 555, mean age = 54) from multiple centers were assessed 5-10 years post-surgery for adherence behaviors, psychological factors and physical symptoms. Analysis of variance results showed that older adults (age \u2265 60) had better adjustment on measures of quality of life, satisfaction with social support, negative affect and disease-related stress compared to younger adults. Linear multiple regression demonstrated that age and several psychosocial factors, including depressive cognitions, accounted for 25.7% of the variance in self-reported difficulty with adherence. Similar variables were significant in a logistic regression analysis predicting which patients would have difficulty or no difficulty with adherence. Clinical implications are discussed in terms of tailoring interventions to age groups for optimal post-operative adjustment.",

However, little is known about the reasons transplant patients are non-adherent. We previously reported the relationship between increased depressive affect and decreased medication adherence in both transplant and hemodialysis samples. We now report the specific barriers to medication adherence in ninety-four kidney transplant recipients from a major medical center in Brooklyn, New York. Overall, this primarily Black sample endorsed substantive impediment due to (1) too many dosages per day, (2) too many pills per dose, (3) not being able to tell if the medication is helping, and (4) running out of medication. The number of barriers that the sample endorsed was associated with increased depression (r = .209, p = .049) and decreased medication self-efficacy (r = \u2212.300, p = .004). Surprisingly, there was no relationship between the degree of reported barriers and self-reported medication adherence (r = \u2212.117 p > .05). To determine which barriers are the most significant to medication adherence, the sample was divided between those individuals who report adequate adherence on a self-report measure (Immunosuppressive Therapy Adherence Scale) and those who report less than adequate adherence. The group with poor adherence reported the following barriers to be significantly more salient: too many doses per day (t (85) = -2.5, p = .016); too many pills per dose (t (85) = -2.49, p = .015); having to remember to take their medication (t (85) = \u22122.2, p = .03); perceived side effects of the medication (t (85) = -2.9, p = .005); skipping a dose to feel good (t (85) = -2.6, p = .011); falling out of their daily routine (t (85) = -4.5, p < .001); and being short of money (t (85) = -3.7, p < .001). This study sheds light on the barriers to immunosuppressant medication adherence in a high-risk population, which may help identify the individuals most at risk of infection, rejection episodes, and ultimately graft failure.",

The participants were seven elderly women (age 85.7+/-8.3) in a geriatric health services facility, Himeji, Hyogo, Japan. We selected the control group consisting of seven women (88.0+/-2.6) in the same facility. The life reviews were conducted for ten times in February 2008. Each session lasted for fifteen to thirty minutes. The contents of the interview were about the events and memories in her childhood, adolescence and adulthood until today. We carried out the surveys to evaluate their physical and mental functions using the questionnaires such as Mini Mental State Examination, modified Barthel Index, and Dementia Behavior Disturbance scale. The surveys were done for three times, on the beginning of December 2007, the end of January 2008, and the beginning of March 2008. From the comparisons of the average scores of the questionnaires before and after the life review, MMSE score significantly increased in the life-reviewed group (P < 0.05). In particular, the score of \u201cRecall of 3 words, in which the participants recalled three words we previously asked her to remember\u201d, significantly increased (P < 0.05). It was showed that the approach of life review could contribute to improve cognitive function of the elderly women requiring long-term care.",

By randomized clinical trial recruiting, 15 older adults were chosen. All the participants had a diagnosis of Major depression. The participants were randomly allocated to receive either Treatment as usual (TAU) group (n = 10) or CBT group (n = 5). We assessed the degree of depression before the treatments (baseline), at the 6th week and at the 12th week. Measures used in this study were the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), the Geriatric Depression Scale Japanese version (GDS), and the Montgomery Asberg Rating Scale for Depression - Japanese (MADRS-J).In CBT intervention, the psychoeducation about the typical cognitive characteristics of older adults\u2019 depression and the reminiscence based hearing of subjects\u2019 compliant were conducted in addition to basic CBT strategy.",

Certain physical functions such as muscular strength of the extremities and the dexterity of digits seemed to be affected by gender. Overall, however, their physical functions were significantly affected by aging, and had decreased to a greater degree in old-old than young-old adults. Especially, it was suggested that balance while standing and the walking ability as well as cognitive functions were more significantly affected by aging than by gender. On the other hand, psychological aspects such as their subjective view of their own health and satisfaction with life showed no significant differences by gender or between age groups, suggesting their lower susceptibility to gender and aging. These findings demonstrated that both men and women showed a high risk of falling in the old-old adults, suggesting the importance of training to improve balance and walking ability as well as cognitive training in preventive care and health guidance for people in this age group.",

            "text": "Approximately 75% of adolescents who receive substance abuse treatment relapse within one year. To test the feasibility of developing an online relapse prevention program for adolescents to provide ongoing adjunct support during aftercare, we conducted a two phase research project. In the first phase we interviewed counselors (N = 16) about the content and features this program should include, compiled those responses, then asked counselors to sort and rate the responses using an online concept mapping program. The eight-cluster map provided the most meaningful break out of content: Health Education (M = 4.73), Setting Boundaries in Peer Relationships (M = 4.38), How to Follow Through with Decisions (M = 4.23), Figuring Out What You Really Want (M = 4.18), How to Achieve and Maintain Healthy Relationships (M = 4.06), Working with a Counselor or Sponsor (M = 4.01), Developing Peer Support for Recovery (M = 3.97) and Educational Activities (M = 3.68) [i.e., how to present content from the other clusters]. These findings were used to develop the interactive demonstration version of the proposed program. In the second phase of this project, we presented the demonstration program to these counselors and adolescents for feedback and discussion. Twenty-four adolescents (M=15.8 years) in substance abuse treatment participated in the study. We exceeded our pre-established acceptability criteria (80% of participants will rate their satisfaction with the demo program as \u201cgood\u201d (5), \u201cvery good\u201d (6), or \u201cexcellent\u201d (7) on the Likert scale questions) with both adolescents (M = 84%) and counselors (M = 86%). In addition, all items received a mean of 5 or better (adolescent sample had 21 items, overall M = 5.74; counselors sample had 27 items, M = 5.75). Lastly, these adolescents participated in focus groups in which they discussed their use of technology and challenges in early recovery. This two phase project indicated acceptance of the program concept, as well as provided content ideas from key stakeholders to inform the development of the full program.",

Also, data from Chile suggest that rates of tobacco use between females and males are similar. Researchers have long discussed the role of negative affect on cigarette use among youth. They have proposed that adolescents may use cigarettes to self-medicate and improve their mood. Most of these studies, however, have not explored perceived beliefs associated with cigarette use that may also play a role in explaining the relationship between depressive symptoms and cigarette smoking. In the present study we explored the influence of depressive symptoms and perceived benefits of smoking cigarettes on mood in a sample of 737 chilean youth (mean age = 16,05, range 12 to 25, 54,5% females). Participants completed a self-administered questionnaire from a study that has been examining determinants of cigarette use among adolescents. We explored the relationship using a stepwise regression analyses and entered first demographics, then depressive symptoms variables and finally perceived beliefs about benefits associated with cigarette use. We also included in the model other determinants that have been previously associated with cigarette use as parental smoking and peer influences as control. Our findings suggest that negative affect (Beta = .116, t(566) = 2.607, p = .009) does predict current cigarette smoking. Once we entered perceived benefits, depressive symptoms continues to predict cigarette use (Beta = .108, t(566) = 2.456, p = .014). Perceived benefits on mood of cigarette smoking (Beta = .115, t(556) = 2.543, p = .014) also appear to predict this behavior. Our findings suggest that depressive symptoms influences cigarette use directly and indirectly through the perceived benefits youth perceive have that smoking cigarettes may improve their mood. We also report sex differences and implications of these findings to further understand cigarette use among adolescents.",

Clinical reports and empirical data have highlighted the importance of environmental cues (e.g., the sight or smell of a cigarette) in triggering cravings that may lead to relapse following a quit attempt. This \u2018cue-induced craving\u2019 has been reliably modeled under laboratory conditions, in which smokers exposed to smoking-related cues report higher levels of cigarette cravings than following exposure to neutral cues. Whether or not these craving responses predict smoking cessation failure is a matter of some debate in the scientific literature. Retrospective studies have provided mixed results, and prospective studies are generally lacking. Initial results from our longitudinal study of smokers making a cold-turkey untreated smoking cessation attempt are reported here. Briefly, participants (n = 20, 50% male, 50% female, mean age = 37.5 yrs, 60% African American, 15% Hispanic, 20% Caucasian, mean cigarettes/day = 19.1) were exposed to smoking (unlit cigarette) and neutral (stapler) cues one week prior to their quit date and reported cravings (0-100) before and after each exposure. Exposures were counterbalanced and separated by a 90-second rest. Time until relapse (Mean = 5.6 days) was assessed at 30 days post quit. Findings indicated that higher pre-quit levels of smoking cue-induced cravings predicted quicker time to relapse (p < 0.0006). These preliminary results provide initial support for the validity of modeling cue-induced craving in the laboratory and suggest that cravings triggered by exposure to cues may play an important role in cessation failure.",

In 2007, one or two classes of 10th and 11th grade were randomly selected from the high schools sampled by PPS (probability proportional to size) sampling after all the schools in a large city in Korea were stratified by grade, gender, and region. A total of 743 current smokers among a sample of 4,602 students were analyzed with a self-administered questionnaire. The smokers were defined as those who had smoked at least one cigarette during past one month. The age of smoking onset was measured as the grade when the respondents first tried a cigarette even one or two puffs. The odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by multiple logistic regression analysis and they were adjusted for potential confounders. Compared with those who tried smoking first after entrance into high school, the OR of being a frequent smoker (i.e. those who smoked on 20 days or more during the past one month) among those who tried during middle school period was 2.40 (CI 1.53\u20133.78), that of those who tried smoking during late elementary school period was 3.70 (CI 1.67 \u223c 8.17), that of those who tried smoking early elementary school period or earlier was 3.91 (CI: 1.74 \u223c 8.78). The OR of being a regular smoker (i.e. those who smoked everyday) among those who tried during middle school period was 1.77 (CI: 1.14\u20132.76), that of those who tried smoking during late elementary school period was 2.34 (CI: 1.14 \u223c 4.78), that of those who tried smoking early elementary school period or earlier was 4.83 (CI: 2.19\u223c10.69). The OR of being a heavy smoker (i.e. those who smoked one-half pack or more per day on the average) among those who tried during middle school period was 3.61 (CI: 1.84\u20137.08), that of those who tried smoking during late elementary school period was 6.67 (CI: 2.87\u223c15.50), that of those who tried smoking early elementary school period or earlier was 5.65 (CI: 2.34\u223c13.62).

The SIPP is a short, validated questionnaire to identify distress in cancer patients. Our aim is to test the hypotheses that using the SIPP in physician-patient consultations may prevent underdiagnosis of early distress symptoms resulting in better psychological functioning and quality of life(QoL) in both the short- and long-term. Methods: A cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted. Cancer patients were asked to complete questionnaires measuring sociodemographic characteristics, symptoms of anxiety, depression and psychosocial distress and QoL at baseline before starting radiotherapy (RT) (T1) and post-tests at 3 (T2) and 12 months (T3) after baseline. Results: 569 Cancer patients were included. Preliminary results show at T2 that women of the control groups reported more cognitive dysfunction (p = 0.015) than women of the intervention groups. Patients of the control groups with rectum cancer reported more symptoms of depression (p = 0.039), and psychosocial distress in general (p \u2264 0.030) than the same patients of the interventions groups. The percentage of patients with prostate (p = 0.045) and rectum cancer (p = 0.044) with anxiety were higher in the control groups. At T3, patients of the control groups with breast cancer reported more symptoms of anxiety (p = 0.012) and psychosocial distress (p = 0.048).

The medical records of 3070 patients with a histopathologic diagnosis of malignant neoplasm were reviewed during the 11-years period from 1995 to 2006.Available data suggested a steady increase in prevalence of OSCC during the last decades. .Of 3070 patients with malignancy, 217 cases had oral malignancy. The most common oral malignant neoplasia was OSCC (n = 178, 82%) and then verroucose carcinoma (n = 14, 6.4%). During these years oral SCC was one the most common cancer of the body after esophagus malignancy. Peak incidence of OSCC in both sexes was in the 60-69 years age groups and male-to-female ratio was 1.1:1. The lower lip (22.6%) and mandibular gingiva (22.1%) were most commonly affected area. Hard palate squamous carcinoma was uncommon (1.8%). The most common histological grading was well differentiated SCC (72.5%).The data suggest that high rate of OSCC in females may be due to rising prevalence of tobacco use consumption among females, so a more intensive programme of prevention is necessary",

Patients are seen as active information seekers who require involvement. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to explore whether patients are consistent in their preference for information and involvement in treatment decisions throughout a cancer journey. Methods: Patients (N = 22, Mean = 57 years, 9 men and 13 women) with various cancers, who were in the end of their treatment, participated in semi-structured interviews concerning information needs. Prior to the interview patients were given a brief questionnaire and asked their preference for information given by the clinician (prefer all, only positive or minimal information) and for participating in decision making (prefer to participate or prefer the clinician to make decisions concerning my treatment). After completing the questionnaire patients were interviewed focusing on the patients experiences of information. The interviews were analysed according to the principles of thematic analysis. Results: Eighteen out of 22 patients reported that they wanted all available information and to participate in decisions about treatment. However, during the interviews some patients expressed different attitudes towards level of information and involvement. Some patients experienced changes in treatment and chose to let the clinician decide the treatment. There were also divergent statements concerning the amount of desired information, which could be related to the situational aspects of information needs. Furthermore, patients seemed to prefer positive information from clinicians in the early stages of treatment. Conclusions: Even though patients view themselves as individuals who want a high level of information regarding their cancer and want to be involved in treatment decisions, this study reveals some discrepancy between patients beliefs and their behaviours, which can be influenced by various situational factors.",

However, much less is known about the natural course of these symptoms throughout the cancer treatment trajectory. Also, the contribution of medical factors such as cancer site, stage and treatments in explaining changes in these symptoms has yet to be established. As part of a larger research, this study investigated longitudinal changes of these symptoms in patients scheduled to undergo surgery for cancer (n = 828). The patients completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Insomnia Severity Index, the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory, and a pain questionnaire developed by our research team at six time points: at baseline (T1), as well as 2 (T2), 6 (T3), 10 (T4), 14 (T5) and 18 (T6) months later. Analyses of variance showed significant reductions of depression, anxiety and insomnia levels over time (ps < .0001), which were mostly marked between T1 and T3. Fatigue levels were fairly stable, whereas pain increased slowly but significantly over time (p < .0001). Prostate cancer patients had significantly lower levels of anxiety, insomnia, fatigue and pain (ps < .001 or less) compared to patients with other types of cancer, but no significant differences were found across cancer stages over time. Patients having received chemotherapy were those displaying the greatest levels of insomnia and fatigue (ps < .05 or less), whereas patients treated by surgery only (no radiation or hormone therapy, or chemotherapy) were those displaying the lowest levels of anxiety and insomnia (ps < .001 or less) over time. In summary, cancer patients reported an overall decrease in depression, anxiety and insomnia symptoms, stable fatigue and an increase in pain over the 18-month period following surgery. Results also revealed some differences across cancer sites and treatment regimens received. Further longitudinal studies are needed in order to identify additional factors associated with changes in cancer-related symptoms over time.",

PA and SE groups were further subdivided into groups fed a high fat diet (PA-HF and SE-HF) and normal diet (PA-ND and SE-ND). Mice allowed access to a running wheel ran approximately 12 km/day, and displayed expected decreases in body weight and body fat compared to mice without access to running wheels (SE). Cells were collected from peripheral blood (posterior vena cava) and peritoneum (by lavage). Using flow cytometry, cell numbers (CD11b status), and both basal and chemically-induced activation states (CD11b signal/monocyte) were determined. For HF diet mice, regardless of exercise, the number of circulating monocytes was higher than in similarly-treated ND mice; the fraction of monocytes in the total white blood cell population was 6.4% vs. 4.6% (PA-HF and PA-ND, p < 0.001) and 5.9% vs 4.5% (SE-HF and SE-ND, p < 0.001). PA did not affect monocyte numbers in any group, but PA-ND mice had a 20% higher basal monocyte activity level than PA-HF mice (p = 0.006). On the other hand, HF mouse blood monocytes were approximately threefold more responsive to activation compared to sedentary counterparts (SE, p = 0.023; PA, p = 0.002).",

Using a community-based sample of low-income mothers (N = 77), the present study sought to elucidate psychosocial factors associated with mothers\u2019 intentions to vaccinate their age-eligible daughters against HPV. Thirty-five percent of the sample had never heard of HPV. Knowledge about the virus, including its prevalence and relation to cervical cancer, did not relate to mothers\u2019 intention to vaccinate their daughters within the next 1 to 2 years; however, intention did relate to attitudes and beliefs about the vaccine. Results from chi-square analyses indicated that intention to vaccinate ones daughter was associated with the belief that the vaccine could prevent future problems for their daughter (p < .001), wanting to do what their daughter\u2019s pediatrician recommends regarding the HPV vaccine (p = .01), and that the vaccine could benefit both men and women (p = .04). Intending to vaccinate ones daughter was also associate with disagreement with the belief that vaccines in general can be dangerous (p = .05) and lower educational attainment (p = .05). Findings provide insight and are discussed in relation to uptake of the HPV vaccine within this high-risk population.",

The intervention consisted of an 8-week mindfulness-training course. Participants expressed a number of perceived positive effects of the mindfulness training including increased calm, enhanced sleep quality, more energy, less physical pain, and increased well-being. Some of the participants experienced no effect from the training. Both negative and positive effects of the specific mindfulness training exercises were expressed. Components that were described as of particular importance were the non-judgmental and accepting approach guiding the program and the instructors, the influence of the group process and sharing experiences with patients with similar experiences, and the emphasis on increased awareness of the present moment. The implications for these results on our understanding of the mechanisms behind mindfulness training and positive outcomes are discussed.",

This study examined two key aspects of communication: self efficacy for symptom communication and holding back from disclosing cancer related concerns. The sample included post-menopausal breast cancer survivors taking adjuvant hormonal therapy (N = 35). Participants were on average 60.6 years old (SD 7.4), mostly Caucasian (91%), and over half had at least a college education. Regression analyses were conducted to examine the degree to which self-efficacy for symptom communication and holding back predicted measures of symptoms and adjustment. These analyses controlled for demographic and medical variables that were significantly correlated with outcomes. Results indicated that holding back about discussing cancer related concerns, but not self-efficacy for symptom communication, was a significant predictor of menopausal symptoms, fatigue, intimacy, and functional well-being. Specifically, holding back was a significant predictor of physical menopausal symptoms (t(30) = 4.05, p = 0.000), fatigue (t(31) = 3.47, p = 0.002), intimacy (t(30) = \u22122.52, p = 0.017), and functional well-being (t(31) = \u22123.77, p = 0.001). Patients who reported a greater tendency to hold back from discussing their cancer related concerns had higher levels of menopausal symptoms (such as difficulty sleeping or a decrease in physical strength) and fatigue and lower levels of intimacy and functional well being. Taken together these findings suggest that holding back from disclosing cancer-related concerns is a significant and consistent predictor of symptoms and adjustment to breast cancer in women taking adjuvant hormonal therapy to prevent recurrence. These findings raise the possibility that interventions designed to address symptom communication might be helpful to those patients who are prone to holding back from discussing their cancer-related concerns.",

Both younger and older BCA survivors endorsed significant levels of generalized psychological distress, as measured by the BSI, which was characterized primarily by rumination, anxiety, and hostility. Beck Depression Inventory-2 scores indicated that the sample, on average, experienced mild to moderate levels of depressive symptoms with younger women tending to be more symptomatic than the older women, although the difference did not reach significance (t = 1.68, p = .09).

Recent literature, however, suggests that it is not simply received support that influences psychosocial adjustment but rather the type of support received (i.e., preferred or non-preferred) that may play the most significant role in the psychosocial outcome for women with breast cancer. The primary aim of this study is to better articulate the role of received support and its impact on psychosocial adjustment. We hypothesized that non-preferred support functions as an additional stressor over and above the stress of life threatening illness and, as such, adversely impacts psychosocial adjustment. Conversely, the receipt of preferred support was hypothesized to be positively associated with indicators of healthy psychosocial adjustment.",

The key challenges of this study lay in measuring and incorporating affect into the assessment of risk perception and screening behavior, and in finding and recruiting women at high risk of ovarian cancer in the general population. The first challenge was met through developing a scale to access the experience of cancer among friends and relatives. Incorporating both emotion and cognition into a model of perceived risk and screening suggested use of the heuristic processing model and Common-Sense Model of Self-Regulation of Health and Illness as theoretical frameworks. The second challenge led us to conduct the study in an HMO population which provided a defined population setting from which women at high risk could be recruited. The study was composed of a baseline and one-year follow-up survey. From a list of 55,887 managed care enrollees, we conducted a telephone eligibility screening of 20,483 randomly-selected women (screening rate 36.7%), with the aim of oversampling women at high risk. Of 16,720 women (81.6%) deemed eligible for the study, we selected 3,307 for interview, completing 2,524 interviews (response rate 76.3%). A one-year follow-up among 1,910 women (response rate 77.7%) who were interviewed at baseline provided information on change in perceived risk and screening behavior. The strengths of this study include a theoretically-based design, a large, racially diverse managed care population, and novel questions designed to assess the experience of cancer among friends or relatives.",

However, it is also an opportunity for personal growth(Jim & Jacobsen., 2008). Evaluating the long-term effects of cancer and its treatment, we have to investigate the impact of cancer in life domains. The purpose of this study was to explore the impact of the cancer in Japanese childhood cancer patients after discharge. Subjects were 25 childhood cancer patients attending the pediatric outpatient clinics (8 male and 17 female, mean age at survey = 17.0 \u00b1 3.6 yrs, mean age at diagnosis = 8.8 \u00b1 4.1 yrs). Approximately 18 patients had leukemia and 4 each suffered from malignant lymphoma and bone tumor, respectively. They were asked to participate in a semi-structured interview regarding the impact of the cancer after discharge from medical treatment. The data was analyzed with the content analysis, chi-square test, and correspondence analysis. A total of 11 attributes were extracted and categorized as follows: changes due to the cancer (N = 24) and perceptions of the cancer(N = 14). The attributes indicated by many of the participants were \u201chaving cancer brought my family closer together(N = 14)\u201d, \u201cI have met various people(N = 12)\u201d, \u201ccancer has been the precious experience of my life(N=11)\u201d, \u201cI wonder why I got cancer(N = 9)\u201d. Some attributes of positive changes due to the cancer and perceptions of the cancer were statistically significant differences among age. This study identified the important components of the impact of the cancer in Japanese childhood cancer patients after their discharge. Most patients thought that good things have come out of having had cancer. In addition, older patients have more diversified views of the cancer than younger patients because they have had many problems and benefits.",

The purpose of this study was to describe the treatment, healthcare utilization, and morbidity of children with asthma in Puerto Rico. This phase of the study involved the administration of a parent interview, spirometry and physician examination, in order to learn more about medical care of children with asthma. Evaluations were conducted in 2001 on a sample of 300 5-10 year-old children enrolled in public schools in San Juan, including both children whose parents reported they had asthma (n = 190) and presumed healthy children (n = 110). The mean age was 6 years old (SD = .9 years) and 50.2% were females. Among those with asthma, 32% were prescribed anti-inflammatory medications, with 49% receiving only bronchodilators, and 18% not receiving any asthma medications. Using NHANES criteria, 46% had mild and 54% had moderate-severe asthma; of the latter, 13% of parents reported not having any medication prescriptions for their children. Children with asthma and those without did not differ on environmental risk factors or on forced vital capacity (FVC) measures. However, parents of children with asthma, compared to those without, reported they had significantly more symptoms of asthma in the last 14 days (p = .02) and missed more school in the last two months due to asthma (p = .02). Mean number of doctor visits, ED visits, and hospitalizations for asthma in the past year were 2.72, 1.64, and 0.42, respectively. Forty-one percent of parents of children with asthma reported that they did not have written instructions for taking medications; 96% were not told to use a peak flow meter; 82% did not have a written care plan for asthma care at school; and 72% did not having a written plan for environmental triggers. Of those prescribed nebulizer treatments, 51% reported not adhering to recommendations. Sixty-seven percent of those who were prescribed medication reported not adhering because of concerns regarding potential side effects. These results indicate that in 2001 children in San Juan were not being optimally treated for asthma. Given the high prevalence and morbidity of asthma in Puerto Rico, there is a need for educational efforts to improve treatment practices.",

This hypothesis has not been tested in an immigrant population. The current study assessed the effects of perceived social support and problem-focused and emotion-focused coping on CVR to stress among Chinese immigrants in the New York City area. Method: First generation Chinese immigrants (N = 150; Mean Age = 53 years old; 86 Females, Average Length of Stay in the United States = 20 years) were recruited from the New York Downtown Hospital in Chinatown. Following the study description and informed consent procedures, participants completed questionnaires which assessed social support and their use of problem focused and emotion focused coping strategies. Following an 8-minute adaptation period, participants recalled a stress-provoking event related to their immigration experience in a semi-structured interview format. Recovery was monitored for 20 minutes and participants were debriefed. Blood pressure and heart rate were monitored at 2 minute intervals during baseline and recovery, and 1 minute intervals during the interview. Result: Hierarchical multiple regression analysis revealed that the interaction perceived social support and emotion-focused coping is associated with low baseline SBP, \u03b2 = -.18, t = -2.19, p < .03. However, perceived social support and emotion-focused coping is associated with higher SBP during provocation, \u03b2 = .23, t = 2.70, p < .01. Conclusion: Availability of social support is reassuring when coupled with the use of emotion-focused coping, and when the situation demands low coping resources (as during baseline). However, under conditions of stress where the demand for coping resources is high (e.g., during stress provocation), perceived social support and the use of emotion-focused coping does not help and may actually suggest an increase in CVR to stress. This may be related to the Chinese value of collectivism, which may manifest itself through an unwillingness to burden others with personal needs.",

Depressive symptoms are also associated with unhealthy lifestyle behaviors and cardiovascular risk factors. We examined whether lifestyle factors mediated relations of depressive symptoms to cardiovascular risk factors in 205 healthy, community-dwelling older adults (55% male; mean age = 66 years). Participants underwent a medical history, physical examination, blood chemistries, exercise treadmill testing with maximal oxygen consumption (Vo2max), an oral glucose tolerance test, clinical assessment of blood pressure and body mass index (BMI), completion of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and assessment of smoking status and number of alcoholic drinks consumed per week. Primary outcome variables included systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, glucose levels at 0 and 120 minutes, waist circumference, triglycerides, and total, HDL, and LDL cholesterol. Potential mediators assessed were number of alcoholic drinks consumed per week, smoking status, Vo2max, and BMI. Multiple regression analyses adjusted for age, education, sex, race, and use of antihypertensives revealed a significant positive association between depression and triglyceride levels (b = 24.2, p = .009), waist circumference (b = 9.56, p < .001), and BMI (b = 3.03, p = .001). Subsequent regression models testing for possible mediation indicated that the relation of BDI to triglycerides was mediated by BMI. Thus, in healthy older adults, depressive symptoms are associated with increased body mass, waist circumference, and triglyceride levels, and body mass mediates the relation of depressive symptoms to triglyceride levels. Obesity may be an important mechanism by which depressive symptoms influence cardiovascular risk in older adults.",

The purpose of this study was to characterize the psychosocial, cognitive, physical, and demographic profiles of patients with COPD and IPF with the goal of better understanding similarities and differences among patients with these pulmonary disorders. Patients with COPD (N = 16; Female = 5) and IPF (N = 15; Female = 5) were recruited from The Ohio State University outpatient pulmonary clinics. Participants completed three visits over the course of twelve months and at each session completed a series of questionnaires and cognitive function tests. At baseline and twelve months, participants completed pulmonary evaluations. IPF patients were significantly older (M = 69.3) than COPD patients (M = 58.7) and had better pulmonary functioning (FEV1 % predicted = 75.7% in IPF vs. 44.2% in COPD). All analyses of psychological functioning and cognitive performance were conducted controlling for age. COPD patients indicated significantly more symptoms of depression (p < .01; CES-D) and anxiety (p < .05; BAI) than did IPF patients. COPD patients also reported less social support (p < .01, PSSS). In addition, COPD patients indicated significantly poorer emotional quality of life, as reflected in the Mental Component Score of the SF-36. However, no differences were observed between COPD patients and IPF patients on the Physical Component Score of the SF-36 or in symptoms of breathlessness, sleep quality, or cognitive performance. Thus, although perceptions of physical quality of life and breathlessness are similar among COPD and IPF patients, patients with COPD indicate significantly greater symptoms of emotional distress and poorer emotional quality of life than patients with IPF. Heightened distress among patients with COPD is important to consider in treatment of patients. In addition, further evaluation of disease-related processes and biological differences between COPD and IPF patients is needed to understand mechanisms that may explain the observed differences.",

This lack of service use has significant implications considering that mental health (MH) problems during childhood can lead to difficulties later in life. Despite increased efforts to tailor MH services to the needs of each consumer, ethnocultural disparities in access to and use of these services continue to abound (Yamada & Brekke, 2008). Findings suggest that ethnic minority populations have a higher unmet need than Non-Hispanic Whites (e.g., Diala et al, 2002). However, efforts to explain disparities in MH services have been limited. Researchers have identified several variables that influence individuals to utilize mental health services such as income, ethnicity, and attitudes (e.g., Cepeda-Benito & Short, 1998; Turner & Liew, in press). Obasi & Leong (2009) hypothesize that it is also important to note that group difference exists, and it is imperative that future research investigate cultural variables (acculturation, traditions, etc.). Previous research has found some ethnic minority groups use coping sources (i.e., friends, family) and practices (i.e., family, social, and religious) that are more consistent with their cultural beliefs instead of those more consistent with traditional MH services (e.g., Harrison et al., 2004; McMiller & Weisz, 1996). The purpose of the current study is to examine to role of cultural identity, religiosity, perceived behavioral control (PBC), and attitudes on utilization of MH service among European Americans and non-European Americans. Participants were 150 caregivers (89% female) recruited from the Southwest United States. Mean age of participants was 34.4 years old. Participants completed the following measures a demographic questionnaire, the Parental Attitudes Toward Psychological Services Inventory (PATPSI; Turner, 2006), and self-reported their cultural identity, religiosity, and likelihood of mental health service use. Results indicated that both attitudes and PBC were positively related to utilization, and participants\u2019 ratings of cultural identity and religiosity were not correlated with utilization. When examining group differences between European Americans and non-European Americans mean differences were only noted for perceived behavioral control. European Americans reported feeling more control over their ability to seek services if warranted. Finally, both perceived behavioral control and attitudes independently predicted utilization of mental health services. Implications for future research and applications to families will be discussed.",

Participants were 1111 children with a mean age of 10,13 years (SD = 1,29), 50,3% boys and 49,7% girls. The level of parental conflict was assessed by a five-point scale, in which children estimated the current relationship between his/her parents as very good, good, fair, poor, very poor. Quality of life was evaluated using the Child Health and Illness Profile-Child Edition that examines the children perceived health in five dimensions: satisfaction (with self and health), comfort (emotional and physical symptoms and limitations), resilience (positive activities that promote health), risk avoidance (risky behaviors that influence future health) and achievement (social expectations in school and with peers). Results show a positive and significant relation in all dimensions, indicating that the more conflictive is the relationship between parents, the worse the quality of life (satisfaction: F = 26.52, p = .00; comfort: F = 8.44, p = .00; resilience: F = 30.45, p = .00; achievement: F = 16.39, p = .00; risk avoidance: F = 13.77, p = .00). Post hoc comparisons showed that significant differences were found between children who perceived the relationship between parents very good and those that considered it as good, fair, poor and very poor. However, there were no significant differences between the other groups. The results highlight the importance of the child\u2019s perception of a good family atmosphere and the absence of parental conflict for optimal health-related quality of life.",

Objective: To investigate the relationship between somatization symptoms and psychosocial problems in children and adolescents receiving treatment in a pediatric Emergency Department (ED). Method: Three-hundred and fifty-eight patients (48.6% male, 51.4% female) were recruited from the ED at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles. Patients ranged from 8 to 18 years of age (M = 12.8, SD = 2.9). Investigators conducted an anonymous, cross-sectional, multi-informant (child and caregiver) study. Pearson\u2019s product moment correlation coefficient was used to analyze relationships between somatization (pain/weakness, gastrointestinal, and pseudoneurological symptoms) and psychosocial problems (attention, internalizing, externalizing, and total psychosocial problems). Results: Pain/weakness symptoms were significantly correlated with attention (r = .292, p < .01), externalizing (r = .242, p < .001), internalizing (r = .383, p < .001), and total psychosocial problems (r = .452, p < .001). Gastrointestinal symptoms also had a significant positive correlation with attention (r = .304, p < .001), externalizing (r = .242, p < .001), internalizing (r = .383, p < .001), and total psychosocial problems (r = .452, p < .001). Pesudoneurological symptoms also had a positive significant relationship with attention (r = .357, p < .001), externalizing (r = .211, p < .001), internalizing (r = .408, p < .001), and total psychosocial problems (r = .455, p < .001). Conclusion: All measures of somatization were associated with psychosocial problems. This demonstrates the importance of screening children and adolescents for somatization symptoms. The pediatric ED can be a useful setting to screen for somatization in order to identify children and adolescent who need referral for mental health assessment and treatment.",

It means a high school with correspondence courses, and many students enter the school not because of the economical issue but the interpersonal issue. Since most of full-time high schools in Japan make much account of attendance in junior high school for admission, many students who have experienced school refusal select a school with correspondence courses. Thus, the schools have a lot of sensitive students who are easy to have psychosomatic problems, and the teachers need to pay attention to students\u2019 early psychosomatic complaints in order to prevent the bigger educational problems such as dropout. This is the critical issue in Japanese \u201cTsushinsei\u201d high schools with correspondence courses.",

Results of a recent meta-analysis revealed that perceptual-organizational abilities and visual-spatial functioning are domains of particular vulnerability. There have also been several reports of lower visual-motor drawing ability among children with complex congenital heart disease. Multiple medical and surgical variables have been recognized as impacting neurodevelopmental outcome for these children. Very few studies have specifically examined neurodevelopmental outcome for children with ventricular septal defects (VSDs), which are among the most common congenital heart problems with a rate of approximately one out of 500 births. This population is generally expected to have excellent medical outcome and typical development. As part of a larger study examining mid-term neurodevelopmental outcome for children VSDs surgically repaired in infancy, visual-motor ability was assessed among 31 children ages 3 to 16 years with a commonly used graphomotor drawing task. Whereas many areas of cognitive functioning, including full-scale IQ (M = 95.6, SD = 15.3, p = .12) were comparable to the general population (M = 100, SD = 15), visual-motor ability was an area of weakness (M = 87.9, SD = 14.2, p < .001). Additional results showed that household income and the presence of a comorbid medical condition were significant predictors of visual-motor ability. Specifically, lower income was associated with lower visual-motor scores (p = .007). The presence of a comorbid medical condition was also associated with lower visual-motor ability (p = .019). Twenty-two additional patient and surgical factors were also examined, with no other variables statistically related to visual-motor ability. This study shows that the weaknesses in visual-motor ability observed among children with more complex, cyanotic congenital heart disease are also found among children with repaired VSD. Furthermore, surgical factors do not appear to affect visual-motor ability among children with VSD.",

A sample of 166 girls and 47 boys, aged 15-18 years, was recruited from public high schools in Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, state of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. The main outcome measures used were Figure Rating Scale, Lipp Stress Symptoms Inventory and The Ways of Coping Questionnaire. Descriptive analyses were performed. Correlational analyses tested the associations of body image, stress and coping with sex and BMI. Logistic regression analyses were conducted for each of the 8 coping strategies. The confidence intervals used were 95%. The results revealed that both boys and girls were dissatisfied with their body size and the majority overestimated it. The exception was the overweight adolescents that had significantly negative body distortion. Girls showed more body distortion than boys. The correlation between body dissatisfaction and body distortion was negative and moderate (r = \u2212 .65). A large proportion (55,86%) of adolescents are found to have significant stress symptoms. A greater proportion of females (61,40%) than males (36,20%) are found to have stress. Adolescents with stress had more probability using confrontive coping (OR = 3,14), distancing (OR = 2,09), seeking social support (OR = 3,33), self-controlling (OR = 2,06), accepting responsibility (OR = 4,40) and escape-avoidance (OR = 3,17) in a situation that involves body discomfort. Girls significantly employed more self-controlling than boys. In conclusion, negative body image perception and stress were observed in the present sample. Adolescents with stress used more coping strategies.",

The results of the ego identity status scales demonstrated that the subjects were distributed in identity statuses as follows: 15 identity achievements and 46 identity diffusions. The tree drawings of two groups were compared by chi-square tests. As a result of chi-square tests, we observed that identity-achieved individuals who drew a trunk at the center in the first picture with consecutive lines also drew a trunk of medium thickness in the second picture. On the other hand, identity-diffused individuals who drew a trunk on the left side or the right side with a considerably wide trunk base in the first picture also drew a trunk with discontinuous lines and a thin trunk in the second picture. These results reveal that the uncertainty and the conflicts of their self-images were expressed in the twice-application method of the tree drawing technique.",

Furthermore, recent advances in social media channels now serve as an extension of one\u2019s social network and sphere of influence.

Reflecting the child\u2019s well-being across multiple domains, QOL captures well the broad meaning of health espoused by WHO. This research therefore examined whether there are race/ethnic disparities in QOL. A multi-site study enrolled 4,824 5th grade children from one of the three major race/ethnic groups in the U.S. (Hispanic = 38%, African American = 36%, White = 26%). Children reported their QOL with the PedsQL providing scores for their physical and psychosocial domains, as well as with instruments to measure self-worth and social well-being. Parents rated children\u2019s overall health status and provided demographic information on the household. Complex sampling analysis revealed non-White children reporting significantly lower QOL in all domains than White children. However, after controlling for SES differences (parent\u2019s education, income), these race/ethnic disparities remained only in the domains of school, self-worth, satisfaction with appearance, and social well-being. After also controlling for family contextual differences (family structure, English proficiency), disparities remained in the domain of social well-being only. Findings suggest that disparities across race/ethnicity in children are, mainly, products of sociodemographic differences, rather than being endemic to minority race/ethnic groups. As one of the first studies examining racial/ethnic disparities in QOL of children in the general population, this study provides a basis for further exploration of contextual influences on the QOL experienced by children.",

            "text": "Several researchers have found that teenage pregnancy is associated with worst educational outcomes among adolescents and that girls who have a child early in life, are less likely to graduate from high school (Molina et al., 2004). Other researchers have proposed that educational expectations do actually predict educational outcomes among youth. They have found that having higher educational expectations is associated with higher educational outcomes later in life (Mello, 2008). However, researchers have not examined how educational expectations may be associated with adolescents\u2019 self-reported sexual behaviors. Some researchers suggest that there might be a self-selection process in which adolescents who do worst in school and do not have plans to continue further in their education may also engage in unprotected sexual behavior, putting them at higher risk of becoming pregnant. In the present study we examined the relationship between educational expectations and goals and different sexual behavior outcomes in a sample of 829 Mexican youth. Participants included 829 adolescents between the ages of 14 and 17 (mean 15.18, S.D. = 0.68, 55,4% females) part of an HIV and STDs intervention program. We examine this relationship using time 1 data. Participants completed a self-reported questionnaire that asked about their sexual behavior and explore different psychosocial predictors of sexual behavior. Using a regression analyses we examined whether having plans to complete high school and continue their education predicted ever had sex, age in which girls and boys should have sex for the first time, plans to use condoms when having sex, and perceive that condoms may be effective to protect them of STDs and HIV. Our findings suggest that plans to finish high school predicts only perceptions that condoms may be effective to protect against HIV (t = 2,06, p < 0.05), and not any of the other outcomes. Because we had very few participants who reported ever having sex (9,5%), we probably did not have enough power to find further differences. We explored how these variables may predict their sexual behavior at the 12 months follow-up, when 16% of participants reported ever having sex, and we found that having plans to attend college predicted not having sex among adolescents (Exp (B) = 0.358, p < 0.01). Implications of these findings for intervention and practice are discussed.",

The activation level are thought to be an important mediator of the social skill and the depression. Obata et al. (2010) found that the difficulty in the control of social anxiety lead to the inhibition of social activity and the increase of depressive mood in Japanese high school students. We hypothesized that the mechanism for exacerbation of depression may be explained by the behavioral activation and social skill, and these relationships differed with the level of social anxiety. Method: Questionnaires were conducted with 347 Japanese adolescents (16.0 \u00b1 0.6 years). Questionnaires were composed of Depression Self-Rating Scale for Children (DSRS; Birleson, 1981), Assertiveness Skill Scale for High school students (ASS; Takaki et al., 2002), and Behavioral Activation for Depression Scale (BADS; Martell et al., 2001). Higher score group (n = 50) and lower score group (n = 50) were extracted in subjects on \u201csocial anxiety(reverse coded)\u201d in ASS. Data analyses were tested using correlation analysis to examine relationship of between depression , social skill, and behavioral activation, using SPSS 16.0. Main Results: \u201cActivation (reverse coded)\u201d in BADS was significantly associated with \u201cpositive interpersonal entry\u201d in ASS(higher score group: r = \u2212.37, p < .01; lower score group: r = \u2212.26, .n.s.).

The self-report questionnaire was distribution to both type of schools to student age 11-16 years old. The tools of this study are Thai version of state-trait anxiety of Spielberger\u2019s; the Strength and Difficulty Questionnaire (SDQ); emotional quotient (EQ).

Mean age of sample is 13.5 years old, 42.24% is male, and 48.51% reported that they are also study in the Sunday Buddhism School. The model by stepwise selection presents that trait anxiety, pro-social, self-control, ability to deal with problem, self-esteem, life-satisfaction and interaction between age and emotional problem, the adjusted R2 is 60.55% (p-value < 0.0001). The increasing one unit of trait anxiety, self-control, self-esteem and life-satisfaction increases 0.52, 0.10, 0.11 and 0.13 standardize unit of state anxiety, the higher standardize score of ability to deal with problem decrease 0.07 standardize unit of state anxiety. The interaction of emotional and age reduce the standardize score of state anxiety. The higher emotional problem score increased 0.27 standardize unit of state anxiety while age reduce 0.01 unit of state anxiety (p-value < 0.05). The gender and Sunday Buddhism school included into the model to control potential confounding factor, female has higher state anxiety score than male, the student in Sunday Buddhism School have lower state anxiety than non-student (p-value > 0.05). The student with high score of self-control, self-esteem and life-satisfaction have higher level of state anxiety which may cause from they are try to be the best which make them stress.

Qualitative methods can better evaluate if the activities funded by new global health actors are best aligned to meet the objective of delivering high value care to patients.

In its aim and scope, it bears special relation to the applied fields of Behavioral Medicine and Health Psychology. Expanding upon a recent bibliometric analysis (Schui & Krampen, in press), we trace the impact, Positive Psychology had on these larger fields by evaluating the corresponding literature found in the PsycINFO database. Analyses comprise a time span starting with the year 2000 (since when numerous contributions on Positive Psychology are available) until present day. Results show, that even by employing a wide bibliometric definition of Positive Psychology, the overlap with Behavioral Medicine is minimal (also because documents are rarely indexed as such), while that with Health Psychology is considerably larger (ca. 9%). Further analyses of the overlapping literature include temporal changes of the overlap since year 2000 (it was higher in the early 2000\u2019s), the authors\u2019 national institutional affiliations, multiple authorships, most frequently used journals, publication types, methodology employed, and the semantic networks opened up by title words and APA-index terms, which are presented as text clouds. In sum, bibliometric results point to a potential for improvement when it comes to establishing Positive Psychology approaches within Health Psychology, and especially Behavioral Medicine. That potential should be realized, since the relationship of Positive Psychology to the health-related fields is already stronger than to other psychological disciplines.",

Thirty obese adolescents (female = 20, BMI \u2265 95th percentile; 10-16 years of age) were randomly assigned to either a moderate (HRR = 40\u201355%) or vigorous (HRR = 60\u201375%) supervised 12-week exercise training program. Satisfaction was measured through self-reported questionnaires assessing satisfaction with outcome progress and current state. Enjoyment was measured using the PACES self-report questionnaire. Adherence was assessed as a percentage of sessions attended. Repeated measures ANOVAs showed no significant time x group interaction effects (all ps > .05). Significant time effects in the expected direction were found for satisfaction with outcome progress (F(1, 26) = 17.62, \u03b72 = .40, p < .001), satisfaction with current state (F(1, 26) = 5.97, \u03b72 = .18, p < .05) and enjoyment (F(1, 26) = 9.4, \u03b72 = .27, p < .005). No adherence differences were found between intensity groups (M for vigorous = 86%, SD = .09; M moderate = 85%, SD = .14). These data indicate that exercise intensity does not adversely affect satisfaction, enjoyment or adherence. Practical implications of these findings will be discussed.",

Emphasis of this program is placed on choosing healthy foods and making positive behavior modifications. Several methods of data collection were used for this project. All athletes were given a validated knowledge and dietary practices survey that was based on the health belief model, the EAT 26 survey which screens for disordered eating behaviors was distributed, and body composition was also determined using a Tanita scale. All data was entered into SPSS 16.0. Statistical analysis was conducted using t-tests and descriptive statistics. Changes in baseline knowledge, dietary practices, and body composition data will be reported and discussed. Formative evaluation which includes adherence to program guidelines and recommendations for program improvement will also be reported.

Project Ignite is a nutrition education program designed to educate 250 collegiate athletes about eating for sport performance and avoiding injury associated with poor nutritional intake. Additionally, data such as body mass index, body-fat (measured with a Tanita scale), and knowledge and perceptions of sport nutrition was measured. All participants of this program completed the EAT 26 survey which has been found to be valid in measuring disordered eating. This presentation will outline 3 case studies of collegiate athletes with disordered eating. For confidentiality reasons all names of participants have been changed. Case studies will include 2 athletes with extremely low body-fat (4% for female; 2% male) and 1 athlete with extremely high body-fat (50% female). These case examples will discuss the need for health and nutrition policies that guide student-athlete participation in their respective sports when disordered eating is present. Moreover, there is a need for health education regarding proper nutrition for the athlete, coaches, team physicians, and athletic trainers. Further, many universities do not have polices that mandate when a collegiate athlete should be evaluated to determine the extent of any existing disordered eating behaviors or health conditions associated with their nutritional intake. When it is determined that an athlete has disordered eating behaviors or health risks there should be policies in place to determine player eligibility.",

Participants included 349 youth, aged 9 \u2013 17 years (79.9% Caucasian, 71.3% lived with two biological parents, M SES = 46.24), recruited from endocrinology clinics in two major metropolitan areas. The 24-Hour Diabetes Care Interview was administered to assess specific disease care behaviors and a test of diabetes knowledge was used to measure parent and child disease information. Independent sample t-tests confirmed commonly reported ethnic differences in A1c, where African American youth had significantly higher A1c levels (M = 8.84%) compared with Caucasian youth (M = 8.25%). African American youth reported poorer disease care behaviors including fewer intensive insulin regimens, less frequent blood glucose monitoring and poorer dietary composition of carbohydrates and fats. Additionally, African American youth and parents had lower disease knowledge scores than Caucasian youth and parents. However, hierarchical multiple regression analyses that controlled for confounding influences of SES and parent marital status revealed most disease care differences attributed to ethnicity were better explained by SES. The only significant ethnic group difference that remained was a difference in diabetes knowledge; ethnicity explained an additional 8.3% variance and emerged as a significant predictor of diabetes knowledge (\u03b2 = \u2212.308, p < .001) after controlling for SES and marital status. Results may inform future interventions for youth at risk of poor metabolic control; lower SES families may benefit from careful attention to diabetes knowledge to facilitate successful implementation of diabetes care.",

It contains three lower-rank factors (divided into high and low groups on the basis of one\u2019s mean factor score) including \u201cdissatisfaction with body plumpness,\u201d \u201cdissatisfaction with other people\u2019s opinions of one\u2019s own body,\u201d and \u201cdissatisfaction with one\u2019s own face.\u201d AEBS comprises three lower-rank factors including \u201cuncontrollable intake of excessive food,\u201d (e.g., binge eating) \u201cpurging behavior,\u201d and \u201ccontrol of food intake\u201d (e.g., diet behavior). According to the BMI classification, based on that of the Japan Society for the Study of Obesity (1994), 102 subjects (18.41%) were thin, 406 (73.29%) were normal, and 46 (8.30%) were obese. First, we examined the relation between the BMI and the BIDS and AEBS factor scores; a single-factor analysis of variance of factor scores was conducted on each BMI classification. The results showed a significant main effect of BMI\u2019s class in all the factor scores excluding the \u201cuncontrollable intake of excessive food\u201d and \u201cpurging behavior\u201d factor scores, and we can infer that the latter two factors have little relation to the BMI levels. Thus, abnormal eating behavior that resembles an eating disorder might have little relation to the actual body type. Second, we examined the relation between the \u201cuncontrollable intake of excessive food,\u201d \u201cpurging behavior,\u201d and the BIDS factor scores; a t test on the former two factor scores from among the BIDS lower-rank factor group was conducted. The results indicated high scorers on these two factors in the high \u201cdissatisfaction with body plumpness\u201d group (t(531) = |5.08|, p < .01; t(531) = |2.14|, p < .05); hence, purging behavior might not be only a consciousness of other people\u2019s opinions of one\u2019s own body but also the problem of self.

Depression and insulin resistance (IR) each are significant predictors of the development and progression of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and are evident years in advance of the frank hyperglycemia of diabetes. Depression is associated with factors that promote IR including inactivity, obesity, and hypercortisolemia. The purpose of the present study was to test the hypothesis of depression-associated insulin resistance (DAIR). Seventy-six persons (mean age 52 \u00b1 10 years, 76% female, 39% Caucasian) with a provisional diagnosis of T2DM (i.e., not taking antihyperglycemic medication and meeting ADA criteria per study OGTT) were enrolled. Major depressive disorder (MDD) was diagnosed using DSM-IV criteria. Depression symptom severity was assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Sixteen patients could be classified as depressed (i.e. DSM-IV MDD and and a BDI score \u226516) and 52 could be classified as non-depressed (i.e. no DSM-IV MDD and a BDI score <16). IR was derived from anthropometric measurements [body mass index (BMI)] and OGTT measurements [HOMA-IR, area under the curve for insulin (AUC-I)]. IR was uniformly higher but not statistically different in the depressed vs. nondepressed groups (BMI: 41.4 \u00b1 6.6 vs 37.5 \u00b1 8.4 kg*m-2, p = 0.09; HOMA-IR: 8.0 \u00b1 5.6 vs 5.6 \u00b1 2.8,p = 0.13; AUC-I: 180 \u00b1 123 vs 135 \u00b1 65 uU*mL-1*2 h, p = 0.20). In regression analyses with baseline glucose as covariate, depression symptom severity was related to BMI (p = 0.02) and trended toward prediction of HOMA-IR, and AUC-I (p = 0.13 and p = 0.10, respectively). These preliminary data support the plausibility of the DAIR hypothesis and the need for larger and more definitive studies.",

Although psychosocial factors have been suggested to affect eating behavior, most previous studies were either in laboratory settings or with recalled self-reports. Therefore, valid relationships between food intake and psychosocial factors in daily life have not been fully understood. Recently, ecological momentary assessment (EMA), in which subjects record their momentary symptoms using portable computers as electronic diaries, has been used as an appropriate method avoiding recall bias. In addition, we have developed and validated personal digital assistant (PDA)-based food diary with food photographs. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between food intake and psychosocial factors in healthy people in daily life, using EMA and the PDA-based food diary. Twenty subjects (age 23.6 \u00b1 4.2 yo) wore a watch-type computer for a week and recorded their momentary psychological stress, mood states and situational information into it several times a day including just before and after meals. They also recorded into the PDA-based food diary everything that they ate and drank. Multilevel modeling analyses revealed that energy intake when dining out was significantly more than that in the other situations (p = 0.049) after controlling for meal types and that momentary depressive mood just before the meal was negatively associated with energy intake only for dinner (p = 0.045). The results suggested possible effects of situational and psychological factor on energy intake with ecological validity and nutritional accuracy.",

Methods: BRFSS data collected between 1995 and 2005 were used for this study. Key Measures: Diabetes prevalence was assessed by self-report of physician diagnosis. Obesity was assessed by body mass index (BMI) computed from self-report of height and weight. Analyses: State-level data for diabetes and associated obesity prevalence from 1995 to 2005 were reported by each year. The sociodemographic factors (age, sex, race/ethnicity, income, education) and the known disease risk factor obesity were reported for 1995-2005. Logistic regression modeling was used to examine associations between diabetes, sociodemographic and disease risk factors at two time points (1995 and 2005). Results: Diabetes prevalence in Pennsylvania, which increased from 5.7% in 1995 to 8.1% in 2005, followed national trends, but exceeded them each year by approximately 1%. A pattern of obesity becoming a more dominant risk factor for diabetes emerged over this eleven year time period. Conclusion: Results of this study can be used to inform diabetes prevention strategies within the state.",

This study explores whether people of different BMI show different levels of anxiety, as measured with three different questionnaires, a 28-item Fear Checklist (Hernandez-Pozo, Calleja, Castillo, et al 2009), the Spanish translation of the Beck Anxiety Survey (Hernandez-Pozo, Castillo, Mata, et al 2010) and a questionnaire of recent potentially stressing events RPSE (Hernandez-Pozo, Cerezo, Macias, et al, 2010). 60 men and 60 women, ages 15 to 35, participated in the study, with BMI ranging from 15.05 to 38.28; 56 were underweight-normal (G1), and 64 were overweight-obese (G2). A behavioral measure for anxiety towards body weight and eating disorders consisted of a computerized discriminative 8 minutes test based on the emotional version of the Stroop task where thematic and neutral words were used as sample stimulus. Interference was computed by subtracting latencies to neutral words from latencies to thematic words, of the same length and lexical probability. Before and after the Stroop task, blood pressure and heart rate were monitored Additional self-report measures of eating disorders were recorded, by means of the Spanish version of the EAT26, CAR and SCOFF questionnaires. Results showed a significant difference between groups for RPSE (t = 6.062, p < .0001) with higher scores for the heavier group, and for Beck index (t = 5.159, p < .0001). Combining sex by BMI group significant differences were recorded for all three eating disorders questionnaires, with female heavier group scoring higher on CAR and SCOFF, and male lighter group scoring higher for EAT26. The puzzling finding was that no perceptual bias differences were registered for BMI groups by themselves nor combined by sex, that is, the only differences among them were in verbal self-reports. Heavier females exhibited the highest diastolic reactivity (F = 8.05, df = 3, p < .0001). We concluded that there is a gap between \u201ctalking about obesity and eating disorders\u201d and the actual unconscious bias towards those themes, which might lead to postulate progressive stages of concerns about obesity and eating disorders, described by specific combinations of behavioral, physiological and verbal data.",

A percentage of 47.4% of the students eat fruits less than 4 times/week , while the consume of vegetables less than 4 times/ week was recognized by 62.4% of the students. Eating fruits and vegetables decreased with age. Moreover the bivariate correlation analyses showed that the lower use of fruits and vegetables was associated with insufficient knowledge regarding the importance of fruits and vegetables and the quantity, which should be consumed each day, as well as with lower intention of consuming more fruits and vegetables in the future. These results underline the importance of developing programs, which promote the use of fruits and vegetables among Romanian adolescents from rural areas, as an important component of a healthy nutrition.",

Participants included 614 nine year old boys (51%) and girls (49%). Three 24-hour dietary recalls were collected. Children\u2019s height, weight (used to calculate BMI) and %BF were measured. Physical fitness, reported family history of diabetes, and ethnicity were also collected. A previously published prediction equation was used to determine the validity of rEIs in these children to identify under-, plausible-, and over-reporters. Additionally, we examined the question of whether there is a difference in reporting by sex, ethnicity, BMI and %BF. On average, 18% of the children were at-risk of being overweight, 43% were already overweight at baseline, yet these children reported consuming fewer calories on average than recommended guidelines. Additionally, reported caloric intake in this cohort was negatively associated with BMI and % body fat. Using the previously described methods 49% of participants were identified as under-reporters, while 39% and 12% were identified as plausible- and over-reporters, respectively. On average, children reported caloric intakes that were almost 100% of pER when the sedentary category was assigned; Inactivity and excessive energy intake are important contributors to obesity. With the rising rates of obesity and diabetes in children, accurate measures of EI are needed for better understanding of the relationship between energy intake and health outcomes",

Nutritional labelling, especially of processed foods, is one population level intervention designed to achieve healthier food purchasing and consumption. A range of nutritional labels varying in information and format are being used but there is currently no consensus on the most effective labelling. A systematic literature review of the impact of nutritional labelling on behaviourally assessed food purchasing and consumption is in progress (Cochrane registration in progress). Pilot literature searches have identified 13 studies assessing behavioural outcomes and preliminary analyses conducted. Eight studies assessed the impact of labelling the calorie content of restaurant menu items and found no effect on purchasing from fast food restaurants but a reduction in calories purchased from non fast food restaurants and canteens. One study found more purchases of low fat options, labelled as such, from vending machines. Two studies assessed supermarkets purchases and, although finding no overall effect of nutritional labels, different effects of different labels were found. Specifically \u201ctraffic light\u201d labels highlighting products with high levels of less healthy nutrients had no impact on purchasing compared to unlabelled products. In contrast, while \u201clow trans fat\u201d and \u201clow calorie\u201d labels resulted in more purchases of items thus labelled, \u201clow fat\u201d labels resulted in fewer purchases of items thus labelled. Finally, two related studies assessed the impact of \u201clow fat\u201d labels on consumption finding paradoxically greater consumption of products thus labelled with greater effects in those who were overweight. These results indicate that the impact of nutritional labels on food purchasing and consumption is modified by characteristics of the individual, of the food product labelled and of the label itself. The results further suggest that the purchase of healthier options will not necessarily result in healthier consumption. It is anticipated that the results of the full review will help to elucidate which labels most effectively promote healthy consumption across populations to inform the development of policy internationally.",

However, it is unknown whether interpersonal coaching promotes the utilization of handheld computers to self-monitor health behaviors and whether increased utilization is associated with increased weight loss. The aim of this study was to determine whether interpersonal coaching leads to increased utilization of handheld computers for self-monitoring and weight loss in lower income multi-ethnic women. Participant women, aged 43 \u00b1 10 yrs among whom 85% were employed, 51% had a combined family income <$40,000, 61% were married/cohabitating, 41% were African-American, 31% White, and 28% Hispanic were randomized to either: a) self-paced use of handheld system (eSolutions, n = 29); or b) use of the handheld system plus weekly interpersonal coaching sessions (eSolutions-Plus, n = 25). At 12 weeks, tracking frequency was significantly higher in the eSolutions-Plus (mean: 36.6 days, SD: 20.9 days) compared to the eSolutions group (mean: 26.3 days, SD: 24.5 days, p < .05; mean tracking total: 31.6 days, SD: 23.6 days, range: 0-79 days). Regardless of group assignment, higher tracking frequency was also associated with greater weight loss (r = \u2212.45, p < .001; mean total weight loss: \u22123.4 lbs, SD: 6.3 lbs, range: \u221218-12; e-Solutions: \u22123.3 lbs, SD: 7.2 lbs; eSolutions plus: \u22123.5 lbs, SD: 5.5 lbs; p = .919). To conclude, interpersonal coaching appears to foster the utilization of handheld computers for weight loss in lower income women.",

However, little efforts have been made so far to test whether there are detectable behavioural differences in type II diabetics as compared to age matched healthy controls. Ultimatum Game and its versions have been used to assess economic behaviour such as rationality or fairness in distribution of reward. Prior studies have shown that endocrine status of an individual affects the offers made as well as acceptance levels in the ultimatum game. Individuals with low testosterone levels or high serotonin levels were shown to give as well as accept low offers which is economically more rational. Since both testosterone and serotonin are key players in type II diabetes, we examined whether the offers and acceptance levels of type II diabetics are different than age matched controls. A survey of 58 patients with type II diabetes and other metabolic syndrome disorders and 60 age matched healthy controls showed that the offers given by patients with type II diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases were significantly lower than the control. BMI was poorly correlated with the economic behaviour. Further in this sample, the ultimatum game offer was a better predictor of type II diabetes than BMI.",

We evaluated the factor structure, reliability and validity of J-BICI. Subjects were 1218 normal undergraduate (male = 709, female = 518) students. They completed the J-BICI and some other related questionnaires (Dysmorphic concerns Examination; DCE, Self-rating Depression Scale; SDS, Drive for Thinness and Bulimia subscale of Eating Disorder Inventory-91; abbreviated EDI-91, Japanese 32item short version of Padua Inventory; J-PI32). Factor analysis using promax lotation method was carried out and identified three interpretable factors. These factors were as follows: safety behavior for one\u2019s own appearance flaws (factor1), avoidant behavior from one\u2019s own appearance flaws (factor2), negative evaluation for one\u2019s own appearance (factor3). These factors had high degrees of internal consistency (\u03b1 = .84-.91) and good test-retest reliability (r = .79-88, p < .01; 3 weeks interval). Female participants scored significantly higher on these three factors than male ones (factor1: t(1225) = \u221217.69, p < .001; factor2: t(1225) = \u22122.23, p < .05; factor3: t(1225) = \u22128.60, p < .001).

As alternative, comparator controlled trials ave been proposed. Both however, differ in the likelihood of providing effective treatment: 50% and 100%, resp. Methods: We investigated whether the likelihood of receiving drug or placebo determines the size of the drug response and the size of the placebo response (DR, PR) in treatment studies of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Results: In 92 published randomized placebo-controlled trials with more than 22.000 patients with IBS, 16 had a drug:placebo ratio of 2:1 or greater while the remaining were powered 1:1. Computing the overall DR and PR, both responses were lower with higher likelihood of receiving the drug (ratio 2:1 or higher), but the difference between DR and PR (\"therapeutic gain\") decreased. Ten of the 16 studies (4 with a 2:1 ratio, 3 with 3:1, and 3 with 4:1; total n = 6484) were compared to 10 studies (n = 3782) of similar size (>80 patients per study arm) and design (drug trials with novel compounds) based on a standardized patient definition (according to Rome criteria), and with comparable (dichotomous) endpoints. Again, the placebo response decreased with increasing likelihood of receiving a drug from 37.6% (1:1) to 29.1% (4:1). Similarly, the drug response dropped from 49.8% (1:1) to 42.4% (4:1) (significant decrease for DR (p = .035), but not for PR). Discrimination between DR and PR was best for 1:1 trials. Correlation between the drug response and the placebo response across all 20 trials was significant (Pearsons r = .781, p < .001), but was higher in 1:1 trials (n = 10; r = .91, p < .001) than in trials with a higher drug-to-placebo ratio (n = 10, r = .69, p = .027). Conclusion: The higher the likelihood of receiving active treatment (a drug as compared to a placebo), the lower the response rate to both placebo and the drug in IBS, at the expense of a poorer discrimination between DR and PR. This is contrary to respective data from depression trials. (Supported by a grant from DFG, En 50/25).",

The aim of this study was to investigate pre- and postpartum levels of childbirth fear in a cohort of pregnant women and examine factors associated with elevated fear. Three hundred sixty-one pregnant women (mean age = 32, SD = 4.5) completed questionnaires measuring: anxiety sensitivity, state-anxiety, fatigue, depression, social support, life events and parental self-efficacy in the third trimester of pregnancy. The Wijma Delivery Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire (W-DEQ) was used to assess childbirth fear at the pre- and postpartum assessment. Two-hundred sixty-three women returned their questionnaires at the 4-6 weeks postpartum assessment. Demographic variables (i.e. parity, education) and complications in the current pregnancy or in previous deliveries were also collected. Low levels of childbirth fear during pregnancy was reported by 25.8% (n = 93) of the women, with 48.8% (n = 176) moderately fearful and 25.5% (n = 92) highly fearful. At the postpartum assessment 37.6% (n = 99) reported low levels of fear, 44.1% (n=116) reported moderate fear levels and 18.3% (n = 48) were highly fearful. Overall, fear levels in the postpartum decreased significantly by a mean of 6 points compared to the prepartum assessment (t (262) = 4.5, p < .001). The regression model examining prepartum childbirth fear showed that lower parental self-efficacy (p < 0.001), higher state-anxiety (p < 0.001), more life events (p = 0.001) and greater anxiety sensitivity (p = 0.003) were significant independent predictors of higher prepartum W-DEQ, explaining 44% of the variance. In addition to prepartum WEQ scores (p < 0.001), postpartum childbirth fear was associated with greater anxiety sensitivity (p = 0.001), lower parental self-efficacy (p = 0.005) and delivery by caesarean section (p = 0.014), together explaining 36% of the variance. Our findings underscore the importance of routine assessment of childbirth fear during pregnancy and highlights areas which can be targeted in order to manage childbirth fear. Women expressing fears may benefit from interventions aimed at improving self-efficacy and reducing stress to enhance the pregnancy and childbirth experience.",

We hypothesized that higher levels of depression, stress, and colon cancer worry (and lower levels of social support) would be associated with greater numbers of ACF among individuals at heightened risk for colon cancer. Sample and Methods: Participants were self-referred or referred by physicians from the Gastroenterology Clinic or Colon Cancer Prevention Program at the University of Connecticut Health Center for routine colonoscopy. A total of 93 individuals were consented (51% women; 49% men). Within two weeks prior to colonoscopy, participants completed measures assessing the psychosocial factors noted above. Individuals were also examined for ACF detection at colonoscopy. Regression beta weights were used to examine the association between the psychosocial variables and ACF. Results: Among women, higher levels of depression were associated with greater numbers of ACF (\u03b2 = .731, p = .032) after controlling for age, race/ethnicity, stress, social support, and colon cancer worry. Among men, lower levels of social support were associated with greater numbers of ACF (\u03b2 = -.398, p = .050) after controlling for age and race/ethnicity. These results suggest that although colon cancer affects men and women equally with regards to morbidity and mortality rates, there are important gender differences in how psychosocial factors impact colonic mucosa and perhaps colon cancer risk. Psychosocial interventions aimed at targeting these types of factors are warranted but need to consider the role of gender.",

A sample of 619 Australian university students (330 men and 289 women, aged 17-25 years) were systematically assigned to four image exposure conditions: no models, muscular models, average-slim models, and average-large models. In each condition, participants viewed eight glamour advertisements created for the purpose of the study, rated the effectiveness of each advertisement, and then completed standardised measures of body image state. Advertisements were matched across conditions for product and general style. Men and women rated average-size male models as equally effective in advertisements as muscular models. Amongst the men, those exposed to average-size models had more positive body image than those viewing no models, with no difference from those viewing muscular models. Similar results were found for women. These findings suggest that average-size male models can promote positive body image and appeal to consumers.",

Participants eligible for this line of research may not be aware of genetic biobanking research and reasons to participate. This disconnect between potential eligible participants and the importance of genetic biobank research may hinder progress in disease management. Qualitative studies are needed to identify factors that influence a multi-ethnic sample to participate in genetic biobanking research. Purpose: Project Diversity GATHER (Group discussions Around Themes on HEalthful genetic Research) examines health behaviors and factors that influence women\u2019s and men\u2019s participation in genetic biobanking research. A multi-ethnic sample was recruited to identify factors influencing research participation. Methodology: 85 women and 50 men from Texas completed an 89-item sociodemographic questionnaire and 60-minute non-ethnically or gendered matched focus group. Wegner\u2019s translation process model (1993) was used to indentify intra-and inter-cultural themes that influence participants\u2019 participation in research. Participants\u2019 characteristics were analyzed through descriptive analyses and qualitative themes categorized on 3 key focus group questions:1) research perceptions, 2) facilitating factors, and 3) barriers to participate into research. Results: 135 participants (63% female; mean age = 46.67, SD = 17.17, mean education = 14.86; SD = 2.49) participated in 28 focus groups. The sample was 49.2% African-American, 36.2% White, 8.5% Other, 1.5% Asian, 2.3% Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, and 2.3% American Indian/Alaska native; 19.3% of participants reported a Latino heritage. 81.3% participants never heard of the term genetic biobanking. 67.4% of participants indicated that they would participate in genetic biobanking research vs. 93.6% before and after the group, respectively, (F(1,94) = 7.23, p = .015). Two, 5, and 5 central themes were identified for research perceptions, facilitating factors, and barriers to research, respectively. All participants reported mistrust, privacy, and lack of knowledge as research barriers. The majority of participants reported addressing importance of research and (non)monetary incentives to increase research participation. Conclusions: Multi-ethic focus group themes highlight that educating the community about the importance of genetic biobanking research may increase research participation.",

Vital functions such as the timing of cell cycles or apoptosis depend on this intrinsic rhythm. In mammals, the cogwheels of this clock are contained in every single cell. These so-called clock genes control their own expression and the expression of clock-controlled genes via several feedback loops. One of these genes is Per1, a clock gene that disposes of a glucocorticoid-responsive element and is therefore most likely influenced by glucocorticoids. In humans, stress is associated with an increase in the glucocorticoid cortisol. Simultaneously, psychosocial stress is seen as a major factor in the etiology of numerous mental health problems. For this reason, we aimed to investigate first, the association of cortisol and hPER1 as well as hPER2, and second, the putative cortisol-mediated influence of acute and chronic psychosocial stress on the gene expression of the same two clock genes in thirty-one healthy men. Our findings suggest that first, cortisol strongly interacts with hPER1 and hPER2, and second, psychosocial stress influences the expression of hPER1 and hPER2. These results implicate a strong clinical relevance of stress on the human circadian rhythm.",

It is unclear whether these measures will capture motives for seeking genetic susceptibility testing where gene variants are associated with small increases in disease risk. In a factorial study examining methods to convey low genetic risk for lung cancer to young smokers, we evaluated a 20-item measure of motives for or against genetic testing in 128 college smokers. Items were adapted from those used in other scales and unique items were generated by a panel of experts to assess the following domains: health behavior motivation/demotivation, altruism, uncertainty reduction, impact on perceived risk and worry, and curiosity about oneself and science. Eight items were correlated significantly with intentions to get tested (p < .05). Exploratory factor analysis of these eight items yielded two correlated factors (r = .22, p < .01): maintaining personal health and curiosity about self and technology. These items formed a reliable scale (alpha = .70) that correlated with testing intentions (r = .63, p < .001). We also asked participants open-ended questions to assess additional reasons for and against testing. Overall, themes paralleled those in our quantitative survey, though participants offered the novel point that they would not want to be tested because the awareness that would come from testing would lead to less enjoyment of life. Prior scales used to assess motivations for testing did not include the construct of curiosity about oneself and technology. This may be unique to intentions to seek new susceptibility tests. Understanding the role of curiosity in test uptake could be informative for this and other novel technologies where health utility has yet to be established.",

Our overarching objective was to evaluate Biobank participants\u2019 beliefs, knowledge and information needs regarding genetics research and genetic testing. A topic guide was developed and 6 focus groups were conducted with MSMC Biobank participants. The topic guide included questions on understanding of genetics, beliefs about genetics research, and attitudes towards personal and childhood genetic testing. Each focus group was recorded and subsequently transcribed for data analysis. The 6 focus groups comprised 43 participants: 21 were Hispanic, 18 African-American, 2 Caribbean/West Indian, 1 Asian, 1 White; ages ranged from 27 to 76; the median yearly household income was <$20,000. Participants\u2019 reasons for participating in the Biobank included helping future generations, learning more about personal health and disease, and helping the community. Understanding of genetics research and genetics were limited. Participants were generally in favor of personal genetic testing, but expressed mixed views regarding genetic testing of children. Participants expressed that they wanted more information about genetics, and suggested various venues such as streets fairs and community centers as a means for disseminating such information. The results indicate that Biobank participants recruited from a predominantly low income, minority community hold positive views, but have low understanding, of genetics research and its applications. These findings highlight the need for appropriately targeted genetics education initiatives and community engagement in DNA Biobanks and other genetics research.",

Due to high rates and detrimental health consequences of negative health behaviors, it is important to identify factors influencing discounting rates. Personality dimensions and depressive symptoms have been identified as potential predictors of discounting rates, but past studies have utilized monetary discounting measures when examining health outcomes rather than health discounting measures. This study examined personality and affective predictors of health discounting in a sample of 97 undergraduate students (41 women) who completed the following questionnaires as participants in a study for course credit: (1) a hypothetical health choice task (Chapman, 1996), (2) the NEO Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI), and (3) the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Hypothetical health choice responses were summed, with higher scores reflecting less discounting of future health rewards. Data were analyzed with Pearson correlations evaluating factors associated with health discounting. Results indicated that higher extraversion was associated with greater likelihood of choosing delayed rewards (r = .26, p = .01). However, analysis of sex differences indicated that the association was only significant among men (r = .29, p = .03). Discounting was not associated with any other personality dimension, but it was negatively associated with depressive symptoms (r = \u2212.32, p = .002), indicating that greater depressive symptoms were associated with choosing immediate rewards. Analysis of sex differences indicated that the association was significant among men (r = \u2212.37, p = .005), but not among women. Unlike previous studies using monetary measures of discounting, these results indicate that extraversion among men may be associated with reduced risk of engaging in negative health behaviors, and that depressive symptoms among men may be associated with increased risk of engaging in negative health behaviors.",

Many researchers have tried to understand the reasons underlying people\u2019s decisions to seek or not to seek help. In these studies, measures of help-seeking intentions have been often used instead of measuring actual help-seeking behavior, because it is assumed that help-seeking intentions associate with actual help-seeking behavior. However, there is little evidence of this association. The purpose of this study is to examine whether help-seeking intentions can predict actual help-seeking behavior among Japanese university students. One hundred and eighty-five Japanese university students answered a questionnaire which included social support and help-seeking intentions (Time1). Four weeks later (Time2), participants answered another questionnaire which included psychological distress and actual help-seeking behavior. The correlation between help-seeking intentions at Time1 and actual help-seeking behavior at Time2 was moderate (r = .65 p < .01). The result of multiple regression analysis indicated that help-seeking intentions associated with actual help-seeking behavior (\u03b2 = .42 p < .01). Social support at Time1 (\u03b2 = .18 p < .05) and psychological distress at Time2 (\u03b2 = .44 p < .01) also associated with actual help-seeking behavior. These variables accounted for 57.2% of the variance in actual help-seeking behavior. Thus, it was revealed that help-seeking intentions can predict actual help-seeking behavior among Japanese university students.",

According to Temporal Self-Regulation Theory (Hall & Fong, 2007), executive function (including working memory and inhibitory control capacities) and prepotent behaviour (e.g., habits) may influence self-regulation abilities. The aim of this study was to replicate and extend initial evidence (Hall, Fong, Epp, & Elias, 2008) that, within the domains of diet and exercise, executive function moderates the intention-behaviour relationship. At baseline, university students and staff (N = 123; ages 17-73; 33 men) completed an n-back task (working memory), a Go/NoGo task (inhibitory control), and measures of dichotomous thinking and weight-cycling. They completed weekly measures of diet and exercise intentions and behaviours (including a modified version of the US National Cancer Institute Fruit and Vegetable screener over three weeks. Diet behaviours included eating five fruit and vegetables a day, low-fat foods, low-sugar foods, and a reduced-calorie diet. Regression analyses revealed interaction effects of executive function and intentions on reduced-calorie diet at Time 2 (\u03b2 = .14, p < .05), and on fruit and vegetable intake and low-sugar intake at Times 2 and 3 (\u03b2\u2019s > .18, p\u2019s < .05). Intentions were more predictive of behaviour when executive functions was high than when it was low. Weight-cyclers (compared to those with no history of weight cycling) reported a higher dichotomous thinking style (t = 2.09, p < .04) and exhibited lower levels of inhibitory control (t = 2.14, p < .04). The findings support hypotheses that health goal achievement is influenced by self-regulation abilities with a significant biological basis. Research is needed to identify ways to increase these self-regulation capacities or develop alternative techniques for enabling individuals with low executive function to fulfil their health behaviour intentions.",

However, new genetic technologies facilitate testing that can reveal personal genetic risk information about many different conditions simultaneously. These tests are already available to the public despite little understanding of the cognitive and affective factors that affect peoples\u2019 decisions to take them. This study was conducted with 270 participants recruited from a parent study, the Multiplex Initiative, who were offered a multiplex genetic test that assessed risk for eight conditions: type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, and several types of cancer and cardiovascular conditions. Data was collected from a baseline survey, a web-based decisional survey, and at the time of testing. We aimed to understand relationships among predictor variables that originated from a conceptual model; an amalgamation of the Theory of Planned Behavior and the Protection Motivation Theory. Structural equation modeling identified response efficacy as a predictor (\u03b2 = 0.30, p < 0.001) of attitudes toward multiplex genetic testing, which in turn predicted (\u03b2 = 1.17, p < 0.001) intentions toward testing. Older age had a positive effect on testing intentions (\u03b2 = 0.60, p = 0.040), while marginally significant effects on intentions were seen for higher educational levels (\u03b2 = 0.34, p = 0.078) and African Americans (\u03b2 = \u22120.56, p = 0.054). Furthermore, intentions to undergo testing were a strong predictor of testing behavior (\u03b2 = 2.87, p < 0.001). These findings support the use of variables from the Theory of Planned Behavior in modeling decision-making about a genetic test for multiple health conditions.",

            "text": "No study has yet examined factors associated with social problem-solving among overweight and obese individuals seeking behavioral weight loss treatment. To develop predictive models of social problem-solving (SPS) in this group, we conducted a secondary analysis using baseline data from an ongoing randomized clinical trial on weight loss. The total score and five subscale scores (rational and negative problem orientation [RPO, NPO], rational problem solving [RPS], impulsive/careless style [ICS], and avoidance style [AS]) of the Social Problem-Solving Inventory- Revised (SPSI-R) were used to assess SPS. Guided by the literature, we examined the following predictors of SPS: age, gender, education, marital status, employment status, income, mental health quality of life (MHQOL), perceived stress, and barriers to healthy eating (BHE). Predictive models were developed using all possible subsets regression in SAS. The sample was predominantly white (84.8%), female (78.1%), and middle-aged (average 46.80 years). Age, baseline weight, MHQOL, BHE, and perceived stress were jointly identified as predictors of the total score of SPSI-R (R2 = .40, F = 26.4, p < .0001). This same group of factors, with the addition of being single, formed a significant predictive model of NPO (R2 = .19, F = 24.7, p < .0001). Higher levels of income and education, fewer perceived stresses, and history of weight cycling predicted RPS (R2 = .34, F = 24.7, p < .0001), while a higher income, fewer barriers and perceived stresses predicted RPO (R2 = .22, F = 23.8, p < .0001). Less education, more eating barriers and perceived stress predicted an impulsive style (R2 = .18, F = 24.7, p < .0001), while being older, having poor mental health and perceiving more eating barriers and stress together predicted an avoidant style (R2 = .34, F = 24.7, p < .0001) of problem solving. Taken together, age, income, education, mental health, perceived stress, and barriers to healthy eating were associated with participants\u2019 social problem-solving. These factors need to be considered when developing interventions to address problem-solving ability related to managing lifestyle changes and weight reduction.",

This study set out to explore the perspectives of patients\u2019 management of Type 2 diabetes and provide recommendations that aim to enhance adherence to treatment and help patients to improve their self-management skills. In-depth interviews were carried out on a purposeful sample of patients and their health care professional (HCPs). Interviews were recorded, transcribed and audiotapes were analysed using NVivo software to identify emerging themes and code according to categories. Interviews were conducted in an Endocrinology clinic in Malaysia with 18 Malay patients (15-75 years, 9 males and 9 females) and 13 HCPs. Themes that emerged from interviews with patients\u2019 were problems with integrating the treatment regimen and difficulty developing coping skills to achieve the desired blood glucose level. Patients lacked knowledge about their medicines, dietary control, medicine taking, complexities of treatment, and side effects of medications. They needed to integrate many treatment requirements such as diet, medications, blood glucose monitoring and exercise into their daily routine posed problems. Other barriers such as ethnicity, beliefs (culture and financial) proved to be constraints in their ability to good control diabetes. Education and knowledge related to diabetes that influenced understanding of the disease were also reasons for non-adherence to treatment regimen. According to pharmacists, patients\u2019 ethnicity and education level played a substantial role in their attitudes toward diabetes management. Their beliefs, cultural and social needs shaped their attitudes in controlling or adherence to treatment management. Patients were willing to discuss their problems about self-managing diabetes if these barriers were addressed during consultations with the pharmacists. More positive approaches are needed in self-management of diabetes and health care professionals involved in the management of diabetes need to understand their patients\u2019 beliefs about their diabetes and their constraints to promote more awareness and to foster greater control of diabetes and improve health outcomes.",

            "text": "Most major chronic diseases are caused by more than one behavioral risk factor and risk factors additively contribute to morbidity and mortality. Risk behaviors also tend to co-occur, but data on the prevalence of co-occurring mental and behavioral risk factors are scarce. Most prevalence reports focus on single risk factors. Better understanding the co-occurrence of risk factors, however, could help inform the feasibility and design of multiple risk factor (MRF) interventions, which potentially can be more cost-effective than delivering interventions targeted at single behaviors. We report on the co-occurrence of three primary disease risk factors (depression, low physical activity, and smoking) in a representative health plan population (n = 66,901) in the U.S. Pacific Northwest. Data was collected during an online health risk assessment offered to all health plan members. Two-thirds of respondents (66.6%) were female and 86% were white. Mean age was 47 years. Approximately 9% reported current smoking, 8.2% were moderate to severely depressed based on the PHQ-8, and 24.5% reported low physical activity per the IPAQ. While 33.1% of smokers had low physical activity and 18.8% reported significant depressive symptoms, the overall prevalence of all three behaviors was much lower. As a proportion of the entire sample, <2% (n = 1089) met criteria for smoking and depression; 2.5% (n = 1695) met criteria for smoking and low physical activity; and 3.2% (n = 2137) met criteria for depression and low physical activity. Fewer (0.6%; n = 405) met criteria for all three behaviors. The results highlight a challenge of MRF interventions. While many people report single risk factors, far fewer meet criteria for MRF\u2019s, even for common risk factors such as smoking, depression, and inactivity. Given this, MRF interventions may need to be easily disseminable across large populations in order to be cost-effective and have maximum impact. Implications for MRF treatment design will also be discussed.",

One study has reported reduced mortality in persons with HIV disease reporting high positive affect; however, little is known about mechanisms of this effect. The broaden-and-build model of positive emotions holds that positive emotions promote psychological resource development (e.g. coping skills). The present correlational study conceptualized health behavior practices as coping responses to living with HIV disease. Specifically, medication adherence and health behaviors (smoking, alcohol use, physical activity, and nutrition) were hypothesized to mediate relations between trait positive and negative affect and general and HIV-specific health indicators in persons living with HIV. HIV + participants (N = 53) completed an interview about their emotions, health behaviors, and general health status. Clinical staff provided HIV symptom ratings. Virulogic and immunologic indicators were collected by chart review. High trait negative affect was associated with poor medication adherence, and percent adherence mediated the relation between high trait negative affect and low CD4+ percent (z\u2019 = \u22121.33, p < .01) and high viral load (z\u2019 = 1.61, p < .01). Mediation hypotheses for health behaviors were not confirmed; however, high trait positive affect was associated with decreased alcohol intake (F = 3.10, R2 = .26, \u03b2 = \u22120.35, p < .05), increased physical activity (F = 3.89, R2 = .24, \u03b2 = 0.39, p < .01), and better nutrition habits (F = 3.68, R2 = .22, \u03b2 = 0.34, p < .05). Because the current sample was relatively young (average age 44, range 22-56), these behaviors may not yet had demonstrable effects on participants\u2019 health status; however, future longitudinal studies or studies that target older populations may bear out these mediating hypotheses. The current findings provide preliminary evidence on potential mechanisms by which trait affect could impact health status in persons with HIV.",

Behavioral medicine has been defined as interdisciplinary field that integrates behavioral & medical knowledge and applies that knowledge to health & disease. In Libya behavioral medicine is a pretty unknown field of knowledge and as has been defined here is not exist due to many and multiple factors, therefore it is not surprising that you would not find a teaching curriculum in medical schools for psychology or behavioral medicine at any university in Libya before 1988, we can say that the teaching of behavioral sciences started in 1988 in the faculty of medicine in Tripoli, University of Al-Fatah as apart of the community medicine course and is taught in the fourth year. in the faculty of medicine in Benghazi ,psychology was part of pre medical curriculum but behavioral medicine taught in the 4th year as apart of community medicine course. In this paper. the author highlight the historical development of behavioral medicine and behavioral sciences in Libyan medical schools and suggestion to include behavior medicine in the Libyan medical curriculum which should be a compulsory and not an optional subject. The main objective and the primary massage of this paper is to emphasize that modern and successful physicians needs two types of knowledge & practices: 1-medical & biological knowledge. 2 - psychological and sociological & practices knowledge. This means that physicians as has been stated should see beyond the molecular substances and perceive human being again in holistic approach or view.",

This limits the possibility of replicating effective interventions, synthesising evidence, and understanding the causal mechanisms underlying behavior change. Our ultimate aim is to develop a reliable method of specifying behavior change techniques (BCTs), link them to relevant theory and specify the behaviors necessary to implement them. In several stages, we have generated lists of BCT labels based on a) systematic reviews of behavior change interventions b) systematic text-book search c) expert brainstorming. We have generated definitions a) from 9 textbooks, b) from dictionaries (including APA Dictionary of Psychology) and c) by reframing to specify the behavioral competencies required of the person implementing the BCT. Two judges had 74.7% agreement on definitions extracted from textbooks for 53 BCTs. When judging links between BCTs and theoretical constructs, four judges had 71.7% agreement (385 judgments, based on 35 BCTs and 11 theoretical constructs). To date, we have agreed behavioral specification for 89 BCTs relevant to changing health behaviors. However this is a very early stage in the process and we have recently acquired UK Medical Research Council support to develop an international collaboration to refine and develop a BCT nomenclature, based on extensive Delphi, consensus and judgment processes, and then to test the value of the developed system in increasing the reliability of a) coding of published interventions and b) reporting of interventions.",

SC was defined as a function of both the number of self-aspects and the degree to which the self-aspects are differentiated from each other. Linville (1987) has suggested that high self-complexity serves as a buffer against the onset of depressive symptoms following negative events because it partly determines the impact of such events on thoughts and feelings about various self-aspects. Participants were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (n = 20) or the control group (n = 20). The intervention group received one session of psycho-education on SC and a paper-and-pencil exercise designed to calculate the number of their self-aspects (social roles, interpersonal relationships, activities, traits, etc.) and to evaluate each self-aspect using an adjective checklist. After the education and exercise, daily records of their self-aspects were assigned for one week. Self-reported questionnaires were completed three times in both groups (pre, post, and follow-up). The questionnaire was comprised of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. SC, P-SC, and N-SC, which were assessed using H, a statistical measure of dispersion that represents number of independent dimensions underlying a given trait-sorting, were measured by Linville\u2019s (1987) and Sato\u2019s (1999) trait sorting task. The Research Ethics Committee of the Hiroshima University Graduate School of Education reviewed and approved the study protocol. In the intervention group, the analysis of variance indicated that P-SC was significantly increased at the post-test and marginally increased at the follow-up test when compared to the pre-test. No significant differences in P-SC were found in the control group. Structured equation modeling revealed that in the intervention group, high P-SC at the post-test was related to lower levels of a depressed mood at the post-test and follow-up test. Results demonstrate that this program increases P-SC, which might ameliorate subsequent depressed mood among college students.",

Many vocations have a professional code of ethics to guide acceptable and appropriate behavior however with multiple disciplines collaborating the priority level of the ethical situation may vary. Additionally, depending on the collaborators and the ethical quandaries that arise, diverging viewpoints may develop when determining how to handle the dilemma. This is likely due to the preparation and training of the separate disciplines involved in collaborative efforts. Within the field of Health Education ethical considerations develop in various settings and provide challenging issues to address. Ethical dilemmas originate from the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels of the prevention model. This presentation will outline Ignite, a multidisciplinary approach to nutrition education created for intercollegiate students athletes and designed to enhance nutrition knowledge, perceptions, and behaviors of student athletes (n = 250). Through collaboration from athletic staff and health educators, Ignite was crafted to address all levels of the prevention model. This presentation presents ethical dilemmas observed in Ignite within the levels of prevention model. Finally, discussion questions to encourage dialogue regarding ethical behavior and interdisciplinary ethics are included.",

These results can be explained by the nature of the work in hospital wards. People working in physically demanding jobs usually have lower average WAI than people working in mentally demanding jobs. Besides this fact, among nursing personnel the decrease of work ability can be accelerated due to several factors present in the workplace, namely the level of dependency of patients, the number of staff, the availability of mechanical lifts, the rooms lay-out, the shift work and others.",

The sample consisted of 591 Spanish adolescents (40.4% boys and 59.6% girls) with a mean age of 15.75 (SD = .88). The level of knowledge about HIV transmission was assessed using the HIV-KS scale (Espada et al., 2009), and the attitudes towards HIV/AIDS and risk practices was assessed using the CASIPR scale (Espada et al. 2009). A quasi-experimental design with two experimental conditions was carried out, with an experimental group (n = 371) and a waiting-list control group (n = 220). Each school was randomly assigned to one of the conditions. The intervention consisted of 5 one-hour sessions that included the following components: information and cognitive restructuring, social skills training, problem solving training and covered behavioral rehearsal. The effects of the interventions was evaluated through a immediate posttest assessment controlling for the baseline differences. The results point to a greater change in knowledge about HIV/AIDS in individuals who are not sexually active (OR = 1.86, p < .01) than those who are (OR = 1.81, p < .01). With regard to attitudinal change, not sexually active adolescents have a higher change (OR = 1.21, p < .01) than the sexually active (OR = 1.10, p < .01). The highest efficacy of the intervention was observed among those who were not sexually active in both outcomes, knowledge and attitudes.",

This study compared three versions of a web-based game targeting the malaria risk reduction decision-making of study abroad students. This population is in jeopardy due to the rapid expansion of programs in malaria endemic regions and the low level of acquired immunity and malaria knowledge among US citizens. Constructs from the self-regulation model and the cognitive theory of multimedia learning informed the creation and evaluation of this game. A three-condition experimental design was used to compare feedback strategies for game decisions: baseline corrective (right/wrong) feedback and explanatory feedback that is either provided automatically with each decision or only when players click on a link to access it. Primary outcome measures were malaria knowledge and player satisfaction. Study abroad email lists at seven Midwestern campuses were used to recruit participants without incentive. Of the 1428 participants who entered the study protocol and were randomly assigned to condition, 918 (64%) completed the pre-survey, 540 (38%) completed the game, and 482 (34%) completed the post-survey. Only the automatically provided explanatory feedback condition produced a significantly higher knowledge score on the post-test when adjusted for pre-test score. There were no significant differences in player satisfaction between the three feedback conditions, while 65% of participants rated game satisfaction as \u2018very\u2019 to \u2018extremely\u2019 satisfying. Analysis of secondary outcome measures suggests that students prefer simplicity and efficiency within this interactive learning environment. Future research will examine the impact of a risk reduction game intervention on actual behavior.",

Although it is suggested that psychological factors may play a role in OTC drug misuse, the main factors that might be associated with one\u2019s manner of drug intake are unknown. Objective: The purpose of this study was to explore the illness perceptions and beliefs about taking OTC medicines and to investigate the differences between users and misusers of OTC medicines. Method: The subjects were 108 undergraduate students (age mean = 20.27, S.D. = 1.67). They retrospectively completed self-report measures addressing (a) illness perceptions, (b) beliefs about taking OTC medicines, (c) how to take OTC medicines, (d) common cold symptoms, and (e) frequency of intake. Result: The analysis of covariance indicated that misuse of OTC medicines was related to an individual\u2019s perceptions that concern consequences of illness (F (1, 107) = 5.85; p < .05) and controllability (F (1,107) = 6.57, p < .05). However, no other factors are associated with misuse of OTC medicines. Conclusion: This study revealed that consumers\u2019 perceptions are associated with their manner of drug intake. These findings indicate that the tendency to misuse OTC drugs can be evaluated using a self-report questionnaire of illness perception. Further studies are needed in order to develop brief questions to evaluate and examine if illness perceptions predict one\u2019s manner of drug intake.",

Men and women (n = 569, age 18-75 y) with HADS depression scores >7 hospitalized for any manifestation of CAD, are randomized into the intervention or control group. Initially, patients in intervention receive 3 sessions of supportive individual psychotherapy on a weekly basis. After re-evaluation of depression 4 weeks after inclusion, patients with persisting symptoms of depression receive 25 sessions of combined psychodynamic and group cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) over 10 months. The control group receives one counselling session. Routine cardiac care is offered to both groups. Primary efficacy endpoint is change from baseline to year 1 in HADS depressive symptoms. Secondary endpoints include remission of depression, Type D pattern, health-related quality of life, cardiovascular risk profile, neuroendocrine and inflammatory activation, heart rate variability, cardiac events, and health care utilization, up to 24 months after inclusion.

One possible explanation is that men and women have different needs in terms of stress reduction. Thus, it appears that family problems constitute stronger emotional stressors and provoke more depressive feelings in women than men, and that women, even when working outside the home are more endangered by family stress than by work stress. Therefore, the Stockholm Women\u2019s Intervention Trial (SWITCHD) was specifically designed to meet the needs of women CVD patients in terms of tailored stress reduction. This randomized clinical trial decreased CVD mortality in women receiving the intervention compared to women receiving standard care, providing evidence that an intervention designed to satisfy the gender related needs of women may prolong life in women with CVD.",

Some successful studies (e.g., Stockholm Women\u2019s Intervention Trial for Coronary Heart Disease: SWITCHD) have employed relaxation training, suggesting that stress reduction is important. SWITCHD also found that the interaction between behavioral intervention and the use of statins also appeared to decrease mortality. And in research conducted in animals we have found that social affiliation can attenuate the development of atherosclerosis by decreasing inflammation and oxidative stress. Because patients with CAD typically are prescribed multiple medications, medication adherence may be a useful intervention target. Similarly, because most CAD patients are overweight, physically inactive, and may have metabolic syndrome, behavioral intervention strategies to increase weight loss and improve fitness could be useful for addressing these issues. This presentation will compare and contrast RCT in terms of the biological and behavioral bases of the intervention strategies used to treat CAD patients.",

Etiology and epidemiology are poorly understood, and evidence for interventions is lacking. The purpose of this study is to describe onset and maintenance of hikikomori. Direct recruitment, snowballing and participant observation in on-line chat rooms were used to recruit participants and obtain data, which was then subject to grounded theory analysis. Of 168 participants several were unconnected with Japan, the oldest being 60 years old. Three major themes emerged of hikikomori as passive coping, trust and existence. Each theme comprised one or more categories, which in turn evidenced a number of different elements. Definitive characteristics of hikikomori were obtained from respondents through virtual participant observation. The emergent theoretical framework and the list are mutually supportive in the results obtained from this study, which suggested emotional pain exists in hikikomori in relation to human relationships. The results of the present study suggest that hikikomori is characterized by more diffuse features, including difficulties in coping with people or tasks, difficulties with trust, unhappiness about life and poor concept of time. There was no evidence of violent or aggressive behaviours.We conclude that Hikikomori is not unique to Japanese youth, but more widespread and diverse anomic coping style for dealing with social disaffection seen cross-culturally.",

This study examines childhood adversities and family environments as childhood risk factors for \u201chikikomori\u201d using the retrospective data derived from a population-based survey, the World Mental Health Japan. A random sample of residents aged 20 or older in nine communities in Japan was used, and interviews were conducted using the WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview 3.0 (n = 4,134, response rate = 51%). The subjects of this study were a subsample who responded to the second part of the interview (Part 2), and were aged between 20-49 years (n = 708). Multiple logistic regression was used to explore the association between the lifetime experience of \u201chikikomori\u201d and childhood risk factors; social class, parental psychopathology, parents\u2019 child rearing style, and other adverse events during a respondent\u2019s childhood. The statistical model was adjusted for sex, age, and respondents\u2019 experience of common mental disorders using a sampling weight for Part 2. Among the 708 respondents, 15 experienced \u201chikikomori\u201d in their lifetime (n = 9.7 or 1.2% in a weighted analysis). Father\u2019s high educational level (OR = 6.0, CI = 1.6\u201322.9), mother\u2019s common mental disorders (OR = 6.5, CI = 1.1-38.0), and mother\u2019s panic disorders (OR = 6.6, CI = 1.1\u201339.1) were significantly and positively associated with the experience of \u201chikikomori\u201d after controlling for respondents\u2019 sex, age, and history of mental disorders. Significant associations were not found for parents\u2019 child rearing styles or childhood adversities. Our findings suggest that \u201chikikomori\u201d cases are more likely to occur in families where the parents have high levels of education. Maternal panic disorder may influence the development of \u201chikikomori\u201d among children, possibly due to reactions of children to their mothers\u2019 disorder.",

Furthermore, recent studies have found that a substantial portion of the hikikomori population reports symptoms of mental illness (Kawakami, forthcoming). Taking a cultural anthropological approach, this paper explores the social context that allows withdrawing from society to be a prevalent and viable coping mechanism in Japan. The paper draws on ethnographic, participant-observation data from three clinical facilities in the Tokyo area which treat hikikomori populations, and four special education programs which treat children who missed school for long periods due to learning disabilities and social maladjustment. The paper concludes by reviewing recent literature on mental health in Japan in order to hypothesize about whether Japanese psychiatry will move away from relying so heavily on families and towards psycho-pharmacological treatments as the dominant method and perceived \"cure\" for addressing psychopathology.",

Although considered a confounder rather than an explanatory variable, it is worth noting that psychological ill health at age 33 was linked to depression at age 45 in men and women; however, the degree of the association is greater when central obesity is present, confirming the complex mechanism of co-occurrence of depression and central obesity.

The Community-based participatory research process led us to develop interventions to address women\u2019s health within the context of the economic and social circumstances of their lives: poverty, unemployment, racism and lack of access to resources. HOPE (Health, Opportunities, Partnerships, Empowerment) Works (2004\u20132009) was a successful obesity prevention intervention that drew upon development strategies including loan circles, microenterprise development, and American Indian talking circles. Community women were trained to organize and facilitate HOPE Circles of 8\u201312 women from their social networks. Circles met twice a month for 6 months: women set goals and supported each other to make health and social/economic improvements. Threads of HOPE (www.threadsofhopenc.org) is a spinoff from HOPE Works: it is a small business that produces sustainable conference bags, and a non-profit whose mission is to train low income women in business development and financial literacy. Seeds of HOPE (2009\u20132014) will disseminate the HOPE Works model through American Indian and African American churches and community health clinics. It will have a stronger emphasis on microenterprise development and financial literacy. HOPE Accounts for Women (2009\u20132011) is funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act through the National Institutes of Health. This innovative program uses the HOPE Works model but enhances the economic empowerment/financial literacy training by assisting low income women in saving money for starting a business or furthering education through a matched savings incentive. Data from the first 3 cohorts (159 Intervention, 118 Comparison) in the HOPE Works study show that 75% of women were African American and most were low income: outcome analysis demonstrated that HOPE Circle participants lowered BMI more than the comparison group with average weight loss difference of 4 pounds. Intervention women also increased hope, physical activity and fruit and vegetable intake.",

There was no association between occupational position and cancer mortality so no further analyses were undertaken. The difference between the baseline and longitudinal assessments was mostly due to an increased explanatory power of diet, physical activity and to a lesser extent, alcohol consumption. The role of smoking, the strongest mediator in these analyses, did not much differ when using baseline or repeat assessments.",

Because there is limited evidence within any one disease, such reviews do not provide strong evidence for peer support. In contrast, a more general review of peer support across a range of health behaviors can lead to more solid conclusions about its effectiveness. We conducted a systematic review of research on peer support for complex health behavior (e.g., cardiovascular risk reduction) across a variety of health problems. An initial PubMed search of papers published between 1/1/2001 and 8/31/2009 and using cognates of \u201ccoach,\u201d \u201cpromotora,\u201d \u201cpeer support,\u201d etc. identified 902 peer-reviewed articles. Of these, 595 articles were excluded as their titles indicated that they were not patient behavior programs (e.g. coaching for career growth among health professionals). The remaining 307 were reviewed to fit a broad definition of peer support: provided by a nonprofessional and addressing support for multiple health behaviors over time. Exclusion criteria consisted of: Interventions focused on isolated or single behaviors (e.g. cancer screening); interventions evaluating educational classes; and those without outcome data. The resulting 40 papers addressed: breastfeeding (6 papers); diabetes (5 papers), depression (5 papers), and asthma (4 papers), along with a variety of other health issues, and represented 8 different countries. Provisional rating of outcomes was: No evidence of benefit; Modest evidence of benefit (e.g., changes on self report measure of health behaviors or quality of life); and Strong evidence of benefit (e.g. statistically significant changes on objective clinical measure such as blood pressure or blood glucose, or on well validated psychological measure such as the CES-D). Of the 40 papers, 7 were scored as No, 15 as Modest, and 18 as Strong Evidence of Benefit. Further evaluation of effect sizes and weighting by sample sizes and adequacy of controls will be included in presentation at the Congress. This systematic review indicates that peer support is effective in promoting complex health behaviors across a variety of diseases and national settings.",

            "text": "Music listening has been suggested to beneficially impact health via stress-reducing effects. However, the exact mechanisms through which music exerts its positive consequences on the body are poorly understood. It was the aim of the current study to address this gap in knowledge and to examine the underlying mechanisms of music effects across neuroendocrine, autonomous, cognitive, and emotional domains of the human stress response. Sixty healthy female volunteers (mean = 25.27 years) were exposed to a standardized psychosocial stress test after having been randomly assigned to one of three different conditions prior to the stressor: 1) relaxing music (\u2018Miserere\u2019, Allegri) (RM), 2) sound of rippling water (SW) and 3) rest without acoustic stimulation (R). Salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase (sAA), anticipatory cognitive appraisal, subjective stress perception and anxiety were repeatedly assessed in all subjects. We hypothesized that listening to music prior to the stressor, compared to SW or R would result in an attenuated stress reaction. The stressor caused significant changes in all measurements in all three groups over time. The three conditions significantly differed regarding cortisol responses (p = 0.014), with highest values in the RM and lowest values in SW. sAA recovery delta showed a statistical trend (p = 0.060) in favor of the RM. Psychological measures did not significantly differ between groups during the experiment. Our findings indicate that music listening differentially impacts the psychobiological stress system. Listening to music prior to a psychological stressor increases rather than attenuates subsequent endocrine stress responses. In contrast, listening to water sound seems to result in an attenuated endocrine response to stress compared to no auditory stimulation. Listening to music seems to increase autonomic recovery more efficiently than listening to water sound or resting in silence. These findings bear potential to explain the effects of music on the human body.",

This was tested on 19 healthy workers on a Norwegian oil rig in the North Sea. They worked two weeks offshore followed by 4 weeks off work. The ordinary schedule was to work 12-hour day shift during one work period (14 days), and 12-hour night shift on the next work period (14 nights)(fixed-shift). \u201cSwing shift\u201d involves night shift during the first week, then day shift the second week, for every working period. The advantage of swing shift is that the workers are readapted to a normal day-night rhythm when they start their 4 week off work period. The disadvantage is that the workers have to adjust their biological rhythms twice every work period instead of once every other work period. All participants worked ordinary night-day shift when baseline data were collected (questionnaires, saliva cortisol, and reaction time during work). After collection of baseline data the workers changed their work schedule to \u201cswing shift\u201d, one year later the same data were collected. \u201cSwing shift\u201d did not give any negative health effects or any negative changes in reaction time during the day they shifted from night work to day work. During swing shift the cortisol rhythm went slowly back to a normal rhythm in the second week, but it was not fully returned to normal values when they returned home for the 4 weeks off period. When working swing shift the cortisol rhythms were readapted to normal values after one week at home. For personnel returning home directly from 14 consecutive night shifts, diurnal cortisol adaptation was not complete after one week at home.",

As diabetic foot ulcers are characterized by chronic inflammation, it is plausible that emotional distress could delay the healing of such ulcers by up-regulating and sustaining high ulcer tissue-specific levels of IL-6. Here we report a cross-sectional study of 41 patients with type 2 DM (76% male; mean age 55 yrs) and plantar neuropathic diabetic foot ulcers (University of Texas Classification: 82% grade 1A; 12% 1B; 3% 2A; and 3% 2B). The relationship between patient self reported generalized emotional distress, foot ulcer-specific emotional responses and ulcer biopsy IL-6 levels was investigated. Generalized emotional distress was assessed with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS: 1.3 \u00b1 0.8) and with two Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scales: HADS-Anxiety (13.5 \u00b1 4.4) and HADS-Depression (11.7 \u00b1 5.0). Foot ulcer-specific emotional responses were assessed with three subscales: Patient Interpretation of Neuropathy (PIN)-Amputation Worry (4.1 \u00b1 0.8), PIN-Anger at Practitioners (2.3 \u00b1 1.0) and Neuropathy and Foot Ulcer-Specific Quality of Life (NeuroQoL)-Interpersonal Burden (3.7 \u00b1 1.2). Ulcer-specific IL-6 levels were determined via quantification of immunohistochemical wound biopsy tissue localization. Additionally, assessed was the physiologic marker of emotional distress, 9 am and 12noon serum cortisol (458.7 \u00b1 125.8 nmol/l and 625 \u00b1 369.7 nmol/l, respectively). In the bivariate analysis, more severe generalized and foot-ulcer-specific emotional distress were each associated with higher levels of ulcer biopsy log-transformed IL-6 (raw mean: 608.3 \u00b1 545.5 cells/mm2): HADS-Anxiety (r = 0.44; p = 0.031), PSS (r = 0.44; p = 0.034), PIN-Amputation Worry (r = 0.54; p = 0.007) and NeuroQoL-Interpersonal Burden (r = 0.60; p = 0.004). No significant relationship was noted between serum cortisol and IL-6. These preliminary findings identify a strong link between subjective measures of emotional distress and wound specific IL-6 up-regulation. Whether this relationship contributes to non-healing of diabetic foot ulcers is under investigation.",

Such conditions are complicated and draining to live with, and successful adaptation may depend on ability to self-regulate. Self-regulation involves capacity to exercise control and guide or alter reactions and behavior. Research indicates that self-regulatory strength is a limited source that can be depleted or fatigued, however, and patients with FMS and TMD may, when trying to adapt to the many demands of their illnesses, deplete or fatigue their self-regulatory resources. The current study aimed to show that patients with FMS and TMD, compared with healthy controls, are more vulnerable to self-regulatory fatigue as a consequence of their condition, and that self-regulatory fatigue has specific physiological markers. Research has found self-regulatory effort to lead to self-regulatory fatigue, indicated by less capacity to persist on a subsequent task. Patients (N = 50) and matched controls (N = 50) were exposed to an experimental self-regulation task, followed by a persistence task. Controls in the low self-regulation condition displayed continued high persistence as expected. However, patients in the same condition displayed similar persistence as patients and controls in the high self-regulatory condition, indicating that patients with FMS and TMD may in fact be suffering from chronic self-regulatory fatigue. Baseline heart rate variability, heart rate, blood glucose, and cortisol predicted persistence, more so for controls than for patients, and more so in the low versus high self-regulation condition. Impact of illness on self-regulatory effort was mediated by pain, but not by any other factors. The current study shows that patients with chronic multi-symptom illnesses likely suffer from chronic self-regulatory fatigue, and that self-regulatory capacity needs to be taken into account when aiming to treat and help these patients through behavioral interventions.",

Helping patients to adopt healthier behaviors therefore is an important component of medical management and disease prevention. Communication training is a core feature of medical and nursing training. However, recent research reveals that communication training inadequately equips new health professionals for this growing clinical challenge and practitioners remain unconfident about how to discuss behavior change usefully with patients. The study aims to explore how doctors and nurses manage behavior change and identify what barriers operate to prevent effective behavior change management. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of 14 medical and 14 nursing practitioners at a range of stages during their training (undergraduate and postgraduate). Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically using principles of constant comparison to categorise emergent and recurring themes within and between transcripts. Thematic categories arising in initial interviews were explored subsequently and disconfirmatory evidence was sought until thematic saturation arose. Findings reveal that trainees and practitioners consider behavior change to be a fundamental part of medical practice, yet one they are not formally trained in. Participants had developed a range of strategies to encourage behavior change through experiential learning, but were unconvinced of their efficacy. Further barriers to implementing behavior change included the uncertainty over whose responsibility it is, the influence of patient authority within consultations, and desire to protect the doctor-patient relationship. Evidently current communication training is inadequate to equip health practitioners to motivate behavior change. Barriers arise from clinician-patient interactions as well as the context of health care services and have important implications for medical education.",

Given that uptake is less than optimal, despite the availability of no cost vaccination, there is a need to identify psychosocial factors associated with this preventive behaviour. Applying the Common Sense Model, we first identified the illness representations associated with the acceptance and non-acceptance of the cervical cancer vaccine among young Australian women aged 18\u201326. We then assessed whether information regarding the link between the viral causes of cervical cancer and the effect of the preventive vaccine can function as a facilitator of future vaccination behaviours. Participants (N=132) initially completed measures of vaccination status, intentions to be vaccinated, illness representations, perceived risk, perceived vaccine effectiveness and cervical cancer knowledge. Then we experimentally manipulated illness coherence relating to links between the Human Papillomavirus, cervical cancer and the vaccine, by randomly assigning participants to receive either a brief or detailed information condition, to ascertain the effect of this manipulation on vaccination intentions for non-vaccinated women. Higher levels of illness coherence, identity, and perceived vaccine effectiveness, having had a Pap smear in the past, and lower beliefs in the treatment cure/controllability of cervical cancer were associated with vaccination uptake. Higher intentions to be vaccinated among non-vaccinated women were associated with higher levels of illness coherence and perceived risk for cervical cancer. Post-manipulation measures indicated that the detailed condition of the experimental manipulation resulted in significant increases in illness coherence. The identification of illness cognitions and the role of illness coherence influencing the acceptance of this vaccine adds to the paucity of information available on this underrepresented sample and provides direction for the design of future intervention strategies aimed at modifying illness cognitions to increase vaccine uptake.",

The purpose of the present study was to identify the kinds of health messages and the kinds of foods likely to be most acceptable to consumers. Data were obtained by means of a nationwide postal survey (N = 849). Ratings of the importance of various RS health and functional claims and receptiveness to different foods as RS delivery vehicles were analysed according to the respondents\u2019 level of fibre engagement, as classified under the Precaution Adoption Process Model (PAPM) of Health Behaviour (Weinstein & Sandman, 1992). Significant gender differences were found, with women found to be more fibre engaged and also more receptive than men to RS and its potential benefits. The pattern of association between fibre engagement and self-perceived risk of serious health conditions was consistent with previous observations of changes in risk perception at different PAPM stages. Participants\u2019 ratings revealed a general preference for healthy staples over indulgences as foods for the delivery of RS, with the margin in preference increasing markedly with increased dietary fibre engagement. This application of the PAPM illustrates its potential usefulness as a segmentation tool for the exploitation of community engagement with a relatively familiar health concept or behaviour in the promotion of a novel, related concept or behaviour.",

Intervening on more than one risk behavior simultaneously could be efficient, but the optimal goal framing remains unknown. MBC was designed to test which combination of two behaviors (one dietary, one activity) and two goal frames (increase healthy, decrease unhealthy) maximizes healthy behavior change across all four risk behaviors. N = 200 participants with all four risk behaviors [high saturated fat intake (Fat), low fruit and vegetable intake (FV), low physical activity (PA), high sedentary leisure screen time (Sed)] were randomized to one of four goal prescriptions: \u2191FV\u2191PA; \u2193Fat\u2191PA; \u2191FV\u2193Sed; \u2193Fat\u2193Sed. They used handheld technology and coaching to change one diet and one activity behavior simultaneously, while change in untargeted (collateral) behavior was also measured. The Familiarity hypothesis predicted best outcome from usual dieting behaviors (\u2193Fat\u2191PA). The Optimal Substitution hypothesis, based on behavioral economic theory, predicted best outcome from substituting healthful for unhealthful behaviors (\u2191FV\u2193SED). The Low Inhibitory Demand hypothesis, based on Baumeister\u2019s self-regulatory strength model, predicted best outcome from minimizing demand on self-control resources (\u2191FV\u2191PA). To scale all behaviors to a common metric, the primary outcome was healthy lifestyle change expressed as a z score reflecting improvement relative to the sample baseline for each behavior and averaged to yield a composite score. As predicted by behavioral economic theory, mixed linear models showed that \u2191FV\u2193Sed maximized healthy lifestyle change compared to alternative interventions [t(345) = 3.3, p = .001], producing a sustained 1 s.d. improvement in saturated fat intake as well as in both targeted behaviors. The untargeted decrease in saturated fat intake complemented the targeted reduction in recreational screen time (r = .29, p = .04). Paralleling observed behavior changes, \u2191FV\u2193Sed improved self-efficacy for changing FV (p < .05), Sed (p < .01), and, marginally, Fat (p = .09). Conversely, the traditional dieting regimen (\u2193Fat\u2191PA) produced less healthy lifestyle change than alternative prescriptions [t (345) = \u2212 2.09, p = .04], yielding sustained 1 s.d. improvement only in saturated fat. Relatedly, \u2193Fat\u2191PA failed to increase self-efficacy for targeted behaviors and decreased efficacy for FV and Sed (both p < .05). Increasing healthy low-rate eating behavior and decreasing unhealthy high-rate physical activity produced greater and unexpectedly sustained healthy lifestyle change than alternative prescriptions.",

The \u2018My Health Matters\u2019 project was designed to build partnership with members of the health economy to meet the challenge of increasing physical activity & healthy eating in three deprived areas of Stoke-on-Trent, UK. The project aims to develop & evaluate an intervention to reduce health inequalities by increasing physical activity & healthier eating as defined by the community. Results from phase I of the project will be reported including baseline mapping of the built environment using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) & a community survey. Methods: Environmental factors including convenience & proximity of physical activity spaces, greenspace & leisure facilities, neighbourhood connectivity/walkability, land use mix & population density, traffic, safety & crime, food outlets & restaurants, were measured using GIS mapping (calculated around each residential address). A community postal survey of randomly selected addresses (n = 343) across the three areas was undertaken. The Neighbourhood Walkability Scale was used to assess residents\u2019 perceptions of their neighbourhoods. Perceived health (SF12), social capital, fruit & vegetable intake & levels of physical activity (International Physical Activity Questionnaire) were also measured. Results: GIS mapping illustrated a lack of local access to fresh food outlets but easy access to fast food outlets. 76-96% of residents were within 300 m walking distance of green space, but these spaces were of poor quality e.g. not functional. Physical activity facilities were within walking distance for some neighbourhoods but not for others. The community survey demonstrated that self-reported health was lower than average compared to England. Negative perceived characteristics of the neighbourhood included; aesthetics (e.g. lack of trees), traffic hazards & crime. Most people surveyed enjoyed living in their area & on average had lived there for over 20 years. However, there was low perception of trust & problems with teenagers & vandalism. 70-80% of the sample were not eating the recommended portions of fruit & vegetables per day & 70% were sedentary i.e. not reaching 30 minutes of moderate physical activity 5 days per week. Conclusion: In general, the environments of all three areas were not supportive of healthy living, did not facilitate physical activity or help to promote healthy eating. Recommendations for community consultation & action (phase II) & directions for policy change will be discussed.",

The objective of our meta-analytic review is to critically examine the effectiveness of workplace physical activity and dietary behavior interventions on weight outcomes. Six databases were searched for English-written studies published between 1980 and November 2009. Two authors independently selected 43 studies which met inclusion criteria. Data could be extracted from 22 studies for meta-analysis. Methodological quality was assessed using a predefined checklist. The GRADE approach was used to determine the level of evidence for each pooled outcome measure. Results show there is moderate quality of evidence that workplace physical activity and dietary behavior interventions have a significant positive effect on body weight (14 studies; Mean Difference (MD) \u22121.17 kg [95% Confidence interval (CI) \u22121.54 to \u22120.80]). There is low quality of evidence for a significant positive effect on body mass index (14 studies; MD \u22120.3 kg/m2 [95% CI \u2212.45 to \u22120.15]) and on percentage body fat (7 studies; MD \u22120.86 % [95% CI \u22121.52 to \u22120.2]). No effects were found for waist circumference (4 studies; MD \u22120.67 cm [95% CI \u22121.96 to 0.63]), waist-hip ratio (4 studies; MD 0 cm[95% CI \u22120.03 to 0.03]), and sum of skinfolds (2 studies; MD \u22120.01 mm [95% CI \u22120.04 to 0.02]). Subgroup analyses showed interventions using an environmental component had a greater reduction in body weight (3 studies; MD \u22121.50 kg [95% CI \u22121.82 to \u22121.17]). Preventing weight gain by improving physical activity and dietary behavior among workers is recommended as the clinical relevance of the pooled effects are substantial on a population level.",

            "text": "Introduction: Risk perceptions are a key component in many health behavior theories. However, such theories often do not differentiate between cognitive and affective risk perceptions (or the way in which they interact), and it is generally assumed that any increased risk perceptions of either type are associated with preventive behaviors. The present study aims to differentiate between cognitive (perceived risk) and affective (worry) risk perceptions and explore their direct and interactive relationships with two health-related behaviors. Methods: Combined data from the 2003 and 2007 Health Information National Trends Surveys were analyzed using logistic regression with perceived cancer risk, cancer worry, and their interaction independently predicting two dichotomous variables: a) fulfilling the 5-a-day fruit /vegetable consumption guidelines (n = 7966) and b) engaging in any exercise in the past month (n = 8069). Results: Neither perceived risk nor worry was significantly related to fruit/ vegetable consumption. However, their interaction was significant such that those who had both the highest perceived risk and worry were the least likely to fulfill the guidelines (OR: .77, p < .05). With respect to exercise, worry (OR = 1.77, p < .01), but not perceived risk, was associated with exercise. More importantly, the interaction was again significant, such that those high in both perceived risk and worry were the least likely to report exercise (OR = .77, p = .01). Conclusion: Counter-intuitively, reporting both high perceived risk and high worry is associated with less exercise and produce consumption. This research may have important implications for interventions, which often do not differentiate between targeting cognitive and affective risk perceptions and may even strive to heighten both types of risk perceptions in efforts to prompt behavior change. In addition, this research may inform communication of risk information; optimal changes in health behaviors may be achieved when cognitive risk perceptions are lower, and affective risk perceptions are higher.",

Three separate randomized clinical trials using group based cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) however, have recently observed positive changes in disease endpoints in patients who had experienced breast cancer or adverse coronary disease events. Group CBT included 20-26 two hour sessions over one year. The trials all used strategies to reduce stress, improve mood, alter health behaviors and maintain adherence to medical treatment. These three studies all included women, used intent-to-treat analyses and adjusted for relevant covariates. Andersen and colleagues randomized 227 women who had been surgically treated for regional breast cancer and found after a median of 11 years follow-up, a reduced risk of breast cancer recurrence (HR = .55, p = .034), breast cancer mortality (HR = .44; p = .016) and all-cause-mortality (HR = .51; p = .028). Orth-Gom\u00e9r and collaborators randomized 237 women with acute coronary syndrome and found after a median of 7 years, a reduced risk of mortality (HR = .31; p = .009). Burell and colleagues randomized 362 women and men with acute coronary syndrome and found after a median of 8 years, a reduced risk of recurrent myocardial infarction (HR = .55; p = .007).

Patients (N = 227) surgically treated for regional breast cancer participated. Before beginning adjuvant cancer therapies, patients were assessed with psychological and behavioral measures, had a health evaluation, and a 60 mL blood sample was drawn. Patients were randomized to Psychological Intervention or Assessment only arms. The intervention was psychologist led, conducted in small groups, and included strategies to reduce stress, improve mood, alter health behaviors, and maintain adherence to cancer treatment. Earlier papers (2004, 2007) showed that, compared to the Assessment arm, the Intervention arm improved across all of the latter secondary outcomes. T cell blastogenesis was also enhanced. An interim paper (2007) clarified treatment mechanisms in the Intervention arm. First, patients were satisfied with the intervention, but it was group cohesion that related to better outcomes. Second, offering patients a stress conceptualization (Selye) and teaching them multiple coping strategies related to better health. Third, three relationships between treatment utilization and outcomes are noted: 1) Relaxation training was associated with both distress reduction and symptom lowering. 2) Patients\u2019 use of assertive communication with health care providers was associated with better health outcomes. 3) Intervention strategy use was also associated with fewer signs/symptoms and cancer treatment toxicities. After a median of 11 years follow-up, recurrence occurred for 62 of 212 (29%) women and death for 54 of 227 (24%). Intent to treat hazard analyses showed, as predicted, Intervention arm patients had a reduced risk of recurrence [Hazard Ratio (HR) = 0.55, P = .034] and breast cancer death (HR = 0.44, P = .016). Follow up papers (2009) have examined the covariation of inflammation and distress during the period of intervention delivery (2009) and in the months prior to recurrence diagnosis (2008).",

Median attendance rate to the intervention program was 85%. Risk factor and quality of life data were measured at baseline and after 6, 12, 18, 24 months. Hospital admission data and survival data were obtained from national registers. During 8 years of follow-up the intervention group had 41% less fatal and non-fatal first recurrent CVD rate, and 45% less recurrent acute myocardial infarction (AMI) rate than the reference group. The study was powered to examine the combined endpoint of fatal and nonfatal recurrent coronary event rate and found a positive significant difference between groups (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.42-0.83, p = 0.003). Subsequent analyses found a significantly reduced nonfatal recurrent acute myocardial infarction rate (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.36-0.85, p = 0.007), but no significant difference in all-cause-mortality (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.40-1.30, p = 0.28). During the first 2 years of follow-up there were no significant group differences in quality of life, but the intervention group had a significantly stronger optimism about the future. The CBT stress intervention decreased the risk of recurrent CVD and recurrent AMI. A dose-response relationship between therapy attendance rate and risk was observed. This has implications for targeting and strengthening of secondary preventive programs in CHD patients.",

In Stockholm women, we found marital stress to be a stronger predictor than job stress, but behavioral interventions to reduce such psychosocial stressors in women had not been identified. Based on previous findings, we implemented a cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) program for women and investigated its ability to improve survival in women coronary patients. Consecutive women patients, aged 75 years or younger, hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass grafting, or percutaneous coronary intervention were randomized to group-based CBT or to usual care. Intervention groups of 4 to 8 women met for a total of 20 sessions that were spread over a year. We provided education about risk factors, relaxation training techniques, methods for self-monitoring and cognitive restructuring, with an emphasis on coping with stress exposure from family and work, self-care and compliance with medical advice. From randomization until end of follow-up (mean duration, 7.1 years), 25 women (20%) in the usual care and 8 women (7%) in the CBT condition died, yielding an almost three fold protective effect of the intervention (HR = 0.33; 95% CI, 0.15 to 0.74; P = 0.007). Controlling for relevant demographic and medical prognostic factors in multivariate models, confirmed the unadjusted results. CBT improved survival independently of medication with statins. Additionally, an interactive effect of statins with behavioral intervention was suggested. In women who received both treatments, only one woman died, (1.5 %) as compared to 15 out of 70 (22 %) women who received none of the treatments(p = 0.007). We concluded that a group-based CBT program for women with coronary disease may prolong their lives. This effect may be independent of clinical prognostic factors.",

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most prevalent FGD and research shows a strong association between chronic stress and trauma in these patients. Due to the increasing knowledge on psychobiological mechanisms regulating adaptive processes to stress, research focuses on functional syndromes, which seem to be associated with maladaption of biological stress regulatory systems. This symposium refers to the different biological factors contributing to the etiology and maintenance of IBS. Besides prevalence rates on the high number of females with IBS, naturally occurring variation of female life conditions like menstrual cycle will be discussed with respect to the occurrence of IBS symptoms.

The biological results indicated that female IBS patients have intact circadian rhythmicity of the HPA axis. However, women with diarrhea predominant IBS (IBS-D) exhibited substantially heightened cortisol at awakening and nearly no morning increase. In response to the laboratory stressor significantly blunted cortisol (p < 0.05) and slightly attenuated ACTH secretion was observed in patients compared to controls. In the recovery period ACTH levels were significantly lower in patients than in healthy subjects (p < 0.05). Women with IBS perceived higher general and situation specific stress susceptibility.",

In both studies psychological stress measures were overall increased in the IBS group and propose heightened stress susceptibility. Biological data indicate an association between basal HPA axis activity and predominant bowel habit. Furthermore, the downregulated HPA axis reactivity in women with IBS following the laboratory stressor (TSST) suggests an attenuated sensitivity of the endocrine system. The strong relationship between stress experience and the occurrence of IBS indicates that stress-reducing interventions may be beneficial in such individuals.",

Short-term depletion of tryptophan from food (called acute tryptophan depletion, ATD) has been shown to provoke the respective symptoms both in healthy volunteers as well as in patients, but seems to work predominantly in women. Therefore, gender differences must exist in the serotonin metabolism and its utilization in the brain and in the periphery. In addition, genetic predisposition has been shown to exist that determines - among others - the effectiveness of serotoninergic interventions in patients, with drugs as well as with nutrients.

Prior to puberty there is an equal proportion of boys and girls with a diagnosis of RAP. The factors responsible for the divergence in prevalence after puberty are not clear. Studies suggest that both environmental (i.e., increased risk if a parent has IBS) and gender factors (i.e., changes in hormonal milieu) likely play a role. The incidence of IBS in both men and women appears to decrease in late middle age. The severity of GI symptoms, including abdominal pain, altered bowel habits, and bloating, varies across phases of the menstrual cycle as well as during the menopause transition in some women with or without IBS or other functional GI disorders. A limited number of studies indicate that premenses (days immediately preceding the onset of menses) and menses, compared with other cycle phases, are periods of increased GI symptom distress in women age 19-37. Women with IBS experience a greater impact of menstrual cycle on symptoms as compared to those without IBS. While not extensively studied, oral contraceptives appear to modestly reduce but not eliminate GI symptoms in those with IBS. This paper will present they hypothesis that declining or low ovarian hormone levels underlies the occurrence or exacerbations of abdominal pain/discomfort across the menstrual cycle and the perimenopause-early menopause transition in women with or without IBS.",

In this new situation a window of opportunity opened for knowledge exchange between academia, practice and municipal policy makers. Academia was expected to produce research evidence for applicable and cost effective interventions and policies. On the other hand, academia lacked contextual information necessary for tailored research evidence. Collaboration between these different stakeholders has proved to be challenging. The Danish model consists of 3 year contracts for junior researcher-practitioner positions, co-funded by the university and municipalities with the aim to carry out scientific project-based research relevant to municipalities. The 1st year evaluation of the collaboration with 3 case municipalities has shown as major benefits: increased access and use of research-based working methods in the municipalities; image lift of the municipalities; concrete products such as usable research results and lectures delivered; and support in project implementation. On the other hand, problems or challenges experienced have been: different working traditions and time scales; translating complicated research results into immediate and applicable practical know-how; lack of time and capacity for knowledge exchange; and sometimes lack of mutual respect and trust between stakeholders. All in all, collaboration and knowledge exchange has already in the 1st year lead to longer-term collaborative health policy planning; increased knowledge exchange; and also to an interest to start an evidence-based knowledge center within the area of health promotion. Challenges ahead lie in developing capacity building among all stakeholder groups; organizational barriers; development of \u2018service packages\u2019 including contextually tailored research information e.g. of health profiles of communities; implementation in practice and policy making as well as long-term follow-up of the implementation.",

Peers for Progress of the American Academy of Family Physicians Foundation is dedicated to accelerating the availability of best practices in peer support around the world. A major challenge is how to develop a coherent model of peer support that is applicable across widely differing cultural, organizational, and national settings. \u201cStandardization by function, not content\u201d guided development of a coherent yet broadly applicable and flexible model. Through a WHO consultation with experts from 20 different countries, literature review, and work with 14 grantees representing 9 countries, four key functions of peer support have been identified: assistance in daily management, social and emotional support, linkage to clinical care, and ongoing availability of support. These are implemented in varied ways, by telephone, individual meetings, group meetings, etc. but have been found applicable across varied settings. A second challenge is how to promote best practices in something that is as old as primates and widely implemented around the world. This has led to emphasis on promoting a coherent model of support around the key functions described above, but, then, working with existing programs to encourage information and model sharing, knowledge management, and advocacy through networks and collaborations focused at the national and regional level. Eventually, a network of networks would link peer support programs around the world, facilitating their quality improvement, helping them to achieve recognition of peer support as a key component of care through their own health systems, and, thereby, increasing their ability to reach the millions they might benefit.",

Theory-based health communication interventions aim to increase awareness and screening for this disease. The Health Belief Model is one of the most used models on which behavior change interventions and their evaluations are based. Previous work has been conducted to develop quality assessments of the Health Belief Model constructs in both breast and more recently in colorectal cancer contexts. However, instrument development initiatives have not focused specifically on disparities-affected populations such as African Americans. We present adapted instruments to assess Health Belief Model constructs, that were adapted/enriched based on qualitative research (e.g., focus groups) among African Americans. Two brief scales assess barriers to colonoscopy and fecal occult blood test, specific to the healthcare system. Internal consistencies were modest (\u03b1 = .33; \u03b1 = .43, respectively) and may indicate multidimensionality. A third scale assesses additional areas of colorectal cancer knowledge (\u03b1 = 78), based on the qualitative research findings. Factor structures and other psychometric properties are reported. Scores on the instruments were associated with screening behaviors. This work is consistent with the recent special issue of Health Education and Behavior, on \u201cBehavioral Constructs and Culture for Cancer Screening\u201d, in which it is suggested that traditional behavior change theories developed for mainstream US culture may need to be adapted when working with disparities-affected populations such as racial/ethnic minorities.",

Moreover, only little research has been done to examine the pathway through which SI affects health. Therefore we analysed the mediating effect of effort-reward imbalance at work (ERI) on this association. Methods: Analyses were based on a random sample of 1111 male employees (25-64 years) from the south-west of Germany. Data were collected by a telephone interview in 2008/09. Information on socio-demographic variables, social status indicators (education, occupational grade and income), occupational strain (ERI), and physical as well as mental health (SF-12) were given. Results: SI was significantly associated to low mental health, both directly and, consistent to our hypothesis, indirectly via low rewards. As SI was also related to low effort, no association was found for the quotient of both scales (ERI) and mental health. The effect of SI on physical health was entirely mediated by low rewards without any direct effect. The inclusion of further risk factors (age, BMI) did not attenuate these results. Conclusions: SI is significantly associated to ill health. Moreover, results indicate that at least a part of this relationship is explained by low rewards at work, findings with implications for further research in job strain and health inequality.",

The purpose of this study was to identify workplace challenges and self-management strategies reported by workers remaining at work despite recurrent or persistent LBP, to be used as a framework for the development of a workplace group intervention to prevent back disability. Workers with LBP (n = 38) participated in 5 focus groups, and audio recordings of sessions were analyzed to assemble lists of common problems and coping strategies. A separate analysis provided a general categorization of major themes. Workplace pain problems fell within 4 domains: activity interference; negative self-perceptions; interpersonal challenges; and inflexibility of work. Self-management strategies consisted of: modifying work activities and routines; reducing pain symptoms; using cognitive strategies; and communicating pain effectively. Theme extraction identified 6 overarching themes: knowing your work setting; talking about pain; being prepared for a bad day; thoughts and emotions; keeping moving; and finding leeway. To retain workers with LBP, this qualitative investigation suggests future intervention efforts should focus on worker communication and cognitions related to pain, pacing of work, and employer efforts to provide leeway for altered job routines.",

            "text": "Compared to non-obese women, obese women are at higher risk for colorectal cancer (CRC), but also have lower rates of CRC screening, particularly colonoscopy. We used mixed methods to better understand these disparities. We conducted seven focus groups on CRC prevention with obese (BMI \u2265 30) white and African American women (age \u2265 50) who were not currently adherent to colorectal cancer (CRC) screening guidelines (N = 31). Discussions and coding were guided by the Health Belief Model. Focus groups were followed by an online survey with 109 obese and 89 non-obese women. We used Chi-square to compare weight groups on screening barriers. Focus group revealed that women did not believe they were at risk for CRC and had poor knowledge of CRC prevention; they did not clearly understand the role of weight or screening in cancer prevention. Many were unaware of potential risk factors for CRC and were much more aware of potential screening barriers than benefits. Cost and time were the most frequently cited barriers to screening. Further investigation revealed that women\u2019s time and healthcare dollars were focused on more pressing co-morbidities. While most women relied on their physician to bring up important health issues, the internet was their most frequent source of prevention information. Survey data confirmed that obese women were more likely than non-obese women to agree they had too many other health costs (p = 0.049) or more important health concerns that took precedence over colonoscopy (p = 0.045). There were no significant differences by weight group in agreement with the more general cost and time barriers to colonoscopy. Furthermore, a higher proportion (p = 0.03) of obese women (41.1%) agreed that screening tests were embarrassing compared to on-obese women (28.6%). Obese women were more than twice as likely as non-obese women to agree that they would not need a screening if they did not have symptoms (p = 0.04). Treatment of obesity-related co-morbidities may take precedence over cancer prevention in primary care. Messages which focus on prevention and screening benefits may improve healthy behaviors in obese women.",

Gender differences exist in types of GI symptoms (women report greater problems with constipation while men more frequently report diarrhea) as well as other extra-intestinal symptoms.

Prior to puberty there is an equal proportion of boys and girls with a diagnosis of RAP. The factors responsible for the divergence in prevalence after puberty are not clear. Studies suggest that both environmental (i.e., increased risk if a parent has IBS) and gender factors (i.e., changes in hormonal milieu) likely play a role. The incidence of IBS in both men and women appears to decrease in late middle age. The severity of GI symptoms, including abdominal pain, altered bowel habits, and bloating, varies across phases of the menstrual cycle as well as during the menopause transition in some women with or without IBS or other functional GI disorders. A limited number of studies indicate that premenses (days immediately preceding the onset of menses) and menses, compared with other cycle phases, are periods of increased GI symptom distress in women age 19-37. Women with IBS experience a greater impact of menstrual cycle on symptoms as compared to those without IBS. While not extensively studied, oral contraceptives appear to modestly reduce but not eliminate GI symptoms in those with IBS. This paper will present they hypothesis that declining or low ovarian hormone levels underlies the occurrence or exacerbations of abdominal pain/discomfort across the menstrual cycle and the perimenopause-early menopause transition in women with or without IBS.",

Results: Lower levels of psychological distress (anxiety and depression) at baseline predicted a good outcome in the mebeverine group (\u03b2 = 0.388 (95%CI: 0.065-0.936), p-value = 0.025) but not in the mebeverine + CBT group. In the adjusted model for the mebeverine + CBT group less adaptive IBS related behavioural coping predicted a good outcome (\u03b2 = 0.285 (95%CI: 0.002-0.210), p-value = 0.045). Conclusion: Different factors are associated with outcome depending on the treatment received. At assessment clinicians should assess patients coping styles and may want to consider recommending CBT to those patients with IBS in primary care who are engaging in unhelpful coping behaviour.",

The high number of possible diagnoses offered by experienced GPs suggests that the conditions are composite, with a high level of comorbidity and the diagnostic system is unable to identify this. For this kind of patients there is no consensus on what kind of treatment to offer and we argue that the only available \u201ctreatment\u201d today is sick leave.

Results: The smoking prevalence was 12% (1 to 5 cigarettes per day) with no sex differences. Overall 80.5% reported exposure to secondhand smoke at the classroom or work place. Statistical differences were found between smokers (97.9%) and non smokers (92.8%) with respect to their knowledge of the negative effect that smoking has on quality of life (p = 0.02). 90.8% of smokers and 96.9% of non smokers (p = 0.004) agreed that smoking and non smoking areas should be established. 27.3% (p = 0.000) of non smokers thought that cigarette smoking should not be prohibited in all school areas, compared to only 8% of smokers. Compared with smokers (64.9%), non smokers (87.3%) are more likely to accept that the School of Medicine should be declared a tobacco free School (p = 0.000). Future research in medical students after the full implementation of the new anti-tobacco legislation is needed to identify changes in smoking patterns and their relation to compliance with the new law.",

Socio-cultural factors such as parental and peer tobacco use and exposure to direct and indirect pro-tobacco advertising are important predictors of smoking in all countries. For example, Malaysian female students are four times more likely to smoke if their mothers smoke. Having close friends who smoke is another significant predictor (range between four to over ten times more likely to smoke). Indonesian and Philippines female students exposed to tobacco advertising and promotion are twice as likely to smoke compared to females without such exposure. The study also found that females with pro-smoking attitudes, positive image of smoking and a perception that smoking is the norm among people their age are more likely to smoke.

Extant research has featured difficulty measuring public understandings of this relationship. This essay explores public understanding of the relationship between genes and behavior, especially with regard to the mathematical relationships to risk contribution. It also contributes a psychometrically valid scale for measuring beliefs about gene-behavior relationships. Methods: Three population representative surveys (N = 633, 658, 1218) were conducted using the Knowledge Networks panel platform. Results: Interpretations of risk vary depending on whether genes and behavior are conceived of as health-damaging (loss frame) or health-protecting (gain frame). In the loss frame, the majority of the population adopts an additive model of the relationship with approximately one third adopting an amplificative model. Scores on the non-mathematically based scale indicate higher belief in the existence of interaction than scores on the more concrete question format. Conclusions: The existence of different interpretations of gene-behavior relationships based on gain/loss frame and abstract/concrete modes indicates the need to select frame and mode carefully in both teaching and research. Research is needed to identify optimal configurations for teaching and presenting this relatively complex material.",

Moreover, if obesity has developed, it is difficult to control weight, and unsuccessful and disappointing weight reduction programs are frequent. In this study we wanted to investigate whether information about the genetic background of obesity is helpful for affected people to develop realistic goals and reduce negative self-perceptions. After genetic screenings of 1000 obese people, we included 320 for a randomized clinical trial evaluating the effect of genetic information versus general information (without genetic content) in obesity. A subgroup of 16 participants was confirmed for functionally relevant MC4R mutations, and they received consultation with genetic information. Their results were analyzed in detail. The acceptance of a consultation including genetic information was high, and those people with a family history of obesity appreciated to receive genetic information in the consultation. People with MC4R mutations reported less feelings of shame and guilt and more realistic weight loss goals after the intervention. We conclude that consultation for obese people should include information about genetic backgrounds, especially if obesity-relevant genetic mutations are obvious, or if people have a family history of obesity.",

Given the challenges in understanding how behavior can reduce genetically-conferred risk, there is a need to identify how to present information to optimize comprehension and adaptive behavior. Guided by the Common-Sense Model, we tested whether information about links between physiological processes underlying genetic risk, disease development, and behavior enhances beliefs motivating protective action and alters willingness to buy tests. We tested the impact of this information for genetic tests versus tests of a non-genetic biomarker, at higher versus lower risk levels, and when presenting risk information in graphic versus numeric formats. In an internet-based factorial design experiment, 782 adults responded to messages about a test for colorectal cancer risk. We varied messages by risk-action link information (provision or no provision of information describing how a low-fat diet reduces cancer risk given a positive result), risk increment (20%, 50%, or 80% risk given a positive result), risk format (numeric or graphic presentation of risk increments), and test type (genetic or enzyme test). ANOVAs revealed that providing risk-action link information enhanced beliefs of response efficacy (that low-fat diets reduce disease risk) and coherence (understanding how low-fat diets reduce risk), and lowered appraisals of anticipated risk with a low-fat diet (p\u2019s<.0001). These effects held across risk increments, risk formats, and test types. For genetic tests, provision of risk-action link information reduced the amount individuals were willing to pay for the test (p<.0001). Brief explanations of how action can reduce biomarker-detected risks promoted beliefs motivating protective action; paradoxically, by enhancing understanding of behavioral control over the risk, they reduced the value of genetic risk information.",

Much of the current treatment for cancer (including surgery and hormone therapy) involves temporary or permanent impotence or urinary incontinence which would be distressing for all men but particularly for those who are invested in their sexual performance or being in control as signs of their masculinity. Men may therefore forego treatment or delay it, leading to increasing risk of complications from prostate cancer. Presenters in this symposium will look at the impact of male sex role norms (including emotional restriction, emphasis on sexual ability, and being independent) on diagnosis for prostate cancer as well as recovery from treatment.

            "text": "Although the psychosocial impact of cancer treatment varies across cancer patients, many experience some psychological distress following diagnosis. In addition to the emotional experience, men with prostate cancer often face myriad physical complications including impotence, urinary and bowel incontinence, and sleep disturbance affecting quality of life. The time immediately following treatment can be a critical period marked by increased feelings of fear, uncertainty, and loss of control. Such emotional responses may be experienced as inconsistent with psychological attributes often associated with traditional gender role norms, such as strength, independence, and emotional inexpressiveness. Evidence of the negative impact of suppressing emotions, and positive impact of expressing and processing emotions on psychological distress, physical health, and overall adjustment to cancer is growing. Drawing upon examples from the author\u2019s past and current research with men with prostate cancer, the relationship of gender-related influences on emotional approach coping efforts will be discussed within a stress and coping framework. Emotional approach coping (EAC) refers to strategies that involve acknowledging, understanding, and expressing emotions, and has been found to be associated with decreased distress and better adjustment in breast cancer patients, though little work has examined EAC in men with prostate cancer. Observations in healthy populations suggest that EAC varies by gender and has been linked to both better and poorer adjustment in men. Prior research in men with cancer found that gender role norms shape EAC processes, and that the interpersonal environment and age may be important contextual variables characterizing its utility in men with cancer. Current research examining the impact of masculine cancer threat, gender-linked personality factors, and gender role norms on health-related quality of life following treatment for prostate cancer will be highlighted.",

While physicians are involved in the initial assessment of patients\u2019 problems, physical therapists typically carry out interventions to reduce pain and improve function. There is now ample evidence that psychosocial factors such as self-efficacy, fear of pain and/or movement/re-injury, catastrophizing, and social reinforcement contingencies contribute to the development of persistent pain and disability. In our research group at Uppsala University we have developed an integrated behavioral medicine and physical therapy treatment approach for patients with MSP that builds on basic motor and behavior learning principles and cognitive-behavioral principles. The approach comprises identification of problems and goals, monitoring of problems, functional behavioral analyses, basic and applied skills acquisition, generalization of skills, and relapse prevention. Evaluation of the approach involves clinical studies at both the individual level and group level and there are promising results at both short-term and long-term follow-up. Recent studies have focused on 1) targeting and tailoring of treatment based on screening of psychosocial factors and individual functional analyses, and 2) screening for psychosocial risk factors in telephone counseling. An emerging research area concerns implementation of the integrated approach in general clinical practice within PHC. Pilot work in our research group indicates that physical therapists may have greater difficulties in adopting this integrated approach than anticipated, lack of theoretical knowledge being one possible explanation. Further implementation efforts involve research as well as systematic integration of the approach in physical therapy curricula, the latter being done at two Swedish universities.",

The SARS outbreak in 2003 infected more than 8000 people worldwide and killed almost 800 people (WHO, 2003). SARS is an unusual and contagious form of pneumonia, caused by a novel strain of the corona-virus (Peiris et al, 2003). Compared to research available on the biological or physical effects of SARS, there are relatively few published articles on the psychosocial impact of SARS and, to our knowledge, no follow-up studies exist beyond 18 months. The present study examined the early and long-term psychological effects of SARS on patients who received treatment at a rehab hospital in Toronto after contracting the illness in 2003. Method: 40 post-SARS patients completed measures pertaining to their level of well-being and psychological and physical health. Patients completed questionnaires first in 2004, shortly after recovery from the acute phase of SARS, and again in 2007. Results/Conclusion: Our findings indicated that well-being, general health, mental health, and vitality significantly deteriorated (P < 0.05) from 2004 to 2007 in a large portion of the sample. Follow up study showed that, 87.5% of the sample population fell below average levels on measures of general health (based on the SF-36) in 2007 as compared to 48.6% in 2007. Symptoms of anxiety, depression and posttraumatic stress persisted or intensified in a significant portion of post-SARS patients (32.5% to 57.5%) 4 years after infection. This apparent persistence or elevation in emotional distress among SARS survivors was both unexpected and concerning. Since patients had seemingly recovered from the acute phase of the illness, one would have expected a decrease in their level of psychological distress over time. A closer look at the relationship between the examined variables may provide further insight as to the underlying causes of patients\u2019 persistent symptoms. Regardless of the cause, as it currently stands, SARS appears to be a chronic illness.",

There are, however, several indications that part of PC is unconscious and may be responsible for a considerable part of daily prolonged physiological activity. For example, worry itself appears to be associated with prolonged physiological effects, both during nocturnal sleep and in daily life, up to two hours after worry episodes. The existence of unconscious PC (UPC) is likely because most cognitive processes are (partly or entirely) unconscious. Moreover, several studies using subliminal (under awareness threshold) negative emotional stimuli suggest that unconscious emotional cognition increase amongst others amygdala activity and skin conductance level. We hypothesized that subliminal negative stimuli also increase more substantial, health-related parameters such as blood pressure.

Little is known about the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in mental stress (MS)-induced arrhythmias in coronary patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). T-wave alternans (TWA) is an established VVR marker. High levels of resting QT variability index (QTVI) and low levels of resting ejection fraction (EF) are other markers of increased arrhythmic risk. MS and Exercise (EX) differ in central and autonomic cardiac activation patterns. We hypothesized that ICD patients with high levels of TWA would have high levels of QTVI and lower levels of EF and that these linkages would be more pronounced during EX compared to MS. QTVI, TWA and EF were assessed at rest and TWA was also measured during MS (anger recall), and during bicycle ergometry in 43 ICD patients. HR rise during EX was higher than during MS (p < .001). After adjusting for HR, TWA during EX was significantly greater than TWA during MS, p < .05. Resting QTVI was associated with TWA during MS (r = .52, p < .01) and TWA during EX (r = .48, p < .01). Similarly, EF was negatively associated with TWA during MS (r = \u2212.43, p < .01) and EX (r = \u2212.38, p < .01). The strength of the associations between TWA and QTVI or EF did not differ between EX and MS, (p > 0.8). These findings indicate that abnormalities in QTVI and EF at rest may identify similar augmentation of VVR as TWA during EX and MS in ICD patients. The similar influence of MS and EX on indices of VVR suggests that both stressors are potentially pro-arrhythmic, yet the performance characteristics of HR-adjusted TWA are different across the stressors, consistent with the different underlying physiology of the two challenge tasks.",

We tested if deficient or insufficient 25(OH)D levels are associated with elevated depressive symptoms in an ethnically and racially diverse sample of adults. Methods: MESA participants with low depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Studies\u2014Depression Scale (CES-D) < 5; n = 408) or elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D \u2267 10; n = 244) but without chronic kidney disease had levels of 25(OH)D assessed. Potentially confounding (i.e., age, sex, race, income, education, body mass index, season of data acquisition, study site, amount of moderate and vigorous physical activity) and exploratory causal covariates were also measured (smoking within the past 30 days, self-reported history of diabetes mellitus, total cholesterol (mmol/L), low-density lipoprotein (mmol/L), systolic blood pressure (mmHg), diastolic blood pressure (mmHg), and anti-depressant medication (tricyclic and non-tricyclic use). Results: Deficient levels of 25(OH)D (<15 ng/mL) were present in 24.7% and insufficient levels (\u226715- < 30 ng/mL) were present in 59.4% of participants. Those with 25(OH)D deficiency were nearly twice as likely to have elevated depressive symptoms adjusting for confounds (odds ratio, 1.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05 to 3.58, P = ..035), and for exploratory covariates (odds ratio, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.08 to 3.96, P = .028). Results were invariant across sex, race, income, education, study site, season of data acquisition, body mass index, amount of moderate and vigorous physical activity and all exploratory covariates, although with low power to detect such differences. Conclusion: Vitamin D deficiency in diverse, apparently healthy adults is associated with a significant risk of elevated depression symptoms.",

Recovered persons may, however, display \u201cbiological vigilance,\u201d or physiological reactions to trauma cues. We examined this using measures correlated with aging-related morbidity and mortality: circulating levels of C-reactive protein and plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6), along with stimulated IL-6 production. Apparently healthy, postmenopausal women with divorce histories completed interviews to assess current and lifetime PTSD in response to past intimate partner violence, or other traumatic events. Women, all without current syndromal PTSD, were classified by history of PTSD diagnosis: none (PTSD-; n = 33), subthreshold (PTSD+s; n = 18), or syndromal (PTSD+; n = 12). Women attended two research visits; for each, a blood draw was followed by questionnaires that were either benign (Baseline Visit 1), or trauma- and PTSD-related, plus a diagnostic interview (Visit 2 Trauma Assessment). Mixed effects models tested effects for PTSD History, Visit, and the PTSD History x Visit interaction. For circulating IL-6 levels only, there was a trend for a PTSD History x Visit interaction, F(2,59.4) = 2.89, p = .06. Interleukin-6 responses to the two visits differed for PTSD- and PTSD+ women (p = .03). For PTSD- women, IL-6 levels were higher at Baseline than Trauma Assessment (p = .05). In contrast, for PTSD+ women, IL-6 levels were higher at Trauma Assessment than Baseline, although this difference did not reach statistical significance (p = .16). Further, at Baseline only, there was a trend (p = .06) for lower IL-6 levels among PTSD+ and PTSD+ s women, compared to PTSD- women. These preliminary results, limited by sample size, require replication. Tentatively, however, the pattern suggests that women with past syndromal PTSD may be characterized by baseline IL-6 hypoarousal, along with plasma IL-6 increases in anticipation of confronting trauma reminders.

The basic information for this study was obtained from official sources; trends of homicide rates by age groups 15-24 and 25-34 between 1979 and 2007 were analyzed; for each Mexican state, homicide rates by each age groups analyzed in triennial 2005-2007 were calculated; through the use of multiple regression analysis (stepwise method) the variables that better explained the interstate variations in the homicide rates were identified. The results show that the homicide rate in both age groups have diminished in last 30 years, however these rates are relatively high in the international context. Furthermore, although the male homicide rates are clearly higher in both age groups, this excess of male mortality has been notoriously reduced. Moreover impunity, drug trafficking, social exclusion and firearms possession are key elements to understand the geographic variations of the youth homicide mortality in Mexico in the analyzed triennial. In particular, drug trafficking has a great importance to analyze the variations of the homicide rate in 25-34 years old group. The found regression model equations explain more of 50% of the geographic variations of the homicide rate in both age groups. In this context, findings suggest that if Mexican government wants to reduce the geographical disparities in youth homicide rates, needs to develop new strategies to combat drug trafficking, establish programs to restrict firearm possession, and implement structural reforms to reduce poverty, social marginalization and socioeconomic disparities among states.",

Within the aggressors group around 30% were women and 70% were men. In the multivariate analysis for both genders, three are the variables that better explain aggressor\u2019s status: gender (OR 1.8), to be victimized for the family (OR 2.6) and to be involved in situations that unchain a police detention (OR 3). Conclusion: Before entering school the adolescent has blended a series of family experiences (interfamilial violence) and peer relationships (participation in gangs exhibiting criminal records) -that allow to forecast what could be the way of relating with schoolmates. Although the school becomes the new scenario where the adolescent has the opportunity to play a role already learned, in turn, this could become the field where the necessary transformation of risk behaviors and/or the learning of styles for social affront are mediated.",

Perceptions of violence were varied and gender differentiated. Men tended to perceive crime as violence and serious violence to involve bleeding, hospitalization or death. Women regarded fights, injuring others and crime as violence and ranked murder and rape to be serious violence. Women and men were reluctant to intervene in domestic violence because they perceived it as a private matter although several respondents felt that a husband has no right to beat his wife. Men, more than women, had direct experience with violence. Some men had been robbed, threatened and beaten. Several men had perpetrated violence: selling drugs during teen years, involved in illegal motorcycle racing, and assaulting a neighbour. A couple of women had been robbed. None had suffered any physical injuries/disability due to violence or reported symptoms of severe psychological consequences viz. disturbed sleep, appetite and moods. Yet, women were more affected by high anxiety and pervasive fear of being victims of crime. Men were more concerned about safety of their families, especially female members. Girl child kidnapping, rape and murder happening in and around the neighbourhoods had created secondary traumatisation and strong sense of vulnerability to such violence among women. Women particularly experienced chronic stress in coping with the daily crime and violence in their neighbourhoods.",

Community-based approaches have grown in popularity, in an effort to fight these cancer disparities. Though church-based approaches have been included among these initiatives, few are \u201cspiritually-based\u201d in nature, using spiritual/religious themes and writings to support the core health message. Such an approach may increase the cultural relevance of a health communication, and perhaps even its efficacy. The efficacy of a Community Health Advisor-led intervention to increase awareness and screening for colorectal cancer was examined using a randomized controlled trial, in which a spiritually-based approach was compared against a non-spiritual (e.g., secular) comparison intervention of same structure and content. Trained Community Health Advisors led two educational sessions on colorectal cancer. Study participants (N = 358) completed baseline, 1-month, and 12-month follow-up surveys. A 90% retention rate was achieved over the course of the study period. Within group analyses suggest that the spiritually-based intervention resulted in significant increases from baseline to one-month follow-up in colorectal cancer knowledge (p < .001), perceived benefits to screening (p < .001), and significant decreases in perceived barriers to screening (p < .001). Comparisons between the spiritually-based and non-spiritual intervention indicate that the spiritually-based intervention was more efficacious than the non-spiritual for increasing perceived benefits to screening (p < .001), while the non-spiritual was more effective for increasing knowledge (p < .001). Data are also examined among demographic subgroups such as men and women. Screening data at the 12-month follow-up are also reported. These findings suggest that the spiritually-based and non-spiritual approaches to health communication may have different impacts depending on the outcome and demographic subgroup being examined.",

Examples of different types of technology used in self-management programs that have limited research support include: text messages, telephone follow-up, web-based programs, and other internet-assisted education. But little is known about the applicability and feasiability of different forms of technology for patients with chronic diseases such as those with type 2 diabetes and critical cardiac conditions. Furthermore, although there is some evidence of the benefits of using IT in supporting self-management programs, further research on the use of IT in such programs is recommended.",

The aim of this study was to examine how these user reactions might be linked to users\u2019 engagement with five specific design features of the \u2018Internet Doctor\u2019, an Internet-based intervention to promote the self-care of cold and \u2018flu symptoms. The five design features were: social context and support; visual appearance; credibility; tailoring; and usability. Twenty six adults aged 18 to 63 participated in \u2018think-aloud\u2019 interviews. Inductive thematic analysis and techniques from grounded theory were used to identify recurring patterns within the data. Three user reactions were identified: users\u2019 trust of the \u2018Internet Doctor\u2019; users\u2019 anthropomorphic responses to the \u2018Internet Doctor\u2019; and users\u2019 preference for human involvement in their healthcare. These reactions appeared to be linked to differences in user engagement with four of the five design features (social context and support; visual appearance; credibility; and tailoring). For example, some users who trusted the \u2018Internet Doctor\u2019 expressed positive views of social context and support features (e.g. a question and answer format that was analogous to face-to-face dialogue; information about the \u2018real\u2019 doctor behind the advice) - using them as justification to trust the website\u2019s diagnosis and advice. In contrast, participants who expressed a desire for human interaction and were aware of their own anthropomorphic responses to the \u2018Internet Doctor\u2019 were uneasy about features that provided social context and support. Different user reactions were hence associated with different types of engagement with the same design feature. The implications of these findings for the optimal design of Internet-based health behaviour interventions will be discussed.",

The presentation/poster will include information about co-location, integration, and open-access as well as data regarding efficacy and model fidelity. Quantitative data will be presented regarding our universal suicide/homicide risk screening practice in primary care, our substance use co-integration initiative, and our integration project to address diabetes, HTN, and dyslipidemia. Qualitative data addressing primary care staff satisfaction with the program will also be presented. Four indicators of efficiency will be offered: (1) promptness of mental-health consultant availability, (2) market penetration (i.e., what percentage of patients seen are new patients), (3) brief visits to ensure rapid availability, and (4) efficient/cost-effective utilization of specialty mental health resources (e.g., psychiatry, psychology, social-work clinics). With regard to efficiency/cost-effectiveness, an integration program is considered more effective when more mild-moderate cases are treated in primary care, fewer referrals are sent to specialty mental health care and a greater proportion of specialty referrals are completed. These efficiency/cost-effectiveness markers offer an indication of whether a patient was appropriately triaged within primary care.",

Allocation of resources can be affected by stigma, thus reducing care available for people with stigmatized illnesses. This study surveyed participants on attitude toward people with chronic illness, homosexuality, conservatism and interaction styles. Five hypotheses examined factors affecting stigma toward people with AIDS as compared to people with lung cancer. Data were collected in survey form and analyzed. Results indicate that, within the study sample, AIDS was not as stigmatized as lung cancer, though disease in general remains stigmatized.

            "text": "Recent studies have suggested that patterns of spontaneous word use may be sensitive markers of psychological state (Mehl, 2006) and psychological change (Cohn, Mehl and Pennebaker 2004). The purpose of this study was to investigate linguistic markers of depressed mood and positive treatment response to Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for depression. Fifty partially remitted depressed individuals were randomly assigned an 8-week MBCT or control condition. Before and after treatment, participants rated 27 photographs (9 neutral, 9 positive, 9 negative) from the International Affective Picture System (Lang, Bradley and Cuthbert ,1999) on dimensions of valence and arousal. Following a delay, participants were asked to recall as much detail as possible for each photo. Verbatim responses were analyzed with LIWC2007 for 5 categories of depression-related content (positive emotion, negative emotion, sex, appetite, and death). Participants completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI: Beck & Steer, 1987) and the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS; Brown and Ryan, 2003) before and after treatment phase completion. At baseline, only words related to appetite were related to depression scores, while emotion, sex and death-related word use were uncorrelated. Use of appetite words were negatively associated with BDI scores (r = \u2212.32, p = .02) so that the actively depressed used less appetite words than those in remission (BDI<10), [t(50) = 1.8 p = .01]. BDI scores decreased significantly more in the MBCT group than controls [F(1,43) = 9.3, p = .004, d = .89], and improvements in depression were associated with increased appetite word use (r = \u2212.54, p = .006). MAAS mindfulness scores increased more in the MBCT group than controls [F(1, 43) = 8.6, p = .001, d = 1.02] and increases in appetite word use was associated with increases in mindfulness scores (r = .41, p = .05). Results from this study suggest that spontaneous use of appetite-related words in response to photographs may be a sensitive indicator of the appetitive deficits that characterize depression.",

            "text": "Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States. Physical impairment in COPD may contribute to reduced health-related quality of life (QoL). Increased symptoms of anxiety and depression among patients with COPD also may lead to reduced QoL (Di Marco et al., 2006). In addition, prior research has indicated that illness perceptions, specifically increased awareness of illness symptoms and greater perceived consequences, are associated with poorer QoL (Scharloo et al., 2007); and research suggests that a patient\u2019s age may influence attributions that patients make about symptoms -- with older patients tending to attribute illness symptoms to aging (Leventhal & Crouch, 1997). No prior studies have examined the relationship between age and illness perceptions among patients with COPD. The present study evaluated 75 COPD patients (mean age = 63.24, SD = 9.37 years) upon entry into an outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation program. All patients completed pulmonary function testing (FEV1, FVC), six-minute walk test, and self-report questionnaires, including the Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ; Weinman, Petrie, Moss-Morris & Horne, 1996). Data were analyzed with Pearson correlations. Results indicated that age was inversely associated with two dimensions of the IPQ, identity (r = \u2212.24, p = .0452) and consequences (r = \u2212.44, p = .0002). These associations remained significant after controlling for disease severity (FEV1). Thus, younger age was associated with increased attention to COPD symptoms and greater likelihood of attributing illness consequences to disease severity. These results suggest that beliefs regarding illness may be more salient among younger patients with COPD than among older patients who are likely to have had more time to adjust to the disease.",

            "text": "The medical experience of intensive care unit (ICU) is associated with many negative conditions such as isolation, loneliness, immobility or dependence, which have significant impact on patient status. Therefore, it is not surprising that patients report worse quality of life in both physical status and depression, anxiety and discomfort once being discharged from the unit (Garcia et al, 2003). Taking into account this fact and the importance of quality of life related to health, the aim of this study was to evaluate the differences in perception of quality of life reported by patients before and after admission to ICU. The study was based in 57 patients admitted to the ICU at General Hospital in Castell\u00f3n. Of these patients, 70.5% were male and 29.5% female, with a mean age of 53.6 years. From this study, we excluded people who had any communicating problem, and also people who suffer a prior psychological disorder. The participants, whilst staying in ICU and after giving their consent, were administered various questionnaires. One of them was the EuroQol in its Spanish version (Badia et al, 1999). The overall results show lower quality of life after admission to the unit (t = 13.65, p < 0.00). When evaluating the dimensions separately, significant differences are observed in all of them (mobility, self care, ability to perform usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression) for the total sample. When we analyzed the results by gender, we noticed differences before and after admission in all dimensions for men, whereas in women, no differences have been found in self care and anxiety/depression. Our results support findings in previous studies (Badia et al, 2008) suggesting that, although women have a worse quality of life before admission than men, these differences become smaller after the admission, showing a similar level of quality of life in both genders.",

Indeed, recruitment rates in recent published reports of behavioral interventions focused on health improvement in such populations range from as low as 13.5% to as high as 59%. Methods: We conducted post-intervention focus groups with 15 participants in the Making Our Mothers Stronger (MOMS) Project, a randomized behavioral intervention. MOMS participants were randomly assigned to either the experimental condition of a parenting skills intervention or to an attention-control condition of a health related behaviors intervention. Two focus groups were conducted with participants from each intervention condition. A focus group guide ensured consistency between groups and covered participants\u2019 response to the MOMS Project as well as their perceptions and recommendations about recruitment and retention. Three coders developed a codebook using constant comparison to identify major themes and sub-themes. Results: 87% of the focus group participants were African-American; their mean age was 41 years and 53% were single/never married. Identified themes included approaches to and venues for recruitment success, the role of key staff, effective and ineffective incentives, the impact of group process on recruitment and retention, and program resources that are needed. Discussion: Specific recommendations that emerged from the focus groups include recruiting in trusted venues, employing a persistent and encouraging recruiter who is sensitive to stigma issues, ensuring acceptability of recruitment materials through field-testing, ensuring social benefits of the intervention are immediate, and providing programs that are highly salient and practical.",

Despite the efforts made by quite a few researchers in identifying inherent conceptual and methodological limitations in the literature, only a few studies have explicitly addressed these issues. Among others, one such issue related to the use of global (unconditional) and conditional measure of risk perception. In this study, the significance of the associations between HIV-related risk behaviors and perceived risk of contracting HIV measured by two approaches (global and conditional sexual/injecting risk estimates) was tested and compared among a group of sexually active male injecting drug users in China. Of all 456 respondents, 82.5% had unprotected sex and 11.2% shared syringes with others for drug injection in the past six months. In response to the global risk perception, 12.5% perceived high chance of HIV infection. When the risk perception is conditional on unprotected sex and syringe-sharing respectively, the corresponding figures were 38.8% and 71.9%. Logistic regression analyses revealed that syringe-sharing was positively associated with global risk perception (Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 4.29; 95%CI = 2.07,8.92) but negatively associated with conditional injecting risk perception (AOR = 0.53; 95%CI = 0.29,0.97). Unprotected sex was not associated with global risk perception but was negatively associated with conditional sexual risk perception (AOR = 0.46; 95%CI = 0.27,0.76). There are some common and different predictors for the three measures of risk perceptions. The results highlight and confirm the importance of the choice of measures in assessing HIV risk perception. Overall, risk perception should remain an essential target of HIV intervention efforts for IDU.",

            "text": "The authors examined the relationship between symptoms of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and potential mediating factors among 40 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patient survivors. Participants were assessed twice within a 3 year time period: initially in 2004, shortly after they had recovered from the acute phase of SARS, and again 3 years later in 2007. Prevalence of PTSD among patients was 30% in 2007 compared to 15.6% in 2004. The association between PTSD symptoms and demographic variables (i.e., age at infection, age at testing, gender, education, marital status, and living arrangement), job type, severity of disease (i.e., ICU requirement, respiratory failure, low oxygen saturation, cardiac failure), duration of hospitalization, and duration of quarantine was identified using Spearman rank-order correlations. A stepwise regression analysis was performed for each of the PTSD symptoms of re-experiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal. All potential mediating factors (those identified in univariate analyses with a significance of P < 0.05 were entered into the analysis). Results indicated that age at infection significantly contributed to the variance in PTSD symptoms of hyperarousal and re-experiencing in 2004 (at P < .01 levels) and had an inverse relationship with these two variables. Duration of hospitalization significantly increased the R square value in predicting symptoms of hyperarousal in 2004. Interaction of age at infection and duration of hospitalization explained 33.5% of the variance in symptom of hyperarousal in 2004 (F = 7.06; df = 2, 28; P = .003). Severity of disease was the best predictor of chronic Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (F = 3.76; df = 3, 34; P = .020) and symptoms of re-experiencing, avoidance and hyperarousal in 2007. In conclusion, the findings of this study have important implications for the understanding, prevention and treatment of long-term psychological effects of infectious diseases.",

Most of the previous work has been conducted with men, especially gay and bisexual men. Relatively few studies have examined the use of the Internet for romance among women. Even fewer have had a strong theoretical base. In the present study, we recruited women (N = 255) from MySpace and other Internet venues to complete measures assessing demographic information, sexual behavior, and components of the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IMB) model. Overall, 31% of women reported that they had had sex with someone they initially \u201cmet\u201d online. Women who used the Internet for romance reported more partners in the previous 3 months (M = 2.74, SD = 3.86) than women who had not (M = 1.47, SD = 2.55), a significant difference (Mann-Whitney Z = 3.54, p < .001). Two components of the IMB model were associated with sexual risk behavior. Perceptions of peer norms for sexual activity (a motivational construct) were associated with higher numbers of sexual partners (rho = 0.27, p < .01). Higher self-efficacy for condom use (a behavioral skills component) was associated with fewer sexual partners (rho = \u22120.16, p < .05). In this study, the IMB component of information was not predictive of risk. Results suggest that risk associated with using the Internet to find partners is not restricted to men. Women in the present study may be at risk for a variety of negative outcomes of sexual activity, including contracting HIV or other sexually-transmitted infections, and unwanted pregnancy.",

Factors associated with non-disclosure include stigma, fear of rejection, fear of violence, and privacy concerns. In work with populations at risk for HIV, psychopathy (a personality characteristic associated with antisocial behavior and egocentrism) has been associated with substance use and sexual risk behavior. Little work has explored associations between psychopathy, disclosure, and risk in HIV-positive adults. In the present study, HIV-positive men and women (N = 310) were recruited from the waiting room of an infectious disease clinic. Participants completed a self-administered questionnaire assessing demographic information, disclosure of HIV status, psychopathy, and sexual risk behavior. The majority (74%) of participants disclosed their HIV status to all sex partners in the past 3 months. Individuals who did not disclose their HIV status to all partners scored significantly higher in psychopathy (M = 24.00, SD = 5.22) than those who had disclosed (M = 21.02, SD = 5.91; F = 7.98, p < .001). Higher psychopathy scores were associated with higher rates of having sex after drinking (rho = 0.20), having sex after using drugs (rho = 0.24), the number of sexual partners (rho = 0.13) and unprotected vaginal and anal sex acts in the past 3 months (rho = 0.13; all ps < .05). Higher psychopathy scores were also associated with lower intentions to use condoms with future partners (rho = \u22120.22, p < .001). Findings suggest that psychopathy is associated with risk behavior among HIV-positive men and women. Disclosure of HIV status has the potential to help reduce the spread of HIV.

Studies have suggested that personality traits have an influence on sexual behaviors to facilitate the HIV infection. Moreover, the perception of risk is one of the main factors to consider in sexual prevention of HIV. The aim of this study was to analyze the influence of personality traits on \u201cperceived risk of HIV infection\u201d, in a sample of 120 Spanish university students with a mean age of 19.79 (SD = 1.33). Data were collected from the \"AIDS Prevention Questionnaire\u201d (Ballester et al., 2004), which evaluates relevant variables to HIV prevention. Specifically, we have used the questions related to the component \"perceived risk\": perceived severity, probability of infection risk and perceived fear. Secondly, the Personality Inventory NEO-PI-R (Costa & McCrae, 1992) was used to measure personality traits. Results showed that perceived probability of infection correlated positively and significantly with Neuroticism (r = 0.257, p \u2264 0.005) and with three of its traits: Depression (r = 0.242, p \u2264 0.008), Impulsivity (r = 0.185, p \u2264 0.044) and Vulnerability (r = 0.243, p \u2264 0.008). Regarding to perceived fear, was observed a significant positive correlation with Impulsivity (r = 0.182, p \u2264 0.048) (Ns trait) and Gregariousness (r = 0.204, p \u2264 0.026) (Es trait). Finally, perception of severity got a significant positive correlation with Modesty (r = 0.222, p \u2264 0.015) (As trait). That is, people with higher scores on traits related to psychological distress, tend to perceive greater likelihood of HIV infection. While people with higher scores on traits related to social interaction, tend to perceive greater fear and severity toward the disease. In conclusion, personality traits are really relevant to understand significant variables of HIV transmission, as well as to understand risky sexual behavior and more vulnerable population.",

            "text": "Introduction: This paper reviews the existing literature on the psychological impact of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) on patients who contracted the illness following the outbreak of this atypical pneumonia condition. SARS was an infectious illness that spread to 29 countries in 2002/2003, infecting over 8,000 people, 774 of whom died. Method: A literature search was conducted on available electronic databases, including MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library. The search produced only a small number of articles published pertaining to the psychological symptoms and experience of patients (total of 28 original studies and 3 early reviews). No studies were found that assessed the emotional impact beyond 18 months post-infection. Studies used various methods of appraisal: self-report, standardized measures or questionnaires of original design, and a small number of studies employed hospital chart reviews. For the purpose of this study, the research results were divided into two recovery stages: early stages (<3 months post infection), and later stages (>3 months post-infection). Results: Early study variables that emerged included \u201cworry about infecting others,\u201d \u201celevated emotional distress,\u201d \u201cchanges in mood,\u201d \u201csymptoms of acute stress disorder,\u201d \u201cfeelings of stigmatization,\u201d and \u201cpsychiatric complications,\u201d such as the presence of psychotic symptoms (possibly secondary to steroid toxicity). Later stage variables included \u201cemotional distress\u201d, \u201cdepressed mood\u201d, and \u201cposttraumatic stress symptoms.\u201d Evidence of psychological problems developing in the later stages was also found in a small proportion of survivors. Conclusion: The limited number of published studies available for review consistently reported high rates of emotional distress in patients in both the early stages and later stages of recovery up to 18 months post-infection, with worry about infecting others, feelings of stigmatization, and psychotic symptoms emerging earlier in the recovery process. The levels of psychological distress found in these studies are similar to those reported in other comparable chronic physical illnesses. SARS remains a new disease, and the course of its development, both physically and emotionally, is still unfolding as time progresses. Longer term follow-up to determine the course of SARS patients\u2019 psychological status will help to guide treatment interventions. This, in turn, will help to inform the needs for future emergent, possibly similar, viral infections.",

In this context, different programs of prevention have been developed successfully, although there have been some barriers to achieve changing risk behavior. In this experience, dispositional characteristics have been revealed really important. Thus, considering the complexity of risk behaviors, we should improve our knowledge about mediator variables in HIV behaviors. For example, depression has revealed some influences related to HIV risk on different population but this has not been specified yet in youth. Our study analyzed the influence of depression on significance variables associated with HIV transmission, such as knowledge, attitudes, behavior and behavior intention. Participants were 170 students recruited from University of Castellon (Spain), 18-21 years old,. They were administered anonymously two questionnaires: NEO-PIR (Costa & McCrae, 1992) related to personality traits and AIDS Prevention Questionnaire (Ballester, Gil, Guirado & Bravo, 2004) about HIV/AIDS. Correlation analyses showed with significance statistical that more levels of depression are associated with higher personal risk perception (r = 0.242, p\u00a3.008), more condom use in regular partner (r = 0.229, p\u00a3.021) and less intention to have a sexual relation without condom (r = \u22120.193, p\u00a3.038). Depression factor is closed to reveal statistical significance related to information about HIV (r = 0.179, p\u00a3.051) but analyses have not showed any relation to confidence about condom (r = 0.026, .777), fear perceived (r = 0.107, p\u00a3.246) or condom use in sporadic partner (r = \u22120.071, p\u00a3.536). These findings suggest a complex influence of depression in youth risk in different levels such as attitudes or behavior. In order to improve prevention effectiveness, we should accurate our study about factors such as depression that have an influence depending on criteria variables and people profile.",

Not surprisingly, mental health needs frequently rise to the forefront of concerns clinicians must address prior to, or alongside, medical treatment. A better understanding of how to assess the psychosocial needs of this vulnerable population can help inform interventions to improve self-care and health outcomes. The preliminary data presented in this study includes 114 participants who have completed their initial visits of a study assessing coping styles as predictors of adherence in an urban sample of YPLH in the United States. The sample consisted of patients ranging from 13\u201322 years old. Using an Audio Computer Assisted Survey Instrument (ACASI), study participants responded to questions from a self-report mental health assessment instrument. Results indicated that only 10-15% showed signs of mental health needs that approached clinical levels. However, an examination of mental health screening records provided a clearer picture of the diagnostic profile of the ACASI respondents. When screened by a psychologist, nearly half of the participants were diagnosed with at least one mental health condition. Of these, 44% were diagnosed with a depressive disorder while 8% an anxiety disorder and 24% an attentive disorder. Several had multiple diagnoses. Clinicians treating YPLH should rely on methods beyond self-report tools to screen for mental health needs in order to develop a treatment plan and make referrals as appropriate.",

Poor health literacy in English has been observed among foreign-born Chinese, yet evaluation of health literacy has not been attempted in their primary language. To ensure the cultural appropriateness of health literacy tools for this population, we involved linguists, health educators, and clinicians in the design of new tools in Chinese, employing the same methods used to develop the Rapid Estimates of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM) and Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (STOFHLA), rather than direct translation of these established tools in English. We developed the Rapid Estimate of Adult Health Literacy in Chinese (REAHLC) scale, a 10-item word recognition test. We used the modified cloze procedure to design the Chinese Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (CSTOFHLA), consisting of two paragraphs drawn from existing Chinese health education materials with 35 multiple choice questions. Higher scores on both tools indicated higher health literacy. We pilot tested these tools with 32 adult Chinese immigrants (68.8% female; mean age: 49.6 years) recruited from a Chinese community health center in New York City. Participants completed the REAHLC, CSTOFHLA, a Chinese literacy test with 10 items in Chinese (CLT), and a demographic questionnaire. REAHLC and CLT scores were significantly correlated (r = .40, p < .05), though none of the tools\u2019 scores were associated with CSTOFHLA scores (ps > .05). Our findings provide beginning evidence that word literacy and functional health literacy may be different in Chinese. REAHLC scores correlated with years of education in China (r = .38, p < .05), while CSTOFHLA scores were negatively associated with age (r = \u2212.50, p < .01), respectively suggesting that individuals with higher education in China have higher word literacy and younger adults tend to have higher functional health literacy. Our study designed the first health literacy screening tools in Chinese that are culturally appropriate. However, further testing of these tools is needed in a larger, more diverse Chinese immigrant population.",

Various designs provide different information and quality of information, and this should be put in a perspective in the analyses and in the interpretation of the results from available data. Depending on how an outcome (e.g. return to work) is measured various statistical methods are natural. This presentation discusses the use of extended event history analyses in multi-state models for the analyses of sick leave data. Using multi-state models, one can exploit more of the data available in the evaluation of interventions to reduce sickness absence or the effect after rehabilitation programs. We show the advantage of multi state models uses two datasets as examples. The first data is from a randomised controlled trial (RCT) on 256 individuals with low back pain, while the second data is an uncontrolled study on 577 individuals with different diagnosis after an 8 week stay at a rehabilitation clinic. For the RCT we show that the intervention increases the number of days in work with 46 day during a period of three years, while for the uncontrolled study we find that 60 % of the participants return to work.",

In Period II (2000-2005), pharmacotherapy was conducted by a psychosomatician. In Period III (2005-present), CBT and holistic medical treatment were conducted by another psychosomatician. In the second year of Period III (Period III-2), to facilitate self-regulation, Self-Efficacy and Self-Evaluation Scales were developed with the following items: 1. Absorb fulfilling experiences, 2. Keep good memories, 3. Achieve the research goals, 4. Calmly express feelings, 5. Change one\u2019s mood to cope with or avoid stress, 6. Regulate drowsiness, 7. Assert own opinion, 8. Ward off unimportant things, 9. Keep appropriate distance from others, and 10. Keep good personal relationships. Items 1-6 were common to Periods III-2-III-5, whereas items 7-9 were used in Periods III-2 and III-3 and integrated into item 10 in Periods III-4 and III-5. In each session, the client rated her pre-practice self-efficacy and post-practice self-evaluation. Average self-efficacy and self-evaluation scores descended in the order of items 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 4. Self-efficacy and self-evaluation scores on items 7-9 increased from Period III-2 to Period III-3. Most of the problems occurred in the family and relatives area. The top three reasons for positive discrepancy of the scores (evaluation - efficacy) include fewer problems occurred, or there was less sensitivity to the problems, executed things in workplace or personal areas, and maintained good communications. Correlations among self-efficacy scores on items 1-3 and 5 were significant in Periods III-4 and III-5. These results suggest that the client became able to cope with the problems and stress. The significance of this research is discussed in relation to \u201cclients as researchers.\u201d",

Diabetes-related knowledge deficits and inadequate self-care practices has been identified among the majority of Malaysian diabetic patients with suboptimal glycaemic control. Rationale & Objective: The evidence available on management of diabetes mellitus via dietary education, improving the knowledge, attitude and behaviour (KAB) of the patient is rather limited. Existing validated questionnaires measure general diabetes knowledge, which are not specifically meant to measure KAB related to diet and there is no published data on a validated dietary KAB questionnaire unique to Malaysian diabetic patients. There is a need for a KAB questionnaire that is explicitly developed for Malaysians as dietary habits are unique and very closely related to the culture of the population. Thus, this study aims to develop and validate a dietary KAB questionnaire for diabetic patients in Malaysia. Methods: The content of the KAB questionnaire was developed, and its face and content validity was determined by a panel of experts. In total, 36 questions were administered in 30 type 2 diabetic patients attending out-patient clinics in 3 public hospitals. Internal consistency was determined using Cronbach\u2019s alpha (CA) coefficient. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to determine the reliability. The KAB scores were used to determine the sensitivity of the questionnaire. Results & Discussion: The Flesch Reading Ease score was 74.6% suggesting the questions were reasonably easy to understand.The CA was 0.72, while the ICCs were between 0.71 and 0.92. There was no significant difference in test-retest mean KAB score, indicating the questionnaire is sensitive enough to detect the changes in patients\u2019 response. Conclusion: A reliable KAB measure of dietary education for Malaysian diabetic patients has been developed and validated.",

To overcome this concern, ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and the day reconstruction method (DRM) have recently been used, but the validity of these methods has not been objectively examined. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the validity of EMA and DRM by using physical activity level (PAL) as an objective external criterion. Twenty-two healthy undergraduates (age 21.9 \u00b1 2.6 yrs) wore a watch-type computer and recorded visual analog scales of fatigue and depressive mood at different EMA design; recorded momentary symptoms every two hours (time-based) and recorded the symptoms during the behavioral episode which was just finished when switching one behavior to another (episode-based). They also recorded the symptoms afterward according to the series of behavioral episodes they reconstructed (DRM) about the same days. PAL was obtained using an actigraph built into the watch-type computer. Multilevel modeling showed that the association between depressive mood recorded with time-based EMA and PAL averaged over 60 minutes around EMA recording was significantly negative (p = 0.002); however, depressive mood recorded with episode-based EMA and DRM had no association with PAL averaged over the period of corresponding episodes. As for fatigue, none of the methods showed significant association with averaged Pal. These results suggest that time-based EMA might have the validity against the objective PAL when assessing depressive mood in contrast to episode-based EMA and DRM. Though averaged PAL alone failed to confirm the validity of all three methods used in this study as assessment of fatigue, incorporating other PAL measures than a simple average might distinguish the validity of them and need to be investigated.",

VR distraction offers an alternative to pharmacological treatments that may cause adverse side effects. Although VR distraction has been demonstrated to be effective in laboratory and clinical settings, the method by which it works to combat pain remains unclear. McCaul and Malott (1984) hypothesize that pain processing requires conscious attention. A highly immersive distractor should leave less attention available for pain processing. This study examined whether a VR head-mounted display helmet increases the analgesic effects of interactive distraction. A head-mounted display occludes extraneous sights and sounds, helping a person feel \u2018present\u2019 in the virtual world, leaving less attention available for pain sensations originating outside of the virtual world. Seventy-three college students between the ages of 18 and 25 were exposed to cold pressor pain without any distraction intervention (baseline) and then two cold pressor trials during which they played a Nintendo\u00ae Wii videogame. They viewed the game on a 21\u201d TV or through a VR head-mounted display unit. The study used a within-subjects repeated-measures design, with the two videogame distraction trials presented in counterbalanced order following baseline. LOG-10 transformation was conduced on all pain tolerance scores to correct for skew and kurtosis. Results showed that pain tolerance during the baseline trial (M = 1.46, SD = .254) was significantly lower than pain tolerance during the helmet-on condition (M = 1.72, SD = .329), t(72) = -11.24, p < .001, and the helmet-off condition (M = 1.68, SD = .32), t(72) = -10.69, p < .001. Participants showed the greatest increases in pain tolerance in the helmet-on condition, t(72) = 2.82, p < .01. Further research is needed to determine whether these results could be replicated in a clinical setting.",

In this study we objectively examined neurocognitive effects of methadone in older adults (>65 years) suffering from daily chronic pain (osteo-arthritis). Older participants (mean age 76 years) were evaluated twice at baseline (prior to the start of medication) and again 24hours after initial dose and again after 5 and 21 days of medication. Subjective ratings of pain along with objective testing of memory, attention and concentration were measured. Physiologic measurement of medication effects (pupil size) were also obtained. Results indicate a slight decline in weekly pain ratings (NS) and a modest drop in pupil size (NS). Neurocognitive tests indicated no significant change from baseline on measures of memory (HVLT), concentration (D2), reaction time or global cognitive measures (MMSE). There was an improvement on a measure of working memory (p < .05) and a trend toward improvement on an attention task (p < .06). Global measures of functioning did not change. Taken together, results suggest that older adults suffering from chronic non-malignant pain do not experience significant decrements in cognitive functioning in response to methadone. This may be consistent with findings of improved cognition with improved pain control observed in younger samples.",

            "text": "Fibromyalgia is one of the chronic pain syndrome most prevalent worldwide, but there are serious doubts about its origin and its causes yet. Its complexity difficults the diagnosis and, especially, the sick role experience of patients. In this context, showing a maladaptive illness behavior will produce a negative interference in daily lives of these people, increasing their subjective distress. To improve our knowledge about this topic, our pilot study compares the responses between a group of fibromyalgia patients (N = 16) and a control group (N = 13), all of them women, with a mean age of 44. All participants belonged to a local association (Association of Fibromyalgia of Onda). The evaluation instrument was a Spanish adaptation of Illness Behavior Questionnaire (IBQ - Pillowsky and Spencer, 1983) by Ballester (1992), which evaluates attitudes and feelings about the disease, the perception of the reactions of others, and their own perception about the psychosocial situation. Data show higher scores on IBQ factors of all patients with fibromyalgia compared with controls. We got statistically significant in: hypochondriasis (t = 2.247, p \u2264 0.032), disease conviction (t = 2.121, p \u2264 0.042), psychologic vs. somatic focus (t = 3.042, p \u2264 0.005), affective disturbance (t = 2.814, p \u2264 0.008), denial of psychosocial problems (t = 3.865, p \u2264 0.001) and Whiteley Index of Hypochondriasis (t = 3.271, p \u2264 0.003. These results indicate that people who are suffering fibromyalgia have higher predisposition to somatization and seek medical treatment. Moreover, they also show a tendency toward depression and anxiety as a result of the disease. This information will facilitate the comprehension and diagnosis of abnormal illness behaviours to treat fibromyalgia patients with more effectiveness",

We previously tested a model including constructs from ICF and Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) using structural equation modelling; it fitted better and explained more variance than ICF or SCT alone. The current study replicated that study with a new sample from the same population (orthopedic patients awaiting joint replacement), and extended the tests to after surgery. Two weeks before surgery, 342 orthopedic patients with chronic pain (most having arthritis) completed a questionnaire assessing impairment and activity limitations plus SCT variables (Self-Efficacy and Outcome Expectancy). One year after surgery, when both impairment and activity limitations were reduced, 228 completed the questionnaire again. We imposed the statistical models found in our previous study (before and after surgery) using structural equation modelling, with NNFI, CFI, RMSEA fit indices) to predict activity limitations. Before surgery, findings were very similar to our previous findings, with all models accounting for significant variance and fitting well, but the integrated model fitted better and accounted for more variance. (ICF: 35%; SCT: 60%; Integrated model: 64%). Each model showed stronger predictions after surgery, with the combined model accounting for most variance (ICF: 52%; SCT: 79%; Integrated model: 82%). On each occasion, all three predictor variables had significant coefficients. The integrated model provides a good explanation of disability in this population, superior to a biomedical or behavioral model alone, and identifies targets for intervention to reduce disability.",

We conducted an intervention study using group cognitive-behavioral intervention including the self-monitoring method. We performed a psychological assessment in order to exam SE, self esteem and stress responses, while also applying experimental protocol in the pre, intervention and post period stages. ANOVA of exercise volume disclosed significant group \u00d7 period interaction. The significant period effect was disclosed in exercise volume and total energy expenditure. In the post period, low SE group showed a significantly lower exercise volume than high SE group. Low SE group had a significantly lower exercise volume, total energy expenditure and step counts in the post period compared in the intervention period. It should be noted that this pilot study was conducted without a follow up period. In the future, we need to examine whether self-monitoring intervention effects physical activities in a follow up period. In conclusion, after we applied group cognitive-behavioral intervention including the self-monitoring method, we discovered that high SE promoted the habituation of exercise while also inhibiting the risk of rebound. Apathy was decreased in only the subjects categorized with low SE using group cognitive-behavioral intervention including the self-monitoring method.",

While regular exercise has been shown to be beneficial and is recommended as part of patient self-care, little is known regarding intention to initiate, alter, or maintain exercise in this patient population. This study examined the distribution of exercise stages of change and the biopsychosocial factors which differentiate readiness to exercise among individuals with SpA. Demographic and clinical data (comorbid disease, disease duration), along with self-report standardized questionnaires assessing functional disability, disease activity, depressed mood, perceived stress, leisure time physical activity, exercise self-efficacy, exercise pros and cons and exercise stage of change were collected cross-sectionally from a sample of 125 individuals with SpA. Data were analyzed by frequency analysis, ANOVA and chi-square. Fifty-two percent (52%) of the participants were in the action/maintenance stages for exercise adoption and 49% in the preaction stages (precontemplation = 20.8%; contemplation = 13.6%, preparation 13.6%). Patients in the preaction stages had more disease activity (p < .005), more functional disability (p < .001), higher perceived stress (pp = .008) and reported lower self-efficacy (p = .003) and less barriers for exercise (p = .008). Gender, age, socioeconomic status (i.e. education, income) and exercise pros did not differ across the stages. These findings suggest that strategies designed to improve exercise self-efficacy, reduce exercise barriers and emphasize the functional and emotional (i.e. stress reducing) health benefits associated with physical activity may be useful for patients with SpA who are less motivationally ready to engage in regular exercise.",

Therefore, a median split was calculated, and participants with low versus high scores were compared on the other (non-SRHI) survey items. Low-SRHI participants exercised significantly fewer days per week (p < 0.001) and their exercise patterns were more likely to change seasonally than high-SRHI scorers (p < 0.05). However, the groups did not differ in regularly of time (p = 0.52), location (p = 0.14), specific exercise behavior (p = 0.41), or weekly consistency of exercise (p = 0.36). Correlational and Fisher\u2019s exact test analyses suggested that individuals who demonstrated constancy on one objective measure of habit were likely to score high on other objective measures of habit as well (ps < 0.05).

The paper applied this theory to examine differences in decision processes of novices and experts in biking. It was hypothesized that experts, who rely on gist processing and less on knowledge, will use fewer information dimensions, reach unequivocal decisions with starker separations among categories, yet make high-quality decisions (as compared to a gold standard).",

Social facilitation is defined as an increase in response due to the presence of others (Allport, 1924). Several theories, such as the Self-Determination Theory (SDT) and the Cognitive Evaluation Theory (CET), have been developed to explain exercise behavior and the influences of intrinsic motivation on performance (Fredrick & Ryan, 1995). Some studies have suggested that competitive environments fostered by social facilitation enhance performance on motor tasks (Zajonc, 1965). It was hypothesized that a personality factor, such as competitiveness could influence the effect of social presence. Thirteen older adults (age = 78.6) participating in the Cybercycle Study (a randomized clinical trial investigating the neuropsychological, physiological, and behavioral effects of a videogame-enhanced stationary bike) were assigned to ride an exergaming bike while competing against virtual riders. Participant performances during one month (frequency and intensity of rides) were compared with the previous month\u2019s performances when no other avatars had been present. Results show that with the introduction of on-screen riders, as competitiveness increased, ride frequency decreased (r = \u2212.67; p = .01), while riding intensity increased (r = .55; p = .05). Social facilitation appears to interact with an exerciser\u2019s level of competitiveness such that it could enhance or detract from exercise goals, depending on the desired outcomes. This finding has interesting implications for prescribing various types of exercise according to personality style and desired exercise goals.",

Here, we proceeded in the research by investigating if poor sleep quality predicts more comprehensively depressive symptoms as defined by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). We used questionnaire data from surveys in 1975, 1981 and 1990 in the Finnish Twin Cohort. In 1990 12,063 persons had data on BDI in 1990 (response rate 77%). We excluded those who were in 1975 retired due to chronic disease or work disability, unemployed, used hypnotics or tranquilizers, or did night work. Our sample included 9,529 twins with no missing values on main variables. Based on self-reported sleep quality (five responses dichotomized as Good or Poor) in 1975 and 1981, we categorized the subjects into 4 groups: Good-Good; Poor-Good; Good-Poor; Poor-Poor. Out of BDI items we focused on the dimension Negative Attitudes Toward Self (NATS), including the items on self-dislike, sense of failure, guilt feelings, mood, self-accusation, pessimism, sense of punishment, lack of satisfaction, suicidal wishes, and crying (score 0-25). To examine sleep-depression-association, logistic regressions were computed for 7,476 persons without baseline life dissatisfaction. In 1990 14% of subjects had NATS depression (score > 3). When adjusting for twinship, sex, age, smoking, alcohol, somatic health, social network, emotional support, father relationship, and life events, poor sleep predicted depression significantly (Good-Poor OR = 2.0, 95%CI 1.4-2.7, p < .001;Poor-Poor OR = 1.9, 95%CI 1.1-3.3, p < .05). These results were replicated when controlling for familial factors among 38 twin pairs discordant for sleep and depression. We conclude that poor sleep independently predicts depressive symptoms.

This population is also at particular risk for making inaccurate subjective impressions of their insomnia symptoms due to a higher endorsement of unrealistic sleep expectations or worry over the effect of compromised sleep on daytime functioning (Morin, 1993).

The TTCC, which is a colored cards configuration memory task, was examined for sensitivity and specificity as well as reliability and validity. The sensitivity of the TTCC in detecting mild AD was 84% with a specificity of 87%. The positive predictive value was 89%, the negative predictive value was 82% and the predictive accuracy was 86%. The odds ratio of the incorrect response to TTCC with control group as a standard was 32.0 (95%CI,13.1-78.1, p < 0.0001) for mild AD group. Including the results of the re-tests, the Phi coefficient indicated 0.76 (p < 0.0001) and the consistency percentage between first and second trials was 88%. Spearman\u2019s rank correlation analysis, using MMSE as an external standard, revealed a significant correlation between MMSE and the TTCC results (\u03c1 = 0.58, p < 0.0001). Conducting the TTCC (including instruction and evaluation) was accomplished within 2 minutes for all subjects. No refusal or resistance to this test was observed among any of the subjects. The TTCC has proven to be of adequate sensitivity and specificity as a screening test for early detection of AD. Furthermore, administration time is short and requires no special training or skills. Thus, we believe the TTCC shows great potential for use as an AD screening test by a general practitioner in communities worldwide.",

Here\u2019s How\u201d and reassemble to answer questions about their preference and acceptability of the CRC screening options. Focus group data were audio taped, transcribed and grouped into thematic units using content analysis. We found substantial barriers by sex and geography, including urban residents received screenings during annual check-ups, while rural residents received screenings in response to symptoms. Of the 57 total barriers reported, four barriers were unique to urban Latino/Hispanic residents; and 13 barriers were unique to rural Latino/Hispanic residents. Low levels of health literacy, knowledge and awareness of CRC risk and screening were reported barriers across groups. The family unit and strong social support were also factors reported as influencing their CRC screening behavior. Participants identified barriers to CRC screening that fit into five categories: (a) physical environment, (b) structural factors, (c) sociocultural factors, (d) individual factors, and (e) physician-related barriers. Latino/Hispanic participants also identified potential strategies to overcome each reported barrier. These finding suggest that a targeted CRC screening intervention utilizing a physician- recommended home fecal immunochemical test with instructions is preferred among Latino/Hispanics over a non-targeted approach.",

Approximately half of CRC deaths could be prevented if screening were consistently implemented. The Transtheoretical Model postulates that behavior change occurs over time with people moving through stages of readiness to adopt the behavior. The aims of this study were to: 1) examine distribution across stages of readiness to screen for CRC among African American primary care patients; and 2) determine whether demographic and health belief variables predict stage of readiness to screen. Baseline data were collected via telephone interviews from 311 patients who were due for screening and enrolled in a RCT testing efficacy of a computer-based intervention designed to increase CRC screening. Ordinal logistic regression models were used to examine demographic variables and Health Belief Model constructs (perceived risk, benefits, barriers and self-efficacy) as predictors of stage of readiness to screen for CRC. The sample was 56% male and a mean age of 58 years. For FOBT, 51.8% of patients were precontemplators, 37% were contemplators, and 11.3% were in preparation. Those at more advanced stages of readiness to screen with FOBT were male (OR = 3.49; 95% CI = 2.20, 5.53), had a lower BMI (OR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.93,0.99), higher perceived risk for CRC (OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.10,1.87), lower perceived barriers to FOBT(OR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.53,0.98) and higher perceived self-efficacy for FOBT (OR = 2.27; 95% CI = 1.45,3.55). For colonoscopy, 39.7% were precontemplators, 51.6% were contemplators, and 8.7% were in preparation. Those at more advanced stages for colonoscopy had higher perceived risk for CRC (OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 0.99, 1.68), higher perceived benefits of colonoscopy (OR = 1.62, 95% CI = 1.18, 2.22) and higher self-efficacy for colonoscopy (OR = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.17, 2.51). Receipt of a recommendation from their provider was the most significant predictor of advanced stage for both FOBT (OR = 4.16, 95% CI = 2.63, 6.59) and colonoscopy (OR = 2.90, 95% CI = 1.85, 4.55). About half were thinking about being screened for CRC, with more considering colonoscopy than FOBT. Results provide evidence for strategies to move patients to action. Computer-based interventions that incorporate these strategies have great potential to move primary care patients forward in their stage of readiness to screen for CRC.",

Opinions were also shared concerning the use of tooth sensitivity to cold and that of nearby tissues as a clinical sign of pulpitis and dental abscess. Finally, the experts considered that some clinical signs were more important than others to detect erythematous candidiasis, hyperplasic candidiasis, mucositis/stomatite, infections of viral origin and xerostomia.

Recently, subjective SES has shown to be more predictive of health and cardiac outcomes than actual SES. Vital exhaustion (VE) is another risk factor associated with CVD and is characterized by feelings of excessive fatigue and demoralization, as well as in increase in irritability. To our knowledge, socioeconomic differences, both subjective and objective, with respect to VE, have not been explored.

Nevertheless, our society seems to refuse everything that could be related to illness, suffering and death. Daily we overhear news about unexpected deaths, which highlights the importance of being aware of one\u2019s death as a part of the cycle of life. The aim of this study was to analyze the main factors that could help to face the own death from young people\u2019s perspective. The sample was made up of 60 young people, aged between 18 and 27. All participants were evaluated by the \u201cHelping to Die in Peace Questionnaire\u201d (CAMP) by Bay\u00e9s et al., (2000), which is composed of two major items. The first one assesses the aspects that could help people to die in peace, answering to eleven sentences according to a 5 points scale. In relation to the second one, participants have to select the two most important factors when death is close, through the eleven previous statements. Results showed the following factors as the most relevant to young people: \u201cBeing able to be close, communicate and strengthen my bonds with loved ones\u201d (X = 3,1; SD = 0,8), \u201cTo think that my life has had some meaning\u201d (X = 3,0; SD = 1,1), \u201cTo think that my death won\u2019t cause an unbearable burden to loved ones\u201d (X = 2,9; SD = 1,1). On the other hand, the less important aspects were: \u201cBelieving in other life after death\u201d (X = 1,5; SD = 1,5), \u201cTo think that I may die at home\u201d (X = 1,8; SD = 1,3), \u201cTo think that my dying process will be short in case of suffering\u201d (X = 2,3; SD = 1,4) and \u201cNot to feel guilty about past personal conflicts\u201d (X = 2,3; SD = 1,4). The rest of the items reached intermediate values. According to these results we can conclude that young people give priority to emotional and existential aspects when they think about their own death, supporting other study carried through health professionals (Bay\u00e9s, 2000).",

Moreover, only little research has been done to examine the pathway through which SI affects health. Therefore we analysed the mediating effect of effort-reward imbalance at work (ERI) on this association. METHODS: Analyses were based on a random sample of 1111 male employees (25-64 years) from the south-west of Germany. Data were collected by a telephone interview in 2008/09. Information on socio-demographic variables, social status indicators (education, occupational grade and income), occupational strain (ERI), and physical as well as mental health (SF-12) were given. RESULTS: SI was significantly associated to low mental health, both directly and, consistent to our hypothesis, indirectly via low rewards. As SI was also related to low effort, no association was found for the quotient of both scales (ERI) and mental health. The effect of SI on physical health was entirely mediated by low rewards without any direct effect. The inclusion of further risk factors (age, BMI) did not attenuate these Results: CONCLUSION: SI is significantly associated to ill health. Moreover, results indicate that at least a part of this relationship is explained by low rewards at work, findings with implications for further research in job strain and health inequality.",

Spouse selection in the west is based primarily on falling-in-love whereas in India, selecting a spouse has been traditionally arranged. As a result of globalization, western influence in India is on the rise requiring a traditional society to modify its cultural norms. While arranged marriage is still prevalent in India, a new mode of marriage, love marriage, is becoming increasingly common. This transition introduces new social stressors, which may impact health. We hypothesize that traditional individuals will feel conflicted by the shift in cultural norms toward a more non-traditional system and possibly experience symptoms of depression. To test the hypothesis, a group of 350 college students in Mumbai, a major metropolis of India undergoing rapid cultural change in recent years were surveyed. We administered questionnaires measuring the influence exerted by tradition on mate selection and its health impact. Logistic regression analysis determined that traditional influence predicted the choice of arranged marriage (% Variance accounted for = \u2212.25; p < .005). Thus traditional individuals are more likely to choose an arranged marriage. Based on our hypothesis these individuals would be more vulnerable to cultural shifts and manifest symptoms of depression more than those choosing love marriages. The Mann-Whitney test results indicated significantly (p < 0.04) higher depression among individuals who chose arrange marriage. These results suggest that traditional individuals are more susceptible to feeling dysphoric secondary to the cultural changes taking place in urban India. This discontent could impact their health.",

However, little is known about variables that contribute to perception of social standing other than objective SES, which is only modestly correlated with subjective SES. Spirituality also impacts on health and may synergistically interact with perceived SES to predict health. It is hypothesized that Subjective SES will correlate positively with Spirituality. And spirituality and subjective SES will predict health outcomes after controlling for objective SES. Urban college students (N = 568; Mean Age: 19 years; 73.1% Female; Religion: 46.3% Christian; 37.3% Hindu; Other: 16.4%) in Mumbai, India completed questionnaires on Spiritual Well-Being (SWB) measuring Existential (EWB) and Religious Well-Being (RWB), somatic symptoms (CHIPS), subjective SES and objective SES. Results indicated that objective SES and subjective SES were positively but modestly correlated (r = .20, p < .001). There was a negative relationship between objective SES and SWB, RWB and CHIPS (r = \u2212.11, p < .05; -.20, p < .001; -.10, p < .05, respectively) and between subjective SES and RWB and CHIPS (r = \u2212.12, p < .005; -.20, p < .001, respectively). These data indicate that high SES - perceived and actual - is associated with lower engagement in prayer and relationship with a higher spiritual power and with fewer somatic symptoms than low SES. There was no correlation found between objective SES and EWB and subjective SES and EWB were positively correlated (r = .20, p < .001) indicating that perceived social standing is associated with life satisfaction and stability. These data indicate the complexity of variables that contribute to material and spiritual well-being and its interaction with health where subjectively poor people engage more in religious practice and do not experience existential satisfaction and report more somatic symptoms.",

The predicted periods of the ambulatory BP monitoring were 24-hours, morning, evening, and night. The participants were 95 healthy men with different BP levels from the Tampere Ambulatory Blood Pressure Study. The participants could be treated as one group, because the diagnostic BPs were normally distributed. The measures of social support were the total score of the Interview for Social Interaction (ISSI; Henderson, Byrne, & Duncan-Jones, 1981) and five subscales of it. The first sets in the hierarchical regression analysis had the respective diagnostic values of BP and HR as predictors. These were all significant predictors of daily cardiovascular measures as expected. In the second series of sets, the total score of ISSI and the subscale scores of it were added to the models, respectively. The prediction of ambulatory cardiovascular measures improved by up to 3% by adding the Adequacy of Social Integration (ADSI), a subscale of ISSI to the diagnostic SBPs. In conclusion, one specific measure of social support, the Adequacy of Social Integration (but not others) improved the prediction of cardiovascular measures in daily life. These results are in line with previous findings emphasizing the function of the quality of social support as a buffer in daily life.",

Psychological factors and health behaviors also helped account for the education-SBP association, but to a much smaller degree. We used data on a nationally representative U.S. sample of 15,701 young adult participants aged 24-32 years in Add Health, Wave IV, to determine whether a similar education-SBP association exists in a U.S. cohort and to examine several potential mediators of it. Individual education level was associated with SBP (p < 0.0001) as follows: Some high school or less, N = 1212, SBP = 126.0 + 14.1(S.D.)mmHg; Graduated high school, N = 2453, SBP = 126.6 + 13.9 mmHg; Some college or vocational tech, N = 6710, SBP = 124.7 + 13.8 mmHg; Bachelors degree, N = 2942, SBP = 123.2 + 13.1 mmHg, and; Graduate school or more, N = 1845, SBP = 122.0 + 12.7 mmHg. When the education-SBP association was adjusted for BMI, the 4.0 mmHg difference in SBP between the lowest and highest education groups was reduced to 2.7 mmHg. Further adjustment for gender, race/ethnicity, physical activity, alcohol consumption, smoking, marital status, employment status, income, presence of financial strain and home ownership reduced the SBP difference to 0.6 mmHg. These findings replicate in a U.S. cohort the finding in a French cohort of a robust association between lower education level and increased SBP. In the larger Add Health sample, this association was nearly completely accounted for by BMI, race/ethnicity, gender, marital status and lifestyle characteristics.

The workers were invited to fill in a self-administered questionnaire exploring their socio-demographic characteristics, occupational stress levels, and 12-item general health questionnaire. A hierarchical multiple regression procedure was used to assess the effects of occupational stress on mental health. RESULTS: After controlling for age, educational level, marital status and years of off-shore work, poor mental health was found to have a significant positive association with seven of the nine identified sources of occupational stress. They were: conflict between job and family/social life, poor development of career and achievement at work, safety problems at work, management problems and poor relationship with others at work, poor physical environment of the work place, uncomfortable ergonomic factors at work, and poor organizational structure at work. All of these occupational stress sources together explained 19.9% of the total variance. CONCLUSIONS: The results confirmed that occupational stress was a major risk factor for poor mental health among industrial workers. Reducing or eliminating occupational stressors at work would benefit workers\u2019 mental health in developing country like Nepal. There should be some meditation program, behovior change and rest for workers to reduce the occupational Health",

We induced emotion with aversive pictures in 20 subjects and using a breath control procedure to test a hypothesis that (a) Breathing control alters the visceral feedback as reflected in the insula activation (that reflects interoception), and (b) This leads to reduced fear as reflected in amygdala activation. Method: Subjects went through fMRI scanning while observing Neutral Pictures, Emotional Pictures and then practiced breathing control (Exp Group) or no breathing control (Control group). Results: (a) Aversive pictures activated left amygdale and right insula in the control group. (b) The activations at the same areas were altered in the experimental group that practiced the breathing control procedure. Discussion: Intervention of emotion-related breathing can modulate left amygdala activation indicative of reduced fear and this effect co-occurred with altered activation at the right insula cortex indicative of altered interceptive feedback. Conclusion: Breathing control therapy involves altered activation of insula and amygdala.",

This form of meditation is rooted in Buddhist Vipassana and Zen practices, and involves moment-by-moment, detached awareness and observation of the continually changing field of perception and its contents. Albeit the interest to verify the clinical efficacy of mindfulness practice has grown considerably in the last years, its specific psychobiological profile has been scarcely investigated, particularly with respect to the immune system, and this research does not seem to have been conducted, integratively, in clinical population. Thus, the present study was carried out to examine the effects of a mindfulness meditation program on immune parameters in a clinical sample. 16 patients with depression and anxiety symptoms participated in the study; these patients underwent a mindfulness meditation program for the period of eight weeks. For the quantification of immune parameters (leucocytes, immunoglobulins and complement), blood samples were taken before and at the end of the training program. T-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test were performed as statistical analyses. After completing the mindfulness meditation program, patients displayed significantly lower levels of monocytes and IgM, and higher levels of C3 and C4, as compared with pre-training. Therefore, these results show that mindfulness meditation may exert a significant immunomodulatory action in anxious and depressed patients, which may hold clinical relevance. Future studies should confirm these findings, as well as fully assess their clinical implications.",

Similarities between the neurochemical, endocrine, and behavioral consequences of immune challenge and stressors have been described frequently but the impact of immune stimulation such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or stressors on central or peripheral IL-1\u03b2 has not been systematically explored. To establish whether treatment of LPS or exposure to the foot shock stress (FS) leads to a changes in central or peripheral production of IL-1\u03b2 and what types of cells express IL-1\u03b2 in paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and hippocampus were investigated in rats. After treatment of LPS (100 ug/kg) or exposure to the FS (ten, 0.8-mA, foot shock for 5 sec each and 90 sec interval), fever were assessed and plasma, spleen, brains were collected to measure IL-1\u03b2 levels and brains were perfused for immunohistochemical study. LPS produced widespread increase IL-1\u03b2 in the brain, spleen and plasma, but FS produced significant increase in IL-1\u03b2 only in the brain but not in spleen and plasma. In confocal immunofluorescence study, LPS and FS increased IL-1\u03b2 immunoreactivities in the PVN and in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions and the IL-1\u03b2 immunoreactivities were colocalized with NeuN. Our results indicate that in brain both LPS and FS increase IL-1\u03b2 but in periphery only LPS increases IL-1\u03b2 and that IL-1\u03b2 immunoreactivities on neuron may play an important role in the hypothalamus and the hippocampus regions.",

            "text": "Heart rate variability (HRV) is largely regarded as a useful marker of cardiovascular functioning (Task Force, 1996). Despite disparities in cardiovascular disease prevalence, especially hypertension, researchers have also suggested that African Americans (AA) actually display greater resting HRV compared to Whites (Li et al., 2009). One proposed explanation for the greater rates of hypertension in African Americans is a greater peripheral resistance in the systemic vasculature (Dorr et al., 2007). In the present study, we sought to examine the relationships among HRV, and central (i.e. Cardiac Output|CO) and peripheral (i.e. Total Peripheral Resistance|TPR) hemodynamic measures. As part of a larger study, continuous measurements of HRV and hemodynamics were obtained for 34 AA participants (22 females, Mage = 19.8, SD = 2.7), during a five minute resting baseline period. Initial correlational analysis revealed a moderate association between resting HRV and resting CO(r = .29, p = .08). Analyses were then conducted separately for each gender. Interestingly, this association was stronger for AA females (r = .47, p = .02), but weaker and in the opposite direction for AA males (r = \u2212.09, p = .79). Separate analyses also revealed a strong relationship between resting HRV and TPR in AA men (r = .60, p = .04), that was not observed for AA women (r = .13, p = .61). In follow-up regression analysis the effect for AA women was attenuated when BMI was added to the model; results for men were not diminished when controlling for age and BMI. These results suggest that important gender differences may modify the association between autonomic nervous system activity and hemodynamic parameters associated with cardiovascular disease.",

To investigate the relationships of SOC scores to perceived health status and job stress, self-administered questionnaires were distributed 1968 workers in some industries. Complete answers were recovered from 295 workers (14.9%, 192 males and 103 females) and used for the analysis(179 office clerks, 28 sales representatives, 21 technical engineers, and 67 others). Work stressors, psychological and somatic responses, social support, and job satisfaction were assessed by Brief Questionnaire for Job Stress (BQJS). Perceived health were evaluated by asking subjects to give 1-4 points to their own status (1 very healthy, 2 rather healthy, 3 not so healthy, 4 unhealthy). Ages were 49.3 years on average (SD11.4)for all respondents, and were 50.7 (SD 11.6) and 46.4(SD 10.7) for males and females, respectively. SOC scores were 56.8(SD6.1)on average, without significant differences between two genders (p > 0.05). Multiple regression analysis indicated that, for both males and females, tension scores (BQJS) were inversely related to SOC scores, whereas were positively related to job load and stress by human relations assessed by BQJS (p < 0.05); tension scores were also inversely related to supervisor\u2019s support and job satisfaction (BQJS). Similarly, in males, depression scores (BQJS) were related inversely to SOC, job satisfaction and supervisor\u2019s support, and positively to job load and stress by human relations (p < 0.05). The similar relationships of depression scores to job load, supervisor\u2019s support and stress by human relations were observed in females (p < 0.05). Perceived health was not significantly associated with SOC scores in the multiple regression analysis (p > 0.05). It is thus suggested that SOC can reduce adverse responses to job stress(job load and stress by human relations).",

Evidence regarding the directionality of the depression-inflammation relationship is equivocal however, and indicative of possible complex and bidirectional associations. Methods: At the time of their index event (baseline), and then again 1- and 3-months later, 163 post-Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) patients completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), a measure of depression symptom severity with cognitive and somatic components. C-Reactive Protein (CRP) level was also assessed at these visits, as were known correlates of depression and CRP (i.e., age, sex, body mass index, education, race-ethnicity, mean arterial pressure [MAP], smoking status, history of rheumatic disease, and history of diabetes). Path analyses were conducted to evaluate the directionality of the depression-CRP relation and whether directionality varied by sex and/or specific symptom dimensions of depression. Results: Baseline total depression symptom severity predicted an increase in CRP from baseline to 1-month (\u03b2 = 0.23, p < 0.001) controlling for all covariates, as did baseline cognitive-affective depression symptom severity (\u03b2 = 0.28, p = 0.02). In contrast, baseline somatic-vegetative depression symptom severity did not predict an increase in CRP (\u03b2 = \u22120.01, p = 0.92). CRP did not significantly predict 1- or 3-month change in total, cognitive-affective, or somatic-vegetative depression symptom severity. Results did not differ for men and women. Conclusion: Cognitive-affective and total depression symptom severity at the time of a cardiac event predicted 1-month increases in CRP for both men and women, but there was no evidence that earlier CRP predicts later depression symptoms.",

Eight saliva samples were collected from the participants for two days at specific times after waking: immediately, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 3 hours, 6 hours, 9 hours, and 12 hours. Cortisol data of the two days were aggregated for analysis. The two components of diurnal rhythm, namely, awakening response and diurnal decline were examined separately. For the cortisol awakening response, two separate indices reflecting the mean level of secretion and the rise from immediately to 45 minutes post-awakening, AUCG and AUCI, were computed using the trapezoid formula. Similar procedure was applied to arrive at two indices of decline: AUCG-d and AUCI-d, from the peak level in the morning to that of 12 hours post-awakening. The relation of each of the two indices within each diurnal component to the availability, use and development of social network was examined in a multiple regression analysis while controlling for the effect of gender, age, socioeconomic status, waking time, humor, and self-esteem. Results indicated that higher scores in social network development were associated with a steeper rise in the morning (Beta = .32, t = 2.24, p < .05) and a faster decline over the day (Beta = .34, t = 2.38, p < .05). Participants having higher scores on this variable exhibited a stronger motivation to develop and extend their social relationships. Its effect on cortisol might stem from the positivity underlying the intention, which is consistent with what prior data suggest. None of the other variables included in the regression analysis had significant impact on cortisol levels. Findings of the present study suggest that the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis is the major pathway whereby positive psychosocial factors exert their health effects in the aging population.",

Saliva samples were taken before, during, and after TSST. Salivary IL-6 and CRP concentrations significantly increased by an average of 71% and 56%, respectively, compared to each baseline value. Both concentrations peaked during stress tasks and IL-6 and CRP levels remained elevated for 20 and 10 minutes, respectively, after the cessation of stress tasks. IL-6 response was moderately correlated to CRP response (r = .305, p < .05). These results indicated that both salivary inflammatory biomarkers are stress-sensitive and could be applied for stress research.",

This study examined whether frequent church attendance is related to disease progression markers (CD4 and Viral Load (VL)) over time in people with HIV, and whether these effects may be independent of spirituality. Methods: One hundred diverse participants with HIV (men, women, African American, Caucasian, and Hispanic) answered questions about church attendance and spirituality as part of a psychosocial battery. Participants were followed every 6 months for CD4 and VL changes over 4 years. Hierarchical Linear Modeling assessed whether frequency of church attendance was associated with slope changes in CD4 or VL (log) over time controlling for baseline CD4, VL, age, gender, ethnicity, education, and spirituality. Results: Church attendance was significantly associated with slower CD4 decline (t = 3.52 p =.001) but not VL. Note that the impact of church attendance was significant even above spirituality. Conclusions: Church attendance predicts slower CD4 decline in people with HIV, and these effects seem to be independent of spirituality. A discussion of why there may be benefits independent of spirituality will be discussed.",

We recently demonstrated that the difference on this weekday and weekends is an adequate responsiveness to adapt to stress.

Following the standard template of the Netherlands Society of Occupational Medicine and using the Intervention Mapping protocol, a draft guideline was developed based on literature, interviews with employers, OPs and employees, input from an external project group consisting of OPs and lifestyle experts, and input from independent lifestyle experts. Based on all sources mentioned above, the developed guideline consists of clear cut recommendations for OPs to 1) advise employers to promote employees\u2019 physical activity and diet and 2) counsel employees to adopt a physically active and healthy diet behaviour. Tools to implement recommendations consist of a minimal intervention strategy to counsel employees, and a scan to assess the obesogenic environment. The guideline is now being evaluated in a RCT among 30 OPs and 350 employees. If proven effective, this weight gain prevention guideline will be implemented on a larger scale within the occupational health services in the Netherlands.",

Several studies have pointed to the impacts of the FHP on improving child survival in Brazil. Few studies, however, have examined the mechanisms underlying the successful delivery of services in the community, particularly from the perspectives of the health professionals. The goal of this study, therefore, was to evaluate the perceptions of FHP professionals of Vespasiano, Brazil on training, workplace challenges, and practices for child health. This cross-sectional study involved interviews with 77 professionals using a mixed-methods approach. Data was double-entered and analyzed in Epi Info version 3.5.1. Open-ended responses were stratified by professional category, translated from Portuguese to English, and analyzed using a thematic coding approach. The results show that 92% of professionals received training in their first 12 months in the program but the majority found the training was limited in quantity, content, methods of delivery, and overall quality. Challenges in the workplace include insufficient government support, poor infrastructure, and lack of resources. In spite of these limitations, over 70% of CHWs reported promoting important health messages to caretakers and 87% of professionals were satisfied with the FHP child diarrhea services. In addition, the majority of professionals perceived the FHP is created for the needs of the community (83%) and is accepted by the users (81%). Translation of this research will be important for policies and program developments to improve on the limitations and promote the strengths of the FHP in order to advance Brazil\u2019s healthcare model to address leading causes of disease among the Brazilian pediatric population",

Current research has found that new nurses may be particularly vulnerable to job stress, and that stress levels among nurses are inversely related to job satisfaction. Purpose: To determine if nurse resident\u2019s (NRs) sense of group cohesion and organizational commitment serve as protective factors against the negative effects of pre-existing trauma and current stress on job satisfaction, burnout, and fatigue. Methods: A longitudinal study of 178 nurse residents (15 male, 163 female) from Childrens Hospital Los Angeles was conducted across three time points. Levels of pre-existing trauma, current stress, compassion satisfaction, burnout, compassion fatigue, job satisfaction, group cohesion and organizational commitment were measured. A range of regression models was developed to examine the relationships between the predictor variables (pre-existing stress and current stress), the moderating variables (group cohesion and organizational commitment), and outcome variables of interest (job satisfaction, fatigue, burnout, and compassion satisfaction). Results: Higher organizational commitment scores provided a \u2018protective\u2019 effect against pre-existing trauma with respect to compassion satisfaction (R2 = .35, p < .0001). Group cohesion was found to be a predictor of job satisfaction, and was found to have protective effects for job satisfaction from pre-existing trauma and current stress (R2 = .25, p < .0001); it also provided direct \u2018protection\u2019 against burnout, which was affected by current stress (R2 = .24, p < 0.0001). Pre-existing trauma was a strong predictor of fatigue, and accounted for 50% of observed variance in fatigue scores with (R2 = .50, p < 0.0001). Conclusion: Results from the study suggest that group cohesion and organizational commitment serve as protective factors against the negative effects of pre-existing trauma and current stress. The findings have implications for hospital-based interventions structured to address nurse stress, while enhancing group cohesion and organizational commitment.",

Psychosocial work conditions and OC were used to predict fatigue and poor next-day recovery respectively, in multiple regression analyses. Results show that having children living at home, high job demands and high OC were associated with fatigue six months later. Job demands and OC, but not having children at home, predicted poor next-day recovery. Sobel\u2019s test and bootstrapping procedure indicated that OC partly mediated the relationship between job demands and fatigue and between job demands and next-day recovery. These findings highlight the importance of considering OC, e.g. inability towithdraw from work, in relation to fatigue and recovery from work and that such factors should be included in interventions targeting work-related stress.",

The results of the first year are shown in the other paper, which shows that job involved factors may relate to a depressive mood of workers. The purpose of this year survey is to verify the previous results and examine if job involved factors increase depressive mood. Methods and Results: We performed screening of depression for 428 male and 249 female workers, who work in some small enterprises, during their annual medical checkup in 2008. They answered self-reported questionnaire including items screening for depression, living alone or not, work arrangement, working time, job demand, physical loads, job control, friendly work place or not, and job satisfaction. Following the first screening, 92 men and 63 women were determined as highly depressive. Among them, 87 men and 63 women were interviewed using CIDI-SS-RR as a second screening. Finally, 20 men and 12 women were detected as ones to be recommended for medical care. Highly depressive men by the first screening were more likely to live alone (p < 0.01), and had more job demand (p < 0.05), more physical loads (p < 0.05), less friendly work place (p < 0.05), less job satisfaction (p < 0.01) than non-highly depressive men. Highly depressive women by the first screening had more job demand (p < 0.05), less job control (p < 0.05), and less job satisfaction (p < 0.05) more than non-highly depressive women. Men that were recommended for medical care were more likely to live alone (p < 0.05) and had more physical loads (p < 0.05), less job satisfaction (p < 0.01), and less friendly work place (p < 0.01) than non-highly depressive men by the first screening. Women that were recommended medical care had more job demand (p < 0.05) than non-highly depressive women by the first screening. Depressiveness of 18 men and 14 women increased in 2008. There was the trend to increase in physical loads and decrease in work place friendship or job satisfaction among these men, and that to increase in physical loads and decrease in job control or job satisfaction among these women. Conclusion: These results will support our previous report, in which job involved factors may relate to depressive mood of workers, and these factors may relates to increase depressive mood.",

            "text": "Background and purpose. More than thirty thousand people commit suicide in Japan every year from 1998. Therefore, preventing suicides is one of important issues to be addressed in Japan. Our prefectural government also launched a project of screening for depression among workers in local area from 2007 in order to prevent suicides. Methods and Results: For the project, we performed screening of depression for 475 male and 284 female workers, who work in some small enterprises, during their annual medical checkup in 2007. They answered self-reported questionnaire including items screening for depression, living alone or not, work arrangement, working time, job demand, physical loads, job control, friendly work place or not, and job satisfaction. Following the first screening, 203 men and 129 women were determined as highly depressive. Among them, 138 men and 97 women were interviewed using CIDI-SS-RR as a second screening. Finally, 21 men and 22 women were detected as ones to be recommended for medical care. Highly depressive men by the first screening were more likely to live alone (p < 0.05), worked longer (p < 0.05), and had more job demand (p < 0.01), more physical loads (p < 0.01), less friendly work place (p < 0.01), less job satisfaction (p < 0.01), and lower job control (p < 0.05) than non-highly depressive men. Highly depressive women by the first screening were younger (p < 0.05) and had more job demand (p < 0.01), more physical loads (p < 0.05), less friendly work place (p < 0.01), and less job satisfaction (p < 0.01) more than non-highly depressive women. Men that were recommended for medical care were more likely to live alone (p < 0.05) and had more job demand (p < 0.01), more physical loads (p < 0.05), less job satisfaction (p < 0.01), and less friendly work place (p < 0.01) than non-highly depressive men in the first screening. Women that were recommended for medical care were younger (p < 0.01) and had more job demand (p < 0.01), more physical loads (p < 0.01), and less job satisfaction than non-highly depressive women in the first screening. Conclusion: These results suggest that job involved factors relate to a depressive mood of workers.",

This study examined the effect of working hours on fatigue and depressive symptoms among particular industries and occupations. Longitudinal data on 1,588 Japanese daytime workers (575 women and 1,013 men) were used to estimate the effect of working hours on fatigue and depressive symptoms. Working hours per week at baseline was divided into three categories: \u201cless than 60 h\u201d (N = 1,346, 84.8%), \u201c61-65 h\u201d (N = 87, 5.5%), and \u201c66 h or more\u201d (N = 155, 9.8%). Participants completed the Self-Diagnosis Check List for Assessment of Worker\u2019s Accumulated Fatigue developed by the Japan Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare, and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale at 1-year follow-up. Industries were divided into 13 categories based on the International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities, Rev. 4 by the United Nations. Occupations were divided into 6 categories based on the International Standard Classification of Occupations-88 by the International Labour Office. Analyses of variance were carried out separately for industries and occupations. Multiple comparisons with Bonferroni method indicated that in the manufacturing industry and professionals, the \u201c66 h or more\u201d group had a higher level of fatigue than the \u201cless than 60 h\u201d group (P < 0.05). In the human health and social work activities industry, the \u201c61-65 h\u201d and \u201c66 h or more\u201d groups had a higher level of fatigue than the \u201cless than 60 h\u201d group (P < 0.05). No significant association was found between working hours and depressive symptoms in any industry or occupation. Although reducing the number of working hours is essential to ameliorate workers\u2019 fatigue, special attention should be paid to workers in manufacturing or human health and social work activities industries and professionals who work long hours. Especially, workers employed in the human health and social work activities industry who worked at least 61 hours per week, showed higher scores of fatigue. This suggests that the association between working hours and fatigue is varied among different industrial sectors.",

Yet, the influence of individual factors such as general mental ability (GMA) remains to be examined. The present study set out to investigate how childhood mental ability and psychosocial work characteristics relate to different health indicators in a cohort of working women(n = 271) and men (n = 291). Specifically, childhood GMA and self-reports of job demands, job control and social support were linked to two positive health indicators (sense of coherence and self-rated health) and two negative health indicators(musculoskeletal problems and anxiety in midlife). Considering the gendered labor market and variations in health patterns between women and men, gender specific analyses were performed. Results revealed no linkages between childhood GMA and the health indicators included. Further, there were no significant interactions between GMA and the psychosocial factors. The overall impact of occupational level was low and controlling for occupational level did not change the results much. These findings are likely to result from the study cohort being fairly homogeneous and the women and men being in good health.",

The present study examined associations between cynical hostility (CynHo), MetS factors, and cardiac structure and function in 186 (81.7% Hispanic) post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients (69.4% men) with a mean age of 53.3 (SD = 8.8) years. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test a model of MetS. Primary MetS variables included waist circumference (WC), insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), glucose area under the curve (G-AUC), triglycerides (TRIG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and diastolic blood pressures (DBP). Secondary MetS variables included plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and a latent inflammation variable comprised of C-reactive protein and interleukin-6. Cardiac function variables were fractional shortening (FS), a measure of cardiac contractility, E/A ratio, a measure of cardiac compliance, and rate-pressure product (RPP), a measure of myocardial oxygen demand. Cardiac structure variables were left ventricular mass index, left ventricular posterior wall thickness at diastole, and interventricular septal thickness at diastole, which together constituted the latent variable cardiac mass (CM). The final structural model had good model fit (\u03c72 (102) = 100.65, p = 0.52, CFI = 1.00, RMSEA = 0.00, and SRMR = 0.04). Direct paths were supported between WC and CM and all MetS factors except TRIG and G-AUC. WC was indirectly associated with DBP via CM. WC demonstrated indirect relationships with the cardiac function measures. The model supported positive direct paths between HOMA-IR and G-AUC, TRIG, and PAI-1, but not inflammation or HDL-C. With respect to cardiac function, HOMA-IR demonstrated a direct positive association with RPP and direct inverse associations with FS and E/A ratio. CynHo had a direct positive relationship with HOMA-IR but none with WC. The relationships observed suggest that central adiposity and IR play a primary role in cardiac structural and functional impairment. The findings suggest that CynHo could promote the progression of metabolic dysfunction and cardiac disease via factors that influence the efficiency of glucose metabolism.",

The present study was designed to examine associations of disturbed psychophysiological responses with sub-clinical atherosclerosis. Participants were 543 healthy men and women (mean age = 62.9 \u00b1 5.7 yrs), without history or objective signs of CVD, drawn from the Whitehall II epidemiological cohort. Various cardiovascular (beat-to-beat blood pressure, heart rate variability) and biological measures (inflammatory and haemostatic markers, salivary cortisol) were assessed during and following mental stressors, consisting of a 5-min Stroop task and a 5-min mirror tracing task. Coronary artery calcium (CAC), a measure of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis, was measured using electron beam computed tomography. The tasks induced significant increases in blood pressure, cortisol, interleukin-6, and fibrinogen. Cortisol responders were at higher risk of having clinically relevant levels of CAC (odds ratio = 2.17, 95% CI, 1.37 - 3.41) after adjustments for age, gender, baseline cortisol, social status, depressive symptoms, and conventional risk factors. Cardiovascular responses were not associated with CAC. Basal levels of inflammatory markers were associated with CAC although the stress responses were not. These data support the notion that cortisol stress reactivity, an index of hypothalamic pituitary adrenal function, is one of the possible mechanisms through which psychosocial stress may influence the risk of CHD.",

Later, recovery from such stress has been studied for similar reasons. Our purpose was to study cardiovascular reactivity from a baseline condition, a relaxation to behavioral stress tasks and recovery from the tasks to a relaxation condition after the tasks. As data, we used the Tampere Ambulatory Hypertension Study data bank of intra-arterial blood pressure (BP) from the 1990\u2019s. The participants were 95 newly detected, WHO-classified, age-matched normotensive (NT; n = 33), borderline hypertensive (BHT; n = 30) and hypertensive (HT; n = 32) men recruited through routine health examinations. They underwent a 5-minute cue-controlled relaxation (R1) followed by 8 standardized behavioral challenges: a video game, arithmetic, social problem solving, imagery, a habituation test, a comic film, and the cold pressor test. After the tasks, a 10-minute relaxation period (R2) was started. Systolic and diastolic BP (SBP, DBP) and heart rate (HR) and were analyzed. First, in a mixed-design ANOVA, Time factor, R1 (the reactivity baseline) and R2 (the recovery baseline) was studied together with the groups. The Time x Group interactions did not differ for SBP, DBP and HR: Fs(2, 92) < 1.04. However, the direction of recovery was different for BPs and HR. During the recovery baseline, HR was lower than during the reactivity baseline. The reverse was true for both SBP and DBP. Second, R2 variables were compared in ANCOVA using R1 variables as covariates. Following main effects were obtained: SBP, F(2, 91) = 3.14, p < .05 and DBP, F(2, 91) = 5.98, p < .005. In Bonferroni controlled group contrasts, the recovery baseline measures showed differences between the hypertensive groups in DBP (p < .05, 95% confidence interval = 0.8 - 6.59) while reactivity measures had shown DBP differences between these groups only in the cold pressor test. In conclusion, intra-arterial BP and HR in NT and newly detected HT groups showed different patterns in reactivity respective recovery. These results are in accordance of some earlier research and show that optimizing the use of cardiovascular data requires that these different patterns are taken into account in the predictions of health risks.",

            "text": "The current study examined the changes in parameters underlying blood pressure in relation to anticipation, reactivity and recovery to stress. Further, it was examined how these vascular and myocardial parameters relate to cognitive appraisal in a real-life stressful situation. 24 men aged 19-28 (mean age: 23.5; SD: 2.5) participated in this study. Ambulatory blood pressure was recorded on a beat-to-beat basis before and during performance of a real life speech. Vascular and myocardial hemodynamic parameters (total peripheral resistance (TPR) and cardiac output (CO), respectively) were derived from the blood pressure waveform. Participants\u2019 appraisals were obtained prior to the stressor. Evidence was obtained suggesting a myocardial reaction pattern during the stressor. This finding is consistent with the hypotheses as the stressor is an active coping task. The anticipation was hypothesized to be a relatively passive situation and therefore expected to engender a vascular response. However, the reaction pattern during anticipation was myocardial. Finally, recovery was slower in the vascular than in the myocardial variables. Multilevel regression models (MLwiN v2.2) were used to analyze the relationships between appraisal and CO and TPR. During the anticipation period prior to the stressor, increased challenge was associated with decreased vascular resistance (Z = 2.70 p < .01) and increased myocardial reactivity (Z = 2.43 p < .01). During the stressor increases in challenge were associated with further increases in myocardial responding (Z = 2.03 p < .05) but relationships between appraisal and vascular resistance were not significant (Z = 1.82, n.s.). This study is among the first to examine the hemodynamic reactivity and recovery patterns to a real life stressor in conjunction with stressor appraisals. Furthermore, our findings suggest that challenge appraisals to real-life stressors contribute to an, arguably healthier, myocardial reaction pattern. This ambulatory study was followed up by a study aimed at changing appraisals and appraisal related hemodynamic reactivity patterns.",

Optimal use of these technologies requires that we advance our understanding of how individuals respond to health imagery, particularly since information processes for imagery differ markedly from those involved with linguistic information. This symposium reviews recent research on techniques using visual images to motivate behavior change. The speakers represent multidisciplinary teams of experts in psychology, sociology, communications, graphics, and information technology. Gerry Humphris will present research on using graphic warning labels on cigarette packets to motivate smoking cessation. Using data from a large community survey, his team found that images evoking disgust responses are potent triggers of motivations to quit. Gareth Hollands will present research on an intervention in which aversive images are used to condition responses that reduce motivations to eat unhealthy foods. This technique, based on implicit cognition and evaluative conditioning principles, altered implicit attitudes about foods and increased healthy food choices. Susan Persky will present research in which immersive virtual environment (IVE) technologies are used to motivate protective behavior. The studies demonstrate how IVEs can instill experiential knowledge of behavioral consequences and enhance understanding of complex concepts such as gene-behavior interactions. Brian Williams will present research on a framework for developing theoretically-guided interventions involving visual media. The four-stage process was tested in the development of an intervention incorporating 3D animation about links between obesity and arteriosclerosis. Throughout the symposium, discussion will address how the research informs theory on visual imagery processes in health behavior as well as the use of imagery in interventions.",

Pictorial images may be particularly effective in generating disgust emotion. Therefore the aim of this investigation was to test the specific image qualities associated with reported disgust and rating of potential success in promoting behaviour change. Data were obtained from a public consultation exercise (Department of Health, England and Wales, 2006) that requested, through a web-based answering system, participant preferences of 42 images that might be effective to encourage tobacco cessation in smokers. Initial results indicated preferences for effectiveness of cessation message were rank ordered according to the level of disgust emotion generated, i.e. images that might persuade smokers to quit tobacco consumption appeared revolting. To confirm that disgust emotion generated by the UK tobacco packet images was associated to the public\u2019s selection of possible effective images; three cross-sectional opinion surveys were conducted. These included students from medicine and psychology disciplines, and a section of the public. The web opinion consultation database was utilised for secondary analysis. A total of 291 participants were involved in the three convenience surveys and 19812 participants gave complete replies to the public consultation website. The pictorial Disgust Sensitivity Scale was used to assess the individual\u2019s rating of every image on a five category rating ranging from \u2018extremely disgusting\u2019 to \u2018not disgusting\u2019. Significant correlations (ranging from 0.91 to 0.94) existed between the image rank order aggregated preference ratings from the original public consultation and the average final score of the disgust ratings for specific items for the three groups. The correlations were very similar regardless of smoking status of respondents (in both public preference and opinion surveys). The emotion of disgust may be a possible intervening variable to explain the initial reactions to health promotion materials and smoking cessation. Future research needs to explore the strength of disgust emotions and fear generated by images of this nature with actual behaviour change and other intervening constructs.",

The diagnosis of cancer represents a threat to survival; consequently, both patients and physicians believe that transient sleep dysfunction in response is normal. Currently, relatively little is known about the etiology and evolution of insomnia in cancer patients. Emerging evidence suggests that a significant minority of cancer patients develop a chronic persistent form of insomnia as a result of the diagnosis and treatment of their cancer. Chronic insomnia is a substantial problem; in the general population insomnia is a risk factor for additional morbidity (e.g., depression, fatigue, heart disease). This symposium will first discuss the prevalence of insomnia and its progression over an 18-month period in a large sample of newly diagnosed cancer patients. The second presentation will describe the sleep architecture of cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Polysomnographic sleep findings revealing the prevalence of slow wave sleep (SWS) in cancer patients before treatment, following treatment, and at later follow-up will be discussed. Finally, results from a national randomized clinical trial of YOCAS \u00ae Yoga will show how a brief, community-based intervention of 4 weeks\u2019 duration can significantly reduce insomnia and use of sleep medication in cancer survivors, suggesting that persistent insomnia responds quickly to a behavioral exercise intervention and can be treated easily and effectively. The goal of this symposium is to disseminate exciting recent findings in the areas of sleep and cancer and to generate new ideas and an awareness of chronic insomnia in cancer patients so that its negative effects can be addressed.",

All patients scheduled to undergo surgery after a first diagnosis of non-metastatic cancer were solicited at their pre-operative visit. Among the 3196 patients approached, 1681 were found eligible and 962 (57%) accepted to participate. The participants completed a semi-structured interview for insomnia at baseline (T1), 2 (T2), 6 (T3), 10 (T4), 14 (T5) and 18 months (T6). The prevalence of the insomnia syndrome (T1: 28%; T2: 26%; T3: 25%; T4: 23%; T5: 21%; T6: 22%) decreased progressively and significantly over the 18-month period, F(5,3725) = 7.58, p < .01. Similarly, the prevalence of insomnia symptoms (including patients with an insomnia syndrome) decreased steadily and significantly over time (T1: 60%; T2: 48%; 46%; T3: 46%; T4: 41%; T5: 38%; T6: 37%), F(53725) =43.77, p < .01. Simple effects indicated that the decrease was significant between T1 and T2 and between T3 and T4 (ps < .01). Prevalence rates of insomnia symptoms were the highest in breast cancer patients (42-69%) and the lowest in prostate cancer patients (25-38%). The overall reduction in prevalence rates was reproduced for each cancer site except for prostate cancer patients in which the decline between T1 and T4, was followed by a resurgence of insomnia symptoms. Based on mixed models analyses, the incidence of insomnia among good sleepers at the previous time assessment was 20% at T2, 22% at T3, 17% at T4, 17% at T5, and 14% at T6. Insomnia is highly prevalent in cancer patients, particularly at the time of cancer surgery and then decreases progressively over time. Despite this overall pattern, insomnia symptoms develop in a significant proportion of patients during the cancer care trajectory, thus suggesting distinct patterns of evolution across patients.",

We conducted a nationwide, multi-site, phase II/III randomized, controlled, clinical trial examining the efficacy of yoga for improving insomnia. Non-metastatic, cancer survivors suffering from moderate or greater sleep disruption between 2-24 months after completing adjuvant therapy with no participation in yoga during the previous 3 months were randomized into 2 arms: 1) standard care monitoring and 2) standard care plus the 4-week (wk) yoga intervention (2 x\u2019s/wk; 75 min./session). The yoga intervention utilized the Yoga for Cancer Survivors (YOCAS\u00ae) program consisting of pranayama (breathing exercises), 18 gentle Hatha and Restorative yoga asanas (postures) and meditation. Insomnia was assessed pre- and post-intervention using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). 410 survivors were accrued (96% female, mean age = 54, 75% breast cancer). ANCOVAs with baseline covariates revealed significant differences in insomnia (ISI total score; p < 0.05) between groups at post-intervention with the yoga group exhibiting greater reductions in insomnia (CS = change score; CS = \u22123.49, standard error = SE; SE = 0.37) compared to the control group (CS = \u22120.89, SE = 0.29). ANCOVAs also demonstrated significant differences between groups in difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, waking up too early, sleep satisfaction, sleep interference, sleep-related distress and sleep problems noticeable to others (all p < 0.05) at post-intervention with the yoga group improving the most. ANCOVAs also revealed significant differences in sleep medication use (p < 0.05) with the yoga group reducing medication (CS = \u22120.21, SE = 0.09) while the control group increased medication (CS = 0.04, SE = 0.07). The brief community-based YOCAS\u00ae yoga intervention significantly improves insomnia and sleep components while reducing sleep medication use among survivors.

The relationship between adolescent mental health and medicine use (MU) has not received sufficient attention. The present analyses examine relationships of adolescent mental health and MU and whether mental health contributes to MU beyond the effect of experiencing symptoms of those health problems. Self-reported mental health, MU for four common health problems (headache, stomachache, difficulties sleeping, and nervousness) and symptoms for common health problems were assessed in a nationally-representative sample of 7,611 U.S. students in grades 6 through 10 and in 26,111 11-, 13-, and 15-year-old students in six countries participating in the Health Behavior in School-Aged Children study: Austria, Luxembourg, Germany, Switzerland, Macedonia, and Scotland. A brief measure of depression was included in the US HBSC survey and a broader mental health index (KIDSCREEN) was included in the surveys of the six European nations. In US adolescents, depression predicted MU for each of the four health problems but when both depression and symptoms were in the regression models depression added to the prediction for difficulties sleeping (p = .0071) and nervousness (p < .0001) only. These findings were replicated in the European sample; using hierarchical linear modeling, there no significant effects due to country. MU for each of the four health problems was predicted by mental health; however, MU for headache and stomachache were no longer significant when symptoms were added to the models. Adolescents with poorer mental/psychological health are more likely to experience symptoms of common health problems and to take medicine for these problems. However, self-reported symptoms may partially mediate the relationship between adolescent mental health and MU.",

Individuals may initiate BB because of either extreme dieting or chronic negative affect. In order to gain a better comprehension of BB and the main risk factors (thin ideal, body dissatisfaction, restrained dieting, and negative affect) two structural models were built and compared by sex (the DPM of women vs. the DPM of men) in order to detect which one of the group\u2019s models: a) shows more risk factors for BB, and which one of them b) provides a better understanding (higher explained variance) of the predictive role of the risk factors for BB. The total sample was formed by N = 196 college students, comprised of women (121) and men (75). The total mean age was M = 19.35 (SD = 1.75). The data collection used measures with acceptable psychometric properties. Among the main results, it was found that the DPM of women, when compared to the DPM of men, explained bigger amounts of variance (R2) of bulimic behavior (.48 vs. .26 ), restrained dieting (.52 vs. .27), and stress (.30 vs. .16), as well as higher beta weights in the interrelations of the risk predictive factors of BB. The structure of both models, i.e., the DPM of women and the DPM of men, allowed: a) confirmation of the theoretical proposition, which states that restrictive dieting is a predictive risk factor for BB, and b) to evaluate specifically which factor of the negative affect (stress/depression) contributes to a better understanding of the dependent variable, i. e., to gain a greater explained variance of BB.",

Group dynamics based, social cohesion intervention approaches may improve adherence and participation, but little is known about ethnic minority samples. This study investigated the role of social cohesion variables in a longitudinal study to increase fruit and vegetable consumption in obese ethnic minority women. Method: African American (n = 204) and Hispanic or Latina (n = 105), apparently healthy, obese (M = 34.5 kg/m2) women (M = 46 yrs) were recruited from community sites and randomly assigned to a 6-month social cohesion intervention to promote increased vegetable and fruit consumption (VF) or comparison group. Participants completed six content-intensive social cohesion building sessions focusing on small team based activities, shared goal setting and achievement and take home activities. Sessions were conducted separately by ethnic group. Interviewer administered and self completed questionnaires measured baseline (T1) and post-intervention (T2) sociodemographic, social cohesion and dietary habits variables. BMI was measured by trained health assessors. Results: Women in the VF group reported significant increases in servings (T1 M = 2.7, T2 M = 4.9) compared to comparison group (T1 M = 3.0, T2 M = 3.2; p < .01), regardless of ethnicity or dose. Participants also experienced significant increases in all domains of social cohesion measures (p < .001); however, this was not associated with outcomes. Conclusions: Obese ethnic minority women responded to dietary habits and social cohesion based interventions, regardless of ethnicity. Intervention participants consumed two servings more after treatment. Further research is needed to understand complex relationships among social cohesion variables and their change over time and how these can influence dietary habits and group adherence.

The purpose of this study was to determine stability-reliability of a 29 item instrument created to provide baseline data that would be used to develop a multi-level nutrition program for collegiate student-athletes. This survey also included demographic questions and was based on the Health Belief Model. Questions included measures of self-efficacy, perceived susceptibility, benefits and barriers. In addition, the Stages of Change Model was used to assess current nutritional activities. The survey was administered to a convenience sample of 41 collegiate-athletes and yielded 41 matched pairs used for analysis. A single item measuring Stages of Change resulted in a moderate correlation (r = .6), and 5 items on self- efficacy ranged from r = .33 -.68, for an overall moderate correlation (r = .6). There were 6 items that assessed benefits of receiving sport nutrition education (range r = .2-1.0) and 7 items that measured barriers to healthy eating (range r = . .4-1.0). These items yielded a total correlation score of .6 and .7 respectively. There were 15 items that measured nutritional knowledge. Because these items were dichotomous, a Kuder Richardson 20 (KR 20) test was used. Correlation coefficients for this subscale ranged from .03 to 1.0, for an overall correlation coefficient of .52. Items with correlation scores less than .06 were modified to yield more consistent responses and thus this survey shows promise as a potential valid and reliable assessment of collegiate athletes\u2019 knowledge, perceptions, and dietary practices. This information is essential when designing nutrition education programs and interventions for this population.",

The present study investigated direct and indirect associations between depressive symptoms, emotional eating and adiposity indicators across genders, and age and education groups, including whether emotional eating accounts for the association between depression and adiposity. The participants were Finnish men (n = 2325) and women (n = 2699) aged 25-74-year-old from the FINRISK 2007 Study (DILGOM substudy). Structural equation modelling was used to test the hypothesised associations. Depressive symptoms and emotional eating were modelled as latent factors with indicators derived from the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale and Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire R-18, respectively. Participants\u2019 body mass index (BMI), waist circumference and fat percentage were measured in a health examination. The mediation model had an adequate fit with the data with respect to all adiposity indicators in both genders. Higher depressive symptoms were related to higher levels of emotional eating (\u03b2 = .39 in men and \u03b2 = .31 in women), and emotional eating was related to higher BMI, waist circumference and fat percentage (\u03b2 = .26-.30 in men and \u03b2 = .22-.29 in women). The positive bivariate associations between depressive symptoms and adiposity indicators became non-significant in the models including emotional eating. Multigroup analyses indicated that there were no significant differences between genders, and age and education groups. Findings from this population-based sample indicate that emotional eating may be one factor explaining the positive relationship between depressive symptoms and obesity across different sociodemographic groups.",

The Hawaii Demonstration to Maintain Independence and Employment was a randomized controlled trial providing treatment group participants with individual life coaching and a pharmacist counseling while tracking health and employment outcomes. Self-reported diabetes self-efficacy, quality of life, functioning, hours worked, work productivity, and use of government services data were obtained at baseline, 6, and 12 months. Additional health information was obtained from healthcare providers. Generalized linear models for repeated measures are being used to evaluate the effect of the intervention. Surveys and focus groups were used to obtain participant perceptions about the intervention. 190 employed individuals diagnosed with diabetes or with indication of uncontrolled blood sugar were enrolled. Preliminary results show that body mass index and diabetes self-efficacy changes were significantly improved in the treatment group (p < 0.05). Treatment group participants reported greater work productivity improvements. Diabetes management improvements were frequently attributed to increased accountability and goal setting with a life coach, as well as nutrition and diabetes education provided by pharmacists. This presentation will discuss how participant engagement, perceptions, and intervention components may have influenced employment and health indicators. A diabetes management intervention was well received by participants and showed the potential to delay functional decline and reliance on government assistance programs. Findings have implications for employers, health care providers, and professionals using early intervention models intended to prevent disability and support the ongoing employment of individuals with chronic conditions. The use of Life Coaching and Pharmacists as counselors is an emerging service delivery approach. Further RCT research is warranted to determine the viability of this model for chronic disease management. Cost effective analysis would also be valuable.",

Other moods (e.g., anxiety, anger) often accompany depression and negatively impact diabetes outcomes. We tested the feasibility of the Study of Women\u2019s Emotions and Evaluation of a Psychoeducational (SWEEP) program to assess the effectiveness of group cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for treating depression and dysphoric symptoms in women with type 2 diabetes. Seventy four women with diabetes and co-morbid depression were randomized to the SWEEP program (n = 34) or usual care (n = 36). The treatment included 8 weekly sessions targeted at depression, anxiety, and anger. Sixty women (81%) completed baseline, 3 and 6 month measurements. Findings indicated a greater decrease in depression (CES-D) for the treatment (T1 = 26.8, T2 = 15.2, T3 = 12.6) as compared to the control group (T1 = 28.9, T2 = 23.3, T3 = 21.5), p = .03. Similarly, there was a greater decrease in trait anxiety (STAI) (T1 = 49.9, T2 = 41.2, T3 = 36.8) for the treatment group as compared to the control group (T1 = 50.5, T2 = 46.6, T3 = 45.3), p = .01. For anger (STAXI), although there were no significant differences between the treatment (T1 = 20.0, T2 = 17.3, T3 = 15.4) and the control conditions at any point (T1 = 18.0, T2 = 16.2, T3 = 16.0), there was a significant decrease in anger scores overall, p < .001. There was a clinically significant decrease in HBA1C in the treatment group from baseline to 3 months (T1 = 7.6, T2 = 7.2) however, it was not statistically significant and the improvement was not sustained (T3 = 7.4). There were minimal changes in HBA1c in the control group (T1 = 7.9, T2 = 7.9, T3 = 7.8). Overall, the SWEEP program significantly improved depression and anxiety outcomes in depressed women with type 2 diabetes. There were also favorable effects on anger and HBA1C. These data provide the first demonstration that depression, a common co-morbidity in women with type 2 diabetes, can be effectively treated in a group setting using CBT techniques.",

The current study compared the efficacy of a standard behavioral weight loss maintenance intervention (SBWLM) to a novel 12-week mindfulness-based intervention plus coaching tailored to WLM (Enhancing Mindfulness for the Prevention Of WEight Regain: EMPOWER). Community members who had lost a minimum of 9% of their body weight in the previous three years were recruited and randomized. Both groups received identical information about nutrition, physical activity, the importance of stress management, and values and goal setting. The EMPOWER group, however, was presented the information in the context of learning mindfulness skills to facilitate change. EMPOWER participants were also taught meditation, mindful eating, and mindfulness strategies to reduce stress-related reactivity while SBWLM participants spent equivalent time reading and discussing relevant material. Both groups were carefully structured to ensure parity in numerous factors (e.g., time invested, peer and interventionist support, positive expectancy). Mixed models determined that incremental weight regain rates did not differ by group. On average, both groups maintained their baseline weight loss 16 months later, one year post intervention (EMPOWER: \u2193 1.5 kg; SBWM: \u2191 0.9 kg). Weight regain rates were equivalent to or lower than those reported in other large scale studies (e.g., Svetkey et al., 2008, Dansinger et al., 2007). Only the EMPOWER group reported increases in intuitive eating (p < .0001), a trait previously associated with better physical health (Hawks, et al., 2005) and lower eating pathology (Tylka & Wilcox, 2006). Further analyses will determine whether metabolic and inflammatory biomarkers were impacted differentially by group. These data support the use of the EMPOWER program as a novel and effective approach for supporting individuals in the maintenance of weight loss.",

            "text": "The metabolic syndrome disorders (MSD) including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease are known to be triggered by lifestyle change. We state and support a hypothesis here that changes in behavior rather than changes in diet and metabolism are central to MSD. We provide and discuss evidence in support of the following sequence of arguments. (i) Diet, thriftiness and obesity centered paradigm is inadequate to explain most of the physiological and immunological changes associated with metabolic syndrome disorders (MSD). (ii) Comparative studies show that relative obesity rather than absolute obesity is strongly associated with various parameters of MSD and further perception of calories without actual change in intake of calories can induce physiological changes. (iii) Alternative behavioral strategies co-exist in animal populations which are associated with characteristic metabolic states and some of these states show close resemblance with MSD in humans. (iv) Obesity and MSD are strongly and cross culturally associated with certain behavioral traits. (v) Deficiencies of certain behaviors that evolved with hunter gatherer life as adaptive behaviors but that are deficient in modern life lead to corresponding dysfunctions of neuro-endocrine mechanisms. Through a meta-analysis study we show that deficiency of physical aggression is strongly associated with MSD as seen by neuro-endocrine mechanisms as well as epidemiological data. This raises a possibility that the effects of behavioral deficiencies may be reversed by behavioral supplementation. (vi) On a pilot scale, behavioral interventions substantially ameliorated many components of MSD without significantly changing body weights. All the evidence collectively indicates that MSD originates due to behavioral deficiencies rather than metabolic thriftiness and therefore behavioral supplementation may be effective in reversing the chronic conditions.",

A subcohort of the intervention group (IG(2007,) participants in 2007, N = 62) was followed up again 2 years after their participation. RESULTS: The follow-up survey 9 months after the beginning of the program (response rate: IG: N = 163, 75.8%; CG: N = 80, 94.1%) showed that 71.8% (N = 117) of the intervention group could remain in work as opposed to 60.0% (N = 48) in the control group. In the intervention group 14.7% gave up work due to OSD versus 22.5% in the control group (no statistically significant effect). In the 2-years follow-up (response rate: IG: N = 172, 80%; CG: N = 55, 64.7%) 58.7% (N = 101) of the IG remained at work versus 29.1% (N = 16) of the CG. In the IG 12.8% had stopped work because of OSD versus 27.3% in the CG (p < 0.001, Cramer\u2019s V = 0.26). Two years after intervention, the follow-up showed a stabilization of the effects shown by the 1-year follow-up Results: In addition to the criteria \u2018remaining\u2019 or \u2018not remaining at work\u2019 the results show that our interdisciplinary intervention program led to an increased and sustained knowledge on OSD and more adequate prevention at the work place in the IG. The results confirm that interdisciplinary training can be successful in effecting self-protection, behavior change against workplace hazards by using positive approaches that include the learning of \"safe\" behavior and insuring transferability to real workplace settings (\"empowerment\"). Combined preventive measures as studied in this program have recently become the standard offered by different statutory accident liability insurances for patients in different wet work occupations with OSD.",

The objective of the present study was to describe the psycho-social reactions to the epidemic, risk perception behaviors and compliance with the recommended control measures. An online questionnaire that was posted at the National University\u2019s Web page in May 2009, was answered by 13,690 students and employees. Knowledge, beliefs, perceptions, attitudes and behaviors in regard to both, the epidemic and the contingency, were studied. Results: 23% of the population believed that the epidemic was not real but in fact political manipulation, while 34% thought it was a new influenza strain. Worry was the most commonly reported feeling in the academic employees (74%), while students felt mainly confused or anxious (40%). The measurement of the chronological tendency of these feelings showed that at the beginning the population was mainly worried and anxious, then they felt confused, isolated and depressed, and finally they felt discriminated. Information was the most widely expressed need during the contingency and the University Web page was the most trusted source. 55% thought that the epidemic was more severe in Mexico than in other countries. The higher the perceived severity of the problem, the higher the acceptance of vigorous population control measures. Those that personally knew someone affected by the influenza A H1N1 virus were more likely to have sought the seasonal flu vaccine (OR 2.1, p < 0.0001). Contingency had the following social impacts on daily life: impossibility to assist to public entertainment places which were closed (68%), interruption of academic work (60%), increased time with the family (50%), more frequent hand washing (91%) and mask wearing (66%). Immediate behavioral research must be considered within epidemic preparedness plans.",

Weights and heights were self-reported. Those who had gained at least five kilograms during the follow-up were examined as reporting major weight gain. Sleep problems were measured by problems maintaining and initiating sleep, and non-restorative sleep during the previous month.

Also in 2007, the Alberta Colorectal Cancer Screening Program was launched, an initiative recommending all provincial residents be tested annually with FOBT (beginning at age 50) while in 2008, the Forzani and MacPhail Colon Cancer Screening Centre, opened in Calgary ( Alberta) the only non-hospital Canadian colon cancer screening facility. In Canada, only 40% report being up-to-date CRC screening using FOBT or endoscopy, with FOBT compliance especially suboptimal. The Canadian Institute for Health Research Team in Population-based Colorectal Cancer Screening was accordingly funded to investigate CRC screening activities in several provinces and to originate multiple activities, notably focus groups aimed at ascertaining optimal methods for promoting FOBT-CRC and Targeted and Tailored- Navigated Intervention Trials that directly test specific approaches to increasing screening uptake. In this presentation, a range of findings will be shared, as related to regionally-diverse Focus Group Studies, pilot studies of invitation letter promotions on a provincial basis (Ontario) and to individuals awaiting colonoscopies (Alberta); and Tailored-Navigation interventions directed at attendees of a large primary care practice where patient navigators undertake promotion/information related to screening promotion. Findings will also be shared from efforts in Saskatchewan, Canada to develop CRC screening management software.",

Symptoms without a serious medical cause are a nearly universal human experience, arising in the daily lives of perfectly healthy people. Some are a non-verbal interpersonal communication in which the individual seeks the acknowledgment from others that they are in distress and suffering, hoping thereby to secure special attention, support, and consideration. For some patients, a lifetime of medically unexplained complaints can be best conceptualized as a stable personality trait, one that has been associated with other enduring personality characteristics. Somatization can also be understood as a form of illness and sick role behavior -- not something an individual has, but rather something he/she does. Alternatively, emotional distress, particularly when combined with certain early childhood experiences of trauma, adversity or deprivation, can generate somatic symptoms. Preoccupied and fearful attachment styles that are learned in childhood can also lead to somatization in adulthood.",

We used data from the American Association of Diabetes Educators Outcome System, implemented in eight DSM education programs in western Pennsylvania, to examine the bivariate relationship between adherence to the DSM regimen and SE in changing specific behaviors and general SE in DSM among patients with type 2 diabetes. DSM regimen adherence was measured as the frequency with which patients followed their recommended DSM regimen, including medication taking, diet, exercise, and self-monitoring of blood glucose [SMBG]). Behavior-specific SE was measured by asking patients their level of confidence in making changes in these four DSM behaviors. Higher scores indicated greater adherence or confidence. General SE in DSM was measured by asking \u201cHow sure are you that you can manage your diabetes?\u201d with four responses (A lot/ some/ a little/ not at all). We used correlation and simple linear regression to analyze the data. The sample (N = 709) was 88.3% white and 53.8% female, with a mean age of 58.2 years and an average of 7.9 years since diagnosis of diabetes. We observed a stronger relationship with SE in changing diet (r = .29, p < .001) and exercise (r = .21, p < .05) and the corresponding adherence behaviors than we found between DSM self-efficacy and adherence to diet (r = .14, p < .001) and exercise (r = .10, p < .05). These associations remained significant after controlling for age, gender, ethnicity, education, family history, and time since diagnosis. Medication adherence was weakly correlated with SE in DSM (r = .09, p = .02) but not medication-specific SE (r = .25, p = .08). No associations were found between general or specific SE measures and SMBG (ps > .05). Further evidence is needed to confirm our results in a research setting. Our findings suggest that promoting patients\u2019 confidence in managing their diabetes, especially with respect to making changes in diet and exercise could improve patient adherence to their recommended diabetes self-management regimen.",

The role of primary care has also changed in relation to psychiatry in that it now constitutes the first-order treatment for psychiatric disorders. A bio-psychosocial perspective, increased knowledge of behavioural medicine and improved inter-professional collaboration all offer a viable response to this situation. Inter-professional courses at the advanced undergraduate level provide opportunities for inter-professional learning, a learning about, and with one another. At Karolinska Institutet, a cross-program elective course in applied behavioural medicine has been offered since the fall of 2006, first for medical and psychology students, and since 2008 also for physiotherapy students. This presentation describes the course structure and presents evaluation results from the five-week inter-professional course between 2006 and 2009.",

Major parenting behavior produces results similar to or lower in quality than those acquired from ordinary families; however, according to the analysis of scale, disadvantaged boys and girls face more conflicts and difficulties in mental condition. Even though parenting affects the mental health of young kids, it seems that other factors must be considered.

A case control study with matched age, sex and education, based on a two group pre- and post-test design was adopted. Participants of the experimental group were 9 CHD patients (mean age = 56.33 \u00b1 10.45, male 67%) who attended a weekly two-and-a-half hour session and did homework for two months. The intervention foci included psycho-education, biofeedback-assistant relaxation training, and cognitive-behavior strategies to reduce the levels of hostility affect, hostility cognition, and hostility behavior. Participants of the control group were 13 CHD patients (mean age = 59.23 \u00b1 6.80, male 69%) who did not receive any psychological treatment until they finished the three-month waiting status. After intervention, participants showed a significant reduction in hostility level (t = 4.27, p < .01) and respiration rate (t = 3.06, p < .01), and a significant increase in prothrombin time (t = \u22124.75, p < .001). The results of the repeated measure of ANOVA indicated that the experimental group revealed a significantly higher reduction of respiration rate (F = 8.76, p < .01), and a marginally higher increase of prothrombin time (F = \u22123.66, p = .06) than the waiting control group. In conclusion, the results of this study imply that psychological intervention is efficient to reduce the biological risk of disease recurrence for CHD patients.",

One such treatment option is qigong. Several reviews have claimed that qigong has therapeutic effects on blood pressure in patients with hypertension. However, these reviews are non-systematic and therefore open to bias. To systematically assess the clinical evidence of qigong for hypertension. Databases were searched up to December 2009. All randomised clinical trials testing qigong in patients with hypertension of any origin and assessing clinically relevant outcomes were considered. Trials using any type of control intervention were included. The selection of studies, data extraction and quality assessment were performed independently by at least two reviewers. Methodological quality was evaluated using the Jadad score. 12 RCTs could be included. Seven of these RCTs tested qigong in combination with antihypertensive drugs compared with antihypertensive drugs alone. The meta-analysis of four trials reporting adequate data suggested beneficial effects in favour of qigong (weighted mean difference, systolic blood pressure (mmHg) -12.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) -17.12 to -7.00; diastolic blood pressure -8.46, 95% CI -12.55 to -4.37). Qigong alone was compared with waiting list control in 2 RCTs and was found to significantly reduce systolic blood pressure (weighted mean difference (mmHg) -18.46, 95% CI -23.07 to -13.86). In further three RCTs comparisons made were: qigong combined with antihypertensive drugs versus muscle relaxation combined with antihypertensive drugs; qigong as a sole treatment versus exercise and/or antihypertensive drugs, all reported positive results in at least some of the relevant outcome measures. The methodological quality of the original studies was low. There is some encouraging evidence to suggest that qigong is effective for lowering systolic blood pressure. However, the conclusiveness of these findings is limited. Rigorously designed trials seem warranted to confirm these results.",

In Latin American, CHF is one of the main causes of cardiovascular mortality. In Colombia, it is the third leading cause of cardiovascular death. Cardiac rehabilitation programs aimed at individuals with CHF are designed to decrease morbidity and mortality and improve quality of life (QOL). Little data is available on the impact of cardiac rehabilitation programs on QOL in CHF patients in Colombia. The SF-36, a self-report instrument validated in Spanish with 8 sub-scales and a question regarding Health Expectations, was used to measure QOL in 35 CHF patients participating in a cardiac rehabilitation program at St. Vincent de Paul Hospital in Medell\u00edn, Colombia at baseline, 3-month, and 6-month follow-ups. The rehabilitation program consisted of 12-session treatment protocol including exercise, occupational therapy, and psycho-education. One-way repeated measures ANOVAs were conducted for each QOL sub-scale. Results indicated that CHF patients participating in cardiac rehabilitation significantly improved their Physical Performance sub-scale scores and Health Expectations score over time (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01 respectively). Cardiac rehabilitation CHF patients also tended to have improved General Health sub-scale scores and Physical Functioning sub-scale scores over time (p = 0.05 and p = 0.09 respectively). Scores on the remaining SF-36 sub-scales (Pain, Emotional Performance, Social Functioning, Mental Health, and Vitality) did not vary over time (p = NS). A cardiac rehabilitation directed at CHF patients appears to improve specific physical health-related domains of QOL, although future research involving a control group would strengthen these Results: The findings suggest the need for psychologists, nurses, and other health professionals to integrate psychosocial aspects into existing cardiac rehabilitation program in order to potentially improve other domains of QOL in Colombian patients with CHF.",

A half-BPD provides no drug but only placebo. Methods: Sixty-four healthy subjects (32:32 males:females, 24 years) balanced for smokers and never-smokers were made to believe that a chewing gum they received may or may not contain 4 mg nicotine to improve vigilance and reaction time, while in fact all received placebo. The experimenter conducting the study was also made to believe this was a fully BPD to maintain double-blindness. Immediately prior to neurocognitive function testing (N-back tasks with three levels of difficulties and two consecutive runs) they were informed that they belong to the nicotine group or to the placebo group. Dependent measures were reaction time (RT, ms) and number of false go (GO) and no-go (NGO) responses. Results: A significant (p = .028) interaction of all five factors (within: level of difficulty, runs; between: information, smoking status, gender) and age as covariate was found indicating that the information to receive nicotine shortened RT in male, but not in female smokers, while in non-smokers, the information prolonged RT, specifically in males. The placebo information produced no differences in RT in smokers/nonsmokers and in males/females. The differential effects on RT were more pronounced with a high cognitive demand, and during the second run. No effect of any of the factors was found for the number of GO and NGO errors. Conclusion: The known effects of nicotine on RT can be mimicked by the belief to receive nicotine, but males are more prone then females to respond to such information. Never-smokers, in contrast experience opposite effects. These effects may be regarded as conditioned responses. (Supported by a grant from Volkwagen Foundation, Germany)",

Tobacco dependence has also dramatically impacted Asian countries and subsequently Asian Americans who migrated to the United States. Korean male immigrants in the US have been known for the highest smoking prevalence and highest smoking-attributable cancer death fractions. The study is designed to test the applicability of Theory of Planned Behavior to Korean Americans\u2019 smoking cessation. Its main hypothesis is that perceived risks and benefits of quitting, social norms for quitting, self-efficacy in smoking cessation, and nicotine dependence will predict behavioral intentions to quit smoking among Korean American smokers. A nationwide sample of Korean American smokers is currently recruited into this one-time telephone survey. Subjects are randomly selected from the online website InfoSpace.com by their Korean surname such as \u201cKim\u201d, \u201cLee\u201d, \u201cChoi\u201d, etc. The sample size of each city was weighted by the Korean population in the 2000 U.S. Census data. Three cities such as Duluth, GA that lately have the large influx of Korean Americans were added to the list of cities. Preliminary findings with 181 subjects (150 males and 31 females) revealed that gender moderates the relationships between perceived risks of quitting and behavioral intentions to quit smoking in Korean American smokers. Perceived family social norm for quitting was the only significant factor associated with Korean male smokers\u2019 behavioral intentions to quit smoking, whereas, perceived risks of quitting, and perceived family and friend social norms for quitting were the factors associated with Korean female smokers\u2019 behavioral intentions to quit smoking. However, perceived risks of quitting showed the strongest relationship. Data collection will be continued till May 31, 2010 and final results will be presented.",

Method: The integration of Sufficiency Economy(SE), Innovative Care for Chronic Conditions(ICCC) and Community-Based Participation Research(CPBR) was employed to five communities of Pamok district, Angthong province. Five stake-holders(diabetes patients, diabetes risk group, health care volunteers, health officers, and local administrators) were invited to participate in this study. The process in each community consisted of focus group discussion using Appreciation Influence Control(AIC), semi-formal interview, and informal interview. Results: The similarity of diabetes problem situations in each stake-holder were; less knowledge or no awareness on diabetes, unhealthy food consumption, lack of exercise, and non-adherence treatment. The likeness vision of diabetes in each community were; self care management, empowerment health volunteer, health promotion activities exercise, local wisdom of herb and alternative medicine, and integrate all stake-holder together. After discussing and priority setting of the health promotion project for diabetes and risk group under concepts of SE, ICCC, and CBPR, five different health promotion projects were initiated. Conclusion: Community-based participation research was an apparatus to build relationship and trust among the stake-holders and researchers which were the preliminary keys to raise awareness, responsibility, and empowerment to develop health promotion behaviors to reduce complication and prevention diabetes in the community.",

            "text": "School-based drug abuse prevention programs for adolescents are an efficient way to deliver prevention services to young people before they become regular substance users or abusers. Contemporary prevention programs focus on social refusal skills training along with training in more generic \"life skills\" using cognitive, behavioral, and affective skills training techniques. This type of programming teaches principles of cognitive reframing, behavioral self-control, coping, and relaxation skills, along with how to apply these skills outside of the classroom in high risk situations. This presentation will review the concepts and empirical findings from the \"Life Skills Training\" prevention program, including short and long-term effects on related risk behaviors. Life Skills Training (LST) is a theoretically-driven evidence-based drug abuse prevention program for middle school students that emphasizes social resistance skills as well as more generic skills such as communication, assertiveness, decision-making, goal-setting, self-control, and coping skills. Over 30 peer-reviewed articles with analyses of 18 separate cohorts of students have demonstrated that the LST program is effective with a variety of populations, producing behavioral effects on alcohol, tobacco, illicit drug use, as well as aggression and delinquency. Because LST targets etiologic factors common to both drug abuse and HIV risk and teaches skills that have a broad application, we examined the extent to which the intervention may reduce later HIV risk behavior. This presentation reviews findings demonstrating that the intervention reduced drug use and HIV risk behaviors in a sample of 2,042 predominantly white, suburban young adults who had received the preventive intervention in junior high school. Additional findings from a sample of 2,122 predominantly minority young adults will be presented demonstrating that several key skills measures (e.g., cognitive and behavioral self-control skills) that are targeted by the intervention predict various forms of substance use and HIV risk behavior in a similar fashion. These findings are presented in order to frame a discussion on the opportunities for developing competence-enhancement prevention programs to address both substance use and HIV risk behaviors, along with the challenges associated with addressing multiple risk behaviors in a single intervention. One goal of the presentation is to suggest that broad-based competence enhancement prevention programs may be an efficient and effective way to prevent a variety of negative outcomes during adolescence.",

Research we recently conducted revealed that two factors may be predictive for the duration to full return to work (RTW). These factors are early partial RTW and work related self-efficacy. This conclusion is based on three individual focused intervention studies that have been conducted in recent years. The first study was a randomized controlled study with two experimental interventions and one no treatment condition. One hundred self-employed were randomly assigned to one of the conditions. Psychological complaints, professional efficacy and other variables were assessed before, after 4 months and after 10 months. Partial and full RTW was assessed continuously. The second study was a cluster randomized comparative intervention study with an experimental condition and a care as usual condition. One hundred sixty eight employees absent form work due to psychological complaints enrolled in the study. Psychological complaints, work related self-efficacy and other variables were assessed at three times, before, after 6 months and after 12 months. Partial and full RTW were assessed continuously. The third study was a longitudinal cohort study with 177 employees absent form work due to psychological complaints. Partial and full RTW were assessed continuously. Further, psychological complaints, work related self-efficacy and other variables were assessed at a three months time interval during one year.",

We examine evidence for ethnic disparities in children\u2019s height at 3 and 5 years. Data are from the UK Millennium Cohort Study, constructed to over-represent children from ethnic minority, giving us reasonable sample sizes for Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Black African and Black Caribbean groups. Mean birth weight of ethnic minority children was significantly lower than that of the ethnic majority (range 3.06 - 3.34 kg versus 3.41 kg). By contrast, ethnic minority children were taller than the White majority at ages 3 and 5, significantly so in the case of Pakistani, Black Caribbean and Black African children (by 0.5 cm, 1.4 cm. and 3.5 cm at 5 years). Controlling for parental height to take account of intergenerational effects did not affect height differentials. Two mechanisms were hypothesised: (a) a poorer intrauterine environment given the short stature of some minority children\u2019s mothers resulted in catch-up postnatal growth and (b) conditions during the parents\u2019 childhood led to a reduced capacity to reach their own height potential. A reparameterization of parent heights showed that mother\u2019s height contributed more to predicting child height than mean parental height. Adding birth weight to the model showed that height was positively related to birth weight and attenuated the extra contribution from mothers\u2019 heights to non significance. The interaction of mean parental height with ethnicity was significant in models at age 3 and age 5. For all ethnic minority groups, mean parental height was more weakly related to child height than in White majority families, although only significantly different in the largest Pakistani group. In conclusion, we found evidence of catch-up growth in ethnic minority children and that ethnic minority parents had not reached their height potential. There was no suggestion that the lower birth weight of ethnic minority children has adverse consequences for their growth in the pre-school years.",

Yet little work has occurred on the relationships among built environment features and active transport and other physical activity (PA) forms among older adults. 709 adults ages 66 yrs and above living in Seattle or Baltimore regions were recruited from GIS-enumerated neighborhoods identified as high or low affluent and high or low \u2018walkable\u2019 based on land use mix, street connectivity, and other features. Variables included reported active transport (walking/bicycling for errands), general PA (via accelerometry and self-report), and reported BMI and mobility impairments. Persons in less affluent neighborhoods reported generally less PA and higher BMI. After controlling for individual and neighborhood-level sociodemographic and regional factors, walkability was positively associated with active transport (p < .0001), total PA (p = .036), leisure walking/cycling/jogging (p < .008), accelerometry-derived minutes/day of moderate or vigorous PA (p = .056), and lower BMI (p = .02). A significant walkability-mobility impairment interaction was observed for active transport only; as mobility increased, differences in minutes/week of active transport among those living in low vs. high walkable neighborhoods increased (p = .001). Persons in the lowest mobility tertile living in high walkable neighborhoods had active transport levels comparable to persons in the two higher mobility tertiles but living in less walkable neighborhoods (means = 35 mins/wk vs. 27 mins/wk, respectively, p > .13). Results suggest the potential importance of environmental features in facilitating active transport and other healthful patterns among older adults across mobility levels, with potential benefits related to both health and independence as people age.",

These changes require adaptation and are often a source of stress. The current study assessed the stress experienced due to globalization. Undergraduate participants from St. Xavier\u2019s College in Mumbai, India (N = 56; Mean Age = 19 years; 3 Men; 50% Christian & 28% Hindu) reported on the impact of globalization on their lives and on the culture and the society where they lived. Two independent raters identified common themes and three additional independent raters reviewed the themes for overlapping content and modified the themes listed until they had consensus among them on 32 themes that described the experience of globalization. The Impact of Globalization Scale (IGS) was created with each theme identified as an item. Respondents (N = 542; Females = 437; Mean Age = 19 years; 47.4% Christian & 36.3% Hindu) from the same institute stated the frequency with which each of the themes identified were a source of stress to them on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from \u201calmost never\u201d to \u201calmost always\u201d. Exploratory factor analysis with promax rotation identified the presence of 4 factors. Based on an examination of item content the factors were named: Egalitarian Values, which described a healthy challenge to traditional norms/roles (Eigenvalue(e) = 16.21; % Variance Accounted For (%) = 50.66; Internal Reliability Alpha (A) = .97); Unhealthy Habits or an increase in alcohol/smoking, etc (e = 2.53; % =7.90; r = .83); Challenging Traditions or declining traditional value (e = 1.18; % =3.69; A = .76); and Growth of Competitiveness & Materialism (e = 1.07; % = 3.33; A = .36). Correlations of these factors with measures of anger, anxiety, rumination, symptom report (SR), and stress revealed that Egalitarian values was positively associated with SR (r = .12, p < .008); Unhealthy habits correlated with SR (r = .17, p < .001), anger (r = .11, p < .05), rumination (r = .11, p < .01); Challenging Traditions correlated with SR (r = .16, p < .001), anger (r = .10, p < .03), rumination (r = .13, p < .003); Competitiveness correlated with SR (r = .14, p < .003), stress (r = .10, p < .02), anxiety (r = .10, p < .02), rumination (r = .10, p < .03). Conclusion: Clearly, globalization has a positive and negative impact on rapidly changing social systems and structures and is experienced as stressful and anger/anxiety provoking.",

The aim of this study was to examine the association of mental state, functional status, Buddhist values and Buddhist practices, respectively, with emotional distress among Thai patients after having a stroke. Methods: We surveyed 190 stroke survivors who participated in a home health care physical therapy service. Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Barthel index (BI) were used to assess mental state and functional status, respectively. The stroke survivors completed a questionnaire measuring Buddhist values, Buddhist practices, and Thai Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Results: We found HADS scores were related to MMSE (r = \u2212.27, p = .000), BI (r = \u2212.32, p = .000), Buddhist values (r = \u2212.16, p = .030), and Buddhist practices (r = \u2212.25, p = .001). In a hierarchical regression analysis, Buddhist practices were significantly associated with HADS scores when controlling for MMSE and BI (R\n2 change = .04, F (2,182) = 4.36, p = .014). No relationship was found between Buddhist values and HADS scores in this hierarchical regression model. Conclusion: In Thai stroke survivors, Buddhist practices seem to improve emotional status. Therefore, stroke rehabilitation programs should include religious practices.",

Is presented in three different lengths for assessing psychosocial factors at work, stress, and the well-being of employees and some personality factors. The purpose of the COPSOQ concept is to improve and facilitate research, as well as practical interventions at workplaces.",

Individuals with chronic diseases have poorer-quality of life (QOL), however, little is known about the QOL of Colombians with CHD or QOL evolution over time. The SF-36, a self-report instrument validated in Spanish with 8 sub-scales, was used to measure QOL in 19 CHD patients from the Cl\u00ednica Cardiovascular in Medell\u00edn, Colombia and 33 controls at baseline and 6-month follow-up. The CHD Patients were significantly older than the Controls (61.9 yrs vs 55.0 yrs, p < 0.05) and more likely to be male (84% vs 18%, p < 0.001). Individual 2 (group: patient vs control) x 2 (time: baseline vs 6 months) ANCOVAs were conducted for each QOL sub-scale, controlling for age and gender. Results indicated a main effect for group on 4 sub-scales, such that, compared to Controls, CHD Patients had significantly lower Physical Role Limitation (p < 0.001), Vitality (p < 0.05), Mental Health (p < 0.01), and Pain (p < 0.001) scores across both time points. For the Physical Functioning and Emotional Role Limitations sub-scales, there was a main effect for group (p < 0.001; p < 0.01) and a group X time interaction (p < 0.01; p < 0.05) such that CHD Patients had lower scores than Controls, but significantly increased their scores from baseline to follow-up, while the Controls stayed the same. For the Social Functioning and General Health sub-scales, there were marginally significant differences for group such that CHD Patients tended to have lower scores than Controls across both time points. CHD patients in Medell\u00edn report having poorer QOL across all SF-36 domains, improving in 2 areas. These findings suggest the need for psychologists, nurses, and other health professionals to develop and implement culturally-appropriate interventions to improve QOL in Colombian patients with CHD.",

Preliminary research suggests that misconceptions about HF and its treatment may underlie difficulties in self-management. However HF patients are an understudied population and little is known about their illness and treatment beliefs. Guided by the Common-Sense Model, we examined the illness and treatment representations of HF patients, and their relationships with adherence. HF patients (N = 79) completed a questionnaire assessing illness beliefs (IPQ-R), treatment beliefs (TRI), and adherence to medications and lifestyle behaviours. Descriptive analyses showed general uncertainty or low awareness of HF as a chronic (versus acute or cyclic) condition and uncertainty or doubts regarding potential for control. There was significant misidentification of symptoms, with only 60% of participants correctly identifying 5 or more of the key symptoms (breathlessness, weight change, fatigue, wheeziness, sleep difficulties, loss of strength, swelling). Regression analyses, controlling for demographic factors, identified several illness and treatment beliefs as predictors of adherence. Stronger beliefs in a chronic timeline predicted greater dietary adherence (t = 3.31, p = .001). Greater adherence to lifestyle changes was predicted by lower levels of cyclical timeline beliefs (t = \u22123.74, p = .000). Higher beliefs in the treatment\u2019s value predicted better medication adherence (t = \u22122.72, p = .008). Illness and treatment beliefs may play an important role in promoting treatment adherence and healthy lifestyle practices in individuals with HF. Many HF patients appear to lack a comprehensive understanding of their condition and its treatment, resulting in vague representations and potentially contributing to poor treatment adherence. Improving understanding of HF may strengthen representations, leading to improvements in adherence.",

In a prospective study, 155 individuals with whiplash were assessed at <1 month, 3, 6 and 12 months post injury. Outcomes at each time point were: Neck Disability Index (NDI) and the Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale (PDS). Group based trajectory analytical techniques were used to identify outcome profiles. The analyses were then repeated after including third party compensation claim lodgment as a binary time-changing covariate. Three distinct NDI trajectories were determined: 1) Mild: mild or negligible pain/disability for the entire 12 months (45%), 2) Moderate: initial moderate pain/disability that decreased to mild levels by 3 months (39%) and 3) Chronic-severe: severe pain/disability persisting at moderate/severe levels for 12 months (16%). Three distinct PTSD trajectories were also identified: 1) Resilient: mild symptoms throughout (40%), 2) Recovering: initial moderate symptoms declining to mild levels by 3 months (43%) and 3) Chronic moderate-severe: persistent moderate/severe symptoms throughout 12 months (17%). Claim submission had a detrimental effect on all trajectories (P < 0.001) except for the Chronic-severe NDI trajectory (P = 0.098). Following whiplash injury, there are distinct pathways of recovery for pain/ disability and PTSD symptoms. Management of whiplash should consider the detrimental effect of compensation claim on psychological recovery and those with mild to moderate pain/disability levels. However claim lodgement has no significant influence on those following a more severe pain and disability trajectory.",

In Colombia, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality; Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) are top causes of disability. Individuals with chronic diseases have poorer quality of life (QOL), however, little is known about the differences in QOL of Colombians with Coronary Heart Disease (CHD), TBI, and SCI. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was used to measure depression and the SF-36 and the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) was used to measure QOL in 116 CHD patients from the Cl\u00ednica Cardiovascular in Medell\u00edn, 30 individuals with TBI living in Barranquilla, 40 individuals with SCI living in Neiva, and 168 controls from the three cities. All analyses controlled for age, gender, and education. Individuals with TBI had sig higher PHQ-9 scores than the other 3 groups (p < 0.05). Compared to Controls, individuals with SCI had sig higher, and those with CHD tended to have higher, PHQ-9 scores (p < 0.05; p = 0.06). Individuals with SCI had sig lower SWLS scores than the other groups (p < 0.001). Compared to Controls, individuals with CHD had sig lower SF-36 sub-scale scores across all 8 domains (p < 0.01), those with TBI had sig lower scores in all domains except vitality (p = NS), and those with SCI in all except vitality (p = NS) and emotional well-being (p = NS). Individuals with SCI had sig lower general health (p < 0.01) and physical functioning (p < 0.001) scores than the other 3 groups. Those with CHD had sig lower physical functioning scores than those with TBI (p < 0.001) and those with TBI had sig lower emotional role limitation scores than those with SCI (p < 0.05). Colombians with TBI are more depressed than Controls and those with SCI or CHD, but those with SCI have the lowest satisfaction with life. Individuals with chronic diseases, especially CHD, have lower QOL than Controls, yet those with SCI appear most affected among those with chronic disease. Further investigation into specific determinants of QOL for Colombians with chronic diseases is warranted.",

More than hostility (a known psychological risk indicator for heart disease), rebelliousness might be strongly related to health and heart disease via rebellious persons opposing and obstructing health campaigns aimed at modifying unhealthy behaviours. We set out to examine, firstly, the psychometric properties of a rebelliousness questionnaire and, secondly, the extent to which rebelliousness and hostility compete in the prediction of incident heart disease and in the contribution to socioeconomic differences in health. Using Dutch data on older men and women (n = 4,485), we found moderate reliability (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 ranging between 0.50 and 0.60) and moderate (construct) validity, as indicated by rebelliousness being (moderately) associated with low control beliefs, hostility, and unhealthy behaviours. Using longitudinal data (n > 2,000), we will further report on the extent to which rebelliousness is more common (than hostility) in lower socioeconomic status groups, the extent to which rebelliousness is more common (than hostility) in the etiology of heart disease, and the extent to which rebelliousness more strongly (than hostility) affects heart disease through poor health behaviours. The findings add to the body of evidence on the psychological pathways involved in how socioeconomic structure gets under the skin.",

Even sixty years after the WW II, this cohort is significantly more often affected by posttraumatic symptomatology compared to the younger cohorts (Maercker et al., 2008). The present study is addressing prevalence rates of posttraumatic symptomatology and it\u2019s comorbidity with depression and somatization. Methods: The study examines PTSD according to DSM-IV, partial PTSD, depression and somatisation in a randomly selected sample of the German general population aged 60 to 85 years (N = 1.659) using self rating instruments (PHQ, PDS). Results: One-month prevalence rates were 2.8% for DSM-IV PTSD, another 11.9% fulfilled the criteria of partial PTSD. This points out, that sub threshold symptomatology plays a major role in the elderly. 11.5% of the persons affected by PTSD symptomatology fulfil the criteria of a somatoform syndrome, 8.5% fulfil the criteria of Major Depression and 10.4% fulfil the criteria of other depressive syndromes according the Patient Health Questionnaire. 5.6% report both - depression and somatoform disorder. Discussion: Even sixty years after WW II, posttraumatic symptomatology is more common in the elderly in Germany compared to the younger cohorts. It is often accompanied by other comorbid mental disorders like depression or somatisation. Implications of these findings for health and health care in the elderly will be discussed.",

Worsening glucose metabolism appears to contribute to patient\u2019s level of distress and may be an important factor in explaining future prognosis. We examined associations between psychological distress, glucose metabolism and death in adults with and without diabetes. In a representative, prospective study of 18,525 adults (4.1% with physician-diagnosed diabetes) we measured levels of psychological distress using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) and blood was collected for the assessment of glycated haemoglobin, a marker of glucose metabolism. The main outcome was all cause death. Psychological distress, that was defined as GHQ-12 score of \u22654, was apparent in 19.5% and 13.9% of participants with and without diabetes, respectively. Distress was associated with greater cardiovascular morbidity although not with impaired glucose metabolism in diabetics. Among diabetics there were 187 deaths over an average of 6.0 years of follow up. Distress was associated with higher risk of death (multivariate adjusted hazard ratio = 1.95, 95% CI, 1.34 - 2.84) after adjustment for glucose control, health behaviours, and cardiovascular co-morbidity. The synergistic coexistence of diabetes and distress was associated with an elevated risk of all cause death, beyond that due to having either diabetes or distress alone. In summary, psychological distress is an independent risk factor for death in diabetic patients, but this association was not explained through impaired glucose metabolism. Early screening for distress may have important implications for prevention and treatment in diabetics.",

Men often blamed themselves for their obesity. They believed that their obesity was primarily caused by a lack of activity rather than their eating behaviours. Most strongly believed that it was their personal responsibility to lose weight and felt confident that they could achieve weight loss without the support of family members or health professionals. However, they wanted to be engaged in strategies that focused on improving their health and fitness, rather than weight loss. They felt that this was a more empowering approach and the most effective way to lose weight and keep it off.

A major challenge to efforts to characterize peer support is, in turn, the extent to which it is culturally contingent, that is, how characteristics of support are dependent on differing cultural, social, and organizational standards, norms or values. What is a sensitive offer of help in one culture may be intrusive in another or too reserved and thereby indicative of disinterest in a third. Additionally, varying attitudes toward health, fate, life and death as well as cultural contingencies surrounding key health behaviors such as diet add complexity to efforts to promote peer support across different countries. To address these challenges, Peers for Progress, a global program to promote peer support in health care, has followed a strategy of \u201cstandardization by function, not content.\u201d This identifies key functions of peer support across cultures and settings which, at the same time, allow for considerable flexibility in content of local implementation. Peers for Progress and its grantees have identified as key functions of peer support 1) assistance in daily management, 2) social and emotional support, 3) linkage to clinical care, and 4) ongoing availability of support. This symposium will explore how this approach has been realized in peer support programs in Australia, China, Thailand and Uganda. From Australia, Dr. Oldenburg will describe extension of support groups that Diabetes Australia-Victoria has established for over a decade to improve daily management, social and emotional support, and linkage to clinical care. From Hong Kong, Dr. Chan will describe \u201cPearl,\u201d a program that integrates peer support within \u201cJade,\u201d a program to promote algorithm based, systematic clinical care for diabetes in primary care. From Uganda, Dr. Baumann will describe challenges faced and successes of a peer support program in small, severely under-resourced villages. Finally, Dr. Boothroyd will describe how these and the other eleven project of Peers for Progress have increased understanding of important features of the four key functions of peer support, identified important aspects of implementation, and addressed programmatic, cultural and organizational challenges. Across all of these, identification of common functions guides program development that reflects generalized knowledge while allowing for tailoring to the strengths and characteristics of populations, cultures, and settings.",

They aim to convey expert information about diabetes and to provide social support to members. Building on this experience over many years, the Australasian Peers for Progress Diabetes Program (PfP-DP) aims to implement and evaluate a peer-led group program to improve daily management, social and emotional support, and linkage to clinical care for people with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Participants will be recruited from the membership of (1) the National Diabetes Services Scheme, an Australian government initiative for people with diabetes to obtain subsidized consumables, and (2) DA-Vic membership of people with T2DM. The intervention trial involves 12 groups of 8-12 people led by lay peer leader(s), who are receiving training in group facilitation, communication, goal setting and motivational skills. Groups will meet monthly for 12 months, during which time group participants will review difficulties with their diabetes care, successes and achievements. The control (waitlist) arm comprises 12 \u201cvirtual\u201d groups of similar composition who do not meet and receive their usual care until after the first 12 months. All study participants, and peer leaders, receive 1-day of basic diabetes self-management education prior to intervention groups commencing. Primary outcome is based on cardiovascular risk score (using the UKPDS equations) at baseline, 12 and 18 month follow up. Secondary outcomes include self-care behaviors, psychosocial functioning and quality of life. The program will also undergo an economic evaluation. The program partnership with an NGO and program delivery by volunteer, lay peer leaders trained to support behavior change in people with T2DM could enhance program transfer to other countries within the Asia Pacific region, where lay workers and community health workers are already integral to delivery of health services.",

Using a pre- post-intervention design, data were collected on A1C, perceptions of social support, coping, and diabetes self-care behaviors. Outcomes were improved daily self-care behaviors, social and emotional support, A1C values, and linkages with healthcare providers. Peer Champions (n = 19) were patients who attended the Mityana diabetes clinic, could speak and read English, and agreed to contact another patient with diabetes (Partner) at least weekly. Champions received education in diabetes self-care and in providing supportive communication to peer Partners. Peer Partners (n = 27) were patients with diabetes who attended the Mityana Clinic. Champions and Partners met at a community meeting where diabetes self-care education was again provided, and participants were assigned to pairs or triads. Telephones provided were linked to a pre-paid network so that calls were free if they were to another peer or champion, or to a healthcare provider. Participants who completed the intervention (28 females, 13 males) had a mean age of 55 years (range = 32 to 74) and a mean duration of diabetes of 6.5 years. A post-intervention meeting was held with 16 Champions and 25 Partners to complete measurements and share experiences. Sixty-six percent of participants reported peer contact at least weekly. There was no change in scores on a 5-item diabetes coping scale, a 14-item barriers scale, physical activity or missing medications. Perceptions of social support from family and friends and a single item rating on \u201cconfidence in managing diabetes\u201d significantly decreased (p = .03, and p = .02 respectively). There was improvement in eating behaviors (p < .001) and 77.8% reported that they contacted the clinic and healthcare providers more often than prior to the intervention. The most striking finding was a reduction (p < .05) in mean A1C from 9.8% to 6.8% (by IFCC standards). Eighty percent of participants indicated that the most helpful aspects of peer support were \u2018advice about taking care of diabetes\u2019 and \u2018encouragement to contact the clinic\u2019. Participants especially liked using pre-paid telephones to contact healthcare providers and peers and receiving written material about diabetes self-care; however, most would have preferred materials in the local language and 92% reported difficulty reading because of poor eyesight. In conclusion, both providers and peers were actively engaged in a program that resulted in improved glycemic control and linkages with healthcare providers; other results may be explained by the resource-poor setting and unique cultural factors.",

Observations from these provide opportunity for identifying ways in which generalizable key functions of peer support (assistance in daily management, social and emotional support, linkage to clinical care, and ongoing support) are represented in programs as well as ways in which programs are tailored to local characteristics or strengths. In particular, the experiences of individual projects have led not to major changes in the four key functions but to a) enhanced understanding of several of them, b) recognition of important implementation considerations, and c) attention to challenges in implementation. Enhanced understanding of the important of the functions has included recognition of the importance of attention to medications and adherence in a disease like diabetes, emotional and social support, and assisting individuals in navigating the health care system. Implementation considerations include recognizing varied modes of delivery (face-to-face, individual, group, telephone, etc.), the needs not just of individuals but of their family and caregivers, and the need of support providers for their own ongoing encouragement and support. In implementation, recognition has also grown regarding the importance of integration of understanding of the role of peer support across members of the health care team so that everyone delivers a solid and common message though they may be using different \u201clanguages.\u201d Challenges have included the widespreaqd and substantial barriers individuals face in transportation, infrastructure (e.g., electricity), and employment, difficulties in negotiating and establishing organizational partnerships, encouraging among peer supporters a stance of \u201cpeerage\u201d rather than teaching, and cultural challenges such as those related to roles of women, roles of patients vis a vis professionals, etc. The four functions of peer support that Peer for Progress has emphasized provide important structure to thinking about peer support across national lines, but, nevertheless, leave much room for attention to the kinds of needs and challenges which successful implementation in individual settings must address.",

They responded to a survey in 2000-2002 and/or 2004 and their self-reported sleep disturbances were linked to comprehensive individual-level health registers to assess depression from several sources, i.e. medically certified work disability, use of antidepressant medication, and psychotherapy for depression. During a mean follow-up of 3.3 years, 273 participants were granted long-term work disability due to depression, 1611 had new antidepressant treatment and 74 had new commencements of psychotherapy for depression. Any sleep disturbance at least 5 nights per week increased the risk of incident depression to 1.6-1.7-fold after extensive adjustments for baseline age, sex, socioeconomic status, night/shift work, health behaviors, somatic diagnoses, pain killers, psychological distress, and anxiety. Risk of work disability due to depression was 2.9 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.9-4.4] in those with difficulties initiating sleep at least 5 nights per week. Too early awakenings and non-refreshing sleep doubled the risk of work disability and difficulties maintaining sleep increased the risk to 1.5 (95% CI 1.1-2.0). Also moderate sleep disturbances (2-4 nights/week) were associated with increased risk. The results were essentially replicated with antidepressant medication use and psychotherapy. In conclusion, Sleep disturbances seem to precede objective depression-related outcomes. Our results emphasize the importance of early detection of sleep disturbances in preventing subsequent depressive disorders.",

Methods: Polysomnographic data were collected at a university-based outpatient clinic for adults and elderly. 19 patients using sleep medications on a daily basis (5-7 days per week) for at least one year were compared with 64 drug-free patients complaining of insomnia and 26 good sleepers. Mean age was 63.8 years (SD = 7.0). Outcome measures were polysomnographic sleep parameters (total sleep time, wake after sleep onset, sleep onset latency, sleep efficiency, slow-wave sleep), and prevalence estimates of sleep apnoea and PLMD. Results: The chronic hypnotic users spent more time awake and had reduced sleep efficiency compared to good sleepers. The amount of slow-wave sleep was significantly lower among chronic hypnotic users compared to the other two groups. There were no differences between the chronic hypnotic users and drug-free patients complaining of insomnia on any of the other PSG-parameters. The prevalence rate of sleep apnoea (AHI > 10) was 42% both among the drug-free patients complaining of insomnia and chronic users of sleep medications, compared to 12% in the good sleepers group. There were no significant group differences in the prevalence of PLMD between the three groups (37%-39%). Conclusions: This study suggests that the sleep of chronic users of sleep medications is no better than that of drug-free patients complaining of insomnia. It is disturbing that 42% of the patients treated pharmacologically for insomnia also suffers from sleep apnoea. We suggest careful sleep assessment as a prerequisite for long-term prescription of sleep medications.",

There are several design strategies that can provide critical comparative effectiveness information, but a balanced portfolio of methodologies will be most informative. In CER research, patients are studied within the context of real-world clinical settings. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) has recently developed national priorities for comparative effectiveness research, and has also established a working definition for CER. The IOM also underscored the importance of identifying infrastructure and resources necessary for sustaining CER research. Importantly, among the national priorities identified, a number of recommendations included behavioral interventions (including but not limited to exercise treatments, social support, family issues in care-giving, dietary interventions, improving the built environment, symptom management, cognitive behavioral therapy, biofeedback, and many others) related to cardiovascular and other diseases and conditions. There are many opportunities for cardiovascular behavioral medicine studies to contribute important information in CER. The purpose of this symposium is to highlight examples of some of the early behavioral medicine studies that have been conducted in CER, for the purpose of encouraging advances.",

To be maximally effective, therefore, efforts to improve population health need to address health risk behaviors. Poor quality diet and sedentary lifestyle are well-established risk factors for cardiovascular disease and cancers. Four unhealthy behaviors are especially prevalent. in industrialized cultures: eating a high-fat diet, consuming few fruits and vegetables, extensive television viewing, and low moderate-vigorous physical activity. Public health guidelines advise correcting all of these unhealthy behaviors, but little guidance is available about the best approach. To address that question, we conducted a head-to-head comparative effectiveness randomized clinical trial(n = 200) of four diet and activity interventions, all of which entailed guideline-recommended behavior change. In each condition, participants modified one diet and one activity behavior, while effects on all four behaviors were evaluated as an aggregated healthy lifestyle score. Results indicated that the conventional intervention practice of increasing physical activity and decreasing fat intake produced the least improvement in overall healthy lifestyle. Conversely, a novel approach suggested by behavioral economic theory (increase fruits/vegetables and decrease recreational screen time) maximized across-the-board healthy lifestyle change. To fulfill its full potential, however, comparative effectiveness research needs to extend beyond determining only what works best for the average patient. In the present study, for example, traditional dieting (decrease fat, increase physical activity) minimized overall healthy lifestyle change for females but maximized it for males, suggesting that gender-tailored guidance might be needed. Comparative effectiveness research holds potential to undergird personalized, evidence-based behavioral medicine. The aim is for intervention decisions to be guided by evidence that conveys what works best for particular types of individuals or communities and in different settings and circumstances.",

However, for most of these treatments there are essential questions that remain to be answered through rigorous scientific study-- whether they work for the diseases or medical conditions for which they are used. Ancient self-care practices such as qigong and tai chi have been used traditionally in the East for complementing chronic disease management. Qigong and tai chi are each forms of traditional Chinese medicine practice that combine breathing, movement and meditation. Decades of behavioral medicine investigations suggest life-style modifications including exercise and relaxation-related activities are beneficial for health.

            "text": "Heart failure (HF) affects millions of individuals and is increasing in prevalence each year as the population ages. Approximately one third of HF patients experience clinical depression symptoms, which are further associated with elevated risk of cardiovascular hospitalization and mortality. However, depression treatments such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) do not decrease morbidity/mortality in patients with coronary heart disease. This is not surprising since recent evidence suggests somatic but not cognitive/affective depressive symptoms have a greater association with cardiovascular-related mortality and events. Somatic symptoms such as fatigue and sleep disturbances are common among HF patients that may lead to physical inactivity and create a spiraling decline in physical and cardiac function. Indeed, physical inactivity is associated with reduced quality of life and greater morbidity and mortality in HF. Meanwhile, Tai Chi practice is observed to increase vigor, and reduce tension, anger and fatigue. Tai Chi emphasizes a holistic approach, both mind and body. It is a meditative exercise originating from China, and with its moderate intensity and relative ease of performance it is well-suited even for those with significant physical impairments. The present study consists of HF patients (n = 29 completers; 43-83 years old; mean age = 72.9, SD = 5.1) that had Tai chi training (n = 19) twice per week for 12 weeks or were in a waitlist control group (n = 10). At baseline and after the 12-week intervention period, patients completed the Beck Depression Index (BDI), subcategorized into somatic (BDI-s) and cognitive (BDI-c) symptoms, and the Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory - Short Form (MFSI-SF). All subjects also were measured pre- and post- intervention period for physical function, in a 6-min walk task. Compared to controls, HF patients in the Tai Chi group had reduced total BDI scores from pre- to post-intervention (F(1, 21) = 4.1, p = .055, r = .40) and BDI-s (F(1, 21) = 8.5, p < .01, r = .55), but not BDI-c (p = .50). Those in the Tai Chi group also had reduced MFSI total fatigue (F(1, 18) = 4.2, p = .054, r = .43) and increased MFSI vigor (F(1, 18) = 5.3, p = .033, r = .48) and greater improvement in distance walked F(1,27) = 6.1, p = .02 in the 6-min walk task compared to controls. These findings suggest that Tai Chi reduces symptoms of depression, due mainly to changes in somatic symptoms, and increases physical function. Larger studies are needed to replicate our findings, to establish Tai Chi as a viable intervention for reducing somatic symptoms of depression and increasing physical function. Future studies should examine whether HF related morbidity and mortality is affected by practicing Tai Chi. NCCAM 1-R21-AT-001910-01A2",

Tai Chi reduces fall-risk and improves balance in older adults and practitioners report that it is relaxing and stress reducing as well. Unfortunately, empirical evidence regarding the effects of Tai Chi on mental health parameters is scarce. This talk will focus on Tai Chi studies conducted at the UCLA Cousins Center for Psychoneuroimmunology as a means of demonstrating some of the avenues through which Tai Chi may promote mental health. We conducted a randomized clinical trial comparing Tai Chi Chih with health education in 112 healthy older adults. We found that in those with difficulties sleeping (indexed by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory scores > 5), Tai Chi led to significant improvements in sleep whereas health education did not (p < .05), including improvements in perceived sleep quality and duration (p\u2019s < .05). We continued to examine sleep with an ongoing trial of Tai Chi Chih in older adults with insomnia, as well as examining stress in a smaller pilot study with isolated older adults. In this presentation, I will discuss three key themes in conducting such clinical trials: 1) understanding the different schools of Tai Chi; 2) choosing the best type of intervention for a control group; and 3) adjusting Tai Chi for working with populations with mental health issues.",

Qigong therapy is becoming a popular adjunctive treatment for type 2 diabetes. Previous studies have suggested benefits of Qigong practice for this disease; however, its effectiveness has never been rigorously evaluated in adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. We conducted a randomized, controlled 3-arm clinical trial in comparing 12-weeks of Qigong, Progressive Resistance Training (PRT), or usual care in 32 adults with type 2 diabetes. Outcome measures included fasting glucose, hemoglobin A1c, insulin, C-peptide, BMI, HOMA-IR, Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Beck\u2019s depression Index (BDI) before, during and at the end of the interventions. We found that body weight increased in the usual care group, but decreased in both Qigong and PRT groups. Additionally, the Qigong group showed significant reductions in fasting glucose (P = 0.003) and PSS (P = 0.045) and also demonstrated trends for improved insulin resistance, as measured by the HOMA-IR Index. In contrast, the PRT group showed a significant reduction in depression scores with an increase in fasting glucose and insulin resistance, which also increased in the usual care group (NS). In this presentation, I will discuss three key themes in conducting comparative efficacy clinical trials: 1) understanding the different schools of Qigong; 2) choosing the best control group for Qigong intervention; and 3) choosing an appropriate patient population with type 2 diabetes for Qigong intervention.

One such treatment option is qigong. Several reviews have claimed that qigong has therapeutic effects on blood pressure in patients with hypertension. However, these reviews are non-systematic and therefore open to bias. To systematically assess the clinical evidence of qigong for hypertension. Databases were searched up to December 2009. All randomized clinical trials testing qigong in patients with hypertension of any origin and assessing clinically relevant outcomes were considered. Trials using any type of control intervention were included. The selection of studies, data extraction and quality assessment were performed independently by at least two reviewers. Methodological quality was evaluated using the Jadad score. 12 RCTs could be included. Seven of these RCTs tested qigong in combination with antihypertensive drugs compared with antihypertensive drugs alone. The meta-analysis of four trials reporting adequate data suggested beneficial effects in favour of qigong (weighted mean difference, systolic blood pressure (mmHg) -12.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) -17.12 to -7.00; diastolic blood pressure -8.46, 95% CI -12.55 to -4.37). Qigong alone was compared with waiting list control in 2 RCTs and was found to significantly reduce systolic blood pressure (weighted mean difference (mmHg) -18.46, 95% CI -23.07 to -13.86). In further three RCTs comparisons made were: qigong combined with antihypertensive drugs versus muscle relaxation combined with antihypertensive drugs; qigong as a sole treatment versus exercise and/or antihypertensive drugs, all reported positive results in at least some of the relevant outcome measures. The methodological quality of the original studies was low. There is some encouraging evidence to suggest that qigong is effective for lowering systolic blood pressure. However, the conclusiveness of these findings is limited. Rigorously designed trials seem warranted to confirm these results.",

METHODS: Individuals diagnosed with colorectal cancer (CRC) in the past 6 months who experienced symptoms prior to diagnosis are recruited to participate in an on-going qualitative research study. Participants are administered a semi-structured, cognitive interview about pre-diagnosis events and complete standardized scales. The interview focuses on: 1) symptom recognition, 2) influence of family and friends, 3) social support, 4) ease of access to care, 5) communication with PHYS, and 6) socio-demographic and psychological factors. Qualitative data is themed and coded. Self-report information is verified via chart review. 50 coded interviews (of 200 conducted to date) were analyzed. RESULTS: Compared to individuals in the first tertile of appraisal delay (n = 20), individuals in the third (n = 17) were more likely to not initially infer serious illness (p < 0.05), decide not to seek medical attention (p < 0.01), and experience behavioral delay in acting on a decision to seek medical attention (p < 0.001) due to procrastination (p < 0.01) or system barriers (p < 0.05). Compared to patients in the first tertile of diagnostic delay (n = 17), patients in the third (n = 17) were more likely to have their PHYS fail to fully explore symptoms or investigate complaints (p < 0.001), have the PHYS believe symptoms were not serious (p < 0.001), and experience referral delay (p < 0.01) and behavioral or scheduling delay with respect to referral appointments (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: In this sample, patients with longer delay did not appraise initial symptoms as important or requiring medical attention. Once deciding to see a PHYS, individual- and system-level factors interfered with making an appointment. Upon seeing a PHYS, patient and PHYS factors contributed to diagnostic delay, including not exploring symptoms or investigating patient complaints and delay in making referral appointments. Further investigation into factors moderating delay are warranted.",

Results confirmed that exposure to the PDS led to a significant decrease in cancer worries (F(1, 80) = 7.14, p = <.01) and an increase in CRC knowledge (F(1, 80) = 30.72, p < .001), salience and coherence (F(1, 80) = 6.32, p = .05), perceived susceptibility (F(1, 80) = 16.05, p = <.001) and response efficacy (F(1, 80) = 22.71, p = <.001). However, perceived usability and acceptability (PUA) mediated this effect for most factors and participants with low PUA showed stability in their attitudes, whereas people with high PUA showed significant change. Computer anxiety was found to be a significant predictor of perceived usability and acceptability (r = \u2212.46, p < .001), supporting the hypothesis that technophobia is an important predictor of the way people perceive the tool, and in turn the degree to which it influences their attitudes towards screening.",

This study examined perceived breast cancer risk and perceived benefits and barriers to mammography in breast cancer survivors (N = 64) and women with no cancer history (N = 70). A key goal of this study was to examine associations between perceived risk and anxiety, depression, and mammography specific distress. In the breast imaging clinic and immediately prior to undergoing mammography, breast cancer survivors rated their perceived risk of breast cancer recurrence (M = 14, SD = 6) and beliefs about mammography. Women with no cancer history rated their perceived risk of developing breast cancer (M = 12, SD = 6). Breast cancer survivors reported higher perceived risk (p = .05) and lower perceived benefits of mammography (p = .01) compared to women with no cancer history. Perceived barriers did not differ across groups. Immediately prior to mammography, women also rated their mammography specific distress, anxiety, and depression. Levels of anxiety and depression did not differ across groups, but breast cancer survivors reported higher mammography specific distress (p < .001). Multiple linear regression analyses showed that anxiety and mammography specific distress were positively associated with perceived risk in breast cancer survivors, but these associations were not found in women with no cancer history [Anxiety: Group x Perceived Risk B = .27, SE = .11, p = .02; Mammography Specific Distress: Group x Perceived Risk B = .62, SE = .21, p = .004]. A similar trend was found for depression [Depression: Group x Perceived Risk B = .15, SE = .08, p = .06]. These findings suggest that breast cancer survivors with high perceived risk are more likely to experience distress during mammography. Strategies to help breast cancer survivors develop more accurate cancer risk perceptions and manage distress during mammography may be beneficial.",

Strategies in dealing with sick-listing would be to initially comply with the patient\u2019s request in order to build alliance and then start to motivate for a return to work. Confrontation when they disagreed strongly on a sick note was another strategy mentioned, but at the same time risking that the patient would leave them for a more cooperative colleague.

As part of the Ministry of Health structure, PHI started its activities in 2003 aiming at providing services to 11.2 million families in the country not covered by traditional social insurance institutions. PHI counts with unprecedent financial public resources to carry out its activities. More than 70,000 workers of 17 categories in 32 states have been hired. Although workers were offered initially a temporary contract with no benefits such as social insurance, annual allowance and vacations, the Ministry of Health (MOH) along with the Ministry of Budgeting and the MOH\u2019s workers union decided to provide benefits defined by Law starting in 2008. So far, half of all workers are contracted under the new conditions. However, 2009 evaluation using a sample of 9 states, showed that initially the performance of workers in terms of productivity and quality of care has not necessarily improved raising questions about the way Human Resources for Health policies should be designed and applied to really generate improvements for the benefit of those populations covered by the program.",

            "text": "Background: Suffering from involuntary infertility and going through In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) treatment is significant stressor and associated with increased risk of depression. Depression has been hypothesized to reduce the chances of a succesful IVF-outcome, and a number of studies have reported associations between depression and IVF-outcome. Other studies, however, have been unable to replicate these findings, and the strength of a possible association between depressive symptoms and pregnancy chances following IVF remains to be clarified. Our aim was therefore to conduct a statistical quantitative review of published articles reporting on the association between depression and IVF-outcome and to estimate the strength of such an association. Methods: Systematic literature searches were conducted in PubMed, PsychInfo and Web of Science, identifying prospective empirical studies reporting data on associations between depression and IVF-outcome, i.e. pregnancy. Results: The forward database searches resulted in 14 accessible independent studies, providing the necessary and unadjusted data for Effect size calculations. A simple vote count showed a significant effect of depression on IVF-outcome in 4 of these studies. Effect size correlations (ESR) were calculated by two independent researchers for each individual study and then combined to estimate an overall effect size for the depression-IVF-outcome association. Due to considerable heterogeneity (Q = 131,10; p < 0.0001), a random effects model was applied. The overall effect size found for the association between depression and IVF-outcome was statistically significant, with a higher number of depressive symptoms being associated with reduced pregnancy chances (ESr = \u22120,06, failsafe N = 114, p < 0.05). Conclusion. A modest influence of depression on IVF-outcome was found. While the Failsafe-number indicates a relatively robust result, further studies are needed to explore possible moderators of the depression - IVF-outcome effect: e.g. female age, IVF inductees or veterans, duration and timing of presence of depressive symptoms.",

Neuroendocrine, immune, inflammatory, and cardiovascular factors have been suggested as possible mediators of the relationship between stress and birth outcomes, and recent data suggest that stress-related changes in cytokine production and inflammation may contribute to these effects. Work in our laboratory has focused on quantifying the effects of perceived stress and social support on pregnancy outcome and the degree to which neural-immune interactions may be involved in these effects. Initial work in the lab focused on establishing connections between maternal prenatal stress and low social support and alterations in cytokine balance in the circulation and cytokine production by stimulated peripheral lymphocytes. This work indicated that indeed, elevated stress and lower social support was related to increases in circulating inflammatory mediators, reduction in anti-inflammatory cytokines, and similar changes in the production of cytokines in vitro by mitogen-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes. Additional studies began to connect these findings to the likelihood of premature delivery and other complications of pregnancy, and have started to demonstrate that indeed, increased stress and distress early in pregnancy is related not only to elevations in inflammatory mediators in the prenatal period, but is also associated with higher frequency of pregnancy and birth complications. Most recently, our work has focused on the role of maternal ethnicity and acculturation in the impact of stress on pregnancy, and on the role of catecholamines in these relationships. Elevated proinflammatory cytokines were lower levels of support and higher stress throughout pregnancy, and higher social support was associated with higher levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines late in pregnancy. Moreover, elevated inflammatory markers were related to higher pregnancy-specific distress early in gestation, as well as lower 1-minute APGAR scores, lower gestational age at birth, and increased occurrence of birth complications including meconium aspiration, nuchal cord, and asphyxia. Together, these studies indicate that psychosocial factors are related to increases in inflammatory mediators and subsequently, increased risk of pregnancy complications and untoward birth outcomes.",

However, little is known about low-income women\u2019s dietary quality during the 1st trimester when placental development is vulnerable to changes in maternal nutrition. The aims of this study were to explore the relationships 1) between maternal psychosocial factors and dietary quality; and 2) between dietary quality and selected placental biomarkers. A descriptive design was used in a clinic sample of low-income women (N = 30). Women were, on average, 24 years old and 8 weeks pregnant. Most were unmarried, uninsured, and Hispanic. Spearman\u2019s rho statistic was used to analyze data due to small sample size and skewed data. Women (N = 30) were, on average, 24 years old and 8 weeks pregnant. 1st Study Aim Social support was related to vegetable intake (r = .37) and intake of iron-rich (r = .478) and folate-rich (r = .50) foods. Emotional eating in response to anxiety was negatively relationship to intake of fruits (r = \u2212.33) and calcium-rich (r = \u2212.33). Depressed women had less social support (r = \u2212.43), more emotional eating (r = .38), and decreased intake of foods rich in calcium (r = \u2212.38), iron (r = \u2212.60), and folate (r = \u2212.49) 2nd Study Aim Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor was positively related to fruit intake (r =  .40) and Placental Growth Factor was negatively related to the intake of iron (r = \u2212.43) and zinc (-.38). partner support partner was related positively to vegetable intake and negatively to intake of iron and grains. Although results should be interpreted with caution, the findings suggest that low-income pregnant women who are depressed or engage in emotional eating are likely to have inadequate intake of nutrients that contribute to positive pregnancy outcomes. Placental development in the early weeks of pregnancy may be influenced by maternal dietary intake. More research is needed to explore the relationships among psychosocial status, dietary intake and placental development in the first trimester of pregnancy.",

Thus, we examined whether alcohol use mediates the relationship between forced sexual intercourse (FSI) and suicidality in adolescent girls. Methods: We analyzed data from the 2007 Youth Risk Behavior Survey, a nationally representative survey of US students conducted by CDC. Responses from Hispanic (H) (n = 1915), Caucasian (W) (n = 2928), and African American (AA) (n = 1521) females in grades 9 - 12 were examined. FSI history was assessed by asking the following yes/no question: \u201cHave you ever been physically forced to have sexual intercourse when you did not want to?\u201d The outcome variable, suicidality, was measured by a single yes/no item: \u201cDuring the past 12 months, did you ever seriously consider attempting suicide?\u201d Alcohol use, was assessed by asking, \u201cDuring the past 30 days, on how many days did you have 1 or more drinks of alcohol?\u201d Responses were dichotomized as \u201cyes/no\u201d to having one or more drinks of alcohol on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. Results: The mean age of girls in the overall sample (N = 6364) was 16 (SD = 1.22) with a mean grade of 11th. Overall, 11% of participants reported a lifetime history of FSI. AA girls (14.2%) were more likely than W (10.5%) or H (11.3%) girls to report a lifetime history of FSI (\u03c72 (2) = 13.33, p < .01). Nineteen percent of participants considered suicide in the past year, with H (21.5%) more likely than AA (18.2%) and W (18.2%) participants to report this behavior (\u03c72 (2) = 9.18, p < .05). Additionally, 45% of participants acknowledged alcohol use, with W (47.4%) and H (49.4%) girls more likely than AA girls (34.6%) to report alcohol use (\u03c72 (2) = 78.08, p < .001). FSI was associated with suicidality (\u03b2 = 1.26, SE = .08, OR: 3.53, 95% CI: 3.00-4.16, p < .001) and alcohol use (\u03b2 = .69, SE = .08, OR: 2.00, CI: 1.70-2.36, p < .001) for the total sample. Alcohol use was associated with suicidality after controlling for FSI (\u03b2 = .80, SE = .07, OR: 2.22, CI: 1.93-2.55, p < .001). The path from FSI to suicidality was reduced when accounting for alcohol use (\u03b2 = 1.17, SE = .09, OR: 3.22, CI: 2.70-3.83, p < .001), suggesting that alcohol use partially mediated the relationship between FSI and suicidality (Sobel = 9.16, p < .001). The overall group results held for each ethnicity: AA (Sobel test = 3.95, p < .001), W (Sobel = 5.55, p < .001), and H (Sobel = 4.35, p < .001). Conclusion: Results suggest the need for closer monitoring of adolescent sexual assault victims who also use alcohol to intervene in suicide behaviors.",

The analyses were then conducted for single domains and for a sum score indicating the overall rating of change. The CAGE questionnaire score, the score of drinking-related problems and mean annual intake of alcohol were used as the outcomes, and regression modelling was used to analyze the association between the exposures and the outcomes taking range of covariates into the account.

Routine dental treatment of chronic oro-facial pain (OFP) primarily involves using splints to correct malocclusion or teeth-clenching/grinding. However this mechanistic approach is ineffective. Moreover, such treatments can result in physical and psychological iatrogenesis. In contrast, a growing evidence-base recognises the effectiveness of psychological interventions for OFP, suggesting a role for psychological services within dentistry. In order to translate research into practice, further understanding is needed of patients\u2019 and physicians\u2019 current experience of OFP and its management. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of 25 patients and 35 clinicians (comprising medical and dental practitioners from a range of primary and secondary care services). Audiotaped interviews were transcribed and analysed thematically using principles of constant comparison to categorise emergent and recurring themes within and between transcripts. Thematic categories arising in initial interviews were explored subsequently and disconfirmatory evidence sought until thematic saturation arose. Similar themes emerged from both patients and physicians. Whilst both sets of participants recognised the role that psychological factors could play in the development and maintenance of OFP, management and self-management strategies were largely limited to biomedical interventions. Achieving a diagnosis proved problematic but functional for both parties. Frustration at the current inadequacy of OFP management often led to conflict with (or disengagement from) the clinician-patient relationship. Current management of OFP is ineffective and unsatisfactory for both patients and clinicians and impacts on their relationship. A key barrier to implementing psychological interventions for OFP is the ineffective communication between physicians and patients, and between medical and dental practitioners.",

These shifts are due in part to rapid urbanization and globalization processes, which are contributing to significant changes in behaviors and living situations among populations in these countries. The growing burden of chronic diseases on developing nations is increasing attention on risk factors such as physical inactivity. The U.S. Task Force on Community Preventive Services developed the Guide to Community Preventive Services (the Community Guide) to evaluate the effectiveness of different health promotion interventions, including strategies to increase physical activity in communities. These recommendations have not been systematically examined and applied in developing countries. Project GUIA was initiated in 2005 to examine and promote evidence-based strategies to increase physical activity in Latin America. Its three aims are: (1) to conduct a systematic review of the Latin American literature on physical activity promotion strategies in the community and carefully examine the Community Guide\u2019s applicability; (2) to evaluate two ongoing physical activity interventions in Brazil, and (3) to disseminate evidence-based approaches for promoting physical activity in community settings. Coordinated by the Prevention Research Center in St. Louis, this Project involves cross-national collaboration with multiple academic and governmental institutions, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, WHO/PAHO, the Brazil Ministry of Health, Universidade Federal de S\u00e3o Paulo and CELAFISCS. This presentation will highlight the project\u2019s aims, results of the literature review, findings from an evaluation in Recife, Brazil that is now being replicated in San Diego, California, and results from a social network analysis that has been conducted among partners promoting physical activity in Latin America. The presentation will highlight key lessons from this cross-national collaboration that include the need for a clearer understanding of context, the role of inter-sectoral partnerships, the need to better understand translation of an effective intervention from one population to another.",

Efficacy trials conducted in developed countries have clearly demonstrated that lifestyle change and other kinds of non-pharmacological approaches can significantly reduce diabetes risk. Two key challenges are: (1) How to develop and implement programs that are more feasible for \u2018real world\u2019 implementation and (2) How to extend the reach of such programs to low and middle income countries, as the current trial evidence based in such countries is currently very limited? This presentation considers the development, implementation and evaluation of such programs in Finland and Australia, as well as the recent uptake of lifestyle-related interventions for reducing diabetes risk in other countries. The GOAL study in Finland involved the \u201creal world\u201d evaluation of a moderate-intensity group-based lifestyle change counselling program to prevent type 2 diabetes, adapted from the original Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study (DPS). Drawing on evidence from the Finnish DPS and the short-term results from the GOAL implementation trial, the Australian Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), adapted from the GOAL program, achieved similar positive behavioral and clinical outcomes. Currently, more routinized programs, that are building on the evidence from these \u2018real world\u2019 implementation trials, are being implemented and evaluated in Finland and Australia. As key components of the Finnish GOAL program have become more refined over time, successive versions of the program in different countries are aiming to improve the \u2018fit\u2019 between characteristics of the interventions, the adopters, and the implementation environments. Core components of the GOAL program are now also being adapted for use in programs that are currently being evaluated in Malaysia, India and South Africa. There is an urgent need for more collaborative and coordinated approaches that compare and contrast methods for adapting and spreading effective intervention programs between settings, regions, and countries.",

The CLBP patients were divided on the basis of the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK) into a high and low fear-avoidant group. They viewed 120 photographs depicting neutral and painful movements, generally fear-inducing and neutral objects from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) and spiders while functional MRI data were acquired. For CLBP patients activations were found in brain areas commonly implicated in emotional processing (cingulate cortex, orbitofrontal cortex) for the contrast of painful > neutral movements. However, in a random effects analysis, CLBP patients with high fear avoidance did not differ from those with low fear avoidance or controls with regard to this contrast. For the contrast fear-inducing IAPS pictures > neutral pictures, CLBP patients with high fear avoidance exhibited an activation in the left anterior insula, which was not found in those with low fear avoidance.

Using sex and gender and all significant psychological variables as predictors in multiple regression analyses showed that essentially sex and fear of pain significantly predicted pain.

The results show significant bivariate associations between faculty\u2019s desire to leave their jobs with the majority of indicators related to workload, control over work, rewards, and work-related stress. Multiple logistic regression analysis, controlled for relevant demographic factors (age, sex and years of service), shows that faculty who perceive low control over work demonstrate the strongest likelihood of leaving their jobs (adjusted odds, AO = 3.775), followed by those who perceive lack of rewards (AO = 2.402), high work-related stress (AO = 2.363), and higher workload (AO = 2.278).",

The sample was constituted by 100 female hospital-based nurses (Age: M = 34.32; SD = 9.15), from northern Portugal. Participants were assessed using a Demographic and Professional Form; the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) and the Brief Personal Survey-R (BPS), to evaluate stress responses and coping resources; the \u201cJob Content Questionnaire\u201d (JCQ - SS), to assess co-worker social support; and the \u201cWork-Family Conflict & Family-Work Conflict\u201d Scales, to measure the interference between work and home domains. Hierarchical regression analyses were computed to determine the significant predictors of health distress. The results of the GHQ-12 show clinical levels of distress in 73% of the nurses. General levels of distress were predicted by coping confidence (CC, \u03b2 = \u2212.28, p = .005) and Work-Family Conflict (WFC. \u03b2 = .30, p = .004). Predictors for specific stress responses (BPS anger, guilt and pressure) were the same and in the same direction. In addition, co-worker social support predicted stress responses of guilt (\u03b2 = \u2212.19, p = .04) and anger (\u03b2 = \u2212.19, p = .04). The total variance explained by these predictors in nurses\u2019 stress responses ranged from 15 to 27%. Some professional variables (night shift work and daily work load) and family variables (number of children at home) were also significant predictors of reported stress (variance explained ranging from 4 to 8%). Findings support the high incidence of distress in Portuguese nurses reported in other studies. Furthermore, the data points to the need to consider the family-home spill over in occupational health intervention programs. Coping resources and co-worker social support constitute key variables in reducing work stress among this population.",

This study investigated sex differences in relations of subclinical cerebrovascular disease (SCD), brain atrophy (BA) and HRQoL in 154 healthy older adults (50.6% male; mean age = 66 years) free of major medical, neurologic, and psychiatric disease. Participants completed the Medical Outcomes Survey Short Form-36 (SF-36) and underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) rated by a neuroradiologist for markers of SCD (i.e. periventricular and deep white matter hyperintensities, number of silent infarcts) and BA (i.e. ventricular enlargement, sulcal widening). We create two rank-sum variables (SCD, BA) to serve as primary predictor variables. Multiple regression analyses (adjusted for age, race, education, blood pressure, body mass index, smoking, and Beck Depression Inventory scores) examined the interaction of sex with SCD and BA on HRQoL. Results revealed that for women, SCD was negatively related to the Mental Component Score of the SF-36 (MCS; rsq = \u2212.09, b = \u22124.26, p = .02). For men, BA was negatively related to the Physical Component Score of the SF-36 (PCS; rsq=.06, b = \u22121.58, p = .04). Results suggest that deleterious changes in brain structure (particularly SCD) are related to poorer outcomes in mental health dimensions of older women\u2019s quality of life. Conversely, in men, brain atrophy relates to poorer physical function. Thus, there are sex differences in the relations of subclinical brain pathology to HRQoL in older adults.",

A maximum of 4 observations of the degree of frailty were acquired over a ten-year follow-up period. Indicators of socioeconomic position were education level and household income. We conducted several types of linear mixed model analyses to assess socioeconomic inequalities in the development of frailty, including complete case analyses, and with frailty imputed for those who died during follow-up.",

Interactions of education and income with time of frailty measurement suggested that the association of education and income with frailty increased during follow-up. Analyses with imputations for missing observations due to deaths yielded similar results. Conclusion: Having a high socioeconomic position is still protective against one of the core geriatric health problems; frailty. This suggests that differences in vulnerability late in life may account for socioeconomic inequalities in health at even later stages of life, but also that reversing these inequalities is partly feasible.",

Municipalities in Japan offer elderly persons interventions consisting of group-based exercise sessions and behavioral counseling; however, for a variety of reasons, many individuals do not participate in the interventions. Some are physically frail, some have limited means of transportation and others are self-conscious about exercising with friends. Therefore, it is important to confirm the effect of low-frequency exercise participation compared with that of high-frequency. Thirty-nine participants, aged 67-85 years, participated in this study. All were identified as frail elderly persons according to the criteria of the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, Japan. The participants were divided into two groups that were assigned to different intervention schedules. The high-frequency group (n = 14; 68-83 years) met 12 times over a 3-month period, while the low-frequency group (n = 25; 67-85 years) met 6 times over a 3-month period. Each 90-minute session consisted of group-based exercises and behavioral counseling. The exercises, which the participants were encouraged to practice daily at home, included 4 stretching and 6 strengthening exercises. To encourage exercise, 6 behavioral counseling sessions were offered in which illustrated stories or four-panel cartoons were used. After 3 months, members of both groups showed significant improvement in functional fitness as well as in 5 of 8 dimensions of QOL measured by the SF-36. Improvement in the social dimension of QOL was significantly higher in the high-frequency group than in the low-frequency group. Thus, both low- and high-frequency interventions offer significant positive effects for frail elderly persons. If elderly individuals need a great amount of socialization, a high-frequency intervention is recommended.",

Identifying mediators of PA maintenance is important for assisting BCS in adopting sustainable PA behavior change. Because we have reported continued improvements in PA 3 months after completing a PA behavior change intervention for BCS, our study aim was to determine if the change in social cognitive theory (SCT) constructs during the intervention mediated the effect of our intervention on PA. We randomized 41 BCS to receive a SCT-based 3-month PA behavior change intervention (INT; n = 21) or usual care (UC; n = 20). The INT group received 12 supervised aerobic exercise sessions tapered to home-based exercise. Behavioral support was provided in 6 discussion groups and 3 individual face-to-face counseling sessions. The UC group received written materials. PA (i.e., accelerometer) and SCT constructs (i.e., survey) were assessed at baseline, immediately post-intervention (i.e., 3 months), and 3 months post-intervention (i.e., 6 months). The mediation of the intervention effect on PA at 6 months by changes in SCT constructs from baseline to 3 months was examined using the Freedman and Schatzkin approach. Compared to UC, the INT group reported improved barriers interference (mean difference = \u22127.8; 95% CI = \u221215.1 to -.4; d = \u2212.67; p = .04) and PA enjoyment (mean difference = .7; 95% CI = 0 to 1.5; d = .61; p = .06). Barriers self-efficacy d was .28 (p = .38). Barriers interference and self-efficacy mediated 39% (p = .004) and 19% (p = .02) of the intervention effect on sustained adherence, respectively. In conclusion, only barrier interference and barriers self-efficacy significantly mediated the effect of the intervention on PA 3 months after intervention completion. The increase in enjoyment did not explain sustained PA improvement. Our results suggest that reducing barriers may partially explain the ability of our intervention to demonstrate longer term PA adherence.",

We report 6-month nutrition data from a 2-year multidisciplinary weight management program for obese adolescents, the T.E.E.N.S. Program (N = 173 at baseline, N = 66 at 6 months). At baseline, participants were 76% African American, 65% female, with a mean age of 13.7. Mean BMI percentile was 99.1 (mean BMI z-score = 2.5) at baseline. Repeated measures MANOVAs were used to examine differences from baseline (T1) to 6-month (T2) follow-up on a 24-hour dietary recall measure. Changes in anthropometrics and blood lipid parameters were also evaluated. At 6-months, participants significantly reduced their intake of calories, fat, sodium, and sugar (p < .05); no changes in calcium or fiber intake were found (p > .05). Gender stratified models showed that boys had greater increases in fruit and vegetable and vitamin D intake compared to girls (p < .05). Significant improvements in body mass index and lipid profiles were found in the total sample (p < .05). Multiple regression analysis suggested that caloric reduction from baseline to 6-month was associated with decreases in BMI z-score (\u03b2 = \u22120.11, p < .05). However, when parental compliance with nutrition visits was included in the regression, change in calories was no longer significant. Parental compliance became the only significant predictor of 6-month BMI z-score, while controlling for baseline BMI z-score (\u03b2 = \u22120.16, p < .01). Findings suggest that promoting intake of essential nutrients may be more challenging than reducing excessive intake. Additional gender specific strategies for dietary modification may be warranted. Further, increased parental participation in adolescent weight management programs is also recommended to enhance weight loss.",

It is even more challenging for obese persons with either depression or pain, but the impact of these conditions may differ. The present study examined the effects of depression and pain on perception of barriers to PA, confidence about engaging in PA, and current weekly PA in a group of overweight/obese male veterans. Study participants completed the Barriers to Being Active Quiz, Exercise Self-efficacy Scale, and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. The study sample included 101 male Veterans with BMI \u2265 25. The mean age was 61.2 years. Of the sample, 62.4 % reported a painful medical condition (i.e., either arthritic joint pain or back pain) and 48.5% reported a clinically significant Patient Health Questionnaire-9 depression score \u2265 15. Reporting a pain condition was marginally associated with depression (p = .064). Of the study sample, 85.9% reported weekly PA, ranging from walking to vigorous activity. Amount of activity was brief; only 27.7% reported PA \u2265 1 hour. Two factor ANOVAs assessed the contributions of both pain and depression on barriers to PA and exercise self-efficacy. Results revealed a main effect for depression on three of seven perceived barriers to PA: lack of energy, motivation, and skill level. In contrast, a main effect for pain was revealed for one barrier, fear of injury, as well as for exercise self-efficacy (p\u2019s < .05). Veterans with pain (but not depression) were less likely to report engaging in weekly PA (X2 = 4.0, p < .05). Results suggest that although frequently comorbid in obese Veterans, depression and pain are associated with different perceived PA challenges. Depressed Veterans are more likely to report energy and motivational barriers to PA, while Veterans with pain are specifically concerned about hurting themselves during exercise and are less confident that they could actually engage in exercise under challenging conditions. In turn, veterans with pain are less likely to engage in any weekly activity.",

Participants felt that messages were overly focused on the physical rather than emotional health consequences of obesity i.e. the risk of getting cancer, or dying from obesity. Many, particularly those who were severely obese, described feeling stigmatised and blamed by the simplicity of messages and the lack of realistic solutions available to them. Whilst they trusted government based messages, they acted upon the solutions provided by the commercial weight loss industry. Participants supported non-stigmatising messages from non-commercial sources that were focused on encouraging individuals to make healthy lifestyle changes, rather than promoting weight loss.",

Consequently, it is not surprising that a substantial number of studies have revealed that HNC patients are susceptible to experiencing clinical levels of anxiety (including PTSD) and depressive disorders. Surprisingly however, there is a paucity of psychological studies targeting the management of stress and depressive disorders in this population. Similarly, there are only a very limited number of studies that have evaluated the efficacy of psychotherapy programs tailored for other types of oncology populations (including breast, prostate, and gastro-intestinal cancers) specifically suffering from clinically elevated anxiety or mood disturbances. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) has been shown to be helpful in managing anxiety and depression in various psychiatric and health populations. Several studies have found the early application of a brief version of CBT, to be a useful treatment in reducing severe acute stress, as well as preventing the development of chronic psychological disorders in survivors following non-cancer traumatic events. Accordingly, the aim of the present RCT study (still in progress) was to test an early, brief (6-session) CBT program in reducing clinically elevated posttraumatic stress and depressive responses in newly diagnosed HNC patients undergoing radiotherapy. The efficacy of the CBT program was compared to a 6-session Supportive Counselling (SC) intervention. Participant inclusion criteria comprised adult individuals (aged 18 - 70 years) who met subthreshold or full diagnostic criteria for cancer-related PTSD and/or comorbid anxiety and depression disorders, and who had been prescribed to receive radiotherapy as part of their medical treatment for their HNC. To date, 25 patients have been randomized to receive either the CBT or SC intervention, and 16 patients have completed the therapy program. The results to date indicate that the CBT program is effective in reducing both posttraumatic stress and depressive symptoms, as well as enhancing social well-being. Findings will be discussed in context of the utility of this early brief intervention in treating acute stress and preventing chronic psychopathology in traumatized cancer patients. Discussion will also focus on logistical considerations in conducting psychotherapy concurrent with medical treatments in oncology populations.",

The aims of this study were to examine the effects of mindfulness stress reduction training on perceived stress, psychological well-being and levels of cortisol, and to examine if changes in mindfulness mediate intervention effects on these outcomes. Seventy women and one man with a previous cancer diagnosis (mean age 51.8 years, SD = 9.86) were randomized into an intervention group or a wait-list control group. The intervention consisted of an 8-week mindfulness-training course. A repeated measures MANCOVA showed that compared to participants in the control group, participants in the mindfulness-training group had significantly decreased perceived stress, post-traumatic avoidance symptoms, and increased coping self-efficacy at 6-month follow-up (F16, 51 = 1.32, p < 0.05). Those who participated in the intervention reported significant increase in mindfulness when compared to controls (F10, 57 = 2.34, p < 0.05). The increase in mindfulness mediated the effects of the intervention on perceived stress, and coping self-efficacy. The results indicated and intervention effect on awakening cortisol. Among those with initial low levels of cortisol, there was an increase from baseline to 3-month follow-up, and among those with initial high levels there was a decreased level of cortisol at 3-month follow-up. There was an association between changes in stress symptoms and cortisol levels. This study indicates that increased levels of mindfulness can potentially explain reduction of stress symptoms resulting from mindfulness stress reduction training. The results indicated a normalization of cortisol levels as a result of the intervention. The importance of these findings for future research in the field of mindfulness is discussed.",

In particular, prenatal stress is associated with long-term disturbances in HPA axis function.A sample of 115 10-year old children was examined in a cross-sectional study design. The experimental group (n = 43) was characterized by a glucocorticoid treatment of their mothers due to high risk of preterm delivery during the second trimester. Control group A (n = 35) consisted of children who were at risk of being born prematurely but did not receive glucocorticoid treatment. In control group B (n = 37) children were included born after complication-free pregnancy. A standardized psychosocial stress test for children (TSST-C) was applied. All children were healthy and showed no disparities in their level of development. Salivary cortisol and heart rate were measured during the experiment as well as psychological parameters using self-report questionnaires (EWL-KJ and PASA). The TSST-C induced a marginally significant increase of salivary cortisol (F(4.814,269.601) = 1.939, p = .091). Significant higher cortisol levels were observed in children of the experimental group as compared to children of control group B. Referring to the data for the heart rate in response to the TSST-C a trend towards significance was revealed (F(15.069, 836.313) = 1.505, p = .096). lower heart rates were found in The experimental group showed lower heart rates than the control groups A and B. Furthermore, stress appraisal and mood significantly differed between the three groups.Even though all children were comparable concerning their level of education and mental abilities, we found subtle differences in their psychobiological stress reactivity. The prenatally stressed offspring demonstrated a stronger glucocorticoid response in reaction to challenging situations than controls. In addition, the results revealed long term effects of prenatal glucocorticoids on psychological and on autonomic reactivity to a standardized psychosocial stress test.",

The prevalence of PTS symptoms was estimated at 27.7% in children who were in grades 1 to 5 and at 26.4% in children and adolescents in grades 6 to 12. Specific symptom clusters had higher prevalence. Between 41-53% (depending on age) reported difficulty in falling and staying asleep. Older age was associated with increased symptoms. Past and concurrent exposures to war-related events were the strongest predictors of PTS symptoms. The other study included 151 Kuwaiti children who were 7-10 years old during the first Gulf war, selected for participation based on their level of exposure to war-related events. Participants were assessed two years after the war and again as young adults (19-23 years old). As adults they reported on their general health, medical diagnoses, and sleep habits. At both assessments they reported on symptoms of posttraumatic stress, depression, and anxiety. A structural model supported the notion that psychological distress mediates the effect of war exposure on self-rated health, quality of sleep, and obesity.",

These conditions are described by common subjective health complaints such as musculoskeletal pain, gastrointestinal discomfort, tiredness, fatigue, allergic and respiratory complaints, depression, and anxiety. Subjective health complaints are common in the general population. For most people the complaints are minor everyday nuisance, however for some it becomes substantial and is given a diagnostic label and professional help is needed. An important question is why and to whom this happens. A possible mechanism for such multiple symptoms could be somatic and cognitive sensitization. Furthermore, two cognitive mechanisms that seem to be closely linked to the process of sensitization are worrying and coping. There is an increasing interest of health in media and in the population. This might lead to worries concerning features of modern life and its affect on health. Worrying could play a role by enhancing biased memory and interest of health related information, leading to sensitization. Therefore, modern health worries could be associated with health complaints and medically unexplained symptoms. Individuals that uses active problem solving coping strategies have been found to have lower levels of subjective health complaints than others in stressful work situations. An essential condition for coping to occur is that the individual expects a positive result of the handling of a stressful situation, i.e. positive response outcome expectancy. The result of no control of the outcome would be learned helplessness and negative response outcome expectancy could be defined as hopelessness. Both hopelessness and helplessness may lead to depression and multiple subjective health complaints. In this symposium the relationships between subjective health complaints, modern health worries and coping will be discussed.",

For patients, experience of discreditation could lead to withdrawal and disengagement. Identity is challenged when the legitimacy of the illness is questioned. This burden adds to a loss of previously established identity and makes the patient vulnerable beyond symptom perception. CFS patients cope with their condition by trying to know more, by keeping a distance to protect themselves and learning more about their limits. Doctors can support patients\u2019 coping by supporting the strong sides of the patients instead of casting doubt upon them. Furthermore, common ground for understanding can be enhanced by presenting disease models suggesting mechanisms of what happens in the body in CFS, such as sustained arousal with subsequent symptom maintenance. The Cognitive Activation Theory of Stress provides a framework for negotiating the impact of stimulus and response expectations and transcends the vicious circles of sensitization. The presentation will demonstrate how patient perspectives and disease models can be connected.",

In recent years some countries have banned smoking in pubs and bars, the last public venues where it was still allowed.

In 1983, a law banning smoking in public places in Israel was enacted and amendments to the basic law were added over the years.

Background: CHD is the leading cause of death in the United States today, with family history (FH) long known as an important risk factor. We tested the hypothesis that those who believe that CHD is not preventable, possibly because they have a positive FH, do not alter their health behavior (in this case exercise) to be cardioprotective. Methods: Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the adjusted hazard ratios (HR) of FH, preventability belief, and exercise for incident CHD. We first constructed a baseline Cox proportional hazards regression model of the association between incident CHD and FH controlling for age at baseline and Framingham risk score (an index of standard CHD risk factors). We then constructed a second Cox proportional hazards regression model to test if preventability belief was related to FH and a third model to test if belief could be viewed as a mediator of the FH-CHD relation. Finally we evaluated if the preventability belief-CHD relation was itself mediated by exercise .Results: Preventability belief was correlated with family history for both genders (\u03b2 = .724, 95% confidence interval [CI] .592-.885, p < .005), with those that had a family history of heart disease less likely to believe that heart disease can be prevented. Preventability belief was also found to be a mediator between family history and CHD, but for women only (\u03b2 = 2.51, 95% CI 1.65-3.80, p < .001). Finally exercise mediated this relation, again for women only (\u03b2 = \u2212 .868, HR = .420, 95% CI (HR) 0.770 - 0.907, p < .001) Conclusion: Health belief in the preventability of CHD was found to be an important mediator in the relation between family history of CHD and incident CHD in women because of its effect on exercise.",

            "text": "Heart failure (HF) affects millions of individuals and is increasing in prevalence. Close to a third of HF patients exhibit clinical levels of depressive symptoms. In turn, depression is associated with greater morbidity and mortality in HF. The mechanisms linking depression and worse outcome in HF are unclear. One suggested pathway links depression with heightened inflammation that may then be related to undesirable cardiac remodeling in HF. However, there have been mixed results in the literature connecting depression with inflammation in cardiac patients. Methods: The present study attempts to further delineate relations between depression and inflammatory markers in HF patients by using an exercise task to unmask group differences. Further, components of depression were examined separately to determine if inflammatory markers were differentially associated with somatic or cognitive depression symptoms. 40 NYHA II-IV HF patients and 35 healthy controls performed a moderate 20-min bicycle exercise task and completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), sub-categorized into somatic (BDI-s) and cognitive (BDI-c) symptoms. Plasma levels of IL-6 were measured at baseline, 10 min and 30 min after exercise. Repeated measures ANCOVA were performed, controlling for age, gender, body mass index and physical function. Results: Both HF patients and controls with elevated BDI-s exhibited higher plasma levels of IL-6 at baseline, which remained elevated until 30 min post- exercise task (time x BDI-s effect, F(8, 65) = 4.16, p = .045). Meanwhile, those with lower BDI-s had reduced IL-6 levels across the entire period. In contrast, elevated BDI-c symptoms were associated with low IL-6 at baseline in both HF and non-HF groups, but then an increase in IL-6 in the non-HF controls by 30 min post- exercise (group x time x BDI-c effect, F(8,65) = 7.6, p = .007). Conclusions: Elevated IL-6 levels until 30-min post task were associated with heightened somatic symptoms of depression, whereas HF patients with elevated cognitive symptoms had lower levels of IL-6 through 30 min- post exercise. By further understanding the components of depression associated with elevated inflammatory markers, interventions may be developed to specifically address symptoms of depression that may worsen cardiac outcomes.",

The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of multiple psychosocial factors on stroke mortality in older adults. Participants included 3,656 adults (59.9% African American, 40.1% non-Hispanic white; 61.2% female) with a mean (SD) age of 77.0 (6.2) years from the Chicago Health and Aging Project (CHAP). CHAP is an ongoing, longitudinal study of risk for Alzheimer\u2019s Disease and other chronic conditions of the elderly. Mortality was ascertained through 12/31/05 and verified by data from the National Death Index; over 7.7 years of follow-up, 76 fatal strokes were identified. Prior principal component analysis on nine psychosocial questionnaires revealed three primary factors related to distress (depression, neuroticism, perceived stress, life satisfaction), social connectivity (social engagement, spirituality, social networks), and unfair treatment (hostility, perceived discrimination). Factor scores were computed by summing individual z-scores for each questionnaire loading on the factor. Cox models were conducted for each factor score adjusting for age, race, sex, education, systolic blood pressure, body mass index, physical activity, smoking and chronic conditions. Each 1-point higher distress score related to a significant 10% increase in stroke mortality [HR = 1.10; 95% CI = 1.03-1.18; p < .008]. Results were unchanged further controlling for history of stroke. There were no main effects of social connectivity and unfair treatment on stroke mortality. In this cohort of elderly African American and non-Hispanic white adults, higher levels of distress contributed significantly to greater risk of dying from stroke over nearly 8 years of follow-up. Additional research is needed to identify mechanisms underlying the association between distress and stroke mortality. [Supported by NIH/DHHS (grants HL84209, AG11101, ES10902.)]",

Socioeconomic status, here represented by education, clearly influenced both prevalence and incidence of diabetes and glucose concentration. In all time periods and in all age groups, individuals with low education were more likely to have or get diabetes than highly educated people. A large age-specific effect was found, with the 10-year risk of developing diabetes 4-5 times higher in the oldest age group (50 to 60 years) compared with the youngest (30 to 40 years).

Findings showed that the magnitude of the effect of breastfeeding on psychological well-being was larger in women than in men. After accounting for the effect of childhood social adversity, breastfeeding promoted psychosocial adjustment during childhood in girls in NCDS (OR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.05-1.48) and in BCS70 (OR = 1.44, 95% CI = 1.15-1.81), but not in boys. In adulthood, being breastfed at birth was associated with higher self efficacy (OR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.06-1.61) and lower risk of psychological ill health (OR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.61-0.96) in women in BCS70 only. Although breastfeeding did not moderate the negative effect of childhood social adversity on childhood or adulthood outcomes in this study, findings suggest that the practice of breastfeeding can be important for women\u2019s psychological well-being throughout the life course.",

However, sexual risk reduction interventions for drug users have traditionally focused on urban populations. We used qualitative techniques to understand rural African-American cocaine users\u2019 perspectives on sexual risk and HIV/STI so that we could tailor an existing intervention to this underserved population. Using purposive sampling, 40 African-American cocaine users from two rural towns were recruited to participate in four focus groups, which were audio-taped and transcribed verbatim. Three investigators coded the data using content analysis and constant comparison. Three major themes emerged: HIV knowledge and beliefs, selling & buying sex, and perceptions of condom use. Participants held many inaccurate beliefs about HIV, including how to identify high-risk partners. Attitudes about HIV testing varied by gender, with women being more accepting; however, most were doubtful about effective HIV treatments. Most participants had complex beliefs about trading sex, with \u201csurvival sex\u201d seen as acceptable but \u201ctricking for drugs\u201d as unacceptable, despite reports that both types were common. Both men and women were socially classified as \u201cdirty\u201d or \u201cnasty\u201d based in large part on sexual trading behaviors. Participants viewed condoms as protective against HIV and STI, but also reported strong resistance to condom use by both men and women. They reported using hygiene as a proxy for gauging a potential partner\u2019s risk and therefore the importance of condom use. Significant knowledge deficits, high-risk beliefs, and social pressures appear to converge on rural African-American cocaine users and contribute to increased HIV and STI rates. These findings were incorporated into a social cognitive theory-based intervention to address these challenges and reduce risk behaviors.",

            "text": "The growing amount of youth in the United States living with HIV/AIDS is a persistent problem. Not only has the number of newly infected 15 to 29 year olds consistently increased over the last decade, the emergence of antiretroviral therapy has meant that those born with HIV are growing into adolescence and beyond. Consequently, HIV/AIDS is now being treated more like a chronic illness than a terminal disease. While much focus has been paid to identifying the specific factors that place individuals at risk for acquiring or transmitting HIV, little attention has been directed toward those behaviors that help promote health in the existing population of young people living with HIV (YPLH). These health protective behaviors can assist in prolonging lives. The preliminary data being presented here includes ninety-one participants who have completed their initial visits of a study assessing coping styles as predictors of adherence in urban YPLH. The sample was recruited from two clinics that serve adolescents with perinatal and risk-acquired HIV. The youth range from age 13 -22 years. Specific health protective behaviors were identified that either help promote immune functioning or delay disease progression in YPLH. Study participants responded to questions regarding their diet/nutrition, exercise, sleep habits and taking of multivitamins/supplements. Results highlighted some health protective behavior areas of promise and need. Most respondents reported eating vegetables and fruit \u201csome days\u201d of the week (71.4 % and 76.9 % respectively). In the month prior to baseline, only 32% reported eating fast food one or more times a week. More than half of the youth (50.6%) had at least 20 minutes of exercise less than 3 days a week. While a third of the group (33%/30 pts) walked briskly for at least 10 minutes daily. On the other hand, almost all participants reported eating candy, chips or cookies \u201csome days\u201d (52.7%) or \u201cevery day\u201d (41.8%). Similarly, 73.7 % had less than 4 days of exercise in the prior month and 43% received less than the recommended amount of sleep. Health protective behaviors are an important aspect of managing care for urban YPLH.",

As most studies in the area are cross-sectional, relatively little is known about possible predictors. AIM: To explore the prevalence of pain and the role of depression as predictor in a nationwide prospective study of women treated for breast cancer. METHODS: The study cohort consisted of 3343 Danish women (aged 26-70) treated for primary breast cancer according to standardized guidelines. A questionnaire package including Beck\u2019s Depression Inventory was mailed out 3- (baseline) and 15-months post-surgery (follow-up). The response rate at follow-up was 94%. Probable cases of major depression (MD) were identified according to the manual (cutoff >= 17). Frequency and severity of treatment-related pain in breast and arm or shoulder was assessed by 4 items at follow-up (range: \u201cno pain\u201d to \u201call the time\u201d and \u201cno pain\u201d to \u201cextremely severe\u201d). DBCG and the surgical departments provided data on eligibility, clinical variables and comorbidity. Data on psychiatric history, demographic-, and socioeconomic factors were obtained from national registries. RESULTS: At follow-up, 73% reported pain during the recent month and 33% had pain \u201calmost every day\u201d or more often. Twenty-eight percent were \u201csomewhat\u201d or more affected by pain and 11% were \u201cvery\u201d or \u201cextremely\u201d affected. Women with MD at baseline were more likely to experience pain \u201calmost every day\u201d or more often at follow-up (OR = 2.63; (95% CI, 2.12-3.27)) and more likely to be affected \u201csomewhat\u201d or more by pain (OR = 3.49; (95% CI, 2.80-4.35)). When adjusted for potential confounders (demographic-, socio-economic-, clinical-, health status-, and health behavior variables), the predictive power of MD persisted (OR = 1.93; (95% CI, 1.50-2.48), and OR = 2.31; (95% CI, 1.79-2.99)). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of treatment-related pain was substantial with nearly 3 out of 4 experiencing pain 15 months post-surgery and 1 out of 9 reporting to be very or extremely affected. Depression was found to be an important independent predictor of pain.",

            "text": "AIM: Relative to other oncology populations, the brain tumor (BT) population is unique given that both benign and malignant BTs can be life-threatening and can cause severe neurocognitive and psychosocial disturbances. No study to date however, has investigated the effects of BT-related posttraumatic stress (PTSS) on neurocognitive functioning and overall quality of life in adult BT patients. The aim of the present study was to address this question. METHOD: Utilizing a longitudinal design, adult individuals diagnosed with a primary BT were assessed on average, within 6-weeks prior to starting radiotherapy (T1), and re-assessed at 3 months post-radiotherapy (T2). At both assessments, participants were administered a standardized battery of tests measuring BT-related PTSS, mood, quality of life, memory and executive functioning. RESULTS: To date, 64 patients (36 females, 28 males) have been re-assessed at T2. At both T1 and T2, 14% of the sample reported clinically elevated levels of PTSS pertaining to their BT experience; although, the effects of PTSS fluctuated over time. Whereas 40% of individuals who reported elevated PTSS prior to commencing radiotherapy continued to report elevated PTSS at T2, 60% of patients with elevated PTSS at T2 did not experience elevated PTSS at T1. Prior to radiotherapy (T1), individuals with elevated PTSS were found to have significantly reduced functional well-being, elevated BT symptoms and social constraints, as well as heightened depressive, anger, fatigue and confusion symptoms (p\u2019s < .05) compared to patients with low PTSS at T1. Individuals with elevated PTSS also evidenced significantly reduced scores on working memory and executive tests (p\u2019s < .05) compared to individuals with low PTSS at T1. Similarly, individuals with elevated PTSS at T2 reported significantly reduced functional well being, vigor, and overall quality of life, as well as elevated BT symptoms, depression, anger, confusion, and social constraints (p\u2019s < .05) compared to individuals with low PTSS, 3-months post-radiotherapy. Individuals with high PTSS at T2 also performed significantly worse on working memory and executive tests (p\u2019s < .05). DISCUSSION: The findings suggest that approximately one in seven individuals diagnosed with a primary BT are at risk of suffering from PTSS as a result of their tumor experience. Notably, these results indicate that PTSS compromises neurocognitive and psychosocial functioning including overall quality of life in BT patients undergoing radiation therapy. The findings will be discussed in context of developing and implementing appropriate counseling and rehabilitation services to address the unique needs of BT survivors.",

Since HIV in Togo - the most common cause of death, representing 17% of all deaths - is spread primarily through unprotected sex, safe sex practices such as condom use can reduce HIV spread significantly. We examined the efficacy of a behavioral intervention to promote condom use among Togolese young people at high risk for HIV infection. Methods: We randomized - without known HIV infection - 446 Togolese people aged 16 to 24 years consulting 3 sexually transmitted disease clinics in Lom\u00e9, who had recently had unprotected sex, to a 1-hour behavioral intervention or a didactic control condition. At baseline and 6 months, participants underwent interviews about their sexual behaviors and consistent condom use and testing for HIV. Results: We observed a 51% decline in HIV infection incidence (P = .03) in the intervention group. Incidence density for the intervention versus control groups was 1.6 versus 3.27 per 100 person-years (P < .001). Participants in the intervention group reported using condoms more consistently in the 30 days preceding the 6-month assessment (unadjusted analysis, intervention, 74.2% vs control, 48.7%). Participants in the intervention group reported using condoms more consistently over the entire 6-month period (adjusted odds ratio, 2.30; 95% CI, 1.51-3.50; P = .001). Conclusions: This brief behavioral intervention shows promise in reducing HIV risk behaviors among Togolese young people and may be transferable to other sub-Saharan African countries.",

            "text": "SUMMARY: To evaluate correlates of sexual risk behaviors associated with HIV/AIDS infection among adolescents participating in 2005 Colorado Youth Risk Behavioral Survey, since previous studies have produced mixed findings. The State mandates abstinence-only program across all public schools. Multinomial logistic regression was used to evaluate relationships among dependent variables and independent variables. We found no significant effect of having received in-school HIV/AIDS education on all outcome measures. Compared with females, males were more likely to initiate sex at a relatively younger age, report unprotected sex with multiple partners, and to drink alcohol before sexual intercourse. Efforts to control the HIV/AIDS epidemic among adolescents may need to focus on targeted interventions aimed at addressing gender- and racial/ethnic-specific risk exposures among this population group, including risk behaviors linked with lifetime sexual abuse. The need to re-examine the role of in-school HIV prevention programs to build adequate competencies among students, parents and community leaders is recommended.",

Details of the survey design and psychometric validity of questionnaire items are found in other publications. Briefly, the YRBS is a self-reported paper-based survey of high school students conducted every two years by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in collaboration with Colorado local implementing partners. The survey monitors risk behaviors and other characteristics associated with mortality and morbidity among students in grades 9 through 12. In 2005, the survey was administered to a representative sample of 1,498 students from 29 public high schools throughout the state, and the overall response rate was 60%. Surveyed schools and classes were selected systematically with probability proportional to enrollment based on grade levels.",

Age at first sexual intercourse was categorized based on respondents\u2019 age at their first sexual intercourse as: no sexual intercourse (participants reported as not having ever had sexual intercourse at the time of survey irrespective of age), young adolescents (11\u201314 years), and older adolescents (\u2265 15 years). Number of current sexual partners was assessed based on the reported number of sexual partners in the 3 months preceding the survey and categorized as following: never had sexual intercourse, had 1 partner, and had \u2265 2 sexual partners. These variables were selected because of their known association with transmission of HIV infections (Mullings, Marquart & Brewer, 2000).",

To further assess the relationship between independent and outcome variables, all independent variables that attained a statistical significance of P \u2264 .25 in bivariate analyses were entered into multinomial logistic regression models in a manual stepwise fashion, starting with those with the lowest P-value. This method allows dependent variable to have more than two categories, thereby providing a single estimate of odds ratio (OR) for the association between the independent variables and each combination of the dependent variables, while controlling for potential confounders. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated and used as estimates of risk ratios. The likelihood ratio test was used to compare models to determine which variables were retained in multivariate models at a significance level \u03b1=.05. Age and grade level were not included in the same models because of potential collinearity. All analyses were performed with SAS 9.1.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and the survey weight variable was used to account for the complex sampling design of the survey to provide estimates representative of the high school student population across the state.",

These proportions mirror the approximate distribution of racial groups across the state. Both genders are equally represented in this sample with older adolescents (ages 15\u201318 years) being the predominant group. Nearly 85% of students reported receiving voluntary in-school HIV/AIDS education. In adjusted analyses, predictors significantly associated with high risk sexual behaviors included being male, Hispanic, and having had physically forced sex. Likewise, light and binge drinking, smoking, and illegal substance use showed significant effects on sexual risk behaviors. The highest risk for early sexual debut was observed among Blacks, and Hispanics. Similarly, there was an 8-fold increase in the odds of early sexual debut among adolescents reporting physically forced sex. A dose-response relationship was observed between illegal substance use and age of sexual debut, with the strongest effect among young adolescents. Likewise, current or past smoking was associated with increased odds of early sexual debut. Statistically significant correlates of having one or more sexual partners included being Latino and high user of illegal substances, reporting forced sex, drinking alcohol, and current smoking. Associations appeared more marked among respondents using two or more drugs and having \u2265 2 sexual partners.",
