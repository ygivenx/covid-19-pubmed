The summer outbreak of H5N1 influenza in poultry has raised the level of concern from the earlier outbreaks that occurred in winter months2. The cocirculation of human influenza viruses during winter provides an opportunity for reassortment with avian influenza viruses (see below) with unpredictable outcomes. Whether H5N1 will be able to acquire potent human-to-human transmissibility is the pressing issue: exactly what are the constraints remaining to the occurrence of this transmission?",

Here, we discuss some of these obstacles by using emerging viral agents as examples. In general terms, for a virus to emerge successfully in a human population it must achieve two feats. The first feat is replication in human cells. This replication requires a virus to accomplish at least five steps: first, contact with a human host; second, entry into the appropriate cell type; third, production of more copies of itself; fourth, overcoming any immediate host response; and fifth, exiting from the cell and transmitting to another. The second feat is human-to-human transmission.",

RNA viruses such as the Nipah virus, Hendra virus, SARS coronavirus, H5N1 influenza A virus and Ebola virus have all jumped from animals to humans but have yet to achieve the next step of successful establishment. By contrast, the H3N2 and H1N1 influenza A viruses and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are examples of animal RNA viruses that have become endemic in humans.",

For example, arenaviruses, the causative agents of several hemorrhagic fevers, use the widely conserved \u03b1-dystroglycan protein as a receptor and therefore show a broad host range and cell tropism4. Coronaviruses, by contrast, generally show a restricted host range that is mediated by specific interaction of the viral spike protein with glycoproteins on the host cell surface5. Although this is a species-specific interaction, Thackray and Holmes6 have shown that the alteration of only a few residues in the amino-terminal region of the viral spike protein can extend the host range of a mouse coronavirus to nonmouse cells. The underlying mechanisms remain undefined, but the increase in host range seems to be mediated by the recognition of alternative receptor molecules by the spike protein.",

The main reservoir of influenza A viruses is the aquatic birds of the world, from which viruses sporadically transmit to other hosts in whom they can adapt and form stable lineages. Influenza viruses from avian and human sources preferentially bind different forms of the virus receptor on the host cell, namely, sialic acid. Avian influenza viruses have a preference for sialic acid that is linked to the galactose unit in a \u03b12-3 conformation, whereas human viruses preferentially bind those with a \u03b12-6 linkage10,11. This binding preference makes biological sense when one considers the host environment in which these viruses grow. The gastrointestinal tract of avian species contains predominantly \u03b12-3-linked sialic acid, in contrast to the abundance of \u03b12-6 linkages in the human respiratory tract.",

Avian H5N1 viruses were transmitted from infected poultry to humans on at least 18 occasions in 1997 despite their retention of avian virus\u2013like receptor specificity16. Similarly, contemporary H9N2 viruses circulating throughout Asia are confined primarily to avian species, despite a move to a more human virus\u2013like receptor specificity17. Recent studies by Matrosovich et al.18 suggest that the receptor-mediated host range factors for influenza viruses might be more subtle than the simple presence or absence of the appropriate receptor. In an elegant set of experiments, these investigators showed that human viruses with a \u03b12-6 receptor preference almost exclusively infect nonciliated human tracheal cells during the early phase of replication, whereas avian viruses with a \u03b12-3 preference target ciliated cells18 (Fig. 2). Thus, the host range barrier for replication of viruses in humans may not be necessarily at the level of binding, but rather at the level of targeting the appropriate cell type.",

Although these mutations occurred in an area known to be associated with resistance to interferon (IFN), the NS5a mutants did not show any changes in IFN susceptibility. A proposed, albeit unproven, explanation is that this area of NS5a interacts with a host protein and changes in this interaction induced by the amino acid substitutions improve the ability of the virus to replicate in Huh7 cells. From these and similar experiments it can be shown that, like the substitutions that can accommodate changes in receptor usage, slight alterations in amino acid composition in viral proteins can substantially alter viral replication. Although for most emerging viruses the exact nature of these interactions between host and viral proteins is poorly understood, a comparison of nonhuman isolates with the corresponding human isolates of emerging viruses may help to identify protein regions for further study.",

IFN was first described by Isaacs and Lindenmann20 in chicken chorioallantoic membranes infected with heat-inactivated influenza A virus. These landmark studies showed that a substance (IFN) produced from infected cells had the capacity to protect surrounding cells from viral infection. Experiments expanding on these original observations showed that, although viral replication was necessary for the expression of IFN, partially inactivated viruses were more potent IFN inducers21. These results strongly suggested that components produced during viral replication were actively repressing the expression and/or action of IFN. It is now known that this is indeed true, and many viruses have evolved mechanisms with which to antagonize the host IFN response.",

The production of IFN leads to the activation of numerous gene products, some of which have direct antiviral activity22. The ability of a virus to replicate successfully in a given host therefore requires the virus to overcome this potent antiviral response. As a direct consequence of this challenge, viruses have developed various mechanisms by which to counteract the host IFN response. Krug et al.23 have referred to this phenomenon as 'intracellular warfare.' In this war, if the virus has an effective mechanism with which to combat the IFN response of the host, the virus wins the battle and its replication ensues. If, however, the virus does not have the appropriate IFN inhibiting abilities, the battle is won by the cell and viral replication is aborted.",

Other interactions, such as Hendra virus V protein binding to complexes of STAT1 and STAT2 (ref. 26), proteins involved in downstream IFN signal transduction, or the proposed binding of influenza A NS1 protein to cellular factors involved in post-transcriptional modifications31,32, require a more specific context. It thus follows that in cases where specific interactions are required, the ability of an IFN antagonist to adapt to specific host factors must be an essential step in the successful emergence of a pathogen in an alternative host. Indeed, it has been shown that the host range of paramyxovirus can be controlled by the viral V protein and that this host range is determined by the interaction of V with STAT2 in a species-dependent manner33.",

Many of the emerging diseases that threaten humans are caused by RNA viruses and this is not by chance. One of the continuing themes in the above discussions is that viruses need to adapt in perhaps numerous ways to cross the species barrier successfully.

As such, RNA viruses exist as a quasi-species comprising viruses of slightly different genetic composition. Thus, when selective conditions arise, such as the conditions present after jumping to a new host, variants with an advantage are quickly amplified. It can therefore take only limited replication under suboptimal conditions before an adapted virus emerges. Unfortunately, the evolution of viruses is not only confined to point mutations inserted during replication. Viruses can also undergo leaps in evolution through the processes of recombination and reassortment.

Unfortunately, we know little about the conditions for successful reassortment and it is difficult to assess the possibility of this happening. The available evidence from influenza A viruses is that there is a selective rather than random mechanism for packaging RNA segments into infectious virions36 and not all combinations of viral genes are compatible. Recent findings from vaccine development have shown that the surface proteins of the H5N1 influenza viruses are at least compatible with older human strains37, suggesting that reassortants of H5N1 and human influenza virus may well be viable. Arenaviruses are also capable of reassortment, although reassortment again does not seem to be completely random and some combinations of genes do not seem to be compatible38.

In addition to numerous tools with which to dissect these cellular factors, the development of reverse genetics systems for many RNA viruses has facilitated the manipulation of the viral genome to an extent that was not previously possible. For example, the resurrection of several pieces of the 1918 Spanish influenza genome46,47 provides the possibility that a genomic analysis of virus and host will explain the extreme pathogenicity of the 1918 outbreak of Spanish influenza that killed up to 50 million people worldwide. Perhaps the greatest advances in the next decade will come from a genomic and proteomic analysis in which all of the interactions between a parasite and a host can be resolved. These areas are the engines that will drive our understanding of both host range and the avenues that are available to a pathogen to overcome host range barriers.

Analysis of the receptor-binding preferences of viruses from each of these hosts has shown that human and avian viruses have preferences for different conformations of the cellular receptor, sialic acid. Because of this, viruses adapted to humans replicate in and transmit well to other humans, but poorly to aquatic birds. Conversely, viruses adapted to aquatic birds replicate in and transmit well to other aquatic birds, but poorly to humans. Swine seem to be unique in terms of influenza A ecology and show an intermediate susceptibility to both human and avian viruses.",

(a) During replication, single point mutations are incorporated into one or more genomic positions as a result of a lack of proofreading activity of the viral polymerase. (b) During recombination, foreign genetic material is incorporated into the viral genome through mechanisms such as template switching during replication. (c) During reassortment, which occurs on dual infection of a cell with segmented genome viruses, whole gene segments can be swapped. All three mechanisms, which are not exclusive, may result in viruses that have new biological properties, such as new host range and pathogenic potential.",
