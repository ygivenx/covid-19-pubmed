For example, the 3a and E proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the 4a protein of human coronavirus (HCoV)-229E have been reported to show ion channel activity [15, 25, 26]. Viral proteins with ion channel activity have also been reported in other viruses and have collectively been termed \u201cviroporins\u201d [12]. The involvement of viroporins in replication and budding has been confirmed in influenza virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV). The replication of these viruses was shown to be markedly inhibited by viroporin inhibitors. Amantadine, 4,4\u2032-disothiocyano-2,2\u2032-stilbenedisulphonic acid (DIDS), and hexamethylene amiloride (HMA) have been identified as viroporin inhibitors. Wilson et al. [25] reported that HMA, an inhibitor of the E protein ion channel, inhibits viral replication of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and HCoV-229E, but the antiviral effect of HMA on FIPV has not been clarified.",

As a negative control, the gene region encoding the S protein (S1 region) of the FIPV serotype I strain KU-2 was inserted into the pDEST15 vector and subsequently introduced into E. coli cells (pDEST15 + KU2S1). The expression of a protein with the target estimated molecular weight was confirmed 4 hours after protein induction in all transformed E. coli cells (Fig. 4A). The predicted sizes of GST + KU2E, GST-1146E, GST + KU2S1, and GST alone were 36, 36, 62, and 28 kDa, respectively. The influence of E protein expression on the growth of E. coli cells was investigated. The growth of cells was significantly lower after 2-4 hours in cells with the induction of the GST + E protein than in cells without induction (Fig. 4B, pDEST15 + KU2E and pDEST15 + 79-1146E). In contrast, no significant differences in growth were observed between cells with the induction of only GST + S1 and GST proteins and cells without induction (Fig. 4B, pDEST15 + KU2S1 and pDEST15). The relationship between inhibition of E. coli cell growth and E-protein-expression-induced changes in membrane permeability was investigated by assessing the incorporation of a substrate of \u03b2-galactosidase, ONPG, by E. coli cells. The uptake of ONPG in cells was significantly higher after 12-24 hours in cells with the induction of the GST + E protein than in cells without induction (Fig. 4C, pDEST15 + KU2S1 and pDEST15). In contrast, no significant changes were observed in the uptake of ONPG between cells with the induction of the GST + S1 protein and cells without the induction (Fig. 4C, pDEST15+KU2S1). The uptake of ONPG was significantly lower after 24 hours in cells in which only the GST protein was induced than in cells without induction (Fig. 4C, pDEST15).\n",

Liao et al. [13] and Madan et al. [16] reported that the E proteins of SARS-CoV and MHV, belonging to the genus Betacoronavirus, function as viroporins. The function of the E protein as a viroporin has been also clarified in a member of the genus Alphacoronavirus (HCoV-229E) [25].

The inhibitory effect of viral replication was investigated by measuring the virus titer in the culture supernatant. Amantadine showed no inhibitory effect on viral replication, whereas HMA drastically inhibited FIPV serotype I replication in a dose-dependent manner but only slightly inhibited FIPV serotype II. HMA drastically decreased the titers of FIPV serotype I strains Black and KU-2 in a dose-dependent manner but decreased the titer of FIPV serotype II strain 79-1146 only slightly. In contrast, DIDS decreased the titer of FIPV serotype II strain 79-1146 in a dose-dependent manner but did not decrease the titers of FIPV serotype I strains Black and KU-2. This may be due to a difference in ion channel activity of viroporin between serotypes I and II FIPV. HMA is a sodium channel blocker [11], whereas DIDS is a chloride channel blocker [19], suggesting that the function of the sodium channel blocker is dominant in the viroporin of serotype I FIPV, whereas the function of the chloride channel blocker is dominant in serotype II FIPV.",

Using these transfectants, the function of the FIPV E protein as a viroporin was investigated with reference to a study by Liao et al. [12]. Since the E protein is hydrophobic, it was assumed that the protein aggregates in the cytoplasm of E. coli cells and is not expressed in the cell membrane. To avoid E protein aggregation, a GST fusion protein was prepared. Griffin et al. [13] and Melton et al. [17] reported that the expression of GST-tagged viroporin did not influence the ion channel activity of viroporin in E. coli and mammalian cells. Cell growth was significantly inhibited in E. coli cells transformed with pDEST15 + KU2E and pDEST15 + 79-1146E from 2 hours after induction, which suggests that the FIPV E protein expressed on the E. coli cell surface functioned as a viroporin. The movement of substances in the bacterial cell membrane may have been altered, and intracellular substances essential for the survival of E. coli cells may have exited the cells. A significant elevation in \u03b2-galactosidase activity levels was noted 24 and 48 hours after the induction in E. coli cells transformed with pDEST15 + KU2E and pDEST15 + 79-1146E, respectively. The FIPV E protein was assumed to be expressed on the E. coli surface and to have increased the cell surface permeability, which promoted the incorporation of ONPG into the cells and the reaction of intracellular \u03b2-galactosidase with ONPG. Intracellular \u03b2-galactosidase may also have exited the cells and reacted with extracellular ONPG. These phenomena have also been reported in E. coli cells expressing the SARS-CoV E protein and influenza virus M2 protein [5, 12]. These findings strongly suggest that the FIPV E protein functions as a viroporin.",
