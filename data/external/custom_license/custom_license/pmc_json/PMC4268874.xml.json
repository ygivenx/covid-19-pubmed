FAN1 is thought to be recruited to ICLs via its interaction with the monoubiquitinated form of the FANCI-FANCD2 complex, and, accordingly, disruption of the nuclease activity of FAN1 sensitizes cells to ICL inducing agents1,2,3,4,5,6. In ICL repair, FAN1 is thought to co-operate with other nucleases to introduce DNA incisions necessary for the efficient unhooking of the ICL1,2,3,4,5,6. Interestingly, FAN1 inactivation can lead to chronic kidney diseases7 and autism/schizophrenia8, linking defective DNA lesion repair with ageing9 and neurological disorders8. Besides its positive role in genome maintenance, FAN1 is also implicated in conferring chemo-resistance in several cancer subtypes10,11, presenting itself as a promising drug target against chemotherapy resistance.",

Here we report three crystal structures of human FAN1 bound to 5\u2032 flap DNA and provide biochemical data to elucidate FAN1-DNA substrate interplay. We show that FAN1 forms an asymmetrical dimer to engage the DNA lesion, unwind the flap and incise the unwound DNA intermediate. These results illustrate a highly unusual mode of DNA substrate engagement by FAN1 and provide insights into the critical role of FAN1 in ICL repair and in the prevention of functional decline in different organs. Moreover, our results should facilitate efforts directed at counteracting FAN1-mediated chemotherapy resistance in cancer treatment.",

For crystallization, a DNA substrate with a one-nucleotide (1-nt) 5\u2032 flap flanked by two duplex regions of 10 bp, designated as 5\u2032-flap (10-1-10), was mixed with FAN1373-1,017 carrying an active-site mutation2 D960A to prevent DNA cleavage. The duplex regions contained 1-nt (A or T) overhangs to facilitate crystallization (sequences in Supplementary Table 1). Three different crystal forms of FAN1373-1,017 in complex with the 5\u2032 flap DNA were obtained and they diffracted to resolutions of 2.2 \u00c5 (space group P212121), 3.8 \u00c5 (P31) and 4.2 \u00c5 (P31), respectively. The structures were solved by the single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) method using signals from iodide ions, which were included in the crystallization buffer for the P212121 crystal form, and subsequently by the molecular replacement method for the P31 crystals (Table 1). All three structures were refined to good statistics with excellent geometry (Table 1). Unambiguous electron density in the three crystal forms clearly reveals three distinct DNA conformations in the cleft formed by two FAN1 molecules (Fig. 1a\u2013d and Supplementary Fig. 1).",

The SAP domain consists of a canonical SAP fold and a SAP\u2032 region that connects to the TPR domain. The VRR_NUC domain has similar fold and active site residues as the Achaea Holliday Junction resolvase HJC13, with a C\u03b1 root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 2.2 \u00c5 (Fig. 1f,g). This indicates a similar mechanism of metal-mediated catalysis, even though no metal ion is present here due to the mutation of the metal-coordinating residue D960A. A comparison with the HJC structure suggests that the DNA substrate is oriented at the active site by residues K977/H832 (K48/R25 in HJC) for hydrolysis mediated by residues E815/E834/D960/E975 (E9/S29/D33/E46 in HJC) (Fig. 1g). Consistent with the published data2,3,5,6,14,15, wild-type FAN1373-1,017 exhibits strong endonuclease activity on 5\u2032 flap DNA substrates, generating two endonuclease products at the fourth nt into the duplex region 3\u2032 to the branch site and at the seventh nt into the single-strand (ss) region 5\u2032 to the branch site (Supplementary Fig. 2).

FAN1 alone is monomeric in solution12; however, DNA binding promotes FAN1 dimerization in solution (Supplementary Figs 3d and 8). Consistently, our crystal structures reveal DNA-induced assembly of a \u2018head to tail\u2019 FAN1 dimer via the TPR and NUC domains of the first FAN1 molecule interacting with the SAP domain of a second FAN1 (Fig. 1a\u2013c). FAN1 dimer\u2013DNA interactions are observed in all three crystals, each with a distinct DNA-binding form (Fig. 1a\u2013c). These include (i) a \u2018substrate-scanning form\u2019 (P212121 crystal) wherein the DNA contacts one of the FAN1 molecules in the dimer (Fig. 1a), (ii) a \u2018substrate-latching form\u2019 (P31 crystal 1) wherein the DNA becomes engaged with both FAN1 molecules (Fig. 1b) and (iii) a substrate \u2018unwinding-form\u2019 (P31 crystal 2) where the DNA interacts extensively with both FAN1 molecules and the flap-containing strand is unwound and points towards the active site (Figs 1c and 2a). Within the asymmetric dimer, one FAN1 molecule (denoted as PFAN1) appears to play a primary role in catalysis by engaging the DNA in its active site and the other FAN1 molecule (denoted as AFAN1) plays an auxiliary role, facilitating substrate orientation and flap unwinding. PFAN1 and AFAN1 in all crystal forms are structurally similar, with the C\u03b1 RMSD of 0.8~1 \u00c5. Interestingly, an asymmetric arrangement of two MRE11 molecules has been observed in the structure of the MRE11-DNA complex16 that functions in DNA double-strand break repair and signalling pathways, suggesting a similar strategy is employed for both enzymes to engage the DNA substrate and to prepare it for endonucleolytic incision.",

The helix \u03b19 seems to serve as a central core interaction module, while \u03b17 and \u03b15\u03b21 adjust their positions and orientations to adapt to different dimer orientations (Fig. 2c\u2013e). These interactions are mostly electrostatic in nature, including extensive hydrogen bonds and salt bridges between the two FAN1 molecules. Notably, a more extensive interface is seen in the \u2018unwinding form\u2019 wherein the two FAN1 molecules associate more tightly to unwind the 5\u2032 flap DNA. We carried out mutagenesis to validate the observed dimer interface (Fig. 2f\u2013h and Supplementary Figs 2e and 3). As predicted from the dimer structure, a triple mutation K525E/R526E/K528E on the core \u03b19 interface greatly diminished DNA-induced dimerization as revealed by protein crosslinking using the chemical reagent BMH (bis(maleimido)hexane) (Fig. 2f), size-exclusion chromatography (SEC, Supplementary Fig. 3e) and SEC-multi angle lase light scattering (SEC-MALLS, Fig. 2i). As a consequence, the substrate-binding affinity to 5\u2032 flap DNA (Fig. 2g) and endonuclease activity (Fig. 2h) was substantially reduced by this mutation. Surprisingly, the mutant exhibited similar dsDNA exonuclease activity as that of the wild-type enzyme (Supplementary Fig. 4), suggesting that DNA-induced dimerization endows FAN1 with 5\u2032 flap-structure specific endonuclease activity, while the exonuclease activity may not require dimerization. Interestingly, the mutation R982E on the PVRR NUC side of the interface had no effect on DNA-induced FAN1 dimerization (Fig. 2f) and 5\u2032 flap DNA-binding capacity (Fig. 2g), but showed a slightly different binding pattern with 5\u2032 flap DNA (Fig. 2g). It almost completely ablated both endonuclease and exonuclease activities (Fig. 2h and Supplementary Fig. 4). This indicates that R982E may perturb the dimerization conformation leading to catalytically unproductive DNA binding.",

The PSAP surface facing the catalytic site constitutes the major DNA-binding site that recognizes the sugar-phosphate backbone of the duplex region downstream of the 5\u2032 flap (denoted as PDuplex). This surface is the most positively charged and conserved region of FAN1 (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 6a). The binding is achieved through extensive electrostatic attraction and hydrogen bonding interactions (Fig. 3b). This PSAP-DNA interaction locates the 5\u2032 flap site at the tip of the PSAP domain (Figs 1a\u2013c and 3b). Interestingly, the DNA in the \u2018substrate-scanning\u2019 form is in a reversed orientation and consequently directs the 5\u2032 flap away from the VRR_NUC active site (Fig. 1a). This suggests that DNA may bind in both orientations but only the correct one can lead to substrate latching and unwinding for subsequent incision.",

The observed \u2018unwinding-form\u2019 likely represents a state with partially unwound DNA substrate, as the ssDNA region does not reach the active site for hydrolysis. Further unwinding towards the active site is needed to enable the incision at the previously reported incision point 4 nt downstream of the flap3. In the current crystal form, the side chains of AN452 from \u03b13 and AS460 from \u03b15\u03b21 and the backbone carbonyl of PP979 provide three hydrogen bonds to the backbone of the ssDNA, while PL811 forms stacking interaction with a ribose ring. The compound mutation N452D/S460D/L811D led to substantially impaired nuclease activity (Fig. 3f) while preserving near-wild type binding affinity to 5\u2032 flap DNA (Fig. 3e). This is consistent with the important role of these residues in guiding the ssDNA region to the active site in PVRR_NUC. The energy needed to unwind the duplex region may be generated by the extra interface of both the AFAN1-DNA interaction and the FAN1 dimerization (additional area of 1,200 \u00c52) as a result of the change from the \u2018latching form\u2019 to the \u2018unwinding form\u2019.",

A single ICL at the branch point will prevent the unwinding of the duplex downstream of the 5\u2032 flap, and it also abrogated FAN1 endonuclease cleavage (Fig. 4a). To determine how many base pairs must be unwound to allow FAN1 cleavage, the ICL was moved 2, 6, 12 or 16 base pairs away from the flap branch point. Strong inhibition of endonucleolytic incision was observed until the ICL was 6\u201312 base pairs or further away from the flap site (Fig. 4b), which is consistent with the flap unwinding observed in our \u2018substrate-unwinding\u2019 structure.",

SLX1, another 5\u2032 flap endonuclease, and FAN1 are thought to play overlapping roles in 5\u2032 flap processing during ICL repair4,18,19. However, while SLX1 cuts the ssDNA flap at the branch point20, FAN1 can create incisions both on the ssDNA flap and within the duplex region downstream (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 2)3,12. This could be explained by the unwinding of duplex DNA followed by incision of the unwound ssDNA (Fig. 4a), as suggested by our structural and biochemical data. FAN1 would mediate DNA incision further away from the ICL (Fig. 4c). The involvement of FAN1 and SLX1 in ICL repair would expand the repair spectrum and properly incise various DNA structures or at different steps of ICL repair. SLX1 has been proposed to play a prominent role in ICL unhooking18, while FAN1 may be more involved in the homologous recombination reaction during ICL repair1,18,21.",

In particular, the core \u03b19 helix (bearing residues K525, R526 and K528), essential for dimerization and nuclease activity in human FAN1, is substantially shorter or absent in lower species (Supplementary Figs 6b,c and 7). This suggests that bacterial FAN1 orthologues may use a different mechanism for DNA binding without protein dimerization. This difference may be due to the fact that eukaryotic FAN1 has evolved to work with other cellular factors, as it is recruited to ICL sites via the monoubiquitinated FANCI/D2 complex1,2,3,4,5,6. Moreover, the FANCI/D2 complex has been shown to interact with branched DNA mainly on the exposed positively charged surface of the protein complex22. Our structures reveal that human FAN1 also engages DNA in a relatively open conformation that would allow access by other binding partners. This lends support to the potential simultaneous and collaborative binding of FAN1 and FANCI/D2 to a stalled replication fork during its repair, as proposed previously2,3,4. The FANCI/D2-dependent ICL repair pathway is absent in bacteria, and different catalytic properties for bacterial and human FAN1 have indeed been reported recently12.",

In this regard, FAN1 could help ensure organ health by minimizing the harmful effects of genotoxins to which the kidney is exposed and of potential ICL inducers in embryonic neural tissues during the period of rapid genome replication23. The elucidation of the human FAN1-DNA structure allows us to assess the existing disease-associated FAN1 variants7,8 via structural mapping (Fig. 4d). Mutations of active site residues (D960 (refs 1, 2, 7), K977 (refs 2, 24), D981 (ref. 3), R982 (ref. 3), and E975 (ref. 24)) are expected to abrogate the nuclease activity, while mutations of residues located in the interior of FAN1 (G937 (ref. 7), Q929 (ref. 7), P867 (ref. 8), P654 (ref. 8), R658 (ref. 7) and C871 (ref. 7)) could affect protein folding and thus disrupt the structural integrity of FAN1. Moreover, mutations of residues located on the protein dimerization (L477 (ref. 5), E437 (ref. 8) and R982 (ref. 3)) and DNA binding (E437 (ref. 8), L395 (ref. 8), R706 (ref. 8) and L477 (ref. 5)) interfaces likely perturb the dimer structure and impair the DNA-binding activity of FAN1. FAN1 expression has been found to correlate with treatment outcome in breast and ovarian cancers, with increased FAN1 expression leading to a poorer prognosis11. In contrast, suppressed FAN1 recruitment to DNA lesions may account for the enhanced response to ICL-inducing chemotherapy drugs in lung cancer10. In these regards, FAN1 is a promising target for improving chemotherapy efficacy. Results from our study establish a structural and biochemical basis for understanding human disorders caused by FAN1 deficiency and for the potential design of new anticancer treatments targeting FAN1.",

A thorough inspection of the diffraction data revealed that both crystals were twinned, with twinning fractions ~0.4 (Table 1). Both the conventional twinning test, such as cumulative intensity distribution, the L test38 and the maximum likelihood method implemented in Phenix. Xtriage31 clearly revealed twinning with the twining operator \u2018h,-h-k,-l\u2019 (Supplementary Fig. 8). Each crystal form contained two FAN1 molecules and one DNA in the asymmetric unit and the structures were solved by molecular replacement in Phenix, using the FAN1 model obtained in the P212121 crystal and ideal B-DNA models. After successful amplitude-based twin refinement in Refmac537, unbiased difference electron density for the ssDNA region appeared in the \u2018substrate-unwinding\u2019 form before the inclusion of the ssDNA model (Fig. 1e). Iterative model rebuilding in Coot and refinement in Refmac5 produced the final models of R/Rfree=24.8/28.3% for the \u2018substrate-unwinding\u2019 form (Ramachandran statistics: 94.0% favoured,4.3% allowed, 1.7% outliers) and R/Rfree=23.5/28.8% for the \u2018substrate-latching\u2019 form (Ramachandran statistics: 96.0% favoured, 3.0% allowed, 1.0% outliers).",
