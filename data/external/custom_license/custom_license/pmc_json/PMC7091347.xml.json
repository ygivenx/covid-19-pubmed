The energy originating from this oxidation is quantitatively important as it provide up to 40% of overall need. In patients suffering from advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD), Carnitine has an additional role \u2013 lowering the levels of acyl-CoA, which is elevated in these patients and is toxic to many other enzymes. In CKD patients the level of Carnitine in low due to its decreased intake, absorption and biosynthesis. Objectives: we aim to establish a novel rat model to CKD that will enable us to explore whether chronic administration of Carnitine inhibits the development of kidney failure, and affect the metabolic and behavioral CKD complications. Methods: Wistar male rats were randomly allocated to 4 groups: Sham operated; Sham operated + Carnitine; 5/6 nephrectomy (Nx); 5/6 nephrectomy + Carnitine (Nx \u2013Carnitine). Creatinine and blood-urea-nitrogen (BUN) levels as well as qualitative and quantitative morphological analysis were performed to assess kidney function. Moreover, we investigated various behavioral effects of Carnitine, including food and fluids intake, anhedonia (sucrose preference test) and learning (two way shuttle task) performance.",

Nearly all circuits are composed of a rich repertoire of distinct subpopulations which presumably determines their exact function. Furthermore, neuronal circuits are dynamic as they continuously change and adapt to the never ending demands of the external world. In order to understand the long term plastic changes that neuronal circuits undergo it is useful to develop ways to follow the same networks over time, preferably one component at a time. Here, we developed a novel chronic window preparation in the mouse olfactory bulb (OB), a circuit with unique form of plasticity, because a large portion of its inteneurons (INs) is continuously replaced. This preparation allows in-vivo time lapse two-photon imaging for long periods of time (months) in virtually unlimited number of sessions. We present two applications of this preparation for studying specific subpopulations both anatomically and functionally. Anatomically, we studied the turnover of a distinct subpopulation in the OB - the dopaminergic periglomerular neurons (DA-PGNs). DA-PGNs were rendered fluorescent in a transgenic mouse strain expressing GFP exclusively in DA neurons. We repeatedly imaged the same neurons over months and found a continuous net addition of ~10% in a period of 9 months (n = 501 cells from 4 animals). Physiologically, we present in vivo time lapse imaging experiments of calcium responses to sensory stimuli. Specifically, distinct subpopulations of neurons were transduced with different viral vectors to express the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP3.0. Physiological responses to odors of GCaMP3.0-expressing neurons were tracked from identified local networks over months with high reliability. Our experimental design combines imaging and genetic tools to get a hold of anatomical and physiological information from distinct neuronal subtypes over time.",

This EEG modulation, which has been traditionally labeled mu-suppression, is recorded primarily over the sensory-motor cortex and reflects motor activity. The specific sensitivity to motor activity and a presumed source in the sensory-motor cortex distinguish the mu rhythms from the parieto-occipital alpha waves. Nevertheless, since both rhythms share the same frequency range and, at rest, this frequency dominates the EEG across most scalp sites, disentangling mu rhythms from alpha is not trivial. This endeavor is further complicated by the evident sensitivity of alpha to the level of visual attention allocated to processing. This factor might be easily confounded with the perceptual aspects of motor manipulation. Indeed, although mu suppression is expected primarily at fronto central sites, similar (and sometime even larger) EEG modulation can be recorded from traditional alpha-dominated locations at parieto-occipital sites. In the present study we applied two analytic algorithms, Parallel Analysis of Factors (PARAFAC) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), aimed at separating mu from alpha EEG manifestations, and compared their outcome. These algorithms were applied to data recorded while 24 observers either grasp an object repeatedly or watch a video of a hand grasping different objects. A video of a rolling ball was used as baseline. We will present the results of the two algorithms and discuss the implementation of these methods.",

Hasher and Zacks (1988) suggested that age-related impairments result from weakening of inhibitory processes with aging.

In this task participants are presented with a blue or red color patch and asked to press a left or right key according to the color (e.g., press left key for red). Presenting the color patch to the left or right of the center of the computer screen creates congruent (e.g., red on the left) or incongruent (e.g., red on the right) conditions. Participants commonly respond slower to incongruent than to congruent trials (i.e., the Simon effect). This task was generally found to involve activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the anterior cingulated cortex (ACC). In a series of 3 experiments, behavioral and fMRI studies were carried out using a Simon task with a neutral condition and inter-trial interval (ITI) jitter. The behavioral results showed a larger Simon effect and interference component for old compared with young adults, and sequential analyses revealed different patterns of control recruitment between groups. Primary imaging data showed different error monitoring processes between young and old adults.

Most studies dealing with the effects of stress on neural plasticity focused on synaptic plasticity and long-term potentiation (LTP) of principle cells. However, following stress, modifications can also take place at the level of complex interactions with interneurons, i.e. at the local circuit level. In the present study, we set out to examine the possible impact of re-exposure to the context of a traumatic experience (i.e. underwater trauma) on the plasticity of the principle cells but also on local circuit activity within the dentate gyrus (DG). To analyze the effects of re- exposure to stress, rats were first exposed to underwater trauma and 24 hrs later were re-exposed to its context. Immediately following context re-exposure, rats were anesthetized and DG responses to perforant path stimulation were recorded. Two protocols, Frequency-dependent inhibition (FDI) and paired-pulse inhibition (PPI) were employed to reflect the activity of GABAergic interneurons in the DG. Measuring both population spike amplitude and field-EPSP, all groups showed similar input-output and baseline responses. Rats that had been exposed to underwater trauma and had been re-exposed to its context 24 hr. later showed significantly higher inhibition in both PPI and FDI protocols compared to control rats. Additionally, compared to control rats, traumatized rats showed reduced level of dentate gyrus LTP. Furthermore, compared to control rats, rats that had been exposed to underwater trauma and had been re-exposed to its context 24 hr. later showed increased anxiety behavior in the elevated plus maze and in the open field tests. Taken together, these findings indicate that the re-exposure to a contextual reminder of a trauma affects not only aspects of plasticity of principle cells, but also aspects of local circuit activity in the DG. These alterations may underlie some of the behavioral consequences of the traumatic experience.",

Genomic instability associated with hyperploidy, however, can also lead to developmental abnormalities and decreased cellular fitness. In the normal human brain, the number of hyperploid neurons, amounts to about 10%. In Alzheimer\u00b4s disease (AD), however, this number is more than doubled. Hyperploid neurons are increased already at preclinical stages of AD and are selectively affected by cell death during progression of the disease. These findings show that neuronal hyperploidy in AD is associated with a decreased viability. Hyperploidy of neurons, thus, represents a direct molecular signature of cells prone to death in AD. This adds hyperploidy to the list of critical molecular events that are shared between neurodegneration and malignant cell transformation. Irrespectively of whether hyperploidy results from a lack of aneuploidy clearance during brain development or an aberrant attempt of cell cycle re-entry and DNA replication in the adult, it directs our attention to a failure of neuronal differentiation as the critical pathogenetic event and potential therapeutic target in neurodegeneration.",

It is also considered an accessible and less immunogenic source for mesenchymal, unrestricted somatic and other pluri/multipotent stem cells. We isolated a unique population of progenitors from the CB, using their collagen adherent properties and positive expression of alpha1 and alpha2 collagen-receptors. Microarray gene expression analysis indicates that the cells are negative for common hematopoietic markers and positive for common mesenchymal markers, supporting their mesenchymal or unrestricted origin. Our approach to induce differentiation towards a neuronal phenotype was based on supplementation of growth factors, mainly of nerve growth factor and interferon-gamma. The cells differentiation was evaluated by the activation of MAPK signaling and by the expression of a wide range of neural markers. The neuroprotective potential of CB-progenitors was evaluated using a neuronal ischemic in vitro model adjusted to measure cell-cell induced neuroprotection. We found these cells to confer neuroprotection by a mechanism involving the release of antioxidants, the decrease in numbers of free radicals in the injured neuron and the accumulation of neurotrophic and angiogenic growth factors in the media, supporting a \"bystander\" neuroprotective strategy. The ability of CB-derived progenitors to confer protection against in vivo neurological deficits caused by brain ischemia was evaluated using a closed head injury model in mice. We demonstrated that upon intra-cerebral administration of CB cells, many of the physical and behavioral deficits associated with this disease were ameliorated. The improvement in the neurological score was achieved under cell administration of 1 and 7 days after injury. These results indicate a wide range for intervention and emphasize the clinical relevance of the use of CB cells as a potential therapeutic approach for brain ischemic injuries.",

However, the neural circuit mediating COA is less well known. In this study we wanted to examine (1) the role of the mPFC in the extinction of COA and (2) to examine whether there is a differential involvement of the mPFC in recent as compared to remote memory of COA. To test these questions we evaluated the effects of reversible inactivation of the mPFC on extinction of COA. Lidocaine was microinfused into the mPFC immediately after the first retrieval test on either 2 days (recent memory) or 28 days (remote memory) after COA acquisition. Our results show that (1) odor conditioning can be reliably established in the laboratory, (2) the mPFC and mainly its subregion the infralimbic cortex has a role in the extinction of recent memory of COA, since inactivation of the IL immediately after the first extinction training 2 days after COA acquisition impairs extinction and (3) the IL does not seem to have a role in the extinction of remote memory of COA.

Work in this direction has benefited much from the use of insect neuronal cultures. Insect neurons are relatively large and can be plated in low density. Using specially prepared culturing substrates and time lapse observation, we were able to explore various developmental processes in networks composed of cultured locust neurons. Utilized substrates included clean quartz surfaces applied with isolated anchoring sites consisting of carbon nanotube (CNT) islands to which the cells and neurites could mechanically attach. We investigated and validated the important role of mechanical tension in determining the final morphology of neuronal networks and suggest an equally important effect on neuronal and network function. This is an exciting field of multidisciplinary study that encompasses biology, physics and engineering and enjoys both conceptual and technical recent advances in all of these.

Nevertheless, the cognitive underpinnings of these elementary skills in the preschool period remain poorly understood. Our goal was to test, in kindergarten children (n = 43), the Anchoring Deficit Hypothesis which suggests that reading development may be impaired due to reduced sensitivity to contextual cues (Ahissar, Lubin, Putter-Katz and Banai, 2006). To that end, we asked whether the availability of contextual cues contributes to frequency discrimination, verbal memory and rapid naming, and whether there is an association between sensitivity to contextual cues and early reading skills. Sensitivity to contextual cues was determined by assessing frequency discrimination, rapid naming and verbal memory span in two conditions varying in stimulus set size and thus providing different amounts of contextual cues. Early reading acquisition was assessed with phonological awareness and letter identification tasks. We found that in the small-set conditions frequency discrimination was better, naming speed was faster and memory spans were longer relative to the large-set conditions, suggesting that across domains kindergarten children can use contextual information to facilitate performance. Furthermore, children with better contextual facilitation (based on the rapid naming tasks) identified more letters and had longer memory spans compared to the children with poorer contextual facilitation, suggesting that anchoring is related not only to reading difficulties in older children but also to emerging reading skills. Further longitudinal studies are required to determine if preschool children's anchoring predicts reading acquisition in school.",

Despite its growing popularity, little is known about the effect it exerts on the underlying neurons of the central nervous system (CNS). Unraveling the mechanism of TMS effects requires a multi-level approach combining multidisciplinary studies on the biophysical, cellular neurophysiology, system neurophysiology and cognitive neuroscience levels. As part of such a combined effort we set out to investigate this question by combining magnetic stimulation using our novel magnetic mini-coil with simultaneous recordings of neuronal activity in the behaving primate. This mini-coil fits into a chronic recording chamber and provides focal activation of cortical areas while enabling simultaneous extracellular multi-electrode recordings in multiple brain structures. This allows, for the first time, to record in multiple areas of the CNS during magnetic stimulation. This configuration enabled us to study the temporal and spatial activation patterns of cortical neurons directly activated by the induced electrical field and of sub-cortical neurons activated synaptically by the cortical neurons. The study was performed in two states: normal and parkinsonian (MPTP treated). The study demonstrates that equivalent modulation of cortical activity in the two states leads to drastically different activation patterns of basal ganglia neurons. The large stereotypic indirect modulation of the sub-cortical targets occurring in the parkinsonian state was completely missing in the normal state. This modification of the descending cortical activity transmission led to changes in both the single neuron level and the neural network level. These results emphasize the need to customize both scientific and clinical stimulation protocols to the underlying brain state.",

Almost any injury to the brain, including traumatic, ischemic and infectious injuries may lead to epilepsy. These insults are also associated with blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction. Recent studies pointed injury to the vascular bed and specifically to dysfunction of the BBB as key mechanisms sufficient to induce transcriptional program, eventually leading to epileptogenesis. Once the BBB is compromised, albumin diffuses into the brain, binds to TGF-beta receptor II and activates the TGF-beta signaling pathway, leading to atsrocytic dysfunction and inflammatory response. Losartan is an angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) blocker and recently shown to antagonize TGF-beta signaling in-vivo. We thus challenged the hypothesis that administrating losartan to BBB compromised rats will prevent epileptogenesis. Rats were treated with focal neocortical application of the bile salt sodium deoxycholate (n = 8) or serum albumin (n = 15) in the presence or absence of losartan (n = 5, 13). A sham-treated group served as control (n = 18). An EEG-telemetric system was used to continuously monitor brain activity and seizures 4-5 weeks after treatment. We show that losartan prevents albumin-induced smad-2 phosphorylation and partly blocks the consecutive transcriptional response. Furthermore, losartan reduces the extravasation of Evans blue-albumin complexes into the brain, suggesting that TGF-beta signaling is involved in BBB dysfunction and repair mechanisms. BBB opening and exposure of the brain neuropil to albumin induce spontaneous \"seizure like activity\" in 80% of the DOC and in all albumin treated rats. Losartan-treated showed a significant reduction in both the frequency and duration of seizure like events. This work strongly supports the role of BBB dysfunction in epileptogenesis and highlights the potential role of TGF-beta signaling inhibitors in the prevention of injury-induced epilepsy.",

However, some frequently suffer from long-lasting cognitive, behavioral and emotional difficulties. As yet, there is no effective treatment or cure for patients with mTBI. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) is a cytokine that is fundamental in the systemic inflammation process. TNF-a levels increase after mTBI, which may cause and initiate secondary damage to the brain tissue and apoptotic cascade at the cells. Thio analogs of N-a-phthalimidoglutarimide, which is the backbone of the well-known drug, thalidomide, have been synthesized to reduce the initial synthesis of TNF-a. The present study was aimed to evaluate the effect of the potent experimental drug, 3,6'-dithiothalidomide on the recovery from mTBI. We used a closed head weight-drop experimental model to induce minimal brain injury in mice. Mice received an injection of either vehicle or 3,6'-dithiothalidomide 1 hour prior to injury and 1 or 12 hours post injury in different 2 doses. 72 hours and 7 days post injury; mice were assessed in 3 behavioral paradigms. Mice exhibited lower learning ability following mTBI in the Y- maze and in the Novel object recognition test. These differences reach significance only at 7 days post injury. These impairments were reversed in mice that received 3,6'-dithiothalidomide prior or after mTBI injury. Lower learning ability was seen in the Passive avoidance test, that did not reach significance. Together, these results suggests that 3,6'-dithiothalidomide may act as a neuroprotective drug to minimize impairments associated with mTBI.",

Neurotransmitter release is accomplished by Ca2+-dependent exocytosis which characterizes also slow release. How, then, can the Ca2+-dependent exocytosis be so fast and precise in nerve terminals? The prevailing dogma is that precision is achieved by the action-potential inducing fast Ca2+ influx. However, temporal control of acetylcholine release is achieved by depolarization relieving a tonic block of release imposed by presynaptic M2-muscarinic receptor (M2R). To date, the molecular mechanism that underlies release control is unknown. Recently it was discovered that M2R, like voltage-gated channels, displays depolarization-induced rapid charge movement, offering an unexpected avenue to seek for the molecular mechanism by which voltage-sensitive M2R controls release. Here we show, for the first time, a novel mechanism by which the action-potential triggers release. Using a fast application system we show that manipulating charge movement in the M2R instantaneously affects the amount of acetylcholine release and its time of initiation. Our findings call for a revision in the long held consensus. Accordingly, physiological neurotransmitter release involves two distinct processes, both induced by the action-potential, but each is handled by different proteins. One process is activation by Ca2+, as is well established, of the exocytotic machinery, presumably by Ca+2 acting on synaptotagmin. The second process, which is somewhat slower, is removal of a \"brake\" from the exocytotic machinery. This is accomplished by charge movement in the M2R. Our findings also demonstrate a novel extremely fast mechanism for GPCRs-mediated signal transduction that does not involve G-protein activation. Charge movement in GPCRs is expected to induce signal transduction also in other systems where rapidity and precision is essential.",

This model incorporates adverse consequences of drug seeking and taking by presenting an electrical barrier to the reinforcing lever, which leads to self-abstinence from drug seeking. The objective of the present study was to evaluate whether presentation of discrete cues that have been associated with cocaine or sucrose self-administration, can induce relapse to cocaine or sucrose seeking and whether home-cage withdrawal can facilitate cue-induced relapse in this model. We have utilized the 'conflict model' to test cue-induced relapse after 1 or 14 days of home-cage withdrawal, in groups of rats that were previously trained to self-administer cocaine or sucrose. We found that although similar shock intensity was required to suppress sucrose or cocaine self-administration, subjects exhibited significantly lower response to sucrose-, as compared to cocaine-, associated cues, during the relapse test. Importantly, cue-induced relapse to cocaine was attenuated following withdrawal, both when tested under the abstinence threshold (i.e. the current intensity in which subject stopped responding for the reinforcer), or at 85% of this threshold. Therefore, the incorporation of aversive consequence in the self-administration model enables detection of a compulsive component which is unique to drug reinforcers. Moreover, the aversive consequence seems to dominate the behavioral outcome following drug withdrawal.",

Schizophrenia is diagnosed on the basis of symptom profiles. The positive symptoms are characterized by a constellation of symptoms of psychosis, such as abnormalities in the perception or expression of reality. The negative symptoms may include affective flattening, avolition, anhedonia and cognitive deficits. Among different hypotheses regarding the etiology of the disease, it is generally hypothesized that susceptible genes combine with each other and/or with environmental stimuli to produce the variance in schizophrenia clinical manifestations. The ubiquitous transcription factor Sp1 was shown to be involved in the regulation of the transcription of many genes implicated in schizophrenia. Early interference with sp1 activity serves as predisposing to pre puberty chronic stress. Our aim is to examine the chronic stress effect on top of early interference with sp1 activity on schizophrenia relevant behavioral-like and hormonal symptoms in schizophrenia.",

This low amplification is in contrast to rod phototransduction in vision, the best-quantified G-protein signaling pathway, where each photoisomerized rhodopsin molecule is well known to produce substantial amplification by activating many G-protein, and hence effector-enzyme, molecules. We have now carried out similar experiments on mouse ORNs, which offer, additionally, the advantage of genetics. Indeed, we found the same low probability of transduction, based on the unitary olfactory response having a fairly constant amplitude and similar kinetics across different odorants and randomly encountered ORNs. Also consistent with our picture, the unitary response of G\u03b1olf+/- ORNs was similar to WT in amplitude, although their G\u03b1olf-protein expression was only half of WT. Finally, from the action-potential firing, we estimated that \u226419 odorant-binding events successfully triggering transduction in a WT mouse ORN will lead to signaling to the brain.",

The encoding of complex experiences that require binding of information over time may involve more elaborate processes that only come into play after an ongoing episode is perceived as a cohesive event. In order to examine whether offline encoding processes play a role in the registration of real-life-like experiences to memory, we examined brain activity time-locked to the offset of short narrative movie clips. We found such activity to be correlated with subsequent memory performance in a set of regions including the hippocampus and caudate nucleus.

In the mouse, as in other species, social communication relies on the discharge and detection of specific chemical cues, the pheromones. The Trpc2 channel is exclusively expressed in the vomeronasal organ (VNO), which is thought to mediate social behaviors elicited by pheromonal cues suggesting a direct role of the channel in the pheromone-evoked response. Trpc2-/- fails to display the pheromone-evoked aggression toward male intruders which is normally observed in wild-type males. Moreover, they display courtship and mounting behavior indiscriminately toward both males and females. These findings raise the inevitable question: can Trpc2-/- sex-discriminate? In order to illuminate this issue, we apply the conditioned olfactory aversion (COA) paradigm. Similar to conditioned taste aversion (CTA), the subjects learn to associate particular smell, in this case, female urine (the conditioned stimulus, CS) with delayed lithium-chloride (LiCl) toxicosis (an unconditioned stimulus, UCS) to yield olfactory aversion. We postulate that a non-discriminating Trpc2-/- mouse will not learn the association or will even generalize the aversion to male urine as well. First, we decided to examine whether the COA paradigm applies to C57BL/6 J mice. Preliminary results show that mice which received LiCl injection immediately after a five-minute exposure to female urine, acquired an aversion to this smell but not to male urine. Remarkably, these results indicate that although innate factors are strongly involved, male selectiveness toward female odor is also influenced by past experience. In the future, we intend to apply the COA paradigm on mice deficient in Trpc2 in order to address this question and by doing so, gain a better understanding of the functional role of Trpc2 in the vomeronasal pathway.",

Our whole genome microarray studies suggest modified alternative splicing of brain and leukocyte mRNA transcripts as an underlying mechanism. In the AD brain, we observed massive changes in alternative splicing profiles. When experimentally tested in primary neuronal cells, parallel manipulations caused synapse loss, preventable by cholinergic stimulation. In lentivirus-injected mice, such changes led to learning and memory impairments yet were independent of amyloid or Tau phenotypes. Leukocytes from PD patients compared to healthy controls, showed stimulus-induced changes in mRNA transcripts, with distinct alternative splicing profiles after sub-thalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) neurosurgery and post-surgery with or without electrical stimulus (ON-and OFF-stimulus). The majority of these changes was reversed following both stimulation and reversed again 1 hour OFF-stimulus, with the extent of changes correlated to the neurological efficacy of the DBS neurosurgery. Correspondingly, molecular signatures of 29 transcripts discriminated controls from PD patients, pre- from post-surgery patients and ON-from OFF-stimulus conditions; and 6 out of these transcripts also discriminated between controls and patients with early PD or other neurological diseases in an independent 3' leukocytes microarray dataset. Alternative splicing impairments thus emerge as a key mechanism in both AD and PD, suggesting new surrogate markers for early blood test diagnostics and proposing novel target transcripts for intervention early in the process of neuroinflammation-associated and/or DBS-treatable neurological diseases.",

Recent PET studies have revealed that the regional distribution pattern of aromatase in the human brain is unique, with the highest levels found in the thalamus. In contrast, primate and rodent brain studies show low levels in thalamus and high levels in amygdala and preoptic area. To gain an insight into the possible functions subserved by estrogen synthesis in the human thalamus, we have examined the relationship between aromatase availability in the thalamus and amygdala and neuro-psychological assessment of higher brain function in healthy volunteers. Sixteen healthy volunteers (8 men and 8 women) were the California verbal learning test (CVLT) prior to a PET scan with the aromatase inhibitor [11 C]vorozole. Blood input data and brain regional time activity curves were collected from each subject and analyzed using the 2 compartment model to obtain the total distribution volume (VT) values in thalamus and amygdala, which where then correlated with CVLT performance traits control/constraint in the whole group as well as in men and women separately. Verbal learning and memory (CVLT1-5) showed a statistically significant negative correlation with thalamic VT (R = -0.546, p < 0.03). However, this correlation originated exclusively from the women (R = -0.73, p < 0.04); with no apparent contribution from the men (R = -0.13, p = 0.75). Conversely, VT in amygdala was significantly and negatively correlated with CVLT performance in men (R = -0.76, p < 0.02) but not in women (R = -0.11, p = 0.78). These results suggest that estrogen synthesis in the human brain modulates cognitive function in a sex- and region specific manner.",

He showed that the period gene was a key regulator of the circadian clock, which was found to have a role in regulating sleep in mammals.

The worm develops through four larval stages before it reaches adulthood. At the end of each of these stages it exhibits a quiescent behavior called lethargus. David Raizen et al. recently demonstrated that lethargus bears behavioral similarities to sleep, such as reversibility (the worms \"wake up\"), sensory gating (an elevated threshold for responding to sensory stimuli) and homeostatic control (following deprivation, lethargus is resumed faster and \"deeper\"). Curiously, lethargus is also phase-locked with cycles in the expression of the worm's period homologous gene. Moreover, EGF and cAMP signaling both appear to have roles in regulating lethargus that resemble their regulation of similar behaviors in flies and mammals.

Our aim was to test the extent to which similarity relations between faces, and thus the structure of the space, remained unchanged across identity-preserving transformations such as changes in viewpoint and lighting. In two experiments, perceived similarity was rated within different variants of a set of faces, differing either in illumination (Experiment 1) or viewpoint (Experiment 2). Based on these ratings, a separate face-space configuration was constructed for each variant using multidimensional scaling, so that each configuration represented the same faces under a different transformation. Procrustean analysis revealed that these configurations were highly correspondent in structure. In addition, the pattern of correspondence strongly correlated with performance in a sequential matching task: the better the matching of faces under two transformations was, the more correspondent were the configurations representing these transformations. While such correspondence of configurations serves as a face-space correlate of identity-invariant representation, we further present a theoretical model postulating a causal link between the structure of face-space and identity invariance. This model suggests that to attain an identity-invariant representation, it is possible that faces of the same identity only share their similarity-pattern relative to other faces, perhaps rendering unnecessary a direct comparison of faces under different transformations based on inherent invariant features.",

Here we attempt to address this issue directly by measuring the rate constant of dissociation (koff) of acetylcholine (ACh) from the voltage-sensitive m2R. We do so by using direct measurements of the dissociation of [3 H]ACh from m2R-expressing Xenopus oocytes, and by indirect measurements of the deactivation rate of m2R activated GIRK currents.

In contrast to the excellent results of well established treatment studies in pediatric patients suffering from leukaemia the cure rates of children with malignant brain tumors remained low. That is why the development of new antitumor strategies has become a major issue in experimental neurology. Class-3 semaphorins have been first identified as axon guidance factors and during the last years it was found that some are able to inhibit the angiogenesis and as a result they are candidates for the inhibition of tumor development. Goal of the project was to determine if class-3 semaphorins can be used for the treatment of brain cancer. Therefore class-3 semaphorin overexpressing U87MG glioma cells were implanted in the brain cortex of mice. We found that the semaphorin expression completely inhibits the development of tumors from these cells. The tumor inhibition was correlated with a dramatic effect on the survival of the mice, as in the groups after the implantation of semaphorin expressing cells was a very substantial increase in survival. Sadly, semaphorins do not pass the blood-brain-barrier efficiently so it is not possible to inject them intravenously for a treatment. Additionally the expression of recombinant semaphorin3D changes the migration and cell adhesion of those cells in comparison to control U87MG cells. This may be an explanation for the reduced invasiveness in the brain of the mice. Our main focus is now to circumvent the blood-brain-barrier to deliver semaphorins to the brain in order to treat cancer.",

Interestingly, bodies induce behavioral effects that are similar to faces and typically associated with holistic processing, such as impaired discrimination for inverted stimuli (i.e. body inversion effect). Therefore, it has been suggested that bodies, like faces, are processed holistically. Evidence for holistic body representation includes a behavioral Whole-Part effect, and a step-like response of the fusiform body area to large vs. small body parts. However, no study has directly examined whether body-selective mechanisms indeed prefer a whole body over the sum of its parts. Here we used fMRI to determine whether body-selective areas in occipito-temporal cortex discriminate intact vs. scrambled body configurations. Subjects were presented with blocks of intact (faceless) or headless bodies, in either whole or scrambled (part-based) configuration. For each subject we defined face, body and object-selective areas with a separate functional localizer scan. Body-selective areas showed highest response to whole intact bodies relative to headless intact or scrambled bodies. The response to scrambled bodies was similar regardless of the presence of the head. Face areas showed higher response to whole than headless bodies for both intact and scrambled bodies. In contrast to body and face areas showing higher response to whole than scrambled bodies, object-selective areas showed the opposite effect of higher response to scrambled than whole bodies. These findings suggest that holistic representation of human bodies uniquely exists in body-selective areas, but not in object general areas. The response of face-selective areas was more influenced by the presence of the head and may reflect mechanisms of face imagery, which are more likely to be generated by a whole intact faceless body than by headless or scrambled body.",

Animal and human studies suggest that these patterns of activation reflect individual differences in asymmetry in dopaminergic signaling, which modulates aspects of appetitive and aversive behaviors. Orienting bias is known to reflect dopaminergic asymmetry in animals, and possibly in humans too. The present study investigated the association of approach and avoidance tendencies (measured by self report as well as behavioral task) with orienting bias and the COMT Val158Met polymorphism, in healthy individuals. 32 participants completed the BIS/BAS questionnaire and a probabilistic classification task, which required them to assign presented stimuli to one of two categories based on positive or negative feedback. They also performed the greyscales task, a reliable test of orienting bias. Carriers of the Met allele tended to rate themselves as having stronger approach (BAS score) relative to avoidance (BIS score) tendencies, whereas the opposite pattern was found for Val homozygotes. Greater rightward orienting bias was associated with better learning from positive reinforcement relative to negative reinforcement. Finally, rightward bias was associated with higher BAS (relative to BIS) scores, whereas the opposite pattern was found for subjects showing a leftward bias. These results support the hypothesis that asymmetric hemispheric activation reflects individual differences in approach and avoidance motivation, suggest a possible role for orienting bias as a neurobehavioral marker for motivational dispositions, and imply an association of the COMT gene with these traits.",

Multiple lines of evidence suggest the involvement of the cortico-basal ganglia loop (CBG) in tic disorders, but the pathophysiology leading to tics is unknown. Theoretical models hypothesized an abnormal \"action selection\" process leading to tic generation in which an aberrant focus of striatal activation causes unwanted inhibition of a group of basal ganglia output neurons, which disinhibits a group of cortical neurons and thus leads to the expression of a tic. In this study, motor tics were induced in behaving monkeys by local microinjections of the GABA-A antagonist bicuculline to the putamen. Tic-related neuronal activity was recorded from multiple nodes along the CBG: motor cortex, putamen, globus pallidus external (GPe) and internal (GPi) segments. We characterized the temporal and spatial distribution of tic-related activity in each area and their relation to the spatial and temporal properties of the tics. While striatal tic-related activity displayed a localized spatial distribution, GPe and GPi responses to tics were detected in a very large fraction of neurons, and were widely spatially distributed in each nucleus. While some neurons along the CBG displayed tic-related activity prior to the tic movement onset, the vast majority of neuronal responses were during or after the tic. Our results indicate that rather than selecting and initiating the abnormal movement the tic-related BG signal may have a more complex role in the modulation, maintenance or control of tics. The abnormal disinhibition from the GPi might be augmenting the tics expression, representing a failure of the behavior learning or control mechanism. The neuronal changes observed during tics in this model may provide valuable insights into the underlying mechanism of tic disorders as well as into basic information processing in the CBG loop",

If a noise-free network is left to evolve on its own, without any sensory input, activity can persist in a given state indefinitely. In practice, activity will drift away from the initial state. The drift is an inevitable consequence of noise and the flatness of the attractor manifold. To maintain its state for times exceeding the synaptic and membrane time-constants, the network must use knowledge of its state in the past, as conveyed by its own spiking activity. Thus we hypothesize a basic relationship between the information conveyed by the action potentials about the network's state, and the drift of the network state. We derive the diffusion coefficient D, a dynamical quantity that quantifies the persistence of the network state for continuous attractor networks of Poisson-spiking neurons. We compute the corresponding Fisher information J conveyed by spikes about the attractor state, which is a static statistical measure of neural coding and has been considered more traditionally in the context of sensory encoding and decoding by downstream neurons. We show that a rigorous inequality relates diffusivity to the Fisher information: 2D \u2265 1/(2\nJ) where is the intrinsic slow time-constant (membrane or synaptic) in the problem. Thus, the statistical bound on estimation in a continuous-attractor network is intimately related to the network's ability to maintain a persistent state. We discuss generalizations to other models of neural firing, and consequences for coding and dynamics in continuous attractor networks.",

Due to compensatory mechanisms people who are blind from birth are not handicapped in spatio-cognitive abilities, nor in the formation of novel spatial maps. Despite the growing volume of studies on brain plasticity and navigation in the early blind (EB), the compensatory neural substrates or the preservation of this function remain unclear. How do EB form maps of their environment? To answer this question my doctoral thesis research exploited a sensory substitution device that could potentially serve EB to negotiate a path through an obstacle course. We demonstrated that despite a reduced right posterior hippocampus, and an atrophied visual system (Ptito et al., 2008) EB not only were able to accomplish this task, but had a better performance than the blindfolded sighted controls. To determine what the neural correlates of navigation in EB are, we devised an fMRI compatible virtual route task conveyed through the tongue. Participants had to learn to navigate the routes and recognize them. We showed that EB use another cortical network involved in cognitive mapping than the sighted when recognizing routes on the tongue. In the future we will continue to explore navigation in the blind using fMRI and virtual environments conveyed through various sensory substitution devices. We have emphasized neural networks connecting parietal and frontal cortices since they are re-enforced in EB. We show that SSD's can be used as a portal to the brain by transferring visual information from the visual environment of participants, allowing the elaboration of strategies to avoid obstacles and move around in their environment.",

Our previous findings that a \"fast\" (0.25-1 Hz) alternating left-right rhythm can be produced in the sacral and rostral lumbar segments of the spinal cord by selective application of the a1-adrenoceptor agonist methoxamine to the sacral segments, suggest that the hindlimb and body stabilizing rhythmogenic networks might be coupled not only in the rostro-caudal, but also in the caudo-rostral direction. Using electrophysiological recordings, surgical manipulations of the spinal cord and confocal imaging, we show that the ability of methoxamine to produce the \"fast\" lumbar rhythm depends on intact connectivity between the thoracolumbar and the first two sacral segments (S1-S2) of the cord. Because the rhythm produced under these conditions (spinal cord transected at the S2/S3 border) persists after surgical removal of the S1-S2 dorsal horn, we suggest that the sacral CPGs activated by methoxamine and the sacral relay neurons required for activation of the rostral lumbar segments, reside mainly within the sacral ventral horn. Lesion studies of the white matter at the lumbosacral junction revealed that the methoxamine induced lumbar rhythm depends on sacral neurons whose axons project rostrally almost only through the ventral funiculi (VF). Fluorescent back loading of cut VF axon bundles, labeled heterogeneous population of sacral neurons mainly within the contralateral laminae VII, VIII and IX of the gray matter. Further studies are required to clarify the roles of the ventral sub-clusters of VF neurons in pattern generation and in caudo-rostral coupling between the sacral and lumbar networks.",

A third of these networks (26 out of 82) displayed spontaneous bursts encompassing the entire neuronal population. The bursts did not depend on the presence of inhibitory neurons or on network size. An 'early to fire' neuron was occasionally identified as the one who started to fire before all other members of the network. Surprisingly, these bursts were still present following the elimination of 'early to fire' neurons, indicating that 'leader neurons' are not indispensable for small scale network bursts. The duration of network bursts was dependent on the depletion of presynaptic resources and not on changes in postsynaptic properties. To conclude, while connectivity determines the ability to ignite widespread network bursts, the availability of presynaptic resources dictates the maintenance of such bursts.",

This cross-modal interaction appears naturally in lactating mother shortly after parturition and is long lasting. Moreover, experience with pups is sufficient to trigger similar plastic changes in the auditory cortex of otherwise na\u00efve females. Independent of cross-modal interaction, maternal experience induced a long lasting increase in representation of distress ultrasonic vocalization in the primary auditory cortex. These findings are in correlation with the pup retrieval performance of female mice. Our work indicates that parenting induces a set of plastic changes acting in concert to retune the primary auditory cortex into novel mode of processing pup distress calls.

The skin is innervated by four pressure-sensitive cells per segment, two ventral and two dorsal domains. Previous studies have shown that cell-cell interactions are critical for the establishment of tile boundaries between adjacent dorsal P (PD) neurons. A different mechanism appears to be required for establishing the boundary between the ventral and dorsal P tiles in each segment. Based on the distribution of the axon guidance factor Netrin in the leech, we hypothesize a role for Netrin in the establishment of the dorso-ventral boundary between P tiles. Netrin is expressed and released by ventral, but not dorsal, longitudinal muscles. The Netrin receptor UNC5 is expressed by the PD but not by the PV cells. We have recently identified a unique domain in the UNC5 leech homologue receptor. Moreover, we have cloned a Netrin receptor of a second type, a leech-DCC. To study the role of Netrin, we use microinjections as well as a pneumatic capillary gene gun that enables accurate manipulations of gene expression at early stages of development. We use RNA-interference (RNAi) and ectopic gene expression techniques to modulate the expression of Netrin and its receptors in selected segments and cells. Both techniques allow us to manipulate one side of a segment keeping the contra-lateral side as internal control. Preliminary results of Netrin-RNAi show significant abnormalities in the local pattern of skin innervation and in the boundary between ventral and dorsal areas. Overexpression of Netrin (using a potent core promoter) in ventral cells, which usually lack Netrin, affect Pv arborization. We therefore conclude that the establishment of the P cells involves both cell-cell interactions and target-derived molecular signals. Future applications towards directing neuronal growth will be discussed.",

Such rule learning is manifested in a dramatic enhancement of learning capability; while learning to discriminate between the first pair of odors required 7-8 days of training, discrimination between subsequent pairs of odors is achieved almost immediately. This remarkable enhancement in learning capability, termed 'rule learning', suggests that profound changes should occur in the relevant brain areas. OD learning is accompanied by a series of wide-spread physiological and morphological synaptic modifications in pyramidal neurons of the piriform cortex (PC). The purpose of the present study was to describe quantitatively the dynamics of modulation of synaptic connectivity during learning in the ascending synaptic inputs to PC. To that end, we used in-vivo recordings of field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSPs) from different location in the PC, throughout the learning period. Recordings were obtained by implanted electrodes: two recording electrodes in anterior PC and two in posterior PC. An electrical stimulation in the olfactory bulb (OB) was delivered before learning for and every day during learning until rule learning was completed. The amplitudes of the fEPSPs response to the direct afferent input (monosynaptic) from the OB was modified gradually during the learning period in an initial amplitude dependent-manner; persistent potentiation was observed only for responses which were smaller than 0.9 mV prior to learning. On the day of rule learning completion, a dramatic reduction of the responses was always apparent. We suggest that transient synaptic plasticity of the ascending OB-PC pathway enables the PC network to enter into a learning mode. The beginning of learning depends on the bottom-up circuit to the point when the input is effective enough to activate intrinsic circuits, which are much less dependent on the environmental inputs.",

The No-reference protocol activated networks of explicit working memory (prefrontal-BA6,44; intra-parietal-BA7) stronger, even though the levels of difficulty were equated across conditions and participants were not aware of any difference between the tasks. To assess the overlap between areas activated for verbal information with a similar contrast, 7 participants were also administered a phonological awareness task, with and without item repetition across blocks. We used the areas activated by the non-verbal contrast as ROIs for the verbal contrast.

While single-unit and local field potential (LFP) studies in monkeys suggest that attention predominantly modulates high-order visual areas, human fMRI studies exhibit strong attentional modulation of early visual cortex. This discrepancy is intriguing because of the tight coupling between the BOLD signal and local field potentials which is typically reported both in human and animal studies. Here we used intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings in epileptic patients and fMRI in healthy volunteers in order to address this issue. The participants were presented with a small object (line drawing of either a face or a house) superimposed on a large object (face or house). In separate blocks the participants were asked to attend the small or the large object while maintaining fixation and performing a target detection task. This paradigm allows simultaneous measurement of both spatial-based attention and object-based attention. Early visual cortex electrodes exhibited mainly spatial-based attention effects. These effects were manifested in changes of the ERP and gamma (30-150 Hz) power. The magnitude of the effect was correlated with the spatial selectivity of each electrode. A sub population of these electrodes showed also attentional modulation of the baseline activity. Electrodes placed over high-order visual areas (e.g. Fusiform Gyrus, FFA) showed robust effects of object-based attention, which were correlated with the selectivity of the electrode to a certain category. In addition, these electrodes showed spatial-based attention effects. Preliminary fMRI results are compatible with these findings and shed light on the coupling between fMRI and electrophysiological data.",

Recently, a second region in the brain, the medial entorhinal cortex, has been hypothesized to be related to spatial perception as well. It contains various types of cells, one of which is grid cells. These are neurons whose firing locations in a walking animal define a periodic triangular array covering the two-dimensional space in which the rat is moving. Grid cells can be used to calculate the position of the rat in the environment, suggesting that they contribute to navigation. Two studies investigating the nature of the map are presented. In the first study, we were interested how complex multi-compartment environments could affect the nature of the grid cell maps. We found that the grids were fragmented; they were \"reset\" when the rat was moving from one compartment to another. Thus the environment is represented by a mosaic of interconnected spatial maps. In a second study, we investigated the connection between the place cells in the hippocampus and the grid cells in the entorhinal cortex. The hippocampus was inactivated transiently, using the GABA-A agonist muscimol and grid cells were recorded simultaneously. Although the grid structure disintegrated, grid cells did not lose their spatial specificity for a very long time. Furthermore, some grid cells turned into head direction cells during inactivation. All in all, it seems that the spatial representation in the brain is performed by multiple dynamic interconnected regions, with a strong feedback component.",

An intriguing and significant source for false recollection is social pressure which leads individuals to change their report of past events to match that reported by others. This phenomenon, dubbed \"memory conformity\" is of considerable personal and social importance and is encountered in a variety of contexts, including social interactions, mass media, and eyewitness testimony. The brain mechanisms mediating socially-induced memory errors are yet unknown. Here, we examined if the neural representation of memories are altered by social influence. Additionally, we differentiate the biological basis of socially induced transient memory errors from socially induced persistent memory errors. Transient errors are induced by normative influences and maintained only as long as the social influence is sustained. Persistent errors are long lasting alterations of memory that persist after the social influence itself ceases. 30 subjects participated in a novel subsequent memory paradigm based on Asch's classic conformity experiments in combination with functional resonance imaging. Our results show that social influence induces high rates of behavioral conformity, resulting in both transient and persistent memory errors. When subjects were presented with false recollections by others, enhanced activation was found in the medial temporal lobe when that information generated long lasting memory errors, but not when the errors were only transient, or when subjects maintained their accurate memories. In frontal areas heightened activation was found when subjects preserved their accurate memories and did not conform to the false information given by others. Connectivity analysis suggests a frontal-MTL network subserves memory conformity and that the amygdala may play an important role in mediating social effects on memory",

In the barn owl, an auditory localization specialist, the main auditory cues are the interaural time difference (ITD) and the interaural level difference (ILD). Is normal experience with the auditory cues essential for the formation of the map? To answer this question, we raised barn owls in continuous omnidirectional broadband acoustic noise that minimized their experience with coherent localization cues, presenting a form of deprivation. The owls were exposed to noise from the age of ~1 week, before hearing onset, until the age of ~2 months, when they normally achieve adult appearance and leave the nest. We then studied the neural representations of ITD and ILD in the auditory map in the optic tectum (the homologue of the mammalian superior colliculus). The data from the noise-reared owls were compared to data from age-matched (juvenile) controls and from adult owls. We found that both ITD and ILD tuning were broader in the noise-reared owls. Furthermore, the ILD representation was asymmetrical, demonstrating a contralateral bias. A smaller bias was also found in the age-matched controls, but not in the adult owls. The abnormalities in the ITD and ILD representations in the noise-reared owls tended to gradually recover following the cessation of noise and exposure to normal acoustic environment. Thus, the auditory map of space in the OT of the barn owl relies on normal acoustic experience for its development. The effects of the deprivation recover with normal experience, demonstrating that the auditory map is capable of adaptive plasticity beyond the age of two months.",

However, there is little knowledge about the effects of adulthood stress on DNA methylation. In addition, a link between changes in DNA methylation and the different behavioral outcomes of traumatic events has not been deciphered. In our work, we have studied these questions by examining methylation at the genomic region encoding corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF), a key component of the neuroendocrine and behavioral response to stress. Increased CRF and cortisol levels, are often correlated with clinical depression. We detected a high amount of methylation at the CRF promoter region in the mouse hypothalamus, and relatively little methylation in the intronic region. Using two independent in vitro assays, we determined that methylation of the CRF promoter actively inhibits gene transcription. To determine the effects of adulthood stress on this genomic region, we subjected adult mice to social defeat. Social defeat induced a long-term increase in CRF mRNA levels, and decrease in CRF promoter methylation. Changes in DNA methylation were detected at numerous CpGs in the CRF promoter, including at the cAMP-responsive element. These changes were detected only in animals that displayed socially avoidant behavior following the stress protocol. Defeated animals that displayed normal social behavior had unchanged CRF mRNA levels and promoter methylation levels. Subsequent treatment with the anti-depressant imipramine attenuated the changes in CRF expression and promoter methylation. In addition, lentiviral-mediated knockdown of CRF in the hypothalamus attenuated social defeat-induced avoidance. These results suggest that the behavioral outcome of adulthood stress is mediated through changes in DNA methylation, and that the CRF system is a primary mediator of stress-induced social avoidance.",

The intrinsic responses to SLM-driven activation are spatially restricted to the excitation domains, allowing for tight control of the driven patterns.

Towards this end, we dispersed micron-scale carbon particles in various acute and cultured neuronal preparations. To induce thermal transients, a focused laser beam (several microns in diameter) was directed onto the particles and pulsed for periods ranging from 100 \u03bcs to 10 msec. To characterize the properties of the induced thermal transients, experiments using the temperature sensitive dye RU were performed and complemented by theoretical analysis.

We further showed that dysfunction in gamma-secretase catalytic site led to an impairment in clearing insoluble beta-amyloid from brain sections taken from an Alzheimer\u2019s disease mouse model when compared to microglia from wild-type mice. In this work, we suggest for the first time, a dual role for gamma-secretase in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. One role is the cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein for pathological beta-amyloid production and the other role is to regulate microglia activity that is important for clearing neurotoxic beta-amyloid deposits. Further studies of gamma-secretase mediates cellular pathways in microglia may provide useful insights into the development of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other neurodegenerative diseases providing future avenues for therapeutic intervention.",

We have developed successfully a gene delivery platform into cells using lentiviral vectors that are pseudotyped with a sindbis mutated envelope and a single chain variable fragment (scFv). Incorporation of scFv onto the surface of viral particles was obtained either via interaction of scFv fused to human Fc antibody domain (scFvFc) with a protein A moiety, inserted to the sindbis E2 envelope protein, or through transient surface display of scFvFc fused with a transmembrane domain of cd28. A third approach facilitated stable surface expression of scFvFc fused with a transmembrane domain of cd28 by expressing it in a lentivector along with an Internal Ribosome Entry Site reporter gene (IRES), thus enhancing the incorporation of scFv to engineered particles. To demonstrate the feasibility of the targeting system, two versions of scFv that specifically target the receptor-binding region of the S1 spike glycoprotein of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS CoV) strains were used. Despite high similarity of the two S1 antigens, gene transfer was obtained with low background of transduction levels (low levels of unspecific infection), indicating high affinity of the surface displayed scFv to their cognate antigen. Significantly, this delivery platform was exploited for in-vivo targeting of recombinant lentiviruses that incorporate an NG2 antibody to mice hippocampal cells. Colocalization of surface expressed NG2 and lentiviral mediated gene transfer of Zoanthus Green Fluorescent protein (ZsGreen) were detected. Overall, these results demonstrate efficacy of lentiviral vectors as a gene delivery platform. Furthermore, such a system could potentially be used to mark specific cells populations for studying their in-vivo biology under health and disease.",

The SCA-induced rhythm involves synaptic activation of sacral neurons projecting to lumbar segments, largely via the ventral funiculus (VF). We have demonstrated that elevation of intrinsic and/or extrinsic acetylcholine in the sacral segments enhanced the hindlimb locomotor rhythm in isolated spinal cords of neonatal rats. To reveal the sacral cellular elements and connections involved in the cholinergic modulation, sacral neurons projecting to the lumbar segments were filled by retrograde fluorescent labeling via the VF (VF-neurons), SCA were loaded by anterograde fluorescent labeling and immunofluorescence of vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGlut1) marked glutamatergic innervations. Cholinergic transmission components were identified by tracing choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), vesicular acetylcholine-transporter (VAChT) and acetylcholinesterase and confocal microscopy. Our studies revealed that a substantial fraction of the sacral VF-neurons received innervations by SCA and glutamatergic boutons. Almost 30% of the VF-neurons demonstrated AChE activity and about 11% were also capable of synthesizing acetylcholine (ChAT positive). A fraction of the VF-neurons received cholinergic inputs (VAChT positive boutons). Thus, we identified sacral VF-neurons which received glutamatergic afferent innervation and were cholinergic and others that received cholinergic innervations. Collectively, these findings provide numerous ways by which elevation of the intrinsic concentration of acetylcholine in the sacral segments of the spinal cord can increase the motor output during locomotor activity. This capacity may be used to improve the ability to reactivate the pattern generating circuitry in the absence of descending supraspinal control.",

Several neuropeptides such as bradykinin (BK), endothelin (ET) and somatostatin (SST) are known to be important mediators of inflammation in the periphery. However, evidence of similar regulatory function in the brain is scarce. The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of these neuropeptides on various aspects of microglial activity such as chemotaxis, phagocytosis of amyloid-beta and the release of proinflammatory mediators. Using immunocytochemistry, we show expression of receptors for BK (B1, B2 subtypes), ET (ETA, ETB subtypes) and SST (SST 2, 3, 4 subtypes) in both microglial cell lines BV2 and N9. Our results also show that exposure of BV2 and N9, as well as primary neonatal rat microglial cells to BK or SST increased A-beta phagocytosis by the cells by more than two folds in a dose dependent manner. By contrast, ET decreased A-beta phagocytosis dose dependently. Pulse-chase experiments confirmed that all neuropeptides increased the overall phagocytosis of A-beta but did not affect A-beta degradation pathways. All neuropeptides increased chemotactic activity of microglia several folds. In addition, we show that amyloid-beta-induced expression of genes encoding the proinflammatory molecules iNOS and COX-2 in microglia was inhibited by 50% by BK. ET also significantly decreased the amyloid-beta-induced expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 and interleukine-6. These results suggest that neuropeptides may play a role in chemotaxis and clearance of amyloid-beta and modulate the brain response to neuroinflammatory processes such as the release of inflammatory factors from microglial cells.",

However, physiological functions of Abeta, a normal product of neuronal metabolism, remain largely unknown. Furthermore, the primary mechanisms by which endogenous Abeta initiates synaptic and cognitive impairments have not been identified. Our recent study demonstrates that endogenous Abeta peptides positively modulate release probability on a rapid timescale in hippocampal synapses (Abramov et al., 2009). To identify the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying Abeta-mediated increase in release probability, we combine optical imaging of vesicle recycling by FM dyes and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) spectroscopy at the level of single synapses in cultured hippocampal neurons. Our results demonstrate that amyloid precursor protein (APP), in addition to being a source of Abeta, has a signaling function: it is essential for Abeta-induced enhancement of basal vesicle release. To further understand the mechanisms of this regulation, we explored the relationship between neuronal activity, APP structure and extracellular Abeta concentration at the level of presynaptic boutons. We observed FRET between CFP/YFP-tagged APP proteins, suggesting formation of APP homodimers in hippocampal presynaptic boutons. Notably, APP homodimerization depended on the level of neuronal and synaptic activity and exhibited high degree of variability among the boutons. Given a positive relationship between Abeta levels and neuronal activity, we are currently examining whether Abeta is the mediator transducing changes in membrane potential to APP homodimerization. Elucidating the mechanisms underlying the effect of Abeta on synaptic function may help to understand physiological Abeta signaling and to identify primary pathological events initiating synaptic dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease.",

Activation of the amyloid cascade in apoE4 and apoE3 targeted replacement mice revealed that apoE4 stimulates isoform specifically the degeneration of hippocampal CA1 neurons.

Previous studies have typically used long-term memory repetition priming to explore the cognitive and neural representations of impossible objects. Priming has been consistently found for structurally possible, but not for impossible object, which has been used to suggest that impossible objects cannot produce coherent 3D representations in long-term memory. Imaging studies support this conclusion, showing neural repetition effects for possible but not for impossible objects. In the present study we used short-lag fMRI adaptation to investigate whether equivalent differences between possible and impossible objects could also be detected at the perceptual level. Seventeen subjects performed same/different object judgments for pairs of possible and impossible objects. Contrary to our predictions, equivalent effects of fMRI adaptation were found for impossible compared to possible objects in the lateral occipital complex (LOC) as well as in other areas along the ventral visual stream. We suggest that these findings reflect the creation of 3D representations for (once) impossible objects. This assumption is supported by additional behavioral results, obtained in a separate experiment, showing that immediate repetition of impossible objects increased their likelihood to be perceived as possible. Overall, these findings suggest that qualitative differences may exist between perceptual and long-term memory representations of object (im)possibility in the visual cortex.",

Glial cells in the CNS are known to express the 18 kDa mitochondrial Translocator Protein (TSPO). The TSPO exerts proapoptotic effects, thus blocking TSPO activity can prevent its pro-apoptotic effects. Recently, we have developed novel TSPO ligands of the quinazoline family, to study their capability to prevent glial cell death otherwise caused by glutamate overload. Affinity for the TSPO of our novel ligands was measured by binding assays. Promising novel TSPO ligands were applied to cells treated with glutamate. Previous studies have shown that glutamate (10 \u2013 200 mM) is lethal for primary astrocytes and astrocytoma cell lines. For our study cells of the U118MG glioblastoma cell line were treated with glutamate (25 mM \u2013 80 mM) for 24 hours. Induced cellular death was measured by trypan blue inclusion and release of lactate dehydrogenase. 7-Aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD) was applied to distinguish between late apoptotic and necrotic cells. Specific apoptotic features, such as mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m) collapse and cardiolipin oxidation, were assayed with 5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1',3,3'-tetraethyl- benzimidazolylcarbocyanine chloride (JC1) and 10-N-Nonyl-Acridine Orange (NAO) fluorescent staining, respectively. We found that our glutamate treatment caused cellular death, including apoptosis. Four of our novel TSPO ligands (tentatively named BD 42, BD 57, BD 66, and BD 108) protected against glutamate overload. Their protective effects were more pronounced than of the classical TSPO ligands, PK 11195 or Ro5-4864. In fact, the new TSPO ligands were able to reduce cell death down to control levels. Due to its relatively high affinity for the TSPO and robust anti cell death properties, BD 57 appears to present itself as our lead compound.",

It is also a major inspiration for the development of mathematical models of multi-legged locomotion, as well as biologically-inspired robotics. This ability of both, stereotyped and adaptive locomotor behavior is largely dependent on the interplay between centrally-generated motor patterns and the sensory inputs that shape them. We utilized a combined experimental and theoretical approach to investigate the relative importance of central circuits interconnections vs. intersegmental afferents in cockroach locomotion. We simultaneously recorded motorneurons in the thoracic ganglia of a walking cockroach, while sensory feedback was completely blocked, or allowed only from a specific intact stepping leg. We observed a default coordinated motor pattern with consistent phase relationship that shares similarities with a double tripod gait, suggesting central, feedforward control. This intersegmental coordination pattern was then reinforced in the presence of sensory feedback from a single stepping leg; we show transient stabilization of phase differences between the middle and hind thoracic motor neurons following individual steps of a front leg. Data was further analyzed using stochastic models of coupled oscillators and maximum likelihood techniques to estimate underlying physiological parameters, such as the uncoupled endogenous frequencies and strength and direction of coupling. Our findings indicate that descending ipsilateral coupling is stronger than ascending one while coupling between the left and right sides of the meso- and meta-thoracic ganglia appear symmetrical. A comparison with recent findings in stick-insects may indicate different inter-segmental coordination strategies in the two insects that exemplify opposite extremes of a fast-slow locomotion continuum, while sharing much of the neural and body architecture.",

Clinicians believe that adversity, even before pregnancy, impacts the future child's development, and research has suggested that this is due to the child developing in the same adverse environment. However, in a novel experimental paradigm in laboratory rats, we have previously shown (Shachar-Dadon, A. Schulkin, J. Leshem, M. Developmental Psychology, 45, 9-16, 2009) that stress to the mother before she becomes pregnant, impacts her future offspring behavior even where the environment is controlled. The offspring's emotional and social behavior is altered in complex ways that differ in males and females, and persist into their adulthood. Female offspring of dams stressed before conception were more fearful, anxious, depressed, impaired cognitively, and less sociable. Males were also less sociable, but were less fearful and more resilient. In search of a mechanism for these intriguing findings, we examined alterations in adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing in the offspring of stressed and control dams immediately after birth (P0-P1) and in adulthood (P90-100). A-to-I RNA editing is an epigenetic process that entails site-specific modification in precursor mRNAs, catalyzed by members of the adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) enzyme family, and impacts on neurotransmission at 5-HT, glutamate and GABA receptors. We found abnormal levels of A-to-I RNA editing in the progeny of stressed dams immediately after birth. These findings indicate that behavioral abnormalities observed in pups born to stressed dams may be due to changes in the epigenetic code that are transmitted across generations, rather than differences in early environment.",

The wasp stings the cockroach in the head and delivers a neurotoxic venom cocktail directly inside the prey's cerebral ganglia. Although not paralyzed, the stung cockroach becomes a living yet docile 'zombie' incapable of self-initiating walking or escape running. Our goal was to identify the neuronal substrate responsible for this venom-induced neuro-chemical manipulation of the cockroach locomotion. We show that the decrease in the drive for walking can be attributed to a decrease in neuronal activity in a small region of the cockroach cerebral nervous system, the sub-esophageal ganglion (SEG). Specifically, we have used behavioral, neuro-pharmacological and electrophysiological methods to show that: (1) Surgically removing the cockroach SEG prior to wasp stinging prolongs the duration of the sting 5-fold, suggesting that the wasp actively searches and targets the SEG during the stinging sequence; (2) injecting a sodium channel blocker into the SEG of non-stung cockroaches reversibly decreases spontaneous and evoked walking, suggesting that the SEG plays an important role in the up-regulation of locomotion; (3) artificial focal injection of crude milked venom into the SEG of non-stung cockroaches decreases spontaneous and evoked walking, as seen with naturally-stung cockroaches; and (4) spontaneous and evoked neuronal spiking activity in the SEG, recorded with an extracellular bipolar microelectrode, is markedly decreased in stung cockroaches as compared with non-stung controls. Our data strongly provides evidence for a critical and permissive role of the SEG in the regulation of locomotion in insects. By injecting a venom cocktail directly into the SEG, the parasitoid Jewel Wasp selectively manipulates the cockroach's motivation to initiate walking without interfering with other non-related behaviors.",

Recent studies have shown that reduction in the IGF-IR expression levels prevents synapse loss and memory decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD) mice models (Cohen et al., 2009; Freude et al., 2009). In contrast, other studies have suggested improvement of cognitive function by IGF-1 injections. In order to understand the mechanisms underlying regulation of memory function by IGF-IR, we first aimed to explore its role in normal synaptic transmission and plasticity. Here we examined the effects of endogenous IGF-I on basal synaptic vesicle recycling and presynaptic plasticity utilizing activity-dependent FM styryl dyes in primary hippocampal cultures. We found that both IGF-IR/IR antagonist AG1024 and antibody neutralizing IGF-IR activity (aIR3) induced presynaptic inhibition at functional boutons and reduction in the number of functional boutons during physiologically-relevant patterns of stimulation. These results suggest that the IGF-IR signaling positively regulates synaptic vesicle release and maintains the number of functional synapses in hippocampal networks. Based on these data, we hypothesize that reduction in the basal level of ongoing synaptic activity is the key trigger of synaptic and cognitive improvements in AD mice. We will further corroborate this conjecture by exploring the effect of IGF-IR knock-down in hippocampal circuits under physiological and pathological conditions.",

In an attempt to understand the effect of the stimulations on the neural networks within the VTA, we studied Local Field Potentials (LFP) recordings and their synchronization patterns. For examining temporal shifts in spectral characterizations, a wavelet based synchronization measure (the Wavelet Phase Coherence) was used. We found that the synchronization between LFP recordings in distal parts of the VTA was increased in FSL rats following DBS treatment, in frequencies above 30 Hz (gamma frequency range), while there was no affect in the lower frequency bands. DBS treatment of the normal Sprague Dawley (SD) rats did not show any effect on LFP synchronization.

Recently we showed that the analysis of induced gamma-band responses in scalp EEG recordings is seriously confounded by a myogenic saccade-related spike potential (SP), which manifests as a transient broadband induced response overlapping the gamma frequency band (iGBRtb). We further suggested an SP-guided artifact correction procedure based on Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to remove this confounding signal from EEG data, in order to unveil any neural signal in the gamma band present in the EEG. Here, we applied this method to analyze scalp EEG recorded from 14 subjects presented with short-duration visual stimuli. We then compared the induced gamma band responses in the corrected data and the uncorrected data, which was treated only with traditional artifact rejection methods. The results show that our method is effective in suppressing the SP artifact, allowing the investigation of neurogenic gamma-band activity thus far obscured by the higher-power myogenic iGBRtb. The results further suggest the existence of such an induced gamma-band response in the EEG, with a duration corresponding to the duration of stimulus presentation.

The long-term effects of rTMS on excitability or behavioral and clinical changes have been associated with neuroplasticity and mechanisms such as long term potentiation (LTP) or depression (LTD). High frequency stimulation can induce increases in excitability or thought to cause LTP-like effects while low frequency stimulation can reduce excitability or induce LTD-like effects. The effect of frequency has not been consistent in all TMS experiments, and several studies indicate on a critical role of spontaneous neuronal activity on the neurophysiological and behavioral outcomes of the stimulation. Neurotrophic factors and glutamate transmission are critical mediators of synaptic plasticity and can be used as markers for studying long-term effects of rTMS. In this study we have measured the effects of 10 sessions of either high or low frequency rTMS on alterations of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which is one of the most prevalent neurotrophic factors in the adult. We have also measured alterations in the GluR1 subunit of the AMPA receptors, another marker for plasticity especially given its effect on calcium permeability. In order to test whether the long-term effects of stimulation on these markers for neuroplasticity depend on spontaneous neural activity, we have measured the effects of several rTMS sessions applied on either awake or anaesthetized rats. We found that high frequency rTMS in awake rats increased BDNF and GluR1 levels in the hippocampus (Hc) and BDNF levels in the prelimbic cortex (PLC). Conversely, in anaesthetized rats, the same stimulation decreased BDNF and GluR1 levels in the Hc and BDNF in the PLC. This study indicates how rTMS can affect neuroplasticity and emphasizes that the spontaneous neural activity during stimulation can dramatically affect the neurochemical outcome and thereby therapeutic effects.",

We show that, for local control of dendritic excitability, \"off path\" inhibition is more effective than \"on path\" inhibition and that inhibition effectively spreads into regions more central to the inhibitory contacts, where it accumulates and might even exceed the inhibitory impact at the synaptic contact sites themselves. Hence, local morphological inhibitory domains may have a more global inhibitory impact on the tree. This holds for several reconstructed dendrites with known inhibitory loci, including Martinotti-to-pyramidal cell connection in rat neocortex. We thus highlight a new set of design principles for the operation of inhibition in dendrites.",

The rapid removal of degenerated myelin by phagocytosis is advantageous since molecules in myelin inhibit axonal regeneration and thus repair. We presently test the hypothesis that myelin regulates its own phagocytosis by simultaneous activation and inhibition. Activation follows myelin binding receptors that mediate its phagocytosis. Inhibition, we hypothesize, follows CD47 on myelin binding immune inhibitory receptor SIRP\u03b1 (signal regulatory protein-\u03b1) on macrophages and microglia, which was not studied before. We document here for the first time that CD47 but not SIRP\u03b1 is expressed on Schwann cells, oligodendrocytes and myelin, and further confirm that CD47 and SIRP\u03b1 are expressed on macrophages and microglia. We demonstrate also that phagocytosis is augmented after reducing SIRP\u03b1 levels by lentiviral infection with SIRP\u03b1-shRNA and after blocking CD47-SIRP\u03b1 binding with function blocking mAbs against CD47 and SIRP\u03b1. We further reveal faster in-vivo removal of degenerated myelin in CD47 knockout mice than in wild-type mice during Wallerian degeneration following peripheral nerve injury. Observations suggest altogether that myelin inhibits its own phagocytosis through CD47/SIRP\u03b1 interactions. It may further be argued that CD47 functions normally as a marker of \"self\" that helps protect intact myelin and myelin forming Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes from activated macrophages and microglia. However, the very same mechanism may turn disadvantageous after traumatic injury to axons since it attenuates phagocytosis of degenerated myelin.",

Therefore, it has been suggested that LTS neurons protect cortical circuitry against overexcitation and epilepsy. We examine the dynamical roles of short-term synaptic plasticity in networks that include LTS neurons. We construct and analyze a rate model of the circuit that includes RS, LTS, and fast-spiking (FS; parvalbumin-expressing interneuron) cell types. Short-term plasticity is represented by the Tsodyks-Markram scheme. RS and FS neurons, but not LTS neurons, receive external thalamic input. In an RS-LTS circuit, activity of LTS neurons reduces the firing rate of the RS neurons. Well above the LTS firing threshold, this reduction is constant and independent of the firing rate of RS neurons. Surprisingly, the strongest impact of the LTS neuron on the shape of the firing rate-input curve is just above the LTS firing threshold. Like LTS-to-RS connections, FS-to-RS synapses reduce the firing rate of RS neurons by a constant amount at high firing rates. An RS-LTS-FS network may exhibit slow oscillations at the time scale of recovery from facilitation (~2 Hz); these oscillations persist even when all the synapses do not exhibit any synaptic depression. RS neurons oscillate between a more-active state and a less-active state; the firing rate in both states is larger than zero. FS neurons fire episodes of spikes in phase with the more-active state of the RS neurons, whereas LTS neurons fire in phase with the less-active state of RS neurons, i.e. they fire in anti-phase with FS neurons. We conclude that the short-term synaptic plasticity of synapses to and from LTS interneurons allows these cells to shape the dynamics of cortical circuits not only at high firing rates, but also just above their firing threshold.",

Based on animal research, a neurobehavioral model named \"Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory\" (RST) was suggested, including 3 systems involved in motivation: 1) The \"Behavioral Activation System\" (BAS) mediates sensitivity to reward via e.g. Nucleus Accumbens (NAC) and dorso-medial Pre Frontal Cortex (dmPFC). 2) The \"Fight Flight Freeze System\" (FFFS) mediates sensitivity to punishment via e.g. the hypothalamus and amygdala. 3) The \"Behavioral Inhibition System\" (BIS) responds to goal-conflict represented by mixed or ambiguous cues via e.g. the hippocampus and ventro-medial PFC (vmPFC). Abnormal operation of these systems has been further proposed to underlie pathological reaction to cues, as manifested in anxiety and mood disorders. To date, however, the RST model has been established in animal studies while the evidence regarding the human brain are yet non conclusive. 24 healthy subjects participated in an fMRI study while playing an interactive modified Domino game encompassing distinct periods of response to punishments, rewards or goal-conflict. We found a typical brain signature for each interval of the game, corresponding to the motivation systems as proposed by the RST: Fitting with the FFFS; the amygdala and hypothalamus increased activation during the interval of response to punishment. Fitting with the BAS; the NAC and dmPFC increased activation during the interval of response to reward. Fitting with the BIS; the hippocampus and vmPFC increased activation during periods of conflict. Our initial analysis suggests that motivational processes in humans may be operating with accordance to the RST model. This understanding opens a new horizon for therapeutic interventions based on individual brain-profile of response to environmental cues.",

It has also been shown [2] that synaptopodin may be functionally associated with ryanodine-type calcium stores which are activated by caffeine. In the present study we examined electrophysiological properties of acute slices of the dorsal and ventral hippocampus in response to caffeine. In addition, the effect of caffeine on [Ca2+]i was measured in cultured hippocampal slices using 2-p microscopy. Population excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) were recorded in stratum radiatum of CA1 region of the DH and VH slices taken from 30-day-old Wistar rats. Caffeine was applied at concentrations of 0.5 to 10 mM for 30 minutes. We found that VH is significantly more sensitive to caffeine at low concentrations (1 mM) than DH. LTP was induced by high frequency stimulation (100 Hz, 1 s). Caffeine (5 mM) was added after the second train of stimuli and led to the potentiation of the both pathways (stimulated and non-stimulated) in VH slices exclusively. In a parallel series of experiments, 2-3 weeks old cultured slices of VH and DH were preincubated with 10 \u03bcM Fluo-3 AM during 2 hours at room temperature. Administration of 10 mM Caffeine induced transient calcium responses lasting 1.35 times longer and being 1.87 times larger in the VH than in the DH slices. These results indicate that caffeine produces larger response in the VH than in the DH, which is congruent with the assumption that the role of calcium stores in modulating neuronal plasticity is more significant in VH than in DH.",

By performing detailed structure function analyses we identified a sub-segment of the Plum extracellular domain that is both necessary and sufficient for its axon pruning promoting activity. In contrast, we demonstrated that the cytoplasmic domain is not required for Plums function in axon pruning, suggesting it functions as a co-receptor. In addition, in-vivo mosaic rescue experiments, combined with in-vitro aggregation assays suggest that Plum binds a heterophilic ligand that is present in limited amount.

To test proprioceptive single arm control in Octopus vulgaris we designed a Y shaped maze, which was opaque to the animal, was attached to the front glass of the home tank. Octopuses were trained to insert a single arm through the tube and into one of the two goal compartments to retrieve a food reward. Octopuses performed 10 trials a day each lasting 180 s. After testing side preference animals were assigned a target side (left or right). 5 of 6 Animals learned to reach through the maze to retrieve a food reward from their target side within 20-90 trials. With a lack of visual and chemical information on the location of their arm the only input octopus could utilize to direct the arm is from the arm itself.

Fn14-TRAIL is combined of the extracellular domain of Fn14 (blocking the pro-inflammatory TWEAK ligand) fused to TRAIL ligand (inducing apoptotic signals through its receptors on activated inflammatory cells). The present study explores the anti-inflammatory efficacy of Fn14-TRAIL in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). EAE was induced by immunization with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) 35-55 peptide in CFA in C57bl mice. Daily treatment with Fn14-TRAIL started on day 10 post immunization. Mice were followed daily for EAE clinical severity. T-cell reactivity towards the encephalitogenic peptide was tested by proliferation and by secretion of inflammatory cytokines, tested by ELISA. Fn14-TRAIL treatment markedly and significantly ameliorated EAE clinical signs by 40-50%. Clinical improvement was observed 6 days after treatment initiated, and lasted up to day 40 from disease induction. Decreased reactivity of encephalitogenic T-cells and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines were observed, with reduction in IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17 secretion as well as increase in IL-10. Hence, Fn14-TRAIL treatment induced a shift of the cytokine profile from Th1 and Th17 dominance to Th2. In-vitro assays established the ability of Fn14-TRAIL to induce apoptosis of target cells expressing TRAIL receptors and TWEAK. Fn14-TRAIL is unique fusion protein combining two potentially functional domains. Treatment with Fn14-TRAIL has immunomodulatory influence in EAE.",

It is assumed that such distinct alterations may lead to differential gene transcription and protein expression (Silva et al., 1998; Kandel, 2001; Dudai, 2004). The current project examined alterations in gene expression in different hippocampal GABAergic interneurons (Freund and Buzsaki, 1996), following exposure to Controllable vs. Uncontrollable stress. To induce graded amygdala activation controllability over the situation in the Morris Water Maze varied using 'Control', 'Invisible platform' and 'No platform' groups, as was described before (Kavushanski et al., 2006; Vouimba et al., 2004). Blood CORT levels (assessed by ELIZA) and p-ERK expression levels in the amygdala (assessed by Western Blot) were measured following the behavioral training. Significant differences in blood CORT concentration levels were found between the stress groups and the 'Control' group. Additionally, 'No-platform' group differed significantly from the other two groups' in levels of amygdala p-ERK expression. Five hours following behavioral training, rats were perfused and potential alterations in gene expression were evaluated. We found hippocampal sub-region specific alterations in GABA interneuron related gene expression among the groups.",

The development of this interface allows simultaneous, multisite, long-term recordings of action-potentials and subthreshold excitatory and inhibitory synaptic potentials with matching quality and signal-to-noise ratio of conventional intracellular sharp glass microelectrodes or patch electrodes. The extracellularly gM\u03bcE-recorded action potentials reach up to 25 mV in amplitude, and synaptic potentials reach up to 3 mV. The key to the multi-electrode \"in-cell recording\" approach is the outcome of three converging cell biological principals: (a) the activation of phagocytotic-like mechanisms in which the cultured cells are induced to actively engulf gold-mushroom microelectrodes that protrude from a flat substrate, (b) the generation of high seal resistance (~100 MOhm - according to ultrastructural studies) between the cell's membrane and the engulfed gM\u03bcE, and (c) the localization of ionic channels (Ohmic conductance, 100-1000 picosiemens according to computer simulations) in the plasma membrane that faces the gM\u03bcE. We refer to the novel approach as \"in-cell recording and stimulation by extracellular electrodes\" to differentiate it from the classical intracellular recording and stimulation methods. This novel technique is expected to revolutionize the analysis of neuronal networks in relations to learning, information storage and can be used to develop novel drugs as well as high fidelity neural prosthetics and brain-machine systems.",

A subset of networks was also inspected under the effect of Bicuculline, an antagonist of GABAA receptors, exposing the impacts of the inhibitory sub-network on the dynamics of response.

Previous studies showed that performance gains obtained at one retinal location do not generalize (transfer) to another location. A typical example is the texture discrimination task (Karni & Sagi, 1991). This result is taken to indicate learning at a processing stage where the two locations are encoded by separate neuronal networks, probably at the primary visual cortex. Alternatively, specificity could arise if the learning process considers detailed neuronal representations which may differ between locations, possibly due to random variations in anatomy (overfitting). The latter predicts learning generalization when practice is not constrained to a single location since now common features shared by the different locations are learned and overfitting is avoided. Here we used the backward-masked texture-discrimination task: 10 ms target followed by 100 ms mask with varied Stimulus Onset Asynchrony (SOA). In the experiments, one group practiced at a single location while another group at two locations (eccentricity of 5.3\u00b0, diagonally opposing from fixation). After 4 daily sessions, both groups improved their SOA threshold (x1.5). Surprisingly, while learning in the 1-location group was location specific, in the 2-location group it transferred to two new locations. The results support a view of perceptual learning as a statistical modeling process with locality explained by overfitting. However, this theory is challenged by (1) the finding of equal rates of learning in both groups, and (2) results showing no further learning in the 2-location group when given additional practice with target positioned at a fixed location, thus allowing for overfitting. The results are consistent with an account according to which each target location is represented by multiple neuronal states, with only one of the redundant cortical representations selected during the learning process.",

We analyzed this dataset by mapping each motorneuron in perimotor space (defined by the location of muscle fibers it innervates). We expressed all the connections made by each motorneuron according to their relative position with respect to other motorneurons of the same class and described a typical connectivity pattern for each class.

This replaces the classic scheme where saccadic amplitudes were thought to result from the arithmetic mean of the two angular demands. By analyzing the left and right eye weights within and between individuals, we show the following: (1) the two eyes' saccadic amplitudes are inherently unequal; consequently, the smooth movement complementing the saccade must also be inherently asymmetric; (2) separate neuronal circuits generate convergent and divergent saccades; (3) there is a strong indication that left and right eye weights arise through interocular competition during development; (4) the ocular weights may serve as individual physiological markers. Finally, we argue that our results provide an explanatory framework for recent neurophysiological findings and derive a testable prediction on the discharge pattern of saccadic burst neurons.",

Subjects had to detect images of faces and tools in four quadrants relative to fixation (4-alternative forced choice, 4AFC) and report the subjective stimulus visibility. The contrast of the flashed Mondrian masks was adjusted individually for each subject to achieve comparable numbers of 'visible' and 'invisible' trials. Activity in regions-of-interest in early and high order visual cortex showed a strong effect of subjective visibility, while the activity was not modulated significantly by the objective 4AFC performance. We found similar results when separately analyzing two groups of 'blindsight' and 'non-blindsight' subjects, based on a median split of 4AFC performance in 'invisible' trials. Using multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) of retinotopic activity in early visual cortex, we found that 'invisible' trials with correct 4AFC performance result in significantly higher prediction accuracies than 'invisible' trials with incorrect 4AFC performance.

In view of the fact that publications have shown that rats do not become addicted unless their corticosterone (Cort) level is above the minimum and that DHEA decreases the levels of Cort, we decided to investigate whether the DHEA's attenuating effect is due to the decrease in Cort concentration below the threshold level. We divided the rats into 3 groups: control, DHEA-treated and DHEA + Cort. Cort was administered continuously through s.c. micro-pumps to achieve the Cort basal level. We found that DHEA and DHEA + Cort treated rats did not become addicted, suggesting that DHEA, not the decrease in Cort level, causes the attenuating effect of cocaine-seeking-behavior. In addition to the attenuating effect during the acquisition phase, we observed that DHEA treated rats did not demonstrate cocaine-seeking behavior during extinction. To investigate whether the effect in the extinction phase is modulated by the Cort level, we divided addicted rats in to 2 groups, one treated by DHEA 90 min prior and during the extinction phase, while the other served as a control. The Cort blood levels of both groups were the same. Despite the similar Cort levels, the DHEA-treated group did not express a desire for cocaine, pressing the active lever significantly less than controls. These findings indicate that the Cort level is not involved in DHEA's attenuating effect on the different stages of cocaine addiction in the self-administration rat model, and that DHEA effect is maybe modulated by other mechanisms.",

Like the mushroom bodies of insects, the cephalopod (VL) reveals an architecture characterized by millions of small interneurons, which are innervated en passant by the incoming input axons. Interestingly, the large divergence from the input neurons to the amacrine interneurons and the consequent convergence to a fewer large efferent cells, is reminiscent of simple two layered computational networks like that for pattern discrimination in machine learning. We therefore believe that understanding the neurophysiological properties of the yet simpler than vertebrates' brain, will advance understanding of the biological principles of complex brain functions. Results from our research on VL connectivity, synaptic plasticity and neuromodulation, and implementation of these properties in behavioral learning and memory, demonstrate the fruitfulness of this approach. We will further describe striking differences between the organization of short- and long-term synaptic plasticity in the VLs of Octopus vulgaris and Sepia officinalis. These differences show how adaptive homologous neural networks can be and inspire discussion on possible rationalization.",

It has been suggested that placental CRF influences embryo implantation, as well as mechanisms leading to the onset of labor and fetus delivery. Placental CRF is secreted into the maternal blood and its levels increase exponentially through pregnancy and peak during labor. A recent study in humans has shown a strong correlation between placental CRF levels during gestation and the subsequent development of postpartum depression in the mothers.

Two primal emotional circuits were proposed by their ability to evoke coherent emotional displays among experimental animals in response to aversive stimuli: 'FEAR' system which is designed to help an animal to reduce pain and to avoid the possibility of destruction and 'PANIC' system which mediates subtle feeling of social presence (Panksepp, 1982). Both systems have considerable overlap and probably interactions in certain parts of the brain, especially in \"lower\" areas such as the Periaquducatal grey, Thalamus, Hypothalamus and Amygdala. We tested for potential differential activation and involvement of the 'FEAR' and 'PANIC' systems in the consequences of exposure to stress (i.e. in juvenility, in adulthood, or both). Following exposure to the stressors, activation levels of c-fos protein were assessed within brain regions devoted to the 'FEAR' and 'PANIC', in male rats. Prior to stress in adulthood, exploration was assessed and immediately following it, avoidance task was introduced for two purposes: I) assessment of the rats' ability to learn under stressful conditions; II) exposure of rats to a stressful experience in adulthood . Rats exposed to 'Juvenile stress' exhibited a significant reduction in exploration prior to exposure to the adult stress. Further, only 'Juvenile stress' rats' failed to escape the shock while learning the two-way shuttle task. Finally, compared to all groups, rats exposed to adult stress following previous exposure to stress in juvenility, exhibited the highest c-fos activation in the PAG together with a decrease in c-fos activation in the BLA. We also found similar pattern of c-fos activation in the thalamus and hypothalamus of all exposed groups, compared to controls.",

Little is known about the effects of long-term ovarian hormone withdrawal on SCZ women, although recent studies report that chronic absence of gonadal hormones in rodents induces anxiolytic-like behaviors. Latent inhibition (LI), the capacity to ignore irrelevant stimuli, is a measure of selective attention that is disrupted in acute SCZ patients and in rats and humans treated with amphetamine and can be reversed by typical and atypical APDs. We have recently shown in female rats that ovariectomy (OVX) led to LI disruption, which was reversed by 17\u03b2-estradiol or the atypical APD clozapine. The current study aimed to characterize the long-term effects of OVX on LI expression and on anxiety-like behavior and to further test whether administration of the anxiolytic drug midazolam would normalize these effects. Adult female rats underwent OVX or sham procedures and behavior was assessed at short (1 month) and long (3 and 6 months) time intervals post-surgery. OVX induced a long-lasting excessive behavioral switching, manifested in loss of LI and in abnormally rapid reversal learning. In the elevated plus-maze (EPM), a significant reduction in the time spent in open arms and in number of entries to open arms was observed in the long-, but not short-term OVX group, as compared with sham-operated age-matched controls. Systemic administration of the benzodiazepine midazolam normalized LI expression, reversal learning in the wet T maze and EPM activity. In conclusion, prolonged absence of ovarian hormones in rats produces an anxiolytic-like effect that can be reversed by administration of the anxiolytic compound midazolam.",

            "text": "Damage to the adult primary visual cortex (V1) deprives the visual cortical hierarchy of its main source of visual information, causing a loss of conscious vision over the same part of the visual field in both eyes. Cortical blindness represents an increasingly common and significant cause of permanent disability in older humans, hindering every aspect of an individual's daily life, including reading, navigation, and driving. Though visual rehabilitation remains controversial for this condition, the presence of residual visual processing abilities in cortically blind fields (commonly known as 'blindsight') suggests a possibility of visual recovery though perceptual retraining. Part of our research aims to understand whether and how visual training may improve visual perception in cortical blindness. To date, we have shown that the discrimination of both simple and complex moving stimuli can be retrained back to normal levels in cortically blind fields. Preliminary data suggest that this is associated with a localized decrease in the strength of center-surround antagonism for motion stimuli at retrained locations. While this result and the bulk of the blindsight literature may imply an important role of hMT + in training-induced recovery of motion perception in cortically blind fields, it does not eliminate a putative contribution from other brain areas in re-learning. Indeed, we recently found that training-induced improvements in cortically blind fields generalize to stimulus conditions that do not normally invoke blindsight. fMRI results on the same subjects show these blind field improvements to be associated with changes in activity of multiple areas at both lower and higher levels of the visual cortical hierarchy. Thus, training-induced perceptual re-learning is possible following V1 damage. It occurs over a very broad range of stimulus characteristics and may be mediated by, among other factors, decreased inhibition in stimulated visual circuitries. Finally, our data suggest that the circuitries recruited by visual training in cortically blind fields may not be limited to pathways mediating blindsight. Instead, they appear to involve a more canonical route of visual information transfer that includes spared early as well as higher-level visual areas.",

There is good evidence that strategic processes play an important role in this phenomenon, but very little research has been dedicated in recent decades to this issue. In this study I focus on the influence of task context on dual task performance. Previous experiments in our lab have demonstrated that task context plays an important role in dual task performance. Participants had to name a word (task 1) and to discriminate between colors (task 2). When the input to the two tasks was always presented simultaneously (Experiment 1, fixed 0 SOA) there was no dual task cost. However, when the input to the two tasks were manipulated unpredictably (Experiment 2, SOAs of 0,50,150,800), costs were observed even in the 0 SOA condition even though this condition in and by itself was identical to that of Experiment 1. The costs in the 0 SOA of the mixed SOA study must be strategic, and yet they were observed even after extensive practice in the task. To further examine the nature of this strategic cost, I initially extensively trained subjects for 8 sessions on the 0 SOA condition (as in Experiment 1). Like Experiment 1, participants performed the two tasks in parallel and no dual task costs were observed. Following this training participants were shifted to the mixed SOA conditions (as in Experiment 2) without any change in the task instructions. The performance of the subjects in the 0 SOA condition of the transfer blocks changed dramatically to a serial performance of the two tasks, and resembled the performance of Experiment 2. These findings demonstrate that task context is a powerful factor in dual task performance and may lead participants to exhibit costs even in condition where they can perform the tasks without any costs. I will discuss the importance of these findings for theories of task performance.",

The current study aim to explore the endogenous role of miRs in regulating the activity of serotonin (5HT) expressing neurons, under normal and pathological conditions. To this end, we determined the miRs expression pattern of 5HT neurons, obtained from the raphe nucleus (RN) of 5HT reporter mice (ePET-YFP), using miRs microarray. The unique miRs expression profile of serotonergic neurons obtained from the array was bioinformaticly analyzed to indentify miRs that putatively target important genes in the serotonin circuitry, such as serotonin transporter (SERT) and serotonin auto receptor (Htr1a). Targeting predictions of these genes 3'UTRs were further tested by in-vitro luciferase assays and mutation studies. Furthermore, miRs expression levels at the mouse RN, the main source of 5HT in the brain, were altered following antidepressant administration, and not following acute or chronic stress. In vivo manipulation of a specific miR in the RN is currently performed using site-specific over-expression or knocking down of specific miR using lentiviruses in adult mice. Following these genetic manipulation, mice will be behaviorally examined for changes in anxiety and depression-like behaviors. Reviling novel endogenous regulatory components of the serotonin circuitry, may pave the way for better understating abnormalities of 5-HT in psychopathologies.",

The anchoring deficit hypothesis of dyslexia proposes that this is a core deficit underlying dyslexics' major difficulties. Anchoring is best exhibited in a two-tone frequency discrimination task with a reference tone (Ahissar et al, 2006). A previous ERP study with control participants (Cohen & Ahissar, ISFN, 2009) found that when participants passively listen to the protocol of 2-tone discrimination with a reference tone, the delay to their automatically produced P2 component (~200 ms after tone onset) is correlated with their subsequently measured behavior.

(2006) proposed that dyslexics' reading difficulties stem from impaired ability to implicitly learn (\"anchor to\") regularities of sound sequences. We now asked whether variability in auditory anchoring abilities, measured with 2 tone frequency discrimination (FD) tasks, can account for variability in aptitude for foreign language acquisition in the general population. We recruited native-English speakers (N = 47; age = 22.43 \u00b1 4.37 years), who came to the Hebrew University's Ulpan for an intensive Hebrew course. We used tasks measuring 2-tone FD abilities, spatial reasoning, word reading and phonological awareness abilities in subjects' native language (English \u2013 L1). We found that, in line with previous reports (Ahissar et al., 2000), subjects' performance in FD tasks was correlated with L1 proficiency measures of reading accuracy, verbal memory and phonological awareness. These findings indicate relations between sensitivity to frequency of simple sounds and L1 proficiency. In addition, a sub-group of 23 subjects, who had no prior knowledge of Hebrew, was tested with a standard Hebrew exam at the end of an intensive 5 week Hebrew course. We found that their final grade in the Hebrew exam was correlated with 3 types of measures: general cognitive abilities (r(21) = .57, p = .005), 2-tone frequency discrimination (r(21) = -.51, p = .012) and single-word reading rates in L1 (r(21) = .45, p = .033). Specifically, to better assess which aspect of sensitivity to sound is relevant to Hebrew acquisition, we used four FD protocols which varied in anchoring difficulty to repeated frequencies. The correlation with the Hebrew grade was attained only for the difficult anchoring protocol, suggesting that anchoring to sound statistics (frequency regularity in our assessments) is indeed a relevant parameter for predicting aptitude for Hebrew acquisition.",

SOD1G93A transgenic mice serve as a standard model for ALS. Here, we compared the survival rates of SOD1G93A transgenic mice treated at 11 weeks of age with NAP (either, twice daily with 2 microgram/mouse/one daily injection \u2013 n = 10, or once daily with 10 micrograms/mouse/day, n = 23). The control saline-treated ALS mice included 37 mice. The NAP-treated ALS mice showed an apparent increase in the mean life span of 3.5 days as compared to the saline control. Hanging wire test performed at the age of 16 weeks showed motor improvement in the NAP-treated mice. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation of brain changes showed that NAP treatment reduced T2 value of the trigeminal nucleus, nigrostriatal bundle and regions of the lateral ventricles. When T2 values of motor nuclei were correlated with the life span of the respective mice, no correlations were found, however survival time showed a very strong correlation with the T2 value of the brain lateral ventricles. Thus, motor improvement after NAP treatment can be explained by decreased damage of the trigeminal nucleus and the nigrostriatal bundle and the extended life span by reduced damaged in the lateral ventricles. Statistical analysis of the control group indicated that the group can be divided into two subpopulations, one living up to 130 days (n = 16) and one living for longer time periods (n = 21), this division resulted in increased homogeneity within the two groups and a ~2-fold reduction in the standard deviation of the respective average life spans. When the results were further analyzed for the NAP-treatment group, a significant prolonged life span was observed with a mean of 142 + 2.1 days (n = 15) vs. 136 + 1.3 in the controls (n = 10). This increase in life span is attributed to the reduced damage to lateral ventricles in the NAP-treated group.",

In order to learn more about the mechanisms, we recorded extracellular electrical activity in the amygdala of a Macaque monkey during delivery of aversive odors and under the influence of Midazolam (IM 0.1 mg/kg) or Ketamine(IM 6 mg/kg). We used odors because they have a direct anatomical route into the primate amygdala and underlie intense emotional states. We used a pressure sensor and a nasal mask to monitor the respiratory rate and its modulations that measure implicit valence. Local field potentials (LFP) that reflect synaptic activity were recorded from 11 electrodes located in the amygdala (anatomical location was pre-established by individual MRI scans): 6 sessions under the effect of Midazolam and 5 under Ketamine. We observed a radical change after Ketamine injection: Beta waves disappeared, and alpha waves were diminished. A gamma band (40-60 Hz) appeared, and theta became dominant.",

Neuroimaging studies imply that congruent as well as incongruent trials cause a conflict, which Goldfarb and Henik (2007) argued is due to the task conflict. They found that when task control was damaged, there was a Stroop reverse facilitation (reaction times for congruent trials were slower than for neutral trials), which is the behavioral indication for task conflict. Task conflict requires certain control processes that may be different from those involved in the informational conflict. Here we suggest that the stop-signal and Stroop task conflicts can be conceptualized as inhibition of prepotent responses, and share the same control mechanism. In the current study, we combined the stop-signal and the Stroop tasks, and found that when participants' control failed during the stop-signal task (i.e., the response did not stop), a reverse facilitation emerged in the Stroop task (Experiment 1). This reverse Stroop facilitation was restricted to the condition in which no task conflict existed in the neutral condition (Experiment 2). In addition, when participants failed in the stop-signal task the informational conflict was not affected. This suggests that task conflict and stop-signal inhibition share a common mechanism of prepotent response inhibition and that a different control mechanism exists in the Stroop informational conflict.",

The acquired signals were filtered, segmented and underwent extraction of features, to be classified by an artificial neural network (ANN). For classifier training, a dataset of seizure and non-seizure recordings was comprised and represented by 22 extracted features. Forward selection analysis led to the identification of a 5 feature subset, allowing optimal tradeoff between robust ANN classification and reduced computational time. Classification output was post-processed using sliding-window thresholding, applying a persistence rule for positive detection. A graphical user interface was created for simple execution of data analysis and seizure detection. System performance was assessed by analyzing over 2,800 hours of raw iEEG recordings from 15 animals (12 epileptic and 3 controls). Performance evaluation revealed overall sensitivity and positive predictive value above 98% in unedited signals containing noise, artifacts and interictal discharges. The system also successfully detected seizures in an iEEG recording of an epilepsy patient, suggesting the human applicability of the proposed approach.",

Adult bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been extensively studied due to their wide therapeutic potential. The aim of this study was to determine if MSC transplantation to the normally restrictive SVZ of mice housed in an enriched environment stimulates endogenous neurogenesis. In the presented study thirty C57BL/6 female mice were divided into 3 groups: standard environment injected with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and enriched environment injected with either PBS or MSCs. Bromodeoxyuridine was injected for 6 days, and 3 weeks later the mice were killed and the brain tissue analyzed immunohistochemically. PBS-treated mice housed in enriched cages showed augmented neurogenesis in the SGZ but not the SVZ. MSC transplantation was associated with increased proliferation and neuronal differentiation of neural progenitors within the SVZ and an increase in the proportion of the newborn neurons out of the total proliferating cells. Histological analysis confirmed the survival of a significant amount of the transplanted cells at least three weeks after transplantation, and the presence of brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that MSCs might interfere with the tight regulation of the SVZ, independent of the induced brain lesion.",

Etiologically, ASD is thought to involve an interaction between genetic and environmental factors. In order to advance our understanding of the genetics and biological mechanisms underlying autistic behavior, several mutant mouse models with an autistic-like phenotype were developed, including Neuroligin-3 (NLGN3) knock out mice. Neuroligin-3 is a member of the postsynaptic cell-adhesion molecules family that has been found in human ASD patients and plays a role in synaptic function. Since examination of the behavioral phenotype in NLGN3 KO mice led to controversial results in different labs, in this project we focus on systematically examining autistic-like aspects of the behavior of this strain. To this end, we set a battery of tasks for the defining features of autism and additional related symptoms. This array includes well validated tests as plus-maze, T-maze, open field exploration, food-find, sociability and social novelty. In addition, we develop novel examinations especially for this aim; Olfaction discrimination test to examine non-verbal communication, \"Running-Wheel\" test to examine rigidity to change in habit and 4-chamber-exploration test to examine olfactory memory for care-giver.",

Anticonvulsant drugs are included in most of the antidotal treatments, aimed to impede seizure activity and subsequent brain damage. Since Magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) is the treatment of choice in cases of eclamptic seizures in pregnant women with hypertension, we evaluated its neuroprotective efficacy against sarin-induced convulsions. Rats were exposed to convulsant dose of sarin (96 \u03bcg/kg, i.m). One minute later, all animals were treated with TMB-4 (T, 7.5 mg/kg, i.m) and atropine (A, 5 mg/kg, i.m.) (TA mixture). Five minutes subsequent to initiation of convulsions, MgSO4 [i.p. Loading dose (600 mg/kg) + maintenance dose (300 mg/kg/q30min.)] or caramiphen (CRM, 20 mg/kg, i.m) or midazolam (MDZ, 1 mg/kg, i.m) were administered. In all three groups the tonic-clonic convulsions were attenuated or abolished shortly after the anticonvulsant treatment; however, differ from the CRM and MDZ-treated groups, the MgSO4-treated group exhibited sustained seizure activity as monitored by radio-telemetric elecectro-cortico-graphy. Analysis for brain translocator protein (TSPO) and GFAP labeling corroborated these findings and demonstrated marked neuroinflammation in the MgSO4-treated group. Interestingly, histological staining for Cresyl Violet and for MAP-2 labeling, revealed that in the MgSO4-treated group the susceptible pyramidal cells of the hippocampus area were protected in contrast to the piriform cortex and other brain areas which were extensively damaged. These findings exemplify that MgSO4, as a single anticonvulsant drug, offers incomplete protection against sarin-induced convulsions and the presence, or lack of convulsions following OP exposure are an unreliable indicator of seizure activity and ensuing brain damage. Nevertheless, further research is warranted to explain the differential protection of MgSO4 to the hippocampus over other brain areas.",

Immunofluorescence staining was used to evaluate accumulation of IgG in brain parenchyma in vivo and in vitro binding of eAPS serum IgG. The integrity of the blood brain barrier (BBB) was evaluated by injection of Evans blue (EB). We found a significant correlation between serum aPL levels, total IgG accumulated in the brain homogenates and behavioral hyperactivity. EB levels retained by the brain parenchyma in eAPS mice were higher compared to na\u00efve mice. In vivo immunofluorescence for IgG significantly stained neurons and especially inhibitory interneurons (Basket cells) in the hippocampus of eAPS mice. A similar pattern was found with eAPS IgG by in vitro immunofluorescence staining of normal brain sections. Penetration into the brain and direct interaction of eAPS IgG with inhibitory interneurons in the hippocampus may explain the hyperactive behavior of the mice. A direct role of aPL in causing CNS dysfunction points to aPL as an important therapeutic target in APS.",

Face stimuli evoked activation in the inferior occipital gyrus, fusiform gyrus, superior temporal sulcus, amygdala, inferior frontal gyrus, insula, and orbitofrontal cortex. Pattern classification with a sparse logistic regression algorithm revealed successful decoding of gender information with above chance accuracies in the IOG, FG, STS, IFG, INS and OFC. We did not find any differences in decoding the gender of face stimuli (male vs. female) as a function of the subject's gender (men vs. women) or their sexual orientation (hetero- vs. homosexual). Our findings suggest that gender information is widely distributed and is represented in the \"core\" regions that process invariant facial features, as well as the \"extended\" regions that process changeable aspects of faces.

However, we have recently shown that a saccade-related Spike Potential (SP) resulting from extraocular muscle contractions, associated with microsaccades, seriously confounds the analysis of induced Gamma-Band Responses (iGBR) in EEG. It is unclear whether this artifact also affects MEG recordings, which are increasingly used in analysis of the iGBR, and whether the impact of the SP can be effectively diminished using analytical methods. In the first part of the study we recorded simultaneous EEG and eye movements of subjects performing an object recognition task. We analyzed thousands of saccades of five subjects, characterized the SP spatial, temporal and spectral signature, and evaluated methods for detecting SPs at the absence of an eye-tracker and for suppressing their effect. In the second part, we measured MEG and EOG while subjects performed a visual search within complex colored images. We detected SPs in the EOG traces using methods developed in the first phase and used these to assess the presence of SP effects in saccade-related magnetic fields.",

One of the best characterized examples of A-to-I RNA editing is the Q/R site of the GluR-B subunit of the AMPA glutamate receptor, where A is converted to I at nearly 100% by ADAR2. This editing site is highly conserved between species, and rodent studies have shown decreased editing at this site results in a lethal epileptic-like phenotype, arising from altered conformation of the GluR-B that leads to excessive Ca2+ influx. Rapid changes in Ca2+ concentrations often accompany periods of learning (siqiong et al., 2006), and are an integral component of cellular plasticity phenomena such as LTP. Alterations in A-to-I RNA editing impact on LTP (ingo et al., 2006) and editing is decreased in the brain during early developmental stages. We hypothesized that decreases in A-to-I RNA editing also occur transiently in adult animals, following periods of intense learning. We exposed rats to a protocol of contextual fear conditioning, a hippocampus-dependent task, and measured the rate of RNA editing and ADAR expression levels in the hippocampus. The results of this study shed light on the role played by AMPA receptor plasticity in hippocampus-dependent learning.",

When we compared receptive fields for pulse trains, we observed a significant decrease of selectivity in neuronal responses from aged animals. This decrease in selectivity led, on the population level, to an increase in signal correlations and a decreased efficiency in encoding of speech signals. Our results are in line with the reported down regulation of the inhibitory transmitter system in aged animals.

Yet most studies of auditory spatial processing use static stimuli. This is mainly due to the difficulties of producing well controlled acoustic motion. Here we aim to overcome this difficulty by implementing an accurate off-line algorithm to simulate acoustic motion at any desired direction and velocity. We used a set of head related transfer functions (HRTFs) measured from the barn owl to present, through earphones, static as well as moving acoustic stimuli that are spatially defined in virtual acoustic space (VAS). Motion in VAS was obtained using an algorithm developed by Jacobson, Poganiatz and Nelken (Journal of neuroscience Methods, 2001) in which the measured HRTFs are linearly interpolated in space and time. Using this setup we characterized the responses of auditory space specific neurons from the barn owl's optic tectum. The VAS responses were compared with responses of the same neurons to stimuli in binaural space (ITD/ILD) and to stimuli in visual space. First, we report that the acoustic receptive fields (ARFs) obtained with static stimuli are correlated with those obtained in binaural and visual space, similar to the correlations reported in free field experiments. We also show a general correspondence between the positions of the motion and static ARFs. These results validate our technique. Second, we compared between ARFs obtained by left to right motion with those obtained by right to left motion. Interestingly, the horizontal position of the ARF depended on the direction of motion; the receptive field shifted towards the origin of the movement. It has been suggested in the literature that such directional shifts towards moving stimuli may underlie the behavioral ability to predict the location of a moving stimulus. To our knowledge, this work is the first to show this effect with fully cued auditory motion.",

However, there is a paucity of animal studies focused on cognitive impairments in PD. Among the various toxic models of PD, the MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6- tetrahydropyridine) model has become the most commonly used. The mouse MPTP model with marked depletion of dopamine (DA) in striatum is defined with behavioural impairments, that are usually only of motor origin. In the present study we were able to show cognitive impairments, as well as motor impairments following MPTP lesion in mice. Mice were injected with MPTP (IP, 40 mg/kg MPTP), daily for 5 days. Rota Rod,(RR); Passive avoidance (PA); and social recognition (SR) test were all performed on day 11. Rota od: A statistically significant reduction in time spent on the RR, a motor test, was observed in MPTP-treated compared to control group. This observation was also supported by a similarly statistically significant reduction in distance travelled on the RR. Social recognition test: The SR test measures memory on the basis of olfactory cues. MPTP lesion animals showed a social memory effect by spending significantly more time investigating the same juvenile animal following subsequent exposure, compared to the control. Passive avoidance test. Single-trial (step-through) PA test measures short and long-term memory process for aversive stimuli. Retention latency to enter the dark compartment in MPTP mice was significantly lower than the control animals . Our study reveals cognitive deficits as a result of MPTP lesion, along with the usual motor deficits. Thus, we have tailored a battery of tests that predict whether tested item can reverse or protect against motor as well as cognitive deficits in a mouse model of PD.",

While the acquisition of fear memory is mainly dependent on the amygdala, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) plays a critical role in the consolidation of extinction memories. AKT (also known as PKB), is one of the kinases that form the PI3 kinase cascade which has been found vital in cell proliferation and prevention of apoptosis. In the brain, activation of AKT via phosphorylation has been implicated in formation of long-term memory and synaptic plasticity. This study aimed to investigate in the adult rat, the role of the AKT in the mPFC and the amygdala during acquisition and extinction of conditioned fear memory. The AKT inhibitor LY294004 was injected into either the basolateral amygdala (BLA) or the mPFC at different time points. Microinjection of the AKT phosphorylation inhibitor into the mPFC 15 minutes after fear conditioning or before retrieval of extinction memory did not affect the behavioral output. However, the microinjection of the AKT inhibitor into the mPFC immediately after the first extinction session resulted in impairment in consolidation of long-term extinction memory, suggesting a role of AKT phosphorylation in the mPFC in extinction consolidation, but not in acquisition or consolidation of conditioned fear. In contrast, the LY294004 microinjection into the BLA after fear conditioning resulted in increased freezing levels but not after the first extinction day, suggesting that AKT phosphorylation in the amygdala is required for consolidation of fear memory but not for the consolidation of extinction of conditioned fear. These results point to differential involvement of AKT during acquisition and extinction of fear conditioning in the mPFC-amygdala circuit and potentially contribute to understanding and treatment of anxiety disorders.",

Recently, we extended this feed-forward-only framework to a more powerful multivariate self- and mutually-exciting Hawkes model class that can fit spike trains with more complex multicorrelation structure.

Stressful stimuli, food deprivation and leptin administration remarkably alter hypothalamic CRFR2 expression, suggesting an important role for this receptor in regulating energy homeostasis during challenge. To examine the role of CRFR2, expressed by the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), in modulating energy balance, a lentiviral-based system for site-specific knockdown (KD) of CRFR2 was established and VMH-specific CRFR2 KD mice were generated. Mice were tested both on basal conditions and following exposure to physiological perturbations to homeostasis. Reduced expression of VMH-CRFR2 did not affect basal metabolic parameters suggesting that under basal state VMH-CRFR2 does not play a crucial role in maintaining energy homeostasis. However, exposure to stressors reveals its regulatory physiological significance. In the 24 h period following food deprivation challenge, in order to regain energy homeostasis, control mice increased their food intake and reduced their physical activity. In contrast, CRFR2 KD mice increased their food intake only up to 75% of the control mice, did not reduce their activity level, and showed reduced respiratory exchange ratio (RER) during the light phase compared to control group. This maladaptive recovery suggests that hypothalamic CRFR2 signaling is essential for re-establishing homeostasis following metabolic challenge. Glucose tolerance test profile of CRFR2-KD mice was similar to that of the control mice while insulin tolerance test profile revealed reduced insulin sensitivity in these mice compared to control. The reduced insulin sensitivity may be a consequence of reduced suppression of the counterregulatory responses. Our results support an important role for VMH-CRFR2 neurons in the control of food intake and energy expenditure in response to homeostatic challenge and suggest a role for these neurons in glucose sensing",

The neuronal survival effect is further reflected by the prevention of 3-morpholinosydnonimine-induced protein nitration, inhibition of caspase 3 activation, as well as attenuation of 6-hydroxydopamine-mediated decrease in growth associated protein-43 levels. The iron(III) corrole, but not manganese (III) corrole, also significantly promotes neuronal survival of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2))-impaired SH-SY5Y and NSC-34 cells. A substantial superiority of the metallocorroles relative to the corresponding porphyrin complexes is revealed in all examined aspects.

We chose eighteen odorants that mutually span pleasantness as well as the principal physico-chemical axis. Due to experimental time constraints within subjects, EOlfGs were recorded in three sets of six odorants each. In each set, the odorants were diluted with heated (36\u00b0C) humidified (80%) air inside the olfactometer to obtain equated perceived intensities. An overall flow of 5.5l/min and maximum partial odorant flow of 3l/min were kept. ISI = 45 s, Stim. Dur. = 0.5 s, 4-5 events per condition, Sampling rate = 1 kHz. Subjects held their breath 1.5 s before stimulus onset and 3 s thereafter. Following each trial subjects rated pleasantness and intensity. We found that EOlfGs distances better correlated with distances in the perceived pleasantness (r = 0.405, p < E-9) than with the stimuli chemical euclidean distance (r = 0.141, p = .034).

It is well known that plasticity is associated with alteration in synaptic strength and efficacy. Some of these effects correlate with changes in the levels of synaptic proteins (Jaaskelainen et al. 2007; Martin et al. 2000). However, the implications of genetic alteration in synaptic proteins on the network activity of neurons are not known. We examine the effect of DOC2B, a synaptic neuronal Ca2+ sensor that is known for its ability to enhance synaptic transmission, on neuronal network activity (Friedrich et al. 2008). For that purpose we use MicroElectrode Array (MEA) technology to simultaneously record action potentials from multiple neurons in ex vivo neuronal network. Proteins overexpression is achieved by viral infection and fluorescent-microscopy combined with long-term time-lapse imaging is employed to study the kinetics of the overexpression. Overexpression of DOC2B leads to a distinctive increase in the durations of neuronal network spikes bursting activities and noticeable change in the spiking order within the bursts. Furthermore, it changes the distribution of the spikes in the burst, leading to an increased spiking activity mainly after the burst peaks. Moreover, electrical stimulation of DOC2B-enhanced neuronal culture unveils its role in facilitating synaptic replenishment. This unique combination of genetic manipulation on the neuronal network level complements and extends our understandings of the role of DOC2B in synaptic transmission. It has been previously suggested that synchronized bursting activities may be templates for modifications of network-wide neuronal plasticity (Baruchi and Ben-Jacob 2007). Together, we suggest a novel role for DOC2B \u2013 tuning of synaptic plasticity to allow imprint of activity patterns.",

TRPC2 (transient receptor potential channel) mutant mice, are unable to detect pheromonal cues via the vomeronasal organ, and thus, both males and females knockouts (KO) express unique behavioral profile towards conspecifics. Specifically, males show increased sexual behavior towards other males and very low inter-male aggression; females show increased sexual behavior towards both males and females. Using microdialysis technique we aim to characterize changes in brain monoamine levels of both TRPC2 KO and control mice, while exposed to either male/female social stimuli. Focusing on the nucleus accumbens (NAc) as part of the reward brain system, we propose to elucidate the role of pheromonal detection in the rewarding properties of both sexual and aggressive behaviors. Based on a previous work (Chengjie et al., 2008), we developed a protocol for detecting DA, 5-HT and 5-HIAA in small CSF volumes of 12 microlitter and less, using UPLC- MS/MS. Here we will present preliminary results of the monoamine changes in the CSF within the NAc of TRPC2 heterozygouts (control) male mice while exposed to females and manifest sexual behaviors. As expected, we observed a rise in DA levels while the female is presented and then a decline. Also 5-HT levels increase moderately throughout the exposure. These results support the efficiency of our new protocol for UPLC-MS/MS analysis of small CSF volumes, and promote our ongoing research. On further steps, we will continue characterizing the rewarding aspects (neurobiochemically and behaviorally) of both TRPC2 mutant and control mice exposed to either pheromonal or social stimuli of males and females.",

Therefore, it was of interest to study the effect of chronic exposure of minute doses of VX on rat brain biomarkers. The present study was aimed toward examining possible correlation of histopathology with putative cognitive deficits following chronic VX exposure in rats. Rats were exposed using osmotic mini-pumps either at asymptomatic dose (13.5 \u03bcg/kg/day) or symptomatic dose (18 \u03bcg/kg/day) of VX for a period of one month. Cresyl Violet staining was uncapable of detecting any cellular damage, although space enlargement between the nuclei at the hippocampus CA2 region was noted. These findings were further supported by using confocal analysis for NeuN labeling. MAP2 immunolabeling, presenting the neuron-specific cytoskeletal proteins in the brain, demonstrated a decreased immunoreactivity in dendrites processes and increased immunreactivity in cell bodies of CA2 pyramidal cells, thalamus and pyriform cortex neurons. GFAP labeling of astrocytes revealed activated astrocytes in all brain regions. We have further examined the possible implications of these histopathological abnormalities on cognitive function. We demonstrate no difference in both Passive Avoidance (PA) and Morris Water Maze (MWM) tests, between control, sham operated and VX-treated rats (13.5 \u03bcg/kg/day). These findings indicate no deficits in reference and working memory despite the observed neuropathology. In contrast, VX-treated rats at 18 \u03bcg/kg/day exhibited motor/emotional deficits. In summary, our data suggest that further studies are required for elucidating the role of cellular and cytoskeletal proteins involved in mediating VX neurotoxicity especially at low doses. Such studies will help in understanding the physiological effects of brain pathology following chronic VX exposure.",

NGF-induced phosphorylation of these pathways in ECs had transient effect compared with prolonged effect in neurons. These results propose that NGF-induced signaling in ECs supports pro-angiogenic activity, as opposed to differentiation in neurons. Furthermore, using an oxygen-glucose deprivation, ischemia-like model, it was shown that NGF-induced protection of ECs was dose-dependent and that this effect was inhibited by K252a, a NGF-TrkA receptor antagonist. Attenuation of ischemia-induced Erk1/2 phosphorylation was correlated with NGF-induced protection. These results emphasize the importance of NGF in the survival of brain microcapillary ECs in response to ischemic injury. In another set of experiments, the secretion patterns of NGF from brain and heart vascular beds were measured. In normoxic conditions NGF was released by brain and by heart ECs. In ischemic conditions the NGF secretion from ECs derived from both organs was blocked. This response of brain microcapillary ECs implies that under ischemic insult the major source of NGF for endogenous neuroprotection are neurons and glia but not ECs.",

The olivo-cerebellar loop, the fundamental component of the cerebellar module, is comprised of inhibitory connections between the Purkinje cells (PCs) and the cerebellar nuclei (CN); inhibitory connections between the CN and the inferior olive (IO) and excitatory input from the olivary neurons onto PCs. In this study, optogenetic approach was used to investigate the functional role of the inhibitory connections between the CN and the IO using specific stimulation of olivary inputs. Immunocytochemistry of the Thy1-COP4 transgenic mice revealed expression of the light-gated cation channel, channel rhodopsin2 (ChR2), in GABAergic cells of the CN. IO neurons were devoid of ChR2, although great amount of labeled fibers were seen in the nucleus. Indeed, light stimulation of CN cells during whole cell patch recordings in acute slices, resulted in a depolarizing event which was modulated according to the duration and intensity of the light. Whole cell patch recordings from IO cells, combined with light stimulations, also resulted in significant responses. As oppose to the responses in CN neurons, the responses of olivary neurons was clearly synaptic responses, namely the light activated presynaptic axons. Both excitatory and inhibitory responses were recorded. The inhibitory response, that had a reversal potential of about -60 mV, markedly affected the subthreshold oscillations; Persistent subthreshold oscillations were readily and reversibly annihilated. On other occasions quiescent neurons had started oscillating upon light activation. EPSPs could also be evoked by light stimulation. These potentials, although failed to affect the subthreshold oscillations could easily derive the cells to fire. In conclusion, these findings indicate that GABAergic CN cells can modulate the subthreshold oscillations in IO cells, enabling us to study the role of the CN input on the functional organization of IO network.",

Non-collinear configuration (parallel, side-by-side, SBS) produces less facilitation. Surprisingly, presentation of COL and SBS configurations simultaneously (CROSS) abolishes the facilitation rather than increases it - a phenomenon that has not been well understood. In our previous study we explored the effect of cancelled facilitation using ERP recording and found that the latency of SBS is delayed by about 10 ms compared to COL, suggesting that the facilitatory process is selectively cancelled due to a backward masking effect by the delayed signal from the SBS. Here we report results from study (behaviour and ERP) in which we presented the flankers before (20, 40, 60 ms) the other configurations (forward masking). We found that the presentation of the SBS flankers 20 ms before the CROSS, recovered the facilitation. Moreover, forward presentation of 20 ms, (but not 40 or 60) enhanced the response speed (shorter latency) by about 10 ms. The results support the idea that propagation of COL signal is faster than of the SBS signal, consistent with our earlier findings that training on collinear facilitation shortens the latency. They also confirm our suggestion that SBS produce a temporal mismatch that cancels the facilitation in the CROSS condition. The results also show that forward presentation overcomes the temporal mismatch, hence recovering the facilitation. Thus, spatial configurations of simultaneous stimuli might produce a decoralation of the internal response and alter our perception.",

Our laboratory has characterized many neurons that organizes Aplysia feeding behavior, and has also developed a learning paradigm affecting feeding - Learning That Food Is Inedible (LFI).",

Pheromones usually reach the VNO through the nasal cavity by active sniffing. However, non-volatile pheromones can also reach the VNO through a much less studied pathway: the nasopalatine ducts which connect the VNO with the upper palate of the mouth. We explored the function of the ducts as an integral part of the vomeronasal system in mice by permanently blocking their oral entrance using a surgical cautery device. We subsequently exposed male and female mice to urine collected from mice of the opposite sex, and examined c-Fos expression in the medial amygdala as a marker for neuronal activity and pheromone detection. Our results revealed that both female and male mice with blocked ducts presented significantly reduced neuronal activity in the anterior and posterior medial amygdala when compared to mice with intact ducts. Furthermore, the neuronal activity of the blocked mice was similar in magnitude to the one observed in the medial amygdala of control mice that were exposed only to distal water stimuli. Taken together, our results suggest that pheromoneal transfer to the VNO is significantly diminished by blocking the ducts, which might imply a great importance of this pathway in regulating innate sexual and social behaviors.",

Pheromone signals, which carry the social cues, can reach the vomeronasal organ (VNO) either by the nasal cavity or by the oral cavity, via the nasopalatine ducts. Surprisingly, several structures of taste buds were found just at the entrance to the nasopalatine ducts in many animal species, but their functional roles were never examined. Using histological and immunochemistry methods we identified a significantly different morphological pattern of these taste buds in the ducts of wild-caught mice when compared to regular lab mice. Although the taste buds in both wild-caught and lab mice are located at the same anatomical position at the entrance of the ducts, wild-caught mice have twice as much taste buds as lab mice, and an increased density of them along the ducts. In addition, the pore of each taste bud was identified and marked, and its distance from the entrance of the nasopalatine duct was calculated. The results revealed a significantly different distribution pattern of the taste buds in wild caught and lab mice. Considering the distinct location of the taste buds at the entrance of the ducts and the behavioral differences between wild-caught and lab mice, we wish to suggest that these taste buds might function in cooperation the VNO as a dual sensory system for detecting and encoding pheromones, much like the reported sensory integration of the sense of taste and the primary olfactory system.",

In our research, we kinematically analyze this movement in two stages: Analysis of a single arm attending the move and analysis of the coordination between the attending arms. This research poses a biological question, but it is also a part of an ongoing project of the UI intended for designing and building bio-inspired robots with embodied intelligent. Our project is aimed to assist in building an octopus robot, which will be able to crawl independently or with human control. Adult animals are put in shallow water and video-recorded from underneath while crawling. The video-clip is then cut into singe frames. Using a designated software we developed for this purpose, the location and state (attached to the surface or not) of the arm suckers that are attending the movement are marked on all frames. The data is then analyzed to reveal the kinematic properties of the arm and of the coordination between the arms during the crawling movement. While crawling, the octopus uses only the arms opposite to the crawling direction for pushing its body. It does not utilize pulling or paddle-like pushing. One to four arms can attend the move simultaneously and the direction and speed of crawling is the combined vector of those arms. While crawling, the orientation of the octopus does not change. The single arm pushing is performed in five stages:(1) shortening the proximal part to some percent of its basic length,(2) attaching to the surface with some proximal suckers,(3) elongating its proximal part to be longer then its basic length,(4) releasing the attached suckers and (5) shortening again to its basic length. As seen in other movements of the octopus, it greatly reduces the number of Degrees Of Freedom while crawling, which greatly reduces the complexity of the calculations needed to perform the move.",

Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model is commonly used to study pathogenesis of the disease and to test new therapeutic approaches. Understanding the mechanisms leading to cumulative neurological disability in MS, and further developing effective therapeutic strategies aiming at reduced disease progression is a major goal in MS research. The class A macrophage scavenger receptors (SR-A) have been implicated in inflammation-associated physiological and pathological processes such as in atherosclerosis.

The effect and time line in which APOE-e4 influence the neurodegenerative diseases is not known, but previous studies showed significant brain differences in non affected individuals. Brain structural differences were shown as early as 50 years old, and glucose metabolitic differences in the brain were shown even in young 20 years old normal subjects. In our study 52 young healthy Ashkenazi Jews (ages 20-35), underwent a battery of cognitive tests (data not shown here), an MRI protocol which included DTI, structural T1 and T2 map. In addition the subjects gave either saliva or blood sample for further genotyping. Among the 52 total subjects, 29 were APOE-33, 11 were APOE-34, 8 were APOE-23, 2 were APOE-24 and 2 were APOE44. The structural T1 was used for VBM analysis and the T2 and DTI were used in VBA analysis. The DTI showed mainly significant differences in the parahippocampal gyrus, the hippocampus and the globus pallidus. VBM showed mainly significant differences in the parahippocampal gyrus, the hippocampus, the orbitofrontal cortex, and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The brain differences that were found in this study are known to exist in old ages (50 years and above). By minimizing the genetic variance in our sample (only Ashkenazi Jews), and as a result of new and improved methodologies and the microstructural sensitivity of DTI we managed to show that this differences exist from early life stages. One implications of our study is that the influence of APOE4 presence is very strong in developmental stages.",

To study interactions between the cortex and basal ganglia we recorded, simultaneously, local field potentials (LFPs) from deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) signals from the cerebral cortex (CTF 275 channel system) from 17 Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with bilateral DBS electrodes in the subthalamic nucleus (STN). The patients performed self-initiated button presses, either with three fingers simultaneously (simple movements) or as a sequence (complex movements). The experiment was repeated with and without the dopamine prodrug levodopa. We examined the effect of movement complexity and drug on event-related power in the contralateral primary motor cortex (M1) and STN and on the coherence between activity in the two structures. Changes in mean power were similar in the two structures, but with the important exception that only M1 exhibited prolonged high gamma (50-90 Hz) activity in the complex task. Levodopa led to a wide-band increase in reactivity around movement onset in M1, but this effect was limited to the gamma band in the STN. There was also a significant increase in high-gamma coherence between M1 and STN around movement onset. This increase in coherence was potentiated by levodopa, but unaffected by complexity. The magnitude of the effect of treatment on the coherence between M1 and STN correlated with the degree of improvement in bradykinesia-rigidity. While high baseline coherence between M1 and STN was found in the beta band, this was only weakly modulated by movement and treatment. Our results demonstrate that movement-related spectral changes in M1 and STN reflect coupled but distinct physiological processes. We also demonstrate for the first time the clinical relevance of high-gamma coherence between the cortex and the basal ganglia.",

We used odors as reinforcers because the olfactory system gains unique and direct access into the amygdala, and because odors are powerful primitive reinforces that elicit emotions. In addition, odorants provide a unique opportunity to compare positive and negative reinforcers of the same modality, by using pleasant and aversive odors. We developed an implicit behavioral measure to quantify valence and learning, by real-time monitoring of respiration cycles (breathing). Using it, we show that animals modify their breathing rate and reduce volume of breathing following a tone that predicts an aversive odor, and enhanced breathing towards a pleasant odor. We recorded single-cell activity (n = 327) in the amygdala of two behaving monkeys (macaque fascicularis), during acquisition, extinction, and 24-hr retention of such associations. We have found periodic activity of neurons in the amygdala that locked to breath cycle, and show that the periodic activity is flexible and change during the different stages of the paradigm. In addition, we identified separate groups of neurons that code acquisition, extinction and 24 hours retention of the tone-odor association.",

This unique population has been hypothesized to serve a role in the network's plasticity by the mere addition of young neurons to the network. In accordance with this hypothesis, immature neurons show enhanced structural and functional plasticity in response to manipulations of sensory experience. However, it remains unclear whether adult-born neurons retain their capacity for enhanced plasticity after they mature. To address this question, we labeled adult-born neurons with a GFP-tagged postsynaptic marker (PSD95-GFP), rendering their dendrites and putative synapses (PSD95-GFP puncta) visible. After adult-born neurons matured (~80 days post injection; DPI), we combined intrinsic signal imaging and in vivo time-lapse two-photon imaging of their dendrites and puncta. This enabled us to examine the effects of sensory enrichment on structural and synaptic dynamics in enriched and non-enriched loci in the same animal. Sensory enrichment did not affect the dendritic morphology of mature adult-born periglomerular neurons (PGNs; n = 9 and n = 7 neurons from enriched and non enriched foci, respectively; N = 6 mice). In contrast, sensory experience doubled the level of PSD95-GFP puncta stability specifically in enriched loci (turnover ratio: 0.04 \u00b1 0.004 in enriched and 0.08 \u00b1 0.01 in non-enriched loci, n = 454 and n = 536 puncta, respectively; N = 5 mice, p = 0.006). Notably, this effect was specific to mature adult-born PGNs, as the spine dynamics of mature adult-born granule cells were not affected. Our work, therefore, provides evidence that synapses of mature adult-born PGNs, stabilize in face of sensory experience. This stability is different from that observed in young PGNs. Thus, in addition to young adult-born PGNs, mature adult-born PGNs might endow the olfactory bulb network with a long lasting substrate for plasticity.",

However, the behavioral speed and neuronal reliability of this system suggest that a temporal coding scheme might be used to encode sensory stimuli. Here we show that the relative timing of the first impulses in an ensemble of neurons accurately and reliably conveys whisker velocity. We show that stimulus onset time can be estimated using stimulus-independent response latency of rapidly adapting neurons, while stimulus identity can be gauged by stimulus-dependent first spike latency of slowly adapting neurons. This estimation is robust, and is not affected by the addition of noise, or change of whiskers' resting position and direction of motion. This mechanism allows primary afferents to rapidly and reliably transmit tactile information with the very first spikes emitted by neuronal population.",

However, due to motion artifacts, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of WG commonly employ either covert versions of the task, lacking an online record of subjects' responses, or paced versions which hinder the self-initiation aspect. In the current study we have addressed this problem by creating a novel WG task, in which subjects are instructed to type self-generated words. The experiment consisted of two blocks: self-initiated and externally-driven, which were similar in visual and motor aspects, but differed in the type of generation. In self-initiated blocks, four letters were presented on a computer screen and subjects were required to self-generate as many meaningful words as possible, using the presented letters only, similarly to Scrabble. In externally-driven blocks, subjects were presented with four different letters and were signaled to type words that were chosen a priori. Seven subjects participated in the fMRI experiment. Contrasting brain activity during self-initiated blocks versus externally-driven blocks, self-initiative states were characterized in an overall increase in activity in right and left ACC, pre-SMA, SMA and dlPFC, as well as Broca's area in the left inferior frontal gyrus. This data is in accord with previous results based on covert and paced WG tasks.

Accordingly, we showed that the combined action of dexamethasone (DEX) and norepinephrine (NE), representing stress and antidepressant treatment, respectively, have an augmented effect on both the MAPK and the CREB pathways. The aim of this study was to substantiate a clinical relevance for this intracellular augmentation. Similarly to our previous findings with DEX + NE, we showed that prolonged stress, caused by pre-exposure of SH-SY5Y cells to DEX, followed by the addition of desipramine (DMI, a tricyclic antidepressant) caused an enhancement in MAPK pathway and CREB compared to DMI alone. DEX alone had no such effect. However, the enhancement caused by the co-treatment was blocked by both yohimbine and RU486, adrenergic (AR) and glucocorticoid (GR) receptors antagonists, respectively. We therefore suggested that co-treatment enhancement is caused by DEX effect on b-arrestin-induced internalization of AR. Our previous findings showed that b-arrestin is recruited to the membrane following treatment with NE, whereas following the co-treatment it is much more diffused throughout the cell. Imunofluorescence assessment showed a DEX-induced increase in b-arrestin density inside the cell, which was inhibited by RU486. Receptor internalization is rapidly modulated by Mdm2 (E3 ubiquitin ligase) binding to b-arrestin. Indeed, Mdm2 binding to b-arrestin, assessed by immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting, was reduced in the presence of DEX in a time dependent manner. This effect was also abolished by the addition of RU486. The study suggests that DEX, through its interaction with GR, augments DMI intracellular effect by modulating Mdm2-dependent b-arrestin trafficking and thereby delays the internalization of the AR. This mechanism may contribute to the therapeutic effects of antidepressants in MD.",

In the Manipulation, three weeks later, false memories were induced using a memory questionnaire planted with details of scenes never depicted in the movie. In the final Test session, performed one week after the Manipulation, participants completed a questionnaire while undergoing an fMRI scan, and indicated whether described events appeared in the movie or not. Participants endorsed more manipulated items than new ones, but less than movie items, which were also rated with higher confidence and vividness. Participants were classified as Na\u00efve in regard to the manipulation or as Not-Na\u00efve. Na\u00efve participants were less accurate and showed different BOLD patterns. While in both groups activity in the retrieval network was higher for endorsed movie than for manipulation questions, the differences were larger in Not-Na\u00efve. Two regions not in the retrieval network, the left ventral striatum (VS) and the left amygdala, also showed a higher BOLD for movie than for manipulation questions, and only in Not-Na\u00efve the activity in these regions was parametrically correlated with vividness. Notably, BOLD differences between movie and manipulated items were not detected upon equating for confidence and vividness. Finally, we computed the co-activation among the ROI's. While for the Not-Na\u00efve co-activation was similar for movie and manipulated items, in the Na\u00efve the co-activation of the left Ventro-Medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and of the VS with the retrieval network ROIs was markedly lower during manipulation trials.

It has not yet been clarified how stress and specifically the stress hormone, corticosterone, (cortisol in humans) modulates seizures. Two types of receptors, the glucocorticoid (GRs) and mineralocorticoid (MRs), are in charge of the corticosterone effects in the body. Both GRs and MRs can be expressed either at the cell nucleus or at the membrane and therefore play a different roles in cellular functions. We have studied the effects of stress and the targeted activation of GRs and MRs in the modulation of seizures in vivo by using an animal model of status epilepticus. Briefly, kainic acid (10 mg/kg) was. injected i.p. in 1 month old male Wistar rats either 30 s or 1 hr after their exposure to a 15 min. forced swim stress (FSS). Seizures latency was shorter in the animals that received kainic acid 30 s following FSS compared to control and to those treated with kainic acid 1 hr after the FSS. In addition, seizures reached a higher Racine's score in shorter time in the former group compared with controls. Interestingly, injection of diazepam halted seizures faster in the animals that received kainic acid 1 hr after FSS than in those that were treated 30 s following FSS. Surprisingly, blocking MRs or GRs receptors prior to the stressful exposure showed that MRs activation by stress enhanced the effects of kainic acid injection following FSS, while GRs activation suppressed these effects. In an effort to understand the mechanism of the differential MRs and GRs activation on seizures modulation, we performed whole cell patch-clamp recordings in acute slices of the hippocampus. We found that GRs and MRs differently regulate GABA-A currents. Respectively through membrane bound receptors, MRs reduce the frequency of IPSCs while GRs increase IPSCs amplitude. We conclude that stress and activation of MRs and GRs modulate seizures by differential regulation of GABAergic synapses",

The evaluation of stem cell technology using translational animal models is critical to early internal decision-making processes. Today, the paucity of existing disease-modifying agents, coupled with the lack of existing animal models that mimic a given human CNS disorder adequately, only serves as a testament to the complexity of developing CNS therapy.

Only ~50% of these neurons survive to fully-integrate into the pre-existing network and reach maturity. Manipulations of sensory activity and cell-intrinsic excitability have shown that activity is a major regulator of the survival of adult-born neurons. However, the factors that regulate synaptogenesis are still controversial. Here, we addressed this issue by genetically manipulating the presynaptic output activity of adult-born neurons by lentiviral-based expression of tetanus toxin light chain (TeTxLC); a protease which specifically cleaves VAMP2 (a protein essential for presynaptic release), thus inhibiting synaptic release. Using co-injection of TeTxLC-GFP and TdTomato (a red fluorescent protein), we analyzed the effects of TeTxLC expression on granule cell (GC) survival before (14 days post injection - d.p.i.), immediately after (30 d.p.i), and long after (45 d.p.i) presynapse formation. We find that TeTxLC expression decreases the survival of GCs only after presynapse formation (at 30 and 45 d.p.i.). Furthermore, we show that this effect is accompanied by impaired synaptogenesis, in the form of a reduction in the density of GC dendritic spines, as compared to control neurons (only after presynapse formation, at 30 and 45 d.p.i, but not at 14 d.p.i.). We are currently exploring spine dynamics in TeTxLC-expressing GCs using time-lapse in-vivo imaging. Our results suggest that presynaptic release is important for the survival and proper synaptic integration of adult-born neurons in the OB.",

Hippocampal pyramidal cells and granular cells in the dentate gyrus can alter their spatial representation of the environment, or remap, in response to changes in the environment. Such cue manipulation data indicate that the hippocampus can maintain multiple representations of altered environments. Remapping can occur even in a stable environment when the goal location and pathway the animal takes is altered. However, when trajectories are held constant very few cells show remapping. The paucity of remapping despite substantial changes in task demands is puzzling given the presumed role of the hippocampus in processing episodic memory. I will present data on the degree to which ensembles of cells throughout the hippocampus respond to changes in \u201ccognitive\u201d demands despite no apparent change in the physical environment or trajectory taken by the animal.",

While deficits in creativity and divergent thinking are common consequences of lesions to prefrontal cortex (PFC), recent evidence suggest that left fronto-temporal degeneration involving deterioration of language abilities may actually promote artistic creativity (Seeley et al., 2008). Here, we report two lesion studies which demonstrate the inhibiting role of the left fronto-temporal region in creativity. In Experiment 1 patients with localized lesions in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and posterior parietal and temporal cortex (PC) were assessed by two tasks involving divergent thinking and originality. Results of the experiment indicate that lesions in the mPFC involved the most profound impairment in originality and that lesions in the left IFG and left PC were associated with elevated levels of originality. Moreover, a positive correlation between creativity scores and left PC lesions indicated that the larger the lesion in this area the greater the originality. Experiment 2 was a case study of a patient, E.P, who following a left fronto-temporal hemorrhage involving Broca's aphasia exhibited transient artistic creativity. Following a stroke, E.P began to experience a strong drive to paint and gradually, his paintings became more and more complex. Interestingly, as language abilities recuperated and the hemorrhage receded, his urges to create art diminished to the point where he no longer felt the urge to paint at all. We propose a neural and cognitive model of a right fronto-parietal network for creativity. We demonstrate that acquired lesions in the left frontal and parietal lobe are associated with improved originality, while lesions in the right fronto-parietal area are associated with reduced originality, indicating that inter-hemispheric connections may play an inhibiting role on the right hemisphere's role in creativity.",

In the Old/New face experiment, higher number of fixations during the study phase led to greater success in the test phase. Specifically, if a subject made more saccades on a specific face presentation in the study phase, he was more likely to recognize this face during the recognition phase. This was not true for the control (object /pattern) stimuli. To conclude, we found that when recognizing a face, attention to the eyes is essential, while attention to the nose and mouth is not.

In the first, we broadly defined differences in the functional and physical brains of young vs old adults. By virtually every index, old brains were functionally and physically degraded (slower, less accurate, less reliable, noisier, demyelinated, connectionally simplified, disinhibited, etc.) re the young adult brain. We then trained old animals in simple ways that restored (reversed) ALL of the degraded functional and physical indices that characterized the old brain. In a second series of studies, we showed that strategies that substantially increased neural noise in the brain of an animal in the prime of life drove accelerated \u201caging\u201d \u2013 or from another perspective (given the reversible nature of plasticity processes) drove the cortex backward in its functional and physical status, in an infant-ward direction. Two basic conclusions of these studies: 1) From the perspective of fundamental information processing in the brain, very old = very young. 2) Plasticity processes can drive rapid changes in a degrading or a refining direction, at any age in life.",

The TRP super-family is conserved throughout evolution from nematodes to humans. The name TRP is derived from a spontaneously occurring Drosophila mutant lacking TRP that responded to a continuous light with a Transient Receptor Potential (therefore, it was designated TRP by Minke). The Drosophila TRP and TRP-like (TRPL) channels, which are activated by the inositol lipid signaling cascade, were used later on to isolate the first mammalian TRP homologues. TRP channels mediate responses to light, nerve growth factors, pheromones, taste, mechanical, temperature, pH, osmolarity, vasorelaxation of blood vessels, metabolic stress and pain. Furthermore, mutations in members of the TRP family are responsible for several diseases. Although a great deal is known today about members of the mammalian TRP channels, the exact physiological function and gating mechanisms of most channels are still elusive. We discovered that the Drosophila TRP and TRPL are readily activated by metabolic stress. Accordingly, hypoxia rapidly and reversibly open these Ca2+ permeable channels and induces massive Ca2+ influx into the photoreceptor cells in the dark leading to toxic increase in cellular Ca2+. Furthermore, mitochondrial uncouplers or depletion of ATP in photoreceptor cells also induce this effect. Recent studies showed that two members of the mammalian TRP family, TRPM2 and TRPM7 are Ca2+ permeable channels, which are sensitive to oxidative stress and are modulated by PIP2. TRPM2 was shown to be activated by A\u00df and TRPM7 is crucial in neuronal cell death caused by oxidative stress. Together, TRP channels that are both Ca2+ permeable and vulnerable to ischemia constitute a new target for neuroprotecting drugs.",

Previous results in our lab showed that recombinant human AFP (rhAFP) markedly improved the clinical manifestations of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a T cell mediated disease that serves as a model for MS. RhAFP treatment reduced disease severity and CNS inflammation. In the present study, we tested the effect of rhAFP on experimental autoimmune MG (EAMG). MG is a B cell-mediated, T cell-dependent autoimmune disorder due to antibodies directed to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) at the post synaptic membrane. We examined the effect of treatment with rhAFP on EAMG in Lewis rats and c57bl mice. Daily treatment with 60ug/rat/day rhAFP starting from the appearance of the chronic phase reduced both disease severity and its incidence by 42% and 59% respectively. In addition, EAMG rats treated with AFP showed normal response (4.2 + 1.7%) to repetitive nerve stimulation, at 3 Hz, whereas control EAMG rats showed a mean decremental response of 18.8 + 3.2%. Furthermore, immunological examination indicated that rhAFP treatment reduced T-cell reactivity and inflammatory cytokine production both in the rat and mouse models. The ability of the natural protein AFP to affect the immune system makes it a potential candidate for treatment of MG and other autoimmune diseases.",

GPU based analyses of long data stretches of surface EMG (s-EMG) signals recorded from flexors and extensors of the ankle joint in healthy subjects and spinal cord injury patients during various motor tasks, revealed locomotor and spastic-related components that exhibited slow systematic variations with time. Higher-order interactions were observed between 6-8 Hz spastic bursts (myoclonus) and body-weight-supported stepping-rhythm in spinally injured persons. Analyses of the s-EMG intensities calculated using wavelet techniques followed by principal component analysis (PCA), revealed similar spectral patterns in the gait cycle of healthy subjects and variable patterns in different spinal cord injury patients. Further studies are required to clarify whether the combined WT/PCA analyses of s-EMG signals are sufficient to detect and classify the type of damage inflicted on the spinal cord in different spinal cord injury patients.",

For example, research on high-acuity visual perception has focused on the limits imposed by variability of retinal spike responses. However, a second limit results from random eye movements during fixation. We study the effects of both sources of variability on Vernier hyperacuity in estimating a gap between two parallel bars presented simultaneously. Introducing a model of neural variability and eye movement statistics, we exactly derive the optimal estimator of the gap and compare its accuracy with psychophysical data. A main assumption of our model is that the brain estimates the eye position and the gap using exclusively the retinal ganglion cell spike trains. We calculate the exact joint probability distribution for the eye position and the gap in our model and derive the optimal Bayesian estimator. The estimator depends on one dimensionless parameter: the root mean squared displacement of the eyes between subsequent spikes in any two ganglion cells, divided by the receptive field width. For slow eye movements, the decoder uses all the spikes to estimate each bar's position. For fast eye movements, only near-synchronous spike pairs arising from the two bars are used. These spikes provide snapshots of the visual stimulus during brief temporal windows, minimizing blurring due to eye movements. The optimal estimator bounds the performance of biological neural systems on this task. We also construct simpler estimators that could be implemented by neural circuits and analyze their performance. By incorporating temporal filtering in spike generation, our model explains the psychophysical phenomena of Bloch's law, relating the Vernier threshold to stimulus duration and contrast. Our work provides insight into fundamental limitations imposed on the visual system by fixational eye movements and suggests how neural circuits of the visual system may cope with this challenge.",

Since the activity of these cells maps the perceptual attributes of actions performed by others onto the motor repertoire of the perceiver, they have been implicated in various behaviors such as learning by observation, and action understanding. In humans, however, despite indirect evidence suggesting the existence of neuronal networks with similar mirroring properties, direct evidence for mirror neurons was still lacking. In the current study, we recorded extracellular activity of cells in the medial frontal and temporal cortices of patients undergoing clinical evaluation for potential surgical treatment of epilepsy while they passively observed or actively executed goal-directed actions. Our results indicate that not only pre-motor brain regions, but also regions involved in perception and memory contain cells with mirroring properties.

In this study we aimed to isolated cardiotonic peptides from Aiptasia diaphana, characterize its chemical properties and its physiological effects on isolated rat's cardiomyocytes. Column chromatography was used to fractionate proteins from the whole body crude water extract of the Aiptasia. The fractions were examined for their effects on cardiomyocytes contractility. Novel cardioactive peptide, AdE-1, with a molecular weight of 4907D was isolated. Full length cDNA encoding AdE-1 was identified by degenerate RT-PCR, 3' and 5'RACE. Amino acid (AA) sequence of the precursors was deduced from the cDNA sequence, revealed a 46AA leader and mature peptide of 44 AA which shares low sequence identity with other toxins identified to date. AdE-1 increases the amplitude and slows the relaxation velocity of cardimyocyte contractions. It prolonged the action potential (AP) and decreased its amplitude. AdE-1 inhibits Na + current inactivation and increases its amplitude and In contrast to other recognized toxins, it significantly increased the transient K + current's amplitude and shifted the current threshold to a more negative membrane potential. Collectively- AdE-1 prolongs AP duration, augments contraction and decreases AP amplitude of the cardiomyocytes, apparently by modulating the Na + and K + currents. AdE-1 is probably the first peptide to be characterized which increases the Na + and transient K + currents simultaneously. The chemical and physiological uniqueness of AdE-1 make it an invaluable research tool and potential target for drug development.",

In many cases habituation is specific to the stimulus. At the neuronal level, stimulus-specific adaptation (SSA) is a phenomenon in which the response is decreased when the same stimulus is repetitively presented and recovers when a different stimulus is presented. Neural SSA resembles in many aspects the typical habituation pattern and thus may act as a basic neuro-correlate of behavioral habituation. However, a major caveat of this hypothesis is that SSA in the auditory system has been mostly demonstrated with stimuli presented at inter stimulus intervals (ISIs) of 1-2 sec. Behavioral habituation, on the other hand, is achieved to stimuli presented at intervals of tens of seconds to minutes. This dramatic time gap obscures the attempts to link SSA with habituation. In the current research we aimed to overcome this gap by studying neural adaptation to stimuli with long ISIs. For this purpose, we presented sequences of sounds with ISIs of 10, 15 and 60 sec. We first report that the auditory responses of neurons in the optic tectum (a mid-brain gaze control center) significantly adapt at all ISIs tested (up to 60 s). By presenting an alternating train consisting of two different stimuli we show that this adaptation is specific to the stimulus and therefore can serve as a neural-correlate of behavioral habituation. Second, we recorded from different areas along the auditory pathways and found no adaptation at long ISIs in the thalamo-fugal pathway but clear adaptation in the tectofugal pathway. The results suggest that the tecto-fugal but not the thalamo-fugal pathway is related to behavioral habituation in the owl.",

Numerous studies have implicated dysregulation of stress-response mechanisms in the etiology of stress-induced psychopathophysiologies. The urocortin neuropeptides are members of the corticotropin-releasing factor family and are associated with the central stress response. In the current study, a triple-knockout (tKO) mouse model lacking all three urocortin genes was generated. Intriguingly, these urocortin tKO mice exhibit increased anxiety-like behaviors 24 h following stress exposure but not under unstressed conditions or immediately following exposure to acute stress. The inability of these mutants to recover properly from the exposure to an acute stress was associated with robust alterations in the expression profile of amygdalar genes and with dysregulated serotonergic function in stress-related neurocircuits. These findings position the urocortins as essential factors in the stress-recovery process and suggest the tKO mouse line as a useful stress-sensitive mouse model. The authors Neufeld-Cohen A. and Tsoory M.M. contributed equally to this study.",

TLR signaling may play roles in the pathogenesis of stroke, Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis and may also influence multiple dynamic processes in the developing and adult central nervous system including neurogenesis, axonal growth and synaptic plasticity. Using mice deficient for TLR3 (TLR3-/-), mice treated with intracerebroventricular infusion of TLR3-specific agonists, as well as lentiviral mediated overexpression and knockdown of TLR3, we have characterized the roles of TLR3 in mediating hippocampus-dependant cognitive learning and memory processes. TLR3 deficiency in mice resulted in enhanced hippocampus-dependent working memory in the Morris water maze, novel object recognition and contextual fear conditioning tasks. In contrast, intracerebroventricular infusion of a TLR3 agonist to the lateral ventricles resulted in impaired working memory. Additionally, TLR3 deficiency impaired amygdala-related behavior and anxiety in the cued-fear conditioning, open field and elevated plus maze tasks. We further investigated neuroanatomical and molecular changes in the hippocampus of TLR3-/- mice, and found that TLR3-/- mice exhibited increased hippocampal CA1 and dentate gyrus volumes, increased hippocampal neurogenesis and elevated levels of GluR1 in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. In addition, levels of active ERK and CREB were elevated in the hippocampus of TLR3-/- mice, suggesting that constitutive TLR3 signaling negatively regulates pathways known to play important roles in hippocampal plasticity. Similarly to rodents, in which genetic deletion of TLR3 enhanced working memory, humans with SNPs in different introns of their TLR3 gene showed altered performance in working memory tasks. Our findings reveal novel roles for TLR3 as a suppressor of hippocampal cellular-plasticity and working memory retention.",

However, this methodology was limited used to explore the phenotypic variability of neuroimaging findings in familial idiopathic basal ganglia calcification (Fahr\u00b4s Disease). Idiopathic brain calcinosis presents a heterogeneous clinical profile, including a variable combination of motor and cognitive symptoms. Some individuals may be symptom free despite having extensive deposits; however, symptomatic subjects have a significantly larger number of deposits in comparison to asymptomatic subjects. In this study we performed 3D models analysis from the 2D cross-section computerized tomography (CT) and Nuclear Magnetics resonance (NMR) images available from 6 families. Some of them were also genotyped for a candidate polymorphism.We have observed a constant autossomal dominant pattern of inheritance, additional evidence for heritability for lesions placement, and curiously, milder or absent symptoms in patients with cerebellum calcifications. Despite extensive calcifications in some asymptomatic cases, the apparent functionality of affected brain structures is remarkably efficient, suggesting an intrinsic compensation mechanism and also a threshold for triggering. Further case studies and genetics approaches are needed to elicit this and other important questions towards the explanation of the heritability for basal ganglia calcifications and its patterns of anatomical distribution. The study of new families with this condition will be crucial to confirm our findings.",

The paralemniscal system, carrying whisking signals, ascends through the posterior complex (POm) of the thalamus. In this study, the whisking behavior of freely-moving rats in a natural-like environment was recorded using high-speed, high-resolution videography at times prior to and following inactivation of the POm using a GABAA-agonist, muscimol. Subsequent analysis of these videos showed that total whisking power between 5 and 25 Hz (the range of whisking frequencies for rats) declines significantly after inactivation of the POm in comparison to power levels before inactivation. Analysis of whisking trajectories revealed that the mean amplitude and duration of both protraction and retraction decreases significantly after POm inactivation. These effects depended on the concentration of muscimol; in spatial and concentration controls no significant effects were observed. These results suggest that the POm is part of the loop(s) that control whisking behavior.",

However, it was shown that strong stimulation disperses the synapsins from the synapses into the axon, in parallel to the mobilization of reserve vesicles from the vesicle clusters. Because phosphorylation changes the affinity of the synapsins to the cytoskeleton, it has been assumed that this serves as a switch for vesicle mobilization. However, we now show that when neurons are rendered incapable of exocytosis by either Tetanus Toxin or by deletion of Munc13, the synapsins did not disperse from the presynaptic puncta during strong stimulation, even though they were phosphorylated. This indicates that phosphorylation of the synapsins is insufficient to induce vesicle mobilization, even though it does modulate the affinity of the synapsins to the cytoskeleton and to the vesicles. Furthermore, we find that blockage of endocytosis, without affecting exocytosis, also blocks synapsin redistribution, but not its phosphorylation. This suggests a vital role for endocytosis in synaptic vesicle mobilization process. We propose that endocytosis activates a signaling feedback route to the mobilization of the reserve pool.",

Experimental studies in human and rodents have confirmed that a relatively short exposure to low doses of OP during perinatal periods can cause cognitive deficits. OPs act as acetylcholinesterase-inhibitors (AChE-I). The developing brain may be particularly vulnerable to OPs, because of the role of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) on neuronal development and the effects of cholinergic pathways on the behavioral and hormonal response to stress. In addition, a growing body of evidence has shown that exposure to AChE-Is or stress induce the expression of the rare 'readthrough' splice variant of AChE, AChE-R and may play a role in modulating the fear response.",

Here we focus on parameter coding by hippocampal primary neurons. The hippocampus serves an important role in learning and memory. In humans, it is associated with declarative episodic memory. Single unit recordings of hippocampal neurons in freely behaving rats have shown that many of them act as place-cells, confining their firing to well-defined locations in space. We recorded the activity of hippocampal primary neurons in a specially devised olfactory space, in which rats foraged for reward based solely on olfactory cues and studied the dependence of the activity of these neurons on their availability. We show that classical place-cells perform superb encoding of olfactory space, when this is the only reference frame that is relevant for reward collection.

            "text": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive method in which a magnetic coil generates a magnetic field in an area of interest in the brain. This magnetic field induces an electric field that modulates neuronal activity. The spatial distribution of the induced electrical field is determined by the coils geometry and location. While TMS has been used for several decades, the biophysical basis underlying the stimulation of single cells in the central nervous system (CNS) remains unknown. To address this problem we developed a numerical scheme enabling us to combine magnetic stimulation (MS) with compartmental modeling of neurons with arbitrary morphology. The induced electric field for each location in space around the simulated neurons was numerically calculated. This spatial electric field was combined with standard compartmental modeling software to calculate the membrane current generated by the magnetic field for each segment of the neuron. In agreement with previous studies, the simulations suggested that peripheral axons were excited by the spatial gradients of the induced electric field. However, our simulations show that the effect on peripheral nerve differs from the effect on CNS neurons. Stimulation of CNS neurons was induced by depolarization of the soma followed by initiation of an action potential (AP) in the initial segment of the axon. This mode of activation is very similar to neuronal stimulation by intracellular current injection at the soma, due to soma size. The simulations predict that neurons with low current threshold will be more susceptible to magnetic stimulation. Moreover, our simulations suggest that dendritic regenerative mechanisms will not be triggered directly by MS. Thus, our results may be relevant for the design of multi- intensity TMS protocols, may facilitate the construction of modern magnetic stimulators, and may aid the interpretation of results obtained following TMS of the CNS.",

The lack of awareness of left-side input in cases of Unilateral Spatial Neglect (USN) has been attributed to an inability of focusing attention to the left side, suggesting that the processing of statistical properties may be spared. Five USN patients and five controls compared size of a reference circle to a single circle or to the average size of a briefly presented cloud of circles in either the right or left visual fields or spanning both sides. When spanning both sides, their separate averages were either identical or different (difference from reference in ratio 1:4), with the 'different' condition used to assess relative impact of each side in judging the mean. USN patients were able to make comparisons and average size in either hemifield, though their left-side performance was somewhat degraded. In the spanning condition, while the controls indeed averaged across sides, lowering their threshold, patients showed a higher threshold when needing to depend on the left side of the cloud (when the right-side cloud was closer to the reference). However, they did use both sides of the cloud so that their spanning-condition thresholds were intermediate between those of controls and those expected if they attended only to the right side. We conclude that USN patients perform a weighted average across sides, giving double weight to the right side, perhaps due to \"extinction\". The ability of USN patients to extract the statistical properties of the visual scene on the neglected side points to a relatively spared spread-attention mechanism serving this operation.",

The current experiment examined whether short individuation training may improve recognition of other race faces. During training subjects were asked to learn the names of 18 Chinese faces. Training included five stages that were given on 3 consecutive days, 20-30 minutes on each day. In the first stage subjects were asked to memorize the name of each face. In a second stage they were asked to press the first letter of the name that was presented on the screen. In the third stage subjects were asked to perform a sequential matching of a face to a name and got feedback for incorrect responses. In the fourth stage they were asked to perform the same discrimination task without feedback. In the fifth stage subjects were presented with a name followed by one of the faces and had to decide whether they are matched or not. During the first two days subjects learned the names of 9 faces and during days 2 and 3 of 9 additional faces. Before and after training, subjects performed an old-new recognition task with Caucasian and Chinese faces. Performance for Caucasian faces was significantly better than Chinese faces before training. Following training recognition of the trained Chinese faces was much better than recognition of Caucasian faces. Importantly, recognition levels were also better for novel Chinese faces that were not presented during the training session than of Chinese faces before training. Our findings show that short individuation training with relatively small number of faces can improve recognition of other race faces. The effect of training on eye movements during recognition of own and other race faces is currently investigated to explore possible strategies that may be beneficial for improved face recognition abilities.",

Additionally, DRD4-7 participants were less accurate in the understanding non-verbal social cues. These findings suggest that the DRD4-7 allele, which has been related to a less functional dopamine receptor (Asghari et al., 1995) and the efficiency of receptor maturation (Van Craenenbroeck et al., 2005), may be associated with imbalanced reward system and impaired mentalizing abilities which may explain the lower levels of envy ratings reported here.",

This modulation has been labeled mu-suppression, to distinguish it from the modulation of alpha oscillations in the same frequency range, which reflects reactivation of the cortex by any type of visual input that captures attention. Mu-suppression is induced not only by actual movements but also while the participant observes actions executed by someone else. This characteristic putatively associates the mu rhythms with the Mirror-Neurons System, which, in humans, has been suggested to contribute to social skills abilities. In this talk, I will present data from different experiments, relating mu suppression to social interaction skills such as understanding others' intentions, interacting in a social game, and empathizing with others in pain. These data were collected in EEG experiments with university students (24-30 participants in each experiment), and mu suppression was measured compared to a base line of viewing a rolling ball. In addition, I will present data showing the effect of Oxytocin, a neuropeptide hormone which has been linked with a wide range of human social cognitive functions, on EEG suppression in the mu/alpha and beta bands. In concert, these data suggest that the motor system, reflected by mu suppression, is involved not only in action perception and execution but also in higher social cognitive processes such as mediating our understanding of others.",

Participants were presented with stimuli (numerals or words) in colors and were asked to name the color of the stimulus and to ignore its meaning. Not surprisingly, an incongruent color (e.g., 5 presented in yellow to a synesthete that sees 5 in red) slowed down color naming. Conflict situations (e.g., a numeral in an incongruent color) created a negative emotional experience. Most importantly, coherence between a conflict or non-conflict emotional experience and the emotion elicited by the color of the stimulus for a given synesthete, modulated performance. In particular, synesthetes were faster in coherent than in incoherent situations. This research contributes to the understanding of emotional experience in synesthesia, and also suggests that synesthesia can be used as an instrument to investigate emotional processes in the wider population.",

In this study we aimed to determine the effects of different drug-free periods on cocaine-CPP in rats with or without non-reinforced exposure to drug-associated stimuli. Male-Sabra rats were trained for cocaine-CPP (5, 10 or 15 mg/kg,i.p.) in CPP apparatus. Prior to conditioning the rats were allowed to freely explore the apparatus, and the compartment which was inpreferable was chosen to be paired with cocaine. During 8-days conditioning rats have received 4 injections of cocaine and 4 of saline alternatively. Different groups (n = 6-16) have been tested in a drug-free state 1 to 3 times following conditioning. The CPP score was calculated and CPP consider to be extinguished if mean CPP-score did not differ significantly from 0. All groups of rats treated with 10 mg/kg or 15 mg/kg cocaine displayed high and equal magnitude of CPP in the first test made 1, 4, 7 or 14 days following conditioning. The group treated with 5 mg/kg expressed the same rate of CPP at an interval of 1 day, but clear decline on 14 day. Rats treated with any dose being tested three times, at the intervals of 1-4-7 days or 1-7-14 days did not display CPP on the third test. We also found that CPP after treatment with 10 mg/kg or 15 mg/kg cocaine has already been extinguished in the second test, but only for an interval of 1-14 days. Reinstatement of drug seeking in response to conditional cues was evident at least two weeks after conditioning for the higher doses of cocaine. Extinguished CPP can be obtained after a single extinction trial made closely to the original training and followed by prolongs abstinence. However, with low dose of cocaine, abstinence alone may be sufficient to disrupt drug-cue association.",

However, since participants kept fixation at the same screen position throughout the scan, it was impossible to infer if the representation of viewed actions is in a retina-based coordinate system, or a more elaborated one. Here, we address this issue by instructing participants to change their gaze between experimental conditions, such that some conditions shared the same retinotopic coordinates (but differed in their screen position), while other pairs of conditions had the opposite trait. The degree of similarity between the patterns of activation elicited by the various conditions was assessed using multi-voxel pattern analysis methods. Regions of interest, showing robust overall activation, included the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and the Lateral Occipital Complex (LOC). In these extensive areas, the correlation between patterns of activation for conditions sharing the same retinotopic coordinates was significantly higher than those having different retinotopic coordinates. In contrast, the correlations between activation patterns for conditions with the same spatiotopic coordinates were not significantly greater than for non-spatiotopic conditions. These results suggest that viewed object-oriented actions are likely to be in retinotopic coordinate frame of reference.",

We investigated this effect using subdural intracranial recordings in humans (ECoG). Our results show that the suppression of the ERP does not involve a reduction in neuronal activity - since gamma band responses remained unaffected. Rather, the ERP suppression was tightly related to the level of gamma activity preceding the event, and this effect was independent of the interstimulus interval. We propose that the ERP suppression is due to a desynchronization of neuronal firing resulting from recurrent neural activity in the vicinity of the freshly stimulated neurons and not an attenuation of the overall neural activity. This evoked potential suppression (EPS) effect can threfore serve as a robust marker for gamma-band activity even in non-invasive scalp EEG recordings. Due to its neuronal selectivity the EPS could provide a unique tool to study the tuning properties of human cortical sub networks.",

We have recently used a rodent model to demonstrate that chronic monocular deprivation, from eye opening to adulthood, induces severe amblyopia and decrease in excitatory synaptic density in the visual cortex. Nonetheless, stimulation of the chronically deprived eye continues to evoke physiological responses in the primary visual cortex. although single unit activity has lost orientation tuning and evoked synaptic potentials are unreliable and rapidly fatigue. Dark exposure initiated in adulthood can be used to reactivate robust ocular dominance plasticity in the visual cortex, which promotes the recovery from severe amblyopia. Chronic monocular deprivation followed by dark exposure and reverse deprivation stimulates the slow recovery of spatial acuity, which can be accelerated by repeated daily exposure to a two-choice spatial discrimination task. The speed of the recovery is controlled by the number of repetitions of the task, while the magnitude of the recovery is determined by the age at initiation of the chronic monocular deprivation. Remarkably, the recovery in spatial acuity is not restricted to the orientation of the visual stimulus used in the discrimination task. No emergence of spatial acuity is observed in subjects that receive chronic monocular deprivation, but do not receive dark exposure before reverse deprivation. This suggests that dark exposure lowers the threshold for perceptual learning, and that dark exposure and reverse deprivation encourage the transfer of perceptual learning to other features of the visual stimulus.",

Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a common neurological event, which exists in 75% of the TBI patients. Previous experiments from our lab have shown that mTBI may lead to short and long-term cognitive, emotional, and behavioral deficits. In the present experiments we examined the neuroprotective properties of Exendin-4 (Ex-4) on cognitive performances following mTBI in mice when Ex-4 was given post trauma. Ex-4 is a 39 amino acids, Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist, that increases the anti-apoptotic pathways. Previous studies have shown that GLP-1 protects hippocampal neurons from apoptosis, and enhances associative and spatial learning. The non-invasive closed-head weight drop model was used to induce mTBI utilizing a 30 gr. weight. ALZET osmotic mini pumps were implanted subcutaneously in mice immediately after the trauma. Behavioral tests were conducted at two time points, 7 and 30 days post trauma using the \"Novel object recognition\", the \"Y maze\" and the \"Passive avoidance\". The mice subjected to mTBI showed impaired cognitive behaviors that were improved following administration of Ex-4. MTBI mice exhibited impairments in visual and spatial memory, which were corrected when Ex-4 was administrated post-trauma. No statistical differences were found between groups at the \"Passive avoidance\". These findings may offer a new potential therapeutic way to treat damages caused by mTBI. Presumably, the neuroprotective effect that was obtained is due to the binding of Ex-4 is to the GLP-1 receptor, hence generating a cascade that eventually leads to cell survival and neurite outgrowth. Further studies will investigate this disorder for a better understanding of the mTBI and Ex-4 mechanism.",

GnRH analogs are extensively used in in vitro fertilization, and treatment of sex hormone-dependent cancers, due to their ability to bring about 'chemical castration'. The interaction of GnRH with its cognate type I receptor (GnRHR) in pituitary gonadotropes results in the activation of Gq/G11, phospholipase C\u03b2 (PLC\u03b2I), PLA2 and PLD. Sequential activation of the phospholipases generates the second messengers inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate (IP3), diacylglycerol (DAG) and arachidonic acid (AA), which are required for Ca2+ mobilization, the activation of various protein kinase C isoforms (PKCs) and the production of prostaglandin (PG) and other metabolites of AA, respectively. PKC isoforms are the major mediators of the downstream activation of a number of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades by GnRH, namely: extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38MAPK. The use of selective inhibitors and dominant negative plasmids for the various PKCs has revealed that PKC\u03b2II, PKC\u03b4 and PKC\u03b5 mediate ERK2 activation by GnRH, while, PKC\u03b1, PKC\u03b2II, PKC\u03b4 and PKC\u03b5 mediate ERK2 activation by PMA. Also, PKC\u03b1, PKC\u03b2II, PKC\u03b4 and PKC\u03b5 are involved in GnRH- and PMA-stimulation of JNK-1 in a cell-context dependent manner. We present preliminary evidence that persistent vs. transient redistribution of selected PKCs, or re-distribution of a given PKC to the perinuclear zone vs. the plasma membrane may dictate its selective role in ERK, or JNK activation.

The complex motor patterns constituting these behaviors are the result of interactions among distinct but functionally related central pattern generator circuits (CPGs), each having the ability to produce a variety of different motor patterns depending on sensory and modulatory inputs. Our work provides insights into the neuroanatomy and neurophysiology of the STNS of the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria. We identified rhythmic patterns endogenous to both, the frontal ganglion (FG), a major source of innervation to the foregut, and the hypocerebral ganglion (HG), which is connected to the FG and innervates the crop. Furthermore, we investigated functional interactions between the pattern of rhythmic movements of mouth appendages, governed by the suboesophageal ganglion (SOG), and foregut movements. Neuromodulatory-Induced SOG fictive feeding patterns had an indirect excitatory effect on spontaneous FG rhythmic activity in fully isolated and inter-connected Brain-SOG-FG preparations. Correlation between fictive motor patterns of the two ganglia was demonstrated by simultaneous changes in burst frequency. These interactions were found to be mediated by the brain. Hence our work demonstrated the presence of CPG networks in the STNS and indicated on intricate neuromodulation-mediated circuit interactions, in the absence of sensory inputs. These may be instrumental in generating the complex rhythmic motor patterns of the mouthparts and gut muscles during locust feeding or ecdysis-related air swallowing. Ongoing work further characterizes the locust STNS networks, their modulation and interactions in different behavioral contexts.",

Similarly, neuroimaging studies provide indirect evidence for separate patterns of activation during episodic or semantic FOKs. However, the semantic-episodic distinction hypothesis has not been directly addressed. In the current event-related fMRI study, we used a within-subject, within-experiment comparison of the monitoring of semantic and episodic content. Whereas the common neural correlates of episodic and semantic FOKs observed in this study generally replicate the previous neuroimaging findings, several regions were found to be differentially associated with each task. Activity of the right inferior frontal gyrus was modulated by the semantic-episodic factor only during the negative predictions of retrieval, suggesting that negative predictions are based on partially distinct mechanisms during each task. A posterior midline network, known to be activated during episodic retrieval, was activated during episodic and not semantic monitoring, suggesting that episodic FOKs rely, to some extent, on common episodic retrieval processes. These findings suggest that theoretical accounts of the etiology and function of FOKs may benefit from incorporating the prediction directionality (positive / negative) and the memory domain (semantic / episodic) distinctions.",

Therefore we wanted to design a method to investigate the dynamics of neuronal response to synchronous input from a large synaptic population that can be monitored over extended timescales. By electrical stimulation of cultured neuronal networks and recording of their response spikes with micoelectrode arrays (MEA), two types of early (<15 ms) neuronal responses can be evoked: (i) Extremely reliable spikes with high temporal precision (jitter <0.1 ms) that were described previously to be generated by direct stimulation of a neuron, and (ii) spikes with high reliability and lower temporal precision (jitter \u02dc1 ms). In this work we show that these are synaptically mediated responses. Unlike direct responses, early synaptically activated spikes are modified by application of synaptic blockers; as blocker concentration is increased, response latency becomes higher and jitter increases. At even higher concentrations, response probability gradually decreases until spike generation is completely abolished. Thus, changes in the synaptic population input are expressed in the response latency and probability of these neurons. The response characteristics to different stimulation amplitudes and frequencies provide further insight into synaptic population dynamics. Synaptic response latency decreases with increasing stimulation amplitude, probably due to stronger activation of the synaptic population. Continuous stimulation of these neurons results in increased response latency, already at low frequencies (1-0.25 Hz), where direct response latency is barely affected. In conclusion, the early synaptic responses in neuronal cultures offer an accessible experimental system for the study of synaptic population input in a controlled manner.",

To explore the generality of the latter finding, we examined the number and morphology of microglia in the olfactory bulb (OB), following 40-days odor enrichment, during which adult male mice were exposed daily to one of 20 odorants. To facilitate this examination, we used mice with microglial-specific transgenic expression of green fluorescent protein (CX3CR1-GFP mice). The results show that at the completion of the enrichment period, enriched mice displayed significantly improved odor recognition memory. Specifically, they could recognize a test odorant for up to 240 min after its first presentation, as compared with only 30 min in controls. The number of new neurons within the OB, assessed by BrdU administration on day 21 of the enrichment, was greater in the enriched, as compared to non-enriched mice. The number of microglia, assessed by enumerating GFP-labeled cells, as well as cells labeled with the microglial activation marker Iba-1, was similar in the enriched and control groups. Moreover, microglial morphology (length of the processes) and proliferation (GFP/BrdU double-labeling) was also comparable in the two groups. The results suggest that in contrast with the effects of environmental enrichment on hippocampal microglia, there are no effects of specific sensory (odor) enrichment on microglia in the OB",

This counterintuitive performance deterioration occurs when using odors or sounds as aversive reinforcers, and is not due to attentional distraction or decision bias. In contrast, positive reinforcement or mere exposure induce the typically reported decrease in thresholds. Our findings show that aversive outcomes induce wider stimulus generalization by modulating perceptual thresholds, and hence indicating the engagement of low-level mechanisms.

The auditory thalamus, auditory cortex and lateral amygdala were dissected 6 hrs after training (paired (n = 22) and unpaired (n = 22)). Proteins were extracted, labeled and subjected to antibody microarray. The level of Tau-5, Abl, IL-1\u03b2 and Bog proteins was found to be decreased in unpaired group compared with the paired group in thalamus. We further monitored the level of Abl protein in thalamus of paired, unpaired and na\u00efve (exposed to conditioning chamber only) groups using the Western blot technique. The level of Abl was significantly reduced (p < 0.05) in unpaired group (n = 19) when compared to na\u00efve group (n = 20). The level of Abl in paired group (n = 16) was not significantly different from na\u00efve group. These results show that safety learning protocol, but not fear conditioning, leads to decrease in the level of Abl protein in auditory thalamus.

During immobility, hippocampus exhibits irregular bursts of activity, with occasional rapid orderly activation of place cells expressing a possible trajectory of the animal. It is not known how these different regimes emerge and what causes the switch between them. We propose an attractor network model which encodes a map of the environment in its recurrent connections endowed with short-term synaptic depression that accounts for such a diverse range of behaviors. Network behavior can be rapidly controlled via modulation of the external inputs. Thus attractor networks with short-term plasticity are flexible enough to subserve different behavioral states of the animal.",

The kinase mTOR has been implicated in synaptic plasticity, learning and memory by controling protein translation, and we found that excessive alcohol intake in rodents results in the increase in the synaptic proteins HOMER and GluR1 via a mechanism that requires mTOR. Importantly, we have shown that the selective inhibition of this pathway with the FDA-approved drug rapamycin reduces excessive alcohol consumption, alcohol seeking, reward and sensitization. Our study therefore suggests that the mTOR pathway in the NAc contributes to maladaptive forms of learning and memory that underlie alcohol-drinking behaviors, and provides a potential valuable target for the treatment of alcohol use and abuse disorders.",

Despite these findings, the cellular changes due to PKMzeta expression and activity are as of yet poorly understood. We approach this issue by examining the morphological changes correlated with the overexpression of PKMzeta in primary cortical neurons in culture.

This study aimed to investigate mitochondrial network dynamics and its plausible association with abnormal cellular oxygen consumption in schizophrenia. Viable EBV-transformed lymphocytes (lymphoblastoids) from DSM-IV diagnosed patients with schizophrenia (n = 17), BD (n = 15) and healthy controls (n = 15) were assessed for mitochondrial respiration, mitochondrial dynamics and relevant protein levels by oxygraph, confocal microscopy and immunoblotting, respectively. Respiration of schizophrenia-derived lymphoblastoids was significantly lower as compared to controls, and was twice as much sensitive to dopamine (DA)-induced inhibition. Unlike DA, haloperidol inhibited complex I driven respiration to a similar extent in both schizophrenia and the control cells. Both drugs interact with complex I yet at different sites. At the site of DA interaction we found alterations in protein levels of three subunits of complex I in schizophrenia. In addition, we observed structural and connectivity perturbations in the mitochondrial network, which was associated with alterations in the pro-fusion protein OPA1. None of these alterations were observed in the BD cells, which were similar to control cells. In schizophrenia we show impaired mitochondrial network dynamics associated with reduced cellular respiration and complex I abnormalities.

Furthermore, stimulus representation in some sensory systems, like the salamander's retina, the rodent olfactory system and the human tactile system, are characterized by a small number of precisely timed spikes, suggesting that the brain possesses machinery of extracting information embedded in the timing of spikes, not only in their overall rate.

            "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating and currently incurable neurodegenerative disease, with constantly rising prevalence rates. Animal models of AD, among them the genetically powerful Drosophila model, aided in gaining insights into the pathological processes involved in AD, especially in implicating the amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) peptide as a key player involved in neuronal dysfunction and degeneration. Nevertheless, the mechanism by which A\u03b2 induces neurodegeneration or contributes to other pathological effects remains to be discovered. Cultured neuronal networks provide an excellent opportunity to advance in this direction. Neuronal networks are a bridging link between single cells and the structurally and functionally complex brain. As such, they provide exceptionally high-resolution access into both cellular and intercellular processes. In this study, cells derived from the nervous system of Drosophila were cultured under carefully controlled conditions. Cultured neurons were found to undergo a specific and consistent organizational process: the cells begin as single dissociated units and then regenerate and grow neurites, allowing them to establish elaborate connections with one another. This is followed by cell migration that leads to cluster formation and re-arrangement of the neurites into thick nerve-like bundles. The network's development, along with its vitality and functionality, can be continuously monitored, allowing for the effect of different perturbations to be studied. It is suggested that primary neuronal cultures from transgenic Drosophila expressing human A\u03b2 will show clear deficiencies and alterations in comparison to cultures obtained from wild type controls. A close comparative investigation of the development of these two types of cultures could both, help us understand the mechanism of A\u03b2 pathological action and serve as a platform for testing novel therapeutic agents.",

However, it is still unknown whether early category selectivity in occipito-temporal areas plays a role in the generation of the category-sensitive ERP responses to their respective stimulus categories. In the current study we applied Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) simultaneously with EEG recording. Two consecutive TMS pulses were administered 60 and 100 ms after the onset of face or body stimuli, either over the right Occipital Face Area (rOFA) or the right Extrastriate Body Area (rEBA). TMS-related artifacts were removed offline from the recorded scalp potentials via the subtraction of a noise template from the ERP to each stimulus category. Results show a significant signal enhancement to faces following rOFA stimulation, and a significant signal enhancement to bodies following rEBA stimulation, both for the N170 and the VPP. This interaction provides direct evidence that activations of face- and body-selective areas in the lateral occipital cortex as early as 60-100 ms after stimulus onset play a role in the generation of sensitive ERP responses to faces and bodies 150-200 ms after stimulus onset, respectively.",

We found that improvements in the perception of object location were mediated by increased hand coordination and reduced hand velocity and not at all by increased sensory acuity. The dynamics underlying the emergence of perceptual decisions depended on task difficulty and involved gradual changes of motor variables. Our results indicate that at least in some tasks, motor and not sensory variables underlie rapid improvements of tactile perception, and that tactile perception emerges from iterative interactions with the object via motor-sensory convergence processes.",

We investigated in the rat the effects of an acute exposure to elevated platform (EP) stress on neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity in the medial prefrontal-cortex (mPFC- basolateral-amygdala (BLA) circuit, implicated in acquisition and extinction of fear memories. The effects of stress exposure were compared in the juvenile (post-natal day (PND) 27) to those of the adult (PND 60) rats. Rats were exposed to EP for 30 min, and their baseline responses in the BLA to stimulation of the mPFC (neuronal excitability), as well as long-term potentiation (LTP; synaptic plasticity) were measured. Baseline responses were significantly weaker in the juveniles than those of the adult rats. In the na\u00efve juvenile rats high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of the mPFC resulted in long-term depression (LTD) in the BLA, but no change in the synaptic plasticity was observed in the adults. The exposure to EP stress had no effect on neuronal excitability in the juveniles, but significantly reduced it in the adult rats. Moreover, stress released the plasticity of the BLA from LTD in juvenile rats, and resulted in LTP in the adults. These results suggest developmental differences between the juvenile and adult rats in both neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity in the mPFC-BLA circuit, as well as effects of stress on these processes.",

In the present study we identified spinal cord adult neurogenesis as a potential novel player in the mechanism of tactile sensation. By exposing mice to novel mechanosensory stimuli for varying periods of time and of different diversity, we found that novel sensory stimuli induce progenitor cell proliferation in the sensory dorsal pathway of the adult spinal cord, and that the duration of the stimulation and its diversity affect their subsequent neuronal differentiation and survival. Single exposure to a novel mechanosensory stimulus induced immediate proliferation from an apparent reservoir of progenitor cells (DCX+/NG2+; Sox2+). In contrast, repeated exposures to the same stimulus induced neuronal differentiation and survival of the new cells, mostly into immature (DCX+, NG2-, NeuN-, Calbindin-) GABAergic (GABA+, GAD 65/67+) neurons (NSE+, HuC/D+, Calretinin+), and inhibited their additional proliferation. We propose that these newly generated GABAergic immature neurons serve a transient neuromodulatory role, which is part of a mechanism in which niche plasticity is finely tuned and regulated both temporally and spatially. Introducing adult neurogenesis as a potential mechanism of response to a novel stimulus and for habituation to repeated sensory exposures opens up potential new directions in treating hypersensitivity, pain and other mechanosensory disorders.",

We can therefore distinguish between a basic egocentric (or head centered) coordinate system and a more complex allocentric system, which determines an objects position in space. While early auditory localization mechanisms utilize binaural information and form a head-centered representation, it is the body- or world-centered (allocentric) view that eventually guides our actions. However, little is known about the neural coding of these distinct representations. In an ERP experiment, we attempted to dissociate the two coordinate systems and reveal in which manner spatial representation is organized in the human auditory cortex. We used MMN (Mismatch Negativity), a well studied EEG effect evoked by acoustic changes from an established regularity. Subjects (N = 11) were instructed to reorient their heads after hearing a series of repetitive auditory stimuli (\"standards\"). This was followed by a similar auditory stimulus (\"deviant\") located in one of two distinct locations: either deviating from the standards in an egocentric manner (i.e located in a different position relative to head orientation); or in an allocentric manner (i.e located in a different absolute position). Our findings reveal that both egocentric and allocentric systems take part in early processing: we observed significant MMNs for both allocentric and egocentric deviant stimuli, with similar scalp distributions. These findings may imply that there are multiple representations of stimuli location in the auditory cortex. Whether they are served by different (yet proximate) populations of neurons, or by the same neurons, remains for future research.",

We propose that BBB dysfunction may be critically involved in functional recovery (and deterioration) after stroke and underlies common clinical complications including hemorrhage, epilepsy and delayed cognitive and neurological dysfunctions. We thus point to BBB damage and repair as potential targets for the treatment of stroke.",

Young OLETF rats present abnormal eating and adiposity profiles already during lactation, with a sharp leptin surge around postnatal day (PND) 7. This pre-obese profile results from the interaction of the \"hungry\" pups with their obese mother that nurses them longer and provides them with high fat milk. To further examine the effects of the early environment on long term obesity and leptin sensitivity, we performed a partial-fostering study, where half of the females were switched with females from the opposite strain on Postnatal (PN) day 1. On PN Week 8, females underwent a behavioral leptin sensitivity test followed by 4-day palatable food challenge. LETO (control) females reared by OLETF dams (OdLp) became overweight during lactation, but recovered early post weaning. However, despite being lean, they lost their sensitivity to peripheral leptin, which was reflected by malfunctioning of Arcuate nucleus (ARC) leptin receptors, leading to decreased c-fos response to peripheral leptin administration. In the food challenge, a high preference for fat was revealed in those females, exposing an acquired sensitivity to diet induced obesity. While OLETF females were leptin resistant and obese as adults, OLETF females reared by LETO dams (LdOp) showed an improved response to leptin in the ARC and reduced preference for fat despite being obese. This study provides an important insight into the influence of the early postnatal environment on later life leptin sensitivity and food preference, which can predispose to or protect from diet induced obesity.",

Furthermore, inflammatory cytokines are implicated in normal brain physiology. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is one of the most important proinflammatory cytokines in the response to infection, and also associated with neuroinflammation in brain disorders. Effects of blocking IL-1 receptor (R)-mediated activity in the brain have been analysed using a mouse strain overexpressing human soluble IL-1R antagonist (TghsIL-1ra) under control of the GFAP-promoter. Studies in young and ageing mice, and upon kainic acid-induced excitotoxicity, show a blunted neurogenesis response in the TghsIL-1ra mice. Similarly, the reaction of astrocytes and microglia to either acute or chronic inflammation was dramatically reduced. Neuronal IL-1 expression is enhanced following LTP, but exogenously added IL-1, or blocking IL-1 receptors inhibits the consolidation of memory. Studies on learning ability in the TghsIL-1ra mice support the role of IL-1R-mediated signalling in long-term memory. Analysing the activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc) provides evidence for impaired synaptic strengthening underlying the learning defects.",

The anteroventral periventricular nucleus of the preoptic region of the hypothalamus (AVPV) contains a sexually dimorphic population of neurons that are known to be involved in regulation of reproductive functions such as preovulatory gonadotropin surge in female rodents and possible sex differences in puberty onset. One of the sexual dimorphic populations is tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positive neurons which their number is grater in females compare to males. The function of these TH positive neurons is still un-known nor is the reason for their sexual dimorphism. Our hypothesis is that these dimorphic neurons play a role in pheromone mediated reproductive behavior. In this project we use viral vectors to genetically manipulate the AVPV TH positive neurons. Lentiviruses which contain knock-down and over-expression of TH were previously constructed in our lab and tested in-vitro and in-vivo. These viruses are going to be bilaterally microinjected to the AVPV area of both male and female mice. These transgenic mice will be then analyzed for hormone level and tested in a variety of behavioral tests which include aggression, sexual and maternal behaviors. By comparing the transgenic animals with the control group we hope to characterize the function of the AVPV TH positive neurons and the reason for their sexual dimorphism.",

We measured the subjects' detection thresholds for rightward and leftward motion, as well as their eye movements, with and without adaptation. Adaptation biased perception toward the non-adapted direction, in both Retina and Screen conditions, but its effect was significantly larger for the latter. In addition, adaptation caused reduced motion detection sensitivity, apparent by a decrease in the psychometric curves' slopes.

What is the nature of memory-encoding of object-to-object contextual associations during a brief visual glance? Ample research has suggested that under very rapid viewing conditions only the 'gist' of a scene is grasped, while little visual detail is accessed and retained in long-term memory. In the present research we investigated whether contextual associations may enhance memory of visual details, even when objects are merely glimpsed. Participants viewed pairs of contextually-related and unrelated objects (e.g., a kettle and a mug; a shovel and a vase, respectively), presented for an extremely short exposure duration (24 ms, masked). Subsequently, participants performed a memory-recognition test, in which one of two objects within a pair was replaced by a novel object from the same basic category. Participants differentiated old objects from novel object exemplars, while these were presented with their original counterpart pair object. Results demonstrated higher levels of correct recognition for contextually-related than for unrelated object pairs (recognition rates in the latter did not differ from chance level). Furthermore, when object stimuli in the recognition test appeared alone, i.e., without a corresponding pair object serving as a memory-retrieval cue, results remained virtually identical. Namely, memory for specific visual details remained higher for objects initially appearing within contextually-related, than unrelated, object pairs. These results strongly suggest that while contextual information may provide a coarse 'schema' that enables memory of meaningful visual input (i.e., the 'gist' of a scene), it also enhances the representation of specific visual details in the scene, even within a mere glimpse.",

While error detection and error awareness have been studied in the past two decades using Event Related Potentials (ERPs), the lateralization of errors and their awareness has not been directly examined. The purpose of the current study was to investigate this lateralization in healthy individuals under laboratory conditions. 16 subjects performed a 2-choice RT Lateralized Error Awareness Task (LEAT) whilst their EEG was recorded. The LEAT enabled sorting errors into two categories \u2013 errors made due to stimuli on the left (Left Errors), and errors made due to stimuli on the right (Right Errors). After each trial, the subjects had an explicit option to change their response if they noticed that they had made an error, allowing us to determine error awareness on a single trial basis. The results did not show any significant difference between Left and Right Errors in their number, in the RTs or in their awareness rates. The ERP results show that while the components associated with error processing (Ne) and error awareness (Pe) showed the consistent 'error awareness effect' (no difference between the Ne for aware and unaware errors, an enhanced Pe for aware errors only), there was no significant difference in the effect between Left and Right Errors. Thus, no hemispatial bias was found for errors and error awareness in the behavioral or the electrophysiological results. The implication is that this task can now be used to study error detection and awareness in patient populations who have a lateralized attentional bias like hemispatial neglect.",

Yet, to date there is no specific inhibitor for this aggregation process. Using unbiased systematic peptide array analysis, we indentified molecular interaction domains within the \u03b2-synuclein polypeptide that specifically binds \u03b1-synuclein. Adding such peptide fragments to \u03b1-synuclein, significantly reduced both amyloid fibrils and soluble oligomer formation in vitro. A retro-inverso analogue of the best peptide inhibitor was designed to develop the identified molecular recognition module into a drug-candidate. While this peptide shows indistinguishable activity as compared to the native peptide, it is stable in mouse serum and penetrates \u03b1-synuclein over-expressing cells. The interaction interface between the D-amino acid peptide and \u03b1-synuclein was mapped by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy. Finally, administering the retro-inverso peptide to a Drosophila model expressing mutant A53T \u03b1-synuclein in their nervous system, resulted in a significant recovery of the behavioral abnormalities of the treated flies and in a significant reduction in \u03b1-synuclein accumulation in the brains of the flies.

Drug testing may be done on healthy volunteers treated with substances associated with reversible cognitive effects such as scopolamine, an acetylcholine antagonist, and ketamine, a NMDA antagonist. Both drugs have previously been used as models of Alzheimer and schizophrenia respectively, and showed electrophysiological abnormalities associated with these disorders. We have recently developed a novel algorithm to extract brain network activation (BNA) patterns that reveal in an unsupervised manner spatio-temporal networks from EEG data. In this study BNA analysis was used in order to assess changes in brain networks in 15 healthy volunteers following administration of scopolamine (0.4 mg) and ketamine (100 mg) in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover study. Subjects (18-45 y) performed a working memory task in which they determined whether two consecutive face stimuli were identical, while EEG was recorded from 64 channels. The networks showing the activation differences between placebo and scopolamine revealed a delay in posterior face processing activity and a fronto-central, widely distributed activity around 250 ms following scopolamine administration. The later activity was restricted to pre-frontal areas under placebo. The placebo-ketamine differentiating networks showed that the frontal negativity at 250 ms peaked earlier, and was lateralized to the right under placebo, while ketamine administration disrupted this hemispheric asymmetry - a known phenomenon in schizophrenia. To conclude, this study shows that BNA analysis can automatically detect significant changes in brain states between different conditions, validating its use for investigating effects of pharmacological treatments on CNS diseases.",

To that end, adult rats were exposed to 21 days of CMS or handling. On days 20-22, an intraperitoneal injection of WIN (0.5 ml/kg) or vehicle was administered. Drinking of 1% palatable sucrose solution as a measure of anhedonia and body weight changes were monitored throughout. After CMS or handling rats were tested in an inhibitory avoidance procedure. CMS animals showed less sucrose intake than controls and gained less weight compared to controls. Furthermore, CMS rats demonstrated enhanced conditioned fear and impaired extinction as measured in the avoidance task. Importantly, WIN reversed the CMS-induced alterations in avoidance conditioning and extinction, but not in sucrose consumption or body weight. These findings suggest a protective effect of cannabinoids against some of the symptoms induced by an intensifying stress experience and provides evidence to support the use of cannabinoids for the treatment of stress-related disorders such as depression.",

Both the TSPO and NO are considered to have anti-cancer properties. A potential physical link connecting the TSPO and NOS has also been described. To study actual interactions between NO and TSPO, we induced cell death by applying the nitric oxide donors S-Nitroso-L-glutathione (GSNO) and Sodium nitroprusside (SNP) to the human glioblastoma U118MG and rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cell lines. To assay cell viability, we measured Trypan blue inclusion, Propidium Iodide (PI) labeling, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, and DNA fragmentation. Assays using 2,3-bis[2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulphophenyl]-2 H-tetrazolium-5-carboxyanilide (XTT) and 5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1',3,3'-tetraethyl-benzimidazolylcarbocyanine chloride (JC-1) detected changes in mitochondrial activity and \u0394\u03a8m. To detect mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, 10-N-Nonyl-Acridine Orange (NAO) fluorescence intensity was measured. Expression and binding characteristics of TSPO were assayed with Western blotting and binding analysis. The involvement of the TSPO in NO donor effects was assayed by applying TSPO knockdown by siRNA, and the TSPO ligand PK 11195. TSPO knockdown and PK 11195 significantly counteracted cell death induction and mitochondrial activity otherwise caused by SNP. PK 11195 did not exert its effects after TSPO knockdown. Interestingly, SNP did not interfere with [3 H]PK 11195 binding to the TSPO, nor did it affect TSPO protein expression. However, TSPO is S-nitrosylated following SNP application. Thus, our studies show that activation of TSPO by the NO donor SNP, leading to ROS generation, including cardiolipin oxidation at mitochondrial levels, collapse of the \u0394\u03a8m, and cell death, appears to involve S-nitrosylation of the TSPO.",

The training effect is quite specific to the trained stimulus, both in its position and direction of motion. However, since position specificity was demonstrated by showing the learning did not transfer to other positions on the screen with constant fixation (at the screen center), a given position on the screen always corresponded to a specific location on the retina. This study was designed to differentiate between a specificity in retinotopic coordinates vs. one in spatiotopic coordinates. This was done by testing the degree of transfer of learning to new stimulus locations that share the same retinotopic location as the learned position (but differ in their screen position), and vice versa. Participants trained on a motion discrimination task in which they were asked to report whether the direction of a motion is tilted to the right or to the left of the vertical axis. During the learning phase, lasting 5 sessions, the fixation point and the dot array were always presented in the same location. Thus, the stimulus position was constant both in its retinal and spatiotopic coordinates. Next, the level of transfer of learning was examined. Gaze direction and the dots` array location were systematically changed, creating four different configurations: one matching the retinotopic learned location, one matching the spatiotopic learned location, another that is horizontally symmetrical to the learned location and a control location that is neither retinotopic, nor spatiotopic or symmetrical. A decrease in the discrimination threshold to a level similar to the learned configuration (e.g. full transfer) was most apparent in the retinotopic learned position and the mirror-symmetric .

We applied gene targeting and pharmacological techniques to test whether CRFR2 and Ucn3 in the MeA participate in the processing of male/male social signals. Using a lentiviral-based system of RNA interference, we found that knockdown of CRFR2 levels, specifically in the MeA, but not in the Lateral Septum (LS), results in maladaptive social interaction with male conspecifics. Interestingly, no differences were detected in exploration or anxiety like behaviors between treated and control mice. We further found that administration of Ucn3 to the MeA improves the ability to confront a social challenge whereas administration of CRFR2 antagonist prior to Ucn3, severely impairs social behavior. These results demonstrate a specific role for MeA Ucn3/CRFR2 system in translating social signals into social behavior.",

It was proposed to mediate the translocation of the scaffolding protein PSD95 from the cytosol to the membrane and its communication with sub-synaptic molecules. Impaired expression of Dlgap1 was reported both in schizophrenia patients and rat model. Accordingly, we have shown that abnormal Dlgap2 expression is associated with maladaptation to trauma in PTSD-like rats. The aim of this study was to delineate the mode of action of Dlgap2 using hippocampal primary culture from P1 sprague-dawley rat. Glia proliferation was restrained by adding ARA-C for 2 days in-vitro (DIV), resulting in about 30% immunoreactive glia. Time dependent changes in the mRNA levels of Dlgap2, PSD95, Neuroligin 2 (NLG2), NMDA receptor subunit (NR2B), neuronal Tubulin beta3, glial GFAP and the reference genes RSB3K, CypB and beta-actin during 4-29DIV were assessed by qRT-PCR. Intracellular location of Dlgap2 and related proteins were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. In addition, Dlgap2 was silenced by lentivirus-delivered shRNA in the hippocampal cultures. Higher Dlgap2 mRNA levels were associated with reduced glia content, suggesting that Dlgap2 is expressed mostly in neuronal cells. Time dependent Dlgap2 expression showed a bell shape curve and was positively correlated with that of PSD95 levels. However, the increase in PSD95 expression was delayed by 2 days as compared to Dlgap2, while corroborated with the enhancement in the expression of PSD-related genes, NLG2 and NR2B. This, together with morphological changes suggests a role for Dlgap2 and the PSD-related genes in neuronal sprouting. The effects of Dlgap2-silencing on PSD-related genes and neuronal morphology will be discussed. We believe that this study will unravel a role for Dlgap2 in PSD zone, which may be of relevance to postsynaptic function, which is believed to be impaired in PTSD.",

Although numerous in vitro and in vivo studies have revealed the neurotrophic and neuroprotective functions of PACAP in brain but only a few reports were focused on the effect of PACAP in protecting the oxidative stress. The present study is to clarify the role of PACAP on protecting the oxidative damage using PACAP-deficient mice. While PACAP does not show the anti-oxidative potential in vitro, intravenous injection of PACAP38 in mice significantly reduced the oxidative stress level and increased anti-oxidative potential in the plasma with a dose-dependent manner. These protective effects are not demonstrated by VIP and the anti-oxidative potential was cancelled by co-treatment with PACAP receptor antagonist, PACAP6-38. Aged PACAP-deficient mice evidently showed an oxidative stress in their plasma and in the hippocampal regions. Antioxidants expression in the hippocampal region of the aged PACAP-deficient mice significantly decreased compared with the age-matched wild-type mice. The aged PACAP-deficient mice were found to be impaired with the learning and memory task in some behavior tests. These results strongly suggest that PACAP has a function of protecting anti-oxidative stress as well as learning and memory with aging.",

Previous work in our laboratory indicates that astrocytes mediate these effects. We thus explored possible mnemonic-related mechanisms initiated by IL1 in astrocytes. A major role of astrocytes and a crucial condition for memory processes is glucose uptake (GU). IL1 was previously shown in-vitro to augment GU by astrocytes, but a concentration-response curve was yet to be constructed. To this aim, we utilized novel glucose fluorescent probes which, unlike traditional probes, do not necessitate glucose deprivation. In preliminary experiments, astrocyte-enriched cultures (90%) were extracted from neonatal mice cerebra and incubated for 4 days. Cells were then loaded with either 50 \u03bcM GB1 or 50 \u03bcM GB2, both cy3-labled glucose probes, in order to establish relative efficiency. Both probes reached saturation at 40 minutes. GB2 signal was 250% stronger than GB1. Both probes gave much stronger signals than traditional probes, e.g., 2-NBDG. GB2 was thus used in subsequent experiments. For concentration-response curve measurements, cells were incubated for 24 hours with either 0, 0.1, 1, 15, 100 or 500 pM human IL1, and then loaded with 6 \u03bcM GB2 for different times, to estimate effect on uptake kinetics. Immunostaining for GFAP, an astrocytic marker, was performed to verify the astrocytic localization of the probe. Our results indicate that the IL-1-GU concentration-response curve follows an inverted-U, with a peak at 15 pM. Furthermore, in three independent experiments, cells given IL1 showed less absorption of GB2 after 10 minutes, relative to control. Thus, IL1 is suggested to slow down GU but increase saturation point. We propose that the inverted-U shaped effect of IL1 on memory could be the result of its effect on GU in astrocytes. This should be further explored in memory tests in-vivo.",

We designed a novel speed-accuracy trade-off task, the 'arc-pointing' task, defining motor skill learning as a training-induced change in the speed-accuracy function (SAF), and examined the effect of training speed on SAF changes. Interestingly, learning was not uniform across all test speeds, instead the shape of generalization changed as a function of training speed. Unexpectedly, improvement could be greater outside the training range: training at medium speeds resulted in more improvement at an untrained fast speed than training at the fast speed itself. This distinct pattern of generalization suggests that motor skill learning is computationally, and perhaps neurally, distinct from other forms of motor learning, such as adaptation and trajectory optimization. To investigate the neuronal representation of skill, we designed an fMRI version of our speed-accuracy task. Subjects were scanned, before (day 1) and after training (day 5), while they performed the task at three different speeds. We adopted this 2-factor design (day, speed) in order to separate learning from changes in performance (speed) due to learning, and potentially identify the interaction between performance and learning. The main analysis addressed changes pre-defined ROIs (superior parietal lobule (SPL), primary motor cortex (M1), premotor dorsal (PMd), putamen and cerebellum). We found a main effect of learning (day) in M1 and SPL and an interaction between movement speed and day on the proportion of task-related voxels in PMd. This interaction might be the neural correlate of the speed-dependency of skill generalization. These imaging data suggest that motor skill learning is neuroanatomically distinct from adaptation and action selection.",

In mammals, two of the sensory systems that deal with this kind of information are the main olfactory system (MOS) and the vomeronasal system (VNS), which are associated with reproduction, aggression, and parental behavior. Sensory neurons at the main olfactory epithelium project to the main olfactory (MOB), while sensory neurons at the vomeronasal organ project to the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) where they synapse on AOB mitral cells. We previously showed that mitral cells of these two systems are characterized by different intrinsic properties and response patterns. Previous studies that used extracellular recordings from behaving mice showed that responses of AOB mitral cells to natural stimuli are long-lasting. Here we use whole-cell recordings from acute mouse olfactory bulb slices to show that a brief (0.1 ms) stimulation of the sensory afferents elicits a long-lasting firing response in AOB mitral cells, response that lasts between 10-60 s. Synaptic-like current injections into the cell's soma (SL) generated a similar long-lasting response, despite the presence of glutamate and GABA receptors antagonists. These results suggest a postsynaptic mechanism underlying these prolonged responses, rather than a network activity. We hypothesized that this property of AOB neurons is mediated by a calcium-activated non-selective cationic current (Ican). Indeed, the intracellular presence of BAPTA, a calcium chelator, reduces firing duration response of AOB mitral cells to SL stimulation by 45.7% and to synaptic stimulation by 89.5%. Application of the Ican blocker flufenamic acid to the recording chamber reduces the duration of AOB mitral cells firing response to SL stimulation by 43.9% and to synaptic stimulation by 79.8%. These results suggest that Ican activity is essential for AOB mitral cells prolonged responses.",

Synapsin-synapsin interactions control the association of SVs within the RP, and thereby regulate the supply of vesicles from the reserve pool to the active zone. The N-terminal A domain of all major synapsin isoforms contains a phosphorylation site (site 1) recognized by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and CaM Kinase I.

We hypothesized that if human social chemosensing is mediated by subsystems beyond the main olfactory system, than such anosmic individuals should nevertheless display a brain-response to a chemosignal. We used the sweat-derived compound 4,16-androstadien-3-one (AND), which has been widely considered in the context of human chemosignaling.

The relative timing of TMS in relation to neuroimaging determines which neuroscientific questions can be addressed with the combined TMS-neuroimaging approach. When TMS is given online (i.e. during neuroimaging), neuroimaging can reveal how focal cortex stimulation acutely modifies the activity and connectivity in the stimulated neuronal circuits. TMS and neuroimaging can also be separated in time (offline approach). A conditioning session of repetitive TMS (rTMS) may be used to induce rapid reorganization in functional brain networks. Neuroimaging can subsequently map the temporospatial patterns of TMS-induced reorganization. Alternatively, neuroimaging may be performed first to localize brain areas subserving a given task. The temporospatial information obtained by neuroimaging can be used to define the optimal site and time point of stimulation in a subsequent \"virtual lesion\" experiment in which TMS disrupts neural processing in a cortical area during a specific task. This talk will first touch on some general methodological issues that need to be taken into account when combining TMS with neuroimaging in studies of human motor control. The main focus will be on highlighting current applications of the online and offline TMS-neuroimaging approach. Finally, it will be discussed how TMS can be combined with structural brain imaging to study regional structure-function relationships in the brain.",

We ask: what is the role of excitatory and inhibitory sensory feedback to the facial nucleus in controlling whisker movements? We explore this issue using a simplified model of the loop, which includes motoneuron pool driven by external CPG that control whisker movements (Simony et al., in press) via intrinsic and extrinsic muscles, and receive inhibitory and excitatory sensory feedback driven by various cell types of the trigeminal ganglion (TG). We show that synaptic adaptation in the loop (Nquyen et al., 2005) leads to stabilization of whisking amplitude, and that the magnitude of the effect of sensory feedback peaks around 35 ms from protraction onset. Our preliminary results suggest that experimentally observed whisking \"stuttering\" or \"pumps\" in free-air (Towal et al., 2008) or upon object contact (Deutsch et al., this meeting) can be explained by the brainstem loop. Our analysis suggests that the frequency of rhythmic whisking (e.g., Gao et al. 2001) is controlled by higher sensory feedback loop that includes the CPG whereas the brainstem loop directly controls muscle force.",

Utilizing FRET spectroscopy, optical imaging, electrophysiology and molecular biology we explore the casual relationship between the pattern of ongoing neuronal activity, structural rearrangements within the synaptic signaling complexes and plasticity of single synapses and whole networks.

AKT is a main kinase of the PI 3-kinase cascade, implicated in long-term memory and synaptic plasticity and we hypothesized that it may be differentially involved in the IC-BLA-PFC neural network in the acquisition and extinction of CTA. To that end, we inhibited AKT phosphorylation by injection of LY294002 (LY; the PI 3-kinase cascade inhibitor) into the IC at different stages of the acquisition or extinction of CTA in rats. Inhibition of AKT phosphorylation in the IC prior or after the first extinction training (T1) facilitated the acquisition and consolidation of extinction on T2. In contrast, microinjection of the LY into the IC before T2 impaired the retrieval of extinction memory. These effects were transient, and extinction behavior returned to baseline levels on T3. Interference with AKT phosphorylation after T2 had no effect on extinction, suggesting that after being well consolidated, extinction is resistant to disruption by the AKT inhibitor.",

Since a common source for the complexity in the input, soma and output is the behavior of ionic channels, we propose a view of a neuron as a population of channels. Analyzing the stochastic nature of ion channels using recently developed mathematical model, we provide a rather general characterization of the input output relation of the neuron, which admits a surprising level of analytic tractability. The view developed provides a clear quantitative explanation to history-dependent effects in neurons and of irregular firing pattern recently observed in single neurons, isolated from any synaptic activity, under periodic pulse stimulation. Specifically, we were able to reproduce the observed modes of neuronal response, derive an input-output relation for the neuron's mean firing rate, and a complete probabilistic state space description for the neuron's firing patterns. Though only a few approximations were made in this model, we were able to use only a small number of biophysically measurable parameters, and include the stochastic and history-dependent nature of the channels. The results suggest a new way through which neurons can perform complex spatio-temporal computations on their inputs, on a large range of timescales, and with low sensitivity to the temporal precision of input spikes.",

It was suggested that suppression induced by BM eliminates collinear facilitation. Moreover, we showed that training on BM task improved processing speed. Here we applied perceptual learning (10 days) in order to study whether reinforced facilitatory interactions can overcome BM. Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) were recorded before and after training. Low-contrast, foveal target GP was simultaneously flanked by two collinear high-contrast GPs. For BM, another identical mask was presented at different time-intervals (ISIs). Before training, BM induced suppression of target detection for ISI of 50 ms. This ISI coincides with the active time-window of lateral interactions. After training, remarkable improvement in all behavioral measurements occurred, including percent correct, sensitivity (d'), reaction time (RT) and decision criterion for this ISI. ERP results show that before training, BM abolished facilitation at the same ISI, measured as the amplitude of negative N1 ERP peak (latency of 260 ms). After training, sensory representation, reflected by P1 peak, has not changed, consistent with unchanged physical parameters of stimuli. Instead, shorter latency (by 20 ms, latency of 240 ms) and increased amplitude of N1 indicate development of facilitatory lateral interactions between the target and the collinear flankers. Thus, previously effective BM became ineffective in disrupting collinear facilitation. Moreover, robust correlation between RT and high-amplitude later \"Response\" peak (latency of 620-660 ms) was significantly decreased by training, suggesting evolvement of processing mechanisms that are less dependent on later stages of processing. Overall, we suggest that perceptual learning strengthening collinear facilitation results in faster and more automatic processing.",

If so, will it activate the ventral visual cortex similarly to visual and Braille reading? We looked into reading using the vOICe sensory substitution device, which translates visual images to sounds, enabling the blind to \"see\", and in this case read, with their ears. We examined a unique congenitally blind individual who was literate in reading Braille but analphabetic to the \"sighted\" letters. We scanned her, using fMRI, before and after she learned, for the first time, the shape of the \"sighted\" alphabet using the vOICe. We show that only following training, in which the participant learn to associate a phonological value to the heard sounds, reading with sounds activated the ventral 'visual' cortex, similarly to reading Braille. Therefore, reading activates the visual cortex in an a-modal, or metamodal, fashion. This suggests that the visual cortex can be trained to process reading via 'vision' using sensory substitution, even without visual experience and in a new sensory modality.",

The evoked responses were restricted to the ventral areas in the sensory and motor homunculi, regardless of the body part name that was heard, and were specific to the lip and tongue representations in Penfield's homunculi.

However, opposing roles were suggested for BDNF in the hippocampus and the ventral tegmental area (VTA), despite the interaction between these regions. Previously, we found that a reduction in BDNF expression, using RNA interference and lentiviral vectors (LVs) injected into the rat's dentate gyrus (but not the CA3) of the hippocampus precipitates depressive-like behavior. On the other hand, another study found that a selective ablation of the BDNF gene from the VTA induced antidepressant-like effect in the social defeat stress paradigm. Here, we tested whether elevation in hippocampal BDNF expression, or reduction of VTA BDNF expression are essential for the behavioral effects of the antidepressant treatments desipramine and ECT. In order to do so, we sought to knockdown or over-express BDNF in specific brain regions and then test whether it alter the behavioral effects of desipramine and ECT. BDNF knockdown within the hippocampus of rats blocked the behavioral effect of desipramine, but not ECT, as was observed at the forced swim test (FST) paradigm. In addition, ECT, but not desipramine, reduced BDNF expression levels significantly in the VTA of the rats, regardless to whether they were or were not subjected to hippocampal BDNF knockdown. Therefore, we over-expressed BDNF within the VTA of the rat brain and tested whether it alter the behavioral effect of ECT. Indeed, VTA BDNF over-expression blocked the behavioral effect of ECT at the FST. Theses findings suggest that the mechanism of desipramine action is dependent on elevation of hippocampal BDNF expression, while the mechanism of ECT action is dependent on reduction of VTA BDNF expression. These findings may explain individual differences in resistance to specific antidepressant treatments.",

Histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity was measured using a fluorometric assay kit. Results: Treatment of astrocytes with the HDACIs as single agents, did not affect the viability or their HDAC activity; moreover, it attenuated Dox-induced mortality. In contrast, these HDACI prodrugs reduced the viability and the HDAC activity as well as augmented Dox induced death of U251 glioblastoma cells. Dox dramatically increased ROS production, whereas the prodrugs induced ROS only in cancer cells but not in astrocytes. Additionally in astrocytes, the prodrugs abrogated ROS production by Dox. The antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) was less effective than the prodrugs in protecting astrocytes from Dox toxicity. Additionally,the HDACI prodrugs selectively affected genes expression, were found to be orally bioavailable, crossed the BBB and possessed low systemic toxicity.",

Most mammals rely primarily on olfactory cues for social recognition. A meeting between two unfamiliar rats or mice usually starts with a period of intensive olfactory investigation, which precedes further social interactions. Based on the natural tendency of rats to closely investigate novel individuals, a simple laboratory test to investigate social recognition memory was developed. In this test, a juvenile is introduced into the cage of a resident adult rat for a period of five minutes and the time spent by the adult rat on investigation of the juvenile is measured. Then, this procedure is repeated several times with the same juvenile, until the adult displays a very short investigation time. This short-term social recognition memory was found to be specifically dependent upon release of the neurohormone oxytocin in the medial amygdala (MeA), which receives convergent inputs from the main (MOB) and accessory (AOB) olfactory bulbs, hence is a major candidate to regulate pheromones-mediated behaviors. In this study we used local field potential (LFP) measurements in behaving rats to follow synchronized neuronal activity in few brain areas assumed to be involved in social recognition memory, including the MOB, AOB and MeA, during the behavioral paradigm. A power-spectrum analysis of the recorded LFP signals revealed a peak around 8 Hz (theta rhythm) which is most prominent during investigation of a novel animal and gradually declines during repeated investigations of the same animals. Thus, the strength of the theta rhythm in these brain areas correlates with the time of investigation, which serves as a measure for the social recognition memory. We conclude that social investigation behavior evokes synchronized neuronal activity which is proportional to the novelty of the social stimulus, in a dispersed neuronal network.",

It is unknown whether short term plasticity also exists in human synapses and if similar rules also hold true for the human brain. Here, we directly tested in human slices cut from neocortex tissue removed for surgical treatment of deeper brain structures in drug-resistant epilepsy patients, whether adult human synapses can modulate responses in a short time scale, we applied and quantified this changes as given by the Tsodyks-Markram model for dynamic synapses. In contrast to values reported on rodent neocortical synapses the time constant for recovery from depression differed significantly (~550 ms in rodents and ~140 in humans).

To date mitochondrial genes, such as DJ-1 were linked to PD, and 10 to 25 percent of all those genes correlate with early-onset (before age 50) PD. Activation of glial cells in the CNS is the first defense mechanism against pathological abnormalities that occur in neurodegenerative diseases.

The LC-NE system modulates the amygdala, hippocampus and neocortex based neurocircuits, and is characterized by a dynamic bi-phasic mode of action, that is regulated to promote and maintain arousal to suit environmental conditions. Under challenging conditions the LC-NE system shifts towards a mode of action that promotes increased arousal, scanning attention and sampling of behaviors. This shift is known to involve release of corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) and activation of its type 1 receptor (CRFR1) in the LC, while increases in NE release in stress-related limbic structures are known to regulate CRF release in the LC. Yet, the CRF family of peptides includes also three urocortin peptides and the LC is a major site of neurons expressing urocortin 2 (Ucn2), which binds selectively to the type 2 CRF receptor (CRFR2). However LC Ucn2 functional role is poorly understood.

Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is well established for microstructural characterization of the brain. However, most of the DTI studies focus on pathology and aging. Few MRI studies deal with plasticity induced by long-term learning. We use the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) parameters to differentiate between gray and white matter changes.

We have previously found that one of the main characteristics of HA phenotype is a basal as well as post injury elevation of HIF1alpha. HIF1alpha is the regulatory subunit of HIF1, a transcription factor that is associated with many cellular pathways triggered by signals such as cell stress. The current study was designed to examine whether HIF1alpha is required for heat acclimation mediated neuroprotection. To establish that, we have used acriflavine- a recently discovered inhibitor of HIF1 subunit dimerization. HA or normothermic control mice were injected with 15mcg/kg acriflavine or equiviliant volume of saline, immediately after they were subjected to TBI, and another similar dose was injected one hour later. By using neurological severity score (NSS), core body temperature measurements and TTC staining, outcome measures of the injured mice were evaluated following the inhibition of HIF1 and its downstream pathways. Results show that acriflavine treated HA mice demonstrated significant increase in lesion volume accompanied with functional deterioration 48 h post injury as compared with saline treated HA mice, hence abolished HA mediated neuroprotection. On the other hand, acriflavine treated normothermic mice demonstrated no significant difference in functional recovery or lesion volume from saline treated normothermic group. Interestingly, core body temperature measurements revealed that while all acriflavine treated mice were hypothermic, only the HA mice showed dramatic hypothermia up to 48 h post injury We conclude that HIF1has a key role in dynamic processes leading to neuroprotection establishment in HA mice after TBI.",

Thus, we assumed that the putative endogenous TSPO ligand protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) may contribute to cell death induction of cancer cells. For our study we used U118MG TSPO knockdown cells (TSPO siRNA) and their control cells (Scrambled siRNA). U118MG is a glioblastoma cell line. We exposed those cells to PPIX and measured cell death as well as PPIX accumulation in whole cells and in isolated mitochondria under dark and light conditions, using fluorescence microscopy and fluorescence assisted cell sorting (FACS). We found that cell death and PPIX levels in TSPO knockdown cells were significantly higher than in control cells after treatment with PPIX in light condition. Thus, TSPO \u2013 PPIX interactions did not appear to contribute to cell death. We also found that omission of light exposure abolished the cell death we observed after PPIX exposure. Thus, in our paradigm, PPIX by itself did not induce cell death. Interestingly, accumulation of PPIX in TSPO knockdwon cells after treatment with PPIX in complete dark was higher than in combination with light exposure. Thus, TSPO appeared to reduce PPIX levels, an effect that was enhanced by light exposure. Heme levels were not increased in control cells, but did increase in PPIX treated TSPO knockdown cells. Thus, conversion of PPIX to heme was not part of the mechanism whereby TSPO can prevent accumulation of PPIX. We also found that adding the ROS scavenger glutathione (GSH) to PPIX treatment caused an increase in accumulation of PPIX compared to cells that were treated only with PPIX. This was reminiscent of the results with TSPO knockdown cells compared to control cells. Thus, our study shows that the TSPO prevents accumulation of PPIX and heme, apparently due to PPIX degradation dependent on ROS generation resulting from TSPO activation.",

The potential of the technique is demonstrated by showing direct access to threshold dynamics over timescales ranging from seconds to many hours. Moreover, the method allowed us to expose the sensitivity of threshold dynamics to spontaneous input from the network in which the neuron is embedded. The Response Clamp technique follows the rationale of the voltage-clamp and dynamic-clamp approaches, extending it to the neuron's spiking behavior. The general framework offered here is applicable in the study of other neural systems, beyond the single neuron level.",

Here we found a new role of feedback: feedback stabilizes perceptual learning to be more resilient against deterioration/adaptation due to an excessive amount of training (e.g., Mednick et al, 2005, Censor et al, 2009). In the first experiment, 12 subjects were trained on a 2IFC motion detection task. Subjects were trained on two randomly interleaved motion directions, 90\u00ba apart. One direction was always paired with response feedback, while the other was not. Training occurred for consecutive 3 days. Performance gradually increased in the time course of training for the two directions. Before and after training, pre-test and post-test stages were conducted. Unlike training, performance was measured not only for the two trained directions but also a spread of eight other directions \u00b148\u00ba away from these directions in increments of 12\u00ba, for a total of 18 exposed directions. There were 30 trials for each direction. No feedback was given in any trial. Performance changes after training were calculated for the first half (early) trials and second half (late) trials of the test stages for each direction. For the direction trained with feedback and its vicinity, significant degrees of learning were observed in both the early and late trials. On the other hand, for the direction trained without feedback and its vicinity, a significant degree of learning was observed only for the early trials, but this learning effect completely disappeared in the late trials. In the control experiment, a longer 7-day training regimin was used, and no feedback was provided for either direction. Although the degree of learning for both trained directions was comparable to that in the condition with no feedback in the first experiment, learning effect was observed only for the early trials of the post-test stage. This result indicates that the destabilization of learning for feedback-absent directions in the late trials of the post-test stage is not due to the small magnitude of learning. Putting these results together, we conclude that the role of feedback is not only to increase the magnitude of learning but also to stabilize learning to be resilient to deterioration or adaptation accumulated due to excessive amount of trials (e.g., Mednick et al, 2005, Censor et al, 2009).",

Recent studies have shown that 1-(R)-aminoindan possesses neuroprotective activities in vitro against several insults applicable to various neurodegenerative diseases. Here we show, for the first time, that 1-(R)-aminoindan reversed behavioral asymmetry and restored striatal catecholamine levels in two rat models of Parkinson's disease: the unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesion and lactacystin-induced neuronal degeneration. In vitro, using human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma and rat primary cortical cells, 1-(R)-aminoindan significantly protected neurons from hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced oxidative stress (OS), associated with increased catalase activity and markedly up-regulated mRNA levels of phase II detoxifying enzymes. These neuroprotective effects of the metabolite 1-(R)-aminoindan, implicated in 6-OHDA- and lactacystin-induced dopaminergic neuronal degeneration in vivo and against OS in vitro may contribute to the neuroprotective/neurorescue activities of the parental compound, rasagiline.",

Its AChE inhibitory activity results from metabolites, MCPAI and CAI formed in the liver and the brain-selective MAO inhibition, from the formation of HPAI through hydrolysis of the carbamate by cholinesterase. The brains of subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) many of whom develop AD show evidence of oxidative stress and glial activation. In concentrations too low to inhibit either enzyme, ladostigil and its metabolites protect against cytotoxicity induced by oxidative and nitrative stress in cell cultures by preventing the opening of the mitochondrial transition pore and reducing apoptosis.

Furthermore, expression of TGF-\u03b21 under GFAP promoter in mice leads to an age-related deposition of amyloid, such as \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2), around cerebral blood vessels. Recently, it was reported a physiological role of macrophages in the regulation and clearing of cerebrovascular amyloid in AD mice. We speculate that TGF- \u03b21 may affect EC interaction with phagocytosis peripheral cells, such as macrophage, resulting in vascular amyloid deposition.

            "text": "The temporal lobe, the most epileptogenic region of the brain frequently gives rise to seizures and epilepsy (namely Temporal lobe Epilepsy (TLE)) following insults such as trauma, ischemia, tumor or infection. Such insults are often associated with breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Recent animal studies have shown that in the neocortex disruption of the BBB or direct application of the predominant blood protein albumin leads to the development of epileptiform activity(Friedman et al., 2009). Furthermore, in the pilocarpine model of TLE, a relation between BBB breakdown and the number of seizures was reported(van Vliet et al., 2007). We thus tested the hypothesis that prolonged exposure of medial temporal lobe structures to serum albumin will result in spontaneous seizures. To this end, we implanted mice with an osmotic pump for continuous, one week intraventricular perfusion of bovine serum albumin (BSA) in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF). Control mice were perfused with ACSF. We report uptake of BSA into specific cell populations, mostly glia, within the hippocampus, temporal cortex and white matter, followed by prominent and long-lasting astro-glyial activation without apparent neuronal cell loss or hippocampal sclerosis. Using continuous Video-ECoG telemetric recordings from treated behaving mice we ruled out status epilepticus or acute seizures in BSA-treated animals; In most treated mice spontaneous seizures were recorded within 4-7 days, persisting for at least one month after treatment. Our results suggest that prolonged BBB dysfunction and exposure of temporal lobe structures to serum albumin is sufficient to induce TLE and offers a new non status epilepticus induced model for the disease.",

Our subjects performed a working memory task with buildings from Barcelona and Tel Aviv. In each trial, a behaviorally relevant target and task-irrelevant distracter were repeated twice among novel distracters. Behaviorally, we found shorter response latencies with target repetition in all subjects. Moreover, the repetition of targets and distracters was associated with decreased neural responses in the FG and PHC in all subjects. Interestingly, in control, but not in architecture students, reaction times during the first repetition of the target were correlated with activation in multiple brain regions (cuneus, lingual gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, insula, and anterior cingulate cortex). Thus, despite the similar behavioral and neural responses observed in all subjects, the non-experts had to recruit additional regions in order to perform the task.

Conflicting evidence exists regarding the extent to which the brain can process sensory information during this unique state of consciousness. In this study, modulation in auditory and language processing was explored during sleep. Neutral auditory stimuli with varying levels of intelligibility were played to 10 healthy subjects during wakefulness and sleep. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was recorded from both cortical and sub-cortical areas, while independent physiological measures (electroencephalogram (EEG), and pulse rate) were simultaneously recorded and used for sleep staging. During wakefulness, our results demonstrated activity in bilateral superior temporal gyrus and thalamus in response to auditory stimuli. Additionally, left inferior frontal gyrus and bilateral superior temporal sulcus, corresponding to language processing regions Broca and Wernicke, were activated more by intelligible stimuli than by noise. By contrast, during sleep, a significant decrease in activation of the auditory cortex was observed compared to wakefulness(1.1 \u00b1 0.1 percent signal change in wakefulness, 0.6 \u00b1 0.1 in sleep, p < 0.001). In addition, there was a loss of differentiation between speech and unintelligible noise in language related cortical regions during sleep (p 0.3). We thus conclude that auditory and semantic processing of neutral stimuli is diminished during sleep, due to functional disconnection from thalamic processing which stays constant.",

This presentation deals with interactions of the brain microenvironment with brain metastasizing melanoma cells. Brain metastasis confers upon melanoma patients an extremely bad prognosis. The mechanisms underlying homing to and survival of metastatic melanoma cells in the brain are unknown. Our working hypothesis is that interactions of melanoma cells with the brain microenvironment control site specific metastasis to this organ. Variants that form either local cutaneous tumors or brain metastasis in xenografted nude mice were generated from single human melanomas. As these variants have identical genetic backgrounds, any molecular differences between them reflect, most probably, alterations associated with the ability to form brain metastasis. These variants are being utilized to establish a specific molecular signature of melanoma brain metastasis and to study melanoma-brain interactions. Gene expression profiling of the cutaneous and the brain-metastasizing melanoma variants revealed a set of genes differentially expressed in local and metastatic variants. These variants also differed in their adhesive capacity to various substrates, in transendothelial migration, in proteolytic activity and in other functions. Most importantly, the two types of variants react differently to signals delivered by the brain microenvironment. The differential response of the brain-metastasizing and of the local melanoma variants to brain-derived signals may account for the propensity of the former variants to specifically metastasize to this organ site.",

This enhancement appears to result from an interaction between the influences of practice on the task to be learned and the additional stimulation. Here we explored the possibility that this interaction aids learning because one portion of the training (task performance or additional exposures) serves to amplify the internal representation of the stimulus and this amplification then remains during the other portion. If this is the case, learning should be disrupted if the stimulus representation is instead suppressed during one portion of the training, because that suppression should also spread to the other portion. To test this idea, we trained listeners on a non-native speech categorization task using regimens in which periods of task performance alternated with periods of additional stimulus exposure. We manipulated the extent to which listeners presumably suppressed the additional auditory exposures by varying the attentional demands of a visual task performed during their presentation. The periods of task performance alone yielded learning. As in our previous investigation, this learning was enhanced by additional stimulation that occurred during periods of low attentional demand. However, as the attentional demand during these periods increased, learning decreased and then stopped entirely. Learning was not disrupted when the demanding visual task was performed in quiet or performed while auditory stimuli not related to the categorization task were presented. Thus, it seems that the learning was blocked by the suppression of the specific auditory stimulus associated with the task to be learned and the spread of that suppression to the periods of performance of that task. We conclude that the magnitude of the internal stimulus representation affects learning and that changes in this magnitude can spread beyond the time in which they are induced to promote or interfere with learning [Supported by NIH].",

So far, hundreds of oxime derivatives have been synthesized of which only few were developed as antidotal drugs for human use. It is assumed that in vitro reactivation potency of oximes toward a specific OP NA is correlated with their antidotal efficacy in vivo. We have studied the kinetics of in vitro reactivation of the following quaternary oximes: HI-6, HLo-7, MMB-4, TMB-4, Toxogonin and 2-PAM toward human AChE inhibited by the OP NA's sarin, VX, cyclosarin, soman and tabun. The time-course of reactivation of OP-inhibited AChE was measured by first inhibiting AChE up to 90-97% followed by 50-fold dilution either in phosphate buffer (pH = 7.4, 23\u00b0C) or oxime solution. Soman-inhibited AChE was prepared at pH = 9, 4\u00b0C to reduce the rate of acid catalyzed aging.. The following bimolecular rate constants of reactivation (kr, x103, M-1min-1) of sarin-, VX- and cyclosarin-inhibited AChE were obtained for HI-6: 8.0, 2.0, 120, HLo-7: 15, 2,1,10, MMB-4 3.2, 1.5, 5.1, TMB-4: 0.17, 3.5, 0.7, Toxogonin: 0.15, 3.9, 1 and 2-PAM: 0.1, 0.06, 0.025 respectively: Only HLo-7, HI-6 and MMB-4 could reactivate non-aged somanyl-AChE with kr = ,9.2, 4.7 and 0.9x103 M-1min-1, respectively. Interestingly, the highest kr values were obtained for oximes with pKa smaller than 8.0. The most efficacious and universal oximes found in our study are the bisquaternary oximes HLo-7 and HI-6 that also display high antidotal efficacy against most NA's. The weighted ranking order of all oximes as reactivators of NA-inhibited AChE is: HI-6 ~ HLo-7 > MMB-4 > toxogonin ~ TMB-4 > 2-PAM. These kinetic data may assist in the decision making process for selection of the appropriate oxime as an antidote for clinical use.",

Activation of PARP-1 in the central amygdala (CeA) was significantly more pronounced in rats expressing cocaine-CPP than in saline-conditioned rats. Infusion of the potent PARP inhibitor PJ-34 into the CeA before CPP testing abolished preference for the cocaine compartment up to 14 days. Results of locomotor and object-recognition tests in cocaine-conditioned rats ruled out the possibility that PARP-1 inhibition had impaired locomotion or formation of short-term or long-term memory.

Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying developmental neuronal plasticity may therefore provide insights into the mechanisms that restrict regeneration of adult neurons. Neuronal remodeling of the developing Drosophila mushroom body (MB) is initiated by axon pruning of \u03b3-neurons, followed by developmental regeneration to form adult specific connections. Our current knowledge of the underlying molecular mechanisms remains fragmentary. Only the \u03b3-neurons in the developing MB undergo remodeling, offering a unique system in which developmental regeneration can be distinguished from axon growth per se. A mosaic forward genetic screen has identified the orphan nuclear receptor, hormone receptor 51 (Hr51/unf), as required for developmental regeneration. Mosaic analysis has shown that \u03b3-neurons homozygous mutant for Hr51 extend axons normally in larvae and undergo axon pruning at early pupa, yet fail to re-extend their axons to the adult specific connection. Later born neurons extend axons normally, indicating that the mutation affects developmental regeneration and not axon growth per se. Genetic in vivo interaction experiments revealed that Hr51 can repress the expression of the nuclear receptor EcRB1, a known regulator of axon pruning. We also found that the nuclear receptor E75, which is regulated by EcRB1, is required for axon re-extension. Because the mammalian orthologs of Hr51 and E75 (NR2E3 and NR1D1, respectively) were shown to function together, our data suggests that E75 and Hr51 may work as heterodimers to induce regeneration following pruning. Our study demonstrates that Hr51 and E75 may play a role in switching the growth status of axons from degeneration to regeneration and that dynamic interactions between nuclear receptors may regulate different steps of neuronal remodeling.",

However, in recent years, studies have suggested that TANs are not exclusively related to reward and reward-predicting stimuli, but may contribute to other processes, including responses to aversive stimuli, detecting spatial location of stimuli and generating movement. Currently there is little data concerning changes in TAN activity in the ventral striatum. We simultaneously recorded neurons in the ventral and the dorsolateral regions of the striatum while animals performed a two choice alternative association task. A large percentage of the putative TANs in both regions tended to respond around movement initiation and execution with dorsal TANs exhibiting strong directional selectivity relative to ventral TANs. Moreover, the firing rate of dorsal TANS increased in the preferred direction and decreased in the non-preferred direction whereas ventral TANs increased activity in both directions even when exhibiting directional selectivity. The time course of selectivity evolvement relative to movement initiation was similar in both regions. Our findings suggest that coding of movement by TANs in both regions overlaps to a larger degree than previously assumed, considering the segregation in the cortex-basal ganglia- thalamus-cortex circuits, yet the differences in response patterns support the notion that the TANs in the dorsal and ventral striatum have distinct functions in associative tasks.",

To date,all electrophysiological data on grid cells were obtained from rodents navigating in either one or two-dimensional environments. As a result, all computational models trying to account for the grid formation relied on rodent data. These models can be generally divided into two major classes: (1) Network models relying on attractor dynamics; and (2) Single-neuron oscillatory interference models, which rely on the existence of a continuous theta-band oscillation.Because neurons in the bat hippocampus exhibit sharply tuned place fields in the absence of a continuous theta oscillation, we hypothesized that grid cells in the bat entorhinal cortex might exhibit hexagonal grid fields in the absence of theta rhythm.

Most studies concentrate on cognitive errors, involved in incorrect choices, improper sequences of events, or erroneous discrete movements. Recently, a number of studies reported the presence of potentials related to visuo-motor errors during continuous motion in visuo-motor rotation or tracking tasks. The purpose of this study is to establish the presence and characterize the potentials evoked in response to visuo-motor errors in continuous reaching movements. Our experimental paradigm is unique in generating controlled visuo-motor errors, which are well localized temporally, so synchronized averaging provides a well defined error-related potential. Furthermore, we varied the size of the visuo-motor error, and investigated its effect on the error-related potentials. Our results show error-locked negative and positive components, which peak between 180\u2013280 msec, and 360-520 msec, respectively. The amplitudes of both components vary with the size of the visuo-motor error. Source localization showed systematic activation in Brodmann areas (BA) 6, 5 and 7, with occasional activity in areas BA 3, 4, 8, and 24. These results demonstrate the presence of detectable visuo-motor error-related potentials (VMErrP) and their sources. These potentials can be used for early error detection and provide a new tool for Brain-Computer Interfaces.",

Under normal quiescent conditions, immune mechanisms are activated by environmental/psychological stimuli and positively regulate the remodeling of neural circuits, promoting memory consolidation, hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and neurogenesis. These beneficial effects of the immune system are mediated by complex interactions among brain cells with immune functions (particularly microglia and astrocytes), peripheral immune cells (particularly T cells and macrophages), neurons, and neural precursor cells. These interactions involve the responsiveness of non-neuronal cells to classical neurotransmitters (e.g., glutamate and monoamines) and hormones (e.g., glucocorticoids), as well as the secretion and responsiveness of neurons and glia to low levels of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and TNF\u03b1, as well as other mediators, such as prostaglandins and neurotrophins. In conditions under which the immune system is strongly activated by infection or injury, as well as by severe or chronic stressful conditions, glia and other brain immune cells change their morphology and functioning and secrete high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and prostaglandins. The production of these inflammatory mediators disrupt the delicate balance needed for the neurophysiological actions of immune processes and produces direct detrimental effects on memory, neural plasticity and neurogenesis. These effects are mediated by inflammation-induced neuronal hyper-excitability and adrenocortical stimulation, followed by reduced production of neurotrophins and other plasticity-related molecules, facilitating many forms of neuropathology associated with normal aging as well as neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases.",

Thalamocortical responses converged on stable representations within several (~4) whisking cycles, involving fast bottom-up and slow top-down processes via the thalamus and somatosensory cortices (S1 and S2). During the convergence process, responses shifted from being dependent on the anatomical (thalamus-cortex) level to being dependent on the pathway (lemniscal-paralemniscal). The distribution patterns of the basic codes plus a temporal&rate combination code suggest that, consistent with previous results, phase-detection is computed in layer 4 of S1 and threshold operation is implemented in layer 2/3 of S1.

In this study we searched for neural-correlates of pop-out perception in neurons from the optic tectum (OT, a mid-brain area involved in gaze control) of the barn owl. For each neuron, we first mapped the visual receptive field and then studied the responses to a target inside the VRF in three conditions: when the target was alone in the scene, surrounded by similar distracters and surrounded by different distracters. A pop-out effect was quantified as the normalized difference between the response to the target when it was different from the distracters and the response to the same target when it was similar to the distracters. This experiment and analysis was performed for three visual features: 1) The horizontal direction of motion, 2) the orientation of the bar and 3) looming versus shrinking. We report a clear pop-out effect for the horizontal direction of motion, i.e., if the direction of motion of the target was different from its surround the neurons responded to the target stronger compared to when the distracters moved to the same direction. No pop-out effects were observed to the orientation of the bar. In this case, the neural responses to the target were strongly inhibited by the distracters, independent of the orientation difference between the target and the distracters. In the looming paradigm we observed a strong preference of the neural responses to the looming stimuli compared to the shrinking stimuli but no pop-out effects. Our results suggest a neural-correlate of motion pop-out in the OT of the barn owl.

Different organelles such as mitochondria, cytoskeletal polymers and vesicles are being transported along the microtubules in the axon by the motor proteins Kinesin and Dynein. This transport can be divided to anterograde (by Kinesin) and retrograde (by Dynein), and further divided to fast and slow transport, whereas the anterograde transport rate is 1.5 times higher than the retrograde one. Axonal transport is impractical for transportation of small molecules, especially when needed in large concentrations.

This flow facilitates directed movement of soluble materials along the axon.

In addition, since axonal transport is much faster in large cells, so does the movement of the soluble materials in the cytoplasmic medium. In this theoretical work we demonstrate that the hydrodynamic flow is faster than diffusion and provides better distribution of molecules in the cell. By using the theoretical values for the velocities and drag forces of the fast anterograde transport, and by assuming that the velocity of the fluid is proportional to the drag force and independent of the distance from the motor, due to the axon small diameter, the velocity of the fluid induced by one motor protein is assumed to be 0.76 micron/sec. We present our calculation and our preliminary experimental system aimed to measure this effect.

Cholinergic input mediates the brain's ability to select specific stimuli and preserve them for extended processing (Sarter and Bruno, 1997). Bistable neurons, which display a persistent state of firing along with a state of quiescence, are found throughout the cortex and are often dependent on cholinergic inputs (Schwindt, 1988; Fraser and MacVicar, 1996; Haj-Dahmane and Andrade, 1996, 1997, 1998; Klink and Alonso 1997). Using calcium imaging and whole cell recordings accompanied by pharmacological agents, we explored persistent activity in the rat somatosensory cortex. This activity is dependent on carbachol (CCh), an acetylcholine receptor agonist. Bath application of 20 \u03bcM CCh depolarizes pyramidal neurons by 7.72 \u00b1 3.63 mV, increases the input resistance by 34.5 \u00b1 26.1 M\u03a9, and in 60% of cells recorded (48/80), primes them for seconds long afterdepolarizing potentials that outlast stimulation with depolarizing current pulses. This activity is independent of the surrounding network as it can be induced even under complete blockade of synaptic activity. Furthermore, we characterize the stimulus-response relationship that leads to persistent activity. The persistent activity is likely induced with a stimulus that exceeds 5 action potentials at a frequency of 5 Hz. Calcium imaging shows that in the presence of CCh, there is an increased accumulation of spike induced calcium. While this increase is not sufficient to cause persistent activity, the use of BAPTA, removal of external calcium, and the addition of flufenamic acid, a specific blocker of ICAN conductance, all prevent the appearance of persistent activity, thus showing calcium to be necessary. These results show somatosensory, layer V pyramidal neurons are capable of a transient, non-synaptic 'memory' of excitation, which may play a crucial role in the computational processing of the cortex.",

A novel animal model for anxiety and affective disorders exposes juvenile rats to stress, which induces a predisposition for the development of anxiety or depressive symptoms following an emotional trauma in adulthood. Emotional stress affects neural activity and plasticity in the hippocampus. These modifications not only take place at the level of the principal cells, but also alterations in local circuit activity in the hippocampus have been found, due to affected interneurons. Juvenile stress causes long-term changes in hippocampal GABA interneurons: it was found that fear conditioning or juvenile stress can reduce the expression of the GABA synthesizing enzymes, glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD)65 and GAD67. Also alterations in GABA-A receptor subunits in the amygdala and hippocampus were observed in adulthood following juvenile stress. Furthermore, it was shown that a genetically induced deficiency in GAD65 predisposes for increased fear and anxiety. These alterations sensitize the organism to later stressful stimuli and underlie the development of posttraumatic stress disorder. In this study the juvenile stress model will be used to explore the functional role of GABAergic neurons in emotional stress and in the predisposition for the development of posttraumatic stress and posttraumatic depression in adulthood. Changes in postsynaptic GABAergic function in the hippocampus following juvenile stress will be characterized in vivo both at juvenile age and at adult age using electrophysiological techniques. This information will be used to find strategies and tools for intervention with stress-induced dysfunction in this model system.",

However, traditional neural coding theory focused on rate codes that extract information from the neural spike count over long periods of time. Recently, it was suggested that first spike latency is a feature of the neural response that enables fast transmission of information in the brain. Here we study a latency based readout model that allows for fast computation of sound source location in the guinea pig auditory system. The accuracy of the latency model for discrimination between different interaural phase differences and binaural correlation values was compared with a conventional rate-based model and found to improve response speed at small cost to the decision accuracy. We find that the spontaneous firing of neurons limits the capacity of the latency model to accumulate information from large populations. We study two possible solutions that allow the latency model to overcome the detrimental effect of spontaneous firing and achieve fast and reliable readout. To utilize a latency based model, the brain must first identify stimulus onset. We demonstrate how stimulus onset time can be estimated from the responses of neurons that are less selective to the interaural phase difference of the stimulus and study the accuracy of this scheme. Combining the onset estimation and the latency models improves the accuracy of the model, especially for readouts based on neurons with high spontaneous firing rate. We conclude that use of latency codes has the potential to increase processing speed and decrease transmission time, with very little detrimental effect on processing accuracy.",

Compared to successful retrieval which reaches un-delayed resolution both retrieval types are hypothesized to commence with high levels of cue familiarity and be accompanied by a high degree of access to related information. Previous electromagnetic research suggests early differences (as early as 300 ms post-stimulus onset) between TOT and successful retrieval (Know; K). We sought to examine these retrieval states experienced in response to musical cues, and to compare them to unsuccessful retrieval not accompanied by a strong prediction of future success (Don't Know; DK), in order to assess the current interpretation of the documented early difference between K and TOT. We conducted an EEG study designed to obtain early ERP correlates of the abovementioned states. Names of commonly known popular songs were queried using short initial song segments (3 sec). EEG was recorded while subjects were asked to indicate by button press their retrieval state, choosing between four options: successful retrieval (K), Tip-of-the-Tongue, Feeling-of-Knowing and Don't Know. Knowledge claims were confirmed off-line following the recording session. EEG data were analyzed for stimulus-locked epochs to calculated ERPs. Analysis revealed a difference between the TOT and K conditions in the early time interval of 300-550 ms post-stimulus onset, prominent at left fronto-central electrodes. Post-hoc analysis revealed a difference at the same time window and electrodes between TOT and DK. Based on our results we suggest an alternative theoretical account of the memory related FN400 ERP component, which is putatively a familiarity-related component.
