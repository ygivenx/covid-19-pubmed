Doctors and scientists are less farsighted, and making predictions exposes us to ridicule in hindsight. Not long after the USSurgeon General declared that it was \u201ctime to close the book on infectious diseases\u201d, HIV began to 'cruise' the San Francisco bath houses while severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) lay further in the future. In 1984 Margaret Heckler, then US Secretary for Health and Human Services, declared on behalf of the National Institutes of Health that \u201cwe hope to have a [AIDS] vaccine ready for testing in about 2 years.\u201d",

Thus, my message for future progress on HIV is that we ignore non-HIV research at our peril. No doubt this prophesy will fall on deaf ears at the funding agencies, especially those in the charitable sector: the late Bernie Fields' exhortation2 to \u201cget back to basics\u201d in HIV science is not part of their mission.",

At that time, 'lymphadenopathy virus' (LAV) was just one more candidate agent alongside other animal and human viruses, and alongside an idea that a fungal infection secretes a cyclosporin-like immunosuppressant. But none of us present at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory meeting on human retroviruses in the fall of 1983 should have failed to be impressed by how the French scientists hardened their evidence. By early 1984, they had detected the virus in individuals with AIDS, including gay men, two brothers with hemophilia4 and a heterosexual couple5 from Africa and their child, and had pointed out the similarity of LAV to animal lentiviruses on account of its cytopathic effects and morphology6. They were accurate in almost every finding, including the only correct interpretation of the open reading frames when the viral genome was cloned and sequenced7. Hard on the heels of the second French report4 came news of other HIV isolates from the United States8,9.",

CD4 was identified as the cellular binding receptor for HIV in 1984. The importance of the regulatory and auxiliary genes began to be elucidated in 1985. Azidothymidine (Zidovudine) became the first antiretroviral drug to enter clinical trials in 1986. Meanwhile, we began to grasp the scale of the AIDS pandemic unfolding before our eyes: 'slim' disease in Africa was indeed AIDS13.",

But Fig. 1a belies the heterogeneity of the African epidemic. As the 'four-city' studies have shown14, we still do not know why HIV spread explosively in some places and not in others. Fifteen years ago, AIDS in South Africa was seen in a handful of gay white men who had traveled to the United States, but now more than four million South African black men, women and children are infected with HIV. By contrast, it was estimated 15 years ago that about 7% of adults in Kinshasa were infected, but this proportion remained stable until recently, despite the imploding infrastructure and human conflict that the Democratic Republic of Congo has suffered. Predicting the future of the HIV epidemic will be no easier than interpreting the recent past.",

In this issue, Stevenson11 points to the lessons to be learned from primates that are naturally infected with a high viral load but do not develop disease. He contrasts oncoviruses to HIV and the primate lentiviruses that can infect nondividing macrophages and dendritic cells. I argue further that all lentiviruses are macrophage-tropic, but only some infect lymphocytes (primate and feline immunodeficiency viruses). For example, let us consider Maedi-Visna virus, which is solely macrophage-tropic. Maedi-Visna in sheep is the prototypic disease from which lentiviruses derive their name28. Infected sheep develop a wasting disease and neurodegeneration similar to that seen in humans with AIDS, but they do not show T-helper-cell immune deficiency. As Maedi-Visna is remorselessly progressive, with a high rate of mortality, I have argued previously29 that the infection, activation and apoptosis of T-cells in HIV are epiphenomena alongside the underlying progression of macrophage disease. Like the prophecies of Cassandra, this view remains unheeded perhaps because it would necessitate a complete reappraisal of both HIV pathogenesis and the inability of the immune system to ultimately control lentivirus infection.",

In the early years, HIV-1 radiated out into the different clades that we know today, probably from small founder populations of virus. The regions in which HIV-1 has been present the longest have the most complex array of genotypes (Fig. 2). In the next 20 years the pattern will change, and an increasing number of circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) of HIV-1 will become apparent. Thus, the neat geographic delineation of subtypes\u2014B in the Americas, E in Thailand, A and D in East Africa and C in southern Africa\u2014are likely to be superseded by CRF viruses. Indeed, CRFs between HIV-1 groups M and O have been described36, even though the parental genomes derive from distinct zoonotic events35. It is possible that natural recombinants could arise between HIV-1 and HIV-2 now that HIV-1 has spread across West Africa, where HIV-2 was already endemic. Although there are some constraints to the co-packaging of HIV-1 and HIV-2 RNA37, it is worth investigating the possibility of hybrids in dually infected persons.",

Although there is no evidence that HIV has evolved in terms of virulence or modes of transmission in the past 20 years, evolution of drug resistance12 and of immune escape (see accompanying review in this issue38 and refs. 39,40) clearly occurs under selective pressure. Thus, HIV mutation and recombination have a great impact on therapy and vaccine design. I remain to be convinced, however, that the emphasis of vaccine design on the basis of clades is HIV science. Efficacious, broadly based vaccines require immunogens representing those regions of the virus that change the least. When these have been identified, clades can be addressed. For humoral immunity, the challenge is not only the immunogen itself but also the access of antibodies to the neutralization targets. Given the effect of the N-linked sugars of gp120 on immune escape from HIV39, the glycobiology of HIV is back in fashion.",

            "text": "AIDS is characterized by opportunistic infections and by what we may call opportunistic neoplasms49. Some opportunistic infections in turn exacerbate HIV in a vicious cycle. Thus, genital herpes simplex infection is a risk factor for HIV transmission50, while HIV increases and prolongs herpes shedding51. Other concurrent infections may ameliorate the risk or severity of HIV infection, as has been reported for GB virus C52,53, scrub-typhus54 and dengue55. Elucidating the mechanisms of cross-protection may give us clues to controlling HIV.",

Individuals with AIDS would be the 'superspreaders', as they are for tuberculosis. It is perhaps reassuring that such a horrific situation has not yet occurred, but predictive modeling is required to determine whether it could occur in the future. The AIDS pandemic compounds the threat from the deliberate or accidental release of new infectious agents.",
