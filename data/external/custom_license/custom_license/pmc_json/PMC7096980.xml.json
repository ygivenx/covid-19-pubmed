Patients who had an endocrine disorder before the occurrence of SARS were excluded. Blood samples were collected from each of the participants and analyzed for factors such as cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate, and free T4 and T3. Hormone measurement techniques such as immunochemiluminometric assay and radioimmunoassay were also carried out. In total, 24 patients were diagnosed with hypocortisolism, of whom 2 had thyrotoxicosis, 3 had central hypothyroidism and 1 had primary hypothyroidism. In 15 of the patients diagnosed with hypocortisolism, the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal axis dysfunction resolved completely within 1 year. Low levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate were also detected in 8 patients.",
