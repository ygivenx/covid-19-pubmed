In addition, Eiken Chemical in collaboration with Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics and the Hospital for Tropical Diseases has recently developed a field-stable LAMP kit for malaria for the detection of all species of human malaria parasites [36,37]. The validation of a commercial loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay (TB-LAMP) for the detection of tuberculosis has been recently reported by Eiken and is expected to be launched into the market soon together with a kit for human African trypanosomiasis. The LAMP technology has also been implemented in the Illumigene (Meridian Bioscience, Cincinnati, OH, USA) assay for rapid diagnosis of Clostridium difficile, Mycoplasma pneumonia, Group A Streptococcus and Group B Streptococcus. In addition, Amplex Biosystems (Gie\u00dfen, Germany) have commercialized the eazyplex\u00ae SuperBug that detects carbapenemases antibiotic resistances (covering KPC, NDM, OXA-48, VIM and the Acinetobacter baumannii belonging Oxa-groups OXA-23 like, OXA-40 like and OXA-58 like) and the eazyplex SuperBug CRE, which also includes ESBL genes of CTX-M-1 and CTX-M-9 families. All these tests take between 15 and 30 min for results. It is also of interest to note that real-time PCR devices can be used for isothermal amplification and detection although less complex instruments are specifically aimed for this purpose. Among others, both Instrument Genie\u00ae II (Optigene, Horsham, UK) and Instrument Genie III allow isothermal amplification and detection by fluorescence, whereas Ilumipro-10 (Meridian Bioscience, Cincinnati, OH) detects amplification products by turbidity.",

Since a first microfluidic disc for detection of hepatitis B virus reached an analytical sensitivity of about 50 copies per reaction within 60 min measured by turbidity [38], a significant number of POC devices based on LAMP have been developed: that is, a multichannel microfluidic device based on LAMP turbidity with a need of only 0.4 \u00b5l for detection of the swine virus in less than 1 h [39] or a multiplex microfluidic RT-LAMP device able to distinguish three types of influenza A substrains with a detection limit of 20 copies per reaction in 30 min [40]. In a similar way, a colorimetric device based on a RT-LAMP assay has been reported to detect hepatitis E virus by visual detection with a limit of detection of 10 copies and low handling and equipment requirement [41]. Last year a completely automated POC device termed Microfluidic Biomolecular Amplification Reader was reported to process raw samples through combination of molecular, microfluidic, optical and electronic technologies. This battery-powered instrument, which uses light emitting diodes and phototransistors, is able to detect the HIV-1 integrase gen in 70 min [42]. Recently, a novel microfluidic biochip has been manufactured that integrates LAMP, line probes assay and giant magnetoresistive sensors, having high analytical sensitivity for hepatitis B virus detection (10 copies per ml-1) in 1 h [41].",

Originally HDA process was performed through three different proteins (plus Polymerase): the DNA helicase, which unwinds the dsDNA, and two additional proteins (Figure 2). Nevertheless, the new thermostable helicase Tte-UvrD from Thermoanaerobacter tengcongenesis is able to work at 65\u00b0C, allowing more specific reactions without both MutL and SSB [44]. HDA amplification usually takes 60\u2013120 min, at least for low-copy numbers, but possible modifications for optimization can be done [45]. Although only a single set of primers is needed for HDA, few multiplex HDA applications have been developed so far such as a duplex-detection of pathogens N. gonorrhoeae and Staphylococcus aureus by combining HDA with microarray-based detection [46], and a 4-plex detection assay for four different genes from the same organisms [47]. HDA is compatible with diverse detection mechanisms like fluorescent detection [48] or electrochemical DNA detection with gold nanoparticles [49].

Only one strand is nicked in NEAR while, comparatively, SDA avoids the requirement of dATP\u03b1S (5\u2032-O-l-thiotriphosphate) to prevent double-stranded cleavage [65].

Another POC approach is the ICAN-chromatostrip for detecting Salmonella invA, which was documented to have higher diagnostic sensitivity than a standard PCR assay [83]. An N. gonorrhoeae test kit (ICAN NG-QR) and a Salmonella Detection Kit for DNA chips (ICAN\u2122 DNA) were ICAN-based products commercialized by Takara Bio (Otsu, Japan).

Interestingly, some methods such as LAMP, RCA and SMAP2 produce a continuous concatemeric DNA strand that could be useful for in situ detection. It is noteworthy that the majority of isothermal techniques have been attributed high analytical sensitivity within a range of 1\u201310 copies in previous studies, whereas SDA, ICAN and NEAR seem to be less sensitive. Nevertheless, since most evaluations have been performed at the development stage in academic laboratories, further studies on precommercial or available products should be undertaken to confirm these data. Certain techniques (LAMP, SMAP2, SDA, HDA, RPA and NEAR) appear to show mid-to-high tolerance to biological compounds and allow a low- or non-pretreated sample process. This could be an interesting characteristic for POC use and procedural simplicity. Denaturation is a previously needed step for some technologies as it obviously is for PCR. Since heating requirements at 95\u00b0C for DNA extraction and denaturation are moderate, this factor may facilitate their integration into power-free POC instruments that would be particularly suitable for use in remote settings [55].",

Specifically, there has been an exponential growth of near-POC or POC developments based on PCR and isothermal amplification technologies for diagnosis of infectious diseases in the last years.

Diverse isothermal-based technologies are tacking technical challenges at the micro-scale and finding their way to market. Low sample volume handling, low concentration of target, complex signal amplification due to low concentration, target instability and compatibility and integration of the various device subsystems have been identified as major hurdles for the development of POC assays.",

However, technical potentialities of LAMP or any other competing chemistries do not automatically guarantee their future adoption. In addition to further validation in clinical labs to obtain solid results, a range of cultural, organizational, economic and regulatory barriers may undermine successful deployment of diagnostics at the point of care, either isothermal or based on other technologies. One of the main challenges for effective implementation in the upcoming years will be to gain a positive perception from end users and healthcare providers. Since rapid diagnosis by POC assays alleviates patient anxiety and eliminates return visits for results, it appears that delivery of diagnosis on site will be well accepted by end users. However, acceptance of decentralized diagnostics by healthcare providers will imply important changes in clinical practices, workloads and logistics. New frameworks will need to be designed at the point of contact between the patient and the healthcare system to ensure adequate on-site sample collection, test performance and quality control of results [84].",

It will be important to optimize costs of reagents, materials and systems of mass production and assembly of device components. Nonetheless, the final decision to purchase a POC test or a centralized laboratory test will not strictly be which test is cheapest or faster but rather the cost of the test needed to provide the desired clinical benefit [85]. On the other hand, future widespread use of POC devices will be constrained by nonharmonized regulatory conditions for commercialization of POC devices in diverse geographical markets, especially in Western countries.",

Core laboratories, which are usually located in referral hospitals of industrialized countries, will presumably be the first market segment to be penetrated. Such environments are already familiarized with performance of PCR and other NAATs and can easily evaluate characteristics of isothermal POC solutions against current methods. Minor organizational changes may be needed for implementation of isothermal assays in specialized laboratories, but it will be fundamental that they prove to have sensitivity and specificity comparable to gold standard techniques for pathologies of complex etiology, most prevalent in referral hospitals. The demonstration of cost\u2013effectiveness will also be required prior to adoption to ensure sustainability of diagnostic services. POC applications that would be best valued referral hospitals could be assays targeting diagnosis of time-critical, chronic or highly transmissible infections, as well as differential diagnosis of infections with common symptoms and different treatments and those requiring complex, toxic or expensive therapies. In a mid-term time, POC applications may be able to migrate from core laboratories to other areas within the referral hospital (emergency wards, intensive care units) and beyond (second-level hospitals, primary care), provided that they maintain diagnostic accuracy, rapidity and cost\u2013effectiveness and allow use by nonspecifically trained personnel.",

The WHO estimated that in 2008 resource-limited countries experienced 241 million cases of malaria, 2.8 million new infections with HIV, 7.8 million cases of reactivated TB and 217 million cases of bacterial pneumonia [86]. In fact, simple inexpensive POC tests based on antibody detection that are close to the \u2018ASSURED\u2019 ideal are already available in most developing countries in a lateral-flow or dipstick format (i.e., for the diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus infection). It also needs to be highlighted that the majority of population in the developing world resides in remote rural areas, so patients often travel long distances to primary healthcare settings and thus may be unable to return for test results. Moreover, primary care infrastructures may have poor availability of trained technicians and limited electricity supply for equipment or refrigerators for the storage of reagents. Portable, extremely low-cost, very easy-to-use isothermal POC tests that provide rapid visual readouts with minimal instrumentation and reagents stable at room temperature would have wide acceptance in this scenario. In particular, it is expectable that mobile phones, which are prevalent in the developing world, will become fundamental complements of POC applications since they can contribute capabilities of battery-powered supply, readout and connectivity for transmission of results. The big size of the global health market and its urgent need for more accessible diagnostics offer attractive opportunities for manufacturers that have the ability to scale up POC applications and reduce prices. While margins may be low in the poorest countries, POC products may allow profitable commercialization in emerging middle-income countries. Those applications that target infections with a heavy burden on global health or that match with those occurring in developed countries may have higher potential for success in the short term.",
