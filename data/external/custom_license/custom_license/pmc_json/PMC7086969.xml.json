The remaining total nucleic acid was then extracted using a QiaAmp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Six libraries were then constructed using a Nextera XT DNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina) and sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform with 250 base-paired ends with dual barcoding for each pool. The information for each library is shown in Supplementary Table S1. For bioinformatics analysis, paired-end reads of 250 bp generated by MiSeq were debarcoded using vendor software from Illumina. An in-house analysis pipeline running on a 32-node Linux cluster was used to process the data. Clonal reads were removed, and low-sequencing-quality tails were trimmed using a Phred quality score of ten as the threshold. Adaptors were trimmed using the default parameters of VecScreen, which was NCBI BLASTn [9] with specialized parameters designed for adaptor removal. The cleaned reads were assembled de novo using SOAPdenovo2 version r240 with a kmer size of 63 with default settings [10]. The assembled contigs, along with singlets, were aligned to an in-house viral proteome database using BLASTx with an E-value cutoff of < 10\u22125 [11].",

In this study, a picornavirus was found in the feces of wild red-crowned crane (Grus japonensis), and tentatively named \u201cgapovirus\u201d (Grus japonensisvirus). We successfully amplified the complete genome of gapovirus, which included a 571-bp 5\u2019 UTR, a 6696-bp polyprotein ORF and a 163-bp 3\u2019 UTR. Like other picornaviruses, the polyprotein of gapovirus could theoretically be cleaved into VP1-4, 2A-2C, and 3A-3D (Fig. 2d). The hypothetical cleavage map of the gapovirus polyprotein was derived from a comparison with other known viruses in the genus Hepatovirus. The P1 polypeptide (793 aa) belongs to the rhv-like superfamily and shares 39.8% amino acid sequence identity to that of bat hepatovirus (GenBank no. KT452729), the highest similarity among members in the genus Hepatovirus. The P1 was assumed to be cleaved at VP4/VP2 (36I/37T), VP2/VP3 (260T/261M) and VP3/VP1 (512Q/513A). The P2 polypeptide of 642 aa contains non-structural proteins and is speculated to be cleaved at 2A/2B (1004D/1005V) and 2B/2C (1108Q/1109S). BLASTp showed that the P2 region had 37% amino acid sequence identity to that of bat hepatovirus (GenBank no. KT452729), Similar to members in the genus Hepatovirus, the P3 polypeptide contains proteins 3A, 3B, 3Cpro (protease) and 3Dpol (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase). The P3 is 796 aa in length and is speculated to be cleaved at 3A/3B (1499A/1500K), 3B/3C (1527Q/1528S) and 3C/3D (1746G/1747R). A BLASTp analysis showed that the P3 polyprotein of gapovirus shared 43% amino acid sequence identity with the rodent virus Tupaia hepatovirus A (GenBank no. NC_028981), the highest similarity among members in the genus Hepatovirus. Phylogenetic analysis was performed on the P2 and P3 regions of gapovirus and representative strains of 35 genera of the family Picornaviridae. The result indicated that gapovirus was not closely related to members of any previously recognized or proposed genera (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. S1), and it formed a separate branch distinguishing it from members of the genera Hepatovirus and Tremovirus (Fig. 2b). The P1 region of gapovirus shares 39.8% amino acid sequence identity to bat hepatovirus, but members of the genus Hepatovirus share over 70% sequence identity with one another (Fig. 2c). According to the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (http://www.picornastudygroup.com/definitions/genus_definition.htm), the members of a picornavirus genus should share > 40%, > 40%, and > 50% amino acid sequence identity in their P1, P2, and P3 region, respectively. Our data indicate that gapovirus qualifies as a member of a novel genus in the family Picornaviridae.",

A nearly complete genome sequence of 7073 bp was determined, including a 591-bp 5\u2019 URT, the complete P1 and P2 regions, and part of the P3 region. The hypothetical cleavage map of the grusavirus polyprotein was derived from alignments with other known viruses of the genus Hepatovirus. The P1 region of grusavirus is assumed to be cleaved at VP4/VP2 (22Q/23D), VP2/VP3 (242N/243A) and VP3/VP1 (495Q/496G). The P1 polypeptide is 772 aa in length, belongs to the rhv-like superfamily, and has the best BLASTp match to phopivirus in genus Hepatovirus (GenBank no. NC_027818). The latter was identified in a seal, sharing 43% amino acid sequence identity in P1 to grusavirus. The P2 region of grusavirus is 636 aa in length and contains nonstructural proteins with cleavage at 2A/2B (E973/T974), and 2B/2C (S1081/I1082). BLASTp analysis showed that the P2 region had 32% amino acid sequence identity to Tupaia hepatovirus A (GenBank no. NC_028981), the highest similarity among members of the genus Hepatovirus. The partial P3 region is 752 aa in length, including complete 3A, 3B, 3C, and partial 3D, and is assumed to be cleaved at 3A/3B (F1463/K1464), 3B/3C (H1489/R1490), and 3C/3D (H1707/R1708). The partial P3 region shared 41% amino acid sequence identity with phopivirus (GenBank no. NC_027818), the highest among members of the genus Hepatovirus. The gapovirus and grusavirus amino acid sequence are 34%, 30%, and 36% identical in P1, P2 and P3, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis based on P1 and P3 showed that grusavirus belongs to a different clade from the members of the genus Hepatovirus, and therefore represents a new genus in the family Picornaviridae (Fig. 2a and 2b).",

Three complete genome sequences and one nearly complete genome sequence were then determined using RT-PCR to bridge gaps between contigs, followed by direct Sanger sequencing, and were tentatively named GrHAV. The polyproteins of those four GrHAVs were 2214 aa, 2125 aa, 2377 aa, and 2178 aa, respectively (Fig. 3a). Hypothetical maps of those four GrHAV polyproteins were derived by comparison with the polyproteins of DHAV strains (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table S3), although some cleavage sites within the region of VP1 to 2A2 were uncertain because of high variation among GrHAVs and DHAVs. The similarity between the four GrHAVs and DHAVs in pairwise comparison of the VP1-2A2 regions ranged from 16% to 25% (Supplementary Fig. S2). The length of the VP1-2A1 region of the four GrHAVs varied in length, (476 aa, 501 aa, 608 aa and 630 aa). Phylogenetic analysis based on the P1 region showed that these four GrHAVs clustered separately from their closest relatives in the genera Avisivirus and Avihepatovirus (Fig. 3b). Pairwise sequence similarity comparison of the P1 regions of these four GrHAVs and the representative strains of the genus Avisivirus and Avihepatovirus showed that the four GrHAVs shared 32.4%-35.9% amino acid sequence identity with different strains of the genus Avihepatovirus and 29.9%-32% amino acid sequence identity with the representative strain of the genus Avisivirus (Fig. 3c). Based on the phylogenetic analysis of P1 region and genetic distance calculations, the four GrHAVs should be assigned to a novel genus in the family Picornaviridae.",

The nearly complete genomes of GAPV1-4 were 4305 bp, 4354 bp, 4274 bp, and 4534 bp in length, respectively, all of which included two ORFs encoded one nonstructural protein (NS) and one structural protein (VP). The length of the NS protein is 663 aa for GAPV1, 660 aa for GAPV2, 657 aa for GAPV3, and 662 aa for GAPV4. The conserved motif \u201cGPSNTGKS\u201d associated with ATPase is present in NS1. The VP protein of the different GAPVs is variable in length. The shortest VP is in GAPV3 (483 aa), followed by GAPV1 (514 aa), GAPV4 (529 aa), and GAPV2 (537 aa), all of which are much shorter than those of the other members of the subfamily Parvovirinae (approximately 700 aa on average). The conserved phospholipase A2 (PLA2) motif that is often present in members of other genera was absent in the VP protein of GAPVs. Phylogenetic analysis of the NS1 amino acid sequences showed that GAPV1-4 clustered with TP1 from a turkey (GenBank no. KF925531) and HK_2014 from a chicken (GenBank no.

The NS1 amino acid identity among the four GAPVs is 40.9%-45.2%. According to ICTV guidelines, parvoviruses sharing > 85% amino acid sequence identity in the NS1 protein belong to the same species.

These viruses were named RCPV1 (red-crowned crane parvovirus) and RCPV2, respectively. The genomes of RCPV1 and RCPV2 were 5,515 bp and 5,456 bp in length, and both contain three ORFs (Fig. 5a).

The right ORF encoded a viral capsid protein (VP) including VP1 and VP2, where the VP1 proteins of RCPV1 and RCPV2 were identical in length, 672 aa, and the VP2 protein was 531 aa long in both RCPVs. Both RCPVs had a middle ORF encoding a 161-aa protein. Pairwise comparison showed that the two RCPVs shared 99.3% amino acid sequence similarity in the NS1 protein and 82% based in VP1 protein.

The nonanucleotide sequences of GaGmCVs were atypical, including only eight nucleotides in this motif, \u201cGGACGAAA\u201d and \u201cGAAACTTA\u201d, respectively (Fig. 6h). BLASTp analysis based on the Rep of GaGmCVs showed that GaGmCV1 shared the highest amino acid sequence similarity (48% identity) with Pacific flying fox feces associated gemycircularvirus 11 (GenBank no. KT732807), and GaGmCV2 shared the highest amino acid sequence similarity (69% identity) with dragonfly-associated circular virus 3 (GenBank no. NC_023870). Phylogenetic analysis based on the amino acid sequence of Rep protein showed that GaGmCVs were located on two separate branches, with GaGmCV2 clustering with dragonfly-associated circular virus 3 (GenBank no. NC_023870), while GaGmCV1 clustered with FaGmV-4 (GenBank no. KF371638) identified in fur seal [25] (Fig. 6a).",

            "text": "The family Circoviridae consists of non-enveloped viruses with a circular single-stranded DNA genome of ~ 2 kb and is currently divided into two genera, Circovirus and Cyclovirus, [26]. The genus circovirus comprises 29 species, members of which have been identified in birds, dogs, minks, pigs, bats and fish [27\u201332]. Circoviruses were originally isolated from various birds. Some Circovirus strains have been associated with a variety of diseases in birds and pigs, including respiratory and enteric disease, dermatitis, and reproductive problems [33, 34]. Here, four genome sequences were assembled from sequences present in red-crowned crane feces. They were temporarily named GaCV1-4. The complete genome sizes were 1,852 bp for GaCV1, 2,288 bp for GaCV2, 1,686 bp for GaCV3, and 1830 bp for GaCV4, all of which encoded two major proteins: CP and Rep (Fig. 6d-g). A BLASTp search based on the Rep proteins indicated that GaCV1-4 shared the highest amino acid similarity of 41%, 41%, 56%, and 45%, respectively, with their most closely related viruses. Phylogenetic analysis over the amino acid sequence of Rep protein confirmed that those four novel circo-like viruses did not belong to the genus Gemycircularvirus or Circovirus (Fig. 6a). GaCV1 and GaCV2 clustered with the Lake Sarah-associated circular virus 1 isolate LSaCV-1-LSCO-2013 (GenBank no. NC_029607), forming a separate branch. GaCV3 clustered with Odonata-associated circular virus 19 isolate OdasCV-19-US-1594LM1-12 (GenBank no.KM598404) forming a separate branch. GaCV4 clustered with Lake Sarah-associated circular virus 50 isolate LSaCV-50-LSCO-2013 (GenBank no. NC_029627), forming a separate branch (Fig. 6a). The stem-loop structures of GaCVs were non-canonical compared with other circoviruses (Fig. 6h).",

Based on an alignment of the amino acid sequences of RaCV and its relatives in GenBank, five potential cleavage sites were found in ORF1, 447Q/S448, 790Q/A791, 1055Q/S1056, 1133Q/N1134, and 1795E/G1796, respectively, which divided the ORF1 polyprotein into Nterm (49.98 kDa), NTPase (37.9 kDa), p29 protein (28.99 kDa), VPg (8.9 kDa), Pro-Pol (73.1 kDa), and VP1 (62.9 kDa) (Fig. 7a). Some conserved CV amino acid motifs within ORF1 were identified, including the NTPase motif 599GPPGIGKT606, the 3C protease motif 1248GDCGLP1253, and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase motifs 1586GLPSG1590 and 1634YGDD1637.
