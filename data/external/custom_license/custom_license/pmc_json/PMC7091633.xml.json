Studies have analyzed the value of VL in BAL in other patient populations, mainly in lung-transplanted patients, in which it is considered that high VL (above 46 000 copies/mL or 500 000 copies/mL) is suggestive of CMV pneumonia.11, 12, 13 In our study, the patients with probable CMV pneumonia had a wide range (670\u2013>10 000 000 copies/mL) of VL and a median above 50 000 copies/mL. However, all patients with a BAL VL less than 1000 copies/mL (including three patients with loads <150 copies/mL) responded to treatment with ganciclovir and had a good evolution, which could be related to an early stage of the disease. Moreover, 75% of patients with VL higher than 50 000 copies/mL, died of refractory pneumonia. The non-response to treatment in patients with high VL could be related to an advanced clinical stage or resistance to ganciclovir. All patients\u2019 plasma VL was lower than in BAL; one patient even had an undetectable plasma VL. This fact was described by other authors,11, 13, 14 which could imply that plasma VL monitoring has limitations to anticipate the development of pneumonia, and therefore low or undetectable viremia levels did not exclude CMV pneumonia. In the only patient with detectable BAL VL, without CMV pneumonia, the BAL VL was not higher than in plasma.",

However, further studies assessing BAL VL in patients who recieve an AHSCT are necessary. We believe that this study, in spite of the low number of patients, is important because there are no publications in which BAL CMV VL was evaluated in patients with AHSCT. It is noted that conventional diagnosis methods in BAL and the plasma VL are limited and have a low performance. Tests to quantify VL of CMV are available in many clinical microbiology laboratories and this is an advantage because they could be used to quantify the BAL VL samples. These results should not be extrapolated to other populations, such as HIV or solid organ transplant recipients.",
