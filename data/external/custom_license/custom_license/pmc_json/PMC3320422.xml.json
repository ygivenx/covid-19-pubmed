We chose this paper because it has the largest circulation of a daily paper in the country (i.e., 530,000 readers out of a national population of 4 million), and its reporting is likely to represent that of other mainstream media. The advanced search capacity at the newspaper's Web site (2) was used with the key search term being \"SARS\" (combined with the other terms detailed in Tables 1 and 2 [3\u20135]; ). The search was confined to the news section of the archive because stories on SARS in the business and sports sections rarely provided information on health aspects.",

This finding suggests that if critical health messages are not picked up by the media in a crisis, then paid advertising could be a backup option (especially to list and explain access to key Web sites).
