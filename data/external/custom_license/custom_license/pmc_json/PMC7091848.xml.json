Since 2003, more than 600 people worldwide have been identified to be infected with avian H5N1 influenza virus with higher mortality rate than that of seasonal flu and even the Spanish flu ( http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/EN_GIP_20131008CumulativeNumberH5N1cases.pdf). Human-to-human transmission of H5N1 viruses is rare and human infections have been primarily limited to people in very close contact with infected birds2,3. Many viruses, including H5N1, mutate readily and produce strains that are no longer manageable using vaccines or currently known antiviral drugs4. The apparent high lethality of H5N1 infections and their potential social impact make it paramount to identify common molecular disease mechanisms as well as new treatment options for H5N1 infections5.",

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and its later discovered sibling ACE2 share homology in their catalytic domain and have opposite functions in the RAS9. ACE cleaves angiotensin I to generate angiotensin II, which is a key effector peptide and exerts multiple biological functions related to cardiovascular and renal biology10. In contrast, ACE2 cleaves a single amino acid residue from Angiotensin II to generate Ang1\u20137 and thereby negatively regulates the RAS by reducing Angiotensin II level11,12. Our previous studies using ACE2-knockout mice have demonstrated that ACE2 protects against acute lung injury (ALI) triggered by acid aspiration and sepsis13. Furthermore, ACE2 has been identified as the essential in vivo receptor for the SARS-Corona virus. SARS-CoV infections and the in vivo administration of the SARS-CoV spike protein reduce ACE2 expression14, suggesting that the RAS is involved in the pathogenesis of ALI and SARS-CoV infections14. Importantly, the administration of recombinant ACE2 has been proven beneficial in improving lung pathologies associated with SARS-CoV spike-, acid aspiration- and sepsis-induced ALI in different species13,14. Based on these data, ACE2 has now entered phase II clinical testing for the treatment of ALI in humans.",

In multiple species, the same clinical syndrome of acute lung failure/ARDS has been observed for various pathogenic conditions including sepsis, gastric acid aspiration or pulmonary infections with SARS-CoV and H5N1 bird flu13,14,19,20,21. In our accompanying paper, we observed elevation of serum angiotensin II in H7N9-infected patients, and more importantly, we showed that serum angiotensin II level was linked to disease severity and outcome22. We therefore wanted to determine whether ACE2 is also involved in H5N1-induced lung injury. Here we show that ACE2 plays an important role in H5N1 virus-induced ALI. In mice, experimental treatment with recombinant hACE2 ameliorates the disease and increases survival rate following H5N1 infection.",

The infection of mice with the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus strain resulted in the rapid downregulation of ACE2 expression in the lungs 24 h after infection (n=3, Fig. 2a) and a concurrent increase of systemic angiotensin II levels in the serum 72 h after infection (n=5\u20136 per group, Fig. 2b). ACE expression was apparently not affected in the lungs of H5N1-infected mice (Fig. 2a). ACE2 expression in the lungs and the serum angiotensin II levels remained unchanged in mice challenged with the less pathogenic H1N1 virus (Fig. 2a,b). Furthermore, sera collected from infected mice on day 3 and day 5 showed that the changes in angiotensin II levels correlated with death (n=14) and survival (n=4) of H5N1-infected mice (Fig. 2c). Thus, similar to our human data, in our experimental mouse models the downregulation of ACE2 and elevation of serum angiotensin II level may also be correlated with the disease severity and lethality of bird flu infections.",

The H5N1 viral load detected in mice lung tissue of ACE2-knockout mice was significantly higher than that of wild-type mice lung 5 days after infection (n=3\u20135 per time point, Fig. 3b,c, Supplementary Fig. 1a). Moreover, the wet-to-dry lung tissue ratio, which is a measure of lung edema, was markedly higher in the ACE2-knockout mice 3 days after infection (n=4\u20136 per group, Fig. 3d), supporting the hypothesis that ACE2 has a protective role against H5N1 virus-induced acute lung failure. H5N1 challenge also resulted in increased inflammatory cell infiltration, and a more severe lung injury score (including increased alveolar wall thickness, formation of hyaline membranes and proteinaceous debris filling the airspaces), in the ACE2-knockout mice (n=3 per group, Fig. 3e). Thus, the genetic inactivation of ACE2 expression results in a lower survival rate and more severe ALI following respiratory H5N1 infections.",

The administration of recombinant ACE2 protein (3 h prior to, 8 h and 3 days after infection, i.p. 100 \u03bcg kg\u22121) prolonged the overall survival time of mice infected with H5N1 virus (Fig. 4a) and decreased the viral replication in mice lungs after H5N1 viral infection (n=3\u20135 per time point, Fig. 4b, Supplementary Fig. 1b). The weight loss of surviving hACE2 protein-treated mice was recovered (Supplementary Fig. 2). Treatment with recombinant hACE2 also markedly reduced the serum level of angiotensin II (n=3\u20134 per time point, Fig. 4c) and the development of edema 4 days after infection (n=3\u20134, Fig. 4d). The lung histopathology induced by H5N1 flu infection was also ameliorated (n=3, Fig. 4e). Moreover, hACE2 treatment improved the impaired lung functions of mice challenged with an inactivated H5N1 virus, as assessed via lung elastance (Supplementary Fig. 3). Of note, lung elastance is the reciprocal of lung compliance, a measure of the change in pressure per unit change in volume representing the stiffness of the lungs26. To assess whether administration of recombinant hACE2 is also effective after virus infection, we treated mice with recombinant hACE2 protein 1 h, 1 day and 2 days after H5N1 infection (i.p. 100 \u03bcg kg\u22121). Recombinant human ACE2 again ameliorated ALI induced in H5N1 infected mice (Supplementary Fig. 4). Further studies are required to assess the therapeutic efficacy of ACE2. Taken together, these data show that avian influenza A H5N1 virus infections cause severe acute lung failure, at least in part, by functionally altering the RAS via ACE2 expression and that H5N1-induced lung injury can be alleviated by the administration of recombinant human ACE2 protein.",

Further studies should include measuring other potential biomarkers in H5N1-infected patients. Previous studies have reported the NS1 protein of influenza can induce disease pathology27,28; however, we could not detect significant changes in ACE2 mRNA or protein expression following overexpression of the H5N1 proteins PB1, PB2, PA, NP, HA, NA, M1, M2, NS1 and NS2 (Supplementary Fig. 5, full blots are provided as Supplementary Fig. 6).

All animal experiments were conducted with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approval from the Institute of Military Veterinary, Academy of Military Medical Sciences. The viruses were propagated via inoculation into 10- to 11-day-old SPF embryonated fowl eggs via the allantoic route. Hemagglutinating allantoic fluid was collected from the eggs, and the viruses were then directly used as live viruses or inactivated using formaldehyde (only lung elastance assays were performed with inactivated virus). MDCK cells and 293T cells were purchased from Peking Union Medical College Cell Culture Center and cultured in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U ml\u22121 penicillin, and 100 \u03bcg ml\u22121 streptomycin at 37 \u00b0C.",
