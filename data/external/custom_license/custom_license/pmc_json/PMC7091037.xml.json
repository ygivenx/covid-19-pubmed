Textile materials particularly made of natural fibers supply an outstanding medium for microbial growth due to their large surface area and ability to retain moisture [26, 43]. Moreover, the problem of degeneration of natural products such as natural wood, cotton, or wool by microorganisms or insects has been faced by human beings since they were first started to be used [1]. Therefore, to prevent undesirable effects such as degradation, unpleasant odors, and potential health risks, textiles are treated with antimicrobial agents [4\u20136, 19]. In order to gain antimicrobial properties, various chemical additives have been applied to textile products such as inorganic salts, organometallics, iodophors (substances that slowly release iodine), phenols and thiophenols, onium salts, antibiotics, heterocyclics with anionic groups, nitro compounds, urea and related compounds, formaldehyde derivatives, amines, and/or other biocidal substances [26].",

Especially methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) [13] and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are creating significant problems in burn and intensive care units despite the improvement in the awareness of nosocomial infections [3, 21, 33]. In the hospital, environment infectious microorganism can be introduced exogenously by other patients or staff members or endogenously from the patients\u2019 own flora. S. aureus has been isolated usually from bedclothes, bed curtains, and the protective clothing of nurses, and they are transmitted by the movement of these goods [2]. The source of nosocomial infections with P. aeruginosa has been found in the wet areas of hospitals and in moist objects, and they are spread by personal contact [39]. Nosocomial infections could be controlled by removing the infection source or preventing the transmission of pathogenic microorganisms from host to patients or materials [38]. In this context, the use of antimicrobial textiles especially in hospitals may prevent microbial growth and reduces the risk of nosocomial infections [34].",

Also, several sulfated polysaccharides and copolymers of acrylic acid with vinyl alcohol sulfate have been demonstrated to have antiviral activity against human cytomegalovirus (CMV) [31]. However, there is lack of knowledge and study about antiviral textile products so far. Occurrence of polio and vaccinia virus on wool and cotton fabrics has been investigated previously. These viruses were recovered up to 20 and 14 weeks, respectively, from wool fabrics that were exposed to the virus, but they persisted for shorter periods of time on the cotton fabrics [10]. Imai et al. investigated the effect of cotton textiles treated with copper ion-exchanged zeolites on the inactivation of avian influenza virus (AIVs), and they showed that highly pathogenic H5N1 and low pathogenic H5N3 viruses were inactivated on the copper ion-exchanged zeolite textile materials even after short incubations [16].",

The modified textile materials decreased both virus titers 60 %. In this study, antiviral tests performed against both DNA and RNA virus models which are AV-5 and PV-1, respectively. From this aspect, combination of 0.03 % T and 3 % SPP applied on textile materials should be effective against enveloped and non-enveloped DNA viruses such as hepatitis B virus (HBV), and they are assumed to be effective against enveloped and non-enveloped RNA viruses such as HIV, HCV, Ebola, MERS, and SARS. Further studies should be conducted for other types of woven and non-woven textile products.",
