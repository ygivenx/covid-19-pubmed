Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is the subtype that develops in 10%\u201340% of patients on mechanical ventilation for at least 48 h [1,2]. Together, these are the second most common and frequent nosocomial infections among hospitalized patients [3]. Identifying causative pathogens is key to antibiotic choice, differential diagnosis, and epidemiological monitoring. The relative prevalence rates of specific causative pathogens in HAP and VAP vary considerably by patient population, duration of hospitalization and mechanical ventilation, prior antibiotic therapy, and the diagnostic methods and criteria [4].",

The most common gram-positive bacteria are methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus. The most common gram-negative bacteria are Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter species, and Enterobacteriaceae which may be either extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase (ESBL)-producing or carbapenem-resistant, including Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing variants [3,5]. Interest has increased in gram-negative pathogens over recent years because they are associated with a higher mortality [6,7]. Moreover, patients treated in intensive care units (ICUs) with an MDR pathogen prevalence of >25% have an increased risk of developing MDR VAP, regardless of other risk factors [7\u20139]. For this reason, determining the frequency of MDR pathogens in ICUs is essential [3,5].",

However, there is limited evidence to support the use of invasive or noninvasive methods to obtain respiratory samples in HAP/VAP [11].",

Less invasive strategies, such as endotracheal aspirates or nasotracheal suctioning, can lead to an over-identification of bacteria [9,10]. Current guidance from the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America therefore states that there is limited evidence to support invasive techniques to obtain respiratory samples in patients with HAP/VAP, instead recommending noninvasive sampling and semiquantitative cultures for most patients [6]. However, the use of clinical criteria and a reliance on semiquantitative cultures can result in false-positive VAP diagnoses and unnecessary antibiotic use [12,13]. For this reason, the European guidelines of 2017 suggest that accuracy could be improved by obtaining distal samples, with quantitative cultures based on bacterial growth of >105 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL for an endotracheal aspirate, >104 CFU/mL for a BAL specimen, and >103 CFU/mL for a protected specimen brush sample [2]. Thereafter, traditional gram staining, cultures, and antibiotic susceptibility testing is necessary for 48\u201398 h.

This approach has high sensitivity but low specificity for diagnosing VAP, and a normal chest radiograph may not be completely excluding pneumonia [17]. Although chest radiography is widely used despite this limitation, computed tomography (CT) remains the gold standard. CT chest has the advantage of detecting subtle lung infiltrates, particularly in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which are often missed on chest radiography [18]. Another noninvasive option is point-of-care lung ultrasound, which has gained popularity in ICUs over recent years [19]. Compared with other methods, lung ultrasound is free of radiation, can be used at the bedside and on pregnant woman, allows for dynamic evaluations, is more accurate than chest radiography for detecting pleural effusions, and takes less time [20]. Although visualizing a consolidated region with a linear/arborescent dynamic air-bronchogram had good specificity (81%), visualization of subpleural consolidation has good sensitivity (81%) and limited specificity (41%) [21]. In experienced hands, a normal lung ultrasound excludes VAP [16]. Lung ultrasound can also be used to monitor infiltrates during active treatment [22].",

Bacterial targets such as Bordetella pertussis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila pneumoniae have also been included in some commercial multiplex respiratory virus PCRs [27,32].

            "text": "A variety of new platforms have been developed to speed up pathogen identification, including sensitivity testing. Assays which have been designed for organism identification include:\nGeneXpert. This is an all-in-one platform designed as a point-of-care testing assay with a turnaround time of under two hours. Thus, results can be available fast enough to affect empiric treatment choices. GeneXpert systems can detect S. aureus or MRSA from colonies or directly from blood cultures, or from nasal, skin, and soft tissue swabs [2,34]. GenXpert uses an automated microfluidic procedure that depends on real-time PCR for S. aureus or MRSA, and the BD GeneOhm MRSA uses real-time PCR with a fluorogenic target hybridization probe [35]. A GeneXpert assay for influenza A and B was compared with two commercially available rapid antigen tests and was shown to have excellent sensitivity (97.3% and 100% for A and B, respectively) and specificity (100%, both) [36]. The use of GeneXpert on lower respiratory tract samples from patients with suspected VAP had high sensitivity (98.4%) and moderate specificity (72%), compared with bacterial culture in the detection of S.aureus [37].BD GeneOhm. This assay uses real-time PCR with a fluorogenic target hybradization probe, designed to detect S. aureus or MRSA in respiratory specimens [35].Rapid molecular assays for the detection of S. aureus have major clinical benefit in that they can determine S. aureus colonization status [38].FilmArray Respiratory Panel. Produced by bioM\u00e9rieux BioFire (Salt Lake City, UT), this array integrates nucleic acid extraction, nested PCR, detection, and data analysis in a single-use pouch. It is the first assay to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the qualitative detection of viral and bacterial nucleic acid targets in nasopharyngeal swab specimens [39]. The FilmArray Respiratory Panel 2 can detect 17 viral targets and the three bacterial species (B. pertussis, C. pneumoniae, and M. pneumoniae) typically associated with pneumonia (Table 1.) This assay has a turnaround time of approximately 1 hour and has been applied to direct respiratory specimens, including BAL specimens from mechanically ventilated patients [40]. Also, given the multifocal nature of VAP, even mini-BAL samples obtained blindly without the use of bronchoscopy can be effective [41]. More recently, the FilmArray Respiratory Panel has been employed to demonstrate that more than 24% of HAP episodes were associated with respiratory virus infection alone or concomitant viral and bacterial infection [42]. The FilmArray Respiratory Panel has recently been extended to include 24 common respiratory pathogens (including 8 gram-positive bacteria, 11 gram-negative bacteria, and 5 Candida species) with global sensitivity of 78.6% and specificity 98.1% compared to conventional microbiologic techniques [43].The LightCycler SeptiFast. This real-time multiplex PCR assay can identify 20 bacterial and fungal species that account for up to 95% of cases of bacteremia/fungaemia. The assay requires lengthy DNA extraction times of between 4 and 6 hours, so it is not optimized for point -of -care testing as yet. In a pilot study, Baudel et al. [44] suggest that multiplex PCR performed on BAL fluid in critically ill patients could improve the rates of pathogen detection in pneumonia (66%) compared with direct examination (23%) and culture (44%) (p < 0,001). The pathogen identification rate provided by multiplex PCR was not modified by prior antibiotic treatment (66% vs. 64%, non-significant) and remained superior to culture (23%, p < 0.001).Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) time-of-flight (TOF) Mass Spectrometry (MS). This is a very powerful microbiological tool that is being gradually implemented for pathogen identification in conjunction with conventional methods [27,28]. MALDI-TOF MS is a protein/peptide-based diagnostic MS method that relies on the measurement of the molecular mass of all cellular proteins to determine the unique global protein profile that is characteristic of the pathogen. In a study of more than 1000 bacterial isolates, MALDI-TOF MS showed a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 84.1% for sample identification compared with conventional systems, taking 6 min/isolate for identification at a cost of 22%\u201332% less than that of current methods [45] It requires pre-treatment for approximately 1 h [46].Huang et al. [47] from the University of Michigan performed a quasi-experimental study to analyze the impact of MALDI-TOF MS in conjunction with intervention by an antimicrobial stewardship team in patients with bloodstream infections. Use of MALDI-TOF MS significantly decreased time to organism identification and improved time to effective antibiotic therapy. It also optimized antibiotic therapy. In a recent prospective large-scale clinical evaluation, a combined MALDI BioTyper and FilmArray BCID-based algorithm significantly shortened the median time to identification (19.5 vs. 41.7 h) with a 5% rate of incorrect or invalid results [48].PLEX-ID Technology. This unique system combines PCR with ES-MS to detect a wide range of pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. The technology has been used in viral upper respiratory tract infections [49] and for the detection of biological markers of inflammation in pneumonia [50]. Two studies by the same group evaluated the diagnostic performance of the IRIDICA PCR/ESI-MS assay with BAL samples from ventilated patients with suspected pneumonia [51,52] and showed promising results. By contrast, Huttner et al. [53] documented a concordance of 45% between PLEX-ID and standard diagnostic methods for bacterial and fungal detection in BAL specimens. Among patients with confirmed pneumonia after bronchoscopy, overall specimen concordance was only 30%. Unfortunately, PLEX-ID cannot currently be recommended as a standard diagnostic tool for the detection of bacteria and fungi in BAL specimens. Among its disadvantages are the potential contamination of the workspace and samples (i.e. it uses an open platform), the difficulty in assessing polymicrobial specimens, and the prohibitive costs [54].\n",

The use of the Verigene assay in bacteremia has been associated with reduced length of stay, reduced mortality, and improved time to optimal antimicrobial therapy [56].SeptiCyte is the only diagnostic tool for infectious disease host gene expression to be approved by FDA [57]. Although it has a short assay time of 4\u20136.5 h, it is generally considered too complex and lengthy for routine clinical use [58].

LAMP relies on auto-cycling strand displacement to generate DNA or RNA (using reverse transcriptase).

The FISH technique is based on fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide probes that bind complementarily to specific target ribosomal RNA sequences of bacteria, yeasts, or other microorganisms. FISH can be used to detect pathogens that are difficult or time consuming to identify by traditional methods, especially when more than one species is present, as occurs with polymicrobial infection typical of VAP. For instance, Metzger et al. [73] observed high rates of concordance (81%\u201395%) between FISH microscopy and conventional microbiologic techniques in detecting organisms in respiratory specimens (BAL) containing target species above and below the diagnostic threshold. Similarly, this technique has been used as a microbiological surveillance method with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 97% compared to standard respiratory cultures [74].",

VOC-guided microbiological identification has been reported using conventional gas chromatography-MS and novel nanocomposite sensor arrays (E-nose) among ventilated patients in ICU [78]. Schnabel et al. [79] found a subset of 12 VOCs that correctly discriminated between VAP-positive and VAP-negative patients with a sensitivity and specificity of 75.8% and 73.0%, respectively. May et al. [80] also described a novel strategy for the rapid diagnosis of VAP, using exhaled breath condensate fluid from heat-moisture exchangers to provide a testing substrate to identify bacterial DNA by PCR. They showed excellent concordance in pathogen identification by PCR of exhaled breath condensate fluid and pathogens isolated from BAL fluid. Additionally, they found that increasing DNA load among serial exhaled breath condensate fluid samples predicted subsequent VAP. The utility of VOCs produced by respiratory pathogens is therefore of great interest, particularly as a noninvasive early diagnostic tool for HAP/VAP. Serial VOC samples are simple to acquire and may allow for preemptive or targeted preventative treatment of early VAP or tracheobronchitis. A large multicenter European study is in progress to evaluate the utility and performance of VOC-guided diagnosis for VAP (BreathDx NTR 6114) [81].",

Thus, we urgently need studies to be conducted with these new molecular technologies, especially in patients with VAP. The gold standard method for diagnosing VAP must remain BAL samples, but comparison should be made to endotracheal aspirates and to conventional methods. However, this should be done in the knowledge that BAL samples are particularly challenging to work with and that contamination with purulent debris from respiratory epithelial and inflammatory cells may render samples difficult to assay by nucleic acid amplification or proteomic techniques [83]. Additionally, studies are needed that evaluate the clinical utility of rapid microorganism identification via molecular methods with BAL fluid in VAP. In a pre-/post-implementation study, Mok et al.

NATs are more sensitive than gold standard cell culture methods for the diagnosis of respiratory viruses and are more specific than antigen detection tests, including immunochromatographic and immunofluorescence assays [29]. However, these new technologies also have important limitations. They are unable to differentiate colonization from infection, which could be highly problematic in mechanically ventilated patients. They are also unable to give the true susceptibility patterns of the responsible pathogens. For example, although Peptide Nucleic Acid -FISH (PNA-FISH) can provide rapid identification and susceptibility information, the method is limited by its ability to identify relatively few organisms and by being labor intensive in its current formulation [85]. By comparison, MALDI-TOF can identify many more organisms with a comparatively straightforward method. Although nucleic acid extraction-independent assays such as MALDI-TOF MS, microarrays and LAMP are promising, these are currently limited by the limited range of organisms that can be detected. Among the main drawbacks of most of these new techniques are that they rely on qualitative evaluations, they are subject to contamination risk, their costs are often prohibitive, and they often lack validation.",
