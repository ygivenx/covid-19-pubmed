This is often attributed to the low concentration of IgG offered in most commercial supplements and poor absorption kinetics (Haines et al. 1990). Zaremba et al. (1993) showed that administration of 85 g of dried colostrum powder did not lead to significantly higher IgG concentrations 24 h after birth than administration of 3 kg of colostrum. Morbidity and mortality rates were not significantly different among groups. However, the first group of calves that were fed with colostrum supplement alone did not receive fresh colostrum after birth in the study of Zaremba et al. (1993). This is contrary to our study in which all calves were fed with fresh milk within 6 h of birth, and dried colostrum was used as a supplementary feeding at least 24 h after birth.",
