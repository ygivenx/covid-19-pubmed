To choose the location for collecting particulate matter samples, one should consider the target airborne microbial community to be studied. For collecting atmospheric particulate matter samples, locations without major interference sources nearby are recommended. For example, in our previous study8, we were interested in the atmospheric airborne microbial community, and hence the PM2.5 and PM10 (particulate matter with nominal mean aerodynamic diameters of \u22642.5 and \u226410 \u03bcm, respectively) samples were collected from the rooftop of a two-story building on Tsinghua University campus, a site that has been used to monitor atmospheric air pollution in Beijing since 1999 (refs. 20, 21, 22). Particulate matter can be collected on 20.32 cm \u00d7 25.4 cm Tissuquartz filters that have 99.9% typical aerosol retention efficiency. Sample collection can be conducted by high-volume air samplers with an average air flow rate of 1.13 m3/min (Fig. 2a), the inlets of which have been shown to be effective with wind speeds of up to 24 km/h (ref. 23). This results in \u223c1,559 m3 of air flow-through per sampling day (typically 23 h, allowing 1 h for changing filters), which is important to ensure a sufficient mass of input sample (typically in the range of tens to hundreds of milligrams) to be collected. In our previous study8, we used a total of three high-volume air samplers: two of which were equipped with PM2.5 fractionating inlets and one with a PM10 fractionating inlet (Fig. 2b,c). Weigh each filter before and after sampling (Fig. 2d), and all samples can be used immediately or stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until the next step.",

Owing to the low mass of collectable particulate matter samples and the DNA-binding properties of silica fibers in the Tissuquartz filter, we designed a series of sample pretreatment steps to optimize the yield of genomic DNA (Fig. 1). Considering the different mass of input materials from the collected PM2.5 and PM10 samples, we typically use one-fourth of a PM10 filter (\u223c103.04 cm2) and 1.5 or 2 pieces of PM2.5 filters (collected by two samplers on the same day) for sample pretreatment and subsequent DNA extraction. The filters are cut into four equal-sized pieces (8.96 cm \u00d7 11.5 cm each; Fig. 2e), which are rolled and inserted into 50-ml Falcon tubes filled with sterilized 1\u00d7 PBS buffer (Fig. 2f). The particulate matter samples are then pelleted at 4 \u00b0C by low-speed centrifugation at 200g for 3 h. After brief, gentle vortexing, the resuspension is filtered through a 0.2-\u03bcm Supor 200 PES Membrane Disc Filter (Fig. 2g,h). The above wash and filter recollection (pretreatment) steps are necessary to help separate most of the biological contents from the quartz filters before DNA extraction for improved extraction efficiency. In addition, the pretreatment of particulate matter sample reduces the sample volume needed for DNA extraction, and thus it allows the use of AMPure XP beads for genomic DNA extraction at a reasonable cost. Quantification of the recovered genomic DNA and quantitative PCR (qPCR) results suggested that the extraction efficiency of microbial DNA from particulate matter was optimized by applying the pretreatment step and by using AMPure XP beads compared with other methods (Table 1 and Fig. 3a). After the wash and filter recollection, we cut the PES Membrane Disc Filter into small pieces for DNA extraction using commercial kits. All the above steps should be carried out in a decontaminated biosafety cabinet.",

First, the samples are heated to 65 \u00b0C (instead of at room temperature (25 \u00b0C)) in PowerBead tubes (included in the PowerSoil kit) for 15 min; this is followed by vortexing for 15 min.

Because the concentrations of the extracted genomic DNA are typically below the reliable detection limit of common DNA quantification instruments such as the NanoDrop Spectrophotometer (the detection limit of which is typically in the range of a few ng/\u03bcl), we recommend using a fluorescent double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)-binding dye assay on the Qubit Fluorometer, which has a detection limit of dsDNA at 10\u2013100 pg/\u03bcl. The low concentrations of DNA also do not permit visualization on a regular agarose gel, and thus gel electrophoresis is not required. If needed, we recommend using the Lonza FlashGel system, which can be used to visualize DNA bands at quantities as low as 0.1 ng. qPCR of the genomic DNA samples using 16S rRNA gene universal primers can be used to assess the quality of the extracted DNA (a step that is recommended but not required). Amplification curves with lower threshold cycle (Ct) values suggest the presence of more bacterial DNA in the extracted genomic DNA and thus better sample quality.

We recommend using the Illumina sequencing platforms for the high data throughput and low per-base cost. The sequencing library construction and template preparation can be performed using the NEBNext ultra DNA library prep kit (by following the steps for input DNA <50 ng) or by using the modified protocol provided in this paper. In our previous study8, we constructed barcoded, paired-end libraries with an insert size of \u223c500 bp for each sample. To ensure sample consistency, the entire volume of extracted DNA sample, or an aliquot of 5 ng of DNA from each sample (for DNA samples >5 ng), is used for library preparation. The lowest quantity of input genomic DNA from which we have successfully prepared Illumina sequencing library was 3.84 ng (ref. 8). The quality of the libraries should be validated by the Agilent 2100 platform before Illumina sequencing; the existence of a single, wide peak at 500\u2013800 bp in electropherogram suggests good library quality (Fig. 3b\u2013d).",

For HiSeq sequencing, each sample can be barcoded (added during library preparation), and equal quantities of barcoded libraries can be multiplexed during sequencing. The use of other alternative high-throughput sequencing platforms is possible, and the manufacturer's instructions on the library preparation and sequencing should be followed. Attention should be paid to the throughput and requirement of input genomic DNA.

Methods for data analysis vary greatly, depending on the specific needs of the study26,27,28, but they typically involve removal of the adapter sequences, low-quality reads and duplicate reads, followed by alignment or assembly of the short reads. For the purpose of identifying microbial species8, HiSeq reads are aligned to a cohort of nonredundant National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) complete genomes using the Short Oligonucleotide Analysis Package (SOAP) alignment tool29, which is typically faster to run than the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) or the BLAST-like Alignment Tool (BLAT).

Owing to the low mass and low biological content, particulate matter samples are sensitive to laboratory and other environmental contaminations, and thus extensive efforts to avoid contamination should be taken in the sample collection, pretreatment and DNA extraction steps. The Tissuquartz filters used for sample collection should be sterilized by baking in a muffle furnace at 500 \u00b0C for 5 h before sampling. The sterilized filters can be individually packaged in sterilized aluminum foil and stored in self-sealing plastic bags until use. The filter holder and all the tools used for changing new filters should also be cleaned with 75% (vol/vol) ethanol, or they should be autoclaved (if possible) every day to avoid cross-contamination. In the sample pretreatment and DNA extraction steps, the reusable scissors, forceps and filter funnels should be sterilized before use. The use of sterile surgical gloves and face masks is also recommended. To assess the degree of potential contamination, negative-control experiments should be conducted by placing a sterilized filter in the sampler without collecting a sample, followed by an identical sample pretreatment and DNA extraction process to that used when samples are collected.",

            "text": "The protocol described here enables the extraction of airborne microbial genomic DNA from collected particulate matter for metagenomic sequencing. In our experience, most of the particulate matter samples collected daily in the city of Beijing weigh in the range of tens to hundreds of milligrams, and each sample typically yields 5\u201350 ng of genomic DNA. By using the improved library preparation protocol described here, this quantity is sufficient for direct library preparation without requiring 16S rRNA gene amplification or whole-genome amplification. So far, we have applied this protocol to the extraction of airborne microbial genomic DNA from a total of 30 particulate matter samples (half of which were PM2.5 and the other half were PM10). \u223c90% of these samples yielded genomic DNA of \u22655 ng, were qPCR positive and produced good-quality sequencing libraries (Fig. 3). We show that although it is possible to extract DNA directly from the collected particulate matter samples by shredding the quartz filter without pretreatment, the extraction efficiency can be affected (Table 1, Fig. 3a), probably owing to the presence of DNA-binding quartz fibers. Moreover, extracting DNA using the MO-BIO PowerMax kit without pretreatment would require the use of >10-fold more AMPure XP beads per sample owing to the larger sample volume, and thus we recommend adding the wash and filter recollection steps for the higher extraction efficiency and lower cost. We also show that the use of AMPure XP beads to replace a column for DNA recovery in the DNA extraction and library preparation steps improves the yield (Table 1, Fig. 3a); otherwise, higher amounts of input materials would be required for library preparation and metagenomic sequencing.",

Amplification curves with lower Ct values suggest the presence of more bacterial DNA in the extracted genomic DNA and thus better sample quality. The qPCR data (color-coded and ranked top-down from the lowest Ct to the highest), together with the DNA concentration data presented in Table 1, suggest that the method of using pretreatment with bead purification provides higher DNA yield than all the other methods tested above. The addition of the pretreatment step improves the yield of DNA extraction, and using beads for DNA purification is more effective than using column.
