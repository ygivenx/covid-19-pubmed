CoVs have gained attention since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002\u20132003 when SARS-related CoV (SARS-CoV) was identified (Anderson et al. 2004). SARS-CoV is the cause of human lower respiratory tract diseases such as bronchitis and pneumoniae (Holmes 2003; Girard et al. 2005; Peiris et al. 2004). In 2012, one more CoV was isolated in Saudi Arabia and named MERS-CoV. This virus belongs to lineage C of beta-coronaviruses (Zaki et al. 2012). According to a World Health Organization (WHO) survey, 2143 cases of MERS-CoV infections were reported, and 750 people were killed in 27 countries by March 2018. In South Korea, 186 people were infected by MERS-CoV, and 36 people died in 2015. The symptoms of the MERS-CoV infection in South Korea included fever, cough, upper respiratory tract signs, lower respiratory tract distress with lymphopenia and elevated liver enzymes, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and multiple organ system failure (Zhang et al. 2016). MERS-CoV is reportedly transmitted to humans generally from bats or dromedary camels, but the exact route of infection has not yet been identified (Who Mers-Cov Research Group 2013; Yin and Wunderink 2018; Mackay and Arden 2017).",

            "text": "MERS-CoV consists of four major protein complexes: spike (S) glycoprotein, nucleocapsid (N) phosphoprotein, Membrane (M) glycoprotein and small envelope (E) glycoprotein (Mustafa et al. 2018; Boheemen et al. 2012; Almaz\u00e1n et al. 2013; Scobey et al. 2013). The S protein is a major protein and consists of the S1 subunit with an RBD domain and the S2 subunit with the HR 1 and HR 2 domains. The RBD domain on the S1 subunit was reported to bind with human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4, CD26) during the attachment of the virus to the target cell (Li 2015a; Lu et al. 2013; Raj et al. 2013). On the other hand, membrane fusion between the virus and the target cell was reported to be done by the HR 1 and HR 2 domains of the S2 subunit after the RBD domain interacts with hDPP4 (Gao et al. 2013; Lu et al. 2014). The M protein is a transmembrane protein of the viral envelope and functions in the morphogenesis or assembly of MERS-CoV in the Golgi complex interacting with other viral proteins (Yang et al. 2013). MERS-CoV M protein inhibits type I interferon expression by interacting with TNF receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) which leads to the inhibition of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) activation (Lui et al. 2016). Many research groups have developed antibodies against MERS-CoV using a synthetic protein of the S1 or S2 subunit as an antigen while some other research groups have focused on hDPP4 as a new target antigen (Lu et al. 2014; Wang et al. 2015; Du et al. 2014; Li et al. 2015b; Tao et al. 2015; Ohnuma et al. 2013; Raj et al. 2014). However, production of an antibody against the M protein has not been well studied yet.",

CpG\u2013DNA has an adjuvant activity and the ability to modulate the innate immune response (Lee et al. 2006). When CpG\u2013DNA was encapsulated with phosphatidyl-\u03b2-oleoyl-\u03b3-palmitoyl ethanolamine (DOPE):cholesterol hemisuccinate (CHEMS) complex, CpG\u2013DNA showed a significant adjuvant effect increasing antibody production against protein antigens such as ovalbumin and hen egg lysozyme (Kim et al. 2011a). We also developed CpG\u2013DNA encapsulated with the DOPE:CHEMS complex as an adjuvant to produce a synthetic peptide epitope-specific antibody without conventional carriers. We reported that the CpG\u2013DNA encapsulated with the DOPE:CHEMS induced the production of antibodies against epitope peptides from viruses such as hepatitis C virus (Kim et al. 2011b), influenza virus (Rhee et al. 2012), and respiratory syncytial virus (Park et al. 2015). Furthermore, we validated the adjuvant effects of the CpG\u2013DNA encapsulated with the DOPE:CHEMS on the synthetic epitope peptide of TM4SF5 as a hepatocellular carcinoma antigen (Kwon et al. 2012).",

In a preliminary experiment, the mAb M158-2D6F11 recognized two types of protein bands with molecular weights of about 20 and 25 kDa in MERS-CoV infected Vero cells but not in the control Vero cells. The larger protein band of 25 kDa was the major form seen in lane 3 of Fig. 3a, b. Because the M protein of MERS-CoV is a glycoprotein, there could exist a fully glycosylated mature form and a not-yet-glycosylated or de-glycosylated form of the M protein. To confirm whether the two types of protein bands are the same protein produced by a protein modification, we repeated the same experiments but treated the cell lysates with a PBS control or PNGase F. As seen in Fig. 3a, b, the band intensity of the smaller protein increased in response to the PNGase F treatment suggesting that the protein bands of 25 and 20 kDa represent the glycosylated and de-glycosylated forms of the M protein, respectively. Because both protein bands were detected by the mAb M158-2D6F11, we conclude that the mAb M158-2D6F11 can recognize the M protein irrespective of the N-glycosylation probably because the two asparagine residues in the epitope region are known not to be glycosylated. When we analyzed the protein band of 20 kDa obtained by immunoprecipitation with the mAb M158-2D6F11 (Fig. 3b) using mass spectroscopy, the protein was proved to be M protein of MERS-CoV (data not shown).",

Yang et al. showed that the C-terminal domain of the M protein of MERS-CoV leads to the inhibition of type I interferon expression in response to virus infection. The M protein interacts with TRAF3 and disrupts the TRAF3\u2013TBK1 interaction resulting in the inhibition of IRF3 activation (Lui et al. 2016). Therefore, the M protein of MERS-CoV has been investigated as a therapeutic target. In this context, we selected the M protein as a target for antibody production.",
