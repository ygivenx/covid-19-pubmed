            "text": "Thiosemicarbazones are important class of synthetic products and potential biologically active compounds. Domagk, et al. [1] first reported that thiosemicarbazone pharmacophore had antituberculosis activity. Then, antiviral activity of benzaldehyde thiosemicarbazone derivatives against vaccina virus in mice was found by Hamre, et al. [2]. The antiviral activity of isatin-\u03b2-thiosemicarbazone (IBT) and N-methyl-isatin-\u03b2-thiosemicarbazone (commercially known as Methisazone or Marboran) was widely investigated against orthopoxviruses in the 1960s [3]. After these discoveries, thiosemicarbazones draw considerable interest due to their application in the pharmaceutical chemistry and proved to be chemotherapeutic agents potentially useful for inhibiting cancer cells [4]. For example, 3-aminopyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone (commercially known as Triapine) inhibited the biosynthesis of DNA in murine leukemia L1210 cells by blocking the activity of ribonucleotide reductase [5].",

            "text": "In recent years, it has been commonly accepted that agents containing more than one pharmacophore can have superior efficacy as compared to single-pharmacophore drugs [6]. Pharmacophore hybridization is a method of rational drug design, and a single molecule containing different modes of action can be beneficial for the treatment of diseases. As an important pharmacophore, bis-alkylating nitrogen mustard such as chlormethine, melphalan, chlorambucil and many more have anticancer activities against hematologic tumors, myeloma, ovarian cancer and solid tumors [7]. Alkylating agents are electrophilic entities that interact with nucleophilic moieties of DNA resulting in the covalent transfer of an alkyl group. Another pharmacophore para-substituted aryl nitrile, which is bioisostere of a ketone group, has a variety of anticancer activities, e.g., against hormonally-responsive breast cancer (letrozole), breast cancer (neratinib), prostate cancer (bicalutamide), pancreatic cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, head and neck cancer (L-778,123, phase I), and chronic myelogenous leukemia (bosutinib, SKI-606, phase III) [8].",

Encouraged by these results and aimed at developing effective anticancer agents, we designed two series of thiosemicarbazones by the pharmacophore hybridization method using two or more different pharmacophores in view of prospecting their cytostatic and antiviral activity (Fig. 1). In order to gain detailed information about this issue and to develop effective anticancer agents for future studies, we have performed virtual screening of the aforementioned compounds by using Gaussian09 and Discovery Studio 3.5 software [10, 11].",

Assignments of selected diagnostic IR bands provided significant indication for the formation of the thiosemicarbazone derivaderivatives. All thiosemicarbazone derivatives (Ia-g and IIa-g) exhibited two intense bands in the region of 3396 \u2013 3266 cm-1 and 3162 \u2013 3120 cm-1 due to \u03bd(N-H) stretching. The strong band at 839 \u2013 818 cm-1 was present due to \u03bd(C=S) stretching. It was suggested that thiosemicarbazones in the solid phase remain in the thione form. In addition, the characteristic azomethine stretching vibrations \u03bd(C=N) at 1587 \u2013 1543 cm-1 were observed, which also confirmed the formation of thiosemicarbazones [16]. Results of the 1H NMR integrations and signal multiplicities were in line with the proposed structures and other spectral data. The 1H NMR spectra of Ia \u2013 Ig and IIa \u2013 IIg showed a singlet peak attributable to the =N-NH proton in arange of \u03b4 = 12.60 \u2013 11.62 ppm as well as a singlet peak attributable to the PhNH proton in the range \u03b4 = 10.80 \u2013 9.92 ppm. The signal of the azomethine proton (HC=N) appeared as a singlet at \u03b4 = 8.63 \u2013 8.04 ppm [16]. All aromatic protons were observed with the expected chemical shift (\u03b4 = 8.48 \u2013 6.80 ppm) and coupling constant in the NMR spectra of all thiosemicarbazone derivatives. The 13C NMR spectra of the thiosemicarbazones exhibited two important signals at \u03b4 = 176.92 \u2013 174.23 and at \u03b4 = 143.89 \u2013 142.57 ppm assigned to thioamide (C=S) and imine (C=N) carbon atoms, respectively. The signals at \u03b4 = 164.01 \u2013 112.06 ppm in the spectra were assumed to be due to the aromatic carbons. The MS spectra of all thiosemicarbazones were in line with the proposed structures.",

Table 1 presents data of mass spectroscopy and elemental analysis for aromatic thiosemicarbazones Ia \u2013 Ig and I\u00fda \u2013 IIg.",

In this study, we used compound Ig as the bioactive conformation with IC50 values between 0.30 and 2.50 \u03bcg/mL. The pharmacophore models were generated based on the main features of compound Ig. These features were Hb-Acceptor, Hb-Donor, Hydrophobic and Ring Aromatic in the pharmacophore models. Besides, the Genetic Function Approximation (GFA) model for the selectivity of pharmacophores was used. The best model was determined with the help of Clusters pharmacophores subprotocol.

Atwo-tailed, unpaired t-test (GraphPad Prism) revealed no significant difference between the cytostatic inhibition values of Ig and cisplatin obtained against the three tumor cell lines (p = 0.647). The results showed that compounds Ia \u2013 Ig containing electron-withdrawing group, such as -CN located at the para position of the benzene ring, increased the cytostatic activity, according to the electron-donating group (-SCH3) at the same position of the structure (like compounds IIa \u2013 IIg). Furthermore, the introduction of electron-donating groups (-OH, -OCH3) at the para position of the benzene ring weakened the cytostatic effects. While the same situation for electron-withdrawing groups (-F, -NO2,-CF3) was also observed, compound IIb exhibited moderate activity against all tumor cell types. Besides, compound 1g displayed the better cytostatic activity than its analog compound IIg, which has an electron-donating group (-SCH3) at the para position.
