This public health authority has been upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in all cases (4), except when it is was clearly a subterfuge for racial discrimination (5), and in 1950, every state and local health department had clear powers to conduct case-finding and isolate or quarantine persons who represented a potential public health risk (6).",

Nonetheless, many states rewrote their isolation and quarantine laws to provide varying levels of mandatory judicial review, in some cases requiring that a person be provided counsel and an opportunity for a trial before detention. Such proceedings take so much time and money that they make it almost impossible to impose quarantine (11).",

Administrative review is used routinely in state and federal agency proceedings, including for mental health commitments in Maryland (12). Courts have required more due process for mental health commitments than for quarantines; this difference is strong evidence that administrative review would be an acceptable alternative for public health orders. Such reviews can be appealed to the courts, but having the agency do the first review makes a factual record that allows quick and efficient judicial review. A petitioner can be required to go through an agency appeal before a habeas corpus review by the courts (13).",

Telephone interviews could be used to allow personal statements without the danger of in-person testimony. The decision maker would make a brief, written ruling based on predefined classifications. This ruling could be reviewed by an agency appeals board and would greatly simplify any subsequent appeal to the courts (14).
