Five 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-co-terminal subgenomic mRNAs are transcribed from the IBV genome in virus-infected cells [6]. The Gene1 (replicase gene) of IBV contains two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) ORF 1a and ORF 1b, of which the latter is translated to polyprotein pp 1ab by \u22121 frameshift translation [7]. These polyproteins are proteolytically processed into smaller products, e.g., papain-like proteinase (PLpro), main proteinase (Mpro), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and RNA helicase, et al., which are involved in RNA synthesis and other aspects of viral pathogenesis. Recently, the replicase gene was demonstrated to be a determinant of pathogenicity in IBV by reverse genetics [8]. Four structural proteins including spike (S) glycoprotein, small envelope (E) protein, membrane (M) glycoprotein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein are encoded by mRNA 2, 3, 4, and 6, respectively [7\u20139]. The S protein is cleaved into S1 and S2, of which S1 produces neutralizing and serotype-specific antibodies [3, 9].",

H120, an attenuated live vaccine strain of Massachusetts (Mass) serotype, was originally obtained by serial passage of strain H (isolated in the Netherlands [15] in 1956) in embryonated chicken eggs up to the 120th passage. It has been used worldwide as a primary vaccine in broilers, breeders, and future layers for more than 50 years. Even in recent years, H120 is still popular used and commonly considered to conform to the rigorous safety standards required for avian vaccines (review by Bijlenga et al. [15]). However, the protection of H120 was also reported to be poor against some Chinese field strains [12], raising the issues of further evaluating the antigenicity and security of H120 from genome level.",

            "text": "Recombination in coronavirus is generally believed to occur via template switching mechanism [26, 27], and it is predicted that recombination occurs more frequently at RNA sites of strong secondary structure, since these structures promote transcriptional pausing [28]. Potential recombination \u201chot spots\u201d are reported to be located adjacent to the putative recombinant junctions, and all of these \u201chot spots\u201d are described to be AT-rich motifs, e.g., CT(T/G)AACAA [10], (A/T/G)TTTTG, CTTTTG [26, 29]. However, a previous report indicated that the crossover sites were distributed almost randomly when recombination of coronavirus was examined under non-selective conditions [30]. In current study, AT-rich motifs (TTTTG or T(T/A)(G/T)AACAA) were found in regions adjacent to nearly all the putative crossover sites. Even though, it is still difficult to determine whether these motifs are related to the recombination or they just appear around the recombinant sites by chance, because these motifs are detected frequently (119 times for TTTTG and 50 times for AACAA) in the genome of H120.",
