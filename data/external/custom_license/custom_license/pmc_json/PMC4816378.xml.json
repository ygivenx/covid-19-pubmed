In addition, at each clinic, trained personnel obtained pharyngeal swab samples from study participants, and, the same day, a designated hospital staff member collected and sent all specimens to the corresponding district laboratory. The collaborating district laboratories isolated and identified GAS strains and then sent the isolates to Beijing CDC for emm typing, superantigen determination, and antimicrobial drug susceptibility testing.

In Beijing, the incidence of scarlet fever usually peaks twice a year in 2 distinct seasons\u2014summer and winter\u2014with the highest peak in early summer; however, it is well-recognized that scarlet fever most commonly occurs in winter/spring in other locations (24,25). This finding indicates that in China, GAS is transmitted more easily in early summer than in winter, possibly because in early summer, compared with winter, each year an emm type that is relatively new to young children sweeps through a population of children that does not have an effective level of population immunity. In addition, the winter peak in 2010 was higher than the summer peak, which implies that this epidemic of scarlet fever started at the end of 2010.",

Scarlet fever outbreaks also occurred in Hong Kong and Shanghai, China, during 2011, and emm12 was the predominant circulating type (28\u201330). These findings suggest that some intrinsic factors might have facilitated the spread of emm12 strains and led to the epidemic. Two previously unreported genomic insertions (64.9 kb and 46.4 kb) were identified in emm12 GAS strains isolated during the 2011 scarlet fever outbreak in Hong Kong. However, analysis of emm12 strains isolated during 2005\u20132010 showed that the insertions were also present in those strains (28), and the study concluded that mobile genetic elements, environmental factors, and host immune status might have contributed to the 2011 scarlet fever outbreak in Hong Kong.",
