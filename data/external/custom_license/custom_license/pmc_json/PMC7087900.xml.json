The result has been unprecedented advances in our understanding of the genetic architecture of almost all common complex diseases. The main driving force behind these discoveries has been the rapid development and application of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Although there has been remarkable recent progress in defining the genetic basis of common complex diseases, a new generation of epidemiological studies that undertake standardised, fine-scale phenotyping and exposure assessments of many thousands of individuals measured repeatedly during many years of follow-up will be required to maintain this trajectory. New approaches for storing, processing, and characterising the tissue samples collected in these individuals will be necessary, as will the application of novel, comprehensive, and multi-factorial statistical methods to analyse data harvested from these biosamples.",

These studies focus on chronic diseases diagnosed later in life, and some also collect detailed data on lifestyle factors. There are, however, very few large prospective studies focusing on disorders that emerge early in life, in some instances during infancy or early adolescence. LifeLines in Holland [6], a three-generation population-based study with a household recruitment approach differs from most other ongoing cohorts because data on diseases with onset early in life is collected. The Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort study (MoBa) [7], ALSPAC (the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children) [8] and the US National Child Study [9] have followed pregnant mothers from early pregnancy and their offspring throughout childhood, whilst other prospective birth cohort studies were brought together under the Global Asthma and Allergen European Network (Ga2len) [10]. The Southampton Women\u2019s Survey [11] is of particular interest because it collected parental exposure data before the pregnancy and thus could assess associations to perinatal and infant outcomes. Pre-pregnancy exposure data are also likely to be valuable in long-term studies of chronic disease later in life, although to date no such studies have been undertaken.",

As a complement to the register-based epidemiologic tradition, Sweden is also at the forefront of developing and implementing information technology, cutting edge biotechnology and biobanking. In order to adequately address gene-environment interactions, acquisition of phenotype and exposure information repeatedly, biosamples and physiological assessment are important. A prospective study combining information on exposures as early as pre-conception and in early life throughout young and mid-adulthood, with the possibility to study a variety of diseases with onset relatively early in life and co-morbidities later in life will open up new research opportunities.",

Recruitment of index people aged 18\u201345 years old who are invited to include their household members (other adults and any children) increases the opportunity to involve young couples prior to and during pregnancy, allowing for the first study of children born into cohort with complete pre- and perinatal data from both the mother and father. Other types of event-based sampling, i.e. data collection initiated as a result of a relevant event, such as an accident or influenza, is a key feature of LifeGene. A comprehensive web-based questionnaire comprised of multifaceted questions concerning phenotypes and exposures is administered at baseline, briefly followed-up annually, and re-administered every 5 years thereafter. Biosamples are collected and stored in a manner that facilitates the full range of \u2018omics\u2019, and physical measurements are also sampled repeatedly at 5 year intervals. Questions and sampling schemes will be tailored to the participants\u2019 age and life events. The target of LifeGene is to enrol 500,000 Swedes and follow them for at least 20 years.",

Exposure to infectious agents has a broader impact on health and disease as compared to infections strictu sensu. Chronic inflammation, in part induced by infection, may impact on a number of diseases; prime examples of infections associated with malignant transformation are infections with Helicobacter pylori or human papilloma virus type 16. Perhaps the most recent report which links a retroviral infection with chronic fatigue syndrome shows that gauging infections entails far more than just the examination of acute clinical infections. It also showed that retrospective analysis of old diseases may lead to the identification of novel pathogens [12]. Novel and more sensitive methods to detect infectious pathogens as well as gauging relevant immune responses will help elucidate associations between infections and clinical syndromes.",

Focus was mainly on lifetime prevalence (not current or interval), and need to capture age of onset, age of offset, and number of episodes. A set of impulse control disorders of clear public health relevance are also assessed (e.g., pathological gambling).

The LifeGene infrastructure and possibilities to sample in response to events was planned before the H1N1 viral epidemic emerged. Event-based reports in the LifeGene-ILI allowed sampling prior to disease onset (and vaccination), a household sampling triggered by a positive H1N1 or Corona virus diagnosis confirmed by PCR and followed by a post-seasonal sampling.

A physical activity assessment feasibility study was also conducted in young mothers and their 4 month old babies. The studies compared estimates of physical activity energy expenditure derived from three activity monitors with validation obtained from the standard criterion method of doubly labelled water (DLW).A meal-based food frequency questionnaire (Meal-Q) was developed for the web-based questionnaire and validated against DLW, nutrient-related biomarkers and/or 7 days of food records in different age groups. Due to limitations on numbers of food items that can be assessed in a short time, it is important to adapt the method to diets currently consumed by adults, teens, adolescents, children and infants. The selection of food items to be included in Meal-Q was therefore based on age-specific studies using 24 h recall or food records. Physical activity questionnaires (Active-Q) were developed that were similarly adapted to the usual domains of leisure and occupational activity as well as regular transportations in the various age groups, and validated using DLW, accelerometers and/or 7 days records of activities in different age groups.In another LifeGene pre-pilot, dust samples were collected to assess the stability of allergens and endotoxins over time and the variability in allergen content related to fresh, frozen and thawed extracts.\n",

Based on the Swedish population, the proposed pilot size allows us to estimate the response rate in each age and sex stratum within 5% with 95% probability. The testing sites were chosen to reflect various combinations of geographical location, population density, and association with a university. Thus, we chose a large city (Stockholm, capital of Sweden with almost 2 million inhabitants), a university city (Ume\u00e5, in the north with 111,000 inhabitants) and a smaller town (Alings\u00e5s, in the west with 36,000 inhabitants). The LifeGene pilot study was launched in Stockholm in October, 2009, followed by the Ume\u00e5 pilot in late November 2009 and Alings\u00e5s in January 2010, and all testing was stopped on March 31, 2010. The testing schedule was designed to generate the number of participants at the proposed testing centres that would stretch the limits of the biobanking facility\u2019s ability to process samples within specified parameters and fully test logistics regarding chilled transport. Figure 3 shows the expected age distribution of participants in the pilot.\n",

The wide array of high-tech tools encompassed by e-epidemiology will facilitate the longitudinal aspects of the study. Recruitment of index people 18\u201345 years old, who are invited to include their adult household members and children, will increase the opportunity to involve young couples prior to and during pregnancy, allowing for the first study of children born into a cohort with complete pre- and perinatal data from both mother and father. Furthermore, by focusing on index individuals in young and mid-adulthood in a household structure, we will be able to assess exposures and disease progression for a myriad of disorders that have considerable consequences not only for health care demand, but also for future development of chronic diseases.",

Given the numerous targets that have already been identified through other studies throughout the world, care has to be taken when designing and planning yet another large-scale study. Future studies have to consider carefully whether it is most cost-effective to monitor large populations in prospective cohort studies or undertake well-designed case\u2013control studies on a particular exposure or disease [21]. It has been argued that population-based cohorts are necessary to account for methodological challenges such as standardisation and generalisation, to allow for new methodologies and to include younger age groups [27]. Others suggest that initiating new large population-based cohorts are not worth the wait and should be replaced by merging ongoing smaller cohort studies [28]. In this context, LifeGene has been designed to address a wide variety of research questions, including the possibility of detecting pre-clinical markers for disease, event-based sampling and a cohort of children born into the study.",
