Ribavirin has activity against a range of DNA and RNA viruses; in different cell lines, ED50 ranges from 1 to100 \u03bcg/mL. Antiretroviral (HIV) drugs include reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors and protease inhibitors. Selected HIV nucleoside RT inhibitors studied were zidovudine and lamivudine, while HIV protease inhibitors studied were indinavir, nelfinavir, and saquinavir. The third group of antivirals studied were the neuraminidase inhibitors, both commercially available preparations, zanamivir and oseltamivir were used in this study. Interferons were the next major class of antivirals studied. Various subtypes of interferon \u03b1 (2a, 2b, n1, and n3, human leukocyte) and \u03b2 (1a and 1b) were used. Amantadine, an old antiviral compound, was also studied. Different terms have been used to express antiviral activity, namely, EC50, 95% effective concentration (EC95), and 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50); Table 1 illustrates the range of activity against selected viruses.",

The concentration range observed is much higher than concentrations that inhibit other viruses (respiratory syncytial virus, ED50 2\u20138 \u03bcg/mL, HIV or resistant strains of rhinovirus, 50\u2013100 \u03bcg/mL), including viruses that were tested on Vero cells (West Nile virus, New York isolate 178 \u03bcg/mL, and Uganda isolate 41 \u03bcg/mL) (19). In addition, the CPE inhibitory concentrations obtained in this study were above the cytotoxic concentration range against Vero cells. The 50% cytotoxic dose (CD50) on various cell lines has been reported to be approximately 200\u20131000 \u03bcg/mL of ribavirin (17,18). We observed slight cytotoxicity by microscopic examination of the cells, making it difficult to accurately obtain in vitro efficacy data against SARS-CoV. It appears that due to the low activity of ribavirin in vitro, inhibitory doses may not be achievable clinically. It is possible that ribavirin would be more effective in combination with interferons. Combination therapy with ribavirin and interferon \u03b1 has now become standard treatment for chronic hepatitis C (20\u201322). Additionally, we have tested the effect of ribavirin and Betaferon in combination (range of concentration of ribavirin, 1\u2013100 \u03bcg/mL; range of concentration of Betaferon, 0.1\u201310 IU/mL).

Interferons have been used as anticancer and antiviral agents, in particular, for treating hepatitis B and C infections. Various groups have reported the clinical benefit of intranasally administered interferon \u03b1 in human volunteers before and after inoculation with non-SARS coronaviruses (23\u201325). The antiviral activity of interferons is mediated by direct effects on infected cells or by modulating an immune response (26). Interferons interact with specific surface cell receptors, leading to production of interferon-stimulated gene products such as 2\u20325\u2032-oligoadenylate synthase and protein kinase PKR (27).",

Common clinical dosages for interferon \u03b1 range from 3 to 5 million IU three times a week to 5 million IU daily. For interferon \u03b2, data regarding efficacy in the treatment of hepatitis C are conflicting, and interferon \u03b2 (at doses of 3 to 6 million IU three times weekly) is usually only used in the treatment of infections in patients whose condition no longer responds to other therapies. Plasma levels of interferons administered through the subcutaneous route are usually low with correspondingly short half-lives. In view of their mechanism of action, absolute serum levels may not be meaningful as a measure of the biologic activity of interferons, compared to the induction of cellular products such as 2\u20325\u2032 oligoadenylate synthase.",

We are currently identifying other in vitro models of SARS-CoV infection that will enable us to address cell-type specific drug effects. Also, interferon subtypes exhibited different activity against SARS-CoV in this study. The mechanism for the difference in activity is unknown. Among the products tested, the source of interferon and amount of glycosylation differ. Some preparations were derived from human lymphoblastoid or leukocyte cells, while others were recombinantly produced in Escherichia coli or mammalian cell culture. We do not know the importance of this observation with respect to possible antiviral mechanisms of the interferons against SARS-CoV or potential clinical implications of these differences.",
