Extended-release drugs reduce the animal's exposure to cycles of hyper- and hypo-therapeutic drug levels. They also reduce the opportunity for iatrogenic injuries associated with efforts to secure small animals for repeated drug injections. A single injection of these drugs provides the animal with two to three days of analgesic therapy, and can be given when the animal is still under post-surgical anesthesia support1,2,3,4. However, the effects of long-acting buprenorphine analgesics on the risks of nausea in rats remain uncertain.",

Safety trials for new veterinary pharmaceutical products require clinical and histopathology studies of male and female animals given up to tenfold excess doses of the drug. Our tests included trials using a single injection with increasing concentrations of buprenorphine, and three repeat injections at four-day intervals with increasing concentrations of buprenorphine. The tests included blinded behavioral observations to monitor unexpected signs of stress and pain. Because we avoided the use of hardwood bedding, nausea-induced gastric distress and pica were not expected. We did not find significant weight losses. However, we observed nausea-related behaviors consisting of excessive self-licking and gnawing in both the single and repeat dose-escalation trials.",

We monitored signs of nausea in a trial using 18 female Fischer F344/NTac rats weighing 170\u2013180 g obtained from Taconic Farms (Hudson, NY). The study used three groups of six rats: two groups of drug-treated rats and one group with the drug-free vehicle as a control to investigate the effects of the drug on nausea-related behavioral signs. Guidelines for TAS studies specify a minimum number of three animals per group. Four rats were used in TAS studies to account for potential morbidity during jugular vein phlebotomy. Because there is limited information about the side effects of nausea associated with extended-release buprenorphine, we used six rats per group in the present tests to increase the potential to observe side effects.",

Cages were changed daily for the first seven days of the study to prevent re-dosing by coprophagy. Carefresh Natural bedding (Ferndale, WA) was used to absorb liquids. The rats were provided ad libitum access to drinking water (Baltimore City Water System, Baltimore, MD) and Harlan TEKLAD Certified Global Rodent Diet 2016C (Harlan TEKLAD, Indianapolis, IN). Health surveillance was conducted by a soiled-bedding sentinel system. Rats were considered negative for pneumonia virus of mice, reovirus, Sendai virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, rat coronavirus, sialodacryoadenitis virus, rat parvovirus, Kilham rat virus, Toolan H1 parvovirus, rat theilovirus, cilia-associated respiratory bacillus, Pneumocysti carinii, Mycoplasma pulmonis and pinworms. The rats were quarantined and acclimated for six days before dosing. A clinical veterinarian approved the animals for study use and all rats appeared normal with no signs of disease. Animals were weighed before assignment to the dose groups to assure the weight of each rat was within 10% of the group average. The order of dosing started with the 1.3 mg/kg group and ended with the vehicle control group.",

The drug suspension consisting of buprenorphine, cholesterol, and glycerol tristearate, trade name Animalgesics for Mice, was supplied by Animalgesics Labs (Millersville, MD). Procedures were done in a ventilated hood in the animal room containing the rat cages. Because of its ease of use and history of safety in our laboratories, we anesthetized rats with 0.65 mL of an intraperitoneal (IP) solution containing 25 mg/mL ketamine hydrochloride, 2.5 mg/mL xylazine, and 14.25% ethyl alcohol in saline. At approximately 7:00 a.m. we then injected the rats once subcutaneously with the designated dose of test article or buprenorphine-free control suspension in the mid-dorsal area using a 22 G needle attached to a 1 mL syringe. Rats were anesthetized and dosed in approximately 45 min. Following dose administration, we transferred the rats to a recovery cage on a heating pad until recovered. Once the animal regained consciousness, demonstrated normal movement and the absence of signs of distress, we returned it to its home cage. The tail of each animal was marked with a sharpie pen to denote the animal number in the group.",
