It has been estimated that 2.5 million cases of pneumonia occur annually in Europe [2]. The most recent incidence figures from the developed world come from an Australian study carried out in 2003 [3]. A diagnosis of pneumonia was reported in 6.8% of children. The estimated incidence of pneumonia in the study sample was 7.6/1000 person-years. Radiological confirmation was reported in 85% and hospitalisation in 41%. The estimated incidence of pneumonia requiring hospitalisation was 3.1/1000 person-years. This study is difficult to compare with other incidence studies as it used as parental recall and a denominator of person-years. If the incidence is calculated using persons rather than person-years, the rate of pneumonia in the < 5 year age group would be 21/1000/year. European figures taken from a study conducted in Finland found a higher incidence, 36/1000/year for children < 5 years of age and 16.2/1000/year for children > 5 years (hospital and community combined). However, the number of cases requiring hospitalisation is very similar (41% in the Australian study and 42% in the Finnish study [4]).",

A total of 13 deaths from invasive pneumococcal disease were reported to the ONS in 1999, 3 of which were due to pneumonia. In addition, a further 77 deaths due to pneumonia were reported due to unspecified septicaemia. An underlying condition, such as cerebral palsy or prematurity, was present in 34/77 (44%).

Interstitial changes are thought to be more associated with viral infections; however, 50% of children in this group had evidence of a viral infection, whereas the other 50% had bacterial infection. Many children had a mixed picture of radiological changes. These findings were confirmed in a systematic review by Swingler [16], who concluded that it was not possible to differentiate between viral and bacterial pneumonia radiologically.

One study found a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 88% [21]. However, other researchers have found a lower sensitivity of 50% for procalcitonin in the detection of bacterial pneumonia [22]. Immunofluorescence of respiratory secretions are highly specific and can be performed against a number of respiratory viruses. This can allow near patient testing and early treatment with specific antiviral agents such as the neuraminidase inhibitors against influenza. Blood culture is another commonly performed investigation on children with CAP, but the yield is extremely low (< 5%) [17,23,24] and the results are not available in the acute setting to influence antibiotic prescribing.",

A study from Ethiopia has shown that nutritional rickets increases the risk of pneumonia 13-fold, even after correcting for malnutrition and other confounding factors [34]. Prevention of rickets by exposure to sunlight or vitamin D supplementation is important in this setting, but vitamin D supplements do not have a role in the treatment of pneumonia in the absence of rickets. Seroprevalence of HIV is higher in children admitted to hospital with pneumonia in the developing world [35]. Children with HIV may develop pneumonia with opportunistic pathogens, such as Pneumocystis jiroveci, where treatment with high dose co-trimoxazole is indicated. However, pneumonia in these children is not confined to opportunists. When HIV-positive children, who do not have access to highly active anti-retroviral treatment, present with pneumonia, simple antibiotics are effective in the majority of cases [36]. In the developed world, children may be at greater risk of pneumonia because of immune deficiency, immunosuppression, impaired mucociliary clearance (such as in cystic fibrosis or primary ciliary dyskinesia) or neuromuscular disease.",

This area was the subject of a recent Cochrane review, which sought to identify effective antibiotic drug therapies for CAP in children by comparing various antibiotics [37].

The WHO presently recommends treatment of non-severe pneumonia with co-trimoxazole in countries with an infant mortality > 40/1000 live births [6].

Only 24% of children were treated with benzyl penicillin. The prospective arm of the study instigated a new management protocol that promoted the use of benzyl penicillin, followed by the addition of a macrolide at 48 h for those not responding. A total of 89 children were included in the prospective audit and 61/89 (69%) were treated with benzyl penicillin (there were reasons for giving broader spectrum antibiotics, such as immunodeficiency, in 10 children).

There is some evidence to suggest that antibiotic prescribing can be rationalised in areas with a low incidence of resistant S. pneumoniae to first-line penicillin without increased treatment failures [17].

The study from the developed world comparing oral amoxicillin and intravenous benzyl penicillin discussed above showed a median time for temperature to settle of 1.3 days in both groups [52]. It will be difficult in further studies to show an improvement in time for temperature to settle without recruiting large numbers of children; however, this remains one of the most objective outcome measures available.
