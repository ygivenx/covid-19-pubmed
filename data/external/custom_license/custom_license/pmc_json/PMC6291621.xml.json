            "text": "Recombinant viruses expressing reporter genes such as luciferase or fluorescent proteins or viral proteins fused with a reporter protein have been used as screening tools for countermeasures and to understand pathogenesis (1\u20134). While the application of reporter gene technology has provided insight into viral pathogenesis, these experiments are frequently hampered by sacrificing the subject to identify the source of the reporter gene signal (5\u20137). Applying medical imaging technology, such as single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET), to animal models of human infectious disease provides the capability to serially monitor anatomical and physiological responses to infection in the same subject that can be clinically translated. Generating a virus that carries a SPECT/PET-compatible reporter gene furthers that capability by serial, real-time evaluation of virus kinetics, identification of tissue tropism, and determination of pathogenic mechanisms. The human sodium iodide symporter (hNIS) gene has emerged as one of the most promising reporter genes in preclinical and translational research for oncology and gene therapy (8, 9).",

The advantages of hNIS as an imaging reporter gene include its relatively small size (\u223c2 kb), wide availability of substrates, such as radioiodines, tetrafluoroborate, and 99mTc-pertechnetate, and well-understood metabolism and clearance mechanisms of these substrates (11). Oncolytic viruses such as measles virus and replication-deficient adenovirus that contain hNIS have demonstrated value as theranostics, as hNIS is used both as a therapeutic platform and to track the therapeutic effect (8, 9). In addition, hNIS is unlikely to perturb the underlying cell biochemistry, and no negative effects of resultant sodium influx have been observed (12). Finally, once incorporated into the viral genome, the relatively small size of the reporter gene is less likely than larger reporter genes to alter viral pathogenic properties (13).",

As with most lethal infectious diseases, animal models are the cornerstone for preclinical countermeasure evaluation and understanding pathogenesis.

Transgenic mice globally expressing the human CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) receptor (22), expressing the human receptor under the murine promoter (23) or transduced with DPP4 receptor (24) become permissive to the virus but do not develop fulminant, lethal respiratory disease.

At a concentration of 0.1 mM, sodium perchlorate blocked 99.5% of the cellular uptake of 99mTc-pertechnetate in rMERS-CoV/hNIS-infected cells at an MOI of 0.01. Sodium perchlorate concentrations below 0.1 mM reduced the inhibitory effect.

The effective inhibition of 99mTc-pertechnetate uptake with 0.1 mM sodium perchlorate declined between 48 and 96 h postinfection (Fig. 5b), suggesting that viral transcription can overcome the inhibitory effect.

Our data demonstrate the feasibility of using hNIS as a reporter protein in animal models of human disease, provided a higher-resolution SPECT/CT or PET/CT is available. Despite the presence of a robust signal, the clinical grade SPECT/CT in our facility did not provide the necessary resolution to demonstrate in vivo functionality of the rMERS-CoV/hNIS in mice. If available, a micro-PET/CT and the use of tetrafluorborate, an alternate hNIS ligand, could be used to increase sensitivity and improve signal to noise (26). The recombinant MERS-CoV/hNIS has similar fitness to the parental virus, rMERS-CoV, as evidenced by similar kinetics, fitness, and cytopathic effect in vitro. The results of in vivo evaluation also support similar fitness; however, further development would require insertion of the hNIS transgene into other locations within the virus and insertion of the transgene into the MERS-15 virus, which can cause lethal respiratory disease in the 288/300++ mice.",

Two mice, one from group 1 and one from group 4, did not recover from anesthesia after a preexposure scan and were not replaced. Mice were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane and were exposed intranasally with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) without virus (group 1) or with rMERS-CoV (groups 2 and 4) or rMERS-CoV/hNIS (groups 3 and 5). The virus/PBS was instilled into both nostrils, 25 \u00b5l per nostril. The mice were monitored daily for clinical signs of disease. The animals from groups 2 and 3 were euthanized on day 3 postexposure (pe), and the animals from groups 1, 4, and 5 were euthanized on day 7 pe. The lungs were collected for gross pathological and microscopic evaluation and virus detection via plaque assay.",
