One of eight physicians who attended her became infected, as did 9 of approximately 30 nursing staff. SARS also developed in 1 of 12 patients in adjacent beds during her hospitalization and 9 of approximately 30 family members and friends who visited her during this time. Nineteen of these 20 patients were admitted to our hospital for treatment and isolation (1 was treated outside Singapore), and we recorded prospectively the clinical features of their illnesses with a standardized data collection form. In addition to demographic data, this form elicited information on occupation, date(s) of exposure to suspected cases, travel history after February 20, dates of onset of various symptoms, results of blood tests, and chest radiographic findings.",

Physical signs on chest examination are minimal, and chest radiograph may be normal on week 1 of illness. Laboratory tests often show lymphopenia, mild thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes. Therefore, in early stages, SARS may be hard to differentiate from other viral infections, and diagnostic delays may contribute to the spread of the epidemic. Early diagnosis relies on known history of potential exposure to SARS. Clinicians must maintain a high index of suspicion and be familiar with the rapidly changing epidemiology of this infection. Early diagnosis minimizes transmission.",

To this end, we are collecting serum from healthcare staff exposed to SARS patients.",

These cases were probably secondary rather than tertiary because the dates of symptom onset were very close and little interaction occurred between contacts. Patient 20 had a relatively late onset, but she was discharged from our hospital by March 6 and had no subsequent contact with other case-patients. Clearly, this infection is highly transmissible from person to person, and healthcare workers are particularly at risk (3\u20135). The precise routes of transmission in a healthcare setting need to be defined, although the predominance of right lower lobe findings on chest radiography suggests that droplet or airborne transmission is involved. However, were airborne transmission involved, we would have seen a much greater number of cases with weaker contact links to the index patient. We did not see any further transmission from this index patient after we implemented strict infection control measures involving use of N95 masks, gown, gloves, and handwashing before and after patient contact. Which components of this approach are responsible for the decrease in transmission is unclear.",
