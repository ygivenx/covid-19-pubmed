In addition, the viral genome also encodes several\nnonstructural proteins including RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp),\ncoronavirus main protease (3CLpro), and papain-like protease (PLpro).12,13 Upon entrance to the host cells, the viral genome is released as\na single-stranded positive RNA. Subsequently, it is translated into\nviral polyproteins using host cell protein translation machinery,\nwhich are then cleaved into effector proteins by viral proteinases\n3CLpro and PLpro.12,13 PLpro also behaves as a deubiquitinase\nthat may deubiquinate certain host cell proteins, including interferon\nfactor 3 and NF-\u03baB, resulting in immune suppression.13,14 RdRp synthesizes a full-length negative-strand RNA template to be\nused by RdRp to make more viral genomic RNA.",

In late February\n2020, GSK announced a collaboration with Chinese firm Clover Biopharmaceuticals\nto assess a coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine candidate.52 This collaboration will involve the use of Clover\u2019s\nprotein-based coronavirus vaccine candidate (COVID-19 S-Trimer) with\nGSK\u2019s adjuvant system. By applying their Trimer-Tag technology,\nClover has manufactured an S-Trimer subunit vaccine using a rapid\nmammalian cell culture-based expression system. The Trimer-Tag is\nan advanced drug development platform, which enables the production\nof novel, covalently trimerized fusion proteins that can better target\nprevious undruggable pathways.",
