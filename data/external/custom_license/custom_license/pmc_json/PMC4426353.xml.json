            "text": "There has been significant recent interest in\nthe use of convalescent antibody therapy or mAbs as postexposure treatments.\nA large number of antibodies for EBOV have been described.47,48 Here we focus on a handful to illustrate key points. From a systemic\nperspective, antibody therapies likely work by preventing viral entry\n(\u201cneutralization\u201d) and/or activation of host complement,\nantibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), or other functions\nrelated to the antibody Fc region. The extent to which these independent\nmechanisms contribute is not completely clear, but most antibody cocktails\nthat have been demonstrated to be effective in small or large animals\ncontain at least one mAb with neutralizing activity in vitro. Key\ncomponents of two first-generation antibody cocktails, namely, MB-003\n(MappBio) and ZMab (Defyrus), were recently combined to yield ZMapp,\nwhich demonstrates increased efficacy. ZMapp is a cocktail of three\nmouse-derived mAbs against EBOV GP that were chimerized into human\nIgG scaffolds (c13C6, c2G4, and c4G7).49\u221251 This cocktail was provided\nfor compassionate use in several human cases this year and has been\ndemonstrated to reverse the course of EVD 5 days post viral challenge\nin NHPs.49 Each of the ZMapp mAbs alone\nis capable of affording partial protection in guinea pigs; two of\nthese mAbs, c2G4 and c4G7, have neutralizing activity in vitro, whereas\nthe third (c13C6) requires complement pathway components.49,52,53 Moreover, recent structural analysis\nhas shown that none of the mutations observed in the currently circulating\nWest Africa EBOV strains occurred within the epitopes of the ZMapp\nantibodies.54,55 In NHPs, convalescent antibody\n(derived from distinct GP-vaccinated animals) provides postexposure\nprotection for both EBOV and MARV, up to 48 h postchallenge, and these\nsera also neutralize in vitro.56 Among\nthe most potent neutralizing antibodies described to date are SUDV-specific\nmAbs 16F6 (murine) and similar synthetic human mAbs, which can neutralize\ninfection by nearly two logs at midnanomolar concentrations.6,57 Two of the synthetic human antibodies (E10 and F4) as well as 16F6\ncan provide postexposure protection >80% in an immunocompromised\nmouse model.57 However, protection of NHPs\nby any antibody therapy has yet to be demonstrated for SUDV. Postexposure\nprotection of NHPs against any filovirus by a single mAb (as opposed\nto polyclonal IgG in convalescent antibody therapies or cocktails\nof mAbs) also has not been shown. An early study indicated that one\nEBOV-specific mAb, KZ52, did not afford protection from challenge,\nbut it is unknown if altered or increased dosing would have made a\ndifference.48,58",

These X-ray structures in combination with\nthe structural information on c4G7 and c2G4 suggest that the GP1\u2013GP2\ninterface of the prefusion spike is particularly susceptible for neutralization.5,7 Thus, a potential strategy for isolating additional neutralizing\nantibodies, or non-antibody protein therapeutics, would be to target\nspecifically this region on GP.",

There are likely other regions\nin GP that contain neutralizing epitopes that could be mined to some\nextent by na\u00efve library phage panning or mouse immunizations.\nFurthermore, GP from EBOV is known to undergo some subtle conformational\nchanges upon exposure to low pH or mild denaturants.62,63 It is possible that cryptic epitopes exist and are accessible on\nthe prefusion structure that can be targeted using a variety of approaches.60 Antibodies against the glycan cap and mucin-like\ndomains (e.g., 13F6 and 14G7) provide in vivo protection, but usually\nappear non-neutralizing in vitro, possibly due to the removal of their\nepitopes through cathepsin cleavage in the late endosome.50,53,55,64",

A potential mechanism for KZ52 is to act\nas a \u201cstaple\u201d, locking the two subunits together in\nthe prefusion form, because its structural epitope spans both subunits.7 However, this mechanism would posit that KZ52\nmust remain bound to GP throughout maturation of the endosome, presumably\nto the lysosome where the viral particle is degraded before it has\na chance to infect. A similar mechanism can be proposed for 16F6 and,\nby extension, E10 and F4, but the 16F6 structural epitope is contained\nmostly on GP1; thus it is less clear how 16F6 binding can occlude\nGP2 conformational rearrangements as efficiently as KZ52.5 A structural and mechanistic dissection of these\npotential neutralization mechanisms may lend itself to the design\nof new, more potent antibodies or protein therapeutics. Moreover,\nefficient antibody-mediated protection likely requires a mixture of\nantibodies that recognize both the GP1\u2013GP2 interface and the\nouter regions of the GP. In regard to this, KZ52, which failed to\nprovide protection as a single mAb in NHP studies,58 might be effective in an adequate antibody cocktail.",

One study demonstrated that the potency\nof C-peptide inhibitors can be substantially enhanced by conjugation\nto the HIV-1 Tat arginine-rich sequence (referred to as Tat-Ebo).72 The antiviral activity of these endosome-targeting\npeptides is dependent on both the Tat sequence and the native EBOV\nCHR sequence. Mechanistic studies suggested that the peptide acts\nby blocking a membrane fusion intermediate, although this was not\nunequivocally demonstrated, but defects were evident in late-stage\nentry steps. However, the concentrations of peptide required for substantial\nreduction in viral infection are likely too high for the C-peptide\nto be of clinical relevance. Subsequent efforts focused on the generation\nand characterization of C-peptides conjugated to cholesterol and Tat-Ebo\nanalogues containing covalent side chain\u2013side chain cross-links\nto promote \u03b1-helical conformation.73 Although the mechanism of inhibition appears to be unspecific (the\npeptides also showed activity against the vesicular stomatitis virus\nglycoprotein G), the cholesterol-conjugated C-peptides were potent\ninhibitors of EBOV glycoprotein-mediated cell entry. Interestingly,\nit was found that cholesterol conjugation enhances \u03b1-helical\nstructure in a concentration-independent manner. These results highlight\nthat caution must be exercised in considering cholesterol conjugated\nC-peptides as a general therapeutic approach to improve the antiviral\nactivity of C-peptide analogues of class I fusion proteins. In the\nspecific case of EBOV, conjugation to cholesterol enhanced potency\nbut at the cost of specificity. Moreover, side chain\u2013side chain\ncross-linking enhanced \u03b1-helical stability of the Tat-Ebo variants\nonly at neutral pH. However, one side chain\u2013side chain cross-linked\npeptide with moderately higher activity than the parent compound Tat-Ebo\nwas identified. Recently, a mirror image phage display strategy was\nutilized to develop reverse chirality peptides (d-peptides)\nthat bind to mimics of the EBOV extended intermediate.74",
