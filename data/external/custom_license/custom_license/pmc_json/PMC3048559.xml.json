            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) emerged as a communicable human disease in November 2002 and rapidly spread throughout the world [1]. A coronavirus, called SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), was identified as the causative agent [2,3]. SARS-CoV is a plus-strand RNA virus featuring a large single-stranded RNA genome of approximately 29.7 kb [4] that contains 16 non-structural proteins (nsps) with multiple enzymatic functions. These are known or are predicted to include types of enzymes that are common components of the replication machinery of plus-strand RNA viruses [5,6]. In these nsps, the Nsp5 [main protease (Mpro) or 3C-like protease (3CLpro)] is responsible for the proteolytic processing of viral polypeptides into functional proteins and 3CLpro mutant, C145A, blocks the maturation process [7]. This viral protease has been the target for design of the inhibitors [7-11]. Recently, SARS-3CLpro was found to induce cell apotosis and interact with cellular vacuolar-H+ ATPase [12,13]. Several human proteins might possess a similar structure of SARS-3CLpro cleavage sites using computational methods [14]. Theses studies implied the SARS-3CLpro could involve in virus-induced host pathology.",

SARS-CoV reproduces rapidly and causes massive cell damage. At the whole-body level, immune-mediated damage, due to activation of cytokines and/or chemokines [18-22] and, perhaps, autoimmunity [23,24], may play key roles in the clinical and pathological features of SARS. One of the major causes of host death is the induction of lung fibrosis. The mechanism of the lung fibrosis caused by SARS-CoV requires elucidation. Significant efforts have been made to analyze the function of SARS-3CLpro on viral replication, but the impact of SARS-3CLpro on cytokines of the host cell is still unclear. In this study, we constructed the pEGFP-C3 vector with SARS-3CLpro gene and transfected it into A549 lung epithelial cells. The expression profiles of cytokines were validated by RT-PCR and ELISA. The results indicated that the expression and secretion of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) decrease in SARS-3CLpro transfected A549 cells. Furthermore, NF-kB, putative regulators of GM-CSF gene expression, was also decreased on its protein level in 3CLpro transfected cells.",

An inactive 3CLpro mutant, C145A (TGT\u2192GCT), was also included in this study as a negative control [7]. Furthermore, the myc tag sequence was also introduced into the 3' end of the 3CLpro and C145A genes for immunofluorescence analysis. The DNA fragments of CMV promoter, 3CLpro wild type, and C145A 3CLpro mutant were amplified by PCR using primers containing restriction enzyme sites as shown in Figure 1A. The expression constructs were further verified by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis after restriction enzymes digestion (Figure 1B). As expected, the 597 bp of PCMV and 956 bp of 3CLpro (and C145A) fragments were excised from plasmids with appropriate restriction enzymes and were confirmed by DNA sequencing.",

The results indicated that the expression of 3CLpro and C145A mRNA reached the highest level in A549 cells at 12 to 24 hrs and slightly decreased their expression at 48 h after transfection. However, 2D western blots results indicated that the protein expression levels of 3CLpro and C145A steadily increased with time up to 48 hrs after transfection. To track the locations of 3CLpro and C145A proteins in transfected A549 cells, Myc-tagged 3CLpro and C145A were detected using rhodamine-conjugated anti-Myc antibodies. The immunofluorescence microscopic images demonstrated 60-70% transfection efficiency (data not shown) and the localizations of c-myc tagged 3CLpro and C145A were detected both in the cytoplasm and nucleus of transfected A549 cells compared to control EGFP (Figure 3).",

It is important to elucidate the mechanism of the lung fibrosis caused by SARS-CoV.

The localization patterns of 3CLpro and C145A were observed both in the cytoplasm and nucleus of A549 cells by immunofluorescence (Figure 3). Decreased expression and levels of GM-CSF were found in 3CLpro-transfected cells using RT-PCR, but not in C145A transfected cells (Figure 2A). Down-regulation of GM-CSF expression by 3CLpro in A549 cells may be attributed in part to the reduced protein level of NF-kB (Figure 6).

Apart from its physiological role in the control of alveolar macrophage development, it now appears more likely that its major role lies in its ability to govern the properties of the more mature myeloid cells of the granulocyte and macrophage lineages, particularly during host defense and inflammatory reactions. Recent evidence for the key role of GM-CSF in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases is summarized [29]. GM-CSF-deficient mice showed an increased susceptibility to pulmonary infections [30,31]. In addition, some studies also demonstrated that impaired production of GM-CSF played a role in the development of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis [32,33]. Together, there is growing evidence suggesting that GM-CSF is an important regulator of the alveolar epithelium, surfactant homeostasis, and lung host defense [31,34]. To support the above, our experimental results show decreased expression and secretion of GM-CSF in 3CLpro-transfected cells, and suggest that SARS-3CLpro will affect host defense.",

In this study, 3CLpro transfected A549 cells decreased the protein levels of NF-kB with subsequent decline in GM-CSF mRNA and protein expression (Figures 4-6). The amino acid sequence analyses of NF-kB indicated that non-canonical 3CLpro cleavage sites (such as P1'-Tyr/Gln/Arg/Ile P1-Gln P2-Leu) commonly existed in NF-kB.

This method is an accurate and valid system to detect multiple gene expression by amplifying all the genes under the same conditions. The PCR derived DNA fragments, obtained by 25 PCR cycles, and was subjected to electrophoresis in a 1.7% agarose gel. The cDNAs encoding human granulocyte-macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and GAPDH were amplified by RT-PCR using the following primer pairs: 5'-TGAGTAGAGACACTGCTGCTG-3' (forward primer for GM-CSF cDNAs), 5'-TCAAAGGGGATGACAAGCAGAA-3' (reverse primer for GM-CSF cDNAs), 5'-CATGTTCGTCATGGGTGTGA-3' (forward primer for GAPDH cDNAs), and 5'-AGTGAGCTTCCCGTTCAGCTC-3' (reverse primer for GAPDH cDNAs). The amplification was performed in a 50 \u03bcl reaction volume containing 1\u00d7 reaction buffer (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, USA), 1.5 \u03bcM of MgCl2, 200 \u03bcM of dNTPs, 1 \u03bcM of each primer and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, USA) using a Perkin-Elmer Gene Amp PCR system 2400. Each cycle consists of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 1 min, annealing at 55\u00b0C for 45 sec, and amplification at 72\u00b0C for 45 sec. The RT-PCR derived DNA fragments obtained by 30 PCR cycles were subjected to electrophoresis on a 1.7% agarose gel. Following staining with ethidium bromide, the gels were photographed and band intensity was measured under UV light using the Alphaimager 2200 (Alphalnnotech, San Leandro, CA, USA). The specific RNA level of every sample was expressed as the product's intensity. cDNA encoding glyceraldehyde- 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was quantified and used to normalize the expression of GA-CSF and each cytokine for each sample.",
