It was first recognized as a canine pathogen in the late 1970s [1]. So far, three genetic variants, i.e., CPV-2a, -2b and -2c, have been identified [2]. CPV-2 is a highly contagious pathogen of domestic dogs and other members of the family Canidae [3]. Animals infected with CPV-2 develop acute gastroenteritis characterized by loss of appetite, vomiting, fever, diarrhea (from mucoid to haemorrhagic) and leucopenia with high morbidity and mortality [2, 4]. CPV-2 is shed in the feces of infected animals and spreads through the fecal-oral route [5].",

            "text": "Early and rapid diagnosis is crucial for the prevention of CPV-2 spread and disease management. A number of gene-amplification-based assays have been developed for CPV-2 diagnosis, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), nested PCR, real-time PCR, loop-mediated isothermal amplification, and insulated isothermal PCR (iiPCR) [6\u201310]. Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), a novel isothermal gene amplification technique, employs three core enzymes: a recombinase, a single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB), and a strand-displacing polymerase [11\u201313]. The reaction initiates with the recombinase binding to the primer to form filaments (protein-DNA complex) that are capable of pairing the primer with a homologous sequence in the target DNA. After filaments recombine with homologous DNA, the other strand of target DNA is displaced, where SSB binds to prevent the dissociation of the primer. Finally, the strand-displacing polymerase adds bases to the 3\u2019 end of the primer and primer extension occurs. When opposing primers are used, exponential amplification typically runs to completion in about 30 minutes. RPA has been explored for the molecular detection of diverse pathogens, e.g., bacteria, fungi, parasites and viruses [12\u201317], as it possesses superiority in speed, portability and accessibility [17]. In this study, a novel RPA-based method was developed for the detection of CPV-2.",

As shown in Figure 1, an RPA product with the expected size (~210 bp) was clearly visible after agarose gel electrophoresis and staining when the reaction done for as short a time as 10 minutes. Semi-quantification by measuring the DNA band density revealed that the DNA yield doubled when the reaction was done for 20 minutes (data not shown), but no significant difference was observed in the product yields of 20-min, 30-min and 40-min reactions (data not shown), which probably indicates that after 20 min of reaction, dNTPs or other components in the reaction system were completely consumed.

We were unable to obtain CPV-2c, which was thus not tested in this study. Nevertheless, the RPA primers were 100 % identical to the target sequences in CPV-2c genomic DNA, as shown by sequence alignment. RPA did not amplify the template of other important dog viruses, demonstrating high specificity. The validation experiment revealed that RPA had an excellent diagnostic agreement rate with PCR, which is indicative of the clinical applicability of RPA. It is known that low-temperature amplification usually creates a high background signal; hence, nonspecific bands generated from RPA are not uncommon [17]. However, we also observed that nonspecifically amplified bands can be easily differentiated by size difference and signal intensity (Figures 1, 2, 3).",

An outstanding advantage for RPA is that it is performed in a water bath, making RPA a potential alternative for CPV-2 detection in resource-limited settings.\n",
