Up to February 8, ~ 50 patients and 30 medical staff in WMHC were diagnosed with NCP, so WMHC became the first psychiatric hospital in China with clustered nosocomial infections. The official spokesman of WMHC revealed to the media that delay of information on infections increased the chance of infection in the early stage, such as unawareness of the infection and the mode of transmission, as well as the possibility of an asymptomatic incubation period, similar to the situation of other general hospitals in Wuhan.",

This phenomenon still occurs in the closed psychotic hospitals in China, with the most common reason being the tradition of reunion at Chinese New Year. Besides, experts have noted that if infected, the elderly and those with underlying diseases are more likely to develop severe pulmonary disease. Long-term hospitalized patients with mental disorders with comorbidity such as hypertension, diabetes, and other chronic diseases are more vulnerable than the general population [5].

The intensive use of ward beds will increase the inconvenience of emergency deployment, the potential rate of cross infections, and the error rates due to fatigue of medical staff under high pressure.

Once exogenous infection occurs, transmission can be rapid and extremely hard to control. Therefore, the complete isolation of mental health centers has been recommended during the NCP epidemic. Specific measures to be considered are as follows:Fourteen days under observation in hospital is the key to reducing hospital infection;A pre-admission observation ward needs to be arranged immediately;A detailed understanding of the patient\u2019s recent travel history in Hubei province, as well as the close contact history with suspected or confirmed patients;Based on the risk level of a latent infectious patient, the physician should make a firm decision on whether the patient should be transferred to the designated hospital for treatment set by the local government;Medical, nursing, logistics support, and canteen staff should limit their approaches to the hospital and have their temperature taken before entering and leaving the ward;Temporarily prohibit on-site visits, and replace them with video chat. In principle, only food and clothing from government-approved institutions are acceptable;More psychological services should be provided by community workers and family doctors to help the hospital to communicate about the restriction of visitors, so as to obtain consent on the necessity of these temporary arrangements;Ensure that family members know that the patients receive sufficient daily necessities from the hospital, so as to eliminate the worries and doubts of family members;The skills of medical staff in the psychiatric specialty needs to be improved in identifying and treating physical diseases.",

At present, it has been reported that many local hospital workers in Wuhan, especially nurses, have been confronting occupational exhaustion. Inevitably, the overloaded working conditions lead to mental health problems such as serious psychosomatic disorders and a decline in decision making and execution [9]. Psychological services and crisis interventions are needed at an early stage to reduce anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in almost all groups during such a stressful period. However, we should note that the premise of providing such services is to follow the advice in this paper, to isolate infected patients and cut off the transmission route to protect vulnerable people. Once a psychological consultation room is set up in a general hospital, the manager should pay attention to the redesign of the layout, formulate strict measures to prevent infection, and increase the protective equipment at work to ensure that consultations are conducted in a safe environment. Online psychotherapy is recommended. Where there is no sufficient preventative facility for the epidemic, psychiatrists and counselors are currently suggested to do more work over the phone, and via internet applications such as WeChat.",
