Nevertheless, we observed no significant differences between HAdV-55 cases and non\u2013HAdV-55 cases in terms of the frequency of clinical diagnosis of pneumonia, hospitalization, and ARDS. These findings could be explained by 2 assumptions. First, specific HAdV types such as HAdV-3, HAdV-7, or HAdV-14 might be more virulent than other types (25,27,28). Considering that the HAdV-55 genome is more similar to the HAdV-14 genome than the HAdV-11 genome, HAdV-55 infection could be associated with severe respiratory infection in certain patients (17). Second, the lower levels of herd immunity against HAdV-55 could have an influence on the epidemic of HAdV-55\u2013associated respiratory infection in soldiers in South Korea (29,30). Severe respiratory illness and outbreaks associated with HAdV-55 in soldiers in South Korea might be similar to those observed in military personnel in China (13,14,21,22).",

More than half of the South Korean soldiers with HAdV infection were on active duty. These findings contrast with previous data in which HAdV-associated respiratory infection has been common among new recruits (7). The patients included in this study might have had clinically severe illness rather than mild illness because our institute is the only central referral hospital in the military system in South Korea. Moreover, HAdV easily spreads to advanced training sites or military barracks and it can spread in geographically dispersed military barracks by the movement of soldiers because of prolonged viral shedding (31). In this study, some of the patients with HAdV-55 infection who were active duty soldiers were identified in the clusters of patients in 4 military barracks (data not shown). Although the outbreak of HAdV-55 infection was not directly confirmed in this study, outbreaks of HAdV-55\u2013associated respiratory infection might be occurring among active duty soldiers.",

Although the data might be insufficient to reflect the epidemiology of respiratory HAdV infection among military personnel in South Korea, the variation of HAdV type over time and the impact of the emergence of HAdV-55 on clinical severity can be observed. Considering the long-term experience of the US military with respiratory HAdV infection, the distribution of HAdV types might show a substantial difference in the military and community populations in South Korea. Thus, a surveillance system must be established to detect the circulation of the HAdV type among military personnel. Second, the study population included patients who needed hospitalization or an emergency department visit. Among soldiers in South Korea with HAdV infection, patients who had severe clinical signs and symptoms might be those who were primarily enrolled in this study. Nevertheless, our results suggest that of the several HAdV types, HAdV-55 and HAdV-4 might be implicated in HAdV respiratory infections among soldiers in South Korea. Furthermore, active duty soldiers and new recruits could have a substantial disease burden caused by respiratory HAdV infection. Third, we could not determine HAdV types in 11 cases. The viral titer in the clinical specimen might have been low and the viral DNA degraded because some respiratory specimens were not frozen until the molecular experiment. Using the 2-step hemi-nested PCR, we did not observe a DNA band in 11 samples.",
