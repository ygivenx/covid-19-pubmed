            "text": "Mammalian reoviruses (MRVs) are prototype members of the family Reoviridae, which contains segmented double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) viruses of both medical (rotavirus) and economic (bluetongue virus) importance (reviewed in [1\u20133]). They contain a genome of ten dsRNA segments encoding eight structural proteins and three nonstructural proteins [4]. Three large (L1\u2013L3), three medium (M1\u2013M3), and four small (S1\u2013S4) segments can be distinguished in polyacrylamide gels [5]. MRV isolates (or \u201cstrains\u201d) can be grouped into three serotypes, represented by three commonly studied prototype isolates: type 1 Lang (T1L), type 2 Jones (T2J), and type 3 Dearing (T3D). The genome sequences of three prototype MRV strains have been reported [6\u20138]. The lengths of six of the ten genome segments (L1, L3, M2, S2, S3, and S4) are invariant among the three prototype isolates. The lengths of three other segments (L2, M1, and M3) vary by only one to four bases, but the S1 genome segment is unique to each MRV strain and shows the greatest difference [9]. The S1 segment encodes the cell attachment protein \u03c31 which also specifies tissue tropism, serotype, and hemagglutination, and the nonstructural protein \u03c31s, while each of the other nine segments encodes one protein [10, 11].",

Reoviruses were originally called respiratory enteric orphans on the basis of their repeated isolation from respiratory and enteric tracts of children with asymptomatic illness [12]. However, there have been several reports describing MRVs associated with meningitis in infants and children [13\u201315], and acute respiratory disease in adults [16]. We previously reported isolation and partial characterization of a new MRV strain, designated BYD1, isolated from throat swabs of one patient of Beijing with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Hep-2 cell cultures, and SARS-Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was also isolated from the same samples in Vero-E6 cell cultures [17]. In our previous study, three other MRV strains, designated BLD, JP, and BYL, were isolated from different SARS patients [18]. All the four MRV strains were purified by plaque assay and were identified as MRV serotype 2 members by virus neutralization. Preliminary experimental infections showed MRV BYD1 could cause SARS-like symptoms in macaques and guinea pigs [19, 20].",

For this study we examined the positions and types of nucleotide mismatches between BYD1 and the prototype strains to gain a comprehensive view of the evolutionary divergence of the protein-coding sequences. Most mismatches in any of the codon base positions between BYD1 and T2J segments are far greater than those between BYD1 and either T1L or T3D segments. Each of these mismatch percentages was converted to an evolutionary divergence value by multiplying mismatch percentage by 1.33 (Table 2). These values suggest that the L3, L1, M1, and M2 segments of BYD1 diverged from ancestors of homologous T1L and T3D segments most recently, while the S2, M3, L2, S3, and S4 segments of BYD1 diverged from longer ago. The consistently high values for divergence at third codon base positions among pairings with T2J genome segments (Table 2) indicate that the nine BYD1 segments diverged from ancestors substantially before their respective T2J homologs. Relative numbers of synonymous and nonsynonymous nucleotide changes identified in pairwise comparisons of the coding sequences of BYD1 and any of the prototype strains (Table 2) support the same conclusion.\n",

In this regard, it is worth noting that the four novel MRV isolates used in this study were successively isolated from clinical samples of unambiguous SARS patients. It should be noted that all the four isolates were found to be mixed with poliovirus type 1 (vaccine strain) in our follow-up studies (data not shown). In a follow-up study, poliovirus type 1 RNAs were detected positive in four of eight fecal specimens from persons who had recovered from SARS for 2 years and two back mutations occurred in their primary attenuating mutation sites at nucleotide position 480 (G \u2192 A) in the 5\u2032 UTR and nucleotide position 2795 (A \u2192 G) in the VP1 gene, while MRV and SARS-CoV RNAs were detected negative in all the specimens [32].

According the results the BYD1 is a novel human MRV isolate and also a reassortant virus, all the six strains are novel type 2 MRVs based on their S1 sequences, and the S1 genes of the four new isolates, which only share about 65% identity with those of 302I and 302II, diverged from a common ancestor most recently. Further serological surveillance in SARS patients will allow a better understanding of the epidemiology of the novel MRVs.",
