These trends have fundamentally altered occupational exposures for the food animal workforce, by increasing and intensifying specific occupational exposures that impart health risks [11]. For workers, the intensity of animal exposures has increased, as industrial farms can hold tens of thousands of animals on site. The dramatic increase in the number of animals housed together in confinement contributes to intensified worker exposure to animals and animal products, including allergens and fecal materials [12, 13].",

A total of 726 distinct manuscripts were identified upon initial search. Following review by two researchers (C.D., J.H.L.), these papers were reduced to 37 manuscripts of relevance to the current topic. These papers included three review manuscripts and 34 original research studies. We included the reviews in our analysis because they provide important insight and expert consensus as to the direction of important fields (biosecurity for live bird market workers; respiratory exposures and disease among food animal workers; and effectiveness of health and safety trainings and interventions for Latino animal workers). The 37 manuscripts were organized in an Excel spreadsheet and read by two researchers. A narrative synthesis approach was used to extract central themes, findings, and conclusions. Based on our a priori knowledge of the field and an assessment of other recent manuscripts in the literature, we identified manuscripts we believed to be of elevated significance to readers engaged in animal worker health and safety work and research, and we discuss those studies in greater detail.",

A study in Nigeria identified low prevalence of LA-MRSA among abattoir workers (1.1%) and distinguished a diversity of S. aureus spa types in the work environment, including a novel spa type (t16751) [36]. The first published study of LA-MRSA among workers and livestock in Trinidad identified a low prevalence among animals (< 1%) and no worker carriage, indicating limited transmission in this country [42]. A case study of MRSA among swine and workers on an Australian swine farm where workers were affected by skin lesions identified high odds of MRSA nasal carriage among the workers (OR 23.6) and a dose-response relationship of MRSA nasal carriage in association with duration of time spent working with pigs [41]. A study in Italy reinforced the elevated prevalence of ST398 among industrial swine (approx. 65%) and swine workers (17%) in that country and highlighted a component of the production cycle (fattening) in which workers had higher risk of exposure [40]. Cuny and colleagues assessed MRSA nasal colonization among butchers and food preparers in Germany to evaluate whether these persons with contact with raw meat were colonized with livestock-associated MRSA, and found limited evidence of colonization (< 1%) [51]. These studies continue to expand our knowledge of the distribution of livestock-associated MRSA, both by industry and by geographic region.",

The authors evaluated samples collected from the farms, transport vehicles, slaughterhouses, and retail outlets, as well as fecal and nasal specimen from workers along the production process. The authors document the widespread distribution of MRSA clone ST612-CC8_t1257-SCCmec_type_IVd (2B) throughout the production cycle. They hypothesize that the multidrug resistance of this clone is mediated by mobile genetic elements, due to the similarity of resistance patterns between the human and animal specimen. The identified prevalent clone is considered both nosocomial and community-associated, highlighting the public health risks associated with the poultry industry in South Africa. This work and the study in Cameroon, detailed below, are of relevance due to the rapid intensification and expansion of industrial food animal production into Africa and the limited research to date on the public health consequences of this industrial growth.",

The remaining four cases were associated with mild disease or colonization without disease. Of note, only two of the eight cases had documented exposure to pigs, considered the main CC9 reservoir in the region. This important paper highlights two core concepts: (1) while rare in humans, CC9 may be associated with significant pathogenicity in humans, including death and (2) nosocomial or community transmission for this pathogen should be considered.

ESBLs are of particular concern because these genes are encoded by plasmids that are easily transferred across bacterial species, potentially resulting in widespread antibiotic resistance. The authors observed high prevalence of CTX-resistant E. coli among both workers and pigs (86% of pig workers and 89% of pigs) on 100 farms studied. ESBL-producing E. coli was detected from more than 65% of both pigs and farms.

Approximately 15% of workers with ILI were positive for influenza A virus, with more than 50% of those infected with a putative swine lineage virus. Additionally, high concordance was noted between A(H1N1)pdm09-like H1N1 viruses isolated from workers with ILI and IAV circulating among swine, indicating species crossover. A second study, led by Borkenhagen et al. identified influenza B and influenza D viruses in swine worker nasal passages during a surveillance study in Malaysia [44]. The authors also recovered porcine circovirus 2 in worker nasal specimen as well as in pig specimen, indicating zoonotic concern associated with this viral pathogen of growing concern in Asia.

This paper marks one of the early studies to consider multiple, and interacting, respiratory exposures in this population. The authors conclude that a majority of these workers were exposed to endotoxin concentrations that exceed recommended guidelines (89%). Workers were also exposed to inhalable dust and ammonia at levels above guidelines. The authors also evaluated the correlation between pairs of these exposures by different dairy tasks, another novelty of this work. Lee et al. used 16s RNA amplicon sequencing to evaluate bacterial composition of dust samples recovered from households of active and former farmers recruited in the Agricultural Lung Health Study, a nested study of the Agricultural Health Study in North Carolina and Iowa [55\u2022\u2022]. Current farming was a significant predictor of the composition and diversity of house dust microbiota. Animal farming was uniquely associated with Firmicutes and Proteobacteria phyla, with Bacillaceae, Bacteroidaceae, Xanthomonadaceae, Streptococcaceae, and Lactobacillacae also identified in dust specimen from homes with animal farmers. The authors identified taxa associated with endotoxin concentration. Asthma status was not associated with bacterial diversity or composition. This paper is notable for its integration of traditional exposure assessment approaches to endotoxin and 16s RNA amplicon sequencing technology for evaluating microbiota, and for contributing detail to our understanding of household-level exposures experienced by animal workers and their families.",

This method was successful, with workers enrolled (n = 1436) demonstrating a 18% mean increase from pre- to post-test knowledge of workplace safety practices (p < 0.05). This paper is of particular note given the proliferation of smartphones and the increasing proportion of the food animal workforce with limited English proficiency. Rodriguez and colleagues noted that more than 1/5 of the participants in their study spoke a Central American indigenous language and were able to receive training through smartphone applications and translation, highlighting the power of this technology to reach many workers with necessary education.",

The authors recommended an increase in participatory approaches and multilingual offerings so as to improve the effectiveness of these programs for migrant workers. Continued efforts to evaluate the effective means of developing and delivering injury prevention and health promotion training to the changing and diverse food animal workforce is an important theme of study.",

In the realm of infectious disease, these studies identified an expanding, and concerning, geographical distribution of MRSA as well as novel transmission pathways. The expansion of MRSA into Africa is of particular note, as the continent has witnessed rapid intensification of food animal production and demand for industrial meat products in recent years. Given the known consequences of unregulated antibiotic usage in animal production for public health and the emergence of LA-MRSA, surveillance, and regulation of LA-MRSA in this region is a critically important direction for future research. In the absence of antibiotic stewardship, interventions to protect workers from zoonotic antibiotic resistant infections\u2014building on the experiences in Europe and the USA\u2014would improve African worker health.",

Studies of respiratory irritants and disease integrated new technologies into multi-exposure assessments, including 16s RNA amplicon sequencing technology. The incorporation of metagenomics approaches will likely mark exposure assessment studies in the future, given the relevance of these techniques in other research areas and the opportunities to shed new light on existing occupational health problems. In particular, microbiome analyses have the potential to highlight the relationship between occupational exposures and chronic conditions, such as cancers and respiratory diseases, whose etiology has remained elusive. Gene expression studies could elucidate pathways of respiratory irritation among highly exposed workers, with relevance for both the food animal workforce and also the general population. As whole genome sequencing techniques have clarified the role of zoonotic pathogens in the emergence of novel pathogens, such as livestock-associated MRSA and zoonotic influenza viruses, genetic, and genomic techniques hold significant power to clarify pathways of occupational disease for the food animal workforce. This is an important area for future research.",

Given the complex mixtures of pathogens, allergens, toxicants, and other compounds that food animal workers are exposed to on the job, the application of mixtures methods to occupational health studies of food animal workers is an important next step for the field. These techniques may hold specific relevance for cancer endpoints of relevance to this workforce, whose etiologies are potentially multifactorial and have remained rather elusive to date.",

As segments of the workforce become increasingly immigrant-based, the specific training needs, and injury experiences of these workers become central. Studies on the effectiveness of safety training and intervention that target the specific needs and experiences of this segment of the workforce are critically important to reducing morbidity in this industry.
