            "text": "\nIntroduction: The aim of the program was to establish a severe respiratory failure (SRF) service with mobile extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) retrieval capability throughout Qatar. This was achieved through the collaboration of various Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC) entities (critical care, cardiothoracic surgery, vascular surgery, and ambulance services). The service was commissioned by the Ministry of Public Health in October 2013 in response to the emerging MERS-Corona outbreak and its associated high mortality. After extensive team building and training, the service treated its first patient in June 2014. The key result has been an improvement in survival rate from 19 to 68%. The service is ranked among the best in the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) outcomes benchmark of worldwide SRF services. The provision of the highest quality care to patients with high predicted mortality has given a new hope in improving clinical outcomes and their reintegration into community. Background: In 2013, a novel virus (MERS Corona virus) was identified in Saudi Arabia, with subsequent cases in other gulf states including Qatar.1 The MERS virus was associated with rapid onset of severe respiratory and renal failure, resulting in a very high mortality rate (>50%) in the early days of the infection.2 The need to establish a SRF center with mobile ECMO retrieval capabilities was identified by the HMC senior leadership in order to anticipate and proactively deal with the situation. The program became a matter of utmost importance due to the inevitable social, political, and geographical factors, which united the people of the GCC. Strategically speaking, regulating the travel norms or bringing in a quarantine on travelers arriving from the countries affected by the MERS Corona virus were not a feasible alternative.3 Furthermore, the high mortality rate, failure of conventional ICU care, and the high cost of transporting and hospitalizing these patients in other countries with advanced respiratory support capability highlighted the need for the development of a severe respiratory failure and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (SRF-ECMO) service program in Qatar. Evidence: The value of a SRF-ECMO service had previously been demonstrated during the international outbreak of H1N1 virus, when survival of patients with significant respiratory failure would have been left to chance or luck if no such advanced program had been in place. The SRF-ECMO services were achieving global survival rates of 60\u201370% in patients with otherwise very high mortality rates.4 Additionally, treatment of SRF in the SRF-ECMO Center decreased mortality rates.5 The vision of the leadership in promoting interdepartmental collaboration along with the support from the management at various levels was the highlight in the development of this program which now is recognized internationally for its clinical excellence and well known for its best practices, teaching, and mentorship programs. Program implementation and team training: The idea of a SRF-ECMO service in the State of Qatar had to be planned immaculately due to the fact that this was the first project of its kind in the country and there is always a sense of anticipation and enigma surrounding such a cutting-edge technology being made available with the help of the government itself. As a result of various fruitful deliberations, a steering committee was created which identified all the potential services that would be involved in the program along with the identification of the potential stakeholders in its successful implementation. The Guys and St Thomas (GSTT) Hospital team in London (UK) was identified as the potential partner for the implementation of the SRF-ECMO in Qatar and hence an official mission consisting of leaders from various services involved went on a field visit to get a firsthand experience about the program. Various discussions with the GSTT team took place in order to understand the processes and the actual difficulties they faced when they started their own SRF-ECMO service.",

Up-to-date cases: The first patient was admitted to the SRF-ECMO service in May 2014 with H1N1 pneumonia and successfully discharged from the hospital after 3 weeks of ECMO therapy. Since then, the SRF-ECMO service has treated 50 patients with a survival rate of 66% in total. Of these patients, 25% were trauma cases. Additionally, the SRF-ECMO service has also started its retrieval arm, moving patients from other hospitals in Qatar to the SRF-ECMO Center following cannulation and placing the patient on ECMO, 11 retrievals have been undertaken with one patient dying before transport. Additionally, two patients have been transferred with ECMO to the Heart Hospital for Cardiothoracic Surgery (severe PE and thoracic trauma with bronchial tear) and one patient has been successfully repatriated on ECMO to India using our own aeromedical ECMO transfer team. Summary: The Qatar SRF-ECMO program is one of the few programs worldwide that operates to the highest level and has been developed in less than 6 months. This has only been possible thanks to the enormous support of the leadership, dedication of the multidisciplinary team, and the partnership with an experienced center such as Guy's and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust.",
