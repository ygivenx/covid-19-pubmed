            "text": "Acute bronchiolitis is the most common lower respiratory tract infection in infants and young children, and one of the most common causes of hospital admission during infancy. The majority of children hospitalized for bronchiolitis are under the age of 6 mo [1]. It is known that acute bronchiolitis is predominantly a viral disease [2]. Almost 90% of cases are related to viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, coronavirus, parainfluenza, influenza and rhinovirus. In recent years new human respiratory viruses like human metapneumovirus, bocavirus and new human corona viruses have been reported, as possible pathogens causing acute bronchiolitis [3]. Bordetella pertussis has also been identified in infants hospitalized with acute bronchiolitis, as a single or mainly co-pathogen with respiratory viruses [4\u201310].",

The Ethics Committee of the Ege University Hospital approved the study. A written informed consent was obtained from parents before enrolling infants. Acute bronchiolitis was defined as acute lower respiratory illness characterized by rhinorrhea, cough, and diffuse wheezes or crackles [11]. Previously healthy infants <6 mo of age, who presented with \u22644 d duration of acute bronchiolitis were included in the study.

Fifty-two (30.2%) infants had received one dose of acellular pertussis vaccine, and 46 (26.7%) had received two doses. Seventy-four (43.1%) infants aged <2 mo were non-vaccinated. Bordetella pertussis was identified in 44 (25.6%) of the 172 infants hospitalized for acute bronchiolitis (Table 1). Of the 44 pertussis-positive infants, 27 (61.4%) co-infected with viral respiratory agents, 17 (38.6%) had only B. pertussis, as a sole pathogen. The most prevalent viral agent was RSV, detected in 88 (51.1%) infants with acute bronchiolitis. Among all RSV positive infants, 18.2% (16/88) had co-infection with pertussis. Demographic characteristics of infants with the positive pertussis-PCR and negative pertussis-PCR are shown in Table 2. Pertussis-positive infants were significantly younger than pertussis-negative infants (10 \u00b1 5.5 wk vs. 12.5 \u00b1 6.6 wk; p = 0.025). Pertussis-positive infants were not likely to have older siblings than pertussis-negative infants. Of the 44 pertussis-positive infants, 23 (52.3%) were non-vaccinated, 15 (34.1%) had received one dose of acellular pertussis vaccine, and 6 (13.6%) had received two doses of the vaccine. None of pertussis-positive infants had completed the primary pertussis vaccination series. Pertussis-PCR positivity was higher in infants who had received only one dose vaccine or who had been unvaccinated than those who had received two doses of the vaccine: 23 (31.1%) of the 74 unvaccinated infants and 15 (28.8%) of the 52 infants who had received one dose of acelluler pertussis vaccine were PCR-positive; while only 6 (13%) of the 46 infants who received two doses were pertussis positive (p = 0.029).\n\n",

In the index study, however, 25.5% of young infants aged <6 mo hospitalized with acute bronchiolitis had a positive pertussis PCR and nearly two-thirds of the pertussis-positive infants were co-infected with respiratory viruses such as RSV.

However, even if the first dose of the pertussis vaccine provides partial protection, full infant protection may not be achieved until after the completion of primary vaccination at 6 mo [16]. Acceptable immunity against pertussis is accomplished one month after the third dose of the vaccine [17]. Thus, unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated young infants are highly susceptible to pertussis. In the index study, the majority of the pertussis-positive infants were unvaccinated or had received only one dose of acellular pertussis vaccine. None of the infants had completed the primary pertussis vaccination series. This may explain the high prevalence of B. pertussis in the present study group. Moreover, the prevalence of pertussis was higher in infants who had been unvaccinated (31.1%) or who had received only one dose vaccine (28.8%) than those who had received two doses of the vaccine (13%).",

In fact, in the present study, pertussis was clinically suspected in only 16% of the infants with acute bronchiolitis, who proved to be B. pertussis positive by PCR. The present study also shows that the viral bronchiolitis and pertussis cases could not be separated by clinical or non-specific laboratory findings. Some studies reported that infants who were pertussis-positive had paroxysmal cough and whooping cough episodes more often than infants who were pertussis-negative, which concluded that paroxysmal cough and whooping are important clinical signs for the diagnosis of pertussis [5, 10]. In the index study, however, most pertussis-positive infants presented no paroxysmal cough or whooping episodes. These findings suggest that the lack of paroxysmal cough or whooping cough is not sufficient enough to exclude the diagnosis of pertussis in young infants hospitalized with acute bronchiolitis, in agreement with several studies [7\u20139, 14]. Also, the typical features of viral bronchiolitis, or even the detection of respiratory viruses such as RSV, do not rule out pertussis [5, 9, 10]. For example, wheezing did not distinguish viral bronchiolitis and pertussis [7]. In the present study, wheezing was presented in only half of infants in whom RSV and/or other respiratory viral agents were detected, whereas similarly nearly half of the pertussis-positive infants wheezed.",

            "text": "The clinical significance of B. pertussis infection in infants with acute bronchiolitis has not been clearly defined. Co-infection of B. pertussis with RSV was described to cause severe infections in 2 studies from the United States and Japan [18, 19]. However, newer studies by Greenberg et al. [5] and Crowcroft et al. [10] revealed that co-infection of pertussis and RSV did not adversely affect the outcome in patients admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit with various lower respiratory tract infections including acute bronchiolitis. Nuolivirta et al. [8] also suggests that there were no significant differences between B. pertussis positive and negative cases in the severity of the disease. A recent retrospective study from Israel by Abu Raya et al. [4] reported that young infants hospitalized with acute bronchiolitis in whom B. pertussis was detected had a milder disease severity at admission and during hospitalization than those in whom B. pertussis was not detected [4]. However, in the present prospective study which utilized the same disease severity scores with Abu Raya study, authors found that there were no significant differences in the severity scores at admission and during hospitalization for those with only viral infection compared with B. pertussis co-infection, and it is concluded that co-infection with pertussis did not affect the clinical outcome in infants hospitalized with acute bronchiolitis, which is in agreement with several other studies [5, 8, 10]. Nevertheless, early diagnosis and antibiotic treatment of pertussis is important because it is effective in eradicating B. pertussis from the nasopharynx, thus reducing the risk of transmission [20]. Otherwise, a missed diagnosis in pediatric wards or the pediatric intensive care units may lead to pertussis outbreaks among vulnerable young infants.",
