For example, in work to be published shortly, scientists in Hong Kong have completed DNA sequences of coronaviruses from several different species that turn out to be closely related to the human SARS virus. The WHO has recommended that this work be extended as a priority. The results so far do not indicate whether animals infected humans or vice versa, or how the virus may have jumped between species. When more such sequences are completed, an evolutionary tree for the virus could be constructed that could indicate where it first began to evolve, thus helping to identify the reservoir. Once identified, measures could be put in place to isolate it from human contact.",
