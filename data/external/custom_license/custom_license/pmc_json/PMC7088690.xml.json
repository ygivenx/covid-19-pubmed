Coronaviruses are enveloped, plus strand RNA viruses and belong to the Coronaviridae family. The genomes are linear, non-segmented, and single strand. The coronavirus genomes with 27\u201331.5 kb in length are the largest of the known RNA viruses. The genomes are polycistronic generating a nested set of subgenomic RNAs with common 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 sequences [1]. Based on serologic and phylogenic relationship, coronaviruses are classified into three genera. Alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus consist of various mammalian coronaviruses, whereas gammacoronavirus includes bird viruses [2]. The genus of Alphacoronavirus includes transmissible gastroenteritis virus (also referred to as alphacoronavirus I; ICTV 2009), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, some bat coronaviruses, and the human coronaviruses (HCoVs) NL63 and 229E. In general, HCoV-229E virus causes common cold but occasionally it can be associated with more severe respiratory infections in children, elderly and persons with underlying illness [3\u20135].",

Of the current HCoV-229E isolates, only limited sequence data have been obtained.

PCR fragments were visualized upon agarose gel electrophoreses by ethidium bromide staining. Positive PCR fragments were directly sequenced with their forward and reverse primers in both the directions. Sequencing reactions were performed according to the BigDye Terminator v1.1 protocol (ABI life science). Sequences were analyzed with Coloncode Aligner software (version 3.7.1).

In the 1b replicase gene, there are 84 in 0349 and 81 in J0304 substitutions resulting in 20 and 19 amino acid changes, respectively. Furthermore, one deletion and an insertion were observed. The NSP3 gene encodes for the largest non-structural protein and comprises 1,594 amino acids residues. This protein is a multi-functional protein and acts as Papain-Like protease (PL pro) and also has catalytic activity [14]. In 0349 and J0304, we observed 74 nt substitutions (34 non-synonymous in 0349 and 33 in J0304), a 21 nt insertion at position 286, and a 6 nt deletion at the positions 316\u2013321. The NSP4 gene is situated between the two autoproteolytical proteins NSP3 and NSP5. There are 21 nt substitutions in 0349 that cause five amino acid changes. In J0304, there are 19 substitutions, 4 of them are non-synonymous. NSP5 has a proteolytic role with cysteine protease activity. It is very important in viral replication and, therefore, often referred to as the main protease (Mpro) [14, 15]. The Mpro-mediated processing pathways are well conserved in all coronaviruses and it cleaves as many as 11 pp1a/pp1b sites to produce a total of 13 mature proteins [16]. Although there are 7 changes at nucleotide acid level in 0349, there is only one amino acid difference (E222D). The same for J0304 with 10 substitutions that cause only two changes in amino acid level (F12L and E222D). The NSP6 gene encodes a membrane-spanning protein [14]. Eight nucleotide substitutions are found in 0349 and 7 in J0304, of which one is non-synonymous (V86I). The HCoV-229E genome encodes several small non-structural proteins, like NSP7 to NSP10, that have RNA-binding activity and are believed to be involved in viral RNA synthesis [14]. There is one substitution in the NSP7 gene in 0349 and 3 in J0304 that have no effect on the encoded protein. In NSP8, there are 6 nt substitutions, all except one are synonymous (I179T). There are three nucleic acids substitutions in NSP9 of 0349 and five in J0304, one of them non-synonymous (T23I). Within the NSP10 gene there are 6 nt substitutions in 0349, including two that change the amino acid sequence (S18A and C57S). Although we have 8 nt substitutions in J0304, there is only one that has effect on amino acid level (C57S).",

Furthermore, two short deletions with lengths of 2 and 4 nt are observed in 0349, and a 4 nt deletion in J0304. The effect of such deletions on 3\u2032UTR structure and function is unknown. For the betacoronaviruses MHV and BCoV, it has been proposed that there are two conserved RNA structures at the upstream end of the 3\u2032UTR: a bulged stem-loop and an adjacent pseudoknot [22]. There is a highly conserved pseudoknot in all alphacoronaviruses but not a detectable counterpart of the bulged stem-loop in any proximity, upstream or downstream of the pseudoknot [22, 23]. Strain 0349 showed most substitution (7/8) and deletions in the first 150 nt of the 3\u2032UTR. Surprisingly, the downstream remainder of the 3\u2032UTR, in which we observe only 1 substitution, is labeled hyper-variable region (HVR). The HVR is marked as highly divergent in sequence and structure, even among closely related coronaviruses [24]. This HVR region harbors the octanucleotide 5\u2032-GGAAGAGC-3\u2032, which is conserved in all coronavirus 3\u2032UTRs, situated around 70\u201380 nt from the 3\u2032 end of the genome [25].
