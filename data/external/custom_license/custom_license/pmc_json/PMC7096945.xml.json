            "text": "A new human coronavirus isolated from a patient in Saudi Arabia is raising questions over how to handle the intellectual property (IP) of newly emerging infectious diseases. As Nature Biotechnology went to press, the World Health Organization (WHO) had been notified of 81 cases and 45 deaths globally since September 2012 attributed to the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, (MERS-CoV). Ali Mohamed Zaki, a microbiologist at Soliman Fakeeh Hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, who isolated the virus from a patient, has lost his job after announcing the existence of the virus through a public medium. Saudi officials accuse him of mailing a virus sample to a laboratory in The Netherlands without permission. They also claim that patents filed by the Dutch researchers have delayed the Saudi health response.",

The Saudi Ministry of Health told Zaki that the virus did not match any pathogens in their screen. In early September, Fouchier's lab told Zaki that the sample was a new kind of coronavirus, similar to the severe acute respiratory disease (SARS) that killed at least 774 people in 2003 and infected over 8,000. On September 15 Zaki posted the news to ProMED, an email listserv hosted by the International Society for Infectious Diseases.",

Future diagnostics or treatments could be \u201cpartially dependent on our patents,\u201d Fouchier says, but \u201cthe IP we filed at no point in time has stood in the way of test development.\u201d By May 2013 at least 20 people had died of the virus. At the World Health Assembly held in Geneva that month, Memish said that \u201cpatenting of the virus\u201d was causing diagnostics delays, even though patent applications are unenforceable while pending. And as the application listed investigators from both Erasmus Medical Center and Soliman Fakeeh Hospital as inventors, it would normally be managed by their host institutions, Fouchier says, meaning the Saudis would have had a hand in controlling the IP until Zaki left.",

In a 2007 outbreak of avian influenza (H5N1), Indonesia claimed ownership of virus under the CBD and demanded fair access to any vaccines that resulted from sharing virus samples. The WHO issued a resolution covering influenza samples, but the resolution does not apply to MERS, a coronavirus. So far, Saudi Arabia has not yet made a similar demand. In fact, Fouchier says the Saudis have not asked for help or material, which he has given free of charge to researchers in over 100 countries.",
