EV71 is a non-enveloped, single-strand positive sense RNA virus, which is taxonomically classified within the Enterovirus A species of the Enterovirus genus of the family Picornaviridae [3, 4]. EV71 was first isolated from the stool of an infant with fatal encephalitis in California [5]. Since it was initial described in 1974, outbreaks of EV71 infection have occurred periodically throughout the world, including Malaysia, Singapore, Japan, Australia, the United States, Germany, Taiwan, and mainland China [6\u201311]. However, the mechanisms underpinning the pathogenesis of EV71 infection and its associated complications still remain largely unknown.",

            "text": "Based on clinical manifestations and animal experiments [12\u201315], one hypothesis is that the inflammatory response, characterized by a cytokine storm, is induced by EV71 infection and subsequently leads to pathological changes in the central nervous system (CNS), resulting in further disruption of CNS stability. Anti-virus infections are often dominated by a Th1 response. There are studies showing that pro-inflammatory factors, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) are increased in the serum or cerebrospinal fluid of fatal EV71 cases. Besides, the co-emergence of Th17 and Th1 cells has recently been observed in several viral infections, such as coronavirus [16], human immunodeficiency virus [17], simian immunodeficiency virus [18], respiratory syncytial virus [19] and cytomegalovirus [20]. One study showed that the Th17 subset was involved in the immunopathogenesis of EV71 infection and that the concentration of IL-17 in the sera of EV71 infected children was increased compared to controls [21]. Th17 responses are characterized by the production of IL-17 as the signature cytokine. The IL-17 cytokine family includes six members: IL-17A-F. Among them, IL-17A and IL-17F are the central players in the adaptive immune response. IL-17F, sharing 50% homology with IL-17A, has been considered as an inflammatory cytokine since it can induce many pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The IL-17F gene is located on chromosome 6p12.2. One of our lab\u2019s previous studies showed IL-17F rs763780 was associated with protection against EV71 encephalitis [22]. In this study, we aimed to identify whether IL-17F rs1889570 and rs4715290 gene polymorphisms were associated with the susceptibility to severe EV71 infection in the Chinese Han population.",

The genotype frequencies of each group obeyed the Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium (p > 0.05). Genotype distribution and allele frequency of IL17F rs1889570 and rs4715290 in EV71-infected children and healthy controls are presented in Table 1. Considering the rs1889570 gene polymorphism, the genotype distribution in the control group was 40% (132/330) for C/C, 50.30% (166/330) for C/T and 9.7% (32/330) for T/T, which was similar to that of EV71-infected patients: 33% (112/336) for C/C, 53.27% (179/336) for C/T and 13.93% (45/336) for T/T (p = 0.118). The frequencies of the C and T alleles were 65.15% (430/660) and 34.85% (230/660) in the control group, compared to 59.97% (403/672) and 40.03% (269/672), respectively, in the EV71 infected patients (p = 0.54). In addition, the severe cases had a significantly higher frequency of the T/T genotype than the mild cases (p = 0.01). In mild cases, the genotype distribution was 37.56% for C/C, 52.49% for C/T and 9.95% for T/T, while it was 25.22% for C/C, 54.78% for C/T and 20.00% for T/T in severe cases. Similarly, the T allele was observed with significantly higher frequency in severe cases than in mild cases (47.39% vs. 36.20%, OR = 1.588, 95% CI = 1.1\u20132.2, p = 0.006).

However, for the rs4715290 polymorphism, no differences were observed in genotype distribution and allele frequency between controls and EV71-infected patients (p = 0.773, p = 0.685). There were no statistical differences in rs4715290 genotype distribution and allele frequency when comparing severe cases (p = 0.621, p = 0.541) or cases with EV71 encephalitis (p = 0.786, p = 0.567) with mild cases.\n",

To date, no study has been performed on the rs4715290 gene polymorphism. Here, we aimed to identify whether the IL-17F rs1889570 and rs4715290 gene polymorphisms were associated with susceptibility to severe EV71 infection in the Chinese Han population. No significant difference was found between EV71 infection in children and the healthy controls in terms of the distribution of IL-17F rs1889570 and rs4715290 genotypes and alleles. The data also revealed that the rs4715290 gene polymorphism was not associated with the severity of EV71 infection when comparing severe cases and EV71 encephalitis with mild cases. However, we found the frequency of the rs1889570 T/T genotype and T allele were markedly overrepresented in severe cases, including cases of EV71 encephalitis, when compared to mild cases and healthy controls, which suggested that the polymorphism in rs1889570 might be associated with the severity of EV71 infection in the Chinese Han population. This result is consistent with the reported results for asthma in a South Indian population [34] and tuberculosis in a Chinese population [35].",

In our study, we found significantly higher WBC counts, CRP levels, BG concentrations and a longer duration of fever in EV71 infected subjects with the rs1889570 T/T genotype. However, there were no differences between other organ function parameters, such as ALT, AST, CK-MB, among the different genotypes after EV71 infection.

            "text": "The actual mechanism of how IL-17F gene polymorphisms affect the severity of EV71 infection is unclear, but the following postulation may be plausible. IL-17 may play an immunopathological role in tissue damage during viral infection. Accumulating data suggest that IL-17 can augment the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IL-8 and IL-1\u03b2, as well as chemokines, including MCP-1, CXCL-6, CXCL-7 and CXCL-8, and matrix metalloproteinases. This will result in the recruitment, mobilization and activation of immune cells leading to several inflammatory processes and tissue damage [17, 37, 38]. In addition, in the central nervous system (CNS), human Th17 cells could promote blood brain barrier (BBB) disruption and CNS inflammation by co-expressing IL-17, IL-22 and granzyme B promoting the recruitment of additional CD4+ lymphocytes [39]. Huppet et al also reported that IL-17 induced BBB disruption through the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by NAD(P)H oxidase and xanthine oxidase, which are subsequently responsible for the disruption and down-regulation of tight junction molecules and the activation of the endothelial contractile machinery [40]. Furthermore, in the EV71-infected rhesus monkey infant model, the up-regulation of IL-17 was sustained in the peripheral blood [15]. ROR \u03b3t has been proven to be the key transcription factor for the differentiation of Th17 cells and the release of IL-17 [41]. Chen et al revealed that the frequency of Th17 cells in the peripheral blood, the concentration of IL-17, and the level of expression of acid-related orphan nuclear receptor gamma t (ROR \u03b3t) significantly increased in EV71 infected children [21]. Based on the previous publications and our data, we further explored whether there was a relationship between IL-17F rs1889570 polymorphism and serum IL-17F levels in EV71-infected patients. The results showed significantly higher serum IL-17F levels in patients with the rs1889570 T/T genotype who had severe cases of EV71 infection. Since IL-17F rs1889570 is located on the promotor region, our findings suggest that the IL-17F rs1889570 gene polymorphism could affect IL-17F expression. Under such conditions, it could be concluded that rs1889570 T allele was likely to increase the severity of EV71 infection and the incidence of EV71 encephalitis by upregulating serum IL-17F levels, which could further induce a higher amount of upstream inflammatory mediators and BBB disruption. Perhaps this is one of the pathogenic mechanisms occurring following EV71 infection. Further multi-center studies with a larger sample size and multiple ethnic groups are required to determine the effects of genetic variants of the IL-17F gene.",
