About 200 people remain sick; others may be infected but not showing symptoms; and the SARS virus could hop over from its natural animal host at any time to haunt us once again. Global vigilance, the WHO argued, must be kept up. Indeed, the reprieve we are now celebrating may be no more than a breathing space. SARS could turn out to be seasonal, like influenza, and come back with the next Northern Hemisphere winter. If so, the intense level of scientific research into the disease must also be maintained, to develop therapies and vaccines.",

There are several stages to bringing a newly emerging disease under control. First, a cluster of unusual symptoms must be recognized and public-health authorities alerted. These officials must respond by isolating patients, tracing their contacts and controlling their movement. Meanwhile, the pathogen involved must be identified. In the longer term, therapeutic strategies must be developed and the source of the infection \u2014 usually animals that harbour the virus \u2014 must be pinned down.",

Although a more infectious disease would probably have been impossible to contain, our success in controlling SARS was a consequence of rigorous international activity in isolating infected people. And when it came to characterizing the pathogen, the scientific response was exemplary. The credit goes to the network of virologists put together by the WHO, which quickly identified the SARS virus. The unsung hero was Klaus St\u00f6hr, the WHO official who built the SARS team and nurtured an atmosphere in which normal scientific competition could be suspended. St\u00f6hr, who leads the WHO's influenza project, built his team around the WHO's existing flu network. Even as the SARS crisis was at its peak, this network quietly reinforced its merit by identifying the virus responsible for a virulent type of avian flu that had broken out in poultry farms in the Netherlands and was jumping over into humans (see 10.1038/422247b).",

Had China been more attentive to this, and launched a vigorous investigation into the outbreak of atypical pneumonia that emerged in its southern Guangdong province in November last year, SARS might have been nipped in the bud before it established its initial human foothold. Unfortunately, disease surveillance has never had a high priority in health spending. Although it is reasonably sophisticated in the United States, Canada and some other developed countries, it is very patchy elsewhere.",

One model is the existing WHO influenza network, which samples the flu viruses in general circulation, to monitor for dangerous variants and to help plan vaccine production. Extending this approach to other viruses would be extremely expensive, however. Given the difficulty of getting politicians to spend large sums of money on averting unknown, future threats, the immediate priority should instead be on improving basic clinical surveillance. This already has a strong foundation in the form of the WHO's Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network. Established in 2000, this network involves 145 countries and aims to monitor and investigate rumours about unusual disease symptoms. But its effectiveness is limited by the fact that it merely coordinates existing, poorly resourced national surveillance activities.",

Given this, the desultory state of our preparedness for a flu pandemic is shameful. SARS was a genuinely new disease, so drugs and vaccines couldn't immediately be brought into play. In contrast, effective drugs that target the flu virus do exist, and methods for the rapid production of vaccines are already established. Yet no government has stockpiled drugs, and only Canada has organized capacity for producing flu vaccines for all of its citizens. With the WHO's flu network doing such a sterling job in monitoring for potential pandemic strains, this failure to prepare for converting the knowledge it provides into widespread immunization is shockingly negligent.",
