Viral RNA, extracted from 150 \u03bcl of total culture supernatant using\nthe viral RNA extraction mini-prep system kit (Viogene, Sunnyvale, CA) with the protocol\nrecommended by the manufacturer, was eluted in 50 \u03bcl of diethylpyrocarbonate-treated\nwater. RT-PCR amplifications were performed using a Reverse iT\u2122 one-step RT-PCR kit\n(Abgene, Epsom, Surrey, UK) using the primer set specific for pan-enterovirus detection (29). RT-PCR was carried out in a 25-\u03bcl reaction\nmixture containing 11 \u03bcl of RNA template, 0.5 \u03bcl of 10 \u03bcm\nforward and reverse primers, 0.5 \u03bcl of kit-supplied enzyme mixture, and 12.5 \u03bcl\nof 2\u00d7 RT-PCR Master Mix. The RT step included incubation at 42 \u00b0C for 1 h and\nthen at 95 \u00b0C for 5 min followed by 25 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 30 s, 50 \u00b0C\nfor 30 s, and 72 \u00b0C for 1 min and a final elongation step of 72 \u00b0C for 5 min.\nPCR products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel containing 2 \u03bcg/ml\nethidium bromide. The DNA bands were visualized and photographed through UV\ntransillumination.",

Form I crystal\nhas two molecules per asymmetric unit related by a pseudo-dyad; form II crystal has only one\nmolecule. As shown in Fig. 2A, the\nstructure of CVB3 3Cpro adopts a chymotrypsin protein fold similar to those of RV\n3Cpro (4) and other viral 3C proteases. The\nroot-mean-square deviation between CVB3 3Cpro and RV 3Cpro is 0.73\n\u00c5 for 166 C\u03b1 atoms. The N terminus starts with an \u03b1-helix of residues\n1\u201314 and is followed by two topologically equivalent \u03b2-barrel domains comprising\nresidues 15\u201377 and 99\u2013173, which pack together to form an extended shallow\ngroove for substrate binding.

This loop is flexible on the protein surface, which may\nregulate the substrate binding. Such variable loop conformation was also observed in the\n3Cpro structure of foot-and-mouth disease virus (30). The C147A mutant of CVB3 3Cpro crystallized in a unit cell similar to\nthat of the wild-type form I crystal and diffracted to 1.38 \u00c5 (Table 1 and Fig. S2).

However, the EPDTC inhibition of CVB3\n3Cpro is 4.4-fold weaker (Fig. S1); this is probably because the side chain of\nGlu71 is hydrogen-bonded to the N\u03b41 atom of His40 to favor the\nprotonation of N\u03b52. Therefore the N\u03b52 atom must be deprotonated before EPDTC\nbinding takes place. The lack of electron density for the bulky substituent groups might suggest\nthat they are disordered. According to a computer model of the inhibitor with SARS-CoV\n3CLpro (21), the entire EPDTC could be\naccommodated in the active site with sufficient room for the bulky side groups to rotate about.\nOn the other hand, a molecule of DMSO (SARS-CoV) or MPD (CoV-229E) is bound in the S1 site of\n3CLpro. Although the DMSO molecule forms a hydrogen bond with Ser144 of\nthe former enzyme, the smaller side chain of Ala143 in the latter case provides\nhydrophobic interaction and larger space for MPD bonding (Fig.\n3, C and D).
