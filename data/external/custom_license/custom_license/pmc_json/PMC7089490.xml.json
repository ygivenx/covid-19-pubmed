As a result, PRCV had a deletion of 224 amino acids (European strain) or 227 amino acids (American strains) and the loss of the antigenic sites C and B in the spike S protein [9, 12, 22, 35, 36].

In general, TGEV Ab titer in infected animals during the acute phase of infection was less than this titer in the infected animals during the convalescent phase [3]. The infected piglets remain healthy after the typical experiment. The infection has produced adequate immunity due to the ability of viruses (TMK22 and pTMK22) to infect the intestinal tract and consequently stimulate B cells for the production of immunoglobulin class A (IgA) [3]. In addition, cell-mediated immunity plays a direct role in the protection and the recovery from infection, and the production of Abs is regulated by various cytokines derived from activated mononuclear cells during the immune response [34].\n",
