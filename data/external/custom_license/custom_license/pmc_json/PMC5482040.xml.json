            "text": "Toxoplasmosis caused by the intracellular protozoan Toxoplasma gondii is a ubiquitous worldwide parasitic zoonotic disease (Innes, 2010a). It is usually asymptomatic in immune-competent individuals but may occasionally lead to severe ocular and neurological disorders (Furtado et al., 2013). When it comes to immune-compromised and congenitally infected individuals, toxoplasmosis can result in lethal systemic disease and eventually death (Shen et al., 2016). Currently, the control of T. gondii mainly depends on chemotherapy, such as the combination of sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine, but these drugs have serious side effects (Petersen and Schmidt, 2003). Even though many antigens including rhoptry, surface, and dense granule excreted-secreted antigens were evaluated as potential vaccines (Kur et al., 2009), there is no licensed vaccine against T. gondii infection clinically making the situation even worse (Jongert et al., 2009; Innes, 2010b). Therefore, new efficient drugs and safe protective therapies are needed.",

Subsequent to that, interest in Chinese traditional medicine has risen to be considered for providing therapeutic reagents for many infectious diseases. The Radix clematidis extract is reported to be a potent inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and notably blocks the nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) pathway in breast carcinoma cells (Noh et al., 2011). Na-Bangchang and Karbwang (2014) found that a Chinese traditional medicine Atractylodes possesses various pharmacological effects with anticancer, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial activity, and is now a potential chemotherapeutic for cholangiocarcinoma found in Southeast Asia. Artemisia anomala has been widely and in long-term used for the treatment of inflammatory diseases in China. Recent findings suggested that it manifests its anti-inflammatory effects through inhibiting the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) (Tan et al., 2014). Glycyrrhizin, extracted from Liquorice, was reported to have antiviral activity through inhibiting replication of the pathogen (Cinatl et al., 2003).",

The use of most herbal medicines dates back almost 2000 years in Shennong\u2019s Materia Medica. However, limited information is available on their pharmacological activity since the use of herbal medicine has been based mainly on empirical treatment. As a consequence, there exists a possibility that many herbal medicines may have unknown effects on different health problems. In this study, we screened five herbal medicines that have different pharmacological effects and combined them into a prescription according to the traditional Chinese medicine compatibility principle. We evaluated the protective efficacy provided by the different dosages of this prescription against the challenge of RH strain of T. gondii in a mouse model.",

Sterile water and genomic DNA of T. gondii tachyzoites were included as negative and positive controls in each run. In addition, a plasmid pMD-SAG1 was constructed based on pMD18-T vector using the same primers. To establish standard curves, plasmid pMD-SAG1 was tenfold serially diluted ranging from 2\u00d7104 to 2\u00d7109 copies per milliliter tested in each independent experiment for T. gondii quantification.

The spleen of the PBS group was extensively necrotic with few lymphoid cells and plenty of scattered cells observed. Lymphoid follicles were also absent (Fig. 4p).

Therefore, five herbal medicines that have different pharmacological effects were screened and combined into a prescription according to the traditional Chinese medicine compatibility principle and then the drug potential and protective efficacy were evaluated through a mouse model.",

We also found the livers of sulfadiazine and 500 mg Chinese herbs-treated mice displayed few changes while a clear cellular separation could be observed in the liver of PBS group mice that presented a morphologically incomplete and hepatocellular dysfunction. The lungs of sulfadiazine and Chinese herbs-treated mice possessed a significantly lower parasite load than that of the PBS control group (P<0.05) and the histological result verified this from the morphological perspective. The lungs of all T. gondii-infected mice displayed interstitial pneumonia which had much thicker alveolar walls compared to those of the blank control group. However, the situations of the PBS group, the 300 and 600 mg Chinese herbs-treated groups were the worst such that no complete pulmonary alveoli structure could be observed. This revealed the fact that the lungs barely functioned and resulted in rapid death at 7 dpi as shown in the survival curve. As for the spleen, the parasite in sulfadiazine and 500 mg Chinese herbs-treated groups was at a significantly lower level than that in the PBS group at 7 dpi (P<0.05). The spleens of all infected mice showed necrosis and degeneration. Lymphoid follicles of the PBS group were barely observed, and those of sulfadiazine and 500 mg Chinese herbs-treated groups also had evidence of necrosis and degeneration with small scattered nodules of dead lymphoid cells. These results were in accordance with the survival curve that the mice of sulfadiazine and 500 mg Chinese herb groups lived much longer than the controls. Mice treated with 500 mg Chinese herbs ((9.8\u00b10.69) d) showed a significantly longer survival time (P<0.05) than the PBS-treated mice. In addition, the average survival time of 500 mg Chinese herbs-treated mice presented a similar level as many studies on DNA vaccines; the average survival time of rROP18-immunized ICR mice is 11.5 d (Qu et al., 2013) and Zheng et al. (2013) found that after being immunized with rROP5+rSAG1, mice had prolonged survival time of 12.1 d. We assume that T. gondii was able to move to most tissues of mice through blood based on the fact that DNA copies of T. gondii had been detected in blood, liver, spleen, and lung. Actually, Dadimoghaddam et al. (2014) found T. gondii moved to various tissues within 24 h after i.p. injection and the largest number of parasites was observed in the heart, kidney, and liver. The movement trend of T. gondii and parasite load in tissues have been used mainly to evaluate the vaccine effect, anti-parasite and drug disease severity (Bell and Ranford-Cartwright, 2002; Romand et al., 2004). The results gathered here suggested that these combined Chinese herbs could afford efficient protection against acute T. gondii infection.",

            "text": "Machado et al. (2014) demonstrated that the increased monocytes and lymphocytes could be treated as a relevant hematological biomarker of acute retinochoroidal lesions caused by T. gondii. Thus we used an IDEXX ProCyte Dx\u00ae hematology analyzer to determine the changes of cell proportions in blood at 3 and 7 dpi. We found that there was no significant difference among the T. gondii infected groups on eosinophil at 3 or 7 dpi. However, monocytes and neutrophils of infected mice were remarkably increased while lymphocytes were dramatically decreased compared to those of the blank control group at 7 dpi. On the other hand, the significantly lower lymphocyte and slighter lower monocyte of sulfadiazine and 500 mg Chinese herbs-treated mice than those of other Chinese herbs-treated mice suggests that effective drugs may decrease the cell proportions to hinder the cellular transmission of T. gondii. There are no differences between normal mice and infected mice at 3 dpi. We found T. gondii was capable of escaping the immune system in blood when combining the results of parasite load in blood at 3 dpi. In accordance with the results of Machado et al. (2014), the monocytes were increased drastically at 7 dpi. The recruitment of monocytes is essential in restricting the replication of the T. gondii murine model (Mordue and Sibley, 2003; Robben et al., 2005). On the other hand, monocytes as well as neutrophils and eosinophils are strong candidates for transport of T. gondii in blood in a way known as a \u201cTrojan Horse\u201d (Lachenmaier et al., 2011), so the activity of monocyte must be carefully controlled. However, the trend of lymphocytes was opposite to that of Machado et al. (2014). The percentage of lymphocytes was decreased in infected mice mainly because ICR mice were sensitive to T. gondii and failed to eliminate the parasite, which was in accordance with the result that all infected mice eventually died.",
