The basic features of the innate immune system are believed to have originated in animals approximately 600 million years ago4. Studying non-traditional model organisms has led to the identification of molecules and pathways that are highly conserved through evolution, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and pathways such as RNA interference (RNAi)5,6. Similarly, studies of the immune systems of lower vertebrates have provided clues to the evolutionary origins of immune components. For example, B cells in teleosts and amphibians have phagocytic activity, supporting the idea that B cells evolved from ancestral phagocytic cells7.",

Since then, natural selection processes have driven the evolution of immune systems that show new levels of complexity but that also have variations on a common theme. For example, unconventional T cell receptors (TCRs) have been discovered in several species, including certain marsupial species, sharks and frogs. TCR\u03bc receptors in marsupials and new antigen receptor (NAR)-TCRs in sharks are unique TCR types that contain two variable domains, one of which has an antibody-like structure. Similarly, the African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) uses a novel TCR type that contains an antibody-like variable domain9,10,11. These TCRs seem to have evolved convergently, suggesting that they might have as yet unrecognized roles in the immune responses of each of these species and might also exist in other species.",

In many cases, zoonotic infections that are pathogenic in humans can coexist with their natural host reservoirs in the absence of disease. This demonstrates the importance of this co-evolutionary relationship. Bats are one example of a group of mammals that has a long co-evolutionary history with the viruses that they harbour. Although infection with viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Hendra virus and Ebola virus seems to result in little pathology in bats, the infection of other species often causes severe disease and has fatal consequences. Bats might have become able to coexist with viruses through the evolution of unique immune mechanisms associated with the control of viral replication. It has also been suggested that the severe pathology and disease that often occurs as a result of the spillover of viruses into other vertebrate hosts may result from the disturbance of this finely tuned interaction of viral proteins with their targets in host cells13. Understanding how bats and other natural reservoirs, such as birds, coexist with human pathogens could potentially lead to the discovery of immune mechanisms that control viral replication. These mechanisms could then eventually be used to develop disease control strategies in other species.",

Immunologists have obtained a detailed knowledge of immune responses to pathogens through the use of mouse models, which have been used to evaluate new vaccines and therapeutics. Although there are many similarities between the immune systems of mice and humans, there are also some key differences. For example, recent genomic studies on several inflammatory diseases have shown a lack of correlation in responses between mice and humans14. Furthermore, there are many examples of successful preclinical trials of immunomodulatory drugs or vaccines in mice that have failed to translate into successful clinical trials in humans15,16,17. One issue is that some of the phenotypic markers used to discriminate immune cell populations in mice are absent in humans, and some subpopulations of immune cells differ between humans and mice (reviewed in Ref. 18). In addition, mouse and non-human primate models often incompletely reproduce human disease phenotypes, and these species are often resistant to infection with human-specific pathogens18. Researchers have circumvented this problem by the use of genetically modified or immunocompromised mice to allow the establishment of infection. Unfortunately, the results from such complex artificial systems have been difficult to interpret and translate to clinical medicine. Therefore, it has become a priority for translational medical research to focus on the development of more appropriate animal models.",

            "text": "Non-traditional laboratory animal models. There are many examples in the literature in which non-traditional animal models have been highly informative for our understanding of immunology19. For several decades the chicken has been used to study immunology, sexual development, and developmental biology of the limbs, nervous system and brain20. Indeed, with the exception of mice and humans, arguably the most thoroughly characterized immune system is that of the chicken. The easy accessibility to the chicken embryo has aided our understanding of immune system development and was fundamental in delineating the T cell-dependent and B cell-dependent arms of the adaptive response. Studies of the thymus have provided information about T cell maturation (reviewed in Ref. 21), and the analysis of the bursa of Fabricius has informed our understanding of B cell development and function22. Furthermore, the first interferon (IFN) was discovered in the chicken23. Other animals have also provided a wealth of knowledge concerning aspects of immunity and human disease. Natural bovine tuberculosis infection in cattle has been used as a model for human tuberculosis, and cattle are the reservoir for Mycobacterium bovis, which can be transmitted to humans24. Similarly, ferrets are widely accepted as an excellent model for influenza infection: they are naturally susceptible to infection with human influenza viruses, and the disease pathology that they develop resembles that of humans infected with influenza25. Another example is the woodchuck: these animals are a good model for studying hepatitis B virus (HBV) because they can be infected by the woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV), which is closely related to HBV. Natural infection of woodchucks by WHV produces chronic liver disease and primary hepatocellular carcinoma, which are similar to the diseases induced by HBV in humans (reviewed in Ref. 26). Finally, studies of Tasmanian devil facial tumour disease and canine transmissible venereal tumour have helped us to understand the role of the immune system in shaping tumour evolution and have provided insights into the crucial roles of MHC genes (reviewed in Ref. 27).",

Understanding the differences between the immune systems of domesticated and wild animal hosts and comparing their immune systems to that of humans is crucial for unravelling the complex disease mechanisms that are involved in zoonotic infections (Fig. 2). Furthermore, by studying the pathogen in its natural host we might be able to devise efficient control measures in that host, thereby disrupting the transmission of the pathogen to humans. This has important implications for predicting, preventing and controlling spillover events and for the development of novel therapeutics and diagnostics.

Chickens are acutely susceptible to infection with H5N1 strains of HPAI, which typically cause death within 18\u201336 hours. Studying waterfowl, such as ducks, and comparing their immune responses to influenza virus with those of chickens might provide invaluable insights into the 'aberrant' immune reactions that occur in influenza virus spillover hosts, such as chickens, pigs and humans (Fig. 3). Moreover, understanding the mechanisms by which some recent isolates of H5N1 viruses cause systemic disease and death in ducks32 will help to identify the elements of the immune response that are involved in disease lethality.",

The recent advances in high-throughput sequencing techniques have facilitated whole-genome sequencing of a large number of species, including some that are reservoir hosts of important zoonotic viruses, and others that are susceptible to disease caused by those viruses. Comparative analysis of these genomes can identify gene candidates for disease-susceptibility or disease-resistance phenotypes. There are two basic approaches for identifying these candidates, both of which start by selecting two groups of species on the basis of the segregation of a particular phenotype \u2014 in this case, disease susceptibility or resistance during infection with zoonotic viruses. The first approach is to carry out high-throughput comparison of all genes across the two groups to identify features that cluster separately between the groups. The results of this type of analysis can then be subjected to categorical enrichment analysis (for example, gene ontology or pathway analysis34) to highlight gene candidates that seem to be linked to the disease phenotype that is under investigation. The second approach involves generating lists of candidate genes on the basis of a literature review. In the case of zoonotic virus infection this might begin with genes of the innate immune system, such as those related to interferon (IFN) production and signalling.",

As perhaps a counter-balance, several genes involved in pathogen recognition and immune responses seem to be under positive selection in bats, suggesting that these genes may increase fitness36. Such genes include those encoding DNA-damage sensors, such as DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs; also known as PRKDC) and X-ray repair cross-complementing protein 5 (XRCC5), which have recently been identified as part of a cytoplasmic microbial nucleic acid-sensing complex42. The nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) family member REL is also under positive selection in bats and has multiple roles in the immune system (including the regulation of type I and type III IFN production (Fig. 4)). Other immune genes under positive selection in bats include the genes encoding TLR7, NOD, LRR and pyrin-domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 7 (MAP3K7)36. NLRP3 has a role in the formation of inflammasomes and the induction of inflammation in response to infection. In vitro studies have identified several other key differences in the immune system of bats, although it is not yet clear which of these are related to disease outcome (reviewed in Ref. 43).

Infection of both chickens30 and humans29 with H5N1 HPAI can lead to a severe inflammatory response that is associated with high levels of cytokine production (reviewed in Ref. 28). This observed aberrant immune response has been suggested to be associated with H5N1 mortalities. An intriguing observation is that with H5N1 HPAI infection there is an observed increase in mortality for patients in the middle-age bracket, unlike seasonal influenza deaths, which are mostly confined to infants and the elderly. It has been suggested that infection with H5N1 may result in a more severe disease if the patient's immune system is robust29. With this in mind, a tantalizing explanation for the differences in disease outcomes between natural hosts and spillover hosts might be that natural hosts experience less immunopathology during infection or, more specifically, that they maintain a better balance between promoting virus clearance and inducing dangerous levels of inflammation. Therefore, identifying the factors that trigger immunopathological responses, such as an overly aggressive immune response, during zoonotic infections might enable targeted therapeutic intervention and better outcomes in cases of human disease. Comparative studies between natural hosts (that are resistant to disease) and spillover hosts (that are susceptible to disease) could be very informative in uncovering such potential differences.",

The sooty mangabey is a natural host of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) but does not develop AIDS, whereas the rhesus macaque, a common laboratory model primate, develops AIDS and is used as a model for human HIV. Research has shown that a major factor related to disease outcome is the ability to resolve the initial inflammatory response44. In the non-natural host (the macaque), SIV infection leads to chronic immune activation and progressive disease. By contrast, for the natural host of SIV (the mangabey), the innate immune response resolves within 4\u20138 weeks despite high levels of virus replication. This example illustrates one instance whereby immunopathology might be considered a major determinant of disease outcome.

Wild rodents are natural reservoirs for hantaviruses and display no clinical signs of disease during acute or persistent infection, whereas, in humans, infection causes haemorrhagic fever or cardiopulmonary syndrome. Although laboratory mice can be used to study hantavirus infection, these models do not accurately represent viral persistence observed in wild rodent reservoir populations. Therefore, studies of the natural host using wild mouse models, including deer mice (Peromyscus spp.) and Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus), have been initiated. These studies have demonstrated differences in the immune response of these natural host species to hantavirus infection compared with humans, including evidence for reduced pro-inflammatory responses and evidence for a role of regulatory T cells in limiting immunopathology and in promoting persistent infection46,47.",

If we understand how the bat and duck immune systems respond to viruses, will this help us to develop new therapeutics and vaccines for preventing fatal infections caused by these viruses in humans?

For example, the combination of viral gene segments from four virus strains circulating in three different species (human, swine and poultry) led to the emergence of swine-origin influenza virus (S-OIV) in the human population48. The relevance of a lack of pre-existing immunity became apparent as mortality and morbidity began to rise sharply in the 20- to 40-year-old age group49, whereas the older age group was associated with a lower infection risk50 that was associated with a higher prevalence of pre-existing antibodies that cross-reacted with the 2009 H1N1 virus. The impact of a novel influenza virus arising from wildlife species was felt again in February 2013, when an avian-origin influenza virus emerged in Zhejiang, China, causing more than 130 reported human infections and 36 deaths. This virus seems to have emerged from the mixing of influenza viruses from several avian sources, including ducks and wild birds51. It was the first report of a H7N9 influenza virus infecting humans and was met with little pre-existing immunity. Furthermore, vaccines against H7N9 influenza virus are predicted to be poorly immunogenic because there are few immunogenic T cell epitopes present on the H7 molecule compared with other haemagglutinin subtypes52. Despite this particular virus being highly pathogenic in humans, natural infections with H7N9 viruses in chickens, ducks and other birds are asymptomatic and elicit an immune response that can be detected serologically53. This is in stark contrast to the H5N1 and H7N7 viruses, where disease in humans was associated with a highly pathogenic phenotype in poultry54. The immunological component to this disease in birds suggests that further study of these emerging viruses in poultry and other bird species is required to understand factors influencing disease susceptibility and transmission.",

As mentioned above, for HPAI infection, ducks and chickens represent natural and spillover hosts, respectively. Chickens have lost expression of the innate immune sensor retinoic acid-inducible protein I (RIG-I), which may be an important clue in explaining why they suffer close to 100% mortality from HPAI. Conversely, ducks (which have intact RIG-I expression) develop only mild symptoms in response to HPAI infection and usually survive. It has been shown that the transfection of duck RIG-I into chicken cells induced IFNB promoter activity and limited the replication of low and highly pathogenic avian influenza strains, suggesting a key role of RIG-I in the ability of ducks to be resistant to influenza-mediated disease55. Although it is not understood how the absence of RIG-I in chickens affects their response to other viral infections, it would nevertheless be of interest to generate transgenic chickens that express duck RIG-I and investigate whether these animals are less susceptible to disease following HPAI infection or, indeed, following infection with other viruses.",

This technology has been used in model organisms including zebrafish58,59,60, mice61, rats62 and pigs63. Using these technologies in other species will allow breakthroughs in functional genomic studies in natural reservoir and spillover species, such as ducks, bats and chickens, or in other model species, such as ferrets. This will provide the opportunity to test hypotheses of immune function and regulation in these species. The development of poultry that are less susceptible to H5N1 influenza virus is likely to help to reduce the environmental load of highly pathogenic virus and act to break the chain of infection from poultry to humans. It is hoped that the findings from immunological studies in reservoir hosts will translate to the development of therapeutics for humans and other animals.

Whole-genome analysis of two bat species (Pteropus alecto and Myotis davidii) showed that a high number of genes encoding components of these pathways are positively selected in P. alecto and M. davidii. Many of these genes are positively selected in both species (these encode proteins that are highlighted in green), whereas others have been positively selected in only one of the species (these encode proteins that are highlighted in red). Bat-specific differences in these genes include unique changes to the nuclear localization signals in p53 and the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase MDM2. The impact of these changes on host\u2013pathogen interactions is currently under investigation. The transcription factor REL (which is a member of the NF-\u03baB family) regulates many effector proteins of the innate immune system, including type I interferons (IFNs), and it also participates in the DNA damage response. The gene encoding REL is under positive selection in bats and contains unique amino acid changes that might affect the interaction of REL with inhibitor of NF-\u03baB (I\u03baB). DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) and Ku80 are crucial to the DNA damage response but also form a microbial DNA-sensing complex connected to the type I IFN system.
