So far, MERS patients have mainly been identified in and near the Arabian Peninsula. However, there have also been many cases in other countries in travelers who had visited the Arabian Peninsula [8, 11, 22]. This virus has spread from ill people to others through close contact with infected individuals [1]. The detection of MERS-CoV RNA and the high seroprevalence of antibodies to MERS-CoV in dromedary camels in the Middle East raise the possibility that these animals may be natural/amplification hosts preceding human infection [16, 21]. Genetically, MERS-CoV resembles the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the causative agent for an outbreak of severe acute respiratory disease that occurred in humans in 2002-2003. Therefore, the spread of MERS-CoV infection has raised serious concerns for a potential global pandemic.",

Although mice are not susceptible to MERS-CoV infection, transient expression of human DPP4 in the respiratory tract using a recombinant adenovirus has facilitated the development of a small animal model of MERS for understanding the immune responses against MERS-CoV infection [27].

Crystal structure modeling of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of MERS-CoV S interacting with human DPP4 revealed the amino acid residues in human DPP4 that are critical for binding to S [12, 24]. A site-directed mutagenesis study of mouse DPP4 revealed the critical amino acids that regulate the species specificity of MERS-CoV infection in mice [6]. While the receptor function of DPP4 from mice and hamsters has been investigated in detail [6, 23], to date, there has been no report about DPP4 from rats, another commonly used small-animal model, regarding its potential to function as a receptor for MERS-CoV.",

            "text": "Studies of MERS-CoV infection have been limited because of the highly infectious nature of the virus. Replication-incompetent pseudotyped viruses bearing viral glycoproteins are advantageous because they can be used without heightened biocontainment for investigating virus entry into cells, viral tropism, and the effects of entry inhibitors. A pseudotyped virus is also useful for measuring neutralization titers against highly infectious viruses. Pseudotypes based on vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) have advantages compared with other pseudotypes based on lentiviruses. First, the pseudotype virus titer obtained with the VSV system is generally higher than that obtained with the retrovirus system [17]. Second, the infection of target cells with the VSV pseudotype can be readily detected as GFP-positive cells at 7-16 h postinfection because of the high level of GFP expression in the VSV system [9]. In contrast, the time required for infection in the retrovirus system is 40-72 h [13, 26], which is similar to the time required for live viruses to replicate to a level that results in plaque-forming or cytopathic effects in infected cells. Pseudotypes based on VSV may be applicable not only for the rapid detection of neutralizing antibodies but also for investigating virus entry into a variety of cells. In view of previous findings that a SARS-CoV S protein variant with a shortened cytoplasmic domain is efficiently incorporated into VSV particles [9], the carboxyl-terminal truncation of the MERS-CoV S protein might provide a high titer of the VSV-based MERS-CoV S-bearing pseudotype (MERSpv).",

Similar results were obtained using SARS-CoV with a truncated S protein [9], suggesting that the expression of full-length S protein on the cell surface may be limited by the presence of an ER-retention signal in its C-terminal cytoplasmic domain, resulting in a very low efficiency of incorporation of the S protein into VSV particles. This hypothesis was supported by the immunofluorescent detection of S protein expression: full-length S protein from MERS-CoV localized around the nucleus, probably in the ER/Golgi region, whereas C-terminally truncated S proteins localized on the cell surface and within the cytoplasm (Supplementary Fig. 2). A detailed study is needed to determine the subcellular localization of S proteins and the amino acid residues that constitute the ER retention signal.",

MERS-CoV is capable of infecting a variety of cells in a DPP4-dependent manner. The critical amino acids of DPP4 that are responsible for binding to the S protein have been identified by structural analysis, but they vary among animal species [3]. DPP4 proteins derived from mice and hamsters are not functional receptors for MERS-CoV infection [6, 23]. An analysis of the function of DPP4 from different animal species on the subsequent MERS-CoV infection might provide novel information regarding the host range of MERS-CoV. Therefore, we examined whether the expression of DPP4 from rats, another commonly used small-animal model, supports infection by MERS-CoV. Human and rat DPP4 were expressed in CHO cells, and their expression was confirmed by an immunofluorescence assay (IFA; Fig. 3A). Upon infection with MERSpv-St16 (MOI = 0.2), the expression of GFP was easily detected in the human DPP4-expressing cells. In contrast, there was a limited amount of infection of MERSpv-St16 in the rat DPP4-expressing cells, which was comparable to that of control cells that did not express DPP4 (Fig. 3B), indicating the inability of rat DPP4 to mediate MERSpv-St16 infection. This conclusion was confirmed using MERS-CoV: the expression of MERS-CoV nucleoprotein (N) was detected after inoculation of human DPP4-expressing cells with MERS-CoV (MOI = 1.0), whereas no expression of MERS-CoV N was detected in cells expressing rat DPP4 (Fig. 3C).\n",

The threonine residue at position 293 of rat DPP4 was not included in the mutational analysis because bat DPP4, which contains a threonine residue at position 293 (Table), supports MERS-CoV infection [19]. Furthermore, mutational studies by Raj et al. [20] demonstrated that the amino acid substitution I293T (amino acid residue 295 in their study) in human DPP4 did not significantly decrease binding of MERS-CoV S1, suggesting that amino acid residue 293 of rat DPP4 is not a critical determinant of the inability of rat DPP4 to serve as a functional receptor for MERS-CoV. We examined whether the substitution of these amino acids of rat DPP4 with human DPP4 would lead to a gain of receptor activity. Rat DPP4 mutants were expressed in CHO cells and found to have similar expression levels (Supplementary Fig. 3). CHO cells expressing rat DPP4 bearing a single amino acid substitution with the amino acid from human DPP4 at position 292, 334, or 342 (Rat T292L, V334R, or E342Q) did not support MERSpv-St16 infection (Fig. 4). However, the level of infection of cells expressing rat DPP4 bearing a combination of all three amino acid substitutions (Rat 3x mut) was increased to 10 % of the level of cells expressing human DPP4. These results indicated that the three amino acids at positions 292, 334, and 342 are major determinants of the inability of rat DPP4 to serve as a functional receptor for MERS-CoV. Alignment of rat DPP4 and human DPP4 sequences showed amino acid sequence variations surrounding the RBD-contacting region (amino acids 251 to 352), which may account for the difference in the MERS-CoV receptor functions (Supplementary Fig. 4). We then constructed rat DPP4 bearing the amino acids 251 to 352 of human DPP4 (rat/human chimera). Infection of cells expressing rat/human chimera DPP4 with MERSpv-St16 gave results comparable to those for the cells expressing human DPP4, suggesting that amino acid residues in the RBD-contacting region other than those at positions 292, 334, and 342 are also required for the most efficient use of the entry receptor.\n\n",

It is likely that the inefficient incorporation of full-length S protein into VSV particles is due to an ER retention signal in the C-terminal portion of the cytoplasmic domain, which prevents intracellular transport and surface expression of the S protein. This assumption was supported by the findings that C-terminally truncated S proteins showed a different cellular localization pattern when compared with that of the full-length MERS-CoV S protein. It has been reported that MERS-CoV S-bearing pseudotypes with an HIV backbone [18, 26] are useful for detecting neutralization antibodies in serum samples and may provide a safe and specific assay tool for large-scale seroepidemiological studies. Virus neutralization is the most specific serological assay and is currently considered the gold standard. Barlan et al. [2] reported a VSV-based MERS-CoV-S-bearing pseudotype and used it to analyze the cell entry of MERS-CoV. It is of great interest to clarify whether MERSpv can be applied for neutralization assays with high specificity. Here, we demonstrate that VSV-based MERSpv-St16 infection was inhibited by anti-MERS-CoV-S, but not by anti-MERS-CoV-N or anti-SARS-CoV-S, and that infection was dependent on the expression of DPP4 (Figs. 2 and 4), indicating that the MERSpv-St16 infection is mediated by the interaction of MERS-CoV S with its receptor, DPP4.",

The amino acid sequences of DPP4 that are critical for binding to the RBD of the S protein vary among animal species (Table 1). There are five different amino acid residues in the RBD-contacting region between human and mouse DPP4. In contrast, rat DPP4 shows a different amino acid sequence in the RBD-contacting region; it has four amino acid differences from human DPP4 and only three from bat DPP4. In the present study, the ability of rat-derived DPP4 to serve as a receptor for MERS-CoV was investigated using MERSpv-St16. We demonstrated that MERSpv-St16 did not infect cells expressing rat DPP4. This result was consistent with what was observed using MERS-CoV (Fig. 3). We thus concluded that rat DPP4 did not function as a receptor for MERS-CoV. Our findings, in combination with studies published by others, indicate that rodents are not susceptible to MERS-CoV infection.",

In contrast, it has been shown that a single substitution in the RBD-contacting region of mouse DPP4 with the corresponding residue of human DPP4 allows MERS-CoV infection, although to a lesser extent than that observed in human cells [6]. It has also been suggested that a potential glycosylation site at position 330 of mouse DPP4 might have an inhibitory effect on the interaction between mouse DPP4 and the RBD of the S protein [6]. However, of the four amino acid residues of rat DPP4 that are different from those of human DPP4 in the RBD-contacting region, none appear to be within a potential glycosylation motif. This suggests that the glycosylation of amino acid(s) critical for contact with the S protein does not lead to potential spatial interference between MERS-CoV S and rat DPP4. It has also been speculated that the inhibitory effects of the RBD-contacting region of DPP4 are different between mouse and rat DPP4.",

The MERSpv-St16 can be used for safe, rapid, and convenient neutralization assays for laboratory diagnosis of MERS. Furthermore, using MERSpv-St16, we also demonstrated that rat DPP4 was not a functional receptor for MERS-CoV. This study provides novel information regarding the host range of MERS-CoV. A detailed structural and mutational analysis will be required to clarify how the amino acid residues of rat DPP4 prevent the binding of the MERS-CoV S protein.\n",
