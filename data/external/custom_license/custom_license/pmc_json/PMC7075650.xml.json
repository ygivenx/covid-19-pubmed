In addition,\nthe isoxazole moiety of these analogues adopted a conformation different\nfrom that of inhibitor 2 and thus undergoes hydrogen\nbonding with Gln192 in the S4 pocket. However, the conjugated ester\nwas not accessible (>4.5 \u00c5) to Cys145 to allow a Michael addition\nfor covalent bond (C\u2013S bond) formation. Consequently, this\nprocess was achieved by a subsequent strategy using pseudo-C2 symmetric analogues (6\u20139, Figure 8),50 thus exhibiting good inhibitory activity against\n3CLpro. In particular, a compound comprised of Phe\u2013Phe\ndipeptide unsaturated ester and 4-(dimethylaminocinnamic acid) (8) exhibited potent inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of approximately 1.0 \u03bcM and a Ki value of 0.52 \u03bcM. The cell-based bioassay gave an EC50 = 0.18 \u03bcM. The presence of a 4-dimethylamino moiety\non the phenyl ring of these cinnamic analogues was found to be an\nimportant structural functionality for activity enhancement.",

This result indicated that the rigid and planar phenyl\nring is not favorable for binding to the S2 hydrophobic pocket (16 and 17). A lipophilic tert-butyl group at the P3 site further enhances the binding affinity\nmore than 10-fold (17 and 18). Furthermore,\nthe benzyloxy group was found to be the best replacement moiety for\nP4-methylisoxazole, resulting in a more than 4-fold increment in enzyme\ninhibitory activity (2 and 16); this group\nwas found to be the best group for this site.

This study revealed several\nSAR trends such as a 6-chloropurine moiety, 5\u2032-hydroxy, and\nprotected (benzylated)-5\u2032-hydroxy group are responsible for\nthe potent inhibitory activity.",
