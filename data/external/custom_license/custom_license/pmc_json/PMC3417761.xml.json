The large-scale production of recombinant proteins requires significant time and effort, and the production process itself can introduce various problems that later influence the performance of these proteins in immunoassays. For these studies, large numbers of protein-coding sequences are cloned in appropriate expression vectors and then expressed in bacteria or yeast. These recombinant proteins are then isolated from lysate using affinity tags such as glutathione-S-transferase (GST), which can be purified on glutathione-affinity supports. Owing to the fact that recombinant protein extracts contain variable amounts of E. coli or other contaminants after purification, the serum samples to be tested must be preincubated with bacterial or yeast lysates to block nonspecific binding. Additional blocking agents are typically needed to decrease the background and increase the signal-to-noise ratio. Owing to the toxicity of the expressed proteins and insolubility issues, recombinant proteins generated in bacteria or yeast often show variable expression and low yields. This can result in marked differences in antigen coating efficiency, which can yield false negatives and/or miss detecting some antigens.",

From ELISA testing, approximately 100 T. pallidumproteins were targets of antibodies from T. pallidum-infected rabbits. In a follow-up study using sera from syphilis-infected patients, 900 different T. pallidum antigens were arrayed on microtiter plates and used for antibody profiling [2]. A total of 34 additional proteins were found to be antigenic in infected patients and these antibody responses varied between primary, secondary and latent syphilis infection.

Serum samples from macaques vaccinated with three different HIV multiprotein vaccines, as well as after SIV viral challenge, were analyzed. Following incubation with sera, a Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody was used to detect primary antibody binding by fluorescent scanning. The B-cell responses generated from these array data distinguished vaccinated macaques from virus-challenged macaques [4]. Immunoreactivity against several peptide epitopes also predicted survival. Interestingly, analysis of B-cell responses to these three different multiprotein vaccines revealed a convergence of immunodominant antibody responses to several linear epitopes in the envelope protein.

Felgner\u2019s group has developed a relatively simple and scalable PCR-based recombination approach to generate the necessary antigen expression vector constructs that are compatible for IVTT expression. The constructs are used to produce recombinant proteins via cell-free E. coliIVTT reactions and the unpurified, recombinant proteins are then printed on nitrocellulose arrays. Since the recombinant proteins produced in this cell-free system are generated from E. coli components that can also bind the array matrix, the sera must first be blocked with bacterial lysates before incubation with the arrays. Following array incubation with the sera, fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies are used to detect primary antibody binding. These large-scale screening experiments have identified a large number of antigenic proteins for a variety of human infectious agents, including vaccinia virus [6\u20138], Francisella tularensis[9,10], Chlamydia trachomatis[11], Plasmodium falciparum[12,13], Coxiella burnetii[14] and Burkholderia pseudomallei[15].",

One of the antigens, the H3L envelope protein, was later identified as a major target of neutralizing antibodies associated with smallpox vaccination [7]. Additional testing of sera from vaccinia infection, smallpox vaccinia vaccination (Dryvax\u00ae, the licensed smallpox vaccine) and archival convalescent smallpox sera revealed similar antibody profiles [8]. While a variety of antigenic envelope and core proteins were identified as potential targets for vaccine monitoring, analysis of the antibody signals between positive and negative antigens revealed a relatively narrow dynamic range of fluorescent intensity showing 1\u2013250-fold titer differences.

An even faster, less labor-intensive approach called transcriptionally active PCR (TAP) can also be used, in which the priming sites for the transcription machinery for IVTT are directly incorporated into the PCR primers. In one study, TAP fragments for producing recombinant P. falciparum antigens for microarray spotting were as good as the standard plasmid-cloning approach [13].

From studying 225 arrayed proteins, seven immunodominant antigens, which could be developed further for vaccine targets, were identified [11].

These global antibody-profiling studies highlight the relative antigenicity of different types of proteins and identify new antigens that could be exploited for diagnostic purposes [10]. In another study, 1300 potential antigens from ORFs from Borrelia burgdorfi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, were studied by IVTT antigen array in sera from patients with early and late disease [17].

Approximately 50 of these proteins were identified as antigenic and some may form the basis of a simple serodiagnostic immunoassay needed for this pathogen [14].

            "text": "While large amounts of information can be obtained from antigen array studies, there are several limitations. For example, some of the observed differences in antibody immunoreactivity may be due to variations in the amount of protein immobilized rather than actual serum antibody titer differences. One approach directed at improving the IVTT antigen arrays has been the development of nucleic acid programmable protein arrays (NAPPAs) [18]. In this format, recombinant proteins are also generated by IVTT, but the antigens are immobilized in situ by means of fused epitope tags. For example, C-terminal GST-tagged proteins can be captured directly on NAPPA by immobilized glutathione [19]. This approach eliminates the need to express and purify proteins separately, since they are immobilized during the IVTT reaction. This strategy eliminates potential stability issues and provides greater purity of the target antigens. If necessary, the presence of the GST moiety also allows the array to be probed with anti-GST antibodies to estimate the amounts of each protein immobilized to the array. In one NAPPA study, 262 antigens from Pseudomonas aeruginosawere produced and profiled with sera from cystic fibrosis patients and patients with acute infections [19]. From this study, 12 out of 262 outer membrane proteins of P. aeruginosawere determined to be highly antigenic targets. Immunoreactivity to other antigens on the array was also detected in the sera from healthy individuals and probably reflected antibodies directed at homologous proteins from other bacteria. In this regard, a 2760-protein array from Yersinia pestis also detected antibody cross-reactivity in rabbits immunized with several different Gram-negative bacteria [20]. Together, these findings suggest that many antigenic epitopes are shared among similar proteins from different Gram-negative bacteria and are consistent with known protein sequences for many of these bacteria. However, it is not clear if the detection of antibodies to more conformational epitopes with other immunoassay formats might better distinguish the responses to proteins from different bacteria.",

In these studies, solid-phase beads with different-colored fluorophores are used to immobilize different antigens. Following incubation with sera, a fluorescent secondary antibody is used. When the sample passes through the detector, one laser excites the fluorochrome in the bead, which exhibits a unique signal, and the other laser excites the fluorescent molecule (e.g., phycoerythrin) bound to the second antibody. Thus, antigen identity (bead fluorescence) and antibody titer (secondary antibody fluorescence) are obtained simultaneously. Approximately 100 different microspheres are available, potentially allowing multiple antigens to be detected.",

In most of these studies, the detection of multiple different pathogens is the primary goal. One intrinsic problem of Luminex is that sufficient quantities of purified antigens are needed, which must be covalently coupled to the beads. As an alternative, IVVT proteins have been used with epitope and anti-epitope tags in Luminex for immobilization and concentration [26]. In these studies, antibodies to several different Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) proteins were detected using the Luminex-based assay. However, these anti-EBV antibody signals were, at best, only fivefold above the background vector control [26]. Thus, the level of detection of anti-EBV antibody responses had a very narrow range of detection, limiting the utility of this technology for obtaining a detailed antigenic profile to understand the full range of antibody responses to this pathogen.",

Solution-phase immunoassays, such as the radiobinding assay (RBA), often show the highest sensitivity and specificity for the detection of autoantibodies in autoimmune diseases [29]. This is because RBAs can detect many more conformational epitopes than solid-phase immunoassays and are the assay of choice for detecting both low- and high-affinity antibodies to autoantigens, resulting in high sensitivity and specificity. The RBA uses radiolabeled antigen, generated typically by IVTT, in a solution-phase immunoprecipitation assay [29]. For example, RBA for a variety human pancreatic \u03b2-cell targets, including GAD65 and IA-2, are used to predict, diagnose and monitor autoantibodies in Type 1 diabetes (T1D). Of note, RBA methods for detecting autoantibodies in T1D have show high sensitivity and specificity, and to date there have been no protein arrays showing this high degree of diagnostic performance. Furthermore, RBAs also show much larger dynamic ranges in titers than solid-phase immunoassays, which makes them more useful for accurately evaluating antibody titers [30]. Unfortunately, the application of RBA has received little attention for monitoring antibodies to infectious agents mainly because it requires radioactive protein labeling. As discussed in the next section, a powerful alternative, nonradioactive solution-phase assay is luciferase immunoprecipitation systems (LIPS).",

Renillaluciferase (Ruc), derived from the sea pansy, is used for generating antigen fusions. Ruc is an ideal reporter owing to its small size (i.e., molecular weight: 30 kDa, approximately the same size as green fluorescent protein), wide linear detection range (100\u2013107 light units [LUs]) and a complete lack of antigenicity with human and other animal sera [32]. Other luciferases, including the 60-kDa firefly luciferase, have also been used in LIPS. Antigen fusions to the C-terminal of Ruc are made by cloning into the pREN2 vector [32], while the pREN3S vector generates N-terminal fusions [33]. Since better yields of luciferase-tagged proteins are often observed in pREN2-expressed antigens in comparison to those expressed in pREN3S, the pREN3S vector is usually reserved for cell surface receptors and associated proteins [33], as well as other secreted proteins [Burbelo PD, Unpublished Data]. For some secreted proteins, removal of the signal peptide and cloning of the antigen as a C-terminal fusion in pREN2 is sufficient to allow proper conformational folding and exposure of the antigenic epitopes of the target. If removal of the signal sequence and producing these antigens as C-terminal fusions result in poor antigenicity, redesigning the target as an N-terminal fusion protein in the pREN3S vector should be tested as well. For example, antibodies to detect conformational and neutralizing antibodies within the EBV gp350 extracellular protein work better when the protein is cloned into pREN3S rather than in pREN2 [33]. Once Ruc-antigen mammalian expression plasmids are generated, these constructs are transiently transfected in Cos1 or other cells (e.g., HEK 293) to produce the Ruc antigens. After 36 h of transfection, the cells are scraped in cold lysis buffer containing glycerol, cleared by centrifugation and used directly in the LIPS assay. Alternatively, these extracts can be stored frozen at -80\u00b0C where they typically remain stable for at least 6 months.",

In contrast to protein arrays, the high-throughput LIPS format detects antibodies in many different serum samples against one target in any given assay. However, because of the ease with which Ruc antigens are generated, the LIPS format is easily scalable to screen hundreds of serum samples against multiple antigens. For these studies, a master microtiter plate of serum from a particular patient cohort is first made. The master plate is then used for dispensing diluted serum samples to individual testing plates, which allows reiterative profiling of the sera [31]. Antibody profiles can be generated against 45 or more antigens, in duplicate, using 100 \u00b5l of serum per patient. Since the Ruc reporter is linear over an 8-log dynamic range, in most cases there is no need to dilute the sera further for accurately quantifying antibodies. The first step of LIPS involves incubating the serum containing the antibodies and Ruc-antigen lysate together, at room temperature, for 1 h [31]. Although rarely necessary, increased antibody binding can also be achieved by incubation at 4\u00b0C. After incubation with sera, the mixture is then transferred to microtiter filter plates containing protein A/G beads for an additional hour to capture both the free immunoglobulins and Ruc-antigen\u2013antibody complexes. For capturing antibodies, high-binding-capacity protein A/G beads (>20 mg of immunoglobulin binding per milliliter of beads) in a microtiter filter plate are used [31] and preferred over magnetic protein A/G beads because of lower cost and higher binding efficiency. While protein A/G beads efficiently immunoprecipitate IgG antibodies, they poorly detect IgA and IgM antibodies. Other immunoglobulin subtypes can also be examined using LIPS, but require specialized affinity reagents. For example, LIPS detected anti-IgG4 antibodies in sera from filarial-infected patients by coupling an anti-IgG4 secondary antibody to beads [34,35]. Further development to determine other isotype-specific antibodies and anti-IgM, IgA and IgE may be useful.",

Although manual washing and suctioning using a vacuum manifold can be performed, washing is more easily accomplished with the aid of a robotic workstation or a plate washer with vacuum filtration [31]. After filtration, the filter plate is loaded into a plate luminometer equipped with a substrate injector. Using LIPS, highly quantitative antibody titer values, reported as LUs, can be assigned to clinical and experimental serum samples. From these LIPS tests, a low LU reflects the presence of few or no antibodies, while an elevated LU reflects high antibody titers. Unlike most other immunoassays, the LIPS titer values are often compared using geometric mean titers (GMTs) because of the wide dynamic range and overdispersed nature of the LIPS data, which are typically represented on a log10 scale. Cut-offs can be determined by using the mean plus 3 or 5 standard deviations (SD) above the control group. In contrast to solid-phase assays, the diagnostic performance using either the mean plus 3 or 5 SD as cut-offs are generally identical because of the much greater analytical sensitivity of LIPS. Finally, compared with the solid-phase assays and even the solution-phase RBA, LIPS shows a greater dynamic range, reflecting a higher signal-to-noise ratio [36].",

LIPS testing of a single Ruc-antigen fusion, gG-2 from HSV-2, generated highly robust antibody titers in all the HSV-2 infected samples, which were over 1000-fold higher than HSV-1 or negative samples [37]. For example, the geometric mean of seronegative samples was 2317 LU versus 2,001,600 LU in the HSV-2-positive samples. More importantly, the anti-gG2 LIPS assay correlated perfectly with western blot analysis with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity [37]. By contrast, the anti-gG2 ELISA showed 100% sensitivity and 93% specificity.

No significant cross-immunoreactivity of anti-LlSXP-1 antibodies were observed with other filarial infections [34].

LIPS also does not require significant assay optimization to obtain high-quality antibody titer data.

Using LIPS, a larger dynamic range of antibody titers and detection of many more conformational than other immunoassays provides a high-definition antibody profile. For example, LIPS was used to generate a high-definition antibody profile against the entire proteome of HIV from HIV-infected patients [39]. A total of 17 different HIV proteins were tested and included all of the processed HIV proteins. In these chronically HIV-infected patients, robust antibody titers were detected to at least one of the 17 HIV proteins from at least one infected patient. In most cases, multiple antigen immunoreactivity was detected. Many of the antibody titers detected by LIPS against these antigens were 1000-fold higher in the HIV-infected patients compared with the uninfected subjects. The most antigenic HIV protein was gp41, which showed similar antibody titers in all HIV patients tested. As might be expected, antibodies to different protein fragments (e.g., MA, p24 and NC) of the processed GAG protein showed similar high titers in all patients tested. In addition, antibodies were also detected to several of the small nonstructural proteins, including TAT, Rev, Vpr and Vpu in some of the patients. Owing to the large dynamic range of titer values typically obtained by LIPS to HIV and other infectious agents, a \u2018flame\u2019 heatmap is typically used to graphically visualize antibody profiles to multiple antigens from different infected and control samples simultaneously. In this heatmap, antibody titers ranging from 100 to 107 LUs are graphically presented using a color palette ranging from green to red, reflecting no/low and high antibody titers, respectively [39\u201341]. From analysis of antibody responses and heatmap data, there is often marked heterogeneity in patient immunoreactivity to these large panels of antigens. Further studies are underway to use these full HIV proteome responses to substratify infected patients based on clinical symptoms, length of infection and other parameters. It is likely that these antibody profiles against all the antigens of HIV and other pathogens could yield significant insight into patient complications, prognosis, monitoring and response to therapy. Along these lines, recent LIPS profiling of HCV\u2013HIV-coinfected patients revealed anti-HCV antibody responses as biomarkers for response to therapy [42]. Finally, the relative simplicity of the LIPS technology makes it practical for small laboratories to generate antibody response profiles against infectious agents with relatively small proteomes (i.e., <100 proteins).",

Since there is a need for sensitive and specific testing to identify human herpes virus (HHV)-8/Kaposi sarcoma (KS)-associated virus-infected individuals, especially among potential blood donors, LIPS was used to identify diagnostically useful antigens [43]. A panel of 14 different HHV-8 fusion proteins, including a variety of latent and lytic antigens, were tested with serum from patients with HHV-8-associated KS. From LIPS testing, most of the HHV-8 proteins showed weak or nonexistent antibody titers with the KS sera. However, the latent HHV-8 protein, v-cyclin, was highly antigenic in approximately 80% of the KS samples. The antibody titers in the KS samples were 100\u20131000-fold higher than the uninfected controls [43]. These results contrast with a report using a number of bacterially produced GST fusions in western blotting, which were unable to detect immunoreactivity to v-cyclin [44]. The detection of diagnostically useful antibodies to v-cyclin by LIPS, but not with a bacterial recombinant protein in western blotting, supports the notion that the LIPS antigens may detect many more conformational epitopes, in part because the recombinant proteins are tested in solution under mild conditions. Particularly useful for diagnosis of HHV-8 infection was the finding that some of the positive anti-v-cyclin antibody responses were detected in sera that were determined to be negative by ELISA and/or LIPS for antibodies to other HHV-8 antigens [43]. Together, these studies demonstrate that LIPS is an effective yet simple and rapid method to screen proteins from the proteomes of infectious agents to identify diagnostically useful antigens.",

To circumvent this problem, multiple ELISAs detecting different antibodies to different antigens are run in parallel followed by data analysis. For example, the optimal serological diagnosis of HHV-8 infection by ELISA involves analyzing the results from two or three antigens [45,46]. Efforts to simplify testing in an ELISA format by coating multiple antigens to the microtiter plates are usually unsuccessful because the antigen coating efficiency is quite variable, resulting in poor diagnostic performance. Alternatively, multiepitope hybrid recombinant molecules have been employed, whereby multiple antigens or immunodominant regions are fused together in a single protein [47\u201349]. While these hybrid antigens can be highly useful, time and effort is required to design them and optimize their performance.",

The analysis of the data is also simplified in the LIPS mixture format. For example, a mixture of four antigens containing K8.1, LANA, ORF65 and v-cyclin showed 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity for detecting HHV-8 infection in KS patients [43]. LIPS antigen mixture tests have also been highly successful for diagnosing other infections. A two-antigen LIPS mixture for Strongyloides stercoralis diagnosis [35], a four-antigen LIPS mixture for onchocerciasis diagnosis [41] and a four-antigen LIPS mixture for cytomegalovirus diagnosis [40] showed higher diagnostic performance than ELISA-based tests.

In one LIPS study, antibodies against two latent and two lytic antigens were examined in three different diseases caused by the HHV-8 viruses: KS and two other lymphoproliferation disorders, multicentric Castleman\u2019s disease (MCD) and primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) [50]. One of the most obvious differences was that antibody titers against the early lytic HHV-8 antigen, K8.1, were markedly higher in the PEL and MCD patients compared with the KS patients [50]. In contrast to the anti-K8.1 antibody profile, markedly higher antibodies to v-cyclin, a latent HHV-8 gene, were found in the KS and PEL patients compared with the MCD patients. Since elevated anti-latent antibodies are a common feature found of KS patients compared with MCD, the sum of the anti-v-cyclin and anti-LANA antibodies was the most useful approach to optimally segregate KS from MCD+/KS+ and MCD+/KS-. This approach, using a set cut-off value, discriminated KS from MCD+/KS+ with 93% sensitivity and 83% specificity. These results demonstrate that LIPS provides unique inventories of clinically relevant antibody responses that likely would be missed with other technologies. In another study, LIPS was used to profile antibodies against human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection. Since a small subset (5%) of HTLV-1-infected individuals develop HTLV-1-associated adult T-cell leukemia (ATLL) or HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), antibody profiles were examined to see if these different HTLV-1 disease states could be distinguished [51]. Analysis of the antibody titer data from seven different HTLV-1 proteins revealed that the anti-GAG antibody titers were the most informative for distinguishing HTLV-infected subjects from uninfected controls, and showed 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity. However, anti-GAG antibody titers were similar between the HTLV-1 asymptomatic, ATLL and HAM/TSP subgroups [51]. By contrast, anti-Env antibody titers were over fourfold higher in HAM/TSP compared with both asymptomatic HTLV-1 (p < 0.0001) and ATLL patients (p < 0.0005). Anti-Env antibodies in asymptomatic carriers (r = 0.76) correlated well with the proviral load. Antibodies to another protein, TAX also were higher in HAM/TSP compared with the asymptomatic controls. Overall, these studies indicate that anti-HTLV-1 antibody responses detected by LIPS are useful for diagnosis and suggest that elevated anti-Env antibodies are a common feature found in HAM/TSP patients [51]. This HTLV-1 study and the HHV-8 study highlight the fact that LIPS can be employed to sensitively distinguish between different disease states caused by these and possibly other infectious agents.",

In addition, we have compared QLIPS with LIPS for detecting autoantibodies for the diagnosis of Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome, an autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation of the salivary and lacrimal glands and high levels of autoantibodies to the proteins Ro52, Ro60 and La.
