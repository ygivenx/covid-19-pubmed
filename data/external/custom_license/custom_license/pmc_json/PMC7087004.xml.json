Since October 2010, severe PEDV outbreaks have occurred in the domestic pig population in China and caused enormous economic losses [6\u20139].",

Under the pressure of herd immunity, the S gene of PEDV mutates frequently, with some of the missense mutations altering viral antigenicity to aid in the virus\u2019s escape from preexisting immunity. Thus, periodic vaccine updates may be required to ensure sufficient efficacy against emerging virus variants [28]. In the present study, our data revealed that there is little variation in the S gene among the two PEDV isolates, and that they are most similar to the attenuated DR13 strain. To further explore the role of the S gene in virulence, the JS-2/2014 strain was successively cultured, and S gene variation during cultivation was analysed. Of note, we found that there were three amino acid mutations between JS-2/2014 G5 and JS-2/2014 G20, six between JS-2/2014 G20 and JS-2/2014 G50, and five between JS-2/2014 G50 and JS-2/2014 G90. It is worth noting that the amino acid variations between JS-2/2014 G5 and JS-2/2014 G50 were also identified in the DR13 attenuation process. This finding indicates that these missense mutations in the S gene may be related to viral pathogenicity. Furthermore, animal experiments confirmed that piglets orally fed JS-2/2014 G5 (106 TCID50) had mild diarrhea and long-term excretion. On the other hand, piglets challenged with JS-2/2014 G90 (106 TCID50) appeared asymptomatic, with no virus detected in the feces and nasal fluid, indicating that G90 was attenuated and therefore is potentially safe for vaccine preparations. Moreover, recombination analysis confirmed that this strain has a high probability of being recombined with CV777 and DR13. Most recently, the CH/HNQX-3/14 strain was reported as a CV777 and DR13 strain recombinant with the highly virulent CHN/ZMDZY/11 strain. Not surprisingly, this strain was detected on a swine farm that is located in the same province as the CHN/ZMDZY/11 strain; both CV777 and DR13 PEDV vaccines were used on this farm [29]. Therefore, it is possible that the virulence-enhanced CV777 and DR13 strains had been present in some areas, resulting in virus recombination.",

Eight piglets were distributed into four groups and fed with 1mL of PBS, JS-2/2014 G20, JS-2/2014 G60, or JS-2/2014 G90, respectively. Piglets fed with JS-2/2014 G20 died within 5 days and had severe intestinal lesions, while the other piglets were alive with no lesions in their intestines (a and b). (c) Strains JS-2/2014 G60 and JS-2/2014 G90 had only a weak effect on piglet weight gain. Piglets fed with strain JS-2/2014 G90 manifested better weight gain than those fed with JS-2/2014 G60. (d) Oral immunization with JS-2/2014 G90 gave piglets high levels of IgG and IgA antibodies",
