The 1.5 h incubation time was also used to prepare samples for all surface force measurements in this study. The total protein adsorbed was determined from the change in the resonance angle and use of the 5-phase Fresnel calculation program (R. Corn, University of California, Irvine). The DC-SIGNR surface coverage was calculated from the effective refractive index of the protein monolayer neff. This value is obtained from the measured optical thickness (product of the refractive index and layer thickness, neff \u00d7 DT). This measurement and the thicknesses DT determined from surface force measurements were used to obtain the effective refractive index neff. Assuming a linear dependence of the refractive index on surface concentration, the surface coverage \u0393 (molecules/m2) of the different DC-SIGNR variants was calculated from the refractive indices and use of a refractive index increment dn/dc of 0.187, where c is the surface concentration in mg/m2.22,23 The error in protein densities determined from refractive index measurements is \u223c20%.22,23 This analysis differs slightly from that used previously (see Supporting Information).(18) The protein (tetramer) densities of the 7-repeat and 6-repeat forms are determined by dividing the monomer density by four. A similar calculation for the 5-repeat form is more complicated because it is expressed as a mixture of interconverting dimers and tetramers, with a solution dissociation constant of 0.14 \u03bcM, as determined by equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation.(11) Whether this distribution persists on the membrane, particularly under applied force, cannot be easily determined. Nevertheless, the measured jumps into contact presented here indicate the presence of folded tetramers on the membrane.",

For the 7- and 6-repeat forms of DC-SIGNR, DAdh exceeds Deq by 3.5 nm (Table 1, Figures 2B and 3A,B). This difference must result from stretching of the DC-SIGNR/Man9GlcNAc2 complex such that, upon separation, the complexes extend relative to their equilibrium thickness Deq. This may be due, in part, to the reorientation of the carbohydrate ligand. Protein flexibility, which enables the DC-SIGNR variants to jump to contact at DC < DT, would also play a role in this force-dependent stretching.",

In pairwise comparisons, a p value less than 0.05 signifies a statistically significant difference at the 95% confidence level. As noted in Figure 1, differences in the sequence of the neck repeat adjacent to the CRD in DC-SIGNR are postulated to result in the splaying apart of this repeat and the CRDs compared to DC-SIGN (Figure 1B), which would make the bound thickness of DC-SIGN slightly longer than DC-SIGNR.(17) Thus, the force\u2013distance measurements provide experimental evidence to support this model of the differences in the arrangement of the distal portion of the DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR extracellular domains (Figure 1B).",

The slopes of the curves obtained with the 6-repeat and 7-repeat forms, as well as with DC-SIGN,(18) are indicative of relatively rigid protein layers and hence relatively rigid necks (Figure 3A,B). By contrast, the force\u2013distance curve measured with the 5-repeat form at D < Deq is much shallower and does not increase steeply until D < 4\u20135 nm (Figure 3C), which is the approximate diameter of a folded CRD.(29) The force\u2013distance profile at D > 4 nm is similar to flexible polymers(30) and suggests that the neck region is unstructured in a significant population of the immobilized 5-repeat protein. The difference between the 5-repeat and other forms of DC-SIGNR and DC-SIGN is attributed to the loss of rigidity conferred by the tetramer. Tetramer dissociation into dimers could also lead to greater protein inactivation under applied force. This exception, relative to the behavior of the stable 6- and 7-repeat tetramers, provides evidence that the rigid neck region and relatively steep force profiles at D < Deq (Figure 3A,B) requires stable tetramers.",

There is no evidence of irreversible damage to the membranes due to, for example, lipid pull-out or the rupture of the NTA\u2013hexahistidine linkage. This would be evident in altered force curves measured at the same position after membrane separation, as documented previously.(31) In these studies, upon reapproach after detachment, the measured force curve, DJ, and DC were unchanged (Figure 2). When separating the surfaces, DAdh and the pull-off force were similar within experimental error, even after as many as seven successive measurements at the same contact site. The average time between successive measurements was 10\u201315 min, which is too short for damaged membranes to heal(31) but more than sufficient to allow re-equilibration, as evidenced by the reversibility of the measurements. The reversibility is expected because this is a multivalent (number of bonds = 4) interaction, and the affinity of individual monomer\u2013glycan bonds is relatively low. Leckband et al.(31) showed that lipid pull-out occurs at receptor\u2013ligand bond energies >\u223c15kT, which is much higher than the energies of the individual monomer\u2013glycan bonds.
