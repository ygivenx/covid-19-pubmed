Ultimately, the structure of tACE was determined using a minimally glycosylated, truncated construct, lacking the transmembrane domain (Natesh et al. 2003).",

The structure shows six glycosylation sites, all located on the surface of the protein. Key features of the molecule include a large central channel and an N-terminal lid. The channel stretches approximately 30 \u00c5 across almost the entirety of the molecule, effectively dividing it into two subdomains. The channel narrows at the centre, where the catalytic zinc ion is found. As shown in Fig. 2c, the N-terminal lid is formed by the three N-terminal helices; \u03b11; \u03b12 and \u03b13 and appears to prevent the enzyme from hydrolysing large, folded substrates (Natesh et al. 2003).",

Although lisinopril is bound in broadly the same conformation in both structures, minor differences, mainly concentrated in the S1\u2019 binding pocket help to explain the selectivity. For example, Asp140 in the N-domain takes the place of Glu162 in the C-domain. Glu162 forms electrostatic interactions with the lysyl side chain of lisinopril, which Asp140 is unable to replicate (Fig. 3c) (Corradi et al. 2006).",

Dup99B can induce egg laying in females, but in order to be functional the basic C-terminal dipeptide must be removed from the propeptide. In theory, this would make Dup99B a good substrate for AnCE. As yet it has not been possible to investigate this hypothesis further, as AnCE is already expressed by the female reproductive organs (Rylett et al. 2007). In order to understand any effect of AnCE on the female after mating tissue specific AnCE knockdowns in female flies would need to be performed.",

No structure has yet been determined for ACER, however in 2005 Bingham and co-workers proposed a model for the three dimensional structure of ACER based on the AnCE structure reported by Kim et al. in 2003 (Kim et al. 2003; Bingham et al. 2006). By comparing this model with the AnCE structure, some explanations have been offered as to the observed differences in substrate specificity of these two homologous enzymes.",

Both the AnoACE5 and 6 models have a phenylalanine at the position of C-domain Phe391, suggesting that they could form an interaction with an aromatic group at P2.

            "text": "Fig. 7: Features of the active sites of the AnoACE2-6 models compared to the N- and C-domains of human sACE. In all images the N-domain selective inhibitor RXP407 is shown as sticks with green carbon atoms and the C-domain selective inhibitor RXPA380 as sticks with orange carbon atoms. The catalytic zinc ion is a grey sphere. (a) The S2 subsite of AnoACE5 and 6. Key residues of AnoACE5 and 6 are shown as grey sticks using AnoACE5 numbering. The C-domain is shown as cyan sticks and the N-domain magenta. AnoACE5 and 6 share a conserved phenylalanine (Phe381) with the C-domain which is replaced by a tyrosine in the N-domain. This residue makes important contacts with the domain selective inhibitors and so suggests that AnoACE5 and 6 may share some binding preferences with the C-domain. There is also a conserved negative charge, Asp393 which is replaced by positive Arg381 in the N-domain, and a conserved valine, Val508, replaced by Thr496 in the N-domain. There is some similarity with the N-domain though, for example Ser566 which is replaced by Phe570 in the C-domain. (b) The S2 subsite of AnoACE2-4. The S2 subsites of the AnoACE2-4 models are very similar and so are represented here by AnoACE3a, shown as light orange sticks. There are some features shared with both the N- and C-domains of sACE; Tyr390 is conserved in the N-domain, but replaced by Phe391 in the C-domain, whilst Glu402 is conserved in the C-domain but replaced by the positive Arg381 in the N-domain. These residues are likely to have significant effects on substrate and inhibitor binding properties. (c) The S1 subsite of AnoACE2-6. Common features of the AnoACE2-6 models are represented by AnoACE3a in light orange, with unique features of AnoACE4 and AnoACE5 and 6 shown as violet and grey sticks respectively. The AnoACE2-6 models share a conserved tyrosine at Tyr511 which is replaced by phenylalanine in both the N- and C-domain. All of the models have a unique positively charged residue not found in the N- or C-domains, shown here by Lys71 in AnoACE4 and Arg77 in AnoACE3. AnoACE4 has a further positively charged residue, Lys133, which is replaced by neutral or negatively charged residues in the N- and C-domains and the other models. In contract AnoACE5 and 6 have an additional negative charge introduced by Glu54. These substitutions of charged residues are likely to have a significant effect on substrate and inhibitor binding properties",
