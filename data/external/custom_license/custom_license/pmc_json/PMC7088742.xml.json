            "text": "PEDV is an RNA virus belonging to the order Nidovirales, the family Coronaviridae, subfamily Coronavirinae, genus Alphacoronavirus [7]. It is an enveloped virus possessing an approximately 28 kb, positive sense, single-stranded RNA genome with a 5\u2032 cap and a 3\u2032 polyadenylated tail [8]. The genome comprised four structural proteins [spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) protein] and four nonstructural proteins (1a, 1b, 3a, and 3b). Several viral proteins are important for inducing an immune response to PEDV. The S glycoprotein of PEDV plays an important role in induction of neutralizing antibodies, specific receptor binding, and cell membrane fusion [9]. And the S glycoprotein of PEDV possessed an immunodominant region S1 plays a crucial role in the early steps of infection [10]. The M protein plays an important role in the viral assembly process [11], also can neutralize anti-M antibody in the present of complement [12], and stimulate the production of \u03b1-interferon [13]. The N protein forms a helical nucleocapsid with genomic RNA and is the predominant antigen produced in coronavirus-infected cells, thus making it a major viral target for the accurate and early diagnosis of PEDV infection [14]. At present, several PEDV vaccines have been developed [15\u201317]. However, the efficacy of the available commercial vaccines is limited or the protective immunity is insufficient [18, 19]. So, it is urgently needed to develop a high-effective, rapid-acting antiviral strategy against PEDV. RNA interference (RNAi) is a natural mechanism by which double-stranded RNA directs sequence-specific degradation of messenger RNA in eukaryotic cells [20]. The use of RNAi has been successfully applied in infection inhibition studies of human and other animal viruses in vitro and in vivo, such as SARS-CoV [21], influenza virus A [22], tick-borne encephalitis virus [23], porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus [24], and foot-and-mouth disease virus [25]. Here, we investigate whether shRNA-mediated RNAi could inhibit PEDV replication in vitro.",

After 80 % of the virus-infected cells showed cytopathic effects (CPE), the cultures were collected for three frozen-thawed cycles. Virus titration was carried out using a 96-well microplate with Vero cells. Virus cultures were 10-fold serially diluted with the virus replication medium containing trypsin (10 \u03bcg/mL). Confluent Vero cells of the microplate were washed three times with PBS and inoculated at 0.1 mL per well into five wells. Following adsorption for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C, the inocula were removed, and the cells were washed three times with PBS. Subsequently, 0.1 mL of fresh virus replication medium was transferred into each well, and the cells were further incubated for 3 days at 37 \u00b0C.

However, currently available vaccines and antiviral drugs are of limited value. Since 2010, PED had re-emerged in vaccinated swine herds, which leads to significant economic losses in swine husbandry in China [30\u201332]. RNAi is a natural cellular process mediated by small dsRNA that triggers sequence-specific gene silencing at the post-transcriptional level. RNAi can be introduced into the cells using two different approaches, exogenously introduced synthetic siRNAs or plasmid/viral vector constructs containing shRNAs. Although cells transfected with synthesized siRNAs can achieve effective silencing of a target gene, the effects are transient. The plasmid or virus vectors-based shRNAs can be cleaved by Dicer to produce siRNAs in the host cells, which can circumvent the disadvantages of chemically synthesized siRNAs using stably transfected. In terms of the fight against viral diseases, RNAi has been applied successfully to inhibit the replication of human and animal viruses using the plasmid vector constructs containing shRNAs [33\u201338]. In this study, we designed five siRNAs targeting various regions of N, M, and S genes of PEDV and corresponding shRNA expression plasmids were constructed. These plasmids were transfected into Vero cells; then the cells were infected with PEDV; finally, after incubation for 48 h, the antiviral activity of those plasmids in Vero cells was assessed by CPE, virus titers, MTS, and quantitative real-time PCR. The results demonstrated that the use of RNAi against PEDV has effectively inhibited the expression of the PEDV replication in vitro.",

It has been applied successfully to inhibit the replication of a number of viruses, such as porcine reproductive respiratory syndrome virus [39] and transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus [37] in vitro. In this study, Vero cells transfected with the above five vectors and the negative control vectors were challenged with PEDV. Through the assessments of CPE observation, MTS assay, virus titers, and quantitative real-time PCR, the results showed that the two plasmids pSilener4.1-M1 and pSilener4.1-N, which expressing the specific shRNA targeting the PEDV gene sequences, were effectively able to inhibit the replication of PEDV. They were able to prevent Vero cells from forming CPE, and could make 1000-fold decreases of virus titers detected by TCID50. Furthermore, the results of quantitative real-time PCR showed that the two plasmids could effectively inhibit the replication of PEDV by 94.4 and 94.5 %. Now, developing the economic and effective approaches to handle PEDV is an important goal for the swine industry. Currently, vaccination, improved husbandry, and breeding pigs for improved resistance are the traditional strategies. Recently, transgenic RNAi has been developed to assist in the fight against disease. Recent research involving the phenomenon of RNAi indicates that technologies which take advantage of this evolutionary conserved process can be developed to generate transgenic animals resistant to a wide variety of different infectious diseases [40, 41]. In our study, two most effective siRNAs targeting the M and N genes in the PEDV genome were selected and corresponding shRNA expression plasmids were constructed. Also, the results demonstrated that the two plasmids could clearly inhibit the replication of PEDV in Vero cells. These findings demonstrate that RNAi could reduced viral replication in vitro significantly, thus it may be good candidate for further study of PEDV infection.",
