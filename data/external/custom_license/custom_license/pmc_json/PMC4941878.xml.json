The WHO has called for research into improved assays for influenza given that HI tests, using turkey erythrocytes have been found to be relatively insensitive for measuring responses to avian H5N1 virus in humans.\n1\n Since this report was published, however, significant increases in sensitivity have been observed using horse erythrocytes.\n2\n Neutralization assays allow for more sensitive detection of H5 antibodies, but these are laborious and require Biosafety Level 3 laboratory facilities or higher which are not always available at the front line of an outbreak, especially in resource\u2010limited regions.",

The first option has its inherent problems, namely the issue of possible reversion to the wild\u2010type virus via genetic reassortment. The level of attenuation of such mutants may differ between strains/isolates and careful risk assessment is required.\n3\n With the pseudotype system, however, only the HA from influenza is required, with no possibility of recombination or virus escape. These particles undergo abortive replication and do not give rise to replication\u2010competent progeny. Retroviral and lentiviral pseudotypes have been used in lieu of replication\u2010competent virus to study neutralizing antibody responses to viral infection.\n5\n, \n6\n, \n7\n These pseudotypes encode reporter genes and bear foreign viral envelopes of interest.\n8\n The transfer of marker genes to target cells depends on the function of the envelope protein; therefore, the titer of neutralizing antibodies against the envelope can be measured by a reduction in marker gene transfer.",

When comparing the correlations between MLV(HA) versus HI (r\n2 = 0.93), MLV(HA) versus MN (r\n2 = 0.78) and HI versus MN, however, it should be noted that MN will also measure neutralizing responses against other envelope glycoproteins, namely NA, in contrast to the pseudotype assay and the HI assay which only measure responses against the HA component. This factor may explain why we obtained higher r\n2 values for correlations between MLV(HA) and HI assays than between MLV(HA) and MN assays for the human, ferret and chicken data (Figure 2b).

However, with the MLV(HA) assay which is based on Viet Nam/1194/2004 HA, a neutralizing antibody titer of 1600 was obtained (Table 2). Similarly, serum from a patient who had recovered from infection, by a 1997 HK H5N1 virus also had a strong neutralizing antibody titer as measured by MLV(HA) (800 versus a MN titer of 80) (Table 1). Also, sera from chickens that had been immunized with a variety of avian H5 viruses (isolated between 1959 and 2005) showed the presence of high levels of neutralizing antibodies to the recent A/Viet Nam/1194/2004 virus in the MLV(HA) assay (Table 3). Antisera to an avian H5N1 strain isolated in 1959 could neutralize the VN1194 pseudotype at high titer. Only chickens immunized with A/TKY/ONT/7732/66 (H5N9) did not produce high neutralizing antibody titers against the VN1194 HA. These data suggest that the MLV(HA) assay may be detecting cross\u2010neutralizing activity.
