The French hospital information system, Programme de M\u00e9dicalisation du Syst\u00e8me d\u2019Information (PMSI), is a managerial tool based on the systematic collection of standardized administrative and medical information for any new hospital admission. An estimated 95% of all public and private hospitals use this tool, including all third-level structures, i.e., university hospitals and other reference hospitals (21). An anonymous extraction of the dataset with limited sociodemographic information (age, sex, and residence area) can be made available for specific epidemiologic studies. Medical information includes the main cause of admission (principal diagnosis), the related medical conditions (with >20 entries for various associated diagnoses), duration of stay, modes of admission and discharge, and major medical activities performed during the stay. Diseases are coded according to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10). This coding system was stable during the study period. Conversely, the codes for medical or surgical procedures, determined at the national level, have evolved over time, with notable changes occurring in 2003.",

To take into consideration patients with >1 underlying condition, we introduced a hierarchy. We first created the bone marrow transplantation (BMT) category, which included autologous and allogenic BMT, with or without graft versus host disease. To reduce underreporting bias, we looked for BMT occurrence in both incident and readmitted patients. Because of changes in the coding system regarding medical procedures, identification of autologous versus allogenic BMTs before 2003 was not possible. In a second category labeled hematologic malignancies, we included neutropenia or aplastic anemia, acute lymphoid or myeloid leukemia, lymphomas, and other disorders of the myeloid system. The third category, labeled nonhematologic immunodepression, included solid organ cancers, HIV infection, solid organ transplantations, and/or rejection of these transplantations. By convention, BMT patients (with or without graft versus host disease) who also had a neutropenia were classified under the BMT category. Finally, we analyzed diabetes types 1 or 2 patients under a separate category; for patients who had both an immunosuppressive condition and diabetes, the immunosuppressive condition was kept as the main risk factor.",

This network, which covers all university and other tertiary level hospitals in France, reported an average of 17 cases per year since 2003 versus 65 in our study for the same period. These differences could have several nonexclusive reasons. First, diagnosing zygomycosis is not easy. As recently underlined (25), a culture positive with a zygomycete does not always mean infection; many gastrointestinal cases reported in the PMSI may be false-positive cases resulting from laboratory contamination. The unusual distribution of clinical presentations found in our study and the fact that one third of clinical information was missing favor this hypothesis.

(27), who compared administrative data with medical records in the United States, the positive predictive value of ICD-10 codes for detecting invasive aspergillosis can be low. The authors stressed that these codes may sometimes be assigned before final diagnosis is confirmed, or they may not be assigned by the clinician in charge of the patient. These considerations are also true in the PMSI: overreporting was estimated at 11% for cancers of the thyroid in a study based in 10 districts (28) and at 15% for mesothelioma (29). Inversely, underreporting caused by diagnostic or coding errors was estimated at 17% by Hafdi-Nejjari et al. (30) and at 27% by Carr\u00e9 et al. (28), respectively. Nevertheless, administrative data are useful tools to estimate the trends of severe infections like zygomycosis, since most patients are likely to be hospitalized (26,31), especially in the tertiary care centers that participate in the PMSI.",

In this population, increases in the number of recorded cases could be linked to frequent prescription of antifungal drugs lacking activity against zygomycetes, such as voriconazole and caspofungin (10,17,18,33\u201335). However, the role of previous exposure to these antifungal drugs does not appear exclusive because the incidence also increased in the population of patients with diabetes mellitus, a population not known to be commonly exposed to long-term antifungal therapies. An increasing number of the populations at risk (increasing incidence or prolonged survival times) could explain the increase observed in our study: +24% per year for patients with hematologic malignancies and +15% for BMT patients, respectively. However, data from the national agency in charge of the surveillance of transplantations (36) indicate that the number of hematopoietic stem cell transplantations increased by +1.58% per year (p<0.01) 2001\u20132006. Similarly, we documented a +9% per year increase in zygomycosis in patients with diabetes; in parallel, diabetes prevalence increased at an estimated 5.7%/year in France from 2000 through 2005 (37). We thus tend to consider that the observed trends reflect a genuine increase of zygomycosis cases in these at-risk populations.",

However, age distributions and underlying conditions are likely to differ between places and to evolve over time, thus not allowing strict comparisons. Another limitation of the PMSI is the absence of information regarding the circumstances of exposure and portal of entry. The highest incidence rates found in 5 rural districts and not in others of comparable age and gender distributions may indicate a particular exposure to molds in rural environments (for instance, a professional exposure) or an increased awareness of these diseases among clinicians and microbiologists/mycologists of the corresponding regions.",

Nevertheless, the CFRs for patients with severe immunosuppressive conditions (Table) are close to values reported in the literature. The CFRs in our study are population-based, while reports from the literature mostly refer to large but relatively old series or to series of immunocompromised patients with severe underlying diseases whose outcome is expected to be worse than in the nonimmunocompromised general population (8,32,38). Also, the CFRs in these other studies may include the long-term outcomes for more discrete time frames, for example, 1 year survival rates (32), information not available through our type of study. Deaths occurring during hospitalization are not systematically reported in the PMSI, and those occurring outside the hospital may be underdiagnosed in the CepiDc because many practitioners are not aware of zygomycosis. False-positive cases (for instance, zygomycetes culture without infection) can also influence CFR calculations by increasing the denominator. The wide range of CFR estimates calculated with the capture\u2013recapture method reflects these uncertainties.",

It stresses the growing frequency of this severe infection and the need to increase awareness among clinicians of early diagnosis and treatment, especially for patients with hematologic malignancies, BMT, and/or diabetes. As stated by Chang et al. (27), administrative data can be regarded as useful screening tools that should be completed by medical record investigation. In fact, our study has represented an opportunity to launch in 2008 a retrospective study of zygomycosis cases identified through the PMSI and the NRCMA.
