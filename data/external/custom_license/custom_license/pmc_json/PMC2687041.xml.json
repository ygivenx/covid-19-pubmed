Patient location was determined by forward sortation address (i.e., first 3 digits of postal code) and health unit code in the NACRS database and by specific reporting hospital in the EDSS data set. Weekly Telehealth Ontario counts of respiratory disease based on guidelines were also obtained. We categorized Telehealth Ontario calls into episodes of upper or lower respiratory disease on the basis of a priori classification schemes verified by other research (6,11\u201313). Telehealth Ontario calls were geolocated by forward sortation address. All data were compiled into weekly totals (Sunday\u2013Saturday) from each of the 3 nonidentifiable data sets.",

Analysis comparing the EDSS respiratory CCs with the Telehealth Ontario calls about respiratory disease (Figure) resulted in a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.91, indicating good correlation. Analysis comparing the EDSS respiratory CC to all NACRS respiratory disease diagnoses resulted in a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.98, indicating very good correlation.

These potential benefits cannot be tested because no large-scale outbreaks have occurred since the inception of our real-time syndromic surveillance system. Protocols of many pandemic-preparedness plans include monitoring of real-time systems. When a pandemic occurs, syndromic surveillance may be able to help healthcare workers recognize a potential outbreak, which theoretically could help them mitigate effects on society earlier. Our study demonstrates that in southeastern Ontario, ED CCs accurately reflect respiratory conditions of patients in the area. The correlations found strongly suggest that EDSS accurately monitors respiratory disease in the community and contributes to early detection of respiratory disease outbreaks. We continue to monitor the system from day to day and have increased the number of reporting hospitals to 9. Future studies will use laboratory data to assess the value of advanced warning on a number of syndromes captured in our system.",
