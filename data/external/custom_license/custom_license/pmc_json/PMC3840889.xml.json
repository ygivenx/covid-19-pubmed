The etiologic agent, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus (family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales). The viral disease was discovered in the United Kingdom in 1971 and subsequently reported in many swine-producing countries in Europe and Asia (1,2). Although most sow herds previously had received CV777-based inactivated vaccine, a large-scale outbreak of PED has been associated with high rates of illness and death in suckling piglets in China since late 2010, resulting in substantial economic losses.",

S protein identity among the 3 new isolates was 99.4%\u201399.6% and shared 93.6%\u201393.7% identity with classical CV777 strain. We identified numerous sequence variations in S protein of the 3 isolates (Technical Appendix Table). Two separate insertions were discovered: a 1-aa (N) insertion at position 140 and a 4-aa (QGVN) insertion at positions 59\u201362. A 2-aa (NI) deletion was identified at positions 163\u2013164. A total of 34 separate substitutions were identified, and the number(s) of replaced amino acids ranged from 1 through 5.

The YS and ZB isolates were highly virulent in piglets. Unlike CV777, the PEDV variants remained almost unchanged in the epitope at positions 499\u2013638; however, a 2-aa deletion, a 1-aa insertion, and 18 separate substitutions were identified in the epitope at positions 83\u2013276 (7,8). These variations of amino acid sequences probably changed the immunogenicity of S protein and led to immunization failure of current commercial vaccines made from classical PEDV strains. However, how PEDV has evolved and varies in pig herds are not clear. Further studies, including extensive genomic sequence analyses and serologic cross-neutralization tests, should be conducted.",
