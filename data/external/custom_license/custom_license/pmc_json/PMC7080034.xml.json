            "text": "\nSalmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovars Typhi and Typhimurium are important human pathogens with distinctly different lifestyles (Barquist et al. 2013). Salmonella species cause typhoid fever and gastroenteritis in humans and pose a global threat to human health (Valdez et al. 2009). This potentially fatal systemic illness affects at least 21 million people annually, primarily in developing countries (Barquist et al. 2013; Bhutta and Threlfall 2009; Kothari et al. 2008). Salmonella also infects a broad array of animals, resulting in diseases ranging from gastroenteritis to life-threatening systemic infections (Chiu et al. 2004; McClelland et al. 2001). The outer membrane protein (OMP) from Gram-negative bacteria (Salmonella Typhi) is a major immunogenic target to synovial fluid lymphocytes of patients with reactive arthritis (ReA)/undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy (uSpA) (Pocanschi et al. 2013).",

Proteins are usually unfolded by chemical and physical treatments, which lead to alterations on their conformations (Dobson 2003; Fersht and Daggett 2002). One of the common methods of denaturing proteins is heating. Reports on conformational state of the denatured proteins have varied from apparently fully unfolded to substantial remaining structure (Goto et al. 1990). Unfolding caused by structural changes of proteins significantly influences their functional properties and results in pathological consequences in organisms (Lauren et al. 2009; Selkoe 2003; Tsigelny et al. 2008).",

As there is not any high resolved full-length structure of OMP from Salmonella Typhi in the Protein Data Bank, the protein was modeled by Phyre2 (Kelley and Sternberg 2009) by using the sequence as given in Supplementary Figure S1. For such a large intact protein, part of the structure was generated based on the remote homology/fold recognition approach by taking the template of Dnad from Bacillus subtilis (2 V79), whereas the rest 366 residues were built by ab initio method. Predicted 3D models were verified by PROCHECK (Laskowski et al. 1993), and validation of stereo-chemical quality of the model was performed through ERRAT, PDBSUM, and Verify3D. The structure was visualized by PyMol version 0.99 (DeLano 2002). Most proteins, however, possess multiple Trp residues, and the overall protein emission, naturally, yields only average information on the protein structure. OMP is a multitryptophan-containing protein (Trp88, 138, 176, 324, and 366). Trp88 is located at the central part of helix 1 region. Trp138 is located at the large N-terminal helix (Fig. 1). The even distributions of the five Trp in OMP make Trp fluorescence an excellent probe for monitoring the structural changes of the protein. Analysis of the accessible surface area of these Trp by the InterProSurf (Negi et al. 2007) indicates the following accessibility order: Trp176 > Trp366 > Trp38 > Trp324 > Trp88. Out of the total accessible surface area (29,413 \u00c52) of the OMP, apolar residues contribute in greater extent (19,761 \u00c52) than the polar residues (9,651 \u00c52). Supplementary Figure S2 demonstrated the distribution of OMP amino acid residues. In Supplementary Figure S3, Ramachandran plot analysis showed that 67.5 % of all residues are located in the most favored regions, 22.6 % are in additionally allowed regions, 4.4 % residues fell in generously allowed regions, and 5.5 % are in disallowed regions (Table S1 Supplementary information).\n",

The far-UV CD spectra of OMP were recorded over the pH range 1.0\u20137.0 to investigate the influence of pH on protein structure as shown in Fig. 2a. OMP at pH 7.0 exhibited the well characteristic spectra of \u03b1-helical proteins (minima at 222 and 208 nm) as shown in Fig. 2a. The secondary structural contents estimated from the Chen et al. method (Eq. 2) are tabulated in Table 1. Figure 2b shows the percent loss of \u03b1-helical structures for OMP as pH changes from 7.0 to 1.0. The average helical contents of OMP remained equal up to pH 5.0. At pH 7.0, the OMP shows higher helicity (35 %) as compared to the OMP at acidic pH. There is a steady decrease in helicity values for pH 6.0 (33 %), pH 5.0 (32 %), and pH 2.0 (26 %). This suggests that neutral pH has a greater secondary structural integrity and stability as compared to the acid ones. However, at very low pH 2.0, all the proteins got unfolded by losing their native secondary structure. Further, the \u03b8\n208/\u03b8\n222 ratio for the OMP appears nearly identical from pH 7.0 to 2.0, which is between 0.92 and 0.95 (Table 1). The ratio of \u03b8\n208/\u03b8\n222 possibly depends on structural packing of proteins. It varies from 0.8 to 5.0 for the native proteins, while it ranges only from 1.1 to 1.4 for the molten globule (MG) state. The obtained values of \u03b8\n208/\u03b8\n222 ratio for pH 2.0 are within the reported range for various proteins (Vassilenko and Uversky 2002).\n\n",

The microenvironmental modifications of OMP aromatic residues due to denaturation by pH were studied by monitoring the changes in the fluorescence spectra as a function of pH. In proteins, Trp is highly sensitive to the polarity of its surrounding environment, and OMP is a muti-Trp-containing protein. The native protein showed an emission maximum at 340 nm suggesting the solvent exposure of some of the Trp residues is in the hydrophobic core of the protein at native condition (Fig. 3a). At pH 2.0, FI was reduced to 53 % along with a red shift of 10 nm indicating that Trp microenvironment became polar. Probably the structural perturbation (as observed in CD results) has fetched some of the Trp residues in a polar environment resulting in formation of a partially unfolded state at pH 2.0. Progressive lowering of pH led to rise in \u03bb\nmax (wavelength maxima). The \u03bb\nmax for 6.0 M GuHCl denatured state was red shifted to 355 nm with concomitant decrease in FI indicating that Trp residues are maximally exposed to the solvent. Figure 3b summarizes pH-dependent changes in FI and \u03bb\nmax of OMP. A significant decline in FI and increase in \u03bb\nmax was noticed between pH 7.0 and pH 2.0. As pH was lowered further from pH 2.0, the FI at 340 nm began to increase, crossing a value of 30 at pH 1.0 and finally reaching 32 at pH 1.0 with simultaneous increase in \u03bb\nmax. These observations suggest that protein conformation under acidic conditions is different from native and 6.0 M GuHCl denatured state. This means that tryptophan fluorescence maxima are dependent on the hydrophobicity of the surrounding environment.\n",

The folding and unfolding stages of the protein passing through various intermediates can thus be captured by ANS fluorescence experiments (Varshney et al. 2010). Here, we study the pH-induced structural changes in OMP by ANS fluorescence spectroscopy. The ANS emission maximum was recorded at 495 nm for native OMP at pH 7.0. This proves that native OMP has a compact structure with less hydrophobic surfaces exposed for ANS binding. However, at pH 2.0, the ANS emission maximum got shifted to 485 nm indicating greater solvent exposure of the hydrophobic patches of OMP as compared to native OMP (Fig. 4a). The fluorescence intensity of the ANS spectrum of OMP is at 480 nm as shown in Fig. 4b. This proves that during acid denaturation, some of the solvent-exposed hydrophobic patches of OMP become inaccessible. The ANS binding to OMP increases with a drop in pH values from 7.0 to 2.0, which reveals greater solvent exposure of hydrophobic patches. However, below pH 2.0, the effect gets suddenly reversed showing decreased fluorescence intensity. Thus, less hydrophobic regions of OMP are now being exposed to solvent. At pH 2.0, OMP possibly attains an intermediate state with the maximum fluorescence intensity and a large solvent-exposed hydrophobic region. At pH 7.0, there was less ANS binding as a consequence of the disordered or unfolded structure.\n",

The slope (K\nsv) of such plots is related to the degree of exposure (accessibility) of the tryptophans. Table 2 shows the quenching parameters obtained by analyzing the Stern\u2013Volmer plots. The Stern\u2013Volmer constant (K\nsv) for the native OMP was found to be 8.3 M\u22121. However, the value of K\nsv for the molten globule state is 12 M\u22121. The Stern\u2013Volmer plot indicates that the aromatic amino acids at pH 2.0 are more exposed compared to the native folded conformation at pH 7.0; therefore, tryptophan fluorescence is quenched more in the case of the former. For the fully denatured protein in 6.0 M GuHCl, the K\nsv value becomes quite large, being 16 M\u22121, respectively, indicating a large increase in solvent exposure of tryptophan residues.\n\n",

It has been observed that R\nh values of native OMP at pH 7.0 are 4.1 nm. The DLS results indicated a markedly reduced R\nh, suggesting that the major component of OMP may consist of monomer. In contrast, OMP prepared in pH 2.0 exhibits a much larger size (12.2 nm) and a significantly higher percent polydispersity. The results indicated that the effect of pH may reflect some type of conformational changes upon lowering the pH favors self-association of OMP. Maximum R\nh (23.8 nm) was observed for 6.0 M GuHCl denatured state indicating the existence of a remarkably unfolded and expanded conformation. A similar pattern was observed in apparent molecular weight for pH-induced unfolding of OMP (Table 3), while hydrodynamic radii and translational diffusion coefficient (D\nW25 \u00b0 C), which describes the property of molecules in solution phase, are inversely associated to each other. As a result, the values for D\nW25 \u00b0 C followed the opposite pattern with respect to R\nh (Fig. 5b).

The temperature at midpoint of temperature (T\nm) was determined by fitting the temperature dependence of ellipticity into a two-state folding\u2013unfolding reaction mechanism model. Most of the proteins are characterized by well-defined three-dimensional structures, which in general exist only within the limits of specific environmental conditions. Outside these conditions, proteins exhibit denatured and structurally unfolded states. Ellipticity plots, at 222 nm, are shown, as a function of temperature, together with the two-state model fits (Eq. 5). The thermal stability curve of OMP at pH 7.0 and pH 2.0 shows that the greatest thermal stability is observed near neutral pH. This result indicates cooperativity at pH 7.0 and absence of cooperativity as expected for a non-compact structure at pH 2.0. At pH 7.0, the secondary structure of OMP was found to be unperturbed up to 50 \u00b0C (Fig. 6a). At pH 7.0, the curve shows a single-phase transition having estimated T\nm of 69 \u00b0C. OMP at pH 2.0 appears to be less stable than the native OMP with a melting temperature (T\nm) of ~40 \u00b0C. These results suggest that ordered and more stable secondary occurs at neutral pH, while at pH 2.0, OMP becomes disordered and thermally less stable. Therefore, this considers that the classical acid-induced molten globule state of OMP exists at pH 2.0.\n",

Figure 6b shows the GuHCl and urea unfolding curves, monitored using far-UV CD spectroscopy, and can be fitted by a two-state model using Eq. 5. Inspection of the individual curves yields denaturant concentrations at the midpoint of the transitions, C\nm, of 1.0 M for the GuHCl. The further addition of GuHCl up to 2.0 M led to the complete disruption of structure of native OMP (pH 7.0). Likewise, midpoint denaturant concentrations (C\nm) of 3.1 M urea were found for OMP (Table 4). Further addition of GuHCl to 3.1 M led to the loss of structure (Fig. 6b) as the MRE222 nm completely disappeared. OMP is quite stable in the presence of 1.5 M urea than the GuHCl 0.5 M since the MRE222 nm signal of the OMP is essentially distinguishable and very different from that of unfolded protein under folded conditions. The chemical denaturant urea is highly cooperative in the change of secondary structure.\n",

The spectrum is determined mainly by the polarity of the environment of the tryptophan and tyrosine residues and by their specific interactions (Royer 2006). In this regard, the changes in both fluorescence wavelength and intensity were used to calculate the thermodynamic parameters of the unfolding process. The GuHCl-induced equilibrium unfolding transition of OMP was studied by intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy (Fig. 6b). Denaturation of OMP was monitored by measurement of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of the GuHCl-treated samples. The GuHCl and urea induced breakdown of the native tertiary structure (FI340 nm). The stability of the OMP suggests the significant differences between the dependencies of the free energy of unfolding upon denaturant. The corresponding values in the absence of denaturant (\u0394G\nu\no) were 2.5 and 6.2 kcal mol\u22121 for GuHCl and urea, respectively. The \u201cm values\u201d were very dissimilar at pH 7.0 for GuHCl and urea (2.7 and 1.9 kcal mol\u22121 M\u22121), which suggests that almost the same states are involved in the unfolding transition. The C\nm values under identical conditions were 0.95 and 3.2 M for GuHCl and urea, respectively, at pH 7.0 (Table 4). The differences in obtained results clearly show that GuHCl acts as a stronger denaturant than urea.

Exploring the structure and dynamics of intermediates of folding pathway is necessary not only to understand the mechanism of the protein folding but also to shed light on many natural or disease-related processes and biotechnological applications. Therefore, unfolding behavior and kinetics were studied for OMP as a model for bacterial protein. In the far-UV CD region, native OMP revealed two well-resolved negative peaks at 208 and 222 nm. The CD signals at 222 nm were more prominent, indicating high level of structural integrity of the protein. Significantly larger changes were observed in the CD spectra recorded at pH 2.0, suggesting the occurrence of a pH-induced unfolding transition in this pH range. The OMP loses all of its secondary structural integrity around 2 M GuHCl or 4 M urea, as it is evident by complete disappearance of all the characteristic peaks in far-UV CD spectra measurements. In principle, unfolded states are rather heterogeneous, and the mechanisms leading to unfolded states are rather different for thermal, pH, or GuHCl and urea-induced unfolding (Ahmad et al. 2011).",

For example, more compact structures of the acid unfolded states as compared to chemical unfolded states would also explain more exposed tryptophan residues which exhibit greater red shifts. OMP demonstrates environment-dependent variation in unfolding pathways (Fig. 6b). Chemical-induced denaturation leads to complete unfolding of the protein.

            "text": "\nSalmonella Typhi is a pathogenic bacterium that causes a number of infectious diseases such as gastroenteritis and typhoid fever (Kaur and Jain 2012). Before orally ingested enteric pathogens Salmonella can reach their target host cells, they must first survive their encounter with the low pH of the human stomach, approximately pH 2.0 following a fast. The low pH of the gastric environment provides Salmonella Typhi the ability to survive at low pH. This is an extremely hostile environment, thus Salmonella contains multiple inducible systems to aid in survival at low pH (Brenneman et al. 2013; Kaur and Jain 2012). Enteric pathogens, in order to gain entrance into the intestine and cause disease, must survive the acid pH of the stomach. Pathogenic species that prefer to grow at neutral pH exhibit widely varying abilities to survive pH extremes. However, there is increasing evidence that molten globules are common and that they play a key role in a wide variety of physiological processes, including translocation across membranes, increased affinity for membranes, binding to liposome and phospholipids, protein trafficking, extracellular secretion, and the control and regulation of the cell cycle (Morrow et al. 2002). Structural stability can also be seen in Diphtheria toxin T and SARS-CoV main protease, while other proteins, such as human alkaline phosphatase, human apolipoprotein E, and malic enzyme, have been shown to undergo a significant molten globule transition state during the unfolding process (Chang et al. 2007; Hung and Chang 2001; Morrow et al. 2002; Rodnin et al. 2008). In addition, the development of methods to fold integral membrane proteins to their active form is of significant technological importance.",
