            "text": "Ketoprofen (Ket) is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with pronounced analgesic and antipyretic properties. Numerous ketoprofen derivatives have been synthesized in order to minimize side-effects, prolong plasma half-life and increase solubility (Bonina et al.,\n2002a, b, 2003). Some amides have proved to be useful prodrugs, while the others possess anti-inflammatory activity independent of the parent compound. It has been demonstrated that amidation of NSAIDs improves selectivity towards COX-2 (Kalgutkar et al.,\n2000), while modification of the carboxylic group to hydroxamic acid leads to inhibition of both cyclooxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase, two enzymes crucial in inflammatory processes (Flynn et al.,\n1990; Muri et al.,\n2002). Glycine amides of ketoprofen and several other well-known NSAIDs are significantly less irritating to gastric mucosa, while their anti-inflammatory activities are comparable to their parent drugs (Shanbhag et al.,\n1992; Singh et al.,\n1990). Ketoprofen glycinate methyl ester has higher anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity than the parent drug (Dhaneshwar and Chaturvedi, 1994). Ketoprofenamides with heterocyclic residues (2-thiazolinyl, 4-methylpyridyl, 3-hydroxypyridyl, pyridyl, 1,5-dimethyl-2-phenylpyrazolonyl or thiazolyl) also possess significant analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities (Spickett et al.,\n1976), while ketoprofen 2-hydroxyethylamide and ketoprofen esters with bis-(hydroxyalkylthio)-alkanes are useful in the treatment and prevention of atherosclerosis (Lafon, 1977). Numerous studies suggest that NSAIDs are promising anticancer drugs as well and may be associated with reduced risk of colon, lung, liver and other types of cancers (Thun et al.,\n2002; Sivak-Sears et al.,\n2004).",

Minor amount of product 3a was detected as well, even if the reaction was performed with the excess of chloride 1. The reaction was run at room temperature in order to avoid benzotriazolide 3a polycondensation.\n",

Lipoxygenases oxidize certain fatty acids at specific positions to hydroperoxides, precursors of leukotrienes, which contain a conjugated triene structure, i.e. soybean lipoxygenase converts linoleic to 13-hydroperoxylinoleic acid. Leukotrienes play an important role as mediators of a variety of inflammatory and allergic processes (K\u00fchn et al.,\n1990). Inhibitors of LOX have attracted attention initially as potential agents for the treatment of inflammatory and allergic diseases but their therapeutic potential has now been expanded to certain types of cancer and cardiovascular diseases (Pontiki and Hadjipavlou-Litina, 2005). Most of the LOX inhibitors are antioxidants or free radical scavengers, since lipoxygenation occurs via a carbon-centred radical (Muller, 1994). Perusal of IC50 values shows that compound 3b is the most active by far, followed by compounds 4g, 4d and 4f (IC50 = 21\u201395 \u03bcM). From Table 2 it is obvious that aromatic and cycloalkyl derivatives 4g, 4d and 4f are more potent lipoxygenase inhibitors than the other amidocarbamates.",

            "text": "Antiviral evaluation was performed on a broad series of DNA and RNA viruses (as listed under the \u201cExperimental\u201d section). No antiviral effects were noted for any of the tested compounds against any of the viruses evaluated at subtoxic compound concentrations (data not shown). Only 4g showed minor antiviral activity against vesicular stomatitis virus in HeLa cell cultures (EC50: 3 \u03bcM), Sindbis virus (EC50: 11 \u03bcM) and Punta Toro virus in Vero cell cultures (EC50: 11 \u03bcM). However, the activity was found at compound concentrations close to their cytostatic activities (CC50: 2.7\u201314 \u03bcM) (Table 3), pointing to a toxic rather than a specific antiviral effect. The compounds have also been evaluated for their cytostatic activity against murine leukaemia L1210, murine mammary carcinoma FM3A and human T-lymphoblast CEM cell cultures. The 50% inhibitory concentrations of the test compounds ranked between 2.7 and 422 \u03bcM depending on the nature of the compound and the tumour cell line evaluated (Table 3). The majority of the compounds show IC50 values around 10\u201325 \u03bcM (i.e. 4c, 4d, 4e, 4f, 4g, 4h and 4j), pointing to a relatively minor role of the R-substituents on the core structure for cytostatic activity, as long as a bulky lipophilic (cyclic) entity has been present. Also, the presence of the amide groups might play an important role to eventually exert cytostatic potential.\n",
