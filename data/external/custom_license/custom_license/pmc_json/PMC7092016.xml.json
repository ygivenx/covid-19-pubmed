            "text": "Pain management for laboratory rodents often requires repeated restraint of the animals and injection of analgesic drugs at intervals of 6\u20138 h, which can cause stress1 and potential injury. Analgesics that have longer durations of activity2 can allow investigators to manage pain in laboratory animals with a single dose of drug, minimizing potential stress and injury. This is a goal of long-acting opiate therapy. Previous research has established the efficacy of opiates such as buprenorphine in animals3,4,5. Buprenorphine has a high therapeutic index and a 35-year history of safe use in veterinary medicine6,7. Moreover, because opiates are a front-line therapy for pain management in humans, their use in laboratory animals comports with the objective of harmonizing pharmacology between laboratory models and human diseases8. Despite these advantages, opiate analgesia is rarely used with laboratory animals for various reasons9, including its potential to cause adverse effects. Reported adverse effects of opiate therapy include weight loss10,11,12, nausea13,14,15,16 and dermal lesions at drug injection sites17,18,19,20,21,22.",

We aimed to determine whether an extended-release cholesterol\u2013buprenorphine suspension could be used safely in rats. When designing safety studies for veterinary pharmaceutical products, the US Food and Drug Administration advises investigators to follow guidance for target animal safety (TAS) studies24,25. This guidance indicates that TAS studies should include clinical observations for pain and distress as well as complete clinical pathology and histopathology examinations24,25. European regulatory authorities use similar guidelines to determine the effects of drugs on major organ systems in target animal species26. In TAS studies, animals are often challenged by administration of two- to ten-fold overdoses of the drug of interest in order to expose weak drug detoxification systems, potential risks in animal models of disease, and potential outcomes of accidental overdoses in the real world.",

The weight of each rat was within 10% of the mean weight of its group. At the start of the test the mean body weight of all females was approximately 130 g. The mean body weight of all males was approximately 180 g, with the exception of one heavier group that weighed a mean body weight of approximately 195 g. Rats were tagged with unique ear tags (Kent Scientific, Torrington, CT) for identification and were housed in groups of two or three with cagemates of the same sex that were assigned to the same experimental group. Rats were housed in individually ventilated cages (Innovive, San Diego, CA) during the quarantine period and were housed individually in the same type of cage during the study period. Rats were provided with soft fiber bedding (Carefresh Natural, Ferndale, WA), ad libitum access to drinking water (from municipal sources) in disposable water bottles (Aquavive Rat 850 mL, Innovive, San Diego, CA) and ad libitum access to Certified Global Rodent Diet 2016C (Harlan TEKLAD, Indianapolis, IN).

We then shaved the scapular region (between the shoulder blades), washed it with ethanol and painted it with povidone-iodine solution. We transferred the rat to a clean procedural area and assessed the depth of anesthesia by pinching the toe. Failure to respond to the toe pinch indicated that the rat had reached a surgical plane of anesthesia. Once this had occurred, we visually assessed and documented the rat's respiratory rate and capillary fill rate after pinching a toenail. We used clean, sterilized forceps to gently grasp the skin, and clean, sterilized scissors to make a 4- to 5-mm incision at the scapular region through the skin without penetrating the muscle or bone. We then used the scissors to separate the skin and create a subcutaneous pocket measuring approximately 2 cm \u00d7 4 cm. We apposed the edges of the incision and stapled them closed using a 9-mm Autoclip (Kent Scientific, Torrington, CT).

A similar absence of weight loss was also reported in rats that received 1.2 mg buprenorphine per kg body weight in a polymer formulation19,28. These results contrast with previous reports of significant weight loss after post-surgical oral and subcutaneous administration of buprenorphine10,11,12. Weight loss in some cases was associated with gastric distress and pica (consumption of non-nutritive substances)10,11. Pica occurs in response to nausea induced by opiate therapy3,10 and has been reported in Sprague-Dawley13,16, Long-Evans15, Wistar14 and Dark Agouti rats12. Pica is a complex phenomenon that might be beneficial in some circumstances. Consumption of kaolin (a behavior indicative of pica) after treatment with a nausea-inducing compound was correlated with less weight loss and greater food consumption in rats29. Pica can also have dangerous consequences, however. Previously in our laboratory, 1 of 15 male Fischer 344 rats was found dead on day 3 of a pilot study after it was treated with a single dose of 1.3 mg buprenorphine per kg body weight. Upon necropsy, the stomach and esophagus of the rat were noted to be compacted with hardwood bedding. This is consistent with a previous report that Sprague-Dawley rats consumed hardwood bedding and experienced gastric distention after treatment with buprenorphine16. In another study in which rats were housed on corncob bedding, pica-related mortality was reported in 5 of 25 animals treated post-surgically with buprenorphine or fentanyl, but no deaths occurred among 30 control rats or 20 rats treated with acetaminophen or flunixin30. Another study reported no deaths in rats treated with buprenorphine and housed for 1\u20132 d on grid floors or on paper12. In this study, we observed no deaths and no signs of pica among 32 rats treated with buprenorphine and housed with soft fiber bedding. These results suggest that, although opiate-induced pica can have severe and even lethal consequences for rats housed with hardwood and corncob bedding13,14, these can be minimized if researchers instead use alternative bedding materials, such as soft fiber.",

Nausea is a common adverse effect of opiate therapy in humans and animals and can confound experimental results. We observed signs of nausea-related behavior in 25% of the rats treated with buprenorphine. This incidence is similar to the incidence of nausea reported among human patients treated with opiate therapies31. The male rat that first showed signs of nausea-related behavior on day 1 was one of two male rats receiving 3.9 mg buprenorphine per kg body weight that lost weight throughout the study. Clinical pathology results for all rats were normal, however, suggesting that consequences of this behavior were minor. The presence of moderate levels of protein in expressed urine could generally indicate renal damage, but this was not supported by the blood chemistry findings.",

Whether the signs we observed (hair loss and lesions on the forepaws) in this study are entirely related to nausea requires further verification. Future studies of nausea-related behavior in rats treated with buprenorphine are also needed to address whether its incidence can be reduced by lower doses of drug; to assess its incidence, duration and intensity; and to determine whether it occurs in other rat strains32,33. The use of light and dark surveillance9 and automated tracking34 techniques in such studies might help to better characterize this behavior.",

The safety of the drug in older rats, in rats of different strains and in the context of different surgical procedures is unknown.
