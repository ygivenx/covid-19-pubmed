            "text": "The occurrence in late 2002 and early 2003 of cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in southeast China quickly drew international attention as the disease sickened more than 8,000 people and spread to more than 30 countries within six months. Since the identification of the etiological agent, the SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV), in 2003, development and characterization of animal models for evaluation of prophylaxis and treatment strategies have been of great interest. Although SARS-CoV has not been associated with a subsequent widespread outbreak since 2002\u20132003, the potential for such an outbreak remains. Identification of a SARS-like coronavirus in Chinese horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus species) that are indigenous across Southeast Asia suggests that they may represent a natural reservoir from which viruses may be introduced into the human population [1]. The course of infection in animal models is abbreviated compared with the course of SARS in humans; however, many aspects of SARS-CoV\u2013associated disease are reproducible in animal models, including age-dependent susceptibility, recovery of SARS-CoV from respiratory tissues and secretions, infection of type I and type II pneumocytes and bronchial epithelial cells, detection of viral genome in blood and extrapulmonary tissues, and pulmonary pathology (including pneumonitis, edema, necrotic debris, and hyaline membrane formation) [2,3]. Clinical symptoms have been reported in some species, but the findings are not entirely reproducible in outbred species. Variability in clinical symptoms seen in outbred species may result from additional factors, including infection with co-pathogens, stress, existence of sub-species of test animals, and use of different virus strains. This variation can be problematic in studies of pathogenesis and vaccine efficacy unless a large enough number of animals are included in each treatment group [2]. The ideal animal model would demonstrate viral replication in respiratory tissues, histopathologic evidence of respiratory disease, and consistent clinical signs of disease, including mortality. A small animal model in which all of these aspects of virus-associated disease are seen would be desirable because reproducible data can be generated in inbred animals, and larger numbers of animals can be included for statistical analysis of biological outcomes.",

Lightly anesthetized mice were inoculated intranasally with 105 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) per mouse of SARS-CoV (Urbani). Two to three days post-infection (d.p.i.), when peak viral titers are observed, lungs were harvested from infected mice and clarified homogenates were used as inocula for continued serial passage via intranasal inoculation in mice. To screen for virulence in mice, groups of young na\u00efve mice (N = 5\u20138) were inoculated with lung homogenates collected at passage 2, 10, and 15 (P2, P10, and P15, respectively), weighed daily, and observed twice daily for signs of morbidity or mortality. Deaths were not observed following inoculation with P2 or P10; however, increased morbidity, as indicated by weight loss, was noted in P10-inoculated mice at day 3 post-infection (p.i.) (unpublished data). Mortality was observed in P15-inoculated mice; 60% of P15-inoculated mice died or displayed extreme morbidity and were euthanized by 5 d.p.i. Mortality was not observed in mice infected with intermediate passages (P11\u2013P14), and accompanying morbidity was not measured (unpublished data). Supernatant from lung homogenates at P15 contained a heterogeneous virus pool as evident upon sequence analysis of cDNA fragments generated by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) amplification from purified viral RNA (vRNA). Dual peaks were observed on sequence chromatograms at several nucleotide residues, indicating mixed populations in the virus pool. To obtain a clonal population, P15 virus was biologically cloned by three rounds of terminal dilution in Vero cells. Five clones were screened for lethality in 6- to 8-wk-old BALB/c mice; these clones caused mortality from 50% to 100%. One clone, designated MA15, resulted in 100% mortality within 6 d. BALB/c mice aged 6 to 8 wk, 4 mo, and 13 mo were all susceptible to MA15 infection, with severe morbidity or death occurring within 3 to 5 d following intranasal inoculation.",

The sequence of the initial SARS-CoV (P0) virus was identical to the published SARS-CoV (Urbani) sequence, and six nucleotide substitutions were identified in the MA15 genome compared with that of SARS-CoV (Urbani). All six substitutions were predicted to cause amino acid substitutions. These six mutations were localized to open reading frame (ORF) 1ab (four mutations) and ORFs S and M (one each) of SARS-CoV (Figure 1). Independent analysis conducted by The Institute for Genomic Research (Rockville, Maryland, United States), under a National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) contract, confirmed the same six mutations in the MA15 sequence compared with those in the SARS-CoV (Urbani) sequence.",

At a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1, viruses reached peak replication (107.0\u20137.5 pfu/mL) at \u223c24 h.p.i., with a slight delay in peak titers for rMA15ORF1ab (Figure S1). Northern blot analysis of RNA from infected Vero E6 cells indicated that genomic vRNA and viral mRNA and all eight sub-genomic mRNAs were present in similar ratios for the recombinant viruses and MA15 virus as for SARS-CoV (Urbani) (Figure 2A). The level of expression and mobility of the structural proteins (S and N) and an accessory protein (ORF 3a, also called X1) of the recombinant viruses and MA15 virus were comparable to those of SARS-CoV (Urbani), as determined by Western blot analysis (Figure 2B). Although S, N, and X1 are somewhat reduced in the lane (Figure 2B) from icSARS-CoV\u2013infected cultures, this is associated with reduced amounts of total protein added to the well, rather than with any specific reduction in X1 expression. Thus, the recombinant viruses (rMA15SM, rMA15ORF1ab, rMA15, and icSARS-CoV) and the MA15 virus demonstrate no defects in replication or in RNA or protein expression compared with SARS-CoV (Urbani) in Vero E6 cells.",

At various time points p.i., mice were sacrificed and tissues harvested for subsequent processing. Data from replicate experiments were combined. High titers of virus were detected in the lungs of mice through day 5 p.i. (Figure 3). One day after inoculation, the amount of SARS-CoV (Urbani) in lungs was \u223c106 TCID50/g tissue. Following administration of a lethal dose, MA15 virus was found to replicate to significantly higher titers of \u223c109 TCID50/g tissue within 24 h (p = 0.0001; Figure 3). In this study and in previous studies (K. Subbarao, A. Roberts, L. Vogel, E. Lamirande, et al., unpublished data), peak virus titers (\u223c107.0 TCID50/g tissue) occur at day 2 following inoculation with SARS-CoV (Urbani). In comparison, by day 2 p.i., viral titers in MA15-inoculated mice reached, or persisted at, titers of \u223c109 TCID50/g tissue, regardless of inoculating dose (Figure 3). Furthermore, in mice inoculated with a sub-lethal dose of MA15, virus was detected at 107.7 TCID50/g lung on day 5 p.i. By comparison, in SARS-CoV (Urbani)\u2013infected mice, virus was detected at titers of 105.1 TCID50/g lung on day 5 p.i. By 6 d.p.i., virus was no longer consistently detected in mice inoculated with SARS-CoV (Urbani) or with sub-lethal doses of MA15 virus (Figure 3).",

Although quantitative virology holds biological relevance since it indicates viral burden by measuring infectious virus, RT-PCR of vRNA or sub-genomic mRNAs may be more sensitive assays for the presence of virus. Due to the replication strategy of SARS-CoV, primers that specifically amplify sub-genomic mRNAs allow detection of products of viral transcription. Furthermore, amplification of virus-specific mRNAs allows distinction from vRNA that may represent non-viable virus [6].

Serum ALP levels in MA15-inoculated mice were also significantly higher than those of mice inoculated with 106.4 TCID50/mouse of SARS-CoV (p = 0.0045; Table S5). Levels of other liver enzymes, including aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, gamma glutamyl transferase, creatine kinase, urea nitrogen, total bilirubin, and albumin, were not significantly altered following inoculation with MA15 virus (unpublished data). Although moderately elevated levels of creatinine were observed in MA15-inoculated mice, no significant differences were seen between MA15- and SARS-CoV\u2013inoculated mice, suggesting that this was not associated with the lethal phenotype of the MA15 virus. Furthermore, significant lymphopenia and neutrophilia were observed following infection with SARS-CoV and MA15 virus. Although some samples were lost due to coagulation of blood, the alterations in the lymphocyte and neutrophil counts were more severe following infection with MA15 virus than they were following SARS-CoV infection (Table S5).",

Four weeks after inoculation, the mice were bled for determination of SARS-CoV\u2013specific serum neutralizing antibodies and challenged with 106.9 TCID50 of MA15 virus. Mice were followed daily for signs of morbidity and mortality. Serum neutralizing antibodies were detected at low titers (1:10) in SARS-CoV\u2013immunized mice but not in mock-immunized mice (<1:8). Nevertheless, SARS-CoV\u2013immunized mice were protected from lethal challenge and demonstrated reduced morbidity (\u223c11% weight loss compared with >20% weight loss in mock-immunized mice) following a high titer challenge with MA15 virus. Mock-immunized mice did not survive past day 4 following challenge with MA15 virus (Figure 7).",

The virulence and lethality of the MA15 virus result from six mutations in the SARS-CoV genome that occurred within 15 passages through BALB/c mice. Introduction of these six mutations into a recombinant SARS-CoV infectious clone, rMA15, conferred a lethal phenotype on the virus for young BALB/c mice. Five of these six mutations (not including the T67A mutation occurring in the non-structural protein [nsp] 9 of ORF 1ab) occur within nsp 5 (two mutations), nsp 13, S, and M. These genes have been reported as ones where sequence evolution occurred during adaptation of SARS-CoV in humans [7]. The mutations in nsp 9, nsp 5 (H133Y and E269A within the main protease, 3CLpro), and nsp 13 (A4V within the helicase protein) do not occur within any known functional domains and do not alter known cleavage sites utilized in the processing of the ORF 1ab polyprotein. Furthermore, the mutations in the MA15 virus do not occur at any specific amino acid positions identified by the Chinese SARS Molecular Epidemiology Consortium [7]. Only the mutation in S (Y436H) occurs within a known functional domain, the receptor-binding motif (RBM). Other reports have indicated that mutations within the RBM may account for increased affinity of the virus for its cellular receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 [8]. However, the Y436H mutation in MA15 virus does not occur at previously identified sites of the RBM and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 interaction, and preliminary findings suggest that the Y436H mutation does not increase binding of the SARS-CoV (Tor2) RBD to murine angiotensin\u2013converting enzyme 2 [9].",

In one adaptation of influenza A/FM/1/47 (FM-MA), findings indicated that four viral gene segments contributed to increased virulence [4], but additional analyses indicated that mutations occurring in at least two and likely three gene products acted synergistically to account for the increased virulence [10\u201312]. Recombinant icSARS-CoV produced mild pneumonia identified by X-ray changes in macaques, similar to the clinical disease noted with wild-type SARS-CoV (Urbani) [13]. Consistent with these findings, recombinant SARS-CoV bearing the six novel mouse-adapted mutations, rMA15, recapitulated a fatal respiratory disease phenotype in mice, demonstrating the ability of the SARS molecular clones to capture complex disease phenotypes. We generated two other recombinant SARS-CoVs, rMA15SM (encoding the two mutations in the S and M genes) and rMA15 ORF1ab (encoding the four mutations in ORF 1ab). Neither of these was lethal (Table 2) in BALB/c mice, indicating that SARS-CoV adaptation for BALB/c mice involves mutations in at least two and possibly three genes (S + ORF 1ab, M + ORF 1ab, or S + M + ORF 1ab). Although recombinant viruses bearing two or four of the mutations were not lethal, each had a different phenotype than that of SARS-CoV (Urbani). It is possible that the mutations in S and M contribute to increased viremia (Figure S2) and that the mutations in ORF 1ab contribute to increased pathogenicity indicated by weight loss (Table 2).",

SARS-CoV (Urbani)\u2013infected mice demonstrate a pronounced but transient interstitial inflammation at day 3 p.i. that is absent in MA15-infected mice. This transient inflammation is not associated with significant weight loss but coincides with the beginning of viral clearance from the lungs. In contrast, by day 3 p.i., MA15 virus\u2013infected mice lose weight, and necrotic cellular debris begins to fill the bronchioles and alveoli. By day 4 p.i., MA15-infected mice have lost in excess of 20% of their initial body weight, and several die without other overt clinical signs such as ataxia, paralysis, hunched posture, etc. Viral titers in lungs of MA15-infected mice are up to 1,000-fold higher than those in SARS-CoV\u2013infected mice by 24 h.p.i. and remain higher than peak levels in SARS-CoV\u2013infected mice through day 4 p.i. In situ hybridization further confirms the intense and persistent signal of MA15 (and rMA15) vRNA in lung tissues at day 4 p.i. when vRNA from SARS-CoV (Urbani) and the non-lethal rMA15SM and rMA15ORF1ab viruses are less abundant (Figure S3). Objective data related to respiratory distress such as plethysmography and measurement of blood gases could not be collected because of practical and logistical constraints on experiments carried out in an Animal Biosafety Level 3 laboratory. However, our findings indicate that MA15 virus\u2013infected mice die as a result of overwhelming pulmonary viral infection and destruction of bronchiolar epithelial cells and alveolar pneumocytes. Viral load in SARS cases was an important determinant of severe disease and death [14], but the mechanism of disease leading to fatal outcome in human cases of SARS may be different than that observed in MA15-infected BALB/c mice. The mechanism of death following SARS-CoV infection in humans, and particularly the relative contribution of virus-induced damage and immunopathology, are not fully understood. The histopathology documented in the mice infected with the MA15 virus includes a rapid progression and extensive damage to bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial cells (Figure 6A and 6B), but it does not show some features such as alveolar edema and hyaline membranes that were reported in many SARS-CoV\u2013infected patients, or in aged mice infected with the Urbani strain of SARS-CoV [15]. This can be explained by the relative virulence of the MA15 strain, and the time p.i. when the lungs were evaluated. Mice infected with the MA15 virus developed severe morbidity and died within 3 to 5 d following infection and did not survive long enough to show progression of the diffuse alveolar damage seen in aged mice or in human patients, who survive for a relatively prolonged length of time before succumbing to complications of the acute infection. In aged mice following SARS-CoV infection, histopathologic changes indicative of progressive diffuse alveolar damage, including proteinaceous deposits around alveolar walls and intraalveolar edema, are seen beginning on day 5 [15].",

Although steroid treatment and secondary bacterial infections may be speculated to be the cause of neutrophilia, some patients with SARS had neutrophilia prior to initiation of steroid treatment and in the absence of bacterial infections [26].

Quantitative virology was the only outcome measure available in young BALB/c mice challenged with SARS-CoV (Urbani). Because the MA15 virus replicates rapidly to high titer and is lethal for young BALB/c mice, this virus provides a more stringent challenge than the SARS-CoV (Urbani) virus in evaluating the efficacy of therapeutic interventions or prevention strategies. Prophylaxis that is able to rescue MA15-infected mice from a lethal outcome must lower viral burden in lungs very rapidly (e.g., within the first 24 h). Prophylaxis that accomplishes such reduction in the burden of MA15 virus may also reduce the severity of immunopathology that follows. A reduction of immunopathology was demonstrated in a SARS-CoV hamster model when a monoclonal antibody specific to SARS-CoV spike protein administered the day after infection was able to arrest a further rise in viral titer in the lungs [29]. If similar protection can be demonstrated against challenge with MA15 virus in BALB/c mice, the efficacy of intervention will be well proven.",

Finally, and most importantly, MA15 virus infection of young BALB/c mice provides many elements that replicate observations in acute (and chronic) cases of SARS infection in humans, including sequence changes during adaptation in several genes (nsp 5, nsp 13, S, and M); viral replication and histopathological changes in lungs of infected animals; viremia; detection of vRNA in extrapulmonary sites, including the intestines; clinical indicators of illness, including mortality; and changes in blood counts, including lymphopenia and neutrophilia. The availability of a molecular clone of the MA15 virus, and the ability to generate additional SARS-CoV recombinant viruses that recapitulate the in vivo phenotype, will allow for detailed probing of the mechanisms mediating SARS-CoV pathogenesis and acute lung damage.",
