            "text": "Recently, DNA microarrays have been used for the simultaneous detection and identification of numerous pathogens using locus\u2010specific amplification methods (Bryant et al., 2004). Several microarray\u2010based assays have been developed and employed to track or identify multiple pathogenic microorganisms, such as bacteria (Gingeras et al., 1998; Troesch et al., 1999; Wilson et al., 2002; Vora et al., 2004; Davignon et al., 2005), including potential biowarfare agents such as Bacillus anthracis(Zwick et al., 2005), respiratory pathogens in clinical samples (Lin et al., 2006) and miscellaneous viruses (Wang et al., 2003; Wong et al., 2004; Palacios et al., 2007). However, none of these methods provides comprehensive information about the pathogen at the single nucleotide level. Consequently, we devised a diagnostic protocol that employs microarray\u2010based resequencing technology (described in Fodor et al., 1993; 1991; Pease et al., 1994; Chee et al., 1996; Hacia, 1999; Cutler et al., 2001; Warrington et al., 2002) to meet the following requirements: it should be unbiased, requiring no prior information, universal, highly specific and able to discriminate between pathogens that impart similar or overlapping symptoms. In addition, the approach should be comprehensive, sensitive, not influenced by human DNA, and in this case detecting agents on the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) Category A, B and C Priority pathogen list. Rapid turnaround is also important and ideally results should be generated the same day.",

Analysing the intensity from these multiple features permits detection of the reference sequence as well as characterization of relative Single\u2010nuclectide\u2010polymorphisms (SNPs). Our results indicate that resequencing microarrays are capable of accurate identification and characterization of pathogens, without the need for locus\u2010specific PCR amplification. This rapid, comprehensive assay provides clinically relevant information which can be used to accelerate treatment decisions, and ultimately improve the medical care of patients with bacterial or viral infections.",

            "text": "We studied three separate complex mixtures of pathogens which confer overlapping clinical symptoms and which might pose a challenge for diagnosis. The first mixture included DNA from pathogens associated with respiratory syndromes, the second DNA from pathogens associated with meningitis and encephalitis, and the third DNA from organisms associated with septicaemia. All three mixtures contained a background of human DNA to mimic a clinical specimen: DNA prepared from nasal washes for the respiratory mixture, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for the meningitis\u2013encephalitis mixture or a human cell line (HeLa) for the septicaemia mixture. Each mixture was tested on the array and the resulting sequences were analysed. The three experiments detect and sequence 48, 11 and 25 genetic fragments respectively (Table 1). The sequence for each conserved element underwent blast analysis in which the highest scoring matches determine the identity. The antibiotic resistance (ABR) elements predict likely resistance to their associated antibiotics. Finally, the pathogenicity genes represent the various toxins and virulence factors that the pathogen can generate. Results shown in Table 1 indicate that despite the presence of background nucleic acids of human origin, all expected organisms were detected. We also tested DNA extracted from normal nasal wash, CSF and sputum samples to determine the hybridization pattern of background organisms. We detected Neisseria16S, Pseudomonas16S and human 18S and mitochondrial DNA in the nasal wash. No specific organisms were found in the CSF sample.

Globally, the correspondence between antibiotic resistance genes and point mutations detected by the microarray and resistance phenotypes determined by an antibiogram was excellent. Indeed, as shown in Table 3, resistance phenotypes resulting from acquired genes or point mutations were identified successfully with the microarray, including the point mutation in the parC gene conferring fluoroquinolone resistance to the S. haemolyticusstrain. The non\u2010detection of resistance phenotypes was due either to the absence of the gene sequence tiled on the array (such as the non\u2010detection of rifampicin resistance for the S. haemolyticus strain), or to resistance mechanisms likely caused by overexpression of an efflux pump. The microarray approach allows us to identify antibiotic resistance genes, such as ant9\u2010I (conferring spectinomycin resistance), which are not tested routinely in an antibiogram. The results we obtained confirm the ability of the microarray to detect acquired genes accurately as well as point mutations when the corresponding sequence was tiled on the microarray.
