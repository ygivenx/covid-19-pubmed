            "text": "Viral respiratory tract infections (VRTI) are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with hematologic malignancies, particularly in allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients [1\u20133]. In immunocompromised patients, VRTI are usually more severe, with an increased risk of progression from upper to lower respiratory tract infections and more frequent presence of bacterial or fungal co-pathogens than in immunocompetent patients [4\u20137]. Moreover, long-term sequelae of VRTI, such as restrictive or obstructive airway disease, have been reported [8, 9]. During the last decade, rapid and highly sensitive molecular tests have been developed and made available, with the most recent multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) platform that can detect multiple viral pathogens [10\u201312]. Based on data from observational studies, it is believed that most VRTI in patients with haematological malignancies present with fever and/or upper respiratory tract symptoms, while less is known about the asymptomatic circulation of respiratory viruses, even though prolonged viral shedding has been observed [4, 12\u201320].",

Similar results were reported in another prospective observational study, where 25 % of patients had a VRTI, and respiratory viruses were detected more frequently in the presence of symptoms, but symptoms in case of influenza and other VRTI were similar [20]. ECDC definition adapted for the haematology population was even less specific than ILI. In immunocompetent individuals, ILI presentation is considered rather specific for influenza during the epidemic season. In fact, in generally healthy older adolescents and adults living in areas with confirmed influenza virus circulation, estimates of PPV, a simple clinical definition of influenza (acute onset of cough and fever), have been reported to be approximately 80\u201390 % and empirical anti-influenza treatment was recommended in such conditions [28\u201331]. However, even in an immunocompetent population, the accuracy of the clinical diagnosis of influenza on the basis of symptoms alone is being questioned (reported incidence of ILI in patients with influenza, 44\u201351 %) and is now considered limited because symptoms from illness caused by other pathogens can overlap considerably with influenza [29]. In immunocompromised patients, the association between ILI and influenza is even less pronounced, as systemic symptoms, such as fever or myalgia, are frequently lacking [32]. Therefore, considering the co-circulation of influenza, RSV and rhinoviruses in the same period and the similar clinical presentation of these infections, early use of rapid molecular testing to identify a specific virus, instead of universal empirical treatment with anti-influenza drugs in patients with ILI, should be pursued. Initiating antiviral treatment at the onset of symptoms and then discontinuing it after diagnostic tests result negative for influenza is another feasible management strategy.",

Such a low incidence might be a result of a strict isolation policy with daily use of surgical masks and particular attention to hand hygiene, together with a virus-specific attack rate that may vary annually. Additionally, a low progression rate to lower respiratory tract infection and low mortality in all VRTI was observed (approximately 5 %), possibly due to a rapid diagnosis and an early start of an antiviral therapy\u2014usually 24\u201348 h after the onset of symptoms. Therefore, in a population with low incidence and mortality and in consideration of the possibility of acquiring resistance to antivirals, as reported during the 2009 H1N1 epidemics [33, 34], an early diagnosis and post-exposure prophylaxis for close contacts seem preferable to a general chemoprophylactic strategy.",

The limitations are a single-centre experience and a short observation period, which did not include the last weeks of 2010 when some infections could occur. Thus, data on the incidence cannot be extrapolated to other populations or seasons. Additionally, the sensitivity of detection of respiratory viruses may vary for oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal specimens [37]. Although, nasopharyngeal aspirates may be the most sensitive, especially for conventional diagnostic methods, less invasive specimen collection techniques are also acceptable given the very high sensitivity of new molecular diagnostic methods [37], while recent guidelines recommend combined intranasal sampling using flocked swabs and the pharyngeal swabs in one virus transport medium [25]. Finally, other centres with different management strategies for outpatients, including different contact prevention measures, might experience different rates of nosocomial transmission or morbidity.",

Thus, empirical treatment of influenza in the presence of ILI might be reserved for severely ill patients. Rapid virological diagnosis and treatment only in case of a documented infection have been found feasible and successful in this setting of high-risk haematology outpatients.",
