Well-known examples include Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in 2003 [1,2], influenza A (H1N1) in 2009 [3], Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus in 2012 [4], Ebola in 2013 [5], and the continuing H7N9 of avian influenza virus [6], etc. To understand contagion processes, mathematical models are an essential tool and have a long tradition in scientific communities that can date back to Bernuolli's work on the smallpox vaccination in 1760 [7]. Until now, the modeling effort has been fruitful at all levels [8,9], ranging from conceptual models [10,11] that capture the generic features of contagions, network models [12\u201315] that focus on the underlying structure of population or commuting patterns to the sophisticated computational models [16,17], where a variety of high-resolution data, like demographics, transportation, epidemiological features, and behavioral response [18], are incorporated.",

This sort of interacting contagions is motivated by the fact that the spread of different infections in the real world is not entirely independent; they often influence each other [19,20]. Well-known examples include the case of pneumonia bacterium like Streptococcus pneumoniae and viral respiratory illness (e.g., seasonal influenza) where they mutually facilitate each other's propogation [21,22], and the coinfection between human immunodeficiency virus and a host of other infections [23\u201327]. The interaction among different infections can be either competitive\n[28\u201334] (they suppress each other's circulation) or cooperative\n[35\u201342] (they support each other). The mean-field treatment and percolation studies of structured population reveal a rich spectrum of new dynamical features that are unexpected in the classic scenario of single infection. For example, when different infections are competing, both one-infection-dominance and coexistence are possible, depending on the properties of involved infections and the underlining networks [28]. By contrast, in cooperative contagions discontinuous outbreak transition appears [35,36], along with many interesting spreading features such as the higher chance of outbreak in clustered networks [37], first-order phase transitions in the contagion prevalence [40], etc.",

            "text": "Although these studies provide new insights into the temporal dynamics of interacting contagions, their spatial behavior is largely unknown [43]. The investigation of the spatial role is indispensable for a full comprehension of contagion complexities [44,45], not only for its conceptual significance but also for its practical relevance to the real world [46]. Abundant empirical evidence reveals nontrivial dynamical properties in spatial epidemiology, such as traveling waves [47], infection patterns [48], and even the spatiotemporal chaos [49]. A major modeling effort is devoted to the studies of traveling waves in spatial domains, like the Black Death in Europe or the rabies epizootic in France [44]. The emergence of infection patterns, however, receives much less attention, yet a few mechanisms are proposed for their generation [50,51]. These studies mainly focus on the single infection cases by incorporating additional compartments and/or additional dynamical processes. To our knowledge, there is rare work discussing the spatial dynamics of interacting contagions, especially the possibility of pattern emergence. A preliminary effort studies the spatial dynamics of two interacting contagions, assuming all individuals are of identical mobilities; novel propagation modes are revealed, like receding fronts and standing waves [40]. However, in realistic cases, individuals in different states are generally of different mobilities, depending on the individual's state. For example, healthy people normally move faster than the sick, who might prefer staying at home or in the hospital for recovery. So what is the generic spatial dynamics when more than one infection proliferates in the population? This question is also of particular interest in the ecology community, where different diffusivities of species are thought to be responsible for the emergence of patchiness [52]. In addition, recent works show that multiplex networks as the underlying medium provide another mechanism for generating patterns even if all species are of the same mobility [53\u201356].",

The dynamics of SIS therefore captures a class of contagions where recovered individuals confer no immunity.

In the transmission dynamics, we distinguish two infection rates: the initial rate \u03b1A (\u03b1B), with which infection A (B) transmits to a susceptible S individual, and the secondary rate \u03b1AB (\u03b1BA), with which a secondary infection transmits to a host who is already infected with A (B). To simplify, we assume uniform recovery rate \u03b2. With these, the mean-field (MF) dynamics is\n(1)S\u02d9=\u2212\u03b1AS(IA+IAB)\u2212\u03b1BS(IB+IAB)+\u03b2(IA+IB),I\u02d9A=\u03b1AS(IA+IAB)\u2212\u03b1ABIA(IB+IAB)+\u03b2(IAB\u2212IA),I\u02d9B=\u03b1BS(IB+IAB)\u2212\u03b1BAIB(IA+IAB)+\u03b2(IAB\u2212IB),I\u02d9AB=\u03b1ABIA(IB+IAB)+\u03b1BAIB(IA+IAB)\u22122\u03b2IAB.Here S, IA, IB, and IAB denote the densities of individuals in the states S, A, B, and AB, respectively. The precise meaning of \u03b1AB is the rate that a host already infected with A can be further infected with B and vice versa. One can then conveniently defines the cooperativity coefficients\nCA=\u03b1AB/\u03b1B (CB=\u03b1BA/\u03b1A), measuring the infection A\u2013(B) induced change in the secondary infection rate for the other. When A and B cooperate, the secondary infection is easier, i.e., CA,B>1; CA,B<1 implies competitive contagions, such as the case of cross-immunity; and if CA,B=1, then the two infections are neutrally interacting, essentially decoupled in their contagion processes. Without considering birth and death processes in the population, the four densities are in conservation, i.e., S+IA+IB+IAB=1. For simplicity, here we adopt symmetrical parameters, i.e., \u03b1A=\u03b1B=\u03b1 for the initial infections, \u03b1AB=\u03b1BA=\u03b1\u2032 for the secondary infections, which implies CA=CB=\u03b1\u2032/\u03b1\u2261C.",

More evidence is illustrated in the evolution of h(t) for a couple of cases with different C [Figs. 3(d) and 3(e)]. As we see, the increasing trend of h(t) becomes slower or just ceases when the interaction C deviates gradually from 1 at both sides. These suggest that the most favored case for pattern emergence occurs at an intermediate interaction (here, coincidentally, the neutral scenario). The maximal eigenvalues \u03bbmax clearly show that only a bounded range of C supports the emergence of patterns, and they peak around C=1 [Fig. 3(f)]. While the positive sign of \u03bbmax indicates the possibility of pattern formation, their absolute value determines the speed of segregation process. So for those with small positive eigenvalues, pattern formation takes a long time, like the one in Fig. 3(b). Note that the specific value of C for the most favored cases is not necessarily at 1; generally, it depends on the reproduction number R0, a larger R0 reduces the value, and vice versa. Further studies show that when C deviates from the most favored case, the peaked mode k becomes smaller; accordingly, the pattern scale increases [according to Eq.

Actually, what really matters here is the ratio of the two diffusion coefficients; these boundaries are all well collapsed by rescaling the x axis as DS/DI if C is not too large (see Supplementary Figure S1) [59]. This is because their absolute values simply set scale, and it is the ratio of DS/DI that shifts the peaked wave-vector mode k, namely the pattern scales. Notice that for the limiting case of DI=0, where the infections become completely localized, the spreading is blocked and there is no nontrivial patterns expected.

Further increase in R0 interestingly does not destroy the patterned infection as the theoretic prediction that when R0>1.08 for C=10 [see Fig. 4(b)] patterns should become unstable. Instead, the pattern disappears until R0>1.5, as shown by h(t). The presence of pattern does not alter the overall outbreak size in this direction.\n",

An amazing phenomenon happens when we further decrease R0 so the eradication of the two infections now occurs not at R0e but at a much smaller threshold, R0e,p (\u201cp\u201d indicates the presence of patterns). This means that a persistent prevalence is present compared to the MF case (without space) in this less-infectious region. An intuitive explanation can be found in Fig. 6(d), where the coinfected individuals are now clustered in a few spatial spots in quite high densities; the two infections support each other, making their survival at a rather small R0. Here the number of segregated bars decreases in both cases as time goes by [Fig. 6(b) and 6(d)], indicating that the pattern scale increases as the patterns become less likely, in line with the above observations.",

While the former is naturally driven by the diffusion difference, the latter is critical for further growth and is summarized in Fig. 7(c). There the reactions happen within each local site for aggregation, and diffusion occurs between neighboring sites for dilution. Once an alternating profile is triggered between neighboring sites, the reaction dominates over the diffusion at the beginning for the growth of the profiles.

C\u21920 means the termination of the secondary infection process, and this breaks down the reaction into two single-infection processes, S\u2192IA,B. Since the aggregation dynamics is absent for a single infection, no pattern is expected. C\u2192\u221e, on the contrary, leads to an overwhelming fraction in \u03c1A,B, while others, especially the density of S, become quite low in H regions. As such, the inadequate supply of S for the reaction to produce \u03c1A,B makes the loop collapse, and patterns thus also fail to exist. This explains why too-competitive or -cooperative interactions fail to generate patterns and an intermediate C provides the most favored condition for patterns.(b)For a large C, however, there are two strategies one can think of to keep the loop working: either a large DS that provides a quick supply of S from the neighborhood or a small DI where the loss of \u03c1A,B by dilution is so slow that the reaction S\u2192\u03c1A,B is almost turned off and even a very low density of S is enough to keep the loop working. This explains why pattern emergence favors large DS and small DI and why the ratio DS/DI is essential.(c)The impact of R0 is similar to C and affects both initial and secondary infection processes. R0\u21920 terminates the whole reaction, R0\u2192\u221e by contrast, and results in an imbalance between S and \u03c1A,B; therefore a bounded pattern range of R0 is explained. Also as expected, when a larger R0 is used, the value of C for the most favored conditions decreases for moderate densities of \u03c1A,B, and vice versa.(d)As the dynamical loop is endangered by tuning parameters, this always means an inadequate supply of either S or \u03c1A,B. As a consequence, the width of the L/H regions tends to increase for accumulating the minority species to sustain the loop. This is why the less likely cases for pattern are always accompanied by increased length scales. And once the pattern scale exceeds the domain size, patterns disappear.",

Even so, we argue that the patterns here still belong to Turing mechanism, because they are consistent with the general criterion \u201clocal activation with lateral inhibition\u201d [61,62].

Their emergence does not require any peculiar infection-infection interaction; instead, the pattern formation favors a mild condition where too-strong cooperation or competition is absent. Dynamical mechanism analysis reveals an aggregation phenomenon along with a dynamical loop. This mechanism is rooted in the intrinsic dynamics when two infections are engaged, and too-strong baseline infection or infection-infection interaction destroys this loop. Among other observations, one finding of particular interest is the pattern hysteresis, i.e., the pattern formation is not only determined by the system parameters but also depends on its evolution history.

When the patterns emerge, the clustering of the infected individuals leads to persistent survival of the infections in the form of pattern hysteresis. As a consequence, much more effort, if it is not impossible, is required to eradicate infectious diseases compared to the scenario without space (e.g., within a single city) or the single-infection case.",

For example, companies want to sell more products or technologies to their customers, politicians try to convince more people of their political opinions, and bloggers want to make their messages have a wider readership and more retweets. In those cases, the implications of our study, which supports higher and persistent prevalence, are good news.",

Besides, our work highlights that the spatial dimension is capable of harboring unexpected amount of complexities in the contagion processes, which has largely been underestimated in past research. In this sense, our work could act as a helpful starting point for a more systematic investigation, while many open questions remain, such as the contagion dynamics of more general cases with arbitrary number of infections and how to relate the plain-spaced pattern dynamics to a networked modern world, where heterogeneous transportation systems are often present [46].

Four states are then possible for host individuals: susceptible S, partially infected A or B, and the coinfected state AB. In the contagion process, S becomes partially infected (A/B) with an initial infection rate \u03b1 by contacting the infected; the partially infected individuals can be further be infected by the other infection to be doubly infected (AB) with the secondary infection rate \u03b1\u2032. All infected individuals recover with rate \u03b2. (b) Spatially interacting contagions: When subpopulations are coupled through their spatial neighborhood, the diffusion captures the local mobility of individuals and thus also the infections they carried. Generally, the mobility of a given individual depends on its state; e.g., in epidemic spread, susceptible people statistically move faster than infected individuals, who might prefer to stay at home or in the hospital for recovery. Mathematically, this is captured by DS>DA,B,AB within the RD framework described by Eq. (2).",
