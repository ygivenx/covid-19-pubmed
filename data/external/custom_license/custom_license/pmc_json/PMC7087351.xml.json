Some particular serotypes, especially 3, 7, and 21, have been reported to cause either epidemics of respiratory illnesses or fulminant events, including lethal pneumonia [3, 15, 18]. Infection by these serotypes can also result in long-term pulmonary complications, e.g., bronchiolitis obliterans, bronchiectasis, and the Swyer James syndrome [8, 25, 29, 31, 36]. Apart from specific serotypes, some host factors have also been found to be associated with development of severe Ad infection, such as young age (less than 7 years old), underlying chronic disease, post-transplant or immunocompromised state [13, 24, 30].",

So far, there have been no reports on the Ad serotype pattern in Hong Kong, and their relationships with disease manifestations and complications are unknown. The few local studies that related to Ad infection only focused on the overall epidemiology of viral pneumonia or acute respiratory tract infections in hospitalized children [7, 32, 33].",

The diagnosis of pneumonia was based on the presence of cough with tachypnea [28] or positive auscultative findings (bronchial breath sound or crackles) in addition to abnormal radiological features (consolidation/interstitial infiltrates) that were consistent with pneumonia, as interpreted by the attending pediatrician or by the radiologist.

Ad was identified initially by characteristic cytopathic effect and direct immunofluorescence staining (Adenovirus DFA Reagent, EMD Millipore Corporation, USA) of the infected cells. Definitive typing of the viral isolate was performed by micro-neutralization assay with HEp-2C cells for serotyping as described previously [16]. The isolate was passed to a new HEp2-C tube until \u226575 % cytopathic effect was evident and diluted the culture at 1:10 with 2 % minimum essential medium after freezing and thawing of the culture once before carrying out the neutralization test. Briefly, 0.05 ml of each Ad typing serum type 1 to 7 (Denka Seiken, Japan) at 10\u201320 antibody unit per 0.05 ml was added to 0.05 ml of each isolate at a viral concentration of 100 TCID50 (50 % tissue culture infective dose) per 0.05 ml and incubated at 37 \u00b0C in 2.5 % CO2 for 1 h, followed by incubation with 0.1 ml HEp-2C cells (150,000 cells per ml) for up to 7 days. The serotypes were determined by inhibition of cytopathic effect by corresponding type-specific antisera. End results were read when the virus control showed 100 % cytopathic effect. Back-titration of the input virus dose and cells without virus inoculation as negative control was run in parallel. In case where the virus could not be neutralized by the antisera used, the test was repeated at 1:20, 1:50, or higher viral dilution if necessary. Isolates that did not type after repeated tests were considered as untypeable.",

Serotypes 3, 7, and 21 have been previously identified as the culprits [3, 15, 18, 29]. Apart from susceptible host risk factors, severe infection can also occur in previously healthy person [14, 26]. Interestingly, there was a marked variation in the morbidity and mortality rates of adenovirus LRTI in different studied populations. Ad respiratory infection had a profound impact in some countries. Mortality up to 16 % and permanent pulmonary sequelae ranging from 14 to 60 % were reported in children in some South American countries following Ad pneumonia [3, 4, 24, 34]. Lower yet still significant mortality and morbidity rates were reported in some neighboring Asian countries. In Korea, Hong et al. reported that Ad LRTI-related mortality in a children hospital was 12 % overall and 19 % among patients who were infected with serotype 7 [17]. Residual sequelae were identified in 50 % of the patients who were infected with serotype 3 and in 25 % of those infected with serotype 7. In a Taiwanese study, two out of 48 patients with Ad pneumonia died and five had permanent lung damage, while there was no mortality nor long-term sequelae found in the non-Ad group [12]. While traditionally serotypes 3 and 7 were well known to cause more severe respiratory infections, there were occasional reports on other serotypes which could be potentially associated with severe infections. For example, in the review by Lee et al. [20], serotype 8 was one risk factor for severe respiratory infection in Korea, while serotype 4 was identified as an important pathogen responsible for the fatal childhood pneumonia in South China [27]. The reason why a certain strain of Ad in some populations was more virulent and damaging to the growing lung was not understood clearly. It was speculated that host variation in immune response and the local virulence of the specific serotype might both play a part [10, 23, 35].",

It was no longer detected in 2003\u20132004 among our hospitalized children after the apparent small epidemic in 2001. We could not ascertain whether this might reflect an increasing trend of herd immunity in the community, resulting in lesser case severity. Lee et al. also observed a decreasing size of subsequent epidemics after a large outbreak of serotype 7 [20]. This could partly account for the milder disease phenotype associated with Ad infection during the study period in our locality.",

Firstly, there was no assurance of standardized documentation relating to the history, physical findings, and radiological interpretation because this was a retrospective study. Secondly, our study was confined to a single centre and the result might not be extrapolated beyond our local community. Thirdly, the neutralization test only routinely tested for serotypes 1 to 7 as these serotypes were considered to be most frequently associated with respiratory disease. It meant that other serotypes (constituted 6.3 % of the total cases) were not serotyped, though the majority of them only caused URTI. The neutralization test also might not be able to type virus isolates containing coinfections with multiple Ad serotypes. Such coinfections, even by serotypes 1\u20137, might appear non-neutralizable by the serotype-specific sera and would be falsely categorized as non-1\u20137 serotype. Fourthly, although we had tried to exclude the possible impact of co-infections by other pathogens in the analysis of the clinical disease spectrum, viruses such as human metapneumovirus, coronavirus, and rhinovirus and atypical bacteria such as mycoplasma and chlamydia were not tested for. Lastly, it was postulated that Ad might persist and be shed for prolonged periods and thus positive cell cultures for Ad might not represent an etiological link with disease. However, direct immunofluorescence assay from nasopharyngeal aspirate was known to have lower sensitivity than the cell culture method. Currently, there is no good diagnostic test to ascertain acute Ad infection as seroconversion test is not available in most clinical settings.",

Apart from revealing the local serotype pattern and epidemiology, we have shown that Ad generally did not cause severe acute respiratory disease in our young children and long-term pulmonary sequelae was comparatively infrequent, but as the clinical manifestations of Ad infections mimicked bacterial infections, it often led to unnecessary hospital admissions and antibiotic use. Children aged between 1 and 2 years were most at risk for LRTI. Serotypes 2 and 3 were the most prevalent serotypes among our hospitalized children, and they seemed to have a predilection for different age groups and with different resultant respiratory illness association. A longer study period over time is needed to monitor the serotype pattern and disease complication for better understanding and prognostication of Ad infections in the region and to better delineate the potential complex relationship between serotype virulence, host factor, and resultant disease phenotype.",
