The publication of this second theme issue attests to the frequency, visibility, and attention that these diseases are receiving. A year ago, we (Figures 1, 2, 3) commented on several prevailing factors worldwide that facilitate the emergence of zoonotic infectious diseases, among them a growing human population, increased interaction between species, global climate changes, and rapid movement of people and animals (1). These factors continue to exert their influence, and we continue to see a plethora of emerging zoonotic infectious diseases.",

In the United States, understanding the potential threat for zoonotic disease outbreaks in natural disaster settings, local and state agencies and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have worked in partnership with nongovernmental and other federal agencies to augment surveillance systems to allow for early detection and response to potential rodent- and insect-borne infectious disease threats (3).",

Lymphocytic choriomeningitis and West Nile virus have been transmitted through organ transplantation, and outbreaks of Salmonella spp. have been traced back to pet rodents (8\u201310).
