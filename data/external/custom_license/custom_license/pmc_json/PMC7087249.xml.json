            "text": "Porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is an enteropathogenic coronavirus. Like other coronaviruses, it is a pleomorphic enveloped virus that contains a large, positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome [20]. It is a major pathogen that replicates in the cytoplasm of villous epithelial cells in the small intestine, leading to severe villous atrophy and malabsorptive diarrhea and resulting in significant economic losses in the swine industry, where the mortality rates may reach 100% in the newborn piglets [23]. TGEV was identified as an etiological agent of transmissible gastroenteritis in swine in the United States in 1946 [7] and was reported in many swine-producing countries between the late 1970s and the 1980s, including England, Japan, China, Belgium, Africa and Australia [13, 28, 34]. The genomic sequence length is about 28.5 kb [33]. The genome contains nine open reading frames (ORFs) encoding four structural proteins (spike [S], envelope [E], membrane [M] and nucleoprotein [N]) and five nonstructural proteins (replicase 1a and 1b, 3a, 3b, and protein 7) arranged in the genome in the order 5\u2032-replicase (1a/1b)-S-3a-3b-E-M-N-7-3\u2032 [9].",

            "text": "About two-thirds of the coronavirus genome is devoted to encoding the viral replicase, which mediates coronavirus replication, transcription and translation [21]. The ORF1 region of the replicase gene is composed of two opening frames, ORF1a and ORF1b, and the translation of the ORF1a/1b polyprotein involves an efficient ribosomal frameshifting activity [27]. The S protein is highly glycosylated and is believed to be the viral attachment protein. It interacts with porcine aminopeptidase N, which acts as a cell receptor for TGEV [17]. The interaction between coronavirus S protein and eIF3f plays a functional role in controlling the expression of host genes, especially genes that are induced during coronavirus infection [35]. PRCV has a large deletion in the S gene, resulting in the loss of major antigenic sites B and C in the S protein [10]. The cell-culture-passaged TGEV strain TOY56 has point mutations in the spike gene that cause a shift from intestinal to respiratory tract tropism [29]. The mutation in the spike protein may be an important indicator for evaluating the tropism and virulence of TGEV. The M protein, the main virion membrane protein, is mainly embedded in the lipid vesicle membrane and is connected to the capsular membrane during viral nucleocapsid assembly [15]. The E protein is a membrane-spanning protein, while the N protein is found within the viral membrane. The N protein has been shown to interfere with interferon signaling through various mechanisms [16, 19]. It has also been observed that the N protein of several coronaviruses can localize in the nucleolus, where it may perturb cell cycle activities of the host cell for the benefit of viral mRNA synthesis [6, 37]. The ORF3 is composed of two opening frames, ORF3a and ORF3b, and deletions in ORF3a are found in many TGEV strains and strain PRCV [14, 22]. Some studies have suggested that while ORF3a is not essential for virulence, the deletion of this gene may affect viral virulence and tissue tropism [32]. The ORF7 counteracts host-cell defenses and affects TGEV persistence, increasing TGEV survival through the negative modulation of downstream caspase-dependent apoptotic pathways [3, 4].",

The 5\u2032 portion of the genome (nt 1-20,368) contained the 314-nt non-translated region (NTR), ORF1a (nt 315-12,368), and ORF1b (nt 12,326-20,368) encoding the viral RNA-dependent RNA replicase. The structural proteins S, E, M and N were found to be encoded by ORFs S (nt 20,365-24,708), E (nt 25,857-26,110), M (nt 26,035-26,904), and N (nt 26,917-28,065), respectively. The three non-structural proteins were ORF3a (nt 24,827-25,042), ORF3b (nt 25,136-25,870), ORF7 (nt 28,071-28,307), respectively. The 5\u2019 NTR consisted of 314 nt and included a potential short AUG-initiated ORF (nt 114-121), beginning within a Kozak context (UCUaugA) (Fig. 1a). The 3\u2032 end of the genome contained a 264-nt untranslated sequence and the poly (A) tail. At nt 106-113 upstream from the poly(A) tail, there was an octameric sequence of \u201cGGAAGAGC\u201d (Fig. 1b).\n",

It was shown that a G residue at position 655 of the S protein was essential for maintaining enteric tropism of the TGEV strain PUR46-MADand mutation of this nucleotide caused a shift in tropism from enteric to respiratory [30]. As shown in Fig. 3a, at position 655, all TGEV strains contain a G, except strain PRCV-ISU-1, showing that strain SHXB is an enteric virus. Antigenic site A/B has been mapped to aa 506-706 of the spike protein [11]. At nt position 1753, a T-to-G mutation caused a serine-to-alanine mutation at amino acid 585, which is located in the main major antigenic sites A/B of the TGEV S protein [5]. This change may significantly influence receptor binding or interactions with neutralizing antibody. A single amino acid change in the S protein can have a significant effect on antigenicity [36]. Analyzing the S gene sequence of strain SHXB, we found that the nucleotide at position 1753 was G, indicating that the antigenicity of the S protein may be changed. There was a 6-nt (nt 1,223 to 1,228) deletion in the Purdue strains group, except strain Virulent Purdue, but not in the Miller strains group, strain PRCV-ISU-1, and strain PUR46-MAD. Purdue P115 is attenuated, and this deletion may also play a role in attenuation and is a distinguishing mark of the attenuated Purdue strains group. The same deletion was found in the S protein of attenuated Purdue strain PUR46-C8 but was not found in strain PUR46-C11, which was maintained in vivo [26].

Some researchers have found the phenomenon of large nucleotide deletions in the ORF3 gene [22], indicating that deletions in the ORF3 gene may affect the virulence of TGEV [25], but some researchers have found that these deletions in ORF3 gene do not affect virus replication [18], and this suggests that the ORF3a gene is not necessary for viral replication and has a minor effect in the virulence of virus [32]. Two large deletions were only found in the Miller strains group, except strain Virulent Purdue, a phenomenon that may also distinguish between the Miller strains group and the Purdue strains group.",

These mutations and recombination lead to the generation of new coronaviruses and may alter their pathogenicity, change tissue tropism, and even break the barrier between host species. The SARS-CoV-like coronaviruses of bats may have potentially become adapted to humans through genomic mutation and recombination events either directly or via intermediate hosts [12]. The evolution and tissue tropism shift between strains TGEV and PRCV had been described previously [31]. Homology comparisons and phylogenetic analysis help us to understand the evolution of strain SHXB, and homology comparisons showed that strains PUR46-MAD, Purdue-P115, SC-Y, TGEV-HX, Virulent Purdue, and WH-1 are highly similar to SHXB. The nucleotide and amino acid sequence homology of structural proteins and non-structural proteins between 97 %-100 %, especially in the ORF3a gene, showed significant species specificity. Phylogenetic analysis also showed that strain SHXB is closely related to with strains PUR46-MAD, Purdue-P115, SC-Y, TGEV-HX, Virulent Purdue and WH-1, which have the same ancestor, and this is consistent with the results of homology comparison. Strain PUR46-MAD is a derivative of Purdue P115, and both were derived from the strain Virulent Purdue, Therefore, these isolates cluster together in the phylogenetic tree. As shown in Fig. 4, the other branch included Miller strains and Chinese strain TS, attenuated H, and H16, which were from different evolutionary group, but all TGEV strains shared a common ancestor with PRCV-ISU-1.",

It has also been found that the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs are critically important for viral replication and transcription. By comparing these regions with those of other TGEV strains, we have gained further understanding of the genetic structure, diversity, and evolution of strain SHXB, as well as other coronaviruses. Future studies could involve generating specific mutants by using reverse genetics and characterizing these mutants in animal experiments.",
