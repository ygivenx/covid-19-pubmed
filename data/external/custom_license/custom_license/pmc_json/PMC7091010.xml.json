For centuries it was assumed that these viral diseases were spread primarily through direct patient contact or by the airborne route, and surrounding environment played little or no role in disease transmissions. Due to the opinion that nosocomial infections were not related to microbial contamination of surfaces, the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) and the American Hospital Association focussed only on patient diagnosis up to 1987. Over the years studies have changed perspectives on viral transmission and have integrated a more complex multifactorial model of disease spreading including the contaminated environment (Boone and Gerba 2007).",

During indirect transmission, contaminated surfaces can play an important role. This kind of transmission is dependent on several factors, which include the quantity of viral particles excreted by an infected organism, their stability in the environment, the potential to spread within a closed environment, as well as interaction of the virus and the host organism. Large numbers of viral particles can be shed via various body fluids including blood, faeces, vomit, saliva, urine, and respiratory secretions from infected individuals or carriers. The more viruses are shed, the greater their chance is to survive and reach a new host organism (Rzezutka and Cook 2004).",

Rapid spread of viral infections through contaminated surfaces is common particularly in crowded indoor establishments such as schools, day-care facilities, nursing homes, business offices, hospitals or transport systems (Barker et al. 2001). The influences of environmental factors on the stability and spread of bacterial infections are well documented, especially in hospitals. The comparable knowledge concerning the role of surfaces or fomites in viral transmission is still lacking and further investigation is needed (Boone and Gerba 2007; von Rheinbaben et al. 2000).",

These agents cause gastroenteritis, and include members of genus: Rotavirus, Norovirus, Astrovirus and Adenovirus. Viral gastroenteritis is usually relatively mild disease, which has a short incubation period (1\u20134 days) depending on the virus species. Specific symptoms are diarrhoea and vomiting. Most infected people do not consult a medical practitioner. Therefore, the majority of cases is not reported and subsequently investigated.Capable of multiplying elsewhere in the body. These viruses include enteroviruses (e.g. poliovirus or Coxsackievirus), hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis E virus (HEV). Infection by enteroviruses is often subclinical but they may induce signs and symptoms of disease in not related with intestinal tissue. The infections caused by hepatitis viruses affect liver tissue (Carter 2005).\n",

Examples of survival variation within the genus are coronaviruses OC43 and 229E.

Moe and Shirley (1982) reported that rotavirus infectivity decreases more rapidly under all RH at 37\u00b0C than at 4 or 20\u00b0C. According to a study done by Sattar et al. (1986), rotaviruses can persist longer at a lower temperature (4\u00b0C) and RH (25\u201350%), with approximately 10% infectious virus remaining after 10 days, in comparison to less than 1% after 2 days at 22\u00b0C and 85% RH. Abad et al. (2001) investigated the survival of an astrovirus at 4 and 20\u00b0C with a high RH (90 \u00b1 5%). At 4\u00b0C, the virus was able to persist for 60 days desiccated on non-porous material and for 90 days on porous material. Faster decay was observed at 20\u00b0C. Short-term survival of astrovirus was compared to that observed for other enteric viruses significant for health, such as rotavirus, adenovirus, poliovirus and HAV. Overall, astrovirus persisted better than poliovirus and adenovirus, although they exhibited a shorter survival than the rotavirus and HAV.",

Freezing for 3 months had a limited effect on HAV and rotavirus in all tested food products.

Results were comparable to enteroviruses (Gerba et al. 2002), less effective than for vegetative bacteria, but more effective than for phage MS2 (Husman et al. 2004), adenoviruses (Gerba et al. 2002; Nwachuku et al. 2005), and Baccilus subtilis spores (Chang et al. 1985). Parallel analysis of four RNA virus models (poliovirus 1, phage MS2, phage GA and phage Q\u03b2) showed that the least resistant virus to UV radiation was poliovirus 1. Q\u03b2 phage had intermediate sensitivity, whilst MS2 and GA phages were the most resistant. The rate of RNA degradation increased linearly with increasing fragment size, except viruses with a similar size of genome (poliovirus 1 and MS2). Based on these results, viral resistance to UV depends especially on fragment size of viral nucleic acid. Nevertheless, it also shows that the viral capsid structure has an important protective role against UV radiation (Simonet and Gantzer 2006).",

Interactions that take place between viruses and surfaces are determined by their characteristics and involve electrostatic, hydrophobic interactions, and/or ionic strength (Hurst et al. 1980; Lacroix-Gueu et al. 2005). Vega et al. (2008) compared the relative contributions of these interactions with the nonspecific attachment of echovirus 11, FCV, MS2, and \u03c6X174 to butterhead lettuce.

Kiseleva (1971) reported that strains of poliomyelitis virus, echovirus and coxsackievirus remained infectious from two to more than 12 days on the surface of substances used in various household objects. The greater survival was observed, if the inoculum also contained coliform bacteria, proteins, fats and dust particles, but no precise results or experimental details were given (Kiseleva 1971 as quoted by Rzezutka and Cook 2004). Lee et al. (2008) found that murine norovirus is more stable in a stool suspension than on different types of surfaces. After 30 days of incubation at 18\u00b0C, there was a 2.7-log10 reduction in the stool suspension, compared to the maximum reduction of 5.3-log10 on a gauze or diaper surface. A study by Abad et al. (1994) showed that on non-porous surfaces, poliovirus and adenovirus persist better in the presence of faeces. However, on porous fomites the presence of faecal material has a negative influence on the survival of these viruses. HAV and human rotavirus persistence is not affected by the presence of faeces.",

(1980) measured the effects of several environmental conditions on virus persistence in soil. They found that the temperature and virus adsorption to soil is more important for virus survival than the effect of pH. Enteric viruses are able to survive severe conditions in the gastrointestinal tract, such as low pH in stomach or high bile concentration. They are generally most stable near pH 7, but prefer low pH\u2019s (3\u20135) rather than alkaline pH\u2019s (9\u201312). It was shown that noroviruses are able to persist at pH 2.7 and room temperature more than 3 h (Duizer et al. 2004). As the surface charge of viral particles varies depending on the pH, disruption of electrostatic interactions between viral particles and environmental surfaces commonly consists of changing the pH, and thus affect viral persistence in the environment (Gerba 1984).",

The first experiment was conducted in order to determine the effect of MLSS on the recovery of poliovirus after a different period of time. The second experiment was designed to find out the role of different MLSS components in virus loss. Results of these studies indicate that MLSS contain a component(s) which can inactivate poliovirus 1. These components were pelleted during centrifugation, destroyed by autoclaving, and removed by filtration. Consecutively, residual activity of an MLSS supernatant fraction was also studied to confirm the absence of antiviral activity in non-living heat-sensitive material in the MLSS. Subsequent increasing activity of this supernatant, coupled with the previous results, strongly indicates the antiviral activity of some microbial species. Deng and Cliver (1992) demonstrated the antiviral effect of several bacterial cultures from swine manure slurry and mixed septic tank effluent. These cultures were identified as Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus\nepidermidis, Bacillus sp. and Streptococcus sanguis group. A comparison of poliovirus 1 inactivation in raw mixed waste, autoclaved mixed waste, and bacterium-free filtrate of raw mixed waste demonstrated that virus inactivation is related, at least in part, to microbial activity in similar environmental conditions. Inhibition of poliovirus 1 inactivation by protease inhibitors suggested that antiviral activity of mixed waste was partially due to proteolytic enzymes produced by bacteria in wastes.",

Recent studies have revealed that, even in the absence of specific enzymatic reactions, viral particles are able to penetrate inside the EPS structure of mucoid biofilms. After penetration inside the polymeric matrix, the viruses may take advantage from the specific \u2018biofilm lifestyle\u2019, and benefit from protection against environmental stress, such as desiccation or other actions of antimicrobial agents. Moreover during biofilms erosion or sloughing, protected immobilised viral particles may be released in the environment, and then contact their target host commencing the viral infectious cycle (Briandet et al. 2008; Helmi et al. 2008; Lacroix-Gueu et al. 2005; Lehtola et al. 2007; Quignon et al. 1997).

Infectious viral particles were detected in the drinking water biofilm for up to 6 days after inoculation, whilst the viral genome was still detectable at day 34. Hock and Botzenhart (2002, 2003) injected phages MS2, \u03c6X174 and poliovirus 1 at comparable concentrations into a laboratory reactor containing approximately 100 ml of drinking water. After the contact time of 1 h, concentrations of 0.04, 0.13 and 0.27% were recovered from the biofilm. MS2 showed less adsorption to the biofilm than \u03c6X174 and poliovirus 1 (Hock and Botzenhart 2002; Hock and Botzenhart 2003 as quoted by Skraber et al. 2005). These results can be explained by the fact that MS2 is more negatively charged than other tested viruses. In contrast, Storey and Ashbolt (2003a, b) estimated that the attachment rates of MS2 and \u03c6X174 were similar: 1% of the initial input. The efficiency of viral recovery was predetermined for MS2, but not for \u03c6X174 or poliovirus in the mentioned studies. Due to this fact, differences or similarities between apparent attachments can be explained by variation between efficiencies of viral recovery.",

Results indicated that the subpopulation of approximately 0.01% of phages had the potential to persist over 100 days for B40-8 and almost 10 times longer for MS2 in the presence of free chlorine.

Viruses can be trapped within the matrix, especially if the surface is porous (Scherer et al. 2009). Therefore, sampling and detection methods must be sensitive enough to detect low levels of viral particles. Cell culture methods are sensitive and can determine infectivity of isolated viral particles, but these methods are time consuming. Moreover, there is a problem of interference amongst viruses, which are able to grow on the same cell line (e.g. reovirus and enterovirus) or can allow chronic infections without a visible cytopathic effect (e.g. HAV or reovirus). Even if this cytopathic effect is evident, the identification of isolated agents requires additional techniques for confirmation of virus strain or type. Finally, cultivation methods cannot be used for non-cell culture viruses (e.g. HEV). For enumeration of infectious viruses it is necessary to use cell culture in a quantitative format, e.g. plaque assay. The number of infectious viruses remaining in the sample is compared with the number which was introduced, and a statistical procedure can be performed to calculate any degree of decline.",

Nevertheless, analyses may be hindered by inhibitory substances present in the environment, so there is a risk of occurrence of false negative results. Due to this fact it is necessary to implement internal amplification controls. Moreover viruses detected by these techniques are not necessary infectious. Molecular methods can reveal nucleic acid originating from partially denatured viral particles. Thus, viral capsid is still capable of protecting nucleic acid, but the viral particle is not infectious. Therefore, the combination of molecular techniques and cell culture methods should be used for the detection of viruses (Cliver 2009; Cook 2003).",
