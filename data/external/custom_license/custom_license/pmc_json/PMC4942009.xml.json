Although the sample size was small, compared to other general practice\u2013based surveys, it would be considered reasonable in the light of the challenges with surveying this population.\n34\n, \n35\n There is potential for selection bias in this study towards those who are particularly concerned about influenza and/or vaccination or those who accept vaccination. Furthermore, using self\u2010reported vaccination status in adults has been shown to overestimate coverage.\n36\n, \n37\n There may also be limitations with generalisability because our study was conducted only in one state of Australia. This study did not collect any data on non\u2010respondents or outcomes for those who intended to be vaccinated in 2009. In addition, the barriers in our survey may not have covered all possible options, thus may have influenced participants response. Qualitative research is needed to further explore these findings.",

Understanding barriers to vaccination is the first step to developing effective strategies to overcome them. For institution\u2010based HCWs, there is now an extensive literature base around knowledge, attitudes and practices towards influenza vaccination, whereas, there are only a few studies exploring these topics in the primary health care setting in Australia. To enhance development and targeting of strategies to increase coverage, a more complete and current understanding of coverage in this group is needed to build on the estimates presented here. We believe this study to be a basis for future investigations and interventions to increase influenza vaccination rates in primary health care staff in Australia.",
