The country's disease-surveillance system was slow to recognize and report the new syndrome, and the magnitude of the threat was not, at first, fully appreciated. The problem was exacerbated because health officials did not, initially, handle the burgeoning epidemic with the transparency that the crisis required. A chance to nip the outbreak in the bud was lost, and the consequences were devastating for both China and the rest of the world.",

It also spread by air travel, quickly surfacing in places such as Vietnam, Singapore, Taiwan and Canada. SARS was recognized as a new disease by medical professionals in Hong Kong and international health officials working in Vietnam. With unprecedented speed, the causative agent was isolated and identified as a previously unknown form of coronavirus.",

In the end, the political will to end the epidemic was impressive, and the new openness in addressing the disease was refreshing. By launching a concerted public-health effort that included draconian measures such as quarantine, China brought SARS under control faster than anyone could have predicted \u2014 the outbreak was over by that summer. The success was not only commendable, but a testament to Chinese resourcefulness once a clear path is apparent. But China \u2014 and the world \u2014 paid a high price: cities were paralysed for months, billions of dollars were lost, more than 8,000 people were infected, and about 800 lives taken.",

Sufficient resources must be allocated to train enough professionals to safeguard against epidemic diseases. Currently, too few of China's health workers have been properly trained to carry out the task. It is imperative that a cadre of medical and public-health officers are formally trained in special programmes, such as those at the Epidemiologic Intelligence Service of the US Centers for Disease Control or at the World Health Organization's office in Lyon. Trained individuals could, in turn, mentor others and so build the critical mass of professionals necessary to rejuvenate the Chinese disease-surveillance network.",

Anything of concern should be rapidly disseminated to physicians and public-health specialists so that they are on the alert for similar illnesses or infections. When appropriate, such warnings should also go to government leaders, the media and international health agencies. To avert or blunt another catastrophe like SARS, China urgently needs a more efficient and transparent instrument to spot early disease outbreaks and to propagate the warning.",

First, China must make microbial threats to health a top priority in its national research agenda. Greater financial resources should be given to microbiologists in academic institutions and government research units. This sort of commitment will undoubtedly result in a higher level of technical competence, which will be valuable during any serious microbial outbreak. A larger critical mass of experts could provide strategic advice and diagnostic tools to fight an epidemic. It could also help develop the therapies and vaccines needed to end the threat. Second, healthcare infrastructure has suffered years of neglect. Among the adverse consequences is a relatively low level of proficiency among physicians in China. This deficit will in turn allow certain epidemics to escape early detection, because these doctors are the first line of defence.",

Another flu pandemic is not only inevitable, but overdue. There is no better time to prepare for this eventuality than now, as an aggressive influenza virus, H5N1, has been continuously plaguing avian species over the past two years in about a dozen Asian countries, including China.",

Fortunately, this virus has yet to acquire the ability to transmit from person to person (with a few exceptions); otherwise, we would be facing a pandemic already. Nevertheless, the current situation is of grave concern. Chinese scientists have already isolated H5N1 from nasal secretions of pigs, a species that can replicate both avian and human influenza viruses. It is only a matter of time before H5N1 and a human influenza virus mix and \u2018reassort\u2019 in porcine hosts to yield a new virulent strain that is capable of human-to-human transmission. It seems as though all the essential elements are now in place to produce a new influenza pandemic, most likely emerging from southeast Asia or China.",

In August 2004, the US government released its national pandemic preparedness plan, broadly outlining the actions that will be taken. Various deficiencies were emphasized, including difficulties in implementing certain public-health measures such as quarantine. Despite its technical superiority, the United States faces a major shortfall in manufacturing the right vaccine and in stockpiling anti-influenza drugs. An estimated 89,000 to 207,000 Americans will die in the next pandemic. What would the death toll be in China?",

There is little doubt that China will be in deep trouble if the flu pandemic were to strike in the next few years.

HIV/AIDS reached China in the mid-1980s, but the significant spread began in 1989 among injecting drug users in the southwest province of Yunnan. Following the tracks of heroin, this deadly virus spread to the adjacent provinces of Guangxi and Sichuan, and to the northwest autonomous region of Xinjiang. In addition, a separate HIV/AIDS epidemic exploded in the 1990s in Henan and neighbouring provinces, where unsanitary blood collection led to the infection of countless poor farmers.",

Ultimately, this vital priority will only be attained if the national epidemic surveillance system is significantly upgraded. More emerging infections are inevitable, as the past century attests.
