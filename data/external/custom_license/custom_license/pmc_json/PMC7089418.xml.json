However, there is scarce information on the epidemiology of enteropathogens because in most of the diarrhea outbreaks diagnosis is restricted to clinical and macro-pathological examinations (Cabrera and Garc\u00eda 2009), which are tentative rather than specific diagnosis tools (Elicker et al. 2010). Also, limited research on porcine enteropathogens has been performed during the last 20 years in Cuban piggeries (Fuentes et al. 2001; Barrera et al. 2005; Blanco et al. 2006).",

The herd of the 6 piggeries together comprised 5,252 sows and 7,455 suckling piglets; the number of newly weaned piglets was not specifically controlled on the herd book. All piggeries followed a similar continuous flow management (farrow-to-finish) without straw bedding; they had similar facilities, used the same antibiotics, and shared breeding stock animals routinely. Pregnant sows were housed individually, and at the end of gestation, they were moved up to elevated farrowing crates with completely perforated plastic flooring.
