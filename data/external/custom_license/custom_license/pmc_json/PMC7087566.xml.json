In poultry, the disease is controlled through the use of vaccines and biosafety measures, including avoidance of contact with wild birds. Upon vaccination, IBV generates antigenic variants that can result in incomplete protection (Cavanagh 2005).",

Briefly, the nPCR was performed as follows: the first reaction was performed in a 25-\u03bcL volume containing 20 ng of cDNA with primers (CoV-F1 and CoV-R1). The cycling conditions were 5 min at 95 \u00b0C, 40 cycles of 45 s at 94 \u00b0C, 40 s at 49 \u00b0C, 45 s at 72 \u00b0C and a final incubation at 72 \u00b0C for 7 min. For the second (nested) reaction, we used 2 \u03bcL of the first reaction under the same amplification conditions of the first PCR, but using primers CoV-F2 and CoV-R2 in the assay.",

Sequences recovered from dabbling and whistling ducks were closely related to sequences isolated from gulls in Russia (Muradrasoli et al. 2010), sharing up to 93 % of similarity on the nucleotide level. The fact that some sequences were more closely related to IBV strains highlights the question on the original reservoirs of IBV, if domesticated or wild birds (Hughes et al. 2009). The majority of the sequences here detected were phylogenetically related to avian CoVs detected in rock sandpipers (Eroliaptilocnemis). These related sequences were reported in the Commander Island, Russian Federation (Muradrasoli et al. 2010), highlighting not only its potential of geographic distribution but the interspecies transmission, as such, very similar viruses can be detected in different avian species: ducks, plovers, herons, weavers, waders, small water birds, and painted snipes.

Although it is hard to predict, it would be possible that many migratory species could have previous contact with migrating birds from Western/Central Siberia, Balkans, Black Sea, and Central Asia which use the East Africa flyways to reach wintering areas to rest along the river systems crossing the Arabian Peninsula and the Nile (BirdLife International 2014b).",
