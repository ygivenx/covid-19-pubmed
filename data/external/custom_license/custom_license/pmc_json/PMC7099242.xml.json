At this rate, this percentage is likely to rise considerably with the number of international travelers expected to increase to several billions by 2020. Although the aircraft cabin is similar to other semi-contained indoor environments, such as homes and offices, in that individuals are exposed to a combination of external and recirculated air, it varies greatly from these environments with respect to occupant density, the inability of occupants to leave at will and the need for pressurization. Furthermore, while in flight, travelers encounter a combination of constantly regulated environmental factors including low humidity, reduced air pressure and potential exposure to chemical contaminants, such as ozone, carbon monoxide, various organic compounds and biological agents.",

One concern was the microbiological burden in enclosed environments, where passengers breathe continuously recycled air. The air provided to the passengers and crew on commercial jet aircraft is typically a combination of external air brought in through the engines and air that is taken from the cabin, filtered and recirculated. The environmental control system is designed to minimize the introduction of harmful contaminants into the cabin and to control cabin pressure, ventilation, temperature and humidity. An NRC report (NRC, 2002) found that most commercial jet airlines provide an ample supply of air to pressurize the cabin, meeting general comfort conditions and diluting or otherwise reducing normally occurring odors, heat and contaminants. The committee noted, however, that the current design standard of a minimum of 0.55 lb of outside air per minute per occupant (Federal Aviation Regulation: 25.831) is less than one-half to two-thirds the ventilation rate recommended in American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers Standard 62\u20131999, which was developed for ground structures.",

However, recent concerns regarding the transmission of emerging diseases on commercial airliners, SARS and tuberculosis in particular, have brought much attention to the monitoring and control of cabin air quality aboard commercial aircraft (Olsen et al., 2003). Prior to this investigation, knowledge of the microbiological composition in commercial airliner cabin air was limited to a sparse collection of cultivation-based reports (Wick and Irvine, 1995; Dechow et al., 1997; Hines et al., 2003; McKernan et al., 2007). Although these studies have collectively reported a typical microbial burden ranging from 10 to 300 colony-forming units (CFU) per m3, these results are fraught with bias since a majority of all bacteria are not capable of growing in well-defined conventional media (Pace et al., 1985; Amann et al., 1995; Pace, 1997; La Duc et al., 2007a). At best, plate counts offer only relative comparisons between samples and are incapable of definitive estimations of the size or diversity of the molecular communities present.",

Previous work has characterized the sampling efficiency of the BioCapture (BT-550) sampler using monodisperse fluorescent oleic acid particles and monodisperse fluorescent polystyrene latex particles (Kesavan et al., 2003). The results showed that the BT-550 sampler had a peak sampling efficiency for 2-\u03bcm particles and the average peak sampling efficiencies for the sampler was 38% (Kesavan et al., 2003). The flow rate of this light-weight (4.5 kg), field deployable sampler is 150 l min\u20131 (5.3 cubic feet per min). Each 750 l air parcel (roughly equivalent to the volume of air human lungs exchange every 2 h) was impinged into 5 ml of sterile buffered saline by running the sampler for 5 min. The particular sampler utilized in this investigation was retrofitted to operate on seat-supplied AC power in place of manufacturer standard lead-acid batteries.",

Samples were collected over the entire course of each flight, including preboarding and postlanding whenever possible. In each instance, the sampling device was centrally positioned within the seat row, to ensure uniformity of the aerosols, and three replicate samples were taken at each time point. Immediately following sample collection, two replicates were stored on dry ice and a third was placed in a cooler chilled with ice packs to approximately 4 \u00b0C. A total of 110 samples were processed within 24 h for viability assessment (ATP and plate counts). Sample volumes remaining after viability assays were frozen for subsequent DNA extraction and phylogenetic analyses. Samples from flight 4-S (Los Angeles to Sydney, Australia) were subjected to the same DNA-based analyses described below, but the portions that would otherwise have been analyzed using viability assays were instead archived for future study.",

Detailed description of the ATP assay to estimate total and viable microbial population was reported previously (Venkateswaran et al., 2003; La Duc et al., 2007a). It has been documented that for most Gram-negative bacteria, 1 RLU corresponds to approximately 1 CFU, as compared to Gram-positive bacteria where 1 CFU corresponds to roughly 5 RLU (La Duc et al., 2007a). It should also be assumed that in regularly cleaned, low-humidity, HEPA-filtered environments, such as aircraft cabins, cells exist in a suppressed metabolic state and contain less ATP than actively growing cells (Stanley, 1989). Considering these circumstances, we conservatively estimated that a measurement of 1 RLU was approximately equal to 1 CFU (Venkateswaran et al., 2003; La Duc et al., 2004).",

Universal bacterial primers targeting the 16S rRNA gene, 1369F (5\u2032-CGGTGAATACGTTCYCGG-3\u2032) and 1492R (5\u2032-GGWTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3\u2032), and the fluorescent-labeled probe TM1389F (5\u2032-FAM-CTTGTACACACCGCCCGTC-TAMRA-3\u2032) were used in this quantitative analysis (Suzuki et al., 2000, 2001). Each 50 \u03bcl reaction mixture consisted of 25 \u03bcl of 2X Taqman Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA, USA), 0.8 \u03bcM of each oligonucleotide primer, 0.5 \u03bcM of oligonucleotide probe and 1 \u03bcl of template DNA. Reaction conditions were as follows: 95 \u00b0C denaturation for 15 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 15 s and a combined annealing and extension at 60 \u00b0C for 1.5 min.

Each filter unit has a molecular weight cutoff of 50 000 Da allowing isolation of all intact bacterial cells and naked DNA fragments greater than 100 bp. Amicon units were reusable for each sample set, making it possible for all samples from a single flight (\u223c20\u201350 ml) to be concentrated to a volume of 200 \u03bcl in a single filter tube. A comparable amount of sterile, unused cartridge buffer was concentrated in a separate filter tube to act as a control for each extraction. Total DNA was extracted for each concentrated pooling of flight samples using a standard lysozyme/phenol\u2013chloroform procedure (Johnson, 1981; Ausubel et al., 2001). We have previously reported the percent DNA recovery using this solvent-based DNA extraction method for low-biomass samples to be \u223c10% (Bruckner et al., 2005; Bruckner and Venkateswaran, 2007). Briefly, samples were treated with lysozyme (final concentration 10 mg ml\u20131) to degrade cell walls, followed by proteinase K and RNase treatment to remove unwanted biopolymers and finally phenol\u2013chloroform to clean-up cellular debris. DNA was precipitated with two volumes of ice-cold ethanol, washed briefly with 70% ethanol and resuspended in TE buffer (30 \u03bcl) before being stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. Bacterial small subunit rRNA genes (\u223c1.5 kb) were PCR-amplified (1\u20135 \u03bcl template) with a PTC-100 thermal cycler (MJ Research, Waltham, MA, USA) using eubacterially biased primers 8F and 1492R, as described previously (La Duc et al., 2004).",

Viruses (0.01\u20130.02 \u03bcm) and larger bacteria/fungi (0.1\u20131.0 \u03bcm) are retained even more effectively (Aviation-Safety, 2004). Cabin air that has passed through an HEPA filter is considered comparable to the recirculated air used in operating rooms and infectious-disease containment facilities (WHO, 1998). When compared to standard office buildings, the air in a commercial aircraft is exchanged more frequently per hour and has even been described as \u2018sterile\u2019 by investigations carried out using conventional plate-count assays (FSF, 1998). According to the limited reports available, it has been documented that airborne microbial levels within airline cabins are much lower than public areas on the ground (CDC, 1995; Wick and Irvine, 1995). Unfortunately, these culture-based assessments of environmental samples grossly underestimate microbial levels and are ill suited for describing the community structures of the microbial populations that are present (Pace et al., 1985; Pace, 1997). Indeed, biomolecule-based examinations of these \u2018sterile\u2019 air samples collected directly from blowing sources, such as overhead gaspers, revealed high microbial levels and biodiversity, suggestive of biofilm formation in air ducts (La Duc et al., 2007b).",

Statistical analyses failed to detect significant differences between domestic and international flights with respect to both heterotrophic plate counts and total viable microbes, most likely due to constant HEPA filtration, maintaining consistently low levels of airborne microorganisms. Measurements of 16S rRNA gene copy numbers (Figure 2) and total ATP (Figure 3), however, showed large overall variation between domestic and international-bound flights. Linear regression analysis revealed repeated patterns in the levels of total ATP levels present over the course of each flight. Domestic flights (approximately 5 h in duration) and the initial 5 h of international flights typically demonstrated strong downward trends in measures of total ATP, which may be indicative of the progressive elimination of biological agents due to air exchange and continuous HEPA filtration. International flights showed a weaker upward trend in total ATP as flight time progressed beyond the five-hour point, possibly due to increase crew and passenger activity as the destination approached, or differences in air-handling protocols on longer flights. This much weaker association in the later portions of international flights indicates that a more complex set of factors may contribute to cabin cleanliness than can be correlated with the passage of time alone. Because exogenous sources (for example, food particles in the aerosols) could contribute to measurements of total ATP, the results of this assay cannot specifically be attributed to the microbial populations alone. They do, however, suggest that the length of international flight may have an impact on the aggregation of biological material that could, in the absence of HEPA filtration and air exchange, contribute to microbial persistence and proliferation.",

The only exception was the clone libraries from Sydney (8S and 8R-S), which clustered together with high confidence level (91% Jackknife analysis). When four samples collected from two separate trips to Sydney (segments 4 and 8) were subjected to UniFrac analyses, these clone libraries did not form any cluster. Analysis of biodiversity for domestic and international flights indicated vastly different population structures. Figure 5 presents rarefaction curves and the population overlap for domestic and international clone libraries. The rarefaction curve for the domestic aircraft clones (n=522) suggested better coverage of the biodiversity present aboard these aircraft. Despite a smaller number (n=339), clone libraries of international-bound aircraft had a steeper rarefaction curve and demonstrated much greater biodiversity, being distributed among 62 bacterial species, while clones from domestic flights comprised only 42 species. Only 11 species were detected in both sets of clones, representing 26% and 18% of species detected on domestic flights and international flights, respectively. The cultivable bacterial diversity also indicated clustering of bacterial species with flight duration or destination. The isolation of staphylococci and micrococci on both domestic and international samples was expected, since cells in these genera are found in tight association with human skin cells, which are constantly shed. Interestingly, despite expectations that the artificially dry conditions aboard these flights would promote their prevalence, Bacillus isolates were not widely distributed across all flights and were limited almost entirely to longer international flights. It is important to note that while differences in microbial population structures correlated with flight duration, they may also be attributed to varying cabin design and air filtration on domestic and international flights. Internationally operated 747 and 777 airplanes have much larger passenger capacity (approximately two- to threefold) than that of domestically utilized 757 equipment (http://www.boeing.com/commercial). Passenger density as well as potential differences in air handling on larger planes may have significant impact on the biodiversity of air parcels obtained from these flights.",

            "text": "The empirical results of this study indicated the presence of a wide range of opportunistic human-related pathogens, including causative agents of pneumonia, bacteremia, neutropenia and cerebellar lesions (US-HHS-Department, 2003), and passengers and crewmembers are thought to be their principal source (Wick and Irvine, 1995; Dechow et al., 1997). It should be stressed that the retrieval of 16S rRNA gene sequences from these pathogens is not in itself evidence for public health concerns over commercial air travel. The detection of DNA arising from these pathogens does not imply viability, and the human pathogens detected in plate-count assay were overwhelmingly opportunistic, posing little threat to healthy individuals. Furthermore, the combination of engineering controls built into commercial aircraft, including frequent air exchange, HEPA filtration and directed cabin airflow (Aviation-Safety, 2004), as well as our own cultivation and viable microbial measurements (Figure 1) suggests that exposure to disease-causing microbes in doses sufficient for infection is unlikely during normal airline travel. Although high prevalence of health issues among travelers and aircraft crew members has been reported (Low and Chan, 2002; Whelan et al., 2003), these reports did not account for other factors that could be responsible for this correlation, such as travel-related stress on the immune system, or transient responses to environmental conditions within the air cabin. Recent studies have shown, for example, that symptoms experienced by air travelers, especially on flights greater than 3 h, may stem from low humidity (Nagda and Hodgson, 2001; Leder and Newman, 2005), and that increasing the humidity of the air cabin by as little as 3% is sufficient to significantly alleviate physical symptoms commonly reported by air crew (Norback et al., 2006).",
