The intrinsic genetic instability of the virus results from its high mutability and genetic reassortment, combined with interspecies transmission, establishment of host-specific lineages and geographical separation of host species has led to a considerable genetic and antigenic heterogeneity and evolutionary diversity. Therefore, the development of universal methods to detect as many genetic variants of the virus as possible is of crucial importance for IA virus surveillance, especially in avian species, which are considered the natural reservoir of IA virus [11, 14, 19].",

Conventionally, these RT-PCR screening methods were designed to detect IA virus on a universal basis by amplifying a selected portion of the membrane protein (MP) gene segment [3\u20135, 9, 11, 16, 18, 21]. The MP gene segment is a bicistronic RNA molecule encoding two proteins, M1 and M2. The gene that encodes the M1 protein is considered to be highly conserved across various IA virus subtypes and host species. Nevertheless, phylogenetic analysis of a large panel of MP sequences has revealed that the sequence conservation is at the amino acid rather than the nucleotide sequence level, where the latter exhibits significant variation in both the M1 and M2 genes [8, 20]. Accordingly, mutations in the MP gene segment result predominantly in synonymous codon changes, mostly in the M1 gene [8, 17, 20], which constitutes 73.6% of the whole segment.",

The bioinformatic analysis predicted that sequences for the forward and reverse primers match over 97% of the over 10,000 IA virus sequences tested. Thus, the sequence complementarity was not absolute, even at the strongly conserved positions. Such IA virus strains were highly suspected of being escape mutants in the SVIP-MP assay. To test our assay for universality at the experimental level we used an original approach. Due to experimental limitations, mutated primers mimicking the original mutations were synthesized rather than preparing mutated MP sequences. In spite this experimental shift, we expect that this mechanism may act vice versa. The experiments confirmed that all mutated primers amplified the RNA standard successfully, but deviations in C\nt were observed. These deviations ranged from 3.1, 4.2 and 3.6 C\nt values for mutated forward and 3, 2.9 and 2.8 for mutated reverse primers, respectively, observed at three dilutions (102, 104 and 106 copies/reaction).
