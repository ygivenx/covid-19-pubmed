Sampling took place over 3 consecutive years: 2008, 2009, and 2010. The sampling site was the attic of a private house in a suburban area in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, western Germany (Figure 1). The study did not involve any direct manipulations of bats and relied entirely on collection of fecal samples from the attic floor. Classification of bats as Myotis myotis was confirmed by mitochondrial DNA typing as described (9). Adult female bats leaving the roost were counted by trained field biologists before and after parturition. Pups were counted in the sampling site after the departure of adults. For each sampling date, plastic film was spread in the evening on the ground of a 20-m2 attic compartment, and fresh droppings were collected with clean disposable forks the following night. Each sample consisted of exactly 5 fecal pellets collected in proximity and added to RNAlater RNA preservative solution (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). The equivalent of \u2248100 mg was purified by the Viral RNA kit (QIAGEN) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions.",

All 4 described real-time RT-PCR assays showed comparable lower limits of detection in the single copy range. Twenty-five\u2013microliter reactions used the SuperScript III PlatinumOne-Step qRT-PCR Kit (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) for detecting CoVs and AstVs in M. myotis bats or the Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase Kit (Invitrogen) for detecting AdVs in M. myotis bats. Reactions were generally composed as follows: 400 nmol/L of the respective primers, 200 nmol/L of the respective hydrolysis probe, 0.5 \u00b5L enzyme mix or 0.1 \u00b5L Platinum Taq, 1 \u00b5g bovine serum albumin, and 5 \u00b5L RNA/DNA extract. For AdV DNA PCR, supplements of 0.2 mmol/L of each dNTP and 2.0 mmol/L of MgCL were added. Amplification involved 15 min at 55\u00b0C for reverse transcription of RNA viruses and 3 min at 95\u00b0C, followed by 45 cycles of 15 seconds at 94\u00b0C, and 25 seconds at 58\u00b0C for all viruses.

            "text": "The viruses monitored in our study were selected because they are regularly encountered in bats and thus provide a certain chance of detection. Attempts to characterize virus dynamics in bat populations have been made earlier by using the examples of lyssaviruses (rabies virus and related species), filoviruses (Ebola and Marburg viruses) and henipaviruses (Hendra and Nipah viruses). However, because these viruses are found rarely, only vague conclusions have so far been made. For instance, increased contact between bats and humans through bat migratory events or fruit harvesting periods have been temporally linked with individual human cases of Ebola and Nipah virus infection (22,23). One study has shown that the success of Nipah virus isolation from Pteropus spp. bats depended on seasonal factors, which was interpreted as evidence for season-dependent variation of virus concentration or prevalence (24). Furthermore, the reproductive cycle of bats has been tentatively connected with seasonality of henipavirus, filovirus and lyssavirus seropositivity in bats as well as with the temporal distribution of Nipah virus outbreaks in humans (10,12,15,25\u201327). Our direct data on virus concentration and prevalence for CoV and AstV integrate many of these independent observations and provide a model that might be transferable to other viruses. The initial peak in annual CoV and AstV prevalence observed in our study was probably due to the formation of a contiguous population of sufficient size and density, bringing together enough susceptible bats to establish a critical basic reproductive rate of infection (28,29). The second amplification peak after parturition was most probably associated with the establishment of a susceptible subpopulation of newborn bats who had not yet mounted their own adaptive immunity. Sporadic vertical transmission from mothers to pups as observed in Pteropus spp. bats artificially infected with Hendra virus would probably initiate this second wave of infection (30). The main driver of the second wave would then be a horizontal transmission between pups. The latency between parturition and the second wave of virus amplification indicates a certain level of perinatal protection conferred by mothers during the first weeks of life as demonstrated for other small mammals, and as indirectly suggested for bats (13,31\u201333). This protection may be differentially effective against different viruses, as indicated by the differential amplification patterns between CoVs and AstVs. While CoVs were amplified both in 2008 and 2010, AstVs underwent postparturition amplification only in 2010 when a new virus lineage gained predominance in the population. This finding strongly indicates antigen-specific immune control of virus circulation.",

            "text": "A common, but unproven, assumption is that bats are resistant to even highly pathogenic viruses (2,3). In this study, we have correlated direct measurements of virus burden with the reproductive success of a bat colony. The rate of successful reproduction is probably a sensitive indicator of the presence or absence of disease, given the tenuous conditions under which bats breed in temperate climates. Indeed, no effects of CoV and AstV on reproduction were initially apparent; although postparturition amplification of both viruses was more efficient in 2010 than in 2008, the overall breeding success was significantly better in 2010. This result may merely have been a consequence of a positive correlation between virus amplification and colony size, which was larger in 2010 due to better breeding success. On the other hand, the individual prenatal amplification peaks of both CoV and AstV were higher in 2010, which may have enabled better perinatal protection and thus better survival of newborns. The grouping of large numbers of pregnant females before birth is a specific characteristic of bats that may contribute to their puzzling ability to maintain highly pathogenic viruses without experiencing die-offs. Our noninvasive approach did not allow any further analyses such as the testing of blood and colostrum samples for antibodies. Nevertheless, the general picture obtained in this study by correlating virus and bat population dynamics suggests that bats control infections in similar ways to other mammals, and that they may well experience virus epidemics.",

            "text": "Another intriguing finding of our study was the difference in the amplification pattern of the RNA viruses and that of the DNA virus. We selected these viruses because, in humans, AdVs are typically capable of persisting in tissue (34) and thus do not depend so much on continuous transmission and consistent amplification on the population level. Indeed, it appeared that AdV did not make use of periodic amplification in our bat colony. Persistence on the level of individual bats is more common for DNA viruses than for RNA viruses. RNA viruses ensure that they are maintained on a population level by a much higher error rate of the enzymes they use for genome replication and consequent higher levels of antigenic variability, causing waves of epidemic spread as confirmed for bat-borne RNA viruses in this study. This factor can explain why most emerging viruses, including those from bats, are indeed RNA viruses (2,35).",

            "text": "For CoV, our study indicates clearly that virus amplification takes place in maternity colonies, confirming our earlier statistical implications from studies in a different region and on a different species (16). High peak RNA concentrations in the range of 109\u20131010 copies/g were observed, which is tremendously higher than CoV concentrations observed in earlier studies outside the parturition period (19). Similarly high RNA virus concentrations are observed in human diseases transmitted through the fecal-oral route, e.g., picornaviruses or noroviruses, which suggests that maternity roosts may involve an elevated risk of virus transmission to other hosts. It is interesting to reconsider the potential genesis of the SARS epidemic in this light. Although an origin of SARS-related CoV in bats is confirmed (9,36), SARS-CoV precursors have existed in carnivores some time before the SARS epidemic and have been transmitted from carnivores to humans again at least one additional time after the end of the epidemic (37,38). these data provide an intriguing explanation of how the SARS agent may have left its original reservoir (39,40). The data also indicate a feasible and ecologically sensible means of prevention. Because carnivores are known to enter maternity roosts to feed on dead newborn bats, bat maternity roosts should be left undisturbed by humans and kept inaccessible to domestic cats and dogs.",
