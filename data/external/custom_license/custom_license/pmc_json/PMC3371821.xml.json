Phylogenetic analyses of SFVs indicate a species-specific distribution of virus strains not unlike that of SIV among some African primate species (19\u201323). Among captive primate populations, seroprevalence of antibodies to SFV may reach 100% in adults, with many animals seroconverting before the onset of sexual maturity (19,24; J. Allan, unpub. data). Fewer data are available on the seroprevalence of antibodies to SFV among free-ranging populations of primates. SFV is present in highest concentrations in the saliva of infected laboratory macaques (Macaca mulatta and M. fascicularis) and African green monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops), which suggests that bites, scratches, and mucosal splashes with saliva from primates are likely mechanisms of transmission (25\u201327).",

Previous data on both worker and visitor exposure to macaques at monkey temples suggest that human behaviors, especially the practice of feeding macaques, is a risk factor for being bitten or scratched (33,34). We have recommended that monkeys be fed only by specially trained personnel who minimize physical contact with monkeys. Such restrictions have been successfully employed at other monkey forests in Asia. For example, Singapore's Bukit Timah Nature Reserve has nearly 200 free-ranging macaques (M. fascicularis), and in 2002, an estimated 380,000 visitors made use of the reserve's trail system, yet contact between monkeys and visitors at Bukit Timah is rare.

Because many visitors to monkey temples are international travelers, these findings have ramifications for the potential global spread of primateborne infectious agents. Demonstrating natural cross-species transmission in a context that does not involve hunting for bushmeat implies that other contexts of primate-human contact may also facilitate the transmission of simian pathogens. These data point to the need for further research into SFV transmission in other contexts, including pet ownership and performance animals, as well as in the diverse geographic areas where humans and primates come into contact.

The mtDNA tree was created with the neighbor-joining method with the Phylip program (DNAdist; Neighbor). Bootstrap replicates were 1,000. Bootstrap values were calculated by using Seqboot, DNAdist, Neighbor, and Consense (PHYLIP programs). Bootstrap values >60% are shown. The mtDNA tree was plotted in Treeview. This analysis suggests that BH66 was of human origin. Although the phylogenetic tree constructed with mtDNA from a variety of monkey samples can be used to distinguish human from monkey mtDNA, a large number of nuclear mtDNA sequences, have evolved as pseudogenes (36). These sequences can be highly divergent from mtDNA and resulted in some ambiguity as mtDNA amplified from several monkeys did not group with other members of the same species. Because of the nature and variability of these sequences, definitive conclusions about mtDNA phylogenies could not be determined; however, mtDNA trees were still useful for determining the origin of mtDNA material.",
