It is a normal reflex and therefore helps humans to adapt to an ever-changing environment. Cough can also be a pathologic reflex in that it may be an important and often the only sign of serious disease. Cough is the most common symptom that leads patients to seek medical attention [1\u20133]. Based on duration, cough as the sole or predominant symptom and with no radiographic evidence of lung disease has been defined by the American College of Chest Physicians\u2019 (ACCP) guidelines in the following three categories: acute, lasting < 3 weeks; subacute, lasting between 3 and 8 weeks; and chronic, lasting > 8 weeks [4\u2022\u2022]. Acute cough can persist and become a subacute or chronic problem. The majority of the physician visits for cough are likely due to acute viral illnesses causing rhinosinusitis and acute bronchitis.",

An evaluation of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) of self-reported symptoms included an assessment of lung function by spirometry. There was a 9.3% prevalence of cough in those with no airflow obstruction and this number rose to 49.1% in those with severe airflow obstruction [7].

Normally, approximately 50 mL of sputum is produced each day by the airway mucus-secreting tissue, the goblet cells in the epithelium, and submucosal seromucous glands. The viscoelasticity of the mucus is conferred by glycoproteins, called mucins, whose components are encoded by specific mucin (MUC) genes. The mucus is eliminated by the action of mucociliary clearance to the hypopharynx, where it is swallowed and rarely noticed. The mucus layer provides an essential first-line defense to inhaled pathogens and can prevent pathogen invasion and subsequent infection.",

This may overwhelm mucociliary clearance mechanisms and result in a chronic productive cough. While expectorated mucus is usually clear or white (mucoid), when it becomes infected, the mucus may become purulent and have a yellow or green color. Miravitalles et al. [9\u2022\u2022] examined the correlation between sputum color and the presence of potentially pathogenic bacteria in patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECBs). Green or yellow sputum samples were most likely to yield bacteria (58.9% and 45.5% of samples, respectively), compared with 18% of clear and 39% of rust-colored samples positive for potentially pathogenic microorganisms.",

This is evident in a broad spectrum of clinical settings: in smokers with inflammatory bronchiolitis in the small airways and fixed airflow obstruction (COPD); in immunocompromised patients with poor resolution of lung infection leading to destruction and distortion of the small airways (bronchiectasis); and in post-transplant patients when host rejection causes inflammation and destruction of peripheral airways (bronchiolitis obliterans). Patients with chronic cough may suffer a marked decrement in quality of life as a result of incessant coughing [10\u2022,11\u2022]. The spectrum of non-asthmatic airway diseases contributing to cough in the adult will be discussed in this article. They include acute and chronic bronchitis, non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis, and infectious and non-infectious bronchiolitis. The control of cough in non-asthmatic diseases of the airways is best achieved by controlling the underlying causative disease; cough suppression is only occasionally required when control cannot be achieved.",

A Cochrane review found no clinical benefit in patients prescribed antibiotics for acute bronchitis [24\u2022\u2022], but antibiotic side effects (rash, diarrhea, and nausea) were common. Despite this evidence, antibiotics are still frequently prescribed, and patients often expect this treatment [25]. Strategies that may help mitigate the use of antibiotics include the following: explaining the likely viral cause of bronchitis; offering expectations regarding the duration of cough; and discussing harms and lack of benefit of antibiotics [13\u2022\u2022]. As this is done, focusing on helpful non-antibiotic regimens can be accomplished. Expectorants such as guaifenesin may pose some benefit. A review of three trials evaluating guaifenesin demonstrated a reduction in symptoms such as cough severity, frequency, and intensity [24\u2022\u2022]. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antihistamines, beta-agonists, and antitussives are generally not recommended [24\u2022\u2022, 26, 27]. Furthermore, a recent randomized control trial evaluating the effect of prednisolone on patients with acute lower respiratory tract infection, in absence of pneumonia or asthma, found no difference in the duration or severity of cough in patients treated with steroids [28].",

The airways in patients with CB exhibit mucociliary abnormalities leading to defective mucus transport and subsequent mucus accumulation. This results in chronic expectoration of sputum and airflow obstruction. Mucus overproduction may be precipitated by bacterial and/or viral infection, cigarette smoke, and oxidative stress that cause the activation of mucin gene transcription [35]. The major macromolecular components of mucus are the mucin glycoproteins. They are critical for local defense of the airway. Mucin levels may also play a role in the diagnosis and management of CB. In a study evaluating 917 patients with chronic obstructive bronchitis (COPD), levels of respiratory secreted mucins were found to be significantly higher in both current and former smokers than non-smokers. Mucin levels were also higher in patients with a history of two or more exacerbations [36].",

Chest physiotherapy and other physical maneuvers (flutter valves) rarely have a role in facilitating mucus clearance in this disease. Short-acting beta-agonists (SABA) promote mucus clearance by increasing airway diameter, improving ciliary activity, and promoting mucus hydration [35]. Various medications may modify mucus production and clearance in CB. Long-acting beta-agonists (LABA) may augment mucociliary clearance and offer symptomatic relief to patients. Long-acting muscarinic agonists (LAMAs) are recommended for patients with COPD. Small studies have shown a reduction in cough [42] and improved lung function [43]. The role of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in CB is unclear. A post-hoc analysis of a randomized controlled trial found that patients with moderate to severe COPD and a CB phenotype had a reduced rate of exacerbations when treated with both a LABA and ICS than when treated with one agent alone [44]. Studies evaluating the effect of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), an antioxidant, have produced mixed results. Nonetheless, a recent large meta-analysis of 13 studies and 4155 patients found that those with CB who took NAC experienced significantly fewer exacerbations, including patients with CB without evidence of airway obstruction [45\u2022\u2022]. The phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE-4) inhibitor roflumilast has recently emerged as a promising agent in treating CB. The RE2SPOND Trial included patients with CB, already on ICS/LABA, and found a significant reduction in exacerbations of chronic bronchitis among patients with a history of frequent exacerbations or hospitalization [46\u2022\u2022].",

Findings of centrilobular nodules may point to a respiratory bronchiolitis in smokers, or a subacute hypersensitivity pneumonitis in non-smokers; furthermore, the absence of these nodules or tree-in-bud opacities, with mosaic attenuation, may be most consistent with obliterative bronchiolitis (also known as constrictive bronchiolitis) and proliferative bronchiolitis [50].

BOS also affects many patients after lung transplantation, as over 70% of those who survive for 10 years will have the disease [56]. The mechanism is unclear, but thought to be secondary to defective airway repair in the setting of immunologic dysfunction, and perhaps a form of chronic graft-versus-host-disease (cGVHD). This is associated with declining lung function and increased risk of death [54\u2022\u2022].",

Because of the proposed inflammatory nature of BOS in transplanted patients, a combination of fluticasone, azithromycin, and montelukast (known as FAM) has been trialed in patients with BOS. A recent single-arm trial of 36 patients with BOS found that the majority of patients tolerated FAM, with only 6% patients experiencing treatment failure in 3 months, as compared to 40% in historical controls [57]. Azithromycin is also used in patients with BOS after lung transplant. A meta-analysis including 10 studies with 140 patients reported a significant increase in FEV1 after 7 months in those taking azithromycin, including a trend towards improved mortality due to BOS [58]; a Cochrane meta-analysis is currently underway [59]. Despite its utility in patients with BOS after HSCT, a recent randomized controlled trial evaluating montelukast for BOS after lung transplantation found no difference in loss of graft function or lung function [60].",

It has gained greater significance in recent years because of its increasing prevalence, associated morbidity, and also high economic burden [61\u2022\u2022]. Like chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis is often associated with cough and the production of mucoid or mucopurulent sputum and a recurrent sequence of mucus trapping, impaired mucociliary clearance, and dysregulated immunity. When there is extensive lung involvement, shortness of breath also occurs. Unlike chronic bronchitis, the inflammation and infection of bronchiectasis cause the bronchial walls to become damaged and dilated, and this can result in extensive permanent destruction. The pathologic features include intense inflammation, thickening, and constrictions of the airway wall. This results in tortuosity, dilatation, ectasia, and eventual destruction of the distal bronchi and bronchioles. Earlier changes include squamous metaplasia, desquamation of the lining epithelium, and extensive areas of necrotizing ulceration. The mucus found in the airways contains large numbers of neutrophils. While they dominate airway inflammation, they are paradoxically not unable to clear infection [62]. It has been discovered that patients with bronchiectasis have impaired neutrophil killing and that this functional impairment is worsened during exacerbations of infection [63].",

As the disease progresses, fibrosis of bronchial or bronchiolar walls occurs and peribronchiolar fibrosis also develops, leading to varying degrees of subtotal or total obliteration of the airway lumens. The bronchi may become so dilated (up to four times their size) that on cut surfaces of pathologic specimens, they appear as cysts filled with mucopurulent secretions (Fig. 2). Clearance of mucus and bacteria by normal mucociliary mechanisms is impaired, and a vicious cycle of repeated or prolonged bronchial infections, suppuration, and destruction ensues. The cause of the chronic cough is chronic bacterial colonization and mucus hypersecretion. Frequent infectious exacerbations are associated with increased cough and sputum resulting in a progressive decline of lung function, quality of life, and, for some, mortality.",

Chronic infection and the cycle of wall distortion and destruction are inherent in both forms. One unusual form of bronchiectasis is seen in asthmatics with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.

The routine chest roentgenogram may be unable to detect the abnormalities or may underestimate the degree of bronchiectasis. High-resolution CT scan (HRCT) has become the standard method of diagnosis consisting of cylindrical, varicose, and cystic (saccular) distortions of the airways. More extensive involvement of the lungs and the presence of the cystic changes predict a much poorer prognosis. The natural history of this disease is usually associated with recurrent exacerbations of bronchial infection and decline of lung function. In later stages of the disease, progressive dyspnea, poor quality of life, cachexia, and cor pulmonale may occur, and hemoptysis may complicate the course of the illness as a result of new and enlarged bronchial circulation to the areas of a destroyed lung. In milder forms of the disease, patients may be relatively asymptomatic and may not demonstrate bacteria in their sputum, unless an acute infection (exacerbation) occurs. The organisms that usually infect patients with bronchiectasis are similar to those associated with chronic bronchitis: H. influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Nonenteric gram-negative bacteria and Staphylococcus aureus are also seen. Colonization and infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa are found in more advanced stages. Patients with P. aeruginosa are more likely to have an accelerated decline of lung function and more frequent exacerbations. Non-tuberculous mycobacteria, Nocardia, and Aspergillus also may be cultured from the sputum of patients with bronchiectasis. Their presence may represent airway colonization in a compromised airway or active infection. Anaerobic bacteria are less frequently isolated from bronchiectatic airways.",

Although this is reasonable, there are no randomized studies that show their benefit. The mucolytic drug, recombinant human DNase, has proved effective in bronchiectasis associated with CF. This agent is contraindicated in non-CF bronchiectasis. Dry powder mannitol and hypertonic saline inhalation show promise for therapy for bronchiectasis as both improve tracheobronchial clearance in a variety of conditions complicated by chronic productive cough. Long-term, randomized, controlled studies with these agents are needed to determine their usefulness in patients with non-CF bronchiectasis. Mechanical aides such as chest physiotherapy, postural drainage, airway oscillatory devices, high-frequency-assisted airway clearance, and mechanically assisted cough have been advocated to assist patients in removing airway secretions.

There is insufficient data to recommend the routine use of inhaled corticosteroids in patients with bronchiectasis [66]. The potential risk of increased respiratory infections, especially non-tuberculous mycobacterium (NTM), associated with the use of inhaled corticosteroids, is a particular concern in this patient population [67]. Other anti-inflammatory approaches, such as systemic corticosteroids and ibuprofen, also cannot be recommended, especially because of safety concerns with long-term use. Chronic macrolide therapy has shown benefit in patients with bronchiectasis, including reducing sputum volume, decreasing exacerbation rates, and improving lung function [68, 69]. The use of azithromycin monotherapy is a concern in this population that has a high rate of NTM [70\u2022\u2022]. It is not clear whether or not the antimicrobial benefits or anti-inflammatory actions of macrolide therapy cause improvement. The benefits of maintenance antibiotics, with macrolides or other antimicrobial agents, are uncertain, and the overall benefits and long-term risks will have to be assessed in future studies before firm recommendations can be made. The role of inhaled antibiotics (such as tobramycin) has also been found effective for CF bronchiectasis but in non-CF bronchiectasis, studies are less encouraging.
