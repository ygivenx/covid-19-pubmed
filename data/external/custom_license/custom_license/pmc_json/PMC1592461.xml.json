            "text": "Several techniques exist to examine protein-protein interactions. Yeast two-hybrid systems [reviewed in (3)] involve fusing proteins to either the DNA binding or transcriptional activation domains of the Gal4 transcription factor. If binding occurs in yeast, a reporter gene is expressed. Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pulldown is also used to test protein interactions (4). This technique entails expressing GST fusion proteins, allowing them to bind the target protein and purifying the complex by GST-glutathione affinity purification. Similar techniques include co-immunoprecipitation with or without chemical crosslinking. Peptide phage display [reviewed in (5)] involves displaying a library of foreign peptides on the end of coat proteins on the surface of bacteriophage particles. The library is then screened by affinity selection against an immobilized binding partner, and through several rounds peptides with high affinity for the target can be identified. Limitations of these techniques are that they are primarily appropriate for detection of inter-molecular binding and that a positive result indicates these proteins or protein fragments can interact under the conditions of the assay, not that they necessarily do interact under physiological conditions. Specifically, intra-molecular interactions and interactions involving proteins that require numerous cofactors or chaperones to fold properly are difficult or impossible to analyze by these methods.

HBV chronically infects more than 350 million people worldwide and is the leading cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (6). These DNA viruses replicate by reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate in which DNA synthesis is primed by P itself, resulting in covalent attachment of the product DNA to P. This feature can be exploited in a priming assay, which measures covalent attachment of radiolabeled dGMP to P. Several chaperones are needed for proper folding and function of P, including HSP 90, HSP 70, HSP 40 and Hop (7, 8). The requirement of template RNA and cellular chaperone cofactors for P to become functional has made studying the structure of P using standard techniques very difficult and has prevented characterization of P by X-ray crystallography. Therefore, new techniques are needed to understand the folding of P and to identify inter- or intra-molecular contact sites involving P.",

We used varying detergent concentrations, high and low, along with six monoclonal antibodies to determine structural changes and the existence of putative contact sites on the DHBV polymerase. In order for this method to be useful, several conditions must be met. First, the antibodies or other sequence-specific binding reagents must recognize one or more motifs on the protein. Also, at least one of the antibodies needs to recognize its epitope and immunoprecipitate (IP) the protein in the high detergent conditions. In our case we used RIPA, a partially denaturing buffer that breaks most weak protein-protein contacts but does not completely denature most proteins. Under less stringent buffer conditions that retain more protein-protein contacts, one or more of the antibodies must now be unable to recognize their target. We chose IPP150 as the low stringency buffer because P retains sequence-specific RNA binding activity in this buffer (16). If these conditions are met, it can be concluded that detergent treatment can cause conformational changes in the protein and binding sites may be present on the protein. If a binding site is causing the differential immunoprecipitation, occupancy of the binding site in the mild conditions would occlude the antibody epitopes (Fig. 1). Figure 2 shows an example of differential IP using a panel of mAbs and two different buffers. In the high detergent buffer (RIPA) all of the mAbs recognize their epitopes, while in IPP150 buffer, which has less detergent and retains many protein contacts, only mAbs 9, 11 and 12 recognize their epitopes.",

An example of a sequence homology alignment using eight different hepadnaviruses is shown in Figure 3. Groups of proteins with very high homology overall will not be amenable to this analysis because there will be too many regions that are similar.

For example, trypsin cleaves proteins at arginine or lysine residues. The rate of cleavage can be influenced by sequence context and fold of the protein. The initial cleavages on a folded protein will be at surface-exposed residues, leading to a specific partial digestion pattern. If the protein undergoes a conformational change it may alter the exposed residues, causing a change in the partial proteolytic pattern. Therefore, partial proteolysis can be used to test the ability of mutations to alter the structure of a protein. As another measure of effects from our mutants, we assessed their partial proteolysis pattern with papain. Figure 5 illustrates a mutant P with a different protease digestion pattern than wild-type P. Different partial proteolysis patterns show that the mutations affected the structure of the protein, consistent with disrupted binding at the putative contact site.",

Binding can also induce a conformational alteration to the protein and hence affect the function of the protein. The effect of disruption of the binding site can be measured by determining protein function after mAbs are allowed to bind their epitopes. Mabs that alter the function of the protein must be able to bind their epitopes, whereas those that have no effect on the protein may not be able to bind. This technique provides epitope exposure information and shows direct inhibitory effects of binding. Figure 6 shows the effect that various mAbs have on protein function in DHBV P. Data such as these imply that the epitopes are near important regions and may participate in protein function.",

A peptide containing the binding motif can bind its ligand, competitively displacing the normal protein ligand leading to a dose-dependent decrease in protein activity. This experiment is useful because the previous techniques only imply a binding interaction. For example, the differential epitope exposure could be due to a change in a conformationally dependent epitope. However, successful displacement of a ligand through peptide competition directly indicates binding. An example of this type of dose-dependent displacement is seen with imidazole competing for binding to Ni+ columns in histidine tag protein purification. Demonstrating specificity through the use of negative control peptides is essential in this assay. An ideal negative control peptide would contain the putative binding site with mutations known to prevent binding. If this is not possible due to solubility issues that can occur with synthetic peptides, a peptide containing the same amino acids whose order has been scrambled is also an excellent control to demonstrate specificity for the putative ligand. Figure 7 is an example of peptide competition using a peptide containing the binding site and an irrelevant peptide. Another interpretation of our results is that the peptide exerts its inhibition by inhibiting folding or binding to a chaperone partner. We have excluded this possibility by showing that a purified active truncation of P, which does not require interactions with any chaperones, is inhibited by the T3 peptide (data not shown).",

For example, many current techniques detect interactions between protein fragments, which can lead to artifactual positive or false negative results if the fragments do not fold properly. Therefore, there is a need for alternate techniques to address putative protein-protein interactions. The approach presented here differs from more common techniques as it combines assessment of physical interaction with functional assays using intact proteins under physiological conditions. The strength of the technique is that binding is assessed within unmodified functional proteins or protein complexes. The weakness of this approach is that it cannot formally exclude alternate interpretations of the data such as a role for the identified sites in essential local protein structure. Therefore, whenever possible these approaches should be complimented by data from crosslinking, surface plasmon resonance or similar techniques that measure binding directly.",

Furthermore, understanding these contacts provides insight into protein structure, and the contacts themselves can be promising drug targets. Both cellular and viral protein contacts have been targeted for disruption. Small molecules targeting tubulin polymerization (17) and BCL proteins involved in apoptotic signaling [reviewed in (18)] have shown promise as anti-cancer agents. Peptides have been effective in blocking the interaction between the SARS coronavirus and cellular protein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the first step in viral infection (19). In DNA viruses, contact sites have been disrupted using both peptides and small molecules, leading to ablation of virus replication. The first example of this was a nonapeptide used to block subunit interaction in the herpes simplex virus ribonucleotide reductase (20). More recently researchers have used peptides to block interactions between subunits of several DNA polymerases [reviewed in (21, 22)]. This strategy has been successfully demonstrated with viruses such as herpes simplex virus (23), human cytomegalovirus (24) and Rous sarcoma virus (25). In addition, peptides have been shown to block interactions in the reverse transcriptase (26), integrase (27) and protease (28) proteins of human immunodeficiency virus. All of these interactions are potential targets for disruption by small molecule inhibitors that could serve as drugs.",
