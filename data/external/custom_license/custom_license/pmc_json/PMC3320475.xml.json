According to previous studies on posttraumatic stress, 3 categories of risk factors were postulated. The first category included pre-SARS variables: sex, age, education level, family income, availability of emotional support as indicated by the number of persons with whom one could talk and share worries, and whether one was a healthcare worker. The second category included parameters for severity of disease and treatment regimen: lowest level of blood oxygen saturation (SaO2) during hospitalization, duration of hospitalization for SARS treatment, whether treatment in ICU was required, and total steroid dosage used during hospitalization. The third category was SARS-related psychological and social variables: whether the participant knew anyone who was suspected or confirmed to have SARS, whether the participant knew anyone who died of SARS, and rating for subjective sense of threat.",
