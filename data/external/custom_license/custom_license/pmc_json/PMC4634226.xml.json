Therefore, if molecular methods would have been used, viral detection would have possibly been higher.\n13\n This concept is especially true for viruses such as RSV for which IIF is not recommended for diagnosis in adults.\n14\n Nevertheless, in all studies a significant proportion of patients with ILI remain without etiological diagnosis. This leads us to the inevitable question: what other agents cause the majority of the ILI in our adult population? Other viruses such as rhinovirus, enteroviruses, the new coronavirus and bocavirus could be implicated, but it would not be surprising if new viruses causing ILI were discovered in the near future.",

Therefore, our results were not useful in a timely manner for antiviral treatment. Rapid antigen devices for Flu which can give a result within the hour are useful in these cases. On the other side, viral etiology permitted infection control measures, like patient isolation. This is particularly important in the high\u2010risk population such as immunocompromised patients and their close contacts.
