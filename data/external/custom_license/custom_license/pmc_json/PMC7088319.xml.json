Following infection with influenza viruses, RSV, or hMPV, the risk of hospitalization increases with underlying heart and lung disease [6\u20138].

Apart from the sensitivity and specificity of the involved laboratory methods, successful etiological diagnosis of RVIs depends on virus-specific factors such as the extent of shedding, as well as on the patient\u2019s age and medical condition [10\u201312]. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays can provide a rapid etiological diagnosis more efficiently than conventional microbiological methods [13]. Therefore, real-time PCR may contribute to reducing the inappropriate use of antibiotics and to shortening the length of hospitalization. The high diagnostic sensitivity of real-time PCR may be of special value in viral respiratory infections of the elderly, who, at least in the case of RSV, are characterized by low mucosal shedding of the virus [9, 14].",

These results are comparable to other studies, where antibiotics were discontinued in 9.1\u201328.6 % of the patients after receiving a positive rapid viral test [6, 17, 24]. The impact of rapid viral screening on antibiotic administration in children is not easily transferable to the elderly. First, a negative result of PCR in elderly adults is less reliable due to the reduced viral shedding in this age group [9]. Second, even with a positive viral PCR result, there is an understandable reluctance to discontinue antibiotic treatment in the elderly, as immunosenescence and comorbidities render these patients at increased risk for a bacterial co-infection [25]. Unfortunately, the elderly may be particularly vulnerable to the consequences of inappropriate use of antibiotics, such as adverse drug events, super-infection by Clostridium difficile, and, ultimately, selection of resistant bacteria [26]. Due to their reduced physiological reserves, residents in long-term care facilities seem to be at particular risk in this regard [27, 28].",

In the present study, no difference in comorbidity measured by the total CIRS-G and CCI scores was found between the three hospitalized groups, but no comparison could be made in this regard with a representative group of non-hospitalized elderly individuals. The present control group was younger and less likely to reside in a nursing home than the symptomatic groups. With the often atypical clinical presentation of an RVI in elderly patients, adherence to clinical guidelines might be difficult, often due to difficulties with the initial diagnosis [9, 23]. In the present study, a tentative pneumonia diagnosis at admission was confirmed by chest X-ray in only half of the patient population. In one study, a local educational program for the treatment of respiratory infections in the elderly significantly reduced the prescription rate and influenced the types of antibiotics prescribed [29], thus indicating the effectiveness of age-adjusted guidelines of antibiotic treatment also in elderly patients.",

In addition, the low number of specially trained staff harvesting the viral samples minimized the risk of poor-quality samples. A limitation to this study is the low number of patients with positive viral swabs. Economical considerations prohibited PCR analysis for rhinovirus and coronavirus; an inclusion of these viruses in the PCR panel could have improved the number of virus-positive swabs.
