Hefty government backing and a focus on generating short-term revenue have galvanized companies to switch some of their focus to SARS, despite there being no established market for SARS-related products.",

But geopolitical uncertainties like the recent war in Iraq drive investors to favor companies that can generate profits quickly, says Hildreth. Although SARS market data are scant, experts say the disease can deliver profits in the short term due to the immediate need for a treatment. The SARS virus may also reemerge during the annual flu season in the fall, predict scientists, increasing prospects for a profitable market.",

For example, Roche Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland) is collaborating with the Genome Institute (Singapore) to codevelop a PCR-based SARS detection kit by the end of July. \u201cWe have the knowledge, the instruments, the technology and the money, so we have a duty to create the test,\u201d said Baschi Duerr, a spokesman for Roche Diagnostics.",

Aaron Davidson, vice president of the private Canadian venture capital firm Ventures West (Toronto, ON, Canada), believes that the SARS market may be only in vaccines or diagnostics. But investors deem vaccines generally risky, whereas major players in diagnostics like Roche and Abbott Laboratories (Abbott Park, IL, USA) are most likely best positioned to accrue the majority of profits from a SARS diagnostic test.",

New Zealand recently offered more than $1 million to hard-hit China's anti-SARS efforts and to boost international collaborations in SARS research; similarly, Health Canada allocated $500,000 for research against SARS. And several companies like Biota Holdings (Victoria, Australia) are working with US authorities to investigate possible ways to participate in government-funded research programs to combat SARS.",
