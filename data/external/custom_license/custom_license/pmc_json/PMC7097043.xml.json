Many donors \u2014 for example, Global Fund and implementation partners, including the WHO, UNAIDS and PEPFAR \u2014 have helped affected countries with the procurement and introduction of rapid HIV tests and enable early detection and prevent onward transmission. As a result of funding from donors, increased accessibility of RDTs, and the \u2018architecture\u2019 provided by national HIV/AIDS control programmes, HIV tests successfully reached as many as 150 million children and adults in 129 low- and middle-income countries in 2014 (ref. 14).",

With thousands of POC testing sites across a country, even the most well-organized control programmes would find it difficult to provide adequate training on an ongoing basis. This problem is most acute in health facilities where there is high turnover of staff. The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has developed a convenient means of external quality assurance by working with countries to generate thermally stable proficiency panels that can be shipped to every POC testing site to ensure competence of testing personnel. However, a study in South Africa found that only 3% of HIV RDTs were performed correctly15. Although not every error will result in an incorrect diagnosis, the alarming reality is that with 150 million tests being performed annually worldwide, assuming a 99% accuracy rate, as many as 1.5 million incorrect results per year could potentially be generated. Ongoing quality assurance efforts include developing key policy and quality documents for the implementation of HIV-related POC testing16. For example, as POC technologies for HIV viral load and early infant diagnosis were being developed, there was tremendous emphasis on quality, given the complexity of the test and lessons learned from HIV RDTs.",

While microscopic identification of parasites in blood smears has been the traditional means of diagnosing malaria in patients presenting with fever, microscopy requires equipment, a source of electricity and trained laboratory technicians. Malaria RDTs were developed as many rural communities lack these resources, and to date there are over 120 brands of malaria RDTs made by approximately 60 companies17, which vary widely in performance, manufacturing quality and price. The WHO has set up a pre-qualification programme with the CDC and the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics to evaluate these tests to inform test selection and procurement for national malaria control programmes17. In countries that permit the sale of malaria RDTs and medicines over the counter, the quality of these commodities cannot be guaranteed. The price of most RDT brands is between US$0.65 and US$2.50 per test7,18, and as with all diagnostics, it is important to caution that price pressure will ultimately affect quality. As with HIV, with the support of donors, selection of high-quality RDTs and the architecture provided by national malaria control programmes, malaria RDTs have reached millions of patients every year. This promising trend, coupled with the effectiveness of bednets for preventing transmission, has led to the call for malaria elimination in many parts of the world19.",

As the intensity of transmission decreases due to lower parasite density in infected individuals, more sensitive tests will be needed, which can only be achieved with costlier amplification steps or with ultrasensitive platforms for antigen detection. Also, decreasing numbers of cases mean that malaria tests are no longer cost-effective, and thus it is more difficult to justify funding in light of multiple competing priorities for limited health budgets.",

First, the specimen used for sexually transmitted infections are usually from urethral, cervical or vaginal swabs that require multiple steps to solubilize the bacteria and free antigen before reaction with the capture antibody. This sometimes requires a heating step and adds to the complexity and cost of the POC test. Urine is the preferred specimen in men with such infections, and current POC tests require a urine centrifugation step to concentrate the bacteria before processing and reaction. Another common drawback of antigen detection tests is the potential for false positive results due to cross-reactivity with antigens from closely related bacterial or viral species. This is especially true if polyclonal antibodies are used as capture antibodies. Finally, a common disadvantage of current antigen detection POC assays is low sensitivity, often requiring 104 to 105 bacteria for the RDT to become positive. Malaria RDTs are an exception to these drawbacks in that the parasites are present in large quantities in blood and no pre-processing or concentration steps are required. For most antigen detection POC tests, the low sensitivity may be due to low concentration of target antigens, inefficiency of extraction or limited optimization of reagents, which has hampered chlamydia and gonorrhoea tests52,53. However, Gift et al. showed that rapid chlamydia tests with a sensitivity of 65% can lead to more infected patients being treated compared to NATs, which require patients to return for their test results54. They called this the rapid test paradox, which was also recently seen with a p24 assay for early infant diagnosis of HIV, where a sensitivity of 72% can still lead to a higher \u2018diagnostic yield\u2019 than NATs performed on dried blood spots sent from remote antenatal clinics55.",

For example, the near-POC TB diagnostic involves primer-based amplification of MTB DNA specifically, including regions associated with RIF drug resistance. Thus, NAT tests are generally highly sensitive and more specific than antigen- or antibody-based tests, and may help inform on drug susceptibilities. While instruments are available for high-throughput screening of patients and subsidies can bring test costs down to US$10, the equipment (capable of four tests at a time) costs more than US$10,000, which may be prohibitive in high-incidence regions.

National programmes should take advantage of the rapid turnaround time of ASSURED tests to streamline patient pathways and increase the efficiency of the health care system. The roll-out of POC diagnostics requires the use of implementation science to ensure success71, taking into account the cultural, behavioural, socioeconomic and health systems contexts. This includes a careful assessment of acceptability and feasibility linked to possible increased stresses on the health system/provider when testing is introduced into settings where thus far no or limited testing was performed. Studies using the GeneXpert MTB/RIF TB test showed that new diagnostic tests would not have the expected impact on outcomes if test introduction is not accompanied by changes in patient pathways or practices72,73. These studies highlight the importance of programmatic monitoring of the impact of novel technologies beyond studies that are usually conducted under controlled conditions. Likewise, same-day testing and treatment using a syphilis RDT strengthened health systems in the Amazon forest and rural China when policy makers were involved and testing was introduced within the appropriate social and cultural contexts71,74. For example, in Peru, women normally need to present six times to the largest maternal hospital in Lima for their prenatal syphilis screening to be completed and treatment provided, but the introduction of the rapid syphilis test streamlined testing and treatment to one visit, reducing patient out-of-pocket expenses and increasing the efficiency of a busy health care facility75.",

Other manufacturers have developed innovative connectivity solutions that can use mobile phones to read the results from lateral flow assays and provide electronic result exchange, while a third option would be to include connectivity directly onto the test88. Ideally, connectivity should not only include collection and transmission of test data, but also analysis to provide feedback for immediate patient treatment or for surveillance. With the addition of barcodes, two-dimensional codes or electronic storage into tests, a number of other data points can be collected, including manufacturing information (for example, lot numbers), dates, expiry dates, stock availability and possibly even environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity under which the tests have been manufactured, transported, stored and used. For instrumented tests, maintenance and other machine data can be collected. Thus, connectivity solutions can increase quality assurance for POC tests and would allow for centralized and real-time decision-making, even across tiered laboratory systems and during outbreak investigations and global health emergencies. Moving forward, it is critically important to make provisions for poor or non-existent internet availability to support sustainability standards and that systems are developed with compatibility so that they can be linked into central databases.",

First, it is ideal to have non-invasive specimen collection given that more tests become available as self or home tests. Second, samples come in many different formats (blood, urine, sputum, stool, swab, breath, and so on) and require different preparation depending on the test to be performed. This may include concentrating the sample (or possibly titration), purification, lysing of cells, target amplification, and so on. While most of these processes can be easily performed in the laboratory, there remain few solutions for collecting and performing these tasks at the POC89. Oral tests for HIV and hepatitis C virus are good examples of advances in non-invasive sampling, although the collection device is more expensive than blood collection via disposable capillary tubes. Related, given that rapid lateral flow antigen detection tests often have lower sensitivity, extra processing steps such as heating or other forms of extraction are required when using specimens other than blood.",

However, in light of more diagnostic tests now being performed in both urban and rural areas, there could be more future effort devoted to the environmental impact of these tests. The cumulative effect of many tens of thousands of tests performed at remote sites away from laboratory infrastructure may pose health and environmental risks and put a strain on limited resources. Some examples include the plastics used in current rapid tests that cannot be recycled and give out toxic fumes when burned, and testing cartridges that may even contain harmful chemicals and need to be disposed of properly. Recyclable materials should be used, when possible, for the housing, substrate matrix materials, and reagents used in tests. Paper, an obvious choice of substrate material that has many inherent advantages over standard plastic materials, will see increased usage, not only in lateral flow formats but other paper based formats as well such as in micro paper-based analytical devices (\u03bcPADs)90\u201392. And recently, cell-free synthetic gene networks for in vitro applications at POC, have been achieved by freeze-drying cell-free systems onto paper, which increases stability at room temperature and can be easily transported and stored, and simply re-activated by adding water93. Other factors also need to be considered, such as disposal of test reagents, clinical samples and materials used for active components such as electronic tracks and electrodes.",

We propose the acronym REASSURED for the design of future diagnostic tests to address important priorities such as global health emergencies and AMR. An ideal test would be one that combines the best of both existing diagnostic worlds (instrumented laboratory based tests with lateral flow tests) and technologies currently being developed (Fig. 2), which would provide an important extension to diagnostic laboratory systems and fulfil the Sustainable Development Goals of \u2018no one left behind\u2019 in terms of effective health care service delivery. Such tests can only be created by forming strong collaborative partnerships across many disciplinary boundaries, and we look toward a future when data connectivity linking cost-effective ASSURED diagnostics to laboratory systems will form the backbone of health care systems and provide real-time data for evidence-based disease control and prevention strategies, more efficient health systems and improved patient outcomes.",
