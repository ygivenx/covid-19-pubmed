Although once endemic in many human populations, smallpox was eradicated in 1979 largely as a result of mass vaccination reinforced by other highly focused control measures3. Today, although viral samples are officially retained in only two locations, the existence of other sources cannot be ruled out4. In the face of such a difficult to quantify, unlikely, but potentially serious threat, contingency planning demands a rational assessment of the scale of casualties that a smallpox attack might cause, and identification of what controls might be optimal in minimizing its effects5,6,7,8. The latter task is complicated by the severe adverse effects of vaccination experienced by a significant minority of individuals9,10, such that a national mass vaccination campaign could cause more deaths than an isolated smallpox epidemic. A second key problem is the passage of time since the last smallpox outbreak: human populations, mobility and patterns of social interactions have changed in the last 30 years, complicating extrapolation from historical epidemics to the prediction of future outbreaks.",

Thus a key aspect of policy-orientated epidemic modelling is to assess both the adequacy of current policy and how it might further be optimized. Optimality is principally the minimization of mortality and morbidity, so it is critical that models accurately incorporate expected adverse event rates from vaccination. However, the SARS virus has shown that the economic costs of an epidemic can be out of all proportion to the numbers infected, indicating that minimizing the duration of a smallpox outbreak might also be a critical priority when formulating control strategy.",

Models should therefore incorporate realistic logistical constraints on policy implementation6, and, if needed, economic costs. There may also be a subtle interplay with epidemic dynamics here. For example, ring vaccination is constrained to the speed of the epidemic, whereas mass vaccination could in principle proceed as quickly as logistics allowed, thereby minimizing the duration of an outbreak.",

One issue for all the studies is the numbers of parameter values that are assumed, rather than estimated from data21. The most important factors determining the conclusions drawn by two of the studies6,7 are the assumed infectiousness during prodrome relative to that during symptomatic disease, and the relatively low effectiveness of isolation of symptomatic cases assumed. New best estimates from a well-observed historical epidemic in Africa indicate prodromal transmission alone contributes 0.16 to R0 (ref. 21), 2.4% of the total R0 value of 6.9. Both of the studies assumed that prodromal R0 is 2.5\u20133 out of a total R0 of around 3 (refs 6, 7).

Achieving the correct balance between model complexity and validation is therefore key to informative modelling (Box 2 and Table 2). Validation in this context is how well the model matches observed epidemic behaviour at the level of detail relevant to the model's purposes. Ideally, such data should be independent of any epidemiological data used to estimate model parameters.

However, extrapolating from historical data to contemporary developed-world populations is problematic. It is unclear how much residual immunity remains today as a result of past vaccination programmes; those vaccinated 25\u201330 years ago are unlikely to possess complete immunity and a significant proportion may develop less severe forms of the disease2,3, potentially changing the dynamics of transmission. Allowing for past immunity levels is therefore critical when estimating R0 from historical data20. Historically, most infections occurred in care-givers to symptomatic individuals, whether in households or hospitals3. It is unclear how 30 years of changes in household sizes, working patterns and mobility would affect transmission patterns today (see Box 2). Incorporating detailed data on demographics and human mobility into spatially explicit models offers one method by which such extrapolation can be made more reliable, but the scale of changes mean that much uncertainty will inevitably remain.",

Investigation of this issue now, using simulation and analytical studies, is critical. Real-time data capture and dissemination is essential, and infrastructure needs to be developed in advance to facilitate this critical mechanism for implementing and monitoring interventions. Currently, it is unclear what level of detail would be necessary for models used in such a context\u2014although some incorporation of the random effects that dominate epidemics in their early stages would clearly be desirable. If it were determined that the first few generations of cases in an outbreak would give insufficient information for real-time policy optimization, then a precautionary \u2018hit hard, hit early\u2019 policy might be warranted (coupled with a set of criteria for de-escalating the policy), despite the higher associated costs and adverse consequences of vaccinating more people than might strictly be necessary. Such considerations are of equal relevance to the emergence of new pathogens such as SARS25,26, as they are to deliberately released agents.",
