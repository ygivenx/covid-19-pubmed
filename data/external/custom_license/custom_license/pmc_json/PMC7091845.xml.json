The proportion of cells with the surface markers of memory T cells increases with age, with a corresponding decrease in the proportion of na\u00efve T cells, both in mice14,15 and in humans.16,17,18 Studies of the proportions of CD4 and CD8 cells are less consistent, but there are numerous reports of age-related decline in CD4 cell numbers in mouse blood (reviewed in Miller19). Age also leads, in mice, to an increase in the proportion of T cells expressing the multiple drug resistance pump P-glycoprotein,20 a marker for anergic cells within the CD4 memory population.21,22. The increase with age in the P\u2013glycoprotein positive CD4 pool apparently does not depend on antigenic stimulation, because it is also seen within the na\u00efve population of CD4 cells in mice transgenic for a T cell receptor specific for pigeon cytochrome C.23 Some of these transitions are likely to reflect the decline with age in the number of new thymic emigrants,6 and indeed the ability of intact thymic glands to support T cell reconstitution declines early in life both in mice24,25 and in humans.26,27 We know very little, as yet, about the way in which altered thymic output interacts with cytokine-dependent and antigen-dependent processes, as well as with clone-specific cell-autonomous epigenetic changes,28,29,30 to change the balance of na\u00efve and memory T cells, to lead to accumulation of P-glycoprotein positive cells, and more generally to reduce protective immune reactions in old age. Although the functional implications of these subset changes are still uncertain, it is noteworthy that mice whose immune systems appear to be relatively old \u2014 ie have higher than normal levels of CD4 memory cells and CD4 P\u2013glycoprotein cells, and lower levels of CD4 and CD4 na\u00efve cells \u2014 have shorter life expectancies than littermates with younger T cell subset patterns.31,32.",

Similarly, 5% of the animals have CD4 memory proportions that exceed 56% (as a proportion of CD4 cells) or are lower than 7%, and other T cell subsets show a similar degree of inter-animal variability. To see if these differences are under the control of polymorphic alleles that vary among stocks of laboratory mice, we have conducted a whole genome scan to look for associations between specific chromosomal segments and the levels of seven T cell subsets. The mice were tested at two ages, 8 and 18 months, to determine whether the gene/subset association was stable over time. Two groups of mice were tested, one consisting of mated females, and one consisting of virgin mice, to see to what extent the gene/trait associations could be reproduced in mice differing in gender and in reproductive history. The results show that T cell subset levels are indeed regulated by genetic polymorphisms, some stable and some age-sensitive, and that specific combinations of additive alleles can have major influences over the proportions of several T cell subsets.",

Two methods were used to test the strength of the locus/trait association: a single locus method and an interval mapping (IM) approach. To reduce the chance of reporting false-positive results, the table includes only those associations where the single locus experiment-wise P-value, derived from permutation calculations, was P<0.10, supplemented by results for QTL detected by IM at P<0.05 if these were not significant in the initial single locus screen. Although calculations were carried out independently for the 8-month and the 18-month data, they are assembled together in this table for convenient comparison. The calculations showed at least one association at P<0.10 by the single locus method for each of the seven tested subsets, and significant effects, based on the experiment-wise criterion P(e)<0.05, were noted for CD4, CD8, CD8M, CD4P, and CD8P cell subsets. All 11 of the associations noted in the single locus method were confirmed using the IM method at the 5% significance level, and in addition the IM approach detected QTL on chromosomes 4, 7, and 12 that did not achieve statistical significance in the single locus scan. The IM analysis suggested the possibility of two loci on chromosome 7, flanking marker D7Mit91, with effects on the CD4P subset, but further work at higher resolution will be needed to confirm this suggestion.",

Using P<0.05 as an arbitrary criterion, four of the QTL tested in mated mice, and six of those detected in virgin mice appear to influence T cell subset values at both 8 and 18 months of age, ie have an effect that is established in adult mice and remains roughly equivalent throughout middle age. Two of these loci are illustrated in the top panel of Figure 1Figure 1. Four of the loci in mated females and six of those detected in virgin females have effects that reach nominal P<0.05 at 8 months, but show a smaller effect (and in some cases little or no effect) at 18 months of age; these loci may produce a transient influence on T cell subset proportions. Five loci (two with effects in mated mice, and three with effects in virgin mice) appear to have an influence on T cell subsets that appears only in the 18-month-old animals. Two of these late-acting QTL, with negligible effects at 8 months and large effects at the 18-month time point, are illustrated in the bottom panels of Figure 1.

Similarly, of the 15 QTL detected among virgin mice, five reach P<0.05 when re-examined in the group of mated female mice.

For each of the traits in Tables 2 and 3 for which there was more than one QTL at a given time point (detected by the single locus method), we conducted an analysis of variance (ANOVA) to see if there was evidence for significant inter-allele interaction. In all cases but one, we found no evidence for gene/gene interaction, as indicated by the significance test of the two-way and higher-order interaction terms in the ANOVA results (not shown). (The exception was due to a significant interaction, at P=0.009, between the D8Mit51 and D15Mit100 markers that are associated with differences in CD4 T cells in 8-month-old virgin mice.) This analysis also allowed us to calculate the differences in T cell subset levels between mice that differ at two or more of the QTL that are associated with differences in T cell subsets. Table 6 shows the results of this analysis. In all cases, the observed difference in subset levels between the most disparate genotypic combinations was close to the sum of the individual gene effects, consistent with the lack of statistically significant epistasis noted in the ANOVA. The \u2018delta\u2019 column, which shows for each allele combination the difference in subset levels between the group with the most extreme phenotype and the group with the opposite allele pattern, illustrates that these genetic differences, when taken in combination, can have large effects on T cell subset values. Figure 2Figure 2 illustrates two of these multi-gene composite effects for age-sensitive subsets (CD4 and CD8M) in the virgin mice. In each case, the combined genetic effect seen at 8 months of age is similar in magnitude to the effects of aging itself over the 8 to 18-month interval; in this sense, mice with one set of alleles appear to resemble, in their subset patterns, animals that are 10 months older or younger.",

This principal component, termed \u2018Immune Factor 1\u2019, has an eigenvalue of 2.7, indicating that it encapsulates 2.7-fold as much inter-animal variation as the average T cell subset by itself. Figure 3Figure 3 shows a plot of the correlations between Immune Factor 1 and each of the seven T cell subsets used for its calculation. There are strong positive correlations between the factor and CD4M, CD8M, and CD4P, all subsets that increase with age, and strong negative correlations between the factor and the levels of CD4 and CD4V cells, subsets that tend to decline with age in mice. We interpret this pattern of factor loadings as evidence that the values of Immune Factor 1 can be used as a measure of the overall effect of aging on the immune subset pattern. We have shown elsewhere (Miller, submitted) that mice with high levels of Immune Factor 1 have a shorter life expectancy than mice with low levels, consistent with the interpretation of this factor as an index of immunological age.",

The genome scan approach we chose is unbiased, in the sense that it does not depend on prior information about strain-specific differences in one or more of the T cell subsets of interest. This permits the same genotypic information to be used efficiently to search for gene/trait associations for a wide range of traits of interest. By examining each test mouse twice, once at 8 and then again at 18 months of age, we were able to search for genes whose effect on T cell subsets was transient, permanent, or late-acting with respect to the life span. This approach allowed us to document statistically significant associations, at an experiment-wise P<0.05, for genes that influence CD4, CD4P, CD8, CD8M, and CD8P T cell subsets in mated female mice. A similar approach using a population of virgin male and female mice documented QTL with effects on CD4, CD8, and CD8M subsets. Many other loci had suggestive evidence for linkage; those where P<0.10 are included in Tables 2 and 3 and a complete list of QTL where P<0.20 can be obtained by request from the authors. Post\nhoc analyses showed that 10 of the loci with P<0.10 led to stable effects on their respective T cell subsets, with significant effects at both 8 and 18 months of age. Five other alleles had effects that were significant only in the older mice, and thus may be influencing age-dependent elements of T cell homeostasis. Eleven of the QTL effects were sufficiently robust that they were apparent, by post\nhoc analyses, both in the mated female population and in the mixed-sex virgin population. We found no evidence for epistatic interactions; genes with an effect on a common T cell subset seemed to act independently of one another. Our search for epistatic interactions involved only those QTL identified as significant in the single-locus scan; it is thus possible that epistatic interactions might exist between pairs of genes that were not individually detectable in our population.",

Those QTL that are seen in both the mated and virgin populations seem likely to prove replicable in additional sets of mice, but among those QTL seen in only one of these two studies it is not possible to determine without more data whether the disparity represents a real effect of gender or reproductive history, or instead reflects a false positive or unstable result.",

One group34 has reported a QTL on rat chromosome 9, and two others (chromosomes 10 and 20) for which evidence was only suggestive, which modify the balance between CD45RChigh and CD45RClow CD4 T cells in a cross between Lewis and Brown-Norway rats. The region containing the rat chromosome 9 locus is syntenic with a portion of mouse chromosome 17, but is about 20 cM away from the D17Mit46 locus associated with differences in CD4V and CD8M levels in our mouse data set. The rat chromosome 20 region is also syntenic to the same area of mouse chromosome 17, ie about 20 cM distant from D17Mit46. The rat CD45RChigh subset of CD4 cells resembles the mouse CD4V subset in some of its properties, and it is plausible, though by no means certain, that both the studies may have mapped a region that influences T cell development through similar biochemical pathways.",
