It was first cloned by Liu et al.3, 4 from mice expressing the leukemia fusion protein AML1-ETO and later by other groups from virus-infected porcine alveolar macrophages5 and human melanoma cell lines.6 The gene and protein were renamed Usp18 and USP18, respectively, according to the systematic nomenclature suggested by Baker et al.7 for UBPs and ubiquitin-like (Ubl) proteins. On the basis of its amino-acid sequence, USP18 is a member of the USP family, which is responsible for removing ubiquitin or Ubl proteins from their conjugated substrates.",

The protein shares catalytic domains of UBPs. In the mouse, a mutation of the USP18 protein within the Cys box at position 61 completely abolishes the isopeptidase activity of the protein by replacing the active site of cysteine C61 with codon specific for alanine C61A. However, not only the Cys box is responsible for isopeptidase function, but also the His box and the Asn residue8 (Figure 1). Another functional domain specific for USP18 has been mapped from exon 9\u201311 (aa 312\u2013368); this domain facilitates binding to the intracellular domain of the IFNAR2 subunit in order to regulate interferon signaling9 (Figure 1). Binding to IFNAR2 is abolished by a mutation at position 361 of the USP18 protein,10 a mutation that was induced by N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis,11 and mouse strains carrying this mutation are called Usp18Ity9.",

Although USP18 is mainly located in the cytoplasm, USP18-sf is evenly distributed in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Both proteins maintain their functional activity in term of enzymatic and IFNAR2 binding ability, but the USP18-sf isoform is the main delSGylation enzyme for nuclear proteins and therefore may serve cell-specific functions. In addition, because USP18-sf is controlled by two independent mechanisms, its regulation is more flexible. Additional studies are needed to characterize the role of each isoform and to determine whether the regulation pathway can influence the outcome of USP18 function.12",

In T cells, USP18 is highly expressed in naive, effector/memory, and natural regulatory T cells.16 Microarray data indicate that a high level of Usp18 expression is also maintained in T helper 0, Th1, and Th17 cells but is diminished in Th2 cells and inducible regulatory T cells.16 However, the expression level of USP18 is differently regulated during T cell activation, tolerance, and effector differentiation.16 USP18 is induced by IFN-\u03b2 not only in lymphocytes but also in HO-1 human melanoma cells,6 in Huh-7.5 cells treated with irrelevant small-interfering RNAs,17 in the choroid plexus and in ependymal cells.18 Moreover, transfecting human hepatoblastoma HepG2 cells with hepatitis B virus (HBV) genome increased the expression of USP18 in those cells.19",

These mice are born at a normal ratio of WT to heterozygous littermates; however, homozygous knockout mice die of hydrocephalus ~2\u201319 weeks after birth.18 Further analysis showed that the difficulties in generating viable Usp18\u2212/\u2212 mice on a C57BL/6 background occurred because the deletion of USP18 results in an increase in the concentration of free and conjugated ISG15 at the fetomaternal interface and leads to fetal death.29 Interestingly, knockout mice generated on the FVB/N genetic background are more viable and do not exhibit the severe neurological symptoms that occur in mice generated on a C57BL/6 background, which develop brain injury because of necrosis of ependymal cells.18 This finding indicates that strain-specific modifiers may influence the neurological disorders and lethality induced by the absence of USP18. Although the role of ISG15 in embryonic development has been demonstrated,29 the neurological disorders in Usp18\u2212/\u2212 mice are not related to high expression of ISG15, because hydrocephalus also develops in mice with double knockout of Usp18 and Isg15.30 Homozygous Usp18-deficient mice are hypersensitive to IFN-I and die within 72 h after treatment with synthetic double-stranded RNA Poly I:C.26 A recent study showed that strong signaling of IFN-I in Usp18\u2212/\u2212 mice increases RANKL-mediated osteoclast differentiation and elevates the induction of osteoclastogenic cytokines such as IP-10 and IL-6, which causes osteopenia.31",

In our previous work using mice infected with VSV, we found that macrophages capture virus particles and suppress viral replication in the liver and the red pulp of the spleen in an interferon-dependent manner.14 However, the high expression of the gene encoding the inhibitory protein USP18 in CD169+ metallophilic macrophages reduces the responsiveness to IFN-I, which allows locally restricted replication of virus. This replication is essential to activate the adaptive immune system and to prevent the fatal outcome of infection (Figure 3a).

The results show that strong IFN-I signaling resulting from the absence of USP18 leads to less growth of Salmonella typhimurium in Usp18 knockout mice than in control mice.21 However, survival rates are slightly higher for Usp18-deficient mice because of their hypersusceptibility to LPS challenge. A more recent study by Richer et al. found that a missense mutation (ENU-induced mutation) in Usp18lty9 mice leads to lethal susceptibility to S. typhimurium and that the bacterial titer in liver and spleen is higher in these mice than in WT mice.11 Moreover, infection with S. typhimurium enhances IFN-I signaling and inflammatory response in Usp18lty9 mice. This immunological response is explained by the impairment of STAT4 phosphorylation and IFN-\u03b3 production as the result of STAT1 hyperactivation.11 Another group of researchers attributed the susceptibility of Usp18lty9 mice to S. typhimurium or Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection to elevated levels of IL-10, IL-1\u03b2, or IL-17, in addition to the deregulation of autophagy markers.10 Surprisingly, the contradictory nature of these two results obtained with Usp18 knockout mice and Usp18lty9 mice can be explained by either the different backgrounds of the mice or the specific ENU-induced mutation of Usp18. Other studies demonstrated the upregulation of USP18 during infection with Rickettsia conorii. As expected, this upregulation inhibits IFN-I-induced genes in human microvascular endothelial cells; however, whether USP18 plays a role in controlling bacterial infection has not yet been fully clarified.73, 74",

The priming of autoreactive CD8+ T cells requires the presentation of autoantigen to CD8+ T cells. This presentation can occur during a viral infection that resembles cross-reactive epitopes of beta islet cells. DCs are considered to be mainly responsible for this process. A mouse model showed that the absence of DCs inhibits the viral replication that resembles autoantigen and, consequently, inhibits the onset of diabetes. Because DCs express more USP18 than do other types of cells, the lack of a response to the antiviral effect of IFN-I leads to augmented viral replication and a sufficient amount of autoantigen. Knocking down USP18 expression inhibits viral replication and consequently does not lead to autoimmune diabetes15 (Figure 3b).",

The IFNAR2 binding site is located from exons 9\u201311. A mutation in amino-acid position 361 from Leucine (L, red) to Phenylalanine (F) in exon 11 disables USP18 protein from binding to the IFNAR2 subunit",

USP18 itself regulates signaling through a negative feedback mechanism either by inhibiting the binding of JAK1 to the IFNAR2 subunit or the IFNLR1 subunit, or by inhibiting the ubiquitination of the TAK1-TAB complex of TNFR1. (b) After ISGylation of ISG15 via a three enzymatic process, USP18 can deISGylate the ubiquitin-like protein ISG15 from ISG15-conjugated substrate by cleaving the isopeptide bond between ISG15 and the substrate. Lacking of USP18 leads to an increase signaling of IFN-I, IFN-III, TNF-\u03b1 and high levels of conjugated ISG15",

(a) USP18 inhibits IFNAR signaling, which leads to enforced viral replication in CD169+ macrophages. This replication guarantees sufficient amount of antigen, which is processed and presented via MHC complexes to activate the adaptive immune system. Lack of USP18 strengthens the IFN-I signaling, inhibits viral replication and reduces the presentation of processed antigen and consequently diminished adaptive immune system activation. (b) In case of enforced viral replication in dendritic cells of a virus resembling an autoantigen, autoreactive CD8+ T cells will be primed, which leads to autoimmune diseases such as type I diabetes, whereas USP18 deficiency reduces the priming of autoreactive CD8+ T cells and onset of autoimmune diabetes owing to inhibition of enforced viral replication",
