            "text": "Conservation medicine is the study of health relationships occurring at the interface of humans, animals, and ecosystems. It may be considered a meta-discipline: a field of study that incorporates the tools and perspectives of as many different scientific disciplines as necessary in order to address challenges or test hypotheses related to global health issues. Conservation medicine shares a similar philosophy with EcoHealth, One Health, and Global Health, all of which recognize the clear relationship between human and animal health; however, conservation medicine is also closely allied with the values of conservation biology, and recognizes that health and disease are fundamentally related to the integrity of ecosystems. Thus, understanding the importance of ecosystem functionality in the context of health is essential to conservation medicine, and it draws on the principles of both ecology and applied medicine as an approach to human and animal disease issues.",

The result is more than a collection of individual disciplinary perspectives; it aims to produce a fully integrated interdisciplinary analysis of a complex problem informing a practical applied conclusion (i.e., the whole is more than the sum of its parts). Many scientists have naturally cultivated a broad-based view of science throughout their careers, and some have worked as part of large-scale, multi-dimensional teams. Professionals from different fields that are practicing in a conservation medicine setting have generally developed their careers through perseverance, experience, and sometimes through the pursuit of multiple academic degrees. However, most will admit that experience and determination alone may not provide the necessary tools and skills that could be better developed through a focused academic training program.",

We contend that such a program could provide the scientific cross-training and interdisciplinary approaches that are missing from traditional academic programs. A training program that concentrates specifically on fundamental conservation medicine skills could accelerate achievement and more effectively provide the versatility that is needed to adequately address the challenges in conservation medicine. Just as conservation biology struggled to establish itself in the 1980s as a new interdisciplinary field, beginning with 16 programs in 1990 and growing to more than 108 programs in 99 colleges and universities (Meine et al. 2006), conservation medicine is now facing similar academic scrutiny and needs a place in the scholarly arena to support its legitimacy.",

            "text": "Nipah virus was first discovered during an outbreak of encephalitis among pig-farmers in Peninsular Malaysia (Chua et al. 2000). Following the initial outbreak investigation, a large-scale multi-year collaborative study was launched by the Henipavirus Ecology Research Group (HERG\u2014http://www.henipavirus.net). This group used a conservation medicine approach to test two major hypotheses for Nipah virus\u2019 emergence. The first postulated that Nipah virus emerged due to climatic effects from El Ni\u00f1o-caused forest fires that created tremendous atmospheric haze, driving Nipah virus-infected bats from Sumatra to Malaysia (Chua et al. 2002). The second hypothesis was that the size, structure, and management of the pig farm where Nipah emerged had allowed the virus, once introduced to pigs by fruit bats, to persist and cause a wide-spread epidemic (Daszak et al. 2006). Epidemiology, veterinary medicine, and ecology were involved in examining the health data and management practices of the pigs on the index farm. These data were incorporated into a mathematical model which simulated the introduction and spread of the virus in pigs on the farm (Pulliam et al. 2007). Wildlife biology and ecology were used to study the population demographics and dynamics of the pteropid fruit bat and better understand the risk of future outbreaks (Epstein et al. 2007). Molecular biology, epidemiology, and classical virology were used to study Nipah virus in wild bat populations and peri-domestic animals using population-based studies and laboratory-based experimental infections. These studies gave the team a better understanding of the dynamics of the virus in wild populations, as well as the pathogenesis of Nipah virus in bats and its ability to survive in the environment under various experimental conditions (Epstein et al. 2007; Halpin and Mungall 2007; Fogarty et al. 2008). Ultimately, all aspects of the study were necessary to understand the factors that caused Nipah virus to emerge and also the risks associated with future outbreaks [Pulliam et al., submitted for publication].",

Consequently, a good start to a career in conservation medicine would be through a broad-based, liberal arts undergraduate education, because it exposes the student to a multitude of viewpoints and perspectives, opening their eyes to the wider societal concerns that intersect with conservation efforts. Efforts are needed to bring the concepts of conservation medicine and ecosystem health into the undergraduate curriculum. Using real-life examples of team-based conservation medicine problem solving in the undergraduate classroom will highlight the importance of communication and networking between community partners, organizations, agencies, and scientists. Early exposure to these concepts will provide students with a framework for problem solving that they can bring into their professional or graduate training, or pursue jobs that allow them to apply those values, and will introduce them to the options for incorporating conservation medicine into their future career goals.",

Another example is at the Nelson Institute of Environmental Studies at University of Wisconsin which encourages the cross-disciplinary approach in its undergraduate and graduate programs to foster translational skills in environmental sciences. Programs such as the Certificate on Humans and the Global Environment were created as supplements to any graduate major on campus to prepare students to effectively devise solutions to interdisciplinary environmental problems. Other opportunities exist in targeted technical training programs (nurses, research technicians, lab technicians); certificates and diplomas; short courses and workshops; traditional degree programs from bachelors degrees to doctoral degrees; and combined degree programs such as MD or DVM/MPH, and MD or DVM/PhD.",

Programs are already saturated by content and operate within a rigid academic curriculum necessary to produce qualified graduates within an existing discipline. Time constraints make it difficult to justify adding new courses, or even new material within existing courses, at the expense of well established core topics. In addition, cross-fertilization between departments, schools, and programs remains a challenge for all of these programs. Creating opportunities for interdisciplinary interaction with other programs may be logistically impossible and require innovative solutions such as exploring the use of distance education or website-based courses to provide material to students. Administrative structures between disciplines within universities can also present significant barriers to program development for faculty interested in interdisciplinary collaborative research and teaching. This occurs despite major funding initiatives calling for institutions to develop collaborative multi-disciplinary programs, such as the Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) grants program offered by National Science Foundation (NSF 2006) which funds students involved in interdisciplinary PhD programs.",

Currently, there are only a few programs worldwide that offer an advanced degree specifically in conservation medicine, and most of these have been created by veterinary schools. For example, Murdoch University in Australia offers a Master of Veterinary Studies in Conservation Medicine, as well as a pared down \u201cPostgraduate Certificate in Veterinary Conservation Medicine\u201d; The University of Liverpool offers a \u201cVeterinary Conservation Medicine\u201d program as an intercalated honors course attached to a Bachelor of Veterinary Science degree (BVSc). Both programs incorporate the overarching philosophy and multi-disciplinary nature of conservation medicine and offer options of \u201cfield placement or a research project,\u201d but are only open to veterinarians. Other graduate programs incorporate principles of conservation medicine, but are not exclusively devoted to this topic. Yet other programs facilitate an individual graduate student to customize their program to include conservation medicine, such as Michigan State University\u2019s (MSU) Graduate Specialization in Fish & Wildlife Disease Ecology & Conservation Medicine. Although conservation medicine implies a medical degree, the interdisciplinary nature of this field should not require it and, in fact, should encourage more cross-fertilization. Opportunities for non-veterinarians are more limited and need to be encouraged to effectively engage other critical disciplines.\n",

This situation is similar in other bridge fields. For example, results of a survey on training recommendations for careers in wildlife medicine (Mazet et al. 2006) suggested that a second graduate degree is one of the most important types of additional training for success in this specialized field of veterinary medicine. What type of additional degree is most appropriate and most useful? For a large proportion of students completing a graduate or professional degree such as a PhD, MD, or DVM, a second round of four or more years in graduate school for another degree is often not practical. In some cases, institutional constraints in two separate degrees may still not easily enable the interdisciplinary perspective that is required by conservation medicine. Alternatively, 1\u20132 years of intensive scholastic training following a primary graduate or professional degree could be sufficient to obtain the skills required to successfully augment an individual\u2019s expertise with a conservation medicine approach.",

This will certainly be a composite of vocabulary and concepts from other areas of science, but it may also lead to new hybridized terminology and concepts that more easily bridge disciplinary gaps.

No DOL statistics were available for \u201cWildlife Veterinarians.\u201d Two of these DOL occupations, \u201cEnvironmental Engineers\u201d and \u201cEnvironmental Scientists and Specialists,\u201d were among the top 25 fastest growing occupations nationally, both had projected growth rates of 25% from 2006 to 2016.
