A definitive etiology of the problem has not yet been conclusively determined though previous reports indicate the involvement of peste des petits ruminant (PPR)-like virus, Streptococcus equi subsp. equi, Pasteurella, Mannheimia, and Mycoplasma species (Yigezu et al. 1997; Roger et al. 2001). Despite some efforts made far, there was no substantial result obtained from the investigation of the disease. More investigative efforts are still in need for the identification of the true cause of the problem so as to design sustainable control strategies.",

This is quite suggestive of the accepted idea that these organisms live as a commensal in the upper respiratory tract, invading the lung under conditions of stress. Stress factors have been reported to suppress the mucocilliary clearance mechanism and the overall respiratory defensive system which allows the proliferation of bacterial commensals in the respiratory tract and an abrupt shift from commensal to pathogen (Caswell 2014). Similar trend of bacterial distribution was also observed by Azizollah et al. (2009) and Al-Tarazi (2001) during their bacteriological studies on the respiratory tracts of camels.",

Hence, the possible role of these bacteria in camel respiratory disease complex under various conditions should not be overlooked though they have not been considered as major causative agents. Very recently, an emerging Middle-East respiratory syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has been reported in camels of the Middle East and beyond (Funk et al. 2016; Ali et al. 2017). We have also isolated a variety of viruses from respiratory tracts of Ethiopian camels (Ayelet et al. 2013).

Accordingly, increased level of resistance among the respiratory pathogens against the commonly used antimicrobials in respiratory tract infections was observed (Table 2). The majority of camel respiratory pathogens were found susceptible to norfloxacin, streptomycin, and gentamicin but resistant to the action of ampicillin and tetracycline. This is in agreement with the results of El-Mahmood et al. (2009) and Serin et al. (2010). In addition, a similar resistance of S. equi subsp. equi and K. pneumoniae to tetracycline was recorded (Nkang et al. 2009). Fazlani et al. (2006) reported a high level of resistance of M. haemolytica and P. multocida to streptomycin. In this study, however, both organisms were found to be susceptible to streptomycin, while they were resistant to tetracycline and ampicillin. This represents a shift of resistance from streptomycin to tetracycline and ampicillin. This may be associated with the present lesser usage or misuse of streptomycin for animal diseases unlike tetracycline which is commonly used for most animal diseases today.",

The people in the study areas have easy access to purchase tetracycline and ampicillin from the private pharmacies and any open market without prescription. They have also the opportunity of getting many drugs from NGO\u2019s working in livestock production, but they have a strong desire to tetracycline. As a result, they provide health care by themselves. This probably means that the selective pressure of these commonly used antibiotics on the bacteria circulating in the community could have resulted in high frequency of resistance among the isolates. Apart from ease of accessibility, these drugs have been found to be adulterated and therefore used at a very low dosage. Therefore, there is a need for practitioners and researchers to be aware of the bacterial flora of the camels and of their antibiotic sensitivities so as to be informed of the appropriate antibiotics to be used in the course of respiratory infections and control programs.",

It is a multifactorial process among which a variety of bacterial species have been associated with respiratory problems. In the present investigation, S. equi subsp. equi, P. multocida, M. haemolytica, K. pneumoniae, S. aureus, and B. bronchiseptica have been isolated at much higher proportions from the lungs of pneumonic than the apparently healthy camels. Therefore, these bacterial spp. could be considered as candidate pathogens causing camel respiratory infections in the study area. Furthermore, the isolates have shown considerable resistance to commonly prescribed antimicrobials in the country calling for the need to conduct susceptibility testing for control of camel respiratory infections in the area. Therefore, we believe the data in this work contributes to diagnosis and control of respiratory problems in camels, which are important livestock spp. in arid and semi-arid regions in Ethiopia, in particular, and the tropics, in general.",
