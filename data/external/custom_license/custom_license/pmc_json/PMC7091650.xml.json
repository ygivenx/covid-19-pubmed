Bats are indeed distinctive in many ways. In addition to being the only mammals capable of powered flight, they are astonishingly diverse and widespread. With over 1,200 species worldwide, bats represent roughly 20% of all mammalian species, with representatives virtually everywhere humans dwell. Bats are also an indisputably rich reservoir for pathogens1. \u201cEven if you compensate for research bias in the literature, bats have a disproportionately high number of zoonotic pathogens associated with them compared with other mammals,\u201d says Epstein.",

Baker has found that her bats maintain relatively high levels of interferons, signaling molecules that rouse the initial immune defense against infection and are normally only generated after host immune cells detect a virus. \u201cWe think this is giving them a bit of a head start,\u201d says Baker. \u201cThen, when they\u2019re infected, they can clear the virus much more rapidly.\u201d Her bats also seem to mount a different kind of interferon response from humans and rodents, lacking a strong inflammatory component that could otherwise inflict serious tissue damage. Schountz hypothesizes that some viruses survive in bats by churning out interferon-blocking proteins, which could in turn accelerate the evolution of deadlier viruses that can essentially overwhelm the human immune system before it can react. \u201cHuman cells may have little chance to combat the virus, which then gets free rein,\u201d says Schountz. \u201cThat leads to virus replication, and subsequent pathology and cell death.\u201d",

Most research is focused on known reservoirs of disease, but Baker hopes that heightened interest in bats and the influx of data from projects like Bat 1K will help the community converge on broadly representative \u2018common denominators\u2019. \u201cWe need to get a few model species so we can start sharing reagents and be more productive in what we\u2019re doing,\u201d says Baker.",

And unfortunately, human activity continues to create opportunities for spillover, with ongoing urbanization and agricultural expansion steadily pushing bats and people into closer proximity. Climate change could also increase the risk. For example, Schountz is monitoring Jamaican fruit bats (Artibeus jamaicensis) infected with Tacaribe virus\u2014a pathogen that can sicken and kill these animals. Tacaribe is closely related to numerous dangerous viruses, and although it does not currently infect humans, it could acquire that potential. \u201cThe Florida Keys is as far north as they get right now, but climate change seems to be driving this bat species further north,\u201d he says. \u201cI get nervous about that.\u201d",
