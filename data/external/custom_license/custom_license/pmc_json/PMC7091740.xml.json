Although rhinovirus is known to replicate and cause symptoms within the upper respiratory tract (URT), its potential role in lower respiratory tract (LRT) infection is controversial.1, 2 Data regarding the potential etiologic role of rhinovirus in LRT infection within the HCT population are sparse. Three previous studies of a combined 181 HCT patients identified 16 patients with respiratory failure and evidence of LRT rhinovirus.3, 4, 5 In each of these cases, however, either a copathogen was identified that likely contributed to disease or disease developed within 10 days of HCT, while patients were still suffering the effects of chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy that may have contributed to respiratory failure. We present two cases of fatal pneumonia in HCT patients likely caused by rhinovirus.",

Both patients in our report developed symptomatic viral shedding of rhinovirus in the URT in the weeks before their pulmonary deterioration. At the time of pulmonary deterioration, CT scans for both patients revealed patchy diffuse ground-glass opacities consistent with viral infection. Rhinovirus was the only pathogen detected in the BAL of case 1, and although case 2 grew mixed oral flora on BAL in addition to his positive rhinovirus, he was placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics, and his clinical course, imaging studies and subsequent open lung biopsy were not felt to be consistent with bacterial pneumonia. Although a nonspecific pathologic finding of lung injury, BOOP is associated with viral infection, and we speculate that rhinovirus may have been a trigger for BOOP in case 2.",
