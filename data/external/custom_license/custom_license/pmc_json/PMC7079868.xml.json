A multidisciplinary group of scientists from Manitoba used the combination of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) and a quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometer to identify two novel proteins associated with the virus believed to be responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [1]. At that time the SARS outbreak had spread from China to Hong Kong, Vietnam, Canada, the USA, and several other countries leading to increasing worldwide concern of a pandemic. The unique attributes of mass spectrometry, especially using hybrid instrumentation, allowed rapid identification and characterization of possible immunogens that may be useful for early diagnosis or prophylaxis of SARS.",

Although these QqToF instruments have been commercially available for less than 10 years, they are widespread because of their full scan sensitivity, good mass spectral resolution and mass accuracy, and their capability to perform MS and product ion MS/MS analyses. This kind of \u201chybridization\u201d in mass spectrometry is now driving new instrument development because it allows the addition (or replacement) of sections of conventional tandem mass spectrometers with devices that provide different or superior performance characteristics. Novel mass spectrometers have been reported recently, but this is relatively rare. Much of the commercial instrument development of \u201cnew\u201d instrumentation takes the form of this hybridization approach.",

Quadrupoles, ion traps, and ToF sections all provide unique capabilities for mass analysis and ion processing that is proving to be useful for answering specific analytical challenges. Several of the more common mass analyzers are illustrated in Fig. 1.

Although good mass accuracy has been reported previously for LC/MS/MS [7] analyses using a conventional triple quadrupole and moderate mass resolution, it is the advent of the narrower peak widths that has spurred interest in the use of triple quadrupole platform for accurate mass measurements. The published capabilities [5, 6] suggest that some combination of internal and external mass calibration should allow reasonable mass assignment accuracy with the enhanced resolution triple quadrupole.",

By using a ToF for the final stage of mass analysis in a tandem instrument this provides the benefits of high resolution (ca. 5,000\u201320,000 FWHM), good mass assignment accuracy (<5 ppm), high sensitivity, and the ability to record a complete mass spectrum for each pulse of ions injected into the device [8]. Most commercial QqToF instruments employ an orthogonal geometry for injection of the ions into the ToF section, which decouples the ion velocity in the ion beam from the TOF axis [9]. This gives rise to a low initial velocity along the ToF axis and results in excellent resolution and a nearly linear mass calibration scale. Both of these attributes have contributed to the very good reported mass assignment accuracy (<5 ppm) [10].",

The idea here is that a population of ions characterized by different charge states can be collisionally cooled to thermal energies via trapping and storing in the collision cell. The trapped ions experience different axial DC barriers to exit the collision cell that are proportional to their charge states. As the magnitude of the repulsive exit DC barrier is reduced, singly charged ions are released toward the ToF section first, followed by doubly charged ions, and so on.

In both cases the linear ion trap adds additional functionality by offering a method to select precursor ions, induce fragmentation, and enhance duty cycle when using continuous ion sources, such as electrospray. They have also published fundamental investigations on resonance excitation processes in linear ion traps that precede ToF mass analyzers [23].",

They have been particularly concerned with protein identification and characterization in very complicated mixtures. Their goal has been to expand the dynamic range of the FTMS by utilizing as much of the ICR trap capacity as possible to store and mass analyze the less abundant ions. FTMS instruments are ion trapping devices and can suffer from mass spectral distortions from space charge. Smith\u2019s group has devised an instrument that, under software control, sequentially resonantly ejects and eliminates abundant species in an external linear quadrupole ion trap [34, 35, 36, 37, 39, 40]. This allows preferential filling of the ICR cell with the increasingly less abundant ions in a stepwise manner.

            "text": "There have been two notable developments in the use of linear ion traps as true mass spectrometers using either mass-selective radial [43] or axial ion ejection [44]. Mass-selective radial ion ejection involves trapping the ions in a four-rod quadrupole structure and resonantly ejecting the ions radially through a slot cut in one of the quadrupole rods. Schwartz et al. have demonstrated that replacement of a conventional three-dimensional ion trap with a radial ejection linear ion trap yields detection limit improvements of about 5 times as well as the ability to conduct all of the standard ion trap scan modes [43]. The sensitivity enhancement is due to the considerably larger ion capacity of linear ion traps, which has been estimated to be more than an order of magnitude larger than that of a conventional ion trap. High ejection efficiencies were reported, despite the fact that the ions being ejected from this radial ejection linear ion trap emerge from a slot cut in one of the quadrupole rods [43].",

A commercial product with a QqQlinear ion trap geometry combines all of the features of a conventional triple quadrupole mass spectrometer and a linear ion trap [47, 48]. One product ion scan mode uses the first quadrupole for precursor ion selection and the collision cell for fragmentation prior to ion introduction into the linear ion trap [47]. The analytical mass scan is conducted with the linear ion trap. During the analytical scan the instrument can accumulate ions from the ion source enhancing duty cycle, and ultimately, sensitivity [47]. The advantages to this tandem-in-space approach are that only the fragment and residual precursor ions are admitted into the ion trap thereby preserving dynamic range. Also, since the fragmentation step and the final mass analysis steps are spatially separated there is no inherent low mass cutoff in the product ion spectra. Sensitivity gains of factors greater than 500 times that of standard triple quadrupole product ion scan mode have been reported [47].",

The combination of what on the surface appears to be dissimilar mass analyzers, or mass filters, has allowed mass measurement instrumentation to develop beyond the conventional tandem-in-space and tandem-in-time platforms.
