There is extensive literature on the synergistic effect between viruses and bacteria in the pathogenesis of respiratory infections [2]. Regardless of whether they are viral or bacterial, the presence of pathogens in the respiratory tract triggers the involvement of the innate and adaptive mucosal immune systems. Innate mucosal immunity is related to the function of the epithelial lining of the respiratory tract, including the production of antimicrobial peptides, the cytotoxic actions of NK cells, and the engulfment of pathogens by monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils. A key event among the actions of the acquired immune system is the production of IgA molecules.",

There is a large body of literature supporting the association between viral infections and asthma, independently of age, phenotype, and asthma stage during which the viral infection occurs [34]. The role of bacterial infections, however, is controversial and is less well-established compared to that of viruses. Of note, we detected the presence of viruses in nearly 60 % of the patients with severe asthma who required intensive care support. Among our patients with asthma who had bacterial infections, we identified the strains H. influenza and C. pneumoniae. Our clinical observations are in agreement with those reported in the literature, indicating that in patients with asthma, viral infections are more frequently associated with asthma crises, regardless of the phenotype, asthma duration, and natural history of the disease, but bacterial infections lead to an increase in inflammation and a worsening of the disease [35, 36].",
