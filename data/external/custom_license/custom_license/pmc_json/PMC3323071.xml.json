For example, brucellosis topics covered a wide range of material, from economic aspects of control in Mongolia to characterization of Brucella isolates from feral swine in coastal South Carolina. Another presentation concerned the increasingly appreciated role of wildlife in the dynamic epidemiology of other zoonotic infections, such as tuberculosis. Scientists also explored the intricate routes prions follow between wildlife and domestic animals; between sheep, cattle, and humans; and between the tongue and brain of infected animals.",

It included a global view, a report on national preparedness by Israeli hospitals, and examples of research that may eventually help experts coping with bioterrorism but would also unfortunately be accessible to persons with malicious intent.",

In the field of xenotransplantation, key components of a source-animal production facility were described. The feasibility of breeding pigs free of designated pathogens offers hope for wide use of xenotransplantation in the near future.",

Controversial zoonotic viruses were given an important place in the conference. These included hepatitis E virus, with similar strains causing liver disease in swine and humans; Borna disease virus, causing neurologic disease in various species of animals as well as, debatably, psychiatric disorders in humans; and the recently discovered severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2013associated coronavirus and its yet-undefined animal reservoir. The recent mapping of the genome of Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis, the etiologic agent of Jhone\u2019s disease in cows, brought some hope in solving the long-lasting dispute on its role in the pathogenesis of Crohn\u2019s disease in humans.",
