The standard of care to identify respiratory viral pathogens at our large pediatric referral facility utilizes Direct Fluorescent Antibody (DFA), with viral culture on DFA-negative specimens. GenMark probe testing was added to standard-of-care testing for a total of 300 samples from inpatients during the 2012-13 respiratory season. 200 samples negative by DFA/culture and 100 positive by either DFA or viral culture were used. Clinical data were collected. Length of stay was only calculated for those \u2264 21 days (n= 268), to exclude hospitalizations unlikely related to viral illness.",

Results by virus are listed in the table. There was no association with longer hospitalization or higher acuity among subjects with multiple viruses detected, or with influenza or RSV alone. Longer length of stay and higher acuity was only associated with Coronavirus. OC43 was the most common coronavirus identified (71%) and these associations remained significant. Younger subjects were more likely to have RSV, HRV, and > 1 virus.\n",
