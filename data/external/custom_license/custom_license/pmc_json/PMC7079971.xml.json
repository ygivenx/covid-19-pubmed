            "text": "In 2007, the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine established a Task Force for Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Triage during an Influenza Epidemic or Mass Disaster to develop recommendations and standard operating procedures (SOPs). At that time worldwide intensive care, infectious disease/microbiology and pulmonary societies sent representatives to participate. Based on a literature review and expert opinion, a Delphi process was used to define the essential topics. This review provides the recommendations and SOPs of the Task Force focusing on the ICU and H1N1. Key points for each of these topics are noted in Table 1. The information should also be helpful for other hospital areas and other mass casualty events (MCEs). Preliminary information regarding H1N1 patients is available. Approximately 8% of H1N1 patients are hospitalized [1, 2] (23 per 100,000 population) [3], and 6.5\u201325% of these require being in the ICU [1, 3, 4] (28.7 per million inhabitants) [5] for a median of 7\u201312 days [5, 6] with a peak bed occupancy of 6.3\u201310.6 per million inhabitants [5]; 65\u201397% of ICU patients require mechanical ventilation [2, 5\u20137], with median ventilatory duration for survivors of 7\u201315 days [4, 6, 7]; 5\u201322% require renal replacement therapy [5, 6], and 28-day ICU mortality is 14\u201340% [4, 6, 7]. Search terms used for the literature review are in Appendix Table 1. The authors' first-hand experience with emergency responses is found in Appendix Table 2.\n",

The institutional plan should account for the provision of care across this surge capacity spectrum so that the maximum number of patients can be treated during each phased response appropriate to the demands. Hospitals should be able to increase their ICU beds to the maximal extent by expanding ICUs and other areas with appropriate beds and monitors. Increases beyond 25% over usual capacity are unlikely with the current H1N1 virus. Future mutations, outbreaks or MCE may require maximum feasible expansion of capacity. This maximal feasible number will vary between institutions and countries, and be determined by the number of excess ICU patients, the usual ICU bed proportion of the total population and the maximum feasible expansion. One group has recommended a 300% expansion target, but many facilities may not be able to reach this target and should consider phased expansion to double capacity [9].",

Non-clinical risks predominantly relate to staff members, the most concerning being those that may undermine confidence. Lack of confidence may influence attendance and willingness to undertake challenging additional responsibilities and hence impact on patient care. Therefore, in the presence of uncertainty, staff protection should start at the highest level and then be gradually reduced. Institutions should prepare formal reassurance plans for legal protection and for assisting staff working outside their normal domain. Debriefing and communication may reduce psychological stress for both staff and patients. Given the medical-legal implications of many decisions, comprehensive documentation is essential. Support of relevant professional organizations and medical/nursing authorities will also benefit members working outside their normal areas of expertise.",

The low rate of nosocomial transmission among ICU patients during the recent H1N1 flu outbreak [4, 7] may be because of following the robust infection control procedures proven to reduce the risk of contracting severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) from patients [32]. For diseases with high rates of transmission, the risk to staff versus the benefit to patients should be weighed. Although wearing surgical masks may provide similar benefits [33], there are still concerns that masks may not be sufficiently protective for the number of aerosol-generating procedures in the ICU. Staff training in PPE use (e.g., fit-testing for N95 respirators, avoiding contamination when placing/removing, environmental cleaning, etc.) is essential [34]. The use of negative pressure isolation rooms with adequate ventilation facilities is also recommended although they may be limited in many ICUs and expanded areas. The possibility of reducing the risk of airborne pathogens by modifying ICU design [35] may also be of benefit.",

Experts have recommended accepting patients likely to benefit most from ICU [27, 28] or on a \u2018first come, first served\u2019 basis [29]. Each institution should determine its own triage criteria using senior clinicians in a transparent fashion. All critically ill patients will be assessed by a triage officer who should apply inclusion and exclusion criteria together possibly with a prioritization tool to determine qualification for ICU admission [17, 27\u201329] (Tables 3, 4, 5 are one example to consider adapting to the situation). The Table 5 prioritization tool utilizes the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score [47, 48]. The tool has limitations and has not yet been validated. Although SOFA day-1 scores have been shown to be significantly associated with 28-day and overall mortality in H1N1 patients, little improvement in SOFA scores between admission and day 3 casts doubt on the usefulness of re-assessing patients on day 2 [4, 7]. Patients not meeting inclusion criteria remain on the ward and can be re-evaluated. All ICU patients at the time of the MCE will also be assessed for eligibility based on the same criteria. Patients admitted to the ICU should subsequently be reassessed and re-categorized. When resources permit, emergency triage should cease in a graduated fashion by altering prioritization criteria and then exclusion thresholds.\n",

Training should begin as soon as possible followed by supervised simulations to ensure optimal use of available facilities and to minimize infections [53]. PP techniques and reduction of environmental contamination should preferably be taught by infection control staff with assistance from ICU directors [54]. Interventions aimed at changing clinical practice show that outreach visits, posted reminders, interactive educational meetings and other multifaceted interventions were effective, but time constraints and potential lethality of the disease were limiting factors [55]. Seminars, on-site demonstrations, problem-based learning and simulations are valuable when time is of the essence. In the SARS epidemic, use of a simulator allowed effective training of 275 workers in 2 weeks [56\u201358]. Teleconferencing involving clinicians and representatives from public health, infection control, infectious diseases, hospital administration and government together with website dissemination of instructional materials (http://www.eunid.eu/) is a useful tool for updating knowledge during a pandemic [50, 51, 59].",

Patients categorized as \u2018blue/black\u2019 remain on the ward and receive palliative care with active medical therapy at the discretion of the primary care physician with patient and/or family input. Patients admitted to ICU should be reassessed at days 2 and 5 and re-categorized. Decisions beyond ICU day 5 will be dependent upon resource availability. Although this triage procedure is based only on expert opinion [17], an ICU trial with reappraisal at day 5 has proved useful in mechanically ventilated cancer patients [46]. It should be noted, however, that ventilated H1N1 patients had a median ventilatory duration in survivors of 7-15 days [4, 6, 7] so reevaluation may have to be delayed",

It should consist of the hospital chief, heads of all major clinical and support departments, and key supply and logistic divisions. The Hospital EECG should determine whether to open new wards, re-deploy staff, suspend or redirect services (e.g., elective operations), prioritize the allocation of hospital supplies (including personal protective equipment), endorse triage policies, and formalize infection control and occupational health policies. The ICU EECG provides the Hospital EECG with information such as ICU functionality, capacity, projected staff and supply requirements, and preferred triage and discharge policies. The ICU EECG ensures that relevant policies agreed upon and endorsed by the HEECG are implemented within the ICU. It is made up of at least the ICU director, a deputy, the head nurse and deputy, and one or more triage officers. In the case of multiple ICUs in a hospital under different administrative authorities, each ICU should have an independent ICU EECG. An additional combined ICUEECG may be considered desirable. Other potentially important interfaces are shown",
