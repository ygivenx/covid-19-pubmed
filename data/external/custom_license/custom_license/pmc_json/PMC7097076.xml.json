            "text": "The lung is a complex organ consisting of at least 40 different cell lineages1. Following postnatal growth, the lung epithelium slowly turns over under normal conditions, but its regenerative capacity can be activated substantially after injury2. Resident lung stem/progenitor cells (referred to collectively as LSCs throughout this Article) are responsible for this epithelial repair and tissue homeostasis. Several stem cell niches have been identified as being located in terminal bronchioles or bronchoalveolar junctions3,4,5,6. These putative LSCs are susceptible to infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) associated coronavirus6,7, leading to deterioration of lung tissue and loss of lung repair capacity. LSCs have also been found to be able to renew and proliferate to form epithelial cells in vivo4. They are potentially useful in regenerative therapy, for example, in repairing damaged lung tissue in patients. The advances and obstacles of using various strategies and assays to establish the regenerative potential of endogenous LSCs have been reviewed recently8,9.",

Achieving this goal requires the use of a highly sensitive imaging modality, together with a highly stable (both biologically and photophysically) imaging probe, to allow tracking of the transplanted cells in vivo over an extended period of time. Compared with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), optical imaging offers the advantages of higher sensitivity, larger in vitro and in vivo throughputs, and greater potential for clinical translation10. However, existing fluorescence-based technologies such as dye labelling11 and in vitro transfection of cells with plasmids to express fluorescent proteins (for example, GFP)12,13 or non-fluorescent compounds (for example, luciferase)14 often suffer from the problems of photobleaching, interference from background tissue autofluorescence and/or low transfection efficiency for primary cells. Although quantum dots have been adopted and highly regarded as alternatives15,16, their application is hampered by their potential toxicity and facile degradation in vitro17 as well as in vivo18.",

            "text": "Fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs)19, a new member of the nanocarbon family20, have emerged recently as a novel nanotechnology imaging probe for biological applications21,22. The nanoscale diamond material is chemically robust, biologically inert, and non-toxic at both cellular23,24 and whole-organism levels25,26. A number of experiments have demonstrated that bare FND particles can be readily taken up by cells through clathrin-mediated endocytosis27, but with an exceptionally low exocytosis activity28,29. When excited by green-yellow light, the fluorophores (for example, negatively charged nitrogen\u2013vacancy centres, NV\u2212) built into the FND emit perfectly stable far-red emission (\u223c600\u2013800 nm) with a fluorescence lifetime (\u03c4) greater than 15 ns, even in cells30,31. This lifetime is substantially longer than that (\u03c4 \u2248 1\u20134 ns) of the endogenous and exogenous fluorophores commonly used in cell biology32, making it possible to separate FND emission from the strong autofluorescence background of host tissue using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) and various nanosecond time-gating techniques31,33. In this work, we show that primary cells such as LSCs can be spontaneously labelled with FNDs by endocytosis, and that the labelling does not eliminate cellular functions such as division, proliferation and differentiation. By combining FND\u2013FLIM with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and immunostaining analysis, we have been able to identify, unequivocally, transplanted cells in histological lung sections after intravenous (i.v.) injection of the FND-labelled LSCs into mice for more than a week, with single-cell resolution. The tissue-specific engraftment capacity of these cells is further elucidated with lung injury models.",

This behaviour closely resembles that of many other cell types including HeLa cells, 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes and 489-2.1 multipotent stromal cells27,29. An extraordinary feature of the FND labelling is that in addition to far-red fluorescence, data collected in the side scatter (SSC) channel also provide useful information on FND uptake (Fig. 2a)29. This is attributable to the fact that diamond has the highest refractive index of all transparent minerals36, and diamond nanocrystallites scatter light strongly in the visible region and thus produce strong SSC signals. By properly gating the bivariate plot (SSC versus Far-Red) in quadrants, two distinct separate populations of FND-labelled and unlabelled cells could be detected in these two channels (Fig. 2a). The double-positive cell population, denoted SSC+Far-Red+, was subsequently identified as FND-labelled cells without additional staining.",

Immediately after FND labelling, the mean fluorescence intensity of the LSCs was \u223c45-fold greater than that of the unlabelled control cells. A successive decrease in fluorescence intensity by half occurred approximately every 48 h due to cell division. LSCs labelled with FNDs at 100 \u00b5g ml\u22121 could be identified for more than a week (approximately four divisions), after which the cells became confluent and stopped proliferating. The identification of LSCs in the cell culture up to day 15 revealed that the extent of FND exocytosis was low29. Further analysis by fluorescence microscopy showed that both untreated and FND-labelled LSCs were able to undergo morphological alterations and express SP-C on day 7 after induction (Fig. 2c,d). The expression of SP-C in the cytoplasm of the FND-labelled cells implies that the endocytic FNDs do not eliminate the apparent biological functions of the LSCs.",

Organs and tissues including lungs, kidneys, liver and spleen were collected for examination on days 1, 4 and 7 after injection. Flow cytometric analysis confirmed that the injected LSCs preferentially resided in the lungs, and not in other organs (Supplementary Fig. S7). On day 1, \u223c1.64% of the total population of viable pulmonary cells appeared as FND-labelled LSCs (Fig. 3a).

In this analysis, the gating thresholds in the bivariate plots were carefully chosen by referring to the in vitro result (Fig. 2a) as well as the profiles of the saline controls (Supplementary Fig. S8) to ensure good reliability. With a false positive rate of less than 0.05%, as determined from the controls, the observed approximately tenfold decline in the SSC+Far-Red+ subpopulation was a reflection of the fact that most of the transplanted cells were not functionally engrafted. It is most likely that they were only initially trapped in the lung microvasculature and were eventually lost during the first week following transplantation.",

On day 1, the bronchiolar epithelium in the lung-injured mice was sparsely surrounded by CCSP+ cells in both the control and treatment groups (Fig. 4a), showing low degrees of lung repair. Although some progress in club cell regeneration occurred in the control on day 7, the bronchiolar epithelium of the mice injected with FND\u2013LSCs displayed a significantly greater repopulation of CCSP+ cells, that is, a greater regenerative capacity or a more rapid restoration of the lung epithelium (Fig. 4a).",

Further analysis by compound imaging with H&E staining and time-gated fluorescence (\u03c4 = 9\u201318 ns) revealed that the FND-labelled LSCs were preferentially localized in the terminal bronchioles of the lung-injured mice (Fig. 4c), in contrast to the localization of the cells in the subepithelium of bronchiolar airways in uninjured mice (Fig. 3b).",

It is therefore speculated that the pattern of the distribution of these FND-labelled cells may reflect different degrees of injury in the lung tissues. For instance, the clustered cells may represent regions that have sustained more injury from the naphthalene. A close examination for the co-localization of the FND-labelled cells with the CCSP (Fig. 5a) and pan-cytokeratin (Fig. 5b) epithelial markers by high-power fluorescence imaging with single-cell resolution confirmed that the transplanted LSCs were not entrapped in the microvascular network of the lung, but rather had been functionally engrafted and integrated in the bronchiolar epithelium.",

With Nv \u2248 7 \u00d7 106, Ps = 1.64% and Nt \u2248 5 \u00d7 105, the Ph for normal mice was estimated to be \u223c23% on day 1.

In contrast, the Ph for the lung injury model exhibited a much smaller decrease, with Ph \u2248 13% on day 1 and Ph \u2248 11% on day 7 (Fig. 4b). The distinct contrast between these two results provides compelling evidence that the lodgement of the transplanted FND-labelled cells in the injury models represents a \u2018pro-active\u2019 tissue-specific engraftment, instead of non-specific (or passive) entrapment.",

We conducted this analysis by acquiring images of H&E staining using a bright-field section scanner. From these images, the cells showing FND labelling were counted visually in randomly selected regions. To reduce potential biases in the quantitative assessment, measurements were performed for more than 30 visual fields per section for six randomly selected sections of each sample, by independent workers. The results show that the percentages of FND-labelled LSCs nested in the terminal bronchioles and alveoli of the lung-injured mice are 59 \u00b1 5% and 41 \u00b1 5%, respectively, compared with 24 \u00b1 3% and 76 \u00b1 3% for the uninjured mice (Fig. 5c). The marked difference in the histomorphometric distributions of the FND-labelled LSC population between these two animal models serves as additional evidence that the transplanted LSCs preferentially engraft to the terminal bronchioles of the mice after lung injury. Although the mechanisms by which the injected LSCs reach lung tissues and further engraft to the terminal bronchioles are still not yet fully understood38, our findings support the contention that specific microenvironments (or niches) in lungs play important roles in the regulation of tissue-specific engraftment, structural support and the signals for self-renewal and differentiation of the stem cells41,42.",

Moreover, the FND labelling does not eliminate the cells\u2019 in vitro differentiation and in vivo migration. Using the combined techniques, we have been able to follow the fate of FND-labelled LSCs in vivo after transplantation, precisely locate their position in tissue with single-cell resolution, and quantify their engraftment capacity over a week for the first time. The platform is particularly suitable for the study of rare stem cells that are difficult to transfect to express fluorescent proteins or non-fluorescent compounds.
