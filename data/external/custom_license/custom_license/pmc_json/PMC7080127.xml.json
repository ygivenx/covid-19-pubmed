            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new form of atypical pneumonia, and is an infectious disease which has caused a pandemic with significant public health concerns. Singapore was one of the earliest areas to be affected, with the index case admitted to a local hospital on 1 March 2003 [1]. Since then, there have been more than 7700 cases worldwide and 205 cases in Singapore, both as of 16 May 2003 [2]. One of the factors which contributes to the large number of cases is that the disease is easily transmissible via droplet infection from close contact. This situation is seen in the household setting, where family members are at risk of contracting the disease from an infected person. The number of children infected appears to be relatively small. We report a cluster of four children affected with SARS in this way, with emphasis on the contact history and radiological features.",

She presented initially with severe headache followed by a high fever and cough. She then rapidly deteriorated, collapsed suddenly, and passed away at home within 3 days of falling ill. She had been healthy prior to this episode of illness and had no past medical history of note. The postmortem examination performed did not find a cause for her sudden demise, but no investigations for SARS were done at the time in view of the lack of travel history and the apparent lack of contact history. This was later done and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for coronavirus was positive. The link in the contact history only emerged later, when it was discovered that the grandfather of the children worked in a local wholesale vegetable market where there had been a recent community outbreak of SARS. He subsequently also passed away from a SARS-related cause.",

Each patient showed either one or two areas of air-space shadowing, which were zonal in distribution. The typical appearance and pattern of progression is illustrated with patient B. The radiograph at presentation showed a single rounded area of ill-defined air-space consolidation in the lateral aspect of the left lower zone (Fig. 1a). The size and appearance of the consolidation was essentially unchanged on the second radiograph 2 days later, and partial resolution was seen on the third radiograph taken 4 days after the first (Fig. 1b). The last radiograph on the day of discharge showed almost complete resolution (Fig. 1c). In all four patients, no other areas of consolidation developed apart from that already present in the initial radiograph. No pleural effusions or pneumothoraces were noted throughout the course of the disease. Bilateral involvement was seen in patient A (Fig. 2), and unilateral multifocal consolidation in patient C (Fig. 3). Patient D had a single area of consolidation in the left upper zone (Fig. 4). The distribution of the radiographic abnormalities is detailed in Table 1. All four children showed significant resolution of the radiographic appearances by 4\u20136 days after the initial radiograph, similar to that demonstrated in patient B.\n\n\n\n\n",

However, these PCR tests need to be further validated, as there appears to be poor sensitivity with high false-negative results. Also, when community outbreaks occur, a contact source may not always be found immediately. As such, a high index of suspicion is needed in the assessment and evaluation of SARS patients. Stringent infection control measures have been implemented in Singapore, with isolation procedures, quarantine enforcement and notification of cases being the mainstays of prevention [5].",
