Proteins can be attached to GEM particles, lactococcal-derived bacterial-shaped particles by PA [22]. These GEM particles are non-living and non-genetically modified spherical particles composed of the cell wall. The GEM particles, which are deprived of intact surface proteins and intracellular content [2], are characterized by improved activity, stability and preservation. Another advantage is that GEM particles reduce the risk of dispersion of recombinant DNA into the environment [15]. One previously reported protein anchor for surface display is the lysin motif (LysM). LysM has been discovered in various proteins, such as bacterial lysins, bacteriophage proteins and certain proteins of eukaryotes [3]. The LysM used in this study originates from the C-terminal peptidoglycan-binding domain of AcmA, an autolysin from Lactococcus lactis, and it binds with high affinity to GEM particles in a non-covalent manner [22]. This novel surface display system offers the possibility to scale-up the virus purification process.",

However, there are limited data available regarding the binding activities of GRFT to viruses in the veterinary field. Besides, GRFT shows superior stability, remaining functionally stable at 80 \u2103 [5], and when exposed to repeated lyophilization [25], organic solvents and proteases [24]. Researchers have confirmed that GRFT has an outstanding safety profile with little toxicity or deleterious immunological consequences [10, 11], which provides further evidence in support of the clinical application of GRFT.",

The purification of viruses has become increasingly important for vaccine development and improved methods of purification are, therefore, highly desired. For this reason, we sought to develop an approach for PRRSV purification. We found that PRRSV could be properly and efficiently attached to the surface of GEM particles. The purification process employed was easy to perform, cost efficient and scalable and may, therefore, be superior compared with other previously established preparative purification methods [1, 8].

First, researchers revealed that subtilisin QK-2 (QK) was successfully separated using GEM surface display technology. In detail, QK-LysM, as a fusion protein, was loaded onto GEM particles by the LysM domain [18]. In other studies, a similar strategy was used to successfully attach various viral antigens, including porcine circovirus type two cap protein [15] and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus N protein [7], to GEM particles. In our research, we focused on PRRSV purification using surface display technology. More specifically, a fusion protein PA-GRFT with two functions, namely GEM binding activity and PRRSV binding activity, was designed. The fusion protein was attached to the surface of GEM particles by means of the PA domain and then PRRSV particles were adsorbed onto the surface of GEM particles by means of the lectin domain, separating them from the cell culture.",

            "text": "Here, it should be noted that the fusion protein PA-GRFT is the key to achieving PRRSV purification. Our data showed that PA-GRFT with sufficient stability was efficiently produced using the E. coli system and the resulting expression levels were around 6.6 times higher than those previously reported [6]. PA-GRFT was also proven to bind GEM particles and the PA-GRFT obtained in our study was highly specific to GEM particles. Furthermore, our data showed that 1 U of GEM particles could be saturated with 120 \u03bcg of fusion protein via the PA domain, which is in close agreement with previous reports [2]. In addition, the binding between the fusion protein and GEM particles was complete within a short time period, effectively shortening the duration of the purification process. We also assessed the ability of PA-GRFT to bind glycans using a method from a previous study in which researchers evaluated the glycan-binding activity of another lectin wheat germ agglutinin using OVA [29]. Our research confirmed that PA-GRFT could bind to glycans with high affinity and specificity, indicating that PA-GRFT most probably bound to the glycans tethered to the viral envelope glycoproteins.",

PRRSV is, therefore, a candidate for GRFT binding as it is an example of an enveloped virus that expresses surface glycoproteins. GP5 present on the viral envelope contains two or three putative N-glycosylation sites and can, therefore, be heavily glycosylated. Moreover, other glycoproteins including GP2a, GP3 and GP4 are incorporated as multimeric complexes in the viral envelope. Taken together, these facts suggest that the viral glycans are broadly distributed across the whole virion surface, reaching outwards like antennae [14]. Therefore, GRFT would be expected to bind to PRRSV, which provided the basis for the purification process employed in our study.",

            "text": "Given the proposed specific interaction between PRRSV and GRFT, PA-GRFT was used to capture PRRSV by employing a GEM-surface display platform. The purification assay showed that the PRRS virions could be successfully enriched and displayed on GEM particles. Our purification method was highly effective and removed the vast majority of impurities including the serum albumin precursor, which was reported to be the main impurity in a previous study [19]. A variety of methods of virus purification for PRRSV have been reported previously. The traditional method involves density gradient ultracentrifugation [20, 32]; however, this method is difficult to scale-up and cannot meet the demand for vaccine production. Ultrafiltration and chromatography techniques were also investigated for the purification of PRRSV [1, 8]. Hu and colleagues [8] reported that heparin affinity chromatography could be used to capture PRRSV. Although chromatography combined with ultrafiltration removed most cellular and media-related proteins, the cost associated with this method restricted its practical application. In the current study, we report that purified PRRSV can be obtained by a one-step centrifugation procedure without the need for any additional purification steps. Thus our method was easy to scale-up, enabling high throughput, and provided high purity and an appropriate recovery rate. By contrast with the currently available methods, PRRSV purification by GEM surface display technology also had the advantage of low cost. Our approach for the separation of PRRSV from cell culture onto GEM particles may, therefore, be a promising strategy for application in the large-scale purification of viruses for vaccine production.",
