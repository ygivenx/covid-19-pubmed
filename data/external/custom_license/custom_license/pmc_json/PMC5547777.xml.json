Viral infection was defined as the molecular detection of the virus concurrent with symptoms of a respiratory illness. Any symptoms separated from the illness episode by at least 7 symptom-free days were considered part of a separate illness episode. This analysis does not include influenza, however, because it is analyzed separately as part of the clinical trial of maternal immunization (20).",

Infants who are born SGA are at increased risk for poor growth and early death, particularly in developing countries. Reasons for SGA births include maternal malnutrition, use of drugs or alcohol during pregnancy, intrauterine infection, maternal anemia, or hypertension during pregnancy (38). Rates of hypertension, maternal smoking, and alcohol use are low in this cohort, and we found no difference in body mass index between pregnant women with and without SGA births. It is possible that a systemic inflammatory response due to HMPV febrile respiratory illness may be associated with increased risk of SGA, although it is not clear why this would be due to HMPV alone rather than febrile respiratory illness in general. No difference was noted in LBW or PTB between infants born to women with and without HMPV during pregnancy. Overall, the observed incidences of LBW and PTB in this cohort were slightly lower than previous estimates in the region, reflecting an overall improvement in health in the population. Among all women enrolled, 25% gave birth to an LBW infant, compared with 30.4% in previous studies; 13% gave birth preterm, compared with 18.3% in previous studies (15,39). In the parent trial of maternal influenza immunization, influenza vaccination during pregnancy was effective in prevention of influenza infection in infants and was also associated with increased birthweight (20). This finding suggests that prevention of potential respiratory illness during pregnancy may decrease the risk of adverse birth outcomes.",

We observed most outcomes at rates at 10%\u201350%, but with only 25 women having HMPV during pregnancy, we had the power only to detect risk ratios of 1.6 to 3.5. A further limitation was the collection of swabs only in cases of febrile respiratory illness; asymptomatic or afebrile infections would not have been captured. Because previous studies have found that adults with HMPV are often afebrile, with fever reported among 0\u201355% of adults, we likely underestimated the true incidence of HMPV (6,11,32,34,40). Preceding respiratory viral infections may increase risk for secondary bacterial infections, such as pneumococcus and staphylococcus. Unfortunately, in this study we did not test for bacterial infections and thus cannot assess whether these had an effect on clinical outcomes. The study was confined to a single rural district, which may have limited the variation in risk factors, such as caste and education. However, this region of Nepal (in the plains along the border with Bihar, India) is broadly representative of South Asia, a region with a population density and birth rate among the highest in the world. Few studies of HMPV have been conducted in these types of settings, particularly among pregnant women, which is notable because the presentation and clinical outcomes of disease may differ in regions of the world with high rates of household density, malnutrition, and indoor air pollution.",

These data may help providers to make decisions about therapeutic care, particularly as more inexpensive viral diagnostic tests become available. Finally, as attempts to develop a vaccine or antiviral therapy for HMPV are currently under way, the identification of risk factors for infection and for severe disease is crucial to identify groups that would benefit most from these advances, and to help develop focused prevention strategies.",
