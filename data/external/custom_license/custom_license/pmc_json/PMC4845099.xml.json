The two corresponding\nloops of human ubiquitin-specific protease 14 (USP14) have been proven\nto be crucial in blocking accessibility to the active site.31 Indeed, two SARS-PLpro complex crystal structures,\nwith lead inhibitors from each scaffold (I-2 or I-3) revealed that inhibitors bind not to the catalytic site\nof the PLpro enzyme but to the BL2 loop, blocking the entrance of\nthe active site. This appears to prevent substrate access to the catalytic\nsite, inhibiting PLpro enzyme activity. The amide group of inhibitor I-2 forms two hydrogen bonds with D165 and Q270 (Figure 2B). The amide group of inhibitor I-3 also forms a hydrogen bond with Q270 in the BL2 loop (Figure 2C). The aromatic ring of Y269 forms a hydrophobic\ninteraction with the naphthyl ring of both I-2 and I-3. Therefore, residues Q270 and Y269 form common key interactions\nin both scaffold 1 and 2 lead inhibitors of SARS-CoV PLpro. However,\nneither Q270 nor Y269 residues exist in MERS-PLpro (Figure 2D). In MERS-PLpro, A275 exists in place of Q270\nof SARS-PLpro, eliminating potential hydrogen bonding with inhibitors.\nAdditionally, the second key interaction is also impossible because\nT274 of the MERS-PLpro does not have the aromatic ring of Y269. Apparently\ndue to the lack of these two key residues, none of the SARS-PLpro\nlead inhibitors had any inhibitory efficacy against MERS-PLpro.",

The residues compared include\nthe active site, catalytic triad, and BL2 loop residues (Figure 3E). All eight structures aligned well with each\nother, except for several distinct locations, including the zinc-binding\nmotif and BL2 regions. The zinc atoms were shifted similar distances\nand locations in all five SARS-PLpro complex structures as compared\nto the apo structure, as noted with a red arrow pointed to the right\nin the bottom insert in Figure 3A. The equivalent\nzinc atom in MERS-PLpro was located in a different position and was\nshifted in a different direction from those in SARS-PLpro (dark brown\narrow in Figure 3A). Residues involved in the\nSARS-PLpro inhibitor binding are shown in Figure 3B, along with inhibitor I-3, in order to illustrate\nthe orientation of the inhibitor, inhibitor-interacting SARS-PLpro\nresidues, and the flexible BL2 loop. Figure 3C and D show the binding locations of inhibitors and ubiquitin substrates\nand the flexible BL2 loop in exactly the same orientation. The SARS-PLpro\nflexible BL2 loop blocks the entrance of the tunnel to the active\nsite when it is unbound and becomes well-ordered upon binding of either\nan inhibitor or a substrate (Figure 3C and\nD) through conformational changes.21,26\u221228,32,33 For MERS-PLpro, the flexible BL2 loop is positioned much further\nfrom its active site than that of SARS-PLpro when it is unbound. Upon\nsubstrate binding to MERS-PLpro, its BL2 loop moves to an orientation\nsimilar to that of the substrate bound SARS-PLpro loop, as noted with\nred and dark brown arrows in Figure 3D.30 Both BL1 and BL2 loops of USP14 appear to play\na regulatory role in its deubiquitinating activity,31 while mainly BL2 seems to serve this role in SARS-PLpro.\nThe question of whether the BL2 loop of MERS-PLpro plays a regulatory\nrole in its deubiquitinating activity remains to be answered.",

Mechanism of inhibition\nstudies revealed that these compounds are mixed-type inhibitors with\n\u03b1 values greater than 1, indicating that they bind to an allosteric\nsite other than its catalytic site but behave as if they are competitive\ninhibitors.35 As noted above, these lead\ninhibitors bind to the flexible BL2 region and induce conformational\nchanges to block substrate access to the catalytic site of the enzyme.26,28 There have been no MERS-PLpro inhibitors published to date; we have\nidentified one compound (4) that inhibits both SARS-PLpro\nand MERS-PLpro. Our mode of inhibition studies with compound 4 were done with a series of increasing substrate concentrations\nand enzyme-compound complexes (Figure 5A and\nB). The kinetic data were fit to four different enzyme inhibition\nmodels (competitive, noncompetitive, uncompetitive, and mixed-type)\nusing the Sigmaplot Enzyme Kinetics Module. The best fit equation\nwas selected based on Akaike Information Criterion-corrected (AICc)\nvalues.36 The equation with the lowest\nAICc value corresponds to the best fit, and a minimum of a two AICc\nunit difference from the next lowest is required to be considered\nstatistically significant. Interestingly, compound 4 exhibited\nmixed-type inhibition for SARS-PLpro but competitive inhibition for\nMERS-PLpro for the same substrate. The second best fit equation of\ncompound 4 with SARS-PLpro was noncompetitive inhibition\nwith 7.1 AICc values lower than the best fit (mixed-type) inhibition,\nwhich was also 38.6 AICc values lower than competitive inhibition,\nclearly indicating that compound 4 is an allosteric inhibitor\nof SARS-PLpro. For MERS-PLpro, the AICc value of competitive inhibition\nwas 19.4 units lower than the next lowest, noncompetitive inhibition.\nBecause of the large AICc value differences from the next best fit\nequations for both SARS and MERS-PLpro, it is clear that the same\ncompound acts as an allosteric inhibitor for SARS-PLpro and acts as\na competitive inhibitor for MERS-PLpro. Therefore, this compound inhibits\nthe two PLpro enzymes via two different inhibitory mechanisms even\nthough the inhibitory activities are similar, with IC50 values of 10.9 \u03bcM (SARS-PLpro) and 6.2 \u03bcM (MERS-PLpro).\nThe Ki values of compound 4 against SARS-PLpro and MERS-PLpro are 11.5 \u03bcM and\n7.6 \u03bcM, respectively (Figure 5C).",

However, we were uncertain where 4 might bind to SARS-PLpro since it is an allosteric inhibitor.\nOur first hypothesis was that it may bind to the BL2 loop where two\nother SARS-PLpro lead inhibitors (I-2 and I-3) bound. We thus evaluated inhibition by 4 in the presence\nof each of the four SARS-PLpro lead inhibitors (I-1\u2013I-4) in order to see if it has an additive effect (Figure 5D). If 4 binds to the same location\nas I-2 and I-3, their inhibitory activities\n(IC50 values) would not be improved by the addition of\ncompound 4. But their IC50 values should be\nenhanced if compound 4 binds elsewhere. Inhibitory activities\nof the four lead inhibitors alone varied from 0.23 \u03bcM to 2.26\n\u03bcM, and their IC50 values were enhanced up to almost\n7-fold (0.034\u20130.67 \u03bcM) in the presence of 4 at a concentration of 10 \u03bcM, slightly lower than its IC50 value. This led us to conclude that 4 binds\nto an allosteric site of the SARS-PLpro other than the BL2 loop. In\naddition to enzymatic mode of inhibition analysis, competition SPR\nstudies of compound 4 with SARS-PLpro and MERS-PLpro\nwere each performed in the presence and in the absence of the substrate.\nBinding affinity of compound 4 to SARS-PLpro was the\nsame regardless of substrate presence, whereas that of compound 4 to MERS-PLpro was 4.5-fold weaker in the presence of the\nsubstrate than 4 alone. These results indicate that the\nsubstrate is competing with 4 for the same binding site\nin MERS-PLpro (Figure 5E). Therefore, both\nthe enzymatic mechanism of inhibition and SPR studies support compound 4 being an allosteric inhibitor for SARS-PLpro, while 4 is a competitive inhibitor for MERS-PLpro. In order to further\nclarify this, cocrystallizations of both SARS-PLpro and MERS-PLpro\nwith compound 4 are currently in process.",

            "text": "The\ncysteine/serine protease mechanism involves tetrahedral intermediate\nformation, following nucleophilic attack by the cysteine/serine side\nchain. Generally, there is an oxyanion close to the catalytic site,\nwhich interacts with a negatively charged tetrahedral intermediate\nto stabilize it. Ratia et al. demonstrated that the SARS-PLpro W107\nlocated below the catalytic cysteine plays this vital role in forming\na hydrogen bond (H-bond) with an intermediate as an H-bond donor in\nthe active site by showing that the SARS-PLpro W107A mutant completely\nlost catalytic activity.21 However, in\nthe MERS-PLpro active site, the equivalent position is occupied by\nL106, which is not capable of being an H-bond donor (Figure 7A). Lei et al. recently demonstrated that the L106W\nmutation resulted in catalytic activity enhancement of MERS-PLpro,29 indicating that the MERS-PLpro oxyanion hole\nmay not be complete in comparison to that of SARS-PLpro. Interestingly,\nthe leucine residue at this position is highly conserved in three\nbat coronaviruses (BtCoV-HKU4, BtCoV-HKU5, and BtCoV-133) that belong\nto the same lineage group C as MERS-CoV (Figure 7B). On the other hand, two human coronavirus (NL63 and 229E) PLpro\nenzymes have a residue (Q or T) that can be an H-bond donor similar\nto SARS-PLpro. Therefore, another residue must play this intermediate-stabilizing\nfunction in MERS-PLpro. Asparagine (N110) in SARS-PLpro is highly\nconserved among various coronavirus PLpro enzymes, and Ratia et al.\nsuggested that this residue could be another residue contributing\nto the oxyanion hole stabilization in addition to W107.21 From the structural alignment of the active\nsite, we noted that the N109 of MERS-PLpro overlaps with N110 of SARS-PLpro.\nThis suggested that N109, located above the catalytic cysteine, might\nbe the residue that plays this critical role in MERS-PLpro. We hypothesized\ntwo potential mechanisms: First, the side chain amine group of N109\ncould form an H-bond with the intermediate\u2019s oxyanion as an\nH-bond donor (Figure 7C). Alternatively, the\ncarbonyl group of N109 could bind to a water molecule, followed by\nthe water forming another H-bond with the negatively charged intermediate\n(Figure 7D). The positions of N109 in these\ntwo scenarios could differ. We generated two MERS-PLpro mutants, N109A\nand N109D, to investigate these two hypotheses. Enzyme activity of\nthe N109A mutant was completely abolished, while the N109D mutant\nexhibited only \u223c13.8% of the wild-type MERS-PLpro activity\n(Figure 7E). This indicates that the N109 residue\nis indeed crucial for stabilizing the intermediate for the enzyme\nto perform its catalytic function. If N109 stabilized the intermediate\nvia the second hypothesis, the side chain of N109D could still form\nan H-bond with a water molecule through the carbonyl group of aspartic\nacid, rescuing the MERS-PLpro enzyme activity. However, the N109D\nmutant also showed very low enzyme activity as compared to the wild-type,\nsuggesting that the second hypothesis is not likely to be the main\nstabilization mechanism. This result suggests that N109 is a critical\nresidue for intermediate stabilization, most likely through an H-bond\nformation with the side chain amine group of N109.",

The overall MERS-PLpro structure is similar\nto that of SARS-PLpro including the N-terminal Ubl-domain. However,\nthe flexible BL2 loop of MERS-PLpro differs significantly from that\nof SARS-PLpro, which raised the possibility of differing roles in\ninhibitor binding.
