Newly described members include human gyrovirus (HGyV), avian gyrovirus 2 (AGV2), GyV3, GyV4, GyV5 and GyV6 [1\u20135]. It is of interest that some of these new gyrovirus types have been identified in human skin (HGyV), blood (HGyV) and stool (all gyroviruses) specimens, although an etiologic role of these viruses in human disease has not been demonstrated [1\u20137]. Furthermore, in addition to CAV, AGV2, HGyV and GyV4 have also been detected in chicken serum, meat and skin [1\u20133].",

In brief, the genomic RNA was extracted using a Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.

Adaptor ligation was performed using reagents from the same kit, whereas barcoded adaptors were retrieved from the Ion XpressTM Barcode Adapters (Life Technologies). The barcoded library DNA samples were column extracted using a Gel/PCR DNA Fragments Extraction Kit (Geneaid) and then run on a 2 % precast gel (Life Technologies). Products between 300 and 350 bp were used directly without further purification in the PCR mixture of the NEBNextR Fast DNA Fragmentation & Library Prep Set for Ion TorrentTM kit (NEB). Library DNA was subsequently amplified (initial denaturation at 98 \u00b0C for 30 s, followed by 12 amplification cycles of 98 \u00b0C for 10 s, 58 \u00b0C for 30 s and 72 \u00b0C for 30 s, and termination at 72 \u00b0C for 5 min). The amplified library DNA was purified using a Gel/PCR DNA Fragments Extraction Kit (Geneaid) and was quantified fluorimetrically on a Qubit\u00ae 2.0 fluorometer using the Qubit\u00ae dsDNA BR Assay Kit (Life Technologies). Approximately equimolar aliquots of the individually barcoded products were mixed in a single tube, and this library mixture was used in subsequent emulsion PCR according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol using an Ion PGM Template Kit on an OneTouch v2 instrument. Enrichment of the templated beads (on an Ion One Touch ES machine) and further steps of pre-sequencing set-up were performed according to the 200 bp sequencing protocol of the manufacturer (Life Technologies). The sequencing protocol recommended for the Ion PGMTM Sequencing Kit on a 316 chip was strictly followed. Raw sequence data were mapped onto reference sequences from the GenBank database using CLC Bio software (http://www.clcbio.com/). Sequence alignments and distance matrixes using the p-distance algorithm were prepared in MEGA 6 using the MUSCLE program [9].",

Although detection of chicken-origin gyroviruses (such as CAV and AGV2) in the fecal specimens was not surprising, the identification of putative human gyroviruses in the ferret fecal virome was somewhat unexpected; therefore, we systematically screened by PCR all available ferret stool samples for different gyroviruses, including those that were previously found exclusively in humans, in chickens, or both.\n",

When the results of targeted PCR and metagenomic analysis were merged, the stool samples of 14 animals were found to contain traces of gyrovirus genomic DNA. The main type was HGyV (identified in 13 of 14 animals). Eleven animals shed a mixture of gyroviruses; CAV was a commonly seen strain in specimens containing multiple gyroviruses (11/11), whereas GyV3 was amplified by PCR from two, and GyV4 and AGV2 from one ferret each. Interestingly, genomic DNA of another GyV3 and three GyV4 strains was identified by viral metagenomics in specimens that were negative by gene-specific PCR. Sequence variation in the primer-binding region provided a possible explanation for PCR failures in some instances and suggested limited sensitivity of published GyV3- and GyV4-specific PCR primers [3, 4].",

PCR assays with back-to-back primers were performed in a reaction volume of 20 \u00b5l containing 250 \u00b5M dNTP mix, 250 nM each primer, 1X Phusion Green HF Buffer and 0.3 U Phusion DNA polymerase (Thermo Scientific). Amplification conditions were as follows: denaturation at 98 \u00b0C for 30 s, 40 cycles of 98 \u00b0C for 10 s, 53 or 59 \u00b0C for 30 s (for GyV4 and HGyV/AGV2, respectively) and 72 \u00b0C for 90 s, and a final extension at 72 \u00b0C for 10 min. Sequencing of the amplified genomes was performed using the \u2018primer-walking\u2019 approach and Sanger sequencing using an ABI PRISM\u00ae 3100-Avant Genetic Analyzer and BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Life Technologies). Primers used for amplification and sequencing are presented in Table 2. The full-length genomes of five ferret-origin gyrovirus strains (three HGyV, one AGV2, one GyV4) were determined, and three representative genome sequences were deposited in the GenBank database (accession numbers: KJ452213 for AGV2 G17, KJ452214 for HGyV G13 and KJ452215 for GyV4 G14). Short fragments (~15-25 nucleotides in length) in the non-coding region could be sequenced only by a modified sequencing protocol due to the high GC content of the predicted hairpin structure just downstream the VP1, although back-to-back and other primers designed to amplify smaller products (559 bp for HGyV and AGV2 and 599 bp for Gyv4) spanning the putative hairpin structure worked well in our hands. Sequencing issues concerning these non-coding fragments even after cloning has been reported by other research groups [5]. In the present study, PCR assays and sequencing reactions in the presence of different concentrations of DMSO, betaine and Q-solution (QIAGEN) were tested, but early termination of the sequencing reaction was always observed (Fig. 1, panel A). A modified PCR using 7-deaza-dGTP (New England Biolabs) in a reaction volume of 20 \u00b5l contained 250 nM primers specific for the GC-rich region (Table 1), 25 \u00b5M dATP, dCTP, dTTP and 7-deaza-dGTP (New England Biolabs), 1X DreamTaq Green Buffer and 0.5 U DreamTaq DNA Polymerase (Thermo Scientific). The cycling profile was as follows: denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 3 min, 40 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 30 s, 54 \u00b0C for 30 s and 72 \u00b0C for 1 min, and a final extension step at 72 \u00b0C for 10 min. As in the previous attempts, these sequences were also terminated before reaching the GC-rich region or yielded ambiguous sequencing results (Fig. 1, panel B). High-quality sequences for the hairpin region were only obtained when 2.5-5 \u00b5M 7-deaza-dGTP was included in both the PCR and sequencing reaction mixtures (Fig. 1, panel C). As a result, alternating reiterations of homo-G-polymer and homo-C-polymer regions, 61 nt (HGyV/AGV2) and 42 nt (GyV4) in length, were revealed in the missing genomic region.\n\n",

Briefly, the short HGyV sequences (251-429 nt long) amplified using the diagnostic primers [3, 4] shared 100 % identity among themselves. A 392-nt-long stretch [3, 4] in two GyV3 strains shared 98 % nt sequence identity with each other and 99 % to the reference sequence (accession number: JQ308210). The only GyV4 sequence (239 nt long) amplified using diagnostic primers [3] showed 93.3 % and 94.6 % nt similarity to our G14 strain and the reference GyV4 strain, respectively. CAV strains showed 99-100 % similarity to each other and 100 % similarity to the reference strains found in GenBank. No traces of GyV5 and GyV6 were observed in the metagenomic analyses; thus, the study was not extended to the examination of these novel gyroviruses. Unfortunately, determination of whole genomic sequences of additional gyroviruses was not possible because of the small amount of stool samples and/or poor amplification results.",

Ferrets in the Hungarian shelter were feed regularly with chicken meat. This could be an explanation for why a well-known chicken pathogen, CAV, and a newly described member of the genus, AGV2, were detected in the feces of these animals. Similarly, food-associated acquisition and passive transfer through the gut could explain the detection of gyroviruses in the feces of humans and cats as reported in other studies [3\u20135, 10]. However, gyroviruses were also detected in human blood, and thus the possibility that certain gyroviruses are capable of infecting a mammalian host cannot be ruled out [6, 7].",
