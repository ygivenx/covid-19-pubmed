A SARS CoV Mpro protease cleavage site 44,45 was introduced in between the N-terminal 6xHis tag and \u03bc1(158\u2013423). The MHC-I CD-Nef fusion was created as described earlier 10. The fusion gene was cloned into the MCS2 of the pCDFDuet vector. The pCDFDuet plasmid encoding both \u03bc1(158\u2013423) and CD-Nef genes was expressed in Rosetta cells in Terrific Broth. Cells were induced with 0.1 mM isopropyl \u03b2-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at OD600 of 0.6 and grown at 16\u00b0C overnight. Proteins were first purified by Ni-NTA resin using the gravity-flow batch method. A subsequent purification step through a HiTrap Q anion exchange column produced the CD-Nef/\u03bc1 complex in good purity. The 6xHistag on \u03bc1 (158\u2013423) was then cleaved off using the SARS-CoV Mpro protease 44,45. A final gel filtration purification using a Sephadex 200 column yielded homogeneous monomeric CD-Nef/\u03bc1 complex. Selenomethionine-derivatized (Se-Met) proteins were expressed from the same vector using the methionine biosynthesis inhibition method 46. Purification of the Se-Met derivative of the protein complex was accomplished in the same way as described above for the native proteins.",

The phases were improved by a 2-fold NCS averaging using RESOLVE\n50. Two copies of both \u03bc1 (model PDB 1W63) 22 and Nef (model PDB 1EFN) 15 are located in the electron density map by the real space molecular replacement method using the CCP4 program Molrep\n51,52.

Iterative rounds of model building in COOT\n54 and refinement with Refmac5\n55 and PHENIX\n56 were performed. Strong NCS restraint was applied initially and released gradually at the final stages of refinement. The final model has an Rwork/Rfree of 0.208/0.258.

Nef is further affixed to \u03bc1 by extensive contacts at the core domain and by crucial electrostatic interactions involving its acidic cluster (62-EEEE-65). The C-terminus of Nef, together with a region of \u03bc1 disordered in the previous structure 22, forms a snug pocket at one end of the binding groove to cradle a tight turn of the MHC-I CD (residues 327\u2013332) (Fig. 1c). The two membrane anchoring points, the N-termini of the MHC-I CD and Nef, are located on the same side of the complex, consistent with their membrane attachment roles in vivo.",

The C-terminal domain of \u03bc1 (residues 158\u2013423) remains as a banana-shaped structure of mostly \u03b2-strands 22, with a slight twist (~10\u00b0) along its long axis upon complex formation (Supplementary Fig. 1). An unstructured region of \u03bc1 (residues 218\u2013231) becomes ordered to interact with both Nef and the MHC-I CD. The core domain of Nef has the same structure as seen previously, while the functionally important acidic cluster (62-EEEE-65) and the PxxP repeats (68\u201378) swing to a different trajectory to interact with \u03bc1 (Supplementary Fig. 1). The N-terminal helix of Nef is observed for the first time to be attached to the protein\u2019s core, on the side opposite the MHC-I binding site (Fig. 1). Much of the Nef N- and C-terminal loops (27\u201356 and 162\u2013174) are disordered and not seen in the structure. In addition, the connecting region of the MHC-I CD/Nef fusion protein, including the last nine residues of MHC-I, a two-residue linker (TS), and the first four residues of Nef, is also disordered. This flexible region of 15 residues can span up to 55 \u00c5 in distance, while its two ends observed in the structure are only 28 \u00c5 apart, suggesting that the fusion linker is unlikely to cause any distortion of the structure.",

The largest binary interface, 1058 \u00c52, occurs between Nef and \u03bc1 and falls into the category of weak, transient binding 24. The MHC-I/\u03bc1 and MHC-I/Nef interfaces bury 771 \u00c52 and 437 \u00c52, respectively, predicting that no binary complexes would form with MHC-I. In contrast, all three components together generate a total of 2266 \u00c52 buried area in a strong three-protein complex. This analysis also points to a possible sequence of the binding events. The association between Nef and AP1 may take place first as their buried surface area predicts the only likely binary binding event. The binding groove is then created at the Nef-\u03bc1 interface to sequester the MHC-I CD. Consistent with this scenario, we are able to show that the Nef-\u03bc1 binary complex can form at high protein concentrations (~30 \u03bcM) (Supplementary Fig. 2), although this interaction is not strong enough to be detected by in vitro pulldown 10. This is corroborated by the weak, binary interaction between Nef and \u03bc1 previously reported 6,25. Moreover, the binding of Nef to \u03bc1 is enhanced by the presence of the MHC-I CD 7,10, which further supports the cooperative nature of the three-protein interaction.",

The binding geometry closely resembles that of the Yxx\u03d5 peptide binding to \u03bc2 of AP2 (Fig. 2a) 14. However, the lack of a bulky hydrophobic side chain at the Y+3 position (Fig. 2b) in the MHC-I CD (320-YSQA-323) results in an empty hydrophobic pocket on \u03bc1 (Fig. 2c), which explains why MHC-I is not recognized by AP1 in the absence of Nef.

The last two PxxP repeats (72-PQVPLRP-78) form the major component of the sidewall of the MHC-I CD binding groove. This region of Nef likely plays a confinement role to prevent the MHC-I CD from diffusing away, as only weak van der Waals interactions occur between these two proteins along the groove, with all interatomic distances over 3.5 \u00c5. The Nef chain makes a 90-degree turn immediately upstream of the binding groove. This sharp turn is pivoted at the first PxxP repeat (69-PVTP-72) and is stabilized by stacking interactions with \u03bc1 (Fig. 2d). The turn changes Nef\u2019s binding trajectory on \u03bc1 and leads to an important electrostatic interaction involving the Nef 62-EEEE-65 residues (described below).",

These interactions shape one end of the binding groove and provide a second anchoring point at Asp327, in addition to Tyr320, for the MHC-I CD to latch into the groove. Mutation of either D327A in MHC-I or D123G in HIV-1 Nef abolishes the downregulation of MHC-I 9,26,29. However, unlike the previously proposed role of Asp123 in Nef dimerization 29, the crystal structure shows that this residue is essential because of the three-way electrostatic interaction.

This helix, as part of the flexible N-terminus of Nef, was previously predicted to be detached from the core 32. It is nonetheless important, as deletion of part of it, or mutation of Met20 within the helix, abolishes the Nef-mediated downregulation of MHC-I 9,20,26. Our structure shows instead that the helix is anchored via two hydrophobic residues, Trp13 and Met20, to the surface of the Nef core opposite the MHC-I binding site. Rather than directly participating in intermolecular binding, the N-terminal helix-core association is predicted to bring the Nef core close to the membrane, facilitating interaction with the MHC-I CD and the AP1 complex. Consistent with an important helix-core anchoring interaction, either W13A or M20A mutation in Nef abolished the downregulation of MHC-I in human T lymphocytes (Fig. 4b). Mutations of the two residues also inhibited complex formation in our in vitro pulldown assays (Fig. 4c). The identification of two adjacent mutations with the same phenotype supports the role of the anchoring interaction in Nef function.",

In the region corresponding to the Nef-induced \u03bc1 helix-turn structure, a much longer loop exists in \u03bc2, which is unlikely to adopt the same conformation (Supplementary Fig. 4). \u03bc2 also lacks the important Tyr residue (Tyr374 in \u03bc1) that stacks onto Nef Pro72 to stabilize the sharp Nef turn (Fig. 2 and 5). Furthermore, \u03bc2 does not have the essential basic patch that attracts the Nef acidic cluster to secure the complex formation. Indeed, the Nef-MHC-I CD construct does not interact with \u03bc2 in our in vitro pulldown experiments (Fig. 5c). These differences highlight an important distinction between the two otherwise highly homologous \u03bc subunits in AP1 and AP2, which may contribute to different interactions with distinct cellular sorting proteins and cargos. The lack of interaction between Nef and \u03bc2 also suggests an explanation for why Nef uses a distinct mode of interaction -its acidic dileucine motif and the \u03b1 and \u03c32 subunits of AP2- to downregulate CD4 33,34.",

A striking co-planar arrangement is revealed for the Nef N-terminal myristoylation site, the MHC-I CD membrane-proximal end, and multiple phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) binding sites on AP2 35, consistent with the formation of the complex along the lipid bilayer in vivo. The co-planar arrangement of all of the membrane attachment sites underlines the accuracy of this model. Through myristoylation and the anchoring of its N-terminal helix to the core, Nef is positioned at an optimal distance from the lipid membrane to bind the AP1 complex, an event that likely occurs after the recruitment of AP1 to the membrane by the small GTPase ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1) 36,37. The Nef-\u03bc1 interaction may also contribute to induce the active, open conformation of AP1, through electrostatic attractions resembling those involving the PIP2-containing membranes 35. This interaction likely further stabilizes the membrane-association of AP1, as we have reported before 38. The association of Nef and AP1 then creates a snug binding groove for the recruitment of the MHC-I CD and ultimately leads to packaging of MHC-I into the clathrin-coated vesicle.",

            "text": "Nef uses a wide range of structural features throughout its entire length to hijack the AP-1 complex and modulate the cell surface expression of MHC-I. Perhaps due to its highly cooperative nature, the interaction is very delicate: mutation of any of its key elements disrupts the complex and causes the loss of Nef activity. This provides a clear explanation for the observation that virtually every domain in Nef required for the modulation of MHC-I is also required for the co-immunoprecipitation of the two proteins from human cells 26. Moreover, our model explains why the dileucine motif in the C-terminus of native Nef is not active during the downregulation of MHC-I, yet it is functional as a trafficking signal when Nef is fused to the CD of MHC-I 39. Our structure shows the cooperative Nef/MHC-I CD/\u00b51 ternary interaction is key to the recruitment of MHC-I to AP1. This conformation, however, precludes the involvement of Nef's dileucine motif as the binding site for [ED]xxxL[LI] motifs on the \u03b3 and \u03c31 subunits of AP1 40 is too distant (Fig. 6). In contrast, when MHC-I is covalently linked to Nef, the critical MHC-I recruitment step is bypassed, and any trafficking signal in Nef, including the dileucine motif, can contribute to the trafficking of the MHC-I-Nef fusion protein. Nevertheless, the principle of cooperative binding likely also applies to the mechanism by which Nef modulates CD4 via clathrin-mediated endocytosis and AP2 41, even though that interaction involves the dileucine motif of Nef and the \u03b1 and \u03c32 subunits of AP2 rather than \u00b52.",

            "text": "Our structure supports the notion of Nef as a virally encoded clathrin associated sorting protein (CLASP), which alters the breadth and specificity of cargo recognition by AP complexes 12. The cooperative binding mechanism by which Nef enables an AP complex to recognize a suboptimal sorting sequence could be utilized by cellular CLASPs. For example, in murine MHC-I, the tyrosine residue corresponding to Tyr320 is required for the \"cross-presentation\" of exogenous antigens by dendritic cells, an event required for the priming of antiviral cytotoxic T lymphocytes 42. This observation, together with the role of Tyr320 in the Nef-mediated modulation of MHC-I via AP1, led us and others to speculate that cross-presentation might involve AP-1 and a cellular CLASP that is reminiscent of HIV-1 Nef 8,9. Moreover, the positively charged clusters on \u03bc1 that contribute to the interaction between Nef and the MHC-I CD may function as binding sites for the acidic trafficking motifs of cellular proteins. For example, the cytoplasmic domain of the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor contains acidic clusters that include glutamic acid, aspartic acid, and phospho-serine residues, and these sequences contribute to the interaction with AP1 43.",
