Analysis of the full-length genome sequence showed that this virus is closely related to bovine parvovirus and canine minute virus and is a member of the genus Bocavirus, subfamily Parvovirinae, family Parvoviridae. This virus has been provisionally named human Bocavirus (HBoV) (2). HBoV in respiratory samples from Australian children was also recently reported (3). Involvement of this new virus in respiratory tract diseases merits further investigation. We have therefore retrospectively tested for HBoV nasopharyngeal samples collected from children <5 years of age hospitalized with respiratory tract disease.",

Samples were also placed on MRC5 cell monolayers for virus isolation and tested for human metapneumovirus by reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Nucleic acids were extracted from samples, stored at \u201380\u00b0C, and tested for HBoV DNA by PCR with primers specific for the predicted NP1 gene as previously described (2). The expected product size was 354 bp. In each experiment, a negative control was included, and positive samples were confirmed by analyzing a second sample. Amplification specificity was verified by sequencing.",

Bronchiolitis was the major diagnosis. Dyspnea, respiratory distress, and cough were the most common respiratory symptoms observed. Four (44%) HBoV-infected children were born preterm, which suggests that these children have an increased susceptibility to HBoV-associated diseases.
