The intensity of the fluorescence (FAM and HEX) emitted from the hydrolyzed probes was measured every cycle. Based on the measured amplification curve, the results were expressed as the quantification cycle value (Cq value). The Cq values obtained from the diluted plasmids were found to be significantly correlated with the copy numbers of each plasmid, with an R2 value of 0.9847 and 0.9954 for pUC57-SARS-pS2 and pGEM-MERS-S2, respectively (Fig. 2). The negative control (distilled water) did not yield an amplification curve. As shown in Table 2, the detection limits of the real-time RT-PCR for pUC57-SARS-pS2 and pGEM-MERS-S2 were both 1 \u00d7 102 copies/mL in the single-template condition and were 5 \u00d7 101 and 5 \u00d7 100 copies/mL, respectively, in the mixed-template condition. The detection limits of the real-time RT-PCR for the in vitro-transcribed mRNA of pUC57-SARS-pS2 and viral RNA of MERS CoV (KOR/KNIH/002_05_2015) were 1 \u00d7 10\u22123 and 1 \u00d7 100 ng/mL, respectively, in the single-template condition and were 5 \u00d7 10\u22123 and 5 \u00d7 101 ng/mL, respectively, in the mixed-template condition (Table 2).\n\n",

In a previous study, two regions within the spike protein of SARS-CoV were identified that showed a high degree of sequence conservation with those of other CoVs [13].
