            "text": "Recently, the infectious diseases caused by airborne bacteria and viruses are of primary global concern for both social and economic reasons. For example, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused the deaths of nearly 700 people and affected almost 8000 during the first outbreak in 2002\u20132003; it eventually spread around 37 countries, causing a cost of $18 billion, primarily in Asia (S\u00f8rensen et al. 2006). Moreover, between 2009 and 2010, nearly 17,000 healthy adults died globally from influenza A (H1N1), and the seasonal influenza continues to kill many people annually (Tellier 2009; Chiu et al. 2017). Bioaerosols are airborne microorganisms that are either infectious or non-infectious in nature and that can easily spread to the environment via air in a short span of time (Ki Youn et al. 2010). With air as the transportation media, pathogenic bacteria, viruses, fungi, and biological fragments can instantly affect human health (Lee et al. 2008). Generally, these pathogenic bioaerosols enter and exit the respiratory system through breathing, coughing, laughing, sneezing, and personal contact (Shrivastava et al. 2013). Tuberculosis, whooping cough, meningitis, anthrax, and pneumonia are some of the most common examples of airborne bacterial diseases (Eickhoff 1996).",

Staphylococci are a common semi-pathogenic bacterial colonizer in the skin and mucous membranes of humans, and it can cause some minor skin diseases and a multitude of other diseases (Chessa et al. 2016; Lenart-Boron et al. 2017). Staphylococcus epidermidis belongs to the Gram-positive and coagulase-negative Staphylococci which are found in the human skin and mucous membrane (Otto 2009; Wieser and Busse 2000; Taylor et al. 2016); this is the major cause of nosocomial infections and is often the major infective agent in compromised patients, such as drug abusers, immuno-compromised patients, premature newborns, and the elderly (Cuong and Michael 2002; Okten and Asan 2012). The presence of infectious bioaerosols in indoor air is a major issue, and they should be controlled or removed to prevent contagious diseases (Aliabadi et al. 2011).",

            "text": "Generally, removal and disinfection are the two major techniques that have been adopted to control bioaerosols in the environment. In the removal method, an air purifier with filters (high-efficiency particulate air filter) is used to trap and eliminate infectious bioaerosols. In the disinfection method, disinfectants such as a light catalyzer, UV lamp, and chlorine are used to kill the airborne microorganisms (Pham and Lee 2015; Zacar\u00edas et al. 2012; Berry et al. 2007). The high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration technique is effectively used to reduce bioaerosols in laboratories and hospitals (Herrera-Cant\u00fa et al. 2017). The major mechanism of the high-efficiency air filter involves removing airborne microparticles from the indoor environment (Mittal et al. 2011). In addition, the indoor installation of an air purifier can significantly reduce airborne bacteria, molds, and mycobacteria. Wen et al. (2014) evaluated the filtration efficiency of a HEPA filter in a biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) laboratory using the aerosolized bacteria, Serratia marcescens, and reported the effective performance of the HEPA filter against these aerosolized bacteria. Moreover, Foarde (2010) used the single-pass method in a chamber filter to evaluate the collection efficiency of filters and the removal of non-biological particles.",

The peculiarity of this study is that it has a built-in HEPA filter installed in a single chamber to evaluate an air cleaner and it prevents contaminations from anything other than the airborne bacteria we use in our experiments. So, we evaluated the efficiency of an air purifier on the removal of the injected bacterial strain, S. epidermidis, in a single-test chamber. In this method, the air purifier was installed and tested in a manner similar to a customer\u2019s usage conditions. The microbial samples were collected from the chamber directly to the agar culture medium using the impaction sampling technique, and then the range of colony formation was analyzed. The natural decay rate, operational decay test, and particle distribution rate were analyzed, and the results were discussed in detail. Through these studies, the bacteria removal performance of the air cleaner was evaluated and it helps the consumers to check the performance in advance.",

The air purifier (HEPA filter) device capable of removing airborne particles was installed in the ceiling of the test chamber, and an air conditioning system was assembled to control the interior temperature and humidity (Fig. 1a). Moreover, a nebulizer (Devilbiss PulmoNeb, Compressor, Model 3655, USA) was set up to inject strains at a flow rate of 0.5 ml per minute. The mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) is 5 \u03bcm. In addition, the system contains a device to control the moisture and spraying pressure (48.2 PSI), as well as filters to supply clean air. Figure 1b shows a schematic diagram of the air inbuilt purifier used in the experiment. The inbuilt air purifier consists of a primary filter, an activated carbon filter (it helps to remove ozone and odor inside the test chamber), and a HEPA filter for more effective air purification. In the typical experiment, the air purifier was installed in three different ways, which were all similar to a customer\u2019s usage conditions. In the first one, a stand type was installed directly on the floor (Fig. 2a), while in the second one, a desktop type was installed at a height of 1.2 m from the floor (Fig. 2b) and a distance of 0.1 m from the wall. Finally, in the third one, wall-mounted or ceiling-embedded types were installed at 1.8 m from the floor of the experimental chamber (Fig. 2c).",

The following procedure was performed for the blank test: initially, air purifier (HEPA filter) device (Fig. 1b) in the chamber ceiling was operated for 1 h so as to remove the airborne bacteria and ozone (O(3)) inside the test chamber, where the temperature and humidity were regulated within 23 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C and RH 50 \u00b1 5% respectively. At this time, the UV lamps were turned on to sterilize the microbes which survived the purification of the HEPA filter. In this case, it is preferable to use activated carbon (AC) filters because a small amount of ozone may be generated. AC filters are used widely in air cleaning to remove ozone (Metts and Batterman 2006). Following this sterilization and removal of ozone, the HEPA filter device and UV lamp were turned off and the auxiliary fan inside the chamber was turned on. Subsequently, the test strand was injected at a rate of 1\u00d7105 CFU/ml (2 ml) using a nebulizer setup. Then, the auxiliary fan was turned off, and the chamber was left to stand for 1 h without any external disturbance. A microbial culture medium (petri dish) was attached on the air sampler inside the chamber and sampled for 1 min at a flow speed of 100 L/min, which was used as an initial value. Similarly, the chamber was left to stand for another 1 h and sampled for 5 min at a flow speed of 100 L/min, which was used as a final value. The initial and final values measured by this procedure were used as the blank test. After measuring the final value, the chamber was sterilized to remove the microbes by powering the UV lamp and operating the stirring plate.",

            "text": "Generally, the filters in an air purifier can trap airborne particles by means of size exclusion, in which the air is forced through the filter and the particles are physically captured. In this present investigation, the size distribution of the particles inside the airtight chamber (analyzed using a particle counter) was found to be in the range of 0.3 to 5.0 \u03bcm (Fig. 3). The results indicated that the distribution of larger-sized particles decreased over time, due to the performance of the air purifier (Table 1). Here, particles near the size of a microbe (1 \u03bcm) were also observed to decrease by ~ 10% after 1 h of the experiment. Moreover, the particle size distribution of the bacterial strain also showed a similar decreasing pattern. However, the rates of decrease were higher for the test bacteria than for airborne particles; this may be attributed to the adhesion of microbes with liquid droplets. Therefore, the reduction rate is larger than that of the normal particles, even when the size of the microbes equals 1 \u03bcm. This is because the weights of the microbes increase when combined with liquid droplets, and the particle size has been estimated to be \u2264 5 \u03bcm. Consistent with our data, the microbial size has been shown to range between 1 and \u2264 7.5 \u03bcm and increase with increasing temperature (Tham and Zuraimi 2005). By contrast, a previous investigation on the size distribution of airborne heterotrophic bacteria has revealed aerodynamic diameters between 1.1 and 2.1 \u03bcm in one fraction respirable particulate matter and another at the coarse fraction with a diameter above 7 \u03bcm (Raisi et al. 2012). In addition, the distribution of bacteria has been controlled and influenced by the nebulizer used for the generation of bioaerosols. According to Kujundzic et al. (2006), the aerodynamic size distribution of bacteria generated with the nebulizer can vary due to the generation of particles with both larger and smaller aerodynamic diameters (0.3\u20130.6 \u03bcm). But, due to various complexities like coalescence in determining aerosol particle lifetime in the atmosphere, there are very few experimental studies that have been performed to research interparticle interactions (Bzdek and Reid 2017). Moreover, the behavior of the particles mainly depends upon the physicochemical properties like agglomeration state, shape, crystal structure, chemical composition, surface area, surface chemistry, surface charge, and porosity (Oberd\u00f6rster et al. 2005).",

The results indicated that the maximum deviation was 3.1% with the allowed sample error of \u00b1 1.1% p at a 95% confidence level. It was observed that the bacteria decrease at a constant rate at constant intervals upon the injection of bacterial strain into the airtight chamber of constant space (Fig. 4a, b). Based on these observations, the results of the operational decay test showed the performance of the air purifier itself by correcting the natural decay rate. The efficiency of the air purifier on the removal of S. epidermidis was found to be similar to that reported by Wen et al. (2014), where S. marcescens was effectively filtered by a HEPA filter under the laboratory test unit. Before injecting the microbial samples into the chamber, the internal air in the chamber was cleaned and sterilized. The proliferation of bioaerosols was controlled when the air purifier (HEPA filter) device and UV filter were switched on before the natural decay test. The natural decay rate was observed to be in the range from 78.78 to 81.85% for 60 min. Here, UV is used to sterilize the air, and the particle flow through the HEPA filter comes into contact with the surfaces of the fibers by means of van der Waals forces and removed from the air stream (Taylor et al. 2016). In addition, the test unit (air purifier) was fixed in three different setups, specifically in stand, ceiling, and wall mount types, and they all showed similar removal efficiencies, which would help the product accommodate the lifestyle of the consumer.",

The raised and cohesive colonies were approximately 1 to 2 mm in size after incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 24 h (Fig. 5a, b), and Fig. 5c and d show the negative and positive controls, respectively. Prior to the air purifier operation, the nebulized bacteria were found to be high and similar to the positive control. Once the airborne microbes were captured by the filter, the rate of suspended bacteria becomes very low or even zero. Thus, the HEPA filters built into air purifiers are made of intertwined fibers, where the smallest particles or microbes become trapped in three ways: interception, impaction, or diffusion. The smallest airborne microbes were most likely trapped in the fibers by means of diffusion. Once the microbes enter into the filter, they will colloid with the gas molecules and embed into the fibers of the filter (Herrera-Cant\u00fa et al. 2017). Here, the microbes suffer from lack of nutrients, and the high humidity in this environment leads to low proliferation. In addition, while selecting the test organism, the few criteria were observed, because the test device was a household air purifier; the most important challenge was that the organisms needed to be representative of the bacteria typically found in human dwelling spaces.",

Programmed and periodic cleaning and sterilization activities of the chamber were performed as a pre-measure for the contaminations. The result suggests that the rate of decrease in microbes in a chamber with injected microbes after some fixed time was constant. The natural decrease rate had a correlation within the range of 1240\u201311,180 CFU of microbe density per 1 m3. By calibrating the operation value to the natural decay rate, the bacterial removal capability of the air purifier can be verified and the error of the resulting value can be minimized. Thus, this evaluation method for the air purifier device performance is considered to be promising for improving air filtration technology.",
