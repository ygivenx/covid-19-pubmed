The majority of studies have focused on specific viruses [4,5] or bacteria [6,7,8], with few assessing whether upper airway microbiology predicts clinical symptoms. There are none that have been conducted in a population with a similar pneumonia risk to that of Central Australian Indigenous children. Use of nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) is convenient, as obtaining lower airway specimens in very young children generally requires invasive procedures (e.g. bronchoscopy or lung punctures). However, NPS taken at hospitalisation may not reflect clinical symptoms or outcomes as nasopharyngeal (NP) carriage in this population is high (up to 90% of asymptomatic children) [9,10] and detection of organisms by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at a single point in time does not necessarily equate to active infection. Further, carriage of NP viruses is as high as 45% of asymptomatic hospitalised children [11].",

Forty per cent of the population is Aboriginal, most of who reside in remote communities.

In June 2001 (during study recruitment), the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) was introduced to the routine schedule, administered at 2, 4, and 6 months of age with a booster dose of the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine at 18 months of age. In our setting, children with clinically suspected pneumonia are treated in community clinics according to standard treatment protocols and retrieval to hospital occurs when oxygen is required or the child \u201cfails to respond to treatment\u201d.",

NPS were collected after enrollment and within 24 hours of admission to the paediatric ward.

Accessory muscle use (for assessment of chest in-drawing) and the child\u2019s respiratory rate were documented after observing the child for 60 seconds after oxygen had been turned off (if applicable). These assessments were undertaken by trained research nurses twice a day but, given the known variability in children\u2019s respiratory status, only the more severe (higher) rate was recorded on a daily basis.

The grouping of the viruses is controversial.

In other settings, there are many studies that have described the positive association between NP microbiology and ALRI symptoms [22] or pneumonia [8,23,24], but few have evaluated signs of WHO-defined clinical pneumonia to both viral and bacteria detection in the upper airways. Some studies assume that what is found in the upper airways is the aetiological cause of the pneumonia [23,24], and others advocated that microbiology (e.g. pneumococcus) identified on NPS can be used to diagnose aetiology of pneumonia [6]. However, we have previously shown that the yield of respiratory virus detection in NP aspirates versus broncho-alveolar lavage is dependent on virus type [25]. Indeed, delineating the aetiological agent of pneumonia is not straightforward when the direct lower airway specimens (e.g. sputum, lung biopsy) are unavailable and in the absence of a positive blood culture [26]. Complexities include the case definition, use of and interpretation of CXR, blood white cell counts and inflammatory markers, depth of investigations, facility type, and patient characteristics [26], as well as the limited specificity of the WHO diagnosis of pneumonia and CXRs [27]. None of the studies have examined recovery of these signs of clinical pneumonia and it is also likely that these studies have limited applicability in settings with a high infectious burden from a young age; e.g. in Indigenous Australian remote communities and very low-income countries. Our study thus contributes to the medical literature on childhood pneumonia, in spite of the limitations of our study as discussed below.",

Secondly, we did not have a control group to contemporaneously evaluate if NP carriage in children hospitalised with pneumonia was higher than those hospitalised for other reasons; however, our study\u2019s aim was to evaluate NP microbiology with symptoms and signs of pneumonia and not between groups of children with different diseases. Thirdly, the majority of children (73%) were from remote communities and their clinical presentation at time of admission to the ward would have been influenced by treatment (e.g. antipyretics, oxygen therapy, prior antibiotics) prior to retrieval to hospital. It is likely that more children would have had clinical signs suggestive of pneumonia when they presented to the remote community clinic. However, this scenario of prior treatment and delay prior to management in a major hospital is similar to some regions in developing countries where treatment is initiated in the local clinic and the child transferred to a major hospital if required. Nevertheless, studies conducted at the community level prior to transfer to hospital are needed in this high-risk group to adequately assess predictors of symptoms and signs.",
