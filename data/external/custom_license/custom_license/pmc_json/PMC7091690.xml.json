There are numerous examples of disease in research animal populations compromising the research results derived from the projects2. The presence of mouse hepatitis virus3, mouse parvovirus and minute virus of mice4, Helicobacter spp.5, Mycoplasma pulmonis and Sendai virus6 and mousepox7 have all confused research results. Routine monitoring of the prevalence of the various rat and mouse pathogens is useful to the research and laboratory animal community because it allows researchers to assess whether various diseases are increasing or decreasing in importance (in a particular animal population in a particular country). Mice and rats are susceptible to approximately 40 different viral, bacterial and parasitic diseases2. Many agents cause severe disease, often resulting in death, but other diseases may be subclinical, maintained in an animal colony for a long period of time or clinically silent, yet affect research results in subtle ways2. There is also a risk that infectious agents may contaminate animal products such as cell lines and antibodies. Health monitoring may be expensive, and the knowledge of which diseases are common or rare in a local setting is very useful so that frequency of testing and sample size can be adjusted accordingly.",

In addition, the rapid rise in the use of transgenic and knockout mice has resulted in greater numbers of immunocompromised animals in research facilities. Transgenic animals are often more susceptible to a greater number of infectious agents than are non-transgenic rodents and are also prone to certain rare diseases8. As populations of transgenic rodents grow, it becomes more difficult to eliminate many of these diseases9. For these reasons, it is important to monitor immunocompromised populations more frequently using different disease panels than those used for healthy rats and mice.",

The same report identified rat respiratory virus, rat parvoviruses, rat theilovirus (also known as TMEV), Helicobacter spp., P. pneumotropica and pinworms as common pathogens in rats from animal facilities in North America and Europe10. We wished to establish whether similar diseases exist in laboratory rats and mice in Australasia. Knowledge about the sensitivity and specificity of the tests used, as well as the predictive value of positive and negative test results, is useful to allow laboratory animal workers to assess the seriousness of the consequences of a positive result10. We retrospectively analyzed the serological, microbiological, parasitological and molecular diagnostic data from approximately 1,000 laboratory mice and rats submitted from academic, industrial and government institutions in Australia, New Zealand and Singapore to this laboratory (Cerberus Sciences, a rodent health monitoring company) each year from 2004 to 2009.",

Although live animals are tested regularly, few institutions test external animal products such as cell lines, serum and transplantable tumors1. The exchange of animals and biological products between animal institutes has been responsible for some disease outbreaks9.",

Mice were seropositive for mouse hepatitis virus, rotavirus, minute virus of mice, mouse adenovirus, reovirus and mouse cytomegalovirus, and the presence of Taenia taeniaformis, Syphacia oblevata and Vampirolepsis spp. was detected. These results were similar to those in another report, which additionally detected M. pulmonis, Sendai virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus and parvovirus in wild mice32. The seroprevalence of mouse cytomegalovirus is far greater in wild populations (61.7%)33 than in our study (0.02%). In a serological survey of virus infection among wild house mice (Mus domesticus) in the UK, mice were seropositive for mouse hepatitis virus, mouse cytomegalovirus, mouse thymic virus, mouse adenovirus, mouse parvovirus and minute virus of mice34. Testing of rodent-borne pathogens carried by wild-caught Norway rats in the US detected antibodies against rat coronavirus, M. pulmonis, cilia-associated respiratory bacillus, rat parvovirus, Kilham rat virus, Toolan's H-1 virus, Sendai virus and TMEV35. These reports suggest that many of the pathogens that remain problematic for laboratory rodents are also encountered in wild mice and rats.",
