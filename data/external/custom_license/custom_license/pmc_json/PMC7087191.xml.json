            "text": "Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) is a member of the genus Coronavirus, family Coronaviridae, that mainly causes vomiting and wasting disease (VWD) and/or encephalomyelitis in piglets under 3 weeks old [1, 2]. The disease was first reported in 1958, and the virus was first isolated from the piglets in 1962 [3, 4]. Since then, PHEV infection has been widespread worldwide, including Europe, Asia, and North America, where the overall mortality rate in piglets ranges from 30% to 100% [5\u20138]. Recently, an acute outbreak of influenza-like illness (ILI) in adult pigs in the USA was reported, and testing identified PHEV as the cause of the disease [9]. The ILI that was observed may reflect an atypical form of illness or a variant of PHEV with increased virulence. PHEV is a neurovirulent virus that spreads to the central nervous system (CNS) via peripheral nerves, where neurite damage and neuronal death are observed, causing neurological symptoms. Since pigs are the natural hosts of PHEV, the virus has to adapt to replicate in rats and mice (i.e., ICR, BALB/c and Wistar) in vivo, and rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells in vitro [8, 10, 11]. The mechanism by which neuronal degeneration is induced by PHEV infection is not well understood, and the study of virus-host interactions is therefore important.",

Several studies have shown that aberrant expression of miRNAs is closely associated with proliferation, invasion, metastasis and the prognosis of various coronavirus infections [13\u201315]. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection upregulates miR-17*, mir-574-5p, and miR-214 and inhibits the expression of miR-98 and miR-223. miR-17* and mir-574-5p have been shown to restrict the replication of SARS-CoV, whereas miR-214 contributes to immune escape [15]. miRNAs are processed from hairpin transcripts, and this maturation step gives rise to a 3p and a 5p strand, both of which allow the silencing of specific target genes through base pairing to a minimal recognition sequence [16]. The miR-142(a) hairpin gives rise to a \u201cguide strand\u201d, miR-142(a)-3p, and a sister \u201cpassenger strand\u201d, miR-142(a)-5p [12]. miR-142a-3p has been sown to play a critical role in virus infection, inflammation, and immune tolerance. Trobaugh et al. showed that North American eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) hijacks host miR-142-3p to limit viral replication in particular cell lines [17]. miR-142a-3p also modulates neutrophil development by controlling its maturation in zebrafish [18]. Using miRNA array, miR-142a-3p expression has been shown to be upregulated during PHEV infection [19]. However, it remains to be investigated whether miR-142a-3p controls virus proliferation or translation of mRNAs that are associated with neurological dysfunction.",

Among the candidate target genes, Rab3a contains a conserved mRNA 3\u2032UTR sequence element that is predicted to be complementary to the seed region of mouse miR-142a-3p. The Rab3a mRNA 3\u2032UTR sequence was amplified from mouse brain by RT-PCR, and the mutation in the miR-142a-3p binding site was amplified using overlap PCR. The PCR-amplified wild-type Rab3a mRNA 3\u2032UTR (Rab3a-WT) and the mutated Rab3a mRNA 3\u2032UTR (Rab3a-MUT) were then cloned into the firefly luciferase pmirGLO reporter (Promega, Madison, USA) using the NheI and XhoI sites. The Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison, USA), with firefly luciferase (luc2) as the primary reporter was used to monitor the interaction of miR-142a-3p and Rab3a mRNA 3\u2032UTR. Renilla luciferase (hRluc-neo) was used as a control reporter for normalization and selection. HEK293T cells were co-transfected with Rab3a-WT/Rab3a-MUT, miRNA mimic/inhibitor/NC, and the Renilla luciferase construct, and the luciferase activity in these cell lysates was measured at 24 h post-transfection.",

To identify potential target mRNAs for miR-142a-3p, bioinformatics software, including Targetscan Mouse, MicroCosm Targets, and Miranda, were used. We focused on a set of seven genes (Ptpn23, Rab3a, Rab12, Tmem55b, Stx12, Fyco1, and Rab14) that were shown previously to be downregulated genes in the CNS using an mRNA array [19]. Of these, Rab3a is of particular interest. It is a small RAB GTPase that plays a role in neurotransmitter release and contains conserved 3\u2019UTR sequence elements that are partially complementary to miR-142a-3p [21]. In consideration of its strong association with virus infection and nerve injury, we selected Rab3a for further verification. To confirm the regulation of Rab3a expression in response to PHEV infection, the infected cell lysates were made at 24, 36, and 48 hpi, and mouse brain tissues were harvested at 3 and 5 dpi. Using qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis, we observed an apparent downregulation of Rab3a mRNA and protein expression in N2a cells during PHEV infection in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2a and c). Similar effects were also detected in PHEV-infected BALB/c mice (Fig. 2b and d). The findings suggest that PHEV negatively regulates expression of endogenous Rab3a.",

A dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed at 24 h after co-transfection of HEK293T cells with miR-142a-3p mimic/inhibitor, Rab3a-WT/Rab3a-MUT luciferase reporter, and Renilla luciferase reporter. We found that the relevant luciferase activity in cells co-transfected with miR-142a-3p mimic and Rab3a-WT was greatly reduced, while mimic- and Rab3a-MUT-overexpressing cells showed no change in luciferase activity (Fig. 3b).

Finally, the expression of Rab3a in cells transiently expressing miR-142a-3p mimic (100 nM) or inhibitor (400 nM) was measured by immunofluorescence analysis (Fig. 3e). Representative micrographs and quantitative analysis of the average fluorescence intensity of Rab3a suggested that miR-142a-3p mimic caused a significant reduction in the Rab3a signal, and that the miR-142a-3p inhibitor suppressed the effect (Fig. 3e).

            "text": "PHEV is a severely neuropathic virus that invades the CNS of piglets by the age of 3 weeks, which causes typical nerve dysfunction. Previous studies have reported that miR-142 plays a variety of vital roles in various diseases, such as virus infection, inflammation, and cancer [12, 26]. In addition, miR-142 could be a promising biomarker for the diagnosis of many diseases [27]. Thus, the functional significance of miR-142a-3p during PHEV infection is of interest for research and antiviral therapy. It has been shown that miR-142a-5p disrupts neuronal morphogenesis to promote PHEV infection [28]. Although miR-142a-3p and miR-142a-5p originate from the miR-142a hairpin [12], the relationship between miR-142 and PHEV infection is poorly understood. Here, we verified the interaction between PHEV and miR-142a-3p and found that the amount of miR-142a-3p in mice had increased significantly 5 days after infection with PHEV. Meanwhile, miR-142a-3p RNA was also apparently upregulated in PHEV-infected N2a cells, implying that miR-142a-3p might be involved in PHEV infection in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, our data revealed that enrichment of miR-142a-3p could promote PHEV infection or propagation and that knockdown of miR-142a-3p had an opposite effect. We therefore concluded that miR-142a-3p could affect PHEV accumulation and might also play a specific role in PHEV pathogenesis. More follow-up work is needed to support this view.",

            "text": "How might miR-142a-3p play a role during PHEV infection? Sequencing, bioinformatics, and time course experiments indicated that miR-142a-3p directly targets the Rab3a mRNA 3\u2032UTR. Rab3a is a small G protein that belongs to the RAS family of proteins. It regulates vesicle trafficking and is involved in calcium-triggered exocytosis in nerve cells [29, 30]. Generally, Rab3a protein localizes to the Golgi complex and regulates the synthesis and transport of effectors by interacting with GTPase [31]. Given that PHEV buds from endoplasmic reticulum\u2013Golgi intermediate compartments and is assembled within small vesicles in the trans-Golgi network, we hypothesize that Rab3a, a Golgi-associated protein, may acts as a regulator of PHEV replication or nucleocapsid assembly [11, 32]. In this study, we found that Rab3a deficiency promotes PHEV replication and propagation, while overexpression of Rab3a restricts virus proliferation. Thus, we draw the preliminary conclusion that, in some phase of PHEV infection, Rab3a functions as a negative regulator through base-pairing interactions with miR-142a-3p.",

Although some host miRNAs execute antiviral functions by limiting viral infection in cells, it is still debatable whether an miR-142a-3p antagonist could be used as a potential antiviral therapy against PHEV infection in the physiological context. Much more work in this area still needs to be done in the future.\n",
