Coronaviruses (CoVs) infect a variety of livestock, poultry, and companion animals, in which they can cause serious and often fatal respiratory, enteric, cardiovascular, and neurological diseases.1 The first reports on human coronaviruses (HCoVs) appeared in the mid\u20101960s. The human viruses were isolated from persons with the common cold, and two species were detected: HCoV\u2010229E and HCoV\u2010OC43.2\n",

Thereafter, there was an increase in research on HCoVs worldwide, which has led to the discovery of two other HCoVs, HCoV\u2010NL63 in the Netherlands and HCoV\u2010HKU1 in China.5, 6 Reports have documented that HCoVs are involved in a wide spectrum of clinical presentation in upper and lower respiratory tract illnesses,7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 as well as being a contributor to exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease16 and among patients presenting cystic fibrosis.17 The involvement of other non\u2010respiratory organ systems is still controversial but can occur, for example the enteric and nervous systems.18, 19 Additionally, the role of HCoV infections among susceptible groups, outbreaks, and fatal cases has been documented.20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 However, the majority of reports describe HCoV infections only among children. Moreover, longitudinal studies of CoV epidemiology in the literature are lacking and are restricted to descriptions spanning 1\u20133 years at most.26, 27, 28 In this study, we conducted a comprehensive 9\u2010year study of the epidemiological and clinical features of all four circulating HCoVs (OC43, 229E, HKU1, and NL63) among four different subsets (asymptomatic, general community, with comorbidities, and hospitalized) of adult and child patients.",

The study period began in June 2001 and concluded in September 2010. We collected 1137 samples and stored them at \u221280\u00b0C. The clinical specimens from the studied patients were collected from specific units by trained professionals (nurses or doctors). The specimens comprised 464 nasopharyngeal swabs, 208 nasal aspirations, and 465 nasal lavages. The subjects were 50 asymptomatic adults and 1087 patients presenting acute respiratory infections (ARIs): 465 from the general community (adults, children, and healthcare workers), 410 with comorbidities (children with heart diseases, patients with stem cell and renal transplants), and 212 hospitalized patients (adults and children) originally suspected of H1N1 2009 influenza infection. Of the 1137 studied patients, 591 (51.9%) were adults, while the rest were children. The patients were treated at the primary care health service section of S\u00e3o Paulo Federal University/S\u00e3o Paulo University Hospital in ambulatory or specific units and the emergency room. Each of these specific health services had a variable flow of sampling to respiratory viruses diagnoses, which resulted in collections of different patient groups in this study. Hence, the subjects groups were unevenly distributed throughout the study. The distribution of the studied years and clinical specimens by studied patients is shown in Table 1.",

The reaction was carried out with an initial reverse transcription step at 50\u00b0C for 30 minutes, followed by PCR activation at 95\u00b0C for 15 minutes, 40 cycles of amplification (30 seconds at 94\u00b0C; 30 seconds at 50\u00b0C; 1 minutes at 72\u00b0C), and a final extension step at 72\u00b0C for 10 minutes in a Veriti thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). PCR products were verified on an agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized under UV light. The sensitivity of the assay was assessed by testing 10\u2010fold dilutions of HCoV\u2010NL63 RNA standard curve, which showed sensitivity of 5 \u00d7 105 RNA copies/\u03bcl.

Thus, this city has an uncharacterized climate marked by a wide thermal and meteorological variety. In this regard, it is not possible for us to trace any interaction between climatic and meteorological factors and HCoVs detection. However, due to the long\u2010term HCoV surveillance performed in the present study, it was possible to demonstrate particular trends concerning CoV species seasonality, where different marked peaks of detection were observed for each HCoV species during the 9\u2010year study. Other studies have demonstrated differences between CoV species seasonalities and a winter preference. van der Hoek et al.45 performed a study on HCoV\u2010NL63 revealing that this species infection follows a 2\u2010year interepidemic period with peaks of infection in the winters. Gaunt et al.28 in a study carried out over a period of 3 years in the UK demonstrated a high detection of HCoVs species during winter months.",
