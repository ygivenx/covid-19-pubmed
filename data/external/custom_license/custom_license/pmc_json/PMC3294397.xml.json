Symptoms and possible exposures in the intervening periods between samples were elicited through follow-up questionnaires administered at the time the intraepidemic and postepidemic samples were taken. Symptom reviews covered episodes of ARI, defined as a new onset illness with any respiratory symptoms (rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, sore throat, or cough), with febrile respiratory illness (FRI) being an ARI episode with self-reported fever or a body temperature (where available) >37.5\u00b0C. Information on symptomatic episodes was augmented through sickness absenteeism rates and staff medical records for details such as dates of illness and tests to confirm pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infection. Exposure data covered nonoccupational exposures such as travel out of Singapore and episodes of ARI and FRI in household members, as well as occupational exposures such as care of patients with confirmed pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infection and contact with sick colleagues who have subsequently confirmed pandemic (H1N1) 2009. Healthcare workers were also asked, when appropriate, how often they used either a surgical mask or N95 respirator during patient care and to estimate their average daily number of visitor and patient contacts. The number of colleagues in the same work area was used as a proxy indicator of the number of staff-to-staff contacts.",

In addition, mobile teams were sent to appropriate hospital locations such as wards, outpatient clinics, and other major work areas, such as operating theater, radiology, laboratory medicine, pharmacy, physiotherapy, and occupational therapy departments. Included in these were 3 postulated high-exposure settings: the designated isolation wards for patients with pandemic (H1N1) 2009, the emergency department through which patients with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 were being admitted, and the medical intensive care and high-dependency units where patients with the most severe pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infections were treated. Healthcare workers with ARI episodes that occurred within the 2 weeks before baseline samples were obtained were excluded, given that enrollment stopped 2 weeks after the first TTSH staff member received a diagnosis of pandemic (H1N1) 2009.

Serum samples were pretreated with receptor-destroying enzyme II (Deka Seiken Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), 1:4 (vol/vol), at 37\u00b0C for 16 h before enzyme inactivation by the addition of an equal volume of 1.6% trisodium citrate (Ajax Chemicals, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia) and incubation at 56\u00b0C for 30 min. A/California/7/2009 A(H1N1) pandemic virus was purified on a sucrose gradient, concentrated, and inactivated with \u03b2-propiolactone, to create an influenza zonal pool preparation. Twenty-five microliters (4 hemagglutination units) of influenza zonal pool A/California/7/2009 virus were incubated at room temperature with an equal volume of receptor-destroying enzyme II\u2013treated serum samples, with different wells for serum titrated in 2-fold dilutions from 1:10 to 1:1,280 in phosphate-buffered saline. After incubation of serum for 1 h, 25 \u03bcL of 1% (vol/vol) turkey erythrocytes was added to each well. HI was read after 30 min, with titers expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum in which hemagglutination was prevented. For computing geometric mean titers (GMTs), we assigned titers <10 a value of 5, and titers \u22651,280 a value of 1,280. These values were then log transformed before we computed means and associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs). GMTs were then obtained by back transformation (17).",

The higher seroconversion rates in nurses posted to designated pandemic (H1N1) 2009 isolation wards should be interpreted with some caution in view of the small number of seroconversion events (2 of those infected had symptoms and 2 did not) and participants (n = 17) from these wards. Since masks (either surgical or N95 masks) were widely used in all clinical areas around the hospital, this group essentially had the same level of protection as other staff while being far more intensely exposed to pandemic (H1N1) 2009. The higher risk for seroconversion for nurses on multivariate analysis also deserves notice. Nurses had higher seasonal influenza vaccination rates and were more compliant than other occupational subgroups in following preventive measures such as mask use. However, they also were more likely to be exposed to patients as well as to have colleagues with confirmed pandemic (H1N1) 2009; the latter factor was significantly associated with seroconversion by univariate analysis (and of borderline significance on multivariate analysis), and staff-to-staff transmission was also implicated in TTSH and elsewhere (10,13). Non\u2013ward-based nurses also had higher contact rates than the other main occupational subgroup (allied health staff), a factor that we could not account for in multivariate analysis (as questions on contact rates were not answered by all participants). We also could not account for the nature of patient contacts, which might be more prolonged and intense in nurses (3). We suggest that our finding of the higher seroconversion risk in nurses is the result of residual confounding by the sum of these factors, many of which are an integral part of the nursing profession.",

Studies on nonpandemic influenza have found that index cases from pediatric age groups were more likely to generate secondary cases (25,26), although the same was not observed with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (27). The effect of having children in the household was superseded in multivariate analysis by overall household size, which was unsurprising since households with children also tended to be larger. In any case, the significance of such nonoccupational exposures should be taken into account in any hospital-level pandemic preparedness plan.",

Seasonal influenza vaccination rates may be atypically high in TTSH because of its designated status as a first-line screening and referral center; 1 study on healthcare workers from 2 other hospitals in Singapore found that only 39% of participants were vaccinated (30). Although the low incidence of healthcare workers infections provides some suggestion that measures in place during the pandemic were effective, our findings suggest that some occupation-related risk factors remain.
