A chest x-ray was obtained 13 days after illness onset (on October 13) and was interpreted as unremarkable. She received oseltamivir, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin empirically beginning at admission. Following her hospital admission, no respiratory symptoms were reported until 22 days after illness onset (on October 22), when the patient developed a mild cough, which was noted for 6 days (Figure 1A); she remained on room air throughout. No hypoxia was identified during hospitalization, and her oral temperature peaked at 37.6\u00b0C. Just before discharge, she reported rhinorrhea and was started on oseltamivir following a new diagnosis of influenza. She was discharged 40 days after illness onset (on November 9).",

Cycle threshold (Ct) values of MERS-CoV upE rRT-PCR were available for 11 of the 12 positive specimens and ranged from 25 to 37 (Figure 1B). On day 10 after onset, the upE Ct value was 37, indicating a low viral load; by day 14, the Ct value was much lower, at 25, indicating a notable rise in viral load. An NP swab collected 36 days after illness onset was probable for MERS-CoV, meaning that 1 target was detected but the other was not; target-specific results were not available. The final 2 NP swabs collected 37 and 39 days after illness onset tested negative. The swab collected on day 37 tested positive for influenza A virus (H1N1) by rRT-PCR.

All specimens were frozen and shipped on dry ice. At the CDC, stool suspensions were prepared in phosphate-buffered saline (10% weight/volume).

Testing was performed by MERS-CoV upE and N2 and/or N3 rRT-PCR assays [13]. All specimen extracts were tested neat; stool extracts were also diluted 1:5 in nuclease-free water to remove potential stool inhibitors. Genome sequencing was attempted on positive specimens with Ct values \u226436, as described previously [14]. Nucleotide sequences were aligned using Clustal X, version 1.83, implemented in BioEdit, version 7.2.5.

The cells were observed daily between days 3 and 7 postinoculation; cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed under inverted scope 3 days postinoculation. Any wells that exhibited CPE were harvested and passaged in a 24-well plate. RNA was extracted from 50 \u03bcL of the potential virus lysate. Both lysates were confirmed positive for MERS-CoV by N2 rRT-PCR assay; Ct values were 12 (day 13) and 15 (day 15). The isolated viruses (accession numbers: MG546330-MG546331) were subsequently sequenced using Fluidigm Access Array PCR and MiSeq amplicon sequencing [16]. Whole-genome sequences of the 2 isolated viruses were identical to their clinical specimens, except the day 13 isolated virus, which had mixed bases at positions 23 364 and 25 861 (nucleotide location based on accession number JX869059.2). The variant alleles of the isolate would predict amino acid changes (N>D in spike [S] protein and V>L in ORF4a) that may reflect adaptation in culture. Virus isolation was not attempted for the MERS-CoV RNA-positive stool specimen because of low virus load.",

MERS-CoV RNA was detected in her stool specimen (at day 15) and up to 32 days after illness onset in upper respiratory specimens; low virus load in the stool was coincident with the highest virus loads measured in the upper respiratory tract and may reflect shedding from that compartment.

Patient-reported illness onset (represented as day 0) was on September 30, 2015. Hospital admission and discharge were on days 10 and 40 after illness onset, respectively. Reported symptoms, treatments, and laboratory tests are depicted. The patient\u2019s medical chart was systematically reviewed for administration of medications and for mention of the following symptoms on each day of hospitalization: fever, cough (with description if available), headache, sore throat, dyspnea, chest pain, muscle ache, chills, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and other; rhinorrhea was reported under other symptoms. A solid circle means that the medication was administered or the symptom was reported in the chart. Symptoms not depicted were not reported throughout hospitalization. Temperature was also recorded from regular vital sign measurements. We defined fever as a measured oral temperature of >38.0\u00b0C or a measured axillary temperature of >37.5\u00b0C; she remained afebrile throughout. For test results, a solid circle represents a positive result and an open circle represents a negative result; the red circle at day 36 of the Saudi Arabia Ministry of Health (MoH) real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) results represents a probable positive result (only 1 of 2 rRT-PCR assays was positive; cycle threshold (Ct) values not available).

B, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) upE rRT-PCR Ct values obtained from MoH diagnostic testing by days after illness onset. The dashed line represents the limit of detection, above which specimens were considered MERS-CoV-negative (open circle).
