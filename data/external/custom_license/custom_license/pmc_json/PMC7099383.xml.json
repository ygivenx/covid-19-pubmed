HRV are RNA viruses and more than 160 serotypes have been identified. Clinical importance of HRV infections is well demonstrated in children where they are responsible for more than 70% of asthma exacerbations [15]. In immunocompetent adults, these are the most common cause of self-limited upper respiratory tract infections and could be responsible for more than 80% of common colds in autumn and spring seasons [16]. Immunocompromised hosts are particularly prone to severe infections. In lung transplant patients can be a common infection and lead to graft dysfunction. Among hematological malignancies HRV can produce lower respiratory tract infections with potential adverse consequences [11\u2022\u2022, 17, 18].",

Another possible source for this type of coronavirus is the camel because they have antibodies against MERS-CoV similar to those found in humans. Most human cases of MERS-CoV were described in Saudi Arabia and, to a lesser degree, in the United Arabs Emirates. Later on, other cases outside the Arabian Peninsula were notified, but all of them were imported from endemic countries in the Middle East, and were related to close contact with sick people. Most of the patients were healthy males around 50 years [22].",

Eye protection should always be worn when performing procedures that might generate sprays from respiratory secretions, considering that nose and eyes are the main sites for virus inoculation [2, 47]. CDC also recommends that infected patients be hospitalized in single rooms or kept in cohort isolation if no individual isolation rooms are available. When cohorting, there should be at least 0.9 m of separation between beds [2]. Another measure to be considered is the use of individual equipment for each patient, including toys. Other strategies that help prevent RSV transmission in the healthcare setting include: reducing the quantity of persons in contact with hospitalized patients (especially oncohematological), avoiding the presence of children under 12 years of age in the hospital when RSV circulates either in the community or the hospital, and using single-bed rooms for infected patients [2, 29, 48].",

Vaccination of healthcare workers is the second most important strategy, just behind handwashing, to prevent nosocomial dissemination of influenza [41\u2022\u2022]. Several studies have demonstrated a reduction in morbidity and mortality among patients in different healthcare settings when healthcare workers have been vaccinated against influenza [41\u2022\u2022]. Different strategies were successfully implemented in order to increase vaccine uptake in healthcare personnel. Among these were educational campaigns regarding benefits of the vaccine for patients and personnel, actions addressed to remove administrative barriers for vaccination, implementation of accessible locations for vaccine administration and of signed declination statements, and mandatory vaccination policies for healthcare workers [52]. However, the scientific support for this last strategy has been questioned recently [53].",

Zanamivir, which is administered by inhalation per mouth, has also proved effective in preventing secondary influenza cases in households and healthcare workers [54, 55], but caution is advised, as its efficacy has only been demonstrated in particular circumstances. During a nosocomial outbreak, in high-risk patients and non-vaccinated healthcare workers, antiviral administration should be implemented. When a mismatch between the circulating influenza strain and the vaccine strain is identified, antiviral prophylaxis should be given to all healthcare workers if an outbreak occurs. Duration of antiviral administration during a nosocomial outbreak of influenza should be two weeks or one week after the outbreak control [2].",

While WHO recommends contact isolation and droplet precautions for any suspected case and respiratory precautions only for aerosol generating procedures, the CDC promotes air and contact precautions for all the activities related to patient care (Table 2). Other centers recommend intensification of handwashing, contact precautions, ocular protection and the use of facemasks. Currently, any suspected or confirmed MERS-CoV case should be treated in a medical facility. Transfer and transportation of an infected patient in the hospital environment should include a minimum crew, all wearing surgical facemasks. Healthcare workers with direct patient contact should follow the recommendations mentioned before and keep updated on new recommendations. Any transference of MERS-CoV infected patients from one healthcare setting to another should be coordinated with public health authorities [22, 57, 60].",
