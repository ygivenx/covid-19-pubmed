Should the list of pathogens with which we are most concerned be limited to those that we know have previously been weaponized for use in a biowarfare setting, such as anthrax and tularemia? Should the list extend to other agents that are most vivid in the public consciousness as potentially lethal agents, such as smallpox and plague? Should special attention be paid to agents such as staphylo-coccal enterotoxin B (SEB) and other bacterial toxins, which can be synthesized without the need to have access to traceable, biologic stocks? In fact, the list of US Center for Disease Control (CDC) category A\u2013C pathogens takes an inclusive view, encompassing the widest possible range of agents that could cause widespread death or incapacity (BOXES 1,2 & 3) [101].",

Thus, an enormous additional dividend from the biodefence research programs is the detailed analysis and development of therapeutics for a wide range of natural infections, many of which cause considerable mortality and morbidity in countries of the developing world [2]. Indeed, in a broader context, the biodefence programs can be viewed as bringing about an accelerated coming of age for molecular immunology. There has been a need for rapid progression from a preoccup-ation with the analysis of epitopes in a small number of model antigens, to facing up to the application of this basic knowledge for the analysis of the full pathogenic menagerie that poses a challenge to humankind.\u2022Bacillus anthracis (anthrax)\u2022Clostridium botulinum\u2022Yersinia pestis\u2022Variola major (smallpox) and other pox viruses\u2022Francisella tularensis (tularemia)\u2022Viral hemorrhagic fevers- Arenaviruses- Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, Junin virus,Machupo virus, Guanarito virus- Lassa fever\u2022Bunyaviruses- Hantaviruses- Rift Valley fever\u2022Flaviruses- Dengue\u2022Filoviruses- Ebola- Marburg",

            "text": "Since the Second World War and then the Cold War, anthrax has loomed large in the public consciousness as an agent of biowarfare, owing to the perception of a rapid and painful death in the absence of early access to antibiotics, and the notion of pathogenic spores which can be spread easily as airborne particles and then linger in the ground for decades. In 1942, feeling the need to prepare for the potential use of biologic agents by Nazi forces, the British Army released anthrax spores onto the remote Gruinard Island off the coast of the Scottish Highlands, rapidly killing the island\u2019s resident sheep. It was not until some 50 years later that a contract was issued for heavy-duty decontamination measures on the island, and a fresh herd of sheep was introduced to demonstrate that the process had been successful. The penetrance and potency of anthrax spores was re-emphasized more recently in the attack through the US postal system, in which one of the victims had received a letter which had become minimally contaminated simply by passing through the same sorting machine as one of the deliberately contaminated envelopes. The events of that time also emphasize the enormous challenge to our monitoring systems of being able to detect an attack, characterize it, and then, as alarm mounts, put into place large-scale screening that can accurately identify genuine cases without scoring false-positives or -negatives [1]. Several recent papers have modeled the potential impact of an anthrax attack in the face of different levels of response [4\u20136]. The analysis by Brookmeyer and colleagues concludes, \u201cThe quantification leads us to a realization that the destructive capability of weaponized anthrax is equivalent to that of a nuclear bomb...The model assumes a point-release of 1 kg of spores, concentrated at a trillion spores per gram, from a height of 100 m, in a city of 10 million inhabitants\u2026 The conclusions drawn from computer simulations of the model are stunning, even in the base case (p = 0.0), when the post-attack response is relatively efficient. In the base case, more than 100,000 deaths result in the population of 10 million inhabitants. Less aggressive distribution of antibiotics to asympto-matics (p > 0.0) increases this number up to sevenfold\u201d [4].\u2022Burkholderia pseudomallei\u2022Coxiella burnetii (Q fever)\u2022Brucella species (brucellosis)\u2022Burkholderia mallei (glanders)\u2022Ricin toxin (from Ricinus communis)\u2022Epsilon toxin of Clostridium perfringens\u2022Staphylococcus enterotoxin B\u2022Typhus fever (Rickettsia prowazekii)\u2022Food and waterborne pathogens\u2022Bacteria- Diarrheagenic Escherichia coli- Pathogenic vibrios- Shigella species- Salmonella- Listeria monocytogenes- Campylobacter jejuni- Yersinia enterocolitica\u2022Viruses (caliciviruses, hepatitis A)\u2022Protozoa- Cryptosporidium parvum- Cyclospora cayatanensis- Giardia lamblia- Entamoeba histolytica- Toxoplasma- Microsporidia\u2022Additional viral encephalitides- West Nile virus- LaCrosse- California encephalitis- Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis- Eastern equine encephalomyelitis- Western equine encephalomyelitis- Japanese encephalitis virus- Kyasanur Forest virus",

The history of bioterrorism and evidence for the existence of stockpiles of a range of pathogenic agents has recently been excellently reviewed elsewhere [7]. Certainly, anthrax and smallpox feature strongly in these appraisals because there exists detailed information regarding their past preparation as weaponized stocks, and considerable uncertainty as to the precise whereabouts now of all the material from these historic stockpiles. In this sense, despite the need to move towards a response to potential application of any of the agents on the CDC category A\u2013C pathogens list, not all the threats are regarded as equal, and there are more specific concerns over some agents than others. Smallpox is particularly feared for its ease of person-to-person transmission and high incidence of lethality. In the case of smallpox, there is a considerable degree of strategic confidence based on the historic ability of the vaccinia program to eradicate smallpox as a natural pathogen of man.",

            "text": "It will be clear from the preceding discussion that, in establishing a program of countermeasures to defend against bioterrorist agents, there are difficult questions to be faced regarding which vaccines we need, who should receive them and when, and how one goes about a proper cost\u2013benefit analysis for such a program. Through the developing history of vaccinology, the conceptual framework for each of these issues has tended to be less challenging than the one we currently face. Where there have been common infectious agents that pose a significant threat in terms of morbidity or mortality, and a safe, tested, prophylactic vaccine is available such that the risks from the infection considerably outweigh any risk from side effects of the vaccine, arguments for the benefit of vaccination have been clear. Vaccin-ation against bioterrorist agents, however, carries this debate into new areas. The first question to consider is when to immunize. These questions have often been considered with respect to the issue of the threat of smallpox. This case involves a highly infectious and lethal pathogen for which the cost of inadequate countermeasures, particularly with respect to immunity of healthcare professionals, would be very high. There exists a tried-and-tested vaccine that can, and has, been stockpiled in relatively large amounts. However, there are clearly documented side effects of this vaccine such that, were one to reintroduce very widespread public immunization in the absence of any clear and specific threat of smallpox attack, the number of individuals seriously harmed by the vaccine would outnumber those seen to be saved from a terrorist attack, and public confidence in the countermeasures would be severely shaken [8]. The first compromise is to limit the number to be vaccinated in the first instance, focusing on first-line responders such as medical and military personnel. Clearly though, this sidesteps to some extent the issue of an effective counter-measure to the release of smallpox in a subway system, for example. The next compromise is to argue that mass immunization would be part of the immediate response to any attack. Certainly for an agent such as smallpox, such a measure would be vital to allay fears of an epidemic spreading through the population. For many of the very rapidly acting agents on the category A\u2013C pathogens list, this strategy may have a sense of closing the stable door after the horse has bolted. In the case of anthrax, which would kill within days in the absence of immediate antibiotic cover and yet is not highly contagious, it is harder to argue the effectiveness of an immunization program that might take several boosts over several weeks or months to elicit protective antibodies, unless the fear was of a protracted, ongoing bioterrorist attack. Nevertheless, a case can be made in favor of some effective benefit accruing from postexposure immunization programs in combination, where necessary or appropriate, with antibiotics [9].",

Around 500 members of the US armed forces refused immunizations, a course of events culminating in a legal test case at which Judge Sullivan stated, \u201cCongress has prohibited the administration of investigational drugs to service members without their consent. This court will not permit the government to circumvent this requirement\u201d [10]. This legal precedent will clearly, and quite properly, have far-reaching ramifications for ethical consent issues underpinning development of the forthcoming generation of bioterrorist agent vaccines.",

            "text": "Pulling together the threats, concerns and caveats discussed, it is clear that many hurdles would be overcome if it were possible to move into a new age of high-technology vaccines. The requirements would need to encompass safety, strong potency, but with safe adjuvants such that effective titers could be generated without the need for multiple boosts over long periods, and the incorporation of multiple epitope strings such that defence against several pathogens could be incorporated into a single construct. It is possible that a live vaccine vector could be used to deliver a number of heterologous antigens to achieve multivalent vaccines, or a collection of subunit proteins in an appropriate delivery system could be used to achieve multi-valency. An alternative scenario is that such a vaccine construct may need to take the form of a DNA vaccine and that the selected epitopes in the string would need to be selected for antigen presentation and potency across the widest possible range of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-presenting alleles [9]. Although many trials have been undertaken to investigate the immunologic potency of such vaccines in a wide range of disease settings, the field is still in its infancy. A major step was recently taken towards the creation of such vaccines with the establishment, through the NIAID, of an Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource [2]. However, a number of experimental studies have already been undertaken to investigate the effectiveness of DNA vaccines against biowarfare pathogens. These approaches have included incorporation of anthrax sequences into DNA vaccines, DNA cocktails incorporating both anthrax and plague antigens, or incorporation of anthrax sequences into adenovirus-based vaccine constructs [11\u201313]. Each approach has given a high degree of protection in animal models.",
