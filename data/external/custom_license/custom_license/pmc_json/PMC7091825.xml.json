The operation of an internalization route and its cargo specificity is determined by factors that vary in a context-dependent manner. These factors include one or more underlying principle in cargo enrichment, necessitating specific coat and coat-associated protein assembly, a scission mechanism, and a means to integrate these steps; several molecules and membrane parameters can influence and diversify an endocytic process. In this review, with the intention of summarizing present understanding of principles of endocytosis, we have surveyed different types of endocytic processes, focusing on their molecular attributes and mechanism of vesicle formation at the cell surface.",

At first glance, the scale of this initial membrane invagination provides a natural means of classifying different pathways of endocytosis (Figures 1 and 2). Ingestion of particles larger than 500 nm size typically occurs via triggered processes called 'phagocytosis or macropinocytosis' (Figure 1) whereas cargo below this size limit is often internalized by any of the other diverse endocytic processes available at the cell surface (Figure 2). These include the well-characterized receptor-mediated clathrin-dependent as well as the less understood panoply of clathrin-independent 'pinocytic' pathways.",

In a metazoan system, cargoes for phagosomes range from non-self-particles and microbial organisms to self-entities such as apoptotic cells and cellular debris. The process is initiated by cell-surface recognition of the particle, and proceeds via sequential engagement of receptors, generating a cup-shaped membrane distortion around the particle, culminating in a phagosome. Two well-described types of phagocytic entry are: (i) Ig receptor, FcR-mediated engulfment of immunoglobulin G-opsonized particles and (ii) complement receptor CR3-mediated ingestion of C3bi-coated particles. Both the means of phagocytic entry form morphologically distinct phagocytic cups and represent different types of phagocytic mechanisms (Figure 1A). Thus the morphology of forming invagination and resultant compartment is a crucial parameter for classifying these processes.",

This leads to localized actin rearrangement, membrane extension around ligand, and thereby further engagement of receptors with ligand in a protruding cup with zipper-lock arrangement. In CR3-type phagocytosis (termed 'trigger-like'), on the other hand, the process is triggered by treatment with either phorbol esters or extracellular agonists 10, 11 and the particle is loosely encased in a large membrane vesicle. The site of phagocytosis has discrete patch-like distribution of F-actin, and occurs by a regulated and triggered depression in the cell surface. There are instances, for example, engulfment of necrotic cells, where the morphology is in between the two 1. In either case formation of phagosomes is achieved by spatiotemporally controlled sequential action of various small actin-remodeling GTPases 12. The two modes also differ in their requirements for Rho-GTPases, in that FcR-mediated phagocytosis relies on Rac1 and Cdc42 activities, whereas CR3-mediated entry is specifically dependent on RhoA 12, 13.",

Here too, two general models have been described that outline bacterial entry into cells: the 'trigger' or 'zipper' models. Salmonella and Shigella are examples of 'triggering' bacteria; Salmonella injects its effector, SopB, into cells, which activates an exchange factor for RhoG, leading to actin remodeling that causes internalization of the bacterium 14. The 'zippering' model of entry of the bacteria is similar to FcR-mediated internalization, as it involves engagement of cell-surface receptors all around the particle being internalized. A good example of this 'zippering' kind of bacterium is Listeria Monocytogenes, where the bacterium interacts with host epithelial cells through its adhesins, InlA and InlB, that bind host cell receptors E-cadherin and Met, respectively 15.",

            "text": "Live cell imaging using RAW264.7 macrophages, a phagocyte model system, and Forster's Resonance Energy Transfer sensor for the small, activated GTPases, ADP ribosylation factors (ARFs) showed that FcR-mediated phagocytosis accompanies dynamic and stepwise activation of ARF6 and ARF1 16. This correlated with activation of Cdc42 and Rac1 17. Activity of the Rho GTPases is presumably required for regulation of actin polymerization during phagocytic cup formation; simultaneous inhibition of both Cdc42 and Rac1 abolishes this. Inhibition of these GTPases individually however only partially inhibits phagocytosis, suggesting they act in tandem during the process. These Rho GTPases upon activation, recruit WASP and thereby the Arp2/3 complex for actin nucleation and polymerization 18. The action of GTPases is probably regulated by the composition of polyphosphoinositides (PIPs) of the phagosomal membrane. PIPs are also intimately linked to actin dynamics 19. During early stages of cup formation, PI4,5P2 is enriched at the inner leaflet of the cup; during phagosome closure, rapid disappearance of F-actin at the base of the cup is correlated with the reduction in local concentration of PI4,5P2. Consistent with this, overexpression of the PI-kinase (PIPKI), which converts PI4P into PI4,5P2 or inhibition of PLC and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K, enzymes that produce IP3, DAG, and PI3,4,5P3, respectively) abrogates phagosome closure 2, 20.",

The size and morphology of macropinosomes are typically independent of ligand, although their formation can be stimulated by agents such as phorbol esters, some pathogens, and GFs 25, 27, 28, 29. In professional antigen-presenting cells, macropinocytosis operates constitutively in quiescent circulating cells such as immature dendritic cells and is downregulated after these cells begin to mature 6, 30, suggesting a role in immune surveillance. As noted above, intracellular pathogens also exploit macropinocytosis as a means of entry into cells. Pathogens such as Shigella and Salmonella inject virulence factors that modulate the cytoskeleton, induce ruffling and subsequently, macropinocytosis. Infection rates of bacteria such as Sphingomona\n31 and viruses such as HIV type I 32 are reduced upon inhibiting macropinocytosis using amiloride.",

EGF binding results in activation of Rac1 GTPase as well as generation of the phosphoinositide, PI4,5P2, both of which together activate WASP/SCAR proteins. These in turn bind to the Arp2/3 complex, hence modulating actin polymerization.

In these embryonic stem cells, fluid-phase tracer uptake, as an indicator of stimulated macropinocytosis, was rescued by reintroduction of dynamin-1 or 2 38, suggesting that dynamin is crucial for this form of macropinocytosis. However, at this stage it is not clear whether dynamin could serve as a scissoring protein for specific cases of macropinocytosis, or has other regulatory functions for endocytosis.

This assembly can be further stabilized by epsin and AP180/CALM, which bind to AP2, PIP2, and clathrin 49. Subsequent to this, stabilization of the clathrin-coated pit (CCP) requires cargo acquisition via subunits of AP2 and clathrin 46, 50. This step proceeds via the recruitment of various AP2-binding partners that facilitate cargo binding, optimal clathrin polymerization, and membrane bending. The process of membrane bending is brought about in part by BAR (Bin Amphiphysin Rvs) domain-containing proteins 9, such as endophilin and amphiphysin, and is further facilitated by epsin and inherent curvature properties of assembled clathrin structures 51, 52. Mature clathrin-coated vesicle, while still attached to the PM, contains amphiphysin and recruits the pinching module that contains the protein dynamin. Dynamin eventually promotes the scission of the vesicle (see later section for details).",

CCPs at the cell surface are of diverse composition with respect to the usage of adaptor and associated proteins 54, 55, and offer distinct microenvironments for the regulated entry of specific combinations of cargoes 56. Interestingly, ligand concentration also affects the mode of this endocytic route: for example, EGF, at low concentrations, is internalized by a clathrin-dependent endocytic route 57, but at higher concentrations, seems to enter cells through clathrin-independent routes with consequences for signaling via the EGFR 58. How such fine-tuning and discrimination are regulated is a subject of current investigation 56.",

For some viruses this route is obligatory, and for others the clathrin pathway is one of a few that support infection. Studies on the entry of influenza virus in epithelial cells have indicated that a large fraction is endocytosed into CCPs; viral particles are also endocytosed by non-clathrin pathway operating in parallel 60. Viruses that take a clathrin-dependent route more often induce formation of clathrin pit at the site of binding at the PM rather than entering a preassembled clathrin structure 59. This suggests a flexibility in regulation of clathrin-coated vesicle formation. Similarly, in case of bacterial uptake, the entry of the bacterium, L. monocytogenes, into HeLa cells was sensitive to depletion of clathrin heavy chain and other endocytic proteins such as dynamin, Eps15, but not the adaptor AP2. This was unexpected because it suggests that cargo 20 times larger than a normal endocytic cargo could use the clathrin-based machinery to enter a non-phagocytic mammalian cell, reiterating the flexibility in clathrin-mediated endocytic processes, both in terms of size and associated machinery 61.",

Caveolae were originally described as flask-shaped structures in ultrastructure of blood capillaries by Palade in 1953 62, but it was not until much later that the coat component, caveolin, was identified 63. Caveolae are formed by assembly of caveolins, integral membrane proteins that bind directly to membrane cholesterol. There are three subtypes of caveolin proteins, caveolin-1, caveolin-2, and caveolin-3, the former two being responsible for caveolae formation in non-muscle cells and latter in muscle cells 64. A recent study demonstrated that while morphological features of caveolae are widely conserved, the functions of individual caveolin proteins may be diverse 65. Many mammalian cell lines such as human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells, Caco2 66, or tissues (e.g. many blood cell lineages) do not have detectable levels of caveolin, pointing toward the specialized tissue-specific function of caveolins. Overexpression of caveolins in the cells lacking them induces de novo formation of caveolae 67, 68.",

In many of these cases the receptors for specific cargoes have also been identified but the mechanism by which cargo is concentrated in caveolae is not understood. In addition, endocytosis via caveolae also remains poorly characterized. It is not clear if caveolar endocytosis is constitutive, albeit occurring at a low rate, and is massively up-regulated on specific induction. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching studies has indicated caveolae to be relatively stable structures on PM 78, which can however be made to bud off by the interaction of pathogens such as SV40 virus 79 or can also be induced by incorporation of fluorescent analogues of sphingolipids, namely, lactosyl ceramide 80, 81, 82. During integrin-dependent cell adhesion, de-adherence induces removal of caveolin-coated membrane from the cell surface, and it has been shown that caveolin is required for this process 83. This results in altered PM lipid composition, due to the loss of many lipids and proteins that partition into detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) domains. This has significant functional consequences foremost of which is loss of Rac1 activity at the cell surface, and consequently remodeling of the cortical cytoskeleton, and activation of anoikisis, a form of apoptosis induced by the loss of cell anchorage 83, 84.",

In mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) obtained from caveolin-1 knockout mice, albumin uptake was found to be defective 86, but the entry of SV40 87 and cholera toxin B subunit (CTxB) 88, two typical cargoes of caveolae, was not compromised. This could be explained by the possibility that caveolin, when present, induces formation of caveolae, but is dispensable for internalization of some caveolar cargoes. In addition, there is evidence that caveolins can negatively regulate entry of certain cell-surface proteins, including CTxB 89, 90, where overexpression of caveolins prevents their internalization, suggesting that apart from their direct role in endocytosis, caveolins can indirectly influence other endocytic pathways. A novel role for caveolin-1 has been reported, in regulation of Cdc42 activity during membrane trafficking events. Caveolin-1 binds preferentially to Cdc42 in its GDP-bound form and functions as a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI) for Cdc42. Thus, by maintaining Cdc42 in an inactive state, caveolin-1 regulates basal secretion in the absence of stimuli in pancreatic \u03b2-cells 91. It is possible that caveolin-1 has similar indirect regulatory roles at PM via inhibitory interactions with mediators of other endocytic pathways. Endocytosis of SV40 virus has been reported to increase in cells lacking caveolin-1 87, indicating an inhibitory role for caveolin-1 in this process. However in this study it was not clear whether this effect is due to squelching of effector molecules or due to sequestration of a specific kind of membrane components. Studies exploring redundant endocytic roles of caveolin will be invaluable in understanding the regulatory cross-talk between caveolar and non-caveolar internalization pathways.",

Cycling of mutants through restrictive and permissive temperatures, Koenig and Ikeda observed a reversible loss of synaptic vesicles at neuromuscular synaptic junctions, implicating dynamin in synaptic vesicle endocytosis 16.

Dynamin oligomerization and dynamics lead to constriction and eventually budding of the vesicle. The exact function of dynamin at the level of vesicle fission has been a subject of controversy. There are various hypotheses regarding the GTP-dependent mechanism of dynamin action for vesicle pinching. First is the conformational change in dynamin brought about by GTP loading (switch model), which can cause scission by recruiting other molecules that will fuse membranes and acts essentially as a timer for this reaction, whereas the other relies on the actual mechanical force generated at the vesicle neck (pinchase model). While there is evidence for both the GTP switch and mechanoenzyme functions of dynamin 102, recent studies support a mechanoenzyme or motor-like function of dynamin. The in vitro demonstration of dynamin-coated lipid tubules twisting in response to supply of GTP was a direct evidence supporting a mechano-enzyme behavior where the authors argue that in addition to membrane tension, torsional strain generated at the neck of the vesicle can lead to pinching 103. Two other studies demonstrated that it is the kinetics of dynamin depolymerization and polymerization on 'tension-free' membranes that brings about changes in membrane curvature, necessary for fission 104, 105. At this point both these possibilities have distinct implications on the dynamics of dynamin action during pinching as discussed 106.",

For example, the acceptance of clathrin-independent endocytosis was built on a number of studies: (i) injection of African green monkey kidney cells (CV1) with anti-clathrin antibodies abolished receptor-mediated uptake completely, but inhibited the uptake of a bulk phase marker (lucifer yellow) by only 40% 112, and (ii) clathrin-dependent endocytosis could also be inhibited by hypotonic shock, cytosolic potassium depletion, or acidification of cytosol while under all these conditions, endocytosis of the plant toxin ricin continued to take place 113, 114.

It is also possible, however, that lipid or protein accretions could initiate membrane deformation (vesicle formation) without defined coat proteins. While the pathways that require coats also have their specific lipid requirements 115, 116, in some instances, lipid organization alone has proven to be sufficient for membrane invagination. Shiga toxin entry is one such example where binding of toxin to the ganglioside, Gb3, induces invaginations in cells as well as model membranes 117. This was specific to toxin binding, since simply cross-linking Gb3 with antibodies failed to result in invaginations. These studies provide evidence for the requirement of a specific lipid-binding architecture for this process. A lipid-compaction model was proposed for the segregation and membrane budding induced by the toxin. This process was inhibited by increasing membrane tension, indicating that membrane properties, tension, and bending rigidity might play a crucial role in the regulation of lipid-based invaginations. Endocytosis of the lipid-anchored proteins such as glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) also does not appear to require any of the well-characterized coat proteins 64, 88, 118, 119. This pathway could be another example where the foundation for membrane deformation is laid by membrane lipids (see the CLIC/GEEC pathway below). An example where a protein platform suffices to support endocytosis is the process of human papillomavirus 16 (HPV16) virus infection, where tetraspanin-enriched domains are required for virus entry 120.",

Interpretation of such experiments is however, complex. It is difficult to ascertain whether lack of defect is due to lack of involvement of dynamin, or due to an alternative internalization pathway that is induced by inhibition of dynamin. Alternatively, the ability of dynamin mutants to interfere with the activity of Rac 39 suggests that inhibition of a particular pathway may not reflect a direct role for dynamin. From the existing examples under the canopy of dynamin-independent pathways, there are also specific requirements for small GTPases such as the ARF family proteins, and the Rho family proteins (Table 1). These GTPases could function as timers for regulation of the assembly and disassembly of actin-based endocytic mechanism or as scaffold to recruit other regulatory proteins. However, it is evident that while these GTPases can be utilized in combination, they have a diversity of functions not solely restricted to endocytosis 109, 125.",

In a mutant screen for endocytic defects in yeast, a large number of identified genes were related to actin and its regulators 127; subsequently, the recruitment of actin to the sites of endocytosis was elegantly demonstrated in live cells 128. One of the first identified genes involved in \u03b1-factor uptake was act1 (end7), the yeast actin gene. Nearly a third of endocytic proteins identified in yeast bind actin or regulate its assembly. A specific kind of actin structure, called 'cortical actin patches' has been observed to be associated with endocytic sites. Using real-time fluorescence microscopy and particle tracking, Drubin and colleagues 129 demonstrated that there are different cortical actin patches - with distinct protein composition and motility properties; and these were intermediates in the endocytic process. Subsequently, using a live imaging screen of deletion mutants, where they dissected defects in coat dynamics and actin assembly, they provided evidence for the existence of distinct protein modules for coat formation, membrane invagination, actin-meshwork assembly, and vesicle scission during clathrin- or actin-mediated endocytosis 130. In the same study, they also demonstrated that, in yeast, while clathrin facilitates endocytic site assembly, it is not required for membrane invagination or vesicle formation. Based on these studies, a fission mechanism for such a pathway has been recently proposed 131. This model suggests that endocytosis can be initiated at a site where the membrane invaginates, and then elongates into a tube through the encasement by active polymerization of actin, culminating in the scission of a membrane bud of different membrane and protein compositions via traction by myosin motors 132. Considering that clathrin and its effectors also associate with these vesicles, it is not yet established if actin alone acts as the coat 133.",

These proteins belong to a family of proteins with diverse functions and have been shown to be internalized by a dynamin-independent endocytic route, into a specialized early endosomal compartment, where a majority of the internalized fluid phase is also detected in many cell types 119.

            "text": "CLICs/GEECs are selectively enriched for GPI-APs 119 although at this stage the sorting determinants at PM are not clear. It could potentially be lipid-based sorting, as alterations in cholesterol and sphingolipid levels as well as perturbation of the nanocluster state of the GPI-AP affect endocytosis through this pathway 64, 119, 137. However, a recent study shows the size of extracellular moiety attached to the lipid tail as an additional determinant for inclusion into GEECs 138. It will be interesting to investigate the size range of proteins that allows them to be endocytosed via GEECs and also, how the size-based regulation crosstalks to lipid-mediated sorting into the GEEC pathway. Another feature of endocytosis via CLICs/GEECs is its dependence on the actin polymerization machinery 64; maintenance of dynamic cortical actin architecture appears to be required for GEEC endocytosis. This is brought about by the cycling of the Rho family GTPase Cdc42 and downstream activation of the WASP protein, since locking of Cdc42 in GDP or the GTP state leads to inhibition of the GEEC pathway 135. Cdc42 dynamics on PM is regulated by ARF1; activation of ARF1 leads to recruitment of a Rho-GAP domain-containing protein, ARHGAP10, and inactivates Cdc42, thus maintaining its cycling 135. Another recently reported effector of GEEC formation is a BAR domain-containing protein, GTPase regulator associated with focal adhesion kinase-1 (GRAF1). Endogenous GRAF1 localizes to CLIC/GEEC carriers in HeLa cells and silencing its expression results in reduced GEEC marker uptake 139. GRAF1 colocalizes with active Cdc42 and contains a Rho-GAP domain, so it may be involved in regulating Cdc42 dynamics apart from its other functions. GRAF1 also contains a BAR domain, which could aid in membrane curvature and an SH3 domain, capable of interacting with dynamin GTPase. It is interesting to note that while GEEC formation is dynamin-independent, dynamin appears to be recruited to GEECs post internalization 88; this could potentially be mediated by GEEC-associated proteins such as GRAF1, which has been shown to interact with dynamin.",

Considering its constitutive nature, fast kinetics and heterogeneous resultant vesicle size, the GEEC pathway could mediate the regulation of PM homeostasis. There are an increasing number of proteins internalized by pathways that bear a resemblance to the GEECs. Endocytosis of cholera toxin 88, internalization of VacA toxin, and sorting nexin 9 (SNX9)-regulated GPI-AP internalization routes are examples similar to GEECs 141, 142. Another cargo for a GEEC-like pathway is dysferlin, a muscle repair protein, mutations in which are associated with several myopathies. In MEFs devoid of caveolin-1, dysferlin is endocytosed into compartments containing GPI-APs and its cellular entry is independent of dynamin activity, indicating that internalization could potentially be carried out via the GEEC pathway 89.",

            "text": "Role of tetraspanins Another protein platform that supports endocytosis is the family of tetraspanins. Dynamin-independent endocytosis of HPV16 is localized to tetraspanin domains (CD63, CD151) of the PM and CD151 knockdown in cells blocked HPV16 entry 120. This mode of endocytosis is distinct from other dynamin-independent routes in that, it is not inhibited by perturbation of cholesterol levels in the cell 120, nor does it rely on cellular levels of clathrin, caveolin, and flotillin. However, exact steps in this endocytic mechanism, as well as the associated molecular players, are still unclear. Recently, it was demonstrated that endocytosis of a tetraspanin, CD82, is dynamin-independent and occurs via a Cdc42-dependent GEEC-like pinocytic pathway 159. It raises an interesting possibility that while tetraspanins regulate a distinct cholesterol-independent internalization route, they may utilize a different endocytic pathway for their own cellular entry 159.",

In a study using electron microscopy, PM-associated invaginations containing electron-dense tracer and clathrin coats were visualized 176. More recently, uptake of FM dyes was demonstrated in plant cells 177, following which many studies reported endocytosis of membrane markers and specific proteins in plant root hair cells, pollen tube, and cultured tobacco cells 178. Now there is accumulating evidence about the diversity of endosomal pathways and endocytic compartments in plants. Although most of the studies used FM dyes to monitor internalization in plants, advancements in probing techniques are revealing a diversity of endocytic routes in this kingdom. Apart from clathrin-dependent receptor-mediated endocytosis, actin-sensitive fluid-phase endocytosis in inner cortex cells of maize root 179 and PI3K-dependent bulk phase sucrose endocytosis in suspension culture cells of sycamore have been reported 180. Blockade of clathrin-mediated endocytosis using ikarugamycin (Ika) did not inhibit uptake of positively charged nanogold particles, suggesting the operation of a clathrin-independent pathway 181. However, in another study, Dhonukshe et al., showed that total membrane uptake in BY-2 tobacco cells could be inhibited by inhibiting clathrin using clathrin hub dominant negative form, suggesting that clathrin is absolutely required for any form of endocytosis 182. It is possible that a diversity of endocytic portals are conserved in plant and animal systems, and several modes of endocytosis operate in plant cells in a cell type- and tissue- specific manner.",

These proteins therefore need to utilize radically different principles for sorting, membrane deformation, and vesicle generation at PM. Similarly, much less is known about endocytosis of membrane lipids. Dissection of the endocytic process of lipids will give insights into a novel way of vesicle formation. Also considering the multiplicity of functions of proteins, it will be interesting to investigate the overlapping functions of molecules known to be associated with specific trafficking pathways.",

During phagocytic cup formation (left panel), sequential engagement of Fc-receptor initiates a zipper-like arrangement in opposition with bacterial surface. The process is orchestrated by stepwise involvement of GTPases and involves actin polymerization. Membrane remodeling during phagocytosis is accompanied with membrane addition to PM, in an AP1-dependent vesicular process. In trigger-type particle entry (right panel), the process involves injection of soluble effectors into cell, which, among other events, can activate Rho GTase effectors, and hence culminating in actin polymerization at the site of bacterial entry. Variations that exhibit intermediate forms, also exist, but have not been included here. (B) EGF-induced macropinocytosis\u2013a most extensively studied example of macropinocytosis. Binding of EGF to EGF receptor triggers the intracellular signaling cascade and activation of downstream proteins, as indicated, eventually leading to actin-rich membrane ruffle formation. Collapse of ruffle on membrane is followed with macropinosome formation.",
