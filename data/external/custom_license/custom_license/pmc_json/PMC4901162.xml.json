            "text": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV), a member of the Flaviviridae family, is a major cause of chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide [1]. It has a single positive-strand RNA genome encoding a large polyprotein precursor that is processed co- and post-translationally, by cellular and viral proteases, to yield 10 different proteins [2, 3]. The structural proteins core, E1, and E2 are the main constituents of the virus particle [4]. The p7 and NS2 proteins are required for virion assembly [5, 6], whereas NS3 to NS5B constitute the minimal viral replicase [7, 8]. This replicase includes the NS3/4A protein, which has serine-type protease, NTPase, and helicase activities, the NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and the NS5A replicase factor. NS4B is a highly hydrophobic protein that plays a major role in triggering the rearrangement of intracellular membranes [9, 10]. Like most positive-strand RNA viruses, HCV forms a membrane-associated replication complex, consisting of viral proteins, replicating RNA, altered cellular membranes, and other host factors [11, 12]. These specific membrane alterations, known as the \u201cmembranous web\u201d, were first identified with the HCV replicase construct model (subgenomic replicon) and were described as a cluster of vesicles measuring 80\u2013100 nm in diameter [9, 13].",

In this study, we used the Huh7.5/JFH-1 HCVcc model reproducing the complete infectious HCV cycle [19\u201321] to analyze, by electron microscopy (EM), the kinetics of virus-induced host cell membrane alterations during the course of HCV infection.",

The ViCs were small single-membrane vesicles grouped together in well-delimited areas (Fig. 1a). Most of these ViCs had an internal invagination (high magnification in Fig. 1b). The CVs were small single-membrane vesicles, present in large number and widely distributed through the cytoplasm (Fig. 1c). They were tightly associated and tended to form a collar around the lipid droplets (LD, high magnification in Fig. 1d). Finally, DMVs were heterogeneous in size and had a thick, electron-dense membrane (Fig. 1e). Examination at higher magnification (Fig. 1f) revealed the presence of a double membrane in some areas, suggesting the close association of two membranes in these vesicles, as previously reported in cells stably carrying a subgenomic JFH-1 replicon [14] and in cells infected with coronaviruses [16]. Some very large DMVs presented more complex structures forming multimembrane vesicles (MMV) or multivesicular bodies (MVB) (data not shown), as previously reported in the subgenomic replicon model [14].\n",

We also studied these cells by confocal microscopy (Fig. S2 in the supplemental material), to allow comparison of the overall distribution of these HCV components by immuno-EM and immunofluorescence microscopy. The core protein was observed in discrete foci on day 2 but strongly associated with the LD on day 6 post infection (Fig. S2). The NS5A protein remained dispersed throughout the cytoplasm throughout infection but displayed partial colocalization with LD on day 6 post infection. The labeling of dsRNA remained highly punctate from day 2 to day 6 post infection (Fig. S2). For the HCV RNA, core, and NS5A proteins, the signal was much more intense on day 6 post infection than on day 2 post infection (Fig. S2). This may account for the lack of significant immuno-EM labeling on immuno-EM of ultrathin cell sections on day 2 post infection (data not shown). We therefore focused our immuno-EM analysis on cells studied 6 days after infection (Fig. 3). For these cells, analyzed by freeze substitution, the fixation and embedding procedure resulted in a poorer preservation of cell structure than observed with standard EM methods, as previously reported by other groups [25]. However, cell structure was sufficiently well preserved for the observation of HCV core and NS5A proteins at the LD surface (Fig. 3a\u2013c), as reported by others in Huh7.5 cells infected with the HCV JFH-1 strain [26]. Both proteins were also detected in the CVs, particularly in those surrounding the LDs (Fig. 3a, b, d). NS5A was also associated with the membranes of the DMVs (Fig. 3e), and dsRNA was detected within the DMVs or associated with their membranes (Fig. 3f), as previously observed with the subgenomic JFH-1 replicon model [14]. By monitoring and counting the gold particles in 10 consecutive cell sections for each type of immunogold labeling, we determined that 81 % of the core protein signal was associated with the LD surface, whereas 16 % of this signal was associated with the CVs (Table 1). For NS5A, we estimated that 60 % of the signal was associated with the DMVs, 27 % with the CVs, and 13 % with the LD surface (Table 1). Finally, the dsRNA signal was more heterogeneously distributed, with some labeling of the nucleus and mitochondria in some cells, but it was nonetheless predominantly associated with the DMVs (70 % of the signal, Table 1).\n\n",

The larger numbers of DMVs at later stages of infection made it difficult to visualize intracellular organization clearly. Figure 4 shows a typical cell, with HCV-induced membranous structures closely associated with LD clusters (in yellow). Numerous small CVs (in purple) tend to surround these LDs, with the DMVs (in red) forming a massive network.

            "text": "Positive-strand RNA viruses are known to rearrange host cellular membranes to facilitate viral genome replication. However, the biogenesis and 3D organization of these membrane alterations and their relationship to the various stages of the infectious cycle remain unclear. Viruses from the Flaviviridae family, including the Kunjin virus (KUNV)\u2014the Australian variant of the West Nile virus (WNV)\u2014and Dengue virus (DENV), induce morphologically different membrane structures that probably play distinct roles in the viral infectious cycle [27, 28]. Immunolabeling studies with an anti-dsRNA antibody have suggested that membrane sacs containing small vesicles, known as vesicle packets (VPs), are the site of replication, whereas large convoluted membranes (CMs) are the site of viral polyprotein processing [29, 30]. In this study, we showed that HCV produces three morphogically different types of vesicle (i.e. ViCs, CVs, and DMVs), which appear as soon as 1 day after infection. The increase in the number of CVs observed 2 days after cell infection was correlated with an increase in intracellular HCV RNA levels. This correlation suggests a possible role for CVs in the early stages of viral replication. The presence of NS5A in these CVs, as demonstrated by immunogold staining, is consistent with this hypothesis. We also observed that the number of DMVs gradually increased over time. Further investigations are required, but this observation suggests that DMVs may be derived from CVs. Interestingly, a similar filiation is now proposed for the poliovirus and coronavirus models [31, 32]. DMVs were initially thought to carry the coronavirus replication complexes [16], but it has been shown that DMVs contain mostly dsRNA associated with several nonstructural proteins, and that their contents do not appear to be connected to the cytoplasm [31]. These previously reported findings for various viral models suggest that DMVs may help to conceal the viral RNA, enabling the virus to evade the dsRNA-triggered antiviral responses of the host, such as those mediated by the dsRNA-dependent protein kinase. In the coronavirus model, viral replication seems to occur preferentially in the membrane rearrangements known as convoluted membranes, which may be the precursors of the coronavirus-induced DMVs [31]. Moreover, a recent study in the poliovirus model demonstrated that DMVs are the most prevalent structures at late stages of the infectious cycle and that they originate from single-membrane structures that predominate during the exponential phase of viral RNA synthesis [32]. It remains unclear whether the similar ultrastructural changes observed in cells in which HCV, coronaviruses, and polioviruses are replicating reflect a similar intracellular organization. In the HCV model, DMVs may be the site of active viral replication, as most of the dsRNA signal obtained in our immuno-EM analysis of HCV-infected cells on day 6 post infection was located within the DMVs or at DMV membranes. It remains unclear whether these DMVs also help to conceal the replicated RNA from the antiviral defense system of the host cell, as suggested in other viral models. Interestingly, in our previous EM investigations of Huh7.5 cells stably carrying a highly replicative JFH-1 subgenomic replicon, ViCs and CVs were rarely observed, as these cells contained almost exclusively DMVs. However, in this particular model, cells are analyzed after the definitive establishment of HCV replication. This supports the hypothesis that DMVs are derived from other membranous alterations and constitute the main membrane alteration associated with well-established HCV replication.",

            "text": "We did not detect the presence of viral components in the ViCs by immuno-EM. The lower frequency of these structures than of other membrane alterations and the difficulties involved in identifying them in cells prepared by freeze substitution may account for this finding. Alternatively, although ViCs were found specifically in HCV-infected cells, they may be free of viral proteins and dsRNA. A remarkable and intriguing feature of these ViCs was the frequent presence of an intravesicular invagination. Further investigations are required to determine whether this particular feature is also linked to the biogenesis of DMVs, acting as the source of the future double membrane. The 3D reconstruction of whole HCV-infected cells demonstrated that all these membrane rearrangements were tightly connected and closely associated with the LD clusters. It has been shown that HCV core protein accumulates on the surface of LDs, and this attachment is linked to the production of infectious viruses in HCV-infected cells [26]. NS5A is a membrane-associated RNA-binding protein involved in the HCV replication complex that has also been found on the surface of LDs and shown to be involved in HCV assembly [33]. According to recent models, viral assembly involves an interaction between HCV core and RNA-loaded NS5A [34]. However, it remains unclear whether this interaction occurs at the surface of LDs or at adjacent host cell membranes [34]. Our immuno-EM and 3D EM reconstructions of HCV-infected cells suggest that the CVs surrounding the LDs may constitute the membranous platform for viral assembly. However, we were unable to visualize unambiguously the formation of viral particles in infected cells and in CVs in particular, despite the meticulous observation of serial sections from several entire cells. Further efforts are required to improve our understanding of the HCV\u2013host cell interactions leading to viral replication and assembly.",
