The reported incidence of radiologically confirmed pneumonia is 27 per 1000 child-years among NT children aged < 5 years [3], and for bronchiolitis it is 380 per 1000 child-years in those aged < 12 months [2]. Moreover, the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7), introduced in 2001, did not significantly reduce the incidence of WHO radiologically confirmed pneumonia among children aged < 18 months [4].",

These were both hospital-based. Worldwide, many studies have identified the presence of viruses and bacteria in children\u2019s respiratory secretions during an ALRI [7]; however, the contribution to infection of individual microbes, polymicrobial communities, and microbe-host interactions at the individual and population levels remains poorly understood. Furthermore, the value of nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) for informing microbiology in the lung has been questioned. For example, in NT children hospitalized with pneumonia, nasopharyngeal bacteria and viruses were not associated with clinical signs on admission or during recovery [6], questioning the utility of NPS taken at the time of ALRI in clinical diagnosis or for prognosis in children with already high carriage of respiratory pathogens. Recent data from the PERCH study confirmed the limited value of cross-sectional NPS for diagnosing ALRI [8].",

In a large childhood pneumonia aetiology study in South Africa where a high incidence of pneumonia is reported, RSV in NP swabs was most strongly associated with pneumonia in case-control comparisons followed by IFV, HBoV, HAdV, and cytomegalovirus [21]. Additional analysis of induced sputum specimens also identified Bordetella pertussis, H. influenzae type b, M. pneumoniae and PIV as associated with pneumonia [21]. Whilst a meta-analysis of 23 studies demonstrated that RSV, IFV, PIV, hMPV and HRV, were associated with ALRI in children aged < 5 years, there was no significant difference in detection of HAdV between cases and controls [22]. A recent prospective, community-based, longitudinal birth cohort study involving non-Indigenous Australian children also could not attribute parent-reported ALRI symptoms to detecting HAdV by PCR in weekly collected nasal swab specimens [23]. Nonetheless, HAdV disease outbreaks are known to occur; for example, types 2, 3, and 7 were observed in children during a 2011 Taiwan community outbreak, with type 7 associated with more severe disease [24]. HAdV outbreaks also occur in military training centres associated with crowded living conditions; however, reintroduction of a type 4 and 7 vaccine in 2011 was followed by a reduction in acute respiratory infection in this population [25]. Whilst HAdV type 7 (HAdV B) was detected in our study, HAdV C types were most common, as was shown previously in respiratory specimens in another Australian study [26].",

Respiratory viruses can promote bacterial superinfection by multiple mechanisms that decrease bacterial clearance, increase bacterial adherence, and suppress immunity during recovery (reviewed [7]). Bacteria can also promote viral infection by facilitating attachment to host cells or contributing to elevated virus production or release from airway cells (reviewed [7]). However, a meta-analysis of 19 studies found that evidence to support the role of viral co-infection in increasing disease severity was inconclusive [27].

Nevertheless, we performed a secondary analysis of specimens and data from studies not specifically designed to address our aim. Furthermore, diagnostic classification relied on clinic records which may lack accuracy. Additionally, ALRI episodes ranged from mild to severe disease, with an under-representation of hospital cases. This clinical heterogeneity may translate to microbial differences, and thus future studies should analyse the range of disease phenotypes. Indeed, where we previously found that 42% of NPS from Indigenous infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis were RSV-positive [29], few NPS were RSV-positive for cases in the current study, despite bronchiolitis being a common diagnosis (56% of 182 episodes). This difference may be due to sampling of primarily non-hospitalized ALRI cases in infants outside the first 6 months of life.",

Whereas most studies have investigated microbial exposures concurrent to the outcome, our study captured the nasopharyngeal microbiology prior to the ALRI onset to account for the possibility of the original infecting organism being cleared. It is possible that pathogens detected in the case NPS may be cleared before an ALRI episode, or be acquired subsequently to NPS collection; however, a subanalysis of case NPS collected within 7 days of the ALRI episode identified HAdV trends consistent with the main analysis. Here, we investigated a high-risk population for ALRI (80% affected with 49% experiencing multiple ALRI episodes in the first 2 years of life), making us question the suitability of controls from this cohort. Whilst we attempted to prevent misclassification bias using strict criteria for control NPS specimens, the high background rate of pathogen-positive NPS and the design element that allowed case and control NPS to be sought from the same set of children, may bias the results towards the null hypothesis. Furthermore, the cross-sectional design limits conclusions that can be confidently drawn since our study was not designed to detect the contribution of new strain acquisitions of bacteria or viruses to ALRI onset, which is important in other respiratory disorders [30], and is an area requiring further investigation in this population with high rates of respiratory bacterial colonization.",
