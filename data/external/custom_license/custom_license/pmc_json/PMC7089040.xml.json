This dangerous virus has caused significant economic losses to the pig farming industry all around the world. In 1971, PEDV was first identified in Europe (Cheesy and Cartwright 1978; Pensaert and De Bouck 1978) and then the outbreak of the disease became more and more problematic in many other countries around the world, such as the Czech Republic, Hungary, Korea, Japan, China, Italy, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Thailand (Song et al. 2015). Coronavirus spike (S) protein is a surface antigen (type I membrane glycoprotein composing 1383\u20131386 amino acids long) that are cleaved by furin-like proteases in the producer cell at the junction of the receptor binding (S1) and the membrane fusion subunit (S2) (Cavanagh 1983; Frana et al. 1985) even if most coronavirus-like PEDV and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS) carry noncleaved S proteins upon release (Xiao et al. 2003). The S protein plays targetedortant role in regulating interactions with specific host cell receptor glycoproteins to mediate viral entry and is targeted for neutralizing antibodies in the host (Duarte and Laude 1994; Song and Park 2012). S1D (residues 636\u2013789), a second neutralizing epitope of the S glycoprotein of PEDV has been proven to be a suitable candidate for development of a recombinant vaccine against PEDV (Huy et al. 2016; Sun et al. 2008).",

The CT molecule consists of one A subunit with enzymatic activity and five B subunits with binding activity of the host (Fasano et al. 1991; Merritt et al. 1994). CTB has not only strong adjuvant properties, but also acts as a carrier, allowing the fusion antigen to traverse the mucosal barrier and thus improve antigen immunogenicity (Holmgren et al. 1993, 2003; Wu and Russell 1998; Yu and Langridge 2001). The expression of CTB fusion protein in chloroplasts has been shown to result in correct assembling to pentamer structure with conserved antigen domain (Davoodi-Semiromi et al. 2010; Ruhlman et al. 2007; Sixma et al. 1991).",

The chloroplast expression system has been increasingly used as a platform for the production of high amounts of therapeutic proteins such as enzymes, antibodies and recombinant vaccines (Daniell 2006; Daniell et al. 2005; Molina et al. 2004; Ruhlman et al. 2007). Indeed, human therapeutic protein (> 7% TSP), CTB (46% TSP), a magainin 2 analogue peptide (21% TSP) and many other recombinant pharmaceutical proteins were successfully expressed in chloroplasts, at several times higher yields than a nuclear targeted expression (Daniell et al. 2001b; DeGray et al. 2001; Staub et al. 2000). In most plant species, the chloroplast genome is derived from the cytoplasm, which is less likely to spread the gene through cross-pollination with wild relatives (Daniell 2006; Daniell et al. 2005). In addition, the chloroplast expression system showed several advantages such as the ability to express polycistrons, lacking the gene silencing by the \u201cpositional effect\u201d of the transgene in the genome, which is an issue in nuclear transformation. Also, the expression of vaccine proteins in non-edible tobacco plants could be an advantage as it is isolated from a food stuff.",

To link T7g10 5\u2032UTR and S1D, the fragment of S1D was released by BamHI/SacI digestion from pMYV8076 plasmid containing the S1D in the other plant expression vector and then subcloned into the intermediate vector pTKC1, resulting in pMYV8077. The T7g10 5\u2032UTR-S1D DNA fragment digested from pMYV8077 was subcloned into tobacco chloroplast expression vector, pMYV532 to form pMYV8080 (Fig. 1). Essentially, the pMYV532 was modified from the tobacco-based chloroplast backbone vector which was kindly provided by Dr. H Daniell (University of Pensylvania, US) to insert the genes of choice. Briefly, the aminoglycoside 3\u2032 adenyltransferase (aadA) gene controlled by 16 s rRNA (Prrn) promoter and psbA terminator were inserted between trnI and trnA flanking sequences. To construct CTB-S1D fusion gene in the chloroplast expression vector, the coding sequence of CTB from pMYV8073 were digested with BamHI restriction enzyme and subcloned into pMYV8077 to align with CTB between the T7g10. 5\u2032UTR and S1D. The correct orientation of CTB was confirmed by PCR and DNA sequence analysis. The fragment of T7g10 5\u2032UTR-CTB-S1D was then inserted into pMYV532 to generate chloroplast expression vector pMYV8083 (Fig. 1).",

For chloroplast transformation, the leaf tissues (approximately 2 cm \u00d7 2 cm) excised from the mature tobacco plant were placed abaxial side up, on the RMOP shoot regeneration medium [Basic, MS salt, plus 0.1 ml \u03b1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA 1 mg/ml in 0.1 M NaOH), 1 ml 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP, 1 mg/ml in 0.1 M HCl), the 0.1 g Myo-inositol, 30 g sucrose, pH 5.8, with 1 M KOH, 7 g agar] for 1 day before performing transformations. The gold particles were coated with DNA plasmids pMYV8088 or pMYV8083 for the expression of S1D and CTB-S1D, respectively. The complexes of particle/DNA were incubated on ice for 3 min before centrifuging for 1 min to remove the supernatant. The Eppendorf centrifuge tubes containing the particle/DNA were dipped into an ultrasonic cleaner three times for 1 s each. The DNA-coated microcarriers were suspended by brief vortexing and then applied for transformation. The bombardment was conducted by the Biolistic PDS-1000/He Particle Delivery System (Bio-Rad, US) as described by the manufacturers. Briefly, the leaf tissues were bombarded twice at the 6 cm distance. After 3 days incubation on the same medium, the tobacco leaves were cut into small pieces (approximately 0.5 cm2) and transferred to selection RMOP medium supplemented with 500 mg/l spectinomycin dihydrochloride for the first round selection. The putative transformed shoots developed from the antibiotics resistant leaf tissues were rooted in the MS agar medium containing 500 mg/l of spectinomycin to develop into whole plantlet. The leaf tissues derived from the first generation plants were subjected to a second round of selection with 1000 mg/l spectinomycin and then the process was repeated until third round screening to obtain homoplastic lines.",

Spreading to the U.S., Canada, and Mexico in 2013 and 2014 occurred with significant genetic diversity (Vlasova et al. 2014). The annual economic loss in these countries has been estimated at approximately $900 million to $1.8 billion (Paarlberg 2014). This emerging and re-emerging swine virus epidemic requires an effective and inexpensive vaccine. As one possibility, a plant-based mucosal vaccine could be highly advantageous, as it could be administered in a crude form by feeding pigs, without expensive downstream processes such as a purification and cold chain.",

The CT produced by Vibrio cholera is one of the most efficient known enterocyte-targeting molecules and is a typical representative of the heteromultimeric A-B toxins. The CT molecule consists of one A subunit with enzymatic activity and five B subunits with binding activity of the host. CTB is composed of five identical polypeptides (11.5 kDa each), which are assembled into a highly stable pentameric ring structure within the bacterium. CTB binds selectively to the glycosphingolipid receptor GM1-ganglioside on the intestinal epithelial cell surface. CTB was shown to function as an effective carrier and adjuvant molecule for genetically linked antigen proteins, including autoantigens and vaccine antigens. The plant-derived CTB fusion antigens are a good choice for the induction of immune response with a low amount of antigen. It has been previously demonstrated that CTB fusion protein in plant induced serum and intestinal antibodies after oral immunization (Yu and Langridge 2001). The delivery of plant-derived CTB fusion antigens into the mucosal immune system in mice has been shown previously (Kim et al. 2013). Furthermore, the native and recombinant CTB subunit was properly assembled into functional oligomers in transgenic chloroplasts (Daniell et al. 2005; DeGray et al. 2001; Ruhlman et al. 2007).",

            "text": "Transgenic plants have many advantages such as cost-effectiveness, good safety profile and ease of storage. However, lower levels of antigen expression in transforming plants may be insufficient to induce oral immune response against pathogens (Tien et al. 2017). Efforts to enhance the expression levels of recombinant proteins in cells and plant tissues have focused on using strong and tissue-specific promoters, codon-optimized genes and especially targeting recombinant proteins into specific organelles such as chloroplast (Daniell et al. 2001a; Lessard et al. 2002; Park et al. 2004). The chloroplast expression system has many advantages such as no transgene silencing, no position effect and high level expression of foreign protein (Daniell 2006). Therefore, chloroplast was considered a good choice host for increasing protein expression levels in transgenes. One of the approaches for increasing recombinant protein accumulation in chloroplast is boosting translation by using 5\u2032 untranslated leader sequence (Rasala et al. 2011). Using the 5\u2032-untranslated sequence from alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV) increased the expression levels of human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) recombinant protein in chloroplast by 5.5 times compared to construct without the 5\u2032-untranslated leader (Sandhu et al. 1999). Additionally, the 5\u2032-untranslated leader sequence of tobacco mosaic virus RNA, potato virus X (PVX) RNA, rice seed storage-protein genes or bacteriophage T7g10 has also been shown to be effective in increasing transgenic protein expression level (Li et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2010; Staub et al. 2000; Yang et al. 2013). In particular, the 5\u2032 UTR of T7g10 has been shown to be very effective in enhancing the high-level expression of target proteins (Inka Borchers et al. 2012; Kuroda and Maliga 2001; Yang et al. 2013).",

            "text": "The expression level of Maligaderived antigen protein is of highest relevance for determining the dose of antigen that can be delivered within protein-containing plant material. Thus, the improving expression level is necessary for developing plant-based vaccines. In this study, we have successfully improved the expression level of the CTB-S1D fusion protein in the chloroplast expression system using 5\u2032 untranslated region of the bacteriophage T7 gene 10 (T7g10. 5\u2032UTR) for regulation of gene expression. The bacteriophage T7g10 is not only suitable for high-level of protein production, but also the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence of T7g10. 5\u2032UTR may be an efficient mediator of translation initiation in plastid (Yang et al. 2013). The chloroplast-derived CTB-S1D fusion protein displayed biological function of a pentameric structure that could bind to GM1-ganglioside, a receptor of CTB. This result showed that the target CTB-S1D fusion protein is properly folded and the antigen binding site is conserved. Other studies have shown similar results, using either the native or recombinant CTB subunit expressed in transgenic chloroplasts (Daniell et al. 2005; DeGray et al. 2001; Ruhlman et al. 2007). The pentameric CTB-fusion protein was expressed in approximately 1.4% of TSP, which is nearly three times higher than their expression in N. benthamiana, which was estimated to be up to 0.07% of TSP (Huy et al. 2016). Furthermore, the production of CTB fusion S1D in chloroplast was 20 or 40 times higher than S1D alone expressed in stable chloroplast and transient expression in tobacco, respectively (Huy et al. 2016). This result suggested the chloroplast-derived CTB-S1D fusion protein could be considered a promising oral vaccine candidate for the prevention of enteropathogenic PEDV infection in swine and future studies will address its immunogenic potential in mice.",
