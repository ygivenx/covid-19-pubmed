Although all age groups of pigs are susceptible to TGEV infection, the mortality rate can reach as high as 100% in seronegative suckling piglets. TGEV is a pleomorphic enveloped virus with a positive-stranded RNA genome that consists of four structural proteins: the spike (S) protein, the integral membrane (M) protein, the minor envelope (E) protein, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein [1]. Among these, the surface protein S, also an integral membrane protein, is the major host target for generating neutralizing antibodies to the virus. The binding of the S protein to the cellular receptor, porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN), mediates the attachment of viruses to host cells before cell invasion [2]. The TGEV S gene encodes a 1,447-amino acid precursor polypeptide containing a 16-residue signal peptide and a hydrophobic region near the C-terminus that maybe involved in anchoring the S protein to the viral envelope [3].",

Our results indicate that the rS-AD not only induces specific antibodies recognizing TGEV-infected eukaryotic cells, but can interfere with cell infection by the virus.

G. Herrler and C. Schwegmann-Wessels) [7]. The relative positions of the four antigenic sites in the S protein of TGEV and location of the cloned gene bearing antigenic sites A and D are shown in Fig. 1. The primers contained EcoRI and SalI sites (underlined), respectively, to facilitate cloning. The PCR reaction (25 \u03bcl) consisted of 1 \u03bcg template, 50 pmol of each primer, 200 \u03bcM dNTPs, 1.25 U ExTaq polymerase (TaKaRa, China), and 1\u00d7 PCR buffer.

The purified PCR product was cloned into the EcoRI:SalI site of pET-30a (Novagen, USA). The resulting recombinant plasmid, designated pET-S-AD, was purified with a commercially available kit (KeyGen Biotech, China) and verified by sequencing.\n",

After washing extensively in PBS, the cells were cultured with serum-free DMEM. The non-antibody-treated TGEV-infected and mock-infected ST cells were used as controls. After 2 days, the cells were subjected to triple freezing and thawing followed by pelleting and resuspension in sterile water. The resulting suspension was subjected to RNA extraction using a commercially available kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. qRT-PCR was used to amplify a small portion of the 3\u2032-region of the S gene, an intervening sequence, and the 3a gene (designated S-X; 192 bp) using sense 5\u2032-GGCTTAGTAGTAATATTTTGCATAC and anti-sense 5\u2032-ATTATAGCAGATGATAGAATTAACA primers. The housekeeping gene beta-actin (208 bp) was also amplified by qRT-PCR as an internal reference using sense and antisense primers 5\u2032-GGCTCAGAGCAAGAGAGGTATCC and 5\u2032-GGTCTCAAACATGATCTGAGTCATCT, respectively [12]. All amplifications were performed using a RT-PCR kit (TaKaRa, Japan) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The PCR profile for amplification of TGEV-S-X gene began with 95\u00b0C for 10 min followed by 30 cycles of 94\u00b0C for l min, 48\u00b0C for 1 min, and 72\u00b0C for l min. There was a final extension at 72\u00b0C for l0 min. Amplification of beta-actin was performed as described for the S-X gene except that the annealing temperature was 58.8\u00b0C. The PCR products were separated on a 1% agarose gel. Quantification of the gene amplification was performed using the gel documentation system (Uvitec, Cambridge, UK) and determined with Gel Analyzer software (Copyright 2010 by Dr. Istvan Lazar) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions [13].",

The results showed that when viral particles pretreated with increasing amounts of antibody were used to infect ST cells, the amount of viral RNA extracted and amplified from cell lysates decreased in a dose-dependent manner as the amount of antibody used to pretreat the virus increased showing nearly complete inhibition at a 1/16 dilution of antibody (Fig. 5).\n\n",

            "text": "Among the key structural proteins of TGEV, the S protein has received particular attention because it is associated with several important biological functions of the virus such as pathogenicity and cell fusion. Most importantly, the host immune system efficiently recognizes this S protein and produces neutralizing antibodies capable of interfering with recognition and infection of the cell by the virus. Four antigenic sites (A, B, C, and D) have been defined by competition among monoclonal antibodies that target these sections of the protein. Prior study has shown that antigenic sites A and D are predominantly responsible for inducing neutralizing host antibodies [14]. The full-length S protein was previously expressed using E. coli [15], vaccinia virus [16], and adenovirus [17]; however, TGEV-neutralizing antibodies were only elicited with protein generated from recombinant virus. Inasmuch as the S protein is a glycoprotein, the lack of glycosylation in the prokaryotic expression system may have accounted for the absence of neutralizing antibodies. Nevertheless, prokaryotic expression systems have advantages in protein production, manipulation, convenience, and production costs [18]. Heterologous proteins have been expressed successfully in prokaryotic vectors for generating antibodies, neutralizing viruses, or analyzing protein function [19\u201321].",

In our study, we chose to focus only on those sites within the S protein responsible for inducing neutralizing antibodies in the hope of obviating some of the short comings from working with the full-length protein in a prokaryotic system. As expected, our cloned gene fragment generated a high level of the rS-AD protein. This peptide was tested both as an inhibitor of virus infectivity by preventing binding to the cell as well as an immunogen to generate rabbit polyclonal antibodies for obviating viral attachment to ST cells. The antibodies did indeed recognize TGEV-infected cells, indicating that antigenic sites other than those dependent upon glycosylation are present within the A and D regions. In addition, we confirmed that the polyclonal antibodies reacted with transiently expressed full-length S protein via Western Blots. The possibility of using this protein to develop specific monoclonal antibodies is under investigation.",

Plaque reduction assays clearly showed that inhibition of viral infection approached 100% relative to negative controls. Recently, we also demonstrated that pre-incubation of recombinant S1 protein from avian bronchitis virus with TGEV was unable to inhibit cell infection by TGEV [22] offering further evidence that the phenomenon observed here was specific. As a note added in proof, we also tested the antibodies against other strains of the virus with similar levels of success (data not shown). In the presumed absence of glycosylation, our data suggest that the primary and/or secondary sequence of the truncated rS-AD are capable of inhibiting cell binding to the A and D regions of the viral S protein when cells are pretreated with recombinant protein. It is interesting to consider whether or not other truncated constructs involving A, B, C, and/or D might have similar blocking effects observed here. Inasmuch as antigenic sites A and D are proximally positioned within the N-terminal region of the S protein, it is possible that the rS-AD may also contain one or more important receptor binding domains.",
