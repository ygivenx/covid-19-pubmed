Failure to control excessive inflammation and/or neutrophil activation results in exaggerated lung and systemic inflammation that leads to severe disease [4\u2022\u2022]. The immune response in CAP may vary as different microbes may trigger different inflammatory responses depending on their intrinsic properties [5\u2022\u2022]. The clinical outcome in CAP is not only determined by the causal agent, interaction between the immune response and pathogen clearance is extremely important. The balance of this interaction is regulated through complex interactions between immune cells and pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines [6\u2022\u2022].",

It is well known that the cytokine storm is present in severe CAP. In addition, it is appealing that adjuvant therapy targeted to regulate the immune response could be useful in these cases. Glucocorticoids and other treatments have been used as immunomodulators, but to date, none of these treatments have been licensed for this purpose [7\u2022]. Thus, the focus of this review is on recent findings (from 2012 to date) regarding the systemic and local cytokine environment and their possible implications during CAP in the severity of lung infection. In addition, co-adjuvant therapies will be analyzed in this review that may represent an area of opportunity for therapeutic re-direction of CAP.",

In the pre-antibiotic era, Streptococcus pneumoniae caused 95 % of pneumonia cases for which an etiology was found. Because new diagnostic tools are now available, the identification of other microorganisms is currently easier and has changed previous thinking regarding the causes of CAP. Most of the information we have obtained is from moderate to severe CAP patients who needed hospital care. Numerous viruses and bacteria are responsible for CAP. Infection can be caused by a single microorganism, but co-infection is also possible. Recent studies showed that respiratory viruses are the main cause. Among bacteria, S. pneumoniae remained the most commonly identified cause of CAP, but it represented only a minority of the patients [9\u2022\u2022]. A meta-analysis also found respiratory viruses, particularly influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), as a common cause of CAP in 15 to 54 % of hospitalized adults [10\u2022\u2022]. Co-infection with viruses and bacteria was found in 4 to 30 % in that report (Table 1).\n",

The diagnosis of CAP can be more challenging in some specific groups, such as those who are elderly or those with comorbidities or immunosuppression states, in which the characteristic presentation of CAP is not present. Because empirical therapy is mainly based on the severity of the disease, extensive diagnostic testing is not a standard of care and the responsible agent is not identified in most patients. Extensive diagnostic testing seems to be more useful in those patients who present with severe CAP, and in which the results of the tests may lead to individualized therapy [2\u2022\u2022, 8\u2022\u2022, 11].",

CURB 65 is based on five simple parameters: confusion, urea, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and age. CURB 65 stratifies patients according to the risk of death, which leads to further management: higher risk requires more aggressive interventions. APACHE II and SOFA are mainly used in critically ill patients. The other scales mentioned are not particularly useful in CAP patient evaluation.

Influenza A virus (IAV) infection is the most common cause of pneumonia-related death in the developed world and mortality attributable to IAV infection can be much higher during pandemics. Currently available agents to treat IAV infection, including oseltamivir and zanamivir, inhibit viral NA. Therefore, they are most effective at limiting viral replication in the early stages of infection and in immunocompromised patients and are less effective once an antiviral innate immune response is established. The presence of viral RNA in the cytosol activates three major intracellular immune pathways that initiate the innate immune response toward the virus: retinoic acid inducible gene-1 (RIG-1) proteins, Toll-like receptors (TLRs; primarily TLR3 and TLR7), and inflammasome. Binding of viral RNA to helicase domains on RIG-1 triggers its interaction with mitochondria-associated antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), which induces the generation of type I and III interferons (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN-\u03bb) and activates the pro-inflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB. Replication of the influenza virus replication critically depends on cellular NF-\u03baB activity and NF-\u03baB is a crucial pro-inflammatory signaling module, suggesting that strategies to inhibit the NF-\u03baB pathway may be suitable for intervention. Finally, GM-CSF is an important mediator of antiviral host defense and a factor promoting repair of the alveolar epithelium [32\u2022\u2022].",

This finding indicated the central role of IgM in preventing uncontrolled inflammatory response and mortality.

Corticosteroids can switch off genes that encode pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6 and IL-8) and switch on genes that encode anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-10). However, the use of steroids also exerts an influence on the immune function of different host defenses against bacteria when high dosages and prolonged treatment are used [47\u2022\u2022]. Most of the corticosteroid studies in CAP have focused on clinical outcomes more than on the role of the cytokines. A meta-analysis did not find a benefit with the inclusion of corticosteroids in the treatment of CAP in adults.

Statins are known to down-regulate cytokines and transcription factors that are abnormally increased during sepsis. Several in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that statins reduce the levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, NF-\u03baB, and C-reactive protein. These effects inhibit the up-regulation of cytokines and potentially decrease inflammation and immune dysfunction. As a consequence, statins may decrease the severity of symptoms associated with sepsis [55]. A meta-analysis performed in 2013 included 28 studies and revealed an association between statins and the risk and mortality of CAP. However, the results constitute very low quality evidence, based on the GRADE framework, due to the observational study design, heterogeneity, and publication bias. Given the biological plausibility of these findings and the high burden and mortality of CAP, the meta-analysis results warranted additional and better-designed studies to define the utility of statins in CAP [56]. A recent multicenter, double blind, randomized clinical trial studied rosuvastatin versus a placebo in patients with sepsis-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome with 70 % of the cases due to pneumonia. Patients did not improve clinical outcomes with rosuvastatin but may have contributed to a higher degree of hepatic and renal dysfunction [57\u2022].",
