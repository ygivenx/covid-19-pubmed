In recent years, detailed electronic surveillance of infectious diseases has become widespread owing to the advent of improved computing, electronic data management, the ability to share and deposit data over the internet, and rapid diagnostic tests and genetic sequence analysis. These ongoing developments have increased the application of mathematical models to both the generation and testing of basic scientific hypotheses and the design of practical strategies for disease control. Mathematical analyses and models have successfully explained previously puzzling observations and played a central part in public health strategies in many countries3,4.",

In the absence of reliable data, mathematics can be used to help formulate hypotheses, inform data-collection strategies and determine sample sizes, which can permit discrimination of competing hypotheses. In this way, mathematics is \u201cno more, but no less, than a way of thinking clearly about the problem in hand\u201d (Ref. 5). The extent and quality of available data can be variable. Ideally, data should be analysed using models that adequately describe the observed dynamics and patterns of interest, and the mechanisms that generate these observations. Models should be as simple as possible, but not so simple that the conclusions drawn are altered by the consideration of additional realistic complexity. Unnecessary complexity can obscure fundamental results and is almost as undesirable as over-simplification. Indeed, model choice \u2014 the process of deciding which model complexities are necessary \u2014 is a central part of mathematical modelling of infectious diseases.",

In some cases, the environmental component of infectiousness can result in an unusually large number of secondary infections. For example, the 'superspreading' event that led to various secondary severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) infections among residents of the Amoy Gardens estate in Hong Kong in 2003 was the result of unusual environmental conditions and airflow dynamics that spread the virus through aerosolized faeces11.",

The number of secondary infections depends on the infectiousness of the index case over time \u03c4 since they themselves became infected. We represent this quantity by a function that is denoted \u03b2(\u03c4).

For example, \u03b2(\u03c4) might be the product of biological infectiousness (Fig. 1) and contact rates.

Individuals can be categorized by any factors that are considered to be important for infectious disease transmission and can be labelled i = 1,2,...n (n denotes the number of different categories of individuals; Diekmann and Heesterbeek13 refer to these as h-states). In a randomly mixing population, the offspring distribution is derived from the mixture of the distributions for each individual, weighted according to their frequency. For example, the susceptible\u2013infected\u2013recovered (SIR) model assumes a constant infectivity \u03b2 while an individual remains infected and a constant rate of recovery from infection \u03b1 such that the time that is spent infectious is exponentially distributed20. Infectious individuals can therefore be categorized by their infectious period, and summing over the distribution of infectious periods provides an offspring distribution that follows a geometric distribution with mean R0 = \u03b2/\u03b1 (a mixture of Poisson distributions with exponentially distributed means). This distribution is highly skew and over-dispersed compared with the Poisson distribution (the variance is more than the mean). Therefore, the stochastic SIR model shows considerable variability between individuals in their contribution to transmission.",

A second approach is to track infectious individuals who have known times of infection and observe subsequent transmission events within defined risk groups30. Such an approach has been followed, for example, for HIV-1 (Ref. 33) and SARS15. Care needs to be taken to account for immunity of contacts to infection, to adjust for the fact that transmission events are not usually observed, but rather some surrogate of infection is recorded (such as symptoms or microbiological diagnosis) and for censored observations (when individuals cannot be followed up for a particular reason or have not completed their infectious period).",

For infections such as intestinal nematodes, flukes, filarial nematodes and tapeworms, usually referred to as macroparasites, this process of super-infection results in an aggregated distribution of the parasites among the host population and enables sexual reproduction of the parasite.

Within a household, all susceptible individuals could become infected following the initial infection event and the potential for further transmission of disease is therefore restricted, despite the ongoing infectiousness of household members. This can complicate estimation of the generation-time distribution for an infectious disease.

The intrinsic non-linear dynamics of endemic infections can be simple and predictable, or complex and unpredictable, depending on the natural history of the infection and the host immune response (oscillations in disease incidence often occur, such as those demonstrated for syphilis in the United States68). Seasonal variation in transmission can further complicate patterns of incidence; for example, increases in seasonal variation in transmission are associated with a higher number of years between epidemics69. The interaction of seasonality, non-linear dynamics and stochasticity can lead to very complicated dynamics70,71,72, which can make the interpretation of infectious disease surveillance data a difficult task, with transient dynamics not necessarily reflecting underlying trends.

Inevitably, there will be an element of subjectivity in the choice of model, and in some cases the model might need to be revised in the light of new observations, which would lead to an iterative process of model development. The ability of a model to explain data can be formally assessed using methods for statistical inference. These can be categorized into three broad approaches: frequentist, Bayesian and information theoretic (reviewed in Refs 73,74,75). All three approaches are based on different uses of the concept of likelihood. The likelihood of a model based on an observed set of data is proportional to the probability of the observed data if that model is true, the constant of proportionality being arbitrary. Likelihood can be used to estimate parameters and compare models. In particular, likelihood is a key measure in deciding whether additional complexity in model structure is warranted in terms of improving our ability to describe data. The exact comparison will depend on the inference framework (for measures such as the likelihood ratio, the Akaike and Bayesian information criteria73,74,75), but all these methods balance the gain in likelihood that is achieved by extending a model with the increase in the number of parameters that are needed to describe that model.",

A formal starting point for defining a likelihood for a time series of observations of an infectious disease system could therefore be a stochastic model that predicts the distribution of the number of people in different states at different times. The sources of stochasticity could arise from the transmission process itself (the offspring distribution) and from the observation or sampling process. Infection events depend on prevalent infectious cases, which, in turn, depend on earlier infection events, as clearly shown by the renewal equation (Equation 3). Therefore, all observations in an epidemic time series are correlated and should be viewed as part of a single observation of the epidemic process. For example, random effects that occur early in an epidemic, when the number of infections is small, significantly affect subsequent epidemic spread and can lead to different epidemic dynamics for the same underlying parameters (Fig. 3d). For this reason, repeated and possibly incomplete observations of independent epidemics are often easier to assess than detailed, but temporally correlated data, from a single epidemic. The difficulty of dealing with temporally correlated data is that, even for small epidemics, the likelihood can be difficult to write down and thus calculate for a given model and data. Several exact and approximate approaches have been reviewed in Refs 76, 77. In particular, Bayesian methods are beginning to result in progress in this area, by treating unknown events, such as individual infection times, as random variables to be estimated.",

In such models, if the state variables, such as the number of susceptible individuals, are known at a point in time, then incidence over the next time step is an independent random variable76,78.

Many 'laws' of infectious disease epidemiology, such as mass action or the relationship between the average age at infection and the basic reproduction number, rely to some extent on the assumption of random infectious contacts among individuals in a population. Non-random mixing leads to local saturation effects that can undermine these laws and lead to more complex epidemics that have a range of implications for control. Mathematical descriptions of non-random mixing need to go beyond simply dividing the population into discrete compartments to a more complete representation of the contact patterns that lead to infectious disease transmission. Computer simulations could provide insights, but the development of analytical approximations of the contact process would be far more powerful if they could provide simple rules (and predictions) for the emergent dynamics of an epidemic. This might require a different type of mathematical model and language, perhaps motivated by ongoing research into network or graph theory61.",

The dynamics of these other infections are, in turn, mutually interdependent, which further complicates the analysis. An understanding of these dynamics and their underlying determinants could be made easier by comparative analysis across different settings and time periods that differ only in a small number of variables.
