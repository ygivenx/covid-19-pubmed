Recent studies have indicated that respiratory viral infections may precede pulmonary exacerbations in children and adults with CF [2, 3]. Traditionally, nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples have been the specimens of choice for diagnosing respiratory virus infections using isolation methods, direct fluorescent antibody detection and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR offers increased sensitivity, specificity, and a rapid turnaround time; in a multiplex format, it facilitates the detection of RNA or DNA from several viruses in a single reaction.",

Pooled sputum from CF patients shown to be negative for these viruses or seeded with known virus served as controls. Associations were sought between virus status and continuous variables (i.e., age, lung function, inpatient days) using the t-test and between virus status and dichotomous variables (i.e., gender, concomitant conditions, presence of pathogens) using the chi-square test or, for small numbers, Fisher\u2019s exact test.

Four of the seven patients who tested positive for Flu A or Flu B in the present study had been vaccinated in the current year, but it is not known if they had seroconverted. A recent Cochrane review found no randomised trials examining the benefit of influenza vaccination for patients with CF [15]. Further study is needed before definitive conclusions may be reached.",

However, studies comparing the rates of virus detection in CF sputum using the RT-PCR-ELAHA with those achieved using conventional methods of virus isolation and serology from NPA or BAL will be needed to confirm the sensitivity of the assay for this application. Clarification of the role of respiratory viruses in the clinical course of CF infection has assumed increased importance with the advent of new antiviral agents for pulmonary infections. The availability of a rapid and sensitive diagnostic test for the detection of multiple common viruses would greatly facilitate these investigations. Assuming the importance of viral infections is established, the incorporation of this assay into clinical management programs has the potential to reduce morbidity and enhance the survival of CF patients.",
