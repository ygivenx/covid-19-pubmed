In that study, the attack rate was 4.6% in persons who had contact with a probable SARS case-patient during the symptomatic period and lived in the same residence (which included some persons who visited or cared for a SARS patient). These findings are in contrast to the high attack rate seen in the healthcare setting (6). One possible explanation for this difference is the phase of the illness. SARS case-patients in the household tend to be in the early phase of illness whereas SARS case-patients in the healthcare settings tend to be in the later phase. In addition, coexisting conditions and invasive procedures done within the hospital setting may also influence risk of transmitting disease (7).",

This knowledge will also enable public health officers to develop a more sensitive and responsive surveillance system. As the expected attack rate is known, healthcare professionals can be prepared early if the observed attack rate in the households is higher than predicted, allowing rational rather than empirical implementation of public health measures and justify rapid and aggressive investigative and containment measures needed to prevent a large outbreak. These considerations are particularly important for countries with limited healthcare and fiscal resources. In Singapore, we learned the usefulness of educating persons on the need and means of doing daily temperature monitoring, to have a centralized temperature recording database for hospital staff and patients so that a cluster of fevers could be spotted early, to evaluate symptomatic hospital staff in designated hospital clinics, and to trace contacts by using many resources including the police and army. The authorities in Hong Kong did not have the benefit of this information as little was known then about SARS. Perhaps in the future, such knowledge will help prevent another situation similar to that seen in Amoy Gardens, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (8).",

This was independent of length of exposure or demographics. The reason for this finding was not evident from the data available. A difference in social behavior between healthcare worker and nonhealthcare worker is a possible explanation for this disparity in risks of household transmission. For example, healthcare workers may be more acutely aware of the risk of acquiring and transmitting SARS and may alter hygiene practices at home. In addition, better health and disease prevention knowledge may influence the efficacy of such practices. Qualitative differences in social behavior between healthcare worker and nonhealthcare worker should be investigated, as this knowledge may be useful in containing future SARS outbreaks.",
