CVB had been implicated in childhood myocarditis by the end of the 1950s. Since then, six CVB serotypes (CVB1-6) have been shown to cause not only myocarditis but also a wide variety of human diseases, including common colds, cardiomyopathy, diabetes, neurological disorders, and inflammation [1\u20134]. Numerous outbreaks of CVB infections have been noted at the community level, but only Coxsackie virus B5 (CVB5) is known to have caused widespread nationwide epidemics in the United States, particularly in 1961, 1972, and 1983 [5]. Moreover, CVB5 is associated with several human diseases, including encephalitis and myocarditis in immunocompromised children and CNS disease in older adults.",

Until now, there has been no enterovirus-specific vaccine or therapeutic reagent available for clinical use [6], although some reports have presented effective candidates for CVB3 in a murine model [1, 7, 8]. A great number of picornavirus replication inhibitors have been described in vitro, but few of them have shown effectiveness in vivo [9], and none has been approved for clinical use. Gancyclovir and cidofovir have been studied in myocarditis caused by cytomegalovirus in mice [10], but there is no evidence that it also works for enterovirus-induced myocarditis. Acyclovir has been successfully used to treat myocarditis associated with Epstein-Barr virus [11, 12] and varicella [13], but there are no reports demonstrating that acyclovir is effective in CVB myocarditis.",

Its chemical name is ethyl-6-bromo-4-[(dimethylamino)-methyl]-5-hydroxy-1-methyl-2-[(phenylthio) methyl]-indole-3-carboxylate hydrochloride monohydrate. Arbidol was first found to have wide-spectrum antiviral activity against human influenza virus. It was shown to inhibit the reproduction of rimantadine-resistant human influenza virus A, avian viruses H5N1 and H9N2, and influenza viruses B and C [14]. In many studies, Arbidol also exhibited broad and potent antiviral activity against a number of viruses including respiratory syncytial virus [15], adenovirus [16], parainfluenza virus type 5, rhinovirus type 14, avian coronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus and Marek disease virus [17], hepatitis B virus [18], and hepatitis C virus [19]. In our previous study, Arbidol showed broad-spectrum antiviral activity against a number of respiratory viruses, including FLU-A, RSV, HRV 14, and CVB3 in vitro [20]. The extensive list of Arbidol-sensitive viruses includes RNA and DNA viruses, enveloped and non-enveloped viruses, and pH-dependent and -independent viruses, emphasizing a broad spectrum of Arbidol antiviral activity. At the same time, the wide spectrum of Arbidol\u2019s activity suggests that Arbidol targets common critical step(s) in virus\u2013cell interaction. In this study, we systematically investigated the antiviral activity of Arbidol against CVB5 in vitro and in vivo.",

Briefly, HEp-2 cells were seeded at 2 \u00d7 104 cells per well in 96-well plates and grown to subconfluence. After removal of the growth medium, serial twofold dilutions of the compound in 200 \u03bcl test medium were added. At each dilution, four wells were infected with 100 TCID50/0.1 ml of virus, while four wells were left uninfected for toxicity determination. The same dose of Arbidol was added to the plate daily, since its half-life in cultured cells is about 18 h [23]. The plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C, and the development of cytopathic effect (CPE) was monitored daily by light microscopy until the virus-infected, untreated cells showed CPE up to 80%. At this time point, the culture medium was removed and 25 \u03bcl of the MTT solution (5 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline, PBS) was added to each well. The plate was further incubated for 4 h to allow MTT formazan formation. After removal of the supernatant, 50 \u03bcl of DMSO was added for solubilization of formazan crystals, which were homogenized on a microplate shaker for 15 min. The optical densities (ODs) were then read using a microplate spectrophotometer at double wavelengths of 540 and 690 nm. Results were expressed as a percentage of OD value of treated cell cultures with respect to untreated ones. All data were analyzed with SPSS 11.5, and the 50% cytotoxic (CC50) and 50% inhibitory (IC50) concentrations of the agent were determined. Thus, the therapeutic index (TI) for the compound was also determined from CC50/IC50. Each dilution was tested in triplicate, and in each set of experiments, three control wells without drug were included.",

Like other enteroviruses, CVB is a small RNA virus that replicates at 37\u00b0C, lacks a lipid envelope, and is stable at acid pH. When primarily cultured HEp-2 cells infected with CVB3 were treated with Arbidol by different methods, arbidol was found to present potent antiviral activity against CVB5 when added before and after infection. In a virucidal assay, Arbidol exhibited a strong effect against CVB5, and inhibited the CPE of CVB5 on HEp-2 cells with a TI of 27.56, which is higher than other treatments. Those data suggested that Arbidol had a strong antiviral effect against CVB5 during the adsorption step. We also cocultured HEp-2 cells with different doses of Arbidol after infection to study whether it still had an antiviral effect after virus entry into the host cell. The MTT assay showed that Arbidol had inhibitory activity against CVB5, with an IC50 of 6.62 \u03bcg/ml and a TI of 12.45 (see Table 1). Semiquantitative RT-PCR data suggested that Arbidol prevented the synthesis of CVB5 RNA in a dose-dependent manner. In short, our data demonstrate that Arbidol can induce durable antiviral activity in host cells, not only blocking the adsorption of viral particles onto cells but also inhibiting the late stage of the viral replication cycle.",

Mice infected with CVB5 had some symptoms of circulatory failure such as cyanosis and lack of blood perfusion in the tail and auricle, and there was evidence of virus replication in the heart and lungs. Pathological findings were consistent with the results from virus isolation, and all viral control mice died by day 18 after infection. Thus, CVB5 infection in BALB/c mice is a suitable in vivo model to study in vivo antiviral activity.",
