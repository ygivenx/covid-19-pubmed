Infection with HIV-1 is characterized by an acute primary phase during which patients exhibit a wide range of flu-like symptoms over a 2- to 3-week period.[13] Seroconversion typically follows this period, marking the end of the pre-seroconversion window. However, incubation times may vary widely, from a few days up to 3 months, and seroconversion may occur between 1 and 10 weeks.[14] A long-term asymptomatic phase that is characteristic of latent or low-level persistent infection typically follows seroconversion.[15] Estimates of residual risk among US blood donors (e.g. the probability that a donor is donating during the pre-seroconversion window) suggest a dramatic decrease since the introduction of donor HIV protocols in 1985,[16] from approximately 1 per 50 000 donors to <1 per 500 000 donors.",

The ability to analyze the partitioning of pathogens through the tracking of defined markers created new opportunities to design fractionation and purification processes with pathogen safety as a primary consideration.[25,26] Moreover, the systematic detection of HBsAg provided the foundation for the development of screening and quality control strategies designed to improve the quality of plasma prior to the production of derivatives.[27]",

High levels of empty virus particles, in addition to high titers of intact, infectious virus particles, means that the detection of surface antigen is generally an effective measure for the interdiction of donations from donors in the acute phase of infection.[28] Initial efforts to develop and implement screening tests involved multiple technology platforms. However, only a few could satisfy the operational requirements associated with the screening of whole blood and plasma units. Assays that rely on solid-phase immunochemistry for the detection of HBsAg, such as the RIA and ELISA, gained early favor over more traditional assays that included complement fixation and counterimmunodiffusion methods.[29] Currently, several test systems from different manufacturers are licensed by the US FDA for use in donor screening and confirmatory testing.[12,30] The approval of more sensitive test systems is pending.[31] Although the incidence of HBV infections varies significantly worldwide, representative studies of US volunteer blood donors indicate an infection rate of 1 per 63 000 donors.[20]",

Public and political pressures heightened the sense of urgency to close the infectious window beyond what had been achieved through the implementation of anti-HIV antibody screening.[32] However, ambiguities surrounding the outcome of several large clinical studies instilled a sense of uncertainty about the potential benefits associated with p24-antigen screening.[33,34] Despite the doubts about the utility of p24-antigen testing in the field, the FDA adopted p24-antigen screening as an interim measure to facilitate an expanded donor HIV screening protocol.[32,35] However, other regional regulatory agencies, most notably those associated with Europe and Japan, declined to adopt this protocol. Because the safety benefit associated with the implementation of this expanded protocol has been generally perceived as marginal, the replacement of the p24-antigen test with more effective screening technology has been an industry and a regulatory goal. The recent licensure of a number of NAT testing systems specific for the detection of HIV-1 RNA has provided the opportunity to eliminate p24-antigen testing from the donor HIV screening protocol.[36,37]",

NAT methods typically combine nucleic acid hybridization with amplification technologies, driven either enzymatically or chemically, to achieve highly sensitive detection of specific nucleic acids. The PCR is the earliest and the most widely recognized method that has been applied to the detection of limited quantities of viral nucleic acids.[39,40] However, other methods offer alternative technology platforms with similar performance specifications for the amplification of nucleic acid targets. These systems include transcription mediated amplification (TMA),[41] nucleic acid sequence based amplification (NASBA),[42] thermophilic strand-displacement amplification (tSDA),[43] ligase chain reaction (LCR),[44] and branched DNA assay (bDNA).[45] When coupled with efficient nucleic acid isolation methods, any of these technologies could provide a foundation for a highly efficient high-throughput testing platform.",

Because the vast majority of samples are negative, pooling strategies greatly enhance operational efficiency by reducing the number of test samples, thus, effectively increasing throughput. The utilization of fluorescent or chemiluminescent detection chemistries with NAT methods facilitates process consolidation and reduces assay time. Additionally, probe-specific detection and target differentiation facilitate the multiplexing of assays thereby increasing the array of targets while reducing the number of tests performed.

These NAT methods enhance the margin of safety of blood and plasma products by allowing the detection of viral pathogens earlier in the window period than can be achieved using current antigen and antibody tests. For example, the window period for HIV-1 associated with antibody assays is approximately 22 days.[14] The HIV-1 p24-antigen assay reduces the window period to 16 days.[56] The application of NAT assays for HIV-1 RNA further reduces the window period to between 7 and 11 days,[57,58] depending on the pooling strategy employed. In the US, the implementation of licensed HIV-1 NAT assays allows for a reduction in testing redundancies through the discontinuation of p24-antigen testing.

In accordance with regulatory requirements, viral validation studies are performed to estimate the overall level of virus reduction across manufacturing processes. During these studies, known amounts of virus are deliberately added (spiked) into production intermediates and the materials are treated according to manufacturing specifications, using bench-scale models of the production process. Virus reduction is calculated by comparing the level of virus infectivity remaining at the end of the process with the level in the starting material. Since most manufacturing processes consist of multiple steps, challenging the system with virus at the beginning of a process and sampling the final product is not practical. Such a strategy would require massive amounts of virus, something that is difficult to obtain. As a result, individual steps of a process are usually evaluated. Breaking down the process into individual steps is not only technically more reasonable, but it also allows for more accurate characterization of the conditions critical for viral reduction and a better understanding of the mechanisms for viral clearance.",

Adding numerous steps with low individual reduction factors or adding steps that share the same mechanism of virus clearance may overestimate the virus reduction capacity of a process. An effective step is one that clears at least 4 log10 units of virus (i.e. a 10 000-fold reduction in titer) and a robust step is one that clears virus regardless of variability in production parameters. In general, a single effective and robust step provides more assurance of viral safety than several steps with the same overall log reduction. Most regulatory authorities recommend incorporating at least two effective steps with unrelated clearance mechanisms in each manufacturing process and at least one of the steps should be effective against non-enveloped viruses.[59]",

In contrast, immunoglobulins, which are derived from Fraction II+III, undergo an additional precipitation step (Fraction III) that not only purifies product but also removes >4 log10 of some model non-enveloped and >3 log10 of some model enveloped viruses.[61] It must be emphasized that fractionation steps are not effective against all viruses and that HCV was transmitted by immunoglobulins that were manufactured by a process that relied entirely on fractionation to remove virus.

Nanofiltration can be performed under relatively mild physiologic conditions (pressure, pH, osmolarity, and temperature) and does not require stabilizers or other chemical agents. As a result, the biologic integrity of a product is not compromised and adverse biologic and immunologic reactions are not induced.[73] Nanofiltration, in theory, is limited only by pore size, so the smaller the pore, the smaller the viruses that are retained. However, size-based exclusion applies to plasma proteins as well as to viruses, and currently only the smallest plasma products pass easily through the filters. As nanofiltration technology improves, it is reasonable to expect the availability of membranes capable of separating viruses as small as parvovirus from proteins as large as IgG or FVIII.",

Blumel et al.[80] confirmed the resistance of PPV during albumin pasteurization but also reported that parvovirus B19, unlike the model animal virus, was inactivated after heating for only 10 minutes. These results indicate that the model virus, PPV, is more resistant to heat treatment than parvovirus B19 and suggest the effectiveness of pasteurization to inactivate both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses in albumin. However, pasteurization in the presence of sucrose was less effective against non-enveloped viruses, as Reovirus reduction was only 1.0 log10. Similarly, a recent report of parvovirus B19 transmission by a pasteurized immunoglobulin, in the presence of stabilizers, indicates that heating in solution may not be effective in eliminating high concentrations of non-enveloped viruses such as parvovirus B19.[81]",

            "text": "One of the best studied processes for prion clearance is the Cohn-Oncley fractionation. The general methodology of this process (see section 2.2.1) is to lower the temperature of plasma, increase the alcohol concentration, and make pH adjustments to selectively precipitate classes of proteins. A number of laboratories have investigated the inherent ability of the Cohn-Oncley process to remove spiked prion protein and infectivity.[114,115,127,131\u2013134] Cryoseparation and Fraction I separation yield Factor VIII/vWB and Fibrinogen/Factor IX, respectively (figure 1). These two plasma intermediates have the highest protein concentrations, and the clearance of spiked prions is \u22641 log10. Following the Fraction I separation is the Fraction II+III separation, which is the first significant prion removal step. The effect of 20% (volume/volume) alcohol combined with low temperature and centrifugation results in \u22654.7 log10 of removal of PrPSc with respect to the effluent.[61] This suggests that prions can be precipitated or aggregated using specific solution-state conditions. The Fraction II+III clearance is clearly beneficial for the downstream products (\u03b11-antitrypsin, plasma protein fraction, and albumin) in the Cohn-Oncley process. However, this removal is not in favor of the immunoglobulin product, as the prion spike copurifies with the Fraction II+III paste, which is the starting material for the IVIG process. Fortunately, there are steps during immunoglobulin purification that significantly clear spiked prions from the immunoglobulin product. For example, the Fraction III separation relies on solution conditions that maintain the solubility of IgGs in 17% alcohol at low temperatures while precipitating the prions, which are removed (\u22484 log10) using centrifugal sedimentation.",

Typically, hamster 263K, which is a PrPSc strain derived from sheep scrapie, is used in clearance studies. However, it is important to establish hamster scrapie as a valid model for the partitioning of human prions. A comparative study of the partitioning of human, sheep, and hamster forms of PrPSc was conducted.[125] Three plasma purification steps were chosen that demonstrated low (cryoseparation, about 1 log10), intermediate (3% PEG precipitation, 2\u20133 log10), and high (11.5% PEG precipitation, 3 log10) clearance of PrPSc in the hamster scrapie spike model. In brief, it was found that PrPSc derived from vCJD, classical CJD, sporadic CJD, or Gerstmann Str\u00e4ussler Sheinker disease human brain tissue partitioned quantitatively similarly to PrPSc derived from sheep or hamster scrapie.[133] These data indicate that in the case of biochemical separations, hamster scrapie can be used to predict the partitioning of human and other species of prions.",

However, these steps are effective against some but not all virus families. Therefore, it is important to validate each of these steps for its viral clearance capacity. For enveloped viruses, robust clearance steps are available for nearly all of the products examined (table IV). Therefore, it can be predicted with confidence that emerging enveloped viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), monkeypox, and West Nile virus are likely to be reduced significantly during manufacturing processes.
