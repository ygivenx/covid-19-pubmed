There are two genotypes/serotypes of FCoV: FCoV has been classified into types I and II based on the amino acid sequence of its S protein [10, 19]. Type II FCoV was previously suggested to be produced by recombination between type I FCoV and type II canine coronavirus (CCoV) [7, 31]. Separate from these genotypes/serotypes, FCoV has been classified into two biotypes: weakly pathogenic feline enteric coronavirus (FECV; low-virulent FCoV) and strongly pathogenic feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV; virulent FCoV) [20]. The etiology of the pathogenesis of FECV/FIPV has not yet been elucidated in detail. Two theories currently exist: an \u201cinternal mutation theory\u201d and a \u201ccirculating virulent/avirulent theory\u201d [1, 3, 21]. FIPV causes a fatal disease called FIP in wild and domestic cats [20]. Although antiviral agents and vaccines against FIPV infection have been investigated, no method has yet been established for practical use.",

However, type II FCoV is mainly used in studies on FIP because the propagation of type I FCoV in feline cell lines and monocytes/macrophages is weaker than that of type II FCoV. Although recombinant type I FCoV has recently been prepared by reverse genetics [30], studies on type I FCoV have not progressed. Differences have been identified in the following events between types I and II FCoV: replicative ability in cell lines and monocytes/macrophages [29], the amino acid sequence and immunogenicity of the S protein [10, 19], and the virus receptor used to enter cells [4, 8]. However, differences in other events remain unclear, and the virus receptor for type I FCoV has not yet been identified.",

For example, host cell cholesterol levels have been shown to influence the replication of human hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus, and dengue virus [14, 17, 36], but not that of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) [13, 22]. Furthermore, cholesterol contained in the envelope of influenza virus has been shown to affect infection of cells [27]. Cholesterol contained in host cells was previously reported to be involved in host cell infection by mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [5, 33], which, like FCoV both belong to the family Coronaviridae. Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and type II CCoV infections involve cellular and viral cholesterol [23, 25]. The S protein of type II FCoV is homologous to those of TGEV and type II CCoV, and the infection of cells by type II FCoV was previously shown to be only slightly influenced by cholesterol [35]. On the other hand, the relationship between type I FCoV and cholesterol remains to be investigated.",

However, exogenous cholesterol restored the number of plaques caused by these viruses in a dose-dependent manner. When 0.5 mg of exogenous cholesterol per ml was added, the number of plaques caused by FCoV-I Black and FCoV-I UCD-1 was significantly higher than without treatment with M\u03b2CD and exogenous cholesterol. In contrast, cellular cholesterol depletion and replenishment only slightly affected the number of plaques caused by FCoV-II 79-1146. In order to determine the amount of FCoV released into the supernatant of cholesterol-depleted and -replenished cells, we measured virus titers in culture supernatants using the TCID50 assay. The titers of FCoV-I KU-2, FCoV-I Black, and FCoV-I UCD-1 in the supernatant of M\u03b2CD-treated cells were significantly decreased by approximately 100-fold (Fig. 4B), and exogenous cholesterol restored the titers of these viruses in a dose-dependent manner.

We investigated the expression of viral proteins in order to further investigate the effects of cholesterol on FCoV infectivity. The N protein levels of FCoV-I KU-2 specifically decreased in fcwf-4 cells treated with 16 mM M\u03b2CD (Fig. 5). The N protein levels of fcwf-4 cells treated with 16 mM M\u03b2CD, followed by the addition of 0.5 mg of exogenous cholesterol per ml, returned to levels similar to those in untreated-fcwf-4 cells.

This finding demonstrates that type I FCoV needs to be examined in more detail in studies on the prevention and treatment of feline FCoV infection. However, no study using type I FCoV has been conducted to date because the propagation of type I FCoV in feline cell lines is low. Type II FCoV uses feline aminopeptidase N (fAPN) as a receptor [8, 34], and infection of cells with this virus has been studied in detail. In contrast, the virus receptor for type I FCoV has not been identified, and the mechanism underlying cell infection has not yet been elucidated. Therefore, a basic analysis of type I FCoV is needed for the development of effective antiviral drugs against type I FCoV, which is prevalent in the field. In the present study, we discovered that the dependence of the infection on cholesterol differs between types I and II FCoV. We recently reported that the rate of inhibition of viral replication by a viroporin inhibitor differed between types I and II FCoV [28]. Based on these findings, it is desirable to use type I FCoV, in addition to type II FCoV, for the development of effective antiviral drugs.",

Based on this hypothesis, type I FCoV might enter cells using fAPN and a cofactor (coreceptor). MHV fuses with the cell membrane, utilizing cholesterol after binding to carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM), and enters cells using cholesterol in the absence of CEACAM [33]. Cholesterol may also function as an essential cofactor in type I FCoV infection. Furthermore, the envelope cholesterol of type I FCoV has been suggested to be involved in infection, as shown in Figure 7. Further investigations are needed in order to determine whether the envelope cholesterol of type I FCoV plays an important role in cell infection.",
