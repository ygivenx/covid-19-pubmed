They compared the findings in those with radiologically confirmed CAP to an ambulatory control population without respiratory tract infection and to a hospitalised population with non-pneumonic lower respiratory tract infection (NPLRTI). The frequency of viral CAP was 31.7 % of 183 patients, compared with 7.1 % of 450 controls and 51.7 % of 201 patients with NPLRTI. The frequency of viral CAP was put into context by demonstrating that viruses were even more common in patients with NPLRTIs and that the frequency of a positive test was significantly lower but not zero in controls, implying that some patients are colonised without becoming ill. Remarkably, in our cohort, patients with VP had a different clinical presentation and a lower inflammatory response as measured by biomarkers.",
