As per protocol, both the prone and supine groups were subjected to the same mean airway pressures (MAP) and tidal volumes even after it was noted that the PaO2:FiO2 had improved in the prone group and they could be managed with lower MAP [4]. Gattinoni responded to our criticism of his study and conceded that, in retrospect, our approach of reducing ventilation as oxygenation improved was more appropriate [4].",

The stated rationale for the new study by the PROSEVA Study Group of Guerin and colleagues, in severe acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) [5], was the meta-analysis data showing improved survival with prone position in patients with severe hypoxemic ARDS. The authors overcame the drawback of the older studies by targeting the a tidal volume of 6 ml per kilogram and the PEEP level selected from a PEEP-FiO2 table and they have demonstrated a survival advantage for prone ventilation. However, analysis stratified according to quartile of PaO2:FiO2 ratio at enrollment showed no significant differences in outcome in this study.",

The authors do not acknowledge our previous communications in the literature. We point to more than a matter of priority in science, which is important in itself. Our findings suggest that prone ventilation may be beneficial in reducing ventilator-induced lung injury in all ventilated patients and this needs to be investigated in a wider context.",
