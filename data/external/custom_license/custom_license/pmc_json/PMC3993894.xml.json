Indeed, heroin abuse is a significant\nproblem that incurs large social and economic costs worldwide.1,2 Alarmingly, the number of heroin users in the U.S. has grown by\n50% from 2002 to 2010.3 Furthermore, since\n2007 the number of deaths due to heroin overdose has also increased.4 Due to the severity of heroin addiction, there\nis a dire need for anti-heroin addiction treatments that are more\neffective than currently available pharmacological agents (e.g., methadone,\nbuprenorphine, and naltrexone). The first report of a working heroin\nvaccine was disclosed in 1974,5 however,\nfurther research on heroin immunopharmacotherapy has only been conducted\nin the past decade.6,7 Previously, we reported the design\nof a heroin\u2013KLH (keyhole limpet hemocyanin) immunoconjugate\n(Figure 1) that showed ample promise in combination\nwith alum adjuvant as a vaccine against heroin addiction.8 As a testament to the vaccine\u2019s efficacy,\nimmunization of heroin-dependent rats prevented relapse to compulsive\nintake of heroin in self-administration models.9 Herein, we sought to further improve our vaccine\u2019s\nperformance through injection route and adjuvant exploration.",

Interestingly, no study to date\nhas investigated injection route of small molecule conjugate vaccines.\nIn addition to administration route, adjuvants can also impact vaccine\nperformance. In this capacity, TLR agonists could play an important\nrole in vaccine design with their ability to modulate immune responses.\nFor example, CpG ODN acts as a pathogen associated molecular pattern\n(PAMP) to stimulate the innate immune receptor TLR9.10 A specific CpG ODN, CpG 1826 (Figure 1), is a member of \u201cB-class\u201d ODNs which activate B-cell\nimmune responses.11 Impressively, vaccine\ntrials engaging a specific CpG ODN sequence (#1826) in combination\nwith alum have demonstrated its ability to safely enhance IgG antibody\ntiters against the target antigen in mice.12\u221215 Furthermore, many phase I and\nII clinical trials have investigated B-type CpG ODNs as vaccine adjuvants\nagainst hepatitis B,16 malaria,17 pneumonia,18 melanoma,19 and lymphoma.20 Results\nfrom most clinical studies demonstrate CpG ODN efficacy in enhancing\nimmunity to the target antigen while displaying a favorable safety\nprofile. Additionally, this adjuvant is inexpensive, stable, readily\nobtainable and can be easily manipulated for vaccine formulation.\nCpG ODN 1826 therefore holds promise as an adjunct to our heroin vaccine\n\u201ccocktail\u201d as a means of further potentiating opioid-neutralizing\nantibodies.",
