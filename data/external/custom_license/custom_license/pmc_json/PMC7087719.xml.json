This is partly due to greater awareness of morbillivirus epizootics in cetaceans and pinnipeds throughout the world\u2019s oceans. Morbilliviruses, single-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the Paramyxoviridae family, have caused several major epizootics with high mortality in many pinniped species since 1987 (Kennedy-Stoskopf 2001). In addition to morbilliviruses, other viral infections have been reported to cause a number of diseases in pinnipeds, such as adenoviruses, vesiviruses, and coronaviruses.",

The virus was identified in stranded California sea lion livers (Zalophus californianus) with hepatitis (Britt et al. 1979; Dierauf et al. 1981). A novel adenovirus, otarine adenovirus type 1 (OtAV1), was recently associated with viral hepatitis and endothelial cell infection in the same species (Goldstein et al. 2011). Vesiviruses are small single-stranded RNA viruses, from the family Caliciviridae, first isolated in California sea lions from San Miguel Island in 1972. The virus was named San Miguel sea lion virus (SMSLV) (Smith et al. 1973). It causes vesicular lesions in the mouth and flippers of pinnipeds (Smith et al. 1983) and has been suggested as the possible cause of epizootic gastroenteritis reported in California sea lions in 2009 (Schmitt et al. 2009). Coronaviruses (family Coronaviridae) have also been reported in pinnipeds. These are positive single-stranded RNA viruses that have been associated with acute necrotizing enteritis in harbor seals (Bossart and Shwartz 1990).",

Given that these areas are densely populated with humans and that these animals often haul out on beaches, there is the potential for contact between seals and people (IBGE 2010). Thus, knowledge of pathogens that may circulate in these animals is crucial (Smith et al. 2006). The present study aimed to detect the presence of circovirus, adenovirus, morbillivirus, vesivirus, and coronavirus nucleic acid in feces from two species of fur seals (A. australis and A. tropicalis) along the southern coast of Brazil.",

The stage of decomposition of all carcasses was Geraci code 2 (Geraci and Lounsbury 1993). Fecal samples were collected from 21 South American fur seals (A. australis) and two Subantarctic fur seals (A. tropicalis). The coastal area of approximately 300 km where the animals were found is located between the cities of Torres (coordinates: 29\u00b020\u203231\u2033S, 49\u00b043\u203247\u2033W) and Mostardas (coordinates: 31\u00b06\u203225\u2033S, 50\u00b055\u203215\u2033W), Rio Grande do Sul State, Southern Brazil (Fig. 1). The area was monitored weekly for pinnipeds and other marine animals on shore. Fecal samples were collected from the intestine using sterile collection materials, kept on ice, sent to the laboratory, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. At the time of processing, samples were thawed and approximately 5 g of fecal material were resuspended in 10 mL of Hank\u2019s balanced salt solution (HBSS, pH 7.2). The slurry was removed by pelleting at 10.000\u00d7g for 10 min. The supernatants were sequentially transferred to fresh tubes, and DNA and RNA were extracted.\n",

Some of the assays used were designed to detect specific animal viruses and may therefore have been unable to detect distinct and new strains of viruses within Coronaviridae and Caliciviridae. It is also important to note that RNA is generally less stable than DNA and more susceptible to degradation, decreasing the potential for recovering good quality RNA for testing. Thus, further studies using broader assays would be needed to confirm the absence of coronavirus, morbillivirus, and vesivirus in these samples.",
