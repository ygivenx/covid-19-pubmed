In the United States, adults and children less than 5 years experience ~1.5\u20133.0 and 3.5\u20135.5 respiratory illnesses per year, respectively (Monto and Sullivan 1993). Viruses account for up to 69 % of all respiratory infections. These include illnesses caused by influenza viruses (A and B), rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human parainfluenza viruses (1\u20134), human coronaviruses (severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2014SARS, 229E, and OC43), adenoviruses (primarily serotypes 4 and 7), and Coxsackievirus A21 (Monto and Sullivan 1993; Couch 1995; Boone and Gerba 2007). Viruses are particularly significant as etiologic agents of respiratory infections in the young and the elderly (Klein 2004). In pediatric respiratory units, adenoviral infections can be devastating; the fatality rate in hospital-acquired cases is 91 %. The hands of hospital attendants are believed to spread the virus (Sattar et al. 2000).",

            "text": "Few respiratory viruses are transmitted by one route only (Gwaltney et al. 1978; Brankston et al. 2007). Respiratory viruses may be spread by direct contact (person-to-person), the airborne route via droplets, or by indirect contact (via hands and/or fomites) (Goldmann 2000; Barker et al. 2001; Brankston et al. 2007). Some respiratory viruses irritate the respiratory epithelium and induce coughing and sneezing, thereby facilitating their transmission by not only the airborne route, but also by environmental contamination with the generated aerosols/droplets (Hall et al. 1980; Barker et al. 2001; Boone and Gerba 2007). The primary route of transmission is at times difficult to determine and is often a point of contention among researchers. In addition, unusual circumstances or conditions may lead to an atypical route of transmission for respiratory viruses. For instance, environmental contamination by stools played a significant role in the transmission of SARS coronavirus in certain outbreak populations in China (Dowell et al. 2004; Chu et al. 2005; Thomas et al. 2008).",

In contrast, the recovery of PV1 from strawberries was only 0.06 %, demonstrating that virus recoveries from different types of produce can vary significantly. Similarly, the recovery efficiency of CoV229E from lettuce was 19.6 %, whereas the virus was not recovered from strawberries. Such differences between the recoveries of viruses from berries versus lettuce are likely due to the fact that fruits such as strawberries and raspberries have a porous surface texture which may trap viruses beyond the reach of chemical disinfectants or eluents (Richards 2001). Alternatively, the elution process itself may cause damage to the surfaces of soft fruits, resulting in greater virus retention. The low pH of fruits, which are typically below those of vegetables, may also affect the sorption of viruses to the produce surface and therefore their recovery. The pH of strawberries is 3.0\u20133.9, raspberries is 2.9\u20133.5, and iceberg lettuce is ~6.0 (Martin-Diana et al. 2005; Roberts et al. 2005a, b). Basic buffers (pH 7.4\u20139.5) are recommended as eluents to extract viruses from acidic fruits in order to prevent a drop in the pH of the eluent during the elution process which may reduce virus recovery (Croci et al. 2008). Le Guyader et al. (2004) reported that detecting viruses on berries, particularly raspberries, is difficult because of the presence of various inhibitors as well as the low pH. Butot et al. (2007) found recovery efficiencies of 1.99, 0.42, and 1.1 % of hepatitis A virus, norovirus, and rotavirus, respectively, from fresh strawberries, and similarly low efficiencies of 2.3, 3.1, and 1.3 % for these three viruses, respectively, from frozen raspberries.",

Strawberry producers also recommend not washing berries until just before serving, and to avoid contact with moisture (e.g., misters) in the food market. Such moisture causes rapid breakdown of the berries. Raspberries are very perishable and should always be kept between 0 and 1 \u00b0C. Under ideal conditions, strawberries should have a shelf-life of 2\u20135 days and raspberries should have a shelf-life of 1\u20132 days in the consumer\u2019s refrigerator. In the virus survival experiments, the produce samples were stored in covered bottles to avoid evaporation of the inoculum volume during storage; however, the fruits started to deteriorate before day 10 due to the excess moisture. Raspberry deterioration was much more pronounced than that observed with strawberries. For this reason, the survival of PV1 and CoV229E on raspberries was not determined.",

            "text": "The results of this study demonstrate that respiratory viruses may persist on fresh fruit and vegetables for several days at the refrigeration temperature commonly used to store fresh produce in the average consumer household. Contamination of fresh produce may therefore result in the transmission of not only the enteric viruses that are traditionally considered \u201cfoodborne\u201d pathogens, but also possibly respiratory viruses such as adenoviruses, coronaviruses, and influenza viruses that can infect via contact with mucosal membranes. Considering the low infectious dose of many viral agents, there will always be a risk of infection from the exposure to or consumption of food contaminated with respiratory or enteric viruses if no regular preventive produce surface sanitization is performed. This is of particular concern for uncooked fruits and vegetables. In addition, food handlers that are ill with respiratory rather than non-gastrointestinal disease could still pose a potential health risk for food consumers, particularly while preparing \u201cfinger foods\u201d that come into contact with the consumers\u2019 hands which can then transfer the viruses to the mucosa via hand to mouth contact or by rubbing the eyes or nose (Hendley et al. 1973; Goldmann 2000). The World Health Organization has highlighted the importance of hygiene, particularly that of hands, in minimizing the spread of respiratory tract infections (Hendley et al. 1973; Rusin et al. 2002; Bell 2006). Numerous respiratory viruses can survive on hands for significant periods of time and may be transferred from hands to fomites (such as produce) and back again (Hall et al. 1980; Ansari et al. 1991; Morens and Rash 1995; Barker et al. 2001). In addition, some respiratory coronaviruses (e.g., SARS coronavirus) and adenoviruses are also capable of replication in the gut and there is thus the potential for acquisition through the consumption of contaminated produce.",
