            "text": "Leguminous plants elaborate a range of proteins with diverse bioactivities. Protease inhibitor is listed as one type of these bioactive proteins having been researched by a number of investigators. Besides inhibiting the activity of protease, protein inhibitors of serine including trypsin and chymotrypsin concurrently demonstrated additional biological activities. For example, HIV protease inhibitors and SARS coronavirus proteinase inhibitors may be used to fight against HIV and SARS virus, respectively [1]. Plant protease inhibitors may be involved in the regulation of programmed cell death in plants. They show insecticidal and antifungal activities, but can also cause inhalant and food allergies [2, 3]. Epidemiological evidence suggests that a diet rich in legumes reduces the incidence of cancer and that this may be due to the presence of protease inhibitors [4]. Both in vivo antitumor and in vitro antiproliferative activities of trypsin inhibitors have been reported [5].",

Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitors have a molecular mass of about 20 kDa, a low cysteine content and a single reactive site, while Bowman\u2013Birk trypsin inhibitors are approximately 8 kDa in size and possess a high cysteine content and two reactive sites [6, 7]. The conformation of Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitors is mainly \u03b2 sheet with a small amount of regular sheet. The insecticidal activity of Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitors has been demonstrated using transgenic plants [8]. Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitors also inhibit other enzymes, such as chymotrypsin, \u03b1-amylase, and human plasmin, and block the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin [3]. The Yellow soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) produced both Bowman\u2013Birk and Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitors [9]. The formation, degradation, and gene expression of Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitor in the soy bean have also been reported [3]. The seeds of bitter gourds, sponge gourds, wax gourds, and M. cochinchinensis produce squash-type trypsin inhibitors with a molecular mass of about 3 kDa [10].",

Antifungal proteins have captured the attention of a number of researchers on account of their important economic potential in protecting crops from invading fungi. Antifungal proteins may also contribute to the defense of a plant against predators such as insects [11] as well as pathogens such as fungi [12, 13]. It is well recognized that there is a wide diversity of antifungal proteins produced by leguminous plants. Some of these proteins and peptides have been classified into different groups based on their structure and/or functions [14]. Combinations of antifungal proteins may be found in a single species of bean; for example, in addition to a protease inhibitor, a lysozyme and a nonspecific lipid transfer protein were isolated from Mung bean (Vigna radiata), and all have fungal inhibition activity [12, 13, 15].",

It inhibits mycelial growth in several fungal species, like some of the previously reported antifungal proteins [2, 13, 15, 21, 22]. The existence of trypsin inhibitors with antifungal activity might represent a selective advantage against a wide range of potential pathogens activity. Plant protease inhibitors show antifungal activities; instead, they are just listed as inhalant allergies and also food allergies. It deduces that a combination of antifungal proteins is present in this variety of plants and that they work together to defend against the attacks from invading pathogens such as disease-causing fungi.",
