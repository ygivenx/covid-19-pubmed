Their protective efficacies are encouraging because they provide proof that a SARS-CoV vaccine is feasible. However, vaccines based on those technologies are not licensed for human use, and recommendation and licensing will likely take many years. We have developed an inactivated virus vaccine that induces neutralizing antibodies and protects against SARS-CoV challenge.",

AY310120) was grown in Vero cells, inactivated with \u03b2-propiolactone (BPL), and complete inactivation was confirmed by 2 consecutive passages on Vero cells. Inactivated virus was purified by column chromatography followed by sucrose gradient centrifugation. The fraction containing virus was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline pH 7.2, and total protein content was determined by using the Micro BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL, USA). Immunogenicity of the vaccine was tested by immunizing BALB/c mice at 0, 2, and 4 weeks with 5 \u03bcg of inactivated virus combined with the adjuvant MF59, an oil squalene-in-water emulsion (6) approved for human use in Europe for an influenza vaccine. Ten days after the third immunization, serum samples were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV spike protein\u2013specific antibodies by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and high titers (1\u20133 \u00d7 104) of anti-SARS-CoV spike immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibodies were detected. IgG subclass determination indicated a predominant Th2-type immune response similar to that observed in BALB/c mice vaccinated with a UV-inactivated SARS-CoV plus alum (7).",

Generally, virus titers peak within 2 days after infection and are cleared within 7 days (8). BALB/c mice were immunized at 0, 2, and 4 weeks with 5 \u03bcg of BPL-inactivated SARS virus with or without the MF59 adjuvant. Mice were also immunized with 4 different control preparations: phosphate-buffered saline, adjuvant MF59 alone, and 5 \u03bcg of BPL inactivated influenza A virus vaccine with or without MF59. Serum samples were collected 2 weeks after each dose, and assayed for their ability to neutralize SARS-CoV (8). After 2 vaccine doses, SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies were detected only in the group of mice immunized with the BPL-inactivated SARS virus vaccine plus MF59 adjuvant (1:91). Two weeks after the third dose, the BPL-inactivated SARS virus vaccine without MF59 induced neutralizing titers of 1:64, while the adjuvanted vaccine elicited neutralizing titers >1:600 (Table).",

Complete protection from virus replication was observed in mice that received the MF59 adjuvanted SARS-CoV vaccine. Immunization with the nonadjuvanted vaccine resulted in complete protection of the upper respiratory tract and a significant reduction (30,000-fold) of viral titers in the lower respiratory tract compared to the control groups.

This may be particularly true for SARS-CoV vaccines since adverse effects have been reported for one animal coronavirus vaccine, feline infectious peritonitis virus (9). Additionally, some in vitro experiments were performed with pseudotyped lentiviruses that expressed the spike glycoprotein derived from SARS-like virus isolated from civets. In these experiments, the presence of antibodies that neutralized most human isolates of SARS-CoV demonstrated enhanced entry into renal epithelial cells (10). In our studies, we did not find enhanced virus replication in the respiratory tract of vaccinated mice upon SARS-CoV challenge. However, since mice are a model of SARS-CoV infection but not disease, the issue of disease enhancement will have to be carefully evaluated if and when an appropriate animal model in which this phenomenon can be demonstrated becomes available.",
