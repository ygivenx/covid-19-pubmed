            "text": "Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are positive-stranded, enveloped RNA viruses classified within the family Coronaviridae (genus, Coronavirus) (Hendley et al., 1972). They are associated mainly with respiratory tract illness but are also involved in enteric and central nervous system diseases (Resta et al., 1985; Murray et al., 1992; Stewart et al., 1992). Until recently only three human coronaviruses were thoroughly studied. Human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) were identified in the 1960s (Hamre and Procknow, 1966) and are well recognized as important pathogens that cause the common cold. A third novel human coronavirus, SARS-CoV, was identified as the causal agent during the 2002\u20132003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Drosten et al., 2003). The increase in research on these viruses soon led to discovery of 2 other human coronaviruses, HCoV-NL63 in the Netherlands and HCoV-HKU1 in China (van der Hoek et al., 2004; Woo et al., 2005) both detected in respiratory tract specimens of patients with lower respiratory tract illnesses. Since July 2003 when the last case of SARS associated with the epidemic was reported only four human coronaviruses are known to continuously circulate in the human population. Results from epidemiological studies have led to the conclusion that these viruses are worldwide distributed and circulate with biennial prevalence (McIntosh et al., 1970; Vabret et al., 2003; van Elden et al., 2004; Chiu et al., 2005; Gerna et al., 2007). However, there are few studies that have described the epidemiological and clinical features of human coronaviruses infection among different populations, such as at-risk children or adults, patients with underlying conditions, those hospitalized, the immunocompromised patients and others, mainly in South America. In the present study, we retrospectively looked for the presence of HCoVs in different populations of Sao Paulo presenting acute respiratory tract infections (ARIs) from 2001 to 2010, to assess the prevalence that HCoVs infections have on different groups of Brazilian patients and to describe the clinical presentation of the ARIs caused by this virus and their circulation trends in Brazil.",

A pancoronavirus RT-PCR assay previously described (Vijgen et al., 2008) with just minor modifications (50 cycles of amplification to 40 and melting temperature from 48 \u00b0C to 50 \u00b0C), was performed in order to detect human and animal coronaviruses in the samples. The amplification of a 251 bp fragment of the polymerase gene was performed using the following primer set: Cor-FW (5\u2032-ACWCARHTVAAYYTNAARTAYGC-3\u2032) and Cor-RV (5\u2032-TCRCAYTTDGGRTARTCCCA-3\u2032). These one-step RT-PCR assays (OneStep RT-PCR kit; QIAGEN) were undertaken in a 50 \u03bcL reaction volume containing 10 \u03bcL RNA-extract, 10 \u03bcL 5x QIAGEN OneStep RT-PCR Buffer, 2 \u03bcL dNTP mix (final concentration of 400 \u03bcM of each dNTP), 1.8 \u03bcL QIAGEN OneStep RT-PCR Enzyme Mix (a combination of Omniscript and Sensiscript reverse transcriptase and Hot- StarTaq DNA polymerase), 4 \u03bcM of each primer, and RNase-free water to 50 \u03bcL. Positive and negative controls were included in each PCR experiment. The reaction was carried out with an initial reverse transcription step at 50 \u00b0C for 30 min, followed by PCR activation at 95 \u00b0C for 15 min, 40 cycles of amplification (30 sec at 94 \u00b0C; 30 sec at 50 \u00b0C; 1 min at 72 \u00b0C), and a final extension step at 72 \u00b0C for 10 min in a VERITI thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).

A pancoronavirus RT-PCR assay is a usefull molecular tool to test for all coronaviruses in a clinical sample. In addition, quick screening for several pathogens in one assay allows the identification of previously unknown coronaviruses. However, the pancoronavirus RT-PCR assay used could have led to some limitations in our study. First, HCoVs subtypes were not identified and the prevalence of our study could be overestimated and/or underestimated once the assay included non specific primers that target all human and animal coronaviruses. Therefore, the use of degenerate primers set in a conventional RT-PCR may enhance detection of coronavirus genome variations, but may also miss samples with less genome copies. To have a better understanding about it and mainly to rule out the possibility of a bias, we sequenced a portion of the coronaviruses positive cases detected in the present study using pancoronavirus primers set. The positive cases detected among hospitalized patients from 2009 to 2010 were sequenced and all samples were confirmed as human coronaviruses (Cabe\u00e7a et al., 2012).",

We demonstrate the presence of HCoVs infection in all studied populations, with a significant prevalence among some at-risk group patients, such as patients under stem cell transplantation program and children with heart diseases. This higher frequency of HCoVs may be related to the functional condition of these patients. On the other hand, a lower prevalence was observed among children from community when compared with our different studied populations. Since the majority of these children presented influenza-like illness instead of common cold symptoms, the clinical pattern can explain this lower frequency among this group of patients. Underlying conditions other than cardiac/transplantation were observed among 20% of coronaviruses-infected patients. This data along with the higher prevalence of coronaviruses-infected cases found in specific at-risk group patients pointed to the relevance of coronaviruses causing respiratory tract illness in patients with comorbidities.",
