However primary cell cultures are often difficult to prepare and only offer limited numbers of cells for study in a limited timespan. Cell lines, as a tool to study glial cell biology, have both advantages and disadvantages in comparison with primary cultures. One major advantage is the unlimited number of cells available for studies, versus the limited number of primary culture cells obtained after the sacrifice of animals for each preparation. Further, the use of a cell line guarantees a single cell type, ensuring that the investigator starts with a pure culture of cells, generally all at the same stage of differentiation. With primary cultures, occasional contaminating cells may be impossible to avoid, and eliminating these contaminating cells often requires additional purification steps. Moreover, isolated primary cultures may show some degrees of heterogeneity with cells at different stages of maturation, whereas cells of a cell line are synchronized. Another major advantage of cell lines is their ease of maintenance in culture. The media on the cells has to be changed about twice per week, and the cells are split into additional flasks when confluence is reached. The culture medium is usually DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, which is readily available and easy to prepare.",

            "text": "However, there are also significant disadvantages of cell lines. Most cell lines differ from primary cell cultures with regard to their ability to differentiate and reach full maturity. Cell lines have a strong tendency to divide, even in culture conditions designed to slow down proliferation and induce differentiation. Also, cell lines retain some degree of plasticity and their properties can change with the number of passages over time. As a result, a cell line can lose the characteristic that is under study, sometime during a course of experiments. Given that it may be difficult to obtain a large number of primary cells, cell lines are a viable option, and sometimes the only option available to study certain aspects of glial cell biology such as molecular biology and signaling pathways. When choosing a cell line, it is imperative for the investigator to continuously monitor the property of interest to be sure that this property is expressed in all the passages used for the study.",

The utility of a given glial cell line is inversely related to the ease of culturing the primary cells. For example primary glial cells such as rat Schwann cells and rat astrocytes are relatively easy to obtain in large numbers and to expand in culture. Therefore cell lines derived from primary cultures of these cells are less critical considering the primary cultures are much easier to maintain and primary cells proliferate easily. However the usefulness of glial cell lines is also species specific. For example although rat and mouse Schwann cells are fairly easy to obtain and expand, human Schwann cells are much more difficult to obtain, culture and expand. Therefore there are many more human Schwann cell lines which have been developed relative to Schwann cells derived from rodent nerves. The ability of a glial cell line to differentiate in a manner similar to the primary cell is critically important. The ultimate differentiation challenge for glial cells derived from primary cultures of oligodendrocytes is to myelinate in vitro or in vivo. Therefore the ability of glial cell lines derived from the myelinating glial cells (oligodendroglia and Schwann cells) to myelinate in vivo or in vitro is documented. Finally methods which have been successfully used to immortalize cells to create new cell lines are documented, and future directions regarding the use and need for new glial cell lines are discussed.\n",

            "text": "The most frequent culture medium suitable for most cell lines is the DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Since the serum component of the media is critical for the successful culture of glial cell lines, a brief comment on nomenclature and use of serum is in order. Animal serum contains a number of undefined growth factors and hormones which greatly affect the health of glial cell lines. Although the term \u201cfetal calf serum\u201d is often used in the scientific literature, technically there is no such entity. The term calf refers to an animal which is already born and is no longer a fetus or fetal. Thus the term \u201cfetal calf\u201d is an oxymoron. The term \u201cfetal calf serum\u201d is ambiguous since one could not determine if the serum was derived from a newborn calf or a fetus. The real issue is not the nomenclature but the composition of the serum. The exact developmental stage at which the serum is obtained will greatly influence the hormone and growth factor profile of the serum. Obviously fetal bovine serum is more difficult to obtain and thus more expensive. However it may be richer in the hormones and growth factors required for good glial cell line growth. On the other hand newborn calf serum is less expensive and although less enriched in growth factors and hormones may still be suitable for glial cell growth. Regardless, age of the fetus (or calf) and the time of the year that the blood is collected will affect how well the serum performs in a particular culture experiment because of the diet of the mother of the fetus or nursing calf or if the calf has started grazing. Therefore, it is usual to buy a small sample of several serum lots, determine which sample is best for glial cell growth, then purchase enough of that lot of serum to complete the experiments. It is critically important to inactivate the complement in the serum prior to using it in culture to avoid complement mediated lysis of the cultured cells. The established protocols for heat inactivation of complement should be followed carefully [3] In particular the inactivation should be carried out at a temperature not greater than 56\u00b0C and not longer than 35 min. It is also important to sterile filter the inactivated serum to remove precipitated material and to freeze it in small aliquots to avoid repeated freeze thaw cycles.",

            "text": "The degree to which a cell line is able to mature in vitro does not predict its capacity to fulfill its normal function in vivo. For example, the capacity of an oligodendrocyte cell line to differentiate in vitro is not correlated to its potential to myelinate upon being grafted into the central nervous system. The method by which the oligodendroglial cell line is obtained largely dictates its ability to myelinate in vivo. For example the CG4 cell line spontaneously arose from a rat primary culture. This cell line in vivo stops proliferating, initiates differentiation and myelinates axons normally. In contrast to the spontaneously arising CG4 cell line, oligodendrocyte cell lines obtained by transformation fail to myelinate axons. The mouse cell line N20.1, immortalized with a SV40 large T antigen, ensheaths axons loosely but never reaches the degree of compaction found in normal myelin. Another mouse cell line Oli-neu, generated by transformation with an oncogene, does not even initiate axon ensheathment upon graft in the demyelinated spinal cord. If the primary use of a cell line is for in vitro studies, its inability to behave normally in vivo may be overlooked. The extent to which an oligodendroglial cell line differentiates may be influenced by the substratum on which it is grown. In contrast to primary oligodendrocytes, oligodendroglial cell lines do not require a polylysine substratum for maintenance. In addition some oligodendroglial cell lines such as OLN-93 do not even need polylysine to reach the membrane-production stage. To date, no systematic study has been carried out to determine the degree to which a polylysine substratum may promote the differentiation of the existing oligodendrocyte cell lines.",

CG4 cells display the properties of normal oligodendrocyte progenitor OPC cells with expression of the early marker A2B5 but not the mature markers galactocerebroside (GalC) and myelin basic protein (MBP).

Similar migration of grafted CG4 cells occurred in the brain of normal newborn rats from the site of injection along axonal tracts. CG4 cells integrated the normal developing white matter along resident oligodendrocyte progenitors and generated myelin [8].",

However, no membrane sheets are visible by staining for GalC or the myelin proteins MBP, PLP and MAG when grown in low serum medium [9]. When cultured in high 10% or low 0.5% fetal bovine serum, the OLN-93 cell line was shown to express a broad range of markers at both molecular and protein levels: chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan NG2, cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (CNP), MOG and MAG [11]. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings showed that OLN-93 cells express mainly delayed-rectifying K + currents in high and low serum concentrations. Functional evidence for the voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.3 obtained by using a selective blocker, confirmed a feature of immature oligodendrocytes. Based on these data, the OLN-93 cell line is at a developmental stage around late pre-oligodendrocyte (immature cell) regardless of serum concentration. However, it remains to be seen whether OLN-93 cells retain the delayed-rectifying K + currents in conditions triggering further differentiation. A more mature phenotype of OLN-93 cells is obtained by incubation with 10 ng/ml CNTF, 15 nM T3 and 5 \u03bcM forskolin which increases cyclic AMP level. This mix of chemicals promoted a fully mature stage characterized by multipolar arborization and an intense production of membrane sheets [10] as illustrated in Fig. 2.\n",

By contrast, OLN-96 cells grown in high serum medium showed a much less branched phenotype, expressed the inducible enzyme nitric oxide synthase, and produced nitric oxide [12]. Inducible nitric oxide synthase expression is a characteristic of immature oligodendrocytes which have little arborization [13]. These data support a functionally differentiated state of OLN-93 cells in low-serum medium in the presence of high level of cyclic AMP.

N20.1 cells retain the expression of MBP and PLP mRNAs, but do not initiate the translation into MBP or PLP proteins [21]. When N20.1 cells are grown at 34\u00b0C or 39\u00b0C, a minority of cells expressed A2B5 with a bipolar shape, and a majority of cells expressed sulfatide (007 and O4 antibodies) and GalC with strong intensity on branched processes.

Oligodendrocyte differentiation is usually defined as increased expression of the mature oligodendrocytic markers O4, GalC and MBP protein, as well as a more complex morphology with membrane production [23]. Using these criteria, transfection of N19 and N20.1 cells with the human transferrin gene triggers further differentiation. Transfection with the rat peripheral myelin protein P0 gene also triggered more differentiation in N20.1 cells, characterized by increased ratio of MBP/GFAP and PLP/GFAP expression [24]. However when N20.1 cells are grown under conditions which should favor differentiation (forskolin to raise cyclic AMP levels and 39\u00b0C which is non-permissive for proliferation), the N20.1 cells assumed an astroglial phenotype with a pronounced increase in GFAP expression [25]. This is in sharp contrast to other oligodendrocyte cell lines such as OLN-93 and Oli-neu, which change to a more differentiated phenotype when cyclic AMP levels are increased. Other differences have been reported between N20.1 cells and primary oligodendrocytes. For example, the sensitivity of either cell type to nitric oxide donors is much different with regard to concentration and mechanism [26, 27].",

Co-culture of N19 and N20.1 cells with cortical neurons in DMEM/F12 medium plus 1% fetal bovine serum at the \u201cdifferentiation\u201d temperature of 39\u00b0C for one week induced dramatic changes in morphology, especially in cells overexpressing transferrin [23], similarly to co-culture with dorsal root ganglion neurons.

Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF-1) and Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF-2) are two diseases in which Schwann cells abnormally divide and form tumors. In NF-1, the absence of RAS-1 inactivating GTPase activating protein, termed neurofibromin, leads to hyperproliferation and tumor formation [43]. In NF-2, the loss of a protein termed merlin leads to Schwann cell tumor formation specifically on acoustic nerves. However, Schwann cells from transgenic mice do not always create the best model system in vitro to understand how Schwann cells are affected in a particular disease. For example, Schwann cells derived from the mouse model of NF-1, knock-out for neurofibromin, fail to proliferate in vitro [44], although Schwann cell proliferation is a hallmark of NF-1. Recent refinements in methodology [45] have allowed the preparation of neurofibromin deficient Schwann cells from single embryos at earlier stages of development. These Schwann cells appear to more faithfully replicate the properties of human NF-1 Schwann cells in that they grow rapidly without axonal contact and retain expression of Schwann cell markers. Given the difficulties of preparing either normal human Schwann cells or Schwann cells from transgenic mice which faithfully mimic human disease, there is a continuing need to create a human Schwann cell line which can be used to understand normal human Schwann cell biology.",

However, Reynolds and Maples [63] discovered that treatment of neuroblastoma cells promotes differentiation into glial or Schwann cells. Following this observation, Tsunamoto and colleagues [47] treated the GOTO cell line with bromodeoxyuridine. The GOTO cell line is derived from a neuroblastoma cell line originally established after 5 years culture of adrenal neuroblastoma from one patient [64]. As a result of bromodeoxyuridine treatment, the GOTO cells become more Schwann-like in that cell growth was suppressed, expression of the glial cell marker S-100 protein was greatly increased, and morphology of the neuroblastoma cells changed to become smaller and more spindle-shaped. The GOTO-derived cell line also expressed myelin-specific proteins to a limited extent [48]. Recently, it has been reported that when GOTO cells differentiate into Schwann-like cells, they express CD44 and localize this molecule to lipid rafts which is characteristic of Schwann cells in culture [65].",

When the transformed cells are co-cultured with dorsal root ganglion neurites, the cells become more fusiform in appearance and send out processes that ensheath groups of neurites both close to the neuronal cell bodies and at some distance from it.

They reported that although all the cell lines expressed myelin-specific proteins at varying levels, none of them was able to myelinate dorsal root ganglion neurites in culture. They concluded that these cell lines may represent an immortalized stage of Schwann cell development prior to myelination, and that these cell lines could be useful for investigating the cell biology of MAG and other myelin-related components. The caveat with these cell lines is that by virtue of the fact that they have been transformed they have become less normal, even if they do represent an arrested stage of the development of Schwann cells.

CHME-5 cells do present a differentiated microglia phenotype. They express CD68 (EBM11), CD11b, FcR, and present a phagocytic activity. CHME-5 cells do not express CD11c, CD14, CD4, as well as the astrocyte marker GFAP nor the neuronal marker neurofilament. CHME-5 cells can be induced to express MHC class II antigens and IL-6 upon stimulation with cytokines. Infection of CHME-5 cells by the human coronavirus OC43 modulated the activity of matrix metalloproteinases 2, 9, and increased nitric oxide production [97], which are features similar to primary microglia. Similarities with primary macrophages were also observed upon infection with HIV-1 virus.

Alternatively, the SV40 large T antigen can be placed under the control of a gene promoter which upon activation will promote the differentiation of a cell line, such as the TSC rat Schwann cell line (metallothionein promoter) and the DI TNC1 rat astrocyte cell line (GFAP promoter).",

For these studies two human oligodendrocyte cell lines are available, HOG and MO3.13, which unfortunately show little potential to differentiate in vitro. HOG and MO3.13 cell lines have never been grafted in vivo, since it does not seem likely that they would stop their intrinsic proliferation and begin myelination. Unfortunately both cell lines are more characteristic of the tumors from which they were derived: the HOG cell line from an oligodendroglioma, and the MO3.13 line obtained by fusion with a tumor rhabdomyosarcoma cell line. There is an urgent need for another human oligodendrocyte cell line that would be closer to the phenotype of a primary cell in its capacity to differentiate in vitro. Ideally, the cell line should have the capacity to differentiate to reach the stage of flat myelin membrane production, as shown by the rodent oligodendrocyte cell lines OLN-93 and Oli-neu when placed in the appropriate culture conditions. Ultimately, a human cell line should be able to myelinate axons, similar to the mouse N20.1 cell line co-cultured with neurons or upon graft in vivo like the rat CG4 cell line.",

A new cell line, BO-1, was established for the first time by spontaneous immortalization from a mouse source using a primary mixed glial culture derived from neonatal mouse pups [100]. The BO-1 line retains a bipotential phenotype: addition of serum causes it to differentiate into astrocytes while in other culture conditions the BO-1 cells express the markers O4, CNP and MBP on a network of processes.

Converting embryonic stem cells into a particular cell type has proven to be a tricky task. The in vitro manipulation of human embryonic stem cells to direct them to oligodendrocyte progenitor cells is delicate and involves numerous steps [101, 102]. The complexity of the procedure renders impractical a routine work for basic research on human oligodendrocytes. More accessible cells, such as human umbilical cord blood cells or human adult blood stem cells, have not yet been successfully differentiated into mature oligodendrocytes in vitro [103\u2013105]. Nevertheless hard won success with human embryonic stem cells has been obtained to generate sufficient oligodendrocyte progenitor cells to begin Phase 1 trials for the use of these cells after spinal cord injury. This oligodendrocyte progenitor cell therapy proved successful in an animal model of spinal cord injury [106]. The success of this trial and subsequent studies should lead to the efficient generation of oligodendrocyte precursors in quantities similar to cell lines sufficient for future cell therapy. Although glial cell lines may not fill the niche as therapeutic agents, they will continue to be useful tools for further understanding the role that glial cells play in the functioning of the much neglected and increasingly important \u201cOther Brain\u201d [1].",
