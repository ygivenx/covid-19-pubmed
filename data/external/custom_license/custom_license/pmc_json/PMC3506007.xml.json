The astrovirus genome has three open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1a encodes the non-structural polyprotein 1a, while the longer ORF1b encodes polyprotein 1b, including the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is expressed through a ribosomal frameshift at the ORF1a/1b junction. ORF2 encodes the viral capsid structural polyprotein [11].",

Astroviruses are reported to cause gastroenteritis in humans and some mammals; however, avian strains have been linked with both intestinal and extraintestinal manifestations [6, 11]. Historically, eight classical human astrovirus genotypes have been described in humans (HAstV1-8). However, a diverse group of novel astroviruses was identified recently in humans (HAstV-MLB and HMOAstV-A through C) whose members were phylogenetically separated by different lineages of animal astroviruses [3, 8]. Studies from the past three years have demonstrated that divergent astroviruses can infect the same animal species, including bats [2, 19], turkeys [4], domestic pigs [10, 13, 15], sea lions [9] and domestic sheep [14]. This means that astroviruses infecting one host species can be highly diverse, with different lineages likely reflecting independent origins. In this situation, continued characterization of astrovirus diversity in different host species will help our understanding of their origin and of their possible cross-species transmission. The presence of astrovirus in wild boars has not been investigated. This study describes the identification and complete genetic characterization of astrovirus in wild boars in Hungary.",

Astroviruses were detected in half of the fecal samples collected from 6- to 8-week-old healthy wild boar piglets. This result indicates the endemic circulation of astrovirus strain WBAstV1/2011/HUN at that farm. Recently, up to five porcine astrovirus (PAstV-1-5) types were described in domestic pigs [10, 13, 15], confirming that, as is the case for humans, viruses of more than one astrovirus lineage/species may exist in the same host species. WBAstV1/2011/HUN was genetically most closely related, especially in ORF1b, to porcine astrovirus 4 (PAstV-4), which was identified from fecal samples of swine in Hungary [13] and the USA [15]. However, the maximum aa homology was only 56% in the ORF2 capsid region, indicating a novel astrovirus serotype. The lower level of homology to ORF2 relative to ORF1 is consistent with the results of other studies and is thought to be the result of strong positive selective pressure on the capsid-coding region from the host immune system [17].",
