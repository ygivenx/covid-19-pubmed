Respiratory specimens were collected from 2 independent groups of mixed-age dromedary camels (Camelus dromedaruis). The first collection was obtained during April 2013\u2013May 2014 at the Al Omran Abattoir, Al Omran City, in Al-Ahsa Province in the eastern region of Saudi Arabia. Livestock slaughtered at this abattoir include cattle, goats, sheep, and camels originating from Al-Ahsa and neighboring provinces. Animals selected for slaughter were mainly from the livestock market and from herds located around Al-Ahsa Province. At the livestock market in Al-Ahsa, dromedary camels are housed in small groups (10\u201315 animals), where they may stay for no more than 4 days. They are then transported in vehicles to the abattoir, where they are kept for no more than 24 hours before slaughter.",

Lung lobes that showed pulmonary lesions were sampled; if both lobes showed lesions or if no lesions were visible, the left lobe was sampled because of its close proximity to the person collecting the sample. The tissue samples (\u22481\u20132 g) were collected aseptically from inside the lung lobes by using sterile surgical instruments (scalpels, forceps, and scissors). To avoid cross-contamination, lungs were moved to a clean room adjacent to the slaughtering hall and examined on a freshly disinfected table by a person wearing a newly donned gown, face mask, and sterile gloves and using a new set of sterile surgical instruments. Collected tissue samples were immediately deposited in labeled sterile plastic bags and placed in a cooler containing ice packs for transport to the laboratory. ",

Sequences of the full MERS-CoV spike gene coding region were obtained from nasal swabs collected from 3 live animals in December 2013 (camels C8, C9) and May 2014 (camel C23) and from a lung sample collected from 1 animal carcass (camel C7) in November 2013 (GenBank accession nos. KP405225 [camel C8], KP405226 [camel C7], KP405227 [camel C9], KP966104 [camel C23]). The spike sequences differed from each other and clustered with published MERS-CoV sequences from humans and dromedary camels with no clear correlation in time or location. Sequences from the sample from camel C7 most closely matched sequences obtained from a human in Hafar Al-Batin in 2013; sequences from camel C9 most closely matched sequences obtained from a human in Riyadh in 2014; and the sequence from camel C23 was identical to a sequence obtained from a dromedary camel in an unidentified region of Saudi Arabia in 2014 (Figure 2).

In their experimental inoculation study, Adney et al. (23) observed histologic lesions in the epithelium of the upper and lower (trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles) respiratory tract and recovered viable virus from these tissues and from 1 of 4 lung lobes of an animal euthanized 5 days after inoculation; viable virus was not recovered from tissues of 2 other animals at 28 and 42 days after inoculation. Although that limited study found infection extending to the lung of 1 animal, the authors found that the upper respiratory tract was the predominant site of virus replication and offered that finding as an explanation for the lack of observed systemic illness among naturally infected dromedary camels. An alternative hypothesis posits that, in the natural setting, subclinical MERS-CoV infection of the lower respiratory tract also occurs, possibly enhanced by crowding and stress endured during transport and corralling before slaughter. Although we did not collect matching premortem nasal swab samples from slaughtered animals to determine how many were also positive for MERS-CoV in the upper respiratory tract, our findings raise the possibility that testing upper respiratory tract samples alone may underestimate the true number of actively infected animals. In humans, MERS-CoV was detected in the lower respiratory tract of infected patients for \u22481 month while oronasal swab samples were negative (24). Likewise, MERS-CoV detection has been found to be enhanced from lower respiratory tract specimens, and therefore these specimens are recommended by the World Health Organization for diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection (2,24,25). Although great care was taken to avoid contamination with ambient MERS-CoV present in the abattoir, the possibility that sample contamination occurred cannot be entirely ruled out. Further studies that include immunohistologic examination and virus isolation from the lower respiratory tract of naturally infected dromedary camels will be needed to substantiate these findings.",

Although data interpretation was complicated by discontinuity in the months sampled and sampling from only 1 animal group in some months, a temporal pattern in MERS-CoV prevalence was apparent. For both animal groups, peak detection occurred during November 2013\u2013January 2014, followed by a steady decline, reaching the lowest point in May 2014. Although we observed no clear temporal differences in the geographic origins or ages of dromedary camels brought to slaughter, which might bias these results, our data are nevertheless limited and should not be used to imply a general pattern of MERS-CoV circulation in dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia. Nevertheless, these findings would not be unexpected. Increased circulation of MERS-CoV among dromedary camels during the cool season is consistent with the prevailing cooler ambient temperatures, which have been shown to enhance coronavirus survivability outside the host (26,27), and the cool season is the period of peak circulation of other respiratory viral pathogens of humans in Saudi Arabia (28\u201330). This period also corresponds with the peak calving season for dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia (16); higher rates of MERS-CoV infections among a greater proportion of young animals with higher virus loads may increase opportunities for virus spread (5,16).",

Serologic studies of animal handlers in Saudi Arabia who work in close proximity to dromedary camels have shown limited evidence of MERS-CoV infection (32\u201334). Alghamdi et al. (35), who examined patterns of MERS-CoV infections among humans in Saudi Arabia between June 2013 and May 2014, did not find a concomitant temporal increase in human infections that corresponded with our findings in dromedary camels. Those authors observed a slight, temporary increase in cases among humans in June and September 2013 and few cases from October through February, after which cases and deaths sharply increased beginning in April 2014. The authors concluded that lower relative humidity and higher temperatures during these months might have contributed to the dramatic surge in reported cases. However, more recent data from the World Health Organization (36) show a sharp decline in MERS-CoV cases among humans in May 2014; low numbers of cases were reported from June through August 2014, when mean temperature was highest and relative humidity was lowest in Saudi Arabia (34). Moreover, a recent increase in numbers of MERS-CoV cases in humans from September 2014 through February 2015 corresponds more closely with the temporal pattern we found in dromedary camels the preceding year. Further studies conducted over multiple years are needed to better understand the ecology of MERS-CoV, which might help inform intervention strategies to reduce zoonotic infections.",
