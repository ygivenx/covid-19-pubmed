These frames influence people\u2019s reactions.\n5\n Health experts are not immune to such \u2018framing effects\u2019, and in previous respiratory illness crises, such as the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, were both reliant on and influenced by mass media reporting on events.\n4\n, \n6\n\n",

These include ensuring that citizens are sufficiently informed about significant issues as to be able to make appropriate decisions and to engage in forms of collective action against threats, such as infectious disease. Many studies of media ethics concentrate on identifying the ways in which coverage falls short of this ideal. The limitations of mass media reporting, mostly resulting from its commercial imperatives, have been repeatedly described since the 1960s. Among them are claims that the media is prone to sensationalism, sins of omission and sheer inaccuracy\n7\n, \n8\n; that in seeking to provide \u2018both sides of a story\u2019, it may perpetuate a problem or give unwarranted validity to wholly untenable views; that it leaves out complexity\n8\n and is the reverse of \u2018evidence based\u2019.\n9\n, \n10\n\n",

In particular, the more experienced medical reporters valued their independence and capacity for generating and maintaining discussions critical of government actions. (One commented drily, \u2018The media is not the public relations wing of the health department.\u2019) However, we note that despite this stated commitment, in practice, in crisis situations journalists are often either too much taken up with the outlook of those whose views they report or too busy to take a critical stance. See for example a critique of the reporting of air quality issues in the lower Manhattan district after 9/11.\n22\n\n",

Specialist health reporters anticipated playing leading roles in a pandemic and in becoming rapidly educated about the relevant basic scientific information and technical issues.

Our study suggests that as time passes, journalists resume their role as critics of government and prioritise news values such a dissent and novelty above other public goods. \u2018Postmortem\u2019 reflections from government and community leaders on the handling of an outbreak have high news value and will be given considerable coverage, quite likely regardless of their intrinsic merits. Such reflections regarding H1N1 influenza, for example, have been evident since late 2009.\n27\n, \n28\n Therefore we suggest media strategies in pandemic plans should anticipate this post\u2010acute, \u2018reflective\u2019 phase.",

During the H1N1 threat, journalists sought to diversify their sources as part of providing new and interesting angles, but found that at exactly this time many of those best qualified to comment were tied up at the coalface and/or constrained in speaking to the media because of their government role. Being sensitive to media timetables and being available to check stories would have offered health officials more influence on the quality of coverage.\n8\n However, we note that uncertainties are not always clearly reported, or may tend to amplify perceptions of risk.

As these sorts of responses are often among the most critical in early pandemic responses, their under\u2010representation would certainly influence the way a pandemic and its solutions were framed and hence affect public and government responses. The H1N1 influenza 2009 pandemic has played out such dynamics. Early media reports focusing on upcoming biomedical solutions were met with assurances from many governments of an adequate and fast\u2010tracked supply of vaccine for the entire population. Now, in the face of a mild pandemic, there are post hoc criticisms about cost to the public purse, timing and delivery mechanisms.\n27\n, \n30\n\n",
