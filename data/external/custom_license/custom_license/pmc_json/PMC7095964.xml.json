For both biological problems and the broader category of disaster response, you need really well-trained and smart public health and medical professionals. You need access to medicines and vaccines for the problems that you're confronting. You need healthcare institutions to be well prepared. You need to be able to communicate with the public in ways that help the public help themselves.",

There'll be a lot of pressures on the healthcare system and a lot of pressure on [political] leaders for how to govern in a crisis. There's still a long lead time required to make medicines and vaccines. Pandemic planning is particularly challenging given the sweep of the consequences across society, not just health or medical.",

It's basically prepared public health agencies for hurricanes, for wildfires and for some of the terrible mass shootings that have happened. There's been a misperception that if you build public health preparedness, that you can reach [your target] and turn it off. In reality, the way we need to think about public health preparedness is more like the way we think about fire departments or police departments or national defense. It's not going to be the case that you can retire the fire department because you had no fires over the past year.",
