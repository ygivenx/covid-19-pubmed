Therefore, new innovative therapies are urgently required in order to combat the high mortality and morbidity associated with cancers. Antigen-specific immunotherapy has emerged as an attractive approach for the treatment of cancers since it has the ability to specifically eradicate systemic tumors and control metastases without damaging normal cells. DNA vaccination has become a potentially promising approach for antigen-specific immunotherapy due to its safety, stability, and ease of preparation (for review, see [1, 2]). We have previously developed several innovative strategies to enhance DNA vaccine potency by directly targeting the DNA into the dendritic cells (DCs) in vivo via gene gun as well as by modifying the properties of antigen-expressing DCs (for review see [3, 4]).",

Previously, we have studied the linkage of calreticulin (CRT), a Ca2+-binding protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum (for review, see [5]) to several antigens, including human papilloma virus type-16 (HPV-16) E7 [6, 7], E6 [8], and nucleocapsid protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [9]. Intradermal administration of CRT linked to any of these target antigens led to a significant increase in the antigen-specific CD8+ T cell (CTL) immune responses and impressive antitumor effects. Thus, CRT has been shown to be highly potent in enhancing the antigen-specific immune responses and antitumor effects generated by DNA vaccination in several preclinical models.",

Proteasomes play an important role in a number of cellular processes that may contribute to cancer cell growth and survival. This suggests that proteasome inhibitors could provide a new and promising class of anticancer agents (for review, see [10]). The dipeptide boronic acid analog bortezomib, also known as PS341, which inhibits the function of the 26S proteasome, was the first proteasome inhibitor used in a clinical setting [11]. This drug is Food and Drug Administration approved and is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of multiple myeloma [12, 13] as well as in many others hematologic and solid tumors [14] including lymphomas [15], chronic lymphocytic leukemia [16], and cancers of the head and neck [17], prostate [18], and breast [19].",

We observed that the combination of treatment with bortezomib and CRT/E7(detox) DNA generated potent E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses and significant therapeutic effects against TC-1 tumors in tumor-bearing mice. Furthermore, treatment with bortezomib led to increased apoptosis of TC-1 tumor cells in tumor-bearing mice. In addition, treatment with bortezomib could render the TC-1 tumor cells more susceptible to lysis by E7-specific CTLs in vitro. The clinical implications of the current study are discussed.",

A second-generation plasmid from pNGVL-3, pNGVL4a, encodes a kanamycin-resistant gene and a transcription unit consisting of a cytomegalovirus promoter and multiple cloning site, followed by a poly-A tail. It contains two short immunostimulatory DNA sequences (ISS) in the noncoding region of the backbone. The ISS sequences are derived from a bacterial ampicillin-resistant gene and consist of tandem repeats of a CpG dinucleotide in the base context, 5\u2032-AACGTT-3\u2032. It has been demonstrated that an ISS-containing pDNA can elicit the production of interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 and interleukin 12 in transfected keratocytes and dermal antigen-presenting cells, which results in a potent T helper cell type 1 (Th1) response. This vector also contains a transcription unit that yields high levels of Ag expression and its DNA adjuvant unit elicits strong immunologic Th1 type responses against the pDNA-encoded protein. E7 oncogenic protein detox form has substituted amino acids at positions 24 (glycine in place of cysteine) and 26 (glycine in place of glutamic acid). These substitutions have been shown to inhibit E7 protein binding to pRb at position 11, abating E7\u2019s ability to transform cells. Thus, it is more adequately used in clinical trials.",

TC-1 tumor cells were treated with bortezomib with or without E7-specific CTLs. Untreated TC-1 tumor cells and TC-1 cells treated with E7-specific CTLs alone were used as controls. The CTL-mediated killing of the TC-1 tumor cells in each well was monitored using bioluminescent imaging systems. This assay has been used previously by us [24] and others [25] and the degree of CTL-mediated killing of the tumor cells has been shown to correlate with the decrease of luminescence activity. As shown in Fig. 5, the lowest luciferase activity was observed in the wells with TC-1 incubated with bortezomib and E7-specific cytotoxic T cells as compared to the wells incubated with bortezomib alone or E7-specific cytotoxic T cells alone. Thus, our data suggest that the TC-1 tumor cells treated with bortezomib increased the susceptibility of the tumor cells for lysis by the E7-specific cytotoxic T cells. We also observed that treatment with bortezomib alone led to a higher degree of TC-1 tumor cell death compared to CTLs alone using the specified conditions for the in vitro study. However, the observed effect may depend on the concentration of bortezomib and/or the number of CTLs used in the in vitro killing assay. We also performed a CTL killing assay using TC-1 tumors treated with different concentrations of bortezomib. We observed that TC-1 cells treated with increasing doses of bortezomib demonstrated enhanced CTL-mediated killing (Supplementary Fig. 1). Thus, our results indicate that the TC-1 tumor cells treated with increasing doses of bortezomib increased the susceptibility of the tumor cells for lysis by the E7-specific cytotoxic T cells.\n\n",

In the current study, we administered bortezomib before the second DNA vaccination.

We have previously observed that treatment of the tumor with epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) led to apoptotic tumor cell death, resulting in higher levels of E7 peptide-loaded dendritic cells in the draining lymph nodes of tumor-bearing mice [29]. This increase in the levels of E7 peptide-loaded dendritic cells resulted in an increased number of E7-specific CD8+ T cell precursors in treated mice. Thus, treatment with EGCG significantly boosted the potency of the CRT/E7 DNA vaccine, by enhancing the E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses and antitumor effects. Similarly, treatment with bortezomib also led to apoptotic tumor cell death, thus enhancing CRT/E7 DNA vaccine potency. Therefore, it would be of interest to observe if the degree of apoptotic cell death generated by these reagents correlates with the ability to enhance the DNA vaccine potency.",

Several mechanisms may account for the observed phenomenon. For example, bortezomib may lead to upregulation of MHC class I, resulting in increased recognition of antigenic peptide\u2013MHC class I complex by E7-specific CD8+ T cells. However, we have characterized the expression of MHC class I and B-7 on TC-1 tumor cells following treatment with bortezomib. We did not find significant change in the levels of MHC class I and B-7 on TC-1 cells (data not shown). Furthermore, it has been reported that tumor cells treated with bortezomib does not lead to increased expression of MHC class I molecules [30]. Alternatively, treatment with bortezomib may lead to increased expression of E7 protein and/or death receptors (DR). It has been shown that renal cell carcinoma cells treated with bortezomib demonstrated upregulation of DR5 [30]. Furthermore, it has been reported that treatment of tumors with bortezomib can lead to the upregulation of molecules that may sensitize tumors for apoptotic cell death, such as Fas, rendering tumors more susceptible to immune cells expressing death ligands, such as FasL [31]. We have characterized the expression of FasL on the E7-specific CD8+ T cells and we found that our E7-specific CD8+ T cells do express FasL (see Supplementary Fig. 2). In addition, TC-1 cells have been shown to express Fas [32]. Thus, our data indicate that the sensitization of the tumor by bortezomib (presumably by upregulation of Fas on tumor cells) may contribute to the enhanced cytotoxic killing by E7-specific CD8+ T cells. It would be of interest to further characterize and manipulate these molecules in order to illustrate the mechanism for the increased susceptibility of the TC-1 tumors to the killing by E7-specific CD8+ T cells.",

It would be important to further determine the optimal dose and regimen of bortezomib and CRT/E7 DNA vaccine in order to generate the best therapeutic effects in a preclinical model.
