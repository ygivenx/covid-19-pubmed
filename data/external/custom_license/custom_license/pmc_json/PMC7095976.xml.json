This is not the first time such proclamations have been made. Past director-generals first set 2000, then the end of 2002, as deadlines for a polio-free world, calling its eradication the \u2018end-game\u2019. Their campaign was successful\u2014almost. So far this year, there have been 304 polio cases in 8 countries, compared with 350,000 in 125 countries when the initiative began in 1988. The Americas and the Western Pacific and European regions have all been certified polio-free, meaning they have not seen polio caused by wild strains of the virus in at least three years.",

Lee has appointed a new chief for the initiative: David Heymann, who brings with him the experience of battling smallpox in India, drug-resistant malaria in Malawi, Ebola in the Congo and, most recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) worldwide. In an effort to cut costs, the program is adopting such practical strategies as trying to piggyback its surveillance efforts with those already in place for influenza, yellow fever and SARS. Members of the initiative, including Rotary International and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have enlisted the help of religious and community leaders, film stars and even cricket players to convey their message.",

Nearly 10,000 laboratories worldwide carry stocks of the virus, but of 147 countries with stocks, only 80 have submitted an inventory and only 9 have destroyed their stocks. At the same time, some laboratories must maintain expertise in polio, both for surveillance purposes and for continuing research into the virus and vaccine. For instance, the genetic basis of the virus\u2019 transmission is only poorly understood; more information there would be invaluable to preventing outbreaks.",
