            "text": "Synonymous codon usage bias has been investigated in many organisms, as the genetic code is degenerate. The synonymous codons are also non-randomly used in viruses infecting living organisms. Several factors such as mutational bias (Jenkins and Holmes, 2003; Gu et al., 2004; Zhou et al., 2005), translational selection (Sau et al., 2005a; 2005b; 2005c), gene function (Wang et al., 2002; Gu et al., 2004; Zhou et al., 2005), gene length (Sau et al., 2005a), and CpG island (Shackelton et al., 2006) were found to influence codon usage in animal viruses and phages, and mutational bias was found as the major determinant factor. Adams and Antoniw (2004) also suggested that mutational bias rather than translational selection was the major determinant of codon usage variation amongst plant viruses.",

Most geminiviruses belong to the genus Begomovirus, which are transmitted exclusively by the whitefly Bemisia tabaci (Harrison and Robinson, 1999). Many begomoviruses have bipartite genomes known as DNA A and DNA B. DNA A contains the AV1 (coat protein) and AV2 ORFs (open reading frames) in the virus strand and, on the complementary strand, four ORFs: AC1 (replication initiation protein), AC2 (transcriptional activator protein), AC3 (replication enhancer protein) and AC4. The virus and complementary strands of DNA B contain two ORFs: BV1 (nuclear shuttle protein) and BC1 (movement protein). Some begomoviruses have a monopartite genome and lack DNA B. Phylogenetic analysis shows that begomoviruses can be generally divided into two groups, the Old World begomoviruses (eastern hemisphere, Asia, Africa, Europe, the Mediterranean areas) and the New World begomoviruses (western hemisphere, the Americas). All the New World begomoviruses are evolved to bipartite with lack of AV2 ORF in DNA A, whereas both bipartite and monopartite begomoviruses in the Old World encode AV2 ORF (Harrison and Robinson, 1999).",

Effective number of codons (N\nc), ranging from 20 to 61, is generally used to measure the bias of synonymous codons. When N\nc value approaches 20, only one codon is used with extreme bias for one amino acid and, if the value is up to 61, the anonymous codons are used equally with no bias (Wright, 1990).",

RSCU values have no relation to the amino acids usage and the abundance ratio of synonymous codons, which can directly reflect the bias of synonymous codon usage (Sharp and Li, 1986). The codon adaptation index (CAI) was used to estimate the extent of bias towards codons that were known to be preferred in highly expressed genes (Sharp and Li, 1987). It is now proved that CAI values mostly approach the theoretical values to reflect the expression level of a gene. Thus it has been widely utilized to measure the gene expression level (Naya et al., 2001; Gupta et al., 2004). A CAI value ranges from 0 to 1.0, and a higher value indicates a stronger codon usage bias and a higher expression level.",

It was suggested that if GC3 content was the only determinant of the codon usage variation among the genes, then the N\nc value would fall on the continuous curve between N\nc value and GC3 content (Wright, 1990). In general, if genes are distributed in N\nc plots approaching the expected continuous curve with no selection, then codon usage bias of genes is mainly influenced by compositional constraints. Otherwise the codon usage bias of genes is more affected by other factors such as translational selection, etc. The N\nc plot for genes of the 147 begomoviruses showed that although a small number of genes were located on the expected curve, most points lay far below the expected curve (Fig.1), suggesting that apart from mutation bias, other factors might also play a role in shaping the codon usage bias of begomoviruses (Guo et al., 2007).",

The distribution of the three groups along the first two major axes showed that the Old World monopartite begomoviruses and the New World bipartite ones were located in two independent fields, indicating that the two groups of begomoviruses exhibit a different codon usage pattern. Because the species with a close genetic relationship always present a similar codon usage pattern (Sharp et al., 1988), the genetic relationship of the two groups of begomoviruses should be far removed from each other. As to the Old World begomoviruses with bipartite genomes, we found that the majority of them exhibited a similar codon usage pattern with the Old World monopartite begomoviruses, and a few of them showed a similar codon usage to the New World bipartite begomoviruses. An explication of this result might be that a number of Old World bipartite begomoviruses evolved to adopt the codon usage pattern of some Old World monopartite begomoviruses.

Therefore, the base mutation at the synonymous third codon position may not affect the protein expression for AC1 gene because of the degeneration of genetic codons. But for the embedded AC4 gene, the corresponding base mutation occurs at the second codon position, which probably results in the loss of function of the translated protein. Thus we suggested that AC4 gene might degenerate step by step during the long period of evolution, which might be an important reason for explaining the loss of function for the AC4 gene in the bipartite begomoviruses with DNA B.",

Based on codon usage pattern analysis, it could be inferred that there was no direct relationship between the Old World monopartite begomoviruses and the New World bipartite ones. Interestingly, a small number of the Old World bipartite begomoviruses exhibited a similar codon usage pattern to the New World bipartite ones, which suggested that the ancestor of begomoviruses could have evolved from monopartite to bipartite ones before they were transferred to the New World areas. Subsequently it was not the Old World monopartite begomoviruses but the Old World bipartite ones that transmitted to the New World in a certain way and finally evolved into the New World bipartite begomoviruses.

Rybicki (1994) suggested that the absence of the AV2 gene in all the New World begomoviruses could be attributed to its earlier loss after the New World begomoviruses arriving in the New World. These results suggest that the current New World begomoviruses evolved from ancient viruses after transferring to the New World. Ha et al.(2006) speculated that the new identified begomovirus termed Corchorus yellow vein virus (CoYVV) might belong to a New World begomovirus group that previously existed in the Old World, which suggested that the common ancestor of the New World begomovirus might originate from the Old World begomovirus. However, both the New World and Old World begomoviruses had began to evolve and coexisted in this area for a long time before the separation of the continents.
