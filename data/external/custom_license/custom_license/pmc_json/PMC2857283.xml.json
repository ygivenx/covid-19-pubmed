In the early stages of\n        an epidemic, chance events are important because the number of infected persons is small. We\n        simulated these early stages by using a stochastic model for which every simulation is\n        different. We present both the mean behavior of the simulations and the range of possible\n        outcomes across a large number of simulations. In a stochastic model, introduction of 1\n        infected person has a finite probability of resulting in the rapid extinction of an\n        infectious disease. To increase the probability of initiating an outbreak, we introduced 3\n        asymptomatic persons into the population. We simulated the outbreak in a large extended\n        metropolitan area with a population of 107 persons.",

            "text": "In our stochastic model, events (such as infection or a person leaving the source area)\n        occur by chance. For example, the time after symptom onset at which a person recovers from\n        infection with SARS is not a fixed quantity; rather, it is a randomly chosen time with a\n        mean of 10 days. Table 1 shows the average latent and\n        infectious periods used. The probability of leaving the country is constant for all persons\n          (Table 1). The probability of a susceptible person\n        becoming infected increases as a larger proportion of the population becomes infected and is\n        chosen so that the average number of new infections caused by each infected person in the\n        early stages of the epidemic is equal to the basic reproductive number\n        R0 (2.5 for SARS, 1.8 for influenza; Table 1). The epidemic is simulated by evaluating the probability that any\n        person is infected, becomes symptomatic, or recovers in any short time interval (we divide\n        time into sequential short intervals of one fiftieth of a day), and then testing whether\n        that event occurs. The simulation can be thought of as generating a random number between 0\n        and 1 for each person in each time step. If this random number is less than the probability\n        of a particular event occurring to that person, then the event occurs. Otherwise, the person\n        is left in his or her current state. The model does not store the details of every person\n        separately but keeps track of the number of persons who are susceptible\n        (S), latently infected (E), infectious\n        (I), and recovered (R) at any point in time. As events\n        occur, these variables change. For example, when a person becomes infected,\n        S decreases by 1 and E increases by 1. Because the events\n        occur by chance, the total number of persons who are in each state, including the number of\n        infected persons taking flights, varies stochastically.",
