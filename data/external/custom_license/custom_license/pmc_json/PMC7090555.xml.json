It has been identified as a novel effector molecule of Treg cells and plays a critical role in regulating both innate immunity and adaptive immunity [11]. Several studies have shown that FGL2 contributes to the pathogenesis of a number of infectious diseases including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), HBV and HCV infection, mouse hepatitis virus strain 3 infection (MHV-3), and HIV infection [12\u201315]. However, little is known about its biological functions in cancer development and metastasis until now. Previous work from Qin Ning\u2019s group demonstrated that FGL2 could contribute to HCC growth and angiogenesis in a thrombin-dependent manner, and it might be a potential therapeutic target in HCC [16]. The biological functions of FGL2 in CRC metastasis and the exact mechanism of how FGL2 exerts its function are still unclear.",

Our study also revealed key functions of FGL2 in promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of CRC cells, which may hold implications in metastasis of CRC.",

However, the biological functions of FGL2 in CRC metastasis and the exact mechanism of how FGL2 exerts its function are still unclear. One novel finding in our study is that FGL2 was closely associated with EMT in CRC. The EMT is a process that epithelial cells lose their cell polarity and cell\u2013cell adhesion and gain migratory and invasive properties to become mesenchymal stem cells. A lot of previous study found that initiation of metastasis requires invasion, which is enabled by EMT [25, 26]. We found FGL2 knockdown caused a significant regression of EMT features, where a gain in the expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin and a loss in the expression of mesenchymal marker N-cadherin were observed. In FGL2-overexpressed HT29 cells, increased expression of mesenchymal marker (N-cadherin) concurred with the enhanced invasive ability. In a tail vein injection mouse model of cancer metastasis, overexpression of FGL2 led to a significant increase in the number of lesions of lung metastasis. Since EMT plays a critical role in CRC invasion and metastasis, FGL2 involved in EMT induction may be a mechanistic link between FGL2 and CRC metastasis.",
