ISGs can block virus at multiple stages including modulation of viral entry into cells, translation initiation, propagation, and spread [1, 2]. Among the first ISGs to be discovered and cloned is the interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFITs) family composed of IFIT1, 2, 3, 5, and several pseudogenes and IFIT-like genes [3]. IFIT proteins are characterized by multiple repeats of tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) helix-turn-helix motifs which are involved in numerous protein\u2013protein interactions during various physiological and pathological process including translation initiation, cell migration, proliferation, double-stranded RNA signaling, and virus replication [4].",

To preliminarily explore its antiviral properties, in vitro experiments were conducted after treatment with viral analog, poly(I:C), a synthetic double-stranded RNA and has been extensively used to mimic viral infection [12, 13]. Moreover, the promoter activity and major cis-acting elements were identified as well. The results contribute to further revealing the antiviral effect and underlying mechanisms of pIFIT2, which will be helpful in breeding pigs with resistance to viral diseases.",

Rodentia B is the ancestor of euarchontoglires to which human being belongs, while Insectivora C/Chiroptera is the ancestor of laurasiatheria to which pig belongs. The evolution of IFIT2 gene in euarchontoglires and laurasiatheria tends to stable.

Also, there are no detectable levels of IFIT mRNA in untreated HT1080 cells and HEK293 cells using RNase protection assay [17]. The sensitivity of the methods used may be the reason for the differences between our results and others. The pIFIT2 is induced by poly(I:C) in a time- and dose-dependent manner, and the induction pattern is similar to that of human IFIT2 gene whose mRNA level is induced strongly by poly(I:C) at 6 h, remained constant at 12 h, and dropped sharply between 12 and 24 h in HT1080 cells [17].

Bioinformatic analysis has revealed common consensus sequence for transcription factor deltaEF1 between positions \u2212 1838 and \u2212 1759. DeltaEF1 factor, a zinc finger protein, is implicated in the regulation of a lot of viral and cellular genes with functionally diverse roles [21, 22]. Through binding directly to the promoters, it represses transcription of epithelial splicing regulatory protein 2 [23], E-cadherin [24] and Plakophilin 3 genes [25], and suppresses promoter activity of chicken infectious anemia virus [26] as well. Here, we confirmed that deltaEF1 is also transcription repressor of pIFIT2 gene. Additionally, the promoter activity was strongly enhanced when the fragment was truncated from nt position \u2212 389 to \u2212 310 at the 5\u2032 end, indicating another repressor present here. No specific transcription factor binding site was predicted in the region using TFSEARCH program, while by using Alibaba 2 program, Id3 consensus sequence was identified. Id3 is a dominant-negative regulator of transcription by sequestering other TFs, thus making them unable to bind DNA [27, 28]. However, the promoter activity was not restored when the predicted motif was deleted partially or completely from construct pGL3-G (data not given). The results reveal that Id3 is not involved in the transcription of pIFIT2, and there should be other factors regulating pIFIT2 expression.",

These two elements act synergistically with ISREI, closer to the start codon, having more strength. Furthermore, a third functional ISRE element was identified in the upstream of pIFIT2 promoter. To our knowledge, this is not reported previously for other IFIT promoters. As we use different reporter genes to confirm the potential elements, ISREIII and ISREI-II, we cannot reveal which one is the strongest in the induction of pIFIT2. However, we assure pIFIT2 is more sensitive to poly(I:C). Here, we show that 10 ng/ml poly(I:C) can induce the expression of pIFIT2 effectively, while in a simultaneously performed experiment we found that 50 ng/ml poly(I:C) induce activity of pIFIT5 promoter marginally (data not given), and that efficient induction of pIFIT5 need a \u00b5g/ml level of poly(I:C) concentration [29]. This may be correlated with the existence of ISREIII.",

NF-\u03baB, a transcription factor family including p50, p52, p65/RelA, RelB, c-Rel, and v-Rel, regulates the expression of genes involved in antiviral immune response by binding to cis-acting sites in the promoters. The induction of murine Ifit1 and Isg15 was lower by type I IFN in NF-\u03baB knock out fibroblasts than in wild-type cells, while the induction of Mx1 and Nmi was at much higher levels, indicating that NF-\u03baB plays a selective and distinct role in regulating the expression of ISGs and the induction of antiviral activity [30]. Further analysis revealed that p50 directly binds to the promoter of Mx1 gene and thereby refrains its induction [31]. We demonstrated here that NF-\u03baB binding sites play a positive role in the activation of pIFIT2, which is similar to the effects of NF-\u03baB on Ifit1 and Isg15 induction. Further experiment needs to be performed to identify which member of NF-\u03baB family binding to the cis-acting element. Nevertheless, we identified several important cis-acting elements in the promoter region of pIFIT2, which will contribute to clarifying the mechanism underlying its transcriptional regulation.",
