The clinical data of the analyzed cohorts of children are reported in Table E1 and in the Methods section in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org.

Because TGF-\u03b2 induces Treg cells,2 we first investigated which genes related to tolerance were significantly regulated by rhinovirus in PBMCs from these children. Here we found that in asthmatic children rhinovirus upregulated immunosuppressive genes, such as cytotoxic T lymphocyte\u2013associated protein 4 (CTLA4) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1; CD274), and interferon-induced transmembrane protein 2 (IFITM2; Fig 1, B and C). Consistent with the array data, we found that IDO1 was upregulated in PBMCs of asthmatic children cultured with rhinovirus compared with those of control children (see Fig E1, A, in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org). This regulation was found to be independent from steroids because dexamethasone significantly downregulated IDO in PBMCs (see Fig E1, B).",

We noticed that TGF-\u03b2\u2013inhibitory genes, such as TGIF2 and LAP3, were upregulated in rhinovirus-treated PBMCs from asthmatic children. Moreover, rhinovirus inhibited genes that cleave viruses, such as RNASE1, in PBMCs from children with asthma (Fig 1, B and C). By contrast, in control children rhinovirus did not significantly regulate these genes. In these children other factors were found to be significantly regulated by rhinovirus, such as lymphocyte antigen 6E (Fig 1, D and E), a protein involved in the TGF-\u03b2 pathway. Moreover, we found that in PBMCs from control children, rhinovirus induced IL-32 (Fig 1, C and D). Expression of this protein is known to induce the production of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 and might thereby modulate immune responses.4",

Among PBMC supernatants, TGF-\u03b2 protein was detected in high amounts in untreated cell-culture supernatants in both asthmatic and control children. However, after ex vivo challenge with rhinovirus, TGF-\u03b2 protein expression was found to be significantly decreased (Fig 2, A), although TGFB mRNA expression remained constant (Fig 2, B). Because rhinovirus infection suppressed TGF-\u03b2 release, we assumed that rhinovirus facilitates TGF-\u03b2 binding to the cell membrane, and for this reason, we could not detect it in the supernatants of rhinovirus-infected PBMCs.",

At the moment, we do not know which cells are infected by rhinovirus in the PBMC population we examined; however, we assume that plasmacytoid dendritic cells are infected because of the induction of IDO after rhinovirus challenge ex vivo.6 However, rhinovirus infection also activates TGF-\u03b2 present in the environment, as in patients with chronic asthma, to replicate and inhibit effective antiviral immune responses. Thus it is possible that children with acute asthma are able to induce an effective anti-rhinovirus immune response during acute exacerbation. By contrast, in patients with chronic asthma, TGF-\u03b2 is increased in its active form and is released by structural cells. In this latter situation, when the rhinovirus infects plasmacytoid dendritic cells, this exogenous TGF-\u03b2 inhibits TH1 and TC1 cells that carry the TGF-\u03b2 receptor, resulting in TH1 cell depletion, and thus rhinovirus infection cannot be cleared. Although these data need further investigation, they open new avenues for our understanding of the role of rhinovirus-mediated asthma exacerbations in children.",
