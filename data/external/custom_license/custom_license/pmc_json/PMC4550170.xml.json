Once a MERS PUI was identified, the patient\u2019s specimens were transported from the hospital or local public health laboratory to CDPH in Richmond, California, for MERS-CoV testing. Specimens tested for each PUI consisted of >1 of the following: upper respiratory tract sample (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens), lower respiratory tract sample (sputum and lower respiratory tract aspirates or washes), serum, or stool. Time from specimen collection to receipt at CDPH was up to 48 hours for most PUIs (37/52 [71%]). Because subsequent steps in infection control and patient management heavily depended on the test results, MERS-CoV testing at CDPH was expedited; the typical turnaround time was 4 hours from receipt of specimens to reporting of results.",

However, MERS-CoV poses a potential threat to global public health because MERS cases continue to be reported in Saudi Arabia, and the reservoir for the virus remains unclear, although camels have been implicated in disease transmission (14). CDPH has established a coordinated statewide system working with local partners to identify potential MERS cases in California travelers returning from MERS-affected regions and their contacts. CDPH has investigated and conducted laboratory testing on >50 MERS PUIs and identified a respiratory virus in 62% of those patients, 35% of which were positive for influenza virus. The high rate of influenza detection underscores the need for all travelers to be immunized for influenza. CDPH continues to evaluate each MERS PUI and expedite MERS-CoV laboratory testing so that prompt implementation of containment procedures and contact investigations may proceed if needed.",
