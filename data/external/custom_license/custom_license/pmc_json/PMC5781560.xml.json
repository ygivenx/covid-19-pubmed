In 2011, a live oral Ad vaccine including serotypes 4 and 7 was reintroduced into US basic military training populations. Changes in clinical presentations and current epidemiology of non-vaccine Ad serotypes and other respiratory pathogens have not been reported.",

Marked reductions in frequency of all Ad and vaccine serotypes are seen, with no observed serotype shift.
