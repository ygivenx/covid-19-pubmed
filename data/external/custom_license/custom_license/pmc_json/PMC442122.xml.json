Currently, seven coronavirus genomes, including SARS coronavirus (CoV), have been fully sequenced and cluster into four main groups, of which SARS-CoV occupies its own [2,3]. Polyproteins encoded by the coronavirus RNA are processed by viral proteinases yielding mature proteins. The main proteinase 3CLpro performs at least eleven proteolytic cleavages within a single viral polyprotein [4,5]. Viral polyprotein processing is a common theme in viral molecular biology, e.g. as seen in picornaviruses and retroviruses like HIV. Therefore, essential viral proteinases have been suggested as potential targets for specific therapeutic approaches, e.g. by development of specific proteinase inhibitors [6-8].",

Earlier, we developed a computational approach for predicting potential cleavage sites of picornavirus proteinases 2A and 3C [10]. Badorff et al. successfully used this cleavage predictor to identify the cellular target dystrophin, which they experimentally showed to be cleaved both in vitro and in vivo [11]. However, preliminary studies revealed that this model is not compatible with coronavirus cleavage sites. The general approach is still valid though, and we decided to apply this method to the problem of predicting the 3CLpro proteinase cleavage sites and identifying potential host cell target proteins. We propose that a deeper understanding of coronavirus proteinase function and substrate specificity may benefit further research by: i) increasing the understanding of substrate specificity determinants which may direct studies focusing on the development of specific proteinase inhibitors and ii) providing a method for screening cellular target proteins for potential coronavirus proteinase cleavage sites.",

Every site had a glutamine (Q) in position P1 (the position just before the cleavage site; the positions are named as suggested by Berger and Schechter [13] with P1, P2, ... etc., N-terminal to the cleavage site and P1', P2', ... etc., C-terminal to the cleavage site). From the sequence logo (Figure 1) a very strong consensus is evident around the cleavage site. As discussed by others [14,15], the coronavirus 3C-like proteinase shares many traits with its picornavirus 3C proteinase counterpart, hence the name. This is reflected in the cleavage site logo although differences between the two are also apparent. Positions P1', P1, and P4 have similar amino acid distribution in the 3C and 3CL proteinase cleavage sites. On the other hand, the coronavirus proteinase has a strong preference for leucine at position P2 while this position is relatively non-conserved among picornavirus proteinase cleavage sites [10]. A recently published study of the crystal structure of 3CLpro from the 229E strain of human coronaviruses indicates that residues at positions P5 to P3 form an anti-parallel \u03b2 sheet with part of the proteinase, signifying their importance in cleavage site recognition [7].",

With the present data set from seven different coronaviruses it is possible to classify correctly 60 (78%) of the 77 cleavage sites by matching an 'LQ' consensus pattern. However, an additional 196 sites in the viral polyproteins are incorrectly classified as cleavage sites, being random occurrences of this pair of amino acids. Classification is improved by using the consensus pattern 'LQ [S/A]', meaning Leu-Gln-(Ser OR Ala), but it is still far from being a useful classifier. The false positive rate is now down to 36 wrong sites, but at the same time only 48 (62%) of the correct cleavage sites are detected. As the pattern becomes more sophisticated, specificity increases (reducing the number of false positives) but at the same time sensitivity drops dramatically (i.e. fewer of the true sites are detected).",

The best model was obtained using a three-layered neural network with two hidden neurons and a sequence window encompassing nine amino acids centered on the P1 position, thus encompassing P5-P4'. The network evaluates and assigns a score between 0 and 1 to every glutamine to which it is presented, where a score above 0.5 is considered a positive answer (i.e. a cleavage site is predicted). This model was able to classify correctly 67 of 77 known cleavage sites (87.0%) and 1,358 of 1,372 (99.0%) sites assumed not to be cleaved by the proteinase when testing on independent sites not included when training. The neural network method could thus identify many more of the positive sites with fewer false positives than simple consensus-type methods thereby increasing the classification performance. The Matthews correlation coefficient reached 0.84 for the artificial neural network compared to 0.37, 0.53 and 0.51 for increasingly complex consensus patterns ('LQ', 'LQ [S/A]', ' [T/S/A]X [L/F]Q [S/A/G]' respectively) (Figure 2).",

The protein is the second largest subunit of the RNA polymerase III complex and if this protein is indeed a cellular proteinase target it might cause disruption of the RNA polymerase III complex upon infection with a coronavirus. A similar disruption would be expected in case of a cleavage of the largest subunit of the complex (RPA1_HUMAN) which also has a predicted cleavage site (at position 329, score 0.704). It agrees with findings that poliovirus disrupts RNA polymerase III function, although this occurs through cleavage of transcription factor IIIC and not the polymerase subunits themselves [18-20]. Several well-known transcription factors contain potential cleavage sites. The highest scoring is CREB-RP (AT6B_HUMAN) with a predicted cleavage site at Gln358 (0.916) close to the DNA binding leucine zipper motif. This is in agreement with findings from picornavirus 3Cpro proteinase although at a different position in the sequence [21].
