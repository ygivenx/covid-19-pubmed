One of the most famous examples of such a zoonotic pathogen is HIV, which is thought to have spread to humans after hunters and butchers in Africa came into contact with the meat of primates infected with SIV, a closely related simian virus. However, monkeys and apes are only one potential reservoir for new human diseases. Just last month, for example, scientists pinpointed camels as the direct source of the virus responsible for Middle East respiratory syndrome3,4, a new disease that has claimed more than 300 lives since it was discovered in 2012. Bats, rodents and various other mammals host a large number of emerging diseases, too.",

The researchers\u2014including Ian Lipkin, director of the Center for Infection and Immunity at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health in New York, and Jonna Mazet, executive director of the One Health Institute at the University of California\u2013Davis\u2014extrapolated those results and came up with a minimum estimate of 320,000 mammalian viruses that await discovery, any of which could conceivably be responsible for the next human pandemic5.

But Goldberg emphasizes the need to focus on how the diseases spread: \u201cI'm deeply excited by pathogen discovery\u2014I love it and I do it in my lab\u2014but I think it needs a complementary approach from the ecological and social sciences,\u201d Goldberg says. \u201cWe should strive to ramp up pathway discovery now that we are in this golden age of pathogen discovery. Together, the two approaches will give us the information we really need.\u201d",
