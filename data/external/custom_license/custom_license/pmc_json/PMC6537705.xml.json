We collected blood samples from 45 healthy and 25 ill foxes. We subjected the tissue samples from dead animals, including the brains, lungs, spleens, kidneys, livers, intestines, hearts, and stomachs, to hematoxylin and eosin staining. Microscopic examination confirmed the presence of typical lesions in cerebral cortices with mild neuronal degeneration and inflammatory cell infiltration in vessels, as well as severe hemorrhagic pneumonia, congestion, and hemorrhage with a large number of erythrocytes in the alveolar space (Figure) (1). No obvious lesions were found in other organs.",
