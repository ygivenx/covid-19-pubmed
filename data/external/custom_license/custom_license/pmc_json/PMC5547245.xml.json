Researchers have explored the correlations between Google Trends (Google Inc, CA) data on mental health (eg, regarding suicide, depression, bipolar disorder, and nonsuicidal self-injury) and public statistics or other gold standards [11-16]. They investigated the potential for utilizing search volumes on specific terms that researchers had defined as representative mental health terms to monitor and prevent mental health problems. Several studies have analyzed the sentiments and content of SNS postings by depressed users. Park et al [17] found that depressed users tended to use negative sentiment words and express anger as compared with nondepressed users in their tweets. Additionally, depressed users had recorded their personal information, such as treatment history of depression, on Twitter. De Choudhury et al confirmed the possibility of using SNS data for understanding depression in individuals [18] and populations [19]. They collected data on depression from Twitter and identified the different characteristics (eg, language, sentiment, social activity) of depressed users versus nondepressed users. These studies focused on determining the sentiment of postings according to the frequency of words conveying sentiment to measure or predict depression. Although De Choudhury et al developed a lexicon of terms representing depression to analyze the content of depression that people talk about on Twitter, the topics of the lexicon were limited to the symptoms of depression and antidepressants only. To analyze the public\u2019s feelings, thoughts, and behavior regarding mental health (as expressed on SNSs) thoroughly, we need a model of related concepts and terms that the public use as an analytical framework.",

However, Konovalov et al did not develop a terminology including various natural language terms, and this made text mining more difficult.

Multiple nominal logistic regression, decision tree (chi-square automatic interaction detection, CHAID), and association rules were conducted to identify factors affecting the sentiments of adolescent depression. Multiple nominal logistic regression was used to determine the degree to which changes in sign and symptom classes affect sentiments toward adolescent depression. A decision tree was used to identify the sentiments of adolescent depression, given the values of several sign and symptom classes were represented by the path from the root to the leaf. The association rules was used for discovering relations between two or more classes present in a Web-based document or post [27].

The ontology developed in this study differs significantly from the depression ontologies designed previously [28,29]. First, the ontology developed herein included unique factors of adolescent depression that existing depression ontologies had not identified. For example, adolescent depression is affected not only by individual characteristics but also by environmental factors such as the family, school, and community surrounding the adolescent [30]. Existing depression ontologies have defined environmental factors as the physical environment (eg, climate, noise, and pollution), social environment (eg, conflict, abuse, and discrimination), and financial environment (eg, income) broadly. Although these socioenvironmental factors vary according to the family, school, and community, existing ontologies did not reflect these various types of environmental factors accurately. In this study, we have broken down socioenvironmental factors into family, school, and community levels to describe risk factors of, and interventions for, adolescent depression in more detail. For example, abuse, one of the socioenvironmental factors, was subdivided into \u201cabuse by parents,\u201d \u201cabuse by teacher,\u201d and \u201cabuse by friend.\u201d We also included unique symptoms of adolescent depression such as poor school performance, delinquency, and truancy in the ontology.",

Nevertheless, since sentiment phrases can be represented using an adolescent depression ontology with domain-specific knowledge, errors in assigning sentiment will be reduced. To identify factors affecting sentiments of adolescent depression, 31 signs and symptoms classes were used as independent variables in logistic regression and data mining such as decision tree and association rules. Terminology played a crucial role in identifying synonyms of signs and symptoms classes appearing in the postings.

For example , this ontology can be used as a basis for a meaningful health care decision-making system for depression management in adolescents. The ontology-based adolescent depression management system can identify the symptoms an adolescent has, determine the depression subtypes and diagnostics, and recommend treatment options. Additionally, because classes of the ontology are represented with the EAV triplet, it is possible for health care providers to collect and document data on adolescent depression in more detail using the ontology.",

A terminology with extensive synonyms played a very important role in an analytical framework for SNS data, since this study analyzed natural language texts posted by adolescents and featuring slang and abbreviations. Each class in the ontology was modeled according to the EAV triplet structure, so the ontology can be used for adolescent depression\u2013related sentiment analysis. Description logics between classes were evaluated by mapping concepts extracted from the answers to the FAQs onto ontology concepts derived from description logics queries. The applicability of the ontology was evaluated by sentiment phrases represented by EAV triplets and by sentiment analyses of social media data conducted using the classes in the ontology. The ontology provides an analytical framework for the analysis of SNS data and thereby could improve the accuracy of interpretations of phenomena uncovered by SNS data analysis. However, it is important for the terminology to be updated regularly to reflect the rapidly changing terms used by adolescents in social media postings.",
