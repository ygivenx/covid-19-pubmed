In 2012, another novel coronavirus, termed Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), emerged in the Middle East3. MERS-CoV infection results in SARS-like disease with multiorgan failure4. As of 11 November 2013, WHO had been informed of 153 confirmed cases, including 64 deaths (a case fatality rate of 42%)5. The reports of clusters that have occurred among family contacts or in health-care settings have indicated its person-to-person transmissibility through close contacts, raising concerns over its pandemic potential3,6,7,8. Therefore, it is essential to identify the drug targets in the life cycle of MERS-CoV, and in turn, to develop anti-MERS therapeutics to treat patients with MERS-CoV infection and combat any potential pandemic.",

We hypothesized that the S2 subunit of MERS-CoV would then change conformation by inserting its fusion peptide into the target cell membrane, forming a six-bundle (6-HB) fusion core between the heptad repeat 1 and 2 (HR1 and HR2) domains in the S2 subunit, thus bringing the viral and cell membranes into close apposition to facilitate fusion, and, in turn, releasing the viral genetic materials into the cytoplasm19,20. If this hypothesis is proven, then the HR1 in the 6-HB could serve as a target for developing MERS-CoV fusion inhibitors, like those against HIV infection, such as the peptides SJ-2176 and T20 (enfuvirtide)21,22,23.",

Here we further compared the 6-HB core structures of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV with those of MHV and hCoV-NL63 since the fusion core structures of hCoV-229E and TGEV are not available in PDB. The fusion core of MERS-CoV adopts a similar fold as that of SARS-CoV (Fig. 2d), but it is different from those of MHV and hCoV-NL63 (Fig. 3). In the MHV structure, a single-turn \u03b1-helix could be observed in the N-terminal region of HR2, which could not be found in MERS-CoV and other coronaviruses. In the hCoV-NL63 structure, the HR2 segment forms regular helices packing against the central HR1 core, especially in the C-terminal region of HR2, which is quite different from the HR2 of MERS-CoV. In contrast, the 6-HB core structure of MERS-CoV S protein could be superimposed on that of SARS-CoV S protein with a root mean square deviation of 0.61 \u00c5 for the 63 C\u03b1 atoms of three HR1 helices (Fig. 2d). Besides the HR2 helices, the N- and C-terminal tail regions of HR2 share similar conformations between MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, indicating that the tail regions interact with the hydrophobic grooves in a conserved manner in addition to the highly conserved 6-HB.",

Since native polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis (N-PAGE) is under nondenaturing conditions and has been successfully used for testing the formation of 6-HB core structures in other class 1 fusion proteins20,33,34, we used N-PAGE to investigate whether HR1P could interact with HR2P to form 6-HB. Similar to the HR1 peptides from SARS-CoV S protein and HIV-1 gp4120,33,34, HR1P alone showed no band in the gel (lane 1, Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 9a) since it carries net positive charges and thus moves up and off the gel under the native electrophoresis condition. HR2P alone exhibited a band at the lower position in the gel (lane 2, Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 9a), while the mixture of HR1P/HR2P showed a new band at the upper position in the gel (lane 3, Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 9a), which is expected to be the oligomeric complex formed by HR1P and HR2P. However, we could not judge whether or not this oligomeric complex was a 6-HB since the migration speed of a molecule or a complex in N-PAGE depends on both the net charge and the size. It was reported that the 6-HB complexes formed by HR1 and HR2 of MHV-A59 and SARS-CoV are stable under SDS\u2013PAGE condition without heating the samples at 100 \u00b0C before loading35. Accordingly, we analysed the HR1P and HR2P peptides, as well as their mixture, using 15% SDS polyacrylamide protein gel (NEXT GEL, Amersco). The result showed that HR1P and HR2P migrated in the gel to a location corresponding to a molecular weight of 3\u20134 kDa, while the HR1P/HR2P complex migrated to a position corresponding to a molecular mass of ~26 kDa. The theoretical mass of the 6-HB formed by HR1P and HR2P is 25.8 kDa (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 9b). These results therefore suggest that HR1P could interact with HR2P to form a 6-HB.",

The 293T cells expressing EGFP only (293T/EGFP) were included as the control. After 293T/MERS/EGFP cells and Huh-7 cells were co-cultured at 37 \u00b0C for 4 h, the number of 293T/MERS/EGFP cells fused with Huh-7 cells was counted, and the percent inhibition of a peptide on MERS-CoV S protein-mediated cell\u2013cell fusion was calculated (see Methods). We found that Huh-7 cells could not fuse with 293T/EGFP cells in the absence of MERS-CoV S protein expression, while they could effectively fuse with 293T/MERS/EGFP cells. The fusion between Huh-7 and 293T/MERS/EGFP cells was significantly blocked by HR2P at 10 \u03bcM (Fig. 5a). The MERS-CoV S protein-mediated cell\u2013cell fusion at the early stage (4 h) could not be observed under an inverted microscope with visible light (Fig. 5a). Forty-eight hours later, many more Huh-7 cells could fuse with 293T/MERS/EGFP cells to form big syncytia, which could be easily observed under both fluorescence and light microscopes (Fig. 5b), while no syncytium was shown when Huh-7 cells were co-cultured with 293T/EGFP cells and when HR2P peptide was presented in the Huh-7 and 293T/MERS/EGFP cell co-culture (Fig. 5b).",

One of the explanations is that like HIV-1, MERS-CoV enters the host cell primarily through plasma membrane fusion, while SARS-CoV gets into its target cells perhaps mainly via endosomal membrane fusion. Chan et al.37 have observed that syncytial formation is very prominent in MERS-CoV-infected cell cultures, while it was not found in SARS-CoV-infected cell cultures. In this study, the co-culture of 293T cells expressing MERS-CoV S protein and Huh-7 cells carrying DPP4 exhibited significant cell\u2013cell fusion and syncytial formation (Fig. 5). Chan et al.37 have also shown that human lung adenocarcinoma cell line, Calu-3 and embryonic lung fibroblast cell line HFL are highly susceptible to MERS-CoV infection. Interestingly, however, MERS-CoV-infected Calu-3 can form significant syncytia, whereas MERS-CoV-infected HFL cells cannot, suggesting that MERS-CoV may enter these cells through different pathways. In the present study, we tested the inhibitory activity of HR2P peptide in Calu-3 and HFL cells and found that HR2P could inhibit MERS-CoV infection in Calu-3 cells just as effectively as Vero cells, while HR2P was about 22-fold less effective in inhibiting MERS-CoV infection in HFL cells. These findings suggest that MERS-CoV enters into Calu-3 and Vero cells mainly through the plasma membrane fusion route, and, as a result, it is particularly sensitive to inhibition by MERS-CoV fusion inhibitor HR2P, while the virus might enter HFL cells mainly via endocytosis route and, hence, would be relatively resistant to blockade by HR2P peptide.",

After uptake of the virus into endosomes, MERS-CoV S protein is activated by pH-dependent cysteine protease Cathepsin L. Therefore, cathepsin L inhibitor is expected to stop lysosomal entry of the virus after uptake by endocytosis. While TMPRSS2 activates the S protein close to the cell surface, its inhibitor may stop the uptake by direct fusion between viral and cytoplasmic membranes. Since the cell\u2013cell fusion depends on the direct membrane fusion without preceding endocytoisis and endosomal uptake, it is expected that cathepsin L inhibitors will not interfere with the cell\u2013cell fusion, but TMPRSS2 inhibitors may do it. Therefore, it will be interesting to determine whether cell type-specific differences in susceptibility to inhibition by the fusion inhibitors correlate with differences in susceptibility to inhibition by cathepsin L and TMPRSS2 inhibitors as well as HR1-targeted fusion inhibitors.",

            "text": "By comparing the 6-HB core structures of the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV S proteins, we noted that obvious differences of some critical residues in their protein sequences might influence the detailed interactions. First, the residues Q1020/D1024 in HR1 domain of MERS-CoV S2 are able to form hydrogen bond, which may increase the stability of the HR1-trimer48. However, the corresponding residues G928/D932 in the HR1 domain of SARS-CoV S2 subunit (PDB ID: 1WYY) are incapable of forming this strong interaction (Supplementary Fig. 6)28. Second, the binding between D1261 and T1263 and between E1278 and K1274 in HR2 domain of MERS-CoV S2 subunit is stronger than that between Q1161 and N1159 and between E1276 and K1172 in the HR2 domain of SARS-CoV S2 subunit, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 7), suggesting that these two hydrogen bonds in MERS-CoV S2 subunit provide force to stabilize the HR2 helix conformation49. Third, there is a hydrogen bond between Q1009 in HR1 and Y1280 in HR2 in MERS-CoV S2, while the corresponding residues Q917 in HR1 and L1178 in HR2 in the SARS-CoV S2 are unable to form the intermolecular hydrogen bond (Supplementary Fig. 8). All these findings suggest that the association between the viral HR1 and HR2 domains in MERS-CoV S2 may be stronger than that found in SARS-CoV S2. Consequently, the HR2 peptide of MERS-CoV S2 may have higher binding affinity and hence higher antiviral activity than the corresponding HR2 peptide of SARS-CoV S2 subunit.",

We thus designed and synthesized two HR2P mutants, HR2P-M1 and HR2P-M2, with 2 and 7 mutations, respectively, some of which could form intramolecular salt-bridges at the i to i+4 or at the i to i+3 arrangements (Fig. 2). Indeed, both HR2P-M1 and HR2P-M2 and their complexes with HR1P peptide are more stable than HR2P peptide. The water-solubility of HR2P-M1 and HR2P-M2 is ~68-fold and 1,786-fold higher than the HR2P peptide, respectively. Their anti-MERS-CoV activity is moderately improved (Table 2). These results are consistent with those obtained by Otaka et al.40, who found that the anti-HIV-1 HR2 peptide C34 with EK mutation (SC34EK) displayed significantly improved stability and water solubility, and moderately improved anti-HIV-1 activity, compared with the wild-type C34 peptide, confirming that this approach can also be used to improve stability, solubility and antiviral activity of HR2 peptides derived from MERS-CoV S protein. Nevertheless, other approaches, such as replacement of the natural amino acids in an HR2 peptide with nonnatural amino acids (for example, D-amino acids) or addition of cholesterol or fatty acid to an HR2 peptide50,51 may also be used to extend the half-life of the MERS-CoV HR2 peptide.",
