However, WHO Director-General Lee Jong-wook cautioned that there was still a lot of work to do to meet the targets set for 2005. If current trends continue, the case detection rate in 2005 is expected to be 50%, some way short of the target of 70%. The 2005 targets are an important milestone towards achieving the Millennium Development Goal of halving the global burden of TB by 2015. Progress is being made however \u2014 3 million individuals are now enrolled in DOTS (directly observed treatment, short course) programmes worldwide, an increase of 1 million compared with 2001.

Circulating antibodies to human SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and/or animal SARS CoV-like virus were detected in 17 serum samples collected from 938 healthy adults in 2001. The authors speculate that the viruses circulating in 2001 are antigenically closer to the animal SARS CoV-like virus than the human SARS Co-V and failed to adapt successfully to a human host. CDC",

Nathan Wolfe and colleagues investigated the transmission of simian foamy virus (SFV) from animals to humans in rural villages in Cameroon. Of the 1,800 participants in the study, 1,099 (61%) were regularly exposed to the blood and body fluids of non-human primates through the hunting and butchering of these animals. SFV antibodies were detected in 1% of this group. This study demonstrates that retroviruses are actively being transmitted to humans in natural settings and has lent weight to calls for a ban on the trading of bushmeat. The Lancet",

Baytril, which is manufactured by Bayer, was banned as part of the October 2000 FDA ruling that outlawed the use of fluoroquinolones in poultry feed, in response to growing concern that the intensive use of antibiotics in livestock contributes to the spread of antibiotic resistance in bacteria. The judge cited 'serious questions about the safety of Baytril use in poultry'. Bayer plan to lodge a final appeal with the FDA commissioner. If the commissioner also backs the decision, Baytril could be banned by June.",
