            "text": "The meninges are formed by three tissue membranes that primarily provide protective covering to the central nervous system (CNS). They comprise of the outer dura matter, middle arachnoid matter, and inner pia matter that consist of different cell populations including the fibroblasts, mast cells, endodermal cells, and smooth muscle cells [1]. The arachnoid and the pia matter, together called as leptomeninges, harbor a large population of fibroblasts [2]. Meningeal fibroblasts are known to have important role in blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) formation, glial scar formation during injury response, angiogenesis, and early astrocyte activation [3, 4]. In adult CNS, the meninges cover and penetrate the neural tissue deeply at every level of its organization: as large projections between the major brain structures, as stroma of the choroid plexus, and as sheaths of blood vessels forming the perivascular space. They also form the roof of the lateral ventricles, the third and the fourth ventricles. Their widespread distribution and complex organization suggest a more important role of the meninges as modulator of brain function in addition to being a mere protective covering of the brain. A further indication that the meninges are functionally linked to the neural tissue is the presence of gap junction proteins called connexins (Cxs).",

            "text": "Gap junctions (GJs) are intercellular channels that allow exchange of small molecules (less than 1 kDa) including small glucose derivatives [5], and second messengers such as ATP, cyclic AMP, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, and Ca+2 [6\u20138] between coupled cells. GJs are composed of two hemichannels each contributed by the two opposing cells. The hemichannels or connexons are formed by six Cx protein subunits which after synthesis and oligomerization in endoplasmic reticulum/endoplasmic reticulum Golgi intermediate complex are trafficked to the cell surface where they are mostly assembled into gap junction plaques. Cx proteins, mainly Cx43, Cx30, and Cx26, have been found in the meninges and in their projections into the brain, including meningeal sheaths of blood vessels and stroma of the choroid plexus [9\u201313]. The distribution of these proteins suggests the existence of anatomical and functional interactions between meningeal cells, meningeal perivascular cells, ependymocytes, and astrocytes, thus providing a rapid means to spread signals in physiological and pathological events.",

            "text": "Cx43, the most abundantly expressed Cx in the CNS, is also highly expressed by the meningeal fibroblasts [13]. Recent findings suggest that Cx43-mediated functional coupling between the astrocytes and in the panglial system is altered in various neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease, ischemia, and multiple sclerosis (MS) [14\u201317]. Additionally, neuroinfections caused by Borna virus, bovine papillomavirus, Rous sarcoma virus, and human influenza virus can alter Cx-mediated gap junction communication [18\u201322]. Our previous studies have demonstrated that mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infection significantly reduces Cx43 expression and functional gap junction formation in mice brain and in cultured astrocytes [23]. MHV-A59, a neurotropic strain of the coronavirus, causes meningitis and encephalitis in acute infection followed by demyelination and concurrent axonal loss in chronic stage of infection, serving as a model to study certain pathology of virus-induced meningitis and the human CNS-demyelinating disease MS [24, 25]. Although earlier reports suggest that MHV infection causes loss of Cx43 expression and negatively affects gap junction communication in the brain, particularly in astrocytes, at present, very little is known about virus-induced alterations of Cx channels in meningeal fibroblasts. This is particularly important in injury-induced brain parenchymal reaction, where GJs in the astrocyte\u2013fibroblast interface play an important role in reforming glial limitans that forms a part of the BBB. Moreover, Cx proteins of BBB have been shown to regulate BBB permeability in inflammatory conditions [26]. In the present study, we investigated the expression and cellular distribution of Cx43 in MHV-A59-infected mouse brain meningeal cells. In parallel, we have established an in vitro model of viral meningitis by infecting fibroblast-enriched primary meningeal cultures with MHV to understand the effect of viral infection on Cx43-mediated gap junction communication in meningeal fibroblasts. Our findings provide important insights in understanding the role of glial-pial GJIC in altered barrier function of the inflamed brain.",

Therefore, to investigate the effect of viral infection on Cx43 expression and distribution in the infected meningeal cells of MHV-A59-infected mouse brains, we performed double-immunolabeling with a combination of anti-Cx43 and anti-viral nucleocapsid (N; Fig. 2a\u2013l) or anti-vimentin antibody (Fig. 3a\u2013l). Our results clearly showed that MHV-A59 infection altered the expression pattern of Cx43 in infected meningeal cells.

Purity of the primary cultures was first determined by flow cytometry, using vimentin as fibroblast marker [1] and GFAP as astrocyte marker (Fig. 4a). Viable cell population (P1) was normalized for each marker expression with isotype controls. As expected, majority of the cells (92.4%) in our established cultures were vimentin-positive meningeal fibroblasts. In addition, a small population (0.04%) of the cells were found to be GFAP-positive, and a few (1.83%) were positive for both GFAP and vimentin and probably represents stem/progenitor cells with a potential to differentiate to either astrocytes or fibroblasts at a later stage in culture. Supporting this, our double-immunostaining of primary meningeal cultures with anti-GFAP and anti-vimentin antibodies also showed that most of the cells in cultures expressed vimentin only (Fig. 4b, arrows). However, a few GFAP-positive and GFAP and vimentin dual positive cells were also observed. Visual counting of the cells from three independent cultures (with 30 different fields from each set) demonstrated that about 74.83% cells were positive for vimentin only, while 4.6% cells expressed GFAP only and 11.7% stained for both markers (Fig. 4c). Additionally, we also quantified the vimentin expression in our primary meningeal cultures. Our immunoblotting experiments clearly showed that the primary meningeal cultures expressed a significantly higher level of the fibroblast marker vimentin compared to mixed glial cultures demonstrating the enrichment for meningeal fibroblasts in the primary cultures (Fig. 4d).",

Interestingly, most of these intracellular Cx43 puncta in MHV-infected cultures was found to co-localize with the endoplasmic reticulum marker, calnexin (Fig. 6a\u2013f).",

Moreover, our immunofluorescence studies also suggest a possible reduction in total Cx43 levels in vimentin-labeled cells of virus-infected mouse brains and altered cellular distribution in primary meningeal fibroblasts. To quantify the observed change, we measured total Cx43 levels in primary meningeal cultures infected with MHV-A59. Cx43 levels were found to be significantly downregulated in the infected cultures compared to control (\u2212 50.50 \u00b1 10.77%; p < 0.01) (Fig. 7a; lower panel). To determine if reduced Cx43 expression together with its increased intracellular retention affected functional gap junction communication in infected meningeal cells, we performed LY dye transfer in a scrape-loading assay. Cx43 channels are permeable to LY, a small molecular dye that moves from cells to the neighboring cells via gap junctions [34]. Primary meningeal fibroblasts were either mock-infected or infected with MHV-A59 and gap junction activity was assayed by scrape-loading dye transfer 24 h p.i. MHV-A59 infection prevented cultured meningeal fibroblasts from transferring the dye to neighboring cells, as the distance of dye spread beyond the injured cells at the scratch boundary was significantly less compared to the control cultures (Fig.7b). Control meningeal fibroblasts exhibited active gap junction communication, while infected fibroblasts displayed less gap junction communication, as evident from shorter dye travel distance (control: 287.5 \u00b1 24.35 \u03bcm vs. infected: 139.8 \u00b1 5.19 \u03bcm; p < 0.0001) (Fig. 7b; lower panel).",

In order to understand the assembly of Cx43 into plaques, mock- and MHV-A59-infected cells were treated in situ with 1% Triton X-100 at 4 \u00b0C, 24 h p.i., and double immunofluorescence labelling was performed for anti-Cx43 and anti-vimentin (Fig. 8a\u2013i) or anti-N (Fig. 8j\u2013l). Interestingly, Triton X-100 solubilization resulted in a marked decrease in Cx43 staining in mock-infected cultures compared to non-Triton X-100-treated experimental controls (Fig. 8a\u2013f). This might be because intracellular soluble monomers of Cx43 were extracted by Triton X-100 treatment leaving behind the Cx43 puncta that were assembled in gap junction plaques and resistant to Triton X-100 solubilization. In contrast, MHV-infected meningeal fibroblasts showed mostly intracellular accumulation of Cx43 in the perinuclear region (Fig. 8g\u2013l; arrows in h, i, k, and l). This might be due to aggregation of misfolded protein or increased amount of prematurely oligomerized and Triton X-100-resistant Cx43 that failed to traffic to the cell surface to form gap junction plaques.",

In addition, it has been shown that ER stress-mediated unfolded protein response can result in downregulation of Cx43 expression at both mRNA and protein levels [39]. Thus, it is also possible that MHV-induced ER stress can lead to accumulation of misfolded Cx43 in the perinuclear compartments, subsequently leading to downregulation of Cx43 expression and reduced trafficking to cell surface. This is further supported by our Triton X-100 solubilization experiment showing that infected cells have increased intracellular accumulation of Cx43 in the perinuclear region that was not extracted by Triton X-100 treatment. In contrast, the control cells showed Cx43 puncta only at the cell surface present in gap junction plaques and no intracellular monomers that were supposedly removed by the Triton X-100.",

Interestingly, Cx43 is also known to directly bind to microtubules [41] and transported to the cell surface along microtubules as conduit [42]. Thus, virus transport using the cellular microtubule network might possibly hinder microtubule-dependent Cx43 trafficking to the cell surface. In this regard, our previous studies have shown that depolymerization of the microtubule network by colchicine in primary astrocytes can lead to similar retention of Cx43 in the perinuclear compartments as in virus-infected cells [23]. Thus, it is possible that virus-specific utilization of the microtubules in the infected meningeal fibroblasts resulted in reduced trafficking and assembly of Cx subunits into GJ plaques causing loss of gap junctional communication. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to understand the underlying regulatory mechanisms of Cx43 association with the microtubule network in infected meningeal cells and its oligomerization into gap junction plaques.",

It is reported that meningeal cells can communicate with astrocytes via Ca2+ signaling [43]. Interestingly, ablation of astrocytic Cx30 has been shown to cause nearly complete depletion of Cx26 immunoreactivity in leptomeninges [11]. Moreover, the meninges are important in maintaining the functional coupling among the glia limitans astrocytes, which are more coupled than the astrocytes in the molecular layer [44]. During injury-induced parenchymal reaction, reactive astrocytes and the meningeal cells form a glia\u2013fibroblast interface that forms new basal lamina which along with astrocytic endfeet reforms the glial limitans [45, 46]. This process is crucial for restoring the BBB function and re-establishing CNS homeostasis. Thus, Cx channels play an important role in maintaining BBB function, and loss of these junctional communications might affect BBB permeability. The effect of Cx43 on BBB may be mediated via tight junction proteins such as claudin, occludin, and zona occludens (ZO-1). There are reports of Cx43 interacting with tight junction protein ZO-1 through its carboxyl terminus [47]. The PDZ domain of ZO-1 serves to recruit several signaling molecules and also provides anchorage to several cytoskeletal elements. Moreover, the dynamic association of ZO-1 with Cx43 also modulates the stability of gap junction channel and regulates its internalization and endosomal turnover [48]. ZO-1 and other tight junction proteins are reported to be downregulated in BBB leakage during different pathological conditions [49]. Hence, the virus-induced retention of Cx43 might alter the stability of membrane resident tight junction proteins and disrupt the BBB integrity.",

Such loss of junctional communication might have a potential role in modulating coupling between fibroblasts of the meningeal layer and at fibroblast\u2013astrocyte interface of glial limitans superficialis subsequently leading to altered BBB function.",
