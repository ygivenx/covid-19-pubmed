            "text": "It is well known that fungal infection results in serious damage to crops throughout the world. Antifungal proteins have captured the attention of a number of researchers on account of their tremendous potential in protecting crops from invading fungi and thus important economic implication. Antifungal proteins may contribute to both defense against predators such as insects [1] as well as pathogens such as fungi [2, 3]. It is well identified that there is a spectacular diversity of antifungal proteins produced by the leguminous plants. Some of these proteins and peptides have been classified into different groups based on their structure and/or functions [4]. Sometimes, a combination of antifungal proteins is found in a single species of bean. For instance, proteins and peptides such as lysozyme, non-specific lipid transfer protein, and protease inhibitor were isolated from mung bean, and all have fungi inhibition activity [2, 3, 5].",

            "text": "Protease inhibitors have drawn the attention of a number of investigators due to their potential significance. HIV protease inhibitors and SARS coronavirus proteinase inhibitors may be used to fight against HIV and SARS virus, respectively, [6]. Plant protease inhibitors may be involved in the regulation of programed cell death in plants. They show insecticidal and antifungal activities and also can cause inhalant allergies and food allergies [3, 7]. One of the common types of protease inhibitors is trypsin inhibitors which have been isolated from animal tissues and also from plant tissues [7, 8]. There are several types of plant trypsin inhibitors. Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitors have a molecular mass of about 20 kDa, a low cysteine content and a single reactive site while Bowman\u2013Birk trypsin inhibitors are approximately 8 kDa in size and possess a high cysteine content and two reactive sites [9, 10]. The conformation in Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitors is mainly \u03b2 sheet with a small amount of regular sheet. The insecticidal activity of Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitors has been demonstrated using transgenic plants [8]. Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitors also inhibit other enzymes such as chymotrypsin, a-amylase and human plasmin, and block the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin [7]. Soy bean (Glycine max) produced both Bowman\u2013Birk and Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitors [11]. The formation, degradation, and gene expression of Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitor in the soy bean have also been reported [7]. The seeds of bitter gourds, sponge gourds, wax gourds, and Momordica cochinchinensis produce squash-type trypsin inhibitors with a molecular mass of about 3 kDa [12].",

It usually serves as a healthy food because of the abundant proteins and peptides it produces. Proteins such as a chitinase [13], a peroxidase [14], and a defense peptide [15] have previously been reported from large lima bean, the three bioactive substances all exhibiting antifungal activity to varying degrees. We present herein a novel trypsin-chymotrypsin inhibitor, designated Limenin, from the large lima bean (Phaseolus limensis) legume, which exerts both antifungal activity against a range of fungal species as well as antiproliferative activity on tumor cells. Its N-terminal amino acid sequence bears resemblance to those of protease inhibitors from other leguminous plants but has not previously been reported from Phaseolus limensis.",
