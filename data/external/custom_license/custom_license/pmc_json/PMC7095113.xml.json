Some of the researchers and officials who operated the programme, such as Ken Alibek, Igor Domaradskii and Serguei Popov, have provided personal accounts that shed light on the clandestine system. However, the compartmentalization and secrecy so prevalent in the former Soviet Union mean that such accounts describe only a fraction of the nation's bioweapons programme. Almost nothing is known about the biological-warfare activities of the Soviet ministries of defence, health and agriculture, the security agencies and the national academies.",

So, what do we learn from it?",

One of the responsibilities of this department was to oversee \u2018illegals\u2019 \u2014 Russian intelligence operatives masquerading as Western nationals. Illegals were deployed to spy on Western biodefence activities, procure microbiological agents of interest for Soviet bioweapons research and development, and to perform acts of bioterrorism and sabotage. Kouzminov was a case handler for several illegals, including some that allegedly worked in a UK institute and at the World Health Organization (WHO). He repeatedly asserts that these illegals provided the Soviet Union with \u201csignificant\u201d information.",

He describes how Westerners were targeted for recruitment by the KGB, and discusses the recruitment process and the means whereby data collected by agents and illegals were transported from the West to the Soviet Union. These procedures have previously been described by defectors and students of the Soviet intelligence system, and Kouzminov's book adds little to the story already in the public domain. Disappointingly, it provides almost no information on how the KGB transformed the data into intelligence, and how this was then used.",

For example, he describes a husband-and-wife team who, while operating a mock medical practice in Germany, were told by the KGB \u201cto establish the locations of all NATO installations; their command personnel...air-force bases, and cruise-missile and rocket sites\u201d. It is doubtful that two individuals could accomplish all this. And Kouzminov's explanation that the KGB placed agents in the WHO to obtain information about the \u201cdevelopment of vaccines against the most dangerous human and animal viral diseases\u201d seems rather lame, given that anyone could obtain this information simply by telephoning WHO representatives.",

What did these agents do? Did they provide information about US and UK defensive efforts that might be used by the Soviet bioweapons programme? Did they inform their superiors that neither country actually had an offensive programme? Perhaps they provided information on the development of vaccines that might have been useful to the Soviet defensive programme?",

For example, he alleges that the Soviets used B. anthracis and F. tularensis against German troops in the Second World War \u2014 an often-repeated story that has not been verified but has been discounted by microbiologists on the basis of epidemiological analyses. Kouzminov also asserts that Soviet agents obtained marburgvirus samples by exhuming victims of the first recorded outbreak of marburgvirus disease in Germany in 1967. But documentation of the official exchange of marburgvirus strains between German and Soviet microbiology institutes is publicly available.",

If Kouzminov is to be believed, almost every outbreak of a new or emerging infectious disease in the past 15 years \u2014 including the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in Britain in 2001 and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic in 2003 \u2014 may have been either a deliberate bioweapons attack or an accidental release of a genetically engineered microbe from a bioweapons facility. He also implies that the causative agents of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome were genetically engineered specifically to attack Native Americans. That allegations such as these would be made by a professional scientist in the face of a huge body of literature that seems to contradict them is astonishing.",
