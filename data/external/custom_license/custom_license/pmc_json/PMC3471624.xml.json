ELISA results indicated nucleocapsid protein antibodies against influenza in samples from macaques from Cambodia (29.2%), Singapore (16.7%), Sulawesi (16.1%), Bangladesh (13.3%), and Java (6.0%) (Table 1). Antibodies were detected in animals 1\u201310 years of age at the time of sampling. No influenza virus\u2013specific antibodies were detected from the 73 total samples from Gibraltar, perhaps because persons with influenza virus infection infrequently travel to the Upper Rock Reserve (healthy-visitor effect) (10) or perhaps because monkeys from Gibraltar are less susceptible to infection. Seroprevalence of antibodies against influenza A, by site and collection year, human and NHP population densities, and prevalence of avian influenza viruses are shown in Figure 2.",

Based on the year and location of NHP sample collection, the estimated ages of the NHPs at the time of sample collection, and the presence of avian H5 and H9 influenza viruses in many of these countries during the sampling period (11\u201313), a panel of human vaccine strains and avian influenza virus strains was used in the hemagglutination-inhibition assay. Although not all ELISA-positive serum samples could be subtyped, antibodies against seasonal subtype H1N1 and H3N2 influenza A strains were detected from macaques in Bangladesh, Singapore, Java, and Sulawesi (Table 2). Of the performing macaques in Bangladesh, 2 had antibodies against A/chicken/Bangladesh/5473/2010, a strain of G1 clade subtype H9N2 avian influenza virus. Subtype H9N2 influenza viruses are prevalent in poultry in Bangladesh (14) and have been detected in humans (12). We did not detect antibodies against highly pathogenic avian influenza subtype H5 viruses, which might not be surprising given our relatively small sample size (Table 2). Also given the small sample size, we were unable to perform microneutralization studies, which would be useful to perform with future samples.",

In brief, the inside of the anesthetized and immobilized monkeys\u2019 mouths (cheeks, tongue, and gums) were swabbed. Swabs were immediately placed into viral transport media, stored, and shipped as previously described. RNA was isolated by using an Ambion MagMAX-96 AI/ND Viral RNA Isolation Kit (Life Technologies Corporation, Grand Island, NY, USA) on a Kingfisher Flex system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Viral RNA was analyzed in a Bio-Rad CFX96 Real-Time PCR Detection System and a C1000 Thermocycler (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) with TaqMan Fast Virus 1-Step Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and the InfA primer/probe sets as described (15). Of the 48 respiratory samples, 1 (2.1%) was positive for influenza virus; cycle threshold value was 38 (limit of detection is 40). Attempts to amplify longer PCR fragments of matrix, hemagglutinin, or neuraminidase genes or to isolate the virus by blind passage in embryonated chicken eggs or MDCK cells were unsuccessful.",

We found serologic evidence of infection in several countries, contexts, and macaque species. Preliminary real-time reverse transcription PCR results also pointed to the presence of virus in a buccal swab from an adult macaque from Cambodia, indicating active infection at the time of sampling. On the basis of results from this study, it seems that pet, performing, and free-ranging macaques are susceptible to influenza virus infection. Given the close relationship between humans and NHPs in areas of the world where avian and human influenza viruses cocirculate, further surveillance of these populations is warranted. The ability to detect and eventually isolate strains of influenza virus currently infecting NHPs and humans at the animal\u2013human interface is paramount to understanding how NHP\u2013human interactions can affect the genetics, transmission, and public health risk for infection with influenza A viruses.",
