            "text": "PCR assays have markedly improved the diagnosis of Human Rhinoviruses (HRV) infections by increasing sensitivity in comparison to traditional cell culture [1]; however, many RT-PCR protocols still are time-consuming. Real-time PCR assays have resulted in improving virus detection and quantification [2]. Rapidity and quantitative results represent important advantages in the diagnostic workup of HRV infection and could be of relevance considering the future potential availability of antiviral agents. Human rhinoviruses are the most common viral agents in humans, being the over 110 serologic types responsible for about 30\u201350% of all the cases of common colds and associated upper respiratory tract complications in both adults and children. Although HRV are generally temperature restricted in replication with optimal growth at 33\u201335\u00b0C, the temperatures observed in the tracheobronchial tree are often lower than body core temperatures, also in relation to external temperature and frequency of ventilation, and so are permissive for HRV replication [3]. Moreover, it has been evidenced that many HRV serotypes can replicate efficiently at core body temperature with modest differences in terms of infectious titres (<0.5\u20131.0 log10 TCID50) [4]. Indeed, several studies have linked HRV infection to illnesses in the lower respiratory tract in immunocompetent patients, including exacerbations of pre-existing airways disease in those with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or cystic fibrosis, and pneumonia and bronchiolitis in children aged <5 years hospitalized for HRV infection [5]. However, a recent study on hospitalized adults with pulmonary disease found a prevalence of HRV in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens of 31.2% without evidencing a significant difference of prevalence in relation to the presence of COPD, pneumonia or acute respiratory illness [6]. In contrast to immunocompetent subjects, HRV clearance in immunocompromised patients may be delayed with prolonged shedding leading to the onset of life-threatening conditions and chronic infections [7\u20139]. Evidence demonstrating that HRV disease is not exclusively limited to the upper airways and may cause lower respiratory complications, together with the frequency of HRV infections and the increasing number of immunocompromised patients, underline the need for including HRV in virological diagnostics of acute lower respiratory tract illness. However, not many laboratories and institutions have adopted HRV diagnostics in the routine clinical use, and limited informations are available on HRV clinical impact in comparison with that of other respiratory viruses.",

Briefly, 2 \u03bcl of cDNA was added to 28 \u03bcl of PCR solution containing buffer 1\u00d7, 6 mM MgCl2, 1 unit recombinant Subtherm DNA polymerase (Sic, Rome, Italy), 200 \u03bcM of each dNTP, 25 \u03bcM of each sense and antisense primer. After an initial denaturation step of 2 min at 94\u00b0C, the first-round PCR amplification was carried out under the following conditions: 95\u00b0C for 0 s, 62\u00b0C for 15 s, 72\u00b0C for 15 s for 35 cycles, then 1 cycle at 72\u00b0C for 7 min using the 9800 Fast Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems). About 20 \u03bcl of PCR product (235 bp) was loaded onto a 4% (W/V) agarose gel containing 0.3 \u03bcg/ml ethidium bromide. The gel was visualized on a UV board. The PCR product was cloned using pTOPO-TA cloning (Invitrogen). Recombinant plasmid was propagated in TOP10 high-efficiency chemically competent cells (Invitrogen) using the heat shock procedure. After overnight culture, selected transformed clones were amplified by culture in liquid LB medium (10 g BACTOTRYPTONE, 5 g yeast extract, 171 mM NaCl, 15 g/l agar, pH 7.5) containing 50 \u03bcg/ml of ampicillin. Plasmid DNA was extracted and purified using the Wizard Plus SV Miniprep DNA Purification System (Promega, Madison, WI). The plasmid concentration was estimated on spectrophotometric reading at OD260. The DNA copy number of the target plasmid was calculated from the molecular weight of the construct (2,722,500 MW) and Avogadro number (6.02 \u00d7 1023). About 1 \u03bcl of target plasmid contained 4.3 \u00d7 1010 DNA copy number. To determine the sensitivity of the PCR assays, stock preparations were diluted to 1 \u00d7 10\u22121 copies/\u03bcl by a series of 10-fold dilutions. The limit of detection is defined the lowest concentration of target quantified, whereas the efficiency of RT-PCR assay was also evaluated and is defined as 10(\u22121/slope) [11].\n",

The actual sensitivity of assay was determined by the lowest standard dilution consistently detectable in replicate reactions at a frequency of 100% and it was found to be of 100 copy/reaction and was linear (quantifiable) up to 101 copies. A standard dilution of 10\u22121 copy/reaction was detected at a frequency of 10%, while that of 10\u22122 copy/reaction at a frequency of 0%. The limit of detection was 10\u22121 copy/reaction. The efficiency of the reaction is considered acceptable if it falls between the range of 1.7 and 2.2 with 2 being ideal. The efficiency of our real-time RT-PCR assays was 2.08.",

The efficiency of viral RNA detection from clinical samples and the possible presence of polymerase inhibitors were monitored by using internal control, as described in the section \u2018Materials and Methods.\u2019 These controls permitted appropriate correction in the calculation of viral copy numbers. For the quantification of viral load, the slope (s) and the y-axis intercept (Y) (the y-axis intercept is the point at which the standard curve intersects with the ordinate; it indicates the theoretical detection limit of the reaction by revealing the Ct expected in the presence of a single target molecule in the sample) of the corresponding standard curve and the Ct of the target virus amplification were used according to the following equation: Po = Inverse log(Ct \u2212 Y/s), where Po is the number of virus copy equivalents in the PCR prior to amplification. Results of HRV quantification are summarized in Table 3. Briefly, HRV was positive in 12/110 (10.9%) BAL specimens, obtained from as many patients (12/84, 14.3%): in particular 11/87 (12.6%) samples from immunocompromised patients and 1/23 (4.4%) samples from immunocompetent patients (P = n.s.). Viral load was <220 Genome equivalents (GEq)/ml in the immunocompetent patient and ranged from <220 to 3.14 \u00d7 106 GEq/ml (median, 994) in the immunocompromised patients.

HRV was also detected in one sample obtained during routine follow-up in one lung allograft recipient and in three cases with transplant complications. Results in clinical samples and main features of patients positive to HRV are reported in Table 4.\n\n",

            "text": "Real-time PCR assays are described as \u2018closed\u2019 systems, as no post-amplification manipulation of the amplicon is required. The advantages of these systems include a reduced turnaround time, minimisation of the potential for carry-over contamination and ability to closely scrutinise the assay performance, thus representing a suitable tool for routine diagnostics in virology. The use of an external standard curve for quantification relies upon titration of an identically amplified template, in a related sample matrix, within the same experimental run. However, this approach may suffer from uncontrolled and unmonitored inter-tube variations and thus such experiments should be described as semi-quantitative. Despite this sub-optimal approach, fluorescence data are generally collected from PCR cycles that span the linear amplification portion of the reaction where the fluorescent signal and the accumulating DNA are proportional. Because the emissions from fluorescent chemistries are temperature dependent, data are generally acquired only once per cycle at the same temperature in order to monitor amplicon yield [12]. Then, the Ct of the sample at a specific fluorescence value can be compared with similar data collected from a series of standards by the calculation of a standard curve. The determination of the Ct depends upon the sensitivity and ability of the instrument to discriminate specific fluorescence from background noise, concentration and nature of the fluorescence-generating component and amount of template initially present. Real-time PCR offers significant improvements to viral load quantification because of its wide dynamic range that can accommodate at least eight log10 copies of nucleic acid template [13\u201315]. This is made possible because data are chosen from the linear phase of amplification where conditions are optimal, rather than the end-point where the final amount of amplicon could be affected by inhibitors, poorly optimised reaction conditions or saturation by inhibitory PCR by-products and double-stranded amplicon. The result of taking data from the end-point is that there may exist no relationship between the initial template and final amplicon concentrations. Real-time PCR for the study of viral load presents a lower inter- and intra-assay variability in comparison to conventional PCR [13, 14] and an equivalent or higher analytical sensitivity in comparison to traditional viral culture, or conventional single-round, and nested PCR [16]. Indeed, PCR methods have significantly improved the diagnosis of HRV infection. However, these reports could be an over-estimate due to the choice of smaller targets, which amplify more efficiently, or due to the use of different or improved primers for the real-time assays as the use of software to design optimised primers and oligoprobes is more common. When increased sensitivity and broad dynamic range are combined, it is possible to quantify template from samples containing a wide range of concentrations, as in clinical specimens. This avoids the need for dilution of the amplicon prior to conventional detection or repetition of the assay using a diluted sample because the first result falls outside the detection limits.",

Our assay resulted able to amplify 70 HRV sequences, as confirmed by BLAST search, and should not amplify other viruses pathogenic to humans, in particular enteroviruses. Other studies developed RT real-time PCR assays for detection of HRV [2, 18] in respiratory specimens; however, our assay has been developed and optimized on the basis of the standard amplification profile for the Applied Biosystems Real Time PCR System, thus allowing the simultaneous processing of the same clinical specimens for different viruses potentially involved in respiratory tract infections. Evaluation on clinical specimens confirmed the occurrence of HRV infection in the lower respiratory tract, as 10.9% of BAL specimens resulted positive. Although prevalence of infection tended to be higher in specimens obtained from immunocompromised patients, the difference did not reach the statistical significance, as well as no significant association with a discharge diagnosis was found. Regarding this, it has to be taken into account that all of our specimens, but one, presented a coinfection with at least another respiratory virus (including herpesviruses HSV, EBV, CMV, HHV-6 and -7, human metapneumovirus, human coronavirus, human bocavirus, parainfluenza viruses, influenza viruses, adenoviruses, RSV)(data not shown). HRV shedding in the immunocompromised host could be prolonged in comparison to the immunocompetent one, thus leading to the onset of severe complications, as well as it has been suggested an association with acute rejection in lung transplant recipients [7]. In our study, multiple sampling was available in particular for lung transplant recipients, however no repeated positivity was found, thus preventing the possibility to evaluate this issue and suggesting the need for further studies. Similarly, no significant association was found with the occurrence of exacerbation of pre-existing bronchopneumopaties. As the association between acute exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and respiratory viral pathogens, particularly HRV, is well recognized [19\u201321], the lack of association found in our study could be due to the small number, thus preventing us to evaluate this issue.",
