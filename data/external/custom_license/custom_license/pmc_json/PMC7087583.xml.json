It rapidly spread to over 32 countries in Asia, North America, and Europe. The mortality rate was approximately 10%, according to World Health Organization data. The causative agent of SARS is a novel human coronavirus (CoV), designated SARS-CoV. An efficient therapy and a vaccine are not currently available (Xu et al. 2005). SARS-CoV is an enveloped positive single-stranded RNA virus (Rota et al. 2003) that encodes two proteases for proteolytic processing: a papain-like cysteine protease (PLP2pro) and a chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3C-like protease; 3CLpro) located in the non-structural protein regions nsp3 and nsp5, respectively. Since 3CLpro is essential for the viral life cycle, it is an attractive target for the development of antiviral drugs directed against SARS-CoV and other CoV infections (Grum-Tokars et al. 2008).",

Over 4,000 varieties of flavonoids have been identified (de Groot and Rauen 1998). Flavonoids can act as potent antioxidants, and display anti-inflammatory, antiallergic, antihemorrhagic, antimutagenic, antineoplastic, and hepatoprotective activities (Tapas et al. 2008; de Groot and Rauen 1998). In addition, flavonoids inhibit the catalytic activities of a great variety of enzymes, including hexokinase, phospholipase C, protein kinase C, \u03b1-glucosidase, and \u03b1-amylase. (Tadera et al. 2006). Some flavonoid compounds such as quercetin, quercetin derivatives, catechin, epicatechin, epicatechin gallate and epigallocatechin gallate inhibit SARS-3CLpro expressed in Escherichia coli (Chen et al. 2005, 2006; Yi et al. 2004). However, there has been no report on the high inhibition activity of gallocatechin gallate (GCG) against SARS-3CLpro, or the structure\u2013activity relationship activity among the aforementioned flavonoid compounds.",

The gene encoding SARS 3CLpro polyprotein (amino acid residues 3,241\u20133,546, GenBank accession no. AY274119) (Benson et al. 2011) was optimized by replacing rare codons with high-frequency codons, which were selected on the basis of the findings for codons usage in Pichia pastoris (Supplementary Fig. 1), and were synthesized and cloned in the pUC57 vector (pUC57-3CL) by a custom gene synthesis service (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ, USA). The 3CLpro gene was isolated from the vector pUC57-3CL by cutting with EcoRI and NotI, and was subcloned into the EcoRI/NotI restriction sites of the expression vector pPICZ\u03b1A. The novel construct was named pPICZ\u03b1A-3CLpro and transformed into E. coli DH5\u03b1 (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) using a standard heat shock method. Transformants harbouring pPICZ\u03b1A-3CLpro were selected from LB agar low salt medium [1% (w/v) Tryptone, 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl, pH 7.5] containing 25 \u03bcg Zeocin ml\u22121 (Invitrogen). Plasmid pPICZ\u03b1A-3CLpro was amplified in E. coli DH5\u03b1, linearized by SacI digestion, and transformed into P. pastoris GS115 by a modified LiCl method. pPICZ\u03b1A vector was also linearized by SacI digestion and transformed into P. pastoris GS115 as a negative control strain. Screening for positive clones was done by PCR with two sets of primers (Bioneer, Deajeon, Korea): set one contained 3CLpro primers [3CL-F (5\u2032-GTGGATTCAGAAAAATGGCC-3\u2032) and 3CL-R (5\u2032-CCGCCTGAAAAGTAACTCCT-3\u2032)] and set two contained \u03b1-factor and 3AOX1 primers. The PCR conditions were 94\u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 25 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 1 min, 53\u00b0C for 30 s, 72\u00b0C for 1 min, and a final step of 72\u00b0C for 5 min. PCR was conducted using PCRmix and the PCR product was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis.",

Kinetic parameters of recombinant 3CLpro were obtained using 12.5\u2013100 \u03bcM FRET peptides in the fluorescent assay with an 18 min measurement period.

Primarily inhibitory activities of flavonoid compounds were determined by measuring the remaining activity of 3CLpro at 200 \u03bcM inhibitors. GCG, EGCG, and EGC were dissolved in water; quercetin, puerarin, daidzein, and AMPLS were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) as 10 mM stock solutions.

Reactions were run for 18 min at 25\u00b0C with continuous monitoring of fluorescence.

The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) was defined as the concentration of 3CLpro inhibitor necessary to reduce 3CLpro activity by 50% relative to a reaction mixture containing 3CLpro enzyme but no inhibitor. Inhibitor kinetic studies were performed for GCG, which was the best inhibitor against 3CLpro. The method was similar to those used in a kinetic study of the recombinant enzyme, except for the use of multiple concentrations of the inhibitor (0\u201360 \u03bcM) and variable concentrations of substrate (5\u201315 \u03bcM).

All water molecules, co-crystal ligand ZU5 were removed and the structure information containing only the amino acid residues of the 3CLpro enzyme was used for docking. Docking files were prepared using AutoDockTools software (Sanner et al. 1996). For the protein molecules, polar hydrogen atoms were added and nonpolar hydrogen atoms were merged. Kollman charges and solvation parameters were assigned by default. The three-dimensional atomic coordinates of GCG were generated by the Corina program (Molecular Networks GmbH, Erlangen, Germany), Gasteiger charges were added and nonpolar hydrogen atoms were merged. The grid box, with grid spacing of 0.375 \u212b and dimensions of 60 \u00d7 60 \u00d7 60 points along the x, y, and z axes, was centered on the macromolecule. AutoDock version 3.0.5 software using the Lamarckian genetic algorithm (LGA) was used for the computational molecular docking simulation of flexible small molecules to rigid proteins with ligand and rigid proteins (Morris et al. 1998). Important docking parameters for the Lamarckian genetic algorithm were a population size of 250 individuals, maximum of 5 million energy evaluations, maximum of 27,000 generations, mutation rate of 0.02, crossover rate of 0.80, and 100 docking runs (each docking job produced 100 docked conformations). The probability of performing a local search on an individual in the population was set to 0.06 and the maximum number of iterations per local search was set to 300. The conformation with the lowest docked energy was chosen from the most populated cluster and was put through to the next stage.

Seven colonies were identified as 3CLpro-positive by PCR (Supplementary Fig 2). A single clone was selected for expression; the recombinant 3CLpro was resolved electrophoretically as a band of approx. 42 kDa. To confirm that the clone secreted 3CLpro, western blotting was performed using the anti-His antibody; 3CLpro was apparent as the same band upon SDS-PAGE and the control did not show this band on Western blot (Supplementary Fig 3).",

Quercetin, EGCG and GCG inhibited more than 80% of the activity of recombinant 3CLpro; AMPLS, puerarin, and daidzein inhibited more than 30% activity of recombinant 3CLpro; and EGC inhibited only 5% of the activity of recombinant 3CLpro. Six compounds displayed an IC50 ranging from 47 to 381 \u03bcM (Table 1). GCG showed the best inhibition against recombinant 3CLpro with IC50 value of 47 \u00b1 0.9 \u03bcM, and so was used for the further analysis of inhibition mode. Both Lineweaver\u2013Burk and Dixon plots were used. As shown in Fig. 3a, GCG exhibited competitive inhibition toward 3CLpro because the Lineweaver\u2013Burk plot of 1/v versus 1/[S] resulted in a family of straight lines with the same y-axis intercept. The K\ni value of GCG was determined to be 25 \u00b1 1.7 \u03bcM from the common x-axis intercept of lines on the corresponding Dixon plot (Fig. 3b).\n\n\n",

Autodock 3.0.5 was used to carry out docking simulations. The free binding energy of flavonoid compounds is shown in Table 1. Among them, GCG displayed the lowest free binding energy (\u221214 kcal mol\u22121). The binding between GCG and active site pocket of 3CLpro is shown in Fig. 4a. To elucidate the interaction of 3CLpro with GCG, the potential hydrophobic and H-bond interactions between amino acid residues in the active site pockets of 3CLpro and GCG were investigated using the Ligplot program. Figure 4b depicts the details of the specific interactions between GCG and 3CLpro. Carbon atoms of GCG interacted hydrophobically with His41, Cys145, Met165, Glu166, Asp187, Arg188, and Gln189 of 3CLpro. GCG formed seven hydrogen bonds with residues in the catalytic binding pocket of 3CLpro. The O atom of the main chain carboxyl group of Glu166 formed an H-bond with the O33 atom of the 5-hydroxyl group of the A ring with a distance of 2.56 \u212b. The O atom of hydroxyl group of aromatic side chain of Tyr54 formed a H-bond with the O30 atom of the 4\u2032-hydroxyl group of the ring B at 2.7 \u212b. The O29 atom of the 5\u2032-hydroxyl group of ring B accepted a H-bond from the N atom of the imidazol group of His41with a distance 2.72 \u212b. The O28 atom of the 3\u2033-hydroxyl group of the galloyl group accepted a H-bond with the N atom from the imidazol group of His163 with a distance of 2.96 \u212b. The O26 atom of the 4\u2033-hydroxyl group of the galloyl group has two H-bonds: one with the carboxyl group of Leu141 and another one with the carboxyl group of Ser144 at 2.90 and 2.49 \u212b, respectively. The N atom of the amino group of Gly143 donated a H-bond with an O27 atom of the 5\u2033-hydroxyl group of the galloyl group with a distance of 3.35 \u212b.\n",

The decreasing order of the inhibitory activity was EGC < AMPLS < EGCG < GCG. EGCG and GCG have a galloyl moiety at the 3-OH position, which is absent in the other catechins used in this study. EGCG and GCG displayed stronger 3CLpro inhibitory activity than those of EGC and AMPLS. GCG (2S, 3R type), which is a C-2 epimeric isomer of EGCG (2R, 3R type), showed 1.5-times higher 3CLpro inhibitory activity than that of EGCG. Molecular docking simulation was used to calculate the binding of GCG to the 3CLpro active site. GCG bound at the substrate-binding pocket of 3CLpro with numerous hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions. The galloyl group from GCG was important for GCG binding to 3CLpro active site pocket because it has four hydrogen bond interactions with Leu141, Gly143, Ser144, and His163 (Fig. 4b). The effect of B-ring and hydroxyl group substitution on the B-ring for the inhibitory activity was evaluated. Daidzein and puerarin, which lack the B-ring, showed little inhibition of 3CLpro. The 3CLpro inhibitory activity of AMLSP was 4.96-times lower than that of quercetin. This confirmed that the addition of an OH group at 5\u2032-position of the B ring decreased the 3CLpro inhibitory activity. The effect of the structures of the A and C rings on the inhibitory activity was evaluated. Since AMPLS, which lacks the 2,3-double bonds in the C-ring, showed lower inhibitory activity than that of quercetin, 2,3-double bonds are probably crucially influential to the inhibitory activity. EGC lacking the C(4)=O in the C-ring, C(2)=C(3), containing 5\u2032-OH group and lacking galloyl moiety showed the lowest inhibitory activity compared to that of AMPLS, daidzein, puerarin, quercetin, EGCG, or GCG.",
