CPV was first identified in the late 1970s as a major cause of haemorrhagic gastroenteritis and myocarditis in puppies [2]. CPV has a small single-stranded DNA genome of 5.2 kilobases (kb). Symptoms of CPV infection vary from mild to haemorrhagic enteritis , fever, vomiting and death in severe cases. Coronaviruses are single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses with a large genome of 27-31 kb in length. Enteric canine coronavirus typically causes mild enteritis in dogs, with more severe clinical signs observed in young animals [3].",

It is presumed that CPV originated from feline panleukopenia virus via genetic mutations and evolution [2]. Shortly after its emergence, CPV-2 was entirely replaced by a new type, designated CPV-2a, which possessed the ability to infect both cats and dogs [5]. In the mid-eighties, another type, designated as CPV-2b, began to emerge. CPV-2b is distinguished from CPV-2a by a single amino acid (aa) substitution, asparagine (Asn) to aspartic acid (Asp), at position 426 of the major antigenic site of the VP2 capsid protein [6].",

CPV-2c has since been detected throughout parts of Europe, including Spain [8], Germany [9], Portugal [10], the United Kingdom [11], as well as Korea [12], the United States [13], South America [14] and Vietnam [15]. CPV-2c is distinguishable from CPV-2a or 2b by substitution of glutamic acid (Glu) in place of Asn or Asp, respectively, at the 426th aa residue of the VP2 protein. Therefore, due to the positioning of these aa substitutions in an antigenic site, it is possible to differentiate between types by employing monoclonal antibodies [15]. Alternatively, the nucleotide sequence required to substitute Glu at aa position 426 created a novel MboII restriction site (GAAGA), which is unique to CPV-2c, and therefore, CPV-2c can be distinguished from CPV-2a/2b by restriction enzyme analysis [7]. Infection with CPV-2c has been reported to result in clinical symptoms similar to those exhibited by dogs infected with CPV-2a and 2b [13]. Some studies reported milder symptoms in infected animals [16], while other reports found evidence of more severe clinical symptoms and higher rates of mortality, even in vaccinated dogs [7, 8, 17].",

            "text": "CCoV was first discovered as an enteropathogen in 1971 [18]. Enteric CCoV exists in two closely related forms, the original form, which was isolated in the 1970s, is named CCoV-II. A new CCoV strain, which was identified in Italy in 2003, is designated as CCoV-I. CCoV-I and II share a high nucleotide homology in the viral genome but are highly divergent in the spike protein gene [19]. The strains are so named according to genetic similarities observed between CCoV-I and II, and feline coronavirus (FCoV)-I and II, respectively [20]. As coronaviruses contain large RNA genomes, they are highly susceptible to frequent mutation as a result of the high error rate of RNA polymerase, which results in the accumulation of several base substitutions per round of replication [21]. Coronaviruses can accumulate small insertions and deletions in their genomes, which promotes their evolution [22]. They also undergo a high rate of homologous RNA recombination, mediated by a \u201ccopy-choice\u201d mechanism based on sequence homology surrounding the recombination sites [23]. As a result of all of these mechanisms, coronaviruses can mutate rapidly, leading to new genotypes (CCoV-I), biotypes (pantropic CCoV) and host variants (canine respiratory coronavirus). Following the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in humans, the continual epidemiological surveillance on CoVs has been reinforced, as they are considered to be potential agents of direct and indirect zoonoses [24].",

CCoV infection generally has a low mortality; however, a recently characterized strain detected in Italy (CB/05) resulted in a fatal disease as a consequence of systemic spread of the virus [24]. Deaths have also been caused by the synergistic effect produced when a mixed infection occurs with other canine enteric viruses. Mixed infections have been reported between CCoV and CPV-2, canine distemper virus and canine adenovirus type I [8, 26, 27]. Mixed infections have also been reported between CPV-2 and calicivirus [28, 29]. Dual infection results in illnesses that are usually more severe than either virus can produce alone [28]. Synergistic mechanisms are common with other gastroenteritis viruses such as rotavirus. Studies have demonstrated this effect with calves co-infected with group A rotavirus and group C rotavirus, or with group A rotavirus and Escherichia coli [30, 31].",

However, this strain was entirely replaced by its variant types (CCoV-I and II) shortly after its emergence. There is concern that these current vaccines may fail to protect pups against the CPV-2 variants [32, 33]. A plan to use current strains in vaccine formulations has led to a CPV-2b-based vaccine being licensed in Europe [34]. Currently, all canine vaccines used to protect against CCoVs are based on CCoV-II. However, it has been shown that the level of cross-reactivity between CCoV-I and II is limited [35]. Recombinant CCoVs have been reported that were derived from CCoV-II and transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine (TGEV), related in the N terminal domain of the S protein. Antigenic differences have also been found between TGEV-like CCoVs and reference CCoV strains [17]. As a result of this viral evolution, the efficacy of prophylaxis programs in place to protect dogs against CCoV challenges may need to be assessed.",

In addition, recovered dogs may serve as asymptomatic carriers and shed the virus periodically [1, 40]. This is an important mechanism for the continued circulation and persistence of CPV and CCoV in the environment. However, in this study, both viruses were isolated exclusively from dogs that presented with clinical symptoms. The viruses were isolated from samples sourced in veterinary clinics (n=8) and the ISPCA (n=1), from dogs aged two months to 15 years, several of which had been vaccinated previously. Out of 40 samples sourced from symptomatic dogs, seven were positive for the presence of CPV (17.5%). All dogs presented with haemorrhagic enteritis, while three also presented with vomiting. Additionally, one dog presented with pyrexia, and another case resulted in death (Table 1b). Three CCoV were detected in 40 samples from symptomatic dogs (7.5%), one of which was present in combination with CPV, and this mixed infection produced severe haemorrhagic gastroenteritis (Table 1c).",

This restriction site was not detected in any of the current isolates. Subsequently, the VP2 gene segment was sequenced in order to confirm the RFLP results, to determine which amino acid each isolate contained at position 426 and thus reveal if isolates were CPV-2a or CPV-2b. Three isolates possessed the aa Asn at position 426 of the VP2 protein and were therefore characterised as CPV-2a. All other isolates possessed the aa Asp at position 426 and thus were characterised as CPV-2b. There does not appear to be any correlation between CPV type and symptom severity. A variety of phylogenetic trees were constructed from this information. However, it can be seen in Figure 1 that the VP2 gene has a low variability, and thus is not particularly informative from a phylogenetic view. Typically, a 99% maximum identity is displayed between the VP2 gene of CPV-2 strains. The phylogenetic tree prepared using the maximum-parsimony method proved to give the best possible resolution (Figure 1). CPV strains are subtyped according to a single amino acid in a strategic location, which involves few changes in the nucleotide sequence. As a result, when comparing CPV nucleotide sequence data, the CPV subgroups 2a, b and c are not segregated into three distinct groups, as there are several other nucleotide differences at other less antigenically significant locations on the VP2 gene, which must also be taken into consideration.",

The spike protein is the major antigenic determinant of CoVs. CCoV-I and II share a high nucleotide homology in the viral genome but are highly divergent in the spike protein gene [19]. The strain PH4/09/Ire was characterized as CCoV-I, with strains AVC2/09/Ire and AVC3/09/Ire being characterized as CCoV-II. CCoV-I was first discovered in Italy in 2003 [19]. Since then, it has been reported in other countries, such as the United Kingdom, Greece, Portugal, Belgium, Romania, Sweden and Slovenia [41]. This is the first report of CCoV-I and II in Ireland. In order to confirm PCR typing results, the sequence of the S gene of the three CCoV samples was determined. Subsequent sequence analysis confirmed that CCoV-II was more prevalent than CCoV-I, which is in accordance with other published findings [42]. Although the low numbers of positive samples in this study lack statistical support, it does provide a snapshot of the epidemiology of CCoV in Ireland. Using BLAST analysis, it was determined that the CCoV-I strain PH1/09/Ire displayed 96% nucleotide sequence homology with CCoV-I strain Elmo from Italy. The CCoV-II strain AVC3/09/Ire displayed 91% nucleotide homology with CCoV-II strain INSAVC and 88% nucleotide homology with CCoV-II strain BGF10, both of which were isolated in the United Kingdom.",

The latest CPV variant type to emerge, CPV-2c, has been shown to produce a more pathogenic clinical outcome in some cases, whereas others have a lower severity and mortality rate [16]. As the aa that determines the type is located in a major antigenic site, a mutation that affects the type may have serious implications for vaccine efficacy and the antibody response generated in pups. A number of commercially licensed vaccines are available in Ireland and are given to pups at six weeks and again four weeks later, followed by an annual vaccination booster. It has been shown that the vaccines based on the original CPV-2 isolate protect against CPV-2 variant type challenges; however, a plan to use current strains in vaccine formulations has led to a CPV-2b- based vaccine being licensed in Europe [34].",

Currently, all vaccines are based on CCoV-II. However, it has been shown that the level of cross-reactivity between CCoV-I and II is limited [35]. A lack of cross-reactivity has also been reported between the original CCoV-II strain, designated CCoV-IIa, and a more recently described CCoV-II strain that is closely related to TGEV in the 5\u2019 end of the spike gene, designated CCoV-IIb [43]. As a result of RNA recombination, insertions, deletions and a high susceptibility to frequent mutation, coronaviruses can mutate rapidly, leading to new genotypes (CCoV-I), biotypes (pantropic CCoV) and host variants (canine respiratory coronavirus), all of which may present possible difficulties regarding successful vaccination of dogs. Such dilemmas have been encountered with vaccination against other RNA viruses, such as influenza virus and rotaviruses. The evolution of these viruses is well documented to play an important role in the continuous requirement to assess the efficiency of the vaccines and vaccinal updates. For example, the H3 haemagluttinin protein (the major antigenic determinant) exhibits a rate of accumulation of amino acid substitutions of approximately 5 \u00d7 10-3 per year [44]. Similarly, human rotavirus strains, detected over an 18-year period from 1986 to 2004 in Palermo, Italy, displayed a rate of accumulation of amino acid substitutions of approximately 2 \u00d7 10-3 per year [45].",

It is possible, in the cases where vaccination had been carried out, that maternal antibody had interfered with the immune response of the pup at time of vaccination. A suspected lack of efficacy of vaccines based on the original CPV-2 strain against the new CPV variants in circulation has been suggested previously after worldwide CPV outbreaks were observed in regularly vaccinated dogs [46, 47]. As a result of this study, it can be concluded that although it appears that the viral evolution of CPV type 2 is not yet a significant problem for the canine population in Ireland, vaccine efficacy may need to be re-evaluated by the animal healthcare industry, as it is a possibility that the new CPV-2c strain will eventually emerge into the population as a result of importing dogs from other parts of the world. This study provides evidence that both CPV and CCoV are causative agents of gastroenteritis in southern Ireland in symptomatic dogs, with no evidence of viral shedding in asymptomatic dogs. It has also been demonstrated that dual infection of CCoV along with CPV is of significant concern regarding animal health and well-being. Continued surveillance would be beneficial to evaluate better vaccine efficacy, to understand the underlying mechanisms of vaccine breakthroughs and to implement successful prophylactic measures.",
