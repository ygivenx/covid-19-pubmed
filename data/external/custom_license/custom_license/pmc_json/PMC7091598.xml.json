Generally, the numbers of cases from single hospitals are limited and insufficient for statistical analysis6. As a result, no biomarker that predict disease progression and outcomes of potentially lethal flu infections has been identified7. During the spring of 2013, a novel and highly virulent avian-origin influenza A subtype virus, H7N9, emerged and spread among humans in Eastern China5,8,9,10. In total, 144 people were infected by the end of 2013, and there were already over 100 newly infected patients before the end of January in 2014. Of the 111 patients we previously studied in 2013, 76.6% were admitted to an intensive care unit1. Among these patients, more than 70% developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)1, which was associated with high mortality, as few interventions were available11,12. Although extensive therapeutic interventions were employed, including antiviral treatments, oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, antibiotics, glucocorticoids, intravenous immunoglobulins, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, continuous renal replacement therapy and artificial liver support system therapy, we observed high mortality rates among H7N9-infected patients1,13,14,15.",

We also collected plasma from 21 swine-origin influenza (H1N1) virus-infected patients in Beijing from December 2012 to February 2013 (Supplementary Table 1). The presence of H7N9 and H1N1 influenza viruses was confirmed by PCR. Plasma from six healthy volunteers from the China CDC who were considered to be at high risk for H7N9 infection and plasma from 46 coronary heart disease (CHD) patients in Beijing were collected from April 2013 to June 2013. The characteristics of the study subjects are shown in Supplementary Tables 2\u20134. To stratify the distinct time points during the illness, plasma was obtained within the first 7 days of disease onset (H7N9: n=24; H1N1: n=10), between 8 and 14 days following disease onset (H7N9: n=11; H1N1: n=7), and during the recovery phase from 15 days after disease onset (H7N9: n=11; H1N1: n=4) (Fig. 1a). Intriguingly, at all stages, angiotensin II plasma levels were markedly higher in H7N9-infected patients than in H1N1-infected patients, all CHD patients, and CHD patients with a diagnosis of hypertension (Fig. 1a, Table 1, Supplementary Tables 1\u20134). Angiotensin II levels in plasma from H1N1-infected patients obtained during the first week of disease were moderately higher than in those obtained from healthy individuals, whereas angiotensin II levels in plasma obtained during other time periods from H1N1-infected patients and CHD patients were not significantly different from those of high-risk healthy individuals (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Table 4). Notably, angiotensin II levels decreased in H7N9-infected patient plasma harvested 15 days after disease onset, suggesting that angiotensin II levels may be related to disease severity in the early stage of avian influenza H7N9 infection (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Table 4).",

However, in the group of patients hospitalized for a longer period or who died, plasma angiotensin II levels remained high during the second week of illness (Fig. 1b).

We excluded samples with Ct values that indicated negative viral load. Pearson correlation analysis showed that plasma angiotensin II levels were indeed negatively correlated with H7N9 virus Ct values (and thus, positively correlated with viral load) during week 1, but not week 2 of illness (Supplementary Table 5). Our data suggested that elevations of angiotensin II levels in the plasmas of H7N9-infected patients harvested during week 1 of disease onset were induced by avian influenza H7N9 virus. Interestingly, we also discovered a high linear correlation between H1N1 viral Ct value and angiotensin II levels in the plasma of patients infected with H1N1 collected at week 1 but not week 2 of disease onset (Supplementary Table 5). Although the angiotensin II levels in plasmas from H1N1-infected patients were significantly lower than those in plasmas of H7N9-infected patients, the elevations of angiotensin II levels in plasmas harvested at the first week of disease onset was induced by swine-origin influenza virus H1N1 (Supplementary Table 5).",

The area under the curve of plasma angiotensin II levels during the second week of illness among H7N9-infected patients was 0.875, and the predictive values of C-reactive protein, pneumonia severity index score and SMART-COP were all less significant than angiotensin II (Fig. 4, Supplementary Table 6). Our data suggested that angiotensin II level at the week 2 of disease onset could predict the fatal outcome. We also used MedCalc software and the results were the same (Supplementary Table 7). The sensitivity and specificity of this analysis were 87.5% and 68%, respectively (Supplementary Table 7). In addition, the positive predictive value, negative predictive value, positive likelihood ratio and negative likelihood ratio within 95% confidence intervals were determined (Supplementary Table 7).",
