            "text": "Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is the leading cause of nosocomial infection in critically ill patients and prolongs the length of stay in hospital for an average of 7\u20139 days per patient [1]. The incidence of VAP varies from 20 to 30%, with a mortality rate ranging from 30 to 70% [1, 2, 3]. Moreover, VAP is responsible for more than half of antibiotic prescription in the ICU [4]; however, the pathogen responsible for VAP remains unknown in 30\u201350% of cases, according to standard bacteriological procedure [5, 6]. Because viruses are not routinely screened, we hypothesized that a proportion of VAP may be caused by nosocomial transmission of viruses, which has been described for all respiratory viruses [7, 8, 9, 10, 11], but never assessed in intubated patients; therefore, we undertook a prospective observational study to determine the incidence of viral VAP among intubated ICU patients consecutively admitted in a 9-month period including a viral endemic period and, if any, to identify risk factors for viral VAP.",

Only the first episode of VAP was included. Respiratory specimens were transported to the virology laboratory in sterile containers. Conventional methods, including the viral isolation techniques in MRC5 and HuH7 cells and indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) on tracheobronchial aspirate using monoclonal antibodies, except for rhinovirus, were carried out on fresh specimens to detect parainfluenza virus (PIV) 1,2,3,4, influenza virus A,B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus (AdV), rhinovirus (RV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and herpes simplex virus (HSV). Additionally, the samples were divided into aliquots and kept frozen at \u221280\u00b0C. Nucleic acids were extracted using a commercial reagent (QiAamp viral RNA minikit, Qiagen) for RNA viruses and a chelex procedure for DNA agents. The RT-PCR assays were done in all samples for the detection of parainfluenza virus 1,2,3,4, influenza virus A,B,C, respiratory syncytial virus, metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, coronavirus 229E and OC43, and PCR assays for adenovirus, cytomegalovirus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae in patients with VAP or immunosuppressed, using previously described procedures [16, 17, 18, 19]. One positive and several negative controls were included for each infectious agent that was treated identically to the virus samples throughout. Baseline respiratory specimens and VAP specimens were processed in the same way for PCR or RT-PCR assays at the end of the study period. Results of conventional methods for viral isolation, routinely performed in our department of virology, were weekly transmitted to the clinicians; however, no anti-viral drug could be used during the study period except for proved HSV or CMV infection in immunocompromised patients. In patients suspected for VAP, tracheobronchial aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) product were also cultured for bacteria.",

In both cases, viruses were already detected upon enrollment and VAP criteria were fulfilled early , 5 and 6 days after intubation, respectively. Since incubation periods range from 3 to 5 days for influenza virus A, and from 5 to 14 days for enterovirus, and their excreted period in healthy or infected subjects varies from 7 to 10 days, respectively, we suspected that they could not be responsible for VAP [20, 21]. This underscores the importance of initial specimen screening for viral detection in the diagnosis of viral VAP. As previously described, viral hospital-acquired infection should be defined as a viral infection occurring in a patient hospitalized for at least a longer time than the viral incubation period [22, 23, 24]. To our knowledge, one published study investigated prospectively the incidence of respiratory tract infection for RSV in immunocompetent intubated adults admitted to ICU during community outbreaks of RSV infection [25]. Among the 11 included patients, 2 cases of RSV infection acquired in adult ICU were found. In these 2 cases, transmission of infected secretion by healthy or infected personnel was discussed. The proximity of adult ICU with pediatric ICU could also explain the high incidence of RSV nosocomial infections reported in this study, in contrast with our study.",
