RNAi governs the regulation of host cell genes, mainly through two types of RNA molecules: small interfering RNA (siRNA) and microRNA (miRNA).[1] siRNAs are a class of double-stranded RNA molecules, 20\u201325 nucleotides in length, which play different roles in cellular biology. Experimental application or targeting of siRNAs in various cell types and animal models has shown promise for the potential treatment of diseases induced by viruses such as hepatitis C, influenza, and HIV.[2\u20134] The suppression of viral gene expression by siRNAs makes them very attractive for antiviral therapy, and some siRNAs are already being used in clinical trials.[5] However, siRNAs still have a long way to go before being brought to market, because of their potential side effects. One of the major concerns in using siRNAs as molecular therapeutics is their induction of a strong immune response.",

The first virally encoded miRNA was discovered in the Epstein Barr virus (EBV) genome.[8] Now, there are more than 141 identified miRNAs encoded by 15 viruses, with more expected to be identified in the near future as a result of the improvement in online prediction and validation tools.[9] Cellular miRNAs in animals seem to be conserved, while virally encoded miRNAs are highly variable even within the same group of viruses.[10] This may be due to the high frequency of viral mutations relative to eukaryotes. miRNAs play an important role in regulation of almost one-third of all known human mRNAs.[11] Most miRNAs have a specific tissue expression profile. Their unique expression pattern may explain their roles in different biologic activities, such as cellular differentiation, environment adaptation, oncogenesis, and host-pathogen interaction.[12]",

These approaches include anti-miRNA oligonucleotides (AMOs), peptide nucleic acids, and miRNA sponges.[15] Initial experiments have obtained promising results in controlling various viral infections.[16\u201318] In addition, it has been found that restoring or over-expressing certain miRNAs may also be beneficial for reverse pathologic conditions, especially in cancer treatments.[19]",

Humans have also acquired simian virus 40 (SV40) infection from contaminated poliovirus vaccines, and recent studies have reported horizontal transmission between people.[28] HPyVs induce a wide range of tumors affecting almost all body organs (including the brain, bones, colon, pancreas, stomach, and urogenital tract), as well as lymphomas and leukemia.[28,29] The viral genome of SV40 encodes five proteins; two large T antigen (LT), one small T antigen (st-Ag), and three that encode the capsid proteins (Vp1, Vp2 and Vp3). HPyVs are able to encode viral miRNAs for their own benefit. Both BKV and JCV encode the same miRNA, named miR-J1. It is upregulated in the brain in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy syndrome, suggesting a major role in this particular disease.[30]",

Over 50 serotypes have been identified in different clinical diseases, such as respiratory, gastrointestinal, urogenital, and eye diseases.[36]Adenovirus usually encodes several small non-coding RNA molecules called virus-associated RNAs, such as VA1 and VA2.[37] They facilitate immune evasion by inhibiting dsRNA-induced protein kinase R (PKR), which blocks IFN-\u03b1 activity.[38] One study reported that adenovirus VA1-RNA interferes with the biogenesis of host miRNAs and the function of siRNA/shRNA (short hairpin RNA), through inhibition of the nuclear transport of the pre-miRNAs and the shRNAs and direct inhibitory action of Dicer.[37] Usually, a small part of the VA1 RNA is subjected to processing by Dicer, and this results in generation of miRNA. Use of anti-miRNA antisense inhibitors (2\u2032-O-methyl AMO) to downregulate this miRNA resulted in inhibition of virus production.[39]",

            "text": "One of the most important genes encoded by herpes simplex virus (HSV) is called the latency-associated transcript (LAT).[44] This gene does not encode proteins but may be involved in the production of miRNAs or in cell survival after viral infection.[44] There has been debate around the origin of miR-LAT as to whether it is a virus-encoded or cell-encoded miRNA.[41] This miRNA is believed to act by downregulating transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 and SMAD3. TGF-\u03b2 plays an important role in cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis. SMAD3 is a signaling pathway mediator, which is triggered by the action of TGF-\u03b2.[41] HSV-1 miR-LAT-ICP34.5 has been recently discovered during HSV-1 infection.[45] According to bioinformatic analysis, the HSV-1 genome encodes 24 miRNAs, eight of which were found to be conserved between both HSV1 and HSV-2, and thus are believed to be functional.[46] Six of these miRNAs are upregulated in the trigeminal ganglia of mice infected with HSV-1. These miRNAs are encoded by LAT (table I).[46] In addition, quantitative reverse transcription PCR showed that both miR-1 and miR-6 were highly expressed in Vero cells infected with HSV-1 \u2014 as high as 1200 and 300 copies, respectively \u2014 whereas the other four miRNAs showed downregulation, with only 40 copies per infected cell.[55] The miRNA expression profile during HSV-1 infection revealed that several miRNAs among the eight candidates mentioned earlier were upregulated. Those miRNAs were believed to play major roles in induction of the latent phase of viral infection. This assumption was based on comparison between the miRNA expression profiles of the latent and active infections. For example, miR-H2 was found to be upregulated in latent infection to a level of 63 000 copies/cell, compared with less than 40 copies/cell during active infection.[56] Furthermore, miRNA-2 inhibits the production of the infected cell polypeptide (ICP)-0 protein, which is responsible for triggering the active phase of HSV infection. Another upregulated miRNA, miR-6, is responsible for downregulation of ICP4, which is responsible for the increased expression level of many HSV genes during the active phase of HSV-1 infection.[55,56]\n\n",

IE72 is a key mediator in the shift from the latent to the active phase of viral infection, because it suppresses IE1.[58,59] Thus, if the HCMV infection is synchronized with overexpression of the miR-UL112, the IE1 protein expression level is greatly reduced, which mediates the latent phase of infection.[43] It is also thought that miR-UL112-1 targets another viral protein called UL114.[58] Downregulation of UL114 protein, using miR-UL112-1, results in inhibition of viral DNA replication and subsequently triggers the latent phase of infection, making the virus able to evade the host immune system.[34] Exploitation of this mechanism is being considered as a potential therapeutic strategy.[21]",

Therefore, targeting PUMA with EBV miR-BART5 results in suppression of its action in apoptosis.[64]\n\n",

For example, miR-K5 targets the mRNA of the BCL2 (prosurvival gene) interacting protein called BCLAF1.[62] This leads to reactivation of the KSHV lytic infection.[62] Thus KSHV-encoded miRNAs play an important role in the virus/host interactions, and silencing of those miRNAs using different approaches, particularly the AMO, is therefore a promising therapeutic strategy against such virus infection (figure 1).[62]",

However, their target genes have not been well identified.[68,69] It is known that several host cell miRNAs \u2014 such as miR-17, miR-92, miR-21, and let-7i \u2014 are involved in the cancer development induced by MDV in chickens.[68] They are most often upregulated in an MSB-1 (MDV-transformed CD4+ T-cell line derived from a spleen lymphoma induced by the BC-1 strain of MDV-1) library after MDV infection.[69] This makes for an ideal model for the study of miRNAs. Comparative analysis of miRNA expression profiles during MDV infection, using microarray analysis, may enable identification of specific miRNAs involved in neoplastic transformation when compared with non-infected cells. This may become a useful diagnostic approach through examination of miRNA signatures profiles.[70] This is supported by a recent report showing an association between downregulation of the host cellular miR-155 expression and upregulation of MDV-encoded miRNAs (M2-5P, M12-3P, M5-3P, M4-5P, M3-5P, M11-5P, M2-3P, M4-3P, and M3-3P), a potential marker for MDV-induced tumor formation.[69] Subsequent identification of the putative target of these miRNAs will lead to a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of MDV-induced tumorigeneses.[69]",

Furthermore, the level of viral RNA in the liver tissues is usually controlled by miR-122 binding sites.[78] Interestingly, HCV infection also modulates cellular miRNA expression profiles. Following HCV infection, three miRNAs (miR-122, miR-100, and miR-10a) are upregulated, while other two miRNAs (miR-198 and miR-145) are downregulated.[78] Ura et al.[52] found that cyclin G1 acts as a putative target for miR-122. Use of a primate model targeting miR-122 with specific antagonists resulted in a reduction in the level of HCV replication in the affected livers, demonstrating the promise of this strategy.[79] In addition, a recent study demonstrated the therapeutic potential of silencing miR-122 in chronic HCV viral infection in primate models, whereby chimpanzees that were positive for HCV infection were treated with a specific LNA-modified oligonucleotide (SPC3649).[79] These LNA-oligomers targeted the complement sequence of miR-122 and resulted in a decrease in the duration of the viremia following acute HCV infection. There were no reports of any side effects or any viral resistance observed after the treatment.[79] This approach provided long-lasting effects in the HCV-infected animals, as well as great improvement in the liver pathology.[79] More clinical trials are needed to further confirm the promising results of this new molecular therapeutic approach.[78]",

HBV infection progresses into cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in most cases.[80] It is believed that HBV encodes miRNAs that regulate their own gene expression.[81] According to bioinformatic predictions, HBV encodes only one miRNA. However, several studies have failed to identify any cellular genes regulated by this virus-encoded miRNA, implying alternative gene expression mechanisms.[81,82] According to the miRNA expression profiles of several patients suffering from cirrhosis due to HBV infection, the host Hsa-miRNA-615-3p is usually upregulated. In recent clinical studies, Ura et al.[52] studied the role of different miRNAs in the pathogenesis of both HBV and HCV in the context of development of hepatocellular carcinoma in infected liver tissues.[52] In this study, the differential expression levels of 188 miRNAs from 12 HBV and 18 HCV patients were tested using qRT-PCR. According to this study, 19 miRNA candidates were highly expressed in both HBV and HCV infections, and 31 miRNAs served as markers for the severity of liver damage. It is known that HBV infection triggers pathways associated with DNA damage, recombination, and signal transduction pathways \u2014 whereas HCV infection usually triggers an immune response, antigen presentation, cell cycle progression, proteosome activation, and lipid metabolism. Therefore, the overall conclusion was that certain miRNAs may act as important mediators in the pathogenesis of both HBV and HCV infections.[52] These studies have paved the way to a new era in molecular antiviral therapy through modulation of the expression levels of those key miRNAs. There is now a new antiviral therapy for controlling HBV infection, using artificial miRNAs. This approach has revealed a dramatic reduction in HBV protein expression levels and a remarkable reduction in viral DNA replication in vitro.[83\u201385]",

Although several trials have been performed to treat this pathogen using conventional drugs such as ribavirin, antibiotics, anti-inflammatory steroids, and different kinds of immune stimulators, these approaches still lack viral specificity. SARS-CoV infection in bronchioalveolar stem cells (BASCs) is a prime example of how miRNA modulates the virus-host interaction. SARS-CoV is unable to replicate in well differentiated cells, so it has to control BASC cellular differentiation in order to establish a successful viral infection.[86] This virus usually hijacks cellular miRNAs such as miR-17*, miR-574-5p, and miR-214 for the benefits of its replication and immune evasion. The nucleocapsid and spike glycoproteins downregulate the expression levels of miR-223 and miR-98, respectively. This action enables the virus to hinder BASC cellular differentiation and the production of inflammatory chemokines, creating an environment that is optimal for virus replication. Restoration of the levels of miR-223 and miR-98 poses a potential novel approach in treating SARS-CoV infection.[86]",

This novel strategy offered a very good vaccine that was species specific, offering a high level of protection.[4] The nascent viruses were attenuated for mice, while they still propagated well in embryonated chicken eggs and were able to generate high levels of neutralizing antibodies in animals.

Basically, the delivery vector will stimulate an innate immune response in the forms of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, humoral neutralizing antibody against their viral capsid proteins, and cytokine-mediated inflammatory responses in vivo.[93,94] Direct correlation between the immune response to the adenovirus capsid protein and the concentration of the viral vector has been reported; this interaction is usually associated with undesirable side effects in the host, especially if the construct moves from the target tissue into the blood circulation.[95]",

As a new generation of molecular gene therapy, miRNAs would be expected to have a high degree of specificity for their targets. However, since miRNA action is based on imperfect base pairing with the target sequence in most circumstances, the specificity will be lower than that of siRNA. This prediction has been confirmed by recent clinical trials, followed up by microarray analysis, which revealed possible off-target effects of miRNAs.[102] Another follow-up study by Birmingham et al.,[103] using the combination of bioinformatics and microarray analysis, found that using either the siRNA or the miRNA could result in off-target silencing. In addition, in vivo studies have revealed that one miRNA may target several genes at the same time, and the targets are not clearly identified. This suggests diverse modes of action of a given single miRNA. On the other hand, one gene may be regulated by several miRNAs,[104] indicating that the mode of action is more complicated than expected. Since drug therapies must precisely target the virus in question and nothing else, a large undertaking is needed to gather all possible information regarding all targets of each miRNA that is being considered for drug development.[104,105]",

These mutations may not only result in abnormal gene expression of the viral miRNA construct but may also cause possible insertion of vectors into the human genome, increasing the risk of cancer.[23] Moreover, the targeted viruses (especially the RNA viruses) are prone to mutation, which may drive drug resistance. There are currently two possible approaches to conquer these issues: one is the targeting of cellular factors that are essential for virus replication or use of more than one miRNA for the same target gene; the other possible solution is the targeting of several conserved regions of the viral genome by different siRNAs or miRNAs.",

Because of the unique biologic properties of viruses, there is no effective and specific antiviral therapy available so far. Several vaccines and antiviral drugs have shown a limited degree of efficacy for prophylaxis and treatment of some viral infections. However, high mutation rates enable viral diseases to emerge and re-emerge frequently. Thus, new strategies for drug and vaccine development must be devised to fight the threat of viral diseases to human health. Recent advances in the understanding of miRNA structure, function, and particularly their association with the molecular pathogenesis of a variety of complex diseases, have served as a theoretical basis for drug development. On the one hand, as key factors for viral replication and latency, miRNAs are ideal targets for inhibition. In this regard, construction of mRNAs that contain multiple tandem binding sites of a given miRNA may be useful to produce decoys or \u2018miRNA sponges\u2019 to inhibit the function of a specific miRNA. In addition, chemically synthesized antisense RNA oligomers (\u2018antagomirs\u2019) targeting a miRNA of interest could be also be a promising approach to inhibit miRNA activity. On the other hand, miRNA expression vectors can be used to overexpress specific miRNAs to achieve a long-term effect of reversing the imbalance of miRNA expression caused by infection. Further, introduction of pre-miRNA mimetics for transient replacement is another option for investigation.",
