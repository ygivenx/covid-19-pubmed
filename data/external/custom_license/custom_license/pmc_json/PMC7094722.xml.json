Our protocol of fecal viral quantification has been validated for coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome.7 A significant peaking in fecal BKV excretion was detected in 3/40 patients (pattern a cases), which showed a consistent pattern of increase, peaking and decline. It paralleled concomitant urinary BKV reactivation, with peaks coinciding on the same days. In fact, all three patients had undergone allogeneic HSCT and developed GVHD, which were typical risk factors for urinary BKV reactivation.3, 6, 8 Therefore, fecal and urinary BKV excretions probably reflected viral reactivation consequent to severe immunosuppression. Definitive proof of BKV reactivation from the gastrointestinal tract would require detection of BKV viral antigen in colonic tissues, direct demonstration of viral particles in stool by electron microscopy or detection of BKV DNA in the gastrointestinal tract by in situ hybridization in the absence of late gene expression in seropositive patients. These issues warrant further investigations.",
