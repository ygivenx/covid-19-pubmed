Early in the course of the outbreak, autopsies were restricted to in situ chest examination (three cases). As understanding of the mode of transmission of SARS progressed, complete examinations were performed with appropriate safety precautions (N95/N97 masks, disposable hoods, visors, gowns, aprons, and gloves) (17 cases). Post-mortem tissues were sampled for histology, microbiology, electron microscopy, and molecular biology. Lung tissues from 22 SARS-CoV-negative patients who presented with significant lower respiratory tract symptoms and signs, and who died during the same period were similarly examined for comparison.",

Of these 11 patients, 10 showed a diffuse alveolar damage-predominant pattern, with only one patient showing admixed areas of acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia (duration of illness=16 days). Among these 11 patients, eight (73%) died within 14 days of onset of illness, compared with only five patients (25%) in the SARS group. Of the eight patients in the control group who died within 14 days, at least five showed evidence suggesting underlying bacterial sepsis (three cases severe acute bronchopneumonia, one case acute pyelonephritis, one case pseudomembranous colitis), while two showed evidence of myocardial infarction. The extent of acute diffuse alveolar damage was similar between groups (mean score 1.95 in SARS group vs 1.55 in the comparison group; P=0.25), although among patients with duration of illness \u226414 days, there was more widespread acute diffuse alveolar damage in SARS patients than in the comparison group (mean score 2.80 vs 1.38; P=0.001). Consistent with the shorter mean duration of illness among the comparison group, SARS patients as a whole also showed a greater frequency of organizing lung injury than the comparison group (95% of patients vs 36%), and other histologic findings typically associated with organizing phase diffuse alveolar damage were also more prominent in the SARS group as a whole than in the comparison group, including pneumocyte hyperplasia (mean score 2.85 vs 1.27, respectively), squamous metaplasia (present in 75% of SARS cases, vs 9% of control cases), and multinucleated giant cells (60 vs 36%).",

This injury was, in general, more prevalent and more extensive among SARS patients than among SARS-CoV-negative patients who died with respiratory symptoms over the same period (Table 1), although there was a significant degree of overlap between the two cohorts. Other associated histologic features, such as pneumocyte hyperplasia, squamous metaplasia, and multinucleated cells, were also present in both groups of patients. Alhough some of these parameters were more prominent in the SARS group as a whole than in the comparison group, this likely reflects differences in duration of illness between the two groups, rather than differences intrinsic to the disease process itself. While not always readily apparent on routine H&E-stained sections, injury of the pulmonary vasculature was also a prominent feature of most SARS cases (Figures 5 and 6). This was manifested by intravascular fibrin thrombi and thromboemboli, associated in many cases with parenchymal infarcts. Such findings, however, were by no means unique to SARS cases, as similar findings could also be demonstrated in non-SARS cases showing diffuse alveolar damage. Thus, while lethal SARS-CoV infection was virtually always associated with severe and extensive acute lung injury, we found no specific parameters that would allow definitive diagnosis of SARS-CoV infection prospectively, as opposed to other potential causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome, based on histology alone.",

The reasons for this discrepancy between the present study and prior reports are unclear, but may relate to the longer duration of illness or therapy in patients in the current study compared to previous studies, given that all acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia-predominant cases in the present series had greater than 20 days' duration of illness (compared to less than 20 days for almost all previously reported cases). The significance of the presence of this pattern of injury, as opposed to classic diffuse alveolar damage alone, is also uncertain. Certainly, the presence of both patterns of injury side-by-side in some cases suggests that the acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia pattern may simply represent a histologic variant of classic diffuse alveolar damage. However, that some patients exhibited one pattern of injury almost exclusively suggests that other factors may be at play, and merits further investigation.",

Despite the prominence of certain features such as vascular\u2013endothelial injury in SARS lungs, the significant overlap between SARS and non-SARS cases makes it difficult, if not impossible, to differentiate diffuse alveolar damage secondary to SARS-CoV infection vs other etiologies, on the basis of histologic parameters alone. Given the persistence of virus in post-mortem lung tissue in the large majority of cases, ancillary tests such as RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, or in situ hybridization19 should be performed to rule out other etiologies and properly establish the diagnosis in suspected cases. While persistent infection by SARS-CoV may result in on-going lung injury long after the initial onset of symptoms, iatrogenic injury and coexistent superinfections may also contribute significantly to morbidity and mortality in certain patients.",
