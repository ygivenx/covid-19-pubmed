            "text": "Linear aRNA amplification is in vitro RNA-transcription-mediated amplification, and is also referred to as amplified RNA or simply aRNA. This technique was first developed and published in 1990 (ref. 2) as a method to amplify RNA populations, but since then it has been used for a number of other applications. In this procedure, Van Gelder et al.2 first used reverse transcription to create a cDNA copy of the RNA template, incorporating an RNA polymerase promoter into each cDNA molecule by priming cDNA synthesis with a synthetic oligonucleotide (oligo(dT)-T7) that contained a poly(T) and phage T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence. The poly(T) portion of the primer is used to select for mRNA species that contain a poly(A) tail, and the T7 promoter portion of the primer is used to direct T7 polymerase to bind to the promoter and synthesize an RNA copy of the cDNA template. This occurs after synthesis of double-stranded cDNA, when T7 RNA polymerase is added and aRNA is transcribed from the cDNA template. There is then a second round of amplification, in which aRNA is amplified through conversion of aRNA into cDNA, with random hexanucleotide primers used to intitiate cDNA synthesis. Random primers are used because of their random annealing property, which allows them to prime any RNA species for reverse transcription into cDNA. The oligo(dT)-T7 primer serves as a primer for second-strand cDNA synthesis, in which the T7 promoter is added to the double-stranded cDNA at the end of the second round, thereby allowing subsequent second-round aRNA in vitro transcription by T7 RNA polymerase. If necessary, a third round of aRNA amplification can be performed after the second-round amplification procedure (Fig. 1).",

After the second round, >1 \u00d7 106\u2013fold RNA amplification can be achieved3, which is adequate for the generation of microarray probes4 or a sequencing library4,5. This procedure has proven useful for amplification of RNA from single cells, which contain only \u223c10 picograms of total RNA6,7,8. Examination of expression profiles of single live cells has shown that linear aRNA amplification neither results in preferential amplification of certain RNA species (i.e., it shows no sequence preference) nor creates significant differences in the ratios of specific aRNAs in the amplified RNA population compared with those of the initial host cell mRNA abundances3,9. It should be noted that if there were bias in amplification, then the bias would be linearly amplified rather than exponentially as in PCR amplification. Furthermore, aRNA has been shown to provide an accurate and precise amplification product9,10,11,12. aRNA has been used extensively to generate probes for northern and Southern blotting, in tandem with PCR13,14 and microarrays4,12,15,16, and for sequencing of tissue-isolated RNA7,10,17,18.",

In many of the disease-associated studies, commercially available versions of the linear amplification technology have been used under trademarked names, including RiboAmp (Thermo), AmpliScribe (Epicentre), and MEGAscript (Invitrogen). Because aRNA is cell-type agnostic, it can be used in a variety of disease-associated cell types. For example, the transcriptome of platelets isolated from people with sickle cell disease27 has highlighted the role of metabolic pathways in the disease. Transcriptomic insights into brain diseases such as schizophrenia28, depression29, Parkinson's disease30, Alzheimer's disease31, and even brain microvascular injury have provided many disease-associated targets for further analysis. The study of cancer has benefited from aRNA analysis of a variety of cancers, including breast cancer32, ductal cancer33, liver metastases34, prostate cancer35, and various brain cancers36,37. An interesting application of linear aRNA amplification to the study of pancreatic cancer involved the identification of pancreatic tumor markers in saliva, suggesting that tumor-derived exosomes can provide salivary biomarkers of disease38. In addition, infection by pathogenic microorganisms has been identified in human samples by linear aRNA amplification, either directly through detection of microorganism-derived RNAs, or through biomarker surrogates in cases where changes in RNA abundance for host genes known to be modulated by infection are detected. This is exemplified by the detection of HIV39, influenza40, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus41 infections.",

When the antibody\u2013oligo conjugate is applied to fixed cells, the oligonucleotide acts as an APRA primer and is positioned near the RNAs that are associated with the RBP, and the degenerate sequence of the antibody-bound oligonucleotide can prime first-strand cDNA synthesis directly in situ in the fixed tissue section44. The antibody\u2013cDNA complex is then removed from the fixed cells, and second-strand cDNA is synthesized in vitro. The double-stranded cDNA is removed from the antibody by restriction enzyme digestion, and aRNA is obtained by in vitro transcription followed by two rounds of aRNA amplification. Using the APRA procedure, the authors were able to isolate RNA cargoes associated with fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) and identify hundreds of previously unidentified putative FMRP targets. Among the FMRP APRA targets that were tested, >60% were confirmed as FMRP cargoes via filter binding or ultraviolet cross-linking assays to directly assess interaction with FMRP and mRNA targets43.",

These issues can be overcome through the use of aRNA amplification for antigen detection rather than the standard fluorescence detection, as the protein-detection sensitivity can be increased \u223c109-fold over that of conventional ELISA methods. This aRNA protein-detection technique is termed immunodetection amplified by T7 RNA polymerase (IDAT) (Fig. 2c). Zhang et al.45 developed a method to facilitate aRNA detection of antibody\u2013antigen interactions by covalently attaching a double-stranded cDNA that contains a T7 RNA polymerase promoter in front of a reporter sequence to a specific antibody. After immunostaining with the IDAT antibody, RNA polymerase is added to the antigen\u2013antibody complex to linearly amplify RNA from the cDNA that is conjugated to the antibody. Because the amplification is linear, the yield of aRNA is a direct measure of the amount of antibody\u2013antigen interaction. A fluorescence-based modification of IDAT subsequently developed by the same group, termed fluorescent amplification catalyzed by T7 polymerase technique (FACTT), was successfully used to analyze low-abundance oncogene proteins in human serum46. Rather than using chemical cross-linking of the amplification primer to the antibody, FACTT uses streptavidin-labeled antibodies to bind the biotinylated amplification target sequence. Because streptavidin binds many biotinylated molecules with higher affinity than antibody\u2013antigen binding, the sensitivity of FACTT is greater than that of IDAT. RiboGreen, a fluorescent RNA intercalating dye, can be used to quantify the yield of amplified RNA. IDAT and FACTT should be adaptable to automation and high-throughput protein screening.",

            "text": "The coordinated activity of multiple cells gives rise to tissue-specific functioning. In this context the functional cell type is of utmost biological importance. Quantitation of the subcellular components and processes that give rise to cellular functions such as genomic DNA sequence variation, gene expression, methylation, and the creation of metabolites and proteins will improve the overall understanding of hierarchical cellular regulation and allow the construction of an 'architecture of cellular phenotype'. Such an architecture would enable the codetermination of genomic DNA sequence and expression state, as well as allow RNA and protein abundances to complement each other, with variations in dynamics and absolute and relative amounts of each cellular chemical resulting in specific cell-type designations. This will be possible only when all of these cellular constituents can be quantified in the same sample. The easy adaptation of the aRNA procedure to the analysis of different subcellular chemicals and biologies as illustrated above gives rise to the possibility of using this methodology in a multiplexed manner to simultaneously analyze multiple subcellular chemicals within a cell. Such multiplexing is currently possible for two chemicals at a time (for example, transcriptome and protein analysis), but adding further levels of analysis usually involves independent isolation of the additional chemical to be quantified, which risks differential loss of material and inaccurate interpretation of data. The linear aRNA reporting system, however, provides an opportunity to detect multiple biological entities in a single sample without specific isolation. This eliminates sample loss while harmonizing the detection output; because the RNA-polymerase-promoter-containing DNAs from the different detectors are transcribed, the resultant aRNAs can be used to deduce the proteome or other chemicals on the basis of the specific barcodes that are detected. For example, it may be possible to use APRA to detect specific RBP-associated RNA cargoes with unique barcodes in the same cell where the transcriptome is analyzed (both will be linearly amplified, but they will be distinct and distinguishable on the basis of different sets of barcodes). This would facilitate analysis of the dynamics of RNA movement between different subcellular compartments. As another example, when coupled with the use of antibodies to specific post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation or glycosylation groups, IDAT could be used to assess the biology and dynamics of such protein modifications at the same time as the transcriptome analysis. Careful use of barcodes in LIANTI-based DNA sequencing in conjunction with analysis of the transcriptome (using a distinctly barcoded oligo(dT)-T7 primer to prime amplification of the poly(A) RNA population) would allow analysis of both genomic DNA and the transcriptome in the same cell. One could take this even further by multiplexing more than two of these analysis procedures. For example, the transcriptome (assessed via the aRNA procedure), genomic DNA (analyzed by LIANTI), and protein (evaluated by IDAT) could all be analyzed in the same cell. Such combinatorial use of aRNA-amplification-based methods should enable the quantitative analysis of many cellular components and their associated biologies from a single sample, down to and including subregions of a single cell.",

RNase H is then used to digest portions of the bound mRNA to create RNA fragments that serve to prime second-strand cDNA by DNA polymerase (pol). Finally, aRNA is amplified via linear in vitro transcription by T7 RNA polymerase, using the T7 RNA polymerase promoter incorporated in the double-stranded cDNA. In the second round, first-strand synthesis is primed by random primers instead of the oligo(dT)-T7 primer by reverse transcriptase using the aRNA as a template instead of mRNA. After RNA denaturation, second-strand synthesis is primed with the oligo(dT)-T7 primer, which binds to the poly(A) tail of the cDNA created during first-strand synthesis by DNA polymerase. Finally, RNA is again linearly amplified through the enzymatic activity of T7 RNA polymerase acting on its promoter that is incorporated into the double-stranded cDNA2,3.

Because of the short length of the aRNA amplified by the procedure, the step that breaks long RNA into smaller parts in the original Illumina library protocol can be omitted. For strand specificity, deoxyuridine triphosphate is incorporated into the second-strand cDNA. After sequencing adaptor ligation, the cDNA fragments with adaptors at both end are PCR amplified, and ready for sequencing7,8. (b) RNA-binding protein (RBP)/RNA cargo detection (APRA). An antibody (Ab) to RBP is conjugated to an oligonucleotide and applied to fixed cells. After antibody\u2013RBP binding, the oligonucleotide (containing the T7 promoter sequence) is positioned closely enough to the RNA to prime first-strand cDNA synthesis in situ. After second-strand synthesis in vitro, the antibody is removed by restriction enzyme cleavage and the aRNA is linearly amplified by in vitro transcription using the T7 promoter incorporated in the cDNA. The aRNA product is suitable for PCR, microarray, and next-generation sequencing analysis43. (c) Protein detection (IDAT). A detection antibody is first generated by conjugation of a target-protein-specific antibody to a double-stranded (ds) oligonucleotide containing T7 promoter. In a 96-well plate, a capture antibody then binds to the antigen (Ag) of interest from a sample. After the addition of detection antibody to the sample, RNA is linearly amplified by T7 RNA polymerase from the double-stranded oligonucleotide template incorporating the T7 promoter. The amount of RNA product is indicative of the original amount of antigen in the sample and can be used for fluorimeter detection, PCR. or sequencing45. (d) Whole-genome DNA amplification (LIANTI). A LIANTI transposon is first created by joining of the T7 promoter site to a transposase-binding site. This transposon is then mixed with transposase to generate the LIANTI transposome. After the LIANTI transposome is mixed with DNA isolated from single cells, the transposase mediates random insertion of LIANTI transposon into the DNA and subsequent excision of genomic DNA, which is followed by DNA polymerase gap extension. After the addition of T7 RNA polymerase, single-stranded aRNA is generated that is capable of self-priming on the 3\u015a end. After reverse transcription, RNase treatment, and second-strand synthesis, double-stranded LIANTI amplicons tagged with unique molecular barcodes are formed and ready for DNA library preparation and next-generation sequencing11.
