            "text": "Cyclophilins, also known as immunophilins, are peptidyl-prolyl cis\u2013trans isomerases found in all kingdoms of life and all tissues. Cyclophilin A (CypA), the archetypal cyclophilin, is central to protein folding1, signal transduction2, trafficking3, receptor assembly4, cell cycle regulation5 and stress response and has an expanding catalog of roles6. Two of CypA's most important roles in human health are in controlling immunosuppression and viral infection. CypA is the target of the widely used immunosuppressive cyclosporine (1). The complex formed by CypA and cyclosporine binds to and allosterically inhibits calcineurin, a protein phosphatase, leading to suppression of the T-cell mediated immune response by means of an IL-2\u2013mediated downregulation of T-cell activation7. CypA is also an essential host protein in the efficient replication of several viruses, including vesicular stomatitis virus5, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus6, hepatitis C virus (HCV)8, vaccinia virus and HIV type 1 (refs. 9,10). During HIV-1 \u00adinfection, CypA interacts with the capsid protein gag and is packaged into budding HIV-1 virions9,10. Inhibition of CypA by cyclosporine substantially decreases viral titer in human cells11. The importance of CypA in lentiviral replication is underscored by the independent evolution in two different primate species of antiviral restriction factors that use a retrotransposed copy of CypA to provide viral targeting12. Despite the importance of CypA in immunosuppression, viral infection and other key cellular processes, the molecular mechanisms by which the varied and crucial functions of CypA are regulated remains unclear.",

Acetylated targets can be specifically recognized by bromodomain-containing proteins16.

However, because there are many CypA gene fusions in the genome, the origin of this peptide was ambiguous. Here we show that the free enzyme form of CypA is acetylated in human cells. We produced homogeneously and site-specifically acetylated recombinant CypA using an acetyllysyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNACUA pair that co-translationally directs the incorporation of acetyllysine in response to an amber codon18 placed in a CypA gene. This approach allowed us to perform structural and biophysical measurements on acetylated CypA for the first time. These results reveal how acetylation modulates key functions of CypA, including suppressing its catalytic activity, cyclosporine binding and calcineurin inhibition and altering its recognition of the HIV-1 capsid. Furthermore, the molecular details of these effects establish a general set of mechanisms by which acetylation can regulate protein activity.",

            "text": "Recombinant CypA is most stable in basic buffers between pH 8.0 and 8.5; however, the acetylated CypA rapidly precipitates under these conditions. By screening a range of pH and salt conditions using absorbance at 320 nm as a measure of aggregation, we found that the stability of acetylated CypA increased markedly in acidic buffers (pH 5.4\u20136.4). Under mildly acidic conditions, acetylated CypA was still soluble at concentrations around 3 mM. This suggested that Lys125 had a prominent role in surface electrostatics and that its acetylation had a substantial impact on CypA behavior. To assess the effect of acetylation on the physicochemistry of CypA, we determined the native crystal structure. Acetylated CypA crystallized in two different forms, one in an orthorhombic space group and one in a trigonal space group. We determined the structure of both forms to assess crystal packing effects. Crystal contacts are provided in Supplementary Table 1. The structures were refined to 1.2 \u00c5 and 1.4 \u00c5, respectively, with two copies in the asymmetric unit in the case of the trigonal crystal and a single copy in the case of the orthorhombic crystal. These are, to our knowledge, the first structures containing a specific, biologically relevant post-translational lysine acetylation. In both CypA structures there is clear density for the acetyllysine side chain, as evidenced by the omit maps (Fig. 2a,b). This further demonstrates the homogeneity of acetyllysine incorporation and shows that the acetyllysine has a well-defined conformation. Finally, the two structures and the two chains from the trigonal crystal superpose closely, with only minimal differences in the extreme N-terminal residues (Fig. 2c).",

Comparison of the active sites reveals differences in only three residues: Phe60, Arg55 and Lys125. The Phe60 side chain of trigonal chain A is rotated 90\u00b0 compared to the other structures. This is due to crystal contacts between Phe60 and its symmetry-related copy. Phe60, together with Met61 and Phe113, form a hydrophobic core at the base of the substrate binding pocket. Arg55 is a key catalytic residue, facilitating catalysis through stabilization of the proline in the transition state20. Differences in the side chain orientation of Arg55 in the acetylated and unacetylated structures are likely to result from the inherent flexibility required in this region to accommodate diverse CypA substrates. Acetylation of CypA does not therefore seem to distort its conformation or substantially rearrange the active site. However, acetylation does markedly affect its surface electrostatics. Calculation of the surface electrostatic potential using the Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver (APBS) shows that Lys125 provides the strongest patch of positive charge in the active site (Fig. 2e,f) and that this charge is largely neutralized by the acetyl group. Such a marked shift in electrostatics correlates with our observation that acetylation switches CypA from requiring a basic to an acidic environment.",

As we found that acetylated CypA bound cyclosporine 20-fold more weakly than the unacetylated CypA, and as the acetylated CypA\u2013cyclosporine complex mediates a twofold decrease in calcineurin inhibition, the total effect of acetylation on CypA-mediated immunosuppression may be multiplicatively larger than either of these individual effects.

            "text": "To determine how acetylation alters the enzymatic activity of CypA, we used a modified form of the linked chymotrypsin assay23 to measure the kcat/KM of cis to trans isomerization. In this assay, cleavage of a nitroanilide peptide substrate by chymotrypsin was detected by measuring the absorbance of liberated 4-nitroaniline. The peptide is also a substrate for CypA and contains a proline residue that at equilibrium is approximately 90% in trans and 10% in cis. The trans form of the peptide is readily cleaved by chymotrypsin, whereas the cis form can only be cleaved after its isomerization by CypA. Previous studies have used steady-state methods to determine the kcat/KM of CypA isomerization; however, this results in loss of data during mixing of the reaction \u00adcomponents. Moreover, this approach cannot differentiate the two kinetic events and therefore does not take into account any contribution of the fast cleavage of trans peptide to the apparent rate of isomerization. We used a stopped-flow spectrophotometer, which allows pre\u2013steady state measurement (owing to rapid mixing, <1 ms) and the resolution of separate kinetic events. Using the stopped-flow method, we observed two discrete phases in 4-nitroaniline production, corresponding to a fast cleavage step and a slower isomerization step (Fig. 4a). The molecular processes underpinning the fast and slow steps are confirmed by their relative amplitudes, which correspond closely to the expected cis\u2013trans distribution of the substrate such that the slower, isomerization step represents \u223c10% of the total amplitude change. By fitting each experiment to a double exponential, we obtained an accurate measurement of the apparent rate of cis to trans isomerization at different CypA concentrations. We then calculated the kcat/KM by fitting the increase in apparent rate (kobs) with increasing CypA concentrations to kobs = (kcat/KM)[CypA]. Comparison of CypA to acetylated CypA showed that acetylation decreased kcat/KM by 35-fold from 1 \u00d7 107 M\u22121 s\u22121 to 3 \u00d7 105 M\u22121 s\u22121 (Fig. 4b).",

We compared this structure to a previously solved unacetylated complex27 to reveal the molecular differences in the complexes that result from acetylation of CypA. The acetylated and unacetylated CypA:HIV1-CAN complexes superposed closely but with minor changes in the orientation of the capsid scaffold with respect to the CypA-binding-loop (Fig. 5a).

Altered HIV-1 binding\u2014namely, the switch from trans to cis proline in the HIV-1 complex\u2014is consistent with this reduced kcat/KM, which is a measure of cis to trans isomerization. In addition to switching cis/trans preference through charge neutralization, the acetyllysine also stabilized the cis conformation of HIV-1 capsid by making new hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions. The methyl group of the acetyl moiety formed a new hydrophobic interaction with an alternative side chain conformer of Ile91. This interaction resulted in main-chain changes that were propagated to C-terminal residues Ala92 and Pro93, altering their interactions in turn. In the unacetylated complex, Pro93 forms a hydrophobic stacking interaction with CypA residue Trp121. The rearrangement in the position of Pro93 caused by acetylation led to an alternative stacking interaction with the aromatic ring of conserved CypA residue Phe60. Finally, the acetyllysine mediated a new water network involving the side chain of highly conserved His126, the main-chain amide of Ile91 and two water molecules (Fig. 5b). Acetylated CypA therefore stabilizes the HIV-1 capsid in its cis form by engaging residues C-terminal to the isomerized Pro90 in a different conformation. This correlates with the proposed catalytic pathway for nitroanilide peptide substrates, in which the position of residues C-terminal to the isomerized proline alters according to whether the peptide binds in cis or trans28.",

We have solved to our knowledge the first high-resolution crystal structures of an acetylated protein, both in its free form and in complex with small molecules and protein ligands. These structures and accompanying biochemical and biophysical studies reveal that CypA acetylation antagonizes sequential binding and catalytic activities in the pathway that regulates the immunosuppressive effects of cyclosporine, decreases the catalytic efficiency of CypA cis to trans isomerization 35-fold and switches the binding of CypA from trans to cis HIV-1 capsid.",

Identifying the acetyltransferases and deacetylases that modulate CypA acetylation levels will be important in exploring how CypA acetylation modulates function in response to stimuli such as immune stimulation. CypA is widely expressed, yet different tissues show different CypA phenotypes. For instance, cyclosporine and its derivatives are potent inhibitors and widely used immunosuppressives, but their off-target effects are limited. A study on calcineurin inhibition by cyclosporine in different tissues found wide variation in potency that was not always explicable by variation in CypA levels29. Furthermore, HIV-1 interaction with CypA in different cell lines and different species gives rise to diverse and unpredictable phenotypes30,31. Differences in acetylation levels in different tissues may underpin some of this variation.",

            "text": "In binding to HIV-1 capsid, as in binding to cyclosporine, acetylation mediates its effects through changes in both the charge and water network in the active site. However, in the case of HIV-1 binding (and in contrast to cyclosporine binding), acetylation also mediates changes in the orientation of key interaction residues, generating new interactions and abolishing interactions present in the unacetylated complex. Disassembly of the viral capsid is an essential step in HIV-1 infection and may be catalyzed by CypA isomerization of the Gly89\u2013Pro90 peptide bond26. By reducing CypA activity, as indicated both by the enzyme kinetics and the altered substrate binding in the complexed structure, acetylation may interfere with this process and reduce viral infectivity. In addition to HIV-1, HCV has also been shown to require CypA for efficient replication8. As CypA inhibitors represent potential anti-HCV drugs32, it will be interesting to see whether acetylation affects the role of CypA in HCV replication. Finally, CypA is part of a larger CypA family, including proteins such as CypB that are almost identical in sequence and yet have discrete specificities33. Post-translational modification of CypA but not CypB may help differentiate their function. Acetylation may inhibit binding to some substrates but allow CypA to isomerize new ones.",

Histone proteins have been acetylated using semisynthetic methods34, but these methods are generally limited to the termini of proteins and yield small amounts of material, making biophysical studies challenging. Enzymatic modification with histone acetyltransferases is generally nonquantitative35 and leads to heterogeneity in the site and extent of acetylation. These methods of acetylation lead to inhomogeneous samples that are unsuitable for quantitative biophysical studies or structural biology. Our experiments demonstrate that homogeneously and site-specifically acetylated proteins that are suitable for structural studies and quantitative measurements can be made in excellent yield using an acetyllysyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNACUA pair18.

Acetylation alters both selectivity for this bond and the conformation of capsid bound by CypA. The acetylated complex is in yellow; the unacetylated complex is in gray. Red spheres represent waters from the acetylated structure; green spheres are from the unacetylated structure. Water w1 is conserved in the two complexes. Superscript H and C indicate HIV residues and Cyp residues, respectively.",
