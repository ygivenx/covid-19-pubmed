Infection is the leading cause of mortality in patients with myeloma and increased risk is due to disease and treatment-related factors [2]. The treatment for myeloma has undergone a paradigm shift with the use of newer immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) (e.g. thalidomide and lenalidomide) and proteasome inhibitors (PI) (e.g. bortezomib) as standard of care [3]. With this shift, there is evidence of a change in the epidemiology of infections in patients with myeloma towards predominance of viral infections, including respiratory tract infections (RTI) [4].",

In addition, we found receipt of ASCT, bortezomib and more than three lines of therapy were risk factors for vRTI on univariate analysis. There are several possible explanations for these findings. During a vRTI, the innate immune system initiates the host antiviral responses via intracellular signalling pathways and the release of interferon cytokines. These cytokines, including IFN-\u03b1, augment host antiviral response and activate the adaptive immune system, which plays a key role in subsequent viral clearance [7]. Corticosteroid treatment for myeloma reduces monocyte counts, function and trafficking to areas of need, whilst IMiDs reduce monocyte activation. Also, bortezomib disrupts NF-K\u03b2 which impacts viral antigen presentation [2]. In addition, patients with myeloma have disease-related immune deficits including defects in cell-mediated and humeral immunity that accumulate with progression of disease [8]. In addition, patients with myeloma are known to have lower levels of specific influenza antibodies compared to healthy controls [9, 10]. These factors may explain our observations that multiple lines of treatment are a risk factor for vRTI and progressive disease being the \u201cat risk\u201d period.",

The majority of influenza episodes (75 %) involved LRTID, which is substantially higher than that reported in previous studies of predominantly allogeneic HSCT patients (30 %) [5, 11]. Influenza episodes were associated with the highest proportion of ICU admission (41.6 %) and all-cause mortality rates (33.3 %) amongst all the RV pathogens.

Preventative measures and treatment should be evaluated in patients with myeloma to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with influenza infections. The rate of oseltamivir treatment in our cohort may have contributed to the observed mortality, as early treatment of influenza episodes with oseltamivir has been shown to improve outcomes [13]. Seasonal influenza vaccination is well tolerated, effective and results in reduced number of URTI episodes and hospitalisation, albeit from studies undertaken before current treatment regimens were instituted [10, 14]. Current national immunisation and international consensus guidelines recommend annual seasonal influenza vaccination in patients with myeloma, with Australian guidelines recommending two doses, 1 month apart in patients not previously vaccinated [15, 16].",
