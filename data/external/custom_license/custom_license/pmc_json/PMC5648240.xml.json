As anticipated, we observed immune system-associated BPs (Figure 1D), which encompassed\nantigen processing/presentation, immune response, and macrophage activation\nBPs (Figure S-1C). Investigation of BP-associated\nproteins identified temporal differences between the SOI and BM. For\nexample, immune-associated proteins (complement C4-B, IFN-inducible\nGTPase 1, and activated macrophage/microglia WAP domain protein [WFDC17])\nwere predominantly higher in the SOI-isolated cells. Interestingly,\nunlike complement C4-B and IFN-inducible GTPase, which peak in relative\nabundance at 1 and 5 d.p.i., respectively. WFDC17 increased \u223c10-fold\nfrom 1 to 10 d.p.i., suggesting a time-dependent discrepancy in immune\nfunction (Figure 1E).\nAdditionally, numerous cell cycle-associated proteins (e.g., Retinoblastoma-like\nprotein 1) were more abundant in BM-isolated fractions, proposing\nthat cellular proliferation of these myeloid cells is greater in the\nBM. Because metabolic alterations can contribute to immune cell function/differentiation,\nwe inspected the data set for metabolic proteins and observed a 2.1-\nand 8.4-fold induction of lactate dehydrogenase and glutamine synthetase,\nrespectively, from 1 to 10 d.p.i. in SOI-isolated cells; however,\nno change was observed within the BM-isolated collections (Figure 1E). These changes\nsuggest that SOI-isolated cells develop a more Warburg-like metabolism\nat 7 and 10 d.p.i..

To this end, we viewed these myeloid cells as\na newly recruited cell population at the SOI and then analyzed their\ntransition into existing paradigmal subpopulations in terms of surface\nmarker, gene expression, protein, and metabolic profiles. Our temporal\nanalysis reveals that SOI-associated CD11b+, Ly6G\u2013, Ly6Chigh cells undergo a time-dependent decrease in\nLy6C expression and display increased MHC-II expression and wound\nhealing characteristics at 7\u201310 d.p.i., suggesting maturation/differentiation\nduring the later stages of infection. Upon further dissection, we\nobserved that M2-macrophage-associated proteins and transcripts increase\nat 7\u201310 d.p.i. as opposed to pro-inflammatory/M1-macrophage-associated\nmarkers that are upregulated during the early stages of infection.\nSimilar to myeloid cells, there is a growing appreciation for the\nplasticity of the distinction between M1- vs M2-like macrophages.\nIt is now acknowledged that macrophages rather demonstrate a spectrum\nof phenotypic, functional, and physiological features of M1 and M2\nclasses and thus often display these features in a context-dependent\nmanner. It should be noted that many of the M1- or M2-associated features\nhave been originally discovered in the context of the macrophages\nthat were generated using defined in vitro growth conditions, such\nas through the supplementation of GM-CSF or M-CSF. Thus, it is possible\nthat cells differentiated in the context of the complex in vivo milieu\nhosting a myriad of soluble and cellular interacting partners bear\na differential pattern of M1 and M2 markers that is observed with\nthe in vitro-generated macrophages. In our analysis, virus-driven\nCD11b+, Ly6G\u2013, Ly6Chigh cells\nshow several M2-associated markers during the later phases of infection;\nhowever, at the same, these cells failed to show any congruent trends\nwith of Il4, Ym1, and Cd206 gene expression that have been described\nto be associated with the M2 phenotype.
