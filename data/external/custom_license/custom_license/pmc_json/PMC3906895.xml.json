A total of 108 cases confirmed with DNA sequencing and 23 deaths of H7N9 infections have been reported until April 24, 2013. This is the first time that human infections with H7N9 virus have been found and reported in the world [1]. Cases were mainly distributed in provinces in the southeast of China. Almost 64% cases had exposure to animals or visited a live poultry market [2]. Clinical symptoms and signs were of sudden onset, including respiratory symptoms in the early stage, high fever (\u2265 38\u00b0C) and cough, dyspnea after 5 to 7 days onset, and then severe progressive pneumonia. Some cases could rapidly develop acute respiratory distress syndrome and die [2,3]. This outbreak has received great public attention from all over the world. Its progress has been continuously reported by various media in China.",

According to the China Internet Development Statistical Report, there were 538 million Internet users (39.9% of the whole population) and 388 million cell phone Internet users by June 30, 2012 [4]. Internet users in China spend, on average, nearly 20 hours per week online [4]. They now have access to news and information through more channels including microblogs and social networking websites. In addition, they can expand news coverage by sharing and forwarding information online. Now there are millions of social media users and the number is increasing [4]. Sina microblog has the largest number of users in China, approximately 368 million users at the end of 2012. Web search engines are an important tool for Internet users to acquire information. In China, there are approximately 429 million users using search engine websites, among which Baidu website has the largest group of users [4]. In 2011, 77.2% Internet users preferred Baidu website as their first search engine [5]. The power of Internet users in China is becoming stronger, especially in public opinion leadership with increases in participation for big events. Reactions from Internet users can roughly represent public reactions to an event. Developed Internet and social media provide an excellent chance to understand public reactions to and clearly communicate about public health emergencies, including preparation, prevention, and control of emergent infectious disease outbreaks [6-8].",

The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics in 2003 and influenza A H1N1 outbreaks in 2009 have led to strong repercussions among the public and media. The public and media reactions during an outbreak period are a double-edged sword. Moderate reaction may arouse individuals\u2019 awareness of disease control and prevention, whereas overreaction could play a negative role in the population. During the period of SARS pandemics, there were network media information chaos, rumors, and public panic, including overbuying of medical-related products and the soaring prices of these products, which destabilized the society and caused many problems against disease control and prevention [9]. Control and prevention of emerging infectious disease outbreaks require public participation. How Internet users react to an emergent disease outbreak and how we can lead them to a proper response are extremely important for control and prevention of the disease in the population. During the H7N9 outbreak, we designed a study to investigate the potential roles of Internet surveillance on reactions of Internet users to the H7N9 outbreaks and provide evidence for government, health authorities, and the public to efficiently control and prevent public health emergency problems, such as H7N9, in the future.",

Both daily posted and forwarded number and BAI were positively associated with the cumulative case fatality rate of human H7N9 infection. Our findings indicate that the first 3 days of an epidemic is a critical period for the authorities to take appropriate responsible action through Internet surveillance to control and prevent the epidemic, including preparation of personnel, technology, and other resources; information release; collection of public opinion and reaction; and clarification, prevention, and control of rumors.

In the past, to obtain information on the public, community, and media reactions or concern, most researchers used questionnaires and telephone interviews after the outbreak [19-23]. In contrast, network monitoring can be timelier to know public reactions to the outbreak because it is a real-time surveillance during the emergencies and also it is very economical without consuming too many resources [6,7,13,16,24,25]. During this human H7N9 avian influenza outbreak, we obtained the information by Internet monitoring and provided timely policy suggestions to the governments and related shareholders who play a role in disease outbreak control and prevention.",

Our study suggested that the first 3 days of the outbreak was the period when Internet attentions rose rapidly. At this point, the government needs to timely and transparently release the information, including personal protective methods of the disease, which can ease public tension quickly [18]. During this human H7N9 outbreak, when the first human case was announced, the authorities timely released case numbers and disease prevention knowledge online, which may be one of the key reasons for the early decline of public attention. However, the high attention to this outbreak lasted 3 - 5 days, which is a good time for the Department of Emergency Control and Prevention to disseminate health education knowledge and skills through network and social media.",

However, other studies reported that although the number of flu cases rose, the tweets about the H1N1 influenza showed a downward trend [16]. This fact reflected that public concern or interests for the outbreak might be weakened along with the progress of the epidemic as information saturation sets in [16,27]. Our study showed public reaction was positively associated with the cumulative case fatality rate but not daily number of cases. When case fatality rate was high, the public attention was high. The public attention decreased with a decrease in case fatality rate. This indicates that the public attention decreases when the threat from the epidemic disease decreases. Our study showed a decreasing trend of Internet user\u2019s attention during the middle and later period. However, when there were new cases reported in a new province/city, the daily posted and forwarded number and BAI increased significantly, especially in the local province/city. This phenomenon indicates that the extension of epidemic area triggered more public attention than the increase of reported cases in the original outbreak areas. It is necessary to monitor the public reaction and take specific responses at that moment.",

The rumors of human H7N9 outbreaks collected in this study covered most provinces in China, and also spread quickly.

The uncertainty of emerging infectious diseases often generates the rumors, which also suggests the importance of early information release [19,25,31-32]. In this new age of social media, microblogs are easy to generate and spread rumors, yet they could also be used to clarify wrong information and stop the dissemination.",

The daily posted and forwarded number and BAI were collected from the Internet and could not be standardized because of lack of exact numbers of daily Internet users. Thus, the mean rank of daily posted and forwarded number and BAI only provide relative comparisons between provinces/cities with and without H7N9 cases, but there is not much meaning to comparisons among individual provinces/cities. Our study was limited to the first 25 days of the outbreak because the government stopped daily case reports, instead using weekly case reports; therefore, this might not thoroughly reflect public reaction after the first 25 days. Our study primarily focused on Chinese websites, which limits the representativeness of the public reaction from Internet users on English and other language websites. Our study is an exploratory study that was designed to use a quick way to obtain public reaction during the study period of a public health emergency. The qualitative research on rumors was simple and did not use frameworks to analyze because of the diversity of the information released on the Internet. The results of our study could be applicable to public health emergency response, but may not be directly applied to public health practice yet. Further studies with advanced methods or study designs are needed.",

Our findings showed the public reaction increased quickly during the early stage of the outbreak. The first 3 days could be a \u201cgolden 3 days\u201d for the government and public health authorities to release information in time and make the information transparent and open. The high public attention would last for a week; thus, this week could be a critical period for health education. Expansion of the disease into other areas has more impact on public attention than the number of cases reported in the same outbreak area. This implies that extra methods should be taken when the epidemic area is expanded. Rumors are always hard to avoid, but using media, such as releasing information via an official microblog, could be effective to quickly clarify rumors and prevent their further spread.",
