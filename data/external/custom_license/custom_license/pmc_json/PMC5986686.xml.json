Although the use of alcohol-based hand rubs is convenient, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends washing hands with soap and water when visibly dirty or visibly soiled with blood or other body fluids [2]. It is recognized that some antiseptics and alcohol-based hand rubs are characterized by resistant bacteria and efficacy gaps [1\u20133]. In vitro suspension tests and human challenge trials help to demonstrate which hand hygiene agents are fit for purpose, but variations in methodology affect the measurement of efficacy [7]. Ensuring that hand rub and hand wash products pass standardized antimicrobial activity tests helps to better understand and interpret efficacy results [7].",

            "text": "In Europe, the most commonly used methods to test hand antiseptics are those of the European Committee for Standardization (CEN), while in the USA and Canada, the standards of ASTM International (formerly, the American Society for Testing and Materials) are used. The CEN has adopted a hierarchical, systematic approach of product testing. In this concept, European Standards EN1276 and EN14476 are established initial in vitro methods to determine the bactericidal and virucidal efficacy of antiseptics and disinfectants [8, 9]. The next step in the CEN testing scheme is European standard EN1499 (for hand washes) and EN1500 (for hand rubs), each Phase 2/Step 2 hand simulation studies where the hands of volunteers are artificially contaminated with E. coli and the test product is compared against a reference procedure in a crossover design [10, 11]. To fill in gaps within the in vitro CEN testing, modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) was introduced in 2015 as a reference virus for the claim of virucidal activity against enveloped viruses for hygienic hand rub and hand wash products [9, 12, 13]. However, it has not been possible to develop a Phase 2/Step 2 test for enveloped viruses due to the lack of availability of a safe enveloped virus that can be ethically used in testing on volunteers\u2019 hands, and there is currently no standard in vivo test method for viruses. To fill this gap, a hand simulation test has recently been considered that uses murine norovirus (MNV), a non-pathogenic (biosafety level 1) non-enveloped virus, which is more resilient to antiseptics than enveloped viruses, as a model test organism.",

PVP-I has well-established general antimicrobial activity, particularly in relation to resistant organisms [2], demonstrating in vitro activity against Gram-positive, Gram-negative and some spore-forming bacteria (Clostridia, Bacillus spp.) and mycobacteria [2, 14\u201318] and a wide range of enveloped and non-enveloped viruses [12, 13, 19\u201322]. In contrast, CHG has good in vitro activity against Gram-positive bacteria and enveloped viruses, less activity against Gram-negative bacteria and non-enveloped viruses, and minimal activity against mycobacteria [22\u201328]. CHG resistance is a concern and has been detected in isolates of Enterobacter spp., Pseudomonas spp., Proteus spp., Providencia spp. and Enterococcus spp [29]. In vivo studies using artificial fingertip contamination have previously shown PVP-I and 70% ethyl alcohol to be more effective than plain soap in removing methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Acinetobacter baumannii and E. coli from volunteers\u2019 hands, while CHG was only significantly more effective than plain soap at removing E. coli [30\u201333]. In vivo virucidal studies are generally lacking; however, in a modified finger pad test based on the ASTM E 1838 [34] using MNV, PVP-I was shown to have superior efficacy to three alcohol-based hand rubs while 4% CHG and 1% triclosan showed no activity [35].",

The soap component of the CHG-containing cleanser should have mechanically reduced the viral count down to a similar level as the reference product, which may go beyond efficacy gaps. The bicationic character of the CHG molecule, that is responsible for adhesion to surfaces and retention of other components as observed in oral use [40, 41], may retain viruses too. This retention phenomenon is not only seen with viruses [42] but also with some Gram-negative bacteria such as A. baumannii [31]. It should be noted that, due to the established cumulative effect of CHG [2, 3], repeated use may result in greater activity than shown in single-use studies, although repeated use of CHG may also increase its known risk of development of resistance [2, 29, 43]. In contrast, PVP-I demonstrates less persistent activity [2, 3], but is not associated with development of resistance [44].",

            "text": "The method set-up of the EN1499 standard can be considered more robust than the ASTM E method, since it employs an internal standard (i.e., plain soft soap, 5 mL applied for 60 s) with defined success criteria, instead of measuring log reductions alone for pass criteria. Log reductions alone are subject to inherent variability in such complex biological systems as concentration of infected cells in the inoculate and the details of the individual hand wash procedure. The use of an internal standard also allows assessment of the biocidal power of the test product versus the purely mechanical/detergent-based removal of test organisms by non-medicated soft soap. Additionally, the EN1499 method has more power to demonstrate efficacy of the products tested due to the larger sample size (15 volunteers) compared with the ASTM E method and several previous fingertip bactericidal studies [30, 31, 36], which include 5 volunteers. The hand wash procedure was standardized as much as possible in our study by following the CEN procedure (in the meanwhile adapted by WHO) closely, and shorter contact times of 15 and 30 s were included to more closely reflect real-life use [45\u201347]. The use of various volumes and exposure times also provided further validation of the internal reference used. We have shown for the first time in this study that the bacterial testing from EN1499 can be adapted to MNV-based viral testing and may be a good basis for further virucidal CEN standards, pending further validation as interlaboratory tests. It may be hypothesized that antiseptic products which are effective against non-enveloped viruses such as MNV will be effective against enveloped viruses such as Ebola (EBOV), severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS- and MERS-CoV), influenza and other emerging viruses; this is supported by the results of in vitro suspension tests with the modified vaccinia virus Ankara [12, 13].",

In vivo testing is necessarily restricted to medically safe organisms to minimize the risk to healthy human volunteers, and therefore E. coli (strain NCTC 10538) was chosen as the model pathogen for EN1499. ASTM E1174 [48], the only other standard in vivo method employing the whole hands of human subjects, similarly suggests a single test organism (primarily, Serratia marcescens, or alternatively, E. coli strain ATCC 11229). ASTM E2276 [49] allows for using a variety of medically relevant test species (S. marcescens , E. coli, A. baumannii, S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger), but confines testing to the finger pads rather than the whole hands and only assesses the simple removal of test organisms from the hands with no internal reference. In vitro data on potential efficacy gaps [2] can be taken into consideration given the limitations of in vivo studies.",
