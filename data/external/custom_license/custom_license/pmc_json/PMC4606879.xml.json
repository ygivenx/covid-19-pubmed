            "text": "In conclusion, this study demonstrates that HSCT patients with rhinovirus infectious disease do not have worse outcomes compared with matched controls. Larger prospective studies are needed to study the impact of rhinovirus infection and disease on this unique population, including specific determination of rhinovirus subtypes associated with severe disease, the incidence and effects of prolonged shedding, or association with other lower respiratory tract infections. Until then, in line with current recommendations regarding the prevention of these infections,2 continued infection control measures in HSCT patients with suspected respiratory viral infections should continue both in and out of the hospital setting.",
