This method has been\nexploited in vaccine production, where small foreign peptides are expressed as\na fusion with the viral coat proteins. Essentially, an insertion site has to be\ndetermined in the virus genome so that the resulting product will be displayed\non the surface of the virus particle which is then propagated in plants and consequently\nisolated and used as antigen presenting vehicles [5, 6]. Modifications that do\nnot interfere with the normal functions of the particular virus are a\nprerequisite for this peptide fusion approach. One strategy suggests that\nforeign gene segments could  be fused to the terminus of a viral\ngene in a way that permits the production of both the fusion product and the\nnative viral protein, thus avoiding interference with normal gene functions. \nThe success of this epitope presentation strategy depends on a detailed\nknowledge of virus structure at the atomic level, which is only available for a\nlimited number of viruses.",

CGMMV is a tobamovirus with a genome size of ~6.4 kb\nwhich has been well characterized both biologically [8, 9] and structurally [10, 11]. In this study, a truncated dengue virus\ntype 2 envelope (E) protein binding region from amino acid 379 to 423 (EB4) was\ninserted into the end of the coat protein (CP) open reading frame (ORF) of a\npreviously constructed CGMMV full-length clone, pCGT7X [7]. The antigenic\npeptide was chosen based on a recent study that suggests its importance in\nenabling dengue virus to bind to specific host cell receptors (S. Abu Bakar  personal communication).\nThe present study explores the possibility of extrapolating the CGMMV antigenic\nepitope presentation system for developing diagnostics and potentially\ntherapeutics against dengue. The study was also used to challenge the size\nlimits of foreign gene insertion into the CGMMV vector as in the previous study\nthe hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) used was only 33 amino acids [7].",

Transcripts produced from the two\nconstructs were separately tested for infectivity by inoculating the host\nplants. After repeated attempts, both the pRT- and pRG-generated transcripts\ndid not cause infection of the inoculated plants (Table 1). There was no evidence\nof virus genomic material in the inoculated plant tissues tested (data not\nshown). It is speculated that the read-through sequence of TMV may not be suitable\nfor the CGMMV chimeric clones, hence contributing to the absence of infectious\nvirus transcripts. To overcome this possibility, another chimeric clone\n(pCG+FSRTRE) was constructed using the read-through sequence AAA-UAG-CAA-UUA of\nthe wild-type CGMMV itself (Figure 1). The template for in vitro transcription,\nbased on the pCG+FSRTRE clone, was generated through LD-PCR. The in vitro transcription products\n(Figure 2) were used in inoculation studies. The new leaves of plants\ninoculated with pCG+FSRTRE-derived transcripts showed evidence of virus\ninfection with four out of eight plants showing a typical symptom of CGMMV\ninfection, which include the green mottle mosaic appearance on day 14 pI (Table 1 and Figure 3). \nInfection could be detected through RT-PCR when total RNA of new noninoculated\nleaf was used as template. Detection of the virus by RT-PCR (Figure 4) suggests\nthat the viruses had moved from the inoculated leaf to new leaves. This implies\nthat the chimeric virus pCG+FSRTRE carrying the read-through sequence from the CGMMV\ngenome (AAA-UAG-CAA-UUA) was\ninfectious and that the virus particles were able to assemble. The plants,\nhowever, continued to grow without any further noticeable symptoms. Virus\nparticles were extracted from the infected plants and an aliquot was\nelectrophoretically separated on 15% SDS-PAGE (Figure 5) resulting in two distinct\nsuggesting that the virus population consisted of two species of coat proteins,\nthe EB4-CP fusion (larger in size) and the wild-type CGMMV CP (smaller in\nsize). The ratio of modified to unmodified CP was approximately 1:1.",

Previous reports\nshow that the efficiencies of the leaky UAG codon varied from 0.5% to 5% so\nthat the ratio of modified to unmodified CP would be between 1:200 and 1:20 [12, 19]. However, in this study, relatively high levels of chimeric coat protein\nwas observed (Figure 5) giving a ratio of modified to unmodified CP of\napproximately 1:1.

In this study, it is shown that the EB4 gene sequence\ncarried by the chimeric CGMMV was systemically removed during the infection\nprocess. The order of the removal of the transgene was speculated to be the 5\u2032\nto 3\u2032 direction (Figures 6 and 7). This is further supported by the detection\nof two additional nucleotides together with the read-through sequence\n\u201cCC-AAA-TAG\u201d downstream from the CGMMV CP ORF. This report shows the temporal\nin-host truncation of the transgene from a chimeric virus in a natural host. \nRecent report has shown truncation occurring in transgenic plants expressing\nthe same or similar transgenes as the chimeric virus [22] suggesting targeting\nby a resistance mechanism or competition with the parental virus as the\nmechanism involved. The exact mechanism of truncation of the transgene in our\nstudy is less clear as a previous study using the same vector and host with a\ndifferent transgene did not exhibit the same instability [7]. The larger size\nof the EB4 peptide in comparison to the Hepatitis B epitope, however, suggests\nthat the truncation mechanism or transgene recognition by the virus was size\ndependent.",

The reported limitation of low-modified\ncoat protein yield of this type of read-through transient expression system\nappears to have been overcome as relatively equal yield of chimeric and wild-type\nCGMMV coat protein were produced. This report also provides a rational\nharvesting timeline for the chimeric virus making this system exploitable for implementation in a\nplantation scale in the future. It can be suggested that once host plants are\ninfected with the chimeric virus carrying the inserted foreign peptides, the\noptimum harvesting time would be at around 14 dpi or not more than 20 dpi in\norder to obtain maximum yield of the full-length transgene. Growth of the\ninfected plants for longer periods to obtain higher yields of the chimeric\nvirus may induce unwanted transgene deletions. This and other factors described\nearlier should be relevant information for the further development of CGMMV or\nother plant viruses as vectors for medically important peptides such as for\ndengue (this study) and Hepatitis B [7] viral antigens.",
