But it was not until 1998 that George Matsumoto and his team at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in Moss Landing first got close enough to realize that it could be new to science. Rather than having slender tentacles, big red (Tiburonia granrojo) has between three and seven chubby arms that it uses to grapple with prey, and has been assigned to an entirely new subfamily \u2014 the Tiburoniinae.",
