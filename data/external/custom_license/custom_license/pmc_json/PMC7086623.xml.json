            "text": "Avian infectious bronchitis virus (AIBV), a member of the single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus family Coronaviridae, infects domestic chickens and causes major economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide [1\u20135]. AIBV causes disease in the upper respiratory tract, but it can also infect other organs such as the kidney and gonads [2]. Turkey coronavirus (TCoV), which causes acute enteric disease in turkeys and consequent economic loss, is closely related to AIBV [6]. Sequence analysis has suggested that recombination may have played a key role in the evolutionary origin of TCoV. Because the spike proteins of TCoV isolates were much more divergent from those of AIBV than were other TCoV proteins, Jackwood and colleagues [7] proposed that TCoV arose through a recombination event involving replacement of the S gene (encoding the spike or S protein) of an AIBV genome with one derived from a more distant, unidentified coronavirus.",

In the case of AIBV, there has been long-standing interest in recombination among free-living strains [7, 9\u201312], and the occurrence of recombination among genotypes has been demonstrated experimentally in vitro [13]. As the genomes of AIBV isolates have been sequenced, several naturally occurring genomes have been reported with novel gene sets and/or gene orders compared to those seen in classic AIBV isolates [14, 15]. The sequences of these genomes show the effects of gene deletion and rearrangement, processes to which recombination may have contributed.",

NJ trees of S protein sequences were constructed on the basis of the JTT distance, and ML trees of S protein sequences used the JTT model [19]. The reliability of clustering patterns in trees was assessed by bootstrapping [21]; 1000 bootstrap samples were used. Since the NJ and ML methods yielded very similar results, only the NJ trees are shown below; the ML trees are included as supplementary material (Supplementary Figures S1-S5). In all computations of evolutionary distances, any site at which the alignment postulated a gap in any sequence was excluded from all pairwise comparisons.",

In the absence of a high mutation rate, the most reasonable explanation for an unusually high level of synonymous divergence in a given region of two related genomes is that the region in question is more anciently diverged than the remainder of the genome, and that recombination has brought together anciently diverged and more recently diverged genomic segments. However, in the case of AIBV and TCoV, the mechanism involved need not have involved recombination with a distantly related virus [7]. Rather, it is possible that the degree of sequence divergence seen in the S gene has been accumulated since the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of AIBV and TCoV and that the other portions of the genome have been homogenized between these two lineages by repeated events of inter-lineage recombination since the MRCA.",

Although AIBV-like in the upstream genes from 1a though Env, Peafowl/GD/KQ6/2006 (AY641576) and Mass 41 (AY851295) showed a close resemblance to TCoV in the M gene (Fig. 3A). Similarly, the N gene of the AIBV isolate CK/CH/LSD/05I (EU637854) was less than 1% different from that of the TCoV isolate TCoV/TX-GL/01 (GQ427174) but nearly two orders of magnitude more divergent from a typical AIBV N gene (Fig. 3B). These results imply that there have been recent recombination events, causing near-homogenization of certain genomic regions between genomes that continue to differ markedly in the S gene. Moreover, the occurrence of such events suggests an important role for recombination in homogenizing non-S portions of the genome between the AIBV and TCoV lineages.",

Under these circumstances, it seems unlikely that the two viruses have opportunities for recombination. However, the hypothesis proposed here does not require recombination at the present time, but only recombination in the evolutionary past between the lineage that gave rise to AIBV and the lineage that gave rise to TCoV. The history of these viruses prior to their appearance as agricultural pathogens is unknown, but recent analyses of viruses infecting wild birds suggest that AIBV and TCoV represent just the tip of the iceberg of a vast assemblage of avian coronaviruses awaiting discovery and characterization [29\u201331]. Moreover, individual bird species may be infected by a number of distinct coronaviruses [29\u201331], as would be required for recombination between different viral lineages.",
