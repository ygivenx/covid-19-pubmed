The IBV genome consists of a linear, non-segmented, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA of approximately 27.6 kilobases (kb) in length, encoding four structural proteins: nucleocapsid (N) protein, envelope protein (E), membrane glycoprotein (M), and spike glycoprotein (S). The spike glycoprotein is translated as a precursor protein (S0) and later cleaved into the S1 and S2 subunits by cellular proteases [2]. The S1 subunit forms the tip of a spike, and the S2 subunit anchors the S1 to the viral membrane. The S1 subunit, containing virus neutralizing epitopes and serotype-specific sequences [3\u20135], plays an important role in attachment to the host cell, as well as induction of neutralizing antibodies [6, 7]. Therefore, the genetic analysis of IBV is mainly based on the S1 gene [5, 8].",

Some studies have indicated that IBV immunity is serotype-specific, and small differences in S1 protein may contribute to significant divergence in serotype as well as poor cross-protection [9, 10]. Three major factors account for the genetic diversity of IBV. First, the inaccuracy of the coronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) results in continuous evolution of the virus through point mutations, insertions, and deletions [11]. Second, IBV undergoes a high frequency of homologous RNA recombination due to its unique random template switching during RNA replication [12]. Third, immune pressure is exerted on circulating viruses by the constant presence of partially immune chicken populations. These three factors have not only led to a diversity of strains and genotypes, but also generated new species that can adapt to new hosts and ecological niches [13]. The design of appropriate control programs has been complicated by the large number of IBV serotype or genotypes [14], as well as the low degree of cross-protection observed among IBV serotypes [15].",

Various live-attenuated and inactivated vaccines derived from Massachusetts (Mass) serotype strains such as H120 and H52 have been widely and extensively used in chicken farms to prevent IB disease [16, 17]. However, the efficacy of current vaccine is poor as new serotypes or antigenic variant strains of IBV continue to emerge in China, and IB disease breaks out frequently even in vaccinated flocks. Since the QX strain was detected in Shandong province, China in 1990s, the QX-like genotype IBV mainly causing nephritis has become predominant in China [18\u201321].",

All the isolated strains were identified by RT-PCR for the N gene. The main features of each IBV strain are presented in Table 1. According to the analysis, 66.1 % of the new strains (41/62) were isolated in the winter and spring, which are cold and wet seasons in southern China. The age of the infected chickens, including 57 flocks of broilers and 5 flocks of layer hens, ranged from 9 to 285 days. Of the 62 new strains isolated, 37 (59.6 %) were from chickens between 10 to 30 days of age; 41 (66.1 %) were from chickens showing typical nephritis symptoms such as swollen specked kidney, distended ureter filled with uric acid, and severe dehydration and weight loss; 16 (25.8 %) were from chickens showing typical respiratory clinical signs including gasping, coughing, sneezing, tracheal rale, and nasal discharge; and 5 (8.1 %) caused a decline in egg production and quality of layer hens.\n",

Generally, IB disease can break out in any season and infect chickens of any age, but in southern China IB disease appears to have infected mostly chickens less than 30 days old and to break out in the winter and spring seasons when it was cold and wet. The classical IBV strains mainly affect respiration in chickens of all ages and cause a drop in egg production in layer hens. However, in addition to respiratory complications, nephritis gradually became the major clinical sign of IBV infection from the late 1990s in China, and proventriculitis was also reported [28, 29]. In this study, the recorded clinical signs showed that 66.1 % (41/62) of the identified isolates exhibited typical nephritis.

In the present study, nine different lengths of S1 nucleotide or deduced amino acid sequences were found, and the predominant length (nt/aa) was 1620/540. Alignments of S1 genes from the 62 isolates along with 40 reference strains showed a wide range of homologies among them. Many reasons may account for those sequence differences, the most important is that IBV is a non-segmented single-strand positive-sense RNA virus, and its error-prone RNA polymerase can easily generate nucleotide insertions, deletions, and point mutations in the S1 gene. This trait brings about not only variations of viral gene and protein sequences, but also potential changes in virulence and tissue tropism. Alignment of the S1 amino acid sequences revealed that there were three HVRs located at 60\u201388, 115\u2013140, and 275\u2013292 (numbered based on the S1 sequence of the H120) among the 62 isolates, similar to the previous studies [35\u201337]. It was obvious that the HVR was different from other genogroup strains. Actually, the divisions of genotypes were partly according to the HVRs [38, 39]. It was also reported that the serotype differences of IBVs generally correlated with variations in HVR of S1 protein [40, 41]. However, the significance of HVRs in IBV pathogenicity remains unclear.",

The predominant S1 protein cleavage recognition motifs were HRRRR (33/62) and RRF(S/L) RR (26/62). The motif RRIRR was first reported in 2011 [43], and it is not common in isolates from the field. The motif HRRRR is consistently present in Chinese IBV strains but not commonly observed in viruses from other countries [44], showing the continuity of evolution and co-circulation of many viruses with putative separate origins in specific geographic regions [45].",

            "text": "Recombination is another important mechanism of IBV evolution to generate variants in the field [46]. The unique discontinuous transcription system and the viral polymerase \u201cjumping\u201d possibly contribute to the high RNA recombination frequency in IBVs [47]. The recombination event is thought to occur by switching of the polymerase from one template to another during the genomic synthesis when the host is infected by two or more strains of IBV [17]. The S1 gene recombination reportedly took place between the Chinese QXIBV and classical IBV strains in countries around China, such Thailand and Korea, producing new variant strains and subgroups [23, 33, 48]. In this study, two isolated strains were detected as recombinant variants, and the recombination events between group I (QX-like) strain and group II (4/91-like) strain formed a new subgroup of group I. The putative major parental strain CK/CH/GD/LZ09, isolated in Guangdong province in 2009, was a typical QX-like strain-caused nephritis. The putative minor parental strain TA03 was reported as a real 4/91-like variant strain which was rarely isolated in China and the pathogenicity and virulence were verified by artificial infection [18]. The recombination analysis suggested that 4/91-like strains, as important genetic donor, have involved in the genetic recombination of IBV in China. The results also indicate that genetic recombination contributes to the emergence of new variants and sub-genogroups in southern China. Considering that the S1 gene is only a small part of IBV genome, the change of virulence, tissue tropism, and pathogenicity of the two strains caused by recombination need to be further studied.",

It is worthwhile to note that the isolation of group V strains had been increasing during the two-year observation period. The vaccine strains were evolutionarily distant from isolates and should be updated. The emergence of new strains and sub-genogroups can be attributed to sequence changes, such as mutations, insertions, deletions, and recombination events, which promote viral evolution. This work is part of our ongoing long-term surveillance program and highlights the importance of continuing to monitor the new IBV strains.",
