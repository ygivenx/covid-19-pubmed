Due to the transmissibility of the disease, healthcare workers who treat patients with Ebola may be at significant risk of contracting the disease.2 The mainstay of Ebola treatment is supportive in nature, and in endemic areas, it consists predominantly of fluid and electrolyte replacement.",

Trust and solidarity is advocated between healthcare leaders, healthcare professionals, and patients.3 Public health policies need to respond with proportionate impact in a timely and equitable manner.4 Policies need to be transparent and open to the scrutiny of healthcare workers, and healthcare workers need to be informed and updated during the pandemic.3 Health leaders need to facilitate emergency pandemic medical education to healthcare workers during a pandemic. In a pandemic situation, strained resources need to be allocated in an equitable manner. The World Health Organization (WHO), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the National Collaborating Centre for Health Public Policy (NCCHPP) advocate reciprocity for those who respond to the epidemic and expose themselves to greater risk.4\u20136 Decisions need to be based on evidence, principles, and values. However, in the era of evidence-based medicine, public health decisions are not always supported by evidence but by expert opinion. Although the decisions may be potentially contrary to their personal opinion, anesthesia providers are expected to follow and endorse these recommendations.",

Anesthesiology is heavily reliant on support staff, including nursing staff, anesthesia assistants, medical device reprocessing technicians, and biotechnical support. Anesthesia support staff are not held accountable to the same Canadian Medical Association (CMA) Code of Ethics as physicians; however, their presence is essential. Nurses follow the Canadian Nurses Association Code of Ethics for Registered Nurses. If an outbreak does occur, resources are further stressed and availability of support staff becomes even more crucial. Therefore, a unified response within the anesthesia department is of outmost importance.4 Anesthesia departments should become leaders in this domain and become health advocates to ensure preventative and treatment strategies are in place.",

Furthermore, Sokol and the WHO support the idea that \u201cduty of care is not limitless\u201d, often contrary to common belief.4,12 Unfortunately, we do not know the risks of treating Ebola in a Canadian context, and therefore, it is difficult to decide whether it falls within a \u201cstandard risk\u201d. Another opinion held by many ethicists is that physicians are accountable to a \u201cmoral minimum\u201d or \u201cminimally decent Samaritan\u201d when there is an urgent need to minimize the suffering of a person.11,13 \u201cMoral minimum\u201d and \u201cstandard risk\u201d are not set norms; they are thresholds that will vary among physicians.

Anesthesia departments should be prepared to respond to the pandemic effectively and in unison. Anesthesiologists should review ethical concerns in advance in case they are called for duty. If an outbreak does occur in Canada, anesthesia providers need to have an adequate skill set and presence of mind to respond safely.",
