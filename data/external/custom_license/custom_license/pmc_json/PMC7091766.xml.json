The Ebola virus outbreak currently sweeping western Africa has a mortality rate of 55\u201360%, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There are no approved treatments for viral hemorrhagic fever in humans; most infected individuals receive only supportive care. Now, scientists report a new strategy for treating Marburg virus using a tiny piece of RNA that interferes with its replication.",

The researchers constructed a scaffold made of silk protein fiber on which rat neurons were cultured in a collagen gel. Each scaffold was shaped like a donut, and these donuts were concentrically arranged to mimic the layers of the cortex, each containing compartmentalized grey matter and white matter regions (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 10.1073/pnas.1324214111; published online 11 August 2014).",

Yet they do not develop the insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes associated with obesity in humans and other species. To understand why, Lynn Nelson (Washington State University, Pullman) led a study of weight fluctuations and insulin sensitivity in six captive grizzly bears over the course of a year. The bears, which varied in age and sex, were studied before hibernation (in October), during hibernation (in January) and after hibernation (in May). The researchers found that the insulin responsiveness of grizzly bears varies seasonally, such that increased adiposity and insulin sensitivity occur during preparation for hibernation, followed by a period of insulin resistance during hibernation and a subsequent normalization of insulin sensitivity upon emergence from hibernation (Cell Metab. 20, 376\u2013382; 2014).",

            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome corona virus (MERS-CoV) is able to invade a cell after its spike protein binds to the cell-surface protein DPP4. Therefore, the interaction between the two proteins is an essential determinant of a species' susceptibility to MERS-CoV infection. In humans, the two proteins bind efficiently, making humans extremely susceptible to infection. In contrast, rodents, whose DPP4 is different from the human version, are resistant to the virus, and macaques, whose protein is similar but not identical to that of humans, develop a mild version of MERS-CoV infection. These variations have made it difficult to find suitable animal models for studying the virus.",

Therefore, the reconsolidation process may provide a therapeutic window for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other emotional memory disorders. Xenon gas can inhibit receptors that are involved in fear memory reconsolidation. Edward Meloni and colleagues (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) merged these two concepts into a study assessing the effects of xenon administration during the reconsolidation window. The results show that xenon can block fear memory reconsolidation, as evidenced by a reduction in the expression of fear-like behavior in rats in a conditioned fear model of PTSD.",
