A total of 1755 cases of SARS infection has been confirmed (HKSAR Department of Health, 2003). At the height of the epidemic, mask-donning Hong Kong people lived under widespread fear. People with chronic diseases had more reasons to worry: not only were they more susceptible to infection because of their already compromised health conditions (Drazen, 2003; Peiris, Yuen, Osterhaus, & Stohr, 2003), once infected they had a higher mortality rate (Karlberg, Chong, & Lai, 2004). Among the 683 chronically ill persons surveyed, over three quarters said they were afraid of being infected and had developed anxiety-related symptoms such as sleeping difficulties (Society for Rehabilitation, 2003).",

A widely adopted approach is Critical Incident Stress Debriefing (CISD), used principally with individuals who have undergone traumatic events (Mitchell & Everly, 1995). The debriefing process mainly involves recapitulation of the traumatic experience, sharing of symptomatic reactions, education on cognitive coping, and finally a summarization that invites positive learning from the experience. The intervention is time-critical, recommended within a relatively short timeframe (typically 1 week) after the traumatic event. Despite its popularity, efficacy researches on CISD produced mixed results so far (see e.g. Everly & Boyle, 1999; van Emmerik, Kamphuis, Hulsbosch, & Emmelkamp, 2002).",

These practical measures can also be empowering: a sense of control has been shown to be beneficial to the mental well-being of chronically ill people (Walhagen & Brod, 1997) and those who have experienced life threatening experiences (Havenaar, de Wilde, van den Bout, Drottz Sjoberg, & van den Brink, 2003).

Emotional coping skills are coupled with meditation, guided imagery, and breathing techniques. Spiritual reflection facilitates search for meaning in life.Culturally relevant: Many of the debriefing materials are borrowed from indigenous Chinese culture. However, practitioners should find little difficulty in adapting the message for clients in different cultures (e.g. for a Christian perspective on spiritual coping, see Baldacchino & Draper, 2001).
