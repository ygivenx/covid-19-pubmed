Proper planning before the event can help to prevent causalities and health problems. Countries with abundant resources often develop disaster preparedness plans to address MGs; however, many developing countries cannot afford to allocate adequate resources for such events and may seek assistance from other countries [9].",

The Arbaeenia MG is expected to increase in size once the political and security situation of the country stabilizes, as the operation department at MOH declared that the density of participants increased during previous years. The country\u2019s capacity to support the health needs of the MG participants is a concern as the health care infrastructure in Iraq has been negatively impacted by ongoing wars and sanctions affecting the country since the 1990s. Health care facilities have been destroyed during violent conflict, some of which have been rebuilt. In addition, Iraq has lost approximately 50% of its workforce of physicians since 1990. There were 34,000 physicians registered in the Iraqi Medical Association in 1990, and only 16,000 physicians were registered in 2008 [10]. The local health care infrastructure in Karbala struggles to meet the needs of the local community and is ill-prepared to serve the health needs of the millions of participants in the Arbaeenia MG. Information on the public health in MGs is needed to support the government in planning for Arbaeenia; however, there have been few formal studies conducted on MGs in Iraq [11]. Adequate preparedness plans are essential for handling medical emergencies during the Arbaeenia MG to prevent causalities and harm to population health.",

The area covered by the study constituted one-fourth of the distance of the road from Najaf to Karbala, which is considered the main road taken by most of the participants, especially those from southern provinces and who come through the Najaf airport, whereas the remaining three-fourths of the road had a similar distribution to the distance covered by the study. Hence, approximately 460 facilities could be available to serve the 14 million visitors with a facility to population ratio of 1:30,000 [12]. This ratio is below the ratio of primary health care units to population in Iraq (ie, 1:10,000) [13]. Other studies indicate a similar facility-population ratio, that is, 7.4:100,000 [14]. Using a similar assumption as above, the expected number of health care workers available to serve the visits could be approximately 2400, with a health worker to population ratio of approximately 1:6000. Limiting the total expected health workers to expected health professionals of 1065, the adjusted health worker to population ratio would be 1:13,000. This is comparable with the ratio of professional health workers to population in Iraq, that is, 1:15,000. These estimates show that participants in the MG had similar access to health care workers as the general population. The health care facility to population ratio for the visitors is worse than that offered to the Iraq population [15].",

Only one-tenth of the facilities had all the commonly used drugs for the situation. These drugs treat gastrointestinal, respiratory, and common chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes, which are common among the participants in Arbaeenia. Similarly, pain killers, antibiotics, and ointments used for multiple illnesses are needed when addressing the health needs of large masses that are at risk of respiratory infections and musculoskeletal pains because of walking long distances [16]; however, 32% of those who dispensed drugs were nonhealth care staff (Table 2), and this malpractice was reported in the Middle East countries [17-19], Saudi Arabia [20], and even in developed countries [21-25]. One-third and one-tenth of the Iraq population aged 25 years and older have hypertension and diabetes, respectively, and drugs to control the 2 diseases were available in almost three-fifths of the facilities [15]. Medical equipment for measuring blood pressure and blood sugar was also available in three-fourth of the health care facilities. For handling medical emergencies, only two-fifths of the facilities had access to mobile clinics and ambulance services for transporting patients to appropriate hospitals, which may not be adequate.",

However, only one-fifth of the facilities practiced all the identified infection control measures to protect individuals and environment and for proper disposal of medical wastes. The licensed facilities are relatively better than nonlicensed facilities in this area (Table 4). All facilities should practice all the infection control measures required to control the spread of infections and prevent hazards from the environmental and medical wastes. Medical waste disposal should follow special procedures developed by WHO [3,26]; however, less than one-fifth of the health facilities visited had a safe box for disposing medical wastes, which constituted one-half of the licensed facilities. Overall, there were weak medical waste disposal practices and infection control measures. The health facilities can be fertile grounds for spreading infectious diseases to the participants in the Arbaeenia MG and potentially within the region and at a global level.",

Thus, facility staffing, supply of drugs and medical equipment, and other necessary materials such as infection control materials were established without necessary compliance with MOH standards. The risk of mass causalities is high, and the government should develop an assessment and response preparedness plan that engages the temporary health clinics for future MGs to prevent causalities and health risks.
