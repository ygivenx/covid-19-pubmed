            "text": "The miRNAs are small RNA species (containing about 22 nucleotides) which are found in animals, plants, and some viruses. It has been shown that miRNAs play a variety of roles in many cellular processes including development, differentiation, apoptosis, cell cycle (reviewed in reference 1). Generally, miRNAs are derived from introns or intergenes of eukaryotic organisms or viruses and serve as regulators of gene expression 2. The miRNA-mediated RNA interference includes two patterns. One is perfectly base-paring with 3' UTR of target mRNA leading to degradation of mRNA. The other is imperfectly binding to target 3' UTR of mRNA resulting in the inhibition of mRNA translation. In mammalians, miRNAs perform RNAi through translation inhibition mediated through imperfect complementarity 3. As a result, a miRNA can directly interact with multiple targets and a gene can be targeted by many miRNAs 4.",

Increasing evidence indicates that viral infection results in the changes of cellular miRNAs species. In turn, the altered miRNAs also affect viral infection 7, 8. For example, SARS-CoV infection up-regulates miR-17*, -574-5p, and -214, and down-regulates miR-98 and miR-223. Of these miRNAs, miR-17*, -574-5p, and -214 suppress SARS-CoV replication and contribute to immune evasion in bronchoalveolar stem cells (BASC) 9. TGEV is an enveloped virus with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome and causes a highly contagious, fatal gastroenteritis primarily in less than 2-week age piglets around the world. The mortality rate of seronegative suckling piglets infected with TGEV can reach to as high as 100% 10, 11. The TGEV genome contains a leader sequence at the 5' end and a poly (A) tail at the 3' end. The TGEV genes are arranged in the order 5'-Rep-S-3a-3b-E-M-N-7-3' 12. The TGEV gene 7 locates at the 3'end of the genome. During TGEV infection, protein 7 attenuates host antiviral response by interacting with protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit (PP1c), a key regulator of host antiviral defense 13, and reduces apoptosis, immune response, interferon response, and inflammation 14.",

Therefore, we hypothesized that miR-4331 should target cellular gene to inhibit transcription of gene 7. In order to screen miR-4331 target gene, 16 recombinant dual-luciferase reporter plasmids that contain the binding site of miR-4331 target gene at 3' UTR of the reporter were constructed for the dual-luciferase assay. The luciferase activity of plasmid containing the 3' UTR of CDCA7 was markedly lower than that of the control (Fig. 3A). To generate 3' UTR mutant of CDCA7 mRNA containing mutations of conserved miR-4331 binding site, the site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the DNA sequence of wild-type 3' UTR as the template. Two binding sites of miR-4331 seed sequence at CDCA7 3' UTR were respectively mutated with the 3-bp substitution (Fig. 3B). To determine the direct interaction between miR-4331 and 3' UTR of CDCA7 mRNA, the porcine CDCA7 3' UTR or its mutant was respectively subcloned into the 3' UTR of a Renilla luciferase gene in a luciferase reporter psiCHECK-2 (Fig. 3C). The constructs were co-transfected into PK-15 cells with miR-4331 mimics, miR-4331 inhibitors, or negative control. Compared with the control, introduction of exogenous miR-4331 decreased the CDCA7-WT reporter activity by 64%, while overexpression and knockdown of miR-4331 using miR-4331 mimics and inhibitors did not affect CDCA7-mut reporter activity (Fig. 3D). To assess the specificity of miR-4331 binding, miR-4331 mimics, 4331 inhibitor, and CDCA7-WT reporter are co-transfected. The results showed that the miR-4331 mimics decreased the CDCA7-WT reporter activity and the miR-4331 mimics and inhibitors had specific binding activity (Fig. 3E). To determine whether miR-4331 inhibits CDCA7 expression, miR-4331 mimics or mimics control was transfected into PK-15 cells, and CDCA7 expression was assessed by western blot. Introduction of exogenous miR-4331 decreased expression of CDCA7 in PK-15 cells compared with the control (Fig. 3F). Knockdown of endogenous miR-4331 using miR-4331 inhibitors failed to increase the CDCA7 expression (Fig. 3G). This is likely due to the lower level of endogenous miR-4331 in PK-15 cells. Moreover, we observed that TGEV infection decreased CDCA7 protein levels in PK-15 cells (Fig. 3H), while downregulation of endogenous miR-4331 using miR-4331 inhibitors reversed the effect of TGEV infection on CDCA7 expression (Fig. 3I). Together, our data conclusively demonstrate that CDCA7 is a direct target of miR-4331 in PK-15 cells.",

We confirmed that miR-4331 suppressed transcription of gene 7 and targeted CDCA7 directly, but whether miR-4331 inhibits transcription of gene 7 by targeting CDCA7 is unclear. To test the effect of artificial siRNA of CDCA7, three siRNAs with different sequences were respectively transfected into PK-15 cells and the effects of silencing were assessed by western blot analysis. The data indicated that siCDCA7-2 was the most effective siRNA (Fig. 4A). The mRNA level of CDCA7 was significantly silenced by siCDCA7-2 (Fig. 4B), however the viability of cells was not affected by siCDCA7-2 in comparison with irrelevant siRNA (Fig. 4C). To detect the overexpression effect of pCI-neo-CDCA7, we measured the protein level of CDCA7 at 48 hpt using western blotting. As expected CDCA7 expression level in transfected group increased compared with the control (Fig. 4D). To investigate the effect of CDCA7 on the transcription of TGEV gene 7, we detected transcription level of gene 7 using real-time PCR. The results showed that silence of CDCA7 using siCDCA7-2 decreased transcription of gene 7 at 12 and 24 hpi and that overexpression of CDCA7 facilitated transcription of gene 7 at 12 and 24 hpi (Fig. 4E).

In this study, we observed that the expression levels of cellular miRNAs are regulated positively or negatively by TGEV infection. The miRNAs regulate viral infection through interacting with targets. Therefore, the miRNAs and targets form a complicated regulatory network during viral infection which suggests that this greatly expands the range of possible virus-host interactions.

To identify what gene miR-4331 will target to regulate the transcription of TGEV gene7, the potential targets of miR-4331 were predicted using TargetScan and miRanda. More than 600 potential targets were obtained (Supplementary Table S1). Since TGEV genes were not the potential targets of miR-4331, miR-4331 must target the cellular genes. We identified the potential targets and obtained a new finding that exogenous miR-4331 directly interacts with the 3' UTR of CDCA7 mRNA and suppresses CDCA7 protein level. CDCA7 is a transcriptional regulator that is directly targeted and activated by transcription factor E2F1 34. The E2F1 plays a crucial role in controlling cell cycle and action of tumor suppressor proteins 35. In addition, CDCA7 is a target gene of c-MYC and the phosphorylated CDCA7 regulates c-MYC-dependent apoptosis and transformation 36. Therefore it will be very important to discover the regulatory mechanism of CDCA7 during TGEV infection.",

For the whole study, numerous differentially expressed miRNAs and a quantity of targets of these miRNAs form a complex regulatory network to modulate viral-host interactions at any stage of TGEV infection. Therefore, more functions of altered miRNAs on TGEV-host interactions need to uncover and more targets need to identify in the future studies.",
