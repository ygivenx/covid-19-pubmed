In the cited series of infection in pregnant subjects, the 5 neonates, born between 27 and 36 wks gestation, were not infected by the H1N1 [1]. In a previous series of SARS-CoV (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Coronavirus) infection in pregnant women, infants born to mothers with the respiratory viral infection did not acquire the infection through vertical transmission [2].",
