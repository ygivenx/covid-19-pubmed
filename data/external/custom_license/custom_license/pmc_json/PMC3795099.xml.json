It left an estimated 230,000 people dead, 300,000 people injured, and 1.3 million people homeless. The impact of the earthquake on the structures of the health sector was dramatic. The three most affected departments in the country, Nippes, Ouest, and Sud-Est, experienced severe damage or complete destruction of 60% of their hospitals. Management capabilities of the MSPP were also greatly affected, because 40% of MSPP buildings and training facilities were destroyed; also, 67% of MSPP staff were left homeless. Around 600,000 people were internally displaced to other departments because of the earthquake, causing a new category of vulnerable persons to emerge in the form of internally displaced persons (IDPs). The increase in IDPs put pressure on host populations and local healthcare systems.2",

These sites became the post-disaster National Sentinel Site Surveillance (NSSS) System.3 In addition, a complementary system was developed to support disease surveillance among IDPs. This system, known as the IDP Surveillance System (IDPSS), was created by the MSPP, PAHO/WHO, and CDC to monitor communicable diseases in temporary clinics serving IDPs after the earthquake.4 The MSPP with CDC support also expanded diagnostic capacity at the national laboratory of Haiti (Laboratoire National de Sant\u00e9 Publique) to identify reportable pathogens, including Vibrio cholerae.5",

The absence of health facilities in many areas and any practical knowledge about cholera as well as the poor pre- and post-earthquake water, sanitation, and living conditions throughout Haiti posed a major public health threat as cholera began to spread. The lack of experience and capacity of local actors in assessment resulted in an underestimation of the speed at which cholera would become a major outbreak across the entire country and rapidly overwhelm the already limited national capacity to respond.7 Outbreaks in remote rural areas were of special concern, because of both scant resources and limited infrastructure to treat cases and implement cholera prevention activities.",

The IHR (2005) expand the range of events that States must notify to the WHO and to which the regulations apply, and they introduce a new class of event, the Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Other substantive changes consist of the inclusion of a decision instrument to facilitate the identification of the new events to be reported, the requirement for Member States to establish National IHR Focal Points for communication with WHO and develop core capacities for surveillance and response, and the new responsibilities of the WHO.1",

A rapid risk assessment was done by the A&R national team, and as a result, the MSPP and partners were alerted of the high risk of further spread into the Ouest Department and specifically, to the metropolitan area of Port-au-Prince, both of which had previously been defined as very vulnerable to cholera spread. This alert proved of vital importance given the fact that several partners were, at that time, scaling down cholera activities. Two weeks later, by May 21, a significant increase in cholera alerts was reported in the metropolitan area (EW 21 of 2011) (Figures 6\n and 7).",

Despite the support, the involvement of national officials in running the A&R System remained a challenge because of a lack of resources and the limited technical capacity available. To date, the system is still operating, with the MSPP staff supported by the epidemiologists of the PAHO/WHO Country Office. To ensure that reports on alerts reach both the MSPP epidemiologists on the field and departmental coordinators as well as the managers of the MSPP's CTCs and CTUs, the MSPP distributed cell phones to them and developed a system with PAHO for transmitting data through text messages. Training visits on entering data were conducted by PAHO in each department, and an MSPP statistician has been trained to analyze data from all departments.",
