We are only beginning to understand how these two systems are coordinated to maintain this delicate balance. It is generally thought that innate immunity combats infection immediately, whereas adaptive immunity reacts only after a delay of several days. This suggests that adaptive immunity should not influence the early innate response. In this issue of Nature Medicine, however, Kim et al.1 reveal that T cells of the adaptive immune system actively suppress the cells of the innate immune system to prevent an overzealous early innate response and severe immunopathology.",

These pattern-recognition receptors, such as the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), trigger a variety of antimicrobial responses to combat the infection. When the innate immune system is unable to contain an infection, the cells of the adaptive immune system step in as a second line of defense.",
