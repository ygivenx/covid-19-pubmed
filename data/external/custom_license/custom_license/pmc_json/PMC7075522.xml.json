Infected macaques showed\nlungs with broadened interval and visible macrophage infiltration\nwith alveolar epithelial hyperplasia.

Consistent with previous reports, Jiang\u2019s\nlaboratory reported that the M1\u2013131 and M132\u2013162 peptides32 from the membrane protein and the N153\u2013178\nand N362\u2013412 peptides from the N protein33 were highly reactive with all convalescent-phase test sera\nfrom SARS patients. The laboratories of Wu and Che collaboratively\nidentified three conformational (amino acids 1\u201369, 68\u2013213,\nand 337\u2013422) and three linear (amino acids 1\u201369, 121\u2013213,\nand 337\u2013422) epitopes on the full-length N protein that were\nimmunodominant.34 Using a \u201csplit\nand mix\u201d combinatorial strategy, we synthesized an overlapping\npeptide library spanning all four structural proteins of the SARS-CoV\nBJ01 strain, including the envelope (E), membrane (M), nucleocapsid\n(N), and spike (S). We screened this peptide library with antisera\nfrom convalescent SARS patients and identified dominant peptide epitopes\nrecognized by anti-SARS IgG.35 Further\nexperiments in this paper indicate that three peptides in the S protein\n(S471\u2013503, S604\u2013625, and S1164\u20131191) were strongly bound by SARS-CoV-specific\nhuman IgG from 12.8, 32.6, and 13.9%, respectively, of the 470 SARS\npatients (Table 1).\nExtension of the peptides (Table S2) to\nfurther characterize the epitopes\u2019 N- and C-termini identified\na new immunodominant peptide (S597\u2013625), which was\nrecognized by antisera from 64% of the patients (Table 1). The S597\u2013625 peptide specifically reduced the titer of human IgG in convalescent\nsera from SARS patients who reacted with SARS-CoV viral lysates (Figure 2A). We studied sequentially\ncollected sera from 21 convalescent SARS patients whose sera (obtained\n3 months after onset of infection) strongly reacted with the S597\u2013625 peptide. The antisera from these patients continued\nto recognize the S597\u2013625 at 12 months [12/21 (57.1%)],\n18 months [7/21 (33.3%)], and 24 months [6/21 (28.6%)] after the onset\nof SARS (Figure 2B),\nimplying that the S597\u2013625 peptide is a major immunodominant\npeptide in humans and elicits a long-term B-cell memory response after\nnatural infection with SARS-CoV.",

Using an HL-CZ human promonocyte cell\nline, Chen and Huang found that higher concentrations of antisera\ncollected from SARS-CoV-infected patients facilitated SARS-CoV infection\nand induced higher levels of virus-induced apoptosis. They further\ndemonstrated that this phenomenon occurred via antispike protein antibodies\nthat mediated ADE, but not via anti-N protein antibodies.42 Bruzzone and Jaume\u2019s laboratory showed\nthat antispike immune serum increased infection of human monocyte-derived\nmacrophages by replication-competent SARS-CoV as well as by spike-pseudotyped\nlentiviral particles (SARS-CoVpp), although they did not clarify whether\nthis enhancement was through the Fc\u03b3RII pathway.43 Jaume et al. reported that a recombinant, full-length\nspike protein trimer potentiated infection of human B cell lines,\ndespite eliciting a neutralizing and protective immune response in\nrodents. The study demonstrated that antispike immune serum, while\ninhibiting viral entry in a permissive cell line, potentiated infection\nof immune cells by SARS-CoV spike-pseudotyped lentiviral particles,\nas well as by replication-competent SARS coronavirus. Jaume and collaborators\nproposed that ADE of SARS-CoV utilizes a novel cell entry mechanism\ninto immune cells.44",
