Despite any virus susceptible to cause an infection after ingestion of water could be considered a waterborne virus, most reported incidents of waterborne illness are actually related to gastroenteritis or hepatitis. The leading cause of gastroenteritis is norovirus (NoV), implicated in 20% of all cases worldwide, although other viruses such as rotaviruses, astroviruses, adenoviruses and sapoviruses have also been implicated in waterborne transmission of gastroenteritis (Bosch 2007). Regarding hepatitis, hepatitis A virus (HAV) is the foremost agent of acute hepatitis and waterborne hepatitis A outbreaks have been globally reported (Pint\u00f3 et al. 2010), while hepatitis E virus is an emerging waterborne agent in the developing world, mostly by infection with genotype 1 virus, and much less frequently by genotype 2 virus (Kamar et al. 2014).",

Nevertheless, some relevant enveloped pathogenic viruses are documented to be also found in the human gastrointestinal tract, among them coronaviruses (CoV) that cause serious respiratory diseases such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome or SARS, reported in November 2002, with considerable shedding of the virus in stools (Chu et al. 2005). In fact, the environmental transmission of SARS was reported in a large, private apartment complex (McKinney et al. 2006). Another emerging CoV, the human Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), initially reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012, is found in the urine and feces of infected animals (Dudas et al. 2018) and in human feces as well (Zhou et al. 2017; Drosten 2013). Other examples of enveloped viruses with potential waterborne spread are avian influenza viruses, such as the highly pathogenic H5N1. Despite their replication is primarily in the respiratory tract, avian influenza viruses induce a generalized infection in birds with actual replication in the gastrointestinal duct with abundant virus shedding in feces (Zhang et al. 2006; Worobey 2008).",

Studies on the survival of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus in water evidenced the capacity of the virus to remain infectious for at least 200 days at 4 \u00b0C (Dublineau et al. 2011). Van Doremalen and coworkers (2013) ascertained the stability of MERS-CoV under different environmental conditions. MERS-CoV was more stable at low temperature/low humidity conditions and could still be recovered after 48 h. During aerosolization of MERS-CoV, no decrease in stability was observed at 20 \u00b0C and 40% relative humidity. Another study employing infectious animal CoV as surrogates for human CoV pointed to their survival on surfaces for up to 28 days (Casanova et al. 2010).",

The PUR46-MAD strain of TGEV is attenuated, producing very mild or no enteritis and no mortality in conventional non-colostrum-deprived piglets, and absolutely no pathogenic at all for humans. TGEV was employed as a surrogate for not only human CoV such as MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV, but for generic enveloped viruses as well. ST (swine testis) cells grown in Eagle Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) were infected at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of one, as described elsewhere (Bailey et al. 2004). Infected cell supernatants were collected and kept at \u2212 80 \u00b0C. Cycles of freeze-thawing were avoided to prevent enveloped particle disruption. High-titer HAV stocks (strain HM175 43c) were produced in FRhK-4 cell monolayers grown in MEM with 15% inactivated FBS, employing a m.o.i. of 1, and purified after lysing host cell membranes by the addition of a nonionic detergent (1% NP-40) to the infected cell supernatants, as described elsewhere (Costafreda et al. 2014).",

Considering both practicability and performance, recircularization of the eluent at pH 11.0 for 20 min was the elution procedure of choice.

Last but not least, characterization of the strains isolated from the water environment supplies valuable environmental epidemiology data that may provide a comprehensive overview of all viruses circulating in the community, encompassing not only viral agents causing symptomatic infections but also those that cause asymptomatic infections that otherwise remain unnoticed.",

Upon autoclaving, used glass wool may be readily disposed as recyclable waste. However, in our hands, the standard glass wool concentration method does not perform well for enveloped viruses and hence we adapted the procedure to concentrate enveloped viruses without dampening the recoveries of non-enveloped virus particles that remain the usual targets in environmental surveillance studies. By modifying the elution conditions, the recoveries of both types of viruses after glass wool concentration were dramatically improved, increasing from 7.2% and 2.6\u201325.7% and 18.8%, for non-enveloped and enveloped viruses, respectively. An additional improvement in the virus concentration efficiencies was observed doubling the concentration of PEG, from 10 to 20%, to perform the precipitation employed for virus reconcentration. In this way, 20% PEG provided increases in the recovery of non-enveloped and enveloped viruses of up to 56.3% and 66.6%, respectively, compared to 10% PEG (data not shown).",

HAV was detected in 38% of the samples (8/21), while only one sample came out positive for a rat CoV belonging to lineage A of genus Alphacoronavirus, closely related to a CoV reported in European rats (Tsoleridis et al. 2016) that, together with the Lucheng virus described in China, form a distinct rodent/shrew-specific clade (Wang et al. 2015; Ge et al. 2017). The sole remit of the limited survey performed in Riyadh surface waters was to ascertain the validity of the concentration procedure for the comprehensive monitoring of the presence of non-enveloped and enveloped viruses in the environment. Noteworthy, the same methodology has enabled the very recent detection of alpha CoV, phylogenetically related to the one detected in Wadi Hanifa, in water samples from the metropolitan area of Barcelona (data not shown). No data exist on the potential zoonotic transmission of rodent CoV to humans.",

Although several CoV may be spread through the fecal-oral route, the potential waterborne transmission of MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV remains unlikely, despite the considerable shedding of both viruses in human stool (Chu et al. 2005; Drosten 2013) and, in the case of MERS-CoV, in camel stool too (Dudas et al. 2018). Nevertheless, there is evidence that environmental factors played an important role in the rapid spread of SARS infection throughout a large, private apartment complex (McKinney et al. 2006) and that the human gut may serve as an alternative infection route for MERS-CoV (Zhou et al. 2017).",
