To our knowledge, this sign has not been previously associated with dengue. Awareness of this possible clinical finding could help in the early recognition of dengue and potentially reduce illness and death associated with dengue virus infection. Clinical features that can be used in the initial assessment of febrile patients are essential tools for clinicians, especially in limited resource settings.",

Singapore recorded >14,000 cases in 2005, its highest annual figure (2). No specific clinical features distinguish dengue from other febrile illnesses (3); thus, diagnosis relies heavily on results of laboratory investigations. Virus-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies only become detectable after 5\u20137 days, and false-positive results can confound the diagnosis. PCR is a useful diagnostic tool; however, it is limited by the short duration of viremia and requirements for sophisticated laboratory support (4).",

(7) showed depressed myocardial contractility and suboptimal heart rate response in some patients with dengue hemorrhagic fever. Acute reversible hypokinesia and reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction was also reported by Wali et al. (8). The underlying mechanisms were postulated to be immune in origin, although myocarditis may be a contributory factor. Fever production in response to exogenous pyrogens is believed to be mediated mostly by cytokine prostaglandin pathways, and neural input is important in the early phases of fever (9). Concentrations of cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor, interferon- \u03b3, interleukin-8 (IL-8), IL-10, and IL-12, are substantially increased during dengue infection. Their levels likely correlate with specific clinical manifestations and illness severity (10). The relationship of cytokines to relative bradycardia is unknown. Further studies could consider the relative importance of immune and neural mechanisms and also any direct cardiac pathology in the etiology of dengue-associated relative bradycardia.",
