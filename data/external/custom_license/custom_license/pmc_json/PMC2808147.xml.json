            "text": "FRET-based titration assays have been used to directly detect free energy differences between a \u201creference\u201d structure and a related \u201ctest\u201d structure of DNA, which allows calculation of the free energy for the test structure (53). Figure 2A illustrates the application of this method for measuring the free energy of an RNA pseudoknot. The pseudoknot (P) is labeled with fluorescein at the 3\u2032 end and acts as the FRET donor strand. The fluorescence intensity for the pseudoknot at 10 nM in 250 \u03bcL of standard melting buffer is measured and used as the starting point of the titration. In comparison to the BWYV pseudoknot reported elsewhere (44,45), which is named 437D PSK (Figure 1B), there is a GC dangling 3\u2032 end here (Figure 2A), so the fluorescein is not directly adjacent to the pseudoknot. This construct is called PSK 1. The free energy contribution for this dangling 3\u2032 end was measured by melting the model duplexes 5\u2032CUGGC/3\u2032FCGGACCG and 5\u2032CUGGC/3\u2032GACCG, where F is fluorescein. To measure the free energy change for the formation of PSK 1, a strand was designed to be Watson\u2212Crick complementary to the sequence at the 3\u2032 end of the pseudoknot so that its binding could compete with formation of stem 2 and thus unfold the pseudoknot. This strand was labeled with a quencher (Iowa Black FQ) to serve as an acceptor and named competitor 1. Titrations were performed in 1.0 M NaCl, 20 mM sodium cacodylate, and 0.5 mM Na2EDTA, at pH 6.0, 7.0, or 8.0. Aliquots of a mixture of the concentrated acceptor strand and 10 nM donor strand were added to a 10 nM donor strand solution, so the donor concentration remains constant. Aliquots were added until the fluorescence intensity remained constant within experimental error. There were typically 10 points (at least seven points) in the titration curves, from point zero to saturation. In this process, the competitor strand will break the pseudoknot and form a reference structure, whose free energy can be predicted with the INN-HB model (39) combined with hairpin loop (60) and dangling end (61,62) free energy parameters (see the Supporting Information).",

Thus, a fluorescence competition assay does not require a non-nucleotide quencher. This permits a fluorescence competition assay in which only the short competition strand is labeled, which is more economical than synthesizing fluorescently labeled pseudoknots (Figure 2B). In this case, the equilibrium is forced to shift to the reference structure with an increase in the pseudoknot concentration. The free energy of this reference structure can be calculated by combination of optical melting results with duplex 5\u2032GAACAAACGG/3\u2032AACUUGUUUGF (Table 1) and the INN-HB model (39) with hairpin loop (60) and coaxial stacking (63) free energy parameters (see the Supporting Information).",

For PSK-CG, the competition strand was 5\u2032FCGUUUGUUC3\u2032, to allow saturated binding at convenient concentrations of the pseudoknot. Table 2 lists the measured \u0394G370 values for the transition from pseudoknot to hairpin (PSK\u2212HP) and from unfolded RNA to pseudoknot (PSK), along with predictions by the statistical polymer model (SPM) of Cao and Chen (42) and the NUPACK model (33). The value of \u0394G37,PSK\u2212HP0 shows the relative stability of the pseudoknot to the stem 1 hairpin, which is important for the function of many pseudoknots (18,27,30,31). Some mutations make the free energy of the pseudoknot more favorable, but it may not make the pseudoknot more stable relative to the corresponding hairpin and vice versa. Table 2 also lists the changes (\u0394\u0394G370) of \u0394G370 for the transitions due to mutations to PSK 2. This provides insight into the effects of different factors on pseudoknot stability.",

Nixon and Giedroc conducted the measurement in 0.5 M K+ buffer (pH 6.0, 7.0, and 8.0) with a pseudoknot concentration of 34.8 \u03bcM. Soto et al. used 0.5 M Na+ buffer (pH 7.0) with \u223c1.8 \u03bcM pseudoknot and reported their results for \u0394H0 and Tm, which allows \u0394G370 to be calculated from the relation \u0394G370 = \u0394H0 \u2212 310.15\u0394H0/Tm. Both groups obtained their thermodynamics from deconvoluting UV melting or DSC curves with overlapping transitions. They assign the melting curves in the same way, i.e., as three two-state transitions in the thermal denaturation: F \u2192 PK \u2192 S1 \u2192 U, where F is a completely folded pseudoknot, including tertiary interactions, PK is the secondary structure of the pseudoknot, S1 is the stem 1 hairpin corresponding to the pseudoknot, and U is the completely unfolded pseudoknot. The sum of the first two transitions (F \u2192 PK \u2192 S1) corresponds to the 437D PSK\u2212HP transition measured here. The sum of \u0394G370 for the F \u2192 PK and PK \u2192 S1 transitions is listed under \u0394G370 for the 437D PSK\u2212HP transition in Table 3. As Soto et al. stated, there are \u223c10 \u00b0C differences in the melting temperatures for both the F \u2192 PK and PK \u2192 S1 transitions between the two reports, which could be due to the different cations (67\u221269). This produces a difference of 1.6 kcal/mol in \u0394G37,PSK\u2212HP0 between the measurements of the two groups.",

The FCA/DA and FCA experiments were conducted at 37 \u00b0C, while \u0394G370 values of the 437D PSK from UV melting and DSC were extrapolated from the melting temperatures, which were \u223c60 and \u223c80 \u00b0C for the first two transitions, respectively, at 0.5 M Na+ or K+. In the extrapolations to 37 \u00b0C, the enthalpy and entropy changes were considered temperature-independent; i.e., the heat capacity change (\u0394Cp0) was assumed to be zero. In general, however, the unfolding of RNA is accompanied by a non-zero \u0394Cp0, which can be as large as hundreds of calories per kelvin per mole per base pair or base triple (70). If \u0394Cp0 is approximated as a temperature-independent constant, thenThus, if \u0394Cp0 is taken into consideration, then the extrapolated thermodynamic parameters will vary. For example, a short self-complementary duplex (5\u2032CCGG)2 has a \u0394Cp0 of \u2212382 cal K\u22121 mol\u22121 for folding (58), and \u0394G370 is 1.0 kcal/mol less favorable when taking \u0394Cp0 into account than without it if \u0394G370 is extrapolated from 80 \u00b0C (71). Optical melting of the BWYV pseudoknot in different Na+ concentrations provides results at different temperatures (45). While the error limits on \u0394HT0 do not allow a reliable value for \u0394Cp0 to be determined, linear least-squares fittings of listed \u0394HT0 values versus Tm at 40, 74, 120, 204, and 504 mM Na+ for F \u2192 PK (Tm range of 48\u221267 \u00b0C), PK \u2192 S1 (Tm range of 63\u221284 \u00b0C), and S1 \u2192 U (Tm range of 81\u221292 \u00b0C) transitions provide \u0394Cp0 estimates of \u2212700, \u2212300, and \u221220 cal K\u22121 mol\u22121 for unfolding, respectively (Supporting Information). If these \u0394Cp0 values are included, then the average \u0394G370 calculated by eq 26 for the PSK\u2212HP transition from UV melting and DSC experiments in 0.5 M Na+ or K+ buffer will be less favorable by 1.4 kcal/mol relative to the average \u0394G370 without considering \u0394Cp0 values. However, for the S1 \u2192 U transition, the \u0394G370 difference with \u0394Cp0 considered is within 0.1 kcal/mol of that without considering \u0394Cp0.",

Here, the stem 1 hairpin is an important part of the reference structure.

Using the \u0394H0 and Tm obtained by fitting of the three thermal denaturation curves for this transition from UV melting and DSC experiments (44,45) produced values of \u22128.3, \u22127.8, and \u22128.4 kcal/mol giving an average of \u22128.2 kcal/mol at 37 \u00b0C, consistent with the estimate from the INN-HB model (Table 3). Both calculations ignore any \u0394Cp0 contributions, but both rely on measurements of hairpins with Tm values of >60 \u00b0C (44,45,72,73). Moreover, when the \u0394H0 values obtained at different salt concentrations and therefore Tm values (45) are plotted versus Tm, the apparent \u0394Cp0 is \u221220.4 cal K\u22121 mol\u22121, which is negligible. The NUPACK program used the INN-HB model and also predicted a \u0394G370 of \u22128.2 kcal/mol for the stem 1 hairpin by using the latest version of free energy parameters (39,60\u221262). The heuristic program, Kinefold (37), estimates the free energy of the stem 1 hairpin as \u22127.3 kcal/mol, which is 0.9 kcal/mol less favorable than the values from the current INN-HB model and experiments.",

For calculating the free energy of a pseudoknot (see the Supporting Information), both the SPM (42) and NUPACK (33) models consider that stem free energies are one of the main contributions, and they are estimated by the INN-HB model (39). Both models consider that the loops make unfavorable contributions to the free energy of the pseudoknot. The NUPACK model, however, counts a penalty for initiating the pseudoknot, then assigns penalty values to each base in the loop without considering loop sequence or position, and assigns penalty values to each base pair that borders the interior of the pseudoknot, without considering the base pair type, loop\u2212stem correlation, or tertiary interactions. Similar to Aalberts\u2019 model (26), but with volume exclusion considered, SPM calculates the entropies for the loops with a statistical mechanical polymer model that treats loops 1 and 3 differently and takes the entropies (\u0394Sloops0) as a penalty. Conformational states allowed by different lengths of stems and loops were considered. Also, the entropy for assembling the stem\u2212loop motifs (\u0394Sassemble0) is counted as a penalty. As with the NUPACK model, loop sequence and tertiary interactions are not included. The two models predict a similar free energy for 437D PSK (Table 3). The predictions are very close to the results from FCA/DA and FCA experiments. The models predict 437D PSK is not as stable at 37 \u00b0C as measured by UV melting and DSC, however. Kinefold predicts the pseudoknot is even less stable than these models and the FCA/DA and FCA results.",

For the sake of simplicity, both the SPM (42) and NUPACK (33) models use the INN-HB model (39) to calculate the free energy for the stems as a component of the free energy of a pseudoknot. Theimer et al. hypothesized that the systematic deviation of pseudoknot unfolding energetics from measurements and predictions by the INN-HB model should be attributed to tertiary interactions (47).

The FCA experiment, however, shows free energy changes of \u22120.6 and 0.4 kcal/mol, respectively, from this additional base pair. In the two cases, the additional base pair is less stabilizing by 2.7 and 2.8 kcal/mol, respectively, than expected. One uncertainty in this comparison is the prediction of \u0394G370 for the hairpin in the RS2 complex (see the Supporting Information). This prediction is not likely wrong by more than 1 kcal/mol, however. Similar to the hypothesis from Theimer et al. (47), a likely explanation for the difference between prediction and experiment is induced conformational changes. In an A-type RNA helix, a base pair twists the end of the duplex by 33.1\u00b0 (74). As calculated by the polymer model of Aalberts and Hodas (26), the distance between G7 and C9e/U9e (Figure 5) through the major groove of stem 2 in PSK-CG and PSK-UA is the same as the distance between G7 and C10 in BWYV PSK 2. Therefore, nucleotides in loop 1 have to twist to connect G7 and C9e or U9e in PSK-CG or PSK-UA, respectively. That could affect the tertiary interactions among C8, G12, A25, and C26 (Figure 1B,C), which stabilize the BWYV pseudoknot as much as \u22123.1 kcal/mol at 37 \u00b0C (75), and therefore destabilize the pseudoknot. From FCA measurements, the penalty for breaking this tertiary interaction is \u223c2.8 kcal/mol at 37 \u00b0C. Evidently, loop size and tertiary interactions play an important role in pseudoknot stability.",

The crystal structure shows U13 flipping out without forming a base pair with A25, while there is a complicated tertiary interaction among C8, G12, C26, A25, and C14 (Figure 1B,C). Therefore, the nearest neighbors will be affected because some hydrogen bonds and base stacking are lost in the structure. In predictions, U13 and A25 are paired and their nearest-neighbor free energy parameters for stacking with the G12-C26 base pair and for coaxial stacking with the G7-C14 base pair contribute to the predicted free energy. If these stacks are not included, then the pseudoknot will be predicted not to form, and only the stem 1 hairpin will be predicted to form. The predictions agree with the FCA/DA and FCA measurements, however. Apparently, the tertiary interactions compensate for the free energy loss from not forming a U13-A25 base pair. Alternatively, crystallization may trap one of two or more structures present in solution.",

The difference may reflect an unfavorable free energy for formation of loop 1 with all C\u2019s. Hairpin loops with oligo-C sequences are unusually unstable (60,76). Hairpin loops of C3 and C6 are \u223c1.5 and \u223c3.4 kcal/mol, respectively, less stable at 37 \u00b0C than other hairpin loops with the same number of nucleotides. Some of this destabilization may reflect the extra free energy required to unstack C\u2019s, e.g., \u223c0.3 kcal/mol more at 37 \u00b0C for poly-C than for poly-A (77). The FCA results suggest that there may also be an oligo-C effect for the free energy for pseudoknot loops. In PSK-4C-C9, loop 1 is formed by six C\u2019s and its free energy is \u223c1 kcal/mol less favorable than the free energy of PSK-4A or PSK-4C. This penalty is different from the penalty for a C6 hairpin loop but similar to the penalty for a C3 hairpin. Obviously, the C6 hairpin loop and C6 pseudoknot loop 1 have different conformations. A penalty of 1.0 kcal/mol is assigned to C6 pseudoknot loop 1. If this penalty is counted in SPM, then the SPM prediction will be closer to the FCA result. The results suggest that the SPM statistical model, which includes size exclusion effects, gives good agreement between predictions and experiments for loop 1.",

The nearest-neighbor model in the stems predicts \u0394G37,PSK-4A-U11A270 \u2212 \u0394G37,PSK-4A0 to be 1.4 kcal/mol, and the SPM predicts \u0394G37,PSK-4A-U11A270 \u2212 \u0394G37,PSK-U11A270 to be \u223c1.0 kcal/mol. The FCA experiments for mutation from PSK-4A and PSK-U11A27 to PSK-4A-U11A27 give \u0394\u0394G370 values of \u22121.1 and \u22121.2 kcal/mol, respectively. This is surprising because the mutations make the pseudoknot more stable rather than less stable as expected. The deviation could come from additional tertiary interactions between one or more A\u2019s in loop 1 and the UA pair in stem 2. For example, an A\u00b7A-U base triple with the non-Watson\u2212Crick A in the major groove is possible (78,79). Another new interaction perhaps facilitated by the increased flexibility of an A\u2212U compared to a G\u2212C pair is also possible. That suggests again that stem\u2212loop tertiary interactions can be a large factor for the free energy of a pseudoknot.",

            "text": "The sequence dependence of stabilities for modified BWYV pseudoknots provides insight into several factors important for predictions. (1) The INN-HB model can be used to estimate the free energy contribution from stem 2 if tertiary interactions are not involved. Because the crystal structure of the BWYV pseudoknot indicates that stem 2 has a propeller twist that deviates more from A-form than stem 1, this suggests that the INN-HB model will also work the same way for stem 1. (2) As reported previously (44,75), tertiary interactions between the stem and loop are a major contributor to pseudoknot free energy. For example, a possible newly formed A\u00b7A-U base triple in the stem 2\u2212loop 1 region in PSK-4A-U11A27 could stabilize the pseudoknot by \u22122.2 kcal/mol. In the BWYV pseudoknot, the structure in the joint part of the stem 1\u2212loop 3 region and stem 2\u2212loop 1 region is \u201cdistorted\u201d and an expected base pair with coaxial stacking in the secondary structure is therefore absent. The free energy loss for this distortion, however, can be compensated by the tertiary interactions (Figure 1C). Thus, in the absence of structural information and thermodynamic parameters for tertiary interactions, it is reasonable to include possible base pairs and coaxial stacking at the joint in predicting the free energy of a pseudoknot. These interactions are possible, so their absence implies that the tertiary interactions must be even more favorable. (3) The statistical polymer model (SPM) provides excellent approximations for the length dependence of loop 1. There will also be sequence dependence, however, which is not dependent on tertiary interactions. For example, oligo-C loops are unusually unstable.",

The \u0394Gnet of tertiaries0 term accounts for tertiary interactions between the stems and loops, and there is currently no good model for calculating it. Presumably, the three-dimensional structure of the pseudoknot is important for allowing nucleotides to interact, and certain base triples will be especially stable.
