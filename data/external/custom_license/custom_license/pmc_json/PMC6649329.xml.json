On the other hand, the SNVs in positions 2071 and 3333 were found in human-derived sequences but were not present in other mosquito genomes. The SNV in position 2071 was shared only with a sequence from French Polynesia, likely an example of parallel evolution, whereas the polymorphism in position 3333 was common with 2 sequences from Mexico and may correspond to a local variant. Finally, we found 8 SNVs that were also present in other human and mosquito sequences but were more common in mosquitoes. Only 1 SNV was found in the E gene, whereas the rest were found in nonstructural (NS) genes: 5 in NS2A, 4 in NS3, 2 in NS5, and 1 in NS1 (Table 2).",

The RNA of Zika virus was detected in 17 larvae pools; the rates of vertical transmission of Zika virus in the wild Ae. aegypti populations were estimated by calculating the MIR. In Morelos, the rainy season begins in late May and extends through the end of September, after which both the precipitation and the mosquito populations start to decrease. Thus, the higher MIR (6.95) calculated from the larvae hatched from the eggs collected in November 2016, in contrast to the MIR from the larvae hatched from the eggs collected in June (2.6), might be correlated with the increased number of human Zika virus cases that were reported in Jojutla during November, whereas during June no human cases were reported.

Previous studies performed with other flaviviruses, such as DENV, have reported MIRs as low as 0.18 (28) and 0.6 (29) or as high as 40 (30) in wild larvae, usually associated with the collection date and the place of sampling. Under laboratory conditions, the filial infectious rate of Zika virus in Ae. aegypti mosquitoes ranged from 4.9 to 24.6, depending on the strain of the virus tested (31), which corroborates that our results are comparable to the MIRs reported for other Zika viruses and other flaviviruses, including DENV (32,33).",

The larvae-specific SNVs were located in the coding regions for the NS2A and NS3 proteins, which are involved in the replication of the viral RNA (34).
