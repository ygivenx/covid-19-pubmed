            "text": "To the Editor: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been a global public health issue (1). We completed a study on the evolutionary path of the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) during the 2002\u20132003 epidemic (2). Most human SARS-CoV strains, as exemplified by the Tor2 sequence (GenBank accession no. AY274119) (3), are characterized by the deletion of a 29-nucleotide (nt) segment upstream of the nucleocapsid (N) gene domain when compared with the viral strains isolated from the earliest human SARS patients (2) or from nonhuman mammalian hosts (4). Towards the end of the epidemic, a variant of the SARS-CoV with a deletion of 386 nt flanking the 29-nt site was first demonstrated by complete genomic sequencing in 2 patients in Hong Kong (GenBank accession nos. AY394999, AY395000, AY395001, AY395002) (2). The 386-nt deleted segment corresponds to the genomic region spanning residues 27719 to 28104 of the Tor2 sequence (3). The deletion results in the disruption of a putative open reading frames, orf 9, while eliminating orfs 10 and 11. This deletion variant was first isolated from 2 SARS patients with disease onset in mid-May 2003. Patient A was a 41-year-old female phlebotomist working in North District Hospital, New Territories East Cluster, Hong Kong. Patient B was a 98-year-old female admitted to ward X of North District Hospital (2).",

Twenty-one SARS patients with disease onset dates from mid-April were identified. All cases had been confirmed by positive reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection of SARS-CoV RNA in clinical specimens or seroconversion. These patients had been admitted with SARS to 4 different hospitals in Hong Kong, including North District Hospital and hospitals A and B, which were located in the same geographic cluster as North District Hospital, as well as hospital C, which was geographically distant from the other 3 hospitals. Clinical specimens were retrieved, and RT-PCR was performed to specifically amplify a genomic segment of SARS-CoV encompassing the deletion site. Specimens with shortened PCR fragments were sequenced to determine the location and precise extent of the deletion.",

Patients A, B, and the 13 patients appeared to be epidemiologically related. The epidemiologic relationships and clinical details of the 15 cases are illustrated in the Figure. Most of the cases were part of a documented outbreak at North District Hospital traceable to an 85-year-old woman, L, in whom SARS was not initially suspected but was subsequently confirmed by seroconversion. Patient L had been admitted to ward Y of North District Hospital; subsequently SARS developed in 7 fellow inpatients (patients 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, D, and E) and 2 healthcare workers (patients 7 and A) (Figure). Patient A had been working in both wards X and Y, and patient D was transferred from ward Y to X before symptom onset. Soon afterwards, SARS developed in 2 other inpatients (patients B and 11) in ward X (Figure). Patient E was transferred from ward Y to Z, where symptoms later developed in another inpatient (patient 2) (Figure).",

Nine (60%) of the 15 patients, 8 of whom were known chronic disease patients, died (Figure). This mortality rate is consistent with previous observations where the death rate in patients >65 years generally exceeded 50% (1). Despite the disruption of several putative orfs, as evident from this study, this SARS-CoV variant remained effective in propagating among persons, particularly in the healthcare setting. The predicted orfs 9, 10, and 11 of the SARS-CoV thus may not be functionally important, although further studies are required. We were able to document 3 generations of transmission and traced the first appearance of this deletion variant to mid-April 2003, possibly at Estate T. Investigation on the origin of this enigmatic variant should be continued by studying its prevalence among the earlier human SARS-CoV isolates and potential mammalian hosts.",
