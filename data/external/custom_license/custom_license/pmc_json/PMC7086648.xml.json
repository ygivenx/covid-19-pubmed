In Austria, no evidence of herd protection was found with vaccine coverage of 57 % in 2007 (RotaTeq) [2]. The reason for herd protection is probably interruption of RV transmission among all children. Exposure of unvaccinated children to vaccine virus shed in the stools of vaccinated infants is possible but unlikely to explain herd protection. Such transmission of vaccine-acquired virus resulting to a symptomatic RVGE has been reported in several countries [24]. In our study, we detected shedding of vaccine virus in a number of children, but all were recently vaccinated and none was unvaccinated.",

In that sense, the present findings on the impact of universal RV vaccination on NVGE are (only) confirmatory, and we conclude that the RotaTeq vaccination program does not reduce NVGE. The slight decrease observed in the study vs. reference years may well be explained by natural annual variation. In a decade, there has been considerable year to year variation of NVGE, although the winter epidemic has occurred every year [26].",
