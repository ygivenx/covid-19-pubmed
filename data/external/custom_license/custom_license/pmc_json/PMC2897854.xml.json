The importance of infection control in dentistry cannot be underestimated.20 There have been reports of potential cross-contamination with MRSA in dental clinics.21 It is essential to revise infection control measures in dental practices to accommodate these concerns.22 Because of the impossibility of identifying possible carriers of important pathogens such as HIV and HBV, among others, it is recommended that every patient, indiscriminately be considered as being potentially contaminated and that standardized protective measures be used before performing an invasive procedure.18",
