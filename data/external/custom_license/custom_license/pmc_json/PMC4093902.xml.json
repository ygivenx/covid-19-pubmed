Group means are shown as open circles, and distances from uninfected, untreated controls for treated and untreated MERS-CoV-infected macaques are shown as arrows between group means. The distance between points and groups is indicative of the differences in gene expression between the different groups. (b) Heatmap showing log10 expression ratios to untreated MERS-CoV-infected group mean of 205 DEG associated with interferon-\u03b12b and ribavirin treatment, as determined by Welch's t-test (p<0.01, fold change \u2265 1.5), and grouped by hierarchical clustering. (c) Molecular interaction network built using DEG shown in panel b. Solid lines show direct molecular interactions, dashed lines show indirect molecular interactions. Red molecules are those upregulated in treated animals relative to untreated, while green molecules are downregulated.",
