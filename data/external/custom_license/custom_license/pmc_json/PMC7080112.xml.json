Each cell line shows its specificities, and its use for vaccine production has advantages but also disadvantages compared to the other cell lines. Based on a thorough understanding of the pros and cons of individual host cells for process performance, properties of other cell lines, specific aspects of virus\u2013host cell interaction and process options can be better evaluated. Overall, a thorough comparison of cell lines might help to develop process optimization strategies, as well as to assess quality differences concerning the virus strains and antigens produced.",

            "text": "Over the last decade, the use of adherent cells for influenza virus manufacturing has attracted much attention (Kistner et al. 1998; Barrett et al. 2009; Tree et al. 2001). In particular, growth and influenza virus replication in adherently growing MDCK and Vero cells has been investigated (Rimmelzwaan et al. 1998; Merten et al. 1999a, b; Nicolson et al. 2005). However, a direct comparison of experimental data for these two cell lines, i.e., an identification of the cell line resulting in optimum process performance, is not straight forward. On one side, cell and virus propagation were investigated in different cultivation systems (static systems, roller bottles, spinner, stirred tank). On the other side, not only different media (serum-containing (SC) as well as serum-free (SF)) but also different microcarriers (Cytodex 1 and 3) were used for large-scale cultures (Merten et al. 1996; Quesney et al. 2001; Kistner et al. 2007; Mendonca and Pereira 1998, 1995). Additional variations resulted from the use of MDCK as well as Vero cell lines from different sources and the use of different influenza virus strains (Genzel and Reichl 2009). And, even when similar cultivation conditions are chosen, differences in productivity as well as product quality are to be expected, as for example, Vero cells are known to be deficient in \u03b2-interferon response due to the absence of the \u03b2-interferon gene (Mosca 1986; Desmyter et al. 1968). Typically, cell lines from two different hosts will also show variations in the glycosylation machinery, metabolism, enzyme activities, and proteome levels (Ritter et al. 2008; Schwarzer et al. 2009).",

Decreased virus titers (pfu/ml) and slower virus production were described when trypsin was not added to the virus maintenance medium in roller bottles (Tree et al. 2001). Typically, trypsin has to be added several times during influenza production in Vero cells as these cells release a trypsin inhibitor (Kaverin and Webster 1995; Romanova et al. 2003). For MDCK cells, the release of a trypsin inhibitor has also been described recently (Nishiyama et al. 2008). However, influenza virus replication has not been found to be as sensitive to trypsin concentration as in Vero cells, and trypsin is usually added at time of infection only (Tree et al. 2001; Genzel et al. 2004, 2006a, b; Schwartz et al. 2006). Finally, virus adaptation to the producer cell line has often been described for the adaptation from eggs to cells (Lin et al. 1997; Genzel and Reichl 2007; Govorkova et al. 1996). Up to 20 passages were needed to obtain acceptable HA virus titers. However, more typically only three to four passages are needed.",

Previous findings comparing N-glycan fingerprints from different viruses grown in various cell lines showed specific HA N-glycan fingerprints for each virus\u2013host cell line combination (Schwarzer et al. 2008, 2009). This is in agreement with the differences in HA fingerprints from MDCK and Vero cell-derived A/PR/8/34 H1N1 virus observed in this study. Changes in glycosylation between influenza B viruses grown in eggs or MDCK cells were described in detail by Chen et al. using Western blotting and sequence analysis of the HA1 protein (Chen et al. 2008). For influenza A H3N2 the glycosylation patterns resulting from production in Vero or MDCK cells were compared by Romanova et al. by treatment with glycosidases and Western blotting (Romanova et al. 2003). It was shown that H3N2\u2014but not H1N1\u2014viruses adapted to Vero cells could no longer infect chicken eggs or agglutinate chicken erythrocytes. However, in our study, no problem with HA determination was noticed for samples from the VCS cultivation using A/Wisconsin/67/2005 HGR H3N2. The authors concluded that changes in HA N-glycosylation are most likely linked to changes in the amino acid sequence. Changes of single amino acids were also found for the adaptation of coronaviruses to Vero cells at different temperatures (Shen et al. 2004). Overall, it seems that the interrelation between HA N-glycosylation pattern, RNA, and amino acid sequence has not yet been clearly understood and further studies in this respect should be performed. Based on our findings we assume that the changes in HA N-glycan fingerprints are mainly dependent on the host cell line.",

MDCK cells, but in particular Vero cells, release protease inhibitors into the cell culture medium affecting the activity of trypsin needed for virus infection (Kaverin and Webster 1995; Nishiyama et al. 2008). Washing and medium exchange steps before infection could clearly reduce the activity of trypsin inhibitors, potentially counteracting successful virus replication. However, for a vaccine production process, these steps mean additional medium costs and increased contamination risks. On the other hand, too high trypsin activities in the virus production medium could result in cell detachment. Therefore, as was seen in this study, optimizing trypsin activity is essential. In particular, batch to batch variations of trypsin, media, and differences in shear stress of cultivation systems need to be considered. Increase in trypsin activity resulted in an earlier increase in HA titer in SF medium, while too low concentrations prevented successful virus replication. In SC medium, however, all trypsin concentrations tested resulted in similar HA profiles. Multiple additions of trypsin as described by Govorkova et al. (1995, 1996), did not result in improvement of HA titers. As this method would complicate large-scale production processes, a single addition of trypsin at time of infection should be preferred.",

However, virus strains clearly differed in stability of TCID50. Especially MDCK cell-derived A/PR/8/34 H1N1ma (NIBSC) in \u0394SC medium showed low stability. No infectious virions were detected 184 h pi, which was also seen for equine influenza in MDCK cells at 150 h pi (Genzel et al. 2006a, b). All other virus strains tested in this study showed better stabilities. In SF medium with lower moi A/Wisconsin/67/2005va HGR produced in Vero cells was most stable (Table 2, t\n1/2 = 112 h). For different influenza B viruses in SFM at 33 \u00b0C (moi: 0.01), Wressnigg et al. showed TCID50 data up to 96 h pi (Wressnigg et al. 2009). Here, all virus strains had a stable titer for the time frame shown, once the maximum titer of about 107\u2013108 virions/ml was reached. For influenza A/Neth/18/94 produced in MDCK cells Rimmelzwaan et al. also showed a decrease of TCID50 and a stable HA titer over a time period of 144 h (Rimmelzwaan et al. 1998). In contrast, Schwartz et al. described for the production of A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) no decrease in TCID50 until 144 h pi (Schwartz et al. 2006). It thus seems that adaptation of the virus seed to the host cell line as well as the virus strain has an influence on virus stability and has to be characterized to determine the optimum harvest time especially for seed virus preparation or manufacturing of live-attenuated vaccines.",

The spreading of Vero cells onto Cytodex 1 microcarriers (2 g/L) was observed in detail by Mendon\u00e7a et al. (1999). For inoculation they found an optimum cells-to-microcarrier ratio of eight cells per microcarrier leading to 1.6 \u00d7 106 cells/ml after 7 days of cell growth in spinner flasks in SC medium. Cultivations in a 3.7 L stirred tank bioreactor resulted in 0.8 \u00d7 106 cells/ml after 9 days in batch, and 2.1 \u00d7 106 cells/ml after 12 days in perfusion mode (Mendonca and Pereira 1998). Cultivation of Vero cells on Cytodex 1 at 3 g/L was shown by Quesney et al. (2003). From a 4 \u00d7 105 cells/ml starting concentration, 1.8 \u00d7 106 cells/ml were obtained after 5 days. A study in spinner flasks showed that the optimal pH for attachment of Vero cells onto Cytodex 1 microcarriers was pH 7.1, and the use of serum-supported cell growth but not cell attachment (Ng et al. 1996). Furthermore, continuous stirring at 40 rpm during the attachment phase was favored compared to intermittent stirring. For production of Japanese encephalitis virus in Vero cells using 3 g/L Cytodex 1 in a spinner flask resulted in a maximum cell concentration of 1.8 \u00d7 106 cells/ml after 6 days in SF medium (Toriniwa and Komiya 2007). The production of rabies virus with Vero cells was shown in VPSFM medium using Cytodex 1 microcarriers (3 g/L) in a 2 L stirred tank bioreactor by Rourou et al. (2007). Here, a maximum cell concentration of 2.6 \u00d7 106 cells/ml was reached after 3 days. Finally, Merten et al. compared MDCK and Vero cell growth for influenza infection in the SF medium MDSS2N (Merten et al. 1999a, b). For Vero cells a maximum concentration of 3.1 \u00d7 106 cells/ml was obtained after 5 days (Cytodex 1 microcarriers, 2.5 g/L).",

At small-scale, Vero cells produced similar or even higher virus titers than MDCK cells. But also conditions for lower titers were possible. Especially, medium and virus strain had a strong influence on the possible titers. For the production of A/Wisconsin/67/2005 HGR in SF medium, Vero cells showed higher virus titers than MDCK cells (HA as well as TCID50) (Table 2). On the other hand, for the cultivation in 5 L stirred tank bioreactor in SC medium, Vero cells produced lower virus titers than MDCK cells. Nevertheless, titers above 2.6 log10 HA units/100 \u03bcL are very reasonable. For the production of two different H5N1 influenza viruses in 30 or 100 L scale bioreactors, Kistner et al. used the Vero ATCC CCL81 cell line and virus adapted over four passages (Kistner et al. 2007). With a moi of 0.001 and infection at 32 \u00b0C, HA titers of 2.7\u20133.0 log10 HA units/100 \u03bcL were obtained. Earlier, Kistner et al. showed for different virus strains a comparison between Vero-derived and egg-derived virus production. HA titers of 2.1\u20132.4 log10 HA units/100 \u03bcL were typically obtained for Vero cells and all cultivations shown from a 1,200 L bioreactor reached HA titers of 2.4 log10 HA units/100 \u03bcL (Kistner et al. 1998).",

A clear difference was noticed for glutamate. Vero cells released glutamate constantly, whereas MDCK cells took up glutamate completely towards the end of the cell growth phase. Mendonca et al. described the metabolism of Vero cells in Leibovitz medium supplemented with 5% FCS and 2 mM glutamine in a stirred tank bioreactor cultivation (Mendonca and Pereira 1998). Cell concentrations of 0.8 \u00d7 106 cells/ml were reached in batch mode after 8 days of cultivation. They observed an uptake of lactate when galactose was used as a carbon source. Glutamine uptake and ammonia release was similar but changes in glutamate concentrations were not reported. The effect of ammonia and glutamine/glutamate on growth of Vero cells in DMEM medium was analyzed in detail by Huang et al. (2006). During growth in medium without glutamine but containing glutamate and ammonia, ammonia was slightly taken up. No ammonia release was seen during growth in medium containing only glutamate or glutamate and asparagine. Only for growth in glutamine medium, ammonia release was found, which was similar to the release observed in this study. For the glutamate-containing media Huang et al. also described an uptake of glutamate similar to what was found for MDCK cells in SC medium in this study. This medium, however, did not contain glutamine. It seems that Vero cells use glutamate to produce glutamine via the enzyme glutamine synthetase. However, if glutamine is added to the medium, glutamine is taken up preferably while glutamine synthetase activity is reduced. In this case, even a release of glutamate is possible. Work is in progress to use specific enzyme actvity assays (Janke et al. 2010) to characterize cultivations in different media, ie., media which do not contain glutamine. Details on metabolism of VPSFM/William\u2019s E medium in a stirred tank bioreactor performed under similar conditions as described in this study were also given by Quesney et al. (Quesney et al. 2003). Compared to our results, glutamine uptake was clearly higher in VPSFM/William\u2019s E medium leading to a complete uptake after 4 days. Furthermore, also a release of glutamate was observed, which was explained by the authors as a transformation of glutamine to glutamate. Vero cells were also cultivated in VPSFM medium (4 mM gln) by Rourou et al. for rabies virus propagation (Rourou et al. 2007). Although lower glucose starting concentrations were used, higher lactate levels were reached compared to both lab-scale cultivations in this study. In contrast to glucose, higher glutamine starting concentrations were used by Rourou et al., but lower ammonia release was observed. No glutamate data was given.",

Therefore, having alternative host cells seems to be essential for worldwide vaccine production, especially in case of a pandemic.",
