This spread and the absence of an effective vaccine are to a large degree a consequence of the ability of HIV-1 to evade antibody-mediated neutralization3,4,5. On HIV-1, the only viral target available for neutralizing antibodies is the envelope spike, which is composed of three copies of the gp120 exterior envelope glycoprotein and three gp41 transmembrane glycoprotein molecules6,7. Genetic, immunological and structural studies of the HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins have revealed extraordinary diversity, manifest in a variety of immunodominant loops, as well as multiple overlapping mechanisms of humoral evasion, including self-masquerading glycan and conformational masking8,9,10,11. These evolutionarily honed barriers of diversity and evasion have confounded traditional vaccine development.",

We constructed stabilized gp120 molecules, constrained to stay in the CD4-bound conformation even in the absence of CD4, and tested the effect of this stabilization on the binding kinetics of CD4 and on antibodies reactive with sites of receptor binding. We then determined the crystal structure of the broadly neutralizing antibody b12 in complex with one of the stabilized gp120 molecules. Analysis of this structure, combined with detailed antigenic analyses of gp120 molecules stabilized to various extents in the CD4-bound conformation, not only reveals the functionally conserved surface that allows for initial CD4 attachment, but also provides an atomic-level description of the b12 epitope, which serves as a key target for humoral neutralization of HIV-1.",

To circumvent this complication, we used an iterative structure-based scheme to stabilize gp120 in its CD4-bound state (Table 1, Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). The CD4-bound state of gp120 comprises an inner domain, outer domain and four-stranded bridging sheet mini-domain18. Five disulphides and four cavity-altering substitutions were created to restrict interdomain movements and to stabilize bridging sheet formation. Crystallographic analysis of gp120 variants with these substitutions in complex with CD4 and antibody 17b at 2.0\u20132.2 \u00c5 resolution showed that four of five disulphides formed and that disulphide and cavity-altering substitutions induced minimal structural perturbation. We also analysed a two-disulphide variant at 2.5 \u00c5 resolution as well as a three-disulphide variant at 2.8 \u00c5 resolution (Table 1). In both structures, all potential disulphides formed.",

Similarly invariant on-rates have recently been reported for CD4 binding to gp120 molecules restrained from achieving a CD4-bound conformation by removing a flexible loop22. Thus, in contrast to the CD4-induced antibodies, a conformational change is not required to expose an initial site of contact for CD4.

Initial contact by CD4 occurs with the structurally invariant outer domain, to a surface constitutively exposed on the envelope spike. In primary isolates, which are generally resistant to neutralization by soluble CD4, this interaction is not stable and CD4 readily \u2018falls off\u2019. However, at the cell surface (or with dodecameric CD4), multiple CD4 molecules can bind simultaneously to the viral spike and use avidity to enhance stability. The avidity-enhanced outer domain\u2013CD4 complex provides a receptive contact surface for the bridging sheet. A highly coordinated rearrangement of the inner domain allows for formation of the bridging sheet, which welds CD4 into place.",

Recent serological analysis of long-term non-progressors attributes the broad and potent neutralizing properties of some of these sera to antibodies directed against this site36. The potential of receptor-binding-site antibodies to effect broad neutralization has been recognized since the first viral structures revealed conserved sites of receptor binding37,38.

A high-throughput expression system, coupling transient expression with swainsonine, endoglycosidase H and concanavalin A, was devised from related procedures39 to produce gp120 suitable for crystallization. Briefly, codon-optimized variants were constructed in the context of core gp120 (HXBc2) and expressed transiently in 293 cells under control of the CMV/R promoter40. Swainsonine (20 mg l-1; Biomol) was added to the cell-culture medium 2 h before DNA transfection, and supernatants were collected after 48 and 96 h. Secreted gp120 molecules were purified by 17b-affinity chromatography and deglycosylated with endoglycosidase H (Endo Hf; New England Biolab) at pH 5.9, 37 \u00b0C, with gp120 containing residual uncleaved glycan moieties removed by passage over concanavalin A Sepharose (Sigma-Aldrich). Ternary complexes of deglycosylated core gp120, d1d2 of CD4 and 17b Fab were prepared as described previously41, with P2221 crystals grown (Supplementary Table 1) around conditions identified for the Drosophila-produced wild-type core18. Because crystals were small (rods, typical diameter 40 \u03bcm) and subject to high radiation dosages during data collection, difference Fourier maps comparing the initial and final swatches of data were inspected to identify radiation-induced disulphide breakage42, and the refined models (Supplementary Table 1) adjusted to reflect the initial, radiation-damage-free structure.",
