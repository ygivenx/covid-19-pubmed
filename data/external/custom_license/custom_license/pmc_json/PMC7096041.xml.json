We spent our energy there to develop antibodies to get it ready, but the disease went away\u2014thank heavens, we were totally pleased! However, now we've got an antibody if it ever returns.",

I wanted to actually take ideas to a product and see it work in patients. We've done that here, and it's a thrill. Moreover, I wanted to do that for unmet medical needs, and that's the unique part here. We're able to choose targets that are important to public health, both here in the United States and in the developing world that might not have enough market to interest big pharma or biotech to actually develop those products. And that's what's unique about having the public nonprofit entity doing this.",

But it is what a medical school can do\u2014and they've got great scientists we now collaborate with and an infrastructure that allowed us to take what was a very successful model and move it forward to the new era. It's allowed us to build these new facilities, make discoveries, have an intellectual property system where we patent our discoveries, and then collaborate with both public entities and pharma. That structure allowed the operation to grow from around 100 employees then to 300 or so now. It also gives the medical school students opportunities to train here at the lab and participate in the development of our clinical trials.",

The most impact we'll have, I believe, is for this monoclonal antibody against the rabies virus to be available to the world\u2014and that wouldn't be available if it hadn't been for us. We're just about to submit the trial to the regulatory agencies in India, and we're hopeful that, because there are hundreds of patients that can be enrolled once it starts, it shouldn't take many months to complete. Our expectation is that we'll have licensure in 2012. And if it's licensed and sold, then it can also become available to other countries.",
