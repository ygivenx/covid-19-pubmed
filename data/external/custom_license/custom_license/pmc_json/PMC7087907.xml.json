Concerns over the safety of whole-cell pertussis vaccines have prompted the development of acellular vaccines that are less likely to provoke adverse reactions as they contain purified antigenic components of the causal bacterium Bordetella pertussis. However, current acellular pertussis vaccines must be administered in a series of multiple doses, thereby contributing to their high production costs (CDC 1992; Salmaso et al. 2001; Tan et al. 2005). Attempts to produce safer, inexpensive, and more efficient DPT vaccines are underway (Abomoelak et al. 1999; Aminian et al. 2007; Kamachi et al. 2003; Meriste et al. 2006).",

            "text": "In the last few years, plants have been genetically engineered to express various recombinant biopharmaceuticals (Ma et al. 2005). Plants can be used as bioreactors for the production of appropriately safe and inexpensive vaccines, and contribute to reduced costs associated with vaccine transportation and storage (Giddings et al. 2000; Koya et al. 2005; La et al. 2007). Plant-based vaccine production has been reported in several plant species, including potato (Mason et al. 1996), tobacco (Liu et al. 2005; Mason et al. 1992; Zhang et al. 2006), tomato (McGarvey et al. 1995; Sandhu et al. 2000), lettuce (Kapusta et al. 1999), carrot (Marquet-Blouin et al. 2003; Rosales-Mendoza et al. 2007), and alfalfa (Dong et al. 2005), among others. Feeding studies conducted in animals (Huang et al. 2001; Rosales-Mendoza et al. 2008; Thanavala et al. 1995) and humans (Tacket et al. 1998, 2000) have demonstrated that candidate vaccines produced in plants are effective in eliciting protective immune responses. This vaccine production approach will also have a positive impact on public health measures in developing countries that lack of proper refrigeration systems for storage of traditional vaccines. As plant-based vaccines are administered orally, these vaccines avoid the use of injections, thus eliminating discomfort and more importantly the risk of disease transmission via re-use of contaminated syringes and needles (La et al. 2007; Richter et al. 2000).",

            "text": "Plastid transformation provides an alternative strategy for expressing foreign genes in plants and offers several advantages over nuclear plant expression systems (Chargelegue et al. 2001; Sala et al. 2003). These advantages include higher levels of foreign protein accumulation, site-specific integration of transgenes, and transgene containment due to maternal transmission of plastids thus alleviating environmental concerns over gene flow (Maliga 2003; Daniell et al. 2005). Moreover, the destination of a protein influences both its stability and modification (Drakakaki et al. 2006). To date, many antigenic proteins have been expressed in chloroplasts, such as the cholera toxin B subunit (Daniell et al. 2001), anthrax protective antigen (Koya et al. 2005), tetanus toxin fragment C (Tregoning et al. 2003), Escherichia coli K99 fimbrial subunit antigen (Garg et al. 2007), and the spike (S) protein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Li et al. 2006). Recently in our laboratory, a fusion protein of the heat labile toxin B subunit (LTB) of the enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli along with the heat stable toxin (ST) fusion protein (LTB-ST) has been expressed in transplastomic tobacco plants, and demonstrated its immunogenic characteristic in tested mice (Rosales-Mendoza et al. 2009).",

Following analysis of transgenic tomato plants, it has been demonstrated that the DPT transgene is integrated into the genome, transcribed, properly translated, and accumulating at levels of 0.006% of total soluble protein (TSP) (Soria-Guerra et al. 2007). In addition, we have demonstrated that three doses of 270 mg each of freeze-dried tomato triggers specific immune responses in mice (Soria-Guerra et al., unpublished). These studies suggest that the DPT could be used as a viable multicomponent DPT subunit vaccine. However, low levels of expression of the DPT protein in tomato plants render this plant-based candidate vaccine less desirable for commercial use as an oral vaccine. In this study, we report on the transfer and expression of the DPT fusion gene, re-designed for expression in tobacco chloroplasts. Recovery of transplastomic T1 tobacco plants accumulating high levels of the recombinant DPT fusion protein is reported. The antigenicity of all three components of the DPT fusion protein is also confirmed in these transplastomic tobacco plants by ELISA assays. Following oral feeding of freeze-dried transplastomic tobacco leaves in test mice, immunogenic responses are observed.",

This vector is designed for integration of foreign genes into an MunI restriction site between trnN-GUU and trnR-ACG in the inverted repeat region of the chloroplast genome (Zou et al. 2003). Several modifications have been made to the pKCZ vector in order to express the DPT and aadA genes as bicistrons under the control of the plastid 16S rRNA promoter (Prrn). First, a synthetic plastid 16S-rRN-promoter (Prrn) fused to the 5\u2032-UTR of gene 10 from the bacteriophage T7 (T7G10) was prepared using synthetic oligonucleotides. The 5\u2032-UTR region of this promoter was ligated to the pKCZ vector at restriction sites NheI and BglII of the pKCZ-UTR. Then, the vector pKCZ-UTR was digested with SpeI and NheI in order to delete the aadA expression cassette, and self-ligated to generate pKCZ-UTRdel. An aadA expression cassette was released from the pKCZ vector by SmaI\u2013EcoRV digestion, and cloned downstream of the Prrn-UTR at AfeI and PmlI sites of pKCZ-UTRdel to generate the pBic vector. The DPT coding sequence was subcloned into the pBic vector digested with XbaI and XhoI restriction enzymes. The resulting plasmid was named pBic-DPT (Fig. 1a). A positive clone was selected following restriction analysis and sequenced. All cloning and analysis procedures were performed following standard protocols (Sambrook et al. 1989). DNA for plastid transformation was prepared using the Qiagen Plasmid Midi Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).\n",

In this study, the DPT transgene was expressed under the control of the Prrn promoter and the 5\u2032-UTR T7G10, reported to mediate high expression in plastids (Kuroda and Maliga 2001a). The relatively low DPT content obtained in transplastomic tobacco plants in this study might be attributed to several factors. Among these, it is likely that the sequence immediately downstream of the start codon, which has been associated with translation efficiency, might contribute to low levels of expression (Kuroda and Maliga 2001b). Several reports indicated that the amount of recombinant proteins expressed in chloroplasts was lower than 1% of TSP (Maliga 2004). For example, Lee et al. (2006) reported levels of 0.002\u20130.004% of TSP of the viral capsid protein antigen against Epstein\u2013Barr virus expressed in tobacco plastids. They suggested that this low level of protein accumulation was likely due to post-transcriptional events and protein stability. Herz et al. (2005) reported that expression levels in plastids were very much dependent on the vector, promoter, and translational control element(s), among others. Therefore, these various factors might have contributed to the low levels of expression observed in this study.",
