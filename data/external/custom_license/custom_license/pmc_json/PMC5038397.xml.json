Specimen volumes were 100 \u03bcL EDTA whole blood and 200 \u03bcL serum, and elution volumes were 100 \u03bcL for EDTA whole blood and 50 \u03bcL for serum. One-step, real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) was performed for the 3 MERS-CoV gene regions (upstream envelope [upE], open reading frame [ORF] 1a, and nucleocapsid) with an AgPath-ID One-step RT-PCR kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and an ABI7500 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Human ribonuclease (RNase) P was amplified in parallel for sample quality control (5,12,13). In each test, the viral RNA was considered detected when amplification before cutoff was observed from at least 2 different targets in MERS-CoV with pass of sample quality control. The robustness of rRT-PCR was demonstrated for qualitative concordance of positivity or negativity by using different types of specimens (Technical Appendix Table 1). We calculated the viral copy concentration in the blood using standard curves constructed from the cycle threshold (Ct) of serially diluted 105 copies/\u03bcL of upE RNA (provided by the University of Bonn Medical Center, Bonn, Germany).",

Therefore, in the case of MERS-CoV infection, blood does not have the highest diagnostic yield for the initial confirmatory diagnosis. The viral load in blood was low, even in detected cases. A proportion of MERS-CoV isolates in the 2015 Korea outbreak harbored a C\u2192T substitution in the third nucleotide of the ORF1a primer binding site (GenBank accession nos. KT374052\u2013374055). This mismatch may partially contribute to the insensitivity of ORF1a assay observed in this study. An alternative sensitive target replacing ORF1a might be useful in studies using blood specimens.",
