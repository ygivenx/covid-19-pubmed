Legal and regulatory action shifted focus to regulation of health care in Greece as it did elsewhere in the western world. Regulations appeared sporadically, notably in response to tuberculosis and sexually transmitted diseases. Only in 2003, in anticipation of the 2004 Athens Olympic Games, did the government seriously attempt to regain capacity to control infectious diseases effectively. This reform effort did not include a well-conceptualized revision of preexisting statutes and public health officers pointed to shortcomings, lack of clarity about jurisdictional boundaries, lines of command, and procedural requirements.11",

New concepts emerged, including education of the public on infection prevention (1915), obligation for officials to conform to regulatory norms (1940), and to consider communicability criteria (1955). Mandatory treatment and confinement as the first line of containment reappeared in laws on sexually transmitted diseases (1939, 1960) and leprosy (1969), but eventually the government revoked these (1981). HIV/AIDS specific statutes strengthened preexisting confidentiality provisions (1986). Broader personal data protection law (1997) included strict exceptions for communicable disease surveillance and public health threats. Patients\u2019 rights laws fortified protection of human rights (1998) as incorporated in public health law (2003, 2005). Current laws are restrictive only in instances involving significant health risks and when supported by scientific evidence; and only when restrictions are appropriate to and commensurate with the nature and magnitude of the risk. That is, authorities must apply the least restrictive effective measures. When restrictions expire, they may be renewed only if supported by scientific review. Procedural provisions protect against arbitrary or unjustified deprivation of liberties.",

Currently, central authority and responsibility for compliance with WHO and European Union (EU) policies lie with the Ministry of Health (2000).

Consistent with IHR (2005), Greek reform reintroduced the communitarian foundations of control strategies, mandating restrictions of individual liberties when necessary for protecting public health. Disease control is consistently treated as public health protection and crafted to avoid undue impact on individuals. Thus Greek law aligns with public health provisions in the revised IHR, and in laws of France, Sweden, and other countries.24,\n25,\n26 Disease control is not treated as a national security issue that would be reminiscent of the older policing approach.27 Thus, Greek law embodies current understanding of effective public health practice with emphasis on public education and transparent procedures, not on punitive, coercive or stigmatizing ones that may drive epidemics \u2018underground\u2019.28,\n29",

However, Greek implementation has lagged; the pressing economic situation raises questions about whether the country will fully meet its obligations by the IHR (2005) deadline in 2012. Major legislative weaknesses stem from failing to follow up core infectious disease control law with supplementary legal and administrational regulations needed to guide implementation. Inconsistent and uncoordinated law making contributed to incomplete establishment of structures and procedures. Governmental change or emergence of new diseases exposed legal and administrative inadequacies, whereas consecutive reforms remade structures, policies, and procedures. Reforms have not thoughtfully integrated preexisting legislation, nor have obsolete or conflicting provisions regularly been removed. Thus, the existing body of pertinent law consists of fragmented requirements from numerous legal texts and different eras; these vary in content, applicability, and, possibly, legal validity.",
