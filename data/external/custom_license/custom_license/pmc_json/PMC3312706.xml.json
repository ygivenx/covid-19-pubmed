            "text": "India is presently facing a triple burden of diseases: communicable diseases, non-communicable diseases and the emergence of new infections. During the last three decades, more than 30 new organisms have been identified worldwide including HIV, Vibrio cholera 0139, Nipah virus, SARS coronavirus and highly pathogenic avian influenza virus A. With the rapid health transition in the country, large and rising burdens of chronic diseases are estimated to account for 53% of all deaths. Non-communicable diseases, especially Diabetes Mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, stroke and chronic lung diseases, have emerged as a major public health problem. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that Indians \u2013 who make up 17% of the world's population \u2013 suffer 28% of the world's total years lost to respiratory infections, 25% of the years lost to tuberculosis, 24% of the years lost to diarrhea diseases, 21% of the years lost to measles, and 45% of the years lost to leprosy. In addition, 2.5 million people in India are living with HIV/AIDS. To tackle the menace of communicable and non-communicable diseases, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare continues to implement National Health Programs throughout the country for vector borne diseases, filaria, leprosy, tuberculosis, blindness, iodine deficiency disorder, mental health, AIDS, cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and stroke, etc. Central institutions and organizations engaged in health care, medical education and research are continuously being strengthened to tackle the emerging diseases. The strategies put in place in respect of communicable diseases, particularly leprosy and TB, have met with sufficient success. In the case of Vector Borne Diseases program, concerted efforts are being made, while under AIDS, the key strategy has been to build infrastructure and go in for targeted interventions.[12]",

For generating research output on disease and organs, research strategies were developed which primarily used disease name in title, abstract and keywords. For few diseases, like diabetes, malaria, tuberculosis, AIDS and enteric fever, search strategies were developed which used a set of keywords. For calculating the total international collaborative papers in medicine, a separate search strategy, which combines India's collaboration with 140 major countries, was prepared and this string was combined with the main string to generate India's total international collaborative output. For analyzing institutional, authors\u2019 and journals\u2019 output, separate institutional, author and journal output strategies strings were evolved and these strings were later combined with the main string.",

There is a need to create a research culture and climate that foster health research. In addition, capacity development for human resource development and infrastructure should be taken as a priority. There is also a need to improve the existing medical education system, which should foster research culture. A clear research career structure and productivity related incentives are required for people involved in research. The efforts of the government should be to make available the tools of modern information technology and biotechnology to health professionals and researchers, which are at present not accessible to majority of researchers. High-quality research in India is grossly inadequate and requires strategic planning, investment, and resource support.. There has been a low proportional output in several diseases or conditions that contribute substantially to mortality and morbidity. There is a need to develop a critical mass of researchers in various sub-fields affecting health. Besides, the resources available for research (human, financial, and infrastructure) should be accessed and used more judiciously to address national priorities. There should be a proper resource allocation to different areas, which should also be monitored regularly. Access to national and international literature and knowledge base should be provided to contributors and users of health research.",
