When the detergent is removed,\nthe target membrane protein simultaneously assembles with the phospholipids\ninto a discoidal bilayer, with the size controlled by the length of\nthe MSP (Figure 2).\nThe standard method for self-assembling an MP into a nanodisc is shown\nin Figure 2, route\n1: after detergent solubilization and purification, the target MP\n(green) is mixed with the membrane scaffold protein (MSP, blue) and\nlipids at the correct stoichiometry, followed by detergent removal\nthrough incubation with hydrophobic beads. Often, however, the MP is\nnot stable in detergent for the extended times needed for purification.\nAlternatively (Figure 2, route 2), the starting membrane or tissue can be directly solubilized\nwith excess lipid and scaffold protein and rapid detergent removal.\nThis results in the placement of the target MP (green), together with\nother MPs (gray) in the tissue, into the nanodisc. Subsequent purification,\noften with an affinity tag, is performed, and the target is stabilized\nin the nanodisc environment. This latter route can also be used to\ngenerate a soluble MP library that faithfully represents the MPs in\nthe starting tissue. The resulting nanodisc keeps the proteins in\nsolution, providing stability by retaining these membrane proteins\na native-like phospholipid bilayer environment. Nanodiscs can be immobilized\nonto surfaces, allowing for kinetic studies and drug binding determination\nto be carried out between soluble molecules and incorporate membrane\nproteins.43,44 Phage display selection can also be performed\nusing nanodisc-bound proteins as targets, to select for high-quality\nsynthetic reagents that bind membrane proteins in native-like lipid\nenvironments.19 Recently, incorporating\ntherapeutic antibodies into nanodiscs was also proposed.45 A critical factor to successfully forming a\nnanodisc relies on ensuring the correct stoichiometry of phospholipids,\nMSP, and target protein.46 Incorrect stoichiometries\nof lipids, MSP, and target protein results in aggregates and varying\nnondiscoidal structures, which are difficult to separate and characterize\nand to isolate the desired nanolipoprotein particles. The nanodisc\nmethod also requires the membrane protein to be assembled from the\ndetergent-solubilized state. Therefore, this method will not work\nif the target protein is already in an aggregated soluble state\u2014where\nthe protein is already in aqueous solution but likely inactive.",

This approach of extracting membrane proteins\nand then placing them into a native lipid environment is similar to\nthe nanodisc method detailed above; however, unlike nanodiscs, the\nSMALP approach does not require the membrane protein to be presolubilized\nin detergent before insertion into the lipid nanoparticle. The SMALP\nstructure is stabilized by the intercalation of hydrophobic styrene\ngroups between the acyl chains of the lipid bilayer, whereas the hydrophilic\nmaleic acid groups are presented to the solvent. The encapsulated\nbilayer retains many of the physical properties of the parent membrane,\nincluding the lipid mixture49 and structural\norganization and phase behavior.50 Although\nthis method is effective in preserving membrane proteins with a native\nlipid envelope, there are some limitations need to be taken into\naccount. The disc shaped SMALP has a maximum nominal diameter of 15\nnm, which corresponds to a molecular mass of less than \u223c400\nkDa.50 Therefore, proteins that are too\nlarge to fit within this limit are unlikely to be solubilized. The\nformation of SMALP also requires a pH above 6.5, which means downstream\nexperiments also need to be carried out at above pH 6.5 to maintain\nthe SMALP structure. The SMA polymer is an effective chelator of divalent\ncations such as Mg2+ and Ca2+, with the chelate\nalso being insoluble.48 As such, downstream\nexperiments that require high concentrations of divalent cations (>5\nnM) could disrupt the SMALP. Divalent cations can be found in membrane\nproteins that bind nucelotides such as ABC transporters and ATPases.\nHowever, experiments could be adjusted with lower concentrations of\nnucelotides to preserve SMALP integrity while still maintaining native\nlevels of membrane protein activity to work around this limitation.",

The lamellae of liposomes are\ncomposed of a bilayer of lipids with a hydrophobic midplane to separate\nthe two aqueous volumes. Interaction of the lipid with membrane proteins\nhas been shown to promote proper orientation, which influences protein\nfunction.22 In this method, membrane-bound\nproteins were purified from their native membrane environment and\nthen further reconstituted into liposomes by comicellization of the\npurified membrane protein in excess of phospholipids and detergents\nto form a solution of lipid/protein/detergent or lipid/detergent micelles.22 Dialysis, dilution, or adsorption are common\nreconstitution methods, with these methods all working by reducing\nthe concentration of the detergent below its critical micelle concentration.\nEach reconstitution method has its disadvantages. Dialysis can take\nweeks in cases where the detergent has low critical micelle concentration\u2014this\nlength of time can result in denaturation of the membrane proteins.\nDilution results in large volumes, which subsequently lowers protein concentrations\u2014making downstream experiments difficult.

These containers resist solubilization by detergents,\nwhich allow GPCRs to be solubilized in situ while maintaining an\nassociation with the protein\u2019s genetic information. The pore\nsize of the nanocontainer is controlled to permit GPCR ligands to\npermeate, but also allowing the solubilized receptor to remain within\nthe nanocapsule. Fluorescently labeled ligands are then used to bind\nto those GPCR variants inside the nanocontainers that remain active\nin detergent. Recently CHESS has been developed to evolve stable and soluble proteins directly.60 The protein\nsuperfolder GFP was evolved using CHESS to become resistant to detergents\nincluding sodium dodecyl sulfate, high temperatures, and low pH. This\nallowed large libraries of soluble proteins to be directly screened\nfor stability under these conditions. Some limitations remain, including\nthe requirement to link a target protein to a fusion molecule so that its molecular\nweight is greater than 70 kDa (this prevents the protein from diffusing\nout of the nanocontainer). Although low-pH (<6) conditions resulted\nin some viable nanocapsules, many aggregated, which suggests that\nfurther optimizations remain in sample preparation and reducing exposure\ntime to maximize the selection of viable soluble proteins in acidic\nconditions. High-pH (<9) conditions resulted in dissolutions of\nthe nanocapsules, which suggests that alternative nanocapsule coatings\nwould be required to select for viable proteins in high-pH conditions.\nCurrently, CHESS also requires a fluorescent readout to determine protein\nstability for fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) selection.\nHowever, FACS is a powerful system for rapidly sorting cells, and\nas such, coupled with CHESS, allows for the direct selection of rare\nmutations that infer increases in protein stability under abnormal\ncell conditions.

These selected (purified) landscape\nphages could then be immobilized onto a substrate and used as protein\ncapture agents to detect target antigens in a sandwich ELISA system.115 By using whole landscape phage directly as\nprotein capture probes, this method retains the protein binding octapeptides\nin their native phage wall environment. This reduces time and complexity\nin construction of a biosensor. Interestingly, removing the entire\ncoating protein wall from the phage particle and immobilizing that\ncell wall composition on a substrate as a enzyme binder in a microarray\nare not as effective (sensitive) as keeping the whole landscape phage\nparticle intact.116 The drop in sensitivity\ncould be attributed to the isolated cell coating wall having a lower\nsurface area to bind enzymes as compared the intact spherical-shaped\nfilamentous landscape phage. The density of polypeptides per area\nin the microarray landscape phage surface was found to be greater\nthan traditional microarray immobilization peptide strategies.116 Whole-cell landscape phage has also been used\nto specifically capture SW620 colorectal carcinoma cells onto an label-free\nEIS biosensor.117 Each landscape phage\ncontains 4000 copies of octapeptides\u2014which translate to 4000\nrecognition sites. A multivalent effect can be achieved when targeting\nwhole cells, as these cells contain many binding sites across their\nsurface. This results in increased avidity, and affinity is possible\ndue to the interaction of thousands of recognition sites on landscape\nphage to many binding sites on carcinoma cells.117 These applications have shown phage particles can be mutated\nto bind biomolecules and cells of interest. However, given filamentous\nlandscape phage particles can be up to 800\u2013900 nm in length\nand only a few nanometers in diameter,118 the string-like dimensions of these particles could pose a problem\nfor some applications where micrometer-sized particles could interfere\nwith biosensor sensitivity or specificity. Furthermore, previous work\nhas shown decreased sensitivity in isolated cell coat protein octapeptides,116 which suggests these particles are the most\neffective when intact and not in nanometer-sized fragments. Nonetheless,\nthe applications demonstrated so far have shown that landscape phage\nhas good scope as both a screening platform and a biosensing interface.\nAs demonstrated in this review, cell envelope composition reagents can\nbe reliably generated for use in biosensors.",

The nanoscaled cell wall\nfragment of these antibody composite structures renders exceptional\ntemperature storage, and biosensor application stability. We now propose\nan integrated platform technology (Figure 9) that incorporates rapid isolation of antibodies\nusing yeast display, followed by production and integration of nanoyeast\u2013scFv\ninto a device for rapid deployment. The ability to rapidly isolate\nantibodies using antibody display libraries technologies (bacteriophage,\nbacteria, yeast, and mammalian cell display) is well-established.\nHowever, the success of the technique is highly dependent on the quality\nof the antigen presented to the library, and isolation of antibodies\nagainst native membrane proteins can be challenging. We recently developed\nan antibody library biopanning technique that utilizes whole cells,\nwhich ensures recombinant membrane-bound proteins maintain their native\nconformation.8 There are relatively few\nexamples of successful cell-based biopanning methods in the literature,\nand most such methods fail to overcome the limitations of biopanning\non the cell surface, namely, the low target density and the high background\nof irrelevant antigens.",

Nanodiscs and other biological\nnanoparticles have demonstrated great utility in providing stability\nto membrane proteins by encapsulating these proteins in stabilizing\nphospholipids, allowing these membrane proteins to remain in solution\nand hence in a native-like environment. Cell-wall-based compositions\nhave been developed in response to scFv solubilization challenges.\nRetaining a native yeast cell wall environment (i.e., a semirigid\npolysaccharide, lipid, and protein matrix) for yeast displayed scFvs\nhas further stabilized these antibody fragments for use in diagnostic\napplications. Screening of yeast display libraries facilitates rapid\nisolation of high-affinity scFvs binders and then, crucially, correctly\ndisplay the scFvs on the yeast membrane surface. In this way scFvs\ncan be kept attached to the yeast cell wall, allowing these diagnostic\nagents to remain in the environment from which they were selected,\nthus providing much needed stability to these affinity binders. Nanoyeast\u2013scFv\ncan be lyophilized for long-term storage for up to a year. An assay\ncan then be directly conducted on these lyophilized agents to reduce\nantibody production time. However, more advances will need to be made\nto this new production process to ensure that the reagents have the\nflexibility and sensitivity to stand alongside mAbs as alternative\ndiagnostic protein capture agents. Currently, lyophilized, whole yeast\u2013scFvs\nare insoluble and are too large for many diagnostic applications.\nTheir readout method is also limited by the use of labeled secondary\nantibodies. To address these limitations, nanoyeast\u2013scFvs were\ninvented.25\u221227 Nanoyeast\u2013scFvs are designed as a new diagnostic\nprotein capture agent used in immunosensors of disease biomarkers. These novel reagents build upon the work advanced\nby whole yeast\u2013scFvs24 but can overcome many of the limitations posed by that technology. Small,\nsoluble agents are produced which can be used in a variety of molecular\nbiosensing platforms, all while retaining the stability and quick\ntime to manufacture and low-cost advantages presented by whole yeast\u2013scFv.\nTogether, these advances in cell envelope compositions have demonstrated\nthat cell-surface proteins are best studied or utilized in their native\nenvironments. Furthermore, cell biopanning methods can be used to\nselect antibodies toward membrane proteins in their native cell environment,\nallowing for the production of high-affinity binders.
