            "text": "The autonomic nervous system regulates internal homeostasis. This regulatory process is functionally mediated by the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the nervous system, which generally work in opposition to each other. Sympathetic functions typically enable 'fight or flight' responses, whereas the parasympathetic division is more involved in 'rest and digest' functions of target organs. Fluctuations in heart rate (HR), for example, are influenced by both the sympathetic and parasympathetic pathways, and spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) can distinguish components contributed by each pathway1,2. In humans, decreased HRV is currently used as a predictor of increased morbidity and mortality with various forms of cardiovascular3,4,5 and non-cardiovascular diseases6,7. Direct innervation of immune system components has been demonstrated for the sympathetic pathway but not for the parasympathetic pathway8; however, there is much evidence to suggest that the parasympathetic nervous system down-modulates the immune response9,10.",

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by immune effector cell insult on the myelin sheath of the central nervous system. MS can be associated with a monophasic, relapsing or chronic disease course. There have been numerous reports of autonomic and cardiovascular dysfunction associated with the disease11,12,13,14. In some cases, autonomic dysfunction has been correlated with disease status and fatigue in people with MS15,16,17. Other studies have noted a correlation in MS patients between cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction and midbrain or brainstem lesions observed by magnetic resonance imaging18,19,20. Spectral analyses of HRV in individuals with MS have indicated disturbances in both parasympathetic and sympathetic pathways21,22,23. Researchers attempting to study the involvement of autonomic disturbance in MS have encountered various difficulties related to the unpredictability and extended length of the disease course, as well as problems associated with continuous monitoring.",

In mouse 4, in which EAE was relatively severe, HR remained elevated for much longer after disease onset compared with the HR of mouse 2, which had moderate EAE. In mouse 2, HR peaked close to disease onset but then quickly returned to normal levels. This indicates that the pre-disease diurnal pattern can re-emerge after recovery from acute EAE; the rate at which this occurs may be connected to the peak severity of clinical disease. A return to pre-disease physiologic patterns after recovery may be normal in the SJL mouse, as EAE follows a remitting-relapsing disease course in this strain. Because this was a pilot study, we observed mice for only 17 d. It is not known whether normal HR and BP patterns would be disrupted to the same extent with each relapse, or whether these patterns would be fully restored at each remission. Nor is it known whether or to what extent these physiological parameters might vary during chronic EAE. Studies with longer durations and larger group sizes are needed to investigate these questions, and our results suggest that such studies are feasible. Our results may be relevant to chronic fatigue, a common debilitating condition associated with MS, particularly because autonomic dysfunction, disturbances of the circadian rhythm and deregulation of hormonal signals associated with the sleep-wake cycle (all of which can affect HR and BP) are believed to contribute to chronic fatigue34,35.",

Researchers have since been able to examine the effects of cardiac-associated mutations on HRV in various mouse models, including mice lacking the Mas proto-oncogene37, as well as transgenic mice with overexpression of a cardiac-specific GTPase32. To our knowledge, our present study is the first to investigate fluctuations in HRV related to the onset of autoimmune disease in a mouse model. Our analysis of HRV by frequency domain detected changes at both high and low spectral frequencies in mice with induced EAE; these findings may indicate the disruption of both sympathetic and parasympathetic influences29,32. Analysis by time domain also indicates that a disruption of autonomic control may occur in EAE mice. Further investigation is needed to determine whether HRV in EAE is a relevant parameter for studying autonomic dysfunction in MS, particularly chronic disease. Such studies may also provide insight into the involvement of cardiovascular disease and fatigue in MS.",

Additional reports have found disturbances associated with the circadian control of core body temperature41,42. The importance of the circadian clock in maintaining a daily rhythm for metabolic and physiologic functions, including control of the autonomic nervous system, suggests that disruption of clock function could contribute to numerous chronic diseases43,44. Physiological monitoring of HR and BP in animal models may provide an approach for understanding the roles of such disruptions.",
