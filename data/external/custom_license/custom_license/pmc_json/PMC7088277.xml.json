By \u201chand hygiene promotion,\u201d I mean efforts to instruct a broad, lay public in hygiene practices typically used to reduce the transmission of disease-causing pathogens in hospitals and clinics. In this essay, I use \u201chandwashing campaigns\u201d and \u201chand hygiene promotion\u201d interchangeably to describe the discursive encouragement of this habit. I also focus mainly on hand hygiene promotion within North America, where amid H1N1 handwashing campaigns and hand hygiene products alike became endemic. Commenting on this trend in a New Yorker essay, Owen (2013) links the phenomenal success of Gojo Industry\u2019s blockbuster hand sanitizer, Purell, to anxieties about infection risk.5 Today, hand sanitizer is a product category in its own right, and its popularity is sometimes regarded critically as both indicative of and responsible for a distinct shift in cultural perceptions of infection risk.6 In my view, however, Purell\u2019s unprecedented sales figures7 are inextricably tied both to the increased promotion of hand hygiene in recent decades and to the ongoing individualization of public health.",

Hand hygiene is a vital form of infection control, and as such, it is also an ethical practice, particularly during an outbreak. Rather than argue against hand hygiene, I explore the limits of hand hygiene promotion, as well as its implication in the deepening entrenchment of the new public health. In this respect, my essay draws its inspiration from the work of Metzl, who in the introduction to his co-edited multidisciplinary anthology Against Health, writes that health is a \u201cdesired state, but it is also a prescribed state and an ideological position\u201d (2010, 2). The same argument applies to public health, which broadly speaking entails the strategic, organized effort to \u201cpersuade a defined public to engage in behaviors that that will improve health or refrain from behaviors that are unhealthy\u201d (Springston 2013, 713). Hand hygiene promotion especially invites further scrutiny because its prescriptive, ideological qualities far too often go unnoticed. Hence, I focus my attention here on describing how handwashing campaigns benefit the overarching emphasis on personal responsibility for infection risk.",

In fact, just as in North America, hand hygiene promotion directed at publics in developing countries aims to empower these publics to protect themselves from the risk of infection. Since 2008, for example, Global Handwashing Day has been celebrated annually on October 5. An initiative of the Global Public-Private Partnership for Handwashing with Soap (Global PPPHW), Global Handwashing Day is \u201cdedicated to increasing awareness and understanding about the importance of handwashing with soap as an effective and affordable way to prevent diseases and save lives.\u201d The celebration also presents \u201can opportunity to . . . encourage people to wash their hands\u201d\u2014or, as explained in a Global Handwashing Day press release, to inspire personal responsibility.9 In developing countries, hand hygiene promotion\u2019s emphasis on personal responsibility may affect perceptions of entitlement to care. Indeed, Global Handwashing Day presents infection risk as managed not through the provision of clean water or proper sanitation but rather through the adoption of appropriate personal measures.",

Current sponsors include Colgate-Palmolive, Procter and Gamble, and Unilever, all companies with a massive stake in the global marketplace for personal hygiene products. (Corporate sponsors may also have influenced the naming of the Global Public-Private Partnership for Handwashing with Soap. Even the scholarship produced by the researchers working for this partnership typically includes this addendum.) Global Handwashing Day\u2019s instruction in the consumption of personal hygiene products, too, has ties to the overarching emphasis on personal responsibility that defines the new public health. Hand hygiene is promoted as a \u201cdo-it-yourself vaccine,\u201d a hedge against infection risk (apparently) even in settings in which infection risk often stems from poor sanitation and lack of access to clean water.10",

Hand hygiene limits the spread of diarrheal and respiratory diseases, which are among the leading causes of child mortality in developing countries.11 Children thus comprise a key audience for Global Handwashing Day, which seeks to transform them into \u201cchange agents\u201d who have the capacity to \u201cpositively influence other people\u2019s health behaviours\u201d (Global PPPHW 2015). However, as Plyushteva observes, Global Handwashing Day\u2019s celebration of the life-saving power of individual behavior change potentially obscures understandings of the structural factors that shape infection risk. In developing countries, for example, the spread of disease stems from lack of access to clean water and adequate waste disposal and not mainly from a lack of agency per se. In tying infection risk to the \u201csuboptimal behaviour of the poor\u201d (2009, 428), handwashing campaigns in developing countries exacerbate longstanding power imbalances, potentially reinforcing rather than removing obstacles to meaningful change. At the same time, hand hygiene promotion in this context expands the global marketplace for personal hygiene products, forging new opportunities to profit from the intractable problem of infectious disease.",

So unproblematic is hand hygiene, and so important are efforts to promote it, that the very few criticisms of Global Handwashing Day have largely been ignored.12 For her part, Plyushteva takes issue with the celebration\u2019s stigmatizing of people in developing countries \u201cas traditional or backward, or, in a teleological view of development, pre-modern\u201d (424).

Circulated within workplaces, schools, transit hubs, airports, community centers, groceries stores, and shopping malls, handwashing campaigns portray individual bodies, and body parts, as dangerous vectors of infectious disease. What makes these bodies, and parts, dangerous is both that they spread infection and because the disease-causing pathogens they transmit remain invisible to the individuals who transmit them. As a caption for a handwashing poster created by Yale University\u2019s Emergency Management Department in 2009, in response to H1N1, puts it, \u201cYou\u2019ve got a mystery on your hands.\u201d",

Even in developed countries, where the assumption of personal responsibility is less likely to be impeded by structural issues, hand hygiene promotion may nevertheless skew perceptions of contextual or social determinants of infection risk.

At one level, as exercises in risk communication, handwashing campaigns satisfy the obligation to inform publics about how to diminish the risk of infection. The most effective display of hand hygiene promotion\u2019s function as a form of risk communication may be the infographics, often posted in public restrooms, that illustrate the handwashing procedures practiced by healthcare professionals. These infographics teach handwashing methods, but they also serve to emphasize the need for personal responsibility in public settings. Indeed, at another level, many handwashing campaigns often serve more expressly rhetorical goals. The most effective\u2014and the most problematic\u2014is the use of hand hygiene promotion to exacerbate a whole host of negative emotions, from anxiety, distrust, fear, and doubt to nausea and disgust. Some of the most prominent voices behind the turn to hand hygiene promotion, particularly in developed countries, have emphatically defended the rhetorical utility of public health campaigns that inspire feelings of disgust.14 In my close reading, I focus more on this latter function of handwashing campaign\u2014that is, its use to foster emotional states that predispose audiences to the adoption of personal responsibility.",

Personal failure is generally attributed to personal failings, and the victim is all too often blamed\u201d (2005, 76). Harvey\u2019s account stresses the economic advantages of the neoliberal emphasis on personal responsibility. Indeed, a neoliberal approach to infection risk has both shifted attention away from costlier programs of outbreak management and accorded private stakeholders unparalleled economic advantages. Arguably, the main benefactors of personal responsibility for infection risk are the corporations that develop and distribute products in support of illness etiquette. Yet the recent popularity of hand sanitizer does more than reflect the successful marketing of hand hygiene as an antidote to both uncertainty and infection. Rather, this shift in consumptive patterns also illustrates the tremendous impact of handwashing campaigns on a risk-oriented subjectivity.",

Non-compliance with the dictates of hand hygiene promotion becomes grounds not merely for blame but also for suspicion about a person\u2019s moral worth. Contemporary handwashing campaigns thus form a constitutive rhetoric, a mode of rhetorical appeal that calls into existence a shared collective identity. Within hand hygiene promotion, the collectivity identity called into existence is that of the health citizen for whom participation in containing an outbreak is a personal responsibility.15 White describes \u201cconstitutive rhetoric\u201d (a term that he coined) as \u201cthe central art by which culture and community are established, maintained, and transformed\u201d (1985, 28). Scholars use constitutive rhetoric to explain the discursive formation of new social and political subjectivities. In demonstrating how some rhetorics discursively constitute the very subjects they address, many critics follow Charland\u2019s model of constitutive rhetoric (1987).16 Into White\u2019s theory, Charland incorporates Burke\u2019s notion of identification (1969) and Althusser\u2019s idea of interpellation, or \u201chailing\u201d (1971). As Charland observes, constitutive appeals produce and reinforce new subject positions (1987). By responding to these appeals, individuals affirm their membership in the community.",

The strategic constitution of bodily risk, Dumit argues, is essential to keeping Americans on \u201cdrugs for life.\u201d Scholars of rhetoric of health and medicine have employed constitutive rhetoric to critique the interpellation of headache patients as well as of patients as narrative subjects (Segal 2005). Derkatch has used constitutive rhetoric to account for the maintenance of professional boundaries in medicine (2012), whereas Kopelson has shown in response to breast cancer, public health organizations mobilize citizens as consumer-activists (2013). Majdik and Platt describe the health subject constituted by the marketing campaign for a genetic testing product (2012). Interpellation has also been a productive means for scholars to describe how public health officials shape perceptions of risk and responsibility in response to outbreak (Briggs 2004; Davis, Stephenson, and Flowers 2011).

The adoption of illness etiquette in response to hand hygiene promotion thus signals at least a partial acceptance of the new public health.18 Because it singles out the individual bodies\u2014and individual body parts\u2014that spread infection, hand hygiene promotion might be understood as both a constitutive rhetoric and a \u201cstigmatizing rhetoric.\u201d Proposed by Metzl in Against Health (2010) and premised on the writings of Goffman ([1963] 1986), a stigmatizing rhetoric derives its conception of the \u201chealthy\u201d from portrayals of the \u201cunhealthy.\u201d In other words, notions of poor health shore up understandings of good health. As Metzl asserts, within a stigmatizing rhetoric, the \u201caffirmation of one\u2019s own health depends on the constant recognition, and indeed the creation, of the spoiled health of others\u201d (2010, 5). Taking up Metzl\u2019s refrain, some of the contributors to the multidisciplinary anthology, Against Health, critique the centrality of stigmatizing rhetoric to a neoliberal model of public health. LeBesco, for example, argues that U.S. anti-obesity campaigns reinforce the valuing of \u201cgood citizens [who] take care of their own health\u201d (2010, 78) at the expense of those classified as overweight or obese. Handwashing campaigns potentially display such a stigmatizing rhetoric whenever their promotion of hand hygiene casts it as a prosocial behavior rather than as merely a method of infection control. According to these stigmatizing texts, the failure to observe hand hygiene has profound consequences in addition to the potential for infection.",

I chose this campaign both because of its focus on the workplace and because its messages about risk and responsibility later saw replication in other states (for example, by the Michigan Department of Health).19 The Fifth Guy campaign includes an interactive website that hosts a series of public service announcements (PSAs). Together, these PSAs underscore the need for personal responsibility by dramatizing the tensions that arise when someone in the workplace ignores his duty to limit the spread of infection. Underlying the Fifth Guy, as I argue, is the message that infection risk is exacerbated mainly by the failure to assume personal responsibility. My close reading of the Fifth Guy also reveals an emphasis on feelings of anxiety, fear, and even self-doubt.

Similarly, poor hand hygiene\u2014or a lack of hand hygiene\u2014increases the likelihood of the transmission pathogens, both from contaminated surfaces to individuals and between individuals as well.20 Yet, the goal of Ben\u2019s urinal appears not to be to instruct the workers of Florida in the problem of fomite transmission.

The Fifth Guy\u2019s attributions of intentionality may be the campaign\u2019s most problematic feature and not simply because such attributions may be likely to exacerbate interpersonal conflicts within public settings. The use of a constitutive, stigmatizing rhetoric has consequences for shared perceptions of infection risk. It is to these perceptions that I now turn my attention.",

            "text": "Three configurations of infection risk emerge from the Fifth Guy\u2019s encouragement of personal responsibility. First, the most serious risk depicted throughout the campaign is exposure to Ben, who is a \u201cwalking pandemic,\u201d possibly even the source of plague. In implying that infection risk is determined mainly by exposure to others, this configuration places undue emphasis on the need for hypervigilance in interpersonal interactions. In Ben\u2019s story, the assumption of personal responsibility for infection risk takes the form of a kind of citizen-epidemiology, with everyone working to root out sources of infection. Yet shy of engaging in self-quarantine, most people exercise only limited control over their exposure to others. Perhaps in recognition of this fact, the \u201cFifth Guy\u201d instructs in subtle pressures that might be applied to those individuals determined to be the potential source of infection\u2014for example, through stigma. Second, infection risk is determined largely by one\u2019s ability to control and manage certain behaviors. Conversely, failure to change habits increases our risk. Different scenes from the Fifth Guy illustrate this formulation of infection risk. Motivated by the threat of Ben\u2019s behavior, his coworkers more than once demonstrate for the camera different practices for limiting infection risk. In displaying their compliance with illness etiquette to the camera rather than to Ben, his colleagues indicate the necessity of habitual and bodily responses to the management of infection risk.",

            "text": "A third assumption is underscored within the numerous texts that together form the campaign\u2019s overarching message about risk and responsibility. In the Fifth Guy, a lack of knowledge increases one\u2019s risk of infection. Ben, who displays ignorance of his duty to manage risk, teaches that being knowledgeable reduces the risk of infection (not to mention the threat of expulsion from the group). Other elements of the campaign reinforce this equation of knowledge with the assumption of responsibility for infection risk. Visitors to the \u201cFifth Guy\u201d website can, for example, take a quiz that tests their \u201chygiene IQ.\u201d Their scores determine \u201cwhich person\u201d they are in the workplace drama of illness and infection. Yet, as anyone who takes the quiz may quickly realize, it is only possible to either be the \u201cfifth guy\u201d (ignorant) or not the fifth guy (not ignorant). Users who select the incorrect answer to a series of five questions are also goaded to correct their mistakes by the message, \u201cWrong. Who are you, the fifth guy?\u201d Most of these wrong answers correspond with Ben\u2019s behaviors in different scenes from the campaign PSAs.",

Within the new public health, this focus on behavioral change is frequently regarded mainly as an alternative to the implementation of costlier, more comprehensive forms of protection, treatment, and care. Problematically, however, this encouragement of the personal responsibility for infection risk ignores the influence of contextual and environmental factors. Complex economic and social factors, from social support networks to gender, ethnicity, race, and culture, shape and determine the health of populations. Instead, even those campaigns that single out the person who (like Ben) does not adhere to the dictates of illness etiquette imply equality in our susceptibility to (or risk of) infection.",
