Comments were also made regarding information overload, the lack of clarity regarding roles and the lack of clear guidance from DH.

Nevertheless, the study area contains a similar proportion of single-handed GPs (11% in this study compared to 12% nationally) and male GPs (69% in this study compared to 60% nationally) to that seen nationally [10]. The response rate of 54% is comparable to that obtained from other GP questionnaire surveys (30%-63%) focusing on preparedness for public health emergencies [4\u20138]. However, response bias may have occurred as news media reports may have prompted a response from those who were concerned about pandemic influenza. Indeed, it is recognised that news media serve as a major source of information for physicians and can influence physician behaviour [11\u201313]. The remarkable increase in questionnaires received following the reminder in January provides evidence to support these roles as there appears to be a temporal association between the increased return of questionnaires and news media reporting of the first cases of human avian influenza outside Asia [14, 15]. Although the survey instrument defined the term \u2018pandemic influenza\u2019, it is possible that different interpretations of this definition may have influenced the responses to a number of questions. Nevertheless, we believe that the results obtained are valid.",

In view of the potentially devastating impact of an influenza pandemic and the \u2018front-line\u2019 role expected of GPs, simply raising awareness may not translate into improved preparedness. Policy makers will need to identify ways to meet the challenge including more effective communication, detailed educational and training needs assessment and delivery, targeting staff in non-urban areas and ensuring that pandemic preparedness is seen as cost-effective public health policy.
