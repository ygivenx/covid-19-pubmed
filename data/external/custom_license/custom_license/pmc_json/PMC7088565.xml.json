In particular, there has been increased recognition of the functional needs and assets of high-risk populations. Community organizations (such as The Canadian Red Cross, food banks, shelters) are acknowledged as essential partners across different levels of government, for their expertise in providing supportive services to high-risk populations (Choudhury and Haque 2018; Lemyre et al. 2009). In this paper, we reflect upon this shift that has occurred since the global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and highlight considerations for future investment in disaster risk reduction using an inclusive, whole-of-society approach.",

In 2004, the creation of the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) was an important investment and commitment to public health at the federal level. Following SARS, avian influenza virus (H5N1) provoked tremendous concern in 2006 given its high human mortality rate and disproportionate impacts for health care workers (PHAC 2015). By 2006, pandemic planning was in full swing and a revised Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan for the Health Care Sector (CPIP) was published. CPIP was created as a guidance document to inform and support the health care sector in the management of pandemics (PHAC 2015). It outlines the roles, responsibilities and strategies to be used by the federal government to mitigate, prepare for, and respond to large-scale outbreaks of influenza. In 2009, a psychosocial annex was developed to supplement the plan (PHAC 2009). Acknowledgement of occupational risks to health care workers and risks to socially vulnerable groups in society was an important advancement in pandemic planning at that time. Resilience of the broader community is dependent on health care workers and responders being able (and willing) to work during an outbreak; without them health and social systems would collapse and put other people at further risk of adverse outcomes (O\u2019Sullivan et al. 2007).",

An important step forward in recognition of persons at heightened social risk during pandemic is the list (Box 2) provided by the federal government (PHAC 2015, p. 14), as a sample of personal, geographic, and social attributes that could render individuals vulnerable during pandemic.

Uptake of this framework in Canada was widespread in the field of emergency management. Recognition of functional needs as a specific planning consideration had started. Over the next few years, the C-MIST framework (Kailes and Enders 2007) was adapted in Canada to incorporate different categories and functions to assist in emergency planning. In 2009, the Centre for Emergency Preparedness and Response and the British Columbia Coalition for Persons with Disabilities expanded on C-MIST by separating the medical category and including an additional category labelled psychosocial (Martin 2009).",

We called ourselves Enhancing Resilience and Capacity for Health (EnRiCH) which quickly developed into interconnected networks of international collaborators, Canadian scientists, and a youth initiative. From 2010 to 2013, The EnRiCH Project highlighted the importance of inclusive engagement of high-risk populations in disaster preparedness, response, and recovery activities. In January 2010, we held a consultation with 20 members of the EnRiCH Advisory Panel to revise the C-MIST framework for use in an asset mapping exercise with five communities in Canada. Through feedback from the communities and pilot testing, the adapted framework was referred to as a Functional Capabilities Framework, to reflect an asset-based approach. We used the acronym CHAMPSS for the following categories: communication, housing, awareness, mobility and transportation, psychosocial, self-care and daily tasks, safety, and security and applied the framework by coding assets in different communities in Canada, (O\u2019Sullivan et al. 2013). Following the revision of the CHAMPSS framework, we conducted an action research project in five communities in Canada where community members\u2014including representatives of high-risk populations\u2014used this framework to map the assets in their communities. This project highlighted strategies for inclusive engagement and collaboration across different organizations and sectors in the community, to support resilience for high-risk populations in different disaster contexts.",

When people are labelled vulnerable, it is a deficit-oriented frame through which they are being viewed; it conveys negative connotations such as weakness or infirmity. This is particularly apparent when the deficit label comes before the person and becomes the attribute used to describe someone (e.g. disabled person, stroke victim). Alternatively, person-first language puts the person ahead of the functional limitation (e.g. person who is experiencing homelessness vs. homeless person). This discourse respects the dignity of the person and acknowledges there are many different characteristics that make up a person. This point is the essence of asset literacy and underscores the importance of seeing people and their unique asset profiles\u2014not viewing people simply in terms of the functional limitations they require supports for.

In our exploratory study with women who were living with the impacts of stroke, we presented these four components of asset literacy as a continuous cycle. Asset literacy is a concept closely related to framing and the use of an asset-oriented approach to disaster risk reduction. People feel empowered when they are asked for input and recognized for their assets and contributions\u2014it is an essential component of co-learning in resilient communities (Chaudhury and Haque 2018). As a first step, people can be supported in identifying their own assets and those within their community. Through consultations and mapping activities, discussion about the value and potential contribution of different assets can facilitate understanding and opportunity for mobilizing individual and collective assets. As people gain understanding of their community and fellow citizens, they become more aware of different opportunities for social participation, which can enhance confidence and motivation to engage. If a whole-of-society approach is to be successful, we believe individual and collective asset literacy must be the foundation (O\u2019Sullivan et al. 2017).",

An important social wakeup since the 2003 SARS pandemic is the emergence of the Truth and Reconciliation process in Canada, recognizing the historical cultural genocide of Indigenous peoples caused in part by abuses in government-supported residential schools (Smylie and Firestone 2016). Indigenous peoples in Canada have faced myriad of social, environmental, and biological disasters including the ongoing suicide crisis (Webster 2016), access to safe drinking water (Bradford et al. 2016) and infectious diseases including group A streptococcal (iGAS) infections, rheumatic fever (Bocking et al. 2016), tuberculosis (Patel et al. 2017), and the 2009 pH1N1 (Jung et al. 2017). The sustained high incidence of infectious disease in Indigenous peoples coupled with decreasing incidence in the rest of the Canadian population is suggested to be caused by \u2018structural violence\u2019 such that social structures, institutions, culture, and other factors combine to inform these extreme health disparities (Galtung 1969).

Looking forward, Indigenous peoples are an integral component of any infectious respiratory disease plan, response and recovery process. Indigenous peoples must be invited to contribute to relevant programs, policies, and interventions related to emergency preparedness. CPIP (PHAC 2015) describes Aboriginal peoples as stakeholders consulted in the development of the plans. The Sendai Framework (UNISDR 2015) is more explicit, describing roles for Indigenous peoples within a people-centred approach and to use traditional, Indigenous, and local knowledge and practices to complement scientific knowledge, where appropriate. In Canada, the Federal Ministers met in May 2018 to discuss updates needed for the Federal, Provincial/Territorial (FPT) Emergency Management Strategy for Canada\u2014planned release December 2018. Of note is the inclusion of National Indigenous Organizations in planning. This consultative process is a first step to ensure the updated strategy is inclusive and addresses the identified needs in Indigenous communities. Ongoing consultation, engagement, and integration of traditional knowledge in culturally sensitive ways will be essential (Canadian Intergovernmental Conference Secretariat 2018).",

As with many countries, the concept of family has evolved in Canada to include singles, multigenerational families, roommates, and same-sex couples. Trends in the changing demographics of Canadian families include increases in same-sex unions (0.9% couples) and multigenerational families (Statistics Canada 2017a, b). The traditional, nuclear family is more than a social construct, but functions as a social structure governed by gender roles to reproduce, nurture, and develop family-specific behaviours and actions (Kirschenbaum 2006). Disasters and emergencies are framed locally as impacts to families including fragmentation, loss, displacement, separation, and survival. Evolution of the demographic composition of the \u2018traditional\u2019 family unit has important implications for gender roles, eligibility of information, emotional supports, and compensation for unmarried individuals in the event of an emergency. Children and youth may face unexpected responsibilities when parents are engaged as frontline responders. In 2016, 19.2% of Canadian children lived in single-parent households (Statistics Canada 2017c), representing additional challenges if their caregiver is a first responder or is unable to care for children due to illness. An empirical study designed to assess the inherent resilience of the family unit to emergencies reported that single-parent households were more prepared in terms of supplies, skills, and protection compared to dual-headed households (Kirschenbaum 2006). A family unit tends to have more substantial social networks, which in turn contribute to emergency resilience. It is the social networks, not the family structure, that predict disaster preparedness, such that households without children but with significant social networks may be as resilient (Kirschenbaum 2006).",

The caregivers in this study (n = 19) found this question to be overwhelming and in almost all of the cases they had not thought about a back-up plan and found it daunting to think about. After 6 months of providing care support at home for the stroke survivor, none of the families had developed a back-up caregiving plan, and only 3\u20134 had considered what they might do in the event they needed an alternative. Many cited community care access centres and hospitals as a potential off-the-cuff solution. This study highlights an important consideration for pandemic planning. The assumption of many families that formal respite services will be available during pandemic could present an unanticipated demand on the health system. The framing of high-risk populations needs to include families of people with chronic conditions or disabilities, who are providing invisible supports for the health care system. Informal caregivers are an essential group to engage in the process of pandemic panning to ensure the system can anticipate the demands and family contingency caregiving plans become common practice. Additionally, communication efforts need to focus on building awareness of health care capacity and the implications for service delivery during pandemic.",

Millennials are a heterogenous cohort, but are differentiated by greater educational attainment, are more ethnically diverse, have a more flexible definition of family, embrace multiculturalism and technology (Environics 2017). Traditionally, the acknowledgement of youth in a disaster context has focused on heightened risk due to maturational development and social dependency on family. In recent years, there has been more awareness about the potential benefits of youth engagement in disaster risk reduction in Canada but expansive action has been more limited (Cox et al. 2017). In 2018, a new initiative began with the creation of a national network around youth engagement in disaster risk reduction. This initiative is being conducted by researchers in Ottawa, Chicoutimi, Victoria, and the Eastern Townships of Quebec\u2014including a youth group in Lac-M\u00e9gantic\u2014in partnership with The Canadian Red Cross. It is our plan to implement an asset-based, whole-of-society approach to create opportunities for youth to innovate and contribute to their communities, while reducing risk and building resilience. An important step forward was the inclusion of youth panellists at the 2018 National Platform Meeting on Disaster Risk Reduction, followed by a breakout session on youth engagement. This recognition at the national level is needed to open space for youth voices and foster innovation.",

Millennials and youth, as discussed above, are more likely to use online digital sources including social media, blogs, online news platforms, comedy/news commentary shows but also use traditional media sources including television, radio, and print newspapers (Environics 2017). CPIP (PHAC 2015) incorporates a risk communication approach which includes social marketing and social media. The emergence of social media platforms both challenge preparedness and response while representing immediate communication channels for transmission of updates and messages (Rossmann et al. 2018). Social media platforms can also amplify risk messages; however, the communication dynamics is multidirectional. Risk communication using Twitter, for example, will include postings and responses from experts, stakeholders, journalists, general public, and possibly automated bots (M\u00f8nsted et al. 2017). Journalists will use Twitter to gather new information and to disseminate news stories (Fellenor et al. 2017). Social media represents not only an opportunity to transmit information and update the public, but also to track inquiries, rumours, and myths by monitoring various social media platforms (Panagiotopoulos et al. 2016; Fellenor et al. 2017). Twitter now occupies an established space for crisis communication and discussion, given the immediacy of message communications and updates regarding situational emergencies (Fellenor et al. 2017). The digital divide, however, also suggests that social media can contribute to further marginalization of high-risk populations. Age, socio-economic status, rural and remote geography, and disability may all contribute to decreased use of social media, such that public health organizations will still require multimedia risk communication strategies including outreach, traditional media, and social media platforms.",

False information is perceived as novel and fresh and is spread via Twitter up to six times faster than true information (Vosoughi et al. 2018). Humans are more likely to spread misinformation than Twitter bots (Vosoughi et al. 2018), suggesting that classic principles of risk communication including transparency, acknowledgement of scientific uncertainties, translating scientific information for the lay public, and commitments by governments and agencies to be accountable and regulate risks appropriately is still applicable using a social media context (Leiss 2004). Automated Twitter bots can be programmed within a social network to behave in a human-like manner, disperse messages within typical diurnal periods and within a geographic locus (M\u00f8nsted et al. 2017). Twitter bots amplify and spread both false and true information at similar rates (Vosoughi et al. 2018) and thus could be used opportunistically during a pandemic to spread evidence-based facts, vetted risk communication messages in response to the rumours and misinformation within geographic-Twitter networks.",

Effective risk communication strategies must acknowledge scientific uncertainties and appreciate that public perceptions of risks are often quite different from scientists and government regulators (Leiss 2004). Perceptions of risk, as discussed, are depended on locus of control such that individuals at high risk, who are vulnerable and powerless due to the social gradient of risk (O\u2019Sullivan and Bourgoin 2010), may reframe, mistrust, lose confidence in the risk information provided (Driedger et al. 2018). Perceptions of powerlessness in the face of a pending emergency may provoke xenophobia (blaming other groups), blaming institutions, or disengagement (Driedger et al. 2018). Public responses during a pandemic require modification or adoption of specific behaviours including handwashing hygiene, vaccination, and social distancing. The element of trust between the public and health agencies is a significant factor in public behaviour change such as vaccination (Driedger et al. 2018).",

Awareness and open acknowledgement of the social gradient of risk by all actors involved in pandemic planning and response is an important systemic change. Going forward, to maintain momentum towards inclusive engagement in the implementation of a whole-of-society approach to pandemic planning, there needs to be complementary application of an asset-oriented lens with institutional space for social participation in planning and governance. Change in this type is complex and involves shifting perceptions about people and functional limitations. Use of person-first language and creation of opportunities to network and develop asset literacy are two practical solutions to open the door for active engagement in the coming years. Diversity in Canada is our strength, and innovative solutions will emerge through social participation of diverse groups of citizens who are welcomed and supported by leaders with an upstream vision.",
