In addition, parainfluenza virus 3 and bocavirus were detected in the mimivirus-positive child. Because parainfluenza virus 3 causes pneumonia and bocavirus causes infections with respiratory symptoms, particularly in children of his age, these 2 pathogens probably caused the illness in the child.",
