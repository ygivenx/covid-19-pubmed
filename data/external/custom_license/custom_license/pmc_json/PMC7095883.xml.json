In addition to the viruses examined in our study, rhinovirus may upregulate pneumococcal adherence to respiratory epithelial cells9, and it is possible that coronavirus and human metapneumovirus (an important cause of virus-associated pneumonia in this population10) may be also involved in the pathogenesis of bacterial pneumonia.

During the 7 d before the pneumococcal capsule-induced antibody response, there may be a temporary increase in susceptibility to virus-associated pneumococcal pneumonia, the mechanism of which remains speculative1. We would caution that our data supporting empirical antibiotic use for virus-associated pneumonia apply only to infants in hospital, most of whom would be already receiving antibiotics. Conjugate vaccine has been shown to reduce antibiotic use in outpatient settings11. The lesser impact of PncCV on virus-associated pneumonias in HIV-infected children may be due to the high frequency of concurrent Pneumocystis jiroveci infections (42%) and bacterial infections other than pneumococcal among these children12.",

The data in Table 1 suggest that the population-based effect of the vaccine on total pneumonia, including virus-associated pneumonias, should be considered in terms of total cases prevented and the cost-effectiveness of the vaccine. We have also shown that the vaccine is a useful probe that has established, for the first time to our knowledge, that a significant fraction of viral pneumonia is attributable to bacterial coinfection and is preventable by a bacterial vaccine. Because immunization of children has been shown to reduce invasive pneumococcal disease in adults13, our data suggest that studies should be developed to investigate the strategy of infant immunization with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with influenza and other viral pneumonias in both children and adults.",
