The woman, a school teacher from Jordan, was 32 weeks pregnant; she reported 3 earlier pregnancies (2 live births) and no concurrent conditions. Emergency department (ED) and obstetric physicians suspected urinary tract infection. The patient declined admission but returned to the ED on November 22 with worsening fever, cough, and shortness of breath. She denied recent travel, sick contacts, or animal exposure within the previous 2 weeks. Lung examination results were within normal limits; the patient had no signs of active labor or fetal distress. Chest computed tomography scan revealed bilateral consolidation; pulmonary embolus was not seen.",

On November 24, acute respiratory distress syndrome developed, requiring respiratory and hemodynamic support. Empiric oseltamivir and vancomycin were added to the treatment regimen. Later that day, the baby was delivered by caesarean section because the patient was persistently hypoxemic while on maximal ventilator support. Transient improvement in oxygenation was noted after the delivery. The newborn, who was noted to be healthy and had Apgar scores of 6 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively, had no contact with the mother after birth.",

No symptoms developed, and all staff tested negative for MERS-CoV infection. The lack of cross transmission in the exposed healthcare workers before implementation of protective measures supports the benefit of using standard precautions and the fact that transmission of MERS-CoV between humans remains limited (13).",
