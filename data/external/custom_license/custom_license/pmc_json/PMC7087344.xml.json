An estimated 12.4 million people were newly displaced due to conflict or persecution, equalling an average of 24 people every minute of 2015. Syria had become the largest source country, followed by Afghanistan and Somalia, together accounting for 54% of the global number of refugees and asylum seekers. These people were hosted mostly by neighboring countries like Turkey, Lebanon, and Jordan and only a fraction of them continued their way to Europe [24]. In 2015, approximately one million asylum seekers arrived by sea of which most (around 84%) landed in Greece, trying to subsequently make their way across the central and eastern Mediterranean routes to Western Europe, where Switzerland is one of the primary destination countries [7, 22\u201324].",

Most of the existing studies in the European Region focused on maternity and mental health and are limited by inconsistent definitions of refugees and asylum seekers [3]. Refugee and asylum-seeking children are at particular health risk, highlighted by data collected in 2015 in Croatia by M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, showing that 25% of refugees and asylum seekers requiring medical services were under 5 years of age [4, 5]. Studies from Germany, Netherlands, and Switzerland showed that refugee and asylum-seeking children had higher rates of emergency room presentations and admissions, higher rates of infections like tuberculosis and intestinal parasites, and lower rates of vaccine coverage [11\u201313, 16, 19]. However, health data on asylum seekers and refugees in the European Region, particularly in pediatric populations, is very limited. A review performed in 2012 on the health of migrant children in Switzerland confirms that the literature on this topic is scarce [8].",

Patients claiming asylum for medical reasons were excluded from the final analysis. For patients included in the final analysis, data was extracted from the electronic medical record using a standard form which included country of origin, age, gender, admission and discharge date, department admitted to, diagnoses, any treatment prescribed, any pathogens detected, any laboratory tests performed, and vaccination status.

Over half of the study population was admitted due to infection, one third of which localized in the airways. A high portion of infections was also found in a recent study in admitted asylum-seeking adults and children in the Netherlands, with 48% of infections predominantly caused by tropical diseases like malaria tertiana and tuberculosis [16]. In Germany, two recent studies on unaccompanied refugee minors showed a high prevalence of infections with approximately 20% of parasitic infections [12, 13].",

All cases of malaria originated from Eritrea which was the most frequent country of origin with endemic malaria in our population. Although malaria admission rates in Eritrea declined by over 75% between 2000 and 2014, neighboring Germany detected a sharp increase of Plasmodium vivax malaria in Eritrean migrants between 2014 and 2015 [20, 26]. The reason why we did not find any parasitic intestinal infections may have been the absence of routine screening procedures. Similarly, other screening tests for infections including schistosomiasis, HIV, and hepatitis B and C were not routinely performed but only if a clinical suspicion was present. Furthermore, it is likely that a certain selection of patients occurs in the refugee\u2019s home country upon departure and during transit. Families with limited resources who can only afford to pay for one family member\u2019s journey conceivably will select the healthiest individual with the highest chances to survive the journey.",
