Water molecules can penetrate\nthroughout the G4NH2 interior, cause the dendrimer structure to swell\n(due to the favorable interaction of water molecules with the primary\nand tertiary amines),42,43 and thus release the siRNA. However,\nthe amount of siRNA released from dendriplexes at N/P 30 was statistically\nsignificant different from that at N/P 20 at 12 h and day 2 only.\nSince the in vitro release was conducted with 24\ntime points, we demonstrate that, in 92% of all time points, the siRNA\nreleased from dendriplexes at N/P 20 and 30 was not statistically\nsignificantly different (n = 3 for each time point,\nOne-Way ANOVA followed by Tukey\u2019s posthoc test, p value <0.05).",

We demonstrate in this work two such strategies.\nOne consists in encapsulating the dendriplexes within mannitol microparticles,\nvia spray drying; the other consists in using a CSLA co-oligomer shell\nthat is formed during emulsification diffusion. Mannitol was chosen\nas it has high aqueous solubility, it is a generally recognized as\na safe (GRAS) excipient widely used as bulking agent and nonactive\ncarrier in dry powder inhalers.66 Mannitol\nparticles alone also have shown to have less adhesion/cohesion in\npropellant HFA, slower sedimentation rates, and superior aerosol performance\nthan other sugars, such as lactose.67 The\nCSLA co-oligomer was chosen because it is water-soluble and interfacially\nactive at the W/O interface of the emulsion droplets (it migrates/resides\nat the interface formed between the small water droplets into the\nlarge ethyl acetate organic phase).65 During\nthe emulsification diffusion, the dendriplexes are kept within the\nwater emulsion droplets, and then encapsulated by the CSLA co-oligomer\nresiding at the W/O interface of the emulsion droplets. Thus, the\norganic phase is not expected to be in contact with the siRNA of the\ndendriplexes and/or affect somehow the dendriplex aggregates within\nthe CSLA microparticles. In addition, the CSLA co-oligomer is degradable\nand non-HFA soluble\u2013i.e., the shell will not disintegrate in\nHFA but will break down when in contact with the fluid lining the\nlungs.65 The ester groups from the LA are\nHFA-philic,64,68 and microparticles formed with\nCSLA shell have shown enhanced physical stability in propellant HFAs.33,36,65 An important detail is that the\nnonactive ingredients used to form these microparticles (mannitol\nand CSLA) can readily dissolve in aqueous media65,66 as the fluid lining the lungs, thus releasing the nanosized dendriplexes,\nand consequently minimizing the alveolar macrophage uptake. In addition,\nit is also worthwhile to point out that we have previously shown that\nCSLA does not impact the gene transfer potential of CSLA-based microparticles\nas carriers for CS-pDNA complexes.33",

Aggregates formed due to sedimentation\ncould be easily redispersed by simple manual agitation. In the case\nof CSLA, the improved physical stability compared to dendriplexes\nalone, which are not dispersible in propellant HFA (see SI) arises due to the enhanced solvation of the\nester groups from (LA chains) of CSLA by the propellant HFA.64,68 In the case of the mannitol, the reasons for the enhanced stability\nare less clear, but we expect to have an improved density matching\nto that of HFA-227 since spherical spray-dried mannitol microparticles\nproduce densities \u223c1.47\u20131.51 g \u00d7 cm\u20133 (depending on the spray-drying conditions)69 and the density of HFA-227 is 1.39 at 25 \u00b0C.34 Moreover, the fact that the cohesive force for mannitol\nin HFA is relatively lower compared to other those of other sugars,\nsuch as lactose,67 indicates an enhanced\nsolvation of that surface in the propellant, but this is a relative\nobservation, and no quantitative comparison with the cohesive interaction\nbetween CSLA particles and those with mannitol is available.",
