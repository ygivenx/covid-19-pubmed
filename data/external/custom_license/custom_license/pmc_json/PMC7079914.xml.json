CD13/aminopeptidase N is widely distributed in a variety of mammalian cells such as monocytes/macrophages, fibroblasts, neutrophils, endothelial cells, and epithelial cells [3, 4, 5, 6]. CD13/aminopeptidase N is the major receptor for human coronavirus [7] and gastroenteritis virus [8] and has an important role in HIV entry [9]. This peptidase was shown to be involved in the degradation of extracellular matrix in tumor invasions [10, 11] and the processing of peptide for presentation by antigen-presenting cells [12]. Recently we reported that CD13/aminopeptidase N has the chemotactic activity of T lymphocytes in vitro [13].",

Although their origin has been shown to be multifactorial and involves complex interactions between genetic, environmental, and hormonal factors [15, 16, 17], the precise mechanism of organ inflammations in CVD is still unclear. In this study, we examined the activity of CD13/aminopeptidase N in patients with CVD and found increased activity and expression of it at the disease site and in serum, suggesting an important role in the pathogenesis of CVD.",

Briefly, a flexible fiber-optic Model 1T20 bronchoscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) was wedged into a segmental or subsegmental bronchus of the middle lobe or lingula, and lavage was performed with a total volume of 150 ml of sterile 0.9% saline in three 50-ml portions.

Next, the expression of CD13/aminopeptidase N protein in AM was determined by Western blotting, documented in Fig. 3.

On the other hand, CD13/aminopeptidase N was located in all tissues studied, in which the optimal pH is neutral (pH 6.5\u20138.5) [24].

These results suggest that enzymatically active CD13/aminopeptidase N has a role in the migration of T lymphocytes to the disease site of CVD. On the other hand, CD13/aminopeptidase N is known to be present on cell surface as the membrane-bound enzyme and can cleave N-terminal amino acids from oligopeptides [1]. Recent reports demonstrated increased aminopeptidase activity in urine from patients with diabetic nephropathy [30] and carboplatin-induced renal damage [31] and those treated with extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy [32]. This activity correlated with the extent of renal damage. Accordingly, the proteolytic activity of CD13/aminopeptidase N may induce the degradation of structural proteins, which results in tissue inflammation in CVD.",
