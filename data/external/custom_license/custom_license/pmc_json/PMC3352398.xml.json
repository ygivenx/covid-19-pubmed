So far, however, medicine, nursing and public health have made use of only a fraction of what evolution has to offer. The magnitude of the gap is impressive. Studies of medical education found that most medical schools in the UK and the USA have not one evolutionary biologist on the faculty (Nesse and Schiffman 2003; Harris and Malyango 2005). Many medical students do not even accept the theory of evolution (Downie 2004). Most medical students get two or more years of basic science education, including embryology, biochemistry, anatomy, histology, and physiology, and many get a genetics course from a professor who knows evolutionary biology. However, we know of no medical school that teaches a course in evolutionary biology as a basic medical science, and none that requires evolution as a prerequisite. Our teaching experience confirms that few doctors have a chance to learn the principles of evolutionary biology most useful for medicine.",

Instead of measuring co-citations between traditionally defined fields, Rosvall and Bergstrom (2007) define the boundaries of disciplines empirically from citation patterns. They then analyze the directed flow of citations between disciplines. The results for evolution and medicine are striking (See Fig. 1). Ecology and evolution journals cite work in medical journals occasionally, but medical journals cite work in ecology/evolution journals too rarely to even show up on the diagram. Almost all of the connections have other fields as intermediaries.",

They stem partly from the timing of Flexner\u2019s (1910) report that recommended bringing basic sciences into the medical curriculum. At that time, evolutionary biology was in eclipse. Many scientists thought that Lord Kelvin\u2019s arguments about the rate of the earth\u2019s cooling proved Darwin wrong (Kelvin 1862). Others recognized that Darwin\u2019s theory of transmission by gemmules was inconsistent with his theory of natural selection (Richards 1987). Natural selection was not re-incorporated into biology until its underpinnings in population genetics were developed in the early to middle years of the 20th century (Fisher 1930). Even then, those foundations emphasized mutations and genetic variations, not the shaping of complex adaptations by selection, a field that was only developed by evolutionary and behavioral ecologists in the 1970s and later. Those insights into trait evolution are just now being incorporated into medical science.",

Somehow, from all of these jostling interest groups, priorities and multiple regulations and examination requirements, a Dean and faculty must come up with a curriculum. This makes it difficult to warmly welcome visitors who drop by to point out that a whole huge area of basic science has been omitted from the curriculum. However, evolutionary biology is not just another narrow topic, but a fundamental basic science. Furthermore, it can help make medical education more coherent by giving students a framework for organizing the required 10 000 facts.",

Universities talk a lot about promoting interdisciplinary work precisely because their structures so efficiently prevent it. However, disciplines exist for good reasons. There is too much to know. Trying to synthesize work from diverse areas is frustrating, especially if the goal is general understanding, not some fine point. Also, going beyond your specialty means you will inevitably get some things wrong. It is easier to maintain quality by keeping to a narrow focus.",

This is a proximate explanation that says nothing about why bilirubin exists in the first place. One might think it is simply a waste product. However, the intermediate step between heme and bilirubin is biliverdin, a chemical that is more soluble than bilirubin. So, why does the body go to the trouble to make a difficult-to-excrete toxin?

High bilirubin levels in the first days of life could be merely a result of the changeover to adult hemoglobin, but they could also help protect against oxidative damage from higher levels of oxygen and free iron exposure.

Energy reserves that a female mouse does not invest in the current litter will not benefit the male unless he happens to mate with her again. Conversely, genes from the female benefit by reserving fat stores for future reproduction.

Of course, this does not mean that the gene is useless, only that its effects are covered by redundant systems, that its benefits are manifest only in special situations, or that the benefit is just too small to be observed in a laboratory setting. For instance, genes involved the capacity for shivering might well appear to be harmful, unless one happened to look at their effects in extreme cold.

For many species, senescence in the wild is a deleterious trait with heritable variation, but life spans do not increase, presumably because the reproductive benefits of longer lives would be balanced by costs that decrease reproduction earlier in the life span (Nesse 1988; Austad 2005; Williams et al. 2006).",

These surprising findings are now being interpreted in evolutionary terms (Partridge and Gems 2006; Ackermann and Pletcher 2007; McElwee et al. 2007). They suggest that mechanisms that protect against oxidative damage are limited by their reproductive costs or just lack of selection. They also show how selection can shape special states of reduced metabolism that allow some species to survive periods of privation. These states slow aging dramatically, but they are special states precisely because they also so dramatically reduce reproduction. The ancient dream of extending lifespan no longer seems like just a dream, but do not buy beach property on Hudson Bay just yet.",

A recent report about higher mortality rates for male than female mammals attributes it to both external causes and faster aging. The faster rates of aging for males are found mainly in polygynous species because a shortened reproductive span decreases the force of selection for older males (Clutton-Brock and Isvaran 2007). An evolutionary view of humans suggested looking at the ratio of male to female mortality across the lifespan in different cultures. This found surprising results (Kruger and Nesse 2004). In every culture at every age through late adulthood, mortality rates are higher for men. In modern societies, for every woman who dies at reproductive maturity, three men die. The pattern is consistent in 20 cultures studied. Further work looking at the proximate causes of sex differences in mortality rates finds that they result not only from accidents and violence, but also from the full range of causes of mortality.",

Just a few years after Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, he also discovered antibiotic resistance. The basic phenomenon is very simple. Antibiotics are selction agents that quickly increase the proportion of organisms that can resist them. (Bergstrom and Feldgarden 2007).",

We are now faced with many organisms that resist every available antibiotic; some wonder if the war on infectious disease may be lost (Normark and Normark 2002; Levy and Marshall 2004). Nearly 10% of Staphylococcus aureus are now resistant even to methicillin; infections caused by this resistant organism now cause 18 650 deaths per year, more than the 12 500 caused by AIDS (Klevens et al. 2007).

Continuous application of antibiotics also produces selection to reduce their costs, yielding resistant strains that persist after the antibiotics are withdrawn (Schrag and Perrot 1996).

For instance, steady pertussis vaccination for 40 years may have selected for more virulent strains of the whooping cough bacteria (Diavatopoulos et al. 2005), although decreased vaccination may be responsible for the increased incidence. Imperfect vaccines can create selection pressures for increased virulence (Gandon et al. 2001). This disturbing possibility has been documented for Marek\u2019s disease in chickens (Davison and Nair 2005). However, when a vaccine targets a toxin, selection can decrease virulence. This has happened for diphtheria, where lines that do not produce toxin have largely displaced the dangerous forms (Soubeyrand and Plotkin 2002). These findings have obvious major public health implications, but the complex realities of host pathogen interactions make confident prediction difficult (Ebert and Bull 2003).",

Individuals vary in how high fever rises during infection, how quickly immune cells are activated, and how much diarrhea is produced for a given level of infection.

Most already know that using codeine to block cough after surgery is likely to result in pneumonia, and an increasing number recognize the utility of fever. However, only a few are thinking about how natural selection shaped the mechanisms that regulate defenses. Such thinking will lead to new studies that provide the evidence we need to make better clinical decisions.

A surprising amount of evidence is consistent with this hypothesis. The early term miscarriage rate is over 60% (Boklage 1990), and siblings tend to be more different in their HLA immunological types than expected by chance. This suggests that other conceptions who received similar HLA genes from both parents may have been selectively lost (Ober et al. 1998). While giving up a conception is inefficient, continuing to support a fetus who will likely succumb to infection is even more so, thus creating a selection force that could shape such a system. Related evidence shows that spouses in small local communities tend to have HLA types more different than expected (Ober et al. 1997). Pheromone cues may guide individuals towards mates who differ sufficiently from themselves (Jacob et al. 2002). That the human female reproductive tract has been shaped to screen defective gametes and concepti is now well supported. That humans detect and choose mates based on immune complementarity is suggested by several studies but not yet definitively confirmed (Loisel et al. 2007).",

Regulation systems, including those that screen for antigens that react with self, were shaped with significant helminth loads on board (Weinstock et al. 2004). New evidence suggests that helminths evolved a capacity to make a protein (ES-62) that down-regulates Type-II immunity that would otherwise attack them (Melendez et al. 2007). Where helminth treatment has been initiated, asthma and Crohn\u2019s disease rates have gone up (Hurtado in press).

The constant tendency for faster replicating cells to displace others is rigidly controlled by systems that regulate cell division and by surveillance systems that kill cells that are not where they belong. The length of telomeres, the bits of DNA that hang from the end of chromosomes, may protect against cancer. Each time a cell divides, the telomere get shorter; when it is gone, the cell dies. However, there is a side effect. Short telomeres also shorten life-span (Blasco 2005).

They are, instead, more like chronic pain or chronic cough, where the problem is dysregulation of a response that can be normal and useful.

However, the measure of environmental effects, the number of severe life events, is crude compared with the sophistication of genetic analyses, especially in light of growing knowledge that low mood can be useful in certain special life circumstances (Brown et al. 1995; Nesse 2000; Heckhausen et al. 2001).

The problem becomes quickly complex, however, because of profound individual genetic variations in vulnerability to substance abuse that interact in complex ways with social environments that vary even from month to month for individuals (Zucker 2006).
