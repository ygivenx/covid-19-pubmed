Previous investigations demonstrated that bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine parainfluenza virus 3 (PI-3), bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1), bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) and bovine adenoviruses (BAV) are the main viral agents included in respiratory infections of ruminant species. Other viruses e.g . rhinoviruses, reoviruses, enteroviruses and bovine coronavirus may also detected in respiratory infections. Although these viral agents play a preliminary role, they generally contribute with other infectious agents like bacteria and Mycoplasma spp. (Valarcher and Haaglund 2006). Maedi and pulmonary adenomatosis are specific diseases of sheep that their symptoms localised in the lungs are developed in a long period of time.",

Thus in the areas where above mentioned infections are detected, an infection rate of these viruses in small ruminants is expected. In a recent study we investigated the seroprevalence of bovine respiratory viruses including BVDV, BHV-1, BRSV, PI-3, BAV-1 and BAV-3 in non-vaccinated cattle population of Marmara region, north-western Turkey. Results showed the presence of all the infections in the region (Ye\u015filba\u011f and G\u00fcng\u00f6r 2008). This region is one of the main dairy production areas of the country, but goat and sheep production is also at a satisfactory level. Hence, as a second step, seroprevalence and distribution of respiratory viruses in small ruminant populations in Marmara region of Turkey was investigated in this study.",

This assay is serotype specific and sensitive for serological screening of viral infections. Serum samples were pre-diluted to be used in VNT in fallowing dilutions: 1:2 for BHV-1 and BRSV; 1:5 for BVDV and PI-3 and 1:10 for BAV serotypes. Fifty microlitres of diluted serum sample was mixed with an equal volume of virus suspension (100TCID50) in 96-well microtitre plate wells as duplicates and consequently incubated in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37\u00b0C. Two hours incubation was applied for BHV-1 while it was 1 hour for the other viruses. Thereafter, MDBK cell suspension (3 \u00d7 105 cells/ml) was added into each well in a volume of 50 \u03bcl. In the VNT performed for anti-BRSV antibodies, Bel-26 cell cultures were previously prepared in 96-well plates. After incubation of virus suspension with diluted serum samples in a transfer plate; cell culture medium in 96-well plates was removed and 100 \u03bcl of virus-serum mixture was inoculated onto cell culture at about 50% of confluence. Test results were evaluated by inverted light microscope after 5-7 days of incubation in 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37\u00b0C. All the viruses used in present study are in cytopathogenic nature, thus, inhibition of virus growth indicated by non-destructed monolayers of cell cultures was evaluated as indicator of virus neutralization. For scoring a sample as positive for the investigated antibodies, both wells used for the same sample were asked to be free of cytopathogenic effect.",

Control of BVDV and BHV-1 is crucial for cattle production. Small ruminants may interfere these attempts. Due to correlation between serological prevalence rates of BRSV, sheep and goat population may also attributed to be source of infection for bovines. Virological studies may be more satisfactorily to clarify the role of these viruses on clinical cases of respiratory disease in small ruminants.",
