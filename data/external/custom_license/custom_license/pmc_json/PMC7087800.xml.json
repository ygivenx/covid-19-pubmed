These infections are usually mild and self-limited and are mostly seen in young children and in adults living close together, such as military recruits. Only rarely does severe infection develop in subjects presumed to be healthy [1, 2]. However, the potential of adenoviral infection to disseminate and cause severe illness in immunocompromised patients, such as those undergoing bone marrow or solid organ transplantation [3, 4] and those with malignant neoplasms [5] and HIV infection [6], has been well described. The mortality in such patient populations is reported to be high. We describe here a case of community-acquired pneumonia caused by adenovirus in a previously healthy patient who was later shown to have stage A chronic lymphatic leukemia (CLL).",

From a prospective study of respiratory virus infections in patients with hematologic malignancies, adenoviral disease was confirmed in 6% of cases, but the complete absence of pneumonia in these patients [5] suggests the complication seen in our patient is rare. Even in cases of severe immunosuppression, such as that due to bone marrow transplantation, adenovirus pneumonia occurs rarely [3].",

However, it is difficult to assess the influence of this comorbidity on the course of the adenoviral infection. In the literature, only two other reports have identified patients with CLL and adenoviral pneumonia, and both patients had a fatal outcome [7, 8]. Nevertheless, it is clear from those two reports, that the patients were far more immunocompromised than ours, with one patient having received multiple courses of chemotherapy and the other having cytopenia at the time of diagnosis [7, 8]. Patients with CLL frequently have low levels of immunoglobulin, as did our patient, and most of the infectious complications they experience are caused by bacteria. Severe viral infections, with the exception of reactivated herpes zoster, are rare in this patient population. Nevertheless, the case presented here reflects the possibility that an unusual viral etiology can play a role in lower respiratory tract infections.",

The manifestations in both organs regressed spontaneously. At presentation and for several days thereafter the patient had significantly elevated levels of C-reactive protein, which suggested a bacterial etiology.

In the present case the clinical presentation was suggestive of atypical pneumonia, and treatment with macrolides and a fluoroquinolone was administered for 3 weeks on suspicion of legionellosis. However, examinations of BAL by culture and PCR did not detect any Legionella species, and repeated serological examinations did not show any rise in antibody titre against legionella antigens; thus, we do not believe this pathogen was associated with our patient\u2019s symptoms.

Since a low level of IgG was detected (secondary to CLL) the patient was given human immunoglobulin, which in itself may have antiviral efficacy.
