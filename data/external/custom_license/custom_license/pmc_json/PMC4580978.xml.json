A stunning example of this in human is the development of learned, or acquired, immunity, which is composed of both humoral and cell-mediated components. Adaptive immunity involves the production of antibodies and immunological memory, but also cell-mediated responses, including the key steps of antigen presentation, antigen binding, co-stimulation and destruction of the foreign body (phagocytosis). More broadly, a network of specialized cells, tissues and organs work together to recognize, respond and remember specific antigens or pathogens. Functionally, each step in the sequence of humoral and cellular immune response involves the activation and deployment of B and T lymphocytes via highly complex signaling pathways. A fully implemented artificial AIS has not been well studied, possibly resulting from the difficulty of controlling programmability and transferring the high-level biological codes into simple artificial modules and physical implementations. In addition, the formation of robust molecular structures and precise control of their temporal dynamics may be other difficulties. However, in the present work, we have hypothesized the feasibility of designing a network of reactions able to function in a manner similar to the vertebrate acquired immune system, using DNA and enzyme as simplified artificial analogs to mimic the activation and deployment of acquired immune response at its most fundamental level.",

To address both questions, in a stepwise manner, we report the construction of a chemical reaction network, termed AIRS, that couples DNA-enzyme cascade interactions, as described above, with DNA strand displacement cascades in which a new product can be activated by the presence of specific initiators15, 16, thus allowing many such reactions to be linked into a cascade and even to form a complex network, in particular one such as adaptive immunity where biological events follow each other sequentially in a rolling fashion.",

A key function is antigen presentation which provides the mechanism for recognition and response. While B cells secrete antibodies, which bind to and tag an antigen, T cells perform the job of attacking target cells. Both T and B cells also have roles in forming memory cells. As shown in Figure 1, we divided this series of events into three steps, including Recognition and Tolerance, Immune Response, and Killing and Memory, under the control of four functional DNA components, including DNA duplexes AM (Antigen Presenting Cell (APC) Mimicry), BM (B Cell Mimicry), PG (Primer Generator, which generates primers for analog antibody) and single-stranded circular DNA CT (Circular Template, which controls the sequence of analog antibody), as well as two enzymes (Phi29 DNA polymerase and SsPI restriction enzyme) able to autonomously and programmably respond to an incoming piece of single-stranded DNA pathogen input (P0) taken from bacterial genome. When no P0 is present, the system is maintained in a steady, balanced state by effective blocking of the functional domains in each component. However, when challenged by P0, these functional domains are activated in a series of steps designed to mimic the three steps noted above.",

Thus, to replicate host defense immune response, we incorporated two B. anthracis genomic sequence fragments (P) in the circular template (CT), resulting in rapid generation of the complementary sequences P*, essentially by enzymatic amplification, using Phi29 DNA polymerase, the replicative polymerase from the Bacillus subtilis phage phi29, and deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (dNTP), to mimic the fast and antibody-specific generation naturally produced by B cells.",

To accomplish this, three infectious states were assumed: original pathogen strand P0 and displacement reaction products (with AM and BM) P1 and P2. Together, these all contain infectious pathogen domain (P). Then, to form the antibody-antigen complex in the system, the P domain in P0, P1 and P2 hybridizes with a large amount of P* and forms stable duplex regions PP*. However, while the vertebrate host immune system uses phagocytosis as a key strategy in removing pathogens, we designed a purely biomechanical method to mimic activation of humoral immune response, i.e., the binding between generated P* and P domain from the pathogen, followed by a restriction enzyme-based step that mimics cell-mediated killing by specifically cutting the \u201cantibody-antigen\u201d duplex. More specifically, this latter step is accomplished when the hybridization of P domain with P* creates an active recognition site for restriction enzyme SsPI, which is extracted from an E. coli strain that carries the cloned and modified (Y98F) SspI gene from the Sphaerotilus species restriction site. In this way, P domain in P0, P1 and P2 can be specifically cut into two fragments with the nucleotide numbers 56 and 15,19 thus losing infectivity.",

These memory cells will trigger much faster immune response upon subsequent exposure to the same pathogen. Therefore, to create a mechanism to mimic the memory function of B cells, we turned to ssDNA TM, which is produced by the displacement reaction between P0 and AM and remains in the system from the first exposure to P0. We also described its catalysis of P0 and BM displacement to release primer quickly, thus triggering a faster RCA reaction creating antibody for the next exposure to the same pathogen sequence. This reaction is defined as entropy-driven because it is one that spontaneously evolves towards thermodynamic equilibrium (Figure S7).18 Without TM, the displacement rate between P0 and BM would be slow by the effective blocking of active domains on BM. However, in the presence of TM, BM can hybridize with TM through its 4-nucleotide toehold (domain 5*) and then release ssDNA side product W1, resulting in a new toehold binding region (domain 3*) for the hybridization between P0 and BM, which is driven forward thermodynamically by the entropic gain of the liberated molecules. Thus, the effect of memory is produced by speeding up the reaction rate between P0 and BM by using the catalytic effect of remaining TM produced by the initial recognition. Thus, by leaving TM as \u201ccatalytic fuel\u201d in the system, memory effect for a specific pathogen input is achieved.",

To examine the precision of the threshold function of AM, we used a F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based method to study the hybridization order of P0 with AM and BM. A fluorophore (FAM) and quencher (DABCYL) pair was coupled in the PG duplex to indicate the released amount of primer for RCA reaction. Fluorescence restoration only occurs if the threshold level of AM is exceeded, after which the reaction proceeds to step 2, immune response, based on strand displacement reactions that can release the quencher-labeled primer strand. Therefore, in the presence of 80 nM AM, 100 nM BM and 100 nM fluorophore/quencher-labeled PG, different concentrations of P0 (from 0 nM to 150 nM) were introduced to the system with fluorescence monitoring at 517 nm. As shown in Figure 2A, the fluorescence restoration exhibited a sharp upturn at the P0 concentration of 80 nM, but little increase while under 80 nM, indicating that the reaction between P0 and BM had begun at the depletion point of AM. In other words, the threshold value of AM to P0 is adjustable by changing the concentration of AM. In this case, the depletion point, or threshold level, of AM was reached at 80 nM, indicating that the reaction between P0 and BM could initiate step 2, which, in human, is the production of antibodies by B lymphocytes. To further confirm this result, fluorescence kinetics of the above system was monitored. Initially, 80 nM AM, 100 nM BM and 100 nM PG were mixed in the buffer, and a small amount of P0 (30 nM) was added. Because of the excess amount of AM and its reaction priority to P0 by the requirements of step 1, slow fluorescence restoration kinetics occurred. However, when more P0 (30 nM each time) was continuously added to the system, a sharp increase (after 90 nM in total) was seen in the fluorescence kinetics, indicating that the reaction could proceed to step 2. Different threshold values were tested by changing the concentrations of AM and BM (Fig. S1). Gel electrophoresis was also used to indicate the order of reactions (Fig. S2). Since the same recognition domain (2-3-4) is shared, similar experimental results were also observed by substituting P0 for another pathogen sequence, P0-SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus genomic DNA and Fig. S3). All assays confirmed the effective threshold function of AM relative to the reaction between BM and P0, thus providing a macroscopic mimicry of the \u201crecognition and tolerance\u201d state of AIS.",

            "text": "Another significant function of AM is to produce catalytic ssDNA TM to facilitate the hybridization reaction between P0 and BM, which, according to Zhang et al.18, can accelerate the hybridization reaction by two to four orders of magnitude. It will be recalled that ssDNA TM is not only important in facilitating the hybridization between P0 and BM, but it is also key to the formation of \u201cmimetic memory cells.\u201d Therefore, to prove the catalytic effect of TM, we continued to use our FRET-based reporting model, as described above. Accordingly, 80 nM AM, 100 nM BM, and 100 nM FAM/DAB-labeled PG were incubated in buffer. Afterwards, 150 nM P0 were added to the system. It should be noted that we used an excess amount of P0 to AM in order to overcome the threshold value. TM is generated in step 1 as a result of the reaction between P0 and AM. Thus P0, when it exceeds the threshold, as set by controlling the concentration of AM, in turn results in a catalytic reaction between excess P0 and TM by entropy that can quickly restore the fluorescence of the system. As a comparison, the same concentration of P0 was directly added to a solution with 100 nM BM and 100 nM FAM/DAB-labeled PG, but no AM. As shown in Figure 2C, measurements of the fluorescence kinetics of the catalyzed reaction exhibited over 500-fold acceleration in contrast to that without catalysis.18, 20 Thus, as explained above, the released TM could serve as specific memory mimicry, resulting in a stronger and faster immune response for the next exposure to the same pathogen. Afterwards, we also confirmed that the quantity of P* generated from enzymatic amplification for hybridization with domain P in P0, P1 and P2 could be determined by the amount of primer, thus making the enzymatic reaction controllable by upstream reactions in steps 1 and 2 (see supplementary materials). In addition, the restriction enzyme-based digestion of the generated \u201cantigen-antibody\u201d complex was studied and shown in the supplementary materials.",

To confirm the tolerance of AIRS, a small amount of P0 (100 nM) was then added to the system, and fluorescence was monitored in real time. We then designed a DNA molecular beacon (MB-R) to report the amount of RCA product fluorescently by using the pathogen B. anthracis genomic sequence P as its loop. MB-R could be opened by the RCA products, i.e., P*, thereby exhibiting fluorescence restoration that represents different amounts of P*. It can be observed from Figure 3A that the fluorescence kinetics is similar to that without P0, confirming that the system is not activated to produce P* when the amount of pathogen is under the level of immune tolerance (i.e., threshold of 200 nM). However, when another 150 nM P0 were added to the system to mimic a second exposure to the same pathogen, the fluorescence restoration showed much faster kinetics behavior, indicating the production of a large amount of P* and successful triggering of immune response. In addition, the faster response during the second exposure also confirmed the memory effect of this system for specific pathogen. If P0-SARS is used as a pathogen input and a molecular beacon (MB-R-SARS) encoded with SARS genomic DNA (P0-SARS) is used as reporter, similar fluorescence response trends are seen, as shown in Figure 3B, indicating that AIRS potentially works for a second pathogen input. We also used a different fluorescence reporting system to indicate the amount of generated P*, which is shown in the supplementary materials (Fig. S10).",

As shown in Figure S14, as long as both pathogen inputs are under the level of immune tolerance (threshold of 300 nM), AIRS is not activated and fluorescence remains unchanged compared to the background signal. However, when the concentrations increase to a level higher than threshold for either one, or both, pathogens, fluorescence is restored, indicating that both pathogen inputs can generate corresponding antibody mimicry when they are mixed together. This confirms that AIRS has the capacity to respond simultaneously to two different pathogen inputs.",

            "text": "To further characterize error-free operation of the AIRS system, we used gel electrophoresis to analyze the final amount of P*. As shown in Figure 4A, only one sharp high molecular-weight band can be seen when the amount of pathogen exceeds the threshold level (100 nM+150 nM), which is consistent with the previous fluorescence result. To study the binding between pathogen input strand (P0) and antibody mimicry strand (P*) in step 3, we modified P0 with a fluorophore (FAM). After the generation of P*, the hybridization between P0 and P* was confirmed to be present, as a high molecular weight band could be seen in the FITC imaging channel (Fig. S13). With further addition of more FAM-labeled P0 (from 1 \u00d7 to 250 \u00d7 excess) to the system, the hybridization between excess P0 and generated P* was still observed, indicating that AIRS could sufficiently bind excess pathogen input strand (P0) by RCA. Finally, we incubated SsPI restriction enzyme (2 U/\u00b5L) together with all other components (200 nM AM, 200 nM BM, 200 nM PG, 50 nM CT, 0.5 U/\u00b5L Phi29 and 250 \u00b5M dNTP). After introducing excess concentration of FAM-labeled P0 (500 nM) to surpass the immune tolerance of the system, the digestion fragment band with FAM modification (56 nt) was discovered under the FITC channel, leading to the conclusion that the pathogen had been successfully digested (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, if P0 is substituted by a double-nucleotide polymorphism input P0-mis, antibody mimicry P* can still be generated with excess concentration of P0-mis. However, the hybridization between P0-mis and P* cannot be digested by the SsPI restriction enzyme, demonstrating that the AIRS system is sensitive to recognition of nucleotide polymorphism of the pathogen input (Fig. S11). AIRS has been designed with two layers of selectivity, making it possible for the system to differentiate P0 from double-nucleotide polymorphism input P0-mis. To explain, the relatively weaker binding ability between P0-mis and P*, when compared to that of P0 and P*, makes the P0-mis -P* duplex less stable. Additionally, P0-mis-P* mismatch duplex cannot form an effective recognition binding site with the restriction enzyme SsPI (AAT-ATT), thereby reducing the enzyme\u2019s digestion rate, which, in turn, results in much less cleavage product from input P0-mis (Fig. S11). In contrast, because the hybridization of P0-SARS with P* creates a recognition binding site identical to that of restriction enzyme SsPI, similar gel electrophoresis results were found (Fig. 4C), again confirming that AIRS can work for different pathogen inputs.",

Moreover, even though the designed system is entirely synthetic, biocompatibility was shown by its ability to of using only biological molecules (DNA/enzyme).
