The concept that human coronaviruses are generally associated with mild respiratory diseases was overturned by the identification in 2003 of SARS coronavirus, which causes a severe and highly lethal disease.3,4 Further investigation of the etiology of community-acquired pneumonia in an adult who was hospitalized in Hong Kong during the outbreak of SARS led to the identification of human coronavirus HKU1,2 which circulates commonly in human population causing respiratory tract illnesses worldwide.6,7,8 Although the mechanism by which SARS coronavirus and the newly identified MERS coronavirus cause severe respiratory diseases is not fully understood, their subversion of innate immunity is thought to contribute substantially to pathogenesis.4,9",

Compared to SARS coronavirus, human coronavirus HKU1 is more frequently associated with less severe disease.6,7,8 It will therefore be of interest to determine whether human coronavirus HKU1 M protein would be able to suppress IFN production. On the other hand, the functional domain in SARS coronavirus M protein required and sufficient for IFN antagonism remains elusive.",

In plasmid pISRE-Luc, the expression of luciferase reporter was driven by IFN-stimulated response elements (ISRE), which are activated by type I IFNs and also bound to IRF3 and IRF7 transcription factors.24,25 For plasmid pIFN\u03b2-Luc, reporter expression directly reflects the transcriptional activity of IFN-\u03b2 promoter. To activate IFN production, we expressed RIG-I, MDA5, MAVS and TBK1 in HEK293 cells. RIG-I and MDA5 are sensors of viral double-stranded RNA.11,15 MAVS is a mitochondrial adaptor protein and TBK1 is the protein kinase that phosphorylates IRF3 and IRF7.1,11 These proteins represent three critical steps in the upstream, midstream and downstream of the intracellular signaling pathway that leads to IFN production. All proteins stimulated transcriptional activity driven by ISRE (Figure 1a\u2013d) and IFN-\u03b2 promoter (Figure 1e\u2013h) in a dose-dependent manner. Consistent with our previous findings,14 SARS coronavirus M protein suppressed the stimulatory effect of RIG-I, MDA5, MAVS and TBK1 on ISRE and IFN-\u03b2 promoter (Figure 1a\u2013h). In stark contrast, human coronavirus HKU1 M protein had no influence on the activity of RIG-I, MDA5, MAVS or TBK1 (Figure 1a\u2013h). Consistently, when we measured the steady-state levels of IFN-\u03b2 transcript in transfected HEK293 cells by real-time RT-PCR, M protein of SARS coronavirus, but not of human coronavirus HKU1, inhibited the IFN-inducing activity of RIG-I, MDA5 and TBK1 in a dose-dependent fashion (Figure 1i\u2013k). Thus, the suppression of IFN production by M protein is specific to SARS coronavirus.",

We constructed an N-linked glycosylation-defective mutant of SARS coronavirus M protein designated M-N4Q and interrogated its IFN-antagonizing activity.

Neither TM2\u2032 nor TM3\u2032 exhibited IFN-antagonizing activity (Figure 5b and c). In further support of the importance of TM1, a chimeric M protein containing TM1 (residues 1\u201338) of SARS coronavirus and the cytoplasmic domain (87\u2013223 residues) derived from human coronavirus HKU1 was equally active as SARS coronavirus M protein in the suppression of IFN production induced by RIG-I or TBK1, whereas another chimera carrying TM1 of human coronavirus HKU1 was totally inactive in this assay (Figure 6a-c).

Neither TM2\u2032 nor TM3\u2032 had the same property (Figure 8a, lanes 5\u201312). In addition, the interaction of TRAF3 with TBK1, IKK\u03b5 and TANK was inhibited in the presence of TM1\u2032 (Figure 8b, lanes 1\u20136), but not TM2\u2032 or TM3\u2032 (Figure 8b, lanes 7\u201310). In light of this, TM1 is both required and probably sufficient for interacting with TRAF3 and other transducer proteins and thereby preventing TRAF3 from engaging its partners such as TBK1, IKK\u03b5 and TANK. Indeed, both SARS coronavirus M protein and its TM1\u2032 mutant colocalized with TRAF3 (Figure 9a\u2013f). However, human coronavirus HKU1 M protein also localized to the Golgi apparatus (data not shown) and colocalized with TRAF3 (Figure 9g\u2013i), but did not impede the interaction of TRAF3 with TANK, TBK1 or IKK\u03b5 (data not shown). Plausibly, Golgi localization and interaction with TRAF3 are required but not sufficient for suppression of IRF3 activation.",

This difference in the TM1 region might be critical in governing the inhibition of TRAF3. SARS coronavirus is known to suppress innate antiviral response at multiple levels leading to a severe disease.4,9 This might be similar to the emerging MERS coronavirus.30,31 In contrast, human coronavirus HKU1 is commonly found in human population and is associated with less severe respiratory illnesses.6,7,8 Accordingly, it might not have the same ability to evade innate immunity. Viral proteins are not well characterized and IFN-antagonizing proteins have not been identified in human coronavirus HKU1.32 It remains to be seen whether the distinct properties of M proteins in the suppression of IFN production could account at least partly for the severity of disease caused by SARS coronavirus and human coronavirus HKU1.",

To test this idea, the coronaviruses in the two groups should be compared more thoroughly for their abilities to induce IFNs and to suppress IFN production and action. Particularly, the IFN-antagonizing property of M proteins from more coronaviruses should be assessed in parallel. Although attempts have been made to culture the virus in primary human ciliated airway epithelial cells and type II alveolar epithelial cells,34,35,36 clinical isolates of human coronavirus HKU1 remain unculturable in most laboratories.

TM1 contains the critical determinants for Golgi localization, for association with RIG-I, TRAF3, TBK1 and IKK\u03b5, and for prevention of TRAF3 from interacting with TANK, TBK1 and IKK\u03b5.

Mechanistically, the perturbation of the interaction of TRAF3 with TANK, TBK1 and IKK\u03b5 by TM1 of SARS coronavirus M protein is more critical in the suppression of IRF3 activation. This could plausibly be mediated by pre-occupation and steric hindrance, but further investigations are required to provide additional support to this model. For example, it will be of interest to see whether artificial fusion of TM1 to TRAF3 might impede its binding with TBK1 and IKK\u03b5 or inhibit its activation of IFN production. Mapping and comparing the TM1- and TBK1-interacting domains in TRAF3 would also shed light on how the binding of TRAF3 with TM1 affects the binding with TBK1. More importantly, a thorough comparison of the TM1 regions of SARS coronavirus and human coronavirus HKU1 will define the critical residues for the suppression of TRAF3 interaction with downstream transducers. Nevertheless, this model of suppression by sequestration and pre-occupation represents a new mechanism for immune evasion, which might also be used by other viral and cellular proteins such as microtubule-associated TRAF3-binding protein MIP-T3, which localizes to the centrosome and cilia and also impedes the formation of functional TRAF3-containing complex.37 Furthermore, our definition of a small TM1 domain that mediates immune evasion will pave the way for rational design and development of new immunosuppressive agents. In this regard, both peptide mimetics and recombinant proteins that mimic the action of TM1 might prove useful.",

HeLa cells were transfected with plasmids expressing TRAF3 and V5-tagged SARS coronavirus M protein (SCV M), its TM1\u2032 mutant or human coronavirus HKU1 M protein (HKU1 M). Cells were then stained for M and TRAF3. Nuclear morphology (blue) was visualized with DAPI. Specific fluorescent signals from V5 and TRAF3 were then merged. Transfected cells in the merged panels are highlighted by arrows. Colocalization appeared yellow. All panels shown are representative of the results of triplicate experiments. Bar=20 \u00b5m.
