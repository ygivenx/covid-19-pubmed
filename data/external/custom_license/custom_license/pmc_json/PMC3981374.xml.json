Ramirez and used not only in alveolar proteinosis but also in status asthmaticus5 and in desquamative interstitial pneumonia2 with good results.The use of multiple segmental or lobar lavage by FOB has been reported in English medical literature in less than 10 cases but often with interesting results.1\u20134,6 Partial lung lavage, performed with bronchoscope has been considered a possibility when WLL is potentially harmful as in the case of severe hypoxemia and when extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is not feasible.7 This option is also indicated for children. Since there is no pediatric-size double-lumen endotracheal tube available,unilateral lung lavage by bronchofiberscope and selective ventilation, with cuffed endotracheal tube, is an alternative.7 Paquet and Karsli also utilized a two-cuffed endotracheal tube for the treatment of a pediatric patient.8 Based on these experience we report a case of a patient with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis and presenting an influenza A H1N1 pneumonia treated and resolved with helping of FOB.",

Arterial blood gas analysis revealed worsening parameters: pH 6.73, PaCO2 170 mmHg,\nPaO2 112 mmHg. The ventilation was modified (increasing PEEP to 20 cmH2O). Improved blood gas values were noted twelve hours later. (pH 7.22, PaCO2 63.5, PaO2 112 with P/F ratio 234). Twenty-four hours later a normal pH was achieved (pH 7.35 PaCO2 50 PaO2 112 );PEEP was reduced (12 cm H2O). Broad spectrum antibiotics (piperacillin +tazobactam 18 g in continuous infusion +levofloxacin 1000 mg every 24 hours) and antimycotical therapy associated with stress doses of Hydrocortisone 300 mg iv. were initiated at the admission. Over the next five days the clinical picture worsened and the PEEP was increased to 18 cm H2O and the patient remained hypercapnic (PaCO2 106 mm Hg with Ph 7.18). She underwent bronchoscopic aspiration and lavage which returned milky, thick fluid from the entire bronchial tree. The Real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of bronchoalveolar lavage sample resulted positive for Influenza A H1N1 virus. The biochemical analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage (a presence of foamy macrophages and elevated lipid index) and electronic microscopy of bronchoalveolar lavage (amorphous material with multi lamellated structure in concentric arrangement) confirmed the concurrence of influenza A H1N1 virus pneumonia with idiopathic alveolar proteinosis. The white blood cells (WBC) count was 3800 with 85% polymorphonuclear leukocytes with relative lymphopenia (3.2%); the hematocrit was 42%, haemoglobin 11.8 g/mL and C-reactive protein (CRP) 20.44 mg/L, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 2058 U/L.

The clinical presentation of PAP varies from asymptomatic (31% of acquired cases) to a more chronic presentation with dyspnoea and cough sometimes accompanied by sputum described as white and gummy or chunky.9 Pulmonary function test usually reveals restrictive lung disease, decreased carbon monoxide diffusion capacity and rarely hypoxemia. Chest CT scan findings are non-specific and often show smooth thickening of sepal lines superimposed on areas of ground-glass opacities, known as crazy-paving.10 The gold standard for PAP diagnosis is open lung biopsy. Bronchoalveolar lavage is usually performed to exclude infection. The classic findings include a milky fluid containing large amounts of granular cellular eosinophilic (proteinaceous) material with morphologically abnormal foamy macrophages filled with PAS-positive intracellular inclusions. When electron microscopy is available, the presence of concentrically laminated phospholipid structures called lamellar bodies can confirm the diagnosis.9,11 Associated infections have been reported in 5\u201320% of PAP cases. The infectious agents include Nocardia, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare, Pneumocystis jirovecii, and cytomegalovirus.11 An association with influenza A has not reported. Single lung lavage by FOB was performed in conscious patients as well as patients under general anaesthesia and mechanical ventilation;7\u201310,12\u201314 in recent years the use of BAL lung lavage has increased; it seems to be effective as whole lung lavage.7,8,12\u201314 It has similar long- term effects when compared with the latter. BAL lung lavage a is well-known and established procedure in primary pulmonary alveolar proteinosis.1,3\u20135,7\u20138,12\u201314 BAL lung lavage was previously used in other pulmonary alveolar disorders.2The only effective treatment of PAP is bronchoalveolar lavage: the procedure is safe and does not require anesthetic support. It is recommended only in milder disease or conversely, in particular severe cases, in which the physiological derangement of WLL would not tolerated by patient or when extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation is not available. Our case report illustrates that extremely severe respiratory failure can be successfully managed with the alternative technique of lobar lung lavage by flexibile fiberoptic bronchoscopy.",
