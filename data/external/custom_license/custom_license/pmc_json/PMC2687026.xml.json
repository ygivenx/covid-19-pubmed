In 1997, a prototype GPHIN system was developed in a partnership between the government of Canada and WHO. The objective was to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of using news media sources to continuously gather information about possible disease outbreaks worldwide and to rapidly alert international bodies of such events. The sources included websites, news wires, and local and national newspapers retrieved through news aggregators in English and French. After the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a new, robust, multilingual GPHIN system was developed and was launched November 17, 2004, at the United Nations.",

It has also been featured in mainstream media publications, such as Wired News and Scientific American, indicating the broad utility of such a system that extends beyond public health practice (24,26). On the basis of usage tracking of HealthMap\u2019s Internet site, we can infer that its most avid users tend to come from government-related domains, including WHO, CDC, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, and other national, state, and local bodies worldwide. Although the question of whether this information has been used to initiate action will be part of an in-depth evaluation, we know from informal communications that organizations (ranging from local health departments to such national organizations as the US Department of Health and Human Services and the US Department of Defense) are leveraging the HealthMap data stream for day-to-day surveillance activities. For instance, CDC\u2019s BioPHusion Program incorporates information from multiple data sources, including media reports, surveillance data, and informal reports of disease events and disseminates it to public health leaders to enhance CDC\u2019s awareness of domestic and global health events (27).",

Through this multistream approach, HealthMap casts a unified and comprehensive view of global infectious disease outbreaks in space and time. Fully automated, the system acquires data every hour and uses text mining to characterize the data to determine the disease category and location of the outbreak. Alerts, defined as information on a previously unidentified outbreak, are geocoded to the country scale with province-, state-, or city-level resolution for select countries. Surveillance is conducted in several languages, including English, Spanish, Russian, Chinese, and French. The system is currently being ported to other languages, such as Portuguese and Arabic.",

Although information relating to infectious disease outbreaks is collected, not all information has relevance to every user. The system designers are especially concerned with limiting information overload and providing focused news of immediate interest. Thus, after a first categorization step into locations and diseases, a second round of category tags is applied to the articles to improve filtering. The primary tags include 1) breaking news (e.g., a newly discovered outbreak); 2) warning (initial concerns of disease emergence, e.g., in a natural disaster area; 3) follow-up (reference to a past outbreak); 4) background/context (information on disease context, e.g., preparedness planning); and 5) not disease-related (information not relating to any disease [2\u20135 are filtered from display]). Duplicate reports are also removed by calculating a similarity score based on text and category matching. Finally, in addition to providing mapped content, each alert is linked to a related information window with details on reports of similar content as well as recent reports concerning either the same disease or location and links for further research (e.g., WHO, CDC, and PubMED).",

Additonally, EpiSPIDER automatically converted the topic and location information of the reports into RSS feeds. Usage tracking showed, initially, that the RSS feeds were more popular than the maps. Transforming reports to a semantic online format (W3C Semantic Web) makes it possible to combine emerging infectious disease content with similarly transformed information from other Internet sites such as the Global Disaster Alert Coordinating System (GDACS) website (www.gdacs.org). The broad effects of disasters often increase illness and death from communicable diseases, particularly where resources for healthcare infrastructure have been lacking (28,29).

By using askMEDLINE (30), EpiSPIDER also provides context-sensitive links to recent and relevant scientific literature for each ProMED-mail report topic. After EpiSPIDER extracts the previously described information, it automatically transforms it to other formats, e.g., RSS, keyhole markup language (KML; http://earth.google.com/kml), and JavaScript object notation (JSON, a human-readable format for representing simple data structures; www.json.org). Publishing content using those formats enables the semantic linking of ProMED-mail content to country information and facilitates EpiSPIDER\u2019s redistribution of structured data to services that can consume them. Continuing along this transformation chain, the SIMILE Exhibit API (http://simile.mit.edu) that consumes JSON-formatted data files enables faceted browsing of information by using scatter plots, Google Maps, and timelines.",

In contrast, HealthMap\u2019s strategy is to rely on open-access news aggregators (e.g., GoogleNews and Moreover) and curated sources (e.g., ProMED and EuroSurveillance).

HealthMap provides a geographic and temporal panorama of ongoing epidemics through an open-access user interface. It automatically filters out the reports that do not correspond to breaking alerts. The remaining alerts are prepared for display (timecodes and geocodes as well as disease category and data source) to allow faceted browsing and are linked to other information sources (e.g., the Wikipedia definition of the disease). These data are also provided as daily email digests to users interested in specific diseases and locations. Although GPHIN and HealthMap provide their own user interface, EpiSPIDER explores conventional formats for reports, adding time-coding, geo-coding, and country metadata for automatic integration with other information sources and versatile browsing by using existing open-source software. These reports are displayed under the name of Web Exhibits and include, for example, a mapping and a timeline view of the reports and a scatter plot of the alerts with respect to the originating country\u2019s human development index and gross domestic product per capita.",

Also, all 3 systems are inherently prone to noise because most of the data sources they use or plan to use (Figure) for surveillance are not verified by public health professionals, so even if the system is supervised by a human analyst, it might still generate false alerts. False alerts need to be mitigated because they might have substantial undue economic and social consequences.
