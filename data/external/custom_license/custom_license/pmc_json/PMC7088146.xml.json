They were initially considered to have little medical significance because they were only isolated in subjects with upper respiratory tract infections (RTIs), mainly common colds [1]. However, the more recent availability of modern molecular methods of viral screening [2] has led to them being identified in the nasopharyngeal secretions of subjects with bronchitis, bronchiolitis and pneumonia, and it has been demonstrated that they are frequently associated with asthma exacerbations [3\u20138].",

As they are shed in respiratory secretions for several days after the clinical resolution of an acute episode of RTI, their presence in the nasopharynx of a subject with acute RTI may only be due to prolonged shedding after a previous infection and is not proof that they caused the new disease [9\u201312]. Knowing the importance of RVs is critical for deciding the need for new preventive and therapeutic strategies, particularly in the case of lower RTIs. It has recently been suggested that simultaneously determining nasopharyngeal RV load and identifying RV viremic cases could differentiate the respiratory infections in which RV is the real causative agent [12]. However, the published data are few and partially discordant, and no study has yet evaluated the two variables together [13\u201320]. Moreover, there are no published data concerning the possible relationships between RV nasopharyngeal viral load, viremia and the severity of RV-associated disease.",

The exclusion criteria were symptom onset more than 24 h before and chronic conditions increasing the risk of respiratory infections, including premature birth; chronic disorders of the pulmonary or cardiovascular systems; chronic metabolic diseases; neoplasia; kidney or liver dysfunction; hemoglobinopathies; immunosuppression; diseases requiring long-term aspirin therapy; and genetic or neurological disorders. The diagnoses of RTIs (upper RTI: common cold and pharyngitis; lower RTI: bronchitis, bronchiolitis, infectious wheezing and pneumonia) were based on well-defined clinical and laboratory criteria [21]. All of the children with lower RTI underwent chest radiography, and the radiograph was evaluated by an independent expert radiologist who confirmed pneumonia using the World Health Organisation (WHO) criteria for the standardised interpretation of pediatric chest radiographs for a diagnosis of pneumonia [22].",

Nasopharyngeal swab was used because it is the simplest sampling method for the identification of respiratory viruses without any reduction in diagnostic performance in comparison to nasopharyngeal aspiration and nasal washes. Moreover, it has the advantages of improved standardization in different age groups and between operators, and better acceptability in a wider range of settings [23]. One swab per patient was collected. Plasma was obtained by centrifuging an aliquot of 10 mL of whole blood at 2,500 rpm for 15 min, some of which was used to determine RV viremia, and the rest for the other laboratory variables, including a white blood cell (WBC) count, the measurement of C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and the preparation of blood cultures.",

In terms of clinical relevance, we did not find any positive correlation between nasopharyngeal RV load and the type of respiratory infection diagnosed, but the children who were positive for RV viremia simultaneously had a significantly higher viral load and more severe disease, thus suggesting that the former is a prerequisite for viremia and is more frequently associated with greater clinical involvement. The lack of a correlation between nasopharyngeal RV load and the severity of lower RTIs has been previously reported by van Elden et al. in adults with asthma [13]. However, these data and those collected by us are different from the data published by other authors [14, 16]. Gerna et al. found that RVs were mainly associated with lower RTIs (in the absence of other viral agents) and wheezing in immunocompetent pediatric patients with nasopharyngeal loads of \u22656 log10 RNA copies/mL, whereas lower values represented a probable carrier state in immunocompromised asymptomatic adult patients [14]. Similarly, Takeyama et al. found a significant positive correlation between nasopharyngeal RV load and disease severity in patients aged \u226511 months, but not in younger patients [16]. Finally, Kieninger et al. studied the bronchoalveolar lavages of patients with severe chronic respiratory disease and healthy controls, and found that patients with cystic fibrosis or bronchiectasis had higher RV loads in respiratory secretions than controls, particularly during pulmonary exacerbations, whereas asthmatic patients had similar loads to those measured in healthy subjects [19]. On the basis of our findings, it is possible that these discrepancies may be at least partially due to the different number of viremic patients enrolled in each study, although none of the previous studies simultaneously evaluated nasopharyngeal RV load and RV viremia.",

Current molecular methods are significantly more sensitive and, contrary to expectations, have revealed that viremia is relatively common in children with RV infection and is usually associated with a more severe course of RV disease. Xatzipsalti et al. detected RV in the blood of 11.4 % of 88 children with upper and lower RTIs, particularly during the early course of disease, and found that it was mainly associated with a significant increase in moderate or severe exacerbations of acute asthma [17].

This finding, although it does not exclude the possible coexistence of a bacterial co-infection due to the poor sensitivity of culture in the identification of bacteremic cases [32], supports the hypothesis that RV was the cause of the disease.
