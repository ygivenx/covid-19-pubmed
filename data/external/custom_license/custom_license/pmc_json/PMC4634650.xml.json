Many veterinary laboratories have already embraced generic AI RRT PCRs that detect all sixteen H subtypes of influenza A, typically through amplifying within the highly conserved M gene, and also as specific assays for AIVs of H5 and H7 subtypes.\n28\n While public health institutions have recently described RRT PCRs for the detection of H1N1v in the context of the current human pandemic,\n29\n, \n30\n, \n31\n, \n32\n in this study, we describe and validate similar approaches for the detection of H1N1v in pigs. Full genome sequence analysis of the current H1N1v reveals the virus to be putatively of swine origin.\n4\n, \n5\n Segment 7, which includes the matrix (M) gene that encodes the matrix M1 and M2 proteins, appears to be of Eurasian SIV origin, while segment 4, which encodes the H1 haemagglutinin (HA), is related to American classical SIV H1 genes.\n4\n, \n5\n This study outlines the adaptation of an existing M gene RRT PCR assay for the generic detection of SIVs and H1N1v, plus a novel RRT PCR that amplifies within the H1 gene for the specific detection of H1N1v in European pigs.",

The sequence for the forward M gene RRT PCR primer and the probe remains highly conserved for most isolates (Table 5).

This influenced the design of the \u201cperfect match\u201d M gene RRT PCR \u201cRev\u2010mod\u201d primer for H1N1v detection, which is located at the same corresponding position as the \u201cM\u2212124 R\u201d primer for the \u201cavian\u201d M gene RRT PCR (Table 5).",

The 10\u2010fold dilution series from A/California/07/09 (H1N1v) was also tested by the \u201cH1\u2010118\u201d RRT PCR. The detection limit corresponded to a viral titre (pre\u2010RNA extraction) of 1 \u00d7 101 EID50/ml for the \u201cperfect match\u201d M gene and \u201cH1\u2010118\u201d RRT PCRs, which typically registered at Ct values 34\u201336. When a dilution series of quantified T7 in vitro RNA transcripts were tested, the detection limit of the \u201cperfect match\u201d M gene RRT PCR at these Ct values was 200 RNA copies and 2000 RNA copies for the H1N1v and H3N2 targets, respectively. This discrepancy in sensitivity may relate to differences in the M gene reverse primer binding sequence for the two influenza A viruses (Table 5), where A/swine/England/742104/95 (H3N2) has two mismatches with the \u201cperfect match\u201d M gene RRT PCR \u201cRev\u2010mod\u201d primer.

These observations indicated optimised RRT PCR protocols.\n42\n However, the efficiency of the \u201cavian\u201d M gene RRT PCR fell outside these limits when testing both these viruses.

In this study, we have investigated the application of the \u201cavian\u201d M gene RRT PCR,\n38\n but sequence differences observed in the M gene of H1N1v isolates also prompted investigation of two new variations of the original M gene RRT PCR. The original \u201cavian\u201d M gene RRT PCR reverse primer (M\u2212124 R),\n38\n with four nucleotide differences to H1N1v viruses (Table 5), clearly resulted in a significantly lower sensitivity when testing H1N1v laboratory isolates (Table 1). Consequently, the original avian M gene RRT PCR\n38\n should not be used for detection of H1N1v, and this deficiency of the diagnostic test needed to be addressed. Among the three variants of the M gene RRT PCR that were evaluated, the \u201cperfect match\u201d with the revised reverse primer (\u201cRev\u2010mod\u201d) provided the most sensitive results for many of the European SIVs (1, 2). M gene sequence analysis showed that the \u201cRev\u2010mod\u201d primer compensated for two or three nucleotide mismatches in the corresponding region of the M gene from contemporary European SIVs (Table 5). However, experiments with T7 in vitro RNA transcripts corresponding to the amplified M gene region of A/swine/England/742104/95 (H3N2) suggested that the \u201cperfect match\u201d M gene RRT PCR may not be maximally sensitive for detection of all contemporary European SIVs, which again reflected sequence mismatches with the \u201cRev\u2010mod\u201d primer. Nevertheless, the \u201cperfect match\u201d M gene RRT PCR demonstrated successful detection of contemporary European SIVs in archived tissues from infected pigs (Table 2), plus five specimens (four nasal swabs from UK herds and one archived tissue, collected in 2009, highly likely to be H1N2), that were negative by VI (6, 7). Importantly, the \u201cperfect match\u201d RRT PCR successfully detected both H1N1v laboratory isolates (Table 1) and clinical specimens from pigs that had been infected with H1N1v in the field (Table 3) and experimentally (Table 4).\n36\n The \u201ccombo\u201d M gene RRT PCR assay was slightly less sensitive for detection of contemporary European SIVs and H1N1v (1, 2).",

The other four discrepant results were VI\u2010negative swabs collected by UK Regional Laboratories during summer 2009 that were shown to be likely H1N2 SIV positives, so affirming these \u201cperfect match\u201d M gene RRT PCR results. This inferred a greater sensitivity for the RRT PCRs compared to VI. As regards \u201cperfect match\u201d M gene RRT PCR testing of the 116 swine tissues, however, there were four discrepant results, where a diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 93\u00b76% and 98\u00b76%, respectively, were observed (Table 7a).

Three of the 31 tissues from SIV\u2010positive pigs were negative (No Ct) by the \u201cperfect match\u201d M gene RRT PCR (Table 2). It was speculated that at the time of the original submission these pigs may have been classified as SIV positive based on a VI result from another localised tissue portion or clinical specimen that was no longer available for the current validation. It was also observed that only 4 of 31 tissues obtained from SIV\u2010positive pigs were positive when VI was repeated through two egg passages during the current validation (Table 2). This may be a consequence of the long\u2010term storage history of these archived tissues, where infectivity may have been compromised by repeated freeze\u2010thawing, or even because of limiting VI to two egg passages. One archived tissue from an SIV\u2010negative pig collected in 2009 was positive by \u201cperfect match\u201d M gene RRT PCR, negative by \u201cH1\u2010118\u201d RRT PCR and VI (Table 7), but additional investigations suggested that this was a non\u2010viable H1N2 specimen.",

This included evaluation of a generic approach to detect known SIVs as well as H1N1v. This was achieved for European SIVs by the \u201cperfect mach\u201d M gene RRT PCR assay, which sensitively detected all known types of European SIVs in addition to H1N1v. However, it was noted that contemporary Irish SIVs may be the exception to this observation in Europe (Table 1). Testing of recent Irish SIVs by the various M gene RRT PCR assays suggests that the original \u201cavian\u201d M gene RRT PCR may be the more sensitive approach (Raleigh and Flynn, Personal Communication). In the case of North American SIVs, the \u201ccombo\u201d M gene RRT PCR assay was most sensitive for generic detection, and this method was slightly less sensitive for the detection of H1N1v than the \u201cperfect match\u201d M gene RRT PCR assay.

Validation of the generic and differential RRT PCR assays involved not only testing of a range of laboratory\u2010grown influenza A virus isolates, but also crucially included testing of the same set of clinical specimens from pigs infected with SIVs or H1N1v. Primers and probe for the differential \u201cH1\u2010118\u201d RRT PCR were deliberately designed within the relatively conserved HA2 region of the HA gene of H1N1v. However, continuing molecular evolution the HA gene may yet result in nucleotide changes within these primer and probe\u2010binding sequences. Vigilance for relevant nucleotide changes by sequencing the HA genes of new H1N1v swine isolates may identify potential future modifications to the \u201cH1\u2010118\u201d RRT PCR.",
