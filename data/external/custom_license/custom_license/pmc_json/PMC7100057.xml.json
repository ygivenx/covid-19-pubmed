            "text": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of lower respiratory tract infections such as bronchiolitis and bronchopneumonia, as well as hospitalizations in children aged <2 years [1]. RSV infections led to the intermediate or intensive care admission of approximately 1\u20132 % of each annual birth cohort in Switzerland [2]. In a national registry in France, 467 young children hospitalized for bronchiolitis from 24 pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) were reviewed [3]. Seventy-six percent of them were RSV-positive. Over one-third of these children required non-invasive ventilation and/or mechanical ventilation, and six infants died. A single-center study in Hong Kong found that 1.5 % of RSV-related hospitalizations required PICU support, which accounted for 2.4 % of annual PICU admissions. RSV exceeded influenza, parainfluenza, and other respiratory viruses as the most common viral pathogens in the PICU of a regional hospital in Hong Kong [4, 5]. Infants with underlying cardiopulmonary compromise such as surgical congenital cardiac disease and infants born prematurely with chronic lung disease are considered to be more susceptible to RSV infection, with resultant increased mortality and morbidity.",

            "text": "Although no RSV vaccine is available, two products have been approved for passive immunization against RSV infections: RSV immunoglobulin (RSV-IGIV), prepared from donors possessing high serum titers of RSV-neutralizing antibody, and palivizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against the fusion protein of RSV [6, 7]. These effective treatments are expensive and usually given to at-risk infants during the winter months when RSV infection is more prevalent. However, seasonality may pose a problem in subtropical and tropical climates. Among Asian cities, Lee et al. [8] reported a biennial pattern of RSV-related hospitalization in Taiwan, whereas a retrospective study of RSV cases in a PICU in Hong Kong did not identify any definite seasonality [5]. Our PICU study suggested younger age, bacterial co-infections, history of chronic lung disease, acyanotic heart disease, and neurodevelopmental conditions (e.g., mental retardation, cerebral palsy, neuromuscular diseases) to be risk factors for severe RSV infection [5]. The medical costs for managing RSV-infected children with underlying diseases are high in our region [8]; thus, any prophylactic measures against RSV are potentially cost-saving. Nonetheless, the above two options of RSV prophylaxis have not yet been introduced among public hospitals in Hong Kong, mainly due to the unavailability of data regarding their cost-effectiveness in southern Chinese children. Despite this, the local Hospital Authority approved the subsidization of palivizumab prophylaxis to high-risk groups from 2012. The aim of this study was to describe features of RSV-positive children who required PICU admission, as well as to identify factors associated with mortality and duration of PICU stay in Hong Kong before the introduction of RSV prophylaxis to the region.",

Two to three coordinators from all eight PICUs, with a total of 44 beds, participated in data retrieval. The total numbers of RSV-positive patients aged <18 years in participating hospitals during the review period were retrieved from hospitals\u2019 microbiology databases and RSV-associated PICU admissions were identified from both computerized auditing systems and PICU databases of participating departments. The respective data in one of the hospitals were previously reported [4]. The case records of all RSV-positive children hospitalized in these PICUs during the study period were reviewed. RSV was detected using direct immunofluorescence testing on respiratory samples (nasopharyngeal aspirate, tracheal aspirate, or bronchoalveolar lavage) and/or viral culture. The results of all other bacterial cultures on respiratory specimens, urine, mucous membranes, cerebrospinal fluid, and blood were also recorded. The coordinators of participating PICUs recorded patients\u2019 demographic and clinical data anonymously using a common data collection form.

Prior sick contact, presence of older siblings, neurodevelopmental conditions, chromosomal and genetic diseases, and bacterial co-infections were associated with RSV-associated mortality.

Table 4 illustrates the relationship between the duration of PICU admission and different personal and clinical factors.

Chronic lung disease was a risk factor for longer RSV-associated PICU admission in Hong Kong, which was found in another PICU study of 89 RSV-infected infants younger than 2 years old [14]. Other risk factors reported in that study included congenital heart diseases, airway abnormalities, and non-cardiac congenital malformations. Purcell and Fergie [13] identified, through a retrospective chart review of 3,308 patients discharged with a diagnosis of RSV lower respiratory tract infection, that history of prematurity, congenital heart disease, and neurologic disease were risk factors for longer hospital stay. In another study, male sex, lower body weight, and higher viral load on any day were independent predictors of longer duration of hospitalization in American children [17]. However, the authors did not report data specifically for RSV-associated PICU stay. DeVincenzo et al. [18] prospectively studied 141 previously healthy and naturally RSV-infected children, and reported that congenital anomaly, lower weight on admission, and higher nasal RSV load were associated with longer hospitalization, respiratory failure, and requirement for PICU admission.",

            "text": "Our results cast doubt on the case selection for RSV preventive programs. In the initial randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, palivizumab prophylaxis resulted in lower rate and shorter duration of RSV-related hospitalization and less PICU admissions among children with prematurity (\u226435 weeks) or bronchopulmonary dysplasia [7]. A meta-analysis suggested that prophylactic administration of both palivizumab and RSV-IGIV reduced RSV-related hospitalization and PICU admission [6]. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines recommended a targeted approach for RSV prophylaxis based on risk factors such as prematurity, as well as chronic lung and congenital heart diseases [19]. This guideline was set to reduce RSV-related hospitalization instead of the more serious outcomes such as mortality and PICU admissions associated with RSV infection. The majority (70.2 %) of RSV-infected children being admitted to the PICU had no underlying medical illness, and over 88 % of all PICU admissions would not qualify for RSV prophylaxis according to the Canadian guideline [20]. A number of studies yielded similar findings among children from different western countries [2, 14, 21, 22]. Besides, we identified chronic lung disease to be an independent risk factor for longer PICU stay, supporting the importance of including this medical condition in the relevant guidelines. Nonetheless, the lack of a significant association between serious RSV outcomes and all other known risk factors such as prematurity and congenital heart diseases challenged the validity of such a risk stratification approach. In addition, RSV prophylaxis should be administered not only to infants because only two of our eight death cases were below 1 year of age. Lastly, a nationwide surveillance of 1,568 RSV infections from 14 German pediatric hospitals revealed that patients with neuromuscular impairment were at much higher risks for PICU admissions, mechanical ventilation, and mortality [15]. Our data also suggested neurodevelopmental conditions to be a risk factor for RSV-associated mortality, although such an association was not confirmed following multivariate analysis. Overall, these observations strongly imply that the decision algorithm of RSV prophylaxis should not be restricted only to high-risk patients, as defined by prematurity and premorbid cardiopulmonary diseases.",

Substantial variation in the timing of community outbreaks of RSV disease from year to year exists within and between communities in the same year, even in the same region. The overall pattern of RSV outbreaks usually begins in November or December, peaks in January or February, and ends by the end of March or some time in April. The RSV-associated PICU admissions in Hong Kong (Fig. 1) appeared to follow a similar seasonality pattern. Nonetheless, RSV seasonality patterns vary and may occur throughout the year in equatorial countries. Among Asian countries, a seasonal peak was observed for RSV in September\u2013December in Malaysia and Korea [24, 25]. RSV was detected most frequently in the fall and winter, but continued at a lower level throughout the year in India [26], whereas RSV infections started to increase in the early winter and declined in the spring in Japan [27]. There are inconsistent data on RSV seasonality in Asian countries. A previous single-center PICU study of RSV cases in Hong Kong failed to identify any definite seasonality [5], whereas a Taiwanese study found a biennial pattern of RSV-related hospitalization which peaked in the spring and fall [8].",

            "text": "This study has a number of limitations. Firstly, this retrospective study found bacteria in blood or tracheal aspirate in 14 (11.9 %) episodes of PICU admissions. Bacterial co-infection was present in three of our eight death cases (Table 3). Two recent studies in Asia also reported bacterial co-infections to be associated with severe RSV infections [11, 28]. The presence of bacteria in tracheal aspirate might indicate true infection or colonization, but infection biomarkers such as peripheral leucocyte count, lactate dehydrogenase, and C-reactive protein, which were associated with severe RSV infection [16], were not recorded in the case notes from most of our patients. This territory-wide surveillance of severe RSV infections relied on the retrospective collection of patient data. Our study was, thus, liable to recall and sampling biases. Although our coordinators tried their best to identify eligible PICU cases through different databases, we could not exclude the possibility of missing patients from any of the eight participating units. Besides, this multicenter study cannot evaluate the relationship between RSV-associated mortality and RSV viral load and genotypes because most hospitals did not archive respiratory samples or RSV isolates for future research purposes. In addition, our group, as well as many others, reported a number of emerging respiratory viruses such as human coronaviruses, metapneumovirus, and rhinoviruses to be important causes of severe respiratory tract infections in young children [29\u201333]. Patients co-infected with RSV and another virus might have more severe disease, but the present study did not investigate possible co-infections in our PICU patients.",
