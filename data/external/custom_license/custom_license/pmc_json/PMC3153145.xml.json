Since 2003, outbreaks of HPAI A(H5N1) have occurred among poultry in Asia, Europe and Africa, and human infections with this subtype are continuing [1]. The consequences have worsened with 382 infected human cases and 241 deaths as of April, 2008 [2]. Millions of avian species have been lost by culling, imposing a huge economical burden on developing countries.",

Twenty four samples gave negative results by both methods. Only one sample, which was negative with RT-LAMP, gave an unclear positive (+/\u2212) result with RT-PCR, but was confirmed as positive by real-time RT-PCR (Table 3).

An RT-LAMP assay is a simple diagnosis tool in which the reaction is carried out in a single tube by mixing the buffer, primers, reverse transcriptase, and DNA polymerase and incubating the mixture at 62.5\u00b0C for 60 minutes in a regular laboratory water bath or heat block. The results can be detected by naked-eye observation. However, applying the RT-LAMP method to A(H5N1) influenza virus identification faces difficulties such as the rapid genetic changes of the virus. Because the RT-LAMP primer set consists of six primers that recognize eight distinct regions on the target gene, new strains of A(H5N1) virus with a number of mismatches may emerge easily. This could be the reason why the sensitivity of the RT-LAMP assay is not consistant among the strains of A(H5N1) virus. Hence, the sequences of the primers should be updated frequently.",

These data (with clade 1 and 2.3 of H5 viruses) and the alignment showing the very limited number of mismatches with clade 2.1 and 2.2 (Table 4) suggest that our LAMP primers can be used widely and effectively with all circulating A(H5N1) viruses.",

Although PFU titer indicates a functional measurement rather than a quantitive method, higher detection limits of 0.1 or 1 PFU were obtained, and almost all of the viruses were 2007 isolates, which have re-emerged since November 2005. Two strains that showed lower sensitivity by our RT-LAMP method also belonged to that group. This suggests that the genotypes of circulating A(H5N1) influenza viruses have changed and that the sensitivity of the RT-LAMP method was reduced even though the assay has been updated this time. Analysis of genetic changes in A(H5N1) viruses and continuous upgrading of the primers may be needed in the near future. Current examinations on human and avian clinical samples in Northern Vietnam from late 2007 until March 2008 showed that our RT-LAMP primers had high sensitivity and specificity to those strains compared to RT-PCR and viral isolation. The evolution analysis of updated A(H5N1) viruses has characterized Vietnam\u2019s strains belonging to subclade 2.3.4 [13], and the sequence alignment of these strains shows that the target region for our RT-LAMP is still well conserved. Thus we predict that our primers will work well on new A(H5N1) viruses from Vietnam.",
