Since laboratory confirmation of an episode of ARI is not systematically undertaken in most health care systems, active surveillance systems have to be created to ascertain a sufficient number of cases to yield high quality data. So far, most systems have only focused on a very limited number of pathogens or a limited age range of children and have been used under circumstances in which the denominator of the investigation remained unclear or was not sufficiently characterized. Since budgets are limited, active surveillance systems have to be limited in size. Different segments of the pediatric population such as hospitalized children, outpatients or population cohorts can be investigated. Until recently, several very different laboratory techniques and cell lines for different types of bacteria and viruses, respectively, had to be used to cover most of the known ARI pathogens [13, 29].",

It was active in the form and size described here until the end of June 2006, a 10-year period. Since the calendar year is an unsuitable time frame for ARI, an epidemiological year (ey) was defined as July to the end of June the following year. An even ey starts with July of an even calendar year (e.g., 2004/2005) and an uneven ey with July of an uneven calendar year (e.g., 2005/2006). In three defined regions, all hospitals treating children were included to form an epidemiological recruitment system (ERS) for population-based analysis: north\u2013University Children\u2019s Hospital Kiel, Municipal Hospitals Kiel and Flensburg; mid\u2013University Children\u2019s Hospital Mainz; south\u2013University Children\u2019s Hospital Freiburg and Municipal Hospital Freiburg. The University Children\u2019s Hospital Mainz serves as a third-degree referral center as well as a municipal hospital. Pediatric offices in each region were included. They chose one day of the week in which they had to enroll all patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria. Included were all LRI and complicated ARI (Fig. 1). The same categories were applied as in earlier reports [35].\n\n",

The size of the system was limited by the financial resources available.

Ascertainment of NPA in our system was clearly related to age and increased with younger age. This biased the results toward pathogens related to a younger age, as the sample was dominated by younger age as 86.9% of the patients were recruited in hospital. This can be seen by the far right skewing of the age distributions (see medians and means given). Young age is a known risk factor for hospitalization [5].

After changing the primers from the F-gene to the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase gene, sensitivity reached the desired level [25]. Delineation between EV and RV is difficult since both viruses are closely related, and therefore some misjudgment could have occurred. This, however, should not have compromised the interpretation considerably, since the two viruses are closely related. Data from Finland demonstrated that EV is genetically more closely related to group B RV than group A is to group B RV, and the new name enterorhinovirus was proposed to indicate that the distinction is artificial [17].",

A preponderance of RSV together with MPV as found by the group in Liverpool in severe infections could not be confirmed by our data [28]; however, the detailed clinical data are still under evaluation. Length of time of persistence of a given pathogen in the host and a less severe clinical course (outpatients) increased the probability of acquiring a second pathogen or a co-infection before referral for medical treatment. So far, the chance of a co-infection appears more stochastical than representative of a specific relationship between two pathogens.

Climatic factors or alternating subtypes are an unlikely explanation for alternating early and late seasons. An interesting explanation would be the interference of other viruses such as parainfluenza types 1 and 2 as mentioned by Glezen [4]. Our discovery of MPV as the major competitor of RSV further substantiates this hypothesis. For viruses with a distinct rhythmicity, clinically important predictions can currently be made at least for RSV, e.g., regarding curtailing passive immunization with palivizumab [34]. During the last 7 years, we were able to predict the onset of RSV correctly. That RSV in some years does not go into an epidemiological eclipse was also observed in coastal areas of the United States [7]. Whether sporadic positive samples for epidemic viruses can be found in the population depends on the sample size investigated and the age range of the surveillance system. Most recently, adult chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients have been considered as a reservoir for RSV [37]. In addition, premature infants excrete the virus over many months.",

Incorrectly assigned data regarding a high burden of disease for Mpn and Cpn implied a widespread macrolide use in pediatrics in Germany. This had severe consequences for medical practice, since macrolide-resistance in pneumococci is increasing to worrying proportions of over 35% of children under 5 years in Germany [26]. Arguments that the m-RT-PCR is not sensitive enough or that NPA is an unsuitable sample for detecting Cpn as an intracellular pathogen within epithelial cells, which are present in lower numbers in NPA compared to swab samples, can be refuted [35]. In the validation process, the 9v PCR was comparable to other PCRs and standard techniques [25].",

Ro, which can be estimated as the quotient of life expectancy divided by average age of first infection, was the highest in RSV and PIV3. The lower the attack rate per year and the wider the interepidemic interval, the higher the median age. The \u201csubtype phenomenon\u201d described earlier [35], refers to IVA and IVB, when children become older with a nonprotective immunity because the involved strains have drifted far apart and therefore a potential cross-protection does not occur [1]. This would imply an effect similar to being infected initially with a stable virus at a later age. It is most likely true of all ARI pathogens that first infections are more likely to be severe ARI or LRI than infections later in life when the host has already experienced previous infections with the pathogen and upper ARI become more likely. The fact that the median age of inpatients for Mpn and Cpn was similar to outpatients alludes also to the influence of the attack rate and interepidemic interval and possibly to the immune-enhancement conferred by earlier infections, a well-described phenomenon in Mpn infections [2].",
