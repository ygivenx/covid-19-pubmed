Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) is the fourth human coronavirus identified and is mostly related to HCoV-229E with 65% sequence identity [13]. HCoV-NL63 has been shown to be a worldwide pathogen responsible for upper and lower RTI [1\u20133, 6, 9, 11, 12]. This virus could be detected in 2\u20138.8% of nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) from patients with respiratory tract diseases [1, 6]. Infection with HCoV-NL63 occurs mainly in winter seasons in temperate countries, and peaks in summer in Hong Kong [3]. This study is aimed to understand the seasonal distribution and clinical manifestations of HCoV-NL63 infection in children in Taiwan.",

Apparently, HCoV-NL63 is largely a respiratory tract pathogen, capable of inducing upper and lower RTI, with symptoms considered to be more severe than those caused by HCoV 229E or HCoV OC43 [1]. In this study, we prospectively studied the role of HCoV-NL63 in Taiwanese children hospitalized due to respiratory tract infection. Among the 539 patients, seven cases of HCoV-NL63 infection were identified. Proportionally, 1.3% of children with RTI were infected with HCoV-NL63 in the study period. This rate is lower than those reported for other countries, which ranged from 2\u20138.8% [1\u20133, 6, 9, 11, 12]. However, this study recruited only admission cases and would miss children with mild symptoms that were not admitted. Indeed, HCoV-NL63 may be more prevalent in the out-patient than the in-patient group [14]. The majority of infected children were under 3 years old and all male in gender, which is similar to what has been reported previously [1\u20133, 6, 9, 11, 12]. Dual infections were frequent (43%) in this study. Van der Hoek et al. [14] described a significant difference between the HCoV-NL63 viral loads of singly infected and co-infection groups; however, we did not have similar observations in this study (p = 0.229). Whether dual infection would lead to more severe clinical manifestations needs further study.",

Phylogenetic analysis of partial spike gene showed two lineages of HCoV-NL63 in the world; however, our study could not answer whether there was cocirculation of these two variants in 2004 and 2005 in Taiwan due to the small number of positive cases. \n\n",
