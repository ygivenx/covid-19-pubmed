This was an opportunity to appreciate the extraordinary accomplishments of modern biology. The discovery paved the way for a renaissance in understanding basic biological principles, which is beginning to have direct application to the treatment of human disease. The year 2004 marks another anniversary: ten years of Nature Medicine, during which time the information derived from basic research has increasingly found its way into clinical practice. Advances in the powerful disciplines of immunology and molecular genetics have been synergistic, and our strengthened understanding of disease pathogenesis has allowed us to conceive and generate new therapies. During the past decade, several technologies once thought promising, but technically challenging, have proven tractable and are making significant inroads into the practice of medicine.",

Indeed, these antibodies quickly became of great practical use in basic research and diagnostic analysis. For at least two decades, monoclonal antibodies have provided fundamental insights into the antigenic structure of proteins and have helped reveal the roles of certain proteins in human disease. But the early promise of monoclonal antibodies as therapeutic agents was slow to materialize. Progress in this area was hampered by a number of technical hurdles: therapeutically relevant targets were difficult to identify, and the cost of producing purified biological reagents was prohibitively high. Worse still, it became evident that the first-generation antibodies derived from mouse hybridomas were themselves subject to immune responses that limited the efficacy and duration of their therapeutic effect.",

The realization that antibodies to tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) can ameliorate the symptoms of autoimmunity in diseases including rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn disease was a catalyst for further antibody research2. Indeed, antibodies to TNF-\u03b1 provided a means to define the role of the cytokine in the immunopathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis, while simultaneously becoming a therapeutic intervention. Three monoclonal antibodies have recently been evaluated and licensed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis3,4,5, and further studies are in progress for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis6,7. Substantial improvements in production technology, including the ability to make fully humanized monoclonal antibodies that evade the immune response, have facilitated progress in this field3.",

These studies showed that T-cell signaling through IL-2R is a key process in the development of this form of cancer.

As a result, gene therapy has not yet fulfilled its potential. The development of this field may well parallel that of monoclonal antibody therapy in its early stages. While apparently simple in concept, the practical realities of translating these ideas into clinical practice have proven more difficult than first imagined.

In a clinical trial, patient T lymphocytes were genetically modified in the laboratory (ex vivo) and then reinfused. Although long-term marking was seen in at least one case35, no change in immune function was observed, probably because of the low frequency of gene transfer into T cells, the apparent lack of selective expansion of the 'corrected' cells, and possible immunity generated against one of the bacterial resistance genes, neomycin, that was included for positive selection in the retroviral vector. This study and other early gene marking studies35,36 suggested that recombinant gene transfer could be achieved in a selected subpopulation of cells.

Indeed, preliminary trials have demonstrated gene transfer and expression of human factor IX in animals and human patients37,38,39. But the most encouraging advance so far has been in treatment of an inherited severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) caused by mutation of the common \u03b3-chain of the growth factor receptor. In this study, bone marrow cells from five children with SCID-X1 were transduced ex vivo with a replication-defective retroviral vector expressing the functional \u03b3-chain. When these transduced cells were engrafted back into the patients, they repopulated the lymphoid system and restored immune function40. This first therapeutic outcome in a gene transfer trial represented a breakthrough in the field. Similar approaches applied to other immune disorders have been without success, however, probably because of differences in the biology of these diseases. And unfortunately, the feature of SCID-X1 deficiency that led to success conferred an unexpected side effect: the uncontrolled proliferation of the gene-modified T cells in several subjects41, possibly related to insertional activation of an oncogene in these cells42. This experience underscores the need to regulate the expression of recombinant genes and to monitor sites of integration that may induce inadvertent gene activation.",

Adeno-associated virus vectors are considered less immunogenic and have some desirable safety features, but are less efficient at infecting certain nondividing cells and can carry only small therapeutic genes. Adenoviral vectors are highly effective at gene transfer and can be grown to high titer, but they do not integrate and are highly immunogenic; they are thus desirable for immunotherapy and vaccine applications but undesirable for the correction of inherited genetic disorders.

In addition to a variety of modified viral vectors, including poxviruses such as canarypox, fowlpox and modified vaccinia Ankara, researchers have developed novel adenovirus serotypes, alphaviruses, adeno-associated viruses and nonviral vectors such as naked DNA that can be used as vaccine vectors for a variety of infectious diseases (Fig. 3). Naked DNA has shown particular promise in a variety of different animal models of infectious disease, including HIV49, influenza virus50, malaria51,52,53,54, tuberculosis55, Ebola virus56, rabies57, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus58,59 and herpes simplex virus60. This technology has been evaluated in phase 1 human clinical trials for HIV, malaria and influenza virus.",

Based on the X-ray structure, specific rational mutations could be designed to alter, or expose potential antigenic determinants. The definition of functional structures, such as the helical coiled-coil regions of viral envelope glycoproteins62, has also revealed highly conserved functional domains that may be susceptible to neutralizing antibodies or other forms of antiviral therapy.

Recent studies have explored the possibility of using vaccination or immune intervention for the treatment of neurologic diseases, specifically Alzheimer disease, based on the ability of antibodies to reduce the formation of neurologic lesions in a mouse model of the disease66. A vaccine approach has also been developed for the prevention of atherosclerosis through the generation of antibodies to the cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP)67,68. CETP inhibition might increase the ratio of high- to low-density lipoproteins; this more favorable lipid profile is found in individuals with specific inherited mutations of CETP associated with protection against cardiovascular disease. Specific vaccine strategies have also been applied to a variety of allergic and autoimmune diseases. Finally, as noted above, the field of cancer immunotherapy has shown increasing promise as tumor antigens have been better defined, and the mechanisms that prevent immune responses to malignancies better understood. Better understanding of the basic molecular lesions and the delivery technology, as well as a more systematic assessment of human immune responses to tumor antigens will likely yield continued improvements in the success of these approaches.",

The ability to use continuously passaged cell lines to produce viral vaccines provides greater consistency and safety, and represents an important technological improvement. A variety of candidates show promise, including vaccines for human papillomavirus, herpesvirus and rotavirus which are in advanced clinical testing. Should these vaccines alone fulfill their promise, millions of lives would be saved and much needless suffering prevented. The development of vaccines against emerging infectious diseases, including Ebola virus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and West Nile virus, would contribute greatly to biodefense at the same time they would also have profound effects on world health.",
