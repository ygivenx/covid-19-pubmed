Therefore, we\nmeasured binding constants by surface plasmon resonance (SPR; Table 1). In this assay,\nRNA is immobilized on the SPR chip while the compound is flowed through\nin solution. This allows for determination of kinetic rate constants\nof binding as well as thermodynamic parameters.39 A comparison of the measured affinities for 1 and 3 indicates that substitution of triazole for olefin\nhas no effect on affinity (within error). N-methylation\nof 3 had only a modest effect on affinity; compound 7 displayed the highest affinity with a binding constant 6-fold\ntighter than 3. As with previously described N-methyl amide analogs such as 2, affinity\nenhancements are largely driven by an increase in on-rate (ka). This is consistent with the hypothesis that N-methylation reduces the complexity of the ground state\nconformational ensemble and favors a conformer or conformers able\nto bind the RNA, and with the known propensity of N-methylation to alter peptide conformation.40 In order to test selectivity, SPR measurements were made using a\ncompetitive assay, in which a mixture of the compound plus a 5-fold\nexcess of yeast tRNA (relative to compound concentration) in solution\nwas flowed over the SPR chip. Of course, this constitutes an even\nlarger excess of tRNA over the amount of HIV-1 FSS RNA immobilized\non the sensor chip, and as such represents a stringent assay. We observed\nthat, of the compounds tested, only 7 showed a significant\nchange in KD in the presence of tRNA.",

Disregarding the outlier sample revealed\n53 transcripts with a statistically significant change in both the\n6.8 and 20 \u03bcM compound-treated conditions (Figure 4). Of these, only two showed\na greater than 2-fold change (considered biologically significant4) in both sets: Genbank IDs RWDD4P2 and ElF4A1P2, both\npseudogenes. Inclusion of the outlier sample in the analysis resulted\nin only a subset (13) of these transcripts called differentially expressed.\nTherefore, although we cannot a priori conclude that\ninclusion of the outlier is not biologically relevant, its exclusion\nproduces the most conservative estimate of compound 7\u2019s effect on HEK293T cells. The 20 \u03bcM-treated samples\nshowed a few additional transcripts with significant changes. These\nincluded the expressed genes early growth response 1 (EGR1; log2(fold change) = 1.69), microtubule associated protein 1 light\nchain 3 beta 2 (MAP1LC3B2; log2(fold change) = 5.56), phosphatidylinositol\n4-kinase type 2 beta (PI4KIIB; log2(fold change) = \u22121.66),\nand ubiquitin specific peptidase 41 (USP41; log2(fold change\n= \u22127.85).

Varying\nconcentrations of compounds were added, with each condition tested\nin triplicate. In preliminary experiments with compounds 2, 3, and 7, one-half of the medium was\nharvested at 2 days postinfection and replaced with an equivalent\nvolume of medium \u00b1 compound. The medium removed was examined\nfor viral particles using a p24 ELISA assay. This procedure was repeated\nat days 4 and 6 postinfection. These experiments revealed a dose-\nand time-dependent inhibition of HIVIIIB for all three\ncompounds (Supporting Information), with\nvery low (compound 3) or undetectable (compounds 5 and 7) levels of virus present for the highest\ndoses at days 4 and 6 postinfection. Subsequently, full dose\u2013response\nprofiles were obtained for compounds 3, 4, 5, and 7, at 6 days postinfection (Figure 6). IC50 values were obtained via four-parameter logistic\nfits of these data. They indicate similar potencies for 3, 4, and 5 (15.33, 10.17, and 14.23 \u03bcM,\nrespectively), and a somewhat higher potency for compound 7 (4.86 \u03bcM). Decreases in virus were not due to inhibition of\ncell growth; indeed, more cells were present in the compound-treated\nwells than in the untreated but virus-infected wells at day 6 (Supporting Information), as measured by Alamar\nblue assay. This effect is striking and consistent with compound-mediated\nprotection from virus-induced apoptosis. Such an effect has been seen\nwith other anti-HIV agents.51 Compound 7 proved toxic to HIV-infected MT-2 cells at concentrations\nabove 15 \u03bcM.",

Our past work demonstrated\nthe feasibility of degrading the infectivity of pseudotyped HIV via FSS RNA-targeted compounds. Here, we demonstrate for\nthe first time that this strategy can also yield compounds able to\nstrongly inhibit replication of a laboratory strain of HIV in human\nT cells, and one compound inhibits a highly cytopathic, multidrug-resistant\nstrain. This is a critical step in the validation of the HIV-1 FSS\nRNA as a therapeutic target. It is also important to note that frameshifting\nis not limited to HIV-1. It is widely used in many pathogenic viruses\n(for example, the SARS coronavirus55,56 and HTLV-257) and also in eukaryotes, including humans.58,13,59 These recoding processes are\nall possible control points for driving therapeutic outcomes. As such,\nthe approach we have applied to frameshifting in HIV-1 should be extendable\nto synthetic molecule control over a broad range of recoding events.\nIn the broader context of RNA recognition, this work also demonstrates\nthat the use of 1,4-disubsituted triazoles as disulfide bioisosteres\nis effective.",
