Most studies have shown that the prognosis of ONFH and the outcomes of surgical treatments are associated with the lesion size [1\u20138]. Hence, it is very significant to establish whether the lesion size of ONFH can change over time. However, this issue currently remains controversial. Although several reports have demonstrated that it is impossible for the lesion size to change by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation during development of the disease without any operative treatments [3, 4, 8, 9], other studies have shown that reductions, and even complete resolution, or increments in the necrotic area can occur over several years [10\u201315].",

Therefore, it is advisable to use volume measurements for evaluating lesion size changes owing to their precision [11].",

From March to May 2003, 426 medical staff contracted SARS and were treated with a corticosteroid. From September 2003 to January 2004, all the medical staff were screened by MRI and radiography organised by the Beijing Municipal Government, and 87 patients with ONFH were diagnosed by MRI. Subsequently, the patients with ONFH were followed annually and the latest follow-ups were carried out from October to November 2008. All of the patients underwent more than three MRI scans. Patients followed by MRI in both 2006 and 2008 and without surgical intervention were included in this study. A total of 33 patients (56 hips) who subsequently underwent surgery for discomfort during the course of the disease were excluded. Finally, 84 hips in 51 patients without smoking or alcohol abuse were included. The final patients comprised 17 men and 34 women with a mean age of 33.84 \u00b1 9.15 years (range: 20\u201354 years). All 51 patients with ONFH were at the pre-collapse stage and without joint pain at the first MRI scan. According to the Association Research Circulation Osseous (ARCO) international staging system proposed in 1993 [20], 78 hips were at stage I and six hips were at stage II. The mean time from administration of the corticosteroid to the diagnosis of ONFH was 6.05 \u00b1 1.64 months (range: 2.3\u20139.0 months).

The volume changes between the first MRI scan (Vbaseline) and V2006 and between Vbaseline and V2008 were also significant. Although the volume change between V2006 and V2008 was not significant, the first interval was a little longer than the second interval. According to our arbitrary standard, nearly all of the lesions showed reductions and some lesions still showed reductions after 2.5 years. Therefore, there was a strong tendency for the reduction in lesion size to be time dependent. Another observed phenomenon was that the reduction was not continuous. Some lesions that showed reductions in 2006 did not reduce in 2008 and vice versa.",

If the diagnosis of ONFH is made by abnormal signals on MRI, there may be misdiagnoses [25]. During our follow-up study in SARS patients, there was an interesting finding that a few radiologically normal hips showed abnormal signals, such as band formation or decreased signal areas, on T1-weighted images and normal signals on STIR images. On the follow-up MRI, most of these abnormal signals disappeared on T1-weighted images and still showed a normal presentation on STIR images, while a few new cases occurred. We classified these hips into a non-necrotic group (Fig. 3). Since STIR is more sensitive than other protocols for detecting marrow abnormalities [26], we considered that the band or ring-like zones with decreased signal intensity on T1-weighted images and increased signal intensity on the corresponding STIR images could be used as diagnostic criteria for ONFH in the early stage. According to these diagnostic criteria, there were six hips that showed complete regression of their lesions in our study. Their initial volumes were relatively smaller. The intervals to complete resolution were >29 months.\n",

Therefore, our results cannot be considered to reflect the natural history of ONFH. Although a few studies have reported that non-surgical treatment can reduce the lesion size, their proposals are not generally accepted [20].
