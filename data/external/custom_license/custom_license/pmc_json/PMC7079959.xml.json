            "text": "Commonly used types of controls or standards for DNA virus assays include naked plasmid DNA, virus-positive patient specimens, specific cell lines, and armored DNA. Naked plasmid DNA contains the full virus genome, such as HBV (Gotsch et al. 2007; Stocher and Berg 2004) or HPV (Kuebler et al. 2007), and is often used to create amplification standards that allow direct comparisons between laboratories. Plasmid-derived controls are easy to produce, noninfectious to humans, and suitable for transport, but they are likely to degrade owing to the bare, unprotected DNA that is incorporated. Additionally, plasmid DNA cannot serve as a control for the whole real-time PCR process because nucleic acid extraction is not performed. Another alternative is positive patient specimen, a natural clinical sample that does allow for control of the entire detection process. However, these samples need to be screened to exclude hemolysis, lipoidemia, jaundice, or blood-borne pathogens, such as human immune deficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), or Treponema pallidum. Further, this type of control is time and labor consuming to prepare, infectious, and it is hard to manufacture and ship. Moreover, the viral load can be significantly reduced after repeated freezing and thawing. As an example, HPV controls from liquid-based cytology (LBC) (Fagan et al. 2010) samples of patients are difficult to obtain in large quantities, and often contain multiple infections with different HPV genotypes at low concentrations. Cervical cancer cell lines, another commonly used HPV controls, are hard to guarantee the uniformity of samples due to the effect of the sedimentation of the cells in the process of sample packing. In addition, obtaining cell lines other than HPV-16 and HPV-18 genomic DNA included is often infeasible. Armored DNA prepared from bacteriophage is yet another choice. At present, there are three kinds of DNA phages that have been applied to the manufacture of DNA controls and standards: filamentous phage (Gotsch et al. 2007), T7 bacteriophage (Masker et al. 1978), and lambda phage (Stocher and Berg 2004). Filamentous phage is not a proper choice due to its single-stranded structure that does not mimic the characteristics (i.e., secondary structure) (Gotsch et al. 2007) of double-stranded DNA which is important in the early stages of real-time PCR assay. T7 bacteriophage is generally not chosen because of its relatively lower packaging efficiency. Armored DNA produced from lambda phage is less stable in plasma than other phages; so, it cannot be widely used (Walkerpeach and Pasloske 2004). Based on these issues, there is a serious need to construct better controls and standards for viral assays to overcome the limitations of these existing ones.",

            "text": "In this study, we took advantage of MS2, a single-stranded RNA bacteriophage, to prepare armored DNA in a novel way. This new construct is superior to the earlier DNA phages in terms of its structural features and application for detection. Historically, MS2 bacteriophage has been used extensively to produce armored RNA as controls or standards for RNA viruses, such as HIV (Pasloske et al. 1998), HCV (Konnick et al. 2005), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Bressler and Nolte 2004), avian influenza virus H7N9 (Sun et al. 2013), and long chimeric RNA sequences (Wei et al. 2008b), because they are nuclease-resistant and stable. These studies were based on cloning the gene sequences of coat protein (CP) and the conserved exogenous RNA virus into a vector for expression in E. coli or Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Virus-like particles (VLPs) self-assemble from 180 sequence identical monomers (~14 kD) into a ~28-nm diameter icosahedral protein capsid, through the interaction between CP and the pac site. Armored DNA in our research was prepared in a different way in vitro. We dissociated MS2 into CP dimers first, and then reassembled them into VLPs at the presence of pac site under specific conditions, making use of the same reassembly mechanism as traditional approaches. Furthermore, the size and morphology of MS2 capsids before and after dissociation have no difference. This similarity is important, as the interior surface modification of MS2 (Obermeyer et al. 2014; Wu et al. 2009) based on the technique has been widely used, achieving great achievements such as drug-targeted delivery for cancer treatments (Ashley et al. 2011; Wu et al. 1995), development of MRI contrast agents for imaging (Datta et al. 2008; Garimella et al. 2011), and encapsulation of various molecules such as antisense oligonucleotides (Wu et al. 2005), enzymes (Glasgow et al. 2012), organic fluorophores (Capehart et al. 2013), quantum dots, doxorubicin, and siRNAs (Ashley et al. 2011).",

S. Peabody, containing nucleotides (nt) 81\u20131749 of the MS2 phage (GeneBank accession no. V00642). The underlined sequences are BamHI and HindIII restriction enzyme sites, respectively. PCR products of 1.7 kb were gel purified, digested with BamHI and HindIII, and ligated to the vector pACYCDuet-1 (Fig. S1) to generate the recombinant plasmid. The inserted sequences were identified by sequencing and blast searching in the NCBI databases. It is worth mentioning that the second multiple cloning site of the vector contained neither exogenous sequences nor the pac site. The plasmid was transformed into E. coli strain BL21 (DE3), and then, MS2 phages were expressed by adding 1 mM isopropyl-\u03b2-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to the bacterial cultures and incubation for 12 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by sonication. The MS2 VLPs were purified by Sephacryl S-200 gel exclusion chromatography (BioLogic DuoFlow chromatography system, BIO RAD; USA) after the supernatant was incubated with RNase A and DNase I at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min to eliminate the E. coli genome. The dissociation method we used was performed according to Wu et al. (1995). Briefly, 1 mL of the MS2 phage (4 mg mL\u22121) was incubated with 2-mL cold glacial acetic acid on ice for 30 min, then centrifuged at 6600\u00d7g for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C to remove precipitated maturase and nucleic acid. The supernatant was dialyzed against 1 mM acetic acid using dialysis tubing closures (7 kDa molecular weight cutoffs [MWCO]), with buffer changed three times every 4 h. The protein solution was then applied to Superdex 75 Prep Grade (GE Healthcare; USA) on BioLogic DuoFlow chromatography system using 50 mM Tris with 100 mM NaCl. Fractions which were shown to be the dimers by SDS-PAGE were collected, concentrated, and kept on ice for use at the same day.",

Using the same method, we overlapped the E6 (nt 26\u2013820, 795 bp), L1 (nt 6151\u20137069, 919 bp), and E1 regions (nt 1103\u20132807, 1705 bp) of HPV-16 (GeneBank accession no. K0718), forming a target sequence of 3.5 kb in length. Similarly, we overlapped the E6 (nt 101\u20131342, 1283 bp), L1 (nt 6265\u201371246, 860 bp), and E1 regions (nt 2047\u20132987, 941 bp) of HPV-18 (GeneBank accession no. X05015), forming a target sequence of 3 kb in length. The PCR templates were the plasmids that were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA), containing the full genome of virus, e.g., HPV-16 (ATCC No. 45113) and HPV-18 (ATCC No. 45152). Finally, we overlapped the 3.5-kb HPV-16 and 3-kb HPV-18 DNA sequences to form a 6.5-kb HPV sequence. The HPV primer sets, 18-E6F and 168 over-E6F, and 168 over-E1R and HPV 16-E1R, were used in the first round of overlapping extension PCR. In the second round, HPV 18-E6F and HPV 16-E1R were used for a final extension to obtain the 6.5-kb target sequence. The primers are listed in Table S1.

For the DNA fragments of the same length packaged into the capsids, the assembly efficiency reached the maximum in the presence of 5 \u03bcM TR-RNA or 20 \u03bcM TR-DNA, and both were followed by a decrease in yield at high concentrations (Fig. 2b).

Our team has made continuous progress in this aspect. We have demonstrated that by applying a one-plasmid expression system with two C-variant pac sites (Wei et al. 2008a), a two-plasmid expression system with one C-variant pac site (Wei et al. 2008b), and a one-plasmid double-expression system with three C-variant pac sites (Zhan et al. 2009), 1981-base, 2248-base, and 3034-base chimeric RNA can be successfully packaged into MS2 capsids. Due to the limitations of the existing armored DNA manufactured with commonly used DNA phages, we used MS2, a single-strand RNA bacteriophage, to prepare armored DNA in a distinct approach (Fig. 1a). Previous studies have clarified the ability of MS2 CP to assemble spontaneously in the presence of the so-called pac site (Pickett and Peabody 1993; Wu et al. 1995), i.e., translational repressor, a stem-loop structure in the RNA. In this way, attachment of the pac site to the molecule of interest can induce it be packaged within the capsids when mixed with CP dimers. Taking advantage of this reassembly characteristic in vitro, we tested the encapsulation of much longer DNA fragments than that of armored RNA, which had a maximum length of about 3 kb in the protein shell by the plasmid expression system (Zhan et al. 2009). It is necessary to know that the nucleic acid packaging capacity is mostly restricted by the viral vector; thus, the length of the packaged DNA is generally similar to that of the viral genome. However, without the limit of a particular gene delivery vector, MS2 capsid was able to encapsulate DNA sequences up to 6.5 kb in our study, which was nearly twice as long as the 3.5 kb of genomic MS2 DNA. The reason we attempted to package such long sequence is that it would be beneficial for some armored DNA in various detection assays and kits. On the other hand, we were pleased to see the maximum packaging capability of MS2 capsids by this routine. Based on these results, we suppose that much longer DNA sequences can be encapsulated in the MS2 capsids, when the current method is used.",

            "text": "Encapsulation is based on the specific interaction between the RNA hairpin operator, i.e., pac site, and the MS2 CP, leading to spontaneous assembly of the viral shell and packaging the molecules around them. It has been demonstrated that (Rohrmann and Krueger 1970; Stockley et al. 1994; Witherell et al. 1991) the conserved bases of the MS2 operator are the A-4 and A-7 positions of the single-stranded loop, the \u22125 position must be a pyrimidine for tight binding, and the mismatched base of \u221210 position can be a purine (Fig. 1c). Bases of the remaining positions are not so significant that they can be any Watson-Crick base pair (Witherell et al. 1991). The loop and the unpaired A-10 are needed to provide sufficient affinity for the interaction between the MS2 operator and CP (Rowsell et al. 1998). However, it was proved that the sequence-specific complex can still form without an unpaired base at the \u221210 position (Rowsell et al. 1998), though the interaction was weak. All these above illustrate that TR-DNA can indeed initiate reassembly of the MS2 capsids when mixed with CP dimers, playing a similar role to TR-RNA and making the package more convenient and feasible. Moreover, four kinds of VLPs, which encapsulated different lengths of DNA and had diameters of 27\u201330 nm (Fig. 2d), were morphologically indistinguishable from wild-type MS2 phages.",

In comparison, armored HBV DNA produced by lambda bacteriophage was so susceptible in plasma that it was stable for no more than 4 days (Walkerpeach and Pasloske 2004). The steady MS2 phage used in our study solved this problem perfectly, in that this kind of HBV control is stable for at least 6 months at 4 \u00b0C and the armored HPV DNA was stable at 4 \u00b0C for at least 3 months. Therefore, controls for other HPV genotypes can be manufactured by this routine to construct a sample panel for proficiency testing.",
