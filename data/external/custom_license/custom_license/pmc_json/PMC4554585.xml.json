Mortality is low in naturally reared suckling lambs, although it increases when the disease is associated with concurrent infections or deficiencies in nutrition or husbandry (de Graaf et al. 1999). Cryptosporidial infection in small ruminants was first diagnosed in 1987, in diarrhoeic lambs (Rojo-V\u00e1zquez et al. 1987). Later, infection was reported in sheep from different geographical areas of the world as reviewed by Thompson et al. (2005). In India, most data on the incidence of Cryptosporidium infection in animals are mostly related to calves (Singh et al. 2006; Paul et al. 2008; Yadav et al. 2012) and till date no report has been published regarding status of the infection in lambs.",

For each animal, faecal sample was taken directly from the rectum by using a disposable plastic bag and disposable plastic containers were used in lambs with diarrhoea. Faecal samples were examined by preparing smears on the glass slides and then were stained by the modified Ziehl Neelsen technique (Henricksen and Pohlenz 1981). Data regarding consistency of faeces, age and sex of the animal were also recorded. The entire surface of the smear was examined for the presence of Cryptosporidium oocysts at 400\u00d7 and 1,000\u00d7 magnifications and, if positive, infection intensity was evaluated as per OIE (2008) i.e., 1+ ; less than 5 oocysts per slide, 2+ ; 1\u201310 oocysts per field of view and 3+ ; 11 or more oocysts per field of view.",

Statistical analysis revealed that per cent prevalence in <1 month age group varied significantly (p < 0.05) with other two age groups. Further, statistically it was observed that the chances of occurrence of Cryptosporidium spp. in animals of <1 month age group was 3.09 times higher (OR: 3.09, 95 % CI: 1.252\u20139.657) than 3\u20136 months age group animals. Diarrhoeic lambs revealed significantly (p < 0.05) higher prevalence (54.41 %) than non diarrhoeic lambs (34.61 %) and 2.25 times higher risk (Odd ratio: 2.25; 95 % CI 1.004\u20135.093) of susceptibility to Cryptosporidium infection was observed. Higher prevalence was observed in female lambs (51.56 %) as compared to male lambs (39.28 %). Results of analysis of risk factors revealed that female lambs show 0.60 times more infection as compared to male lambs (OR 0.60, 95 % CI 0.275\u20131.339). The detailed prevalence and analysis has been shown in Table 1. Seasonal prevalence revealed highest infection during the winter months (73.33 %) and it varied significantly (p < 0.05) when compared with other seasons and the probability of occurrence was 6.41 times higher (OR 6.41, 95 % CI 1.832\u201323.505) than summer months.

This finding is probably the first documented report regarding the prevalence of Cryptosporidium infection in lambs in India. The high prevalence of lambs shedding oocysts in the first month stresses on the fact that most of them might be infected immediately after birth. This observation is consistent with the duration of the parasite\u2019s life cycle which is around 4 days and suggestive of heavy environmental contamination in the lambing area and/or infection from post parturient dams which remain permanently with lambs and responsible for infection at suckling (Causape et al. 2002).",

Nevertheless, Munoz-fernandez et al. (1996) had earlier reported that Cryptosporidium was the most frequent agent found in 45 % of diarrhoeic lambs in contrast to potentially pathogenic E. coli (30 %) and Rota virus (2.1 %). The association of diarrhoea with prevalence of cryptosporidiosis showed positive correlation as higher prevalence was observed in diarrhoeic lambs (54.41 %) in comparison to non diarrhoeic lambs (34.61 %). The constant association of diarrhoea and the presence of oocysts of Cryptosporidium in the faeces have been recorded by other workers (Causape et al. 2002). In Serbia, diarrhoea was observed more frequently in younger lambs positive for Cryptosporidium (69 %) than older lambs where infection was frequently asymptomatic (70.8 %) (Zorana et al. 2006). As many as 93.3 % of lambs in the first week infected by Cryptosporidium had diarrhoea and this was found to be statistically associated with cryptosporidial infection in all age groups even in lambs of 22\u201390 days of age (Causape et al. 2002).",

The highest intensity of infection in <1 month age group diarrhoeic animals, mainly in winter season demonstrates that these animals are important from an epidemiological point of view and play an important source of contamination to water and soil of the area which has resulted in several water borne outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis in man and animals (Fayer et al. 2000).",
