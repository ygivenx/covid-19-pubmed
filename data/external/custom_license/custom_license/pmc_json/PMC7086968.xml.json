The first verified record of muntjac deer in the wild in Northern Ireland was confirmed during June 2009 as a result of a road traffic accident near Newtownards, Co. Down [4]. This is the first known introduction of a new large mammal species in Northern Ireland since the introduction of sika deer (Cervus nippon Temminck, 1838) in 1870. The second record was a culled animal (referred to hereafter as \u2018animal 1\u2019) shot in the grounds of Mount Stewart, Co. Down, in June 2011. In February 2013, another animal was shot in the same locality (referred to hereafter as \u2018animal 2\u2019). Furthermore, in the spring of 2013 and 2014, a camera trapping survey confirmed the presence of a small muntjac population within this area [5]. In April 2013, eleven positive detections of muntjac were made at seven separate locations in this area using camera traps.",

Laboratory examination of animal 1 did not show the presence of any significant bacterial or parasitic infections, including bovine tuberculosis (data not shown). Amplicons of the expected size generated by the diagnostic PCR were detected in the colon, mediastinal lymph node, lung and blood clot for animal 1 and in the bronchial lymph node in animal 2. Sequencing and subsequent BlastN analysis of short 175-bp sequences determined that they were herpesviral sequences most similar to those found in a number of deer species. The sequences were identical in both animals. Amplicons of the expected size generated by the PCR for phylogenetic analysis were detected in the mediastinal lymph node of animal 1 and in the bronchial lymph node in animal 2. Sequencing and subsequent BlastN analysis of a 500-bp sequence from the bronchial lymph node of animal 2 determined it to be herpesviral sequence most closely related to the DNA-dependent DNA polymerase gene of type 2 ruminant rhadinovirus of mule deer, which belongs to the family Gammaherpesvirinae, genus Rhadinovirus. Phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1) of this sequence compared to homologous herpesviral sequences from GenBank confirmed this relationship to type 2 rhadinovirus of mule deer. Analysis of nucleotide sequence similarity showed 82.2% sequence identity between the virus from animal 2 and the type 2 rhadinovirus of mule deer (accession no. HM014314). Other members of the family Gammaherpesvirinae, genus Macavirus, showed approximately 65% nucleotide sequence identity to the virus from animal 2, whereas human herpesvirus and bovine herpesvirus 1 (family Alphaherpesvirinae) showed lower similarity (Table 1).\n\n",

            "text": "The introduction of invasive species poses a great threat to conservation in Northern Ireland. There is a significant risk of them introducing novel pathogens to native wildlife that are immunologically naive. In addition, invasive species pose a similar threat to domesticated food animals and a zoonotic threat to human populations. Deer are known to be susceptible to bovine, caprine and ovine viruses and vice versa. A recent study from Japan showed native wild and American farmed sika deer to have antibodies against bovine parainfluenza virus type 3, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine adenovirus type 7, bovine coronavirus, bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV), and bovine herpesvirus type 1 [10]. Antibodies to the recently emerged Schmallenberg virus, which causes foetal abnormalities, have been reported in red deer (Cervus elaphus), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and muntjac deer in Austria, Belgium and England [11]. BVDV has been detected in a wide range of wild and captive deer in Europe and North America, including roe deer, red deer, fallow deer (Dama dama), elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) [12]. In the Republic of Ireland, an industry-led compulsory national BVDV eradication programme commenced in 2013 (http://www.bvdfree.ie), while the compulsory phase of the Northern Ireland eradication programme began in 2016 (http://www.animalhealthni.com/BVD.aspx). In order for muntjac deer to be considered a reservoir for re-introduction of BVDV to cattle after eradication efforts, the animals must be susceptible to infection and able to shed the virus, the virus must be capable of being maintained in the population, and there must be sufficient contact with domestic livestock [13]. It is not known if muntjac deer fulfil these criteria for BVDV or other pathogens, but an expanding muntjac population should be monitored closely to assess the level of risk posed.",

Camera trap and anecdotal evidence strongly suggest that muntjac are becoming established in Ireland and it is known that muntjac can form successful populations from a limited number of founding females [18]. As such, there is significant value in monitoring the virological status of these invasive animals. As our phylogenetic tree is based only on a small fragment of a single gene, further sequencing would be necessary to provide a definitive classification of this gammaherpesvirus, and metagenomic analysis of additional samples using next-generation sequencing would be a powerful method of further virus discovery.\n",
