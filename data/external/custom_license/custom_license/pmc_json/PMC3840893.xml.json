As a control, a subset of the samples was analyzed for inhibition of cellular entry mediated by the G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G), an animal virus that does not circulate in Saudi Arabia, and the spike protein of the human coronavirus NL63 (NL63-S), a globally circulating coronavirus. None of the samples robustly inhibited VSV-G\u2013dependent entry, whereas most samples markedly reduced entry-driven by NL63-S (Figure 1), as expected (7). Experiments using serum samples of known neutralizing capacity confirmed that our neutralization experiments were sensitive and specific (Figure 2). Thus, serum samples obtained from a patient infected with MERS-CoV potently inhibited MERS-S but not VSV-G\u2013 or NL63-S\u2013driven entry, whereas the reverse observation was made with serum samples reactive against NL63-S (Figure 2). In sum, none of the samples from children with respiratory infections and none of the samples from healthy adult men showed detectable amounts of MERS-S\u2013neutralizing antibodies, but most neutralized NL63-S\u2013driven host cell entry.",

Our analysis of samples from children might have underestimated seroprevalence because if they were hospitalized for MERS-CoV infection, a virus-specific antibody response might have developed after sample collection. Moreover, although infection of young children has been reported (8), the average age of MERS patients is 50 years. Our findings using samples from adult men argue against the extensive spread of MERS-CoV within this group in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia during 2012, which is noteworthy given recent reports of asymptomatic MERS-CoV infections (9,10).

Transduction efficiency was measured by quantification of luciferase activities in cell lysates and is shown relative to transduction of cells in the absence of serum, which was set at 100%.
