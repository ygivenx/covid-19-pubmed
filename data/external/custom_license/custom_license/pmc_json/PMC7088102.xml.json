Chronic HBV infection leads to a wide spectrum of clinical presentations, including the asymptomatic carrier state, mild and severe chronic hepatitis B (CHB-M, CHB-S), and acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF). In China, patients with hepatitis B-related ACLF account for more than 80% of total ACLF cases due to the high prevalence of chronic HBV infection. Without transplantation, such patients have a high mortality rate (60\u201380%), resulting in 22,600 deaths annually [3].",

            "text": "The pathogenesis of the severity of chronic HBV infection remains largely unclear. Both viral and host factors may play a role. HBV is a highly variable virus and is classified into at least eight genotypes (A\u2013H) that may vary in geographical distribution, viral characteristics, and relationship to clinical outcomes [4]. HBV mutations in basal core promoter (BCP) and precore (PC) regions have attracted special attention because the BCP mutation may enhance HBV replication in vitro and the PC mutation abrogates translation of the HBe antigen (HBeAg) which is considered to be a tolerant protein to buffer immune attack of the infected hepatocytes [5\u20137]. Studies have been performed to clarify these virologic features in patients with acute liver failure (ALF) who developed fulminant hepatitis from acute HBV infection. The occurrence of the BCP double mutation A1762T/G1764A and the PC mutation G1896A has been documented to be higher in ALF patients than in those with acute hepatitis B [8\u201314]. A few other BCP/PC mutations have also been reported to be associated with increased HBV replication capacity and/or reduced HBeAg expression in vitro and, in some cases, also associated with ALF occurrence [15\u201318]. However, the findings have been inconsistent, and to date no obvious link has been identified between HBV BCP/PC mutations and ALF or fulminant hepatitis development [19\u201322]. Such clinical results may be partly due to inadequate sample sizes and the interference of viral genotypes.",

The severity of chronic HBV infection may exhibit a progressive process, i.e., from CHB-M to CHB-S and then to ACLF in many cases. In the study reported here, we investigated the features of HBV BCP/PC mutations and genotypes in a large number of CHB-M, CHB-S, and ACLF patients and analyzed the clinical implications of the virologic features.",

The patient cohort comprised 325 CHB-M, 170 CHB-S, and 298 ACLF patients. The patients came from various areas of China, but mainly from the north of the country. The diagnostic criteria were based on the Management Scheme of Diagnostic and Therapy Criteria of Viral Hepatitis [24] and Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines for Liver Failure [25], issued by the Chinese Society of Infectious Diseases and Parasitology and the Chinese Society of Hepatology, respectively, and have been described in our previous studies [26, 27]. Briefly, all patients had persistent seropositivity of HBsAg for at least 6 months before enrollment. CHB-M patients met the following criteria: a history of chronic hepatitis based on a histopathological diagnosis and/or compatible laboratory data and ultrasonographic findings, with mild to moderate liver disease activities that did not reach the criteria of CHB-S. CHB-S patients had severe liver disease symptoms, including obvious clinical manifestations and significant alterations in their biochemical parameters, such as significant serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation. Based on the biochemical parameters, the diagnosis of CHB-S had to meet at least one of the following criteria: (1) serum albumin level \u226432 g/L; (2) serum total bilirubin (TBIL) >85.5 \u03bcmol/L; (3) plasma prothrombin activity (PTA) was 60\u201340%; (4) serum cholinesterase <4,500 IU/L. ACLF patients met the following criteria: recent development of increasing jaundice (TBIL >171.0 \u03bcmol/L or rapid increase to >17.1 \u03bcmol/L/day) and decreasing PTA (<40%), with a recent development of complications, such as hepatic encephalopathy (\u2265grade 2), or an abrupt and obvious increase of ascites or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or hepatorenal syndrome. The criteria for ACLF have been widely used in China and are similar (but not exactly identical) with the newly issued Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver (APASL) criteria [28]. For all patients, there was no evidence of HCC or other metastatic liver disease; no evidence for concomitant hepatitis C/D virus (HCV/HDV) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or autoimmune liver disease. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Beijing 302 Hospital.",

HBV BCP/PC mutations are considered to be likely involved in the driving factors of disease progression of HBV infection because BCP/PC mutations affect viral replication and/or HBeAg expression, which may in turn impact on immune responses to the virus. For example, it has been proposed that expression of HBeAg during perinatal infection, the major mode of HBV transmission in Asia, induces immune tolerance. Another potential role of HBeAg in promoting persistent infection is to mimic CP so as to buffer the immune attack of the infected hepatocytes by the anti-HBc antibodies [5]. When the balance is disrupted by the emergence of HBV mutants with different phenotypes, the altered virus\u2013cell relationship might trigger robust immune responses of the host in some instances, causing extensive hepatocyte necrosis [30]. Thus, the investigation of virologic features may shed light on the pathogenesis and identify predictors of ACLF development.

A sensitive nested PCR assay with a lower limit of detection of 2000 copies/mL was developed to overcome this obstacle. The technique allowed us to analyze samples of quite low viral load, as in our previous severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)\u2013coronavirus studies [33, 34]. A significantly higher incidence of the BCP/PC mutations at eight of the ten sites of interest was found in ACLF patients than in CHB patients. In particular, the occurrence of three hotspot BCP/PC mutations and average substitution number in the ten sites of interest increased with the severity of illness in a stepwise fashion (Table 1), suggesting that the accumulation of the BCP/PC mutations could be one of the driving factors of illness severity. Taking into account that a longer duration of infection may increase the incidence of HBV BCP/PC mutation, we particularly compared different illness groups of comparable ages to minimize this factor. The results showed that the increasing trend of the three hotspot mutations (A1762T, G1764A, and G1896A) with disease severity remained unchanged in age-matched patients (Table 2). In addition to variants at the ten sites of interest, the frequency of A1846T was found to increase in CHB-S and ACLF patients compared to CHB-M patients, suggesting that this variant may also be associated with disease severity. A1846T has been reported to be more frequently detected in HBeAg-negative HBV infection than in HBeAg-positive HBV infection [35], but the mechanism needs further clarification. More frequent BCP mutations and less frequent PC mutations were detected in genotype C virus than in genotype B virus which confirmed previous results [36, 37]. Interestingly, T1754G was an exceptional case which was more often seen in genotype B virus infection. The influence of HBV genotypes on the severity of HBV infection is still uncertain. As genotype B and C viruses have different BCP/PC mutational features, their influence on clinical outcome may be associated with the BCP/PC mutation. Nevertheless, the average substitution number per sample in BCP/PC regions clearly increased with the severity of the illness categories in both genotype B and C, suggesting that the accumulation of the BCP/PC mutations increased the risk of ACLF occurrence regardless of the HBV genotypes.",

Therefore, we classified three BCP/PC mutation statuses as BCP\u2212/PC\u2212, BCP+/PC\u2212 and BCP\u00b1/PC+ and analyzed their implications. The results showed that CHB-M patients infected with BCP/PC mutants exhibited more enhanced inflammatory responses (significant increase in TBIL and ALT levels and a slight decrease of viral load) than those with the BCP/PC wild-type virus, whereas CHB-S and ACLF patients did not. In contrast, CHB-S patients infected with BCP/PC mutants had lower TBIL and HBV DNA levels than those with the wild-type virus. To date, few studies have been able to show an association between these clinical parameters and HBV BCP/PC mutations. BCP mutants have been shown to be positively correlated with increased ALT levels in chronic HBV carriers and CHB patients [41], and reduced viremia associated with BCP/PC mutants was explained by the fact that enhanced HBV replication of the mutants would efficiently stimulate immune reactions, leading to the enhanced destruction of viral particles [13, 15]. The alternation of ALT and HBV DNA levels may be influenced by the use of antiviral treatment; furthermore, a blood test at a single time point may bias the evaluation of disease activity for some CHB patients with fluctuating ALT and HBV DNA levels, although these influences were relatively proportionate in large-size samples in this study. Further genotypic and phenotypic studies need to be performed to make a clearer outline.",

In CHB-S and ACLF patients, BCP mutation alone did not significantly increase HBeAg-negative/anti-HBe-positive rates, suggesting that BCP mutations may have diverse influence on HBeAg seroconversion in different illness categories. There have been reports of the BCP double mutations being associated with lower viral loads in HBeAg-positive individuals [42] and the PC mutation being correlated with high levels of HBV DNA in HBeAg-negative CHB patients [43]. However, these associations were not observed in our study (data not shown). Mutant viruses frequently coexist with wild-type viruses, and subpopulations comprising <20% of the total HBV population may be missed by direct sequencing techniques [44]. This may account for the detection of G1896A mutants in some HBeAg-positive patients.",
