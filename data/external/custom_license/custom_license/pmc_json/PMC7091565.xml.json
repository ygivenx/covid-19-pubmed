            "text": "Yet another emerging disease is threatening to take a foothold on the global populace. This novel disease entity, termed Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), is an atypical pneumonia that is likely to have originated in the Guangdong province of Southern China in the fall of 2002.1,2 As of August 2003 more than 8,400 SARS cases and 916 deaths have been reported worldwide from 32 countries.3 The brunt of the disease has thus far been borne by the East, especially China (including Hong Kong) and Singapore whilst the West, except for Canada, still remains relatively unscathed with only sporadic infections brought home by travellers to affected areas. During this period the UK had a total of four probable cases, one of which had a confirmed exposure to the SARS coronavirus. All four had fully recovered and there was no secondary spread.4 The World Health Organisation (WHO) has announced recently that the peak period of the outbreak is likely to have passed and the associated dwindling in the morbidity and mortality rates is a testimony to this. In countries like the UK the risk of SARS is therefore assessed to be low. However, WHO has asked all countries to remain vigilant. The Health Protection Agency (HPA) of the UK also advised that the situation in the UK may have to be re-assessed if SARS does re-emerge.5 And indeed a confirmed case of SARS coronavirus infection was reported in Singapore as recently as September 2003 although the infection was transmitted through laboratory contamination and not via the community.6",

Although less contagious than influenza it is much more so than other circulating viruses such as the human immunodeficiency virus. In fact SARS is the first severe and readily transmissible new disease to emerge in the twenty-first century. Most SARS infections occur after close exposure to the index case as in household contacts but casual social contact may transmit the disease on occasions. The spread amongst front line healthcare workers (HCWs) has been one of the most disconcerting aspects of SARS. Currently, one quarter to one third infected are unsuspecting HCWs who fought to save the lives of patients without adequate barrier protection.1,7 International travel through major transportation hubs such as Hong Kong and Singapore has facilitated the spread of the disease to all corners of the globe within a short time span.1,8",

Structurally, it is an enveloped, single stranded RNA (80-100 nm) virus covered by spike-like projections, resembling a crown, when viewed electron microscopically, hence its name.11 Although the genome organization of SARS-CoV is similar to that of other coronaviruses, they are not closely related.12",

Diagnosis is thus based on clinical findings, epidemiology and exclusion from other pneumonias and is confirmed by a positive seroconversion.21,22 There is no definitive treatment and empirical regimes differ amongst countries and may include the use of antibiotics, anti-virals and steroids.1,23,24 Severe cases require mechanical ventilation in intensive care units.1,7 Several groups have reported uncontrolled trials of antiviral (ribavirin) and steroids, the efficacy of which has not been resolved as yet. According to some, delay in treatment beyond a window period of first 8 days of symptom onset is associated with worse prognosis.
