For example, in bioinformatics, biological data grow exponentially in size and complexity. It is not an easy work to extract useful information from it. Thus an important goal of data mining in bioinformatics is to extract valuable information from a large amount incomprehensible, biological data. Traditional algorithmical techniques use pattern matching algorithms to find valuable information for biological sequences. For example, linear scan (Knuth et al. 1977) and suffix tree (Ukkonen 1995) are two well-known approaches. For more references and applications on patter matching, we refer to (Gusfield 1997).",

Association-rule mining, which was first investigated in (Agrawal et al. 1993), explores the relationships among data items. It is a very popular technique in data mining. For example, in the analysis of association rules of a metabolic pathway, the rule \u201cGene\n1 \u2192 Gene\n2, support = 10%, confidence = 90%\u201d means that the support of 10% indicates that Gene\n1 and Gene\n2 are expressed together in 10% of all datasets, and the confidence of 90% indicates that 90% of the metabolic pathway which activated Gene\n1 also correlated with Gene\n2. Recently, Kotlyar and Jurisica used this technique to predict protein\u2013protein interactions (Kotlyar and Jurisica 2006).",

            "text": "The approaches used to find association rules can be roughly classified into two categories. The first category is the Apriori-based algorithm (Agrawal and Srikant 1994). This influential algorithm generates candidate patterns according to the non-monotonicity heuristic. The two main problems of Apriori are that (1) it needs to scan the database several times and (2) it generates too many candidate patterns. Various techniques have been used to overcome these problems. In Park et al. (1995), a hash table is used to store candidate patterns to increase the scanning efficiency; Agrawal and Srikant (1994), Han and Fu (1995), and Park et al. (1995) attempt to reduce the number of transactions scanned in future iterations; Savasere et al. (1995) and Zaki (2000) adopt the techniques of partitioning and sampling; and Brin et al. (1997) proposes a dynamic pattern-counting method in which candidate patterns are added at different points during a scan. And the negative association rules are considered in Antonie and Za\u00efane (2004); Thiruvady and Webb (2004); Zhang and Zhang (2004). Moreover, the problem of mining temporal indirect association patterns is considered in Chen et al. (2006).",

This algorithm scans the database to find all frequent items, and compresses the database by representing the frequent items in an FP-tree. Finally, all frequent patterns can be obtained by searching the tree. When the database is large, it is sometimes unrealistic to construct an FP-tree that resides in main memory. This leads to the proposed extension of the pattern-growth concept, namely, H-mine. H-mine designs a dynamic structure to adjust links dynamically, instead of requiring an FP-tree to be maintained or a physical database to be created. The motivation of this method is to preserve space, and initially involves loading transactions into memory. However, H-mine has to maintain a head table at each level of the tree, and modify the links to build a queue of the collection of transactions containing the same prefix before the pattern support is counted.",

Matrix Apriori (Pavon et al. 2006) utilizes simple structures such as matrices and vectors in the process of generating frequent patterns, and it also minimizes the number of candidate sets. In (Lee et al. 2006), the idea of compressions rules is proposed and a data mining structure is used to extract association rules from a database. Redundant data will then be replaced by means of compression rules. (Chu et al. 2005) uses a simple method to transform the transactions read from the database into their corresponding patterns and then accumulates the occurring times of these patterns. (Chen et al. 2002) refines sampling functions to a two-phase sampling based algorithm that attempts to reduce the errors caused by sampling functions. (Chen and Ho 2005) proposed a sampling-based method that contains three phases. The first phase draws a small sample of data to estimate the set of frequent patterns, denoted as FS. The second phase computes the actual supports of the patterns in FS as well as identifies a subset of patterns in FS that need to be further examined in the next phase. Finally, the third phase explores this set and finds all missing frequent patterns.",

Defining the number of tolerable faults in the patterns as a fixed number of items is not objective. The matters of \u201ctolerant 1 item\u201d in a pattern with length 4 and that in a pattern with length 10 give people entirely different sense. For example, the function of a protein is determined by its structure but not sequence. It is possible that two proteins of similar function have different sequence lengths, e.g., the family of heat shock proteins. In this case, it is hard to mine them together using FT pattern mining with fixed number of tolerable faults. In this paper, we introduce the problem of mining proportional FT patterns; in these patterns, the number of tolerable faults in the pattern is proportional to the pattern length. Two approaches are proposed to solve this problem. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: background knowledge and problem definitions are presented in Section 2, the principles underlying our approaches are presented in Section 3, Section 4 describes the experimental results, and the conclusions and future work are discussed in Section 5.",

In contrast, a conformational epitope is a sequence of discontinuous amino acids that come together in three dimensional conformation, or tertiary structure. Macromolecular antigens such as proteins usually have many different epitopes. Moreover, the same segment of protein can be a part of more than one epitopes. In general, the length of an epitope can be from eight to 24 amino acids. Intensive research is currently taking place to design reliable tools to predict epitopes on proteins.

In the results, four maximal itemsets (with length 680, 768, 367, and 229, respectively) are obtained. The union of these four sets has similar effect to the set of size 850.

In contrast to previous studies on FT data mining, the number of tolerable faults in FT patterns found by our approach is proportional to the length of the patterns. The maximum number of tolerable faults can be obtained by evaluating the maximum possible length of an FT pattern. Two algorithms that find an effective solution to the problem of mining proportional FT frequent patterns are designed. The FT-BottomUp algorithm generates all candidate patterns with the number of fault items at each level. The FT-LevelWise algorithm divides all FT patterns into several groups, generates candidate patterns from both sides of each group, and applies some criteria to prune candidate patterns. Both algorithms extract the complete set of FT patterns. The experiments demonstrate the scalability of FT-LevelWise, which clearly performs much better than FT-BottomUp since it does not need to generate as many candidate patterns, with the database scanning time being half that of FT-BottomUp. By applying our algorithm on real data as shown in Section 4.2, two reported epitopes of spike proteins of SARS-CoV can be found in our resulting itemset and the proportional FT data mining is better than the fixed FT data mining for this application.",
