Vaccination can confer active and sustained protection, but the development of new vaccines is a slow process and vaccines are effective only in a preventive setting. The practice of administering polyclonal immunoglobulins from hyperimmune sera of animal or human origin, introduced by Behring and Kitasato1, has been used extensively in prophylactic as well as therapeutic settings2. However, there are several problems associated with the use of polyclonal sera, such as the antigenicity of heterologous proteins, the difficulty of finding immune donors, and risks related to the use of human blood products.",

Early work showed that human monoclonal antibodies can be produced by immortalizing B cells with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)4,5,6 or by fusing B cells with an appropriate partner to produce hybridomas7,8. However, these methods have very low efficiency and therefore alternative strategies have been developed. These include (i) humanization of murine monoclonal antibodies through protein engineering9, (ii) selection of antibodies from phage-display libraries of human antibody fragments10 and (iii) immunization of transgenic mice carrying human immunoglobulin loci, followed by production of monoclonal antibodies using hybridoma technology11. Although these methods have led to the development of several therapeutic monoclonal antibodies against cytokines or surface molecules, their impact on infectious disease therapy has been less pronounced12. Indeed, the number of therapeutic antibodies against infectious agents is still limited and only one is currently in use, to prevent respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in newborns13.",

Serum collected from the patient at different time points after infection scored positive in all three assays (see Supplementary Table 1 online), whereas sera from uninfected individuals were nonreactive. Antibodies detected by ELISA and staining of spike-transfectants were highest at 2 months after infection and decreased to about one-third by 8 months.

We found that the addition of CpG 2006 increases the efficiency of B cell immortalization from 1\u20132% to 30\u2013100%. Replicate cultures containing 10 IgG+ memory B cells were set up and culture supernatants were analyzed for the presence of specific antibodies after 2 weeks (Table 1). The fraction of cultures producing antibodies detected by ELISA was very high at 2 months after infection (virtually every second culture scored positive, consistent with a precursor frequency of \u223c1 in 20) and decreased by 6 and 8 months. The frequency of cultures producing antibodies staining spike-transfected cells could be measured only at the 4, 6 and 8 months time points and was lower but more sustained. Most supernatants that stained spike-transfected cells showed neutralizing activity, but overall there was poor correlation between staining and neutralization (see Supplementary Fig. 1). These results indicate that only a small fraction of memory B cells specific for SARS-CoV antigens are directed against neutralizing epitopes present on the spike protein.",

Some efficiently stained transfectants at low immunoglobulin concentrations, consistent with high-avidity binding, and showed a neutralizing titer proportional to the level of staining. In contrast, other antibodies stained poorly and only at high immunoglobulin concentrations, consistent with low-avidity binding, but showed efficient neutralization, even at immunoglobulin concentrations at which spike staining was hardly detectable.

The subsequent development of a spike-binding assay allowed much more rapid identification of neutralizing candidates and led to the isolation of antibodies with neutralizing capacity up to 300-fold higher. When neutralizing monoclonal antibodies were compared for spike staining and neutralizing activity, two patterns emerged (Fig. 2). Some antibodies showed high-avidity binding to spike transfectants and a neutralizing titer proportional to the degree of binding. In contrast, other antibodies showed low-avidity binding in spite of efficient viral neutralization. It is possible that the former recognize exposed epitopes within the receptor binding S1 domain of the spike protein, whereas the latter recognize epitopes within the S2 domain, which is exposed only during viral fusion and may be poorly accessible in transfected cells25. An alternative possibility is that spike molecules may be differentially assembled in viral particles compared to BHK cells. This may explain the lack of correlation between staining and neutralization, as well as the finding that most antibodies neutralized virus at concentrations at which staining was hardly detectable. Further studies, including assessment of direct binding to viral particles, analysis of escape mutants25 and epitope mapping using synthetic peptides, will be required to elucidate how antibodies to the spike protein neutralize SARS-CoV infection.",

This method offers two unique features: First, the antibodies are produced by immortalization of memory B lymphocytes, which are stable over a lifetime and can easily be isolated from peripheral blood. This bypasses the need for antigen boosting required for the generation of hybridomas. Second, the antibody is isolated from a primed natural host who has survived the natural infection, eliminating the need for immunization of experimental animals, which may show different susceptibility and, therefore, different immune responses. This method delivers large numbers of antibodies that can immediately be selected for the most favorable profile according to criteria such as affinity, epitope specificity and propensity to generate escape mutants.",
