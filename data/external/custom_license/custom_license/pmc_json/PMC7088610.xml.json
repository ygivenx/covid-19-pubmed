The rearing unit consists of 5 barns (5 m \u00d7 3 m) containing 20 to 25 heifer calves per barn. The animals are housed until 60 days of age and subsequently placed in pickets located near the barns where they remained from weaning period until the breeding by artificial insemination. This calf rearing unit receives Holstein female calves and crossed Holstein breed up 5 days old from 42 small dairy farms. Until weaning, the calves are fed calf milk replacer. Besides the compulsory control of brucellosis and tuberculosis and vaccination against foot and mouth disease, the health profile of each small dairy farming was unknown. However, vaccination of cows at the end of gestation to control neonatal calf diarrhea was not performed by any of the dairy herds. Additionally, the colostrum quantity, quality, and immune passive transfer were not monitored at the original 42 small dairy farms. Thus, dairy heifer calves with possible distinct immunological and health status were housed together in the same rearing unit. The dairy calf rearing unit has been regularly operating at 18 months. During this period, the average rate of diarrhea episodes varied from 17 to 22%, with the highest frequency of occurrence in calves between 2 and 3 weeks old.",
