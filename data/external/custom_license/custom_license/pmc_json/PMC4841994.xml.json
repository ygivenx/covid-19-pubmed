The MERS situation in the republic of Korea can be highlighted as evidence. To date, a total of 186 MERS-CoV cases, including 36 deaths, have been reported in the Republic of Korea (5). The outbreak in the Republic of Korea has been associated with health care facilities and all cases reported so far include healthcare workers caring for confirmed cases, patients who were being cared for at the same healthcare facilities as confirmed patients, and family members of confirmed patients (6, 7). Thus, infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in the health care facilities.

The main source of MERS-CoV has not yet been clearly understood. Although not established, the infection could be primarily zoonotic in nature, with limited human-to-human transmission. Molecular investigation indicated that bats in Saudi Arabia might play a role in human infection (10). Previous experience with animal and human coronaviruses and seroepidemiological studies from dromedary camels demonstrated a high prevalence of antibody reactive to MERS-CoV (3). Strains of MERS-CoV that contest human strains have been isolated from camels in Egypt, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia. These investigations supported a scenario of a virus reservoir in bats with a peridomestic animal such as the camel as intermediate host, which may in fact be the immediate source of human infection (11). Genetic sequencing data revealed a close link association between the virus found in camels and that found in human (12). These studies supported the hypothesis that camels or camel related products are the expected source of infection in humans (3).",

Of the 1,695 healthcare contacts and 462 family contacts of confirmed MERS cases, a positive result was obtained from 19 (1.12%) healthcare workers and 14 (3.6%) cases of family contacts. As a result, the rate of secondary transmission among family contact is higher than other contacts (19). Thus, Infection in the healthcare setting is an important risk factor for human-to-human transmission and close and prolonged contact with the index case seems to be a necessity for the disease transmission (20). Potential routes of transmission included respiratory droplets (was the most likely mode of transmission), with the possibility of direct or indirect contact and airborne transmission during aerosol-generating procedures as other possible routes of transmission (20). One study showed that many healthcare workers were involved in aerosol generating procedures, such as intubation (71.4%), airway suctioning (57%) and sputum induction (28.6%) (21).",

Since most cases of disease have been reported in the Middle East especially Saudi Arabia, the risk of returning Hajj pilgrims contracting and spreading MERS-CoV from Saudi Arabia is high (23) and owing to the nosocomial nature of the last outbreak, it is particularly important to identify cases and stop similar preventable tragic outbreaks, with training of the epidemiological determinants, molecular diagnostic tests and management in health care workers and reporting suspected and confirmed cases.
