A quantified CHIKV in vitro RNA transcript containing 9 \u00d7 1010 subgenomic RNA copies/\u03bcL was used as a noninfectious positive control. Additional measures were taken to provide proper primers and probes because these components are most vulnerable to variation when assays are adapted from protocols, e.g., because of synthesis errors or poor purification. Primers and probes were synthesized in large reference lots and stored centrally at an oligonucleotide factory. Samples of these lots were validated by the reference laboratory and confirmed to provide full sensitivity as achieved with the original primers used in developing the prototype assay (3). Recipients of protocols were invited to order and use aliquots of primers directly from the validated reference lot.",

Solutions were diluted in human fresh-frozen plasma, aliquoted (100 \u03bcL), and lyophilized. Test aliquots were reconstituted in 100 \u03bcL of water, and CHIKV RNA was quantified by RT-PCR (3). Lyophilized samples were shipped at ambient temperature to participating laboratories. Each shipment contained a coded panel of 9 CHIKV RNA positive\u2013 and 3 CHIKV RNA\u2013negative lyophilized samples with virus concentrations shown in Table 1. Participants were asked to test the material with any molecular assay routinely used for detecting CHIKV in human plasma or with the preformulated test. We requested test results and assay details (PCR formulations and extraction methods). A total of 36 sets of results were received by the study coordinator, including 3 double sets from 3 laboratories that used 2 methods each. One laboratory provided triple sets of results from 3 tests.",

Analysis of factors identified that this success was primarily due to the preformulated assay. In our earlier external quality assessments on detection of emerging viruses, many participants used diagnostic methods reported in the literature, which did not provide technical features such as real-time PCR (8,9,11). The assay distributed in this study was technically advanced, and its efficient adaptation was supported by providing quality-controlled oligonucleotides and controls. This in-house assay was readily implemented by a large number of laboratories. It improved diagnostic proficiency similar to the commercial assay distributed during the SARS epidemic (9). We showed that novel PCR diagnostics for emerging diseases can be implemented on an international scale. However, enhanced support by reference laboratories through efficient collaborative networks of laboratories is indispensable. Public health organizations should be encouraged by these data to strengthen and extend networking between diagnostic laboratory facilities.",
