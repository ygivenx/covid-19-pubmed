            "text": "With the availability of molecular diagnostics, viral respiratory infections (VRI) have increasingly been associated with hospital acquired infections (HAI) within NICU. They have been described in numerous outbreaks worldwide with a pooled analysis case fatality rate estimated at 13% [1]. Several studies have reported the incidence and outcomes associated with hospital-associated VRI (HA-VRI) within NICU settings. HA-VRI is associated with negative outcomes including prolonged hospitalization and need for respiratory support, and increased risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) [2\u20134]. The incidence rates reported varied widely from 1% [5] to 50% [2]. The variation in study designs was likely a contributing factor to this variation. Interpretation of the role of respiratory viruses in infants with respiratory disease and clinical changes resulting in evaluation for sepsis is complicated by the finding of respiratory viruses in asymptomatic infants. Given the conflicting results, the role of respiratory viruses in disease in this population remains unclear as is the decision by clinicians in the NICU about the criteria for testing for respiratory viruses.",

On the day he initially tested positive for HRV he had a decline in respiratory status requiring escalation of support to nasal CPAP and was then re-intubated within 10 days. Blood and urine cultures were negative. He continued to decline. Due to worsening pulmonary function and difficulty maintaining oxygenation 3 days prior to his death he had furosemide and dexamethasone added to his treatment regimen which consisted of broad spectrum antibiotics, chlorothiazide, sedatives, and paralytics. On the day of death, blood and urine cultures were repeated and respiratory samples obtained. The bacterial cultures were negative. A respiratory sample obtained from the endotracheal tube was positive for both HRV and coronavirus OC43.

The first infant positive for HRV was discharged home before the onset of the second infant identified with HRV who died before the identification of HRV in the third, over a span of 4 months, suggesting that these infections were not related to each other. An autopsy in the infant who died revealed pulmonary findings consistent with viral pneumonia and fluid obtained from the lower airways tested positive for HRV by PCR (see Fig. 2). The association of respiratory disease in the infants in this study with HRV is consistent with studies that have demonstrated a strong association between the presence of this virus and significant respiratory disease in infants born prematurely [10] and during their first year of life [11]. The study conducted by Steiner showed that premature infants infected with HRV experienced substantial respiratory compromise with 19% requiring mechanical ventilation [7]. Zinna et al. [4] found that 74% of HA-VRI diagnosed in the NICU over a 6-year period were associated with the detection of HRV and that these infants required significantly more respiratory support, had longer hospital stays, were more likely to require home oxygen, and their overall hospital cost was significantly higher.",

It is possible that our findings are limited by the method of testing for virus in the lab. The pooling of multiple patient specimens in the laboratory for initial testing and then testing individual specimens if the pooled specimens are positive may have under-estimated the true frequency of VRI in this population. The method was shown to be sensitive for detecting rhinovirus in our initial test when specimens were spiked with rhinovirus. However, a similar test was not done for all viruses. Low copy numbers of virus in individual specimens could have been diluted with the pooling resulting in a negative test. Selection bias may also have played a role in our results. All participants were enrolled by a single investigator, but study participants were enrolled only if their parents were available to consent. Parents were often not available within the enrollment window and their infants could not be enrolled.",

Infants in the NICU, particularly those who are premature with anticipated prolonged hospitalization and risk for BPD are at risk for significant morbidity and potential mortality with VRI. Our study supports the observation that these infections are associated with longer lengths of stay, increased need for respiratory support, more antibiotic exposure and BPD. Although the spectrum of symptoms and disease caused by VRI has not been clearly defined, and studies have suggested that detection of virus can occur in otherwise asymptomatic patients, our study demonstrated that four of the five infants testing positive for a respiratory virus occurred with the onset of new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Additionally, HRV which is the most prevalent respiratory virus detected and is frequently attributed to asymptomatic carriage or minor upper respiratory tract disease can cause significant morbidity and even mortality in premature infants especially those with BPD. This study supports the recommendation that the presence of respiratory viruses should be considered in infants born prematurely who at a minimum have new onset or worsening respiratory disease. Their detection is important both for determining the cause of disease in individual infants and to prevent outbreaks within NICU settings by implementing appropriate isolation precautions.",
