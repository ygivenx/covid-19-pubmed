However these viruses are not, at present, routinely tested in clinical settings due to a lack of knowledge on the significance of these viruses in causing severe disease. Some recent studies have indicated that respiratory virus co-infections increases disease severity [15, 16], however the pattern of co-infection between influenza A viruses and hCoV and hBoV and their association with severe disease has not been clearly elucidated. We designed primers and optimized a real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for identification of 15 coronaviruses and used the RT-PCR targeting the NS1 region of the hBoV described by Qu et al. [17] to investigate the patterns of co-infections between influenza A virus with hCoV and hBoV and their association with severe clinical disease.",

The optimum annealing temperature for the primers was 57 \u00b0C. At this temperature, the wells that contained coronavirus 229E and RNA template; gave the lowest threshold cycle (Ct value), (range 19\u201338), highest fluorescence signal (range 0.6\u201319.2), and the PCR product melted at 76.2 \u00b0C, which is within the Tm for coronaviruses PCR products (75.0 and 80.0 \u00b0C). Analytical sensitivity of the PCR assays was tested by seven 1:4 serial dilutions (104\u2013100) for the hCoV and eleven serial dilution (106\u2013100) for the hBoV. The hCoV assay was able to detect down to 2.6 copies/\u00b5l, whereas the hBoV was able to detect down to 4.9 copies/\u00b5l. Under optimum conditions, the duplicate samples gave reproducible results and the experiments were repeated three times giving a total number of 21 and 33 replicates. Our results compare well with previously published protocols of hCoV and hBoV. For example a SYBR Green RT-PCR assay for identification of hCoV, published in 2007, Escutenaair et al. [24] reported that their assay was able to detect down to 10 RNA copies/\u00b5l, whereas Vijgen et al. [25] pan-coronavirus assay (published in 2008) was far less sensitive with a lower detection limit of 5.0 \u00d7 103 RNAcopies per microliter sample, Adach et al. [26] (1 and 10 genome copies). Further, hBoV assay by Neske et al. [27] was able to detect up to 3.8 \u00d7 108\u20133.8 \u00d7 103 copies/\u00b5l and Lu et al. [28] (10 copies). Our assays were therefore of good analytical sensitivity and could be used in diagnosis of hCoV. Polyacrylamide gel results indicated that the size of the PCR products obtained from the coronavirus 229E and bocavirus was similar to the coronavirus and bocavirus inserts into the pEX-A plasmid vector (a picture of the PAGE result for coronavirus is provided in Fig. 2).\n\n",

Therefore the clinical usability of any PCR assay for the identification of all or most coronaviruses depends on its ability to amplify a region which is common to all coronaviruses (both human and human adapted animal viruses), and its sensitivity. The primers for coronavirus we designed target the replicase ORF1b nsp15 (XendoU/NendoU) uridylate specific endonuclease gene, which is highly conserved among all coronaviruses [21, 22] and we confirmed our results with a TaqMan probe. The quality of primers depends, among others, on their ability not to give nonspecific amplifications. Our primers for identification of coronaviruses did not give nonspecific amplifications as indicated by the melting curves. In addition, the hCoV standard curve experiments indicated that the hCoV RT-PCR assay was able to pick up to 2 copies/\u00b5l of human coronavirus RNA template, our assays results compare equally with those of a previously published SYBR green assay for coronaviruses [24\u201326]. We are therefore confident that it could be applied for diagnosis of coronaviruses in clinical settings subject to further experiments in statistically significant number of samples.",

In this study, single seasonal influenza A viruses were predominantly in adults >18 years old in agreement with our earlier published study [35]. Similarly a higher proportion of hCoV and hBoV co-infections were in adults 18 to 65 years old. This suggests high prevalence of hCoVs and hBoV among older patients. Comparatively the majority of other respiratory virus co-infections (RSV, RV, hMPV and hPIV1-3) were in children \u22645 years old (Table 2). Regarding seasonality of the viruses, almost all the respiratory virus single and dual infections in this study were identified in the winter season. This could be because we tested for hCoV and hBoV in samples that were positive for influenza A viruses and influenza viruses are known to circulate mainly during winter season. Our findings are in agreement with other studies [16, 36], which also reported dual or multiple respiratory virus infections mainly occur during winter season.",

Given the high co-infection rates for bocavirus reported by other studies [3, 12], probably more bocavirus infections could have been identified if all the 3,804 samples received at the MMPL between June 2011 and June 2012 were tested. A possibility of finding more coronaviruses could also not be ruled out. A review by Schildgen et al. [3] suggested that human bocavirus may be a bystander and not a real pathogen; one of the evidence to this hypothesis being frequently identified co-infecting with other respiratory viruses, and also it is mostly identified in low copy numbers. However, the results of this study indicate a trend towards the hypothesis that hBoV co-infection might promote hospitalization especially among patients >65 years old and >24 \u226445 years old. Further, a number of other factors; age, comorbidities, immune status, and bacterial co-infection, affect disease outcome [37\u201339]. However in this study we did not control for these factors as the datum did not have these variables. This may have affected our outcomes and this should be born in mind when interpreting our results.",
