For instance, bacterial spores are very difficult to kill, whereas the HIV virus is rather easy to eradicate on hard surfaces. Infectious prions (e.g., the causative agent in bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow disease) are not included in this group because the prion is technically not a cellular microorganism but rather a protein. At this time there are no documented chemical or physical agents that will inactivate these infectious proteins. Similarly, there is no registered germicide that can with certainty kill pinworm eggs, although a simple ammonia solution will kill the ova of other parasites (e.g., Cryptosporidium parvum2).",

The overhead lights were turned on in the morning and off at night 5 days a week, allowing for ~9 h of illumination per day. We locked the laboratory and left it vacant during the weekends. For a 70-day period we analyzed daily samples from the bottle and recorded the percentage of active sodium hypochlorite in the sample. Our results showed an initial decelerating curve of degradation of the percentage of active sodium hypochlorite.At 5 days, the solution measured 15.68% sodium hypochlorite; at 20 days it was 13.72%. At 35 days, the percentage was 12.74% with the rate of degradation substantially decreased.

Once known as oxidized water or peroxymonosulfates, peroxygen compounds have come to the laboratory animal care field as part of a search for products that are environmentally friendly and relatively low in toxicity for use around animals. Many of the peroxygen products leave no residuals and have excellent germicidal activities. Peroxygen products came to the forefront when foot-andmouth disease appeared in the United Kingdom in 2000. These products are very strong oxidizers, and their germicidal activity occurs quickly, that is, only a short contact time eradicates microbes. Peracetic acid is a peroxygen product. Hydrogen peroxide when used in the vapor phase is a sterilant.",
