Poliovirus is a nonenveloped positive single-stranded RNA virus, whose genome is approximately 7,500 bases in length. Poliovirus genome contains a 5\u2032-untranslated region (5\u2032 UTR), a coding region, a 3\u2032-untranslated region (3\u2032 UTR), and a poly(A) tail. The structural (VP4, VP2, VP3, and VP1) and nonstructural (2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, 3C, and 3D) viral proteins are produced after translation of the coding region and proteolytic cleavage of the polyprotein [1].",

OPV is the vaccine of choice since it has several advantages over IPV, such as: simplicity of administration, induction of mucosal immunity and neutralizing antibodies, and low cost. However, genetic instability of OPV is associated with adverse effects such as vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) and vaccine-derived polioviruses [2].",

Co infection of the intestinal cells of a vaccinated person with Sabin 1, Sabin 2, and Sabin 3 strains, and the mixed replication complexes locating at few preferential sites in the perinuclear region of the target cells, are facts that promote intertypic recombination [8]. Intertypic recombination between Sabin strains usually takes place at the nonstructural part of the genome and a high proportion of types 2 and 3 strains isolated from healthy vaccinated individuals and from VAPP patients, have been found to be recombinants [9\u201312]. According to previous studies, specific types of recombination junctions are located in certain genomic regions of clinical strains. Recombination junctions of Sabin 3/Sabin x type (x: Sabin 2 or Sabin 1) are mostly located in 2C genomic region, while recombination junctions of Sabin 2/Sabin x type (x: Sabin 1 or Sabin 3) are mostly located in 3D genomic region [10\u201314]. However, the underlying cause for the localization of specific recombination types in certain genomic regions remains unsolved. It has been proposed that RNA structural elements are responsible for the distribution of specific types of recombination junctions in each one of the 2C and 3D genomic regions [10\u201312, 14].",

Recombination junctions which were identified in 2C and 3D regions of clinical strains of this study, as well as recombination junctions which had been identified in 2C and 3D regions of clinical strains of previous studies were superimposed on the highly probable RNA secondary structure elements of 2C and 3D regions. Furthermore, we created a cell-culture based in vitro model, targeted in the production and isolation of Sabin strains whose recombination junctions were located in either 2C or 3D genomic regions. We created the in vitro model for two reasons, first, in order to check if the distribution pattern of recombination types which is observed in 2C and 3D genomic regions of clinical strains is also observed in cell-culture strains, and second, in order to gather more evidence about the role of the RNA structural elements in promoting recombination. Finally, we compared the results that refer to the correlation between recombination junctions and RNA secondary structure elements in 2C and 3D regions of clinical strains, with the respective results of the in vitro model.",

All possible combinations of a double infection were performed (Sabin 1\u2013Sabin 2, Sabin 1\u2013Sabin 3, and Sabin 2\u2013Sabin 3) in different six-well plates each time. In the sixth well of the plate, which was used as a negative control, maintenance medium (MEM Eagle\u2019s supplemented with 2% FCS) was added. After 1 h of incubation, the medium that contained unbound virus was decanted and 1 ml of maintenance medium was added in each well. Plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C until complete CPE was observed. Complete CPE appeared 24 h after infection of Hep2 cells, and the content of every well of the six-well plate was inoculated in ten wells of a 96-well plate (100 \u03bcl/well) (Sigma, Aldrich). In every well of the 96-well plate, there were, approximately, 104 Hep2 cells. Plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C until the appearance of a complete CPE (approximately, 24 h).",

Extraction of viral RNA and reverse transcription was performed as previously described [12]. In order to design primer pairs which detect only recombinant molecules in 2C and 3D regions, we generate sequence alignments for 2C and 3D regions of Sabin 1, Sabin 2, and Sabin 3 reference strains, using Clustalw. We searched in the alignments for regions of low homology among Sabin 1, Sabin 2, and Sabin 3 reference strains. Primer pairs were designed to anneal to these low-homology regions aiming to the amplification of only the recombinant molecules that would be produced from the in vitro model. Program PRIMER 3 (http://www.genome.wi.-mit.edu/genomesoftware/other/) was used for Tm calculation of primers and in order to check if the selected primer pairs accomplish certain criteria (e.g., no dimer formation, no self complementarity, etc). These primer pairs were design to detect only recombinant molecules in 2C and 3D regions of the poliovirus genome and were able to detect all possible types of recombination junctions in these regions (Online Resources 2 and 3). PCR mixture for each reaction was consisted of 3 \u03bcl cDNA, 2 \u03bcl of each primer pair (25 pmol), 5 \u03bcl dNTPs (10 mM), 5 \u03bcl 10\u00d7 reaction buffer (which contained MgCl2 up to a final concentration of 2 mM), 0.5 \u03bcl (2.5 U) Paq5000 DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, USA), and double distilled H2O up to a final volume of 50 \u03bcl. The reaction conditions are described in Online Resources 2 and 3 for 2C and 3D regions, respectively. A final extension step was carried out at 74\u00b0C for 5 min.",

Moreover, these identical RNA secondary structure elements were consisted of high probability base pairs and also belonged to the minimum free energy structure. Consequently, these base pairs as well as the RNA secondary structure elements present high-positive predictive values [21]. Furthermore, all recombination junctions of the in vitro model isolates were identified in regions where RNA secondary structure elements similar between the two recombining partners were located. In addition, these RNA structure elements presented high-positive predictive values. This fact adds more evidence about the role of RNA secondary structure elements in promoting recombination.

More specifically, two plus stranded RNA molecules form a heteroduplex, a hypothesis that is reinforced by recent studies which proved that the replication of poliovirus takes place in mixed replication complexes in which participate genomes that belong to different serotypes [8]. During the formation of the heteroduplex, base pairs are formed between the regions that belong to different recombining partners but have the potential to form high probability RNA structure elements which are similar between the recombining molecules. As a result, the heteroduplex in these regions is firmly established. It is probable that when the poliovirus RdRp in conjunction with the nascent negative strand reaches one of these firmly established regions of the heteroduplex, the 3\u2032 end of the nascent negative strand is detached from the first molecule which acts as template and is attached to the second molecule of the heteroduplex which will now act as a template. It is possible that the modest activity of 3AB poliovirus protein in destabilising the double stranded helix would be responsible for the detachment of the nascent negative strand from the first template-molecule, while the chaperone activity of poliovirus protein 3AB would be responsible for the attachment of the nascent negative strand to the second template-molecule [24]. Certainly, more experiments have to be done in order to fully clarify the proposed mechanism since there were regions bearing different RNA structural elements between the recombination partners, which also suffered recombination (Online Resources 6 and 7).\n",
