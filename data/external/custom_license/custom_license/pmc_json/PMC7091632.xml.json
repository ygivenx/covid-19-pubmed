Ferrets have a distinct niche in biomedical research and are hardy animals that thrive in the laboratory. Most research ferrets are males because females have estrus-related health problems1.",

Once the urethral opening has been dilated with the 24-gauge catheter, it becomes easier to insert and thread the urethral catheter that will be secured in place.
