            "text": "Frequent fatal coronavirus outbreaks in humans and animals have caused serious concerns in the healthcare sector, scientific community, and animal husbandry. First human outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 caused life-threatening atypical pneumonia in more than 8000 people in 26 countries with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 10% (Pillaiyar et al. 2015; Al-Tawfiq et al. 2014; WHO 2016b). Another lethal coronavirus outbreak emerged in the Arab peninsula countries in 2012 which was caused by what is now known as the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). From September 2012 to December 2016, 1864 laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases of infection in 27 countries with 659 mortalities (nearly four times higher CFR than SARS-CoV) have been reported (Al-Tawfiq et al. 2016; WHO 2016a). Coronavirus survivors after acute infections suffer from many health issues and require long-term medical assistance (Han et al. 2003; Ong et al. 2005; Chan et al. 2003; Leow et al. 2005; Siu 2016; Cha et al. 2016). In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, at least four other pathological coronaviruses (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63) are continuously circulating in humans causing relatively mild respiratory conditions that may in some instances escalate to severe pathological illnesses (Mackay et al. 2012; Carbajo-Lozoya et al. 2012; Simon et al. 2007). Coronaviruses have also caused deadly diseases in animals, leading to huge economic losses in the animal husbandry sector (Vlasova et al. 2014; Lee and Lee 2014; Sun et al. 2016). Moreover, high mutation and recombination rates in coronaviruses allow them to cross species barriers and adapt to new hosts more easily (Denison et al. 2011; Lau and Chan 2015).",

Like all coronaviruses, MERS-CoV contains two cysteine proteases (main protease and papain-like protease) which processes viral nonstructural polypeptides (Kilianski et al. 2013; Hilgenfeld 2014). MERS-CoV main protease (Mpro, also called the 3C-like protease, 3CLpro) cleaves at eleven sites, while MERS-CoV papain-like protease (PLpro) cuts at three sites on the nonstructural polypeptides and releases mature nonstructural proteins (Hilgenfeld 2014). Thus, MERS-CoV proteases make up a suitable target for antiviral therapies.",

Tyrosine emission maximum is less sensitive to its local environment compared to tryptophan. Indole ring in the tryptophan residues undergoes two isoenergetic transitions which causes polarity sensitivity, while tyrosine undergoes through a single electronic state (Ghisaidoobe and Chung 2014). During the course of protein unfolding, the polarity of fluorophore microenvironment changes, which in turn leads to changes in the maximum fluorescence intensity (I\nmax) as well as maximum fluorescence wavelength (\u03bb\nmax). Therefore, intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence emission is sensitive to the tertiary structure and detects subtle protein conformational changes in solution. It has been frequently used for the characterization of protein\u2019s conformational changes under different stress conditions (Kumar et al. 2005; Xiao et al. 2015).",

            "text": "A previous study analyzing the quaternary structure of MERS-CoV PLpro using analytical ultracentrifugation technique has shown that PLpro is found in the monomeric state (Lin et al. 2014). MERS-CoV PLpro contains ten tyrosine and five tryptophan residues (Fig. 2a). MERS-CoV PLpro consists of two domains: N-terminal ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain and a catalytic core domain. The N-terminal Ubl domain consists of 62 residues and contained one \u03b1-helix, one 310-helix and five \u03b2-strands. The substrate-binding region is solvent exposed and comprised of the right-hand scaffold (Lei et al. 2014). Three tryptophan residues (W93, 243 and 303) are buried, while W187 and W190 are surface exposed (Fig. 2b). Figure 3a shows the decrease in intrinsic fluorescence of MERS-CoV PLpro with increasing temperature. At low temperature (20 \u00b0C), highest fluorescent intensity (I\nmax) was observed with maximum fluorescence wavelength (\u03bb\nmax) at 343 nm, indicating an overall localization of all five tryptophans in the partially hydrophobic environment. As the temperature increases gradually from 20 to 90 \u00b0C, I\nmax decreased with major transitions occurring between 50 and 60 \u00b0C (Fig. 3a, b). Initially, \u03bb\nmax increased from 343 to 344 nm when the temperature was increased from 20 to 30 \u00b0C. As the temperature was increased further, a blue-shift in \u03bb\nmax with increasing temperature was observed, indicating conformational rearrangements in different temperature regimes. The major blue-shift in \u03bb\nmax was found between 50 and 60 \u00b0C (Fig. 3c). The 14-nm blue-shift of tryptophan fluorescence spectrum indicated that the microenvironment of the tryptophan residues is becoming more hydrophobic during thermal denaturation. MERS-CoVPLpro thermal unfolding is different from most other proteins. Commonly, protein unfolding fluorescence spectra are characterized by a long wavelength shift \u201cred-shift.\u201d But some proteins, including MERS-CoV PLpro, exhibit blue-shift upon denaturation (Slutskaya et al. 2015; Duy and Fitter 2006; Pattanaik et al. 2003). Pig pancreatic \u03b1-amylase showed red-shifted fluorescence spectra when chemically unfolded and showed blue-shifted spectra during thermal unfolding (Duy and Fitter 2006). Equine lysozyme first exhibits a blue-shift transition at lower temperature and red-shift above 50 \u00b0C (Morozova et al. 1991).\n\n",

Equal volumes of the supernatant were analyzed (Fig. 5). If MERS-CoV PLpro would undergo autolysis during the course of thermal incubation, we would expect to see the appearance of two or more bands of MERS-CoV PLpro fragments on SDS-PAGE gels or at least a decrease in the band intensity of MERS-CoV PLpro. We found that the intensity of MERS-CoV PLpro band was apparently unchanged, indicating that autolysis was not occurring during the thermal shift assays applied in this study. In another scenario, irreversible unfolding aggregates may form during thermal shift assay. If this is the case, then aggregated protein will be pelleted down upon centrifugation and band intensity would have decreased in the supernatant sample.

We employed DMS, a newly developed information-rich experimental technique, to obtain spectroscopic and thermodynamic data of melting temperature (T\nm) and van\u2019t Hoff enthalpy (\u0394H\nVH) (John and Weeks 2000; Greenfield 2006; Al-Ahmady et al. 2012). Temperature-induced secondary structural changes in MERS-CoV PLpro in the far-UV region were monitored to study thermodynamic parameters. Moreover, DMS also characterized thermal unfolding pathway and identified the number of folding intermediate species and their relative concentrations during the unfolding process (Malik et al. 2015, 2016). MERS-CoV PLpro was gradually heated from 20 to 94 \u00b0C at 1 \u00b0C/min increments and far-UV CD spectra were recorded from 200 to 250 nm. Far-UV CD spectra at several wavelengths were plotted as a function of temperature (Fig. 6a). MERS-CoV PLpro underwent a single thermal transition as a function of temperature, suggesting two-state folding. Similar transition was also observed in the thermal shift assay using fluorescence spectroscopy. In an earlier study, secondary structure content was calculated and it was found that \u03b2-sheet structure (31%) is dominant in MERS-CoV PLpro (Lin et al. 2014). Similarly, our results showed that MERS-CoV PLpro presented a single negative minimum at ~218 nm suggesting a predominant \u03b2-sheet structure as well. When MERS-CoV PLpro was gradually heated, secondary structure was lost and became irregularly disorder structure (Fig. 6b). The relative concentrations of folded and unfolded species as a function of temperature are shown in Fig. 6c. The thermal melting point (T\nm) and van\u2019t Hoff enthalpy (\u0394H\nVH) of MERS-CoV PLpro calculated using Global 3 analysis software were 54.4 \u00b1 0.1 \u00b0C and 317.1 \u00b1 3.9 kJ/mol, respectively. The thermal melting points (T\nm) of MERS-CoV PLpro calculated by thermal shift assay and DMS were found to be in close proximity, reflecting tertiary\u2013secondary structure unfolding events, respectively. In a recent study, papain-like protease of Murine Coronavirus also underwent a single thermal transition with a T\nm value of ~46 \u00b0C (Mielech et al. 2015). A three-dimensional model of the thermal transitions of MERS-CoV PLpro was generated using Global 3 analysis software (Fig. 6d). A single transition is clearly evident at lower wavelengths in the far-UV spectra region.\n",

            "text": "MERS-CoV PLpro was expressed in soluble state in E. coli and purified to homogeneity in two-step chromatography. Two orthogonal techniques were used for studying unfolding pathway that include the utilization of DMS and thermal shift assay. The results showed that MERS-CoV PLpro unfolds via a single thermal transition and follows a two-state unfolding pathway. Thermal shift assay calculated a T\nm value of 51.4 \u00b0C and DMS method calculated a T\nm value of 54.4 \u00b1 0.1 \u00b0C, in agreement with sequential unfolding events of tertiary and secondary structures, respectively. Similar folding behavior and thermal melting point were also observed in papain-like protease of Murine Coronavirus, indicating similarity in deubiquitinating enzyme scaffold. Next, we have planned to evaluate the effect of different factors such as pH and ionic strength on the folding, conformational stability, and protease activity of MERS-CoV PLpro. Such studies will facilitate in exploring the different stability profiles of the different conformations as well as in evaluating the environmental condition affecting higher-order structural states in an effort to develop antivirals.\n",
