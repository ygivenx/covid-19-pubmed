Each year, scientists have to create an updated version of the seasonal flu vaccine because these vaccines target the hemagglutinin head, which accumulates mutations as it passes in an endless chain from person to person. The stalk, however, is less variable, and Palese has believed for decades that targeting this part of the protein could form the basis of a universal flu vaccine that doesn't need to be updated every year. In his vision, a universal flu vaccine would elicit antibodies that react against the hemagglutinin stalks of many different strains of influenza, thus neutralizing a wide range of strains.",

Palese knew the immune system has a hard time generating antibodies against the stalk because the head is physically in the way, rendering the stalk invisible. A vaccine with 'headless' hemagglutinin proteins would get around this issue. His initial attempt didn't pan out as he'd hoped. The proteins Palese and colleagues made were too unstable. Yet Palese still believed the approach was sound2, although no one knew whether humans could even be stimulated to produce antibodies against the hemagglutinin stalk.",

The pandemic 'swine flu' virus appeared even as other, seasonal H1N1 flu strains continued to circulate. The arrival of the swine flu pandemic provided a perfect way for Palese to test whether humans could naturally produce antibodies against the hemagglutinin stalk. Although seasonal and swine flu strains were both H1N1 viruses, the hemagglutinin heads on these viruses were so different that antibodies generated against the seasonal flu strains didn't protect against swine flu, even though the stalks were broadly similar.",

Palese believed that antibodies against the hemagglutinin stalk played a major role in this switch. Mouse studies supported this hypothesis, as exposure to different strains of influenza triggered the production of anti-stalk antibodies. Other researchers had identified a potential segment of the hemagglutinin stalk where human antibodies might bind3. In work published in PNAS, Palese synthesized chimeric hemagglutinin proteins to show that infection with pandemic H1N1 after exposure to seasonal H1N1 influenza boosted the production of hemagglutinin stalk antibodies4. Since the seasonal H1N1 had faded in importance, Palese knew that the anti-stalk antibodies were powerful enough to protect against later H1N1 infection.",

Initial studies showed that the FLUTCORE approach protects mice from a range of influenza viruses7, and the group is currently raising money for clinical trials. Meanwhile, the pharmaceutical startup BiondVax, based in Ness Ziona, Israel, has just completed phase 2b clinical trials for its Multimeric-001 universal influenza vaccine.

McLellan specializes in coronaviruses, a large group of respiratory pathogens that includes the viruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). As in influenza, spike proteins stud the coronavirus membrane. As in influenza, the stalk of the spike protein changes far more slowly than the fast-evolving head. It got McLellan thinking that he might be able to try a similar approach to create stalk-based coronavirus vaccines.",

McLellan needed to find the parts of the coronavirus stalk that stimulate production of the most protective antibodies to make a better vaccine. Using monoclonal antibodies from individuals who had survived SARS or MERS, McLellan and virologist Mark Denison of Vanderbilt University identified the parts of the coronavirus spike protein most likely to elicit an immune response. The researchers then turned to a new technique that enabled them to flash freeze different viral particles in an array of orientations, bombard the particles with electrons and then use supercomputers to reconstruct their 3D shape down to a resolution of four angstroms. The technique, known as single-molecule cryo-electron microscopy, revealed the detailed shape of the stalk of the coronavirus spike protein, which McLellan could then use as a guide to build a protein subunit vaccine.",

So the researchers returned to their 3D diagram to start tweaking individual amino acids to create a MERS coronavirus vaccine that would have enough stability to elicit a strong immune response. In August, McLellan and colleagues published a paper outlining the construction of a stable engineered spike glycoprotein from MERS coronavirus8, although the team has yet to show whether it protects against coronavirus infection.",
