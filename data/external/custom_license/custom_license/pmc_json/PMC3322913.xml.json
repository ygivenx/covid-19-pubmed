Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal samples were collected by use of a single Dacron swab with a nonwooden shaft; the swab was then placed in a sterile vial containing 2 mL of viral transport medium. Stool specimens were collected in a sterile container and sealed. Participants provided a 50-mL clean-catch collection of urine in a sterile urine cup. Specimens were processed and stored according to CDC laboratory biosafety guidelines (15). All specimens were stored at 4\u00b0C for a maximum of 72 h and shipped on ice to the CDC laboratory.

Stool samples were prepared as 10% extracts in Tris-HCl buffer before isolation of total nucleic acid for RT-PCR testing. To quantify the virus load in respiratory and stool specimens, quantitative RT-PCR was performed using the TaqMan assay and standard curves generated from synthetic RNA transcripts (S. S. Monroe & R. S. Beard, unpub. data). Previously described culture techniques (2) were used to isolate SARS-CoV from specimens. To determine the S and N gene sequences of SARS-CoV, a set of 10 overlapping RT-PCR products, which cover the entire open reading frames of the S (8 products) and N (2 products) genes, were generated by using the SuperScript One-Step RT-PCR with Platinum Taq (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and sequenced by using 16 (S gene) or 7 (N gene) sequencing primers (S. Tong et al, unpub. data). Serum specimens were tested for SARS-CoV\u2013associated antibodies by use of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and an indirect fluorescent antibody test, using previously described methods (2). Serum specimens were considered positive only if results for both tests were positive using predetermined cut-offs (2).",

We detected SARS-CoV in fecal and respiratory specimens and found that SARS case-patients may have high concentrations of virus in stools during the 2nd week of illness and continue to shed the virus in feces until at least 26 days after onset of symptoms. The amount of SARS-CoV in stool from a case-patient with moderate diarrhea was similarly high to the quantity seen in a sputum specimen collected from a different case-patient at the same interval after illness onset. However, no virus could be cultured from any stool specimens that were PCR-positive for SARS-CoV, suggesting that SARS-CoV in feces may be present in the form of either nonviable viral particles or antibody-coated virus.",

Previously reported data suggest that the incubation period for SARS ranges from 2 to 10 days (4,17), but in some cases, the incubation period may be as long as 14 days (18). Therefore, the possibility remains that this contact may have been infected in Hong Kong. The remaining uninfected household contacts included four contacts of two case-patients with positive stool specimens in whose households simple infection-control procedures were implemented during the acute phase of illness in the index patient.",

This finding supports the idea that in certain circumstances, SARS-CoV is not easily transmitted.

All upper respiratory specimens in the first 2 weeks after onset were negative for SARS-CoV by RT-PCR; this finding differs from a report in Hong Kong, where viral RNA was detected in nasopharyngeal aspirates of 68% of case-patients at day 14 (21). Our inability to detect the virus in early respiratory samples may be associated with the type (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs versus nasopharyngeal aspirates) of collected specimens, as well as with low amounts of virus generally seen in such specimens (1). Sputum samples may have a higher concentration of virus than upper respiratory specimens (1), consistent with our findings. Stool specimens have been found positive more frequently than upper respiratory specimens during the 2nd and 3rd week of illness, which is in accord with the limited results of this study. The inability to detect SARS-CoV in urine may be the result of a late collection of urine specimens (>14 days after illness onset). A wider use of steroids in treatment of case-patients in Hong Kong compared with case-patients in the United States may have also altered the pattern of shedding of SARS-CoV.",
