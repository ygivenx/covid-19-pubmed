This can occur either at a plenary meeting of ICTV, held during an International Congress of Virology meeting, or by circulation of proposals by mail, followed by a ballot. Therefore, a list of proposals that had been subjected to the full, multi-stage review process was prepared and presented on the ICTVonline web pages in March 2008. This review process involved input from the ICTV study groups and subcommittees, other interested virologists, and the ICTV Executive Committee. For the first time, the ratification process was performed entirely by email. The proposals were sent electronically via email on 18 March 2008, to ICTV Life Members (11), ICTV Subcommittee Members (74), and ICTV National Representatives (53). Members were then requested to vote on whether to ratify the taxonomic proposals, within a 1-month deadline.",

As a means of promoting contact between ICTV and its National Members and to ensure that lists of members are up to date, member societies of IUMS are obliged to either renew ICTV National Members or replace them every three years. In effect, National Members have a 3-year tenure that can be renewed indefinitely. National Societies, which are members of the International Union of Microbiological Societies, are encouraged to contact ICTV directly through the ICTV Secretary with the names of their National Representatives.
