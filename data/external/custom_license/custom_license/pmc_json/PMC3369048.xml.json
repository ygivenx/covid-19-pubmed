Infection occurred after skin cut on the right leg with the fragment of the pig bone. Patient observed the presence of skin inflammatory process; subsequently, the process spread in the form of phlegmon of the right leg integuments. Patient was initially treated in the Department of Surgery and referred to the Orthopaedic Clinic due to skin phlegmon. Bacteriological tests revealed E. rhusiopathiae. Patient underwent drainage of the subcutaneous tissues. Targeted antibiotic therapy was implemented and continued for about 3 weeks after operation. As the family reported, patient reported back pain localised in the thoracic segment in the midline; nevertheless X-ray imaging of the spine was not performed, any local changes were observed within the paravertebral and superficial tissues. During admission and hospitalisation in the Neurosurgery Department, patient was suffered from glycaemia instability. As the normal levels of glycaemia were obtained, patient underwent operation. With regard to the process including distant vertebras and the risk of instability, double-level decompressing hemilaminectomy on the Th5\u2013Th6 level was performed. Pus cistern of paravertebral localisation was found immediately after the incision of fascia lata. Infiltration of vertebral arches, vertebral joints and spinous processes was also observed. After flavectomy, epidural empyema was observed inside the spinal canal. Flow drainage of the operation field was performed for 5 days. In the post-operational period, cephalosporin was intravenously administered. Cultures and fragments of excised tissues were taken for histological examination. Local culture samples were collected from the wound during chronic infection as well as blood culture samples at the stage of systemic symptoms. Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae were isolated. The patient was administered antibiotics based on culture outcomes and antibiogram. After spinal surgery, no pathological growth was observed in the collected samples\u2014negative cultures.",

The epidemiology of the phenomenon has been related to the areas of Far East Asia, actions aimed at the counteraction of the epidemic spread consisting in the mass liquidation of chicken farms constituting a natural reservoir of the epidemic have represented a particularly drastic view. The infections of avian influenza are caused by A H5N1 virus, whose reservoir in nature is wild fowl, the virus is transmitted easily to poultry and shows very high pathogenicity. On poultry farms it undergoes numerous modifications and can be pathogenic to humans. The virus is widespread in the world, it is found in many organisms, also in humans. In certain situations, it becomes pathogenic. Poultry farms, particularly in Asian areas, are thought to be the source of modification of avian influenza virus gaining the properties of a pathogen that is dangerous to human organisms. In such situations, the monitoring of poultry farming as well as quick identification of an infection in humans is of extreme importance. Even slight number of diagnosed infections caused by avian influenza in humans, sometimes unfortunately of very severe course, constitutes particular information about the virus pathogenicity and consequently leads to the decision of liquidating a given reservoir [11, 21, 26, 29, 47].",

This virus undergoes constant modifications. Infections in humans can be caused by the influenza virus that infects pigs and so far there have been such cases among persons having contact with animals, particularly among farm workers. However, recent infections found in the human clinic are mutated forms of viral infections where the virus contains elements of both human and avian influenza genome. In such situation, a pig farm can be the reservoir where a certain virus may undergo mutation and become dangerous to human and the infection course may be severe.",
