It can be seen from Figure 2a\nthat when fluorescently labeled primers were initially loaded into\nLAMP zones, primers were uniformly distributed in LAMP zones either\nwith paper or without paper inside.

We precoated LAMP primers of N.\nmeningitidis in LAMP zones with paper inside or without\npaper inside. The two kinds of ready-to-use microfluidic chips were\nstored at the same conditions in dark. LAMP reactions were performed\nwithin 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks, respectively. LAMP products were quantified\nby using Nanodrop after each LAMP reaction to evaluate the on-chip\nLAMP performance. As shown in Figure 2c, the\nnucleic acid concentration of LAMP product from LAMP zones without\npaper inside kept decreasing through the whole experimental period.\nA sharp decrease within the first 2 weeks was observed. At week 8,\nthe on-chip LAMP performance decreased by \u223c40%, which implied\nthat the devices without paper inside were not able to provide consistent\nresults over a period of time. Such devices without paper inside needed\nto be used right away. On the contrary, the on-chip LAMP performance\nfrom the device with paper inside remained stable within 2 months.\nOnly a slight decrease (less than 6%) over time was observed. Therefore,\nwe concluded that the introduction of paper in this hybrid microfluidic\nbiochip as a primer storage substrate also enabled stable on-chip\nLAMP performance and longer shelf life than those without paper inside.\nThis is mainly because (1) highly interwoven paper fibers can provide\nDNA primers a 3D protection matrix from harsh environmental elements,\nand thus are commonly used to collect samples for forensic DNA analysis.45,46 (2) DNA primers can be physically adsorbed onto paper fibers, avoiding\nDNA loss in the air in the form of aerosols.",

Although the\nqualitative analysis was sufficient for most diseases diagnosis, we\ndeveloped an indirect method for quantitative analysis of N. meningitidis, based on the versatile functions\nof the microfluidic chip. Before on-chip LAMP reactions, the DNA concentrations\nof a series of 10-fold diluted pathogen/ACSF lysate solutions ranging\nfrom 6 \u00d7 106 to 6 were quantified to obtain initial\nDNA copy numbers per LAMP zone by Nanodrop.

Thus, the calibration\nwas generated by plotting the DNA LAMP product concentration against\ninitial DNA copy numbers, as shown in Figure 6. It can be seen that the product DNA concentration is directly proportional\nto the log of the initial template DNA numbers, with an R2 of 0.98.
