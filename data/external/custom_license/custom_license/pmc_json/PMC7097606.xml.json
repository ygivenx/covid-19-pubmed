On March 1, WHO stated that China's State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) complies with international standards for vaccine regulation. As a result, vaccines coming from China now have the imprimatur of international recognition, both for exports and domestic sales, says Peicheng Liu, a spokesperson of Beijing Sinovac. But keeping up with international standards may erode China's price competitiveness. ",
