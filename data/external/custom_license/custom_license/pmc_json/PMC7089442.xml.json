Most of the incidence farms found the disease first in farrowing barns and subsequently 100 % mortality of newborn piglets. The disease was first reported in England in 1971 [4], and since then, outbreaks of the disease have been reported frequently in Europe and Asia [5\u20137]. Since 1990s, the disease has continuous outbreak in pig farms of 26 major cities and provinces in China, causing tremendous economical losses to the swine industry [8].",

The genome consists of a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA, with 27\u201332 kb in size, which can transcribe into several subgenomic mRNAs, and encode structure or non-structure proteins in a conserved order [11]. The polymerase gene, which covering 70 % of the genome, encodes the replicase polyproteins. The genes for major structural proteins including the membrane protein (M), the phosphorylated nucleocapsid protein (N), the small membrane protein (sM), and the spike protein (S) are located downstream of the polymerase gene [11].",

Although there were so many mutations in this segment, the first unique characteristic was the deletion in the sM gens of CH/GSJIII/07 and P55. Compared to CH/GSJIII/07, P55 was found to be more viable due to the existence of insertion within the C-terminus domain, the unique point mutations and less asparagine (N)-linked glycosylation sites. The long deletion of sM gene, which was also found in the field strain DR13 (Accession number: JQ023161) and its attenuated strain (Accession number: JQ023162) [25], led to reduced pathogenicity and induced protective immune response in pigs [24]. Remarkably, similar results were found in P55 and there were no significant mutations found in the sequences of other structural protein genes including M, N (data not shown), and S gene, whether the mutated strain reduced its pathogenicity or not needs further study. The loss of sM resulted in attenuation of the virus in the natural host. However, we found that the PEDV with long deletion of sM gene also caused typical clinical signs of PEDV infection, the pathogenesis mechanism of the virus and how the sM mutant strain comes from also need to be clarified. In general, the variation in sM gene may determine the different epidemiologic infection mechanism of the strain.",
