In infancy, there is a high risk of respiratory tract infections (RTIs), mainly from viruses and bacteria. Early protection against many infectious diseases comes from the mother through the transportation of maternal antibodies via the placenta in pregnancy and by breast milk after birth. The immune system gradually matures during infancy, and vaccinations come to stimulate the protective immune responses. Vitamin D is believed to have a major role in the improvement of immune function and reduction of inflammation. Its active metabolite 1,25(OH)2D (calcitriol) has been documented to mediate in the innate and adaptive immune systems and triggers effective antimicrobial pathways against bacterial, viral, and fungal pathogens in the cells of the innate immune system [1].",

An electronic search was conducted to identify studies from 2008 to 2018 by using the following databases: PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar.

This metabolite in the circulation is a marker of 25(OH)D status.

Its production is tightly feedback-regulated and its main role is in the regulation of calcium/phosphate and bone homeostasis through genomic activation of a number of genes in its target tissues (intestine, bone, kidney, and parathyroid gland).",

Regulation of transcriptional activity is cell-specific, such as 1,25(OH)2D, which inhibits PTH secretion but promotes innate immunity and insulin secretion and inhibits adaptive immunity [7, 8]. Due to the wide distribution of the VDR in cells and tissues, the biologic action of vitamin D extends to many systems, including the adaptive and the innate immune systems [9\u201311]. Since the VDR is expressed in various immune cells, including B, T, and antigen-presenting cells, they are believed to have roles in the improvement of immune function and reduction of inflammation [12]. The discovery, moreover, that vitamin D induces antimicrobial peptide gene expression explains, in part, the \u201cantibiotic\u201d effect of vitamin D and has greatly renewed interest in the ability of this vitamin to improve immune function. Current research indicates that this regulation is biologically important for the response of the innate immune system to infection and that deficiency may lead to suboptimal responses to bacterial and viral infections [13].",

Additionally, they found that supplementary vitamin D treatment in the deficiency cases could decrease the rate of recurrent OM during the 1-year follow-up period. They concluded that coadministration of supplementary vitamin D together with conventional treatments is appropriate in the management of URTIs such as otitis media. The study by Marchisio et al. involved children with a history of recurrent AOM. Half the children randomly received orally 1000 IU daily of vitamin D, and half received placebo over a period of 4 months. Children who received vitamin D supplement raised their serum 25(OH)D levels \u2265 30 ng/mL and significantly reduced their number of uncomplicated AOM compared to those on placebo, who also had significantly lower levels of serum 25(OH)D at the end of the study period.

This may be proof that vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency, at least in part, contributes to the pathogenesis of several infectious diseases of the respiratory tract in childhood. In addition, from the available evidence, normal to high serum 25(OH)D status appears to have some beneficial influence on the incidence and severity of some, though not all, types of these infections and could therefore be an effective and inexpensive mode of prophylaxis against these infections.",

So far, successful outcomes have been reported in children with TB and those with a history of recurrent AOM and bronchiolitis, whereas no benefit was found in children with pneumonia. Conflicting results were found as regards influenza, while there have been no studies at all on pharyngotonsillitis and rhinosinusitis. Another perspective could be maternal vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy and breastfeeding in order to reduce future RTIs in offspring, though the ideal dose of supplementation is still difficult to define.",

No public health policies have been put into practice for supplementation regarding common RTIs in childhood. Recommendations for vitamin D supplementation in the general population depend on the characteristics of each country and cannot be applied uniformly, even throughout Europe. These characteristics include skin type, weather, and dietary and dressing habits, all of which may influence the decision of health professionals as to the recommended dose of supplement in every individual infant patient. As a result, most countries in Europe and elsewhere establish their own recommendations.",
