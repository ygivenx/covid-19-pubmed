But when it comes to the more prosaic matter of taking elementary precautions against the palpable economic and public-health risks posed by bird flu, the world's most ebullient industrial power is pleading poverty.",

China can point to the resource requirements of its own mitigation strategies as a reason for its reluctance to send money abroad. But this explanation would carry more weight if the country had put convincing strategies in place and openly shared information and biological samples with the outside world. So far, it has failed to do so.",

Needy countries at high risk of exposure to the virus, such as Indonesia and Cambodia, urgently require help in setting up such systems.",

Collating accurate information about the virus populations circulating in these birds is a considerable challenge. Outsiders like to accuse Chinese government officials of cover-ups, but the reality is often that the officials themselves don't know what is happening on the ground.",

It has taken years for the government to formulate a response to the HIV epidemic that has been emerging before its eyes. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) first appeared in China in November 2002, but it took months for Beijing to learn of the problem, acknowledge it and orchestrate a response. And with regard to bird flu, officials last summer claimed to be unaware that the widespread misuse of antiviral drugs by Chinese chicken farmers had already rendered them virtually ineffective (see Nature\n435, 1009; 2005).",

Last spring, for example, foreign scientists were allowed only limited access to sites of early outbreaks of bird flu in western China.",

The outbreak of SARS was supposed to have demonstrated that this approach is no longer good enough. There are indeed signs that some lessons have been learned. Public-health provision has improved in the affected areas, and investigations into the disease have strengthened some aspects of Chinese biomedical research (see China: Open season).",

China should speed up this process for avian flu, making samples and genetic data for circulating strains immediately available. Access to outbreak areas should also be granted to international teams seeking epidemiological data. Data and samples from strains that have crossed over to humans also need to be shared. So far, this hasn't been happening. China's response to bird flu has been a mixture of secrecy and parsimony that does little to serve the interests of its farmers or its people, and is not becoming of an emerging world power.",
