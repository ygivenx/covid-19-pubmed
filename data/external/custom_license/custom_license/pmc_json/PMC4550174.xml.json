Specimens collected were as follows: 185 upper respiratory, 10 lower respiratory, 98 urine, 97 blood, 11 fecal, and 1 pleural fluid. Symptom onset varied from 17 days before return to 10 days after return (median <1 day after return) for the 20 PUIs for whom this information was supplied. One patient was excluded from the time-to-collection analysis because the specimen was collected under extenuating circumstances: testing was conducted because of worsening respiratory symptoms beginning 57 days before the patient returned from overseas.",
