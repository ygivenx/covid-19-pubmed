The primary antibody specific for a particular viral protein was\ndiluted 1,000-fold in blocking buffer (1\u00d7 PBS with 3% BSA) and\nadded to each well of the assay plate. The assay plates were incubated for 60\nminutes at room temperature. The primary antibody was removed, and the cells\nwere washed 3 times with 1\u00d7 PBS.

The resultant cell number and percent\ninfection were normalized for each assay plate. The Z\u2032 values for all\nantiviral assays were >0.3. Analysis of dose response curve was performed\nusing GeneData Screener software applying Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (LMA)\nfor curve fitting strategy.
