On the other hand, it is crucial that those children who may experience clinical deterioration are not discharged. Among those sent home with a diagnosis of bronchiolitis, 4.6\u20136.8% required hospitalization later on during infection (9,10). Clinical prediction models may help clinicians to distinguish RSV-infected children requiring hospitalization from those who can be safely sent home. To date, mainly clinical parameters have been used to predict the severity of disease in RSV infection (11,12). Several studies have associated severity of RSV disease with particular cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-8, IL-6, IL-4, and interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 (13,14,15,16). A change in plasma or nasopharyngeal levels of these cytokines early in the host response can be used as early markers for severity of disease. The addition of inflammatory parameters may improve the prediction of disease severity in children with RSV infections.",

A decrease in T cells may therefore result in lower CCL-5 levels. However, the discrepancy between T-cell counts and CCL-5 levels during recovery in the moderate and severe groups suggests that the lower T-cell counts cannot completely explain the lower CCL-5 levels during severe RSV infection. Other mechanisms such as an inadequate or suppressed T-cell response may play a role. Infection-induced immune suppression is a well-established phenomenon and has been described in sepsis, measles, and chronic viral infections (30,31,32). The immature immune system of infants can also result in a reduced immune response. Controversial results have been published on changes in CCL-5 levels during the first months of life, and we cannot exclude that higher CCL-5 levels reflect functional maturation of the immune system (33,34). However, in infants within 3 mo of birth, we still observed significantly lower CCL-5 concentrations in ventilated infants than in nonventilated infants.",

Another important consideration regarding markers for disease severity is that they do not have clinical implications at this moment, because currently no antiviral treatment is available. However, newly developed antiviral treatment of patients will be based most likely on diagnostics predicting disease severity and susceptibility (37,38). For the evaluation of intervention studies, such as vaccination and antiviral treatment, markers for disease severity will be valuable. Furthermore, given that we focused on the discrimination between ventilated and nonventilated children, studies need to be undertaken to determine whether this set of biomarkers could also discriminate between children requiring hospitalization and those who can be discharged.",

Depending on the number of cells, 50 \u00b5l of cell suspension containing maximally 1 \u00d7 106 nucleated cells was incubated with 50 \u00b5l fluorochrome-labeled monoclonal antibodies (final dilution 1:20) for 15 min in the dark at room temperature. Combinations of mAb conjugates were used for CD3, CD4, CD8, CD56, CD45, CD14, and CD19 (Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL). Cells were enumerated by using flow-count counting beads (Beckman Coulter). Staining of cells was determined by using a Fc500 flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). Data were analyzed using the CXP software (Beckman Coulter).",

Extracellular staining of surface markers CD14, CD16.56, CD3, CD4, and CD8 was performed in 96-well microtiter plates. For intracellular cytokine staining (IL-4 and IFN-\u03b3), PBMCs were stimulated with \u03b2-mercapto-ethanol, phorbol myristate acetate (10 ng/ml), golgistop, and ionomycin at 37 \u00b0C for 4 h. Then, staining of surface markers CD3, CD4, and CD8 was performed. Thereafter, cells were fixed, permeabilized with 0.5% saponin and 0.5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, and stained for intracellular IL-4 and IFN-\u03b3. Samples were acquired immediately after staining on a BD FACSCanto (Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany) and analyzed using flow cytometry analysis software (FlowJo analyses 7.6, Three Star, Ashland, OR).",
