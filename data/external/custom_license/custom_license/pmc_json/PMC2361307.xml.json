Changes in cell morphology were observed in 1F6 cells overexpressing both the 18kD and ALL bFGF isoforms. In contrast to 1F6 cells, which are large cells with numerous dendritic cell processes, 1F6-18kD and 1F6-ALL cells appeared smaller, were more rounded and formed less dendritic cell processes. In addition, significantly accelerated in vitro and in vivo growth rates up to, respectively, two- and three-fold were observed in 1F6 cells and tumours overexpressing either 18kD or ALL bFGF isoforms (Fontijn et al, unpublished data).

High expression of CD13 in bFGF-transfected 1F6 clones was confirmed on the protein level by Western blot (Figure 2C).

High concentrations of bestatin (150\u2013300 \u03bcM) clearly reduced invasion of HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells and WM1158 melanoma cells through Matrigel (Menrad et al, 1993; Fujii et al, 1996).

We now show that both CD13 promoters can be activated in response to bFGF overexpression.

We do not know if the current results are specific for melanoma cells, or whether the use of the more sensitive techniques would also allow to detect upregulation of both promoters in other cell types.

Upon transfection of CD13 into A375M and A2058 melanoma cells, increased degradation of type IV collagen and invasion in ECM have been observed (Fujii et al, 1995). These CD13-transfected cells showed a significantly augmented lung-colonising potential in nude mice (Fujii et al, 1995). The observations are in agreement with our data that 1F6 cells could hardly invade through Matrigel, but their invasive capacity is greatly facilitated in the case of CD13 overexpression. As proof of concept, in our panel of human melanoma cell lines, we found a clear correlation between bFGF and CD13 mRNA and protein expression (Figure 9). High bFGF and CD13 protein expression could be detected in melanoma cell lines BRO and BLM, being aggressive cell lines on the basis of a high in vitro and in vivo growth rate.

            "text": "Bestatin has been studied for its therapeutic usefulness in the clinic in the past, since the compound was considered to have immunopotentiating activity (Ota, 1991). In a prospective randomised trial in adult nonlymphocytic leukaemia, prolongation of remission duration and survival was achieved with bestatin added to maintenance chemotherapy in elderly patients (Ota et al, 1986). Prospective randomised clinical trials in various solid tumours contained either too few patients or were negative to demonstrate a beneficial effect on survival (Ota, 1991). In a recent, randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial by Ichinose et al (2003), bestatin was given for its aminopeptidase inhibiting, immunostimulant and antitumour activity to patients with completely resected stage I squamous-cell lung carcinoma. Of the 402 patients that entered the study, it appeared that the overall survival and cancer-free survival were both significantly different in favour of the bestatin-treated group. Since we found a clear correlation between bFGF and CD13 expression and invasiveness of melanoma cells, the incorporation of bestatin in a clinical trial in stage II melanoma patients should be considered with the aim of preventing the development of metastases and to improve survival.",

Selective inhibition of CD13, or even of bFGF itself, should therefore be an attractive strategy for the treatment of advanced melanoma, but likely also for adjuvant treatment in stage II disease.",
