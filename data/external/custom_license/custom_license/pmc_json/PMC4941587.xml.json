However, the convenience no\u2010mask group was not a randomized control arm and hospitals in this group were actually selected on the basis that most of their staff did not wear masks (which is not the norm in hospitals in Beijing), suggesting that conditions in those hospitals were different than those in hospitals from the masks groups. As a consequence, it is not possible to make any definitive judgement on the efficacy of masks on this basis. One possible bias would be if those hospitals had differentially higher risk of infection compared to the intervention hospitals, for example because of the occurrence of outbreaks. However, we monitored all hospitals involved in the study for outbreaks which may have increased apparent attack rates, and none were documented. Other than that, possible sources of bias that could have plausibly increased the infection rate in the control arm (namely vaccination, handwashing, hospital level and high\u2010risk procedures) were measured. In a post hoc adjusted analysis, only hospital level and the N95 arm were significant against CRI and laboratory\u2010confirmed viral infection.",

A recent, smaller trial found no difference between N95 and medical masks, but was probably underpowered to detect any differences.\n11\n Further, the intervention in that study was use of respiratory protection only during care of identified febrile patients with ILI or high\u2010risk procedures. This is different from the intervention in our study, which comprised wearing the mask for the entire shift. In addition, that study measured serological evidence of influenza as an outcome, which comprised the majority of outcomes, but did not exclude influenza\u2010vaccinated participants, a flaw that would have resulted in false\u2010positive cases of \u2018influenza\u2019.",

Scoping work with Australian HCWs showed compliance of 10% with continual mask wearing during a severe influenza season.\n24\n Beijing was selected to maximize the power of the study because of the strong culture of mask wearing among HCWs. Another limitation of the study is that cluster RCTs can be impacted by heterogeneity of behaviours, meaning that we cannot exclude such effects caused by behaviours we did not measure. The cluster design is also strength, as interventions against infectious diseases can have herd effects. In infectious diseases which can spread from person to person, the \u2018herd effect\u2019 is a real and documented phenomenon where protecting some individuals with an intervention (most commonly vaccination, but also applicable to other interventions) can also protect individuals who were not protected by the intervention. Therefore, if some individuals are randomized to masks on a ward, the individuals who do not wear masks may also be protected because of the effect the masks have on interrupting the transmission of disease from person to person. This is why it is preferable to use cluster design, where everyone in the cluster gets the same intervention.",

There is currently no evidence on how much of a HCWs\u2019 risk is unidentified or unrecognized.

This suggests that discomfort is not the primary driver of adherence, and rather, cultural acceptability and other behavioural factors may be the main reason for non\u2010adherence. The past experience of Beijing health workers with SARS may also be a factor in the high adherence. This level of adherence may not translate to Western cultural contexts in a normal winter season, especially for N95 respirators; however, adherence can change with perception of risk. During a pandemic, we would expect HCWs to have higher adherence to infection control measures. In summary, our study adds evidence on the use of respiratory protection for HCWs, but highlights the need for larger trials and comparison of different policy options.",
