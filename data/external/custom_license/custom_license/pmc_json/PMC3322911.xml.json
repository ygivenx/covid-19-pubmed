Fifty-six deaths were reported, and >100,000 people fled Surat, a city of approximately 2 million.

These documents were disseminated through an automated fax information service, a voice information service, and a telephone hotline, as well as traditional print media. The fax service reported that 5,589 documents were requested regarding the plague outbreak.",

Kennedy International Airport on flights from India), the departments of health in New York City and New York State supplemented CDC\u2019s surveillance plan by using two approaches to disseminate information to heighten awareness of plague, focusing on emergency department physicians. First, a fact sheet was transmitted by fax or electronic mail to emergency department physicians and infection-control practitioners at 102 hospitals in New York City and to all acute-care hospitals and county health departments in the state. Second, a special plague advisory was distributed to 20,000 physicians in New York City (3).",

Because information was rapidly evolving, guidelines needed to be flexible. The \u201cinterim\u201d document, one that required constant updating, became the norm. The Internet became a primary tool for communication, as it has been for CDC travelers\u2019 health information. In fact, before the SARS outbreak, the travelers\u2019 health Web site (located within the CDC Web site; available from: URL: www.cdc.gov\\travel) had become the most frequently visited CDC Web site other than the home pages, with more than 3.6 million visits recorded in 2002 (Figure 1). Visits to the Web site increased dramatically in 2003. As of July, >4 million visits had been recorded to the travelers\u2019 health Web site; more than 1 million of these visits resulted from accessing SARS-related content (travel alerts and advisories). Although the target audience for this Web site is in the United States, approximately one third of the visits were from other countries. In May, the city from which the most visits originated was Taipei, Taiwan, with more visits than any city in the United States. The SARS-related documents were not posted in multiple areas on the Web site but could be accessed by navigating through the Web site using different routes. Data from Web-tracking software showed that approximately 83% of visitors came from a commercial or .net domain, 10% from educational domains, 3% from .org domains, 2% from government domains, and 1.5% from military domains.",

This material was written for multiple audiences, from highly technical to low literacy, and was disseminated through multiple platforms, from traditional print (e.g., >2,700,000 yellow Health Alert Notices were handed out by Quarantine Officers to passengers disembarking from 11,840 flights from areas with SARS) to electronic (postings on Web sites and CDC\u2019s Secure Data Network).",

Its purpose is to provide information to travelers and resident expatriates about the status of an outbreak, how to reduce their risk for infection, and what to do if they become ill. The risk for individual travelers is thought to be definable and limited. In contrast, a travel advisory recommends against nonessential travel to an area because the risk to travelers is considered to be high as a result of ongoing transmission or inadequate containment. The travel advisory not only provides information about the status of an outbreak, but also is intended to reduce risk for exposure by decreasing the volume of traffic to the affected area.",

Institution of either an alert or advisory was dependent on the magnitude and scope of the outbreak, the containment measures being used, the quality of surveillance in the affected area, and the quality and accessibility of medical care, all of which are based on reports from the involved countries. Once instituted, downgrading an advisory to an alert required adequate surveillance and no evidence of ongoing transmission for at least two incubation periods after the date of onset of symptoms in the last case (for SARS, 20 days). Removing an alert was dependent on the above criteria, as well as lack of evidence of new cases for three incubation periods (for SARS, 30 days) and no exportation of cases, as determined by an assessment of the information reported from the countries involved.2",
