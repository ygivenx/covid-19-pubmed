            "text": "Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is an enveloped virus with a single-stranded RNA genome, which belongs to the genus Pestivirus, family Flaviviridae, and is distributed worldwide [1]. BVDV causes significant economic losses to the dairy and beef livestock industries, which are attributed to morbidity, mortality, growth retardation, reduced milk production, premature culling, reduced reproductive performance, and increased occurrences of other diseases [2, 3]. The two currently recognized BVDV species are BVDV-1 and BVDV-2, and they were recently renamed Pestivirus A and B, respectively [4, 5]. BVDV-1 is the most genetically diverse, with 21 subtypes (BVDV-1a through u) currently recognized, while 4 subtypes (a\u2013d) have been described for BVDV-2 [6\u20139]. More recently, the Pestivirus HoBi-like virus has been proposed as a new BVDV species (BVDV-3 or Pestivirus H) based on antigenic and genetic similarities [4, 5, 10, 11].",

In Uruguay, the first evidence of BVDV circulation dates from 1996 [21]. A serological study revealed that BVDV exposure is widespread in beef cattle throughout Uruguay [22]. More recently, active BVDV infections and circulating species and subtypes were explored in cattle herds with reproductive problems, and BVDV-1a was revealed as the predominant species/subtype, followed by BVDV-1i and BVDV-2b [18].",

A commercially available anti-BVDV monoclonal antibody isotype IgG2a produced in mice (catalogue D89, VMRD, Pullman, WA, USA) was applied as the primary antibody for 45 min at a 1:20 dilution. An anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (HRP)\u2013labeled polymer (EnVision+ HRP goat anti-mouse IgG, K4001, Dako) was used as the detection system, with 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (AEC no. 3469, Dako) as the substrate chromogen. A FFPE section of archived intestine from a naturally infected calf that tested positive for BVDV by RT-PCR and IHC was used as a positive control. For the negative controls, serial sections of all tested tissues were processed in parallel as described above, but the primary antibody was replaced with normal mouse serum (NC499L, Biocare Medical) at the same dilution.",

PI cattle are viremic, lifelong viral shedders, and immunotolerant to the NCP strain with which they are infected because their immune systems do not recognize the BVDV antigens as foreign, thus leading to extensive viral replication in the target cells [13, 27]. In our case, viremia was confirmed by identifying BVDV-1a in the serum, while IHC allowed detecting abundant viral antigen in the alimentary tract tissues (esophagus, small, and large intestines), which showed typical MD lesions. MD occurs in PI animals when the NCP BVDV strain is converted to the cytopathic biotype via mutation, recombination, and/or genomic rearrangements. Generally, the NS2/3 viral protease containing the NCP strain is cleaved to NS2 and NS3 in the cytopathic strains [12, 28]. This results in a devastating infection that destroys the host cells, to which the animal\u2019s immune system cannot respond [13].",

This reinforces the idea that PI animals can remain asymptomatic in the herds for more than 2 years, perpetuating infection and disease. In BVDV PI cattle, IHC should show strong positive immunolabeling in all or most tissues/organs, since infection in these animals is disseminated/multisystemic, and the tissues usually contain high viral loads [29].

Abortions at 6\u20138 gestational months identified as cases 2 and 8 in this work were most likely caused by N. caninum given the nature of the fetal lesions, which were typical of this protozoan, and its intralesional detection via IHC in the brain/myocardium as well as by PCR in the brain in both cases. However, coinfections with BVDV-1a (case 2) and BVDV-2b (case 8) were identified by RT-qPCR/sequencing, indicating a congenital/transplacental circulation and transmission of both viral species/subtypes in these fetuses. Because fetuses infected with NCP BVDV strains before the 4th gestational month are generally immunotolerant to the virus and therefore develop persistent infections, the viral load in PI fetal tissues is usually high and detectable by IHC [29]. In contrast, in our fetuses (cases 2, 7, and 8), the virus was undetected by IHC, although it was identified by RT-qPCR, suggesting that the viral load may have been below the IHC detection limit and indirectly suggesting that these fetal infections were transient/acute. The roles of BVDV-1a and BVDV-2b infections as causes of abortions in these cases could not be determined. Interestingly, in a study conducted in dairy cattle, BVDV-induced immunosuppression was hypothesized to contribute to the occurrence of abortions due to N. caninum [31], although more detailed investigations are needed to confirm the possible synergistic association between these agents [32].",

Additionally, antigenic immunolabeling in the fetal tissues was more intense for BVDV-2 than for BVDV-1b [29]. In the 3 fetuses evaluated in our study, BVDV immunolabeling was negative in all analyzed tissues, independent of the infecting viral species/subtype. This finding suggests that the fetuses were not PI, but rather were acutely/transiently infected, which may or may not have contributed to abortion due to N. caninum in cases 2 and 8 as discussed previously. When infection occurs in the last third of gestation, the fetal bovine immune system is sufficiently developed to respond to the virus, being comparable with a transient postnatal infection [35, 36]. Serological assays to assess whether these fetuses had developed specific humoral responses to BVDV were not performed in our study.",

This is directly related to introducing PI animals that can carry the infection or new viral strains into the herds [38\u201341]. In 3 of the outbreaks reported here (outbreaks 3\u20135), the anamnestic information revealed that cattle from different origins were introduced and mixed into the herds without prior BVDV testing, which possibly contributed to disseminating and spreading infection and disease between farms. Detecting and removing infected cattle from the herds is key in controlling BVDV infections.",

The arteriolitis observed in case 3 is a lesion frequently found in BVDV cases [13], whereas it is not a typical finding in salmonellosis [52], the agent with which this calf was coinfected. This case presented typical lesions of both agents, and although Salmonella typhimurium can cause disease and death by itself, it also behaves as an opportunistic pathogen, and thus, in this case, the BVDV may have predisposed to clinical salmonellosis. Additional evidence of transient/acute infection in these cases included detection of intralesional BVDV antigens by IHC in only some of the calf tissues examined by this technique.",

The major glycoprotein E2 is the most variable and immunodominant glycoprotein in BVDV, and as such, some strains may not bind to this antibody [54]. Our results indicated that this procedure enabled identifying at least four Uruguayan field strains: three BVDV-1a strains from outbreaks 1, 4, and 5, and one BVDV-2b strain from outbreak 3. However, additional cross-neutralization studies should be performed to assess whether this antibody cross-reacts with other local field BVDV strains, since reduced reactivity of anti-BVDV antibodies has been identified to cause failed detection of field isolates (particularly BVDV-2a) [55].",

Even with a high viral circulation in the country\u2019s cattle population, only 3% of farmers implement preventive vaccinations [22]. More recently, active BVDV infections in cattle in Uruguay were explored in a study in which 390 serum samples from 14 herds were analyzed to search for viral antigens by capture ELISA and for viral genomes by RT-qPCR. Sixteen (4.1%) of these animals were positive by both techniques [18], suggesting that they were either PI animals and/or acute/transient infections acquired postnatally. Interestingly, the mortality rate was 3.5% in the herd with MD from outbreak 1 in our study, suggesting, hypothetically, that 3.5% of this herd could have been PI animals, a value close to that found by Maya et al. [18]. Although the prevalence of PI animals in a herd is generally < 2%, it can be as high as 25\u201330% in herds where many cows/heifers were exposed to NCP BVDV strains during early pregnancy [13].",
