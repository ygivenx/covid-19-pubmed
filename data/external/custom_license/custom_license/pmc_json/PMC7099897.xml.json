            "text": "Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) are a leading cause of illness, especially in pediatric patients. The common respiratory viruses include rhinoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, adenoviruses, parainfluenza viruses, and coronaviruses [1\u20133]. However, one third of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) and half of upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) are left undiagnosed. Since the initial discovery of human metapneumovirus (hMPV) in the Netherlands in 2001, and human bocavirus (HBoV) in Sweden in 2005, these viruses have become recognized as important pathogens responsible for ARTIs in children [4]. These viruses are also important causes of ARTI in the elderly and in immunocompromised patients. hMPV belongs to the Paramyxoviridae family and has a negative-sense single-stranded RNA genome, which includes eight genes coding for nine different proteins [5]. HBoV belongs to the Parvoviridae family and has single-stranded DNA [6]. hMPV and HBoV are now considered important viral pathogens that cause undiagnosed LRTI and URTI in children less than 5 years of age when not tested for [6, 7]. hMPV and HBoV cannot be cultivated reliably in many commonly used cell lines; however, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based detection in clinical specimens has been successful. Little is known about the prevalence of hMPV and HBoV among young children from rural communities in South India.",

In our study, collection of nasopharyngeal samples was difficult in terms of both non-compliance by parents and non-cooperation by children. Thus, instead of simply collecting throat swabs, we collected oropharyngeal swabs. In our opinion, these swabs should be of adequate sensitivity for virus detection. This approach has been found to be satisfactory for detection of respiratory viruses [21, 22]. Kim et al. [23] recently assessed the relative performance of nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swab specimens from pediatric and adult patients.
