Recently, the discovery of novel coronaviruses resulted in the division of the family Coronaviridae into two subfamilies: Torovirinae and Coronavirinae. The subfamily Coronavirinae is further split into four genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus [9]. Members of the genera Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus are found mainly in mammals, in which they can cause mild or severe diseases [5]. This group includes the recently identified Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus [4]. Members of the genera Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus are found in birds and mammals [14, 18, 19]. The ancestors of the different genetic groups have not been identified.",

Some experimental evidence suggests that coronaviruses are not limited to replication in a single host, and this is especially true of those that infect mammals [20]. Indeed, close contact of animals of different species in domestic environments and wildlife markets as well as close contact with humans may allow interspecies jumping and could subsequently pose risks of further genetic changes if the virus adapts to human hosts, as has occurred in the case of SARS [3] and H5N1 virus [17]. In the intensive poultry industry, poultry are increasingly exposed to pathogens of other birds and mammals and vice versa. An experimental study showed that bovine coronavirus (BCV) is pathogenic for 1-day-old turkey poults [10]. In this context, the present study aimed to evaluate whether avian coronaviruses can replicate, are pathogenic, and induce an immune response in mice.",

The animals, 6- to 8-week-old specific-pathogen-free females, were purchased from CEMIB (Multidisciplinary Centre for Biological Investigation, UNICAMP, Brazil). Mice were maintained under specific-pathogen-free conditions, and manipulations were performed according to the Brazilian Ethics Community guidelines and approved by the local ethics committee (CEUA-UNICAMP no. 2746-1, May, 21, 2012). Two IBV strains isolated previously [6], named 810 (BR-I) and 67T (Mass), and one vaccine strain (H120-Mass) (Bio-Bronk-Vet-H120, Laborat\u00f3rio Biovet, Vargem Grande Paulista, Brasil) were used. Thirty-six BALB/c mice were divided into four groups: a control group and three groups inoculated with virus (strains 67T, 810 or H120). Six A/J mice were inoculated with the H120 vaccine strain, and six A/J mice were kept as a control group. Mice were anesthetized and inoculated intranasally with 50 \u03bcL of a suspension containing 106 EID50 of IBV per mouse according to previous studies [16]. BALB/c and A/J mice were monitored daily for two weeks for weight loss and survival.",

Tissues were homogenized in 400 \u00b5L of ice-cold Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle medium (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, USA), and supernatants were harvested after centrifugation for 10 min at 1000 \u00d7 g at 4 \u00b0C. Viral RNA from tissue suspensions were purified using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. RRT-PCR targeting the 5\u2032 untranslated region (5\u2032UTR) of IBV was used [1]. The copy number was calculated using a standard curve, and beta actin was used as an internal control as described previously [7]. One-way analysis of variance and Student\u2019s t-test were carried out to compare differences among groups, and the differences were considered significant at P < 0.05. Histopathological evaluation was performed to assess whether the mice displayed any histopathological lesions related to infection. Trachea, lung, and duodenum of inoculated BALB/c mice were collected at 3 and 10 dpi and fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 12 h at room temperature. The specimens were treated with xylene, dehydrated in graded ethanol, embedded in paraffin, and cut into 5-\u00b5m-thick sections. Histopathological changes were evaluated in sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Additionally, the slides were subjected to immunohistochemistry for detection of virus in the tissues. Immunostaining was performed according to a previous study [11]. After treatment with Triton X-100 (#93443, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) to permeabilize the cells, the tissue sections were incubated for 12 hours with a 1:20 dilution of a monoclonal primary antibody targeting the IBV nucleoprotein (no. nAB90926, Abcam, Cambridge, UK). The slides were then incubated with a 1:20 dilution of goat anti-IgG biotin conjugate (no. B7264, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, USA). After washing, each slide was treated with a solution of avidin and biotinylated peroxidase. The reaction was visualized by adding a solution containing the substrate (H2O2) and the chromogen diaminobenzidine (DAB). The sections were counterstained with hematoxylin, mounted, and examined using an optical microscope (Zeiss).",

Mucus accumulation was not evident in the inoculated mice from the 67T group. Interestingly, nucleoprotein was detected in all of the inoculated groups at 3 dpi (Fig. 3), but not at 10 dpi. Intense perialveolar and perivascular infiltration was observed in the lungs of all inoculated groups at 3 dpi when compared to the control group (Fig. 2A-D). Furthermore, the intense infiltrate was substantially reduced at 10 dpi in the mice infected with 67T or H120, whereas the mice infected with the 810 virus showed persistent inflammatory infiltrate at 10 dpi. The viral nucleoprotein was detected in the lungs of all inoculated mice at 3 dpi (Fig. 3), especially in the mice inoculated with 67T virus, whereas the labeling decreased at 10 dpi. Moreover, in the duodenum, the increase in goblet cells with greater mucus production was more pronounced in mice inoculated with strain 810 than in the other groups at 3 dpi, but this was drastically reduced at 10 dpi. Nucleoprotein was also detected at 3 dpi in all of the inoculated mice; whereas this signal was no longer detectable at 10 dpi mice (Fig. 3). In addition to RNA viral detection by RRT-PCR, histopathological changes and changes in immunohistochemistry were observed in different tissues in the inoculated mice.\n\n",

Interestingly, viral RNA and histopathological changes in different organs were more evident in inoculated BALB/c mice, suggesting that these mice are more susceptible than A/J mice to avian coronavirus infection. BALB/c mice have been shown to be susceptible to experimental infection with avian paramyxoviruses and recombinant avian paramyxoviruses [11, 12]; but other studies have shown that A/J and C57BL/6 mice were more susceptible to infection with bovine respiratory syncytial virus than BALB/c mice [15] and that no difference was observed after infection with mouse hepatitis virus [13]. In our study, all tissue changes correlated to the detection of viral RNA by RRT-PCR or viral nucleoprotein by immunostaining, suggesting that virus replication had occurred, although virus isolation was not attempted. Viral nucleoprotein was strongly detected at 3 dpi, suggesting that the presence of virus correlated with severe histological changes. Those findings are in accordance with an acute inflammatory state [8]. Additionally, viral RNA, histopathological lesions and viral antigen were also more pronounced at 3 dpi than at 10 dpi, suggesting that replication occurred for a short time. Low levels of antibodies specific for IBV were detected at 3 dpi, suggesting slight IgM production, which is typically associated with the primary immune response. Nonetheless, no specific antibody was detected at 10 dpi, suggesting that this antibody response was not important given its short duration.",
