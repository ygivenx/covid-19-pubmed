We used this subset to describe the patient population, evaluate risk factors for death by using logistic regression models, and assess predictors of time from onset to diagnosis and onset to discharge by using Cox proportional hazards models. Five potential covariates were analyzed: sex, age, concurrent health condition status, health care worker status, and time from onset to diagnosis. For time-to-event analyses, patients were categorized into outbreak weeks by date of onset. We tested the Cox proportional hazards assumption by using Schoenfeld residuals and included an interaction term for predictor and follow-up time.",

Time from onset to diagnosis was not an indicator for death, which suggests that the rapidity with which a patient receives supportive care may be of marginal consequence.

Because 19 (10%) of 186 case-patients reported remain hospitalized, the final CFR of the outbreak might be higher than our current estimate. However, the proportion of patients who died (18%\u201319%) has been fairly stable since June 27 (Figure 2), which might indicate an asymptotic approach toward the final outbreak-specified CFR (5\u20137). If so, the final CFR associated with the MERS outbreak in South Korea during 2015 might be <22%. If all remaining hospitalized case-patients died, the final outbreak CFR would be 29%, which provides an upper limit for our current estimate of 22% excluding additional cases.",

Although only 25 (16%) case-patients had documented concurrent health conditions, the MERS outbreak in South Korean during 2015 has been largely nosocomial in nature.
