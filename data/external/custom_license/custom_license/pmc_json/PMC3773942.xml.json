            "text": "To control infection by viruses, host cells must recognize invasion and develop a rapid and effective antiviral response. In mammalian cells, this response is initiated after the detection of non-self pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), including single-stranded and double-stranded viral nucleic acids. These viral PAMPs are detected by specific host pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) in endosomes and within the cytoplasm1,2. Such PRRs include Toll-like receptors (TLRs; specifically TLR3, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9), RIG-I-like receptors (such as melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)) and DNA sensors (namely DNA-dependent activator of IRFs (DAI; also known as ZBP1), IFN\u03b3-inducible protein 16 (IFI16), DEAH box protein 9 (DHX9) and DHX36). The binding of viral PAMPs to these PRRs triggers signalling cascades that induce the expression of virus-responsive genes and pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as type I interferons (IFNs)), which restrict virus replication and modulate adaptive immunity (Fig. 1).",

            "text": "IFN signalling induces a broad and potent antiviral response against most viruses that infect vertebrate animals. Type I IFNs are a family of functionally and genetically related cytokines consisting of several members, with IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b2 being the most extensively studied3. Type I IFN signalling is mediated through a common receptor, the IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor (IFNAR), which is a heterodimer of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 (Ref. 4). Signal transduction following the binding of a type I IFN to IFNAR occurs via Janus kinase (JAK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins and results in the translocation into the nucleus of the transcription factor complex IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3; which is comprised of IFN-regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) and phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2). Nuclear ISGF3 induces the transcription of hundreds of different IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs); indeed, it is estimated that 500 to 1,000 genes are induced per cell or tissue type5,6,7. These ISGs encode distinct proteins with diverse biological effects that block multiple stages of the viral replication cycle, including entry into host cells, protein translation, replication, assembly of new virus particles and spread. They can also have immunomodulatory functions, including effects on leukocyte recruitment and the priming of adaptive immunity. Beyond this, a subset of ISGs is induced in an IFN-independent manner after viral infection through the actions of transcription factors (such as IRF3) that respond directly to signals downstream of PRRs.",

            "text": "Although the first antiviral ISGs were discovered decades ago (reviewed in Ref. 8), until recently most experimental effort has been restricted to defining the mechanisms of action of a limited number of proteins, including RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR), ribonuclease L (RNase L), myxoma resistance protein 1 (MX1) and oligoadenylate synthases (OASs). More recent studies have expanded the analysis to several other ISGs, including those encoding APOBEC3 (Ref. 9), BST2 (also known as tetherin)10, ISG15 (Ref. 11) and RSAD2 (also known as viperin)12. Moreover, progress has been made in understanding the IFN-mediated mechanisms that control particular families of viruses (such as retroviruses13) and the ways in which these viruses can evade such control. In addition, systematic investigations of the antiviral functions of large groups of ISGs using ectopic gene screens14,15 have identified genes that coordinately control infection by several families of RNA and DNA viruses. There has been a resurgence of interest in defining ISGs with broad-spectrum antiviral activity, possibly as a means to identify new classes of drugs that activate these genes directly. Indeed, antiviral therapies that target host proteins rather than viral proteins could in theory minimize the emergence of resistance and the collateral effects associated with type I IFN therapy that limit its current clinical use. This Review describes recent advances in understanding the antiviral activity and mechanisms of action of two particular ISG families with broad-spectrum antiviral activity: the IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFIT) and IFN-induced transmembrane protein (IFITM) families. Although these families are genetically and functionally distinct, a combined analysis of IFIT and IFITM proteins clarifies more generally how specific ISGs inhibit the replication, spread and pathogenesis of a range of human viruses.",

IFIT genes have a similar genomic structure, in that most of these genes are composed of two exons, with the second exon containing almost all of the coding sequence. IFIT gene homologues have been reported in several mammalian species, as well as in birds, fish and amphibians (reviewed in Ref. 17). Four family members have been characterized in humans: IFIT1 (also known as ISG56), IFIT2 (also known as ISG54), IFIT3 (also known as ISG60) and IFIT5 (also known as ISG58). All four of these genes are located on chromosome 10q23. By contrast, three members are expressed in mice \u2014 Ifit1 (also known as Isg56), Ifit2 (also known as Isg54) and Ifit3 (also known as Isg49) \u2014 and they are located on chromosome 19qC1. Additional uncharacterized but highly related IFIT genes (namely IFIT1B in humans and Ifit1b, Ifit1c and Ifit3b in mice) exist in the same chromosomal regions as the known IFIT genes, although their functional significance and expression patterns remain undefined. Moreover, a non-transcribed IFIT1-related pseudogene is present on human chromosome 13 (Ref. 18).",

The sequence identity between human and mouse IFIT orthologues ranges from 52% to 62%, but there is less similarity (\u223c40\u201345%) between orthologues in other species16, suggesting that mouse and human IFIT proteins were generated by the duplication of a common ancestral gene. However, different IFIT family members have been predicted by sequence analysis to have distinct numbers of TPR motifs, which may dictate specific functions. For example, IFIT1 and IFIT2 were predicted to have six and four TPR motifs, respectively20.",

By determining the structure with a resolution of 2.8 \u00c5, the authors showed that IFIT2 monomers actually have nine TPR motifs and form domain-swapped dimers. Moreover, IFIT2 has a positively charged carboxy-terminal region that supports RNA binding, and the mutation or deletion of charged residues in this region altered viral RNA binding and negatively affected antiviral activity against Newcastle disease virus. This study also suggested that IFIT2 can bind to RNA containing AU-rich elements, which are sometimes found in mRNAs encoding cytokines or apoptotic factors, indicating a potential mechanism by which IFIT proteins might regulate inflammatory responses (see below).",

Other IRF proteins (such as IRF1, IRF5 and IRF7) also can induce the expression of IFIT genes directly33,34, presumably after the stimulation of host defence signalling cascades, although these pathways remain less well defined.

IFIT1 suppressed the function of the HCV IRES, whereas a mutant IFIT1 protein lacking eIF3-binding activity failed to inhibit HCV replication.

The cellular mRNAs of higher eukaryotes and many viral RNAs are methylated at the N-7 and 2\u2032-O positions of the 5\u2032 guanosine cap by nuclear and cytoplasmic methyltransferases. Whereas N-7 methylation is essential for RNA translation and stability, the function of 2\u2032-O methylation had remained uncertain43,44. Recent studies showed that a West Nile virus (WNV) mutant lacking 2\u2032-O methyltransferase activity was attenuated in wild-type cells and mice but was pathogenic in the absence of Ifit1 expression45,46. The mutant virus lacking 2\u2032-O methyltransferase activity had higher levels of replication in the peripheral tissues of Ifit1\u2212/\u2212 mice than in wild-type mice after subcutaneous infection, and the lethal dose (LD50) of this virus was 16,000-fold lower in Ifit1\u2212/\u2212 mice than in wild-type mice. 2\u2032-O methylation of viral RNA did not affect IFN induction in WNV-infected cells but instead modulated the antiviral effects of IFIT proteins. Moreover, poxvirus and coronavirus mutants that lacked 2\u2032-O methyltransferase activity were more sensitive to the antiviral actions of IFIT proteins than their wild-type counterparts45,47. It remains unclear whether IFIT proteins inhibit viruses that lack 2\u2032-O methylation at the stage of protein translation by directly recognizing non-2\u2032-O-methylated viral RNA, thereby preventing the recognition of viral RNA by the 43S pre-initiation complex, or by serving as a scaffold for other proteins that regulate translation (Fig. 3). Wild-type alphaviruses of the Togaviridae family, which are positive-stranded cytoplasmic RNA viruses, lack 2\u2032-O methylation on their viral RNA48 and, thus, should be sensitive to IFIT-mediated restriction. Although further mechanistic studies are warranted, in support of this hypothesis ectopic expression of IFIT1 inhibited infection by Sindbis virus, and, reciprocally, silencing of Ifit1 expression resulted in enhanced infection49.",

A recent study indicates that human IFIT1 can also function as a sensor for viral RNA by recognizing an uncapped 5\u2032-ppp and sequestering the RNA from the actively replicating pool50 (Fig. 4). Using a proteomics approach with 5\u2032-ppp RNA as bait, a mass spectrometry analysis identified IFIT1 as a primary binding partner. Subsequent experiments showed that only IFIT1 interacts directly with 5\u2032-ppp on RNA, whereas IFIT2 and IFIT3 form a complex with IFIT1 that is required for antiviral function. These IFIT-dependent interactions were relevant in protecting against RNA viruses displaying a 5\u2032-ppp, as silencing of IFIT1, IFIT2 and IFIT3 expression in HeLa cells enhanced the replication of the negative-stranded RNA viruses Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and influenza A virus to varying degrees, despite the fact that the production of mRNA encoding IFN\u03b2 was unaffected. By contrast, ectopic expression of individual IFIT proteins in cells did not confer an inhibitory effect on these viruses, suggesting that the IFIT protein complex is required for this antiviral activity. Studies with Ifit1\u2212/\u2212 mouse fibroblasts and myeloid cells also showed enhanced replication of VSV despite wild-type production levels of type I IFNs and other pro-inflammatory cytokines. In vivo, Ifit1\u2212/\u2212 mice were more vulnerable to infection with VSV, with higher virus-induced mortality observed. However, and in apparent conflict, experiments by a second group using the same VSV strain but an independently generated Ifit1\u2212/\u2212 mouse showed no differences in mortality compared with wild-type mice over a wide range of VSV doses51. In this study, VSV infection was uniformly lethal in Ifit2\u2212/\u2212 mice, a phenotype that was associated with enhanced viral replication in neurons of the brain but not in cells from other organs, such as the lungs and liver. Finally, a third study showed that silencing of IFIT3 expression in human A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells resulted in decreased IFN\u03b1-dependent antiviral activity against VSV. Moreover, ectopic expression of IFIT3 inhibited infection not only by VSV but also by encephalomyocarditis virus, a picornavirus that encodes the genome-linked protein Vpg, which binds to the 5\u2032 end of the viral RNA and probably blocks the uncapped 5\u2032-ppp52. Clearly, studies with additional RNA and DNA viruses and IFIT-deficient cells and mice are warranted to establish the mechanisms by which IFIT proteins control different families of viruses.",

Two reports have suggested that IFIT proteins negatively regulate the host inflammatory and antiviral responses. One showed that ectopic expression of IFIT2 in mouse macrophages inhibited LPS-induced expression of tumour necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and CXC-chemokine ligand 2 (CXCL2; also known as MIP2) and that this effect was mediated post-transcriptionally, possibly through effects on mRNA stability55. More recently, human IFIT1 and IFIT2 were reported to bind to and inhibit stimulator of IFN genes (STING; also known as MITA), which functions as a mitochondrial adaptor protein that recruits TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and IRF3 to a complex with mitochondrial antiviral signalling protein (MAVS; also known as IPS1, CARDIF and VISA), resulting in the downstream induction of IFN\u03b2 expression in response to viral RNA or DNA56. Ectopic expression of IFIT1 in human embryonic kidney 293T cells and macrophages inhibited the activation of IRF3 and nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) and the transcription of IFNB in response to polyinosinic\u2013polycytidylic acid (polyI:C) and prevented polyI:C-induced inhibition of VSV infection. Moreover, silencing of IFIT1 expression inhibited VSV infection, presumably by modulating the IRF3- and IFN-dependent responses. A biochemical analysis indicated that IFIT1 disrupted the physical interaction between STING and MAVS or TBK1.",

In the latter study, a TPR motif of IFIT3 interacted with the amino terminus of TBK1, and bridged TBK1 to MAVS on mitochondria, such that the host antiviral responses were boosted in the presence of IFIT3.

Because of their ability to bind components of the eIF3 complex and inhibit host protein translation, IFIT proteins might contribute to the restriction of cell division imposed by IFN signalling. Independently, IFIT proteins may modulate the expression of negative regulators of the cell cycle, leading to the accumulation of cells at the G1\u2013S phase transition60. Indeed, ectopic expression of IFIT3 in U937 human myeloid cells resulted in the sequestration of JUN activation domain-binding protein 1 (JAB1; also known as COPS5), which limited ubiquitin- and proteasome-dependent degradation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (also known as p27 and KIP1). In other studies, IFIT1 was shown to bind and sequester the ribosomal protein L15 (RPL15). Ectopic expression of IFIT1 or silencing of RPL15 had an anti-proliferative effect on human gastric cancer cells, and higher IFIT1 levels correlated with enhanced sensitivity to IFN-induced inhibition of proliferation61. Finally, expression of human IFIT2, independently of IFN-mediated stimulation, was shown recently to promote cell apoptosis via a mitochondrial pathway. In this study, IFIT2 formed a complex with IFIT1 and IFIT3, and IFIT3 was shown to negatively regulate the pro-apoptotic effects of IFIT2 (Ref. 62). Thus, IFIT proteins as a complex seem to regulate cell apoptosis after the induction of type I IFN responses or other cell stress pathways.",

Moreover, recent functional studies suggest that IFIT family members might also regulate cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic immune responses, through pathways that remain to be defined and/or corroborated.

According to this second model, the putative transmembrane regions associate with the inner leaflet of the membrane, and both N- and C-terminal domains are located in the cytoplasm65. Evidence for this model (Fig. 5a) includes the absence of N-linked glycans in the putative ectodomains despite the presence of native or engineered N-linked glycosylation sites, and the observation that the N-terminal domain can be ubiquitylated.

The expression of all four human IFITM proteins is induced robustly by both type I and type II IFNs. In mice, however, expression of Ifitm3 is the most strongly induced by IFNs, whereas other IFITM genes are less responsive to IFN treatment. The expression of human IFITM3 and mouse Ifitm3 is also induced by IFN\u03b3 and by members of the gp130 family of cytokines (such as oncostatin M and IL-6), which all use similar JAK\u2013STAT signalling mechanisms. This observation suggests that the induction of IFITM3 expression in a more targeted, IFN-independent manner might be possible through the ligation of tissue-specific receptors by gp130 family cytokines.

Depletion of IFITM3 using small interfering RNA or shRNA enhanced influenza A virus infection, and ectopic expression of IFITM1, IFITM2 or IFITM3 markedly inhibited influenza A virus replication. Surprisingly, retroviruses pseudotyped with influenza A virus haemagglutinin were affected similarly to influenza A virus by IFITM depletion and ectopic expression, whereas retroviruses pseudotyped with the entry proteins of murine leukaemia virus, Lassa virus or Machupo virus were not affected by the presence or absence of IFITM proteins. This observation localized the restriction of influenza A virus by IFITM proteins to a haemagglutinin-mediated step in the virus replication cycle. Subsequent studies established that, uniquely among antiviral proteins, IFITM proteins interfere with a step in viral replication preceding fusion of the viral and cellular membranes73,74.",

            "text": "There are several implications of this early restriction step. First, IFITM-mediated restriction precedes the induction of type I IFNs in infected cells, which might explain the high basal level of expression of IFITM proteins in many tissues. IFN induction, however, can amplify IFITM expression and protect uninfected cells in a paracrine manner, and acute-phase cytokines such as IL-6 might induce IFITM expression systemically. Second, viral escape from restriction by IFITM proteins could be more challenging than escape from inhibitory factors that function at later stages of the viral replication cycle. For example, viral proteins such as HIV-1 Vif and Vpu, which are generated after viral entry, allow the virus to evade host responses mediated by APOBEC3G or BST2 (which affect viral replication and assembly) by degrading these restriction factors. In comparison, because IFITM-mediated restriction precedes infection, there is no opportunity for the de novo synthesis of viral inhibitors. Thus, the virion must carry a protein that counteracts IFITM-mediated restriction (which is unlikely given the relatively small amount of viral protein that is delivered to a cell) or alter its site of fusion with host cell membranes (Fig. 6).",

By contrast, infection by alphaviruses, arenaviruses and murine leukaemia virus (a retrovirus) seems to be unaffected by IFITM protein expression. VSV is weakly restricted by IFITM proteins, and HIV-1 might be restricted in a cell-type specific manner14,77. These varying degrees of restriction are also observed for retroviruses pseudotyped with the entry proteins of different viruses. Viruses that are restricted by IFITM proteins tend to fuse with host cell membranes in a late endosome or lysosome. Indeed, when retroviruses bearing the entry protein of the SARS coronavirus were induced by trypsin to fuse at the plasma membrane, IFITM-mediated restriction was bypassed, establishing that the site of viral fusion is crucial for the antiviral activity of IFITM proteins74.",

Ifitm3\u2212/\u2212 mice had a viral infection phenotype indistinguishable from that of IfitmDel mice (which lack Ifitm1, Ifitm2, Ifitm3, Ifitm5 and Ifitm6), which suggests that the other mouse IFITM proteins do not have a significant role in controlling influenza A virus infection79. Consistent with these data, patients who were hospitalized owing to severe infection with the 2009 pandemic H1N1 strain of influenza A virus were enriched for a single-nucleotide polymorphism that decreased expression of full-length IFITM3 (Ref. 78). Although analogous in vivo studies of other viruses that are restricted by IFITM proteins remain to be carried out, cell-culture experiments indicate that IFITM1 restricts filoviruses and SARS coronavirus more effectively than IFITM3 does74. More impressively, mouse IFITM6 did not prevent influenza A virus infection, but efficiently limited infection mediated by filovirus entry proteins.",

            "text": "The mechanisms underlying the antiviral activity of IFITM proteins remain uncertain. However, several possibilities have been excluded73,74. Ectopic expression of IFITM proteins does not alter the expression of virus receptors, affect the pH of endosomal compartments or interfere with the cathepsin activity that is necessary for the fusion of some restricted viruses. Although IFITM proteins can be detected on the plasma membrane, particularly when overexpressed or induced by IFNs, they are enriched in intracellular compartments, including late endosomes, where restricted viruses fuse. Two models have been proposed to explain the antiviral activity of IFITM proteins73,74 (Fig. 6). In the first model, IFITM proteins are hypothesized to modify endosomal or lysosomal vesicles such that they become inhospitable to viral fusion. IFITM proteins could achieve this by altering the lipid components of the vesicle membrane, by enriching vesicles with nonspecific proteases that inactivate entry proteins or, as proposed recently80, by interfering with the activity of the V-type proton ATPase, which is responsible for endosomal acidification. In the second model, IFITM proteins could alter the rate or pattern of vesicle trafficking such that viruses are redirected to a non-fusogenic pathway. The expression of IFITM proteins in many cell lines induces large vacuoles, suggesting that these proteins in some way interfere with vesicle trafficking, fusion or resolution73. However, the presence and size of these vacuoles do not correlate with the efficiency of restriction, and morphological changes were not observed when endogenous IFITM proteins were depleted, despite the increased levels of influenza A virus replication in these cells72,74. As in the case of the IFIT proteins, the absence of obvious enzymatic domains in the IFITM proteins suggests that cellular cofactors are necessary for antiviral activity. Consistent with this possibility, IFITM proteins have species-specific signature sequences that are localized at the cytoplasmic base of both transmembrane domains (Fig. 5b).",

The expression of IFITM proteins makes cells refractory to steps in the viral infection cycle that precede viral fusion, but the mechanisms by which these proteins mediate such functions remain incompletely defined. It also remains poorly understood how IFITM proteins differentially restrict distinct viruses, and whether they can modulate the replication of other pathogens, including non-enveloped viruses, bacteria and parasites.

IFIT proteins suppress the initiation of translation, bind to and sequester uncapped viral RNA, and sequester at least one viral protein (HPV E1) in the cytoplasm. IFITM proteins, by contrast, prevent several enveloped viruses from fusing with endosomal or lysosomal membranes and penetrating the cytoplasm. Moreover, IFIT proteins are expressed poorly, if at all, in the absence of inflammatory or danger signals, whereas IFITM proteins are expressed basally in many tissues. IFITM proteins generally are induced to greater levels than IFIT proteins by IFN\u03b3, and possibly by members of the gp130 family of cytokines (such as IL-6). However, although there are many differences, there are some parallels between IFIT and IFITM proteins. Compared with the APOBEC family of restriction factors, the IFIT and IFITM families target a wider range of viruses. Moreover, and similarly to the APOBEC proteins, the IFIT and IFITM families comprise specialized paralogues, perhaps reflecting an evolutionary arms race with pathogens. A deeper understanding of the antiviral activity and mechanism of action of the members of each family may facilitate the development of broad-spectrum antiviral agents that mimic or amplify their activities.",

The figure shows a scheme of innate immune signalling triggered by viral infection. Viral RNA and DNA is detected by: cytosolic RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), such as melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I); cytosolic DNA sensors, such as DNA-dependent activator of IRFs (DAI), IFN\u03b3-inducible protein 16 (IFI16), DEAH box protein 9 (DHX9) and DHX36; and endosomal Toll-like receptors (TLRs), including TLR3, TLR7 and TLR9. Infection by RNA viruses produces RNA intermediates that are recognized as non-self by RIG-I and MDA5 in the cytosol and by TLR3 and TLR7 in endosomes. The RLRs interact with mitochondrial antiviral signalling protein (MAVS), leading to the recruitment of TNFR-associated factor 3 (TRAF3), TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and I\u03baB kinase-\u03b5 (IKK\u03b5), or of IKK\u03b3 (also known as NEMO), IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2, which results in the activation and nuclear translocation of IFN-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB), respectively. TLRs interact with the adaptor proteins TRIF and MYD88, leading to the activation of IRF3 or IRF7. IRF3, IRF7 and NF-\u03baB bind to the interferon-\u03b2 (IFNB) gene promoter and induce transcription. Secretion of IFN\u03b2 by the infected cells results in paracrine type I IFN signalling through the IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor, which induces hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Phosphorylated IRF3 also can activate the expression of ISGs (such as IFIT and IFITM genes) independently of IFN signalling. DNA can be present in the cytoplasm and in endosomes during viral or bacterial infection and following the phagocytosis of dead cells. TLR9 recognizes CpG DNA in endosomes and activates MYD88. The binding of DNA by DAI or IFI16 results in stimulator of IFN genes (STING)-dependent activation of IRF3 and NF-\u03baB. RNA polymerase III transcribes this DNA to produce short RNAs containing a 5\u2032-ppp motif, which are ligands for RIG-I. DHX9 and DHX36 bind to DNA ligands (such as CpG-A and CpG-B DNA) in the cytosol and induce MYD88- and IRF7-dependent responses. ER, endoplasmic reticulum; I\u03baB, NF-\u03baB inhibitor.",

Human IFIT1 and IFIT2 bind to eIF3E, and human IFIT2, mouse IFIT1 and mouse IFIT2 bind to eIF3C. The figure shows a schematic diagram of translation initiation and the steps putatively blocked by IFIT family members. To begin translation in mammalian cells, free 40S ribosomal subunits are stabilized by eIF3 and bind to the ternary complex (eIF2\u2013GTP\u2013Met-tRNA) in the presence of eIF1 (not shown). This allows the assembly of the 43S pre-initiation complex, which then binds to mRNA that is capped at the 5\u2032 end and methylated at the N-7 and 2\u2032-O positions. This interaction is stabilized by eIF4E and eIF4G, and results in the formation of the 43S\u2013mRNA complex, which is competent for AUG (start codon) scanning and mRNA translation. For hepatitis C virus (HCV) genomic RNA with an internal ribosome entry site (IRES), association with eIF4E and eIF4G or other cap-binding factors is not required to stabilize the 43S\u2013mRNA complex. IFIT proteins can inhibit translation through several mechanisms27,37,38,40,41. One, the interaction of IFIT1 and IFIT2 with eIF3E blocks the binding of eIF3E to the ternary complex (eIF2\u2013GTP\u2013Met-tRNA) (a). Two, the binding of human IFIT2, and mouse IFIT1 and IFIT2, to eIF3C blocks the formation of the 43S\u2013mRNA complex (b). Three, the binding of human IFIT1 to eIF3E prevents the recognition of the HCV IRES by the 43S complex. Disruption of eIF3 binding to the HCV IRES also can prevent eIF2 recruitment and suppresses ternary complex formation (c). IFIT1 can also inhibit the translation of viral RNA lacking 2\u2032-O methylation through two possible mechanisms. One, IFIT1 may directly recognize the type 0 cap structure (no 2\u2032-O methylation) on viral RNA and prevent its binding to the 43S pre-initiation complex (d). Two, the binding of IFIT1 to eIF3 may preferentially prevent the formation of the 43S\u2013mRNA complex for RNA containing type 0 cap structures (e).",

These RNA molecules are recognized by the cytoplasmic sensors retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5). RIG-I and MDA5 induce the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) \u2014 including IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1 (IFIT1), IFIT2 and IFIT3 \u2014 through both interferon-\u03b2 (IFN\u03b2)-dependent pathways and IFN\u03b2-independent (for example, IFN-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)-dependent) pathways. IFIT1 functions as a sensor of viral RNA containing the 5\u2032-ppp motif, resulting in the assembly of an IFIT1\u2013IFIT2\u2013IFIT3 complex. This presumably inhibits viral infection by sequestering RNA from the actively replicating pool or by promoting RNA degradation.

For example, arenaviruses (such as Junin virus and Machupo virus) follow the recycling pathway of their common receptor, transferrin receptor 1 (Ref. 82). These viruses are not susceptible to IFITM-mediated restriction. By contrast, viruses such as influenza A virus fuse in late endosomes and are restricted by IFITM proteins, particularly by IFITM3 (Ref. 72). Viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Ebola virus and influenza A virus depend on lysosomal cathepsins and other lysosome-resident proteins for fusion, and these viruses are restricted mainly by IFITM1 (Ref. 74). Mouse IFITM6 is more specialized and restricts the entry of Ebola virus and SARS coronavirus, but not influenza A virus. Trypsin treatment of SARS coronavirus allows it to fuse at the plasma membrane and bypass IFITM-mediated restriction. Retroviruses pseudotyped with entry proteins from these viruses show identical patterns of restriction, implicating the entry process in the antiviral activity of IFITM proteins. Note that the diagram is schematic and ignores much of the diversity of cellular compartments and the complexity of cellular trafficking.",
