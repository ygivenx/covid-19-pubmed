            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a new infectious disease typically associated with fever, shortness of breath, cough, and pneumonia, first emerged in southern China in November 2002. Within months of the outbreak, SARS had spread globally, affecting over 8,000 patients in 29 countries with 774 fatalities [1]. The etiology of SARS is associated with a newly discovered coronavirus, SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [2]. Subsequent studies indicate that the SARS-CoV is of animal origin [3], and its precursor is still present in animal populations within the region. Although the global outbreak of SARS was contained, there are serious concerns over its re-emergence. To date, no specific treatment exists for this disease. Thus, further basic and clinical research is required for disease control.",

            "text": "SARS-CoV is phylogenetically distinct, and only distantly related to the other coronavirus clades [4, 5]. Coronaviruses are exceptionally large RNA viruses and employ complex regulatory mechanisms to express their genomes. The genome structure, gene expression pattern, and protein profiles of SARS-CoV are similar to those of other coronaviruses [6]. Previous studies on various coronaviruses indicate that the four structural proteins (S, E, M, and NC) play roles in virion morphogenesis [7, 8]. Moreover, it is reported that co-expression of M and E proteins together can form virus-like particles (VLPs) in different coronaviruses [9, 10]. To develop a VLP vaccine for SARS-CoV, understanding the protein\u2013protein interactions between SARS-CoV M and E proteins is necessary. Differential maturation and subcellular localization of SARS-CoV S, M, and E proteins is also reported [11]. Both SARS-CoV M and E proteins are integral membrane proteins, though neither of them contains a conventional signal peptide [10, 11]. Expression and membrane integration of SARS-CoV M protein was characterized previously [12]. The interacting domains of SARS-CoV M with other structural proteins (S, E, and NC proteins) were also reported previously [13]. The envelope protein of coronaviruses is a small membrane protein with multiple functions. It plays important roles in virion assembly and morphogenesis, alteration of membrane permeability of host cells, and virus\u2013host cell interactions [14]. SARS-CoV E protein also is involved in host-cell apoptosis [15], alteration of host-cell membrane permeability [16\u201318], and virion assembly [19].",

The transmembrane domain (a.a. 9\u201335) of SARS-CoV E protein forms SDS-resistant dimers, trimers, and pentamers [26]. The protein (about 18 kDa) that we detected was unglycosylated monomeric E protein with an unusual mobility on SDS-PAGE. This protein should not be a dimer since the glycosylated E protein is 4 kDa, but not 8 kDa larger than the unglycosylated form (Figs. 1, 4). Furthermore, the mobility of various E protein deletion mutants on the gel supports this argument (Fig. 4). Two unidentified protein bands (marked by dotted arrows in Fig. 4) greater than 30 kDa may not be the oligomeric form of this protein since they migrate similarly between the wild type and the deletion mutants of E protein (Fig. 4). These two bands are probably two unidentified cellular proteins interacting with E protein so extensively that they are resistant to treatments of SDS and boiling.",

The E protein of SARS-CoV is a double-spanning membrane protein [24].

Both of these two transmembrane regions (a.a. 11\u201333 and 37\u201359) are predicted to be \u03b1-helices, which penetrate into the membrane by themselves (supplemental Fig. 1A). However, in another report, SARS-CoV E protein was predicted to have only one putative transmembrane \u03b1-helical hydrophobic domain (corresponding to the first transmembrane domain, a.a. 11\u201333, mentioned in our study) which is responsible for the membrane permeabilizing activity of this protein [16]. In order to determine which transmembrane domain is responsible for the integration of SARS-CoV E protein into the ER, each of these two transmembrane domains was linked with a.a. 1\u2013115 of hepatitis C virus core protein which localizes in the cytoplasm [12]. Both of the single transmembrane regions were able to insert a cytoplasmic protein into the ER membrane (Fig. 2). These results suggest that either of the transmembrane regions is able to target SARS-CoV E protein into ER. Thus, there exists the second transmembrane region (a.a. 37\u201359) in the SARS-CoV E protein though this region is less hydrophobic than the first transmembrane region (a.a. 1\u201333) (supplemental Fig. 1B). Whether the second transmembrane region performs as the first one does in oligomer formation [26] and membrane permeabilization [16] needs further investigation. Figures 1 and 2 also imply that a nascent peptide of SARS-CoV E protein after the synthesis of the first or second transmembrane domains could integrate the peptide into the ER membrane, after which glycosylation occurs.",
