            "text": "Porcine parvovirus (PPV) is a member of the family Parvoviridae, subfamily Parvovirinae, genus Protoparvovirus. The parvoviruses are small, non-enveloped, single-stranded DNA viruses. PPV is a major cause of reproductive failure in sows and is a significant cofactor in porcine post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome [1\u20133]. PPV was first isolated from pigs with fever in 1965 [4]. It is commonly found in diseased pigs and is the cause of significant economic loss for the swine industry today [1, 5\u20139]. Currently, vaccination is the primary measure for prevention of PPV. However, the costs of vaccinations are high and might lead to biological safety issues, such as recombination and mutation of viruses. Additionally, even with vaccination, PPV is widespread in swine. Although vaccination can prevent the clinical symptoms of the PPV disease, it cannot eliminate the impairment caused by PPV disease [10, 11]. Therefore, alternative strategies, such as drug therapies to control the PPV, should receive increased attention.",

In March of 2013, a PPV with low virulence, named PPV2013, was isolated from a pool of tissues (including lung, liver and kidney) of dead foetuses from a sow experiencing reproductive losses such as mummification, stillborns and weak foetuses. This sow came from a commercial pig farm located in Guangdong Province (Southern China). ST cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and were maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) (Gibco, USA) containing 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 \u00b0C and 5 % CO2.
