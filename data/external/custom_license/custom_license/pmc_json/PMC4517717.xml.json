These bats were described as fruit bats and thus were possibly Rousettus aegyptiacus bats, the species most commonly identified in Buoyem caves. The night\u2019s catch was collected by the women; menstruating women were excluded from participation in Yam activities for reasons explained as cleanliness. In recent years, Yam activities had been discontinued because of chieftaincy disputes and conflict over ownership of cave lands.

Initial information about the supply routes of bat meat obtained from hunters and members of the indigenous community led to investigation of the bat meat trade at the main market in Techiman. Hunters from the surrounding communities supplied most traded bats. Information gathered from traders showed that the supply route of bat meat extends far beyond the Brong Ahafo region to other regions in Ghana and neighboring countries (Figure 1). Some places mentioned by the traders as sources of bat meat include towns and villages in the Ashanti region. Some of these were Duamo (3 km from Kwamang), Adobomam, Kyekyebon, Kumawu, Deduako, Agogo, and the zoological gardens in Kumasi, where migratory E. helvum bats roost seasonally (13). Other areas were in Techiman, Nkoranza, Tanoso, and Tuobodom in the Brong Ahafo region; Afram Plains and Akuapem in the Eastern region, and Accra in the Greater Accra region. Some supplies came from the Northern region and beyond the borders of Ghana from C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.",
