            "text": "Knowledgeable observers operating within a legitimate framework for the public good have expressed divergent opinions about the importance and public safety implications of two papers, one recently published1 and one soon-to-be published2, describing the production of ferret-transmissible H5N1 influenza viruses, and about related influenza transmission and pathogenesis research3,4,5,6,7. Some have emphasized that understanding the underlying principles of influenza virus host adaptation and transmission can lead to better prevention and control of viruses that arise naturally, whereas others have drawn attention to \u2018dual use\u2019 implications\u2014that is, bioterrorism\u2014or to accidental release of potentially deadly viruses. The most commonly mentioned public safety concerns relate to three assumptions: (1) H5N1 viruses are currently highly lethal to humans but are poorly transmissible; (2) genetic manipulation of H5N1 viruses to increase transmissibility in mammals such as ferrets will create variant viruses that remain highly pathogenic and that become transmissible in humans; and (3) if accidentally or intentionally released, such a virus could precipitate a historically severe influenza pandemic. How do these assumptions hold up against scientific data? In this perspective, we address research evidence related to the epidemic/pandemic potential of genetically engineered H5N1 viruses, and discuss limitations in understanding how influenza viruses become pathogenic, transmissible and potentially pandemic in humans.",

Countless influenza A viruses circulate globally in a reservoir that consists of hundreds of avian species. Rarely, one of these viruses undergoes changes that enable it to switch hosts to infect mammals, including humans, although it is not clear whether human transmission can result directly from adaptation of an avian influenza virus (this has not been documented to occur), or only indirectly via further adaptation of pre-existing human or mammalian-adapted viruses, the mechanism that has been associated with all known pandemic and seasonal viruses after 1918. The factors underlying all such emergences are poorly understood8. In the past 80 years of influenza virology, three pandemics have resulted from reassortments of pre-existing human-adapted or mammalian-adapted viruses with one or more avian-influenza-derived genes, but no purely avian influenza virus has emerged to cause a pandemic or human outbreak, or has even become stably adapted to humans. However, because avian influenza viruses have adapted to other mammals, it is considered plausible that such an emergence could occur in humans.",

Among the many subtypes and strains of avian influenza A viruses that exist in nature, those that have at least occasionally infected mammals (for example, H5N1, H7N7 and H9N2) are of interest because they might theoretically be more likely than other influenza A viruses to adapt directly or indirectly to humans. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses have been of particular interest with respect to theoretical pandemic potential because they have been unusually pathogenic in domestic poultry and have infected and killed several hundred people over a 15-year period.",

These types of experiments can potentially provide clues about whether and how a virus might adapt to humans, and what prevention and control options might be useful if that virus did emerge. Much H5N1 research of this type has already been published, including viral genetic engineering to evaluate properties such as pathogenicity and transmissibility in ferrets and other animal models.

World Health Organization (WHO) data indicate that since 2003, HPAI H5N1 viruses have infected 603 people and killed 356 (ref. 9). Technically, the term \u2018highly pathogenic\u2019 refers only to the effects of certain H5 and H7 influenza viruses in poultry, not in humans or other mammals; most such viruses either cannot infect, or are relatively harmless in, humans. HPAI H5 and H7 phenotypes are both associated with mutations in the haemagglutinin (HA) gene that usually result from insertion of a sequence of codons encoding multiple basic amino acids at the location where the two linked protein domains comprising the mature HA are cleaved during infection10. This cleavage site change leads to disseminated viral replication in multiple organs of avian species, resulting in high mortality. However, in humans, who cannot be easily infected with most low pathogenicity or HPAI viruses, if they can be infected at all, efficient replication outside the respiratory tract generally does not occur. Therefore, despite the current unusual situation with H5N1 viruses in humans since 2003 (see below), neither H5N1 nor other HPAI viruses would necessarily replicate systemically or cause extreme pathogenicity should human adaptation occur. Although the basis of HPAI H5N1 viral pathogenicity in severe and fatal human cases remains unknown, there is no evidence suggesting that it results from changes known to be associated with viral adaptation to gallinaceous poultry; in fact, no human-adapted or pandemic influenza virus contains genetic changes indicative of prior poultry adaptation.",

An apparent misconception has nevertheless arisen in recent public discussions of these studies, namely that the engineered, ferret-transmissible H5N1 viruses were extremely pathogenic in ferrets after intranasal inoculation or aerosol transmission. This notion seems to have resulted in part from misunderstandings about a technique\u2014intratracheal inoculation\u2014used in a separate sub-study reported in the manuscript by the Fouchier group14,15, a method that is not directly relevant to viral transmissibility or natural pathogenesis. As documented since the 1940s16, intratracheal inoculation of influenza viruses is not a \u2018model\u2019 for natural viral pathogenicity; influenza viruses that are otherwise considered to be of low pathogenicity often induce severe and even fatal disease in animals when administered by this route, including the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus15. The presentation of transmissibility studies alongside high-dose intratracheal inoculation pathogenesis studies in the Fouchier manuscript seems to have suggested (incorrectly) to some that the engineered transmissible H5N1 virus is deadly after intranasal inoculation or aerosol transmission between ferrets and, by extension, might be both transmissible and deadly for humans, that is, a virus of deadly pandemic potential. No evidence has yet been presented to support this, although the possibility that additional unspecified genetic changes might do so cannot be excluded.",

Conceivably, the considerable host-switching mutations associated with adaptation of wild bird viruses to gallinaceous poultry, or at least of wild viruses to HPAI poultry viruses, represent an evolutionary pathway divergent from those pathways associated with mammalian adaptation, seemingly presenting an additional challenge for poultry-adapted influenza viruses to achieve efficient mammalian adaptation17.

Influenza viruses, SARS coronavirus and Ebola virus have all been passaged in mice to enhance virulence; the resulting host-adapted viruses have been studied biologically and used to evaluate strategies for control and prevention. However, adaptational mutations resulting from serial passage tend to be host-specific and may not produce the same outcomes in other species. For example, the classical swine influenza virus, A/swine/Iowa/1930 (H1N1), is very pathogenic in ferrets and mice but poses no threat to humans27. Another example is mouse-adapted Ebola virus, which is lethal for mice and guinea pigs but attenuated for nonhuman primates28,29. Ferrets are susceptible to a wide range of viruses including influenza viruses, SARS coronavirus, canine distemper virus and some parvoviruses, many of which do not infect humans or other mammals. A number of influenza viruses that replicate efficiently in ferrets30,31,32,33 seem poorly able, or unable, to infect humans, even after experimental challenge34. Thus, pathogenicity and transmissibility of any influenza virus in ferrets cannot be used directly to predict what type and severity of disease the same virus might produce in humans and human populations.",

Unfortunately, there is no perfect animal model capable of reproducing all of the important variables involved in human influenza infection, although each animal model may be useful in understanding some aspect of influenza biology. Unlike most other mammals, ferrets generally can be infected with many or most avian, mammalian and human influenza viruses without prior viral adaptation, and often transmit efficiently between them35, providing useful general information about the viral genetic basis of phenotypic properties such as infectivity, pathogenicity, transmissibility and immune responses35, even though the findings cannot necessarily be directly applied to human infections36,37,38. Furthermore, in decades of research, using a large number of different avian and mammalian influenza viruses, severe or fatal disease has not often been observed in ferrets following intranasal inoculation or aerosol exposure.",

Specifically, many naturally occurring influenza viruses that infect, and often transmit between, ferrets are not known to infect people or cause human disease27,30,31,32,33,39,40. Ferrets are thus an imperfect model for predicting human infectivity or transmissibility, let alone the high level of transmissibility characteristic of pandemic spread. On the basis of public presentations by the senior authors of the two studies in question, neither of the engineered H5N1 viruses was as efficiently transmissible in ferrets as the human-adapted 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus14,15. Phenotypic properties such as replication, pathogenicity and transmissibility are likely to be polygenic traits driven by mutations that are independent and possibly competing10,41. Transmissibility is a complex phenotype that probably requires cooperative changes in more than one gene segment, and these may differ greatly between different viruses that become transmissible. Mutations that confer transmissibility in a ferret may be species-specific and irrelevant to other hosts42. There are probably multiple unique virus-specific pathways to transmissibility for particular viruses infecting particular hosts43. For example, transmissibility of the 1918 pandemic H1N1 virus has been linked to changes in the genes encoding HA and PB2 proteins36,37, whereas transmissibility of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus, which has a closely related HA, has been linked to gene segments encoding the neuraminidase and matrix proteins44.",

Evidence from China\u2019s Qinghai Lake, for example, shows 13.4% H5N1 seropositivity and 3.4% active infection in apparently healthy, live-caught rodents called pikas51. Clearly, adaptation of an influenza virus to a specific mammalian host does not necessarily predict its infectiousness, pathogenicity or transmissibility in other mammals, even though valuable insights into mechanisms of disease, host responses, and prevention and treatment may be obtained by studying these particular animals. Such insights can provide valuable clues in designing countermeasures against deadly epidemics and pandemics.",

In 500 years of observation, no influenza pandemic is believed to have caused a case-fatality rate over about 2% (ref. 52); pandemic and seasonal circulation of H1, H2 and H3 influenza viruses over the past century have all produced lower overall mortality rates53. The widely cited 59% figure is not a mortality rate but a case-fatality rate computed from cumulative cases reported to WHO since 20039. (Case fatality refers to fatal cases divided by all fatal plus non-fatal cases combined.) By general consensus, the WHO figure probably overestimates actual mortality. Among other concerns common to epidemiological data, the WHO case definition54 features diagnostic severity criteria (evidence of an acute pneumonia on chest radiograph plus evidence of respiratory failure) that constitute a self-fulfilling prophecy for fatality; as with many illnesses studied epidemiologically, severe diseases are more likely to receive optimal diagnostic work-up (\u2018detection bias\u2019); and most H5N1 cases have been reported from countries with limited resources for identifying milder cases, if they occurred. These factors together could combine to erroneously inflate case-fatality calculations by over-counting severe cases and under-counting mild cases55.",

Forty-six published H5N1 seroprevalence studies of various exposure categories (household contacts, healthcare workers, poultry workers, and so on) show generally low H5N1 seroprevalence (mean, 1.7% of 21,435 persons examined in all 46 studies combined (a bibliography of these studies is available from the authors on request)). Given intense poultry and other exposures in many study areas, these low rates at first seem perplexing, especially when compared to the much higher seroprevalence rates in humans for other avian influenza viruses such as H9N2 (ref. 56). When such information is considered in light of statistically significant clustering of non-human-transmitted (that is, presumably avian-acquired) household cases in genetically related versus unrelated persons57,58, a reasonable explanation seems to us to be that H5N1 is so poorly adapted to humans that exposure does not normally lead to infection or even the development of a detectable immune response57,59, except in persons with specific but undefined genetic susceptibilities, many of whom become cases60,61,62. There are few data on what the basis of such genetic susceptibilities may be, although recent evidence has linked severe human influenza to a minor IFITM3 allele63, supporting the suspicion that genetic determinants of influenza infection and replication in humans do exist.",

Some proposed that \u2018censoring\u2019 this information actually increases the risk of bioterrorism85. The two studies under discussion1,2 can help augment surveillance to detect naturally emerging viruses with pandemic potential and expand our knowledge of the principles underlying host adaptation. Although the dangers of \u2018information release\u2019 in the case of these two studies is probably small or nil\u2014because all or most of the critical information is widely available anyway\u2014it nevertheless remains important to rethink larger questions about balancing safety (accidental or deliberate release of an influenza virus or any dangerous pathogen) with the need to study such viruses to learn enough of their biology to prevent and control them.

            "text": "In considering the threat of bioterrorism or accidental release of genetically engineered viruses, it is worth remembering that nature is the ultimate bioterrorist. Indeed, H5N1 mutations, including some of those made in the two studies under discussion1,2, occur spontaneously in nature, probably at a high rate, although they have not yet led to a pandemic. Given the relative rarity of pandemics caused by newly emerging influenza viruses, their explosive transmissibility may result from unique and virus-specific mutational changes that arise at very low frequency. For past pandemics, we have had limited ability to detect such changes by surveillance or by animal model experimentation. Thus, our best hope in preventing and controlling the microbial agents that continually challenge us is to increase fundamental knowledge about the mechanisms by which they emerge, spread and cause disease, so that we can develop countermeasures such as enhanced surveillance, better diagnostics, vaccines and drug therapies. In moving forward we need to be safety conscious and to have consensus safety measures and policies in place, while at the same time using all available tools to seek broad understanding about the complex relationships between viruses and hosts. It is only this knowledge that stands between us and the devastation of future influenza pandemics. In reconsidering the proper balance between progress and safety, the critical importance of advancing scientific knowledge needs to be kept front and centre.",
