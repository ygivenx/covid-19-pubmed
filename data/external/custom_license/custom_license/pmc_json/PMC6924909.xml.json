Scharf, Director of Astrobiology at Columbia University, writes \u201cOn a finite world a cosmic perspective isn\u2019t a luxury, it\u2019s a necessity.\u201d Consider that the distance between the earth and sun equals \u2248100 million miles. One of the nearest stars to Earth, Alpha Centauri shimmers some 4.4 light-years away. Put another way, if the distance from the earth to the sun were fixed at 1 inch, then one of Earth\u2019s closest neighbors would be 4.4 miles (7 km) distant. The Milky Way, our home galaxy, comprises something in the range of 200\u2013300 billion stars. It is nestled among the other 2 trillion or so galaxies estimated to populate the observable universe, postulated to have a radius of 13.8 billion light-years.",

That means there are potentially 5\u201310 million times more viruses on Earth than stars thought to exist in the observable universe. Science writer Carl Zimmer offers this perspective: \u201cIf you were to stack one virus on top of another, you\u2019d create a tower that would stretch beyond the moon, beyond the sun, beyond Alpha Centauri, out past the edge of the Milky Way, past neighboring galaxies, to reach a height of 200 million light years.\u201d",

Debate lingers about whether viruses are alive. Virologists Marc H.V. van Regenmortel and Brian W.J. Mahy explain that \u201cA virus becomes part of a living system only after it has infected a host cell and its genome becomes integrated with that of the cell. Viruses are replicated only through the metabolic activities of infected cells, and they occupy a unique position in biology. They are nonliving infectious entities that can be said, at best, to lead a kind of borrowed life.\u201d ",

He favored watercolors, often combined with gouache, pencil, charcoal, or pastels. Art scholar Paloma Alarc\u00f3 notes that \u201cBurchfield, who was well versed in astronomy, felt a special attraction for the sky and heavenly bodies\u2014not only the sun and moon but also the Pleiades and certain constellations of stars, particularly Orion, which appears in winter.\u201d Indeed, the artist featured Orion, one most prominent and recognizable constellations visible from almost everywhere on earth, in 3 other paintings.",
