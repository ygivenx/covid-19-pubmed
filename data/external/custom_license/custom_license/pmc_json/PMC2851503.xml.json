Four consecutive Metropolis-coupled Markov chain Monte Carlo computations were run for 2 million generations, with trees sampled every 100 generations. Initial trees were random. On the basis of stabilization of preliminary runs, the first 3,000 trees were discarded before generation of the consensus tree.

We used heuristic searches (10 replicates, random addition of taxa, with tree bisection and reconnection branch swapping), followed by 100 bootstrap iterations for robustness of the ML tree. Bayesian analysis was also used to construct a tree with 4 simultaneous Markov chains for 1 million generations. Trees were sampled every 20 generations, and the first 5,000 trees were discarded before the consensus tree was made (on the basis of practical values of stabilizing likelihood).",

Bat SARS-like CoVs formed a monophyletic clade. Species-specific host restriction was found for CoVs in 4 of 7 bats species (Myotis ricketti, M. magnater, P. abramus, and T. pachypus) sampled from >1 geographic location, and these clustered with high Bayesian posterior probability. Overall phylogenetic relationships between virus lineages were similar across our analyses, and well-supported genetic structure was observed within some CoV lineages. For example, CoVs isolated from M. magnater were monophyletic but formed 3 well-supported clades with no evidence of geographic structure (Bayesian posterior probability [PP] = 1.0 for each). A similar pattern was apparent in CoVs from Myotis ricketti, which formed 2 geographically overlapping independent clades (PP = 0.99 and 1.0, respectively). One T. pachypus was infected by a virus that clustered with moderate statistical support (PP = 0.91) within the larger clade associated with P. abramus, which indicated a potential interspecies transmission event or recent evolutionary host shift (defined as interspecies transmission followed by establishment and long-term persistence in the new host species [18]) (Figure 1).",

A similar relationship was apparent among the viruses of some closely related genera (e.g., Pipistrellus and Tylonycteris), whereby divergence of each genus was mirrored by divergence in viral phylogeny. However, viruses are usually thought to have evolved more recently than their hosts (31). Thus, apparent coevolutionary patterns may reflect either a high frequency of host shift among closely related bat species or simultaneous lineage splitting of hosts and viruses. Host shifts among related bats might be favored by a variety of mechanisms, including preadaptation to overcome immune defenses or greater rates of interspecific contact relative to distantly related bat species.

Genetic diversity in the vespertilionids sampled was nearly double that of the rhinolophids, which was probably due to the greater number of species sampled and their broader taxonomic range. Despite this greater genetic diversity among vespertilionid bat hosts, the genetic diversity of CoVs did not differ between vespertilionids and rhinopholids. This diversity suggests that vespertilionids may maintain undiscovered CoVs or that rhinolophids might harbor disproportionate CoV diversity relative to diversity of their genus.

First, SARS-like CoVs and other rhinolophid CoVs (RfV1 and RpV1) show evidence of interspecies transmission. Second, CoVs from other bat groups that are phylogenetically much closer to RfV1 and RpV1 than to the SARS-like CoVs do not show evidence of successful host shifts.

The potential for close contact between bats, civets, and humans in the wildlife trade in southern China, coupled with a possible propensity of these bats to foster CoV host-shifts, could explain SARS-like CoVs as the source of SARS-CoV. This potential supports molecular results on bat CoVs that suggest a recent host shift from bats to civets or other animals and humans (34). Such host shifts may indicate a risk posed by other bat CoVs for novel disease emergence. Finally, the ability of SARS-like CoVs to be transmitted between and establish in new species (i.e., to undergo host shifts) is consistent with other CoVs. This has been shown for several CoVs of livestock species (35) and has been used to support their inclusion as 1 of the groups of viruses most likely to be responsible for emerging zoonoses, even before the emergence of SARS (36).",
