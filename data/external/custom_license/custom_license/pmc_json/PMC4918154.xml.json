Clinical signs are most prominent in young suckling pigs, in which high mortality rates are common. As seen in recent porcine epidemic diarrhea outbreaks in the United States and Asia, the effect on the pig industry can be tremendous.",

This study also reported a new recombinant CoV strain with a TGEV backbone and a PEDV spike gene (SeCoV/Italy/213306/2009; KR061459), which was identified as a swine enteric CoV (SeCoV).

Network analysis of complete genome sequences of similar CoVs underline the chimeric nature of the genome between TGEV and PEDV genome sequences (Technical Appendix Figure, panel A). The chimeric nature of the virus strain was confirmed by RT-PCR with primers spanning possible recombination sites and analysis of overlapping reads from next-generation sequencing.",

Downstream of the spike protein\u2013coding open reading frame (ORF), an additional hypothetical ORF was identified in both SeCoV sequences. The coded amino acid sequences (27 aa in the virus from Germany and 30 aa in the virus from Italy) resembled an N- and C-terminally truncated TGEV nonstructural protein 3a. The difference of 3 aa between the 2 strains is the result of a 10-bp deletion at the 3\u2032-end of the hypothetical ORF, which shifted the stop 3 codons to the 5\u2032- end (Technical Appendix Figure, panel B) in SeCoV/GER/L00930/2012.

Although these findings support the notion that CoV genomes are subject to mutations and recombination events, problems in disease diagnosis can be foreseen. In countries where porcine epidemic diarrhea, transmissible gastroenteritis, or both of these diseases are reportable, correct diagnosis and reporting might be difficult. Thus, diagnosticians should be aware of possible recombinants of swine CoVs. Diagnostic problems can be prevented by use of a double-check strategy with techniques specific for different genome regions. Apart from diagnostic obstacles, the effect of virus recombinations in terms of virulence and organ tropism is unknown and needs further investigations.",
