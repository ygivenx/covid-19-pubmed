            "text": "The principal mechanism of translation is the accurate decoding of the triplet codon sequences in one reading frame of mRNA. Specific signals built into the mRNA sequences can cause deviations from this rule. Viruses exploit several translational \u2018recoding\u2019 mechanisms, including translational hopping, stop codon readthrough and programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) [reviewed in (1,2)], for regulating the amount of proteins produced from their polyproteins. For positive-stranded RNA viruses, \u22121 PRF is the prevailing recoding mechanism and an essential determinant of the stoichiometry of synthesized viral proteins. Most viral \u22121 PRF signals are regulating the production of replication-associated proteins. Depending on the virus, the efficiency of \u22121 PRF can vary between 1 and 40% (3), and changes in the efficiency can inhibit virus assembly and replication (4\u20136). Therefore, \u22121 PRF can be regarded as a potential target for antiviral agents (4,7). However, the development of efficient antiviral drugs is still hindered, since little is known about the trans-acting factors and the biophysical parameters affecting the \u22121 PRF efficiencies. Database searches have identified putative frameshift signals from a substantial number of chromosomally encoded eukaryotic mRNAs (8). Thus, \u22121 PRF may also have an impact on the complexity of the proteome of several eukaryotic organisms.",

            "text": "Two cis-acting signals, a slippery heptamer X XXY YYZ (the incoming reading frame indicated) and a downstream secondary structure, direct the slippage and are therefore essential for this event (9). \u22121 PRF takes place after the accommodation step in the slippery sequence by simultaneous slippage of both tRNAs into the overlapping \u22121 frame XXX YYY (9,10). The sequence of the heptamer allows post-slippage base-pairing between the non-wobble bases of the tRNAs and the new \u22121 frame codons of the mRNA. Downstream RNA secondary structures [reviewed in (11)] force the ribosomes to pause, and place the ribosomal A- and P-sites correctly over the slippery sequence (12). However, the pausing of the ribosomes is not sufficient for \u22121 PRF to occur (13); in fact, the duration of the halt does not necessarily correlate with the level of the \u22121 PRF observed (12). Crystallographic, molecular, biochemical and genetic studies suggest that a pseudoknot restricts the movement of the mRNA during the tRNA accommodation step of elongation by filling the entrance of the ribosomal mRNA tunnel (14). This restriction can be eased either by unwinding the pseudoknot, which allows the mRNA to move forward, or by a slippage of the mRNA one nucleotide backwards. Chemical agents such as antibiotics, certain mutations in the translation apparatus, and in translation elongation factors that change the translation fidelity and kinetics, have been shown to influence \u22121 PRF efficiency [(10,15); reviewed in (16)].",

Up- and downstream sequences such as termination codons in the vicinity of the \u22121 PRF signals, or even several kilobases away from them, can affect the \u22121 PRF efficiencies (3,17\u201322). A specific sequence in the Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR), 4 kb downstream from the slippage site, is vital for \u22121 PRF (6,19). A stimulating effect is achieved through the formation of a tertiary structure, where complementary nucleotides from the 3\u2032 UTR base pair with a single-stranded bulge in the cis-acting stem\u2013loop (6). Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was also shown to require a more complex secondary structure instead of a simple stem\u2013loop for optimal \u22121 PRF in vivo (21,22). These investigations suggest that \u22121 PRF studies carried out with minimal frameshift signals may lead to inaccurate estimates of the stoichiometry of synthesized viral protein products during infection.",

It has a monopartite, single-stranded, 4082 nt long, positive-sense RNA genome (23,24). The polyprotein of CfMV is translated from two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) 2A and 2B by a \u22121 PRF mechanism (25). In this study, we wanted to determine the in vivo \u22121 PRF efficiency guided by the CfMV U UUA AAC heptamer and the stem\u2013loop structure. In addition to the minimal signal (18), we decided to test the effect of flanking CfMV sequences for their ability to contribute to \u22121 PRF. We found that the surrounding viral sequences promoted more efficient \u22121 PRF than the minimal signal sequence in vivo when measured with the dual reporter vector system developed by Stahl et al. (26). Therefore, we carried out an expression pattern and deletion analysis to understand the molecular basis of the observed upregulation. In addition, we critically analysed the suitability of the implemented experimental system for this type of a recoding study. An interesting possibility is that the viral proteins produced via \u22121 PRF could regulate \u22121 PRF. This hypothesis was tested by co-expressing the CfMV proteins P27 and replicase together with the dual reporter vectors.",

This dual reporter vector was a generous gift from Dr J. Rousset of the Universite Paris-Sud, France. The inserted sequences 1602\u20131720 (A region), 1386\u20132137 (B region) and 1551\u20131900 (C region), were amplified by PCR using pAB-21 as a template (18). Primers were used to introduce NheI and BglII sites to the flanking ends of the inserts. Since NheI digestion removed lacZ ORF, it was reintroduced into the plasmids as a final cloning step. The resulting plasmids were named pAC-A, pAC-B and pAC-C. Corresponding inframe controls, where one nucleotide was added in front of the slippery heptamer, were generated by PCR-based mutagenesis (Exsite, Stratagene) and named as pAC-Am, pAC-Bm and pAC-Cm, respectively. Deletion plasmids pAC-AB/ABm (1602\u20132137), pAC-AC/ACm (1602\u20131900), pAC-BA/BAm (1386\u20131720) and pAC-CA/CAm (1551\u20131720) were also generated. The target sequences are shown in Figure 1B. The base numbering refers to the CfMV genome as in (23). Transcription was driven from SV40 promoter. Plasmids encoded leucine (LEU2) and \u03b2-lactamase (ampicillin resistance) as selective markers. Plasmids were transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae H23 [MAT\u03b1 hsp150::URA3 ura3-1 his3-11 15leu2-3 112trp1-1 ade2-1 can100].

This is important, since the first reporter serves to control the variations among the abundance and translation rates of the studied mRNAs (26,30). In addition to changes in specific activities, heterologous fusions can cause alterations in the solubility and conformation, which can expose cryptic protease target sites and reduce the stability of the proteins (36). Therefore, for a reliable quantification of \u22121 PRF, it was important to test that equimolar amounts of fusions produced from the corresponding test and control constructs had similar enzymatic activities. Most inframe controls and the analogous test constructs had equal absolute \u03b2-galactosidase activities (Table 1). Comparable results were obtained, if activities were normalized with total protein concentration (data not shown). These results indicated that the length of the fusion as such did not affect the specific activities. The \u03b2-galactosidase activity from pAC-Am inframe control was also comparable to activity obtained from an empty pAC74, where this enzyme has no fusion (data not shown). This further supported the view that the few observed variations in the \u03b2-galactosidase activities more likely resulted from the changes in translatability or stability of the transcripts. In addition to pAC-Cm, two inframe controls pAC-Am and pAC-ACm showed \u223c25% lower \u03b2-galactosidase activities when compared to the equivalent test constructs (Table 1), indicating that the productivity from these constructs was reduced. Taken together, \u03b2-galactosidase seemed to fit well to be used as the first reporter and thus normalization factor in the in vivo experiments of this study.",

The BA and AB regions promoted \u22121 PRF as efficiently as the B region, whereas regions CA and AC were better than region A, but not as good as region B. In other words, the presence of nucleotides 1386\u20131720, or downstream nucleotides 1602\u20132137, was sufficient to increase \u22121 PRF to the level directed by the region B.

Cassettes containing the reporters and the studied intercistronic sequences were expressed and purified as N-terminal histidine fusions. This allowed us to capture all the N-terminally intact products. The affinity-purified proteins were separated in SDS\u2013PAGE gels, and visualized either by Coomassie staining (data not shown), or by western blotting with the CfMV-specific anti-VPg antibodies. The expected \u03b2-galactosidase\u2013CfMV fusions terminating at the end of the 0-frame in the test constructs were detected. Also, the longer transframe \u03b2-galactosidase\u2013CfMV\u2013firefly luciferase fusion proteins were present in both the test and the inframe constructs (Figure 3). Comparison of the Coomassie-stained gels with the western blots revealed that the antisera recognized the products terminating at the CfMV-encoding regions better than the transframe products. Furthermore, the small size of the CfMV-specific region in the pYES2/NT-Am decreased the binding of the antibodies to these inframe control fusions. Thus, this data were not suitable for quantitative analysis of \u22121 PRF. Interestingly, an additional protein, which reacted with CfMV-specific antisera, was co-purified from the cells expressing pYES2/NT-Bm and pYES2/NT-Cm inframe controls (Figure 3). The size of these fusions suggested that translation had terminated approximately at the site for \u22121 PRF signals. If such putative termination products were also present in cells expressing the test constructs, the correctly terminated 0-frame products in the western blots masked these products.",

This was also obvious when the firefly luciferase activities were normalized with the total protein amount. After setting the activity from pAC-Am to a relative value of one, the corresponding values from pAC-Bm and pAC-Cm were 0.80 and 0.28. Although the \u03b2-galactosidase measurements (Table 1) suggested that the overall translatability of the pAC-Cm mRNA was also reduced to some extent, it explained the decrease in firefly luciferase expression only partially. In the light of these findings, the extremely high \u22121 PRF frequency estimate calculated for the C-region could be explained with more frequent translation termination at the frameshift signals of the pAC-Cm mRNA, which reduced firefly luciferase activity in relation to \u03b2-galactosidase.",

Although LacZ-encoding gene is suitable for the in vivo studies, it is an unsuitable first reporter for the in vitro determination of \u22121 PRF efficiencies due to its big size (30). In good agreement with this, we observed several unexpected products in the in vitro translations programmed with LacZ\u2013CfMV\u2013luc mRNAs (data not shown). Renilla luciferase has been shown to retain its specific activity irrespective of the C-terminal fusions (30). Therefore, we decided to use Rluc\u2013CfMV\u2013luc transcripts to determine the \u22121 PRF efficiencies in the cell-free system. First, we verified the suitability of Renilla luciferase for the intended in vitro experiments as described in (30). Transcripts encoding monocistronic Renilla luciferase and Renilla luciferase fused to firefly luciferase (Rluc-Am/Cm-luc) were mixed in different ratios and used to program the in vitro translations. Increasing concentrations of transcripts encoding the Rluc-Am-luc fusion resulted in linearly growing firefly luciferase activities. At the same time Renilla luciferase activities remained constant, which showed that its enzymatic activity was not sensitive to the C-terminal fusions (Figure 4A). Similar results were obtained with Rluc-Cm-luc mRNA (data not shown). \u22121 PRF efficiencies were then determined with transcripts that contained CfMV regions A, B and C, and their corresponding inframe controls. In all cases, slightly higher \u22121 PRF frequencies were obtained than in vivo. In nice correlation with the in vivo results, enhanced \u22121 PRF was observed with the region B, although the effect was weaker than in vivo. In this context, region C did not differ from the minimal region A in its capacity to program \u22121 PRF (Figure 4B).",

Western blot analysis with antisera against ORF2A or 2B did not detect any proteins produced from these vectors (data not shown). The obtained LUC/LacZ ratios were compared to those measured from cells expressing the CfMV proteins (pYES-P27 or pYES-Rep). LUC/LacZ ratios measured from cells expressing replicase were slightly lower than the ratios calculated from cells harbouring pYES-Rep\u0394AUG plasmids, being \u223c90% when co-expressed with pAC-A and \u223c84% when co-expressed with pAC-Am. In the presence of P27, LUC/LacZ ratio of pAC-A reached \u223c81% of expression measured from cells transformed with pYES-P27\u0394AUG. Again the effect of P27 expression was more evident with pAC-Am inframe control as P27 expression reduced LUC/LacZ ratio to half (\u223c48%) when compared to the corresponding value measured from the cells harbouring pYES-P27\u0394AUG. This verified that CfMV P27 was able to reduce the downstream reporter expression from dual reporter mRNAs. Since CfMV P27 had a proportionally stronger effect to firefly luciferase production from the inframe control mRNAs in comparison to the test mRNAs (Table 2), the calculated \u22121 PRF efficiency increased from 14.7 to 22.4%.",

            "text": "Since \u22121 PRF studies are affected by a huge number of different parameters, it is not an easy task to determine the real ratio between the proteins produced via this mechanism in vivo. However, in viral systems, the efficiency of \u22121 PRF is an essential determinant of the stoichiometry of synthesized viral protein products, which must be rigidly maintained for efficient propagation of the virus. For example, frameshifting in retroviruses determines the ratio of structural (Gag) to enzymatic (Gag-Pol) proteins, and plays a critical role in viral particle assembly (5). In this study, the capacity of CfMV frameshift signals to direct efficient \u22121 PRF was analysed in vivo by using dual reporter vectors. The length of the CfMV sequence clearly affected the actual efficiency percent in vivo. The PRF efficiency was elevated when longer viral sequences were directing the \u22121 PRF, but the deletion analysis did not identify any specific region as being solely responsible for the enhancement. Up- and downstream sequences nearby or far away from the cis-acting signals have been reported to enhance \u22121 PRF in other viruses, such as HIV, human T-cell leukaemia virus and BYDV (6,19,20). Also out-of-frame stop codons have been shown to influence \u22121 PRF frequency in vitro in retroviruses (17) and in CfMV (18). A study on the spacer sequences located between the cis-acting signals showed that high slippage frequencies were obtained when the first three nucleotides were G/U, G/A and G/A, the first two being the most important (37). In CfMV, the spacer starts with UAC, which partially explains the capacity of the CfMV sequence to promote high slippage levels. In this study, the observed enhancement of \u22121 PRF was, however, caused by sequences that were not in the immediate vicinity of the slippery sequence thus indicating that CfMV sequences further away also have an influence on the level of frameshifting in vivo. We conclude that the most reliable estimates for \u22121 PRF and consequently for the amount of replicase versus the 0-frame translation product P27 can be obtained only by using the full-length viral sequences. In reality, such a study would however be hampered by the non-quantitative nature of the western blot analysis, the presence of different polyprotein processing intermediates, and the differences in the stabilities of the end products in the infected cells.",

We can hypothesize that one reason for the high efficiency is the slippery tRNAAsn encoding the AAC triplet of the CfMV heptamer. Equal U UUA AAC slippery heptamer has been measured to induce 20\u201340% of \u22121 PRF in a diversity of animal viruses [(39); reviewed in (3)]. The low fitness of CfMV \u22121 PRF signals in bacteria is in agreement with the poor functioning of the eukaryotic slippery heptamers of the order X XXA AAC in prokaryotes (40\u201342). IBV RNA, having an identical shifty heptamer, has been shown to direct \u22121 PRF at similar 2\u20133% level in bacteria (41). A recent study reported that XXXAAAC heptamers dictate \u22121 PRF to occur via the slippage of two adjacent tRNAs placed over the heptamer, irrespective of whether the host is an eukaryote or a prokaryote (42). Therefore, the inability of prokaryotic translation systems to direct efficient \u22121 PRF from this heptamer is not an inherited property of prokaryotic tRNAAsn, but results from differences in the ribosomes (42).",

Transient polypeptide intermediates that result from the pausing of ribosomes in the slippery sequences have been observed during IBV and S.cerevisiae L-A virus polyprotein synthesis (12,13,43,44). A pseudoknot structure formed by IBV mRNA causes a translational pause at fixed position upstream the secondary structure regardless of whether the slippery heptamer is present or absent (12). Based on the findings of this study, we propose that also here a certain percent of ribosomes stalled at the secondary structure of the frameshift site in our inframe control and test mRNAs in yeast, and this led to the prematurely terminated products observed with the inframe control constructs pAC-Bm and -Cm. Although not unambiguously proven by this study, high frequency of termination of translation especially at the frameshift site of the pAC-Cm mRNA would nicely explain the extremely high calculated \u22121 PRF efficiency.",

            "text": "Factors that change the translation fidelity and kinetics have been shown to influence \u22121 PRF efficiency [(10,15); reviewed in (16)]. Autoregulation of +1 frameshifting by mammalian ornithine decarboxylase antizyme has been reported (45). This mechanism allows modulation of frameshifting frequency according to the cellular concentration of polyamines. One could speculate that such a regulation mechanism could also be useful to adjust the amounts of the replication-associated proteins to match the requirements of different phases in viral replication cycle. This hypothesis was studied by expressing CfMV proteins P27 and replicase together with pAC-A and pAC-Am in yeast cells. Since \u03b2-galactosidase production remained constant regardless of the presence or absence of CfMV proteins, they did not interfere with translation initiation from pAC-A/Am mRNAs per se. However, P27 expression caused a reduction in the firefly luciferase production especially from the inframe control, whereas replicase production only slightly increased the firefly luciferase production from pAC-A, but not from pAC-Am. Since replicase expression had only a faint effect on the normalized firefly luciferase production via \u22121 PRF, our conclusion is that CfMV replicase had no pronounced effect on translation at the frameshift site. Co-expression of the non-translatable form of P27 with the dual reporter vectors verified that P27 truly affected firefly luciferase expression on the protein level. Therefore, we propose that CfMV protein P27 may influence translation at the frameshift site. If CfMV P27 indeed interferes with viral protein synthesis during CfMV infection, the mechanism, its specificity and the possible biological role needs to be elucidated in the future.",
