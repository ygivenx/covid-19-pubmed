As S is expressed in lower amounts when compared to other IBV proteins (as discussed above) and thus its synthesis relies on those tRNAs of lower availability in G. gallus cells, this could be the reason for the presence of drift in a nearly neutral evolution mode, i.e., for some S1 sequences codons there\u2019s no competition with host tRNAs and thus third positions nucleotides are not subjected to selection but might follow the whole genome GC % trend instead.",
