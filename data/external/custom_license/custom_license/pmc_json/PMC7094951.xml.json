On 13 January, the US health department declared the country off-limits to civets in a precaution against an outbreak of SARS, the flu-like illness first reported in China last February. Nobody has yet proved that the animals were the source of the SARS epidemic, but scientists have found that civets on sale in Chinese markets harbour viruses that are very similar to those that cause SARS. US health officials say that since the civet market is not large in the United States \u2014 only 50 are imported every year \u2014 this limited evidence convinced them to enact a ban. And they say that they are looking for a more widespread approach to the problem of animal-borne, or zoonotic, diseases.",
