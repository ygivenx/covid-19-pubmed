First, the knowledge of the epidemiology of the PC with the different prevalence of infectious and non-infectious etiologies can be accurately determined. Second, predetermined criteria for performing a FOB should clarify the role of this technique by better defining the diagnostic yield, clinical implications and potential complications. Finally, the identification of prognostic factors is much more precise when data are recorded prospectively in a homogeneous group of immunocompromised patients.",

Remarkably, viruses were the most common cause of pulmonary infections, representing 47% (19/40) of pneumonias. Of note, 26% of the episodes of viral pneumonia were mixed (both bacteria and viruses) confirming that co-infection is a common occurrence in these patients.26 The associated mortality of viral pneumonias was lower than the mortality caused by bacteria, corroborating the results from different series.27,28 However, the important role that viruses have in the genesis of PC reinforces the importance of prevention strategies.29",

This finding confirms the current predominance of Gram-negative rods over Gram-positive cocci observed by other authors.30 Interestingly, fluoroquinolone resistance was frequent (36% of P. aeruginosa isolates) probably owing to the widespread use of fluoroquinolone prophylaxis. This is particularly important as the associated mortality of P. aeruginosa in our series was 45%. Therefore the implementation of prophylactic protocols should be periodically re-evaluated in HSCT recipients depending on the different resistance patterns of each institution.2,30",

Remarkably, nasopharyngeal swab was a very useful diagnostic tool providing the diagnosis of viral pneumonia in 75% of cases, and in all of them the results were confirmed with BAL.29 Azoulay et al.17 confirmed the utility of non-invasive tests in critically ill hematology and oncology patients with acute respiratory failure. More controversial is the role of FOB in the management of PC.9,15,32,33 In our cohort, with pre-established criteria to perform FOB, the overall diagnostic yield was 67% and increased up to 78% in pulmonary infections. Overall, 28% of the episodes of pulmonary infection could only be diagnosed by this technique. In almost half of the cases, the information obtained caused a change in the empiric treatment. Interestingly, in cases with negative non-invasive tests, the diagnostic yield of FOB was 62% (Figure 2) demonstrating its utility in this particular scenario. Even in those patients with positive non-invasive tests, but with an unsolved or unfavorable clinical course, FOB identified unsuspected microorganisms in 24% of the cases (Figure 2). Early FOB proportioned a significant increase of isolated pathogens compared with late FOB and mortality in the former group was somewhat lower, although the difference was not statistically significant. Our group had already shown that one of the most critical factors influencing the yield of FOB is the time elapsed between the initiation of symptoms and FOB performance.7,34 Establishing an early diagnosis leads to changes in empirical treatment and probably, improvement in prognosis. Shannon et al.33 highlighted the importance of early diagnosis demonstrating that the diagnostic yield of FOB wanes with the elapsed time following clinical presentation. As in other series, we did not observe remarkable side effects after FOB.2,9,33 In this sense, the conclusive demonstration by Azoulay et al.,17 in a prospective randomized study showing that FOB does not increase the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation, reinforce the safety of this procedure and should help reluctant physicians caring for these patients to implement this procedure in early stages.",
