The disease was first reported in China in 1976 [6], caused serious economic losses due to the death of neonatal piglets and weight loss of the infected pigs. Clinical signs of PED include anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration. Morbidity and mortality in infected neonatal piglets less than 5 days old approach 100% because of severe diarrhea and dehydration. However, mortality in infected piglets older than 10 days is less than 10% [1].",

Group I members are the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), feline and canine coronavirus (FCoV and CCoV), and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E). Group II includes porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV), murine hepatitis virus (MHV), bovine, equine, and rat coronavirus (BCoV, ECoV, and RtCoV), and human coronavirus OC43 (HcoV-OC43). Group III is specific for avian species including turkey coronavirus (TCoV), pheasant coronavirus and avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). The coronavirus N protein has been shown to be highly variable in size as well as in amino acid composition between the viruses that comprise the three coronavirus antigenic groups but highly conserved within these groups. Group I viral genomes have the smallest nucleocapsid protein with 378\u2013389 residues, group II genomes have the largest with 449\u2013455 residues and Group III 409 residues. All 5 PEDV strains had 441 amino acid residues, and have a longer peptide than other Group I members, which illuminate PEDV, a particular case is an exception to the rule of the coronavirus N protein has been shown to be highly conserved within these groups.",
