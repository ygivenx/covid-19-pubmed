All viral species names were synonymized to ICTV 8th edition, which was the global authority on viral taxonomy at the start of our data collection in 201016. From 2010\u201315 the authors and a team of research assistants and interns at EcoHealth Alliance compiled mammal species associations for each of 586 unique viruses published in the literature between 1940\u20132015 initially by using the virus name and synonyms as the search keywords in the major online reference databases (Web of Science, PubMed, and Google scholar) in addition to searching in books, reviews, and literature cited in sources we had already obtained. To narrow the search for hosts for well-researched viruses, we additionally included the terms \u201chost(s)\u201d, \u201creservoir\u201d, \u201cwildlife\u201d, \u201canimals\u201d, \u201csurveillance\u201d, and other relevant terms to find publications related to host range. Associations were cross-checked for completeness with the Global Mammal Parasite Database for primate, carnivore and ungulate viruses, version as of Nov 2006 (GMPD, www.mammalparasites.org)30 and other published reviews specific to bats and rodents12,31,32. We excluded all records without species-level host information, and those where we could not track down the primary references. Records of mammal-virus associations from experimental infection studies, zoological parks or captive breeding facilities, or cell culture discoveries were excluded. Host species were defined as domestic vs. wild following the list of domestic animal species from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)33, and we removed the black rat (Rattus rattus) and domestic mouse (Mus musculus) from the domesticated list as these two species make up their own \u201cperi-domestic\u201d category. Host species were categorized as either occurring in human modified habitats or being hunted by humans \u2013 both estimates for human contact \u2013 according to the IUCN Red List species descriptions34.",

We exhaustively searched the literature to identify a \u2018stringent\u2019 detection for each mammal-virus pair, and only included the serological finding for that pair if no molecular or viral isolation studies were available. We partitioned data and conducted separate analyses for the entire dataset (0 +1 + 2 detection quality) and the \u2018stringent\u2019 data (score of 2) to reduce the noise from potential serological cross-reactivity.

We recorded two values for the number of research papers for a host. The first was a simple search by scientific binomial in Zoological Abstracts where we recorded the number of papers published between 1940\u20132013 for each host species. We also recorded the number of disease-related publications for each species using the scientific binomial AND topic keyword: disease* OR virus* OR pathogen* OR parasit*. The * operator was used in our search criteria to capture all words that begin with each term, e.g. \u201cparasit\u201d (= \u201cparasite\u201d, \u201cparasites\u201d, and \u201cparasitic\u201d). These search criteria broadly included papers that examined disease or diseases, virus or viruses, pathogen or pathogens, parasite parasites, or parasitology, for each species. Only one measure of per host research effort was included at a time in model selection. As these metrics are highly correlated and the number of disease related citations per host outperformed the total number of publications per host in all but one model (all-data zoonoses), we decided to use disease-related publications as our per-species research effort measure for all models to improve interoperability. We also recorded the number of publications for each of 586 virus species using a keyword search by virus name in PubMed and Web of Science. Only one measure of per virus research effort was included at a time in model selection.",

Blomberg\u2019s K measures phylogenetic signal in a given trait by quantifying trait variance relative to an expectation under a Brownian motion null model of evolution using a phylogenetic tree with varying branch lengths. Blomberg\u2019s K-values are scaled from 0 to infinity, with a value of 0 equal to no phylogenetic signal and values greater than 1 equal to strong phylogenetic signal for closely related species that share more similar trait values. While there is no clearly defined K-value cut-off in which to apply phylogenetic comparative methods, non-significant value of <1, or more conservatively <0.5, are typical for traits that are phylogenetically independent. The only host variables we examined with significant K-values >0.5 were host body mass, and our direct measure of phylogenetic distance to humans. While there are several tools available to control for phylogeny in multivariate analyses, e.g. using phylogenetic generalized least square models (e.g. PGLS)42, there is currently no modeling approach to control for phylogeny using GAMs. More importantly, a wholesale effort to control for phylogeny across all variables in our analysis was not appropriate here, as we are explicitly testing the relative importance of phylogenetic distance to humans vs. other host traits including measures of human-wildlife contact to predict the proportion of zoonotic viruses for a given host species. This left body mass as the only variable in our models, excluding our direct measures of phylogenetic distance, with a significant Blomberg K value that was greater than one. We controlled for the significant effect of shared evolutionary history using a phylogenetic eigenvector regression (PVR)43,44 on body mass. The PVR approach allowed us to remove phylogenetic signal for any phylogenetically non-independent variables and then include the corrected values back in our GAMs, while retaining predictor variables like phylogenetic distance to humans as unmodified. We calculated PVR for body mass using the R package \u2018PVR\u2019 and our custom-build maximum likelihood host phylogeny using cytochrome B sequences constrained to the order-level topology of the mammalian supertree29,45. Our new variable for body mass that controls for phylogenetic signal (PVRcytb_resid) removed most of the phylogenetic signal, with K= 3.5 unadjusted, and K<0.5 after PVR correction. Our new metric of body mass scales in the same way, with larger values equal to species with larger body mass. PVR body mass was included in our GAM model selection for the total viral richness and zoonotic virus models.",

First the mammal supertree was pruned in R (package ape, function \u2018drop.tips\u2019) to include only synonymous species for the 753 species in our database29,46. We synonymized all host species names between the mammal supertree and the host associations in our database using the IUCN Red List34. If the species was listed as \u2018cattle\u2019 it was assumed to be Bos taurus, all other records were excluded if there was ambiguity as to the scientific name for the host species. Second, a maximum likelihood cytB tree was generated using the constraint of a multifurcating tree with taxa constrained to their respective orders and the order-level topology matching that of the mammal supertree6, as per this Newick tree file: (MONOTREMATA,((DIDELPHIMORPHIA,(DIPROTODONTIA,PERAMELEMORPHIA)),(PROBOSCIDEA,((PILOSA,CINGULATA),((((RODENTIA,LAGOMORPHA),(PRIMATES,SCANDENTIA)),((((CETARTIODACTYLA,PERISSODACTYLA),CARNIVORA),CHIROPTERA),EULIPOTYPHLA))))))). This generated a higher resolution species-level mammal tree using cytb data, with more reliable positioning of the higher-level taxonomic relationships than was obtained in exploratory phylogenetic analyses using cytb data alone.

Our use of GAMs, an incorporation of smooth spline predictor functions into the generalized linear model (GLM) framework, allowed us to examine the functional form of our predictor variables (e.g. Fig 2 and 4). Categorical and binary variables (e.g. host order, IUCN status of hunted or not, and certain viral traits) were fit as random effects of each variable level. We used automated term selection by double penalty smoothing53 to eliminate variables from the models. This method removes variables with little to no predictive power and has been shown to be comparable or superior to comparing alternate models with and without variables. We did use the model comparison method in for the case of domestic animals, where the sample size was not sufficient for fitting all variables. In this case dropping variables by double penalty smoothing still allowed pruning the model list to eliminate redundant models. Where there were competing variables measuring the same mechanistic effect, we fit alternate GAMs using only one of each of these variables (as specified in below and in the Extended Data Figure 1). These included phylogenetic variables, citation counts from alternate databases, and different measures of human population/host overlap. For example, to capture host phylogeny we used phylogenetic distance based on either the mammal supertree20 or a purpose-built CytB constrained by the topology of the mammal supertree, but never both in the same model. For human population variables, we looked at either variables measuring overlap of species range with human-occupied areas, or human population in those areas, as area- and population-based measures were highly co-linear. For citation variables, we looked at either all citations or the number of disease-related citations for each host species, not both, and similarly citations in either PubMed or Web of Knowledge. We used a binomial GAM to analyze the 586 mammalian viruses in our database and identify viral traits that may serve as predictors of zoonotic potential. Collinearity was not a major issue among variables included in the same model.",

In order to meaningfully organize species in our dataset by geographic areas, we used the 34 zoogeographic regions for terrestrial mammals recently redefined by Holt et al.55. Using QGIS56, a mammal-specific zoogeographical shapefile provided by Holt\u2019s group at the University of Copenhagen (http://macroecology.ku.dk/resources/wallace) was intersected (using QGIS Vector > Geoprocessing Tools > Intersect) with a shapefile of IUCN\u2019s host ranges for all mammals in our database. Areas of these intersections were then calculated using an equal-area projection (Mollweide), and each host was assigned to only the region that contained the greatest proportion of its range. We systematically removed all observations (species) from each given zoogeographical region, re-fit the model using all observations from outside the region, then performed a non-parametric permutation test comparing the predicted values to the observed values for that region. Non-significant results indicate that model predictions are unbiased. Significant results for a given zoogeographic region suggest that there are location-specific biases that remain unexplained. This systematic zoogeographic cross-validation supported the overall robustness of our model predictions for several models, i.e. all-data zoonoses, all-data total viral richness, and stringent-data total viral richness models. For these models, even though a majority of zoogeographic regions were unbiased, we still identified several zoogeographic regions that showed significant bias. Our zoogeographic cross-validation was equivocal for the stringent-data zoonoses model, with 8 regions that showed evidence of bias and 7 regions which showed no evidence of bias (Supplementary Table 3).",

For three of our best-fit GAMs (all-data total viruses, stringent-data total viruses, and stringent-data zoonoses) the addition of zoogeographical region as a categorical random effect decreased the model AIC and increased the total deviance explained by 3\u20135%. The all-data zoonoses model, which was used to create the series of maps in the main manuscript, does not improve with the inclusion of zoogeographical region. However, the improved predictive power of models using region-specific terms is offset by the increase in degrees of freedom (i.e. if we included 31 zoogeographic regions as separate terms) and, more importantly, a decreased interpretability of our models \u2013 especially when compared to the geographical variables we used, such as host area or species range overlap with human modified habitat. We opted not to include these random effects in our final GAMs in favor of keeping only variables interpretable in the context of our host trait-specific framework. Instead, we indicate areas of geographic bias directly on our spatially mapped outputs.

To estimate the area of host geographic range covered by crops, pastures, rural and urban areas \u2013 as measures of global human contact with a given wildlife species \u2013 each species polygon was intersected (overlapped) with spatial data representing those land cover types. Additionally, we calculated the total number of people within each host geographic range using data from HYDE database57, and also separately totaled the number of people in rural and urban populations. We obtained data on the distribution of cropland, pastures, rural and urban areas (i.e., grazing land) also from the HYDE database57 for the years 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000 and 2005 with a spatial resolution of 5' \u00d7 5', equivalent to 10km2 by 10km2. These datasets were created by combining information from satellite imagery and sub-national crop and pasture statistics57. In our GAMs, we used several transformations of these variables as competing proxies for human-wildlife contact: the log-transformed area of host range that overlapped each type of human-modified land cover, log-transformed human population in the host range, log-transformed human population density in the host range, and the log-ratio of urban and rural human populations in the host range. For each of these, we also included as a variable the change in value from 1970 to 2005. Human-wildlife contact variables that significantly covaried were excluded (set as competing terms) during the model selection process. The ratio of urban to rural human population was used to disentangle variables of human-wildlife contact that significantly covaried. For example, the total area of a species range that overlapped with urban and rural areas was highly correlated with the total geographic area variables we examined (e.g. total area, and area in crop, pasture, rural, and urban). The ratio of urban to rural population allowed us to separate these signals and best represent this proxy of per species human-wildlife contact. All spatial analyses were performed in R (3.3.2)52, using the following R libraries: raster58, rgdal59, and sp59.",

In order to visualize the geographic biases of our non-spatial model predictions in our maps (see above regarding zoogeographic cross-validation), we demarcate regions with significant bias with hatching. Hatched regions represent areas where model predictions of total or zoonotic viral richness deviate systematically for the collection of species in that grid cell. For each grid cell we calculated whether the bias exceeded that expected from a random sampling of hosts. This was accomplished by summing the residuals from 100,000 random draws of species in our dataset that was equal to the number of species present in that grid cell, then identifying grid cells where the observed bias was outside the middle 95% of the randomly drawn distribution. We calculated this for all mammals, and separately for each order across all grid cells.
