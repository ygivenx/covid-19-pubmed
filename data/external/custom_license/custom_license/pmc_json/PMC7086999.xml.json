Compared to conventional vaccines such as killed vaccine and attenuated vaccine, virus-like particles (VLPs) have been demonstrated to be a promising alternative candidate [33, 38, 39],. As a new form of vaccine candidate, the non-infectious nature of VLPs and their lack of viral genomic material are attractive safety features that may be suitable for a variety of viruses [9, 11, 16, 19, 33, 41]. Both B cell-mediated antibody and specific T-cell-mediated cellular responses were elicited by VLPs. VLPs not only mimic the overall structure of the virion, but they also present conformational epitopes of surface proteins, which can be readily recognized and processed by antigen-presenting cells [2, 12, 14, 15, 25]. The protective effects of VLPs have been demonstrated in clinical and preclinical trials [3, 14, 15, 28, 32]. An important advance would be the development of new VLPs with an enhanced breadth of immunity, which could potentially be used to prevent infection by PRRSV and SIV.",

Based on this platform, we hope to generate chimeric VLPs for protection against both PRRS and influenza. In this study, we chose the H3N2 influenza virus as the basis for VLP production. As expected, the fusion protein NA/GP5 in combination with HA and M1 effectively formed chimeric VLPs. Next, we demonstrated that the chimeric VLPs induced a potent immune response to both PRRSV and H3N2 SIV in a BALB/c mice model. Hence, the results suggested that the chimeric VLP vaccine is a new vaccine candidate for protection against both PRRS and H3N2 influenza.",

A previous study indicated that SIV and PRRSV are the primary etiological agents associated with respiratory disease in pigs [7]. The presence of PRRSV between vaccinations reduced the efficacy of the vaccine, but it did not negatively impact either the systemic or local antibody response to either SIV vaccination or challenge [29]. Previously, we prepared chimeric VLPs composed of the M1 protein from H1N1 influenza virus and a fusion protein, denoted as NA/GP5, containing the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of the H1N1 virus NA protein and the PRRSV GP5 protein. We demonstrated that immunization of BALB/c mice with these chimeric VLPs could stimulate a robust immune response [38, 39].

            "text": "The influenza virus virion is surrounded by a lipid membrane containing two major glycoproteins, HA and NA. The HA protein is the most abundant glycoprotein and is responsible for the attachment of the virus to terminal sialic acid residues on host cell receptors and mediating fusion between viral and cellular membranes [10]. Influenza VLPs could be obtained by the expression of four viral proteins (HA, NA, M1, M2) [17], three viral proteins (HA, M1, NA) [4, 8, 28, 32, 35], two viral proteins (HA, M1) [30, 33, 34], or even HA alone [6]. Recently, it has been demonstrated that influenza VLPs can be made from M2 fusion proteins [40]. Therefore, influenza VLPs were chosen as a platform on which PRRSV proteins (GP5) can be expressed. A previous report showed that, based on the assembly of Newcastle disease (ND) VLPs [22], it was possible to develop chimeric VLPs containing respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) G proteins using ND VLPs as a platform [23], as well as ND VLPs containing RSV G and F proteins [21]. In our study, we showed that the HA protein could assemble with NA/GP5 and M1 to form chimeric VLPs. Compared to our previous results, HA had no influence on the formation of chimeric VLPs, but the size and morphology of the chimeric VLPs were more similar to those of the natural influenza virus. The HA titer of the chimeric VLPs indicated that HA was structurally and functionally incorporated into the particles. The results suggested that it might be feasible to generate chimeric influenza VLPs in this way.",

Our data showed that both the inactivated virus and the chimeric VLP vaccine generated comparable amounts of PRRSV-specific or H3N2-influenza-virus-specific antibodies, as measured by ELISA. Splenocytes proliferated vigorously and produced both IFN-\u03b3and IL-4 in response to stimulation with GP5 or HA antigen. Following three immunizations, the VLP vaccine induced HI antibodies against the homologous influenza strain in mice. Our findings provide evidence that chimeric VLPs can induce protective immunity against H3N2 influenza virus similarly to the killed virus. Meanwhile, when we measured the neutralizing antibody titers, significantly elevated neutralizing antibodies to PRRSV were achieved in the VLP group as well as with inactivated PRRSV (P < 0.05). This result demonstrated that the PRRSV GP5 protein co-incorporated with influenza H3N2 NA and formed chimeric VLPs with HA and M1, which could be identified and transferred efficiently as a PRRSV antigen. It was reported recently that VLPs of the hepatitis B virus core protein containing five mimotopes of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) protected chickens against IBDV [38, 39]. The use of both genetically engineered norovirus VLPs incorporating relevant epitopes from multiple strains and multivalent vaccine formulations increases the breadth of the immune response to diverse variants within a genotype [26]. In summary, we found that the chimeric VLPs induced antibodies against two diseases at the same time, in contrast to the chimeric VLPs in our previous study.",

Similar to our research, chimeric SARS-CoV S glycoprotein and influenza M1 efficiently form VLPs that protect mice against challenge with SARS-CoV [20]. Experimental triple-HA VLPs containing HA proteins derived from the H5N1, H7N2, and H2N3 viruses were immunogenic and protected ferrets from challenge with all three potentially pandemic viruses. Additionally, VLPs containing HA subtypes derived from the seasonal H1N1, H3N2, and type B influenza viruses protected ferrets from three seasonal influenza viruses [31]. Therefore, it is clear that the chimeric VLPs were as effective as the killed viruses. The results showed that the immune responses to these chimeric VLPs were similar to those to the VLPs composed of NA/GP5 and M1 proteins. The less an animal needs to be handled to deliver vaccines, the better. The presence of multiple virus targets in a single vaccine will be a new advantage of the chimeric VLP vaccine. Such vaccines could also reduce the burden of vaccine production and administration in comparison with regular vaccination. After this basic step, studies of the protective efficacy of chimeric VLPs in a swine model need to be carried out.",

These chimeric VLPs could serve as a promising vaccination strategy to control PRRS and H3N2 influenza in swine. Although the response to immunization with the chimeric VLPs was not more effective than the response to inactivated viruses, the fact that chimeric VLPs are not infectious and lack viral genomic material means that they could provide a safer method to prevent viral infection. Furthermore, the production of the chimeric VLPs is faster and presents a lower risk relative to the traditional method. Thus, this approach has greater potential for vaccine development.",
