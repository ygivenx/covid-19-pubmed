When the 2009 H1N1 swine flu virus emerged, the importance of data sharing was evident in the rapid response to the pandemic. However, the first isolate of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus from Saudi Arabia was controversially submitted for patenting in 2013 (see go.nature.com/1uu7ldd). And in last year's Ebola virus epidemic, there were significant gaps in the availability and posting of online sequence data (10.1038/518477a).",
