To date, there have been limited or no published studies investigating the prevalence of viruses circulating in T&T\u2019s swine populations. In late 2015, according to the World Animal Health Information System (WAHIS) database, Columbia reported to have experienced classical swine fever (CSF) limited to one or more zones and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) was reported to be present in Columbia and Suriname. Viruses such as classical swine fever virus (CSFV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), and swine influenza virus (SwIV) have been reported to be circulating in Venezuelan swine herds (Kwiecien 2013). The close proximity (7 km) of Trinidad to Venezuela, and the known illegal trade of animals and animal products between the two countries, renders Trinidad a high-risk location for the introduction of these viruses.",

Understanding the background levels of these viruses in swine populations in T&T will enable the development of science-based risk assessments, thus aiding the successful prevention, management, and control of future viral outbreaks within T&T and the Caribbean region.

The sample size (n = 309) was estimated by using an anticipated true herd-level prevalence of 10%, tolerance of 7.5%, a 90% confidence level, and herd-level specificity and sensitivity of 70 and 90% respectively (Cannon and Roe 1982). The amount of pigs sampled in this study was constrained by issues of free access to farms. Many farmers were reluctant to allow their pigs to be sampled due to the invasive nature of the blood sampling procedure and the resulting high levels of stress caused to the animals. The more common approach to determining sample size in this type of study uses the formula developed by Cannon and Roe (1982) where P is the anticipated population proportion which is assumed at 70% and Z is 1.96 which is the approximate value of the 97.5 percentile point of a normal distribution curve used to construct approximate 95% confidence intervals. This value is found using a Z\n\u03b1/2 table where the confidence level used is 95% and \u03b1 is 0.05. Using the Canon and Roe formula, the sample size n was calculated to be 322 samples; however, to reduce the number of pigs to be sampled further, the confidence can be relaxed (decreased) and the tolerance, increased (Humphry et al. 2004) allowing for a sample size of 309.",

            "text": "SwIV can cause severe respiratory signs in pigs, with morbidity rates sometimes reaching 100%. The primary economic impact is related to retarded weight gain resulting in an increase in the number of days to reach market weight (Organization for Animal Health 2009). In the UK, the financial loss resulting from reduced weight gain in finishing pigs alone due to SwIV has been estimated at approximately \u00a37 per pig (Morilla et al. 2008). In this study, antibodies against SwIV were found in 114 out of 309 (37%) serum samples taken from pigs. In a study carried out on swine in the USA, 27.7% of the sampled pigs were found to be seropositive for SwIV in 2000 (Olsen et al. 2000) and, according to a World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) Technical Disease Card on Swine Influenza (Organization for Animal Health 2009), approximately 25\u201333% of finishers and 45% of breeding pigs have antibodies to influenza A viruses in the USA. Other studies carried out in the region revealed a herd seroprevalence of 36.3 and 34.6% in Guatemalan pigs in 2010 and 2011 respectively (Gonzalez and Ana 2015). In Mexico (Lopez-Robles et al. 2014), 38% of pigs tested positive for SwIV antibodies in 2014 and 41.3% of Brazilian pigs were found to be positive for SwIV antibodies in a study carried out in 2012 (Rajao et al. 2013). The 37% seroprevalence found in pigs of T&T is therefore consistent with similar studies carried out in Central and North American countries and suggests that SwIV is endemic in the Trinidadian domestic swine population, but not Tobago.",

Interestingly, it is well known that many of the pig populations of Trinidad originated from Minnesota farms indicating a potential introduction pathway. High titers of this strain were observed in the samples tested which would be indicative of quite recent exposure/active circulation of such viruses. One of the samples showed quite a high titer against the A/Perth/16/09 H3N2 strain which is a contemporary human virus that does not have a stable lineage in pigs. As expected, reactivity to the European viruses was low as there is very little transfer of swine between Europe and Trinidad. The pandemic pH1N1 2009 strain showed strong reactivity in all of the samples tested which indicates probable circulation of virus or recent exposure.",

This close proximity of people and pigs could enhance both zoonotic and reverse zoonotic transmission of influenza viruses from humans to pigs, thus maintaining influenza virus circulation in the swine herds (Australian Pork Industry Biosecurity Programme, APIBP 2003). These factors are akin to those which defined traditional influenza epicenters in Southeast Asia (Ma et al. 2009). Personal hygiene, the granting of sick leave to pig handlers showing flu-like symptoms, as well as biosecurity, should therefore be encouraged on both small- and large-scale farms. Such measures should include risk assessment checks for visitors, the use of protective clothing, respiratory protection for people to reduce viral dissemination (zoonotic and reverse zoonotic), handwashing before and after handling animals, restriction on sharing of equipment and tools between farms, and controls relating to the movement of animals and vehicles in and out of the farm. Training of workers on pig farms to recognize influenza-like symptoms in humans and pigs should also be carried out (Adeola et al. 2015).",

            "text": "Porcine parvovirus (PPV) causes severe economically devastating reproductive symptoms in breeding sows. It is known to cause abortion and is associated with stillbirths, mummifications, embryonic death, and infertility (SMEDI). PPV infection is one of the most common and important causes of infectious infertility in swine. PPV is ubiquitous and worldwide in its distribution; it is therefore an infection which needs to be carefully managed (Porcine Parvovirus, The Pig Site 2014). This study identified 87 out of the 309 serum samples (28%) as antibody positive for PPV. Interestingly, markedly different levels of seroprevalence for antibodies to PPV were observed across the different swine farms in T&T with seroprevalence levels on farms ranging from 12 to 92% (Fig. 2b). Antibodies were not observed in any of the pigs sampled on two of the largest farms in Trinidad, suggesting that the biosecurity and husbandry measures practiced on these two farms may be effective at stopping this introduction of PPV onto the farms. Interestingly, despite the relatively high seroprevalence for PPV observed in Trinidadian domestic pigs, there are limited reports of reproductive problems in the pigs. This could be due to farmers simply not reporting reproductive issues on their farms when they occur or alternatively could be due to a state on endemic stability on the affected farms, meaning that all the breeding sows are being infected with PPV prior to their first pregnancy. On the farms that contained serologically positive pigs, it was found that all the breeding sows that were sampled on these farms had antibodies to the virus prior to their first pregnancy, which would explain the lack of PPV-related reproductive clinical signs reported to the veterinary services. It is, however, very important to note that some pig farms in Trinidad, and all the pigs sampled on Tobago, tested negative for PPV antibodies. These PPV-negative farms should be particularly careful when bringing pigs into their farms, ensuring that they avoid the introduction of PPV-positive animals. These farmers should ensure that they test all pigs for PPV antibodies and antigen prior to introduction, or alternatively, they should vaccinate their breeding sows prior to their first pregnancy. All pig farmers from PPV-negative farms should be advised of the importance of maintaining high levels of biosecurity in order to keep their farms free of PPV.",

These Tobago pig farmers usually breed and rear their pigs on their farms and may occasionally buy replacement sows from neighboring farms in Tobago to reduce excessive inbreeding. Pig farmers from Tobago should therefore be advised to avoid importing pigs from Trinidad and should maintain their current husbandry practices in order to ensure that their pigs remain seronegative for SwIV and PPV. Any pigs, including boars, coming into the country should be quarantined and tested for the presence of these viruses. Farmers from Tobago should be educated on the serological situation of their pigs and be made aware of the risks they face in the event of their na\u00efve pigs becoming exposed to these viruses.

High seroprevalences (82.4%) of pigs for PCV-2 antibodies have been reported in Canada (Liu et al. 2002), the USA (80%) (Nawagitgul et al. 2002), Taiwan (83.5%) (Wang et al. 2004), Northern Ireland (>55%) (Walker et al. 2000), and Columbia (83.6%) (Monroy et al. 2014). In the present study, the overall seroprevalence for PCV-2 antibodies in T&T pigs was found to be 66%. There is, however, little to no evidence for PCV-2-associated diseases in T&T pigs. Given the high seroprevalence for PCV-2 observed in the T&T pigs, there is clearly a need to closely monitor pig herds for evidence of PCV-2-associated diseases. Routine surveillance for clinical signs and the regular examination of specimens from abattoirs should be adopted. Farmers should also be encouraged to adopt sound husbandry practices such as age segregation, good sanitation as well as measures to minimize stress and avoid overcrowding. The application of these measures is essential to avoid the development of diseases in pigs that are associated with PCV-2 infection such as post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS).",

Reduced feed conversion efficiency led to lower average daily growth, additional feed requirements, and longer time needed to reach the 100 kg body weight (Er et al. 2014). Pigs vaccinated for PCV2 have been shown to deliver a sizable return on investment of up to approximately US$20 per pig over unvaccinated pigs (Gillespie et al. 2009). Also, in the case of PPV, it has been suggested that the cost of an epidemic could result in losses of up to US$50 per sow (Cutler and Gardner 1988). Losses of between US$20 and $50 per pig would be devastating to the pig industry in T&T and could result in the closure of affected farms.",

Although antibodies to CSF, PRRS, TGE, and PRCV were not observed in pigs from T&T, it is important to continue monitoring for these viruses, as outbreaks of PRRS and CSF have recently been reported in South American countries neighboring Trinidad, including Venezuela, Ecuador, Suriname, and Columbia (World Animal Health Information System, WAHIS Interface 2015). It is well known that domestic species, including pigs, are illegally imported into Trinidad from the South American mainland, especially Venezuela. Although the porcine coronaviruses (TGE and PRCV) have not previously been reported to be present in Trinidad, the presence of these viruses has been suspected for many years, possibly due to previous importation of pigs and pig semen from the USA and Canada. This study has revealed that these viruses are not present in domestic pigs in T&T.",
