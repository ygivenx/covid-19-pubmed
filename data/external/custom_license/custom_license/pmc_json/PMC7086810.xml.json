            "text": "Rabies is a fatal zoonotic disease caused by virus belonging to the genus Lyssavirus, family Rhabdoviridae, order Mononegavirales. In addition to its victims among domestic and wild animals, the disease is responsible for 50,000-55,000 human deaths per year in Asia and Africa [1]. Rabies virus (RV), after infection inside the body, enters to the central nervous system, leading to acute encephalomyelitis. Once the clinical symptoms specific to disease are initiated, the chances for survival are very poor. Pre- and post-exposure vaccinations are the most efficient and highly recommended methods for the prevention of disease in human as well as in animals [1, 2]. Sometimes, due to unnoticed exposure or vaccination failure, disease is diagnosed after the onset of clinical symptoms, and death becomes unavoidable due to the unavailability of any effective line of treatment. Considering the fatal nature of clinical rabies, efforts are being made to develop a post-exposure treatment strategy that could inhibit the multiplication of virus inside the cell and the spread of infection to uninfected nervous cells without damaging them. A recently discovered endogenous mechanism called \u2018RNA interference (RNAi)\u2019 has been used in the past decade to inhibit virus multiplication through potent and efficient sequence-specific gene targeting.",

            "text": "First described in 1998, RNAi mediates post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) in a sequence-dependent manner through short (~21-23 nucleotides long) RNA molecules called small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). siRNA, along with the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) forms an activated complex that specifically recognises and binds to complementary mRNA. The mRNA is then cleaved into smaller fragments, inactivating its expression [3]. This mechanism of gene silencing is highly conserved in plants, fungi, worms, insects and mammals [see refs. 4\u20136 for review]. Along with inhibition of gene expression, the endogenous cellular mechanism of RNAi performs multiple biological functions such as mediating the cellular response to viral infections, controlling the mobility of transposable genetic elements, and regulation of gene expression during animal development [see ref. 7 for review]. RNAi-based gene silencing of target genes has generated ample opportunities for therapeutic applications against various diseases and disorders. In the process of development of antiviral therapeutics, sequence-specific knockdown of viral genes that are indispensable for replication and pathogenesis has generated special interest. RNAi-based antiviral strategies have been developed for many RNA and DNA viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus, poliovirus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, human papilloma virus, dengue virus, hepatitis delta virus, murine gamma herpesviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, and respiratory syncytial virus [see ref. 8 for review].",

Silencing of other RV genes, such as the phosphoprotein (P) [11] and polymerase (L) genes [12], has also resulted in some degree of anti-rabies effect. These results suggest that targeting single RV gene might not be sufficient to achieve absolute inhibition of RV multiplication. Another RV gene, the glycoprotein (G) gene, which has a crucial role in pathogenesis by controlling the rate of virus uptake into cells, trans-synaptic virus spread and virus replication during infection [16\u201319], could be a target for RNAi against rabies. To our knowledge, there is no published report on evaluation of siRNAs targeting the RV-G gene till now. However, siRNA targeting the G genes of other viruses of the family Rhabdoviridae has been evaluated for inhibition of virus multiplication [20, 21].",

Among the five RV proteins, the N, P and L proteins are important targets for RNAi due to their role in both viral transcription and replication. Previous in vitro studies have indicated that short RV-N cDNA, artificial microRNAs and synthetic siRNA targeting RV-N could interfere with RV replication [10, 11, 15]. Other targets for RV RNAi were non-structural genes such as P [11] and L [13] with limited antiviral potential. Our group has also evaluated siRNAs targeting RV-L and N genes delivered using an adenoviral vector for their anti-rabies-virus potential in vitro in BHK-21 cells and in vivo in mice and showed that they provided a moderate level of protection against lethal RV-CVS-11 challenge [12]. RV-G also remained a potential target for RNAi, as it is essential for trans-synaptic spread of RV between neurons in vivo [16, 17]. In the present study, siRNAs targeting RV-G were designed and evaluated, either alone or in combination with siRNA targeting RV-N, for inhibition of RV multiplication.",

While selecting siRNAs, a conserved region of the RV-G gene with no potential for secondary structure formation was considered using siRNA design algorithms. Since screening of siRNAs against RV is tedious and time-consuming and requires intense safety conditions, a simple method for screening siRNAs based on plasmid co-transfection was used. The siRNAs (siG-1 to 9) targeting RV-G and si-N targeting RV-N genes were synthesized in an shRNA form and cloned into an siRNA expression vector under the control of a U6 promoter. To facilitate screening of effective siRNAs, we constructed the target reporter plasmids pDsRed-G and pDsRed-N, in which full-length RV-G and N coding regions containing siRNAs target sequences were fused in-frame with the RFP gene to express the fusion proteins RV-G-RFP and RV-N-RFP. The siRNAs that executed cleavage of the viral mRNA led to reduced expression of the RFP reporter gene. This provided a simple and impartial model for assessing the efficacy of gene silencing by analysis of fusion protein expression by fluorescence microscopy. In three independent experiments, the siRNAs (si-G7 and si-N) consistently inhibited expression of the RFP fusion versions of the RV-G and N protein, indicating that they are potent siRNAs that should be studied further. This approach of screening effective siRNAs targeting different viral genes has been reported previously [12, 20, 25\u201328].",

In this study, quantification of RV-G-RFP fusion transcripts using real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to analyze the effect of different siRNAs on RV-G mRNA expression. The highest (64.5 %) level of reduction in silencing of RV-G mRNA in si-G7-treated cells was seen compared with control (si-C-treated) cells. To confirm the antiviral potential of RV-G-specific siRNAs, we monitored the presence of virus in infected cells and viral progeny in siRNA-treated and RV-infected cell culture supernatant. The reduction in the number of fluorescent foci was correlated with a decrease in the infectious RV titer in siRNAs-treated BHK-21 cells. The decrease in the release of infectious RV from si-G7-treated cells was greater (86.8 %) than in the other siRNA-treated cells. Similarly, treatment with si-N, targeting RV-N, also resulted in a reduction (85.9 %) in release of infectious RV compared to control. This indicated that both siRNAs, namely, si-G7 and si-N, could inhibit RV multiplication in BHK-21 cells. The reduced infectivity titer of RV due to RV-G silencing could be due to the production of RV without RV-G, which might have restricted its spread from one infected cell to another. A requirement for RV-G in cell-to-cell transfer of virus has been reported [16, 29\u201331]. Similarly, a reduction in RV titer with a silencing effect on RV-N could occur in two ways: as a major viral structural protein and as a regulatory protein to switch from viral gene expression to genome replication. The intracellular ratio of leader RNA to N protein regulates the switch from viral gene transcription to viral genome replication [32].",

The functionality of siRNAs to knock down the expression of RV-G and N genes was analysed using a plasmid co-transfection approach, which indicated that a dual-siRNA-expressing plasmid could reduce the expression of both the target genes. Furthermore, a dual gene silencing construct also inhibited the multiplication of RV in infected BHK-21 cells as analysed by in vitro challenge of siRNAs-treated cells with RV-PV-11. The reduction in RV titer in the infected cell culture supernatant was 87.4 %, which was significantly similar to the effect produced by individual siRNAs, indicating no cumulative effect. The approach of using multigene siRNAs or multi-siRNAs/miRNAs targeting a single gene has been reported for many viruses, with a variable degree of inhibition of virus replication [11, 33\u201335].",
