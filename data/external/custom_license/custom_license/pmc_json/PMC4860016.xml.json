Like other class I viral fusion proteins, the two subunits trimerize and fold into a metastable pre-fusion conformation. The S1 subunit is responsible for receptor binding, while the S2 subunit mediates membrane fusion. Coronaviruses typically possess two domains within S1 capable of binding to host receptors: an amino (N)-terminal domain (NTD) and a carboxy (C)-terminal domain (CTD), with the latter recognizing protein receptors for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV6,7. Although these individual domains have been structurally characterized, the organization of the complete spike has not yet been determined, preventing a mechanistic understanding of S protein function.",

The protein construct contains a C-terminal T4 fibritin trimerization motif and a mutated S1/S2 furin-cleavage site (Extended Data Fig. 3). The S1 subunit adopts an extended conformation with short linkers between domains and sub-domains (Fig. 1b). The S1 NTD (amino acids 14\u2013297) has strong structural and sequence homology to the bovine coronavirus (BCoV) S1 NTD (Extended Data Fig. 4), which recognizes acetylated sialic acids on glycosylated cell-surface receptors8. The glycan-binding site in the BCoV S1 NTD is conserved in the HKU1 S1 NTD and is located at the apex of the trimer, oriented towards target cells. Indeed, HKU1 S1 was recently shown to bind O-acetylated sialic acids on host cells, and these glycans were required for efficient infection of primary human airway epithelial cultures9.",

The CTD is located at the trimer apex close to the threefold axis, and the core interacts with the other two S1 CTD cores and with one NTD from an adjacent protomer. The domain swapping between protomers results in a woven appearance when viewed looking down towards the viral membrane (Fig. 2a). Structural alignment of the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV CTD\u2013receptor complexes11,12 with the HKU1 pre-fusion S protein reveals that the protein-receptor-binding surface of the S1 CTD is buried in the HKU1 S protein trimer and is therefore incapable of making equivalent interactions without some initial breathing and transient exposure of these domains (Fig. 2b). Although a protein receptor has not yet been identified for HKU1, antibodies against the CTD, but not those against the NTD, blocked HKU1 infection of cells13. These data suggest that the S1 CTD is the primary HKU1 receptor-binding site13, whereas the NTD mediates initial attachment via glycan binding.",

Refolding of HR1 into a long \u03b1-helix thrusts the fusion peptide into the host-cell membrane, and as the two heptad repeats interact to form a coiled-coil, the host and viral membranes are brought together. The fusion peptide, conserved among coronavirus S proteins17 (Extended Data Fig. 6), is located on the exterior of the HKU1 S protein and is adjacent to the putative S2\u2032 cleavage site, which remains uncleaved in our structure. The fusion peptide forms a short helix and a loop, with most of the hydrophobic amino acids buried in an interface with other elements of S2. Unlike influenza HA where the C terminus of the fusion peptide is only 14 amino acids away from the N terminus of HR1, the fusion peptide of HKU1 S is 60 amino acids away from HR1. This span of protein contains four short \u03b1-helices and several longer regions lacking regular secondary structure. This intervening sequence is also buried beneath SD-2 and the S2\u2032 cleavage site, suggesting that cleavage may affect the proclivity of S2 for undergoing the transition to the post-fusion conformation.",

            "text": "Coronavirus S protein heptad repeats are unusually large with HR1 encompassing more than 90 amino acids20. In the cryo-EM structure, HR2 is located at the base of the HKU1 S protein near the viral membrane, but is poorly ordered, precluding unambiguous assignment of the residues. However, HR1 is well ordered and arranged along the length of the S2 subunit, forming four short helices and part of the central three-helix bundle. This arrangement of HR1 is similar to that of influenza HA, although in HA the HR1 is organized as two helices connected by a long loop14. Conversion of influenza HA to the post-fusion conformation requires these protein elements to transition into a single long \u03b1-helix21. The post-fusion six-helix bundle structures of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV S2 heptad repeats22,23 reveal that coronavirus S proteins also undergo a similar transition (Fig. 3c). However, the S protein must carry out five such loop-to-helix transitions, highlighting the complexity of S proteins relative to other class I fusion proteins. In addition, the membrane distal regions of the pre-fusion S2 central three-helix bundle (S2 amino acids 1070\u20131076), which is the C-terminal portion of HR1, are splayed outwards from the threefold axis (Extended Data Fig. 7). In the available coronavirus post-fusion HR1\u2013HR2 structures, this portion of HR1 forms a tight three-helix bundle22,23. Formation of this three-helix bundle may be prevented by interactions between the C-terminal end of the S2 HR1 and the S1 CTD, and thus disruption of these interactions through receptor-induced conformational changes would provide an additional means by which receptor binding in S1 can initiate S2-mediated membrane fusion. Indeed, protease cleavage and an acidic pH are thought to be insufficient to trigger the transition to the post-fusion conformation without additional destabilization provided by receptor binding24,25,26.",

Since betacoronavirus S proteins are similar in size and have a conserved domain organization, our findings should be generally applicable to other betacoronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Extended Data Fig. 6). Our studies provide a structural basis for S protein function wherein the pre-fusion S protein is progressively matured and destabilized by receptor binding and protease cleavage. Following dissociation of the S1 subunits, HR1 would transition to a long \u03b1-helix, and the fusion peptide would be released from the side of the S2 subunit and inserted into host membranes. The structure and mechanistic insights presented here should enable engineering of pre-fusion stabilized coronavirus S proteins as vaccine immunogens against current and emerging betacoronaviruses, similar to recent efforts for other viral fusion proteins29,30.

Three hours after this plasmid was transfected into FreeStyle 293-F cells (Invitrogen), kifunensine was added to a final concentration of 5 \u03bcM. FreeStyle 293-F cells are a high-transfection-efficiency cell line adapted for suspension culture derived from low passage clonal cultures and after purchase were not further authenticated. Cells were not confirmed to be free of mycoplasma, but were only used for protein expression. Cultures were harvested after six days, and protein was purified from the medium using Ni-NTA Superflow resin (Qiagen). The buffer was then exchanged using a HiPrep 26/10 desalting column (GE Healthcare Biosciences) from a high-imidazole elution buffer to a low pH buffer (20 mM Bis-Tris pH 6.5, 150 mM NaCl). Afterward, endoglycosidase H (EndoH) (10% w/w) and HRV3C protease (1% w/w) were added to the protein and the reaction was incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The digested protein was further purified using a Superose 6 16/70 column (GE Healthcare Biosciences).",

After 2D classification, unbinned selected particles were symmetrically refined in RELION version 1.3 (refs 41, 42) against the initial 3D reconstruction filtered to 60 \u00c5 resolution. This refinement was followed by particle polishing and refinement of the resulting realigned, B-factor-weighted and signal-integrated particles using RELION version 1.4b1. The resolution of the final map was 4.04 \u00c5 at an FSC cutoff of 0.143. A mask was generated in RELION using a threshold that accounted for the entire structure. From this threshold, the mask was further dilated by 3 voxels and a Gaussian fall-off was generated over an additional 6 voxels. The mask effect on FSC was taken into consideration. Phases were randomized in the unfiltered half-set maps for initial FSC lower than 0.8 and a new FSC between these phase-randomized maps was generated and used to correct for mask effects in the final FSC-based resolution estimate. The reported resolution of 4.04 \u00c5 is the RELION CorrelationCorrected value",
