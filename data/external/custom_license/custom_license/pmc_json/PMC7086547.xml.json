However, EV71 infection causes very diverse symptoms, ranging from none (about 71%) to fatality (about 0.05%) (17,18). It remains unknown why different hosts of the same EV71 infection have such a range of clinical outcomes (17,18). Perhaps this range is related to virulence or load of the virus, or particular host factors. To date no relationship has been found between EV71 genotypes and clinical outcome (19,20), and EV71 virulence factors have not been clarified. It is possible that host factors, especially host immune response, may be of ultimate importance to clinical outcome.",

EV71 IgM was measured at the onset of disease and EV71 neutralization antibody was evaluated at the same time with the measurement of cellular immunity. The laboratory method for measuring EV71 neutralizing antibody followed the standard protocol of neutralization test in microtiter plates (21). Serum samples were inactivated at 56\u00b0C for 30 min and then serially diluted from 2- to 1,024-fold. We mixed and incubated (37\u00b0C, 2 h) 50 \u03bcL of each diluted serum with 50 \u03bcL containing one hundred 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) of EV71 strain TW/2272/98 (GenBank accession number AF119795) in microtiter plates (19) Two replicate wells were used per serum dilution. Then microtiter plates were seeded with 100 \u03bcL of rhabdomyosarcoma cells (8 \u00d7 104 cells per mL) and incubated (37\u00b0C 5% CO2 atmosphere, 2\u20137 d). Each test was run with cell control, serum control and virus back titration with 100\u20130.1 TCID50. Cytopathic effect was observed under an inverted microscope after incubation, and serotiter was determined when Cytopathic effect was observed in 1 TCID50 of the virus back titration. Microtiter plates were fixed with 5% glutaraldehyde and stained with 0.1% crystal violet. Seropositivity was defined as serotiter \u2265 8. For EV71 IgM detection, EV71 isolate TW/2086/98 was amplified and purified as an antigen for use in \u03bc-capture ELISA, whose sensitivity and specificity was 91.5% and 93.1%, respectively (22).",

Higher incidence of most severe EV71 diseases were found in children under 3 y of age (15,16), and this might be explained by their weaker cellular immunity. We hypothesize that lower cellular immunity may delay viral killing or clearance, thus resulting in viral dissemination, sustained systemic inflammatory response and subsequent pulmonary edema. Host genetic factors may also play an important role and will require further investigation. Yang KD et al. reported that patients with EV 71 meningoencephalitis had a higher frequency of G/G genotype with a polymorphism of the cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 at position 49 of exon 1 than did control subjects without meningoencephalitis. In these cases there was no difference in specific EV 71 neutralizing antibody titers in the 2 groups (23). In our study, humoral immunity did not affect the clinical outcome of EV71 infection, either. Results from the two studies suggest that younger children with genetics involving decreased cellular rather than humoral response may be linked to severe EV 71 infection.",

However, we had a seroepidemiology study, done in 1999 (18), which showed that 94% (177/189) of 3- to 6-month-old children and 92% (265/287) of 7- to 12-month-old children did not have EV71 neutralizing antibody. The 8% of 7- to 12-month-old children might get their antibody through natural EV71 infection rather than maternal antibody.

In the case of poliomyelitis, IFN-\u03b3 treatment of age-dependent poliomyelitis-susceptible mice protected them from paralytic disease (27). Recent studies have also shown that interferon-\u03b3 synergizes with IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 to inhibit the replication of both RNA and DNA viruses. Scagnolari et al. investigated the effects of IFNs on the replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), finding that although SARS-CoV is only moderately sensitive to IFN-\u03b2 and weakly sensitive to IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3, in combination they have a strong synergistic effect on virus replication (28). These two studies imply treatments for severe EV71 infection, but further animal or clinical trial is mandatory to prove the efficacy of immunomodulators. In addition, use of an antiviral agent to decrease replication may also be beneficial (29). Animal studies are ongoing on this topic. In the Liu et al. study, an early administration of recombinant mouse interferon-\u03b1 protected the mice against EV71 infection and in vitro analysis of virus-induced death showed that human type I interferons exerted a direct protective effect on EV71, so interferons may play an important role in controlling EV71 infection and replication (30).",

EV71 cases with pulmonary edema had significantly lower interferon-\u03b3 response than the other EV71 cases (p = 0.04, measured to compare the percentages of a response over the median level of increase of all the EV71 cases by using likelihood ratio \u03c72 test).",
