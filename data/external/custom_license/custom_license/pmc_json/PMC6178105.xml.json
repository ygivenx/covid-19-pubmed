            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are found in a wide variety of animals. They belong to the subfamily Coronavirinae in the family Coronaviridae within the order Nidovirales (Zhang 2016). Porcine CoVs are significant enteric and respiratory pathogens of swine. Five porcine CoVs have so far been identified: transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) (Doyle and Hutchings 1946), porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) (Wesley et al. 1990), and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) (Pensaert and De Bouck 1978) in the Alphacoronavirus genus; porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) (Sasseville et al. 2002) in the Betacoronavirus genus; and porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) (Woo et al. 2012) in the Deltacoronavirus genus. PDCoV was first detected in 2012 in Hong Kong during a molecular epidemiology study of CoVs using RT-PCR to examine the pig samples and complete genome sequences of these two PDCoV strains (HKU15-44, HKU15-155) were reported (Woo et al. 2012). PDCoV is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus with a genome of appropriately 25 kb in length (Zhang 2016). The genome organization of PDCoV are in the order of: 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR), open reading frame 1a/1b (ORF1a/1b), spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), nonstructural protein 6 (NS6), nucleocapsid (N), nonstructural protein 7 (NS7), and 3\u2032 UTR (Chen et al. 2015a, b). The clinical symptoms in newborn piglets caused by PDCoV infection are similar to that by other porcine enteric pathogens such as PEDV and TGEV, which includes vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration and death (Zhang 2016). To date, there are no effective treatments or vaccines for PDCoV.",

Apart from these places, PDCoV was also detected in mainland China (Chen et al. 2015a, b; Song et al. 2015; Dong et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2015). These molecular surveillance studies indicated that PDCoV was a common viral pathogen of pigs around the world. Increasing virological and serological methods have been developed to detect PDCoV in clinical samples from pig farms. Virological methods include detection of virus particles by electron microscopy (Ma et al. 2015), detection of viral nucleic acid by RT-PCR and real-time PCR (Marthaler et al. 2014; Hu et al. 2015a, b). And the most commonly used serological assays for PDCoV are indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assay (Dong et al. 2016) and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) targeting PDCoV nucleocapsid (N) protein (Su et al. 2016).",

As expected, the 11\u201314 day-old gnotobiotic pigs inoculated orally with PDCoV strain OH-FD22 and OH-FD100 showed severe vomiting, diarrhea, and atrophic enteritis (Jung et al. 2015). All infected pigs had PEDV-like lesions characterized by thin and transparent intestinal walls and accumulation of large amounts of yellow fluid in the intestinal lumen (Jung et al. 2015). Further, histology analysis exhibited acute diffuse, severe atrophic enteritis and mild vacuolation of superficial epithelial cells in cecum and colon (Jung et al. 2015). The pathogenicity of PDCoV in conventional pigs by subsequent isolation was also confirmed (Chen et al. 2015a, b; Ma et al. 2015; Dong et al. 2016).",

The tissue sections were deparaffinized, and then rinsed and incubated with target retrieval solution (Servicebio, China). After the sections were blocked with 1% BSA (Solarbio, China), they were incubated with PDCoV specific rabbit antisera (Guangdong Wen\u2019s Foodstuffs Group Co., Ltd, China) (1:100) as the primary antibody for 12 h at 4 \u00b0C. They were then incubated with peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (KPL, USA) (1:200) for 50 min at room temperature, and the samples were finally visualized with a 3, 3\u2032-diaminobenzidine (DAB) chromogen kit (Dako, Denmark). Hematoxylin was used for counterstaining. Tissues of piglets from negative control groups were used as negative samples.",

To determine the causative agent of the diarrhea outbreaks in Guangdong province of China, 24 clinical samples were collected from newborn piglets on seven different commercial pig farms with reported diarrhea outbreaks from June to October 2016, and used to detect the presence of porcine viral enteric pathogens (PDCoV, PEDV, TGEV and Rota C). Of 24 intestinal contents examined, 4 (16.7%) were PDCoV positive (Fig. 1A), 11 (45.8%) were PEDV positive (Fig. 1B), and 2 (8.3%) were positive for both PDCoV and PEDV, indicating that PDCoV/PEDV coinfections exist in pig farms. Interestingly, none of these samples were positive for TGEV or PRoV (data not shown), indicating that PDCoV or PEDV is the main cause of diarrhea in piglets in Guangdong, China. These data suggest that PDCoV was present in Guangdong province of China despite a relatively lower prevalence.\n",

Since the intestinal content samples were confirmed as PDCoV-positive, we attempted to isolate virus from these samples in LLC-PK cells. However, only the PDCoV CHN-GD-2016 strain was successfully isolated in LLC-PK cells. The difficulty to isolate PDCoV from positive samples might be associated with the fact that positive RT-PCR samples may contain noninfectious or low amount of virus (Hu et al. 2015a, b). And the amount of trypsin in LLC-PK cells might also contribute to successful PDCoV isolation. CPE was firstly observed in inoculated LLC-PK cells at day 6 p.i.. After plaque purification and several passages, the viral titer reached 1 \u00d7 109 TCID50/mL, showing that the PDCoV CHN-GD-2016 strain was highly replicative in LLC-PK cells. The plaque-purified PDCoV strain in LLC-PK cells was further confirmed by IFA with PDCoV specific rabbit antisera, indicating that we successfully isolated a PDCoV strain in Guangdong. We also observed characteristic crown-like particles of the purified PDCoV CHN-GD-2016 strain by electron microscopy. Despite the successful isolation of one strain, the success rate was relatively low. As a result, further attempts are needed to improve the situation. The attempts might include inoculation of sensitive piglets by fresh homogenate to increase the virus titers for isolation, which are proved to be feasible in PEDV isolation (Chen et al. 2016).",

Based on the phylogenetic tree analysis, all PDCoV strains from GenBank share high nucleotide identities. Notably, the PDCoV CHN-GD-2016 strain can be clustered into one clade with other isolates from mainland China, indicating that PDCoV strains currently circulating in multiple Chinese provinces are closely related. The PDCoV strains isolated in mainland China belong to an independent subcluster. Obviously, further studies are needed to identify the exact origin of the mainland China PDCoVs. Previous studies have shown that the S gene, the most variable region in the coronavirus genomes, belongs to type I membrane glycoproteins family (Woo et al. 2010) and that the S protein of CoVs are involved in receptor binding and viral entry (Woo et al. 2010). Sequencing of S genes revealed characteristic 3 nucleotide deletion, which is also present in most PDCoV strains from mainland China like CHN-HN-2014 strain (Dong et al. 2016), compared with the HKU15 strains. However, whether these unique variations contribute to the efficiency of viral replication and virulence needs to be further investigated.",

Collectively, these results confirmed that PDCoV cause severe diarrhea and vomiting in pigs of 5\u201321 days old. We hypothesized that the PDCoV CHN-GD-2016 strain was also capable of causing the same clinical symptoms in piglets. We infected the 5-day-old newborn piglets with the PDCoV CHN-GD-2016 strain via oral feeding. Our success in reproduction of severe diarrhea and vomiting in piglets by oral infection strongly suggested that PDCoV posed a huge threat to the newborn piglets in pig farms. Furthermore, we collected fecal swabs from the PDCoV-challenged piglets and detected the viral fecal shedding with real-time PCR. PDCoV RNA was detected from day 1 p.i. to day 7 p.i., while no RNA was detected in the negative control piglets during the study, indicating that the infection with PDCoV by fecal-oral contamination might be the major mode of transmission for diarrhea in piglets in pig farms. In addition, gross lesions were obviously observed in the small intestines of the 5-day-old piglets at necropsy at day 7 p.i., similar to observations in other studies (Chen et al. 2015a, b; Jung et al. 2015; Ma et al. 2015; Dong et al. 2016). While microscopic lesions were observed in all sections of small intestine infected by PEDV in previous report (Madson et al. 2014), we only observed microscopic lesions in the jejunum and ileum in CHN-GD-2016 infected piglets, indicating that disease caused by PDCoV was milder than that caused by PEDV. In addition, the PDCoV antigen in the cytoplasm of the villous enterocytes of the PDCoV-challenged piglets was detected by immunohistochemical analysis. Together, all these results confirmed that the PDCoV CHN-GD-2016 strain isolated in this study could cause enteric diseases in newborn piglets. However, there are still several important questions needed to be addressed. For example, what is the relationship between this virus and PEDV, the causative agent for severe diarrhea in pigs? And what is the role of the nucleotide changes of S gene on viral replication and virulence? How to prepare effective vaccine against the PDCoV? Elucidation of these questions will elevate our understandings of the pathogenicity of PDCoV infection and may help to develop better strategies to control PDCoV.",
