Briefly, transmission studies were performed in an ABSL2+ facility at the Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Maryland. Animal studies described were carried out according to the guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Maryland (protocol RO-09-93). For these studies ferrets were not randomized and investigators were not blinded. Prior to inoculation, 23-week-old female ferrets (Sayre, PA) were housed in holding BSL2 for 1.5 weeks to establish a baseline for temperature, weight, and general health. Serum from each ferret was assayed by NP-specific ELISA to rule out prior IAV exposure. Transponders were implanted subcutaneously to provide a means of identification and temperature determination. Ferrets were inoculated with 105 tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50), the amount of virus required to infect 50% of infected cell cultures, diluted in PBS (0.5ml total volume, 0.25ml/nostril was administered intranasally). Directly infected ferrets were inoculated one day prior to the introduction of the na\u00efve direct contact and respiratory contact ferrets. Ferrets were nasal washed (0.25ml PBS/nostril) every day following the administration of anesthesia and assayed by FluDetect (Synbiotics Corp.). Nasal washes continued until animals tested negative for two consecutive days. To prevent cross contamination, ferrets were handled in the following order: RC, DC, DI. Gloves were changed between every virus group. Once an RC ferret tested positive, they became the last to be nasal washed. All viruses, including nasal wash samples and virus stocks, were titrated in MDCK cells by TCID50. Titers were read using 0.5% Turkey RBC three days post-infection.",
