In\nthis study, we expect that any effects of inhibitors would have been\nminimal, as we were operating at the mid to upper end of the calibration\ncurve and did not have difficulty detecting virus in any of the samples.\nAlso, the mass balances did not suggest a major loss of virus. Because\nof requirements of the experimental approach, the surface fraction\nalso included any virions present in the residual liquid that remained\nin the bowls after pouring out the contents; allowing the bowls to\ndry out completely prior to swabbing would not have eliminated these\nvirions. Previous studies have shown that the swabbing method recovers\n7\u201358% of viruses from dry environmental surfaces, depending\non the type of swab, virus, surface material, and virus assay (culture\nvs molecular).26,27 Thus, there is the possibility\nfor both overestimation and underestimation of the amount of virus\nthat partitioned to porcelain, concrete, PVC, and polypropylene in\nthis study.
