The CMV-HTLV-I R promoter has HTLV-I R incorporated as part of exon 1 and intron 1 downstream of the CMV promoter (Figure 1b). This configuration improved DNA vaccine expression and immunogenicity.3, 18 Incorporation of HTLV-I R into NTC8385 (Figure 1b) dramatically increased transgene expression in HEK293 total cellular extracts (Figure 2a) and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) sorted cells (Figure 2b) after transient transfection. This was due to increased mRNA translation efficiency (that is, HTLV-I R increased the amount of EGFP transgene produced per pg cytoplasmic EGFP mRNA; Figure 2c), but not due to increased overall cytoplasmic mRNA levels. By contrast, no effect on integrated expression (either total mean fluorescence or fluorescence per integrated transgene copy) was observed in HEK293 (Figure 2d) or CHO-K1 (Supplementary Figure S1) cells. Consistent with this, the cytoplasmic mRNA translational efficiency improvement observed with HTLV-I R from transiently transfected plasmid did not occur with cytoplasmic RNA produced from genomically integrated plasmid (Figure 2c). Interestingly, the overall amount of EGFP transgene produced per pg of cytoplasmic EGFP mRNA was dramatically higher than that from genomically integrated plasmid compared with transiently transfected plasmid for both CMV and CMV-HTLV-I R promoter plasmids (Figure 2c).",

CMV-HTLV-I R- and CMV promoter-directed transgene expression levels were not affected by addition of RNA Pol III inhibitor to the transfection (RNA Pol III independent; Figure 4a).

This enhancer region, as part of the SV40 promoter, has not caused safety concerns in human clinical trials of SV40 promoter-containing vectors. NTC8485 had improved manufacturing yields because of improved copy number mediated by the SV40 enhancer and the PAS-BH replication origin.6 This configuration of the SV40 enhancer with the CMV promoter was also shown to improve transgene expression after EP-mediated delivery to murine muscle.33 As expected, in vitro expression of NTC8485 was similar to the NTC8385 vector (Figure 5b). Treatment with tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, which induces nuclear localization of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB), thereby increasing transgene expression by activation of multiple NF-\u03baB sites in the CMV promoter, resulted in a higher expression than NTC8385 (Figure 5b), perhaps through activation of the two NF-\u03baB sites in the SV40 enhancer (Figure 5a). Addition of three NF-\u03baB binding sites to NTC8485 (NTC8485-\u03baB) further improved expression after tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 activation (Figure 5b).",
