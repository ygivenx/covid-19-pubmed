To date, the population of domestic cats kept by humans worldwide is estimated at 80-400 million [17], and humans are increasingly paying more attention to the health of cats. Viral diarrhea is common in cats, especially in young kittens, and it is also a major threat to their health. It is commonly recognized that feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) is the major virus that causes diarrhea in cats [21]. Over the past few years, more diarrhea-related viruses, such as feline bocavirus (FBoV) [10], feline astrovirus (FeAstV) [11] and feline kobuvirus (FeKoV) [4], have been described in cats, and new detection techniques have been developed and applied [17].",

            "text": "FPV, a member of the species Carnivore protoparvovirus 1, which belongs to the genus Protoparvovirus within the family Parvoviridae, is a highly contagious pathogen in domestic and wild cats [1]. FPV is transmitted by the faecal-oral route and primarily infects young kittens aged 3-6 months [15, 21], resulting in severe enteric and immunosuppressive diseases characterized by fever, depression, anorexia, vomiting, acute diarrhea, haemorrhagic enteritis and leukopenia [16]. At present, FPV is widely spread throughout the world, with a high mortality rate of 25% to 90% [18], and represents a serious threat to the life and health of cats. Furthermore, infections with canine parvovirus 2a, 2b and 2c (CPV-2a, -2b and -2c) have also been described in domestic cats in many countries [18]. CPV-2 and FPV belong to the same viral species, Carnivore protoparvovirus 1, within the family Parvoviridae [6]. FeAstV, species Mamastrovirus 2, belongs to the genus Mamastrovirus within the family Astroviridae and is a non-enveloped, single-stranded positive RNA virus [11]. FeAstV was first reported in 1981 in faeces from diarrheic cats [9], and a novel FeAstV genotype was found in 2012 [11]; however, studies on FeAstV pathogenicity are limited. FBoV was first detected in a stray cat in Hong Kong in 2012 [10] and has been reported in the USA [27], Portugal [17], Japan [22] and China [25]. According to the latest report of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), FBoV-1, FBoV-2 and FBoV-3 have been recognized as members of the species Carnivore bocaparvovirus 3, 4, and 5, respectively, within the genus Bocaparvovirus [5], based on the amino acid sequence of the complete NS1 gene [25]. Epidemiological investigations in different countries have suggested that FeAstV and FBoV may cause diarrhea in cats with a prevalence of 4.8%-23.4% [3, 14, 20, 24] and 5.5%-25.9% [10, 22, 25, 27], respectively, and coinfections with FPV, FBoV and FeAstV are also common in cats with diarrhea. Because of the similar clinical symptoms and frequency of coinfections with these three viruses, differentiation of these viruses during clinical diagnosis and epidemiological investigations is difficult.",

Multiplex PCR (mPCR) can simultaneously detect and distinguish two or more target viruses in one reaction, can save time and cost, and has been widely used in large-scale epidemiological investigations [8, 28]. In the present study, a mPCR assay was developed by combining three pairs of universal primers targeting different members of the species Carnivore protoparvovirus 1, FBoV and FeAstV in one reaction. This mPCR assay can be used as an easy and effective method for the detection and differentiation of these three viruses in clinical samples.",

In addition, in previous studies, FBoV has been classified into three genotypes (FBoV-1, FBoV-2 and FBoV-3) [22] and FeAstV has been classified into different genotypes [24]. In the present study, we designed three pairs of universal primers that can detect the different genotypes of the three viruses. The mPCR was able to detect nucleic acids extracted from different genotypes of the target virus (Supplementary Fig. 3), suggesting that this method detects a broad spectrum of variants.",

Moreover, healthy cats had higher monoinfection rates, while cats with diarrhea had higher coinfection rates. Furthermore, coinfections with two or three viruses were frequent, especially in cats with diarrhea [17, 19], with a high positive rate of 34.75% (41/118), consistent with a previous report [24].

First, in this study, we also tried to develop mPCR for FPV, FBoV, FeAstV, feline coronavirus and feline kobuvirus, but the results were not good. We think that primer competition affects the specificity and sensitivity of mPCR. Second, the epidemiological investigations of feline diarrhea-associated viruses performed in our laboratory suggest that the prevalence of FPV, FBoV and FeAstV is higher in healthy and diarrheic cats and that mixed infections with these three viruses are common in clinical cases. The establishment of this method provides a convenient and advantageous test for epidemiological investigations of these three viruses. However, there are fewer types of viruses involved in epidemiological investigations of feline diarrhea-associated viruses, which is a limitation of this paper. In future studies, we will try to establish an mPCR assay for additional feline diarrhea-associated viruses.",
