In 2004, the National Information Reporting System of Infectious Diseases, an internet-based real-time information reporting technique, was integrated into NDRS to improve case-based reporting. The workflow includes data collection, data management, data use, and report dissemination. Once a case of notifiable infectious disease or emerging infectious disease is identified, it is mandatory for doctors in all hospitals and clinics to report to the network within the statutory period. CDCs at various levels (e.g., provincial) are in charge of data checking, utilization, and timely information feedback by uploading the reports on the websites. All the hospitals and CDCs at different levels can download these reports and know the national status in a timely manner, which makes the epidemic information transparent. The completeness and timeliness of case reporting have improved dramatically since 2004 (9). Therefore, this study takes 2005 as the first year of analysis, considering data quality and stability.",

Imported P. falciparum malaria is a major obstacle to achieving malaria elimination in China (12\u201314). This study showed that malaria was the most frequent imported infectious disease during 2005\u20132016, and Yunnan was the province with the greatest number of cases of imported malaria, which was consistent with other relevant studies in China (15\u201317). The reason for the large number of imported cases is that Yunnan Province has long international borders with Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam, and other countries of the Greater Mekong Subregion that show a high incidence of malaria (16). The persons who cross these borders to enter or leave China increase opportunities for infectious diseases to be imported from adjacent countries (3,14,18,19), especially from Myanmar (12,13,20).",

First, as a result of the rapid development of international economic exchange, trade, and travel, the number of migrant workers from China in Africa and Asia has increased annually in recent years. Second, climate and sanitary conditions in Africa and Southeast Asia are suitable for mosquitoes. Migrant workers from China in these areas are engaged mostly in outdoor field work, and their working and living environments are not mosquito preventive. Therefore, they have greater risk for infection (24,25). In addition, their health education level and self-protection awareness are low. All these factors have resulted in an increased number of malaria and other mosquitoborne diseases (26). Therefore, the main challenges of eliminating P. falciparum malaria are curtailing border malaria and imported cases from Myanmar and countries in Africa (6,14). Cooperation between China and neighboring countries has played an important role in improving malaria control at cross-border areas and should be further strengthened.",

However, the numbers and the types of imported infectious diseases reported have increased in recent years. We indicate 4 main reasons for this increase. First, globalization is a major factor. With growing economic globalization, ongoing development of international trade, and convenient and fast transportation in recent years, factors such as microbial mutation, global warming, floods, droughts, and natural migration of animals as disease vectors have increased the risk of disease introduction into China (27\u201329). Second, these increases are related to the increases in the number of migrant workers from China, as well as increases in the number of tourists. This study showed that migrant workers from China accounted for a large proportion of imported malaria. Migrant workers and tourists are more at risk than local residents because of lack of preexisting immunity that dramatically increases the chances that they could become infected with these diseases and bring them in from abroad (19). Third, the level of surveillance, diagnosis, and detection of emerging or reemerging infectious diseases improved in China during the study years, which potentially contributed to the increase in the number and the types of cases with a confirmed diagnosis. Finally, some of the increases were caused by newly discovered or emerging infections, such as MERS, which was discovered in 2012 and confirmed in 2013; the 1 case imported into China was a result of the large outbreak in South Korea in 2015.",

The imported cases that were analyzed in this study were reported through the National Information Reporting System of Infectious Diseases and identified by local CDC staff through epidemiologic investigation; therefore, not all imported cases may have been identified. A second limitation is that the data of this study were obtained from the monitoring system and there are few denominator data to use for calculating the rates of imported infectious diseases, so conclusions are limited and risks cannot be calculated. Finally, the factors concerning imported infectious diseases are complex, whereas our data are limited. Some demographic characteristics; trip information, such as purpose and duration of travel; and climate, environmental, and other relevant information could not be obtained.

Screening has played a major role in prevention as the first line of defense against importation of foreign infectious diseases. For example, among 25 cases of Zika virus disease imported into mainland China in 2016, border screening recognized 9 (11), and of 11 cases of imported yellow fever reported in 2016, border screening recognized 6 (32).
