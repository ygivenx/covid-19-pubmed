It is the causative agent of infectious salmon anaemia (ISA). Under normal conditions, ISA has only been detected in farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), and infected salmon exhibit clinical signs such as lethargy, anaemia, ascites, haemorrhagic liver, necrosis and congestion of internal organs [2]. The disease may result in high mortality with detrimental effects on farm production. Before the introduction of mandatory depopulation of net pens and production sites experiencing ISA outbreaks, the cumulative mortality during an outbreak could reach up to 90% [2\u20134].",

The genomic segment 8 encodes two overlapping Open Reading Frames (ORFs) using a bicistronic coding strategy [8], similar to Influenza A virus segment 8, which encodes the non-structural (NS) protein. The smaller product of ISAV segment 8 ORF1 is 591 nucleotides long encoding a 22\u201324-kDa matrix protein, and the 726 nucleotides-long ORF2 encodes a 27.4-kDa protein (s8ORF2) [6, 9]. The s8ORF2 is a viral structural protein [8] having two nuclear localising signals (NLSs). It shows nuclear localisation early in the infection cycle and later on localises to the cytosol as well [8]. It binds RNA and antagonises cellular type I interferon (IFN) response [8]. A vertebrate host exhibits two potent innate pathways for defence against viral infections: IFN and RNAi pathways [10\u201312]. In Atlantic salmon, ISAV-induced type I interferon response fails to restrict ISAV replication [13]. However, the potency of ISAV-responsive RNAi pathway in containing viral infection has not been studied so far.",

            "text": "In counter-defence to RNAi defence mechanism, viruses utilise their polypeptides to inhibit the innate RNAi pathway [14, 15]. The mechanism of action of these polypeptides is based on their binding to cellular factors like ds RNA, or interacting with other RNA-silencing factors, to inhibit the RNAi pathway [15, 16]. RNA viruses produce ds RNA, transiently, during replication, transcription etc. in the cytosol. The presence of ds RNA is a pre-requisite for triggering RNAi pathway. The host cell recognises ds RNA in the cell cytoplasm as a pathogen associated cellular marker [17] and initiates antiviral RNA-silencing mechanism in all eukaryotes [18\u201320]. During this process, viral ds RNA is processed by Dicer nuclease into 21\u201325 nucleotide long siRNA duplexes [18] which in turn are diverted to RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISC) to silence the target viral mRNA [19, 21\u201323]. Indeed, RNA viruses are known to be pre-emptive towards cellular defences and have adopted strategies to evade such cellular defence mechanisms (reviewed by [24] and [25]), by suppressing host RNAi pathways through a Viral Suppressor of RNAi or VSR [15, 26, 27]. A few of the VSRs of animal viral origin exhibit RNA binding and interferon antagonism simultaneously [28]. The VSR polypeptides, namely, Tat (HIV-1), NS1 (Influenza virus) and E3L (Vaccinia virus), VP35 (Ebolavirus) have three roles in common [29\u201332]. They all are interferon antagonists, secondly, they all bind to ds RNA molecules and thirdly, they interact with RNAi machinery components to block RNAi pathway.",

This report identifies s8ORF2 as the third fish viral protein to be identified for RNAi suppressor function. It binds to ds RNA, siRNA and to Salmo salar Mov10 (SsMov10) of the RNAi pathway. Various domains were identified for RNAi suppression, RNA binding, SsMov10 interaction and dimerisation in vitro. The SsMov10 appears to play a significant role as s8ORF2 aide in RNAi suppression as it is a characterised RNA-induced Silencing Complex (or RISC\u2014It is a multiprotein complex which uses miRNA or siRNA as the complementary strands and cleaves mRNA) maturing factor.",

DNA oligonucleotides L1 and U1 were annealed to obtain 10 pmol/\u03bb of ds DNA oligo. 300-bp-long ss RNAs were generated from linearised M2-pCMV-tag2b (clone from our lab) plasmid using in vitro transcription kit (Ambion, Thermo-Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA).

The vector pCMV-tag-2b has T3 and T7 promoters in the opposite sides of MCS. Therefore, the M2 gene (291 bp) cloned in the MCS produces RNA molecules from forward (T3 promoter) and reverse (T7 promoter) directions.

All DNA samples were agroinfiltrated onto GFP-silenced leaf (in triplicates) of T2 (second-generation tobacco plants) stable line of Nicotiana xanthi [36, 43]. Agroinfiltration of a test ORF would lead to its transient expression in planta where its activity is studied. The agroinfiltrated leaves were collected 7 days post-infiltration (dpi) and observed over UV trans-illuminator in darkroom. The GFP-silenced leaf and SARS-6a-infiltrated leaf appeared red under UV due to chlorophyll auto-fluorescence [44] whereas the s8ORF2 appeared fluorescent green similar to the positive controls SARS-7a and SARS-3a (Fig. 1a). Thus, the expression of s8ORF2 in the GFP-silenced line resulted in the reversal of silencing effect and thereby restored the expression of previously silenced reporter gene GFP. Hence, ISAV-s8ORF2 acts as a suppressor of RNA silencing, in planta.\n",

The graph (Fig. 1b) shows population of HEK293T cells exhibiting reverted GFP-expressing cell population in the range of approximately 67% for s8ORF2, as against GFP silenced (7.8%). SARS-7a and SARS-3a were used as positive controls. In Adenovirus VA, the RNA molecules, RNAI and RNAII have been identified to be responsible for the RNAi suppressor function [45, 46]. To elucidate the role of s8ORF2 protein versus s8orf2 RNA in the RNAi-suppression assay, a nonsense mutant was generated by inserting a base (G) immediately after the start codon using site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 1c). This nonsense mutant was termed NM-s8ORF2. Dose-dependent analyses of s8ORF2 and NM-s8ORF2 were done by incrementing the amount of DNA by 100 ng in each well. The addition of wt-s8ORF2 plasmid in increasing concentration, increased the suppression, reflected by increase in the population of GFP-positive cells from 5% with 100 ng to 25% with 500 ng (Fig. 1c). The NM-s8ORF2 had minimal influence on GFP-expressing population, with a maximum effect at ~ 5.5% with (500 ng) suggesting that the VSR activity is a component of s8ORF2 protein but not its RNA, which was otherwise conserved in NM-s8ORF2.",

Bacterially purified s8ORF2-GST and GST were assayed for their siRNA-binding activities in the presence of 21 bps GFP siRNA. Alongside, an already studied Mungbean Yellow Mosaic India Virus (MYMIV) protein AC-2 fused to MBP was used as a negative control. MYMIV is a VSR but devoid of siRNA-binding activity [47]. The results showed no change in the mobility of GFP probe on incubation with GST, MBP and AC2-MBP proteins, whereas with s8ORF2, probe mobility was significantly reduced, suggesting that s8ORF2 possesses siRNA-binding activity (Fig. 2a). We validated the s8ORF2\u2013siRNA complex band by increasing the s8ORF2 protein amount from 37.5 to 75.0 \u00b5mol/L and 150.0 \u00b5mol/L. We observed a continued increase in the intensity of a specific band with increased dose (Fig. 2b lane 3\u20135). Since no further increase in the intensity was observed subsequent to increase from 75.0 to 150.0 \u00b5mol/L, we used 75.0 \u00b5mol/L of s8ORF2 for all further experiments. In supershift experiments, shift in the band with anti-s8ORF2, but not with anti-His (non-specific ab) (Fig. 2b, lane 6\u20137) confirmed the specificity of the s8ORF2-siRNA band.\n",

Also using COILS Software [8], a coiling domain was predicted to be present in the C-terminal of s8ORF2 spanning 196\u2013243 aa (illustrated in Fig. 3a) [8]. Based on these predictions, we hypothesised that these domains might display the functions of RNA binding and dimerisation and therefore designed deletion mutants and tested them in the RNA-EMSA experiments (Fig. 3b). We generated deletion mutants by PCR amplification, namely, \u0394NTD with 183 nt deleted from the N-terminal, \u0394CTD with 144 nt deleted from the C-terminus. These were cloned in the pGEX-4T-1 plasmid, and the purified proteins were obtained. Both the truncated polypeptides retained the RNA-binding activity, as shown in Fig. 3b, lanes 1\u20134. We also made a double-deletion mutant in which both the N- and C-terminals were deleted; we denoted this mutant as \u0394DD.

The dimerisation capacity of most RNAi suppressor molecules identified, has been established, and is speculated to be responsible for their activity. Therefore we tested the C-terminal deletion mutants for dimerisation in a yeast two-hybrid assay. The truncated s8ORF2 was made to interact with C-terminal deletion (\u0394CTD) on both GBKT7 and GADT7 vectors, respectively. Similarly the pGBKT7-\u0394CTD and pGADT7-\u0394CTD were also tested for dimerisation in the yeast two-hybrid assay. The doubly deleted \u0394CTD-\u0394CTD produced no colonies whereas s8ORF2-s8ORF2 (both wild type protein in respective vectors) produced colonies as well as blue colour in Beta-galactosidase assay, indicating positive dimerisation (Fig. 3d). Therefore, the C-terminal carries the dimerisation domain confirming our COILS prediction [8]. But we could not find any difference in the RNAi-suppression activity of the three deletion mutants as indicated by p-values (Fig. 3c).",

The purified s8ORF2 protein was used as bait in a 96 well plate and phage library was exposed to the bait according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. This screen identified a number of RNAi co-factors as putative interactors. We selected SsMov10 [51, 52] as a potential interactor using Informatic tools. SsMov10 is a RNA helicase component of the RNAi pathway and is actively involved in post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS). Recently it has been identified as a host restriction factor for the influenza A virus life cycle across various species [53]. In the yeast two-hybrid assay the interaction was found to be strong enough to withstand 25 mM 3-Amino Triazole (Fig. 5a, quadrant 5) and showed fivefold higher \u03b2-galactosidase activity as compared to the controls (Fig. 5a \u03b2-galactosidase activity histogram). Interestingly, \u0394NTD-s8ORF2 exhibited even higher strength of interaction with SsMov10 (Fig. 5a, quadrant 6 and 5a \u03b2-galactosidase activity histogram). Mutant studies revealed that s8ORF2 requires the C-terminal for this interaction as \u0394CTD did not show interaction with SsMov10 (Fig. 5a quadrant-7 and 5a \u03b2-galactosidase activity histogram). To supplement this analysis, we also identified the co-localisation between SsMov10 and s8ORF2 using immunofluorescence (Fig. 5b).\n",

On overexpressing in HEK293T cells, surprisingly, the SsMov10 was found to suppress the RNAi pathway quite equivalent to that of s8ORF2 (Fig. 5c), indicating that it may also possess RNAi-suppression activity. On co-transfecting s8ORF2 and SsMov10, in the GFP-reversal assay, we found enhanced GFP reversal compared to cells transfected individually with s8ORF2 or SsMov10 (Fig. 5c), suggesting that SsMov10 may supplement the RNAi suppressor function of s8ORF2 endogenously. To support this hypothesis, we performed real-time qPCR experiments in infected TO cells. The physiological concentration of SsMov10 was estimated by real-time qPCR experiments, taking the EF factor as a control. These values were used as a reference for further analysis of correlation in the expression of the ISAV s8ORF2 protein with infection. However, these results should be supported and substantiated with siRNA-based silencing experiments (to silence endogenous SsMov10), but we were constrained due to the low transfection efficiency of TO cells, to carry out our experiments.",

It is evident in Fig. 6d (i) that the level of SsMov10 declines at about the end of viral replication cycle as well. These results suggest regulation of SsMov10 levels during the viral infection at 72 hpi (Fig. 5d (i)). This could be the result of a constant check to prevent the protein from engaging in RISC Assembly, since the SsMov10 possesses RISC Assembly function [53]. Next, we analysed the effect of viral dose on SsMov10 transcript levels, which indicated a positive correlation of SsMov10 expression, at 12 hpi, the trend coherently visible even on increasing viral dose (Fig. 5d (ii)). On increasing the viral titre successively by tenfold, there was an increased expression of SsMov10, in comparison with controls (not shown to avoid confusion). We observed a logarithmic scale turnover, in the values of SsMov10 expression, at least at mRNA levels. This trend leads us to hypothesise that a transcriptional control over SsMov10 (Fig. 6), one of the crucial RNAi molecules, is present.\n",

We have identified that s8ORF2 binds to siRNA as well as long RNA molecules, in the competitive EMSA experiments, in vitro. Here, we can speculate that it binds to the substrates of DICER and RISC in fish cells as well, presuming that this pathway is conserved in fish, similar to its conservation through plants, insects and mammals. We can warrant that since 22 bp and 300 bp are substrates to RNAi pathway, these RNA molecules point to site of s8ORF2\u2019s action [59\u201361]. The VSR protein binding to ds RNA would seize the input of ds RNA to DICER in the RNAi pathway (Fig. 6), thereby paralysing the pathway, as is the case with VP35 (Ebola virus), NS1 (Influenza A virus), B2 (Nodamura virus) and E3L (Vaccinia virus).",

Thus, we proposed that these functions might exist as independent domains, and cloned three deletion mutants: the first, in which the N-terminal, predicted to be RNA-binding domain (\u0394NTD); second, the C-terminal predicted to cause dimerisation (\u0394CTD); and third, both N- and C-terminals were deleted (\u0394DD). Each of these deletion mutants was analysed for RNA binding, dimerisation and GFP-reversal activity. The RNA-binding activity was found to be focussed in the middle region (62\u2013195 aa). The dimerisation domain was found to be present in the C-terminal but was not responsible for the RNAi-suppression activity. Therefore, we conclude that the RNAi-inhibition-active domain is present in the middle region (62\u2013195 aa), which is doubly deleted for N- and C-terminals. It also has an Ago-binding GW motif at 114GW115. The VSR polypeptides utilise this motif as a hook to seize the Ago-2 molecule and eventually RNAi pathway by selectively targeting host RNA for degradation and favouring vRNA for replication. This implied the presence of another host molecule interacting with s8ORF2, which provisionally aided it in countering the RNAi pathway.",

To scrutinise and approach such a factor, we employed Ph.D.-12, Phage display peptide library kit biopanning technique (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverely, MA, USA). We selected SsEPC-1, SsEPC-2, SsMov10 and SsMLL-1 of RNAi pathway (since they were partially identical with 12-bp peptide), analysed them bio-informatically from the protein library and performed yeast two-hybrid analysis by interacting with s8ORF2. SsMov10 was selected for further analysis, since it was the most studied and belonged to PTGS, whereas other molecules belonged to TGS. SsMov10 was found to interact with s8ORF2 in all the yeast two-hybrid assays, with the C-terminal domain responsible for the interaction. Yeast two-hybrid assay and confocal microscopy confirmed the interaction. Surprisingly, SsMov10 was found to exhibit RNAi-suppression activity. On co-transfecting s8ORF2 and SsMov10 in the same GFP-reversal experiment, their activity was additive, suggesting a clever utilisation of host factor for the viral benefit (Fig. 6).",
