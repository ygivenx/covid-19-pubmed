            "text": "Pepsin, the main digestive enzyme, is crucial for digestive processes in the stomach. Pepsin is synthesized from pepsinogen and secreted by gastric chief cells [6, 7]. Pepsin has a single polypeptide enzymatic chain containing 324 amino acid residues and a molecular mass of 35 000 Da [8]. Pepsin is a member of the large family of aspartic proteases, which are of significant medical and pharmaceutical interest because several of these enzymes have important roles in the development of various human diseases, formation of gastric ulcers, HIV maturation, and use as prognostic tools for breast-tumor invasiveness [9]. The drug interacts with pepsin when upon entering the stomach [10]. Several reports on the interactions of several molecules with pepsin have been published [11\u201315]. Recently, Esra Maltas [16] reported the interactions of NIC with several proteins, including human serum albumin, hemoglobin, and globulin. However, to the best of our knowledge, only a few studies focused on the interaction behavior between NIC and pepsin. The interaction of NIC with pepsin and enzymes can provide useful information on drug action and explain its mechanism of action in the human body.",

The surfaces and contours of the HOMO and LUMO plots of the optimized structures of NIC are shown in Fig. 2. Finally, E\nLUMO, E\nHOMO, \u2206E, \u03bc, \u03b7, and the molecular volume of NIC are 0.0802 a.u., \u22120.2504 a.u., 0.3306 a.u., \u22120.0851, 0.1653, and 168.173 cm3 \u00b7 mol\u22121, respectively. Notably, charge density was mainly accumulated on the benzene ring and carbonyl group in the HOMO and LUMO. In addition, a significantly large disparity in the distribution of electric charge between HOMO and LUMO was observed. When NIC binds to the amino acid residues of pepsin by charge transfer, the benzene ring and carbonyl group are the main binding groups. Moreover, the binding forces may presumably be \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking or hydrogen bonding. In light of the weak interaction of NIC with pepsin, the ester groups could be the main contributors to the hydrophobic binding force [15]. The results of quantum chemistry calculations can provide a theoretical basis of how to analyze the model of drug binding with pepsin.\n",

The changes in emission spectra can provide information on a molecule\u2019s structure and dynamics [26]. The fluorescence of pepsin is mainly due to tryptophan (Trp) and tyrosine (Tyr) residues. The maximum fluorescence intensities of the Trp and Tyr residues of proteins excited at 280 nm are approximately 340 and 300 nm, respectively [27]. The fluorescence spectra of pepsin at various NIC concentrations are shown in Fig. 3. The fluorescence intensity of pepsin decreased regularly with the increase in NIC concentration, which indicated that NIC was bound to pepsin and affected the structure [10]. Moreover, NIC should be located at or near the Trp residues when it binds with pepsin.\n",

            "text": "Fluorescence quenching is the decrease in the quantum yield of fluorescence from a fluorophore induced by a variety of molecular interactions, such as excited-state reactions, energy transfer, ground-state complex formation, and collisional quenching [23]. The different mechanisms of quenching are usually classified as either dynamic quenching or static quenching, which can be distinguished based on different dependencies on temperature and viscosity or preferably by lifetime measurements. Given that a higher temperature resulted in higher diffusion coefficients, the dynamic quenching constants will increase with increasing temperature. By contrast, the increase in temperature is likely to result in decreased stability of complexes. Thus, the values of the static quenching constants are expected to be smaller [22, 28]. The well-known Stern\u2013Volmer equation was used to confirm the mechanism [29], as follows:6\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ \\frac{F_0}{F}=1+{K}_q{\\tau}_0\\left[Q\\right]=1+{K}_{SV}\\left[Q\\right] $$\\end{document}F0F=1+Kq\u03c40Q=1+KSVQwhere F\n0 and F represent the fluorescence intensity in the absence and presence of the quencher, respectively; [Q] is the concentration of the quencher; \u03c4\n0 is the fluorescence lifetime in the absence of the quencher and its value always is 10\u22128 s [30]; K\nq is the quenching rate constant of the biological macromolecule; and K\nSV is the Stern\u2013Volmer quenching constant. In this study, the fluorescence quenching spectra of pepsin in the presence of different NIC concentrations were obtained at three different temperatures (293, 301, and 310 K) to elucidate the quenching mechanism. Figure 4 shows the Stern\u2013Volmer plots for pepsin fluorescence quenching by NIC. The calculated K\nSV and K\nq values are summarized in Table 1. Results show that the K\nq value was greater than 2.0 \u00d7 1010 L \u00b7 mol\u22121 \u00b7 s\u22121, whereas the maximum diffusion collision quenching rate constant of various quenchers with biopolymer is 2.0 \u00d7 1010 L \u00b7 mol\u22121 \u00b7 s\u22121 [31]. The above finding indicates a complex formation between protein and quencher, which corresponds to the static mechanism rather than the dynamic collision quenching.\n\n",

By plotting log(F\n0 \u2212 F)/F versus log[Q] (as shown in Fig. 5), n and K\nbcan be calculated. The results are summarized in Table 2. Notably, the values of n at the experimental temperatures were approximately equal to 1, indicating that the existence of only a single binding site in pepsin for NIC. The value of K\nb is 1.1809 \u00d7 105 L \u00b7 mol\u22121 at room temperature, indicating that a strong interaction exists between NIC and pepsin. To improve the credibility of the combination results, absorption\u2013titration experiments were conducted. The UV\u2013vis spectra of NIC with various pepsin concentrations at 293 K are given in Fig. 6. NIC showed maximum absorption at 343 nm, while pepsin showed no absorption from 290 to 400 nm.

K\nb can be obtained from the ratio of the slope to the intercept in the plots of C/(\u03b5a -\u03b5f) versus C. Based on the absorption spectra, the binding constant K\nb for NIC and pepsin was 1.83 \u00d7 105 L \u00b7 mol\u22121 at room temperature, which is consistent with the fluorescence quenching data. Thus, NIC can be stored and carried by pepsin. Furthermore, the existence of an independent class of binding sites on pepsin for NIC was inferred based on the values of n.\n\n\n",

The aim of this subsection is to attempt to account for the symbols and magnitudes of the thermodynamic parameters of protein association reactions to analyze the molecular forces. The thermodynamic parameters are vital for confirming the intermolecular forces. Ross and Subramanian [34] have summed up the thermodynamic laws to determine the types of binding with various interactions. If \u2206H < 0 and \u2206S < 0, then van der Waals force and hydrogen bond interactions play the main roles in the binding reaction. If \u2206H > 0 and \u2206S > 0, then hydrophobic interactions are dominant. If \u2206H < 0 and \u2206S > 0, then electrostatic interactions are the main driving forces. When the temperature range is narrow, enthalpy change (\u2206H) can be regarded as a constant. Enthalpy change (\u2206H) and entropy change (\u2206S) can help confirm the binding modes. (\u2206H) and (\u2206S) can be calculated using the Van\u2019t Hoff equation, written as follows [35]:9\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ \\ln K=-\\frac{\\varDelta H}{RT}+\\frac{\\varDelta S}{R} $$\\end{document}lnK=\u2212\u0394HRT+\u0394SR\n10\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ \\varDelta G=-RT \\ln K=\\varDelta H-T\\varDelta S $$\\end{document}\u0394G=\u2212RTlnK=\u0394H\u2212T\u0394Swhere K is the binding constant at the corresponding temperature, R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature. The results are presented in Table 2. A negative \u2206G indicates that the binding process was spontaneous and enthalpy-driven at the corresponding temperature. The positive \u2206H and \u2206S values indicate that hydrophobic interactions have major roles in the binding between NIC and pepsin. Results from the present study and other reports showed that binding of many small molecules pepsin occurred via a static quenching mechanism [7, 10, 11, 36\u201338]. Notably, Li Zhen et al. studied the binding between pepsin and nucleoside analogs (FNC, CYD, and CMP) via a static quenching mechanism. In addition, the effects of molecular structure on the binding aspects have also been compared [12]. Curcumin [7] binding with pepsin mainly through hydrophobic interactions with one binding site, while pepsin bind with silybin [10], and nobilietin [37] mainly through hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. Chlorogenic acid [38] and pepsin were mainly strengthened by Van der Waals\u2019 forces and hydrogen bonds. Furthermore, the binding affinity or binding constants varied. The binding constants for NIC and pepsin calculated using fluorescence data and UV\u2013vis absorption spectra were at the order of magnitude of 105 L \u00b7 mol\u22121 and similar to the nobiletin-pepsin system [37]. The binding constant for fleroxaci [13] and ligupurpuroside A [36] were 106 L \u00b7 mol\u22121, and prulifloxacin [39] has the binding constant of 108 L \u00b7 mol\u22121. Results showed that prulifloxacin binds at higher affinity to pepsin than other drugs.",

The overlap of the absorption spectrum of NIC and the fluorescence emission spectrum of pepsin is shown in Fig. 7. The overlap integral J can be evaluated by integrating the spectra in Fig. 6 based on Eq. (13). In the present case, k\n2 = 2/3, n = 1.36, and \u03a6 = 0.15 [42]. Based on Eqs.

The maximal academic critical distance for R\n0 ranges from 5 to 10 nm, and the maximum academic distance between donor and acceptor for r\n0 ranges from 7 to 10 nm [27]. The donor to acceptor distance was less than 8 nm, indicating the high possibility of energy transfer from NIC to pepsin occurred. The above result was in accordance with the conditions of F\u00f6rster theory of nonradiative energy transfer and suggests static quenching between NIC and pepsin.\n",

The change in absorption spectral of pepsin in the presence of drugs is shown in Fig. 8. The UV\u2013vis spectra of pepsin with intense absorption near 278 nm are attributable to \u03c0\u2013\u03c0* transitions of the aromatic amino acids Tyr, Trp, and phenylalanine (Phe) [44]. The intensity of the absorption peak at 278 nm increased with the addition of NIC for the ratio of the free drug to NIC\u2013pepsin complex would be increased with increase of the drug concentration, and the absorption maximum exhibited a slight blue-shift toward the lower wavelength region (from 275 to 273 nm). Upon addition of NIC to the solution, the peaks in the far UV region (approximately 250 nm) of the pepsin\u2013NIC complex increased, and the maximum peak position exhibited an evident blue-shift (from 257 to 251 nm) compared with a solution of pepsin at the lowest NIC concentration. The above results implied that as hydrophobicity increased, the peptide strands of pepsin were extended [45], thereby inducing a conformational change in pepsin. NIC binds to pepsin at high affinigy through strong hydrophobic interactions [33].\n",

On other hand, the hydrophobic interactions between NIC and Trp residues of pepsin have been enhanced [12]. However, no shift in the maximum emission wavelength occurred at \u2206\u03bb = 15 nm, indicating that NIC has little effect on the microenvironment of Tyr residues in pepsin [48].

Peak a represents the Rayleigh scattering peak (\u03bb\nem = \u03bb\nex), and peak 1 (\u03bb\nex/\u03bb\nem = 280 nm/336 nm) mainly reveals the spectral features of Tyr and Trp residues. When pepsin is excited at 280 nm, the intrinsic fluorescence of Trp and Tyr residues can be detected, and the fluorescence of Phe residue is negligible [10]. In the presence of NIC, the fluorescence intensity of peak 1 (\u03bb\nem/\u03bb\nex = 280/349) decreased from 786.5 to 289.2. The observed large-scale decrease after the addition of NIC implied that changes in the peptide chain structure of pepsin took place.

The intensity of fluorescence spectra of NIC with pepsin at pH 2.0 decreased slightly as NaCl concentration increased (Fig. 11). This effect can be caused by an increase in the apparent dissociation constant due to the electrostatic screening of salt counterions on both NIC and pepsin [49]. On the other hand, even at a very high ionic strength, the fluorescence attenuation of NIC is still unremarkable, thereby suggesting that instead of electrostatic forces, hydrophobic interactions are mainly responsible for the interaction.

            "text": "Molecular docking is a computational technique extensively used in analyzing the interactions between ligands and proteins [50]. The lowest energy ranked results of four NIC\u2013pepsin conformations are listed in Table 3. For all the simulated binding conformations, NIC binds with the pepsin cavity. Moreover, the exact binding sites of NIC on pepsin are different among the six conformations. The exact binding site of NIC on pepsin with the lowest binding free energy is shown in Fig. 12. The docking revealed the most likely binding site in the enzyme. The interaction occurs in the area between domains I and III [11], wherein NIC is surrounded by Asp-32, Asp-215, Thr-77, Tyr-75, Tyr-189, Gly-76, Ile-213, Ile-301, and Val-292. Hydrogen bonds exist between the phenolic hydroxyl of NIC and Asp-32 (with a distance of 1.903 \u00c5) and between the carbonyl group of NIC and Gly-76 (with a distance of 1.891 \u00c5) (Fig. 12c). Moreover, NIC enters the hydrophobic cavity of pepsin via hydrophobic interactions between NIC and pepsin (Fig. 12a and b). The abovementioned results agree well with the aforementioned thermodynamic analysis. Thus, based on docking and synchronous fluorescence results, NIC bound directly to the enzyme cavity site, which subsequently influenced the microenvironment of the catalytic site.\n\n",

The activity of pepsin in the absence of NIC was set to 1, and changes in enzyme activity induced by the presence of different NIC concentrations were measured. As shown in Fig. 13, pepsin activity changed evidently in the presence of NIC. As the NIC concentration increased, the relative pepsin activity significantly decreased. Moreover, 50 % of the relative pepsin activities was approximately 9.01 \u00d7 10\u22125 mol \u00b7 L\u22121. The results are consistent with the molecular docking and synchronous fluorescence results and indicated that NIC can inhibit pepsin activity.\n",

Fluorescence data showed that the fluorescence quenching mechanism of pepsin occurred mainly through static quenching. Quenching constants (K\nb) were obtained using both fluorescence data and UV\u2013vis spectra. Based on the results of thermodynamic parameters and molecular docking study, NIC could spontaneously bind with pepsin mainly through hydrophobic and hydrogen bonds. Results from the salt effect experiment suggest that hydrophobic interactions, not electrostatic interactions, are mainly responsible for the interaction. The distance between NIC and pepsin was sufficiently small (r = 2.47 nm) to induce nonradiative energy transfer from pepsin to drug. The synchronous and three-dimensional fluorescence spectra confirmed that binding of NIC to pepsin induced some microenvironmental and conformational changes in pepsin molecules, which could cause inhibition of pepsin activity. The results obtained will be of biological significance for the transportation and distribution of NIC in vivo and beneficial for the investigation of the pharmacological function and dynamics of NIC.",
