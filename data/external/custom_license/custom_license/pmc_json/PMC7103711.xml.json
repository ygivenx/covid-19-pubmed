Owing to the high analytical sensitivity, rapidity, multiplexing capacity and increasing affordability of the new molecular methods, older techniques using virus isolation in cell culture, antigen detection via enzyme immunoassays or immunofluorescence microscopy, and conventional qualitative PCR techniques have in essence become obsolete for everyday clinical practice [1\u20133]. However, direct immunofluorescence of specimen smears (direct fluorescent antibody [DFA]) is still used in some laboratories owing to its specificity, rapidity and cost\u2013effectiveness, but its sensitivity is consistently lower than that offered by most molecular methods [4\u201310]. Virus isolation in cell culture and related techniques may remain important in special situations, for example in order to identify unknown infectious agents, where identification of the SARS corona virus is an important example. Moreover, a clinical isolate provides infectious material that could be used for biological analysis, including phenotypic determination of, for example, resistance to antiviral treatment.",

In-house systems based on real-time PCR utilize a combination of three to six multiplex PCR reactions, with the capacity to assay for 15 or more different respiratory agents in a sample. A reverse transcriptase step prior to PCR is required for the detection of genomes of RNA viruses. The multiplex systems linked with liquid array (i.e., bead-based) can theoretically resolve up to 100 independent channels, whose capacity is only partly utilized in the current commercial systems, managing analysis of more than 20 different agents in the same sample. The performance of three such commercial systems were recently compared [17].

This is also relevant for disease episodes with a longer duration of symptoms. Thus, the detection frequency for enveloped respiratory viruses decreased from more than 51 to 30% for specimens taken from patients within 0\u20136 versus 7\u201314 days of symptom duration, respectively [30]. A similar decline in the detection frequency over time has also been observed for RSV [31,32]. In the study by Brittain-Long et al., a linear increase in threshold cycle (Ct) value dependent on the duration of symptoms was observed for the majority of enveloped respiratory viruses [30]. This suggests a gradual decrease in the amount of virus that was shed even if clinical symptoms remain. In the same study, there was a moderate increase in the Ct value for HRV in the cases that were still PCR-positive after 10 days, indicating that replication during HRV infection declines slowly. This is concordant with the finding that children may shed HRV and HEV from the respiratory mucus for several weeks [33]. Some respiratory viruses, such as bocaviruses, may be shed for several months [34].",

            "text": "It is justified to conclude that molecular diagnostic procedures for viral respiratory diseases have unparalleled detection sensitivities in comparison with older techniques [18,19]. An obvious risk with a sensitive assay is that a positive result may reflect a clinically irrelevant carriership rather than a symptomatic infection. This risk appears to be limited among adult individuals for most respiratory viruses: all but two (HRV in both cases) specimens from 100 healthy Swedish control subjects were negative for respiratory viruses [30], and in a similar British study, 2 and 6% of the healthy controls were positive for HRV or IFA, respectively [35]. The observed higher rate of detection of HRV reported for healthy children may represent either truly asymptomatic carriership or, more likely, prolonged postsymptomatic shedding of picornavirus [36\u201339]. Thus, a nonsymptomatic status is usually defined by the absence of symptoms up to 1 week before and 1 week after the time for sampling [38]. However, HRV may remain detectable by PCR methods for 2 weeks or more after the onset of symptoms [30]. Immunocompromised individuals may shed detectable amounts of respiratory viruses, for example RSV, in the absence of respiratory symptoms [40,41]. Moreover, it should be kept in mind that some respiratory viruses, above all HBoV in infected children, may be secreted for several months [34,42,43], and that therefore additional diagnostic measures must be included in these cases to demonstrate an etiological relationship to respiratory symptoms (see section \u2018Newly discovered respiratory viruses\u2019). In conclusion, quantitative methods, such as real-time PCR, offer additional diagnostic value over nonquantitative methods, because the quantity of the agent detected may aid in distinguishing a true etiological agent from an innocent bystander [27,44].",

            "text": "A broad diagnostic panel, preferably consisting of 15 or more agents, also offers an additional diagnostic value: first, a negative result is more valid if many agents have been targeted. Second, the quantitative component of the test improves the interpretation of a positive result, not least if several agents are detected and the Ct values of these agents can then be compared [30]. As described in more detail later (see section \u2018Seasonal distribution of respiratory viruses\u2019), it is clear that the degree of association with respiratory symptoms for individual viruses is variable, where for example, IFA and RSV are more firmly associated with clinical symptoms than many other viruses, suggesting that even low IFA and RSV RNA levels may be of clinical relevance. Sometimes, antigen detection methods, above all direct immunofluorescence techniques (DFA), are considered to be superior to molecular methods because the latter are claimed to be too sensitive [5]. According to this view, highly sensitive molecular methods in general may detect not only higher quantities of viruses that represent a true etiological agent, but also lower, irrelevant, quantities of passenger viruses. However, it appears unlikely that the detection sensitivity of DFA by definition would be able to exactly pinpoint the clinically significant level for each of the 15 or more respiratory agents in all types of patients. By contrast, by virtue of its high detection sensitivity, a quantitative molecular method may be standardized, based on clinical studies, to define individually clinically relevant cutoff levels for adequate laboratory diagnosis, adapted to cope with most of the many combinations of individual agents and different clinical situations induced. However, more clinical studies are required in order to explore the full diagnostic capacity of multiplex quantitative assays. In conclusion, quantitative molecular methods have a great potential to identify a causative viral agent in most cases, provided that sampling from nasopharynx and/or oropharynx is performed early in the course of the disease, when the virus concentration in these compartments is high [11].",

The advent of multiplex molecular tests, expanding the diagnostic arsenal of assays with the capacity to detect 15\u201320 different viral agents simultaneously with excellent detection sensitivities, has not only significantly increased the rate of virus detection, but also improved our understanding of the etiology of RTIs. Two important lessons have been learned. First, viruses previously believed to cause exclusively mild upper RTIs, including HRV and HCoV, may be associated with severe disease, affecting the lower respiratory tract [46\u201348]. Second, it is more challenging than previously anticipated to make an etiologic diagnosis judging from the clinical presentation [49\u201351]. This knowledge combined with the continuously decreasing cost per analysis of molecular tests strongly supports increased testing of specimens from patients with respiratory symptoms against a large panel of respiratory viral agents and, in addition, bacteria giving rise to atypical respiratory symptoms, such as C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae.",

Furthermore, if hospitalization and the cost of other healthcare-related procedures is considered, a molecular method is the most cost-efficient modality for laboratory diagnosis of respiratory infections, even if a commercial assay was used [52]. Recent data suggest that access to multiplex molecular tests with the capacity to identify 15 respiratory agents may substantially reduce the use of antibiotics [53], but there are also data suggesting that such antibiotic cost reductions based on intensified molecular diagnostics are not easily achieved [54].",

RSV exists as two subgroups A and B; RSV subgroup A was previously believed to give rise to more severe symptoms [57]. However, this has not been confirmed in more recent studies [58,59]. The relative prevalence of RSV subgroup A and B changes from year to year and may also vary in a geographical manner [58\u201360]. HMPV infects all ages and greatly resembles the clinical presentation of RSV, with symptoms ranging from milder upper RTI symptoms to bronchiolitis and pneumonia [45,56,61].

Taxonomically PIVs form two genera within subfamily Paramyxovirinae, in the Paramyxoviridae family \u2013 that is Rubulavirus (PIV2 and PIV4a/PIV4b) and Respirovirus (PIV1 and PIV3) [69].",

IFA is divided into discrete subtypes, designated according to the identity of the hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) envelope glycoprotein genes. Seasonal human influenza viruses during the last 100 years include three subtypes: H1N1, H2N2 and H3N2. A new H1N1 variant transferred from swine to humans was responsible for a pandemic outbreak during 2009 [71]. Cross-species transfers of IFA (above all H5N1) from birds to humans have resulted in severe outbreaks, preferentially in Asia [72], but the ability of bona fide avian viruses (H4\u2013H16) to spread between humans appears to be limited, owing to different tissue tropisms of human and avian IFA viruses [73,74]. The classical respiratory symptoms of influenza are cough, sore throat, rhinorrea and nasal congestion, combined with systemic symptoms, such as fever, headache, myalgia and malaise [45,46]. In contrast to IFA, IFB only gives rise to local outbreaks. IFC is rare and associated with mild disease, and is not included in the majority of molecular panels. Most molecular tests do not subtype IFA in the first run; only specimens positive for IFA are subjected to subtyping with respect to the H gene identity.",

The corresponding outbreaks of IFA in an Indian population reached their maxima in June\u2013July in 2007 and 2008, respectively, correlating positively with the rain season [77].

According to the current taxonomy, HRV no longer forms a genus of its own, but belongs to the genus Enterovirus as three species HRV-A, HRV-B and HRV-C, each one containing numerous variants, referred to as \u2018serotypes\u2019, \u2018types\u2019 and so on [89\u201392].

HRV is the most prevalent respiratory virus in children under the age of 5 years and the leading cause of hospitalization of children under the age of 2 years with wheezing [93\u201395,98,99].

HPeVs are genetically and antigenically heterogeneous and circulate in the human population worldwide, preferentially infecting infants and young children [106]. A broadly specific real-time PCR detecting all known HPeV types is now available [26]. Early retrospective studies suggested that HPeV, besides being the cause of gastrointestinal symptoms, may also be the prominent cause of respiratory symptoms [107]. Some recent studies involving molecular methods support a connection between HPeV and respiratory disease [108,109], but this conclusion is somewhat obscured by the lack of data regarding possible concomitant infections with other agents. In one larger British study where respiratory specimens were analyzed, it was found that HPeV of types 1 and 6 showed a seasonal patter, peaking in July and August, infecting mainly children below 5 years, and this was most likely not associated with the respiratory disease that brought the children to a physician [110]. It is obvious that further studies are needed to evaluate the potential relationship between HPeV infections and respiratory disease.",

Viremia seems to be an infrequent phenomenon for most other respiratory viruses described previously [121], only sporadically reported in patients with severe IFA or infants infected with RSV [122,123], but even for these two latter situations PCR testing of nasopharynx specimens appears to be adequate for laboratory diagnosis.

This is especially relevant for real-time PCR techniques whose combination of a high specificity and wide dynamic range allows the identification of even minor populations of coinfecting viruses. Multiple respiratory viruses have been detected in approximately 10% of the respiratory specimens [46], with higher rates recorded in young children and immunosuppressed patients. The significance of this finding is uncertain, but infection with multiple viruses has been associated with more severe clinical symptoms [27,110,114,132]. For example, the course of RSV bronchiolitis in infants may be aggravated by coinfection with HRV or HMPV [132]. A similar relationship has been suggested for HBoV, as well as HPeV and classical enteroviruses [110,114]. However, during the winter season when several respiratory viruses may cause parallel outbreaks, children attending daycare centers can harbor up to four different respiratory viruses simultaneously at different concentrations. Further studies are needed to reveal the clinical implications of such multiple infections, and it is likely that quantification of the relative concentrations of the agents detected by real-time PCR may prove to be useful in the assessment of their clinical significance [11,27].",

This has resulted in a new and more detailed picture of the seasonal covariations of at least a dozen of the most frequent viral respiratory agents and, not least, an improved understanding of the clinical significance of infections with multiple agents. One of the most important lessons that can be learned from the past 10 years of multiplex molecular diagnosis of respiratory viruses is that all specimens submitted for laboratory diagnosis of respiratory agents should be assayed for the full panel of respiratory viruses. First, the data accumulated clearly demonstrate that it is extremely difficult to make an etiological diagnosis based on symptoms and other clinical data. Second, viruses previously considered to induce only mild upper RTI symptoms are not seldom associated with more serious lower RTI symptoms. Third, it may be important to identify infections with two or more respiratory viruses because the clinical effects generated by one virus may be amplified by coinfection with another virus.",

Although the supply of different types of commercial molecular tests for viral RTIs are expected to increase, it is reasonable to assume that the in-house tests will be competitive, at least for the larger hospital laboratories, not only for economic reasons. One advantage of in-house tests is that whenever a new infectious agent is detected, it is easy to rapidly develop an in-house molecular test as soon as adequate sequence data are available in GenBank, whereas the development of commercial tests, robust enough to also be used in laboratories lacking necessary experience in diagnostic molecular biology, for obvious reasons is more time consuming. One previous drawback associated with in-house assays \u2013 lack of standardization \u2013 is now being overcome owing to rapid online publishing of new methods and international standardization networks between university hospital laboratories [134].

Genomic and epidemiological dynamics data for IFA suggest a sink-source model of viral ecology, postulating that new viral lineages are seeded from a tropically situated influenza reservoir to the population (sink) in the temperate regions [137]. One important future use of the new molecular methods may be as epidemiological tools to reveal the nature and location of persistent sources of other seasonal respiratory viruses and the routes by which they reach their temperate sink populations. At present, we do not know whether the specific climatology or the high population density of the tropical regions constitute the basis for the IFA source function of this region. Neither do we know whether different seasonal viruses of the temperate regions arise from the same source regions, nor if, for example, RSV and PIV outbreaks originate from different, unique geographical source locations. In addition, we currently know very little about how seasonal outbreaks are influenced by large-scale factors, such as ecological conditions, possible interference between different respiratory viruses in the human population and, not least, natural disasters. There are reasons to believe that the global use of molecular PCR methods for laboratory diagnosis of viral RTIs in parallel with NGS methods for sequencing of selected clinical specimens will be helpful in a 5-year perspective to define not only important respiratory virus sources with respect to the geographical location and the human populations involved, but also the epidemiological mechanisms by which respiratory outbreaks are generated and terminated in the population of temperate regions.",
