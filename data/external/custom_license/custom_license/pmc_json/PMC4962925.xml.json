This accounts for instances where combining villages might be problematic (e.g., villages in high and low risk areas) and also adjusts for the fact that multiple within-study results are likely to be correlated and should not be entered as independent studies in a meta-analysis, nor should they be combined to give a study average, as this ignores the potentially valuable between-result heterogeneity (eg. villages in high and low and high risk areas). Standard meta-analysis software cannot model repeated results from the same study and is therefore likely to give a less accurate estimate. The Bayesian meta-analysis also easily copes with zero cells, for example, no positive results from a control village, which was not uncommon in studies of small sample sizes.

All evidence on control interventions looked at effectiveness of canine vaccination, administered either through oral baits50 or by direct injection.50, 54, 67, 81 The study by Kamoltham et al.54 mentions canine sterilisation, but no data is presented on the latter. Although some interventions included a health education/awareness component,54, 67, 68 this was only evaluated by Robinson et al. The study by Windiyaningsih et al.81 does present data on culling of the dog population in an outbreak setting, although data for all provinces where the intervention was carried out was not recorded. Overall, the available evidence is low quality, and outbreak data is based predominantly on the analysis of a case series using historical controls. The outcome measure used in three studies is the proportion of dogs vaccinated.50, 67, 81 Kamoltham et al.54 and Windiyaningsih et al.81 also report on human disease indicators such as the number of cases of human rabies. In both studies, attempts to evaluate the impact of the intervention on the numbers of rabies exposures in humans are confounded by concurrent expansion of a cheaper and safer rabies treatment regimen. In the Thai study54, despite the aggressive vaccination campaign from 1996 \u2013 2001, the number of exposures to suspected and proven rabid animals continued to increase from 1992 \u2013 2000. Inability to enforce movement restrictions of animals, culling of diseased animals and incomplete vaccination coverage contributed to failure to control the outbreak on Flores Island.81",

Other reasons for refusing to participate included the owner not wanting to cause injury to the dog from vaccination. Estrada et al.50 also reported a reluctance of owners to have dogs repeatedly bled. The study may also have been compromised as a result of dog owners demanding financial compensation for dogs handed over for rabies diagnosis. Reluctance by members of the public to kill dogs in the Flores Island outbreak81 perpetuated the outbreak, as some owners moved their dogs to rabies-free districts or sold them at markets to avoid killing them. The practice of fishermen travelling with their dogs and subsequently visiting other islands also aided the spread of outbreak.",

Overall, the available evidence is of low methodological quality, and outbreak data is based predominantly on the analysis of a case series using historical controls. The outcome measure used was the proportion of dogs vaccinated in three studies. In one study, attempts to evaluate the impact of the intervention on the number of rabies exposures in humans are confounded by concurrent expansion of the rabies treatment regimen. A number of studies highlighted the importance of pre-campaign education and advertisements to impact on the success of the program, as well as coordination of local services and higher-level support to conduct a successful campaign.",

There is no information on the cost of the interventions.

Five studies48, 52, 70, 71, 77 evaluated environmental control strategies (including use of screens, covering of water containers, and community clean up to reduce larval breeding sites), the majority included an educational component. A further eleven studies44, 49, 55\u201359, 61, 62, 66, 72 included environmental control activities alongside chemical or biological control interventions. Seven studies55\u201358, 61, 62, 65 looked at biological vector control strategies (including introduction of either copepods or other biological control agents to water containers); in all studies this was in combination with dengue education and environmental control activities. Eleven studies38, 44, 47, 49, 53, 59, 66, 69, 72, 76, 79 looked at chemical vector control strategies (including larvicide/insecticide distribution and fogging), either in isolation or occasionally combined with either dengue education or environmental control activities.",

Poor record keeping impacted on assessment of the system's timeliness. No other qualities of the system were evaluated (representativeness, positive predictive value). The studies on active surveillance systems evaluated systems based on community reporting38, 39 and a sentinel GP surveillance pilot to detect suspected dengue cases.41 The study by Osaka et al.38 was inconclusive, as it seemed to be set up to look at the impact of concurrent interventions (done in conjunction with active surveillance) rather than improved surveillance, as both the intervention and control group received the active surveillance component. No information was provided on the increased cost of active surveillance. Oum et al.39 used syndromic surveillance definitions to conduct community-based surveillance on a number of diseases, including \u2018haemorrhagic fever\u2019 (HF). Their evaluation showed value in their approach, as only 33% of cases of HF had contacted a health facility, with 67% of them being treated at home, although they do not estimate a predictive value positive (PPV) for their definition of HF. The majority of deaths (80%) also occurred at home. The surveillance system also detected two clusters of HF reported in one commune. Other system attributes were not evaluated. The sentinel GP pilot41 compared a sensitive versus more specific case definition of suspected dengue cases presenting to two clinics. The more specific case definition uses diagnostic criteria for DHF outlined by the WHO, so it is not surprising that a higher proportion of patients were positive by serology (33% vs 7%) and virus isolation (50% vs 15%) using the latter case definition.",

The other three studies looked at the effectiveness of environmental cleanup campaigns in combination with dengue education and awareness activities.48, 70, 71 Crabtree et al. used a strategy based in schools and the general community with use of mass media and targeted activities to promote community awareness.48 They found a 60% reduction in the number of households in the intervention area positive for Aedes aegypti, however, the vector was not present in the control area at baseline, which effectively meant that there was no control group. The number of households positive for Aedes aegypti increased toward the end of the study period. Suroso et al. used a predominantly school based strategy to promote clean up amongst the wider community.70 They found a 50% reduction in larval indices in households, but only a 35% reduction in households with school children and school buildings. They concluded the program had been less successful amongst school children. Suwanbamrung et al. conducted their study in three semi-urban communities and used targeted community education activities to promote clean up campaigns.71 They showed a 50% reduction in household index and an 80% reduction in container index in the village with high levels of community engagement and dengue control capacity. In the two villages where capacity and engagement were lower they demonstrated only a 15% reduction in these larval indices.

This group includes four original trials conducted in different communes55, 56, 61, 62 and a follow up study looking at the cost and sustainability of the interventions up to nine years post-intervention.57 The intervention was very comprehensive including use of copepods, environmental cleanup campaigns, the use of microcredit schemes to encourage development of recycling business, and broad community education activities and awareness campaigns. In all four original studies the intervention achieved a reduction in vector indices, reducing larval populations by over 97% 12 months post introduction of copepods and achieving 99% reduction or elimination with the addition of community education and environmental cleanup activities. The studies also reported a reduction in dengue incidence and this was also maintained with no project communes reporting local cases of disease (only a handful of imported cases) since 2003. In contrast larval population and dengue numbers remained present in control areas with figures fluctuating with the seasonal and epidemic nature of the disease. Participants reported a 99.5% rate of willingness to participate and a 97.8% acceptance of copepods.56 The average cost per person per year of the original program was estimated at $US2, with a marginal cost of expansion of 20c.55 In the follow up study, the average cost of the program was calculated to be 61c per person per year (equivalent to a total cost of $6,134 annually) in International Dollars.57 Using a self-developed tool to measure sustainability they found that the project rated 4.42 out of 5 indicating it was highly sustainable.57 Rates of both vector indices and cases of dengue remained at zero in the original project communes over five years after the end of the original research study.57",

In the Philippines, two forms of environmental control were compared. Tyre splitting, water drum cleaning and waste management was compared to a general community clean up and awareness campaign. In Myanmar, introduction of biological agents (dragon-fly nymphs and fish) to the most productive water containers was compared to a blanket approach where all containers were targeted and chemical control (Temephos\u00a9) was used intermittently. In Thailand introduction of a biological larvicide (Bti) to the most productive containers was compared to use of chemical control (Temephos\u00a9) in productive containers, plus regular emptying of all other containers and occasional insecticide spraying. In all three countries both the targeted approach and the non-targeted approach were equally effective at reducing entomological indices (Breteau index) by 80% in Myanmar and the Philippines and 50% in Thailand. Implementation costs were reported for Myanmar and the Philippines. In Myanmar, the targeted vector control program had lower implementation costs ($4.47 per year per household covered) than the non-targeted campaign to which it was compared ($6.45 per year per household). In the Philippines, the targeted intervention had higher implementation costs compared to the non-targeted campaign ($9.32 v. $2.19 per year per household). In the Philippines high levels of acceptance of the interventions were reported. Coverage of 70% and 73.5% was achieved in the Philippines and Myanmar respectively.",

The study focuses on the use of staff electronic medical records for early detection of outbreaks of febrile illness. Although the study is conducted in medical staff at a large general hospital, it is included here as it is being used as an early detection system for outbreaks rather than solely to prevent nosocomial transmission. The study finds that as documented fever is rare in sick leave amongst staff, passive surveillance in healthcare workers would be efficient in identifying outbreaks of febrile illness. Effective markers were found to be clustering of illness, prolonged or repeated absence from work, or the incidence of abnormally high fevers. The authors conclude that such a system is practical and likely to be sensitive in this setting should appropriate indicators be chosen, but that currently the system is not specific. This may lead to many false alarms and ultimately to outbreak \u201cfatigue\u201d whereby people fail to respond to early warning signals.

All of the studies were based on retrospective analyses of the same outbreak dataset. The three studies reach the conclusion that the system was effective as it was able to reduce the time from onset of SARS symptoms to isolation from nearly one week to just over a day. They showed that a wide-net approach (i.e. pre-emptive isolation of exposed individuals using a broad definition of exposure) to surveillance and isolation of suspected cases was effective in ensuring progressively earlier isolation of probable SARS cases as the outbreak progressed. They also saw a reduction in the number of secondary infections per case. Only 0.3% of those quarantined broke quarantine. One quarter of all SARS cases had been on quarantine orders prior to diagnosis. Only 0.5% of those isolated went on to develop SARS. It is noteworthy that these interventions were evaluated within an outbreak setting and that a range of other community-focused strategies were also put into place.",

Overall the evidence is low quality and based predominantly on analysis of case series data from the 2003 outbreak.

The studies by Jost and Azhar are early reports of the establishment of the system and a three year report of results, respectively.27, 35 A comprehensive evaluation was conducted by Perry et al. in 2009 as part of the FAO Evaluation Service.42 The evaluation detailed the establishment of \u201cparticipatory disease surveillance\u201d(PDS), based on principles of participatory epidemiology, i.e. the application of participatory methods to disease surveillance. Participatory epidemiology recognizes that local people have very rich and detailed knowledge about the animals they keep and the infectious and zoonotic diseases that affect their livelihoods and endanger human health. The system focused on the detection of HPAI in the backyard poultry sector (defined by the FAO as sector 4) on a village-wide basis by veterinary surveillance officers, where it was commonly believed the majority of HPAI virus was harboured. It was later expanded to have a prevention and control component. The program was successful in training up a number of Master Trainers, who subsequently delivered training to more than 2,000 surveillance officers. In its three years of operation, it was operational in 76% (341) districts in Indonesia, 27/33 provinces, covering 25,525 villages where surveillance activities had been completed,27 1455 of these resulting in diagnosis of HPAI.

Market monitoring: samples were collected in seven provinces. Interviews were conducted in 52 villages and on 23 farms, which were subsequently classified according to their risk of having faced an HPAI outbreak. 14/70 (20%) premises were not suspected, 3/70 (4%) were classified as low probability, 18/70 (26%) were classified moderate probability, 35/70 (50%) high probability. The authors identified several constraints during the implementation of program that impacted on the success of the study \u2013 lack of motivation of provincial staff, limited capacity of the central team to compile and analyse the data generated, weak diagnostic capabilities and the reluctance of farmers to have animals sampled.

Manabe et al. acknowledged the importance of the involvement of local healthcare workers and administrators in H5N1 education and outreach, and that the main impact of the educational intervention was to increase people's trust in local health care providers.60 Waisbord et al. commented that training brought commune council people together and provided the opportunity to network and cooperate more closely in the future.80 However, it became apparent that the PDSR response alone was insufficient and unlikely to contain and eliminate the disease for a number of reasons: inability to offer compensation to encourage culling, inability by the officers to enforce movement control, inability of the farmers to buy cages and feed to restrain poultry.

Larviciding (targeting breeding sites) has been studied more than insecticiding (where adult mosquitoes are targeted), the latter has mainly been used in outbreak scenarios indicating it is unlikely to be an option for long-term control.

They can be locally produced, are low cost and have a higher level of acceptability as compared to Temephos\u00a9. They have been shown to be effective in both rural and urban areas.

These activities have been a core component of most dengue control interventions that have been evaluated and are highly successful if high levels of community involvement can be achieved.

This highlights the importance of education and communication about both dengue and the intervention prior to roll-out in the community. It was also shown that knowledge alone did not automatically translate into improved dengue control behaviours and centrally coordinated environmental cleanup or temephos distribution activities were required to reinforce use of control methods. A barrier specific to community involvement in environmental cleanup activities is a belief that these activities are a government responsibility. Conversely, establishment of these tasks as economic activities, through use of microcredit schemes for small recycling businesses, promoted engagement with this activity.

Perry et al.'s evaluation found a disproportionate focus on the backyard poultry sector 4, as farmers have considerable interaction with small-scale commercial farms (sector 3). For this reason, surveillance efforts need to cast a broader net and greater engagement of the commercial poultry sector is required. It is unfortunate that the study in Cambodia by Desvaux et al. had several methodological limitations, as it has been the only one to present information on surveillance of commercial poultry and duck farms.33 Both studies were able to classify villages according to their risk of either having faced an HPAI outbreak33 or the probability of HPAI infection,42 allowing prioritisation of control activities. Perry's report also showed that the majority of visits were scheduled or \u2018active\u2019 surveillance (87%) as opposed to passive surveillance (13%), but were more effective in detecting disease.42 Surveillance also identified sources of infection (traders, unsafe disposal of carcasses and contaminated vehicles).",

An internet rumour based surveillance system represents a potential low cost and timely form of surveillance to inform immediate public health action, but may be limited in its applicability, across the region as it depends highly on the level of engagement of local public health professionals with the chat forums and mailing lists searched, and journalists awareness of AI and quality of reporting.

Rabies control was more likely to be successful when canine vaccination was used in conjunction with other control strategies.

It is often supplemented with the use of either biological (such as copepods) or chemical (such as Temephos\u00a9) larvicidal agents. The latter is reported as being less acceptable due to problems with smell and taste.

Successful educational campaigns have not always translated into behavior modification and change.
