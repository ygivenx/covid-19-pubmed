But Tao Hung, a researcher at the Institute of Virology at the Chinese Academy of Preventative Medicine in Beijing, who is heading the Chinese investigation of the epidemic, says that his results point in another direction \u2014 a Chlamydia-like bacterium. He says he has found traces of Chlamydia in samples from organs taken from five people who died from SARS and from 30 infected patients.",
