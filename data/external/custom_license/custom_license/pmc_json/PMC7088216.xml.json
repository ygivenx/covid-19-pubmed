Many emerging viral infections causing ALRIs may not be detected until the middle of an outbreak. In 2006 spring, throughout almost every tertiary hospital in South Korea, certain patients were admitted for more than 1 month due to fatal respiratory infections and pediatricians could not determine the causal virus of the outbreak. Rapidly progressive interstitial pneumonia, subsequent pneumothorax, prolonged ventilator care with diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multiple organ failures were typical disease progression. Early molecular viral studies on possible patients could be the first key to detecting causal viruses [1, 2], so a nationwide surveillance system to control the spreading of infections was designed by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC).",

Case definitions of moderate to severe lower respiratory infections were determined according to the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended surveillance standards 2nd edition (1999). As part of the diagnosis, pneumonia, croup, bronchiolitis, and ARDS were included, which were diagnosed by the same physician through physical examination and chest X-rays. Samples were collected by nasopharyngeal aspiration with viral transport media prospectively and informed consent was obtained. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Severance Hospital. Questionnaires asked about the onset and manifestation of symptoms, admission and duration of stay, sample collection, risk factors, e.g., parents smoking, prematurity, formula feeding, gastro-esophageal reflux, neurologic deficits, cardiovascular defects, initial diagnosis, radiographic findings, blood tests, and treatments. The information was provided by the same pediatrician and was entered into an Access 2007 database (Microsoft) by a person blinded to the viral results. Immunocompromised patients, such as patients receiving chemotherapy due to various cancers, those taking immunosuppressants, patients who were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit, and patients with severe complex heart diseases, were excluded.

Other methods, such as immunochromatography, direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) staining, or enzyme immunoassays, are producing compatible results to molecular studies in RSV, influenza virus, PIV (93\u201399%), and hMPV (85\u201395%) [3, 5\u20137]. If it is suitable, a commercial rapid kit could be used first as mass screening and in negative samples, and the adoption of a reflex PCR method could be considered. And the rapid culture kit also enables the physicians to make a timely diagnosis of conventional viral infections. Adenovirus and influenza viruses were isolated well in both rapid shell viral cultures and RT-PCR/PCR methods. In our study, about 92% agreement was obtained between PCR and rapid shell viral culture. In another study of similar populations, 80% concordance was report [8]. However, recently identified viruses such as hBoV, hMPV, RV, or hCoV are known as hardly cultured viruses but well detected by multiplex PCR/RT-PCR methods. So, the mass screening of respiratory viruses (including unknown viruses) for severe respiratory infections would be more accurate and desirable with viral nucleic acid extractions from samples and subsequent identification with primers [8, 9]. When only one of each viral gene was targeted, true positive samples could be missed by this method [10]. In this study, two kinds of primers were included in the multiplex RT-PCR kits for hMPV, hCoV, and influenza virus A and B.",
