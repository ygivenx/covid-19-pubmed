NOESY and 15N\u20131H HSQC spectra (Figure 10 and Figures S3 and S4)\nacquired at 25 \u00b0C revealed 17 G and 8 U imino peaks, corresponding\nto 15 GC pairs, 6 AU pairs, and 2 GU pairs. An additional AU and GU\npair was identified in a NOESY spectrum acquired at 15 \u00b0C (Figure S5). These data are consistent with seven\nimino proton walks (Figures 9 and 10 and Figures S3\u2013S5). The imino proton chemical shift data from this\nwork (Table S14) agree well with those\nreported by Ziegeler et al.10 Imino proton\nresonances not identified in this work that Ziegeler et al.10 assigned only in fragments of the full-length\nconstruct are for G1, G48, and U109. These resonances were likely\ndifficult to assign in the full-length construct because they exchange\nwith solvent protons in solvent-accessible environments: G1 and U109\nare located at the end of helices, and G48 is in a GA pair. Imino\nproton resonances that Ziegeler et al.10 did not assign in the full-length construct but were identified\nin this work are for G19, G30, G44, G49, G51, U79, U80, and G104 (Table S14). On the basis of the secondary structure\nshown in Figure 9,\nP2 and P4 were missing expected imino signals and the two pairs assigned\nto P4 could be observed only at a reduced temperature (15 \u00b0C)\nand a reduced mixing time (60 ms). These observations suggest that\nP2 and P4 may be unstable and/or\ndynamic. Constraints used for HAR1 are listed in Table 3.",
