            "text": "Cancer and the immune system are intimately related. Much of the bulk of tumors is comprised of stromal leukocytes with immune functions, which serve to both promote and inhibit tumor growth, invasion and metastasis. The T lymphocytes of the adaptive immune system are essential for tumor immunity, and these T cells are generated by cross-priming against tumor associated antigens. Dendritic cells (DCs) are essential in this process, serving as the cellular link between innate and adaptive immunity. As a prerequisite for priming of adaptive immune responses, DCs must take up tumor antigens, process them and present them in the context of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). DCs also serve as sensors of innate activation signals from cancer that are necessary for their activation and effective priming of cancer specific T cells. Here we discuss the role of DCs in the sensing of cancer and in priming the adaptive response against tumors. Furthermore, we present the essential role of the Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) signaling pathway in producing type I interferons (IFNs) that are essential in this process.",

Mouse cDC1s express high levels of CD11c, MHCII, CD8\u03b1, CD24, and often XCR1, CD141, Clec9a, DEC-205 and CD103 and require transcription factors IRF8, Id2 and Batf3 for their development. They generally express mRNA for most Toll Like Receptors (TLRs) except TLR5 and TLR7 and are characterized by high TLR3 expression (Edwards et al., 2003). Human cDC1 also express CD11c, HLA-DR, XCR1, CD141, Clec9a, DEC-205 and TLR3, and Batf3 has been implied in human cDC1 development (Poulin et al., 2010; Poulin et al., 2012), while IRF8 might affect both cDC1 and cDC2 development (Hambleton et al., 2011; Salem et al., 2014). Like mouse cDC1, human cDC1 have the greatest capacity for cross-presentation within the human DC populations (Poulin et al., 2010; Crozat et al., 2010; Jongbloed et al., 2010).",

            "text": "Three main DC populations have been described in the skin (Merad et al., 2013; Haniffa et al., 2015; Kashem et al., 2017). Mouse and human Langerhans cells (LCs) reside in the epidermis and share several markers (CD11c, MHCII/HLA-DR, CD11b, CD172a, langerin, EpCAM, and E-Cadherin). Mouse LCs further express CD205, while human LCs express CD1a and CD1c. Studies in mice indicate that although LCs share many characteristics with cDC, they are resistant to ionizing radiation and self-renew in situ. LCs have been shown to cross-present cell-associated antigens in vitro, but their capacity to do so in vivo has not been established (Igyarto and Kaplan, 2013). The two other principal mouse skin DC subsets are cDC1-like CD103+CD11bloLangerin+ DCs and cDC2-like CD103\u2212CD11bhiLangerin\u2212 DCs, which reside in the dermis. The CD103+ dermal DCs have the capacity for cross-presentation of cell-associated and particulate antigens (Henri et al., 2010; Romani et al., 2010; Bedoui et al., 2009). In humans, BDCA-1 expression is found on most of the dermal DCs with the majority of cells co-expressing CD11c and CD1a. Interestingly, similarly to mice, the cDC1-like BDCA-3+ dermal DCs demonstrate superior cross-presentation of soluble antigens as compared with other DC populations (Haniffa et al., 2012).",

A smaller, less studied CD103\u2212XCR1\u2212CD11b+/CD172a+ population can also be found in both mouse and humans, but its function is poorly understood (Bekiaris et al., 2014). cDC1 and cDC2 like cells are also found in the lung, with CD103+langerin+XCR1+Clec9a+ DC displaying potent capacity for cross-presentation compared to their cDC2\u2212 like CD11b+CD172+ counterparts. CD103+/CD141+ and CD11b/CD172+ DC populations have been identified in both human and murine kidney and liver, but there is currently limited information on their functional properties (Rogers et al., 2014; Rahman and Aloman, 2013).

Inflammatory moDCs have been found in the skin of patients with atopic dermatitis (inflammatory dendritic epithelial cells (IDEC)), psoriasis (TNF and iNOS producing, TiP DCs), and synovial fluid of arthritis patients (Wollenberg et al., 1996; Segura and Amigorena, 2013).

            "text": "Most of these DC subsets have been found in tumors where they play a major role in cancer immune-surveillance by coordinating adaptive immunity against tumor antigens. The relative composition and functionality of TIDCs is strongly dictated by the tumor microenvironment, and can be highly dynamic, depending on factors such as tumor growth rate, vascularization and hypoxia, accumulation of other leukocytes, and cytokines and other soluble factors secreted by neoplastic cells. The frequency of TIDCs correlates with favorable prognosis and is inversely correlated with tumor pathologic stage in a variety of cancers (Karthaus et al., 2012; Ladanyi et al., 2007; Reichert et al., 2001). Due to their role in initiating anti-tumor immunity, there is a negative selective pressure hampering the accumulation of DCs by tumor-secreted mediators that inhibit dendropoiesis, promote DC apoptosis, and accelerate DC turnover (Esche et al., 1999; Pirtskhalaishvili et al., 2000; Peguet-Navarro et al., 2003; Kiertscher et al., 2000). Moreover, the tumor and its microenvironment actively exploit various mechanisms to suppress proinflammatory functions of infiltrating DCs and even induce DCs to suppress immune responses, and promote immune tolerance, tumor vascularization, and metastases (Ma et al., 2012; Ma et al., 2013; Tran Janco et al., 2015; Chaput et al., 2008).",

            "text": "Specific subsets of DCs have been shown to be more capable to cross-present cell-associated antigens than other populations. While most DC populations can cross-present materials under targeted experimental conditions, optimal presentation of (tumor) cell-associated antigens seems to be limited to a few populations of cDC1s (Faure et al., 2009; Nierkens et al., 2013; Thacker and Janssen, 2012). Several mechanisms have been uncovered that explain the improved capacity for cross-presentation of cell-associated antigens by these cDC1s. These include increased capacity to take up cell-associated materials, alterations in trafficking and acidification of endocytosed materials, and alterations in expression of components of the antigen processing machinery or its intracellular trafficking. DCs are able to recognize and endocytose dying cells by means of receptors that discriminate between \u201cdon\u2019t eat me\u201d signals provided by healthy cells (including CD47 that is recognized by CD172 and CD31), \u201cfind-me\u201d and \u201ceat-me\u201d signals provided by specific entities on dead and dying cells (reviewed in (Medina and Ravichandran, 2016; Elliott and Ravichandran, 2016; Bratton and Henson, 2008; Liu et al., 2015)). The \u201cfind-me\u201d signals have been suggested to include ATP, uridine 5\u2019triphosphate (UTP), sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), lysophosphatidyl choline, and fractaline/CX3CL1. Depending on the manner of cell death, the dying cells will expose \u201ceat-me\u201d signals on a continuum of dynamic and distinct cellular changes. Phosphatidyl serine (PtdSer), an early \u201ceat-me\u201d signal, can be bound directly by receptors such as TIM-1, TIM-3, TIM-4 and BAI or indirectly, using bridging molecules MFGE8, Gas6, protein S. Additional \u201ceat-me\u201d signals have been shown to result from changes in expression of ICAM-3, Cq1, oxidized lipids and alterations in glycosylation patterns. In the last decade, several new receptors and pathways that promote internalization of dying cells have been identified and it has become clear that the expression of these receptors is associated with distinct DC populations. Specifically, expression of DEC205, Clec9a and Axl/Lrp1/RANBP9 by cDC1 has been linked to the uptake of dead and dying cells (Shrimpton et al., 2009; Sancho et al., 2009; Ramirez-Ortiz et al., 2013; Zelenay et al., 2012; Subramanian et al., 2014). Intriguingly, use of specific internalizing receptors has been shown to affect subsequent endosomal trafficking, with receptors that promote uptake of smaller particles associated with a slower endosomal acidification rate. The delayed endosomal acidification would reduce proteolytic degradation and preserve antigenic structures, thereby providing a longer time-span where antigens can escape into the cytosol for processing (Compeer et al., 2012; Thacker and Janssen, 2012; Ackerman and Cresswell, 2004; Basha et al., 2008). cDC1 already display an increased propensity for delayed endosomal/lysosomal fusion compared to other DC populations, and one can easily envision that different combinations of DC populations and endocytic receptor usage will greatly affect the efficacy of a specific DCs in their capacity to cross-present cell-associated antigens in the context of MHCI.",

While initial studies suggested that STING may sense DNA structures directly, it is now widely accepted that other cytosolic DNA binding molecules upstream of STING are required for the activation of the pathway. The cyclic-GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) is considered the predominant DNA sensor in this pathway. Upon binding to DNA in the cytosol, cGAS catalyzes the synthesis of cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) from guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) (Ablasser et al., 2013; Civril et al., 2013). cGAMP functions as a second messenger that binds to and activates STING, resulting in its trafficking from the ER to the Golgi and on to perinuclear endosomes where it mediates subsequent signaling via phosphorylation of tank-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and IRF3, which induces transcription of type I IFNs and other inflammatory genes (Fig. 1).",

DAMPs encompass cellular components and factors that are either present before death and released by dying cells or generated as a result of cellular stress. Examples include ATP which may engage the NOD/NLRP3 inflammasome, HMGB1 which has been suggested to signal through TLR4, filamentous actin which is recognized by CLEC9a, as well as heat shock proteins and uric acid (Zhang et al., 2012). Normally intracellular and out of the reach of DCs under physiological conditions, these DAMPs serve as a danger signal when released into the extracellular milieu by stressed or dying cancer cells. When DAMPs are accessible to DCs, their presence signifies the loss of integrity of the cell membrane, suggestive of tissue damage caused by noxious origins such as infection, mechanical injury, or hypoxia. In a cancer vaccination animal model, TLR4 and its downstream signaling adaptor MyD88 have been implicated in the immune response to cancers induced by radiation and certain chemotherapies, however in other models TLR4/MyD88 was not found to be necessary or sufficient for the development of an immune response to cancers.",

Fuertes et al. discovered spontaneous antitumor CD8+ T cell responses were defective in mice lacking either IFNAR or STAT1, a transcription factor immediately downstream of IFN signaling (Fuertes et al., 2011).

In human patients with metastatic melanoma, metastatic lesions infiltrated with T cells are characterized by an IFN gene signature (Fuertes et al., 2011; Harlin et al., 2009). This inflamed phenotype is associated both with inhibitory factors that suppress T cell function and with response to immunotherapy, including checkpoint inhibitors targeting CTLA-4 and PD-1 (Ji et al., 2012; Topalian et al., 2012). A type I IFN gene signature in the primary tumor at diagnosis has also been found to be associated with improved prognosis and response to anthracycline chemotherapy in women with breast cancer (Sistigu et al., 2014). These associations are supported by studies in murine models, demonstrating that breast cancer is more likely to metastasize to bone when the IRF7 pathway is blocked (Bidwell et al., 2012). This pattern also holds in studies of cancer vaccines, where a similar gene signature has been found to correlate with improved clinical responses. In aggregate, these findings support the relevance of type I IFN responses in human patients, and in fact motivated much of the work highlighting the importance of IFN in the animal models (Ulloa-Montoya et al., 2013).",

The seminal experiments performed by Woo, et al. demonstrated that STING and IRF3 deficient mice do not develop spontaneous CD8+ T cell responses against melanoma expressing a model antigen. In contrast, MyD88 knockout mice have no defect in spontaneous cross-priming of tumor specific T cells (Woo et al., 2014). STING was also required for spontaneous rejection of an immunogenic sarcoma, and the authors nicely explore the mechanism, showing that the STING pathway is activated in host DCs as a result of sensing tumor derived DNA (Woo et al., 2014; Woo et al., 2015). These findings have been extended to other tumor models, such as colitis induced cancer, in which STING deficient mice have increased susceptibility to colon cancer oncogenesis in response to inflammation (Zhu et al., 2014; Ahn et al., 2015). In a mouse model that spontaneously develops intracranial glioma, a loss of function mutation in STING results in reduced production of type I IFN by myeloid cells with impairment of tumor control by the immune system (Ohkuri et al., 2014). DNA damage is the likely stimulus for activating STING and transcription of type I IFN, as a breast cancer model defective in DNA damage repair is found to have accumulation of DNA in the cytosol and activation of an IFN response in a STING dependent manner (Parkes et al., 2017). These tumors with impaired DNA damage repair are grown in mice, they develop a T cell infiltrate compared with the wild type breast cancer tumors.",

Cytotoxicity through damage of genomic DNA is thought to be the principal mechanism for the effects of radiotherapy, but more recently evidence has emerged that implicates the immune system in tumor control mediated by radiation (Apetoh et al., 2007; Burnette and Weichselbaum, 2013; Burnette et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2009). Furthermore, focal irradiation of tumors activates DCs and induces cross-priming of tumor specific T cells that mediate systemic anti-tumor immunity (Demaria et al., 2004; Gupta et al., 2012; Lim et al., 2014; Lugade et al., 2005; Weichselbaum et al., 2017). This radiation induced anti-tumor immune response is dependent on STING and its upstream mediator cGAS (Deng et al., 2014a). Tumors in mice lacking these genes are not controlled by an otherwise effective dose of radiation, their DCs do not produce type I IFN in response to radiation, and there is a defect in cross-priming of tumor specific CD8+ T cells after radiotherapy.",

STING can also modify the tumor microenvironment to become more tolerogenic promoting tumor progression and metastasis through induction of IDO which promotes Treg function and immune tolerance of tumors by cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 (Lemos et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2013). At this point it is not clear why or under which circumstances STING and type I IFN promotes or suppresses anti-tumor immunity, although chronic inflammation is a well accepted stimulus of oncogenesis, and one can speculate that the complex tumor micro-environment with its various regulatory components such as Tregs, myeloid derived suppressor cells, and macrophages may help determine the effects of IFN stimulation.",

            "text": "In recent years, pharmacologic agents that activation the STING pathway have been used to mimic and augment the role of STING mediated production of type I IFN in anti-tumor immunity. Administration of STING ligands (c-di-GMP, DMXAA, cGAMP, CDN) significantly improve anti-tumor responses and animal survival in a diverse array of mouse models of solid and blood borne cancers (Deng et al., 2014a; Baird et al., 2016; Chandra et al., 2014; Corrales et al., 2015; Curran et al., 2016). DMXAA is a STING agonist with a multi-faceted effect on the tumor microenvironment, and treatment of B16 melanoma with DMXAA augments tumor-specific CD8+ T cell responses which effectively immunize and protect mice against future tumor challenge (Corrales et al., 2015). Similar results are seen in mouse models of prostate and breast cancer as well as sarcoma (Baguley and Ching, 1997). In light of these promising results from the animal models, DMXAA was tested in a clinical trial of patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Unfortunately, DMXAA does not bind to human STING and thus was unable to activate this pathway, resulting in a negative trial (Lara et al., 2011; Gao et al., 2013). Another STING agonist, the cyclic diguanylate nucleotide (CDN) c-di-GMP, is effective in the treatment of 4T1 mammary carcinoma. A synthetic CDN agonist MLRR-S2 CDA has high affinity for human and murine STING and stimulates type I IFN production in human PBMCs (Corrales et al., 2015). This agent induces immune mediated tumor rejection of melanoma, breast and colon carcinoma in mice (Corrales et al., 2015). CDN based STING agonists have also been used in conjunction with the GVACs cancer vaccine along with a PD1 antagonist, which resulted in an additive effect on tumor immunity (Fu et al., 2015). This opens new avenues for additional novel therapies including CD47 (\u201cdon\u2019t eat me\u201d signal) blockade which has been shown to be critically dependent on the IFN/STING pathway (Liu et al., 2015).",

            "text": "As described above, radiotherapy induces DNA damage that is sensed by TIDCs through the STING pathway, and there are currently many pre-clinical and several clinical studies utilizing radiation to stimulate anti-tumor immunity. Since radiotherapy alone rarely induces an anti-tumor immune response that results in systemic control of metastatic disease, the therapeutic effects of radiation on the innate and adaptive immune system have been largely explored in combination with other immunotherapy modalities. The initial studies demonstrating the synergistic effect of radiation combined with immune modulators were performed by Demaria and Formenti. Their group observed improved tumor control within the irradiated field and objective responses in distant sites of disease using FLT3 ligand or antibody antagonists to the CTLA-4 checkpoint receptor in breast cancer and colon cancer models (Demaria et al., 2004; Demaria et al., 2005a; Dewan et al., 2009; Demaria et al., 2005b). Similar findings in other animal models combining radiation with PD-1 inhibitors, DC vaccines, and other immune modulators have been observed, and further mechanistic studies have been performed by multiple groups (Deng et al., 2014b; Filatenkov et al., 2015; Sharabi et al., 2015a; Sharabi et al., 2015b; Vatner et al., 2014; Yoshimoto et al., 2014). One study even combined radiation therapy with a pharmacological STING agonist and found improved tumor control and anti-tumor immunity, suggesting that radiation is providing a unique ingredient to the production of anti-tumor immunity above and beyond STING activation (Baird et al., 2016).",

Preliminary results appear promising, but mature results from these trials are pending (Golden et al., 2015).",

This is an active question in the field, however there are few preclinical studies and even fewer clinical trials comparing different doses and fractionation treatment schedules. Some of the original studies by the Demaria group explored dose and fractionation, finding that 24 Gy delivered in three fractions of 8 Gy resulted in more robust systemic tumor control compared with 30 Gy in five fractions or a single fraction of 20 Gy (Dewan et al., 2009). A recent study by this group explored the mechanistic underpinnings of why a single larger fraction of 20 Gy of radiation is not as effective as three fractions of 8 Gy, and found that both treatments resulted in transport of dsDNA to the cytosol of tumor cells where it was sensed by cGAS, which activated STING and type I IFN transcription (Vanpouille-Box et al., 2017). However, the larger dose of radiation induced the three prime exonuclease 1 (TREX1), which degraded the cytosolic DNA, limiting STING activation and the IFN response. Studies by other groups comparing single fraction treatment with fractionated treatment have shown conflicting results, however most of these utilized single fraction treatment doses < 20 Gy, the apparent threshold for activation of TREX1.",

However, it was not until recent years with the success of cancer immunotherapy applied to patient care that cancer immunity has received widespread acceptance. How the immune system is alerted to the presence of cancer has been one of the central questions in cancer immunology. DCs are the link between the innate and adaptive immune systems, only priming T cell responses against cellular antigens in the context of an inflammatory signal. There has been some debate regarding the nature of this inflammatory signal in the response to tumors, but recent evidence summarized in this review support the hypothesis that damaged DNA released by cancer cells is the stimulus for generating tumor immunity. This DNA gains access to the cytoplasm of DCs where it is recognized by cGAS which triggers STING and production of the type I IFNs necessary for effective cross-priming of CD8+ T cells against tumor antigens.",

Cancer has historically been viewed as pathogenic process separate from the host organism. Even the concept of \u201ctumor\u201d and \u201chost\u201d suggests an otherness to cancer. This thinking naturally led to a search for the danger signals produced in response to cancer, and broadened our understanding of innate immunity as a means to detect self from non-self through PAMPs into a more generalized view as a means of detecting danger from the absence of danger through DAMPs. The fact that DCs are sensing damaged DNA rather than a DAMP associated with lytic cell death places the immune response to cancer more in the realm of assaults on the integrity of the genome rather than an exogenous pathogen.",

One such question relates to how tumor DNA taken up by DCs gains access to the DC cytosol. It may be more than coincidence that DC populations that are efficient in cross-presentation and that exhibit delayed endosomal acidification seem to be explicitly implicated in the STING dependent induction of type I IFN. One can envision a mechanism for DNA escape from endosomal compartments analogous to the manner by which endocytosed proteins escape into the cytosol where they are processed into peptides for presentation on MHCI. Another unanswered question relates to the nature of the direct upstream signaling molecules that bind cytosolic DNA and engage STING, as these could be targeted for therapeutic benefit. It is also intriguing how STING activation promotes anti-tumor immunity in some models, while in others it suppresses the immune response to the tumor, promoting tolerance.",
