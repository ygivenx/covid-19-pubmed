Only rarely are febrile seizures a symptom of a central nervous system infection (e. g., meningitis). However, a site of infection needs to be confirmed or excluded during the initial diagnostic work-up so as to adjust further treatment [2]. Some issues and controversies surrounding febrile seizures have not been fully resolved including the need for cohortation to prevent nosocomial transmission and the use of antibiotics. Timely differentiation between bacterial and viral etiologies may reduce the unnecessary use of antibiotics. Recently, the use of multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis for the detection of a number of common viruses has been introduced into clinical practice [8\u201310]. In our hospital, respiratory multiplex PCR analysis has been routinely used in clinical practice for children with upper and lower respiratory infections since 2010.",

            "text": "Febrile seizures in children are typically related to common infections caused by either bacterial or viral pathogens. However, the specific reason for an individual event remains hidden in the majority of cases as no extended microbiological or virological testing is routinely performed. To the best of our knowledge, our study is unique in assessing the role of viral multiplex PCR analysis as part of the routine management of young children with febrile seizures [14]. In our large study cohort of 200 children with febrile seizures, we were able to demonstrate a significant increase in the number of detected respiratory viruses, thus providing us with important insights into the etiology of the underlying infectious disease. Of note, we also detected an increase in the number of positive bacterial findings and viral and bacterial co-infections, and in parallel an increase in the use of antibiotics. This finding is somewhat surprising since there were no overt institutional changes in clinical practice with regard to microbiology testing for bacterial infections. However, the noted increase in the use of diagnostics and antibiotic treatment may be caused by children with more serious infections, as more uncomplicated cases (simple febrile seizure) are treated with minimal interventions possibly in an out-patient setting [15]. Also, it is important to note that a substantive number of patients were started on antibiotics prior to hospital admission. All the same, given the retrospective nature of our audit, the precise underlying mechanisms remain somewhat speculative. Of note, recent clinical data indicate that molecular techniques including multiplex PCR analysis have an overall higher performance regarding sensitivity and specificity when compared with standard conventional methods (immunofluorescence and viral culture) [14].",

Timely detection of the underlying culprit by multiplex PCR analysis may have the potential to assist in the decision to isolate or cohort patients in order to prevent nosocomial transmission. In addition, one would suspect a contribution toward avoiding unnecessary antibiotics in febrile children. Unfortunately, in our study population the use of routine multiplex PCR analysis did not translate into a reduction in the use of antibiotics. In line with our findings, so far no benefit has been found for this diagnostic technique in children without underlying risk factors. Wishaupt et al. recently investigated the role of multiplex PCR testing in 298 children (intervention group) admitted to hospital with respiratory infections. Their analysis revealed that RT-PCR testing displays a high yield of viral diagnoses, but rapid communication of these results to the attending physicians does not lead to decreases in hospital admissions, shorter hospital stays, or less antibiotic use [16]. The time lag in our cohort was approximately 24 h.",

So far, there are no algorithms for such an approach that have been validated in clinical practice. This underlines the necessity of implementing antibiotic stewardship initiatives in addition to the use of more sensitive diagnostic tools for detecting vital infections [17]. In terms of treatment, the use of multiplex PCR analysis has been recommended especially in the first months of life, in children with risk factors for influenza, and in immunosuppressed patients, since clinical consequences such as targeted treatment with antivirals are more likely to be concluded from the results in such patients [10].",

When comparing historical groups in a retrospective study, no definite recommendations with regard to the role and limitations of microbial testing can be made. In general, problems with historical controls include potential changes in diagnostic criteria, differences in the population with the affected disease, differences in concomitant standards of care, differences in performing assessments that measure the endpoint, and importantly missing data in historical records as well as other data quality problems. Nevertheless, our retrospective audit demonstrates the feasibility of multiplex PCR analysis in detecting specific viruses in a large cohort of young children (n = 200) with febrile seizures that were most commonly associated with respiratory infections. However, the precise role and the potential and possible limitations of multiplex PCR analysis in routine clinical practice remain to be elucidated and warrant further rigorous clinical trials. Potential benefits related to its use may include easier cohortation and reduced use of antibiotics.",
