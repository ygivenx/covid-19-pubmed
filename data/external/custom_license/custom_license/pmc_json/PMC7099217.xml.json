The basis for limiting testing to a small number of samples from an outbreak is derived from studies of norovirus outbreak detection.[35,36] However, early specimen collection is important if the sensitivity of this approach is to be exploited.

In some circumstances, conventional methods can be preferable to molecular methods, for a range of biologic and technical reasons.[19] For example, the culture of viruses permits full identification and characterization of any virus that can be isolated, including phenotypic confirmation of antiviral susceptibilities. Moreover, culture can often detect novel strains or emerging viruses. Conversely, molecular methods are often more sensitive but are limited to the intended target virus, requiring knowledge of the genome sequence to provide a complete template from which molecular assays can be developed rapidly. Thus, failure to detect any of the targets in a molecular assay does not rule out the absence of a virus that is not included in the assay. This is countered in practice by the ability to rapidly design and detect new viruses, using degenerate primers.[28]",

Laboratories that use nucleic acid amplification technologies must take precautions to prevent false positive results that might arise from contamination of specimens by amplification products of previously analyzed specimens. To avoid contamination, the workflow must be strictly unidirectional with no movement of specimens or materials in the reverse direction. Ideally, procedures should be carried out in four physically separated rooms for dedicated tasks of reagent preparation, specimen preparation, reaction set-up, and post-amplification analysis.[39] Most importantly, the post-amplification room should have 100% exhaust air with negative pressure relative to that in all other laboratories. The reagent preparation room should have 100% supply air with positive pressure relative to that in all other laboratories. Each laboratory should have dedicated equipment, supplies, and lab coats. Use of sticky mats, dedicated personnel, and strict handwashing policies are helpful. Unwanted spread of amplicons outside the post-amplification room can be monitored with environmental swabs.

For in-house assays, establishment of the performance specifications of the assay must be done with the appropriate sample type.

It provides real-time results with the appropriate instrumentation, contamination containment with closed-tube amplification that requires no post-PCR manipulation, and reduced implementation costs due to its robust nature. Several real-time PCR probe technologies exist, such as 5\u2032 nuclease (TaqMan\u00ae) probes (Life Technologies Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA), molecular beacons, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) hybridization probes.[70] However, multiplexing is further challenged with the need to avoid fluorescent cross-talk. Analysis of the fluorescent signal is aided by spectral calibration, which associates the target probe with its proper wavelength, but this is theoretically limited to five targets. In diagnostic practice, however, real-time multiplexing is difficult to optimize and is often seen with fewer than five targets.[71] More commonly, real-time PCRs are used as single-target assays to avoid competitive inhibition, whereby one or more of the targets are preferentially amplified over one of the other multiplexed targets. There are several examples of commercially available assays in this category, but perhaps the best studied and validated example is the ProFlu+ Assay (Gen-Probe Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). This assay is a multiplexed real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR that detects influenza A virus, influenza B virus, and RSV.",

Each RT-PCR product is treated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase and with exonuclease I before incorporation of biotin-deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) during a TSPE reaction. TSPE effectively helps to detect viral DNA that is present in the sample, using a unique sequence tag. After TSPE, the reaction is added directly to microwells containing bead-immobilized anti-tags, which are the complements of the sequence tags on the primers.

The following virus types and subtypes are identified using the classic version of the CE-marked xTAG\u00ae RVP assay: influenza A (subtypes H1 [seasonal], H3 [seasonal], and H5), influenza B, RSV (subgroups A and B), parainfluenza virus (types 1, 2, 3, and 4), coronavirus (strains NL63, OC43, HKU1, and 229E), acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), hMPV, entero-rhinovirus, and adenovirus.",

The ESI-MS component of the process helps to differentiate a mixture of amplicons after PCR with sufficient accuracy to permit the determination of the base composition (i.e. A, G, C, and T) of individual PCR products. Consequently, this technology appears to have good potential for outbreak investigations with the right mixture of broad-spectrum PCRs and a good database to permit identification.",

However, the most promising advantage of using mass spectrophotometry for the demultiplexing stage of PCR is the speed and cost effectiveness of this method and its ability to deal with a mixture of amplicons, which challenges traditional DNA sequencing. The weakness to date has been the lack of a public-domain database of base compositions, with attention given to potential mutation-associated differences that will dramatically affect the accuracy of identification. Allelic difference and mutations are less devastating to identification by DNA sequencing. Base composition databases, which are required for analysis, have not yet been developed fully, unlike DNA sequencing data, which are currently available in several well established databases such as GenBank, with over 300 000 organisms at the genus level or lower.[76]",
