            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) causes vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration, and the mortality rate in newborn pigs can be up to 100% [1, 2]. The virus is highly contagious and affects pigs of all ages and breeds. PEDV has been reported in many countries since it was first identified in Britain and Belgium [3]. In China, PEDV is more prevalent than porcine rotavirus and transmissible gastroenteritis virus, which also cause viral diarrhea in pigs [4]. The most common practice for preventing PEDV infection is transfer of passive immunity from sows to nursing piglets [5]. Pregnant sows are vaccinated with inactivated or attenuated vaccines and antibodies are passively transferred in the colostrum [5]. This transfer of PEDV immunity is affected by the length of time when the piglets are suckling and the antibody titer in the sow colostrum [5]. Inactivated vaccines are relatively expensive and are inefficient at inducing a mucosal immune response. Given the prevalence of PEDV infection, novel preventive measures are urgently needed [6\u20139].",

It is a pleomorphic enveloped virus containing a positive-stranded RNA genome, which is approximately 28 kb in length and has a 5\u2032 cap and a 3\u2032 polyadenylated tail. The virus contains four structural proteins: spike (S), integral membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) [11]. The S protein, a type I membrane glycoprotein, is required for virus entry into host cells and binding to the viral receptor porcine amino peptidase. There are two domains in the S protein, S1 (amino acids [aa] 1-735) and S2 (from 736 to the last aa). Previous work has shown that neutralizing epitopes are mainly located in S1 [11\u201314]. The antigenic variation in the S protein, especially in the S1 domain, makes prevention of PEDV infection more difficult [15\u201317]. However, based on the surface expression and the function of the S protein, S1 is an attractive target for genetically engineering a PEDV vaccine [18].",

Swinepox virus (SPV) is a naturally mild virus that can potentially function as a vaccination vehicle for the following reasons: a) SPV would not be interfered with by maternal antibodies and b) SPV is host-specific and not transmissible to other species [22]. SPV can express foreign genes effectively and can be modified to include large amounts of recombinant DNA. Moreover, it has low delivery costs and can be a useful platform for live vaccines [23]. Those advantages of SPV suggest that it could be a viable platform for developing a safe live vaccine for PEDV [24, 25].",

Fifteen one-month-old pigs (Large White) were randomly divided into five groups (3 per group) and were immunized twice on days 0 and 21 with (1) rSPV-St (1 \u00d7 108 PFU in 2 ml of PBS, protein concentration 4.9 mg/mL), (2) inactivated PEDV strain SQ2014 (1 \u00d7 106 PFU in 2 mL of PBS, protein concentration 4.4 mg/mL), (3) inactivated PEDV strain CV777 (1 \u00d7 106 PFU in 2 mL of PBS, protein concentration 4.7 mg/mL), (4) wtSPV (1 \u00d7 108 PFU in 2 mL of PBS, protein concentration 4.6 mg/mL), (5) PBS alone (negative control). The protein concentration was determined using a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer. The live vaccine and the negative control were administered subcutaneously and orally (1:1 volume ratio), while the inactivated vaccines were mixed with the Freund\u2019s incomplete adjuvant and administered intramuscularly. Sera were collected from the animals on days 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42 post-primary immunization for antibody titration or passive transfer study. To test the protection efficacy of the rSPV-St vaccine, sera collected from each group at day 42 post-immunization were pooled and used to feed one-day-old piglets. Briefly, 50 one-day-old piglets, verified as PEDV negative, were randomly divided into five groups (10 per group) and were fed with sera from each of the vaccination and control groups. The sera were added to milk at a ratio of 5 ml of serum per liter of milk. Each piglet was fed with 50 ml of the serum-milk mixture five times per day [29, 30]. On the second day of serum feeding, five piglets randomly selected from each group were infected with PEDV SQ2014 (1 \u00d7 106 PFU in 1 mL of PBS, orally via a gastric tube), while the remaining five piglets in each group were infected with PEDV CV777 (1 \u00d7 106 PFU in 1 mL of PBS, orally via a gastric tube). Animals were monitored for 10 days for clinical signs. Small-intestine tissue samples were collected from animals that died from virus challenge for histology. On day 10 post-challenge, the surviving animals were euthanized by intramuscular injection of a combination of ketamine (20 mg/kg) and xylazine (2 mg/kg), followed by intravenous injection of a pentobarbital sodium overdose (60 mg/kg), and the intestinal tissues were sampled. The collected small intestine samples were processed for histological analysis.",

To examine the protective efficacy of antibodies induced by the rSPV-St vaccine, piglets were fed sera from animals vaccinated with rSPV-St, inactivated SQ2014, inactivated CV777, wtSPV, or PBS. On the following day, animals were challenged with either SQ2014 or CV777. The piglets fed sera from pigs vaccinated with rSPV-St and inactivated vaccines (inactivated SQ2014, inactivated CV777) were fully protected against the homologous virus challenge, while all animals succumbed to the challenge with the heterologous virus (Fig. 4A and B, Tables 1 and 2). As expected, animals fed sera from pigs vaccinated with wtSPV or PBS exhibited clinical signs including diarrhea, loss of appetite, reduced weight gain, and increased mental instability, and all animals died between 8 and 10 days post-challenge. Histological examination revealed no lesions in the intestinal tissues from piglets in the homologous challenge groups. However, evident histological changes were observed in tissues from animals that died from the heterologous virus challenge, as well as those that received sera from wtSPV or PBS vaccination but died from either virus challenge. These changes included degeneration and necrosis of intestinal microvilli and infiltration of inflammatory cells (Fig. 5, Table 3).

The vaccine induced a robust immune response to the S antigen of PEDV in pigs and provided full protection against homologous challenge with wt SQ2014. Our results suggest that rSPV-St is a promising live vaccine candidate against PEDV. It has been reported that some epitopes are conserved among various PEDV strains [35\u201337]. However, it is unclear whether these different strains of PEDV can induce a cross-immune response in pigs. Most commercial PED vaccines in China are inactivated vaccines, the protective efficacy of which is weakened due to the different virus genotypes used for vaccine generation [37]. Furthermore, inactivated vaccines do not induce an efficient mucosal immune response, and this is a potential reason why there are many reports about the lack of efficacy of commercial PEDV vaccines from 2010.",

The pig immune reactions in our experiments were interesting. Immunization with rSPV-St resulted in the highest IgA antibody titer and cytokine response among the five experimental groups, but the IgG titers were lower than those elicited by inactivated SQ2014. However, rSPV-St vaccine provided efficient protection in newborn pigs that was as effective as that provided by the inactivated SQ2014 vaccine. These findings indicated that the neutralizing antibody titer is not the only criterion for whether a vaccine is effective; the IgA antibody titer and cytokines also contribution to protection. These results show that the efficacy of a vaccine cannot be evaluated by only measuring the neutralizing antibody titer in vitro.",

Our data suggest that the SPV live vaccine could induce a more sustainable humoral immune response than the inactive vaccine.
