The data indicated that China isolates could be differentiated into 3 distinct genetic groups or genotypes. Group I included 41 of the 51 field isolates, which were tentatively named A2-like viruses. Four China field isolates were included in group II, which were tentatively named LSD-like viruses. China group III comprised 6 isolates, which were grouped with the Massachusetts serotype.

Evaluation of the pathogenicity of IBV was based on several criteria, including: clinical signs, gross pathologic lesions, histopathologic changes, and tissue tropism. In this study, a China IBV strain isolated from a 30-day-old vaccinated broiler flock that had a history of respiratory signs, severe renal disease, and higher than expected mortality rate was analyzed by clinical observation, histopathologic examination, RT-PCR, virus isolation, and immunohistochemistry. Analyses revealed that the YN strain induced severe pathogenicity in 30-day-old SPF chickens with a 65% death rate and substantial kidney lesions.",

Most China IBV field isolates belonged to the same genetic cluster (A2-like), but the serotypes of these prevalent IBV strains differed from those of the currently used vaccine strains in China (M41-like, e.g., H120, Ma5, 28/86, and W93), which are considered the main cause of disease outbreaks (5,15\u201317).
