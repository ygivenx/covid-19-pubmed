Major risk factors for cholera\u2014poverty, overcrowding, poor hygiene, contaminated food, and lack of safe drinking water (2,3)\u2014largely resemble the consequences of war and civil fighting. Yet little is known about the relationship between cholera and conflict. This lack of information may be because cholera tends to be epidemic, affecting hundreds to thousands of people across vast, war-torn regions, making it impossible for local governments, nongovernment organizations, and aid workers to control, let alone collect and analyze data.",
