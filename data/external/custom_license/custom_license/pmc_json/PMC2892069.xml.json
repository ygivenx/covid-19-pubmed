            "text": "The use of sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation (SV) has significantly expanded in the last decade (Howlett et al. 2006; Scott and Schuck 2006; Cole et al. 2008), and new computational methods for SV analysis are being actively developed by several groups (Balbo et al. 2005; Philo 2006; Brown et al. 2007, 2009; Behlke and Ristau 2009; Brookes et al. 2009; Correia and Stafford 2009). In particular, diffusion-deconvoluted sedimentation coefficient distributions calculated from direct boundary modeling of experimental data (Schuck 2000; Schuck et al. 2002) have proven to be very useful tools in many biophysical applications (for a list of references see Schuck 2007). They can achieve relatively high hydrodynamic resolution of pauci- and polydisperse macromolecular mixtures, exhibit exquisite sensitivity for trace components (Berkowitz 2006; Liu et al. 2006; Brown et al. 2008a, b; Gabrielson et al. 2009), and can be related to sedimentation coefficient isotherms and Gilbert\u2013Jenkins theory for the analysis of slowly or rapidly interacting systems (Dam and Schuck 2005; Dam et al. 2005). The extension of sedimentation coefficient distributions to two-dimensional size-and-shape distributions was introduced (Schuck 2002; Brown and Schuck 2006) and applied in numerous studies (Markossian et al. 2006; Chang et al. 2007; Deng et al. 2007; Race et al. 2007; Broomell et al. 2008; Brown et al. 2008; Chebotareva et al. 2008; Iseli et al. 2008; Moncrieffe et al. 2008; Paz et al. 2008; Sivakolundu et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2008; Eronina et al. 2009; Mortuza et al. 2009). More recently, the Demeler laboratory has described the concept of a novel algorithm (\u201c2DSA\u201d) for determining size-and-shape distributions, as implemented in the software ULTRASCAN (Brookes et al. 2006, 2009; Demeler et al. 2009). In the present work, we critically compare the background of the different algorithms and assess their performance.",

A monoclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG) preparation in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer was inserted in 12-mm Epon centerpieces, temperature equilibrated at 18\u00b0C, and then accelerated to 45,000 rpm and scanned with absorbance optics at 280 nm. Data analysis was performed with SEDFIT 11.8 using c(s) models as described by Schuck et al. (2002), the two-dimensional size-and-shape model c(s, fr) as described by Brown and Schuck (2006), and applying Bayesian prior knowledge as described in detail by Brown et al. (2007).

A well-known and widely applied strategy to suppress artificial spikes is Tikhonov\u2013Phillips regularization (Phillips 1962; Provencher 1982; Louis 1989; Hansen 1992; Press et al. 1992), which uses, for example, the square of the second-derivative matrix (Hk\u03ba) to stabilize the solution of (4):6\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ \\mathop {\\text{Min}}\\limits_{{c_{k} \\ge 0}} \\left[ {\\sum\\limits_{l} {\\left( {a_{l} - \\sum\\limits_{k = 1}^{K} {c_{k} \\chi_{kl} } } \\right)}^{2} + \\alpha \\sum\\limits_{k,\\kappa } {c_{k} H_{k\\kappa } c_{\\kappa } } } \\right] $$\\end{document}or, formulated with normal equations,7\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ \\left( {{\\mathbf{P}} + \\alpha {\\mathbf{H}}} \\right){\\vec{\\mathbf{c}}} = {\\vec{\\mathbf{d}}}, $$\\end{document}where \u03b1 is a parameter that scales the regularization constraint (Louis 1989; Press et al. 1992).

A Bayesian variation of this approach is possible that modulates the regularization matrix to enhance the information content of the solution in view of existing (or hypothesized) prior knowledge (Sivia 1996; Brown et al. 2007; Patel et al. 2008).",

Let us consider as an example the experimental data from a preparation of IgG molecules sedimenting at 45,000 rpm, as shown in Fig. 1a. It is useful to start the analysis with a one-dimensional sedimentation coefficient distribution analysis c(s), since the sedimentation coefficients are the experimentally best determined quantities. c(s) eliminates the shape dimension by using hydrodynamic scaling laws such as the traditional s ~ M2/3 law for globular particles (Schuck 2000), theoretical models for wormlike chains (Yamakawa and Fujii 1973) or any user-defined exponential scaling laws for polymers (Pavlov et al. 2009). For the given data we can determine from the c(s) analysis (not shown) that s-values from 0.1 to 15 S will be sufficient to describe all sedimenting species. Equidistant discretizations with S = 100 or S = 200 lead to statistically indistinguishable quality of fit, as measured by F-statistics (Bevington and Robinson 1992; Straume and Johnson 1992), and therefore we preliminarily conclude that S = 100 will be a reasonable choice.",

Therefore, a discretization providing F = 10 values between 1.0 and 2.5 (ranging from extremely compact to very extended protein structures) should be a sufficiently flexible basis to describe the actual frictional ratio for each species (knowing that we have inserted folded proteins into the sample solution, and keeping in mind the average frictional ratio of 1.68 estimated from the c(s) analysis). The resulting 10 \u00d7 100 grid with a total of K = 1,000 species was fitted with the standard algorithm to the data in Fig. 1a, leading to virtually random distribution of residuals (1b), with a root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) of 0.00672, consistent with the noise in the data acquisition. The resulting distribution is shown with and without regularization in Fig. 1d and c, respectively. As expected, while the s-values of the species are well defined, the shape dimension is highly underdetermined, resulting in the typical series of peaks in 1c, and in a smooth relatively uniform distribution after regularization in 1d. (This justifies, in retrospect, the choice of F = 10 values as a sufficiently detailed discretization of the frictional ratio dimension.)",

In typical high-speed SV experiments with eight-hole rotors, we can acquire usually only 50 scans or fewer before depletion occurs and/or migration and backdiffusion approach steady state, even with small solutes. This is sufficient for a highly detailed analysis of multicomponent systems, as discussed by Balbo et al. (2005). Predicted values \u03c7(si, fr, j, rn, tm) need to be calculated for each species (si, fr, j) with arrays of the same size as the data a(rn, tm). Since the experimental data have a precision not better than four decimal places, their representation as a standard 32-bit floating-point data type with eight significant figures is already wasteful. Nevertheless, calculating conservatively with 32-bit floats we arrive at a memory requirement of only ~4.8 MB for storage of model data, rather than 0.5 GB [250 \u00d7 50 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 4 bytes \u00d7 (1,048,576 bytes/MB)\u22121 = 4.76 MB]. With interference optical (IF) data, the native radial density of points is higher (~1,500 per scan). Since the radial density of points of interference scans is not exploited experimentally, it could be safely reduced to the level of absorbance data by pre-averaging, which reduces the statistical noise approximately by a factor of 2. However, again calculating conservatively and using the native resolution of IF data, this would lead to ~28 MB storage space, or ~57 MB if 100 scans were used to represent the evolution in a SV experiment.",

Accordingly, we generate a set of nonequidistant radial grid points with optimal spacing to achieve Lamm equation solutions with constant, predetermined accuracy (as measured by the maximum error for the radial data range to be analyzed). To optimize the efficiency, all points in the solvent and solution plateaus are calculated with the trivial analytical expressions (Brown and Schuck 2008).

For each subgrid, one can solve the distribution with the normal matrix method, and it is easy to show that the relevant matrix equations are \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ {\\mathbf{P}}^{(\\gamma )} {\\vec{\\mathbf{c}}}^{(\\gamma )} = {\\vec{\\mathbf{d}}}^{(\\gamma )}, $$\\end{document} where \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ {\\mathbf{P}}^{(\\gamma )} $$\\end{document} are square submatrices of P of size (K/\u0393) \u00d7 (K/\u0393) and \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ {\\vec{\\mathbf{d}}}^{(\\gamma )} $$\\end{document} are subvectors of \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ {\\vec{\\mathbf{d}}} $$\\end{document} of size 1 \u00d7 (K/\u0393).

            "text": "Generally, Monte Carlo simulations are not part of the diverse set of regularization methods explored in the standard literature (Louis 1989; Hansen 1992, 1998; Kress 1999; Engl et al. 2000), although Monte Carlo methods have been used for estimating the regularization parameters of standard regularization functionals (Ramani et al. 2008). The concept of a statistical distribution of parameter values should be confused neither with the real population distribution of coexisting species in the sample mixture nor the estimate of the latter in the form of a calculated size-and-shape distribution. Nevertheless, one could ask to what extent one can rely on the statistical nature of the noise in the data, in combination with noise amplification, to produce a parsimonious two-dimensional histogram of (s, fr)-species populations. As an example, we compare in Fig. 6 the standard analysis of our model data with the 10 \u00d7 100 grid and Tikhonov regularization (6a) with the histogram of all distributions from 50 Monte Carlo iterations (each based on an exact standard fit with the 10 \u00d7 100 grid; 6b). After 50 iterations the histogram clearly shows multimodal and spiky behavior suggesting the presence of multiple species, in contrast to the single broad peak representing the smoothest solution of all that fit the originally measured data. Thus, the 50 Monte Carlo iterations do not provide an effective means to correctly identify the information content of the data. If, on the other hand, we are independently knowledgeable about the monodisperse nature of the sample, we can use the Bayesian approach (Brown et al. 2007) to calculate the size-and-shape distribution that is closest to a single peak, and these results are shown, for comparison, in Fig. 6c.",

(2009). We have compared this with the standard approach that is well established for solving ill-posed integral equations problems in many fields, which rests on well-established linear algebra and related numerical tools of linear least-squares analysis. Contrary to the assertion of Brookes, Cao, and Demeler, the application of the standard approach to the size-and-shape distribution problem is quite feasible on ordinary laboratory computers within only a few minutes of computation time, even when using high-resolution grids suitable to fully extract the experimental information content. As implemented in SEDFIT, this approach is being applied in many laboratories (Markossian et al. 2006; Chang et al. 2007; Deng et al. 2007; Race et al. 2007; Broomell et al. 2008; Brown et al. 2008; Chebotareva et al. 2008; Iseli et al. 2008; Moncrieffe et al. 2008; Paz et al. 2008; Sivakolundu et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2008; Eronina et al. 2009; Mortuza et al. 2009). Since this can supply exact (up to numerical precision) best-fit solutions, we have applied it to a data analysis example to serve as a reference solution in a study of the performance of different computational strategies on which 2DSA relies. This illustrates the consequences of the deviations from the established mathematical reference frame that should be expected to arise in Demeler\u2019s 2DSA approach.",

In the simplest form, this argument would be incompatible with basic matrix algebra, because it neglects cross-correlation between points from different grids. Discarding the magnitude of species\u2019 populations in this concatenated distribution, and using only the pattern of nonnegativity constraints from such an analysis, is in conflict with the established Lawson and Hanson algorithm NNLS. The effect of the empirical extension to multiple stages is uncertain, and may not converge.

However, this condition is not fulfilled in the present case. In SV analysis, the cross-correlation of signals from different species can be very large. This is reflected by the fact that (1) is ill posed, and illustrated by the fact that the matrices in Fig. 4b and c are different. For a correct solution of the SV problem, the regular high-resolution grid should be considered fully and unbiased by any scheme of preselection of excluded parameter regions.

(2008), where a standard c(s) analysis of SV data with maximum-entropy regularization exhibits only a single broad skewed distribution [Fig. 3c in Planken et al. (2008)], consistent with the expected continuous size distribution of the material studied, yet the 2DSA analysis of the same data suggests the presence of more than 14 discrete peaks (at different s-values and all at similar frictional ratio) [Fig. 4 in Planken et al. (2008)]. The Monte Carlo approach is certainly an extremely computationally costly step, in particular if one would carry it out with statistically meaningful iteration numbers. In contrast, application of the standard Tikhonov regularization to the full high-resolution problem, with or without Bayesian modulation, takes a small fraction of the computational effort of the original problem, i.e., on the order of seconds on a PC.",

The authors do qualify their algorithm to be empirical, and that \u201cthe results are not generally in exact correspondence with the original problem\u201d (Brookes et al. 2006). They argue that \u201c[the results] can be made sufficiently close through careful use of the given heuristics\u201d (Brookes et al. 2006). We are uncertain of the process referred to here, and how closeness to the exact solution would possibly be assessed without explicitly calculating the exact best-fit solution. So far Demeler and colleagues have not brought forward any proof that the distributions returned by the 2DSA method are at least close in the major attributes to the correct solution. We believe that the question of correctness of the algorithm is critical, especially since the authors invite the general application of this method, as implemented in the ULTRASCAN software, to address data analysis problems in novel biophysical and biochemical studies, rather than simple model problems with known solutions.",

Whenever using linear elements for the finite-element solution, an obligatory error is the approximation of the true boundary shape by piecewise linear segments. This is illustrated here for a system chosen as model system by Cao and Demeler (2005, compare Fig. 8b), with s = 10 S and D = 2 \u00d7 10\u22127 cm2/s, for which very accurate Lamm equation solutions were calculated with a very fine discretization (black thin line). If the radial range from meniscus to bottom is divided evenly in a set of only 100 radial points and the boundary shape is approximated by piecewise linear segments (red line, residuals shown in enhanced scale in the graph below), very large deviations occur, even if at these points the correct Lamm equation solutions were calculated. For an even division with 200 radial points (blue) the obligatory errors are smaller but still approximately ten times the experimental noise. Grids with 100 radial points were proposed by Cao and Demeler (2005), leading for samples at unit concentration to maximum errors far exceeding the experimental noise. As shown by Brown and Schuck (2008), the minimum number of radial points that for this system allow for this obligate error to be <0.001 is ~300, based on an optimized nonequidistant spacing of radial points (using high density where boundaries are steep)",

In principle, the nomenclature indexing the 10 \u00d7 100 grid points for the fr \u00d7 s grid to form the vector of 1,000 parameters is arbitrary. a Here, all grid points are sorted by increasing s-value, i.e., (s1, fr,1), (s1, fr,2),\u2026(s1, fr,10),(s2, fr,1),\u2026(s2, fr,10),\u2026(s100, fr,10). As can be discerned from the smooth appearance, the matrix elements are not strongly dependent on the fr-value. b The same matrix can be reordered to reflect subdivision along ten regular subgrids \u03b3, each of the form (s10(\u03b3\u22121)+1, fr,1), (s10(\u03b3\u22121)+1, fr,2),\u2026(s10(\u03b3\u22121)+1, fr,10), (s10(\u03b3\u22121)+2, fr,1), (s10(\u03b3\u22121)+2, fr,2),\u2026(s10(\u03b3\u22121)+2, fr,10),\u2026(s10(\u03b3\u22121)+10, fr,1), (s10(\u03b3\u22121)+10, fr,2),\u2026(s10(\u03b3\u22121)+10, fr,10) with \u03b3 = 1\u202610. Each of the subgrids represents an evenly spaced 10 \u00d7 10 grid with origin shifted by \u03942s = 0.1505 S. c The idea that one could determine a high-resolution size-and-shape distribution from merging the results obtained separately in fits with subgrids corresponds to the assumption that there be no correlation between points from the different grids, i.e., that P can be subdivided into the ten submatrices P(\u03b3). For the present data, this corresponds to the solution of the problem with a normal matrix as shown in c. Clearly, this is very different from the true matrix shown in b",

This is the set of grid points for which b displays nonzero populations of the distribution. In a secondary analysis, a fit to this irregular grid is performed, and the results are shown as a contour plot.
