It causes many types of invasive diseases such as pneumonia and meningitis especially among children, elders, and immune-deficient patients. Resistance of S. pneumoniae to a variety of antibacterial agents including quinolones, penicillins, macrolides, and cephalosporins has been reported by a recent study [2]. Currently, up to 40 % of clinical infections are caused by a pneumococcal strain resistant to at least one drug, and 15 % are due to a strain resistant to three or more drugs [3]. Pneumococcal diseases are \u2018vaccine preventable diseases,\u2019 and the preventative strategies available include targeted use of the 23-valent polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine for individuals above the age of 2 years. Regular immunization of newborns and children with the 7-valent polysaccharide-protein conjugate pneumococcal vaccine is another way to prevent the disease, though these are poorly efficacious in infants, immunocompromised patients, and the elderly, the populations that are most at risk [1]. The major drawback of a currently available vaccination includes the unaffordable prices and shortage of supply to the countries that are most affected [4].",

These virulence factors present in the cell wall attach to tissue in the body and allow the bacteria to survive against immune responses [5]. During invasion, the capsule is an essential determinant of virulence [6]. By preventing complement C3b opsonization of the bacterial cells, the capsule prevents phagocytosis. One hundred five different capsule types of pneumococci have been identified which forms the basis of antigenic serotyping of the organism [7]. Vaccines that act against pneumococcal infections are based on formulations of various capsular (polysaccharide) antigens derived from the highly prevalent serotypes. Thus, none of the current vaccine is effective against all the 105 different serotypes. In addition, other limitations such as serotype replacement [8] by non-vaccine serotypes are reported; hence, an effective protein vaccine against S. pneumoniae is required to prevent pneumococcal infections [7].",

Hence, the process is time consuming and cost ineffective with a very low success rate and is difficult for organisms which cannot be cultured in vitro. And it is almost impossible to identify and develop a universal vaccine candidate using a conventional method for variable organisms like S. pneumoniae containing various strains. This would require the tedious process of searching for an antigen that is common to all strains, processing it, and testing it for vaccine potency [9].",

These advances in genomic technologies mean that every single antigen of a pathogen can be tested for its ability to induce a protective immune response. Reverse vaccinology (RV) is one such approach which is reverse to the conventional approach and involves the mining of genome information of the organism using a proteomic and bioinformatics-based software [11]. This overcomes the complications of the conventional vaccine candidate screening. Here, we have used this novel approach for the identification of the most conserved protein antigens of S. pneumoniae which can be potent vaccine candidates.",

Since cell surface proteins are important vaccine or drug targets in the case of microbial pathogens, predicting these proteins on the bacterial cell surface could be of great use to develop newer targets. The occurrence of a membrane spanning alpha helices or signal peptides within the primary structure of a protein is an important player that influences a protein\u2019s subcellular localization in a cell. Using these key structural features, PSORTb automatically predicts the subcellular localization of a bacterial protein, whether the protein is present within the cell or localized on the surface [11]. A given protein sequence is examined for presence of motifs, signal peptides, and transmembrane alpha helices, and compared to similar proteins whose localization is previously known. Using a probabilistic technique, the above features are analyzed, and a set of five likely localization sites are returned with their respective probability scores. In fivefold cross-validation analyses, a high overall precision (specificity) of 97 % and a relatively high recall (sensitivity) of 75 % were attained, validating the accuracy of PSORTb.",

In an antigen, the whole molecule does not bind to the receptor or the antibody, instead only a part of it binds and is called a B cell epitope, and thus acts as an antigenic determinant. For an antigenic protein, this epitope may be either a group of atoms on the protein surface or a short peptide both present in the three-dimensional space. In this study, we used the Kolaskar and Tongaonkar approach from the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) where B cell antibody epitopes are predicted using amino acid propensities [15]. On the basis of physiochemical parameters of amino acid residues and their occurring frequencies in known investigational epitopes, this semi-empirical approach was developed and could predict the B cell epitopes with about 75 % accuracy. The most important consideration from this antigenicity scale is that the amino acids Cys, Val, and Leu have high antigenic propensity (Ap) values and are hydrophobic. Hence, whenever these occur on surface, they are most likely to be a part of antigenic determinant.",

Proteins having relatively greater score than the threshold limit were selected from the initial analysis of five antigenic proteins.",

This is termed \u201cpan genome reverse vaccinology\u201d where various strains of an organism are taken into consideration while developing a vaccine candidate [17]. This approach has been used by Maione et al. (2005) where eight strains of group B streptococcus were cloned and tested in the search for highly efficacious vaccine candidates [18]. An approach combining wet lab and dry lab for determining potential vaccine candidates against S. pneumoniae using a genome of a single strain was used to develop new vaccine candidates against the organism [19]. The first classical example of application of reverse vaccinology to identify a potential vaccine candidate was published in the year 2000 involving serogroup B meningococcus (Neisseria meningitides) [20]. Later, a universal vaccine for serogroup B meningococcus was identified during 2006 and in 2011 clinical trials for multicomponent (4CMenB) and recombinant vaccine testing (rMenB) in human beings was undertaken with promising results [21, 22].",

            "text": "Four significant properties of any antigenic protein were considered\u2014conservedness, immunogenicity, surface localization, and unrelatedness with human proteome. For evaluating the conservedness of the selected proteins across the pneumococcal serotypes, we have used BLASTn program for the selection of proteins showing maximum identity among the sequences for all strains available in the database. Surface-located proteins have been of much use as vaccine candidates for many years due to their great immunogenic capability. So, we have predicted the surface localization through PSORTb 3.0.2. Immunogenic potential of the candidate proteins were calculated via the \u2018Kolaskar and Tongaonkar antigenicity scale\u2019 in the IEDB which gives an antigenic score for different peptides in a protein. BLASTp program in the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) was used for the sequence alignment of the proteins with the sequences of the available human proteins in the databases. The notable advantage of the computational analysis for the antigen prediction is the screening of numerous candidates for the selection of most promising among them. This approach can serve as a first-pass filter in the process of vaccine development. This analysis gave most convincing results for the two surface proteins, pavB and spuA. pavB is encoded by open reading frame SP0082 and derived its name from another fibronectin binding protein termed as pavA [34]. A major factor which determines virulence in Gram-positive cocci is their ability to interact with serum or ECM (extracellular matrix) proteins. TIGR strain genome annotation showed four streptococcal surface repeats (SSUREs) in pavB, whereby the third SSURE binds to immobilized fibronectin, and the separate SSUREs bind with repetitive motifs of a host\u2019s fibronectin [34, 35]. pavB has previously been identified as an important bacterial surface protein that binds to fibronectin and plasminogen components of the extracellular matrix and, therefore, plays a central role in molecular pathogenesis of pneumococcal infections [36]. Studies like these have established pavB as a vital protein component of S. pneumoniae. Studies by Jensch et al. (2010) demonstrated pavB as a surface-exposed molecule participating in pneumococcal colonization, where pavB works as an adhesin. This study demonstrated the presence of pavB in all of the strains under test. A delay in migration to the lungs and decreased colonization rates was observed with mutant pavB strains [37]. Surface protein pullulanase was so named as it was homologous to the 3\u2032 region of gene encoding alkyl amylopullulanase (apuA) in Bacillus sp. [38]. Bongaerts et al. characterized pullulanase (spuA) and found it as highly conserved and is expressed in all growth phases of S. pneumoniae, making it as a potential vaccine candidate in the future [39]. Southern and Western blot analysis identified spuA as monocistronic with a molecular weight of 140 kDa. Furthermore, YNWGY motif, common to all pullulanases, was identified in spuA [39, 40]. Four regions (I, II, III, and IV) along with their catalytic triad, Asp785\u2013Glus814\u2013Asp902, which forms a catalytic domain of amylolytic enzymes, was reported in spuA. Moreover, amino acid sequence revealed presence of LPXTG motif, and surface localization was confirmed via immunocytometry and immunofluorescence. N-terminal region of spuA was found to be located on the surface, capable of eliciting immunity and species specific. Author has emphasized the need of inactivation and virulence studies in deciphering the role of these proteins in the pathogenesis of S. pneumoniae [39]. Structure-function studies of spuA and pulA through X-ray crystallography deciphered the molecular basis of glycogen specificity. This study observed the specificity of these proteins to glycogen of type II alveolar cells and probability of alpha-glucan metabolizing mechanism being a crucial factor responsible for streptococcal virulence [41]. Abbott et al. also characterized two proteins, spuA and MalX, and deduced glycogen as the substrate for these enzymes [42]. These studies suggest that spuA helps in binding to epithelial cells of lung which is a familiar target site for this pathogen. These proteins can be tested further for their immunogenic property in the wet lab experiments for their future use as a well-conserved and highly immunogenic vaccine candidate against a variety of S. pneumoniae strains. The present work, though preliminary, is both cost effective and less time consuming for screening of vaccine candidates when compared to a traditional approach, but the screened vaccine candidate has to be validated using a biological assay.",
