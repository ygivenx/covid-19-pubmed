The PCR assay was based on the detection of a specific 142 base\u2010pair product of the N gene of ECoV.3 Viral load was reported as genome equivalents per gram of feces. A plasmid was constructed with the 142 bp amplicon and 10\u2010fold dilutions were used to obtain the slope and y\u2010intercept for load calculations. The equation is the absolute value of the CP\u2010y intercept/slope. Furthermore, a real\u2010time PCR assay targeting a universal sequence of the bacterial 16s rRNA gene was used as quality control (ie, efficiency of DNA purifications and amplification) and as an indicator of fecal inhibition.7 After identification of ECoV in affected horses, subsequent screening of the remaining horses in the herd was completed. Repeated testing was performed daily on six horses from the CA outbreak until at least three consecutive negative samples were obtained. Other common enteric pathogens of horses, including Salmonella enterica, Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens, Lawsonia intracellularis, and Neorickettsia risticii were also investigated in feces of four of the sick horses by specific PCR.3\n",
