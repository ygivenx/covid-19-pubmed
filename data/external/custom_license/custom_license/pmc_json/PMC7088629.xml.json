            "text": "Vaccines have been used to prevent a wide range of infectious and non-infectious diseases (Poland et al. 2002). Vaccine antigens are composed of antigenic proteins and are devoid of pathogenic genes, so cannot establish infection (Strugnell et al. 2011). Vaccine antigens can be produced using a variety of host expression systems, including genetically engineered bacterial, yeast, mammalian and plant cells. Plants are attractive expression vehicles for commercial production of vaccine antigens. Plant-based vaccines hold great promise as they are cost-effective, easy-to-administer, easy-to-store, fail-safe and acceptable, particularly in developing countries (Lal et al. 2007; Sala et al. 2003). Novel approaches to improve the yield and biosafety of plant-based vaccines have been proposed (Hern\u00e1ndez et al. 2014). Agroinfiltration is a simple, efficient and robust method for transient protein expression (Leuzinger et al. 2013).",

PEDV disrupts villus enterocytes and causes villi atrophy within the jejunum and ileum, leading to a mortality rate of up to 95 % in infected suckling pigs (Ducatelle et al. 1981). PED was first detected in Belgium (Pensaert and de Bouck 1978) and the UK (Chasey and Cartwright 1978), and was designated CV777. Outbreaks of this disease, which have been reported in many pig farming countries, have led to severe economic losses in Canada (Turgeon et al. 1980), Japan (Takahashi et al. 1983), China (Li et al. 2012), Thailand (Puranaveja et al. 2009), Korea (Lee and Lee 2014), the United States (Stevenson et al. 2013) and, more recently, in Austria (Steinrigl et al. 2015).",

            "text": "The genome of PEDV consists of a single molecule of linear positive-sense single-stranded RNA. The complete sequence of the genome of strain CV777 was found to be 28,033 nucleotides in length, excluding the poly A-tail (Kocherhans et al. 2001). The large spike glycoprotein peplomer (S), one of four structural proteins, stimulates production of neutralizing antibodies in the host. The predicted S polypeptide is 1383 amino acids long, contains 29 potential N-linked glycosylation sites and shows structural features similar to those of the coronavirus spike protein (Duarte and Laude 1994). The PEDV S protein can be divided into the S1 domain (aa 1\u2013789) and S2 domain (aa 790\u20131383) based on the presence of the conserved nonamer and GxCx motifs at the proteolytic cleavage site of the S protein of other members of coronavirus group II (Follis et al. 2006). Within the S1 domain, two important epitope domains were determined. The first domain is the PEDV-neutralizing epitope (CO-26 K equivalent, COE gene), which is 139 aa long and spans the region aa 499\u2013638 (Chang et al. 2002). Sun et al. identified the second epitope domain, designated S1D (aa 636\u2013789), and reported that it induces neutralizing antibodies (Sun et al. 2008). In this study, the S1D gene alone, and that fused with the cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) gene of Vibrio cholerae, were cloned into plant expression vectors. These vectors were transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana (N. benthamiana) using agroinfiltration. The proteins were orally administered to mice to induce specific immune responses.",

The culture was transferred to 200 mL of LB medium and incubation continued at 37 \u00b0C for 2 h to an OD600 of 0.6\u20130.8. Expression of the recombinant proteins was induced by adding iso-propyl-\u03b2-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 10 mM, followed by incubation for a further 6 h at 37 \u00b0C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed in 10 mL of \u2018buffer Z\u2019 (8 M urea, 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES, pH 8.0) by sonication on ice (20 min; 20 s runs with 15 s breaks between each run). After centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C using a JA-14 rotor (Beckman Coulter, Pasadena, CA, USA) to remove cell debris, imidazole was added to the bacterial lysate supernatant to a final concentration of 10 mM and the sample was loaded onto a 2 mL nickel column (Ni\u2013NTA; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).

The S1D protein was detected with a molecular weight of ~34 kDa (Fig. 3a, b) in comparison with the bacterial S1D positive control, which was observed at ~17 kDa (Fig. 3a\u2013f). No background signal bands corresponding to the S1D protein were detected in protein extracts from leaves infiltrated with p19 at 4 dpi, as a negative control. Leaves infiltrated with S1D without p19 showed high-density bands at 2 dpi, whereas the S1D levels in the presence of p19 (+p19) were significantly increased, and peaked at 4 dpi (Fig. 3a).",

In the unboiled condition, assembly of CTB\u2013S1D fusion protein into oligomeric structures resembling pentamers with a molecular weight of over 170 kDa was detected using anti-CT and anti-S1D antibodies (Fig. 3c, d), in comparison with the bacterial CTB positive control, which was observed at ~43 kDa (Fig. 3c). A 17 kDa band was observed for the bacterial S1D protein (Fig. 3d, f). When protein extracts were boiled for 5 min, the oligomeric fusion protein dissociated into ~ 51 kDa monomers and was detected by both anti-CT and anti-S1D antibodies (Fig. 3e, f).

The high molecular weight of plant-derived CTB\u2013S1D (~51 kDa) may be due to glycosylation of CTB (2 potential N-glycosylation sites) and S1D (seven potential N-glycosylation sites, Fig. 3e, f), resulting in retardation of migration.

The mortality rate in piglets is 90\u201395 %, leading to significant economic losses (Debouck and Pensaert 1980; Steinrigl et al. 2015). PED was reported as a re-emergent disease in the United States and neighboring countries, such as Canada and Central American, European and Asian countries (Beam et al. 2015; Li et al. 2012; Steinrigl et al. 2015). In late 2013, a severe outbreak of PEDV infection occurred in Korea, causing economic losses to the pork industry (Lee et al. 2015). Therefore, an effective vaccine to protect pigs against PEDV infection is required. The neutralizing COE epitope (aa 499\u2013638) in the spike glycoprotein was identified (Chang et al. 2002). Based on optimized codon usage in plant, expression of the synthetic COE gene was fivefold higher than that of the native gene in transgenic tobacco plants (Kang et al. 2005). To enhance the immune responses, the synthetic COE gene was fused with a mucosal adjuvant and carrier, LTB and CTB, respectively, and with the M cell-target peptide ligand Co1, and expressed in various plant species including tobacco (Kang et al. 2005), lettuce (Huy et al. 2009, 2011) and rice callus (Huy et al. 2012). Oral immunization with COE-Co1 fusion protein expressed in transgenic rice callus induced systemic and mucosal immune responses against the COE antigen (Huy et al. 2012). Recently, S1D (aa 636\u2013789) has been seen as an alternative neutralizing epitope domain in the spike protein of PEDV (Sun et al. 2008). In this report, the S1D epitope alone or fusion protein was expressed in infiltrated N. benthamiana by agroinfiltration. The immunogenicity of the transiently expressed proteins was investigated to develop an edible vaccine against PEDV.",

            "text": "Plant cells have been widely used to express recombinant vaccine antigens. Recombinant proteins can be expressed in plants by creating stable transgenic plants or by performing transient expression. Transient expression offers several advantages: accumulation of high levels of protein, short timeline of protein production, scalability and elimination of transgene outflow (Chen et al. 2013). To optimize S1D expression, the gene was added to various expression vectors, including the Agrobacterium vector pTRAC (Maclean et al. 2007), a viral pro-vector (Marillonnet et al. 2004) and a binary vector. The target protein was expressed at a high level using the binary vector. However, the level of protein production was low (Figs. 3a, 4a), as it was limited by the PTGS factor. The p19 protein of TBSV prevents the onset of PTGS in infiltrated leaves and enhances the levels of transiently co-expressed proteins (Mohammadzadeh et al. 2015; Voinnet et al. 2003). The S1D and CTB\u2013S1D protein levels were enhanced from fourfold to sevenfold in the presence of p19 (Figs. 3, 4), respectively. Moreover, accumulation of the CTB\u2013S1D fusion protein was fourfold greater than that of the S1D protein (Fig. 4). The CTB portion plays a role in enhancing protein accumulation and as a mucosal adjuvant and carrier. In previous studies, the expression level of synthetic COE-Co1 was 0.083 % of TSP in transgenic rice under the control of the strong RAmy3D promoter at day 3 after induction in sucrose starvation medium (Huy et al. 2012). The highest expression level of CTB-COE fusion protein was 0.0065 % of TSP in transgenic lettuce plants (Huy et al. 2011). By performing transient expression in the presence of p19, the expression levels of S1D protein and CTB\u2013S1D fusion protein were 2- and 75-fold higher than those of COE-Co1 and CTB-COE in transgenic plants. The increased protein expression levels might result in elicitation of strong immune responses and prevent induction of immune tolerance by plant-based oral vaccines. The binding of functional CTB\u2013S1D fusion protein to its biological receptor, GM1-ganglioside, was confirmed by GM1-ELISA with anti-CT and anti-S1D antibodies (Fig. 4). These results indicated that the S1D protein of the CTB\u2013S1D fusion protein was assembled into functional oligomeric structures and retained its antigenicity.",

            "text": "To investigate the immunogenicity of the transiently expressed protein, the CTB\u2013S1D fusion gene was transiently expressed in N. benthamiana leaves by vacuum agroinfiltration (Fig. 2). The infiltrated leaves were lyophilized and ground, and the expression of assembled CTB\u2013S1D fusion protein was confirmed before oral administration to female BALB/c mice for 6 weeks at a 1-week interval (Fig. 6b). Mice given the CTB\u2013S1D fusion protein exhibited CTB- and S1D-specific systemic IgG at week 4. The IgG and sIgA levels were significantly increased at week 6 (Fig. 7a-d). CT acts not only as a mucosal immunogen and mucosal adjuvant but also as induces immune responses to unrelated nasally and orally co-administered antigens (Elson and Ealding 1984; Isaka et al. 2004). The CT61F mutant, which lacks ADP-ribosylation activity but retains the mucosal adjuvant properties of native CT, was expressed in rice callus (unpublished paper). To enhance the immune responses, transiently expressed CTB\u2013S1D was co-gavaged with bCT and rCTX into mice at appropriate doses (Fig. 6a). As expected, anti-CTB and anti-S1D Ab levels, in mice given CTB\u2013S1D with bCT and with rCTX at 6 weeks (Fig. 7a, b), were significantly higher than those of mice fed CTB\u2013S1D only. sIgA is the predominant antibody class in external secretions and the major humoral defense factor that prevents colonization of mucosal surfaces by infective agents, such as bacteria and viruses (Haan et al. 1995; Woof and Mestecky 2005). This sIgA may thus prevent PED. The levels of S1D-specific sIgA responses were significantly greater than those in the control group. The anti-S1D antibody levels in mice given CTB\u2013S1D and bCT were significantly increased in comparison with those fed CTB\u2013S1D only (Fig. 7d). The transient expression of CTB\u2013S1D fusion protein thus induced S1D-specific systemic and mucosal immune responses following oral administration to mice. bCT and rCTX enhanced S1D-specific antibody responses when orally co-administered with CTB\u2013S1D protein.",
