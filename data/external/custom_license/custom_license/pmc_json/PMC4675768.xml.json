However, the remaining two human CoVs cause severe respiratory syndromes and are associated with considerable mortality [1]. In 2003, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV caused a disease outbreak that claimed nearly 800 lives [2], and for the second consecutive decade this century, a new human CoV has emerged. The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV was first isolated from a 60-year-old man in Saudi Arabia in June 2012 [3]. Three years later, it has been responsible for the infection of more than 1300 individuals in 26 countries, and more than 480 related deaths [4].",

Aside from a moderate outbreak in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), travel-associated spread to other countries in the Middle East, as well as examples in Europe, North America, Africa and Asia, has typically resulted in very minimal local outbreaks. The clear exception to this is situation in the Republic of Korea, where over 180 cases have been reported, all during 2015 [4]. Infection in the index case followed recent travel to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UAE and Bahrain [5]. An International Health Regulations Emergency Committee has highlighted five main factors contributing to the spread of MERS-CoV in the Republic of Korea [6]. Briefly, these were (1) a lack of awareness among healthcare workers and the general public; (2) suboptimal infection prevention and control measures in hospitals; (3) crowded emergency rooms and multi-bed hospital rooms; (4) the practice of patients seeking care at multiple hospitals; (5) multiple visitors staying with infected patients in hospital rooms.",

There is good potential for outbreaks to be contained, given suitable levels of awareness and hygiene. The latest outbreak in Korea, however, is testament to the cost of neglecting these basic requirements. A recent study by our group demonstrated impressive, rapid virucidal activity of povidone iodine (PVP-I) against the Ebola virus (EBOV) [8]. PVP-I was also effective against the European reference virus (Modified vaccinia virus Ankara; MVA), which was determined to be a suitable surrogate test agent, facilitating the safe testing of the virucidal activity of antiseptic products against hazardous pathogens, including enveloped viruses such as EBOV [8]. PVP-I is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial, used globally in the medical field\u2014including the Middle East\u2014as a disinfectant for skin, hands and mucosal surfaces as well as for wound treatment and eye applications [9].",

Based on the current situation, the World Health Organization (WHO) has issued a number of recommendations [4]. Many of these reflect the lack of understanding of how humans become infected from animal or environmental sources, with particular emphasis on precautions relating to exposure to camels. The other focus is on ensuring that health care facilities adopt appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus from an infected patient to other patients, health care workers and visitors.",

Standard hand hygiene includes either washing hands with soap and water or the use of an alcohol-based hand rub [16]. Randomized, controlled trial data are available to support the effectiveness of PVP-I and alcohol hand rubs over plain soap hand wash for hand decontamination, based on post-hygiene colony-forming unit count [17]. In the context of virucidal activity, PVP-I has demonstrated superiority over ethanol-based sanitizers in inactivating murine norovirus on a modified finger pad test [18]. In an evaluation of the effectiveness of nine different hand sanitizers against feline calicivirus (a surrogate for norovirus), antiseptics containing 10% PVP-I achieved a greater viral reduction rate than any of the alcohol-based sanitizers, non-alcoholic sanitizers or antimicrobial soaps [19]. PVP-I has demonstrated virucidal activity against a range of enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. Perhaps most relevant in the context of the MERS-CoV is the evidence for effective inactivation of the SARS-CoV to below detectable levels within 2 min of exposure [20].",

However, respiratory viruses are also subject to airborne (particles \u22645 \u00b5m in size) or droplet (>5 \u00b5m) transmission, in which infected material is released by the infected individual breathing, coughing or sneezing [21]. Gargling represents an effective personal hygiene measure against airborne/droplet transmission, as it can reduce the microbe count at the pharynx [22]. Together with hand washing and mask use, it has been proposed that gargling is one of the three major personal hygiene protection measures against common airborne and droplet-transmitted infections [22]. Specialists advise that the criteria for selecting mouthwashes should include effectiveness of the antiseptic agent in killing pathogens [22]. Given the strong in vitro virucidal activity of PVP-I demonstrated in this and other studies, gargling/flushing with PVP-I may be an effective measure to disrupt the transmission of respiratory viruses, especially via airborne/droplet transmission or after uptake via the mouth (such as when touching the mouth or food with contaminated hands).",

To demonstrate at least a 4 log10 reduction in virus titer, it is necessary for test mixtures containing low virus titers to undergo detoxification by molecular sieving, or to use a more sensitive assay such as LVP [26]. In LVP, a high volume of the lowest apparently non-cytotoxic dilution of the inactivation assay test mixture is added to the detector cell line and the cultures are monitored for virus-specific effects. Using this method, larger reductions in virus titer can be shown even at lower viral loads and contact times as short as 15 s can be tested, minimizing the impact of any after effects. LVP offers sufficient sensitivity for reductions in virus titer to be detected even using test products that are highly cytotoxic in cell culture [27].",
