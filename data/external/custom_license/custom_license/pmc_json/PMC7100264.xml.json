Significant illness in both preterm1 and full-term2 infants have been described with RVI. Several respiratory viral pathogens, including coronaviruses, enterovirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus have been reported as possible causes of late-onset sepsis (LOS).3, 4, 5 These viruses are associated with increased length of hospital stay, severe disease, unnecessary antimicrobial exposure and nosocomial outbreaks in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).5, 6, 7 RVI is often underdiagnosed, unrecognized or infrequently examined as a cause of sepsis in infants because of several challenges: the wide range of clinical presentations and their similarity to bacterial infections8 and the unreliable methodology previously used for RVI detection which lacked sensitivity and specificity.3",

Eight infants were excluded from the review for reasons outlined in Figure 1 and 48 were not included with limited or no sepsis evaluation.

The demographics and baseline characteristics of infants included in the study are outlined in Table 1. There was no significant difference in gender or day of life in LOS evaluations for infants with or without a respiratory virus detected. There were, however, significant differences in gestational age, birthweight, evaluation during birth hospitalization and diagnosis of chronic lung disease. These differences may be attributed to the admission of older term infants and the readmission of recently discharged premature infants requiring intensive care support. Cough, nasal congestion, increased work of breathing, lethargy and poor feeding were the statistically significant clinical presentations of infants that prompted concern for RVI and with a respiratory virus detected (Table 2).",

            "text": "There are several limitations identified in this study. The number of enrolled term infants was below the calculated sample size large enough to detect at least 9% difference in the incidence of RVI compared to preterm infants (alpha 0.05, beta 0.05).19 In contrast to other studies, we included all infants being evaluated for LOS requiring intensive care support rather than limiting to those during their birth hospitalization only. This may explain why we did not find a significant difference in the need for mechanical ventilation in infants when a respiratory virus was detected or not. Increasing the number of infants enrolled involving several medical centers with a NICU would allow examining disease severity associated with specific viral types or subtypes. However, in order to enable such a study, the respiratory viral PCR panel would have to be available in the other medical centers. Another limitation to our study is that we do not know the background prevalence of RVI in our NICU and future surveillance studies may be of benefit.",

Especially, among those infants where caregivers have clinical suspicion of viral infections presenting with cough, nasal congestion, lethargy, poor feeding and increased work of breathing. Early recognition can prevent viral outbreaks in the NICU, prompt initiation of appropriate antiviral treatment, enable providers to withhold or discontinue inappropriate antibiotics and contribute to NICU-specific stewardship initiatives. Future research should address issues on colonization versus disease-associated RVI in the NICU. Furthermore, multicenter studies with larger sample sizes should investigate the possibility of associations between specific viral types or subtypes and increased disease severity of RVI or various specific syndromes.",
