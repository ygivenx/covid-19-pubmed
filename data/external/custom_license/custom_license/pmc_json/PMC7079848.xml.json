            "text": "The microarray chip used for diagnostic purpose contain oligonucleotides specific to pathogens and may contain thousands of oligonucleotide probes. The probes designed for diagnostic assays are unique to a specific pathogen with respect to all other pathogen genomes and also to host and other non-specific genome sequence present in the clinical samples. As a result, the designing of pathogen-specific probes require computationally expensive comparison of target genomes with all known non-target sequences. Many methods have been developed for designing probes for pathogen diagnostic assays; some methods are intended for PCR-based assays, whereas others are intended for microarray-based assays [7]. Several groups have designed microarrays containing probes for microbial detection, discovery or a combination of both [2, 3, 5, 9]. The virochip discovery array was one of the first to target a broad range of pathogens; it is best known for its role in characterizing SARS as a coronavirus [10]. Chou et al. [1] designed conserved genus probes and species-specific probes covering 53 viral families and 214 genera. Palacios et al. [3] built the Greenechippm, an array targeting vertebrate viruses and rRNA sequences of fungi, bacteria and protozoa, containing approximately 30,000 probes. Viral probes were designed to target a minimum of three genomic regions for each family or genus, including at least one highly conserved region coding for polymerase or structural proteins, and two or more variable regions. Pan-Microbial Detection Array (MDA) [2] is the most comprehensive chip designed for virus and other pathogen identification. Chou et al. have computationally designed virus-specific and conserved probes for microarray-based diagnosis of viruses using a specifically designed algorithm. We had used conserved probes designed by them and found that some of them do not work experimentally and felt that there is need for a new dataset [1].",

The unique probes table is divided into two fields namely virus name and probe sequence. Similarly, conserved probes table has genus, Sub-group name and probe sequence. All this Information was compiled in MS EXCEL. In the current form, the web database has total of 20,619 unique and 3,988 conserved probes. In the phase two, structured relational database was designed for an easy access by the users of database. For designing the core relational database MS access 2007 was used. In the phase, three databases in MS access were integrated into HTML web pages so that the database could be accessed through out the internet. The dataset in the current form has the look shown in Fig. 1.\n\n",
