The virus-positive specimens comprised 90 specimens with HRSV, 19 with HMPV, and 2 with adenovirus and were taken from hospitalized children with LRTI at Sanggyepaik Hospital from July 2004 through October 2005. LRTI included the diagnoses of bronchiolitis, bronchitis, pneumonia, and laryngotracheobronchitis. The 336 nasopharyngeal samples were consecutively collected at admission, after informed consent was obtained from the children's parents. Common respiratory viruses (HRSV, adenovirus, influenza A and B, parainfluenza) were detected by direct fluorescent-antibody assay kit (Dako Imagen, Cambridgeshire, UK), after admission. The remaining samples were stored at \u201370\u00b0C for further studies. Viral RNA was extracted from each sample by a QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and reverse transcription of 0.5 \u03bcg of each RNA sample was performed. Reverse transcription\u2013PCR was performed to detect HMPV by using F-gene primers (7) and human coronavirus NL-63, by using a 1-a and a 1-b primer, as previously described (8).",

The patients ranged in age from 1 to 37 months of age, and the male-to-female ratio was 2.8:1.The clinical manifestations of HBoV-positive patients were fever (76.4%), cough (76.4%), rhinorrhea (23.5%), gastrointestinal symptoms (11.7%), and rashes (5.8%). Direct sequencing of PCR products of the NS1 gene and NP1 genes showed that most strains had the same sequences (Figure 1 and Figure 2). The prevalence of HBoV in this study was higher than that in previous studies (3.14%\u20135.7%). This variation may be due to differences in the characteristics of the study populations and collection time of respiratory specimens (6,9,11). In our study, the positive rates of HBoV in the nasopharyngeal aspirates of patients with acute LRTI were relatively high. However, the clinical role of HBoV is still unclear because of a high frequency of co-infection (37%), a finding similar to those of previous studies (17.6%\u201355.6%) (6,9). In a future study, additional microbial testing for rhinovirus and coronaviruses, which are known to cause LRTIs, is needed to evaluate the precise rate of detection of >1 virus (12,13).",
