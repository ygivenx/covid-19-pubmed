Infections are not only limited to Asia and\nAfrica; recently, the epidemics of chikungunya have been reported\nfrom Central and South America.1,2 Concerning the data\nobtained from the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme\n(NVBDCP, India), the number of infected people identified in April\n2018 was 9175, 4875 from Karnataka following 1375 from Gujarat and\n966 from Maharashtra. Earlier research studies have shown that there\nis considerable resource burden from chikungunya outbreaks, which\nescalates in monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. Therefore, cases of\nchikungunya viral fever have increased in the continent of Asia and\nvarious parts of the world. The name chikungunya originates from \u201cMakonde\u201d,\nmeaning \u201cto become twisted\u201d. It denotes the \u201ccurved\u201d\nappearance of those going through joint ache as a result of chikungunya\ninfection. Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) spreads by mosquito vectors Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. The common eukaryotic hosts are primates and humans. In humans,\nthe symptoms associated with CHIKV are nausea, fever, joint pain,\nvomiting, rashes, and persistent arthralgia. Clinical manifestation\nis one of the bases for the diagnosis of chikungunya infection, but\nthe confirmation of disease can only be made after laboratory tests.\nSuspected cases are validated by positive anti-Chikungunya virus IgM\nor IgG results or by positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results.3,4",

The New World viruses VEEV, WEEV, etc. use virus capsid\nprotein (CP) to downregulate the host cell transcription, have high\ncasualty frequency, and generate encephalitis.",

Trimers of E1 and E2 (surface glycoproteins) heterodimers\nbuild up every spike.15 CHIKV bears a genome\nof almost \u223c11.7 kb, polyadenylated at the 3\u2032 end and\ncapped at the 5\u2032 end. The non-structural polyproteins (nsP1234)\nare encoded by the 5\u2032 two-third open reading frame (ORF) of\nthe genome. The three chief structural proteins (capsid (C), E1, and\nE2) are encoded by the 3\u2032 one-third ORF of the genome.16 The functioning of non-structural protein (nsP)\npromotes the construction of distinct mature non-structural proteins\n(nsp1\u20134). nsP1 is the capping enzyme, nsP2 is the viral helicase\nand protease, and nsP4 is RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which has\nan intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain.17 The role of nsP3 was not very well defined. However, recently,\nMcPherson et al.18 have reported that CHIKV\u2019s\nnsP3 macrodomain hydrolyzes ADP-ribose groups from mono(ADP-ribosyl)ated\nproteins and the activity of nsP3 mono(ADP-ribosyl)hydrolase is somewhere\ndecisive for CHIKV replication and virulence in mice. At the N-terminus,\nnsP3 encompasses a very preserved MacroD-type macrodomain. The protein\nfold in the macrodomain is remarkably conserved, which is present\nin numerous plus-strand RNA viruses, and it attaches to ADP-ribose.\nMutant viruses missing hydrolase activity were incapable of replicating\nin mammalian BHK-21 cells or mosquito, A. albopictus, cells and quickly regressed the catalytically inactivated mutants.",
