Viral diagnosis was confirmed by serologic tests, and affected individuals were classified in five groups according to World Health Organization criteria: dengue fever (no evidence of plasma leakage) or dengue hemorrhagic fever (evidence of plasma leakage) with increasing severity from grade I to grade IV. The study was restricted to hospitalized school-age children. For dengue fever, we restricted our study to the most symptomatic individuals with dengue fever (classical incapacitating dengue fever)3, excluding those whose only clinical manifestation was fever. Effectively, less severe cases may overlap with undifferentiated fever, which do not require hospitalization and represent, together with asymptomatic cases, most cases of dengue virus infection (\u223c90%) in endemic areas4. In this hospital-based recruitment, the frequency of dengue hemorrhagic fever was 74.9% overall, similar in each hospital; the sex distribution was unbiased; and there was no significant effect of age on disease severity (Supplementary Table 1 online). There was an increased risk of dengue hemorrhagic fever versus dengue fever in individuals who had secondary versus primary dengue infection (odds ratio (OR) = 3.30, P = 2 \u00d7 10\u22125; Supplementary Table 1 online), as previously reported5.",

We sequenced the exons and promoter regions of these two genes in 80 Thai individuals and found limited LD between CD209 and both genes, with \u0394 values <0.75, except for one SNP located 3\u2032 to CLEC4M that showed strong association with four SNPs in CD209 (\u0394 > 0.95) that were not associated with disease (Supplementary Fig. 1 online). All \u0394 values of CLEC4M and CLEC4G SNPs with DCSIGN1-336 were <0.27 (Supplementary Table 4 online). Therefore, it is unlikely that this effect is related to variants in these two flanking genes.

This site affects multiple predicted transcription factor binding sites for Sp1/GATA1/CACCC- and CAC-binding transcription factors, of the type GGGTGGG, with allele G (underlined) associated with the presence of binding sites, and allele A with its absence. This sequence was conserved in the homologous gene CD209L, with a G at the corresponding position7. We carried out electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) by incubating HeLa nuclear extracts with two alternative 22-nucleotide probes differing at the DCSIGN1-336 position (Fig. 2a,b). The G variant showed increased Sp1 binding capacity compared with the A variant, which was effectively competed by the Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide. This suggests that the DCSIGN1-336 variant affects the binding of Sp1 and possibly other transcription factors that modulate transcriptional activity, supporting the idea that is has a functional role in the transcriptional regulation of CD209. It probably does not affect the tissue specificity of expression, which is controlled by sequences outside of the promoter7.",

First, there may be differential interaction between dengue virus and CD209, depending on the genetic variability of the dengue virus strain, which affects both the level of infectivity of CD209-expressing dendritic cells2 and the viral virulence14. Second, in dengue hemorrhagic fever, there may be an alternative pathway to the CD209-mediated dengue virus entry to dendritic cells. The high viral load observed in dengue hemorrhagic fever may be caused by the antibody-enhanced dengue virus infection of monocytes through Fc\u03b3 receptors in individuals with pre-existing dengue virus antibodies (antibody-dependant enhancement). Previous studies have reported some association of polymorphisms in HLA class I, TNF\u03b1 and Fc\u03b3 receptor IIA genes with dengue hemorrhagic fever15,16,17,18,19,20. Notably, some HLA alleles were specifically associated with the risk of dengue fever rather than dengue hemorrhagic fever18. Overall, the risk of infection and disease severity probably results from complex interactions between CD209 variability and other host and viral factors, whose elucidation requires further detailed investigations.",

Diagnosis was established by expert clinicians in each center, following World Health Organization criteria as follows. Individuals suspected to have dengue viral infection on the basis of clinical features including high fever, severe headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, arthalgia, nausea and vomiting, and rash were admitted to the hospitals for clinical observation and treatment. The diagnosis of dengue virus infection was later confirmed by a comparable dengue-specific IgG and IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay titer on a late acute or convalescent sera27. Differential diagnosis of dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever was established on the basis of the absence (dengue fever) or presence (dengue hemorrhagic fever) of evidence for increased vascular permeability manifested by hemoconcentration or pleural effusion. Specifically, the diagnosis of dengue hemorrhagic fever was made on the basis of the four following characteristics: (i) high continuous fever lasting 2\u20137 d, (ii) hemorrhagic tendency such as a positive tourniquet test, petechii, purpura or hematemesis, (iii) thrombocytopenia (platelet count \u2265100,000 \u03bcl\u22121and (iv) evidence of plasma leakage due to increased vascular permeability manifested by hemoconcentration (an increased in hematocrit of 20% or more) or pleural effusion. The severity of dengue hemorrhagic fever was categorized in four grades according to World Health Organization criteria3. Grades III and IV were dengue hemorrhagic fever with narrowing pulse pressure with a characteristically elevated diastolic pressure to profound shock. In the three cohorts, clinical and biological data were recorded during their hospitalization and stored into a database.",

At Khon-Kaen Hospital, clinical and biological recording was more systematic and was computerized from the start of the study, and this detailed information was used to complement the dengue status established by clinicians. In cohort KK, hematocrit measurements were done at least four times a day, and up to every hour during the critical period of defeverescence. Because of the detailed biological data collected in this cohort, we made the differential diagnosis of dengue hemorrhagic fever grade I versus dengue fever on the basis of evidence of plasma leakage (increased hematocrit of 20% or more), whereas dengue hemorrhagic fever grades II\u2013IV was established by the clinicians. Secondary infection was defined as a dengue-specific IgM/IgG ratio <1.8.",

Similarly, we identified polymorphisms in CLEC4M and CLEC4G in 48 individuals with dengue and 32 controls using primers shown in Supplementary Table 5 online. We analyzed sequencing results by Genalys Software28. We also carried out a direct investigation of a repeated region in exon 4 (ref. 29) in 96 cases and 96 controls, which extended the identification of DCSIGN1.ex4RPT and DCSIGN1.ex4SF polymorphisms. Only three rare variants (<2%) affected the coding regions of the protein: two amino acid substitutions and one variation in the number of repeats of a 23-amino-acid unit located in the predicted extracellular domain29 (Supplementary Table 2 online). The other polymorphisms were located in introns (8), in the promoter or 5\u2032 region of the gene (6), in the 3\u2032 untranslated region (21) or 3\u2032 to the gene (2). Sixteen of these polymorphisms were located in repeat sequences. Twenty-seven of these polymorphisms had a rare allele frequency >0.02. We genotyped DCSIGN1-336, DCSIGN1-139, DCSIGN1.in2+11, DCSIGN1.ex4SF and DCSIGN1.2281 using PCR-RFLP assays and DCSIGN1.ex4RPT by PCR and agarose gel electrophoresis (Supplementary Table 6 online). We genotyped DCSIGN1-336, DCSIGN1.in5-178, DCSIGN1.ex6TI, DCSIGN1.in6-37, DCSIGN1.3197 and DCSIGN1.3852 by TaqMan assay (Supplementary Table 7 online) using ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System, with recommended protocols. We genotyped DCSIGN1-336 in duplicate, using both methods, with identical results. We tested deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in individuals with dengue disease and in controls, in each cohort and overall, and found that it was not statistically significant for any SNP. We carried out heterogeneity testing for the origin of cohort for each polymorphism in individuals with dengue disease and in controls and found that it was not significant.",
