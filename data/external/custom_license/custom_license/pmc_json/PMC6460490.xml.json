They can cause life-threatening infections in immunocompromised individuals with up to 40% mortality.1\nCandida albicans is a commensal in the mucosal tissues, predominantly found in the gastrointestinal tract of most humans. Of all Candida spp., C. albicans accounts for >60% of the clinical cases.1 In a mouse model of systemic candidiasis, the kidney was the only organ showing a sustained increase in fungal burden, which was associated with immunopathology and organ failure.2 Thus animal models of systemic candidiasis can be a useful tool to evaluate C. albicans-induced renal pathology.",

DC-SIGN expression on the intestinal epithelial cells is elevated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.9 Infection by Helicobacter pylori enhances the expression of DC-SIGN and co-stimulatory molecules on human gastric epithelial cells.10 DC-SIGN is co-expressed with nephrin on podocytes in the renal tissues of patients with lupus nephritis.11 There is a significant correlation between DC-SIGN expression on the tubulointerstitium and the severity of tubulointerstitial lesions.12 Thus it appears that the expression of DC-SIGN on non-immune cells may modulate the outcomes of the disease.",

Transgenic mice displayed reduced lung damage and prolonged survival after mycobacterial infection.18 A recent report showed that silencing DC-SIGN on IL-4-treated human monocyte-derived macrophages enhances M. tuberculosis-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine production.19 These findings showed that DC-SIGN expression on myeloid cells affects the pathogenesis of mycobacterial infection.

            "text": "Renal fibrosis is the common end point of chronic kidney disease, leading to kidney failure.21 It can be considered an improper wound-healing process. When under mechanical stress or upon stimulation by cytokines, resident fibroblasts terminally differentiate into myofibroblasts. Myofibroblasts play a critical role during fibrosis by producing extracellular matrix (ECM) and crosslinking enzymes and inhibitors of matrix degrading metalloproteinases.22 Fully developed myofibroblasts express \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), vimentin, and extra-domain A of fibronectin.22 Their persistence results in excessive ECM deposition and pathological wound healing leading to kidney failure. Factors including transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2, fibroblast growth factor-2, platelet-derived growth factor, insulin-like growth factor-1, IL-1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IL-6, and angiotensin II are potential mediators of fibrosis.23\u201325 Among them, TGF-\u03b2 is considered a key mediator in fibrotic diseases.23\u201325 There are three TGF-\u03b2 isoforms, namely, TGF-\u03b21, 2, and 3, in mammals. TGF-\u03b21 is the most abundant isoform and the one that is most involved in renal fibrosis.26 Results from studies in both patients and animal disease models have shown that TGF-\u03b2 is upregulated during kidney injury.23,27",

SIGNR1 was not detectable in the kidney of littermates and transgenic expression of DC-SIGN did not increase its expression (Suppl Fig. 3). Immunohistochemical staining of kidney sections further revealed that DC-SIGN expression was localized to LTL (LTL+) renal proximal tubular epithelial cells but not to DBA (DBA+) distal tubular epithelial cells (Fig 1b, c). It is interesting to note that there were a very small number of DC-SIGN+ cells that were neither LTL+ nor DBA+ (Fig. 1c).",

While there was a dip on day 4 in control mice, fungal burdens in the kidney of transgenic mice on days 4 and 6 remained as high as that on day 2 (Fig. 2a). Masson\u2019s trichrome staining revealed that infection induced collagen deposition in both transgenic and control mice, but the area of deposition in the transgenic mice was significantly less than in control mice (Fig. 2b, c). Transgenic mice had more intact glomeruli, less renal tubular regeneration, and less prominent renal interstitial fibrosis than control mice (Fig. 2b). qPCR analysis showed that the levels of Col1a2 (type I collagen), Col3a1 (type III collagen), and Col4a1 (type IV collagen) transcripts were significantly lower in transgenic mice than in control mice (Fig. 2d\u2013f).

Immunohistochemical staining of a lung section from a SARS patient revealed that both alveolar macrophages and pneumocytes expressed DC-SIGN.36 A recent report showed that serum amyloid P and DC-SIGN ligand inhibit the innate immune response to reduce bleomycin-induced fibrosis through binding to SIGN-R1 on mouse lung epithelial cells.37 A significant correlation also exists between DC-SIGN expression on renal tubular epithelial cells and the severity of tubulointerstitial lesions in the kidney.12 In this study, we demonstrated in transgenic mice that DC-SIGN expression in renal proximal tubular epithelial cells reduces their ability to produce TGF-\u03b21 in response to systemic C. albicans infection and thus attenuates candidiasis-induced renal fibrosis.

RT-PCR results demonstrated that hDC-SIGN transcripts were expressed in all of the tissues we examined in the transgenic mice, although the levels of expression varied. Specifically, DC-SIGN is expressed in kidney proximal tubular epithelial cells. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study employing a mouse model to assess the role of hDC-SIGN on non-immune cells in a host response to an infection.",

Infection by uropathogenic Escherichia coli causes pyelonephritis, which may eventually lead to chronic kidney disease and fibrosis.39 Infection by Leptospira interrogans induces renal fibrosis through iNOS-dependent, Toll-like receptor- and NOD-like receptor-independent signaling pathways.40 Renal fibrosis is a rare presentation of clinical candidiasis. It was reported in 2012 that a 61-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and urinary bladder urothelial carcinoma status had clinical presentation of a mass in the kidney that was later diagnosed as renal candidiasis. Histological staining showed that the kidney had high levels of fungal elements and was fibrotic with evidence of acute and chronic inflammation and abscesses.41 Another report described a 23-year-old man receiving methylprednisolone pulse therapy for asthma who experienced acute kidney injury and renal function deterioration. The patient had high serum levels of \u03b2-D-glucan and was diagnosed with C. albicans infection in both kidneys; the kidneys had severe interstitial cell infiltration with granulomatous formation and fibrosis.42 We showed here unequivocally by trichrome staining as well as qPCR that intravenous C. albicans infection leads to renal fibrosis (collagen deposition) in the late phase of infection, an observation that has not been described before. Furthermore, hDC-SIGN expression in mouse renal proximal tubular epithelial cells mitigates C. albicans-induced renal fibrosis without affecting the fungal burden.",

In human and experimental disease models, there is a close correlation between macrophage infiltration and fibrosis.23,43 In a mouse model of ischemia/reperfusion, a large number of F4/80+ macrophages were found to infiltrate the ischemically injured kidney. Mannose receptor-positive macrophages isolated from the kidney on day 7 after reperfusion had high levels of Tgfb1 transcripts.44 There are at least six distinct cell types with mesenchymal phenotypes in the kidney. Potentially all of these resident cells can produce TGF-\u03b21.26 Diwakar et al. showed that albumin induces TGF-\u03b21 production by proximal tubular epithelial cells from opossum and human kidneys.45 In mouse unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) models, UUO-induced injury increases the expression of TGF-\u03b21 by epithelium.29 We showed in this study that neither CD45+ infiltrating cells nor the mesenchymal (vimentin+) cells are the source of TGF-\u03b21 in systemic candidiasis. Rather, it is renal proximal tubular epithelial cells that are responsible for TGF-\u03b21 production. While renal proximal tubular epithelial cells are the source of TGF-\u03b21, expression of DC-SIGN reduces their ability to produce TGF-\u03b21.",

It is interesting to note that depleting TGF-\u03b2 by a neutralizing antibody resulted in not only attenuated fibrosis but also a reduction of fungal burden. It is reasonable to speculate that TGF-\u03b2 also plays an anti-inflammatory role in systemic candidiasis.

There exists an apparent inverse relationship between Raf-1 and p38 activation and JNK and ERK1/2 phosphorylation.
