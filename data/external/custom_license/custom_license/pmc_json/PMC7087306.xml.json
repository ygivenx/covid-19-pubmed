Codon usage analysis has been applied to prokaryotes and eukaryotes, such as Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans and human beings [4, 16, 25, 27]. Some reports have shown that codon usage bias had a high correlation to tRNA abundance, GC content, mRNA secondary structure, exon splicing constraints, translation rate and gene expression level [12, 18, 26] . The study of codon usage can provide some evidence about the molecular evolution of the viruses. It can also enrich our understanding about the relationship between viruses and their hosts by analyzing their codon usage patterns.",

Based on a comparison of the 5\u2019 untranslated region (UTR) and the Npro- and E2-encoding sequences [23, 30], BVDV can be divided into two different genotypes: BVDV-1 and BVDV-2 [21, 22]. The genome of each genotypes contains a single positive-stranded RNA with a size of approximately 12.3 kb, consisting of a single large open reading frame (ORF) flanked by 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 untranslated regions [6, 8]. The BVDV strains can grow in epithelial cell cultures with cytopathic (CP) or noncytopathic (NCP) effect [17].",

Three BVDV-1 strains isolated from Asia were different from other BVDV-1 strains, implying that the strains isolated from Asia were distantly related to American or European strains. However, the strains from American were more closely related to those from Europe than to those from Asia. The low diversity in BVDV-2 might result from the limited number of samples. It is most likely that the codon usage bias in BVDV is related to genotype and geographic factors.",

This adaptability makes it possible for the virus to survive in the host cell and to use the components of the cell to produce more of itself. However, there is no evidence that the viruses are generally adapted to the codon usage patterns of their host (AUU, CUA, AGG, and AUA), and this is consistent with mutational bias theory [1]. Although it has been reported that isolate 14 was first found in swine, its nucleotide content is similar to that of strains originating from cattle, suggesting that strain 14 is also a possible cattle-origin virus.",
