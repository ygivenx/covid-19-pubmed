According to the World Health Organization, S. pneumoniae is the leading cause of severe pneumonia worldwide in children younger than 5 years old, causing more than one million deaths in children each year [19]. Empyema, one of the most severe complications of bacterial pneumonia, has been reported in 20% to 30% of all cases in Utah of USA [2]. Although the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease has decreased since the use of pneumococcal conjugated vaccine (PCV) [4], developed countries such as USA have seen an emergence of empyema and necrotizing pneumonia episodes caused by nonvaccine serotypes [1, 3]. In Taiwan, the represented pneumococcal serotypes in hospitalized children with invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPD) were serotypes 14, 19F, 3, 6B, and 23F, and the seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines covered 73% of IPD cases in children aged between 2 and 4 years and 65% of cases in children aged <2 years [11, 12]. To date, little research has been done into the epidemiology and population-based incidence of pneumococcal/lobar pneumonia and empyema in the Asian and subtropical areas.",

The current study, however, found incidence of pneumococcal/lobar pneumonia to reach a peak between the ages of 4 and 5 years old. The age distribution pattern of empyema cases was similar to that of pneumococcal/lobar pneumonia. The difference in age distribution may be due to the greater number of virus etiologies causing pneumonia in younger children [14, 17] as well as the higher colonization rates of pneumococci in kindergarteners [13]. One 1998 study reported pneumococcal carriage rate to be 19.9% in northern Taiwan population and the isolation rate to be higher in children aged between 2 and 5 years [13]. Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that high pneumococcus colonization rate may contribute to peak in incidence of lobar/pneumococcal pneumonia and empyema in this age group. Furthermore, this population might benefit from a universal pneumococcal vaccination program since seven-valent conjugated vaccine can cover about 70% of IPD cases in this age group in Taiwan [12].",

This seasonal distribution is similar to that of influenza because the viral surveillance of Taiwan Centers for Disease Control between 2002 and 2004 demonstrated that influenza A and influenza B viruses had a obvious seasonal variation, with peak incidence from the fifth to 14th week every year during our study period in Taiwan [6], and it was compatible to the peak pneumococcal/lobar pneumonia incidence in the spring (February to April) in this study. It suggests that both are seasonal diseases and may be interrelated in Taiwan.",

In our study, the rate (34%) of requiring intensive care was relatively high, which could be explained by some less severe cases who were admitted to intensive care unit for just close monitoring of vital signs.

The morbidity and case fatality rates of children with pneumococcal/lobar pneumonia were significantly higher because of empyema complications. To date, Taiwan has no universal PCV inoculation program for younger children, a population that this study finds most susceptible to pneumococcal pneumonia and empyema. A universal inoculation of PCV may be able to provide maximum protection from this disease and prevent most episodes of pneumococcal/lobar pneumonia and empyema across the region in the future.",
