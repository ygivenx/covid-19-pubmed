Arguments that rationalized the abandonment of patients in previous epidemics include futility when medicine is powerless to help and the depletion of finite resources when physicians fall ill [3]. If obligations can be legitimized, however, and if the medical profession as a whole does have a societal duty, then to which individuals within the profession does this responsibility fall? Some limits in the level of risk will be needed for these obligations to be practically binding, and society will need to question the extent to which doctors have to endanger their lives for public good. There will inevitably be reciprocal demands on society by such physicians who face a disproportionate burden of risks. Barriers to the ability to render aid need to be overcome with the appropriate resources and planning. Standards of care may have to be adjusted and the legal repercussions of these adjusted standards need to be addressed. The present review will confront all these issues in order to aid pandemic planning.",

Clark has highlighted that the obligation to assist at such a juncture involves four factors: need, proximity, capability and last resort [5] (see also [6]). The greater the need, the greater the responsibility to help; therefore, the duties that physicians will have are in part dictated by the extent of the need. If influenza does strike in pandemic proportions, this need is likely to be tremendous. The planning assumptions for a 1957-like moderate pandemic estimates 45 million people seeking outpatient care in the United States and 865,000 requiring hospitalization [7]. The number of people needing hospitalization would rise to nearly 10 million, with about 1.5 million in an intensive care setting, should a 1918-like severe pandemic strike [7].",

These commitments are enshrined in classical professional ethics as values such as beneficence and justice. Moreover, professional codes dating back to the American Medical Association code of 1847 have repeatedly affirmed the moral duty to treat the sick during pestilence despite personal risks [5]. As members of a profession who have taken advantage of its contract with society to reap social rewards, it is then onerous on physicians to commit to the obligations of the profession when called upon to do so [5].

The infection risk to medical professionals therefore becomes part of the baseline risks assumed by all who continue to provide frontline healthcare. After a case definition was established for SARS and infection control was instituted, the transmission among healthcare workers fell precipitously [19]. The infections in the healthcare profession that followed were attributable to either lapse in infection control or to close contact during high-risk pulmonary aerosol-generating procedures [20].

International experience with SARS confirms that, with adequate protective equipment, most healthcare professionals continued to turn up for work. Availability of personal protection will reduce ill-conceived heroism whereby doctors fall ill by rushing to treat victims unprotected. These ill doctors will compound the crisis by concurrently increasing the numbers who need treatment and decreasing those who can provide care [5,12]. Priority to healthcare workers in vaccine and chemoprophylaxis allocation as well as adequate protective equipment is therefore justified by the principles of optimizing effectiveness and maximizing benefits. These reciprocal demands for logistics support by physicians need to be proportional to the extent of risk faced in order to facilitate a just distribution of scarce resources [23].",

Perhaps insisting on every physician having a family emergency plan that outlines how the family will function in a pandemic should be part of annual performance reviews and hiring decisions [17]. Logistical support that will be needed for physicians' other childcare/eldercare obligations and transportation/lodging needs have to be addressed before a crisis [17]. Realistic financial incentives for the extra risk and hours have to be worked out, and predictable compensation must be available to the families of those who succumb to disease [2].
