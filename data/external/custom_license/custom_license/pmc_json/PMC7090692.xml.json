Other terms that often used interchangeably, in conjunction with, or under the umbrella of telemedicine, include telehealthcare, telemonitoring, e-health, e-care, ambient assisted living, smart homecare etc. All these terminologies, though, have the same objectives of delivering remote healthcare to an individual\u2019s home and enabling continuous health monitoring and emergency management.",

With unaccommodating transportation, and crowed hospitals and clinics in most cities, it is difficult for the elderlies and physically challenged to venture out of their homes to meet with health professionals for the needed treatment or for their routine clinical check-ups. Similarly, healthcare delivery in remote rural areas is a demanding endeavour. Having the capability of delivering healthcare services at the patients\u2019 home not only saves a great deal in monetary and human resources, but it also reduces response time in emergency situations. This is especially beneficial in the case where a large number of patients can be dealt with via communication technologies quickly from a centralized location without sending medical personnel to their individual homes.",

Within the European Community, there were the HHH (home or hospital in heart failure) trials of a low-cost, self-managed home monitoring system for patients with chronic heart failures (Pinna et al. 2003). It was found that monthly home telemonitoring of cardiorespiratory signals being sent to a centralized interactive voice responding system is feasible and patients\u2019 compliance is high. The SM4All (Smart hoMes for ALL) project initiated by the European commission aims to provide a middleware platform for pervasive embedded service in a smart environment (Baldoni 2009). The objectives of SM4All are to provide dependability, scalability, privacy and security to users with disabilities.",

To properly introduce smart environment in telemedicine and emergency management, the fundamental technologies, potential applications, their evaluations, and future directions are presented in a sequential coherent perspective. Section 2 introduces smart environment enabling technologies including communication, sensor and sensor network. Applications of smart telemedicine technologies for specific diseases, emergency management, and the elderly and physically challenged, are presented in Sect. 3. Target user groups\u2019 concerns and healthcare professionals\u2019 evaluation of telemedicine and smart homecare systems are discussed in Sect. 4. In the concluding Sect. 5, challenges, concerns and issues related to smart homecare are considered, and future trends of smart homecare environment are identified.",
