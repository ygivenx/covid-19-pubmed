            "text": "Acute neuroinflammation occurs in response to damage due to infection or tissue injury. During this process, cellular factors induce the recruitment of circulating immune cells into the central nervous system. These cells upregulate their expression of immunological signals, recruiting additional cells. This feedback expression of low levels of these immune molecules over long periods of time promotes various pathological effects, including demyelination. Main cytokines regulating inflammatory response include (1) interleukins that are responsible for communication between lymphocytes, (2) chemokines that promote chemotaxis, and (3) interferons with an anti-viral effect. During the past years, we have studied the overinduction of those immune mediators in the majority of the glial cell population, the astrocytes, as a consequence of its infection by the demyelinating Theiler\u2019s virus.",

The intracerebral infection of its low-neurovirulence BeAn strain in demyelination-susceptible strains of mice (including SJL/J and SJL/H strains) is currently used as an experimental model for studying human demyelination processes such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Animals that survive the acute phase disease develop chronic demyelination. This is followed by lymphoid cell infiltration into the brain, a delayed type hypersensitivity reaction (DTH) and myelin destruction (Lipton and Dal Canto 1976; Clatch et al. 1986; Roos et al. 1982).",

            "text": "According to its chemoattracting capacity, the CXC family of chemokines is divided into two subfamilies. The first one, to which CXCL12/SDF-1\u03b1 belongs, regulates the migration of naive T lymphocytes to secondary lymphoid tissues for activation (Kim and Broxmeyer 1999). The second one, comprising the chemokines CXCL10/IP10 and CXCL9/Mig, induces the trafficking of activated antigen-specific T cells to virus-infected inflammation sites (Dufour et al. 2002). The members of this second subfamily are critical for the control of infections, including corneal or genital herpes simplex virus infections (Thapa et al. 2008; Wuest et al. 2006), as well as for T cell\u2013mediated suppression of cutaneous tumors (Gorbachev et al. 2007). Members of this family also contribute to the protective T cell response of the CNS against mouse hepatitis virus infection in C57BL/mice (Liu et al. 2001). In a situation of strong neuroinflammation, as our experimental model of TMEV-produced MS-like syndrome in mice, a clear role for chemokines inducing the recruitment of specific CD4+ T cells to sites of inflammation inside the CNS should be expected. In the present study, we experimentally show that chemokines of this class (Mig) are synthesized by TMEV-infected astrocyte in culture.",

The production of Mig by astrocytes in vitro predicts the recruitment of TMEV-specific activated T cells in vivo, after crossing the BBB.

The DNA hybridization results were further validated by RT-PCR and qPCR (Fig. 2). Both techniques confirmed an increase in mRNA when using Mig-specific primers. A biologically active Mig chemokine, which can be detected and quantified by a specific ELISA assay (Fig. 3), is released to the culture medium by infected astrocytes. A clear chemoattraction effect for activated T cells was demonstrated in the supernatants of infected astrocyte cultures (Fig. 5). Specifically, the murine CD4+ T helper cell clone D10, which is continuously activated in the presence of recombinant IL-2 (Ojeda et al. 1995), was strongly chemoattracted by these supernatants. Conversely, no activity due to chemokines attracting resting (CD3+) T lymphocytes was detected in the supernatants studied. These experimental facts demonstrate that the chemoattracting mediators produced in this system are specific for activated T cells and not for naive or resting T cells.",
