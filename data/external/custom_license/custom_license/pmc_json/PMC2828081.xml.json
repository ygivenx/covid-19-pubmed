This sampling program was repeated in November and December of 2005 and again in April and May 2006. The fecal samples were placed into sterile containers, shipped overnight on ice, and stored frozen. Bovine fecal samples (N = 179) were collected from May to October 2006 from 45 different dairy farms in Canada. In this sampling program, farms were sampled only once each; 4 composite samples were taken at each farm, 1 each from calf pens (fresh), milking cow pens (fresh), heifer pens (fresh), and storage pits (stored). The dairy cattle samples were also placed into sterile containers, shipped overnight on ice, and stored frozen. A total of 156 retail meat samples were purchased, 15 at a time, during January\u2013March 2006, and 6 at a time during July\u2013November 2006. The last purchase consisted of only 4 samples. Each purchase was equally divided between samples of raw chicken, beef, and pork, except for the last, which had 1 extra chicken sample.",

According to the region B sequence analysis, 3 different genotypes of NoV were detected in the Canadian pig samples (Figure 1), belonging to the swine GII.11 cluster (18), the swine GII.18 cluster (15), and the human GII.4 (Farmington Hills) cluster (14) (Figure 1). There were 22 strains of the swine GII.18 type, 6 of the swine GII.11 type, and 4 of the human GII.4 type; 2 samples contained both a swine GII.11 and a swine GII.18 virus. Sequences on both strands for the entire 172-bp region were obtained for 11 swine GII.18 viruses, 1 swine GII.11 virus, and 4 human GII.4 viruses. The 11 swine GII.18 strains had pairwise nucleotide identities ranging from 82% to 99% with no 2 identical strains (data not shown). Sequences from 2 of the 4 detected human strains were identical to each other and to the Farmington Hills reference strain (CE-M-05\u20130045 and CE-M-05\u20130102, Figure 2). The other 2 human NoV sequences amplified from swine manure were not identical to any other known sequences (CE-M-06\u20130013 and CE-M-05\u20130114, Figure 2). None of the amplicons sequenced were identical to the laboratory strains that we routinely use in our research activities (BMH-06\u2013001 and BCCDC-04\u2013684, Figure 2). Reasons for the incomplete sequencing of the remaining strains include low concentrations of RNA and overlapping peaks in portions of the chromatograms. A single representative of each group is shown in Figure 1 for clarity.",

Second, pigs may be co-infected with both a human and a swine strain of NoV, potentially leading to recombination and generation of a new NoV strain with altered virulence properties. We did not identify GII.18-like and GII.4-like NoVs from the same manure sample; however, on 3 separate occasions, we detected both a GII.4-like and a GII.18-like NoV from the same farm on the same sampling date.

Interestingly, the region A sequence did not share >77% identity with any of the NoV strains in the GenBank database. Phylogenetic comparisons to the standard viruses described by Zheng et al. (14) were not successful in assigning a genogroup and cluster for this sequence; bootstrap values were 16%\u201340% for most branches in the tree (data not shown). A large grouping of strains did emerge in this analysis, showing that in region A, this NoV strain was more closely related to GII.1, GII.2, GII.3, GII.4, GII.5, GII.10, GII.12, and GIII.1 sequences than to the other reference strains (data not shown). This finding indicates that the viruses detected and characterized as GII.4 NoV by using region B primers from swine and bovine manure (Figures 1 and 2) may represent novel NoV types, with genetic content slightly different from the previously recognized human, swine, and bovine-type species. This finding would also explain the difficulty we have had in obtaining region A, C, and D amplicons from the other manure samples (data not shown).",

Retail samples have not been previously tested as part of a surveillance scheme for the presence of NoV. Our findings support previous suggestions that NoV may have a zoonotic route of transmission to humans (15). It follows that infected humans may pass the virus to livestock as well, and some outbreaks of gastroenteritis in farm animals may be prevented by controlling the access of ill workers to livestock. Our results also highlight the possibility that a recombinant swine/human or bovine/human NoV could emerge with altered tropism or virulence characteristics. In conclusion, we stress the importance of monitoring existing and emerging NoV strains to mitigate the potential impact of a recombinant NoV\u2019s being transmitted to the human population from either a swine or a bovine source.",
