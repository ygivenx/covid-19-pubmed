In IFA, monolayers of Vero cells infected with SARS-CoV at a multiplicity of infection of 0.02 TCID50/cell were methanol-fixed 24 h postinfection, exposed to a range of serum dilutions, and bound antibody detected by using fluorescein isothiocyanate\u2013conjugated protein A (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD). Groups of samples that reacted positively in either VNT or IFA were also subjected to Western blot analysis with a recombinant SARS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein expressed in Escherichia coli. Bound antibodies were detected by using alkaline phosphatase\u2013conjugated protein A/G (Pierce, Rockford, IL).",

Animals selected from one market in Guangzhou in January 2004 had a much higher prevalence of SARS-CoV antibodies than those selected from farms in the same period or from farms in two other provinces in June 2003. These results raise the possibility that civets, rather than being the natural animal reservoir of SARS-CoV, are infected mainly in markets or during other trade-related activities. Our results suggest that mass slaughter of civets on farms might not be necessary to control SARS-CoV spread. A more effective approach might be to implement testing in live animal markets and farms for susceptible animals and to apply quarantine regulation and targeted slaughter for markets or farms with infected animals.",

Third, although civets are in high demand in Guangdong Province, they are expensive, so a batch of animals may remain in a storehouse for weeks. All of these factors facilitate interspecies transmission, which would be followed by rapid transmission among the civet population. Finally, civet farming and trading has been in practice in China for >10 years, but SARS has not been observed in workers until recently, which points to a recent introduction of SARS-CoV in the civet population in markets.",

One important observation from this study was that patients who became ill early in the epidemic were more likely than those who became ill later to report living near a produce market but not near a farm, which supports the notion that no widespread SARS-CoV infection occurred among farmed animals.",

These animals were collected in the same market at the same time, but they originated in different regions of southern China; consequently, most, if not all, of these animals were likely infected in the market. In addition, SARS-CoV infection was also observed in at least one raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides) and one Chinese ferret-badger (Melogale moschata) from the same market at the same time, which demonstrates possible interspecies SARS-CoV transmission during trading. Sequence analysis of the S genes showed that one civet isolate (SZ16) was more closely related to the raccoon dog isolate (SZ13) than the other two civet isolates (SZ1 and SZ3), which further supports interspecies transmission in the market (4). Since that study, several experimental infection studies have shown most mammalian species tested to be susceptible to SARS-CoV infection (5\u20139), and animal-to-animal transmission can occur under experimental conditions as well (6). Caution should be taken in determining the origin of SARS-CoV; data collected from markets where a wide variety of species are housed in close proximity may be unreliable.",

However, this study is a first step in investigating the role of civets in transmitting SARS-CoV. Much remains to be done, including studies on the prevalence of infection with SARS-CoV and related coronaviruses that use more robust methods to sample susceptible animals in markets, farms, and the wild. Improved serologic tests should be developed that can detect SARS-CoV\u2013specific antibodies from different animal species, without relying on live SARS-CoV. Other issues that remain to be resolved include the rate of new infections in susceptible animal species, the characteristics of the animals that become infected, and the nature of the exposures that lead to interspecies transmission.",
