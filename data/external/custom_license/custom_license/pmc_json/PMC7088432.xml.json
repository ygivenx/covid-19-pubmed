Besides, the dysfunction of the alimentary tract can impair digestion and increase susceptibility of animals to various digestive and immunometabolic alterations (Radostits et al. 2007; Youssef et al. 2017). Among the few reported systemic consequences of digestive troubles, acute phase response (APR) still receiving a few attention in buffalo species (Youssef et al. 2017). The APR, which is a component of the innate immune response, is initiated when animals are subjected to various internal or external challenges, which release cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-\u03b1) (Johnson 1997). These pro-inflammatory cytokines induce local and systemic reactions such as pyrexia, leukocytosis, hormonal variations, and muscle protein depletion which stimulate the hepatic release of acute phase proteins (APPs) (Yoshioka et al. 2002).",

Up to now, there have been several studies that described the cytokine profile and the inflammatory response in buffaloes suffering from rumen drinking (El-Ashker et al. 2012), traumatic reticuloperitonitis (TRP) (El-Ashker et al. 2013, 2014), or bronchopneumonia (El-Bahr and El-Deeb 2013). In those literatures, the authors have measured the circulating levels of some inflammatory markers by using ELISA kits. However, to the best of the author\u2019s knowledge, there has been little information about gene expression of inflammatory cytokines in buffaloes showing some digestive disorders particularly stomatitis, acute TRP, acute rumen impaction, and enteritis. In addition, the influence of those disorders on the status of immunoglobulin (Ig) has not yet been studied. The objective of the present study was to explore the modulation of the gene expression of some immune-inflammatory markers including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-\u03b1, IgG, and IgA in buffaloes demonstrating the aforementioned digestive disorders. Our hypothesis was that these disorders would have significant inflammatory reactions or could alter the immune status of diseased buffaloes.",

The studied animals were raised at different farms in Dakahlia governorate in the period between October 2015 and April 2016. Forty of these buffaloes showed various clinical symptoms including decreased appetite, signs of dehydration, teeth grinding, lowered milk yield, weight loss, lacrimation, and grunting with arched back. Some buffaloes exhibited obvious abdominal distention, and voluminous diarrhea, while others demonstrated pyrexia, profuse watery diarrhea and straining. All animals were thoroughly examined and the clinical observations were recorded. Based on the competent case history and the associating clinical findings, the investigated animals were categorized into four groups of equal sizes including uncategorized stomatitis, acute TRP, acute rumen impaction, and undifferentiated enteritis. Ten apparently healthy buffaloes, within the same range of age and BW, were randomly selected from the same farms and were considered as a control group. Animals included in this study had solely digestive disorder with no concurrent diseases and being enrolled with owner\u2019s consent and were given information about the economic impact and the potential clinical consequences of the studied ailments.",

Previous reports have described the cytokine profile, as well as the inflammatory reaction in buffalo showing several clinical entities (Eckersall et al. 2001; Nazifi et al. 2008; El-Ashker et al. 2012, 2013; El-Bahr and El-Deeb 2013; Youssef et al. 2017). In the current investigation, diseased buffaloes had upregulation of the expression of mRNAs of all tested proinflammatory markers compared with those of controls. This intensive inflammatory reaction was simultaneously associated with a compensatory anti-inflammatory reaction, during which the anti-inflammatory cytokines, i.e., IL-10, was upregulated. The mechanism for stimulation of APP production has been documented by the proinflammatory cytokines (Baumann and Gauldie 1994). The authors added that the inflammatory cytokines are the primary inducers of APP gene expression and each type initiates a different pattern of APP. Nearly similar findings concerning such elevated levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in inflammation and infection were previously observed in pigs (Reeth and Nauwynck 2000) or cattle (Pace et al. 1993; Horadagoda et al. 1994; Yoo et al. 1995; Morsey et al. 1999; Gruys et al. 2005). Similarly, the early and sustained expressions of acute phase cytokines have been reported to elevate in the airways and lung lesions of cattle experimentally infected with Pasteurella haemolytica where TNF-\u03b1, IL-1, and IL-8 mRNA were particularly expressed (Malazdrewich et al. 2001). A statistically significant high serum values of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-10 have been recorded in adult buffaloes suffering from TRP (El-Ashker et al. 2013), being higher in non-survived cases than survivors (El-Ashker et al. 2014).",

However, these findings were away from those obtained in previous studies (Fiorentino et al. 1991; Hummelshoj et al. 2006). In those studies, the authors have suggested that IL-10 could positively affect the production of IgA and IgG and might support the regulation of B and T cell responses. The importance of low Ig and their relationship to the diseases of gastrointestinal origin has also been emphasized in dairy cattle with viral stomatitis (Cowan and Wagner 1972) or in calves with diarrhea caused by rotavirus, coronavirus, Escherichia coli F5 and Eimeria species (Balikci and Al 2014). Other reports have described the inheritance of maternal immunoglobulin G1 concentration by the bovine neonate (Muggli et al. 1984) or the effects of passive immunity on growth and survival in the dairy heifer (Robinson et al. 1988). But little is still known about the alterations of the gene expression of Ig in buffaloes with digestive disorders. The obtained findings were nearly similar to those reported recently in calves with diarrhea caused by rotavirus and corona virus and E. coli F5 (Balikci and Al 2014). The decreased levels of IgG and IgA indicate a state of immunosuppression. Some authors attributed the reductions of both variables to the binding of Ig to the microorganisms and their toxins to be neutralized thereby preventing the adherence of bacteria and virus to the target tissues (Andrews et al. 2004; Gershwin 2008). However, the downregulation of both genes being observed in the present study particularly animals with acute TRP needs further verification.",
