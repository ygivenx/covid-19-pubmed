            "text": "C-geranylated flavonoids, a small group of flavonoid derivatives consisting of a flavonoid skeleton joined with a terpenoid side-chain (C10, geranyl substituent) via a direct carbon\u2013carbon bond directly, are considered as the members of the prenylated flavonoids (Barron and Ibrahim 1996). Among these compounds, the geranyl has been revealed to have the potential to occur as a substituent possibly at the C-3, C-6, C-8, C-2\u2032 or C-3\u2032 positions of the flavonoid skeleton (Fig. 1). C-geranylated flavonoids, as secondary metabolic products, are biosynthesized via the mevalonate pathway (for the geranyl skeleton) and the shikimic acid pathway with cinnamoyl CoA (for the flavonoid skeleton), and the connection is provided by the prenyltransferases, the key biosynthetic enzymes for prenylated polyphenols in plants (\u0160mejkal 2014; Andersen and Markham 2006; Kuzuyama et al. 2005). Recently, an aromatic prenyltransferase was discovered in Aspergillus terreus and exhibited unprecedented promiscuity towards flavonoid acceptors to produce C-geranylated flavonoids (Chen et al. 2017a). C-geranylated flavonoids occur in relatively few plant families, such as Leguminosae, Moraceae, Rutaceae, and Ophioglossaceae (Yazaki et al. 2009). Among them, the Paulownia genus (Paulowniaceae family) is a rich natural source of this kind of compound.",

Now, only nine species are accepted as part of the Paulownia genus by Flora of China as shown in Table 1 (Chinese Flora Editorial Committee 1998). Paulownia species are fast-growing shade trees native to China and Southeast Asia and are mainly grown as ornamental trees or commercially for the production of hardwood timber (Zhu et al. 1986; Bergmann 1998). Moreover, their leaves, flowers, fruits and root barks are also traditionally used as Chinese herbal folk medicines for the treatment of enteritis, tonsillitis, bronchitis, dysentery, etc. (He et al. 2016). Phytochemical research has indicated that Paulownia plants contain quinones, lignans, triterpenes, phenylpropanoid glycosides, and flavonoids (Xing et al. 2013; He et al. 2016). However, C-geranylated flavonoids, as the main constituents, have attracted much attention due to their structural variation and assorted biological properties.",

Subsequently, another 37 C-geranylated flavonoids (including C-geranylated flavanones and C-geranylated flavones) were further obtained from P. tomentosa and other Paulownia species. However, no systematic review of various aspects related to Paulownia C-geranylated flavonoids has yet been reported. The present paper summarizes existing publications associated with Paulownia C-geranylated flavonoids and their chemical structures, key spectroscopic characteristics, biological activities and application prospects.

Among them, C-geranylated flavanones represented the overwhelming majority (1\u201372, Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5) and only four C-geranylated flavones (73\u201376, Fig. 6) were obtained so far.

Paucatalinone A (19) was also the first sample as a natural dimeric C-geranylated flavanone derivative (Gao et al. 2015). In Paulownia C-geranylated flavanones, C-2 in ring C is a chiral carbon, and most of them possess an S configuration at the stereogenic centre C-2, except for compounds 19, 25, 27, 37, 41, 43, 46, 60, and 67, which were obtained as racemic mixtures of 2R and 2S enantiomers.

Similarly, cyclization occurring between C-2\u2033 of the geranyl substituent and C-7 in ring A of the flavanone skeleton via an oxygen atom could produce a 2H-furo unit (63 and 64), but this structural modification was not universal in natural C-geranylated flavonoid derivatives. Cyclization could also occur between two carbon atoms in the geranyl chain via an oxygen atom to yield furan (between C-3\u2033 and C-6\u2033, 65) or pyran (between C-3\u2033 and C-7\u2033, 66) moieties in Paulownia C-geranylflavonoids. Compound 67 was, to date, a unique C-geranylflavanone with a monocyclic monoterpene side-chain isolated from Paulownia plants up to mow (Wang et al. 2019), and its oxygenated cyclogeranyl substituent was similar to that (without the hydroxyl) in some ugonins isolated from Helminthostachys zeylanica (Huang et al. 2003; 2010).",

It has also been discovered that the glandular hairs on its young reproductive organs contain flavonoids at concentrations over 1000 times greater than those on the surfaces of its young leaves (Kobayashi et al. 2008). Asai et al. (2008) isolated a number of C-geranylflavanones from the viscous secretion on the surface of immature P. tomentosa fruits and presumed that these flavonoids were biosynthesized in the microstructures glandular trichomes on the fruit surface (Asai et al. 2008; Gang et al. 2002). In addition, the correlation between the seasonal variations and changes in the content of C-geranylflavonoids in P. tomentosa fruits has also been described, and the late autumn was considered as the appropriate harvesting time to obtain high concentrations of C-geranylflavonoids in P. tomentosa fruits (Holubov\u00e1 and \u0160mejkal 2011).",

The quasi-molecular ion peak was subjected to MS2 (ESI\u2013MS/MS) analysis, and the main positive fragment ion peak of the parent flavonoid structure with a methylene was generated by the neutral loss of a C9 unit from the C10 side chain in the C-geranylated flavonoid by further fragmentation (Hsu et al. 2011; Lin et al. 2012). However, as measured by the negative ESI\u2013MS/MS, the quasi-molecular ion peak as [M\u2013H]\u2212 was generated in the ESI\u2013MS1 spectrum, and the main negative ion peak of the parent flavonoid structure fragment was generated in the ESI-MS2 spectrum by the neutral loss of the whole C10 side chain in further fragmentation. The positive and negative ESI-MS/MS assays of diplacone (2), a major Paulownia C-geranylflavanone, corroborated the above difference (Fig. 9). Furthermore, the UV and ESI-MS/MS features of C-geranylated flavonoids could be used to distinguish this kind of natural constituent. Tang et al.

The geranyl side chain did not affect activity significantly, but it could modify the solubility of Paulownia C-geranylated flavonoids, such as diplacone (2), and eventually affected their reaction kinetics (Smejkal et al. 2007; Zima et al. 2010; Asai et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2017). However, Paulownia C-geranylated flavonoids revealed different cellular cytoprotective effects on different cell lines damaged by diverse oxidants in vitro (Table 3). Interestingly, diplacone (2) and its unmodified C-geranylated flavanone analogues, 3\u2032-O-methyl-5\u2032-hydroxydiplacone (5), 3\u2032-O-methyl-5\u2032-O-methyldiplacone (6) and 3\u2032-O-methyldiplacol (15), could significantly decreas the levels of reactive oxygen species and cellular DNA damage in 2 Gy-irradiated AHH-1 cells (Moon et al. 2014). Diplacone (2), paucatalinone A (19) and paucatalinone C (73) also obviously protected premature senescent human embryonic lung diploid fibroblast cells at 10 \u00b5M from ageing induced by H2O2 (Tang et al. 2017; Wang et al. 2017). Thirteen C-geranylated flavonoids isolated from P. catalpifolia had been evaluated for their antioxidant activity on HUVEC injury induced by homocysteine or H2O2, and compounds 2, 25, 26, 34 and 67 caused improved proliferative activity at 10 \u00b5M, however, at 20 \u00b5M or higher, diplacone (2) expressed cytotoxic activity to HUVECs and reduced its proliferative activity (Chen et al. 2017b; Wang et al. 2019).",

Diplacone (2) was the best inhibitor (IC50 1.8 and 4.2 \u00b5M) but with no selectivity for COX-1 and COX-2 (the COX-1/COX-2 selectivity ratio was 0.43). Although 59 showed weaker inhibition (IC50 26.3 and 9.5 \u00b5M), it possessed greater selectivity against COX-2 (COX-1/COX-2selectivity ratio was 2.8).

Regarding cellular biological activities (anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic effects), antibacterial and antiparasitic activities, and enzymatic inhibitions, an ortho-dihydroxy arrangement at C-3\u2032,4\u2032 of the B-ring was considered an essential group but also enhanced the cytotoxic risk. Hydroxylation at C-3 in ring C and 4\u2032-methoxy substitution of ring B might cause a loss of bioactive potency (\u0160mejkal et al. 2008a; Wang et al. 2019). In addition, the unmodified geranyl group at the C-6 position seemed to be crucial for these various biological effects in vitro and in vivo (Vochy\u00e1nov\u00e1 et al. 2015) of C-geranylated flavonoids, however, hydroxylation on the distal end of the geranyl substituent decreased the biological activities revealed by different research (Alcar\u00e1z et al. 2000; \u0160mejkal et al. 2010; Han\u00e1kov\u00e1 et al. 2017; Ryu et al. 2017). The presence of a \u03b2-carbon (proximal) OH group on the geranyl chain did not affect the cytotoxicity (Han\u00e1kov\u00e1 et al. 2015). In addition, the 3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran moiety in some Paulownia C-geranylated flavonoids seemed to be positive for their SARS-CoV PLpro enzyme inhibition (Cho et al. 2013).",

To date, 76 naturally occurring Paulownia C-geranylated flavonoids have been reported in the phytochemical literature. Among them, C-geranylflavanones were predominant constituents with a single geranyl substituent mainly attached to the C-6 position of the flavonoid skeleton. Furthermore, the geranyl substituent could suffer different modifications, such as oxidation (hydroxylation and carbonylation), dehydration, cyclization, or special reduction, to result in the structural variety and novelty of Paulownia C-geranylflavonoids. As a natural resource, fruits of P. tomentosa were explored more abundantly and P. catalpifolia gave rise to some unusual C-geranylflavonoids. Unfortunately, other Paulownia species were with poor attention by researchers and need further phytochemical and pharmacological investigations.",
