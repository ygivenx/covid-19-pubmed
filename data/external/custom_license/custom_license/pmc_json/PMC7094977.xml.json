We should revive this holistic approach to global health and take advantage of the fact that animals develop many of the same diseases as we do. The key idea is called 'one health': the concept that the well-being of humans, animals and the environment are linked. Applications of the one-health perspective abound. The four I discuss demonstrate the power of this framework.",

For example, in the 1950s, health professionals in Minamata, Japan, ignored the local 'dancing' cats with neuropathological symptoms such as difficulty walking, convulsions and excess salivation. When humans also began to show signs of neurological damage, extensive investigations revealed that mercury was to blame, and that the source of the poisoning was local fish. Eventually, researchers discovered that a chlor-alkali production facility was releasing mercury into the bay, contaminating the fish and exposing the town's cats and humans (P. Rabinowitz et al. Vet. Ital.\n45, 23\u201334; 2009).",

Cancer is the leading cause of disease-associated death in dogs, which live at most for 20 years. The Morris Animal Foundation Golden Retriever Lifetime Study is a prospective longitudinal study that aims to identify environmental, genetic and dietary risk factors for diseases such as cancer. This observational study has enrolled 3,000 purebred golden retrievers (a breed particularly prone to cancer) and will follow them through annual online owner questionnaires, animal examinations and the collection of samples for 10\u201314 years. This study could improve our understanding of the relationship between genes and environmental exposure in chronic diseases, and have important human-health implications. ",

But the study of animal diseases can benefit human health. Around 1890, physician Theobald Smith and veterinary surgeon Frederick L. Kilbourne discovered that the parasite that causes cattle fever, Babesia bigemina, was spread by ticks. This was the first demonstration that a biting arthropod could spread disease, and set the stage for physician Walter Reed and his colleagues to prove a few years later that mosquitoes transmit yellow fever.",

Farm animals, especially pigs, were being fed the growth-promoting antibiotic avoparcin, which is chemically similar to vancomycin. Denmark, a major pork producer, was the first to ban avoparcin in 1995; rates of VRE on Danish farms subsequently fell by 90%, but infection rates in Danish hospitals continued to increase. The European Union banned avoparcin in 1997, but VRE rates in European hospitals did not necessarily decline.",

Advances in genomics have provided an explanation for the conundrum: hospital VRE clones might have originated in dogs (P. Damborg et al. Appl. Environ. Microbiol.\n75, 2360\u20132365; 2009). Companion animals receive antibiotics for infections and could be serving as reservoirs of resistant microbes. But pets have been ignored in the discussion of antimicrobial resistance. A one-health approach, using genomic surveillance, is essential to understanding resistant microbial epidemiology and ecology.",

But agriculture, especially livestock production, has led to widespread deforestation that has contributed to the emergence of zoonotic diseases and exacerbated the climate impact of greenhouse gases. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Ebola and Nipah virus infection are among the diseases that have emerged from our demand for meat. SARS and Ebola spread directly to people who ate wild animals, or 'bushmeat.' Nipah virus spread to humans through pigs kept on farms built on deforested land \u2014 deforestation in Malaysia destroyed the habitats of the virus's host fruit bats, which began to feed on fruit trees near the farms and contaminate the fruit with their droppings.",

For everyone to become a vegetarian is not a realistic solution; evidence suggests that we are human because our ancestors hunted, cooked and ate meat. Ultimately, we must work out how to sustainably meet our need for animal proteins without unleashing more zoonotic diseases in a warming climate.
