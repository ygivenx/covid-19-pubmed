In the United States alone, tens of billions of dollars have been spent on biodefense funding programs to create countermeasures to bioterrorism threats, many of which may never arise. In the meantime, many public health authorities have lost their focus on a clear and ever present danger\u2014the spread of old scourges and emerging pathogens in an increasingly interconnected world. Infectious diseases do not respect national borders. People traveling around the world now pose greater potential biological threats than they did in previous generations. From a world health perspective, much as in the war on terror, the most effective way to deal with such threats is at their source. To do so effectively, diagnostics are needed that can rapidly and accurately identify the infections and promote surveillance to halt their further spread from country to country. With this in mind, the recent creation of the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) by 27 countries represents an important step in tracking the spread of infection and enabling the deployment of effective countermeasures. It is too bad that it is being so pitifully funded that it is likely to prove ineffective in reaching its important goals. ",

Bacteria are becoming resistant to modern medicine in developed and developing countries. In addition, political and religious factors, population growth and climate change are also affecting global health security. In Pakistan, the Taliban is impeding the eradication of polio in its areas of influence by resorting to violence and misinformation to prevent the vaccination of children. Upheaval and population movement in conflict-rife areas of central Africa are creating living conditions in refugee camps that encourage the spread of infections.",

To contain the health threat he posed, the US Centers for Disease Control, believing he was infected with extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB), placed him under involuntary isolation by invoking the US Public Health Service Act. XDR-TB is complicated to treat and can be lethal\u2014a 2006 outbreak in a village in South Africa resulted in 52 out of 53 infected individuals dying within months. The Ebola outbreak in Guinea in March of this year quickly claimed 84 lives as the outbreak jumped national borders to Sierra Leone, Liberia and Mali and prompted a public health scare in Canada when a citizen who had traveled in Liberia showed symptoms of disease. The World Health Organization (WHO) believes that the spread of the disease to the capital of Guinea was caused by a single person who had been infected in a remote area of the country, more than 200 miles away. Recently, Middle East respiratory syndrome, a dangerous new virus, was detected in Florida after having traveled to the United Kingdom, France and Malaysia.",

It is estimated that 8.6 million people contract TB each year and about 1.5 million die of it each year. Because it spreads between people who come in contact with each other, its control depends on the rapid identification and treatment of active cases. As the Speaker case illustrates, the ability to discern whether an individual infected with TB carries a multidrug-resistant strain or XDR-TB is crucial not only for proper treatment but also for the protection of those with whom he or she has come in contact and to prevent the further spread of the infection around the globe. Therefore, even if new, effective drugs were to be developed, there is still a need for improved detection with diagnostics to shorten the time to diagnosis with increased accuracy.",

Apart from the need to be inexpensive, a diagnostic must perform to high standards in difficult environments, such as villages across much of Africa and other parts of the world where only a small percentage of health facilities have access to a reliable power source. For those settings, creating incentives for manufacturers to develop a diagnostic poses a substantial challenge. The test must meet the characteristics required by the WHO and be 'affordable, sensitive, specific, user-friendly, robust and rapid, equipment-free and deliverable' (ASSURED). At the same time, the successful introduction in those countries requires the collaboration of the healthcare industry and local governmental health ministries. Thus, for the diseases most likely to spread infection around the world, manufacturers are not clamoring to develop diagnostics for these markets.",
