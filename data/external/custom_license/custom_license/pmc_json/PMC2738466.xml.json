To focus on residential areas, we eliminated 6,345 of the parish\u2019s 10,181 census blocks (US Census, 2000). The eliminated blocks were likely to be sparsely populated or to contain industrial buildings, commercial centers, or parks (blocks with <20 housing units and blocks in the lower 2.5% of housing unit density); to contain mostly high-rise apartment buildings or public housing units that would be difficult to access or remain uninhabited (blocks in the upper 2.5% of housing unit density); and to be in uninhabited neighborhoods (blocks in the Lower Ninth Ward). We randomly generated 600 waypoints (unique locations based on latitude and longitude) across the remaining 3,836 census blocks.",

Because we were interested in nonoccupational respirator use by the general public, persons at a home as paid employees (e.g., remediators) were not eligible. However, residents encountered at their own homes who were employed as remediators were not excluded. If unable to conduct an interview at the first encountered home, the team proceeded in a systematic fashion to the next home.

Otherwise, the participant was asked to choose between 2 models then available from New Orleans retailers. The interviewer asked the participant to put on the N95 FF respirator as he or she would for participating in mold clean-up activities. Written and pictorial manufacturer\u2019s instructions were included with the respirator packaging, but no additional instructions were given until the evaluation was complete (16).

Finally, proper donning was associated with several factors related to respirators: ever having used a mask or certified respirator, ever having had a respirator fit test, having at the time of the interview a mask or certified respirator, and having at the time of the interview a respirator confirmed by the interviewer to be NIOSH certified (Table 4).",

However, the outcome in those who appeared to properly put on the respirator is less certain because even a properly donned respirator may have leaks that limit its effectiveness. A study of 18 different N95 FF respirator models found that, overall, in the absence of fit testing, 74% of proper donnings would provide the full protection possible with an N95 FF respirator (range 31%\u201399%, depending on the model) (23).

Both experimental and epidemiologic studies suggest that airborne transmission of influenza (by small particles <10 \u03bcm) can occur and may result in more severe disease than transmission by large droplets or fomites (24\u201327). A recent review argues that airborne transmission may play an important role in the spread of a pandemic strain (28). While formal recommendations for N95 FF respirator use by the public do not exist\u2014beyond the HHS recommendation regarding potential exposures to infected birds\u2014a recent Institute of Medicine (IOM) report notes that \u201ca properly fitted N95 FF respirator is likely to be both the least expensive and the most widely available NIOSH-certified respirator for protecting... the public against airborne [influenza] infection\u201d (29). Our results suggest that much of the public may have difficulty achieving a proper fit because of improper donning. Given the observed role of experience in proper donning, and the high frequency of recent experience with respirators reported by our survey participants, one could argue that the overall performance in post-Katrina New Orleans is likely to be superior to that of virtually any other locale.",

Indeed, N95 FF respirators are currently being marketed to the public as \u201cbird flu masks\u201d (32). While uncertainty remains about the level of protection needed against influenza and that offered by an N95 FF respirator, an improperly donned N95 FF respirator will provide less protection than a properly donned one. Our results suggesting that workplace training increased proper donning among the public indicate that educational efforts could have a positive effect. Since few of our participants reported, or were observed, referring to manufacturers\u2019 instructions, consideration also should be given to incorporating instructions onto the respirator itself, such as arrows or simple words (\u201cnose,\u201d \u201cchin\u201d) to indicate orientation. The IOM report\u2019s authors could find no simple modification of N95 FF respirators that would prevent the need for fit testing (29). Short of mass fit testing, proper donning will be the vital step to ensuring that members of the public using N95 FF respirators derive the greatest possible benefit from them.",

An observational study of 62 healthcare workers in 3 California hospitals found that 40 (65%) improperly put on N95 FF respirators before entering the room of a patient in isolation for tuberculosis. Errors included use of only 1 strap, incorrectly placed straps, and presence of facial hair (21). The results of that study, in terms of the proportion who demonstrated improper donning and the nature of the errors, are similar to our findings. The impact of the 2005 US policy that suspended enforcement of annual fit testing of healthcare workers who use respirators for occupational exposure to tuberculosis is unknown (33). Yet N95 FF respirators will clearly be part of healthcare workers\u2019 defense in the event of pandemic influenza (34,35). HHS, as part of procurement of essential medical supplies for pandemic influenza, has stockpiled 20 million N95 FF respirators and plans to acquire 87 million more through September 2007 (36). The pandemic plans of other countries, including Australia and France, recommend use of N95 (or FFP2) respirators (28). Further evaluation of respirator donning among healthcare workers therefore may be warranted.",
