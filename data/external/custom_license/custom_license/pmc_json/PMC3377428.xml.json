FECV is common in cats, causing mild transient enteritis in kittens, but is asymptomatic in adult cats. In contrast, FIPV occurs sporadically but is lethal. It replicates in monocytes and macrophages and rapidly disseminates throughout the body causing systemic immunopathologic disease (1\u20134).",

Genetic and animal experimental evidence indicates that FIPV arises by mutation from FECV in the intestinal tract of a persistently infected cat; the virus thereby acquires the monocyte or macrophage tropism that enables it to spread systemically and cause FIP (5\u20137,8). According to another view, the 2 pathotypes circulate independently in the field. This circulating virulent/avirulent FCoV theory recently was advocated by Brown et al. (9). Their conclusion was based on sequence analyses of parts of the viral genome including the matrix (M) gene, phylogenetic analysis of which revealed reciprocal monophyly of the sequences obtained from FIP cases versus those of asymptomatic FECV-infected animals. In addition, the authors suggested 5 aa residues in the M protein to represent potential diagnostic markers for distinguishing virulent FIPV from avirulent FECV (9).",

These animals came from 8 catteries. FECV and FIPV cases were found in 7 (designated A to G); the remaining cattery (H) provided 2 cats with FIP.

Such a distribution pattern is consistent with the mutation theory, according to which FIPVs originate from FECVs and are thus closely related (7,9). Exceptions in this picture were FIPV 9 in cattery F and FECVs 406 and 407 in cattery D, presumably caused by multiple FCoV lineages in these open catteries (an open cattery is one in which cats can move in and out, usually for breeding purposes).",

An alignment of the relevant part of the polypeptide sequence, comprising the presumed signature residues at positions 108, 120, 138, 163 and 199, is shown in the Figure, panel B, for all FIPV and FECV genomes sequenced in this study. Within this sample collection, we observed complete sequence conservation at positions 108 and 199, virtually complete conservation (1 difference) at position 163. The 2 aa identities (Val and Ile) found at position 120 and 138 occurred with similar frequencies in FIPV and FECV (position 120: Ile in 16/36 [44%] FIPVs and in 6/14 [43%] FECVs; position 138: Ile in 29/36 [81%] FIPVs and in 12/14 [86%] FECVs). These observations do not indicate the slightest tendency of sequence segregation among the 2 pathotypes. In the alignment of the Figure, panel B, we also included M protein sequences translated from several FCoV genomes from the Americas, 7 FIPV, and 1 FECV (8). The comparison does not reveal peculiarities indicative of geographic segregation. Hence, our data do not confirm the diagnostic potential of the M protein sequence nor do they support the suggested role of the membrane protein in FIP pathogenesis (9).",
