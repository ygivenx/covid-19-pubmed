A medium-sized corporate has recently closed its doors leaving patients, dentists and DCPs with unanswered questions and mounting debts. The recruitment crisis is becoming more acute every day with many practices struggling to provide services for patients simply because there aren't enough dentists. As I write this, the government is due to announce a raft of measures to help halt the spread of Covid-19, as well as mitigate the economic knock-on effect that may result. These are interesting times.",
