It has been suggested that key features of e-learning include self-directed learning, flexibility and daily availability for learners and collaboration within the learning community to ensure further professional development [1]. The concept of e-learning was already adopted by numerious academic institutions, offering various courses both at preclinical and clincial levels [2\u20135]. Also, a recent expansion of online courses in epidemiology and public health has allowed that these scientific disciplines become available to broader public. Moreover, there is a remarkable number of accredited schools that offer online public health degrees [6]. Introducing e-learning may help the users not only to improve health literacy, but also to motivate them to do own literature search and improve their knowledge on the subject [7, 8].",

The course consisted of additional e-material sent by e-mail, along with conventional lectures and microscopic practicals. However, given that growing number of students showed interest to enroll, the course required a more sophisticated medium for improvement and inclusion of all those who took interest. As of 2004, web-based platform Moodle (moodle.med.bg.ac.rs) has been used as a mean of e-learning in this course, because of flexibility and simplicity for navigation and creation of educational material (interactive concept, dynamic content, links). After pilot testing, the project \u201cReticulum\u201d (moodle.med.bg.ac.rs) was founded in 2005 and has been used since for various e-courses including Physiology, Pathology and Social Medicine, both for under- and postgraduates at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Belgrade. It is also important to highlight that e-courses at our Faculty are additional tool along with conventional teaching methods, while students are required to follow lectures and practicals (i.e., there is no course that is entirely carried out in electronic form).",

Depending on topic, e-seminars were either compact in one block (Disaster epidemiology, Sources of data) or had several different assignments (Table 1). Each assignment was organized in such a way that students were required to read through theoretical background and then move on to answering particular questions. Each question offered three answers, of which only one was correct. Participants were allowed to continue to the following page only after answering correctly to previous question. To help students answer correctly, each question was followed by a selected image related to topic, but not indicative of correct answer. The questions were related to application of various epidemiological study methods such as calculations of ratios, proportions, rates and risk ratios. For some calculations (use of descriptive method in investigation of communicable and non-communicable diseases, vital statistics) students were required to follow the links and find corresponding data in open year books, published online by the Institute of Public Health of Serbia (http://www.batut.org.rs/).\n",

Students in classroom seminars were randomly assigned post-course survey in the last class of the semester. Each answer was rated on a 5-point Likert scale, where rank 1 denoted \u201cI strongly disagree\u201d and rank 5 denoted \u201cI strongly agree\u201d with a given statement.

The remaining 30 % (maximum of 30 points) of the total grade consists of points received in the written quizz in mid-semester (27 points) and points received for the oral presentation of seminar topic (3 points). Students who opted to follow e-seminars received seminar points based on whether or not they completed the topic scheduled for the corresponding week of the course program. In epidemiology exam sessions for 2014, students were examined by one out of seven professors (three full professors and four assistant professors). Main exam sessions after pilot e-seminars were June, July, September, and October, 2014. According to Faculty bylaws students are not obliged to present themselves at the exam to be able to enroll in the 3rd study year. Those who opt to take oral exam in epidemiology later may take it the following January at earliest. We registered grades of students who presented at the examination from June to October 2014 and compared their final grades in relation to type of seminars by means of t-test.

In the current body of literature, to our knowledge, there are no reports on assessment of e-learning in Serbia. Although e-learning concept at the Faculty of Medicine in Belgrade has been established and well-elaborated in Histology and Embryology course over the past decade, it was applied for the first time in 2014 in undergraduate epidemiology course. Our pilot study indicated that, prior to entering e-seminars, students had considerably high expectations from the course in terms of overall learning as well as experiencing novel methods of learning while being at ease. We also observed that process of learning, for our students, is the most convenient from own home, which accounted for the highest rank in the scale. Various in- and out-of-classroom techniques have been developed for teaching not only epidemiology, but for almost all medical branches as well [9\u201311]. Given the rise of communication technology, diverse distance learning courses in epidemiology have targeted both developing and developed countries, particularly when academic centers are not within easy reach [9]. Introduction of e-seminars in our undergraduate epidemiology course has also included the use of additional websites in search for appropriate data. In this manner, students were encouraged to step out of their classical learning practice, based on readings of recommended textbooks and reproduction of theoretical frameworks. Incorporation of web-based modules in epidemiology could demonstrate the relevance and presence of epidemiological data on the world wide web. Because internet represents an important source of health-related information to medical students [12], it is important to include e-based resources in epidemiology curriculum.",

Although classroom seminars offered possibilities for peer interaction, we did not determine a degree of knowledge retention at the individual level in this group. Taking into account students\u2019 impressions in the post-course survey, we believe that through these e-seminars we achieved the goal to present epidemiological topics in a well-balanced amusing and studious manner. Nevertheless, there was no difference in perception of readiness to take oral exam in the forthcoming exam session between the two groups. It has been highlighted that students by-and-large have difficulties understanding the key principles underlying epidemiological concepts [13]. Indeed, over the second year of undergraduate studies in medicine, students tend to be more oriented towards major preclinical subjects, such as physiology and biochemistry, which, according to Faculty bylaws, students are obliged to pass in order to enter the 3rd year of training. By contrast, students are not obliged to either take or pass exam in epidemiology before entering the next year of training, which likely affects students to feel at-ease when considering whether or not to take this exam during the ongoing Faculty semester. Again, another important aspect attributed to obstacles in adopting basic epidemiological principles is the \u201cpopulation-level thinking\u201d [13], contrary to patient-oriented medicine, which seems to represent the greatest barrier in comprehension of study material.",

In this respect, students\u2019 perception of being prepared for oral exam as well as the final grade they received after the exam could be considered as proxy for knowledge gain. The lack of significant knowledge gain in e-seminar group could have resulted from a small number of classes dedicated to seminar topics as detemined by the Faculty program, because approximately just one sixth of classes in the entire semester is assigned to epidemiology seminars. It is possible that further development of topics and more practical examples could lead to better subjective feeling of readiness to take the final exam. However, even though neither difference in knowledge gain between the two seminar groups was significant nor was the average grade at final exam, we believe that introduction of new learning module in epidemiology course has been justified given the expectations and overall impressions after completion of seminars.",

The last two seminar topics (environmental and disaster epidemiology) were set for the last week in semester (May 26\u201331, 2014). However, in the third week of May 2014, record-breaking rainfall severely hit numerous municipalities across Serbia. High intensity floods and subsequent landslides resulted in total destruction of households, bridges and sections of roads both in rural and urban areas, causing estimated 1.8 billion Euros damage and loss. These extreme weather conditions affected around 1.6 million people of which 32,000 were evacuated from homes and lodged in temporary camps established by the Government and the Serbian Red Cross [15]. Because of this, Universities across country were closed and final lectures in the semester were postponed to beginning of month of June 2014. In response to this disaster many medical students were engaged in various emergency-related activities including collection of clothes, food and item personal hygiene products. It is likely that these emergency events as well as the start of exam session (following the end of lectures) caused 40 % of students not to complete e-seminars and subsequently not respond to post-course survey. As a result, answers given in the post-course survey may not entirely represent students\u2019 impressions at the end of the course. Another limitation of our study is related to selection of participants for e-learning course, since students were not randomly selected, but rather they decided on their own whether or not to participate. Such selection could have favored those students who are more versatile with web browsing and those who own a personal computer.",
