This virus order currently comprises four families that include nine genera [2]: Arteriviridae (genus Arterivirus), Coronaviridae (divided into two subfamilies, Coronavirinae [genera Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus) and Torovirinae (genera Torovirus and Bafinivirus]), Roniviridae (genus Okavirus), and Mesoniviridae (genus Alphamesonivirus). The Ninth Report of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses lists approximately 80 nidoviruses, many of which infect birds and mammals, including humans, livestock, and companion animals [1]. In contrast, bafiniviruses have been isolated from freshwater fishes [3, 4], and roniviruses are the only invertebrate nidoviruses known to infect prawns. Coronaviruses and roniviruses, which have genomes larger than 26 kb, are categorized as \u201clarge nidoviruses\u201d; they are the largest RNA viruses known to date. In contrast, arteriviruses are referred to as \u201csmall nidoviruses\u201d because of their 13-16 kb genome size.",

            "text": "Despite considerable differences in genome size and gene composition, all nidoviruses have similar genome organizations and replication strategies [1]. The large 5\u2032 part of the genome encodes two partially overlapping ORFs, which are generally designated ORF1a and 1b. Translation of ORF1a yields a polyprotein called pp1a. ORF1b is translated as a fusion with the ORF1a product, to form polyprotein pp1ab, by a programmed \u22121 ribosomal frameshift (RFS) at the overlap site, which contains a specific slippery sequence just upstream of a pseudoknot structure. The large polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab are proteolytically processed to yield the replicase subunits, including a 3C-like (3CL) protease flanked by transmembrane (TM) domains, which is encoded by ORF1a, and both an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and a superfamily 1 helicase (HEL1) encoded by ORF1b [5]. The region downstream of ORF1b contains multiple smaller ORFs, whose number may vary among viruses, which encode a set of viral structural proteins (e.g., nucleocapsid protein and spike glycoprotein). Translation of these structural proteins occurs through a nested set of 3\u2032-coterminal subgenomic mRNAs that are controlled by leader transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs) and have different 5\u2019 ends depending on the nidovirus family and genus [6].",

A short genome fragment of Cavally virus (CavV), the first nidovirus isolated from mosquitoes in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, was reported in 2009 [7], and its detailed characterization was reported in 2011 [8]. Soon after that, isolation and characterization of Nam Dinh virus (NDiV) from mosquitoes in Vietnam was reported [9]. The two new viruses have genome organizations and gene expression patterns that are essentially similar to those of known nidoviruses, and it is noteworthy that their genome sizes (approximately 20 kb) are intermediate between those of large and small nidoviruses. Subsequent detailed analysis of the CavV and NDiV genomes implied that they should be considered members of a single virus species, Alphamesonivirus 1, which has been assigned to a new family, Mesoniviridae (genus Alphamesonivirus), in the order Nidovirales [10]. As these viruses were only recently discovered, their ecological aspects (e.g., host range, life cycle, and pathogenicity) remain to be elucidated.",

Two other replicative domains common to nidoviruses (except arteriviruses), a 3\u2032-to-5\u2032 exoribonuclease (EXON) and a ribose-2\u2032-O-methyltransferase (O-MT) were also identified in the C-terminal portion of DKNV ORF1b. In addition, like roniviruses and viruses belonging to Alphamesonivirus 1 (CavV and NDiV) [10], a putative N7-methyltransferase (N-MT) was also identified in the region between the EXON and O-MT domains, but not the uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (NendoU) domain that is commonly found in most nidoviruses [35\u201337].",

Unlike CavV [8] and NDiV [9], no large RNA species (more than 10 kbp) derived from DKNV mRNA1 (for expressing ORF1a and ORF1ab proteins) was detected in this study, which may because of the difference in detection methods.

As is the case for NDiV [9], p30, p20, and p16 could be the protein products encoded by ORF2b, ORF3a, and ORF3b, respectively. The differences in relative protein amounts between p20 and p16 might be reflected by the translation efficiencies of ORF3a and ORF3b attributed to the position of each start codon on mRNA3. The apparent molecular mass of the ORF2b product (p30) was slightly larger than the mass calculated from the aa sequence data (25 kDa), probably due to the slow mobility on SDS gels attributable to its highly polar arrangement of charged residues [38, 39].\n",

            "text": "In general, the spike glycoproteins of nidoviruses undergo posttranslational processing during virion morphogenesis [1]. The spike glycoprotein of NDiV, which has been shown to be encoded by ORF2a, migrates as a single prominent band on SDS gels with a molecular mass of 77 kDa [9]. In DKNV, two different protein bands (p80 and p58) seemed to be proteolytically processed forms of the ORF2a product. The ProP program predicted a furin-type cleavage site (prediction score +0.64 at position 209SQKRTKR\u2193WD) within DKNV ORF2a, which could be involved in post-translational processing of the precursor protein. To identify these two peptides and verify the putative cleavage site, N-terminal amino acid sequence analyses were conducted on three representative protein bands: p80, p55, and p30. The p80 and p58 peptides had different N-terminal sequences, both of which were encoded within the ORF2a sequence (Fig. 6a), indicating that these proteins could be generated through post-translational cleavages of a full-length ORF2a product. As pointed out before, the first cleavage site was located just after a hydrophobic stretch, 227PNVNC\u2193STRID, whose cleavage is probably mediated by signal peptidase (Fig. 6b). The second cleavage site was located at residues 435KRTKR\u2193WDSSY, as predicted above, which is the conserved motif recognized by furin-like proteases (Fig. 6b) [40]. Overall, the nascent DKNV ORF2a polypeptide could be directed to the endoplasmic reticulum and cleaved by signal peptidase and, in some circumstances, further cleaved by a furin-like protease in the Golgi complex to generate an N-terminally truncated spike glycoprotein (Fig. 6b). The two forms of putative spike glycoproteins, named msS1 and msS2, share a common C-terminus containing a TM region. The COILS [24] and Paircoil2 [25] programs predicted that the region followed by the putative furin cleavage site (that is, the msS2 domain) would have two coiled-coil structures (Fig. S2), which correspond to features that are functionally important for membrane fusion and entry of various viruses [e.g.,\n41, 42]. The calculated molecular masses of msS1 and msS2 are 77.9 kDa and 53.8 kDa, respectively, which are slightly smaller than the masses inferred from SDS gels (p80 and p58, respectively), probably due to lower electrophoretic mobility attributable to N-linked glycosylation (Fig. 6a, b), as is seen with other nidovirus spike glycoproteins [1]. In conclusion, the precursor DKNV ORF2a peptide is posttranslationally processed by a signal peptidase and/or a furin-like protease to express two types of outer spike glycoproteins with a common C-terminus (Fig. 6c). On the other hand, the N-terminal sequence of p30 could not be determined, probably because of a blocked N-terminal residue (Fig. 6a). The two minor polypeptides (p29 and p28) could not be subjected to N-terminal sequencing because of insufficient amounts of the polypeptides recovered, and it remains unclear whether the two polypeptides are incorporated into the DKNV virion. These issues should be addressed in future studies.",

The resulting Bayesian phylogenetic tree showed that DKNV formed a clade with the viruses of Alphamesonivirus 1 (CavV and NDiV), clearly indicating that DKNV is a new member of the family Mesoniviridae (Fig. 7b). The topologies of NJ and ML trees were essentially the same as that of a Bayesian tree (Fig. S3). However, it should be noted that DKNV formed a separate branch from NDiV and CavV, which reflected the sequence differences in domains A and C.\n",

            "text": "Although these three nidoviruses share significant similarities in genome organization, DKNV showed subtle but significant differences from CavV and NDiV at the nucleotide and amino acid sequence levels. Amino acid sequence identities and similarities of six major ORFs (ORF1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, 3a, and 3b) among the three viruses suggested that CavV and NDiV are more closely related to each other than to DKNV (Table 1). In addition, the DKNV ORF1a protein was found to contain a 55-aa insertion (319K to 374G) and a 22-aa deletion (1720V to 1721S) compared with CavV and NDiV (Fig. S4). As a result, excluding the poly(A) tail, the genome of DKNV (20,256 bp) is slightly longer than those of CavV (20,108 bp) and NDiV (20,124 bp). The genomes of members of Alphamesonivirus 1 have been reported to contain six conserved active domains characteristic of nidoviruses \u2013 3CL, RdRp, Zm-HEL, EXON, N-MT, and O-MT [10] \u2013 and such domains were also conserved in DKNV genome, sharing 75.8\u201389.5 % sequence identity with those of CavV and NDiV (Fig. S5). 5\u2032-RACE analysis of the DKNV subgenomic RNAs identified two leader TRSs in the 5\u2032-UTR of its genomic RNA (Fig. 4b). The DKNV TRS for subgenomic mRNA2 was almost identical to those of CavV and NDiV (Fig. S6). On the other hand, the DKNV TRS for subgenomic mRNA3 was identical to that of NDiV but not to CavV. Despite showing this partial discordance in TRSs, these three mesonidoviruses could use the same or a highly similar mechanism controlling the synthesis of 3\u2032-coterminal subgenomic mRNAs. In conclusion, DKNV is deemed to be a new strain of the species Alphamesonivirus 1, and the current study provides further understanding of the viruses of the family Mesoniviridae.",

            "text": "This work has demonstrated that the mesonivirus ORF2a product undergoes posttranslational processing. The polypeptide encoded by the DKNV ORF2a is translated as a precursor polyprotein and is proteolytically processed into two forms of spike glycoprotein, msS1 and msS2, which share a common C-terminus containing two putative heptad repeat regions and a hydrophobic TM domain (Fig. 6 and Fig. S2). N-terminal sequencing of the virion structural proteins identified the two cleavage sites in the DKNV ORF2a polypeptide, 227PNVNC\u2193STRID and 435KRTKR\u2193WDSSY, which are probably cleaved by a signal peptidase and a furin-like protease, respectively. A similar pattern of spike glycoprotein precursor processing is found in other nidoviruses. The spike glycoprotein precursors of many coronaviruses have a signal peptide at the N-terminus and a TM domain at the C-terminus and, with few exceptions, become proteolytically cleaved by furin or a furin-like protease at a multibasic motif (often RRXRR\u2193) into two subunits [43, 44]. The spike glycoproteins of fish-infecting coronaviruses (genus Bafinivirus) possess a putative furin cleavage site at the motif R-X-K/R-R\u2193 [4]. The okavirus precursor glycoprotein contains a signal-peptide-like sequence close to the N-terminus, a proteolytic cleavage site, and a C-terminal TM domain. In this case, the second cleavage is probably mediated by signal peptidase, not a furin-like protease, just after the fifth TM domain close to the C-terminal side [45]. Interestingly, the ORF2a sequences of both NDiV and CavV also contain a putative furin-like cleavage motif (426\nKRNKR for CavV and 425\nKRSKR for NDiV) that is similar to the motif identified in DKNV ORF2a (435KRTKR\u2193), suggesting that the spike glycoprotein precursors of NDiV and CavV could also undergo post-translational processing. The two hypothetical spike glycoproteins of DKNV, msS1 (p80) and msS2 (p55), showed almost the same band intensity on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 6a), suggesting that the two forms of spike glycoproteins might be exposed on the virion surface in an approximately equal molar ratio.",

            "text": "The DKNV ORF2b was predicted to encode a nuclepcapsid protein because of its highly basicity and hydrophilicity (Fig. S1). In SARS-CoV, the nucleocapsid protein consists of two independent structural domains, an N-terminal RNA-binding domain and a C-terminal dimerization domain [46]. The ANCHOR server predicted that the putative nucleocapsid protein of DKNV possesses multiple disordered protein-binding regions in the N-terminal half and an ordered domain in the C-terminal half (Fig. S7). This predicted order/disorder pattern is very similar to those of the nucleocapsid proteins of CavV and NDiV. Interestingly, the amino acid sequence of the C-terminal half of the nucleocapsid protein is highly conserved among the three mesoniviruses (DKNV, CavV, and NDiV), in contrast to that of the N-terminal half (data not shown), implying that the C-terminal domain of mesonivirus nucleocapsid protein might be involved in RNA binding. In gill-associated virus (genus Okavirus, family Roniviridae), the RNA-binding domain of the nucleocapsid protein is located in its N-terminal region, which contains a proline/arginine-rich stretch [47]. Contrary to expectations, such a remarkable proline/basic residue-rich stretch was not found in any mesonivirus nucleocapsid proteins. Further studies are needed to elucidate the structural interaction between viral RNA and nucleocapsid protein in mesoniviruses.",

In contrast, DKNV grew in all cultured mosquito cells tested. Interestingly, DKNV grew to high titers in two A.\nalbopictus cell lines but grew poorly in a cell line derived from C.\ntritaeniorhynchus, which is the species from which DKNV was isolated. Suppressed and noncytopathic growth of DKNV in Culex mosquito cells suggests that in nature, DKNV establishes a latent infection in Culex mosquitoes as a natural reservoir host. Like DKNV, both CavV and NDiV were isolated from Culex mosquitoes, although CavV has also been isolated from Aedes mosquitoes. Recently, some flaviviruses associated with mosquitoes have been shown to be maintained in the natural population of mosquitoes by vertical transmission in both sexes [48, 49]. Is DKNV also maintained in the mosquito population by vertical transmission in nature? Zirkel et al. [8] suggested the presence of amplifying vertebrate hosts in the CavV infection cycle in nature because there was no evidence of CavV infection in male mosquitoes. To clarify how mesoniviruses are maintained in nature, more information about their host range, virulence, and tissue tropism should be gathered.",

(c) Predicted topology of the two forms of DKNV spike glycoprotein, msS1 and msS2. Cylinders and solid lines represent predicted transmembrane domains and ectodomains, respectively. The precursor ORF2a polypeptide is posttranslationally processed by signal peptidase to yield msS1 and further processed by a furin-like protease to yield msS2",
