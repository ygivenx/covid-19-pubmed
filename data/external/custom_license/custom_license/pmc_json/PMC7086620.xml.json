CaKV is frequently identified within fecal samples of animals with or without clinical signs of diarrhea [4]. There are few descriptions of coinfection due to CaKV and other viral agents: a recent study identified CaKV in association with a several agents including canine herpesvirus type 1 (CaHV-1), canine distemper virus (CDV), canine parvovirus (CPV), and canine adenovirus A types 1 (CAdV-1) and 2 (CAdV-2) in diarrheic and non-diarrheic dogs from Korea [19]. However, none of these studies have identified CaKV in the tissues of dogs. Consequently, the current study describes the first occurrence of CaKV in multiple tissues of a puppy from Southern Brazil, which was also coinfected with other infectious disease agents.",

Several tissue fragments (liver, spleen, lung, cerebellum, cerebrum, mesenteric lymph node, kidney, heart, and intestine) were collected and routinely processed for histopathological evaluation. Selected formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue fragments of the liver and lung were used in immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays designed to detect the N protein of CDV (VMARD, Washington, USA), and with a commercial monoclonal antibody designed to identify CAdV-1 and CAdV-2 (VMARD, Washington, USA), using a previously described procedure [8]. Positive controls consisted of FFPE tissues from previous studies [9]; negative controls consisted of the diluents of the primary antibodies.

Alternatively, a more sensitive assay might be required to detect this virus when there is concomitant infection with other severe intestinal diseases, such as those associated with CPV-2 and Giardia spp. Nevertheless, these findings confirm the detection of CaKV in this dog, and represent the first description of canine kobuvirus in Brazil.",

Interestingly, we have identified CaKV with concomitant infections related to CDV (by RT-PCR and IHC) and CAdV-1 (only by IHC) in the lung of this dog and associated with necrotizing bronchiolitis, interstitial pneumonia, as well as pulmonary congestion and edema. Interstitial pneumonia is a typical pulmonary manifestation of infection due to CDV and CAdV-1 [11, 12]. CDV produces interstitial pneumonia due to the viral tropism for epithelial cells of the pulmonary alveoli, while CAdV induces the same lesions due to alteration of the integrity of the vascular endothelium of the alveolar wall [7]. However, interstitial pneumonia was also described in pigs experimentally infected with porcine kobuvirus [27], so it is possible that CaKV could have been associated with the pulmonary infection observed in this dog.",
