            "text": "Virus coinfection is frequently observed in clinical settings [1, 2]. The simultaneous detection and quantitative evaluation of the coinfection of a cell by multiple viruses or even multiple subtypes is urgently in demand, yet it remains difficult. Several laboratory methods are available for detecting viruses, but they have disadvantages for the simultaneous detection and quantitative evaluation of multiple viruses in a single cell. Currently available multiplex PCR methods have been widely used for the detection of multiple viruses [3]. However, they require a marker of a professional primer and carefully designed probes to avoid cross- and mis-hybridization [4]. More importantly, with PCR-based methods as well as some other methods, including gene chips, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and biomolecular mass spectrometry, it is difficult to provide the subcellular localization information and single-cell analysis results for the different co-infecting viruses [1, 5]. The direct isolation and culture of viruses in cell lines is a convincing method and the gold standard, but it requires skilled technologists and specialized laboratory settings as well as a long turnaround time [6]. In addition, many viruses cannot be covered by culture. Immunofluorescence (IF) by labelling antibodies with fluorophores is available for virus detection in single cells. However, such probes have been limited to the qualitative evaluation of 2\u20133 colours in most cases and relatively low sensitivity due to the unfavourable optical properties of organic dyes [7].",

We have acquired multicolour QD-probes for the influenza A viruses H1N1, H3N2 and H9N2 as well as HAdV-B3 by using this rapid and self-assembly probe preparation process without purification. Multiple viruses in the same cell can be simultaneously imaged and analysed after a single staining cycle.

This bio-conjugation is most commonly based on cross-linking reactions between amine and carboxylic acid groups (catalysed by carbodiimide) [12]. Then, the QD-SpA conjugates captured free MAbs in the solution via self-assembly, with SpA acting as an adaptor for the orientation-controlled IgG immobilization via binding to the Fc region of IgG (step 2). When the molar ratio of SpA to IgG is relatively high, all the MAbs will be conjugated with the QD-SpA, and after the formation of the QD-SpA-MAb complex, there are no sterically accessible binding sites left on the MAb, which prevents cross-linking of different QDs via MAbs [13, 14]. This ensured that the QD-SpA-MAb probe preparation did not require a probe purification process [15]. The formation of different functional QD-SpA-MAb probes either are pooled in one coloured complex cocktail or kept separate with a single probe for each one (step 3). These probes will target their own specific target of interest (step 4).\n",

In contrast, the QD625-SpA-MAb probe targeting the hexon of HAdV-B3 showed a different subcellular distribution pattern from that for H1N1 at different post-infection time points. The QD signal targeting the hexon of HAdV-B3 was localized along the cell surface and inside the cytoplasm during the early infection phase (15 min, 4 h) and concentrated mainly in the nucleus during the late infection phase (8 h, 16 h) (Fig. 3b). The HAdVs genome is transported into the nucleus, where viral gene transcription, viral DNA replication, and virion assembly occur [20]. Our observation is in agreement with the subcellular localization and functions of the hexon of HAdVs since the hexon plays roles in events occurring after internalization, such as transcriptional activation, and nuclear reorganization [20, 21]. These results from the detection of different viruses demonstrated that QD-SpA-MAb probes can be used to label different targets in different subcellular areas inside the cell.",

As shown in Fig. 5, by using the one-step staining procedure with a cocktail of QD625-SpA-MAb, QD525-SpA-MAb and QD705-SpA-MAb probes, the three influenza A virus subtypes H1N1, H3N2 and H9N2 were detected in the same co-infected MDCK cells with three types of corresponding QD signals (Fig. 5a). When the MDCK cells were co-infected with two types of influenza A virus subtypes, the two types of corresponding QD signals were detected (Fig. 5b). If there is only one type of virus subtype, only one corresponding QD signal can be detected (Fig. 5c). Interestingly, no cross-talk and no co-localization were observed between the different probes within the staining cocktail, indicating that each QD-SpA-MAb probe was uniquely matched to a specific target. This result is in agreement with the previous report that the HA protein is subtype-specific and hence can be used to detect specific subtypes of influenza virus [22]. It is also worth emphasizing that these results suggest the usefulness of QD-SpA-MAb probes for the simultaneous identification and differentiation of multiple virus subtypes.\n",

With our method, to detect coinfection by different subtypes of influenza viruses, only the Abs in the QD-SpA probe need to be replaced with highly specific MAbs for different subtypes. This makes the QD-SpA-MAb probes the most versatile assay for simple and sensitive virus detection compared with the other methods for the detection of coinfection. For example, traditional direct antigen detection tests, including enzyme immunoassays and direct fluorescent-antibody assays, suffer from poor sensitivity. The viral culture test is time-consuming and often not applicable [24, 25]. Likewise, serology to detect antibody response to infection may only produce positive results up to two weeks after infection [26]. The PCR method can raise the false negativity if there is a mutation of the target site [27], or it may be caused by a mismatch between the primer and/or probe and its binding region [28]. Some more advanced methods, such as multiplex PCR, often produce false positive bands due to cross dimers forming between PCR primers [29].",

Two probes, QD625-SpA-MAb and QD525-SpA-Mab, targeting HA and hexon proteins, respectively, were used in the A549 cell line co-infected with influenza A/H1N1 and HAdV-B3. As shown in Fig. 6, the results indicated that H1N1 and HAdV-B3 can be simultaneously stained with red and green signals by the two specific probes (Fig. 6a). When the cells were only infected with H1N1 or HAdV-B3, only the red or green signal can be detected (Fig. 6b, c), whereas no signal was found in the A549 cells without infection by of H1N1 or HAdV-B3 (Fig. 6d). This result further verifies that the QD-SpA-MAb probes are quite specific and can be effectively used for the simultaneous detection of coinfection with viruses of different types.\n",

The preparation procedure for these QD-SpA-MAb probes is a rapid, self-assembly and purification-free process. Within a single staining cycle, by using a cocktail of different coloured QD-SpA-MAb probes, multiple viruses in the same cell can be simultaneously imaged and analysed. Compared to other nanomaterials-based methods such as AuNPs/Ag staining [31], magnetic beads [32, 33], etc., the self-assembled QD-based method is flexible, sensitive, quantitative and prominent for multiple analysis, and thus is preferable for the co-infection detection in cell or tissue samples. Because one QD particle can be seen under microscope, the self-assembled quantum dot probes may be used to detect single targets of a virus. Of course, when the self-assembled quantum dot probes are used for virus detection, a protocol similar to that of immunofluorescence must be deployed. The differentiation ability of the new method also depends heavily on the antibody. For example, in our experiment, we can\u2019t differentiate HAdV subtypes because antibodies specifically for different HAdV subtypes are unavailable. Moreover, the antigenicity of the sample needs to be preserved for detection. Nevertheless, our study provides a platform to perform the simultaneous detection of multiple viruses in the same cell.",
