            "text": "Because of a short incubation period and consequent short serial interval (i.e., time between the onset of the first case and the onset of subsequent case[s]), influenza virus causes explosive outbreaks despite its relatively low infectivity. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, which spread rapidly throughout the world in 2009, was most likely established in Australia (18) and Japan (19) before border screening was initiated in those countries. Border screening to detect influenza-infected travelers is likely to be unsuccessful because persons with asymptomatic cases can be infectious, and fever is not a consistent symptom of influenza (20). This means that screening sensitivity is low and a substantial proportion of infectious persons will not be detected at the border, and those that are detected may well have transmitted the virus to other persons before being isolated. This was the experience of several countries during the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus pandemic. For example, in Singapore, of the first 116 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus\u2013infected persons identified with a history of recent international travel, only 15 (12.9%) were identified through screening at the airport (2). In Japan, intensive border screening was in place at the main international airport during April 28\u2013June18, 2009. Of 151 influenza cases that might have been acquired during travel overseas, only 10 (6.6%) were detected as a result of border screening in Japan (4). During the same period in New South Wales, Australia, an estimated 6.7% (3/45) of imported cases were detected at the border (9), and in Auckland, New Zealand, 5.8% (4/69) of the cases were detected at the airport (10). Singapore, Japan, and Australia, but not New Zealand, used ITISs to screen for fevers at their borders, even though the sensitivity of this screening was similarly low at the sites.",

A more recent study involving airline travelers estimated a positive predictive value of ITIS for fever detection of 0.9%\u20134.1% for detecting fever of any cause and a positive predictive value of fever for influenza of 2.0%\u20132.8% for detecting influenza-associated fever (3). Therefore, many persons with possible fever would have to be identified before a case of influenza was detected, and screening for fever is unlikely to be sensitive enough to detect sufficient numbers of influenza cases to prevent or slow the importation of a pandemic strain.",

These models concluded that unless travel restrictions prevented >99% of travel, they would, at best, delay the introduction of pandemic influenza by 2\u20133 weeks, and because of the explosive nature of the epidemic, would have no overall effect on the total number of cases (23\u201325). The results are effectively the same whether travel restrictions are used (as in these models) or screening and isolation/quarantine are used to limit the movement of possibly infectious persons. However, the conclusion from these models (i.e., that allowing only a small number of cases to enter a country would result in an epidemic of the same size as if travel restrictions were not in place) is applicable to screening. It is probable that entry screening with a low rate of detection of incoming cases would also be unlikely to significantly delay the commencement of an epidemic or reduce the total number of cases. The models had also not been validated using data from an influenza pandemic (26). Now that data from the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus pandemic are available, there is an opportunity to validate the models examine the efficacy of border measures.",

            "text": "Fraser et al. (20) modeled the control of communicable diseases according to the diseases\u2019 characteristics of infectiousness during the incubation period and in asymptomatic infections. According to this model, public health measures are likely to be effective if persons are infectious only when symptomatic, particularly if infectivity peaks after the onset of symptoms. This means that infected persons are not infectious during the incubation period or during asymptomatic infection. During SARS virus infection, peak viremia (and assumed infectivity) occurs 10 days after symptom onset (28), and this timing coincides with the severity of symptoms. Persons with asymptomatic infection and persons in the incubation period do not appear to be infectious (27,28). Therefore if case-patients are isolated within 2\u20133 days of infection, transmission will be limited (29). If contacts are quarantined until beyond the incubation period, this will also limit further transmission. High fever (>38\u00b0C) is a common symptom among persons seeking medical care for SARS, but case-patients with fever of <38\u00b0C or who were afebrile have been described and have been implicated in the transmission of SARS in a health care setting (30\u201333). This information suggests that active case finding, isolation, strict infection control, and contact tracing will limit the spread of SARS, and modeling suggests that the combination of these measures would be the most effective control strategy (20,29). This information also suggests that border measures that involve effective case detection (i.e., a high proportion of cases detected), especially if associated with opportunities for effective contact tracing (i.e., contacts quarantined within 2 days of case-patient contact), could be useful strategies for delaying the entry of SARS into a country and limiting opportunities for the virus to spread. However, the long SARS incubation period means that cases of imported disease could easily occur through the border entry of infectious, asymptomatic persons.",

Five suspected/probable SARS case-patients arrived in Canada during the screening period; symptoms developed in all 5 patients after arrival, and none of the cases were detected at the border (6). The authors concluded that because of the very low prevalence of infection among travelers, the positive predictive value of any border screening would be effectively zero (6).",

Goubar et al.

Border screening is resource intensive, and there is a significant opportunity cost for other public health measures if border screening is in place. For example, in Australia during May 2009 (i.e., during the influenza pandemic), an average of 28,685 persons arrived at 8 airports via international air flights (1). Entry screening was in place at the time, and each screening point with an ITIS required 1\u20132 operators at all times when flights were arriving. Trained nurses were required to be present at each airport at all times when there were incoming flights to provide follow-up for any passengers identified through ITIS screening or who self-identified as being unwell. An additional person was employed at each airport at all times when flights were arriving to assist with administrative activities. During April 28, 2009\u2013June 1, 2009, a total of 15,457 (\u22481.5%) airline travelers arriving at airports across Australia were identified as being unwell. Most (84%) of these persons self-identified as being unwell on health declaration cards; only 0.5% were identified by the use of an ITIS (1). Of these 15,457 persons, only 154 were subsequently treated as if they were infected with the pandemic influenza virus.",

Therefore, we also do not recommend border screening for SARS. SARS is, however, amenable to control through the use of a combination of measures: early isolation of confirmed case-patients, quarantine of case-patient contacts, and strict infection control (20,27).

Communication can take many forms, including informational videos, posters, signs, in-flight announcements, flyers, and health alert notices (HANs) (36). During the 2009 influenza pandemic, 44% and 84% of travelers identified as unwell on arrival in Singapore (2) and Australia (1), respectively, self-identified as being ill; this finding suggests that communication to incoming travelers can be a useful mechanism to encourage self-reporting. However, the evidence of the effectiveness of communication measures at borders is limited (6,36). Travel HANS (T-HANs) have been used in the United States by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA) since the 1970s as a communication tool directed to incoming travelers. T-HANs provide travelers with information about a current disease outbreak, symptoms of the disease, and advice about seeking medical care should symptoms occur. T-HANs also include clinical guidance and resources for physicians. Selent et al. (35) evaluated the effectiveness of T-HANs in encouraging the self-identification and health care\u2013seeking behavior of incoming travelers from Haiti during the cholera epidemic in that country in 2010. The evaluation suggested that the T-HANs provided a small positive influence on health care\u2013seeking behavior among incoming travelers (35). The use of current communication technologies (e.g., the Internet or short text messages to mobile phones) could also be investigated. SMS (short message service) messages, for example, have been used successfully in other areas of public health (37).",

Both case-patients sought care at a hospital on the same day during a time when significant SARS transmission was ongoing in Ontario but not in Vancouver.

Border screening generally has high opportunity costs, both financially and in terms of the use of scarce public health staff resources at a time of high need.
