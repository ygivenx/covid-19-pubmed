Most global meningococcal disease over the past half century has been caused by less than ten genotypes, known as the hyperinvasive lineages, as defined by multilocus sequence typing.6, 7 As these genotypes are also carried asymptomatically, their acquisition alone cannot explain all cases of invasive disease.",

Since CEACAM is also expressed on endothelia,15 it may play a role in mediating meningococcal entry into the meninges. In this study, there was no evidence of polymorphism in the Opa binding site, encoded by the first and second exons of each CEACAM gene, affecting disease susceptibility. Polymorphisms in the 5\u2032 extragenic regions upstream of CEACAM6 may, however, be associated with effects on the regulation of gene expression but further functional analyses would be required to test this hypothesis. There is clear evidence, however, that increased surface density of CEACAM proteins leads to increased Opa-mediated uptake of even encapsulated meningococci and expression levels of different CEACAMs on the same cells may also be important in differential mediation of cell signalling.17, 25",

CEACAM3 and CEACAM6, along with other CEACAM proteins are thought to play a role in innate immunity.10, 27 CEACAM3, which consists only of an amino-terminal IgV-like domain, is exclusively expressed on granulocytes and is involved in opsonin-independent phagocytosis and oxidative killing of human-specific bacterial pathogens.11, 28 Taken in conjunction with our data, this may indicate that individuals with protective haplotypes in CEACAM3 and CEACAM6 have improved innate immunity against the meningococcus, whereas the disease-associated haplotype in CEACAM6 may indicate a defect in innate immunity. The underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear however, and would require further analysis of CEACAM polymorphism and function. Different expression levels of alternatively spliced CEACAM isoforms or alternatively posttranslationally processed CEACAM proteins may also play a role in mediating different signalling pathways and in innate immunity29 and it may be useful in the future to investigate levels of CEACAM3 expression on granulocytes and CEACAM6 on other cells of the immune system.",

In the developing world, hyperinvasive lineages are responsible for periodic, large-scale epidemics and pandemics. It is tempting to speculate that genetic polymorphisms, perhaps including those detected in this study, contribute to the observed epidemiological differences by increasing the risk of meningococcal disease in particular populations.",

Confirmation of diagnosis was made by positive meningococcal culture from blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), detection of increased meningococcal antibodies, or by PCR detection of meningococcal DNA in the blood or in CSF. In patients with no microbiological confirmation, meningococcal disease was diagnosed clinically upon presentation with petechial or purpuric rash and fever and features of systemic sepsis or meningitis where no other pathogen could be isolated. A further 56 samples from survivors of meningococcal disease were enrolled via the Meningitis Research Foundation (MRF) charity between 1996 and 1999. The patients' general physician or hospital consultant confirmed the diagnosis. There was no overlap between the three sources of patient recruitment, which together yielded 443 samples. Reliable statistical analysis of the influence of individual polymorphisms and haplotypes on the clinical severity of meningococcal disease was prohibited by the low number of samples from cases for which clinical disease severity scores were known.",

The SNPs appeared only once in the human genome sequence and first round PCR products gave only single bands when analysed by agarose electrophoresis (data not shown). SNPs in CEACAM4, 7 and 8 were not included due to the lack of evidence of their interaction with meningococcal Opa proteins at the time the study was designed. The possibility that some Opa proteins interact with these cannot however be discounted completely since the number of Opa proteins investigated is relatively low. CEACAM1 SNPs were located on average once every 1409 bp. CEACAM3 SNPs were located on average once every 1507 bp. CEACAM5 SNPs were located on average once every 1880 bp.
