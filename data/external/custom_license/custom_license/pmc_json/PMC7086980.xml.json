            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a positive-strand RNA virus that is approximately 15 kb in length and belongs to the family Arteriviridae [5]. PRRSV is one of the most important viruses hindering the development of the swine industry globally, especially with the emergence of highly pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) [5, 38]. Recently, new PRRSV mutant strains have become pandemic in China [1, 16, 17, 35, 37, 39] and are named NADC30-like PRRSV strains for their genomic similarity to the NADC30 strain isolated in the US in 2008 [3]. NADC30-like PRRSV strains feature different recombinations and have produced many mosaic isolates, enhancing their genetic diversity. Currently, the most effective methods to control viral diseases are vaccines and antiviral agents. However, vaccination against PRRSV infection has achieved limited success, primarily due to the high genetic diversity of the virus [9, 10, 22, 29]. In addition to genetic mutation, PRRSV genetic diversity is also generated by recombination among different strains, including vaccine strains [7, 18, 23, 30, 33, 37]. Importantly, commercial vaccines cannot provide complete protection against heterologous PRRSV infection [1, 21]. The problems outlined above indicate that the use of vaccines may not be an ideal strategy for PRRSV control; however, exploring effective anti-PRRSV drugs may overcome these issues.",

IBC possesses a wide spectrum of biological activities, including antibacterial, antifungal, anticancer, anti-reverse-transcriptase, antitubercular and antioxidant functions [14]. However, whether IBC has potential antiviral activity remains unclear. In the current study, for the first time, we observed that IBC has anti-PRRSV activity. Furthermore, after a systematic investigation, we demonstrated that IBC inhibits PRRSV replication at the post-entry stage of PRRSV infection.",

The percentage inhibition was calculated as [(RNA copies in control cells - (RNA copies in cells treated with IBC)] \u00f7 (RNA copies of the control) \u00d7 100 at the indicated IBC concentration, and the value for the control group was set as 1.

To assess the anti-PRRSV activity of IBC, we first evaluated the cytotoxicity of IBC on Marc145 cells (Fig. 1B) and PAM cells (Fig. 1C), and the results indicated that cell viability was not significantly affected by IBC at concentrations up to 25.6 \u03bcM and that the CC50 of IBC for Marc145 cells was 63.09 \u03bcM (data not show). The cytotoxic effect of the IBC solvent (alcohol) was also evaluated, the results of which indicated that the alcohol had no effect on Marc145 cells (Fig. 1B) and PAM cells (Fig. 1C). Next, we evaluated the anti-PRRSV capabilities of IBC in Marc145 cells that were infected with PRRSV HuN4 (MOI = 1) and then treated with different concentrations of IBC. We first determined progeny virus titers and found that IBC significantly inhibited PRRSV replication in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1D). To confirm this finding, we also performed an indirect immunofluorescence assay by staining cells with a PRRSV N protein antibody and then observed PRRSV replication by fluorescence microscopy. As shown in Figure 1E, PRRSV replication was significantly blocked by IBC. Western blot analysis revealed that PRRSV N protein levels decreased markedly, indicating that increasing concentrations of IBC significantly inhibited PRRSV replication (Fig. 1F). To determine whether this inhibition was strain specific, we additionally assayed a currently pandemic NADC30-like strain (HeN-L1) that was isolated in our lab and observed it also to be inhibited by IBC (Fig. 1G). Thus, these data indicate that IBC inhibition of PRRSV is not strain specific. Furthermore, the antiviral activity of IBC against PRRSV HuN4 was both dose dependent and successful, with an IC50 of 3.12 \u03bcM (Fig. 2) and a selectivity index (SI; the ratio of the CC50 to the IC50) of 22.02.\n\n",

The current pandemic strains are highly diverse, and commercial vaccines can provide only partial protection against these strains [27, 40]. Thus, anti-PRRSV drugs may be more suitable for PRRSV control in the future. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been widely used as a source of novel drugs, and many crude TCM herbal extracts have been shown to inhibit PRRSV replication [6, 24, 36]. IBC is extracted from P. corylifolia, which itself is used in TCM [14]. Cheng et al. systematically analyzed seventeen compounds derived from TCMs and tested their PRRSV antiviral activity in vitro [4]. Two compounds, chlorogenic acid and scutellarin, were shown to have great anti-PRRSV replication potential in their study, and the inhibition ratios of chlorogenic acid and scutellarin can reach 90.8 and 61.1%, respectively, at the maximum non-cytotoxic concentrations [4]; in contrast, the IBC inhibition ratio exceeded 90% at 15 \u03bcM, an improvement over the maximum non-cytotoxic concentrations for the other tested compounds. This result indicated that IBC is more effective than chlorogenic acid and scutellarin.",

Akt has been reported to play a positive role in PRRSV gene expression and entry, and PRRSV replication may be dependent on the activation of PI3K/Akt [19, 31, 32, 34]. The ERK signaling pathway has been demonstrated to play an important role in the post-entry steps of the PRRSV replication cycle and to enhance PRRSV infection [15]. The ERK pathway may also contribute to HP-PRRSV pathogenesis [2]. Apoptosis also influences PRRSV replication, since the induction of apoptosis in Marc145 cells increases virus replication [8]. IBC inhibition of PRRSV replication may occur through modulation of the above-mentioned pathway. IBC may be applicable as an efficacious and safe drug for the treatment of some cancers, such as neuroblastoma [20]. IBC has been reported to inhibit SARS-CoV papain-like protease; however, whether IBC inhibits infectious virus was not tested in that study [13]. This study is the first to report that IBC has potent antiviral activity, and we demonstrate here that it blocks PRRSV replication at the initiation of viral RNA replication in vitro. However, there are some unanswered questions that should be further explored in the future. First, whether IBC also shows anti-PRRSV activity in vivo must be investigated. Second, is the blockage of viral RNA formation a direct or indirect effect? Third, are there other viruses that are also inhibited by IBC?",
