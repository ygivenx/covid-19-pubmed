Cases of SARS due to laboratory or animal exposure have been reported since the global outbreak ended, and these events highlight the importance of prompt recognition of cases in preventing larger outbreaks from occurring [1\u20133]. Toronto was the site of the largest SARS outbreak outside of Asia, but previous clinical descriptions of the Toronto outbreak did not include all patients and did not use microbiological methods to classify cases [4\u20138]. We conducted a retrospective study of the entire Toronto SARS outbreak, using microbiological methods for case classification, to identify epidemiological and clinical findings that may be useful in early diagnosis of SARS.",

Patients were classified as confirmed SARS, indeterminate SARS or excluded SARS based on their exposure history, clinical illness and the results of microbiological testing. Patients were classified as confirmed SARS if they had a compatible clinical illness (fever or nonproductive cough or dyspnea), an exposure to SARS (direct contact with a known SARS case or travel to a SARS-endemic area or time spent at an institution where SARS transmission was occurring, within 12 days of symptom onset), and a positive microbiological test (positive acute or convalescent serology, or positive PCR from clinical or pathological specimens). SARS was excluded in patients that had negative convalescent serology, or when retrospective investigations ruled out an exposure to SARS (e.g. a case where the patient\u2019s only exposure to SARS was direct contact with a suspected SARS patient who later was determined to be seronegative). Patients were classified as indeterminate if they had a documented exposure and compatible clinical history, but did not have definitive results from microbiological testing (i.e. convalescent serology was not performed, acute serology was not performed or was negative, and PCR testing was not performed or was negative).",

Transmission due to travel or exposure within the community was distinctly uncommon. The tendency of SARS to transmit primarily within the nosocomial setting has been described in the majority of other SARS outbreaks [13\u201317].",

Fever, although nonspecific, is the central symptom of SARS; it was often the initial symptom of illness, was present at or prior to admission in 97% of cases, and often persisted into the second week of illness. Respiratory symptoms, although a common feature of SARS frequently used in diagnostic algorithms, are often absent initially, rise in incidence over time, and are present in the majority of patients only late in the first week or early in the second week of illness, often after patients have been diagnosed and admitted to hospital. The incidence of pulmonary infiltrates seen on chest radiography parallels the evolution of respiratory symptoms, and many patients did not have documented infiltrates at the time of admission to hospital.",

Although the presence of fever is a nonspecific finding, the absence of a history of fever in a patient presenting to hospital several days after the onset of illness suggests that SARS is unlikely, given that 94% of SARS patients have fever by day 4 of illness, and 97% have fever by admission. On the other hand, the absence of respiratory symptoms or pulmonary infiltrates early in disease does not reduce the likelihood of SARS, as these may be late-onset findings. In some cases, careful follow-up with repeated clinical, laboratory and radiographic assessment can aid diagnosis, and this approach has been demonstrated to be useful [12, 18]. The presence of symptoms common in other infectious illnesses, but uncommon in SARS, is useful in lowering the probability of SARS, i.e., rhinorrhea, sore throat, productive cough and an elevated absolute neutrophil count are more common in patients without SARS. Features more common in confirmed SARS than in excluded cases included the presence of fever on the first day of illness, documented fever at admission, pulmonary infiltrates at admission, and leukopenia, lymphopenia or thrombocytopenia at admission. The presence of these findings may raise concerns about SARS, but they may be less useful diagnostically as they occur frequently in other conditions that may mimic SARS, such as community-acquired pneumonia [19]. Conversely, their absence lowers the likelihood of SARS, but none as much as the absence of fever at admission, given that the incidence of the other findings in confirmed SARS cases is considerably lower than the incidence of fever at admission.",

Biased or incomplete recording of clinical information could thus affect the accuracy of our results. Patients not admitted to the hospital were not considered. Patients that developed SARS following hospital admission were excluded from the analysis of clinical presentation. Finally, the number of patients in the excluded group was small, limiting our power to detect differences between the confirmed and excluded groups. Despite these limitations, we believe the results of our study are both valid and important. The unexpected emergence of SARS prevented large-scale prospective evaluations from being undertaken in most areas; we are therefore dependent on retrospective data to improve our understanding of SARS, despite the inherent limitations of this approach. Because asymptomatic SARS is rare, transmission has rarely been documented from mildly symptomatic cases, and >90% of seropositive patients identified in Toronto were admitted to hospital, we believe our results are widely applicable [20\u201322]. Because the 15 patients that developed SARS during hospitalization were excluded, extrapolation of our data to such patients should be made cautiously. Finally, although the small size of our excluded group suggests that the results of the between group comparisons should be interpreted cautiously, our results are consistent with those of other studies [23].",
