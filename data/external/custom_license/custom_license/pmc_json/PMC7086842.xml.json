PEDV causes a devastating enteric disease that is characterized by watery diarrhea, dehydration and significant mortality in piglets, thereby resulting in tremendous economic losses to the swine industry in Europe and Asia, including Japan, Korea, and China [6, 7, 17, 20].",

            "text": "The PEDV genome is approximately 28 kb in length and contains seven open reading frames (ORFs), which encode replicase 1a and 1b, the spike (S), ORF3, envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N), arranged in the order 5\u2032-replicase(1a/1b)-S-ORF3-E-M-N-3\u2032 [14]. Two long ORFs (ORF1a and ORF1b) encode the non-structural replicase polyproteins (replicase 1a and 1b), which occupy two thirds of the genome. Genes for the major structural proteins S, E, M, and N are located downstream of the replicase gene. The S glycoprotein makes up the large surface projections of the virion and plays an important role in binding to specific host cell receptor glycoproteins, with subsequent penetration into the cells occurring via membrane fusion. The S glycoprotein also stimulates production of neutralizing antibodies by the host [8]. The M protein is essential for viral envelope formation and release. It not only induces antibodies that neutralize the virus in the presence of complement [18] but also stimulates the production of interferon-\u03b1 (IFN-\u03b1) [13]. In addition, the ORF3 gene is the only accessory gene, and it has been suggested to be an important determinant of virulence in PEDV. The virulence of the virus can be reduced by altering the ORF3 gene through cell culture adaptation, in a manner similar to that for transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) [19, 23], and its differentiation may be a marker of adaptation to cell culture and virus attenuation [15, 19]. Thus, differentiation of the ORF3 gene could be a valuable tool for molecular epidemiological studies of PEDV [6, 15, 19].",
