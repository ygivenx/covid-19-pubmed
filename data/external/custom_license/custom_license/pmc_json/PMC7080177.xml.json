HcAb devoids of light chains naturally, but keeps the function of conventional antibodies depend on three complementarity determining regions in variable domain. The sdAb displays very significant characteristics including a small molecular weight of 15 kDa, ease of expression in Escherichia coli (E. coli) and purification, high expression yields, high solubility and thermostability, and stability at extreme pH conditions that are superior to conventional antibodies (Anderson et al. 2017; Dumoulin et al. 2002). In addition, sdAb is easily selected and cloned by selection systems such as phage, yeast, or ribosomal display (Harmsen and De Haard 2007; Muyldermans et al. 2009). These attributes make sdAbs suitable for many medical, biotechnological, diagnostic, and therapeutic applications (Arbabi-Ghahroudi 2017; Bannas et al. 2017; Beghein and Gettemans 2017; Gonzalez-Sapienza et al. 2017).",

PEDV, a member of the genus Coronavirus, family Coronaviridae, is the causative agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. and King 2012), the most economically important disease affecting the global swine industry today (Van Diep et al. 2018). PEDV encodes four major structural proteins, membrane (M) (27\u201332 kDa), envelope (E) (7 kDa), spike (S) (180\u2013220 kDa), and nucleocapsid (N) (55\u201358 kDa) (Utiger et al. 1995; Yeo et al. 2003). The M protein is the most abundant of structural proteins and is involved in the assembly of viral nucleocapsid and membrane. In addition, the nucleotide sequence of the M gene is highly conserved among different PEDV strains but shows little homology with other coronaviruses (Kim and Chae 2000). Thus, the M protein has been used as a target antigen for PEDV detection (Ren et al. 2011; Shenyang et al. 2007).",

The capacity of the library was 107 of that calculated by the positive clone numbers. After infection with M13K07 helper phage, the phage display library was obtained. Approximately 1011 phage particles from the phage library were screened against M-GST by four rounds of panning. Under stringent panning conditions, the enriching factor of output and input phages increased steadily, with more than 103-fold increment of phage recovery after the fourth round of panning compared with that from the first one.

In the current study, sdAb-Mc37 showed high Kd value, conjugated with a ZnS-capped CdSe QDs. Moreover, the ability of QD-sdAb to act as targeting probes for imaging PEDV in vero cells was evaluated by direct immunofluorescence assay. The observed fluorescence in vero cells stained with QD-sdAb probe nicely reflected that PEDV virions can be reliably recognized and labeled by QD-sdAb probe that was further confirmed by an indirect immunofluorescence assay and qRT-PCR. As a diagnostic reagent, QD-sdAb probe used in direct immunofluorescence assay showed high efficiency with lesser steps and shorter times compared with indirect immunofluorescence assay. Additionally, as a molecular tracer, sdAb has been used to tracing antigens in different subcellular compartments in living cells (Rothbauer et al. 2006), targeting brain epitopes by transmigrating through blood-brain barrier (Abulrob et al. 2005) and detecting the activity of cell proteins in vivo (Iqbal et al. 2010).

For the viruses, however, most applications focus on efficient and rapid detection. Whether the viruses separated by nanoparticles can be propagated in cells and used for further research is still not clear. Thus, magnetic nanobeads were functionalized with sdAb-Mc29 and were tried to be used as a tool for the isolation of virus in this study. The characteristics of binders were responsible for the final application of its functionalized nanobeads. Fortunately, sdAb-Mc29 showed excellent specificity and affinity but did not have neutralizing activity, which perfectly fit the destination of this research. For the analysis of the capture activity, IMNBs were incubated with recombinant M protein and CV777. The captured M protein was clearly reflected by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Meanwhile, virions around the IMNBs were observed directly by TEM, suggesting that PEDV can be separated from mixture of cells by the IMNBs.",

Interestingly, the cytopathic effects were observed at 12 h post-incubation of IMNBs-virus composite with vero cells that was not observed on the control cells. The further assay of direct immunofluorescence assay, qPCR, TEM, and spike protein gene sequencing confirmed that one epidemic strain of PEDV named JXDV1801 was successfully isolated by using IMNBs. The growth kinetics analysis indicated that JXDV1801 can replicate efficiently and propagate stably in vero cells. Thus, a novel, practicable, and efficient tool for PEDV isolation from clinical complex samples was developed in this research. Our research expanded the spectrum of application of sdAb and provided a novel method for isolation of virus from clinical samples.",
