The clinical signs and pathological lesions of PEDV infection are similar to those of TGEV; the diseases are characterized by acute watery diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, and weight loss [1]. PEDV and TGEV can cause viral enteritis and severe diarrhea with high morbidity and mortality in suckling piglets [2, 3]. PEDV and TGEV have been associated with significant economic losses in farms [4, 5]. PEDV was first observed among pigs in England in 1971 [6], whereas TGEV was isolated for the first time in 1946 [7]. Currently, PEDV and TGEV occur in parts of Europe, North America, and Asia [8\u201310].",

Differential diagnosis of PEDV and TGEV relies mainly on conventional reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and serological assays [14, 15]. Nanoparticle-assisted polymerase chain reaction (nanoPCR) is a type of sensitive PCR assay in which nanofluids are formed after solid nanoparticles (1\u2013100 nm diameter) are suspended in the PCR system. The thermal conductivity of nanofluids is greater than that of ordinary fluids, allowing extremely rapid changes in temperature so that target temperatures are reached more quickly [16].",

Multiplexing in this manner is useful because viruses such as PEDV, TGEV, PRV, and PRRSV may simultaneously infect pigs. Our duplex nanoPCR assay detected PEDV and TGEV with sensitivity comparable to that of conventional PCR. Most diagnostic procedures for coronaviruses, including RT-qPCR, are based on the nucleocapsid protein (N) gene, as it is the most abundantly expressed viral protein and can be detected soon after infection [21]. The duplex nanoPCR assay was successful only when PEDV and TGEV served as the template, indicating that the method is specific and applicable for differential diagnosis. To our knowledge, this is the first report regarding the establishment and optimization of a duplex nanoPCR assay for the N genes of PEDV and TGEV. The duplex nanoPCR assay reported here may be useful for the clinical diagnosis of PEDV and TGEV infection. In a screening of 114 samples collected from piglets in China, the duplex nanoPCR assay detected PEDV at a slightly higher rate in comparison with conventional PCR, while the assays had similar sensitivity for TGEV.",
