Recently, adenoviral vectors were found to be very effective for mucosal vaccination due to their natural tropism for the mucosal surfaces.2 It is noted, however, that the main cellular receptor for Ad, coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR), has been readily detected in a wide range of human tissues, which may potentially have undesirable consequences.3, 4, 5 These findings prompted several groups to conduct various genetic modifications of the Ads to improve the delivery efficiency and/or minimize the relatively random distribution of the injected Ads by re-targeting the Ads to dendritic cells (DCs).",

The possibilities of DC-based strategies for immunotherapy and immunoprotection of cancer, infectious disease and transplantation have been vigorously investigated during the past several years.1 However, DCs are deficient in expression of the CAR receptor, presenting a challenge for effective transduction of these cells by Ads.1 In addition, there is also a concern that the cytopathic effect of high-dose Ad on DCs could compromise clinical value of recombinant Ads.3 To overcome these limitations, re-targeting delivery strategies via modification of the tropism of the virus have been developed for better transduction into DCs. One approach involves genetic modification of the fiber/knob proteins of Ad to target the surface intergrins of DCs.6, 7 Another approach is to target the CD40 surface receptor of DCs8, 9 since the CD40 receptor may play essential roles in promoting both DC activation and antigen presentation.10, 11, 12, 13, 14 To this end, the viruses were usually complexed with bi-specific adaptor molecules comprised of either anti-Ad single-chain antibody or the extracellular domain of CAR with the targeting CD40 ligand (CD40L).8, 9 While marked improvement of transduction efficiency and enhanced immune responses against the transgenes delivered by various targeted Ad vectors have been reported by others and us, systematic analyses of biodistribution, toxicity and immune responses following various administration routes remains poorly documented. Uncertainties also remain with respect to other forms of delivery (DNA- and protein-based system). For instance, even though CD40L has been consistently shown to enhance Th1 (cellular) immune response, its role in Th2 (humoral) response remains unclear, with some reports suggesting an increased antibody response and others reporting no adjuvant effect of CD40L.15, 16, 17, 18, 19 Lack of knowledge in these areas could substantially hinder the transition from laboratory investigations to clinical application of CD40-targeted gene delivery and genetic vaccination.",

To this end, Ad-Luc conjugated with CFm40L as described previously9 was used to transduce human CD40(+) DCs in the presence or absence of anti-CD40L. As compared with the unmodified Ad, the relative luciferase activity for the CFm40L-complexed Ads is 1307-fold higher with the addition of 80 ng CFm40L, 1491-fold with 120 ng and 1799-fold with 200 ng (Figure 1a), respectively. Each reaction had four replicates. The experiments were repeated three times with similar findings. Importantly, the addition of 0.5 and 2.0 \u03bcg of anti-CD40L mAb into the pre-complexed Ads largely prevented the enhanced luciferase activities, while pre-mixing with 2.0 \u03bcg of normal mouse immunoglobulin (Ig) G did not show any inhibition of luciferase activity. Also as a control, Ads pre-complexed with 120 ng of bovine serum albumin (BSA) did not result in enhancement of luciferase activity in the transduced cells. These results further confirmed that the enhanced gene transduction into both human and murine DCs by Ads complexed with CFm40L is mediated by the CD40 receptor. We next determined whether tAd could still transduce DCs in the presence of Ad-neutralizing antibodies. Towards this end, we infected human peripheral blood-derived DCs with Ad\u2013CFm40L complexes in the presence of Ad-negative and Ad-positive ascites fluids collected from ovarian cancer patients from a phase I gene therapy clinical trial. The ascites M56 (patient \u2018M\u2019, day 56 after Ad administration) has been shown to have high (>1:16 000) Ad-neutralizing antibody titres, and the ascites B0 (patient \u2018B\u2019, day 0 of Ad administration) to have none.20 Furthermore, the ability of the ascites M56 to neutralize Ad infectivity and the lack of neutralizing capability by the ascites B0 was previously documented in the same studies.20 We again confirmed the absence of anti-Ad antibodies in ascites B0 and their presence in ascites M56 with the titre of 1:65 610 in Ad enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; Supplementary Figure S1). Then Ad vector-encoding luciferase was pre-complexed with CFm40L (50 ng per 1.25 \u00d7 106 PFU per 2.5 \u00d7 104 cells) mixed with the ascites at 1:1 and 1:1000 dilutions and applied to DCs. Luciferase activity was measured in cell lysates 36 h post transduction. The results (Figure 1b) indicate that neutralizing antibodies had no inhibitory effects on CFm40L mediated Ad-Luc transduction of human DCs.",

We chose this ratio between Ad and CFm40L since 80 ng of CFm40L is sufficient to complex 2.5 \u00d7 106 Ad for enhanced transduction in vitro (Figure 1a). In agreement with other reports with i.v. administration,14, 22, 23, 24, 25 the Ad was detected after 3 and 7 days in a wide range of tissues, with the liver and spleen expressing the highest luciferase activities on day 3, followed by mesenteric lymph nodes (a visible cluster of lymph nodes inside the peritoneal cavity), heart, colon and others (Figure 2a). Yet, a noticeably altered biodistribution was observed with tAd-Luc (Figure 2b), that is in addition to the predominant disposition to the liver and spleen, the viruses were also effectively captured by thymus and the lung on day 3 (Figure 2b).",

Clearly, the infection of the brain was largely ablated with the use of tAd-Luc, but not the infection of other tissues such as lung, heart, thymus, colon, muscle and mesenteric lymph nodes (Figures 4a and b), suggesting CAR-mediated inadvertent infection of the brain by non-modified Ad. This interpretation is further supported by the observation that pre-complex of Ad-Luc with BSA did not prevent brain infection (Figure 4c). Interestingly, no significant difference of virus deposition between tAd-Luc and Ad-Luc in the heart was observed following i.n. administration (Figures 4a and b), an observation that differs from that following i.v. injection, which shows the heart took up more Ad-Luc than tAd-Luc following i.v. administration (Figure 2). We have no definite explanation for these findings. It is plausible, however, that since the heart is in close proximity of the lung, tAd-Luc could gain access more easily to the heart following i.n. delivery than with the i.v. route (tail vein).",

As compared to the control mice injected with buffers only (Figure 5, panel a), i.n. delivery of Ad-Luc resulted in moderate accumulations of mononuclear leukocytes in many peribronchial and perivascular areas, typical of inflammatory reactions (Figure 5, panel b). Following the i.n. administration of Ad-NP expressing the nucleocapsid protein (NP) of SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV NP was used here as a model antigen), however, there are much more significant accumulations of mononuclear leukocytes in the peribronchial and perivascular areas throughout the entire histological section and infiltration of mononuclear cells in the alveolar spaces (Figure 5, panel c). In the severely affected area, the airway epithelial cells demonstrate mild-to-moderate damage and sloughing, revealing an \u2018exaggerated\u2019 inflammatory reaction in the lung (Figure 5, panels c and e). The reason for the visible damage to the airway epithelial cell layers by Ad-NP but not by Ad-Luc could be due to the intrinsic property of NP, a strong immunogen in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients, as was suggested (see below for discussion). It is of note that with the addition of CFm40L (denoted as tAd-NP), the excessive infiltration of inflammatory cells and the damage of epithelial cells were abolished (Figure 5, panel d). Taken together, a significantly altered pattern of biodistribution of Ad complexed with CFm40L was observed following i.v. and i.n. administrations. Attenuation of inadvertent infection of the brain and aggravated local inflammation has been demonstrated in the airway of the lung following i.n. administration. Finally, none of the Ad preparations (unconjugated or conjugated, irrespective of administration route) resulted in detectable signs of systematic toxicity following analyses of various blood biomarkers (blood chemistry) pertinent to vital organs such as kidney, heart and liver (data not shown), even though visible damages to the airway epithelial cells were found following i.n. administration of Ad-NP. We also conducted immunohistological examinations of available lung tissues using antibodies against both luciferase and CD11c, one of the surface markers for DCs. Preliminary results suggest that the tAd-Luc was mainly found in CD11c(+) cells, while Ad-Luc were not restricted to CD11c(+) cells (Supplementary Figure S2). Clearly, more vigorous investigations will be needed to identify all cell types that also express CD40.",

We chose the same amount of virus used in the above biodistribution experiments. Thirty days post-prime, the mice were boosted once. The splenocytes were isolated on days 0, 15 and 30 post boosting for the determination of interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) and interleukin-2 (IL-2). As shown in Figures 6a and b, following i.d. administration, both IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 specific for SARS-CoV NP, have been increased in mice immunized with either Ad-NP or tAd-NP compared with the control (mice receiving Ad-Luc). However, it is of note that on day 30 after boosting, the levels of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 in mice receiving tAd-NP were substantially higher than those immunized with Ad-NP, suggesting a more sustained Th1 response with the use of CFm40L (Figures 6a and b). Furthermore, such an enhancement of Ag-specific host immune response by CFm40L has also been observed with the i.n. injection route (Figures 6c and d).

Such an altered biodistribution pattern is unlikely due to detargeting of CAR since modified adenoviral vectors ablated for CAR have been shown to have an overall reduced efficiency of gene expression in tissues but not a change of biodistribution pattern.36, 37 In contrast, we found the expression levels of transgenes delivered by the two vectors were comparable in certain tissues such as liver and spleen (i.v. administration). Furthermore, we observed the thymus and lung took up more tAd than Ad, a fact that also differs from the detargeting of CAR following i.v. administration.36, 38 These data suggest that the altered biodistribution pattern is due to CD40 targeting rather than detargeting of CAR.",

It is interesting that under normal circumstances the lung is not the major tissue/organ that takes up unmodified Ad following intravascular administration (Figure 2a). The pulmonary intravascular macrophages, however, can take up unexpectedly high amounts of the Ad5 virus in animals with hepatic disorders, such as cirrhosis, resulting in severe pulmonary pathology.5 Clearly, better understanding of the biodistribution of both unmodified and modified Ad vector is of importance, given that such knowledge helps understand the clearance of virus vector as well as identify the tissues/organs, which could be predisposed to adverse events during the course of gene therapy.5, 40",

Such deleterious effects of Ad-NP were apparently caused by strong local inflammatory reactions as suggested by a massive infiltration of lymphocytes and macrophages. Yet, no such exaggerated local inflammatory reactions were observed in mice receiving tAd-NP. At this time, we have no definite explanation for the marked differences of local inflammatory reactions between Ad-NP and tAd-NP. Yet, it is interesting to note that we and others reported that the SARS-CoV NP protein itself, used in this study as model antigen, could alter cellular signal transduction pathways, stimulate pro-inflammatory cytokine production and/or even cell death.45, 46 Therefore, the excessive inflammatory reactions or toxicity induced by Ad-NP are likely due to the combined immunostimulatory or immunopathologic effects of Ad infection and NP protein. This notion is also supported by the observation that Ad-Luc failed to induce the same magnitude of local inflammatory reactions (Figure 5b).",

            "text": "The markedly delayed Ag-specific mucosal and systemic antibody responses with the use of CFm40L adaptor proteins were somewhat surprising, given the fact that most reports in the literature suggest that CD40L activates both cellular and humoral immune responses against antigens delivered in the form of proteins or DNA constructs.15, 16, 17, 18, 19 However, our findings are in partial agreement with two studies demonstrating CD40L lacks stimulatory effects on the production of Ag-specific antibodies.17, 50 It is unlikely that the biased immune responses reported here were linked to the identity of the transgene as similar observations (more sustained IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 but reduced antibody titres at later time points) were observed with both tAd-NP and tAd-Luc (Supplementary Figure S3). In addition, the use of tAd resulted in decreased antibody levels against other adenoviral proteins (Figure 10). However, since both transgenes in this current study (SARS-CoV NP and firefly luciferase) were intracellular proteins, it remains to be determined whether tAd encoding a secreted transgene would result in a similar pattern of immune responses. It is noted, however, others recently reported in a different system (soluble proteins) that CD40-targeted secreted proteins failed to generate a stronger antibody response compared with the untargeted secreted proteins.17 At this time, we think a variety of factors could be ascribed to the differences of results with respect to the patterns of immune responses among various groups. One of them might be due to the differences in the vector systems. It is understood that ours is the only study employing live viral vector in conjunction with CD40L, while other systems were designed to deliver the antigens in the form of DNA plasmid, soluble proteins or virus-like particles.15, 16, 17, 18, 19 Second, the biased immune response might be due to a much lower level of transgene expression with the use of tAd vector at the site of the body receiving the viral vectors. For instance, as compared with Ad, \u223c300-fold less transgene expression in the injection site skin (Figures 3a and b) was observed following i.d. injection of tAd, while about 180-fold less in the lungs 3 days after i.n. administration (Figures 4a and b). In general, Ag-specific humoral responses are not preferentially elicited in response to smaller amounts of antigens as compared with cellular immune responses. Third, the tAd-induced biased immune responses could be tAd interacting with B cells. There are previous reports documenting that CD40 ligation could lead to largely positive growth outcomes for resting B cells, but inhibited the growth and Ig production of activated B cells which are also known to be CD40(+).39, 51, 52, 53 Given these findings, caution appears to be warranted when considering CD40L as targeting moiety for adenoviral vectors in genetic immunization when induction of humoral immune response is crucial, that is, neutralizing antibodies against pathogens. Nevertheless, therapeutic manipulation to facilitate biased or skewed immune responses could be beneficial in clinical applications. For instance, type 2-biased immune responses (predominant antibody reactions) may be associated with certain immunopathologic complications, such as allergy, asthma and autoimmune diseases. Thereby, redirection of the immune response or therapeutic manipulation towards a biased immune response, that is suppression of antibody responses, could help reverse medical conditions related to certain immunopathologic complications.38, 54 Furthermore, enhanced cellular immune responses are well known to play critical roles eliminating or containing certain intracellular pathogens and cancers.10, 11, 12, 28, 41 Finally, as preliminary data presented in this report, the efficient in vitro gene transduction by tAd even in the presence of anti-Ad neutralizing antibodies and lower levels of antibodies against Ad viral proteins in vivo might also help allay one of the major concerns associated with pre-existing immunity against Ad. We are currently conducting more in-depth in vivo studies to address these issues.",

All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the guidelines and protocols for animal experiments at Health Canada. The mice were maintained in a laminar airflow cabinet under pathogen-free conditions and used at 6\u20137 weeks of age. A total of 1 \u00d7 109 PFU (\u223c1 \u00d7 1010 viral particles) of Ads suspended in 100 \u03bcl of PBS per mouse was administrated using a syringe with a 29-gauge needle by i.v. (tail veil), intradermal (i.d.) (inguinal) or i.n. routes. Control mice were injected with 100 \u03bcl of PBS. The preparation of Ads complexed with CFm40L was described previously.9 In brief, the same amounts of Ads was mixed with 16 \u03bcg CFm40L (that is 80 ng CFm40L/5 \u00d7 106 PFU Ads) in 100 \u03bcl of PBS and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min. The mice were killed on days 3 and 7 after administration of Ads, with tissues collected for subsequent analyses of biodistribution. The levels of luciferase activity, normalized by protein concentration, were determined. Five mice were used in each group. Pathological examination of tissues using hematoxylin and eosin staining method was conducted using a standard procedure.",

We chose the same amount of virus as in the above biodistribution experiments. For immunization, five mice were primed with 1 \u00d7 1010 VP of Ad-NP, tAd-NP or tAd-Luc (negative control). Thirty days post administration, the mice were boosted once. The splenocytes were isolated on days 0, 15 and 30 post boosting for the determination of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2. Splenocytes were isolated from mouse spleens by grinding them between the frosted ends of two microscope slides. The slides were rinsed with 5 ml of RPMI 1640 medium to collect the cells. Afterwards, the cell suspension was passed through a fine nylon mesh to obtain a single cell suspension. The spleen pieces were then gently mashed with the rubber end of a syringe plunger. A second filtration was then performed by pipetting the 5 ml suspensions of dispersed cells through a fresh 70-\u03bcm nylon mesh cell strainer into a 50-ml conical tube (on ice). This procedure was repeated with additional washes of 5 ml medium until the splenic capsules turned white (3\u20134 more times). The total volume of cell suspension was brought up to 20 ml with medium. Cell pellets were then obtained by centrifugation at 400 g for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C. About 1 ml of 0.84% NH4Cl solution was used to lyse the red blood cells. The tubes were gently rolled by hand for 2 min at room temperature, followed by the addition of 30 ml of chilled RPMI medium After passing the cells through another layer of 70-\u03bcm nylon mesh, cells were collected by centrifugation at 400 g for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C. The pellet was then gently resuspended to 2 \u00d7 106 cells per 100 \u03bcl (2 \u00d7 107 cells per ml) in RPMI 1640 containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum in the presence of 10 purified SARS-CoV NPs (10 \u03bcg ml\u22121) to stimulate Ag-specific cytokine.43 As stimulation with NP of splenocytes derived from the control animals receiving Ad-Luc did not result in any detectable production of cytokines (background), all subsequent experiments were conducted in the presence of 10 \u03bcg ml\u22121 of NP. These cells were then used at 100 \u03bcl per well for ELISPOT assays using procedures as provided by the supplier, R&D system.",
