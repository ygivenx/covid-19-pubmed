Although all epicatechins except EC can potentially suppress cell proliferation (13\u201318), EGCG appears the most promising and is therefore under clinical investigation in chemoprevention trials (19). However, given the wide range in physiologic potency of the different catechins, an exclusive focus on EGCG is probably short-sighted. EGCG is reportedly more effective than EGC in decreasing the intestinal absorption of cholesterol (20) and it is the most potent catechin inhibitor of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (21), but ECG has the strongest collagenase inhibitory effect (22) and the highest antioxidant potential (23). By contrast, only EGC is a potent mediator of oxidative modification and an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase during hepatic catabolism of purines (24).",

Gupta and others (26) have documented that G0/G1-phase arrest is independent of p53 mutation, and EGCG treatment of DU145 induces the cyclin kinase inhibitor WAF1/p21. These observations suggest that EGCG imposes a cell-cycle checkpoint (19). However, our results showed that ECG may be more potent than EGCG for inhibition of primary and metastatic CaP and EOC cells (Fig. 4, Tables 1 and 2).

Our in vitro dose of 100 \u00b5M is equivalent to 29 mg (EC/EGC) to 45 mg (EGCG/ECG), far less than the 100\u2013150 mg (50% of which is EGCG) in one cup of green tea. However, Lee et al.

This suggests that drinking more than 10 cups of green tea may be necessary to maintain a plasma concentration of EGCG equivalent to that used in vitro by a dose of 50 \u00b5M or 22.5 mg. Kaegi (42) suggested a daily intake of 13 cups of green tea as a chemopreventive measure.
