Literally dual use means nothing more and nothing less than that a certain activity or a certain object can be applied in at least two ways. This is the case with almost everything that has been designed or developed, but also with objects that are not human made, like natural herbs. To give some examples: a kitchen knife can be used to cut, but also sometimes as an alternative for a screw driver and indeed also to stab someone.1 Palliative pills are meant to alleviate pain, but if someone takes enough of these pills they can be used for committing suicide. This list can be continued endlessly. Almost every artefact and many natural products can be applied in a dual or even multiple use way. The dual or multiple ways an artefact can be used are not always intended by the designer. A screwdriver is not designed to stab a person. In pharmaceutical research unexpected or unintended effects of medicines also can lead to dual use. Sometimes the original function even is displaced by the unintended one. A well-known example is the Viagra pill. This pill had been designed against angina pectoris, but is now used for almost 100% to solve erection problems.",

As was said above this possibility of dual use of artefacts and of knowledge is possible with almost everything that is designed or produced. But in the present situation the most important application of the concept of dual use is related to weapons of mass destruction (WMD). As nuclear weapons are the most important of the WMD the concept was first applied in debates about the risk of misuse of nuclear technology. The concept of dual use in relation to nuclear weapons is most significant because of the regime of arms control. Inspections of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) are mainly directed at discovering intended or perhaps unintended activities of countries that can be seen as a breach of the Non Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Because of this link with the NPT states are the main actors that IAEA focuses upon, as is illustrated by the recent discussions about Iran and North Korea. But of course the risks of (nuclear) terrorism have not gone unnoticed by IAEA. In its mid term strategy for the period 2006\u20132011 IAEA has as one of its goals to \u201cdevelop a comprehensive set of recommendations and guidelines for the international community, for the prevention, detection and response to acts of nuclear terrorism or other malicious acts, along with an appropriate review process\u201d (IAEA 2006).",

To gain insight in this question it is useful to start with describing the arms control context of biological weapons. This context is determined by the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC 1972). The BTWC was signed in 1972 and came into force in 1975. In those years BTWC was one of a greater number of arms control agreements during the Cold War period. The BTWC became possible\u2014as Fidler and Gostin write\u2014when the United States decided unilaterally to terminate its offensive program on biological weapons (Fidler and Gostin 2008, p. 47). The Soviet Union and other main powers followed. And so the first treaty that required real disarmament came into being.3 The main article of the BTWC is article I:Each State Party to this Convention undertakes never in any circumstances to develop, produce, stockpile or otherwise acquire or retain:(1) Microbial or other biological agents, or toxins whatever their origin or method of production, of types and in quantities that have no justification for prophylactic, protective or other peaceful purposes;(2) Weapons, equipment or means of delivery designed to use such agents or toxins for hostile purposes or in armed conflict.",

            "text": "Has the concept of dual use been an important element of the Convention? This was not the case until after the anthrax attacks of 2001. The words \u201cdual use\u201d do not appear in the text of the Convention nor in any of the final declarations of the six review conferences that have been organized since 1980. However, during the Sixth Review Conference (2006) explicit attention was given to what is called the misuse of biotechnology: \u201cThe Conference recognizes that while recent scientific and technological developments in the field of biotechnology would increase the potential for cooperation among States Parties and thereby strengthen the Convention, they could also increase the potential for the misuse of both science and technology\u201d (Final Document Sixth Review Conference BTWC 2006, p. 19). The Conference decides to contribute one of the intersessional meetings to \u201cOversight, education, awareness raising, and adoption and/or development of codes of conduct with the aim of preventing misuse in the context of advances in bio-science and bio-technology research with the potential of use for purposes prohibited by the Convention\u201d (Final Document Sixth Review Conference BTWC 2006, p. 25). In 2008 an Expert Meeting and an Intersessional Meeting of States Parties were organized about the risks of misuse of biotechnology. In a report which synthesizes the discussions of the Expert Meeting 2008 the concept of dual use is mentioned in relation to the development of codes of conduct (Document BWC/MSP 2008, p. 7\u20138). Dual use is linked to three different words: biological agents or toxins, potential (of research) and directly to research. These different ways to apply dual use indicate that\u2014even on the level of state parties of the BTWC\u2014dual use is not an unequivocal concept. This can be illustrated by the recent discussions on the dual use character of synthetic biology.",

            "text": "It is remarkable that dual use was seen as an important issue almost from the beginning of the development of synthetic biology (De Vriend 2006, p. 54\u201357). What is the dual use risk of synthetic biology? Tucker and Zilinskas argue that \u201cat present, the primary threat of misuse [of synthetic biology] appears to come from state-level biological warfare programs\u201d. They refer to former Soviet scholars who could be engaged in such projects. But at the same page they state that these developments are \u201cextremely unlikely\u201d (Tucker and Zilinskas 2006, p. 38). Tucker and Zilinskas point to other risks: one of the possible scenarios for the deliberate misuse of synthetic biology involves a \u201clone operator,\u201d such as a highly trained molecular biologist who develops an obsessive grudge against certain individuals or groups (or society as a whole) (Tucker and Zilinskas 2006, p. 17). The other risk comes from so called biohackers, e.g. college kids who are eager to demonstrate their technological abilities (Tucker and Zilinskas 2006, p. 18). The growth of the number of do-it-yourself-biologists has indeed got attention of the authorities. The American Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) \u201chas adopted what some call a \u2018neighbourhood watch\u2019 stance. The approach relies on biohackers monitoring their own community and reporting behaviour they find threatening\u201d (Ledford 2010). If indeed second hand tools for genome assembly are becoming available to the public at affordable costs then this would seem to add weight to the concerns over possible misuse of synthetic biology research (Balmer and Martin 2008).",

Tucker and Zilinskas state that \u201cthe most likely misapplication of synthetic biology for hostile purposes involves the recreation of known pathogenic viruses in the laboratory\u201d (Tucker and Zilinskas 2006, p. 16). If this is the case, the new element is in the aspect of recreation (e.g. of the Spanish flu virus). Problems can arise if such a recreated virus is misused for biological weapons or bioterrorism. But there is essentially no difference with the dual use issue in traditional biology. Although there still are many unknown factors Tucker and Zilinskas think it \u201clikely that, given the difficulty of anticipating and assessing the risks associated with synthetic organisms, synthetic biology will require a new approach to regulation that differs significantly from the NIH [National Institutes of Health] Guidelines on recombinant DNA [Deoxyribonucleic acid]\u201d (Tucker and Zilinskas 2006, p. 19). Already in 2006 the United States synthetic biology community proposed some measures that can be seen as an addendum of existing guidelines (Maurer et al. 2006):Insist That All Commercial Gene Synthesis Houses Adopt Current Best Practice Screening Procedures.Create and Endorse New Watch-Lists To Improve Industry Screening Programs.Create a Confidential Hotline For Biosafety and Biosecurity Issues.Affirm Members\u2019 Ethical Obligation to Investigate and Report Dangerous Behavior.Create a Community-Wide Clearinghouse for Identifying and Tracking Potential Biosafety/Biosecurity Issues.Endorse Biosecurity/Biosafety Research&Development Priorities.",

In fact some of them are common practice already in a number of countries and laboratories. An important question regarding the possible dual use of synthetic biology is a rather pragmatic one: why take the long and complex way of synthesizing a biological weapon, if in practice there are many more and easier ways to reach the same result? This is confirmed by the American biologist Drew Endy. He estimates the risks for the short and medium term very low. \u201cFrom a security perspective, many people are concerned that it is now possible to directly construct harmful pathogens from DNA sequence information. This seems to me a real but remote possibility, and is likely best addressed by improvements in our capacity to respond to emerging infectious diseases, natural or otherwise, and to our public health systems. The more pressing security concern is to ensure that the tools and policies defining the future of biotechnology do not directly or inadvertently lead to a remilitarization of biology by nations.\u201d (Endy 2010)",

They perceive two main approaches to dual use technology: the Anglo-American pragmatic approach and the continental metaphysical approach (Pustovit and Williams 2008). According to the authors these approaches are based on different understandings of technology: the Anglo-American approach \u201cis associated with technology notion as a sequence of processes and operations aimed to products with necessary and useful for people properties. The second one with enough neutral definition-understanding of technology as use of organized knowledge for aiming at practical goals by systems of machines and people\u201d (Pustovit and Williams 2008, p. 2). In their view the Anglo-American approach is directed at concrete technologies, the continental one also at the role and intentions of people. The authors illustrate the \u2018American\u2019 view by referring to the phrase \u201cdual use research of concern\u201d that has been developed in the\u2014already mentioned\u2014famous Fink-report of the National Research Council of the National Academies (2004), the starting point and analytical fundament of the present biosecurity debate in the United States, and not only there. Dual Use Research of Concern is defined as \u201cresearch that, based on current understanding, can be reasonably anticipated to provide knowledge, products, or technologies that could be directly misapplied by others to pose a threat to public health and safety, agriculture, plants, animals, the environment, or material\u201d (National Research Council of the National Academies 2004). The list of experiments of concern has now an almost official status. Experiments of concern are those that:Demonstrate how to render a vaccine ineffective;Confer resistance to therapeutically useful antibiotics or antiviral agents;Enhance the virulence of a pathogen or render a non-pathogen virulent;Increase the transmissibility of a pathogen;Alter the host range of a pathogen;Enable the invasion of diagnosis and/or detection by established methods;Enable the weaponization of a biological agent or toxin.",

If a pathogen can be changed in such a way that it can survive not only in e.g. animals, but also in human beings, this can lead to new diseases for mankind. Animal diseases become human diseases. And because antibiotics or other remedies for such new diseases do not (yet) exist, the consequences can be disastrous. The risk of the transfer of animal diseases to humans is not imaginary, as is shown by the bird flu and more recently in The Netherlands by the Q-fever that is transmitted to humans by pregnant goats and sheep.",

In other words: an artefact, a technology or a natural product will become \u201cdual use\u201d only by a combination of (technical) properties and intentions.

The Committee was charged \u201cto consider ways to minimize threats from biological warfare and bioterrorism without hindering the progress of biotechnology, which is essential for the health of the nation\u201d (National Research Council of the National Academies 2004, p. vii). Given the professional and scientific background of the Committee members it is fully understandable that they concentrated on the scientific and technical aspects of the problem and not on the political and security aspects. In fact, Miller and Selgelid\u2019s approach also clearly emphasises both consequences and intentions. For example, they explicitly state: \u201cFor something to be an instance of a dual use dilemma both outcomes (the two horns of the dual use dilemma) need to be (actually or potentially) intended\u2026\u201d (Miller and Selgelid 2008, p. 12). So Pustovit and Williams\u2019 presentation of a sharp dichotomy between the views expressed in the literature is somehow misleading.

Furthermore Forge remarks that threats come and go. This means that a technology or an artefact that is labelled as dual use today does not have to be necessarily a dual use issue tomorrow. This is a very relevant remark, because it focuses attention on questions as: is there a threat?; what kind of a threat is it?; who determines if there is a threat?; is this threat serious enough to declare a technology or an artefact as dual use?; etc. Maybe the most important, but often neglected question is: when does a threat, and thus a dual use marking disappear and who is to decide this? Sometimes it seems that since the terrorist attacks and the anthrax letters of 2001 almost irreversible steps have been taken to counter a possible terrorist or\u2014more specific\u2014bioterrorist threat.

This will be done by introducing two translations of the word threat in Dutch: dreiging and bedreiging. They mark a difference that does not exist in the same way in English. Bedreiging is used if an actor is threatening to act in a certain way, e.g. with using violence. Threat as bedreiging looks at a situation from the perspective of the subject making a threat. Dreiging on the other hand focuses at the perspective of the person or group that is or feels threatened. The dreiging perspective of threat does not have to coincide with that of bedreiging. Someone can feel threatened while in fact there is no real threat, because no one has the intention to commit an action against this person. The reverse is also possible: someone does not feel threatened, while in fact a real threat exists, because an actor has the intention to commit a crime or a terrorist action. There are indications that the aspect of dreiging is most influential in the recent debates on biosecurity. Because of that the chance exists that in declaring an activity as dual use an emphasis is laid on the dual use potentiality and that there is an underestimation of the aspect of intentionality (bedreiging).",

These examples are: the Rajneeshee attack with a contaminated salad in Oregon (1984); contamination with anthrax spores by Aum Shinrykio (Japan) and the anthrax letters in the US (2001). The suspicion that Al Qaida might be preparing a bioterrorist attack was found after the occupation of Afghanistan. Three examples in more than 25 years! Of course the seriousness of each of these examples should not be underestimated. But for politicians and for decision makers in the life sciences it should be a serious consideration if these cases really justify the whole range of measures that haven been taken during the past years. Judith Reppy summarizes the developments in life sciences of the past decade with the conclusion that \u201cconcerns about bioterrorism raise the issues of dual-use technology in a field that until recently was not of much interest to the military\u201d (Reppy 2006, p. 7).

            "text": "Securitization is a concept that has been developed in the 1990 s by the Danish political scientist Ole W\u00e6ver. Because of that securitization is seen as a concept of the Copenhagen School of International Relations. This school is closely related to the English School, represented by theorists as Barry Buzan (Buzan 2001). For W\u00e6ver security is a speech act. \u201cIt is by labeling something a security issue that it becomes one\u201d (W\u00e6ver 2004, p. 13). Stating that a particular referent object is threatened in its existence claims a right to extraordinary measures to ensure the referent objects survival. The issue is then moved out of the sphere of normal politics into the realm of emergency politics, where it can be dealt with swiftly and without the normal (democratic) rules and regulations of policy making. For the content of security this means that it has no longer any given meaning but that it can be anything a securitizing actor says it is. Security\u2014understood in this way\u2014is a social construction, with the meaning of security dependent on what is done with it (Taureck 2006). \u201c\u2018Security\u2019 is the move that takes politics beyond the established rules of the game and frames the issue as a special kind of politics or as above politics. Securitization can thus be seen as a more extreme version of politicization. In theory, any public issue can be located on the spectrum ranging from nonpoliticized (\u2026) through politicized (\u2026), to securitized (\u2026). This link between politicization and securitization does not imply that securitization always goes through the state, politicization as well as securitization can be enacted in other for a as well\u201d (Taureck 2006, p. 23\u201324). Securitization studies aim to understand \u201cwho securitizes, on what issues (threats), for whom (referent object), why, with what results, and not least, under what conditions\u201d (Buzan et al. 1998, p. 32). Translated to the dual use issue the main questions are: (a) did a securitization process take place in the life sciences and (b) if so how did it influence the dual use issue?",

First of all: the anthrax attack was the result of the actions of one deranged researcher who was working in a Defence laboratory. He had no link with any terrorist or radicalized (Muslim) organization. This makes his deeds no less repugnant, but this fact should have influenced the threat analysis. Of course it has taken some years before this conclusion could be drawn definitively, but from the beginning the experts knew that the anthrax spore came from one of the American Defence laboratories. Nevertheless it is a legitimate question to investigate the risks of a comparable threat by terrorist groups. But how credible is it to expect a bioterrorist threat from these groups? Are there really any indications for such an expectation? Of course intelligence services will have to perform their inquiries.

Although there are divergent interpretations of human security, a common denominator is that the concept of security should be broader than national or military security. All proponents agree that the primary goal of human security is the protection of human individuals. This broadening of the concept of security implies that there should not only be attention for prevention of possible threats of intentional spreading diseases.

Globalization also promotes the international contacts between scientists and researchers. Personal exchange, appointments abroad and international conferences have grown exponentially during the past decades. The advantages of this development are obvious. Science and technology flourish because of it. More people from more countries are able to contribute to science. But there is the other side that intentional or unintentional misuse is made of scientific results. In The Netherlands the example of the Pakistani nuclear scientist Dr. Khan is well known.

Can the securitization process be declared and justified. Is it really necessary to mobilise the life sciences community and make them aware, or are we pulled along in a whirlpool of developments that have led to an overexposure of perhaps not or hardly existing biosecurity risks? It is not easy to give a validated answer to this question, if only because there is much confidential information held by intelligence services and other government officials on the occurrence of incidents. Moreover it is hard to prove that or why some incidents have not happened. Comparable discussions took place on the effectiveness of nuclear deterrence during the Cold War: it cannot be proven that nuclear deterrence really has prevented the occurrence of (nuclear) war. But did a nuclear war not occur because of the effectiveness of nuclear deterrence or maybe because there was no real threat?",

When after September 2001 the threat of a terrorist attack moved up the chart of security risks, it was clear from the beginning that government saw a prominent role for itself in reducing that threat. This is understandable because terrorism belongs to the kinds of threats that are directed against the state as such, which is not the case with e.g. airplane crashes. This link with the \u2018core business\u2019 of government led to a revival of the role of the state as the ultimate guardian of security. Shortly after September 11 Francis Fukuyama (one of the prophets of neo-liberalism) wrote very strikingly that it is not the Microsofts of this world that send aircraft carriers (Fukuyama 2001). Therefore a state with its monopoly of violence is necessary! The new security issues made clear that there are domains where public and political responsibilities come first. In the years after 9\u201311 governments took up numerous activities and institutions to reduce terrorist threats. In general these activities were supported by the population, even if it led to measures that could be seen as limitations of individual freedom or privacy. This acceptance can be related to a high level of subjective insecurity. Many people feared new terrorist attacks.",

            "text": "But how does this subjective (feeling of) insecurity (dreiging) relate to the objective level of insecurity that is caused by potential bioterrorism (bedreiging)? Certainly the risk of dying because of a bioterrorist attack is many times smaller than the chance of dying in a traffic accident. But the social shock and distress are much greater. This can be explained by the fact that terrorist attacks hit society as such. If 3,000 people would have been killed after the World Trade Centre had fallen down because of an earthquake, the shock would have been great also, but incomparable with what happened after 9\u201311. The essence of the state and the capability of the state to protect its citizens were at stake! The terrorist attack was seen as an act of war, comparable with the attack on Pearl Harbour in 1941. This view explains the reaction of governments, not only in the United States, but also in many other states. The reactions to 9/11 clearly show that governments are willing to spend more financial and personal means to counter terrorist threats than other security risks, which do not directly affect its core tasks.",

For these kinds of terrorist attacks even a new name has been created, catastrophic terrorism: attacks using weapons of mass destruction or more simple methods to kill thousands of civilians for political pressure, political theatre, or crazed self-expression (Fearon 2003). Although political authorities are aware of the low probability of terrorist attacks they are prepared for the worst: policy is developed that is based on such worst case scenarios.",

            "text": "A third caveat has a more psychological character: a phenomenon that can be identified as anticipated decision regret. Anticipated decision regret is an attitude of people which leads them to take actions that are directed at preventing possible future incidents. If I take this preventive measure now, it will mean that I do not have to blame myself (or get blamed by others) for not having done everything to prevent that incident from happening. This attitude also can be observed in health care. A growing number of preventive screening tests are offered that provide information of the chance of developing some kind of disease. It is often not taken in consideration that the chance of really getting this disease is very small. And it is possible that the measures that are taken to prevent the disease negatively influence lifestyles. The Dutch medical sociologist Tjeerd Tijmstra (2001) gives some\u2014often hilarious\u2014examples of anticipated decision regret: if a mother gets a screening test for her child offered for a disease for which the risk is 1 in 90,000, there is a great willingness to participate. And even if it is explained to people that the chance of having a car accident while driving to the clinic is about as much as that particular risk, still many people decide to go on. Their motivation seems to be: suppose our baby does develop that disease, then we should not forgive ourselves not to have done everything to prevent it. There are signals that this anticipated decision regret has become an attitude in security issues also. But in the field of security governments and other public agencies (such as scientific organizations) are bearers of the attitude more than individual citizens. After 9/11\u2014let it be repeated again\u2014security measures against possible terrorist attacks have been given an enormous priority. It looks as if governments are willing to invest a lot of energy in minimizing the chances of terrorist attacks. They do not want to take the risk that they have not done everything to prevent an assault. This attitude can be based on experience. Officials of the Dutch government were reproached for not having done enough to prevent the murder of film director Theo van Gogh (2004). These reproaches have led to decisions that are directed at minimizing the chance of new attacks. With\u2014in general\u2014societal and political support a good deal of money and a lot of energy are devoted to this topic. It is not farfetched to suppose that this is one of the effects of our common anticipated decision regret.",

That would not be a right assumption. There are reasons to be cautious for the risks of bioterrorism. But one should not stop thinking! Anti terrorist policy should not be carried out on autopilot. Fortunately, many politicians and officials of the Intelligence services are among the first ones to stress that possible acts of Chemical, Biological, Radiological or Nuclear terrorism (CBRN) do almost certainly not imply the use of weapons of mass destruction with thousands of victims, but of less destructive (although of course still very dangerous and harmful) weapons.",

To give a fictitious, but not unrealistic example from the life sciences: why is a student from a Middle East country coming to this European laboratory for his PhD research? The idea that this person just wants to become a good scientist in order to help his country in fighting serious diseases could be set aside by the bias driven view that he or she could be a potential terrorist, so \u201cwe will watch him and prevent him from stealing materials\u201d.",

Measures have to be taken to reduce the risk of dual use research and technology beyond the spheres of awareness. It will be important to go on with this policy on the basis of cooperation between all involved parties: scientists, funding organisations, universities, hospitals, politicians, officials of ministries and of course experts on terrorism and anti-terrorism. Such cooperation does not only take away possible misunderstandings, but it is also an appropriate remedy against possible tunnel visions, that could lead to an overemphasis of biosecurity. Although it is very useful to pay attention to possible developments in an early stage, possible dual use should not get such a high priority that promising developments in e.g. the field of synthetic biology are hampered or that talented researchers from abroad (especially from suspected countries) do not get the chance to participate in research.",

The conclusion of the above cannot be otherwise than that a definition of dual use should encompass more than only the technical or physical properties of a biological agent.
