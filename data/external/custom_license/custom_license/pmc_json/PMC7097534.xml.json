Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are approved for the treatment of SLE and have been shown to reduce the frequency of disease flares (particularly of lupus nephritis), contribute to the maintenance of remission, prolong the onset of disease and reduce the risk of complications.1,2,3,4,5 Beyond their immunomodulatory effects in SLE, these agents have also been shown to protect against thrombotic events,2 improve glucose and lipid profiles, and prevent renal damage,6 apparently resulting in reduced cardiovascular risk, for which SLE is an independent risk factor. Ultimately, an increased rate of survival has been reported in SLE patients taking antimalarial agents.3,4",

To date, antimalarial agents have not been reliably linked to an increased incidence of infections as has been known to occur with use of other immunosuppressive drugs. In this context, and surprisingly, a recent nested case\u2013control study aiming to identify factors predictive of infectious complications7 reported that SLE patients treated with antimalarial agents had a lower risk of major infections (odds ratio [OR] 0.06, 95% CI 0.02\u20130.18), whereas prednisone treatment (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.04\u20131.19) and lung involvement (OR 4.41, 95% CI 1.06\u201318.36) increased this risk. Interestingly, the median dose of prednisone in patients with major infections was 7.5 mg per day, and each 10 mg per day dose increase led to an 11-fold increase in infection risk. Cyclophosphamide exposure and overt lupus nephritis were not associated with enhanced infection risk in this study, probably because an insufficient number of patients was included.",

Notably, glycosylation inhibition might lead to interactions of chloroquine with sugar-modifying enzymes or glycosyltransferases and could account for effects on a number of processes that are sialic-acid dependent, including intracellular as well as extracellular functions (for example, binding to surface receptors).",

Thus, antimalarial agents can interfere with intracellular recognition of nucleic-acid-binding by TLR7 and TLR9, which are harbored in intracellular compartments and block the activation of interferon in SLE.
