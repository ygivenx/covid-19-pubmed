The presence of the SARS coronavirus in gastrointestinal epithelial cells can be visualized by electron microscopy; however, there is no evidence of inflammation in the gut mucosa or submucosa and no, or only slight, villous blunting in patients with SARS-associated diarrhea.35 It is worth noting that the viral load of SARS coronavirus in nasopharyngeal aspirates was significantly higher in patients with diarrhea and in patients who died than in the other SARS patients; nonetheless, diarrhea did not predict death.37",

The anerobic gut microflora metabolizes high-molecular-weight carbohydrates to absorbable short-chain fatty acids. When the gut microflora is altered by antibiotics, high-molecular-weight carbohydrates accumulate in the colon and cause osmotic diarrhea. Bile acids, which escape absorption in the small bowel, are usually deconjugated and dehydroxylated by bacteria. When the bacterial flora is disturbed, unmetabolized dihydroxy bile acids, which are potent secretory agents, lead to development of secretory diarrhea in the colon.49",
