Among them, vinyl sulfones and aziridines [10] displayed a high potency, measured through the second-order rate constant of inhibition (k\n2nd) that is in the range 105\u2013106 M\u22121 min\u22121. Recently, we synthesized a new series of peptidomimetics, based on the 1,4-benzodiazepine (1,4-BDZ) scaffold connected to different warheads, that demonstrated an even better biological activity [11]. Particularly interesting is the vinyl ester 1 that showed high affinity and potency (K\ni = 0.017 \u00b1 0.004 \u03bcM, k\n2nd = 3.57 \u00b1 0.40 \u00d7 106 M\u22121 min\u22121) and resulted two times more potent than the reference compound carboxyoxiran E-64 (K\ni = 0.29 \u00b1 0.09 \u03bcM, k\n2nd = 1.70 \u00b1 0.40 \u00d7 106 M\u22121 min\u22121) [7]. Compound 1 derived from several studies conducted modifying the general structure of typical FP-2 inhibitors, such as the vinyl sulfones, E-64, and the peptidyl aziridines inhibitors. Thus, 1 joins together a lipophilic aryl moiety able to increase the interaction with the enzyme P3 site, a central 1,4-BDZ moiety that limits the conformational freedom of the molecule, and a vinyl warhead able to covalently inhibit the enzyme (Scheme 1). Our structure\u2013activity relationship (SAR) studies clarified that compound 1 represents the optimal structure able to block the enzyme [11\u201313]. Therefore, 1 has been identified as a new lead compound for the possible development of new antimalarial drugs.\n",

Van der Waals and hydrogen bonding radii were set at 4.0 and 3.0 \u00c5, respectively; genetic algorithm parameters were kept at the default value. The complex formed by FP-2 and the highest scored docking solution was submitted to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with the SANDER module of the AMBER9 package [20]. The ff03 and GAFF force fields were applied for the protein and the ligand, respectively. The complex was immersed in a box containing about 1,000 water molecules and the TIP3P model [45] was employed to explicitly represent the solvent. Na+ counterions were added to maintain neutrality of the system. At first, the energy of the water molecules was minimized, keeping the atoms of the enzyme frozen. Then, a minimization of the whole system was performed by setting a convergence criterion on the gradient of 10\u22124 kcal mol\u22121 \u00c5\u22121. Prior to starting the MD simulations, the system was equilibrated for 40 ps at 300 K in isocore conditions (NVT). Subsequently, 10 ns of MD simulations in isothermal-isobaric ensemble were carried out at 300 K with a 2 fs time-step (NPT). In the production runs, the system was performed in periodic boundary conditions. Van der Waals and short-range electrostatic interactions were estimated within a 8 \u00c5 cutoff. SHAKE algorithm was applied to all bonds involving hydrogen atoms. When the geometrical stabilization of the complex was reached, a new minimization of the whole system was performed. On this snapshot was applied the subsequent ONIOM calculations.",
