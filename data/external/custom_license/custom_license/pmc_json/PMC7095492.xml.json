In contrast, vaccination with ADV\u2013GP gave rise to a lower antibody titre, but it was generated more rapidly. To investigate whether immunization with adenoviral vectors alone might protect against Ebola virus infection, alternative immunization schedules in macaques were developed for comparison to the previous DNA/ADV protocol (Fig. 1b, middle and bottom panels compared with top panel).",

One week after the boost, animals were challenged with either a low (13 plaque-forming units (PFUs)) or high (1,500 PFUs) dose of a 1995 isolate of Ebola virus Zaire. These doses were uniformly fatal 6\u201312 days afterwards in saline-injected control animals. In contrast, the ADV\u2013GP/NP immunized monkeys (n = 4) were completely protected, confirmed by viral load (Fig. 2). Analysis of the cell-mediated and humoral immune responses revealed significant increases in the CD8+ T-cell response to Ebola antigens by intracellular cytokine staining for interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, seen before exposure to virus, in contrast to control animals where no response was seen (Fig. 3a). Similarly, antibody titres to the virus were stimulated in vaccinated animals, which minimally increased after the viral challenge (Fig. 3b). No substantial increases were observed in the numbers of Ebola-specific CD4+ T cells at this time (data not shown). Both CD8+ cellular and humoral immune responses therefore were associated with protection.",

To address this possibility, a single immunization was given, and animals were challenged one month afterwards (Fig. 1b, bottom panel). Both at low and high viral challenge doses, animals were completely protected against infection (Fig. 4a). In this case, changes in the intracellular IFN-\u03b3 response in T lymphocytes were not consistently seen (data not shown); however, Ebola-specific T-cell responses were detected with intracellular tumour-necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1. CD8 responses were observed before challenge or were induced soon thereafter in five of eight animals, once again correlating with protection against infection (Fig. 4b, right). In contrast, CD4+ responses, not detectable before inoculation, increased after challenge (Fig. 4b, left). Immunoglobulin-\u03b3 (IgG) antibody titres, readily detected at the time of inoculation, were also associated with protection (Fig. 4c). These data demonstrated that a single ADV\u2013GP/NP injection can accelerate vaccine protection and long-term survival against Ebola in non-human primates (Fig. 4d).",

            "text": "Ebola virus infection is characterized by its rapid onset, high person-to-person transmissibility, and significant mortality rate. The mainstay of treatment has been supportive therapy, and prevention has been dependent on containment using barrier precautions. Effective protection was achieved previously in primates with a heterologous DNA prime and adenoviral boost strategy. The prime\u2013boost immunization relies on the ability of the adenoviral boost to expand the primary T-cell response induced by DNA vaccination. When animals are primed with ADV vectors alone, a robust Ebola-virus-specific cellular and humoral immune response is more rapidly achieved, although the response to a second ADV\u2013GP/NP injection is blunted, probably because of anti-vector immunity. Here, we explored the possibility that this more rapid initial immune response may nonetheless confer protection and outweigh the stronger immune response that requires additional time. A single immunization with an adenoviral vector encoding Ebola virus proteins is sufficient to confer protection against lethal challenge within four weeks, and this response correlates with both cellular and humoral immune responses to the infection.",

In rodent studies with adapted Ebola virus, passive transfer of antibodies9,10 or adoptive transfer of cytotoxic T cells11 showed protection when given before infection. A more sensitive but less quantitative CD4 lympho-proliferative response correlated with protection in the previous DNA/ADV prime\u2013boost study, in which CD8 responses were not measured1. In addition to the antibody response induced by the vaccine in the present study, both CD4 and CD8 responses were observed after the challenge. The fact that CD4 responses were not observed before challenge in either protocol whereas CD8 responses were more consistently seen beforehand suggests that the CD8 response is likely to have an important role in protection in non-human primates, but further analysis will be required to assess the relative importance of the cellular and humoral immune responses in the mechanism of protection.",

Should this vaccine approach prove effective in humans, our finding raises the possibility that ring vaccination could be used to contain outbreaks, similar to smallpox in the past. This result also suggests alternative strategies for vaccination against Ebola or other acute pathogenic diseases. The prime\u2013boost strategy remains more immunologically potent and, if the response is highly durable, may still be useful for preventative vaccines, for example, in hospital workers. In contrast, the single adenoviral vaccine administration may be better used during acute outbreaks. It is also possible that alternative viral vectors, such as those derived from other adenovirus serotypes or from poxvirus vectors, might be used to boost an ADV type 5 vector primary immunization. Alternative ADV serotypes will also help to overcome immunity to natural ADV type 5 infection that could potentially reduce vaccine efficacy in some populations. A one-shot vaccine may be helpful in the control of Ebola virus outbreaks in great ape populations of central Africa13. Analogous single-dose ADV vector immunization could also be used for other emerging and highly lethal infectious pathogens, such as Marburg, Lassa or the SARS coronavirus.",
