However, in recent years, the rate of gram negative bacteria has increased again [5\u20139]. Commonly seen gram positive bacteria are S. aureus, coagulase negative Staphylococcus (CNS), and Streptococcus species; gram negative bacteria include E. coli, Klebsiella species, and P. aeruginosa [10].

However, there is an increase in the frequency of infections due to myelosuppression and immunosuppression caused by the disease itself and current treatments. Studies show that life-threatening infection occurs in 48\u201360% of FEN patients [13]. Seasonal patterns of infection can be observed for some of the viruses that cause the common cold. In temperate regions of the northern hemisphere, the frequency of respiratory infections increases rapidly in autumn, remains fairly high throughout winter, and decreases again in spring. In tropical areas, most colds arise during the rainy season [14, 15]. Based on the presence of seasonal viral infection patterns, this study investigated whether there was a similar seasonal change in FNEs. It was found that there was no difference in frequency of FNEs according to months and seasons. The probable reason why there is no difference according to months and seasons is that the pathogens are largely caused by endogenous flora.",

The proportion of gram negative bacteria was significantly higher (approximately twice as much) than the ratio of gram positive bacteria. Among all pathogens, E. coli was the most common (21.2%). Also, these pathogens did not show any change according to seasons. Therefore, empirical antimicrobial therapy does not require a change according to the seasons. FEN is a medical emergency and empirical treatment should be started as soon as possible. The aim of empirical therapy is to cover the most likely and most virulent pathogens that may rapidly cause life-threatening infections. Therefore, clinicians need to be aware of the current microbiology surveillance data from their own institution, which can vary widely from center to center. This allows for better management of the process with selection of more appropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy.",
