Suspected SARS cases are those that do not completely fulfill the above definition but were considered to be likely cases of SARS on the basis of clinical judgment. If no know history of exposure exists, patients are considered for exclusion if an alternative diagnosis can fully explain the clinical symptoms. Laboratory confirmation of SARS infection was also conducted by one or more of the following assays: reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR); culture from throat wash, urine, stool and nasal swab specimens taken at days 1, 3, and 5; or paired serologic assay from clotted blood taken at day 1 and 21.",

As all staff was required to use protective masks from March 12, 2003, these hospital workers were presumed to have contracted the virus as a result of breakthrough transmission. An infection control nurse explained the purpose and logistics of the study to the study participants, obtained their verbal consent for participation, presented them with a structured questionnaire, and collected the completed questionnaire. SARS case-patients were asked to nominate as controls two colleagues who had been working in the same job position, in the same ward, and in proximity with the case-patient before he became ill. Medical and nursing staff (48 of 72 cases) self-administered the questionnaires while other staff (e.g., healthcare assistants and ward assistants, etc) were interviewed by an infection control nurse. Out of the 72 cases, 57 nominated 114 controls who completed the questionnaire (114/144 = 79.2%); 15 cases did not nominate a control and hence 30 controls were randomly selected from the duty roster of the day before the case felt unwell, matching for job position (30/144 = 20.8%). Questionnaires were collected from 57 (79.2%) nominated controls. Nominated controls who did not return the questionnaire were replaced by controls randomly selected from the duty roster of the day before the case felt unwell, matching for job position (15/72 = 20.8%). Of the 144 controls completing the questionnaire, one was invalidated because she later became a suspected case. Controls showed neither influenzalike symptoms nor SARS-related symptoms during the study and had not been identified as a suspected SARS case as of August 15, 2003. No blood test was conducted to determine whether these persons were asymptomatic SARS cases. Another study that tested 674 healthcare workers who were working in the same hospital cluster found no asymptomatic or subclinical SARS. It can thereby be assumed that the control group had not contracted the virus (5).",

All workers were required to wear protective masks from March 12, 2003. Using protective masks alone is, therefore, not sufficient to eliminate SARS transmission among hospital workers. Cases were less likely to have had direct contact with a SARS patient than controls, suggesting that direct physical contact with SARS patients was not necessary for breakthrough transmission to occur. It also suggests that modes of transmission other than droplets cannot be excluded. Consistent hand hygiene after contact with patients was almost universal and was not a significant factor predicting SARS transmission in our study, although hand hygiene appeared to be a risk factor in situations when there was no patient contact.",

Personal protection equipment should be used consistently in all 3 settings. The high degree of collinearity in the use of the various types of personal protection equipment makes it difficult to ascertain which type of personal protection equipment is most important as a SARS countermeasure. Nevertheless, policy makers should be made aware that the supply of different types of personal protection equipment had often been seen as inadequate, and it is one of the very significant risk factors identified. The perception of inadequate supply was not verified by this study. These perceptions may reflect the actual situation or may be an inaccurate impression of the hospital workers. Caution is advised in interpreting these results. Nevertheless, at the time of the study, the media had reported frequent complaints about personal protection equipment supply shortages from hospital workers. The perception of inadequate personal protection equipment is likely to be associated with the personal protection equipment supply situation. Given the large differences in our results (OR > 5.0, p < 0.001), it is likely that personal protection equipment shortages were at least partially responsible for many of the SARS infections. As inadequate knowledge of SARS infection control (\u201cdid not understand procedures\u201d) is also a strong risk factor for breakthrough transmission, SARS infection control training must not be overlooked. In-depth, thorough training (>2 hrs) is required.",

The content of these training sessions included basic knowledge of SARS and its clinical presentation, route of transmission, types and proper use of different personal protective equipment for different risk levels, the procedures for handling high risk specimens, environmental disinfection protocols, and commonly observed problems. The content of the training was regularly revised with updated information. Regular updates and attendance of the training sessions were strongly recommended. The unit supervisors were given more intensive training to train their staff. The findings of this study underscore the importance of in-depth training in SARS prevention among hospital workers.",

However, the recall period was usually within 1 week as all the cases were interviewed while they were hospitalized. Hand hygiene data were self-reported and not audited. Nevertheless, since respondents were required to report the frequency of hand washing from a categorical response format rather than an open ended question, the responses should be reliable. Another possible bias may be the case group\u2019s attributing their infection to external factors (e.g., inadequate supplies) and the control group\u2019s doing the opposite. Given that the odds ratios obtained were strongly significant and consistent with one another, it is unlikely that this form of bias could account for all of the observed differences.
