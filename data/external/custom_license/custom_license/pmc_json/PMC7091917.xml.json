            "text": "To date, various strategies including viral and nonviral vectors have been developed for gene transfer. Among the viral vectors, adenovirus (Ad) vectors deliver genes to a wide variety of cell types and tissue independently of their proliferative state (reviewed in Ref. 1). These vectors have been modified by introducing deletions in the early genes to increase cloning capacity and reduce cellular toxicity.2 However, these modifications have not lead to a prolonged transgene expression in rodents and nonhuman primates, indicating that residual low level expression of Ad genes is responsible, at least in part, for the short-term persistence. The \u2018gutless\u2019 or helper-dependent adenovirus vector (HD) allowed transgene expression to persist for almost the entire lifetime of mouse as shown in liver, brain and muscle.345 These vectors lack all viral coding sequences and are produced by the co-infection of a suitable cell line with an Ad helper virus, which provides in trans the proteins required for replication and packaging.67 In light of the extensive cloning capacity (35 kb) and the persistence of expression in many cell types, HD vectors are ideal vectors for studying gene functions in the absence of interfering viral promoters, undesired expression of potentially toxic Ad genes, and reduced immune response against Ad proteins.",

            "text": "To achieve safe and effective protein expression, pharmacological control over the level of gene transcription is required. Placing gene activity under control from outside via an effector molecule allows the activity to be limited within a \u2018desired window\u2019. Thus expression can be adjusted according to the evolution of induced biological effects, and treatment to be terminated by drug withdrawal. Different systems based on small-molecule control of transcription have been developed and proven to be effective in mice. The rapamycin-regulated system (RRS) uses a \u2018dimerizer\u2019 drug to bring together the functional units of a bipartite transcriptional factor.8 A different chimeric system is based on the progesteron antagonist, RU486. An HD vector expressing human growth hormone (hGH) under control of the RU486-inducible system was very effective both in controlling hGH expression and in inducing a biological response for a limited period of time.9 The Tet systems, widely applied both in vitro and in vivo, have been derived from elements of the tetracycline (Tc) resistance operon of Escherichia coli which were converted into eukaryotic transcription activation systems.10 In one version a Tet-controlled transactivator (tTA), a fusion between the Tet repressor protein (TetR) and a eukaryotic transcription activation domain, binds to tet operator sequences fused to a minimal promoter and activates transcription in the absence of Tc.11 Addition of Tc, or one of its derivative such as doxycycline (Dox), abolishes transcription. In a second version, a mutated form of tTA, rtTA, binds and activates transcription only in the presence of Dox.12 Both Tet systems were used in gene therapy models whereby a variety of vectors were applied: retroviruses, adeno-associated virus (AAV) binary systems, first generation adenoviruses, and electroporated DNA.8131415 Despite numerous successful applications, the Tet regulatory systems originally described show some limitations. rtTA exhibits some residual affinity to tetO in the absence of Dox and requires relatively high levels of Dox to achieve full activation. In addition, rtTA and possibly its mRNA are rather susceptible to degradation, at least in certain cell types. These limitations were overcome by novel rtTA versions, which were identified via mutagenesis and genetic selection in yeast. The new transactivator species such as rtTAs-S2, which were subsequently embedded in synthetic sequences designed to optimize expression in mammals, showed drastic improvements in all parameters mentioned above.16",

Liver protection was dependent only on activation of mIFN\u03b1 expression induced by Dox treatment. Secretion of the cytokine was repeatedly re-induced to the same high level for a period of 3 months, and controlled by the amount of Dox delivered. In addition, C57/B6 mice injected at low HD-TET-IFN doses resulted in Dox-mediated regulation of liver restricted mIFN\u03b1 expression, which was associated with induction of antiviral genes.

These results are in line with observations in transgenic mice where a 10-fold reduction in the amount of Dox added in the drinking water resulted in 100-fold lower amount of luciferase detected in the liver.22 To further characterize the kinetics of expression induced by a single oral dose of Dox, C57/B6 mice were injected with 4 \u00d7 1010 pp and serum mIFN\u03b1 measured over time (Figure 5). At a dose of 20 mg/kg of Dox, rapid induction of mIFN\u03b1 expression was observed as early as 6 h after induction. Maximal expression was observed between 6 and 24 h with mIFN\u03b1 values ranging from 200 to 1000 U/ml. Serum mIFN\u03b1 levels returned to background within 48 h. The rapid kinetic of expression did not allow the precise measurement of the peak value for each mouse and may explain, at least in part, the five-fold variation in maximal mIFN\u03b1 expression. At 200 mg/kg of Dox, higher levels were observed, indicating that maximal induction may not be achieved with a single dose of 20 mg/kg of Dox (data not shown).",

C57/B6 and Balb/C mice were i.v. injected with different doses of HD-TET-IFN and mIFN\u03b1 measured at day 21 p.i. after a treatment for 3 days with Dox, 200 \u03bcg/ml, present in the drinking water (Figure 7a). In C57/B6 mice injected with low vector doses (1.4 \u00d7 109 pp and 2.8 \u00d7 109 pp) and not treated with Dox, mIFN\u03b1 was detected neither in the liver, nor in the serum. However, liver-restricted mIFN\u03b1 in the range of 60\u2013120 U/g was observed upon induction depending on the vector dose. Higher HD-TET-IFN dose (4.4 \u00d7 1010 pp), in the absence of Dox treatment, resulted in 100 U/g of mIFN\u03b1 present in the liver, but not in the serum. After Dox treatment mIFN\u03b1 levels increased 100-fold in the liver and 1000-fold in the serum. These levels returned to background upon Dox withdrawal 3 days later (data not shown). In Balb/C mice, where Ad is less persistent,25 liver-restricted mIFN\u03b1 was induced only at a virus dose of 4.4 \u00d7 1010 pp, whereas at lower vector doses the cytokine was undetectable. The HD-TET-IFN doses that resulted in liver-restricted mIFN\u03b1 expression were further analyzed for the induction of mIFN\u03b1 responsive genes Figure 7b. In agreement with the presence of mIFN\u03b1 protein, Northern blot analysis showed a clear signal for the mIFN\u03b1 mRNA in both C57/B6 and Balb/C only in Dox-treated mice (lane A). As a consequence of mIFN\u03b1 expression, 2\u20195\u2019OAS and TGTP transcripts were elevated, as indicated by the RNase protection assay (lanes C and D). A 7.6- and three-fold induction of 2\u20195\u2019OAS signal was observed at the highest HD-TET-IFN dose indicated in Balb/C and C57/B6, respectively. When compared with 2\u20195\u2019OAS, the induction of TGTP over the background was less pronounced. To examine the reversal of induction of antiviral gene activities, 2\u20195\u2019OAS and TGTP transcripts were examined 3 days after Dox withdrawal. At this time point, in C57/B6 mice injected with 2.8 \u00d7 109 pp previously induced with Dox, mRNA synthesis from antiviral genes had returned to basal level. To evaluate the cell types which express mIFN\u03b1 upon Dox treatment, immunohistochemistry with an antibody against mIFN\u03b1 was performed in the liver of C57/B6 Figure 7c. Positive hepatocytes were observed in the proximity of vessel only upon Dox induction. Lastly, inflammation was evaluated by RNase protection assay for mRNA of infiltrating lymphocytes, eg CD4, CD8, CD3\u025b and macrophages. These markers were not elevated in HD-TET-IFN-injected mice independently of the Dox treatment (data not shown).",

The rapid adjustment of the activity of a therapeutic gene to the progression of the diseases is of particular importance. The HD-TET-IFN vector meets several of these requirements. Injecting large doses (1.4 \u00d7 1010 pp) in C57/B6 mice resulted in undetectable serum levels of mIFN\u03b1 in the absence of Dox Figure 3. Upon induction with Dox, mIFN\u03b1 was detected in the serum and its expression correlated with the amount of Dox delivered to the animal Figure 4. High levels of secreted mIFN\u03b1 were observed at the largest dose of Dox, with only slight variations over a period of 3 months. Although the rapid induction of secreted cytokines has already been widely reported, the rapid reversal of mIFN\u03b1 induction represents a major improvement over the previously described systems. The rapamycin system, which was explored in the context of Ad or AAV vectors, demonstrated rapid induction of hGH and controlled expression over a wide range of doses.27 However, hGH remained above the basal levels for up to 12 days after a single injection of the inducer. Similar slow de-induction kinetics were observed in the brains of rats using the Tet-off system delivered by a first generation Ad vector.8 Improved reversal of induction was reported,9 with the RU486 regulation system carried on a HD vector and driven by the same TTR promoter used in this study. Interestingly, Burcin et al9 observed a similarly inefficient induction of their reporter gene at an early stage after HD injection, as did our system. Further experiments are required to understand why 2 weeks appear to be required to reach steady state expression. Since full induction of Tet-controlled genes is achieved within less than 8 h in the liver of transgenic mice,28 other factors such as the immuno-response against Ad particles may have a detrimental effect on transcription at this early stage. One limitation of the actual rtTA2s-S2 based system is its poor sensitivity to Dox, which in our experimental conditions was not saturated using 20 mg/kg Figure 5. However, in parallel with rtTA2s-S2, the rtTA2s-M2 transactivator was developed, which shows a 10-fold higher sensitivity to Dox in HeLa cells. It will be interesting to explore this additional transactivator in the context of HD vectors, which may bring the Dox required within the dose range of human antibiotic therapy.",

Previously we showed that lower levels of serum mIFN\u03b1 were associated with partial hepatic protection, but had no effects on survival rate.18 In this study, all mice treated with Dox showed liver protection and one out of six survived the MHV-3 infection Figure 6b. The higher level of circulating mIFN\u03b1 may have elicited stronger local and peripheral effects such as induction of antiviral genes or peritoneal macrophage activation, which may have limited MHV-3 replication in a more efficient manner. Although we showed that injection of HD-TET-IFN resulted in Dox-dependent hepatic protection, the impact of this gene therapy approach on chronic hepatitis remains to be established, as no mouse model for this disease exists, unlike HBV (woodchuck model) or HCV infection (non-human primates, such as chimpanzees). However, the pharmacological control of IFN\u03b1 expression is also required in the context of these animal models in light of safety concerns such as toxicity, side-effects and adjusting the IFN\u03b1 level as a function of disease progression.",

            "text": "Recombinant IFN\u03b1 is widely used in the treatment of human hepatitis B and C. However, systemic injection is associated with side-effects, particularly on the neuronal system, which cause the withdrawal of a significant number of patients from the therapy. Therefore, it was of interest to evaluate the possibility of limiting the biological response induced by IFN\u03b1 expression to the liver as a function of the Dox treatment and the vector dosage. In a previous study, we observed that in mice injected with the HD-IFN, which express mIFN\u03b1 directly under the constitutive TTR promoter, liver-restricted mIFN\u03b1 expression, as well as the induction of antiviral genes last for 10 months (data not shown). This observation is in agreement with recent reports where gene transfer mediated by HD vectors resulted in long persistence of transgene expression.3521 This long period of IFN\u03b1 expression could, nonetheless, be considered \u2018over-therapeutic\u2019 in light of the current treatment for HCV, which lasts for 6 months. Using the HD-TET-IFN vector, however, allows a controlled timing and potency of expression on the basis of Dox treatment even at low vector doses. Indeed, low doses of HD-TET-IFN resulted in mIFN\u03b1 being detectable in the liver and not in the bloodstream only upon Dox induction Figure 7a. As a consequence of liver-restricted mIFN\u03b1 expression, antiviral genes were induced Figure 7b in the absence of liver damage or inflammation response. Also in the liver, the reversal of mIFN\u03b1 induction was fairly rapid, as indicated by the reduction of antiviral gene mRNAs 3 days after Dox withdrawal. Lastly, the expression of mIFN\u03b1 was highlighted in the hepatocyte cells upon Dox treatment Figure 7c. As expected on the basis of previous experiments with marker genes, Dox-dependent mIFN\u03b1 expression distributed in hepatocytes, which are in the proximity of the vessel.",

While germline transgenesis can generate useful animal models for genetic studies, it can be costly and time-consuming. Additionally, it requires the use of a large number of animals and can be limited by toxicity during embryogenesis.
