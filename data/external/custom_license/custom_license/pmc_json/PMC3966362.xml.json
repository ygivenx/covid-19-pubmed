We generated phylogenetic trees based on ORF2 or the entire genome. These trees showed that although strains from the United States were closely related to strains from the Netherlands, they formed a new and distinct cluster (Figure). We observed similar phylogenetic clustering when we analyzed nucleotide sequences of ORF1 and ORF3 separately. Although we cannot conclude whether ferret HEV from the United States is a new genotype, these results indicated that there is genetic variety in ferret HEV.
