It is one of the primary causative agents of infectious respiratory diseases such as swine pneumonia and atrophic rhinitis [1]. In addition, B. bronchiseptica is often isolated in combination with other pathogens from swine suffering from pneumonia. Previous studies have shown that co-infection of viral and bacterial pathogens, including porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, porcine respiratory coronavirus, Haemophilus parasuis, Pasteurella multocida, and Streptococcus suis, exacerbates the severity of respiratory disease in pigs [2]. Importantly, human B. bronchiseptica infections have also been reported [3, 4].",

BvgAS is a two-component signal transduction system that regulates the expression of multiple virulence factors in response to changes in environmental conditions. Different virulence factors are expressed in the three different B. bronchiseptica phases: the bvg+, bvgi, and bvg\u2212 phases. In the virulent bvg+ phase, which occurs at 37 \u00b0C in the absence of MgSO4 and nicotinic acid, B. bronchiseptica can rapidly colonize the respiratory tract of its host through the expression of adhesins, autotransporters, and toxins. The avirulent bvg\u2212 phase occurs at growth temperatures of ~25 \u00b0C or in the presence of MgSO4 or nicotinic acid. Finally, the intermediate (bvgi) phase is responsible for biofilm formation by B. bronchiseptica [5, 6].",

To combat multidrug-resistant bacteria, phages offer a potential alternative to antibiotics. In the past, temperate B. bronchiseptica phages have been induced in clinical bacterial strains, but their phenotypic characteristics have rarely been described. Petrovic et al [8]. isolated 29 lytic B. bronchiseptica phages from the environment and described their phenotypic characteristics; however, the genomes of these phages were only partially sequenced to determine whether they were lytic or temperate phages. Here, we isolated a novel lytic phage from wastewater collected from a swine farm in China and studied its phenotypic and genetic characteristics. To our knowledge, the complete genomes of only three temperate B. bronchiseptica phages have been sequenced [9].",

Single colonies were cultured with TSB supplemented with 10% (v/v) sterile, defibrinated sheep blood at 37 \u00b0C for 24 h and examined for phage vB_BbrM_PHB04 sensitivity by spot testing, applying 10 \u03bcl (107 pfu/ml) phage to visualize individual plaques. Genomic DNA was extracted from each of the bacteria resistance to phage using a commercial extraction kit (Roche, Switzerland). The PCR primers used in this study are described in Table S1. Primers were tested for specificity using the phage vB_BbrM_PHB04 genome as a positive control. This experiment was repeated three times.",
