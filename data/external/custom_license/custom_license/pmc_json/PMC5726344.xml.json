Traditional in vivo toxicity testing relies on the use of a single strain of rodent (typically an inbred or hybrid strain), with multiple identical animals being used at each time point or in each dose group; thus, extrapolation from these data to a diverse human population is difficult and necessitates the use of default assumptions. In the past decade, the utility of a mouse population-based approaches to in vivo toxicity testing has been demonstrated for a number of toxic agents and the appreciation of genetics as an important dimension in science and practice of investigative pharmacology and toxicology is increasing (Rusyn et al. 2010). Importantly, genetically heterogeneous mouse models have been combined with the limited data for interindividual differences in chemical toxicity from human studies to characterize the extent of the variability (Chiu et al. 2014), discover genetic determinants (Harrill et al. 2009), and understand the molecular underpinnings of toxicity (French et al. 2015).",

PERC is a chlorinated olefin solvent with a variety of industrial applications, a ubiquitous contaminant of groundwater, soil, ambient and urban air, and is one of the most common pollutants present in many hazardous waste sites (National Research Council 2009a). The most well-known application of PERC is in dry-cleaning. Of the approximately 32,000 dry cleaners in the United States operating as of 2006, about 28,000 (\u223c88%) were using PERC as a solvent (Goehl and O'Neil 2005). Not only are workers exposed to PERC via dry-cleaning, but consumers are also potentially exposed via \u201coff-gassing\u201d of PERC from treated clothing (Sherlach et al. 2011). PERC is therefore of great concern to public health protection agencies, including the U.S Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). PERC has been classified by IARC (2013) and the U.S. EPA (2011b) as a possible human carcinogen, mainly based on evidence for carcinogenesis from chronic studies in rodents (National Toxicology Program 1986).",

Although there have been previous attempts at characterizing toxicokinetic variability of PERC (Bois et al. 1996; Covington et al. 2007; Gelman et al. 1996). Chiu and Ginsberg (2011) found that all these efforts were hampered by inadequate experimental data, leading to substantial uncertainty in the ultimate risk assessments. Moreover, variability exists in both toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics, and may be a consequence of multiple factors, including genetics. Therefore, the contribution of such factors to population level variability in both toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic responses to PERC deserves further attention.",

All dosing solutions were prepared fresh daily (and used within 1.5 hr of preparation) in amber glass vials with foil-lined septa to minimize adsorption of PERC to the container walls and/or septum. For PERC-treated animals, the time points for tissue collection were 1, 2, 4, 12, and 24 hr postgavage (n=1/strain/time point); vehicle-treated mice were euthanized only at the 24-hr time point (n=1/strain). Prior to necropsy, animals were weighed and were deeply anesthetized by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of Euthasol\u2122 (3mL/kg; Med-Vet International, Mettawa, IL) and euthanasia was performed via exsanguination through the vena cava. Serum was prepared by centrifugation using Z-gel tubes (Starstedt; Numbrecht, Germany). All other tissues were removed, rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, and weighed. The left lobe of the liver was separated from the other lobes after weighing. The kidneys, lungs, brain, and epididymal fat pads were collected and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. For animals in the 24-hr group, small sections of left and median liver lobes and kidney were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5\u03bcm, and stained with hematoxylin & eosin (H&E).",

One study reported that PERC induces PPAR\u03b1 after acute and subacute (less than 14 days) exposure, but not after 30 days of exposure (Philip et al. 2007); however, the overall database on the role of PPAR\u03b1 in the effects of PERC is limited. Thus, we examined transcript levels for two PPAR\u03b1 target genes, Cyp4a10 and Acox1, in liver tissue 24 hr following exposure (Figure 8). In vehicle-treated mice, levels of individual transcripts were fairly consistent among strains. Almost every strain exhibited induction of both transcripts upon PERC exposure; however, the extent of induction was highly variable for both Acox1 (GM=1.99-fold; GSD=1.45) and Cyp4a10 (GM=5.02-fold; GSD=1.64). At the population level, statistically significant induction of both transcripts was observed.",

However, at the population level, no correlation was observed between liver PERC or TCA AUC and induction of these genes. Importantly, liver triglyceride level and liver PERC and TCA AUCs were clustered together, suggesting that either parent chemical or metabolite may be responsible for the observed dysregulation of hepatic lipids. Coincident with this finding was the observation of a negative, albeit weak, correlation between serum triglycerides and PERC and TCA AUCs in the liver. When all toxicodynamic phenotypes were parameterized for strain-to-strain correlations, we observed several clustered subpopulations, as displayed in the heatmap (Figure 6C); however, overall there was no obvious clustering of strains based on hepatic TCA levels.",

PERC is an ideal case-study chemical as its metabolism is proposed to play a critical role in its mode of toxicity. Therefore, it was hypothesized that individuals with an increased capacity to oxidize PERC to the hepatotoxic metabolite TCA would be at an increased risk for acute hepatotoxicity following a single exposure of PERC (Guyton et al. 2014). Moreover, TCA is a widely accepted principal marker of oxidative metabolism of PERC, which is implicated in the hepatocarcinogenic effects of PERC in mice and used as the basis for extrapolating cancer risk from mice to humans (U.S. EPA 2011b).",

In the current study, levels of PERC and TCA were measured in a large number of target and nontarget tissues, including liver, kidney, serum, brain, lung, and fat across a much larger panel of inbred strains of the CC. We found that serum TCA AUCs were highly correlated with those in fat, lung, and brain, but were uncorrelated to those in liver and kidney. Thus, for PERC, sampling serum TCA levels may not be predictive of hepatic TCA levels. These data do suggest, however, that analysis of both liver and serum may provide sufficient toxicokinetic data to model systemic TCA exposure.",

Specifically, data-derived estimates for toxicokinetic variability could conceivably be made by incorporating the current population-level data into a population PERC PBPK model. Because of the single high dose level in this study, such a PBPK model would likely to be incorporate previously collected data (Chiu and Ginsberg 2011) in a Bayesian manner.

However, for TCE, metabolism to TCA is proposed to occur mainly through CYP2E1 (Kim and Ghanayem 2006; Lash et al. 2014; Ramdhan et al. 2008), although other enzymes are likely involved (Lash et al. 2014). In this study, we measured hepatic levels of CYP2E1 in vehicle- and PERC-treated mice 24 hr after dosing. Hepatic protein levels of CYP2E1 in vehicle-treated mice were variable across strains, and overall there was no effect of PERC treatment on modulation of hepatic CYP2E1 levels. Similarly, Philip et al. (2007) reported no effect of PERC treatment on hepatic CYP2E1 levels. When hepatic CYP2E1 levels in vehicle-treated mice were correlated by strain to hepatic TCA AUCs, there was no correlation at the population level (Spearman\u2019s rho=\u22120.01), suggesting that CYP2E1 may not be a major contributor to PERC metabolism to TCA. Indeed, in human lymphoblastoma-derived MCL-5 cells transfected with various human CYPs (hCYP), hCYP2B6 (and, to a lesser extent, hCYP2C8 and hCYP1A2) was able to catalyze the reaction of PERC to acetylated neoantigens, which were recognized by immunoreactivity to anti-trifluoroacetylated antibodies (White et al. 2001). In isolated male F344 rat hepatocytes, incubation with PERC in the presence of CYP inhibitors had little effect on cytotoxicity as assessed by LDH leakage into the cell medium (Lash et al. 2007). In the same study, isolated hepatocytes from rats pretreated with the CYP2E1 inducer pyridine did not increase cytotoxicity of PERC, but did increase the cytotoxicity of TCE. However, it has been shown that pretreatment of male B6C3F1 mice with the suicide CYP2E1 inhibitor carbon tetrachloride did decrease TCA levels after PERC exposure (Fisher et al. 2004). These historic data in conjunction with the current study highlight the complexity of PERC metabolism as a consequence of interspecies and interindividual variability and warrant further mechanistic investigation into the enzymes involved in PERC metabolism.",

Hepatic lipid accumulation was observed histopathologically in about 33% of all PERC-treated mice 24 hr after dosing, and there was a statistically significant increase in liver triglyceride levels in PERC-exposed animals relative to vehicle-treated controls. Coincident with this finding, there was a decrease in serum triglycerides, and an induction of the PPAR\u03b1-responsive genes Cyp4a10 and Acox1 in the liver, suggesting that PERC exposure results in dysregulation of liver lipid metabolism and that this phenotype is largely independent of genetic background. Lipid accumulation in the liver has been observed following a single dose of 1,000mg/kg PERC in mice (Philip et al. 2007) and also following 6 weeks of oral administration of 100\u20132,000mg/kg/day in corn oil to Male Swiss-Cox (outbred) mice (Buben and O'Flaherty 1985).",

Although there was a significant effect of PERC exposure on a number of toxicodynamic phenotypes, not a single one was correlated with hepatic TCA levels. This demonstrates a complex and highly variable relationship between PERC and TCA toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics at the population level, specifically that correlation between metabolism and toxicity of PERC is not to be presumed.",

Using unsupervised hierarchical clustering, there was a cluster formed among PERC and TCA AUCs and liver triglyceride accumulation. However, all of the correlation coefficients between any two of these individual parameters suggest only a weak correlation. It was previously reported that neither administered PERC dose nor total urinary PERC metabolite levels were correlated with liver triglyceride accumulation in mice (Buben and O'Flaherty 1985). Nonetheless, at the population level, there appears to be some relationship among PERC, TCA, and hepatic triglyceride accumulation. Thus, we posit that interindividual differences in PERC metabolism may be only partially responsible for the variability in the toxicity of this compound, and that additional research is needed to determine whether genetic modifiers may account for these differences.",

Future studies examining the sub-chronic or chronic effects, and exposures to lower doses of PERC are warranted. This may be particularly true for PERC, which displays saturable enzyme kinetics at high exposure concentrations in male Sprague-Dawley rats (Pegg et al. 1979; Schumann et al. 1980) and male B6C3F1 (Schumann et al. 1980), outbred Swiss-Cox (Buben and O'Flaherty 1985) and Swiss-Webster mice (Philip et al. 2007). This study probed interindividual variation in metabolic \u201ccapacity\u201d (i.e., related to Vmax) and is less informative to variation in \u201caffinity\u201d (i.e., related to KM). Because metabolism is proportional to Vmax/KM at lower exposure, this study still likely addresses a portion of the overall variability, but is less sensitive to additional variability at low doses due to interindividual differences in KM among CC mice. The high dose level also limits interpretation of the lack of correlation between metabolism and CYP2E1, because a stronger correlation may exist at lower exposure levels.",

Specifically, this is the first study to use CC mice to perform parallel and tissue-specific toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic phenotyping at the population level. Using this approach, the variability in toxicokinetics of PERC in multiple tissues across a population was quantified. Utilizing an inbred mouse population model permits genetically identical individuals to be tested at multiple time points, with different doses, and with different chemicals, thereby increasing statistical power and confidence and allowing chemical-to-chemical comparisons. Even though such a study design does not yield toxicity phenotypes that are more traditionally used for human health assessments, it serves as a prerequisite step to subsequent sub-chronic and chronic studies. By assaying a large number of genetically diverse but genetically defined individuals through an acute study design one can select a smaller set of strains that are representative of the diversity in toxicokinetics for the follow up studies. For instance, subpopulations of strains based on a particular phenotype (e.g., hepatic TCA levels) can be selected for a 90-day study where the use of a large number of strains would be challenging because of ethical and financial considerations.",

These data will be useful for updating the current PBPK model for PERC (Chiu and Ginsberg 2011) to a population-based model and will likely be of use in future risk management decisions for PERC. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of toxicodynamic phenotypes highlighted the complexity of the relationship between toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics of tetrachloroethylene at the population level and suggested a potential relationship between hepatic PERC and TCA levels and liver triglyceride accumulation. Our hypothesis that individuals with increased hepatic TCA levels would be more susceptible to PERC-associated hepatotoxicity was largely unsupported, suggesting that TCA is not the only active toxicant and/or that other genetic determinants contribute to interindividual susceptibility to PERC-associated hepatotoxicity.",
