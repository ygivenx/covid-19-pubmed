            "text": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes serious liver diseases including chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV infection is manifested mainly in human liver hepatocytes [1] and hematopoietic cells [18]. Such strict tropism of HCV infection depends on two major factors: the ability of HCV to enter a target cell and the permissibility of HCV replication inside the cell. Target cell accessibility is mediated by HCV receptors and co-receptors, which have been identified using HCV cell culture systems with CD81, scavenger receptor class B, member 1 (SR-BI), low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), claudin-1 (CLDN1), and occludin (OCLN) [7, 22]. Although CD81 and OCLN are essential determinants of tropism of HCV infection in humans [19], these cellular proteins are ubiquitously expressed in human tissues and are not responsible for the hepatotropism of HCV infection. One liver-specific molecule that may influence the accessibility of cells to pathogens is C-type lectin domain family 4, member M (CLEC4M; also known as L-SIGN or DC-SIGNR). CLEC4M is highly expressed on liver sinusoidal endothelial cells but not on hepatocytes and dendritic cells. [5]. Soilleux and colleagues identified the cDNA sequence of CLEC4M as a gene related to that of dendritic-cell-specific ICAM-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) [4]. The C-terminal end of CLEC4M possesses a carbohydrate-recognition domain and binds to mannose oligosaccharides that are present on the envelopes of pathogens [13]. CLEC4M acts as a capture receptor for viruses and pathogens, including human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) [5], Ebola virus [3], severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [8] and M tuberculosis [14]. CLEC4M was previously reported to mediate transinfection of HCVpp (pseudoparticle) using CLEC4M-positive cells [9, 10, 15, 16]; CLEC4M captured artificial HCVpp and transmitted it to hepatocytes. It is, however, unknown whether CLEC4M acts as a receptor for HCVcc (cell-culture-produced HCV) transinfection and whether CLEC4M is a binding receptor or an entry receptor for HCVcc. Once cells that are competent for HCV RNA replication have an entry receptor for HCVcc, they are susceptible to HCVcc infection, but cells that have only a binding receptor are unsusceptible. In the present study, we used CD81-negative and HCV-replication-permissive cells (Huh7-25) to investigate whether CLEC4M plays a role as a liver-specific HCV receptor for cisinfection and/or a receptor for transinfection.",

            "text": "To investigate the potential receptor role of CLEC4M in HCV infection, we produced CLEC4M-positive cells using a CD81-negative Huh7 cell clone (Huh7-25). The Huh7-25 cell clone is highly permissive for HCV replication, but it is not susceptible to JFH-1 HCV infection because the Huh7-25 cell clone is negative for CD81 [2]. However, except for CD81, the expression level of HCV receptor genes in the Huh7-25 cell clone was similar to that of JFH-1 HCV permissive cells (Huh7-25-CD81 and Huh7-it) (Supplementary Fig. 2). Since Huh7-25 was also negative for CLEC4M mRNA, we established CLEC4M-positive cells using Huh7-25 (Huh7-25-CLEC4M). Huh7-25-CLEC4M cells produced high levels of CLEC4M mRNA and protein (Fig. 1A-C). Western blot analysis of the CLEC4M protein showed multiple bands of different sizes at >43 kDa in both Huh7-25-CLEC4M cells and human liver. These were converted to a single band of 43 kDa after treatment with N-glycanase (Fig. 1D). Thus, the glycosylation pattern of CLEC4M was different in Huh7-25-CLEC4M cells and human liver. Huh7-25-CLEC4M was similar to not only the negative control cell clone (Huh7-25-NC) but also to Huh7-25-CD81 cells, which were established by transfecting Huh7-25 cells with CD81, transforming them into HCV-susceptible cells [2] (Fig. 1E). Thus, the Huh7-25-CLEC4M cell clone was useful for determining whether CLEC4M is an entry receptor for HCVcc that can take the place of CD81.\n",

DC-SIGN, which is analogous to the CLEC4M protein, functions as an endocytotic receptor and has internalization motifs, such as a tri-acidic cluster, a dileucine motif and a tyrosine-based motif in the intracellular N-terminal domain [13]. The tri-acidic cluster and dileucine motif are present in the N-terminal region of CLEC4M, but the tyrosine-based motif is absent [13]. However, CLEC4M-positive Jurkat cells were susceptible to Ebola virus cisinfection [3]. CLEC4M-positive CHO cells captured SARS-CoV and incorporated, it leading to proteasome-dependent viral degradation [8]. CLEC4M-positive K562 and THP-1 cells internalized HCV virus-like particles consisting of recombinant envelope proteins E1 and E2, which differ from HCVpp [17]. Thus, the internalization by CLEC4M-positive cells is dependent on the type of cell and ligands. The early stage of infection such as attachment and entry of HCV requires particular cooperation of multiple receptors including coreceptors. Such an interaction between CLEC4M and other active receptors for HCV might be deficient in Huh7-25-CLEC4M cells.",

Although we demonstrated that CLEC4M of human liver had a different glycosylation pattern from that of Huh7-25-CLEC4M cells (Fig. 1D), Ludwig and coworkers showed that HCV virus-like particles bound to LSECs of human liver tissue sections in situ [17]. Thus, a different glycosylation pattern of CLEC4M on LSECs may not affect the attachment of HCV. Lai and colleagues demonstrated that CLEC4M was expressed on human LSECs and functioned in binding HCV E2 glycoproteins but that primary human LSECs did not support HCVpp entry [15]. Thus, CLEC4M on LSECs is not an entry receptor for HCV. Therefore, LSECs should be resistant to HCVcc infection, and LSECs were indeed found to be resistant to HCVcc when co-cultured with J6/JFH-infected Huh-7.5 cells [15]. It is still unknown whether LSECs are permissive for HCV replication or not. Recently, Fletcher and associates showed that LSECs were not infected with HCVpp because expression of SR-BI and CLDN1 in the cells was very low [11]. They found that human brain endothelial cells expressed functional receptors that supported entry and replication of HCVcc. These results suggest that LSECs are unsusceptible to HCV infection due to the lower abundance of a few co-receptors on these cells. LSECs possibly function as a mediator of transinfection with HCV.",

We showed in the present study that CLEC4M actually mediated transinfection with bona fide HCVcc. However, the attachment of HCVcc to Huh7-25-NC cells was apparently similar to that of Huh7-25-CLEC4M (Fig. 3A). Nonspecific binding may be responsible for the attachment to Huh7-25-NC cells, which is qualitatively different from that of Huh7-25-CLEC4M cells. Such nonspecific binding is probably too weak to mediate transinfection of HCVcc to adjacent Huh7-it cells. The lack of internalization in this case indicates that transinfection might occur through the release of captured HCVcc to adjacent hepatocytes. In the case of human liver in vivo, transinfection mediated by LSECs can occur with or without internalization. In duck liver in vivo, duck hepatitis B virus was captured by LSECs, internalized into LSECs and then transferred to adjacent hepatocytes [6]. HIV-1 was also incorporated into dendritic cells by DC-SIGN and then transmitted to CD4 T cells via exosomes [21]. Thus, these viruses were temporarily pooled in reservoir cells to escape from host immune evasion. It is still unknown whether CLEC4M on human LSECs internalizes HCV and whether human LSECs are permissive for HCV RNA replication.",

After being washed, the cells were co-cultured with Huh7-it cells for 3 days, and HCV RNA was measured. As CD81-positive Huh7-it cells were permissive for HCV entry and highly susceptible to HCV replication, the level of HCV RNA 3 days post-incubation was 100-fold higher than in Huh7-25-CLEC4M cells. Bars indicate standard errors of triplicate experiments. Ctrl., immunoglobulin isotype control; *, P < 0.05",
