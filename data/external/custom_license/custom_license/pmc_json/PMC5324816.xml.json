In pigs and llamas, as well as dromedary camels (16) and alpacas (9), we detected virus predominantly in the nasal respiratory epithelium by IHC, ISH, or both. Accordingly, we mainly detected viral RNA, as assessed by RT-qPCR, in the nose, trachea, and bronchi of those animals. We also detected viral RNA in lung tissue from 2 of 4 pigs euthanized at postinoculation day 2. Virus shedding in dromedary camels and alpacas for longer periods, up to 14 days after experimental inoculation, has been reported (9,16,19). Of note, the level of MERS-CoV excreted in the nose of dromedaries seems to be much higher (16,19) than that of other animal species described so far, suggesting a more prominent role of dromedaries in transmission of MERS-CoV to humans.",

In our study, DPP4 distribution in the respiratory tract was similar among llamas and pigs but differed from that of dromedary camels (15). In contrast, DPP4 was barely detected in the respiratory tract of sheep, probably accounting for the lack of infection reported here. These results are in concordance with those reported by Adney et al., that MERS-CoV experimentally inoculated sheep showed no clinical disease and that only small amounts of virus were detected in nasal swab samples (20). Differences in susceptibility to MERS-CoV infection and level of virus excretion might also result from host factors associated with innate immunity. Surprisingly, horses were not susceptible to MERS-CoV despite high expression and wide distribution of the virus receptor along the respiratory tract. Moreover, the receptor binding domain, and in particular key amino acids on the docking site, are identical in horses and humans (21). Although human, camel, and horse DPP4 served as potent and nearly equally effective MERS virus receptors (22), horses were not productively infected by the strain of MERS-CoV used in this study. Detection of low levels of viral RNA in nasal swab samples until postinoculation day 2 can be attributed to residual inoculum. Similarly, a recent study with horses also showed low levels of MERS-CoV excretion and no virus neutralizing antibodies (20). ",

In that respect, PAS staining revealed differences in the number of goblet cells in the lining epithelium and mucus covering epithelial surfaces, which may have impeded the binding of the virus to the respiratory epithelium of horses. Also, virus tends to bind more to ciliated or nonciliated non\u2013mucus-producing cells and, in proportion, these cells may be fewer in horses than in llamas and pigs. However, it is possible that the guttural pouch empyema, which most likely was of bacterial origin (probably Streptococcus spp.), may have influenced mucus production in the horses. Although these observations are in line with those from studies in the field indicating the absence of antibodies to MERS-CoV in equids (14), this aspect should be studied further.",

To implement optimal serologic surveillance in countries where MERS is and is not endemic, identifying which animal species might be potential reservoirs for MERS-CoV, besides dromedaries, is crucial. The finding that pigs can be infected with MERS-CoV suggests that other members of the family Suidae could be susceptible to the virus, such as common warthogs (Phacochoerus africanus), bushpigs (Potamochoerus larvatus), and wild boars (Sus scrofa scrofa). Indeed, these animals are commonly found in the Greater Horn of Africa or the Middle East, sharing territories and water sources with dromedaries. Thus, members of the family Suidae might merit inclusion in MERS surveillance programs. Further studies need to be done to investigate MERS-CoV transmission within and among species to provide a better understanding of the role of potential reservoirs during an outbreak. Moreover, studies comparing the innate immunity of horses with susceptibility of other animal species (i.e., dromedary camels, alpacas, llamas, or pigs) are needed.",
