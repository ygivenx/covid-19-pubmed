Over 99% of SARS cases are characterized by pneumonia [5], and in the 2003 SARS outbreak an estimated 1,755 patients in Hong Kong were affected with an overall mortality of 17%. SARS re-emerges sporadically, as evidenced by the high prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV in animal traders in Guangdong [6], and thus poses a continuing threat. During the 2003 outbreak, the diagnostic accuracy of clinicians in Hong Kong was high, facilitated by the absence of any coinciding influenza or other respiratory infections [4]. However, the clinical, radiological and laboratory features of SARS are non-specific [7\u201310]. Therefore, if a coexisting outbreak of acquired pneumonia had occurred in the SARS-CoV-negative community, the diagnosis would have been hampered, with potentially catastrophic results.",

If early discriminating features are recognized, they may facilitate the diagnosis of SARS and hence the timely control of SARS transmission, since the overall detection rate for SARS-CoV RNA by PCR assays is currently only 60% in the first week of illness [15, 16]. It has been postulated that improvement of diagnostic guidelines specific to SARS would be much more cost-effective than testing with PCR assays; establishing an alternative diagnosis by influenza testing is another cost-effective strategy [17]. The World Health Organization has continued to call for the improvement of diagnostic guidelines for distinguishing SARS from other respiratory illnesses [18].",

Upper and lower respiratory symptoms were more common in non-SARS cases. Patients with non-SARS viral infections had higher systolic blood pressures and respiratory rates, and lower oxygen saturation readings than patients with SARS, which may reflect older age and premorbid status rather than pneumonia itself. The clinical diagnosis of pneumonia was supported by significant radiological changes more commonly in patients with SARS than non-SARS infection. Total leukocyte and neutrophil counts were higher in non-SARS viral pneumonia, but mean lymphocyte counts, although depressed, did not help discriminate among different etiologies. A recent study indicated that the absolute neutrophil count is discriminative between patients with SARS and those with other causes of community-acquired pneumonia [10].

It demonstrated that certain features are more commonly seen among SARS patients; if these are seen, SARS-CoV testing is probably indicated in the correct epidemiological setting [22]. On the other hand, specific SARS-CoV testing for all cases of acute febrile respiratory illness is not cost-effective and can cause social disruption due to the false-positive and false-negative results these tests can produce; this is especially true in the absence of worldwide transmission, since the prevalence of SARS is extremely low. Establishing an alternative diagnosis is a reasonable strategy and is likely to be more cost-effective [16]. This is especially important under the current threat of another pandemic flu. Although it is possible for a patient to have coincident SARS and influenza infections, the combination is unlikely. Nevertheless, during coincident SARS and influenza outbreaks, we cannot rule out the possibility that a patient may contract both.",

Nevertheless, the present study had several limitations. First, it was conducted at a single centre, so the applicability of our findings may vary depending upon the relative prevalence of the etiological agent during any particular period. Second, we compared patients with known SARS or non-SARS viral infection, while this status is not typically known in presenting patients. Third, viral illness follows temporal patterns, so single data measurements obtained during the epidemic may not allow for temporal variation; however, our study did focus on a similarly early period in the course of the illness. Fourth, the radiological assessment of SARS cases in 2003 was not as thorough as that conducted for patients in 2004. During the SARS outbreak, the high infectivity of the disease and the large number of patients limited some of the assessments. Only frontal radiographs were performed for most patients, and many radiographs were performed with mobile units. In some cases, film handling was minimized and only digital images were reviewed. Nevertheless, chest radiographs and assessments were performed following an established standard protocol. Our non-SARS group may not be representative since they were hospitalized patients. Non-hospitalized influenza cases may resemble SARS even more closely.",

Although there are clinical, laboratory and radiological differences between SARS and commonly occurring non-SARS viral respiratory infections, specific influenza testing is still important since these conditions can mimic each other clinically, despite their differences.
