The first group comprised symptomatic children whose respiratory specimens were submitted to the Clinical Virology Laboratory, Yale\u2013New Haven Hospital, New Haven, Connecticut. These respiratory specimens tested negative for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses (types 1\u20133), influenza viruses A and B, and adenovirus by direct fluorescence antibody assay. The second group comprised asymptomatic children at the hospital-affiliated pediatric clinic for well-child care. Nucleic acids were extracted from each specimen by using QIAamp nucleic acid purification kits (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA). Samples were screened by nested PCR for both KIV and WUV (for WUV, the first primers were those used by Gaynor et. al., and the nested primers were 5\u2032-GCGCATCAAGAGGCACAGCTACTATTTC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GCGCCTAGCCTGTGAACTCCATC-3\u2032). The G/C clamp for each primer is underlined (1,2). Positive and negative controls were included in each set of PCRs. All PCR products were sequenced. Any child who had multiple specimens with positive results was included once in the total number of children whose specimens tested positive for a given virus.",

As in studies by others, we detected WUV in asymptomatic and symptomatic children (3\u20135,13). This finding provides further evidence that asymptomatic infection of WUV may occur. KIV was not detected in any of the asymptomatic children we tested. However, it is possible that subclinical infection with KIV occurs and that we failed to detect any cases because of the low prevalence of KIV in our study population. Our study had only 15% power to detect a difference between 2.2% and 0% for KIV, whereas it had adequate power (90%) to detect a difference between 7.1% and 0% for WUV.",

The high rates of co-infection observed in our study and the studies of others support the notion that KIV and WUV may not cause respiratory tract disease.
