It was long thought that they were of little medical significance because they were only associated with upper respiratory tract infections, mainly the common cold. About 20 years ago, the findings of cultures and bacterial antigen detection tests in patients with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) suggested that RVs may sometimes be associated with LRTIs and the induction of asthma exacerbations, particularly in patients with underlying chronic severe disease [3\u20135].",

Moreover, analysis of full-genome sequences demonstrated that, in addition to the group A (RV-A) and B RVs (RV-B) classified on the basis of the similarity of partial genetic sequences and responses to certain antiviral drugs, there is also a third group of RVs (RV-C) [10]. Together with genetic differences, these new RVs were characterised by the fact that they could not be grown in standard tissue cultures, which may explain why they were not discovered before the development of molecular diagnostics.",

Upon enrolment, detailed information regarding their demographics, clinical history and the clinical characteristics of the disease was collected together with a blood sample for the evaluation of laboratory variables including white blood cell (WBC) counts, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and blood cultures. Drug treatment was chosen by the pediatrician in charge on the basis of the guidelines of the Italian Society of Pediatrics. In particular, these guidelines recommend the use of antibiotics in all the cases of radiographically confirmed CAP. In mild cases, ten days of oral therapy with amoxicillin (80\u201390 mg/kg/day in 3 doses) for children < 5 years or with an oral macrolide (dosage according to the chosen drug; clarithromycin 15 mg/kg/day in 2 doses is the macrolide used in our hospital) for children \u22655 years are recommended. For severe cases, therapy for 10\u201314 days with a combination of a third generation cephalosporin (cefotaxime 100 mg/kg/day i.v. in 3 doses is the antibiotic used in our hospital) plus a macrolide (clarithromycin 7.5 mg/kg/day i.v., in 2 doses or 15 mg/kg/day orally in 2 doses) is prescribed.",

They were subsequently tested using the RVP Fast assay in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Luminex Molecular Diagnostics Inc., Toronto, Canada). All of the xTAG RVP FAST reagents were provided by Abbott GmbH & Co. (Wiesbaden-Delkenheim, Germany). The RVP Fast assay consists of a single multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with labelled primers, followed by the single-step hybridisation of the PCR products with the fluorescent bead array, and incubation with reporter reagents. The plate was analysed using a Bio-Plex 200 System (Bio-rad Laboratories, Milan, Italy) and its associated software Luminex x PONENT version 3.1 (Luminex Molecular Diagnostics Inc., provided by Abbott), and the median fluorescent intensity (MFI) was determined. An MFI above the threshold level determined by the manufacturer for a particular target indicated a positive result for that target. The mean positive fluorescence intensities were established using Tag-It Data Analysis Software (TDAS, Luminex). The RVP Fast assay simultaneously detects influenza A virus (subtyped H1 or H3), influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-A and -B, parainflunzavirus-1, -2, -3 and \u22124, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), coronaviruses 229E, NL63, OC43 and HKU1, enterovirus/rhinovirus, and human bocavirus [13, 14].

More than 50% of them were hospitalized taking into account the severity of the disease (respiratory distress, SpO2 and radiological findings), and for infants, even in case of mild respiratory involvement, the presence of high fever (axillary temperature \u226539\u00b0C) was considered. Information regarding clinical evolution of the disease and involvement of family members were available for all the children at follow-up. More than 97% of the children received the antibiotic therapy according to the guidelines of the Italian Society of Pediatrics. Among enrolled patients, 435 (73.5%) were positive for at least one virus. RVs were identified in 172 cases (29.0%) and were the second most common infectious agents after respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which was found in 188 children (31.7%). A preliminary analysis of the prevalence of RVs and the RV A, B and C subgroups showed that there were no statistically significant differences by year of sample collection; consequently, all of the data collected in the four years were considered together.",

This may be particularly important in the case of RVs because a number of epidemiological studies have shown that they can be found in the respiratory secretions of 12\u201322% of asymptomatic subjects [18\u201321]. We looked for most of the known respiratory viruses with methods able to give reliable results in a short time. However, because all the viral samples were evaluated some days after respiratory specimens\u2019 collection, we did not ascertain the impact that the availability of the information due to this method could have had on physician\u2019s behavior, particularly as far as antibiotic prescriptions are concerned. This can explain why in almost all our patients antibiotic therapy was initiated and maintained for the entire period recommended by Italian pediatric guidelines for the treatment of CAP. Further studies that evaluate the impact on antimicrobial prescribing of viral findings with methods able to identify multiple viruses should be performed. In our study population, we found RVs as a single agent in about 60% of the children in which RVs were identified. This strongly suggests that RVs were the cause of the CAP diagnosed in many of our study patients, particularly in those in whom very low values of WBC counts and CRP were found. However, it cannot be excluded that in some of these cases RVs could have been associated with bacteria as recently found by Honkinen et al. [22]. Unfortunately, definition of bacterial etiology of lower respiratory tract infections is very difficult, particularly in younger children because the poor co-operation of the patient does not easily permit the collection of the secretions coming from the lower respiratory tract. Moreover, microbiological evaluation of the sputum, as performed by Honkinen et al. [22], does not necessarily lead to the identification of the true etiology because bacteria might be contaminants from the nasopharynx and are frequently carried by young children. On the other hand, blood culture, that was performed in this study in all the enrolled children, or molecular methods specifically devoted to the identification of bacterial pathogens in blood samples can give only a partial contribution to the solution of the problem because bacteremic CAPs are only the smallest part of the total number of CAPs diagnosed in children.",

This is in line with the finding of Miller et al. [23] who found that CAP is the most frequent cause of RV-associated hospitalisations in children aged 24\u201350 months, whereas other diseases are more frequent causes in younger patients, and this seems to suggest that, unlike RSV (whose importance is strictly age-related) [24], RVs are also a frequent cause of CAP in older children. The role of RVs as causes of CAP in older children is further supported by the frequency of RV-associated LRTIs in children aged 1\u201315 years, including pneumonia severe enough to require mechanical ventilation [25].",

However, these studies enrolled a significantly smaller number of children and were performed throughout the year; furthermore, the study of Linsuwanon et al. was carried out in a geographical area with very different characteristics (i.e., South Eastern Asia) and included patients whose diagnosis of CAP was not confirmed by chest radiography [28]. We only enrolled children whose radiographic findings were consistent with CAP, and the study was carried out in the winter and early spring. It is also worth noting that the circulation of RV strains can significantly differ from place to place and from month to month [3], and that their importance in causing LRTIs other than CAP may vary [29]. Consequently, it is possible that some studies enrolled children but with an LRTI other than CAP, and that the final prevalence rates may have been affected by the different circulation of the various RVs during the year and/or in different places [27, 28].",

Most of the co-infections observed during our study involved RSV, which may explain why we found only marginal clinical differences between single and multiple infections. The high incidence of co-infections with RSV, a virus that mainly causes lower respiratory tract involvement (including bronchiolitis) in the first months of life, also reasonably explains why the co-infected children had a younger mean age than those with single infections.

            "text": "This study has three limitations. First of all, it covered only some months of a single year and the activity of respiratory viruses can significantly vary from season to season. Second, it was confined to a single centre and so the cohort of enrolled children may not reflect nationwide RV infection. Third, it only enrolled children attending a hospital and, as it is highly likely that hospital assistance was not sought for some children with milder CAP, our data may not correctly estimate the true importance of RV as a potential cause of pediatric CAP. However, despite these limitations, we believe that our findings extend current knowledge of the clinical importance of RVs as causes of CAP in children. RV-associated CAP seems to be common not only in the first years of life but also in older children, and RV-A is the strain that is most frequently associated with the disease. The clinical relevance of RV-associated CAP seems to be mild\u2013moderate, without any substantial differences between the old A and B strains and the recently identified RV-C. Co-infections with other viruses do not seem to increase the severity of RV-associated CAP. All of these data are important for the management of pediatric CAP, the identification of the pathogens that require further study, and the development of safe and effective vaccines.",
