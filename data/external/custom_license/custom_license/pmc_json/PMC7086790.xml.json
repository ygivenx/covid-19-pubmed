Approximately 75% of HBV-related transmissions in healthcare workers are via percutaneous injury with a scalpel or needle; the remaining mode of transmission in these workers is via mucosal-cutaneous exposure. When an individual is positive for both HBsAg and HBeAg, there is a 22\u201331% risk of hepatitis [15]. Even in a high-risk working environment, medical workers have existing knowledge about infectious diseases and the appropriate use of guards such as gloves and masks. However, there is a higher risk of infection (and becoming Anti-HBc-positive) when non-medical workers, who lack this medical expertise, attend a disaster. The risk of HBV infection has been reduced by universal vaccination in several countries [16, 17], however the infection risk, not only in the medical field but also in the general population remains high, therefore it is advisable to extend universal vaccination to the rest of the world.",

            "text": "In this study, although it was only with a single case, HBV in postmortem blood successfully infected the HepG2 cell line (Table 3). HepG2 cells are a human hepatoblastoma cell line derived from a 15-year-old male with a well-differentiated carcinoma. HepG2 cells differ morphologically from primary hepatocytes. Recently, the sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) was identified as a receptor for HBV [18]; however, it is not expressed in HepG2 cells [19]. However, some reports have described binding and entry of HBV using normal HepG2 cells; furthermore, although virion production was not observed in these studies [20\u201323], it was following transfection of HBV DNA in related studies [8, 9]. It is therefore possible that the mechanisms of viral entry into HepG2 cells or hepatocytes has not been clearly elucidated. In our case study, we used normal HepG2 cells to observe the infection of HBV even though it is much easier to infect cells with HBV following NTCP expression. Even in these challenging conditions without NTCP expression, HBsAg and HBV DNA were detected in cultured cells. This finding does not conclude directly that HBV in postmortem materials remains infectious to humans, for instance it may be due to residual HBV in the culture dish. However, at least we can say that there is a possibility of infection.",
