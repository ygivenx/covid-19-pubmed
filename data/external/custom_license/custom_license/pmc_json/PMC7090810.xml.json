For example, use of starter cultures [e.g., lactic acid bacteria (LAB), staphylococci, and micrococci] for microbial fermentation is a crucial step to obtain microbiological safety of short fermented raw sausages as it can prevent growth of pathogenic microorganisms in these products. For that, starter cultures must be quickly increased at the initial ripening time (Luecke and Hechelmann 1985). They contribute to an improvement in hygienic safety, high and constant levels of quality, shelf-life and sensory attractiveness (Hammes and Knauf 1994). Besides the positive effect of improving organoleptic properties, different microorganisms are used as protective cultures (Abee et al. 1995). They compete with other organisms about nutrition and are able to produce antimicrobial substances like organic acid, hydrogen peroxide, diacetyl or bacteriocins (Jay 1982a, b; Kroeckel 1998).",

The latter ones are not food associated, but by using them an antiviral effect on the virus envelope should be assessed. In addition, the influence of lactic acid on the infectivity of MNV and H1N1 was examined. Furthermore, a screening for a possible antiviral effect of cell-free bacterial supernatants (LAB, Staphylococcus spp., Kocuria varians) was carried out for MNV.

Therefore, the effect of d,l-lactic acid on MNV and H1N1 was examined. The mean reduction of virus titres in comparison to values obtained at pH 6.2 is shown in Fig. 2. The virus titre was reduced between pH values of 5.0 and 6.2 by a maximum of 3.25 log units (MNV) and 2.5 log units (H1N1), respectively. The pH values did not differ from each other immediately and after 3 days of the exposure. All samples without virus were assessed as not cytotoxic. Also Straube et al. (2010) could detect a virus inactivation of influenza A viruses (H3N8) with lactic acid. However, it is known that the inactivation of influenza by acid depends on the different subtypes (Scholtissek 1985). Therefore, a direct transfer of the results to another subtype is limited. According to the results, it could be assumed that the pH decrease in fermented food like raw sausages could be an effective measure for risk reduction concerning viruses. An application of starter cultures with rapid and high acidification might improve the safety of raw sausages in relation to viral pathogens. However, investigations in fermented sausages with lactic acid should be carried out to confirm this.\n",

Only the cell-free supernatant of Lb. curvatus 1 showed a higher virus titre reduction of the MNV by 1.25 log units in comparison to the control. This antiviral effect was confirmed by five trials. Furthermore, it was verified that the mean virus titre reduction of MNV differed significantly from the control (p < 0.05). This supposes a bacterial strain-specific production of antiviral metabolites (Botic et al. 2007). Further investigations were carried out for determination of the antiviral properties of the cell-free supernatant. No significant antiviral effect could be obtained anymore (p > 0.05) after heating, whereas freezing did not significantly influence the antiviral effect on MNV compared to the native cell-free supernatant (p > 0.05). Therefore it might be assumed that the antiviral substance is of proteinaceous nature. An effect by hydrogen peroxide, often produced by different LAB, can be excluded by catalase treatment, because it did not significantly influence the antiviral effect of the supernatant on MNV (p > 0.05) (Fig. 3). Moreover, the cell-free supernatant was separated according to different molecular weights. All collected fractions from 2 to 100 kDa exhibited the same significant antiviral effect (p = 0.02) like the entire supernatant.

For example, the synergistic activity against moulds has been identified by a mixture of LAB-formed organic acids (Corsetti et al. 1998).
