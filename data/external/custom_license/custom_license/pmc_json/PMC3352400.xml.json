            "text": "The now conventional method for considering the evolution of virulence is about three decades old (Anderson and May 1979, 1982). It assumes that the parasite population has gone to its dynamic equilibrium (the endemic phase), such that the parasite population is no longer spreading in the host population. This model identifies the combination of transmission and virulence that leads to highest parasite fitness. The result is that selection maximizes the parasite reproductive number, R0 (or more properly, maximizes R; Day and Gandon 2007). R0 is a dimensionless number that equals the number of new infections started during the lifetime of the first infected individual in a susceptible population (R is the number of new infections from an infected individual once the parasite has established itself in the host population.) The formula for R0 is simply the parasite fecundity rate times the average lifetime of the infection. Although R0 is defined for the first infected host in a naive population, what maximizes R0 also maximizes R because the only difference between them lies in the value of S (Ebert and Herre 1996; Day and Gandon 2006; Gilchrist and Coombs 2006). The result that selection at the dynamic equilibrium favors maximization of R0 parallels the usual demographic result that selection favors maximal lifetime reproductive output in a stable population (Wilson and Bossert 1971; Charlesworth 1994). We will expand on the implications of R0 maximization below, but it is most informative to do so in the broader context of the second virulence evolution model, considered next.",

In the model, earlier reproduction is achieved by a higher transmission rate, which in most models also results in higher virulence because of an assumed trade-off between transmission and virulence.",

A trade-off means that the parasite cannot increase \u03b2 without incurring increasing death rates (\u03b4), although a more stringent criterion on the trade-off, such as the concavity used here, is required to select intermediate levels of virulence (Sasaki and Iwasa 1991). Following Lenski and May (1994) for now, we let \u03b4 be the sum of a constant host mortality plus virulence; we will refer to \u03b4 as simply virulence without loss of generality.

Both prior perspectives differ from a new approach that incorporates dynamics, selection and genetics simultaneously (Day and Proulx 2004; Day and Gandon 2006, 2007). This latter approach allows the virulence and transmission parameters to vary anywhere within the zone of attainable phenotypes, and it maps changes in the mean phenotypes as a function of selection and of genetic covariances between the two traits. The optima in this new approach are not altered, but the model is extended to include the evolutionary and population dynamics. This newer method thus subsumes the former ones.",

Indeed, if evolution to the optimum is fast enough, the duration of nonoptimal parasite behavior could be ignored. Yet, the approach to optimum virulence may be slow for a few reasons: (i) the optimum may be changing (Lenski and May 1994), (ii) virulence evolution will be influenced by the genetic covariance or mutational properties between virulence and transmission (Day and Gandon 2006), and (iii) there may simply be little genetic variation (see also Day and Proulx 2004). As Lenski and May (1994) pointed out, (i) the optimum will shift toward progressively lower virulence values as the density of the susceptible hosts is reduced by the epidemic. Thus the optimum will not be static, and the parasite can do no better than adapt toward the current optimum. Even in the absence of this effect, parasite evolution may be slow to reach the optimum because of (ii), pleiotropy or genetic covariances. Selection favors mutations with a higher fitness than the currently dominant strains. These mutations may improve transmission but may result in virulence further away from its optimum. Fig. 2 (bottom) shows that fitness isoclines run parallel to the invasion boundary, so all points on a fitness isocline have the same fitness, assuming that S remains constant. As can be seen for the trade-off boundary drawn, there is a wide range of virulence associated with each step of evolution toward the optimum, until the optimum is neared (depending on the shape of the trade-off). Thus, particularly during the initial phases of invasion, evolution of higher parasite fitness need not be accompanied by a change in virulence. Of course, other factors may also slow the approach to equilibrium, but these two follow directly from our model.",

In such a system, the initial parasite invasion would be followed by a reduction in host density to the dynamic equilibrium, and the resulting low absolute host density would greatly limit opportunities for the re-invasion of any parasite mutants that had an even more devastating impact on the host. Yet, host death is not the only outcome of infection. Recovery and consequent immunity is typical of many parasites (not necessarily precluding the death of some infected hosts). How does recovery affect our model? Here, we restrict ourselves to the extreme case that recovery is complete, so that a recovered individual cannot be re-infected by the same strain (see van Baalen 1998 for models of virulence evolution with partial recovery).",

Those mutants have their own invasion threshold, and depending on their parameters, those constraints may be much more lenient than the constraints applying to parasites unable to escape host immunity (Fig. 3). Thus, parasites that engender host immunity have the potential to cause repeated invasions, with potential high and devastating virulence each time. The dynamics of this process are sensitive to the nature of host recovery and virulence, however. A highly virulent parasite (most infections lethal) that reaches high abundance in the host population will crash the host population and not leave many recovered hosts, at least in the short term. Until host numbers rebound, there would be little opportunity for new parasite invasions because of the low absolute density of hosts. If recovery rate from infection is instead high, virulence (host mortality) is necessarily low, and the parasite impact on host density will be slight. In this latter case, the host population is soon prone to invasion of mutants that escape immunity. Thus epidemics that kill large numbers of hosts will experience longer lags before possible reinvasion than epidemics that do not kill many hosts.",

This indeterminacy applies to all evolution of virulence theories, and it is not otherwise possible to predict an optimum virulence per se when recovery is involved in the trade-off with virulence. The indeterminacy poses little problem for the invasion threshold perspective, however: the invasion threshold perspective merely specifies a range of possible virulence levels that can potentially invade.

There is obvious overlap among these models (and both are nicely subsumed in the covariance method of Day and Gandon 2006), but the emphases from them have differed. The R0 maximization model offers a single optimum, albeit one that may be sensitive to environmental conditions. It assumes dynamic equilibrium exists between host and parasite, hence does not apply when new parasite mutants invade. The other two models, Lenski\u2013May dynamic optimum and the invasion threshold, are similar in that both apply to invasions. The only difference is that one emphasizes the change of virulence optima during the invasion, the other addresses the range of virulence values that can invade and the nonequilibrium states that may persist after invasion. Without knowing the optima, the Lenski\u2013May and invasion threshold perspectives are difficult to distinguish, as either or both could obtain across repeated invasions. However, observing the evolution of an increase in virulence (instead of a decrease) as the epidemic matures would support the invasion threshold model for the initial virulence, because the Lenski\u2013May optima shift toward decreasing virulence as the epidemic matures. Likewise, if hosts merely die from the infection and do not recover (and are not resistant), then the invasion threshold model cannot possibly apply after dynamical equilibrium has been reached, because there is no reservoir of immune or resistant hosts to be exploited by a mutant parasite.",

Such a process would ensure that the invasion threshold model is relevant at many episodes in the parasite\u2019s history. The applicability of the invasion threshold model at some times does not exclude attainment of optima at other times.

In addition, the virulence of measles is notoriously sensitive to host nutritional status, so it is not clear what level of virulence to apply to the model.

            "text": "The virulence of influenza variants varies somewhat, although it is difficult to apportion mortality between the virus (its intrinsic virulence) and the host (whether it has any prevailing immunity to the strain). The case mortality rate of the H1N1 1918 flu that killed 20\u201340 million people worldwide was reported to be about 1%, somewhat more than a 10-fold excess of the typical mortality rate per infection of the viruses of today (Taubenberger and Morens 2006). The virulence of this strain appeared to wane over a few years. H1N1 disappeared in the 1950s, and its accidental reintroduction in 1977 to naive hosts did not lead to the high mortality rate of 1918, so it appears that the virulence per se evolved downward (Kilbourne 2006). Although mortality rates of the usual antigenic shift strains remain relatively constant, some high virulence exceptions are known (e.g., an H3N2 strain from 1997; O\u2019Donnell et al. 2003), and there may well be many low-virulence variants that go unnoticed. However, the H5N1 strain (bird flu) that is circulating widely in birds has a case mortality rate exceeding 50% in humans, far in excess of the mortality rate observed in any strain that established itself in humans (Webster et al. 2006).",

This artificial maintenance of high host density is in contrast to the usual pattern in epidemiological models that parasites regulate the densities of their hosts. These enforced high host densities have been suggested to be especially prone to the evolution of highly virulent parasites, because virulent parasites do not die out even when their hosts do.

Historically, a highly lethal gut infection of piglets in pig farms, a mutant form evolved (porcine respiratory coronavirus, or PRCV) that not only had altered tissue tropism but also apparently lower virulence (Kim et al. 2000). PRCV differs from TGEV by a small deletion and a couple point mutations, yet it infects the pig respiratory system and is often much less virulent than TGEV. There is some antibody cross reactivity between TGEV and PRCV, thus the population of one form of the virus interferes with the other, and it is suspected that a low virulence PRCV was responsible for the disappearance of TGEV in some pig farm areas. PRCV now exists in forms of high and low virulence. This example thus represents what may be a single mutant invasion in the recent history of TGEV. To what extent PRCV spread because it could overcome prevailing immunity (as assumed by the invasion threshold model) or because it had other advantages, is not clear.",

MDV has shown a progressive evolution toward increasing virulence over four decades, but again, many strains circulate and some have low virulence. Live vaccines have been used for three decades, the virus used in them having been changed twice. As with FCV, the vaccines do not prevent infection and replication by other strains, and it is widely suspected that the vaccines may have fostered the evolution of progressively higher virulence (references within Davison and Nair 2004; Hirai 2001). (We lack the control of viral evolution at high chicken density in the absence of the vaccine to have any confidence that the vaccine was the cause in the higher virulence evolution.) With MDV, there is considerable ambiguity in the causes of virulence evolution as well as in the spectrum of virulence evolution itself. It may well be that vaccines have selected escape mutants time and again. Whether escape mutants retained near-optimal virulence or not is difficult to establish, because there is a strong ascertainment bias \u2013 avirulent viruses are not noticed by chicken farmers. Thus, without understanding the range of virulence levels that have evolved, it is not practical to discriminate among the models. Such a system seems ripe for testing the models, however.",

It would be obvious folly to ignore a case in which the predicted optimum was low virulence but in which a highly virulent parasite could invade and persist.

Direct, quantitative tests of virulence optima are rare, nonexistent for human pathogens. If optima cannot be calculated, then it is of course difficult to test any nonequilibrium model against an optimality model. But an alternative to testing whether virulence is optimal is to observe the dynamics of virulence evolution.

The trade-off gives the minimum total parasite death rate (\u03b4) that could be achieved for a given transmission rate (\u03b2), so only points on and above the trade-off boundary are attainable by the parasite (shaded).

Points satisfying S* = \u03b4/\u03b2 lie a line radiating from the origin (of slope S*), so radii with progressively higher slopes represent parasite parameters that can invade only at progressively higher host densities. All parasites whose values fall in the darker shaded region below the line of slope S* and above the dashed trade-off boundary are attainable and can invade, whereas the light-shaded region above the invasion boundary represents values that the parasite can attain but do not allow invasion (for host density S*). The parasite population would eventually evolve toward the dot on the trade-off boundary (arrows), but it could create a potentially highly virulent epidemic from the start of the invasion until the evolutionarily equilibrium virulence was attained. (Bottom) Evolution following invasion may be slow to approach optimal virulence. The rightmost oblique line is a fitness isocline (of slope S*), and all points on it have equal fitness, superior to the fitnesses of all points to its left. Evolution would tend to move parasites progressively toward right-most isoclines, but as a mutant\u2019s relative position on the fitness isocline does not affect its fitness, evolution at each step could move virulence further or closer to the optimum (solid point) until the optimum was approached closely. The input of mutations (or genetic covariance between transmission and virulence) thus has a major impact on the evolution of virulence in these early stages (Day and Gandon 2007). Improved fitness need not greatly restrict the range of virulence values allowed, and indeed, virulence could evolve to deviate further from its optimum during intermediate stages of the adaptation. These arguments apply to constant host density, and if susceptible host density is declining, the fitness isoclines will have progressively shallower slopes.",

A mutant capable of infecting both susceptible and recovered hosts will have a much larger set of possible mutants that can invade (the invasion threshold is a line of slope S+R, where R is the density of recovered hosts, hence lies to the left of the line of slope S) and thus have greater potential to evolve nonoptimal virulence.
