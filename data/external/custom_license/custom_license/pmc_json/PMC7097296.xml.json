In the Journal of Experimental Medicine, Randolph and colleagues challenge that view. Using fluorescent latex beads, they show that bone marrow\u2013resident Gr-1hi cells acquire antigen indirectly by phagocytosing neutrophils and B cells that acquire the beads in the periphery and then migrate to the bone marrow. After leaving the bone marrow, Gr-1hi monocytes mature to become macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) and only then present the retained antigens to lymphocytes. These data have implications for how antigen is presented during infection with intracellular bacteria such as listeria, which are known to infect the bone marrow niche. DCB",

In the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, Suzuki et al. directly visualize HSCs in their bone marrow niche by generating 'knock-in' reporter mice in which green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression is driven by a tissue-restricted Gata2 promoter. Gata2-GFP expression correlates well with phenotypic and functional attributes of HSCs. In situ visualization of GFP+ cells in trabecular bone shows discrete GFP+Sca1+ cells in direct contact with osteoblasts near endosteal bone regions.Time-lapse movies show that these cells are mostly immobile in the bone marrow, in contrast to mobile GFP\u2212Sca1\u2212 cells that can be classified as early hematopoietic progenitor cells. These reporter mice not only provide insights into where HSCs reside in thebone marrow but also will be a useful tool for further analysis of HSC biology. LAD",

In Immunity, Takahama and colleagues demonstrate that cortex-to-medulla migration is essential for the establishment of central tolerance. CCR7-deficient thymocytes accumulate in the cortex, from where they can exit the thymus in a sphingosine-1 phosphate receptor\u2013dependent way. Although thymic egress occurs in the absence of CCR7, CCR7-deficient mice demonstrate autoimmune destruction of exocrine glands. Thymic epithelial cells expressing the autoimmune regulator transcription factor (Aire), which is essential for thymocyte exposure to peripheral tissue\u2013restricted antigens, are localized exclusively in the medulla. After positive selection, single-positive thymocytes spend an additional 12 days in the thymus. These results suggest that this 'extended stay' functions at least in part to impose central tolerance by exposing newly generated single-positive thymocytes to peripheral tissue\u2013restricted antigens.

In the Journal of Immunology, Ahmed and colleagues compare gut CD8+ memory T cells with recirculating TCM and TEM cells. Virus-specific gut CD8+ memory T cells differ in surface phenotype, contain more granzyme B, proliferate less and produce less interleukin 2, tumor necrosis factor and interferon-\u03b3 than their TCM and TEM counterparts. These disparate characteristics of splenic and gut memory CD8+ T cells are acquired gradually after virus infection but are reversible and depend on persistent localization in the spleen or the gut. These data add a new dimension to the TCM-versus-TEM paradigm and suggest that niche-specific factors might ensure that memory T cells are programmed to efficiently respond to niche-specific threats.

Whether such interactions occur in more physiological settings remains unclear. In the Journal of Experimental Medicine, Germain and colleagues use intravital and confocal imaging of mouse lymph nodes to show that long-lived NK cell\u2013DC interactions form in situ. NK cells are found in close proximity to paracortical and medullary DC networks in uninflamed lymph nodes. These NK cells are much less motile than T cells present in the same lymph node. NK cells are rapidly recruited from the bloodstream into draining lymph nodes after infection with Leishmania major. These newly immigrant NK cells localize to the paracortical T cell areas of the lymph node, where they also form intimate contacts with DCs and express interferon-\u03b3. These imaging studies show that DC\u2013NK cell communication networks form in physiologically relevant scenarios and affect DC-mediated T cell activation. LAD",

In the Journal of Immunology, Bergmann and colleagues characterize the mechanism for maintaining CNS immune privilege after vaccination against neurotropic coronavirus infection. Recrudescent coronavirus replication occurs because T cell\u2013mediated immune control is lost. Priming with virus antigen induces robust CD8+ T cell memory in the CNS that effectively clears acutely replicating virus after challenge. Nevertheless, such effective T cell priming cannot prevent viral recrudescence and loss of T cell\u2013mediated control. Virus-specific CD8+ T cells become quiescent because antigen presentation by CNS-resident cells is transient, as resident glial cells are found to rapidly lose expression of both major histocompatibility complex class I and class II molecules. Thus, although vaccination substantially enhances T cell immunity, intrinsic properties of immune privilege sites can abrogate those effector functions. DCB",
