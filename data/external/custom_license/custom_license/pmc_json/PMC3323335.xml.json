This threat became reality with the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The emergence of a disease requires two steps: introduction into the human population and perpetuated transmission. Although preventing the introduction of a new disease is ideal, containing a zoonosis is a necessity. The lessons that we have learned from SARS were the topic of a meeting of The Royal Society on January 13, 2004, in London, England.",

This finding led to bans in the wild meat trade from Nan Shan Zhong (Guangzhou Respiratory Disease Research Institute) similar to the ban on eating nervous system tissue from cows that was implemented after new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease emerged in Britain.",

Mathematic models provided a framework for evaluating alternative control measures and making predictions about the course of the epidemic (3,4). Previously, similar models had guided public health policy, for example, in halting an outbreak of hoof and mouth disease in the United Kingdom in 2001 (5,6). One of the complications in setting parameters in an emerging disease model is the difficulty in estimating epidemiologic limits from the initially small sample sizes. Thus, openly sharing data and analysis of key model parameters are vital.",

In areas most affected, contact tracing was important (10). In Guangdong, police departments tracked down contacts of infected persons, who were then followed up for 10 days after exposure.

Even if the transmissibility of an emerging disease is initially below the threshold necessary to sustain it in a population, the potential for the organism's evolution to higher levels may exist (14,15).
