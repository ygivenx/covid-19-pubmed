While in these countries, he was not exposed to any patients, health care facilities, or animals (including camels and bats) or their excreta. On May 11, the patient experienced chills and a fever (>37\u00b0C), and an allopathic medicine was prescribed when he first visited a local clinic. However, his symptoms worsened (temperature >38\u00b0C, myalgia, cough, and dyspnea), and after he had visited 4 hospitals (hospitals A\u2013D, in or around Seoul), he was admitted to a general hospital (hospital D, Seoul, South Korea) on May 18. A nasopharyngeal aspiration specimen was collected for MERS-CoV laboratory testing on May 19.",

Meanwhile, other patients and health care workers had multiple opportunities for exposure to the index patient (3\u20135). The 2 contacts reported here had each been exposed to the index patient. Patient 3 was probably infected via droplet transmission in the hospital room. The hospital room, originally built for 6 persons, had been divided into 2 rooms and lacked ventilation. Furthermore, an air conditioning unit cycled the air in the room with the door and window closed. Thus, poor ventilation might have played a major role in droplet transmission. Detection of MERS-CoV RNA in the respiratory tract varies up to day 33 (11\u201313). In this study, virus was detected in the respiratory tract, inconsistently, for up to 44 days. ",
