During the inflammatory response, neutrophils undergo sequential release of various granule subtypes and enhance respiratory burst activity with production of reactive oxygen species, with the potential to cause tissue damage [5, 6]. Evidence suggests that failure to control excessive inflammation and/or neutrophil activation may result in exaggerated systemic inflammation and organ damage, leading to severe disease [7\u201310]. Data examining the association between local the inflammatory response and severity of disease are limited. Since severe CAP is associated with significantly higher mortality than non-severe CAP, a better understanding of the local and systemic inflammatory responses in hospitalized patients with severe CAP may be necessary to develop novel strategies for the management of these patients.",

For eight out of the ten cytokines measured (IL-1\u03b2, IL-1ra, IL-6, IL-12p40, IL-17, IFN\u03b3, TNF\u03b1, and CXCL8), there was little if any interference, with measurements in the presence of DTT being, on average, within \u00b125 % of controls.

This is consistent with reduced bactericidal capacity and an inability to control bacterial infection. Indeed, reduced neutrophil respiratory burst activity has been reported in cases of sepsis [15]. The causes for the reduced respiratory burst in hospitalized patients with severe CAP are not clear. Nevertheless, the positive and statistically significant correlation found between neutrophil respiratory burst activity and the systemic levels of CXCL10 is interesting. A role for ROS in the activation of signaling mechanisms, including STAT-1 phosphorylation, involved in the secretion of CXCL10 has been reported [16]. Moreover, a reduced production of CXCL10 may also correlate with decreased ability to attract T lymphocytes, particularly the Th1 subset, to the lungs, therefore further compromising the ability to adequately control infection [17].",

A recent meta-analysis indicates that some of the most commonly-used scores such as PSI and CURB-65, previously derived and validated to predict 30-day mortality, have only moderate performance to predict ICU admission [12]. Moreover, it needs to be remarked that several factors influencing the PSI score may have direct effects on the inflammatory/immune response and, thus, be partially responsible for the observed results. Our two PSI-based severity groups differed significantly in terms of age and several co-morbidities. Aging is known to affect immune function at multiple levels, with both innate and adaptive immune responses being compromised with increased age [25\u201327]. Multiple studies, both in mice and humans, have analyzed the effect of senescence in macrophages and neutrophils, which are the main cells involved in the innate responses during CAP. Generally, macrophages and neutrophils from older individuals have been found to have deficits in the expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), opsonization and phagocytosis, bacterial killing, chemotactic responses, and production of cytokines and chemokines [25\u201327]. However, age by itself does not seem to be the only factor accounting for the differences observed in our study since comparison of elderly (>65 years old) vs. non-elderly patients showed no significant differences in neutrophil functional parameters (results not shown).",

Further studies are needed to better understand the contribution of the immune defects associated with these co-morbidities to the local lung response in CAP.

When the excessive local inflammatory response fills the pulmonary compartment, there is a spill of cytokines and inflammation into the systemic circulation, generating the systemic inflammatory response that is associated with severe CAP. The data from our study seem to indicate that, an exaggerated local inflammatory response is not associated with severe CAP, and on the contrary, patients with severe CAP have a significantly lower pulmonary inflammatory response in relation to patients with non-severe CAP. In agreement with the literature [7, 18\u201323], we found that patients with severe CAP have a significantly higher level of systemic inflammation, but the initial step to reach this systemic inflammation may not be an excessive local pulmonary inflammation. It can be hypothesized that, patients who are able to produce an adequate local pulmonary response are able to contain the microorganisms, do not develop an exaggerated systemic response, and present with a non-severe CAP. If a first response at the local pulmonary level is not sufficient due to some local level of immune deficiency, then a second response at a systemic level is elicited as the last attempt to control the infection. If this paradigm were to be correct, and patients with severe CAP have dual inflammatory responses with a low pulmonary response and a high systemic response, then the therapeutic management of inflammation in patients with severe CAP should be different for the lung and for the systemic circulation.",
