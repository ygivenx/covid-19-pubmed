The leading hypothesis is that the flu-like illness is caused by a new strain of coronavirus.",

The global response to SARS, 85 years later, has not been much different. \u201cWe will do, in this country, whatever is necessary to contain the spread of the epidemic,\u201d said Anthony Fauci, head of the US National Institute of AIDS and Infectious Diseases. \u201cIf that's quarantine, so be it.\u201d",
