Although there is debate over when and how they may happen, there is little question that such events could have significant and far-reaching health, social, and economic consequences. Moreover, smaller outbreaks, such as influenza and West Nile Virus,5 occur with greater regularity. Internists can play vital roles in identifying, responding to, and containing bioterrorist attacks and disease outbreaks if they understand their role in these events.",

As the early response may be crucial in containing the problem and minimizing resultant morbidity and mortality, efforts have been made to develop biosurveillance systems to detect outbreaks and attacks.7\u20139 These systems collect pertinent data (e.g., pharmacy drug sales, emergency department visit chief complaints, and air samples) and search for irregularities that suggest a problem is occurring. However, these systems are by no means foolproof because they only look for a finite set of clues, do not cover every part of the United States, and may provide equivocal information. Moreover, there could be delays between the point that biosurveillance systems detect suspicious patterns and when the public health system responds. Therefore, Internists might be the first to become aware of a problem and pivotal in initiating the public health response.",

Seven had mediastinal widening, and 8 had pleural effusions. All but 1 had elevated liver transaminases. A combination of these findings is highly suspicious for inhalational anthrax, especially in a young, otherwise healthy patient and/or when a patient initially experiences nonspecific influenza-like symptoms followed first by a brief period of apparent recovery, and then, by an abrupt resurgence of more severe symptoms.15 However, in a majority of cases, early symptoms are vague and readily mistaken for more common upper respiratory infections (e.g., influenza, plague, tularemia, and staphylococcal enterotoxin B) or viral gastroenteritis (e.g., hepatitis A, cryptosporidium, and salmonella).",

Specifically, Internists must be prepared to:\ntreat the exposed and infected. Different organ systems can be affected (e.g., meningitis from inhalational anthrax, sepsis from typhoidal tularemia, and pneumonia from influenza), so complete examinations are important. Websites providing extensive treatment and prophylaxis information include the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (http://www.bt.cdc.gov/), Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (http://www.fda.gov/cder/drugprepare/default.htm), Department of Health and Human Services (http://www.hhs.gov/disasters/index.shtml), and National Library of Medicine (http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/biodefenseandbioterrorism.html);administer prophylaxis to the exposed but not the infected. Determining exposure can be difficult as patients may claim that they have been exposed. In a large-scale epidemic or attack, public health officials may set up temporary stations for mass vaccination and prophylaxis. However, many patients may still appear at clinics requesting prophylaxis;triage who gets treated in a large outbreak/attack. Internists will have to prioritize who should receive treatment, especially when necessary resources and skilled manpower are limited. Knowing when and how to ration treatments can be challenging, particularly in chaotic conditions. Although Internists may feel compelled to acquiesce to every patient\u2019s needs, their primary responsibility in public health emergencies is the public.24 While clear guidelines have not been established and rationing decisions are rather controversial, certain groups such as essential personnel (e.g., health care workers, police, fire fighters, and other individuals integral in responding to a public health disaster) should receive priority. Essential personnel are needed to prevent more casualties and fatalities and could spread contagious diseases to many other people;treat mental health consequences. Public health disasters can result in significantly increased mental health problems including anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorders.25\u201328 Evidence suggests that even people who witness, hear, or read about a disaster can be affected.29,30 Shortages of mental health professionals in a disaster often require Internists to handle patients\u2019 mental health issues.31\u201335treat comorbidity exacerbations. Evidence suggests that undue environmental stresses can exacerbate comorbidities such as heart disease and respiratory disease.36\u201343 In addition, during public health disasters, patients with certain chronic diseases (e.g., diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases) may not have adequate access to maintenance treatments.44",

Laws vary from state to state, so Internists should be aware of their state\u2019s specific regulations. Unfortunately, many states have not yet adequately addressed or clarified medico-legal issues and regulations in public health disasters.45 Some of these include:\nlicensing and admitting privileges. Internists willing to provide assistance may not be licensed in that state, have appropriate admitting privileges, or have the time or means to complete the necessary paperwork before administering treatment. Some states (e.g., Colorado) have introduced statutes that ease some regulatory barriers by providing protection to health care workers during a public health disaster, such as allowing physicians to administer care even though they are not licensed in that state;malpractice liability. While states do have \u201cGood Samaritan\u201d laws that offer some legal protection to physicians who aid strangers in \u201cgood faith,\u201d the extent of these laws varies from state to state and currently do not cover all potential eventualities. \u201cGood Samaritan Laws\u201d may not apply when treatment is administered against a patient\u2019s will.58maintaining patient confidentiality. Bioterrorist attacks and epidemics require physicians to quickly transmit patient and case information to other health care personnel and appropriate authorities. While such communication is paramount, efforts should be made to maintain patient confidentiality and transmit only necessary information. At present, it is unclear how Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations would affect the public health and health care system response. In a public health emergency, the HIPAA Privacy Rule does allow disclosure of the following protected health information (PHI): for treatment by health care providers; to avert a serious threat to health or safety; to public health authorities for public health purposes; to protect national security; to law enforcement under certain conditions; and for judicial or administrative proceedings.59,60 However, during an emergency, misunderstandings of the Privacy Rule\u2019s requirements may hinder the flow of PHI.61",
