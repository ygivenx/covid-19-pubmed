Persons who develop severe acute lower respiratory illness within 14 days after traveling from the Arabian Peninsula or neighboring countries should be evaluated according to current guidelines (available at http://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/case-def.html). Persons whose respiratory illness remains unexplained and who meet criteria for \u201cpatient under investigation\u201d should be reported immediately to CDC through state and local health departments. Persons who develop severe acute lower respiratory illness who are close contacts\u2020 of a symptomatic traveler who developed fever and acute respiratory illness within 14 days of traveling from the Arabian Peninsula or neighboring countries may be considered for evaluation for MERS-CoV. In addition, CDC recommends that clusters of severe acute respiratory illness be investigated and, if no obvious etiology is identified, local public health officials be notified and testing for MERS-CoV conducted, if indicated.",

Specimens should be collected at different times after symptom onset, if possible. Lower respiratory tract specimens should be a priority for collection and PCR testing; stool specimens also may be collected. Specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions (available at http://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/case-def.html).",

This EUA is needed because, at this time, there are no FDA-approved tests that identify MERS-CoV in clinical specimens. This assay will be deployed to Laboratory Response Network (LRN) laboratories in all 50 states over the coming weeks. Updated information about laboratories with the capacity to conduct MERS testing with the NCV-2-12 rRT-PCR assay will be provided on CDC\u2019s MERS website (http://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/case-def.html).",
