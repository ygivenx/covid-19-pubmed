In the 2007\u201308 season, 45 viruses possessing H275Y mutation (total frequency of ORVs 2.6%; Figure 2, panel A) were observed in 10 prefectures, indicating that the frequency of ORVs was significantly lower than that in countries in Europe and the United States (8,11\u201314). In Tottori prefecture, however, 22 of 68 influenza viruses A (H1N1) tested possessed H275Y, showing a markedly higher frequency (32.4%) than that in other prefectures. In the 2008\u201309 season, however, ORVs were observed nationwide. Of 1,482 influenza viruses A (H1N1), 1,477 viruses possessed a H275Y mutation, for a total frequency of 99.7% (Figure 2, panel B). These data show that ORVs increased dramatically in Japan from the 2007\u201308 season to the 2008\u201309 season.",

Most ORVs with H275Y belong to clade 2B, which can be further divided into 2 distinct lineages by an aspartic acid to glycine substitution at aa 354: a Northern-Eu lineage sharing 354G, which was first isolated from countries in northern Europe and now represents most ORVs worldwide; and a Hawaii lineage sharing 354D, which was first detected in Hawaii and was rarely isolated in a few countries during the 2007\u201308 season (Appendix Figure). In the 2007\u201308 season, of 45 ORVs, 1 virus (A/Yokohama/91/2007) isolated in November 2007 belonged to clade 2C, and 44 viruses fell into either the Hawaii lineage or Northern-Eu lineage. Conversely, in the 2008\u201309 season, all ORVs belonged to the Northern-Eu lineage, indicating that ORVs of the Northern-Eu lineage dominated in the 2008\u201309 season in Japan.",

The NA gene of some ORVs had only 1 nucleotide difference from that of OSV counterparts (i.e., A/Tochigi/8/2008 and A/Tochigi/9/2008, A/Nagano/1100/2008 and A/Nagano/1071/2008, A/Yamagata/68/2008 and A/Yamagata/41/2008, respectively), and the other ORVs are also genetically close to OSVs from Japan (Appendix Figure). These HA genes were also genetically identical or close together (Appendix Figure), suggesting that almost all ORVs from Japan with the Hawaii lineage are derived from OSVs from Japan. On the other hand, in the Northern-Eu lineage, OSV counterparts were not observed, but foreign ORVs genetically close to ORVs from Japan were observed. During the 2007\u201308 season, the NA gene of ORVs from Japan was close to that of ORVs isolated from countries in Europe (i.e., A/Paris/0341/2007 and A/England/26/2008). During the 2008\u201309 season, the ORVs from Japan, which shared A189T on HA protein, were further divided into 4 subclades (C-1 to C-4) by common amino acid changes on HA and/or NA (Appendix Figure). ORVs from Japan in C-2 and C-3 were genetically close to the ORVs isolated from North America or Hawaii (e.g., A/Memphis/03/2008 and A/Hawaii/19/2008), whereas ORVs in C-1, representing most influenza viruses A (H1N1) from the 2008\u201309 season in Japan, and ORVs in C-4 were close to ORVs isolated from South Africa and Australia in the Southern Hemisphere (e.g., A/Kenya/1432/2008 and A/Victoria/501/2008). All ORVs except C-3 were isolated before the emergence of ORVs from Japan in each subclade. These findings suggest that ORVs from Japan within a Northern-Eu lineage would not have emerged domestically but instead may have been introduced from various countries.",

These data suggest that D151 changes have a substantial effect on sensitivity to zanamivir (and oseltamivir). Moreover, A/Tottori/44/2008 with H275Y and D151D/G substitutions conferred high-level resistance to both NAIs (Figure 3, panels A and B). However, a recent study reported that a D151E change was detected only after virus propagation in cell culture, but not in the original clinical specimen (19), suggesting a possible role of cell culture in selecting these D151 variant viruses. To further investigate D151 variants, available original clinical specimens of viruses with D151 variation were subjected to NA sequencing, so that all D151 variations (D151G/E/N) were not detected in the original clinical specimens (Table 1). We thus concluded that D151 variants might not have emerged as a natural occurrence and all recent ORVs would retain sensitivity to zanamivir.",

Because this use could cause efficient selection of ORVs in individual patients, Japan might be the initial site of worldwide spread of ORVs. However, long-term NAI surveillance in Japan during 1996\u20132007 and recent surveillance showed a low frequency of NAI-resistant viruses for any strains and subtypes (10,21,22), suggesting that transmissibility of ORVs selected by drug pressure was remarkably decreased. In addition, previous NAI surveillance (5\u201310) and several animal studies (23\u201326) also suggested that NAI-resistant viruses would become defective viruses with attenuated infectivity and transmissibility to human. In contrast, despite little NAI use, a high emergence of ORVs has been detected in several countries in Europe since November 2007. These ORVs had as efficient transmissibility as OSVs in human-to-human transmission, resulting in worldwide spread in a short period of time. Although whether the initial ORV detected in Norway in the 2007\u201308 season appeared because of NAI drug pressure is unknown, those ORVs may have obtained amino acid changes on NA and/or other proteins to compensate for the defect, in addition to the H275Y substitution on the NA protein. Most ORVs belong genetically to the Northern-Eu lineage in clade 2B, suggesting that the gene constellation may contain a big advantage to retain infectivity and transmissibility.",

In 2008\u201309, the ORVs in C-1, which comprised most isolates in 2008\u201309, and ORVs in C-4 were genetically similar to ORVs isolated from the Southern Hemisphere. Because influenza activity in the Southern Hemisphere occurs half a year earlier than that in the Northern Hemisphere, most ORVs in Japan conceivably could have been imported from the Southern Hemisphere. ORVs in C-2 and C-3 were genetically similar to ORVs isolated in North America and Hawaii, but the collection month of ORVs in C-3 were similar to each other, suggesting that ORVs in C-3 might be derived from an unknown common origin ORV.

The amino acid changes D151 to N or E among subtype H1N1 viruses and to A, G, E, N, or V among H3N2 have been reported (7,8,19), and viruses with D151 substitutions often exhibit reduced sensitivity to NAIs (8,19,29).

Conversely, in March and early April 2009, a new swine-origin influenza virus A (H1N1) (now known as pandemic [H1N1] 2009 virus) emerged in Mexico and the United States and spread rapidly to many countries, including Japan (30\u201333). In June 2009, detection of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus with H275Y on the NA protein was reported from Denmark, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, People\u2019s Republic of China, and Japan, but all ORVs of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus emerged as sporadic cases with no evidence of efficient human-to-human transmission (34). Although oseltamivir remains a valuable drug for treatment of pandemic (H1N1) 2009, many ORVs were isolated after prophylaxis with a half dose of the drug. Therefore, prophylaxis with oseltamivir may not be recommended as stated by WHO (35). Rapid and continuous monitoring of NAI-resistant viruses, including pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus, and dissemination of the findings in timely manner remains essential.",

The NESID Network monitored influenza activity during the 2007\u201308 season (week 36, September 2007\u2013week 35, August 2008) and 2008\u201309 season (week 36, September 2008\u2013week 22, May 2009).

Boldface line indicates weekly cases of influenza-like illness per influenza sentinel clinic (values shown in right bar). Bars indicate numbers of influenza A (H1N1) (yellow), A (H3N2) (blue), and B (red) isolates (values shown in left bar).

Among all influenza isolates, influenza A (H1N1) consisted of 81% during 2007\u201308 and 49% during 2008\u201309.
