            "text": "It is difficult to prove that detection of HPIV from the upper respiratory tract was associated with LRTI. However, a concurrent study only rarely found HPIV from nasal pharyngeal swabs taken from a comparison group of persons without respiratory illness. From August 2004 through December 2007, a sample of patients without fever, diarrhea, or respiratory symptoms in the previous 3 days was selected from the outpatient clinics of the hospitals participating in surveillance (H Baggett, personal comm). Overall, 1647 asymptomatic controls were tested with rRT\u2010PCR for HPIV\u20101, HPIV\u20102, or HPIV\u20103; 12 (0\u00b773%) were positive, 5 were HPIV\u20101, 2 were HPIV\u20102, and 5 were HPIV\u20103. Three (25%) of 12 HPIV\u2010positive controls were aged <5 years. Thus, it seems likely that HPIV detected from hospitalized patients was associated with their current illness.",

Previous studies of HPIV infection in Southeast Asia found seasonal peaks; a 2\u2010year study in Thailand found a February\u2013March peak, and a 4\u2010year study in Singapore found a February\u2013May peak.\n22\n, \n23\n In the United States, HPIV\u20103 prevalence increases in spring and summer months, while HPIV\u20101 prevalence increases in the fall.\n1\n, \n18\n HPIV\u20101 circulates biennially during odd\u2010numbered years, and it is uncommon to have both serotypes cocirculating. It has been proposed that cross\u2010protection of antibodies from previous HPIV infection influences the predominance of circulating HPIV type.\n21\n During our 4 years of surveillance in Thailand, HPIV\u20101 circulated every year, but there appeared to be increased circulation beginning in October of two of three odd\u2010numbered years. Also, it was common for both serotypes to cocirculate, at least at low levels.",

Even though prospective enrollment of hospitalized patients in a well\u2010defined population with independent radiographic confirmation of pneumonia provided a robust estimate of HPIV\u2010associated pneumonia incidence, our study included only hospitalized patients with CXR performed, which only represents one part of the severe end of the disease spectrum. As HPIV infection also causes other syndromes that can require hospitalization, such as croup and asthma exacerbation, as well as less severe disease, HPIV infection burden in Thailand likely exceeds our estimates. In the third year of our study, we used only RT\u2010PCR to detect HPIV without serology and likely failed to identify a few patients. However, approximately 90% of infections for each HPIV type were detected by RT\u2010PCR in the first 2 years when both methods were used. We also found that 8\u00b74% of patients with HPIV had coinfection with other viral respiratory pathogens, and it is not possible to conclusively determine which of these pathogens was the primary cause of the pneumonia.",
