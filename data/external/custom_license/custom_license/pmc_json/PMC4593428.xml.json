In this study, we used molecular tools (PCR assays) to assess the prevalence of R. felis in blood specimens from febrile and afebrile children from rural, semiurban, and urban areas of Gabon. One of the most frequent pitfalls of PCR assays is the contamination of samples, which can occur any time during or after collection of the samples, including during their use in the laboratory. Over the years, the URMITE laboratory has developed strategies and applied rigorous procedures to prevent and detect contamination (18\u201321). For example, we require that 2 different PCR assays show positive results before we conclude that a sample is positive (21).",

The Rickettsia spp.\u2013specific assay can amplify almost all Rickettsia spp., including R. conorii and R. rickettsii, but it is less sensitive than the R. felis\u2013specific assay. When a sample in our study was positive by the Rickettsia spp.\u2013specific qPCR, it was also positive by the R. felis qPCR. Several samples had positive results for only 2 of the 3 genes targeted by the R. felis\u2013specific qPCR. This discrepancy might be explained by possible genetic diversity of the R. felis strains. The 3 genes used for the R. felis\u2013specific assay are not all conservative, so it is possible that some strains have a certain degree of genetic diversity that may occasionally cause false-negative PCR results. Our results were also systematically validated by using rigorous criteria. To check the quality of each PCR run, we used negative controls (i.e., PCR mix without template) with every tenth sample, and we used 2 positive controls (R. felis DNA) per run. In addition, we required that all negative and positive controls be systematically correct (i.e., negative and positive, respectively) before validating each PCR run, and a sample was not considered R. felis\u2013positive unless confirmed by at least 2 of the 4 sequences of targeted DNA. Thus, we consider our results to be valid. The fact that R. felis DNA has not been detected in samples (from febrile patients in France and Tunisia) previously analyzed in our laboratory (14) provides further support of our team\u2019s ability to prevent and detect contamination during PCR runs. Furthermore, it has been reported that the prevalence of R. felis is low in northern Africa countries (France, Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia) and increases in southern Africa countries (Mali, Senegal, Gabon) (14).",

Differences in the prevalence of a possible vector or reservoir, or both, and disparate health care\u2013associated conditions, including environmental conditions, poverty, and the availability and quality of health care facilities, between rural and urban areas may influence the distribution of R. felis in Gabon; however, these factors have not been determined. An increased prevalence of R. felis was observed during the rainy season.

The factors explaining the spread of R. felis in Gabon should be evaluated in further studies. Although R. felis is widespread in Africa and unequally distributed in Gabon and Senegal (14), its prevalence varies by country: 15.0% in Senegal (14), 3.0% in Mali (14), and 7.2% in Kenya (5). In our study, R. felis was mainly detected in young febrile children <5 years of age (primarily in those 1\u20133 years of age). In a rural area of Senegal (Dielmo and Ndiop), the incidence of R. felis infection has also been reported to be higher (reaching 36%) among febrile children 1\u20133 years of age, but the incidence was lower (0.1%) in persons >15 years of age (14). It has been reported that the seroprevalence of R. felis increases with age in areas where the bacterium is endemic (5). This increase is probably due to exposure to the bacterium during the course of a lifetime, leading to protection by a progressive development of immunity against this bacterium in adults.",

In some cases, we have also observed a mistake in methodology: data comparisons were performed between samples from afebrile persons in an occidental area and from febrile persons in Africa (31). The epidemiology of microorganisms depends on the studied areas, and the positive predictive value of a disease depends on its symptoms and epidemiology. For example, Plasmodium falciparum, the primary agent of malaria, is commonly detected in blood specimens from apparently healthy, afebrile persons in Sub-Saharan Africa; prevalence can reach 20% in Ethiopia and 32% in Senegal (32,33). Respiratory viruses, including influenza virus, have also been found in 12% of nasopharyngeal samples of asymptomatic Hajj pilgrims (34). More recently in Tanzania, the prevalence of S. pneumoniae DNA was less frequently detected in febrile (5.1%) than afebrile (6.3%) persons (35). Thus, these examples show that even well-known pathogens may be detected in blood or respiratory secretions of afebrile persons. The inclusion of control groups of participants in studies is indispensable to a better understanding of infectious diseases; the use of controls has shown the existence of carriers of well-known pathogens, emphasizing that it is not easy to interpret data about the potential pathogenic role of a microorganism. The finding of R. felis in febrile versus afebrile persons is not well characterized. The overall prevalence of R. felis in Gabon was higher in febrile (10.2%) than afebrile (3.3%) children, but the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.09). Of more interest, in rural Fougamou, the difference in prevalence was significantly higher in similarly aged children with and without fever (39.7% vs. 5.0%, respectively; p = 0.004). Therefore, the presence of R. felis in febrile and afebrile persons should not exclude that this bacterium is a cause of fever in sub-Saharan Africa.",

In other studies, these teams confirmed and extended the preliminary data: 1 team showed that the presence of R. felis was 2.2 times higher in blood specimens from febrile persons compared with afebrile persons in Kenya (5), and the other team showed that the prevalence of R. felis was significantly higher in febrile (15.0%) than afebrile (4.0%) persons in Senegal (14). In Senegal, an 8-month-old febrile girl was cured of R. felis infection after treatment with doxycycline (36). The presence of R. felis has also been observed in blood specimens from febrile patients in Asia (37). The higher prevalence of R. felis among febrile persons compared with healthy persons in our study led us to suspect that this microorganism plays the role of pathogen. However, the presence of the microorganism may be a cofactor or the cause of a previous event not yet determined. Another hypothesis would be that blood specimens may be contaminated by surface bacteria, including R. felis, which has been detected on the skin of healthy persons in Senegal (38).",
