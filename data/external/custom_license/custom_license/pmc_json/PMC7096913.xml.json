            "text": "Coronaviruses are enveloped positive-stranded RNA viruses with the largest currently known RNA genomes. Expression of their genomes begins with the translation of two large replicase polyproteins, pp1a (>4,000 residues) and pp1ab (>7,000 residues), which are encoded by the viral replicase gene that comprises open reading frame 1a (orf1a) and orf1b1. pp1a and pp1ab are extensively processed by orf1a-encoded proteases to yield 15 or 16 mature nonstructural (replicase) proteins that assemble to form the membrane-associated viral replication and transcription machinery, which is vital to the viral life cycle2. Together with a number of cellular factors, this machinery synthesizes not only genome-sized RNA but also a nested set of eight subgenomic mRNAs. These subgenomic mRNAs are predicted to express all ORFs downstream of orf1b, encoding a variety of structural and accessory proteins3,4,5. Knowledge of the structure and organization of coronavirus replication and transcription machinery at the molecular level is limited. However, the extraordinary size of the coronavirus replicative polyproteins, their generally large phylogenetic distance from those of other RNA viruses and the presence of several predicted RNA-processing activities that are not found in other positive-stranded RNA viruses suggest that this machinery is of unparalleled complexity3,6,7.",

Its genome is \u223c29.7 kilobases long (excluding the 3\u2032 poly(A) tail) and is predicted to contain 14 functional ORFs3,4,5, encoding 16 replicase proteins, 4 structural proteins and 8 accessory proteins3. The replicase proteins are expected to have multiple enzymatic activities, and some of these have been ascertained experimentally6. The activities of a papain-like protease (PL2pro, also known as nsp3), a main protease (Mpro, also known as 3CLpro or nsp5), a single-stranded (ss) RNA\u2013binding protein (nsp9), an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, also known as nsp12), a superfamily 1\u2013like helicase (HEL1, also known as nsp13) and a uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (NendoU, also known as nsp15) were recently established and characterized3,6,16,17,18,19,20.

HB1\u20133 interact with one another mainly through hydrophobic residues.

In other structures, homologous multimers of one type always stack on those of another type as layers with high degrees of symmetry. The absence of any one kind of protein markedly affects the global shape of the complex. Two such examples are the structures of the multienzyme complex Rubisco24 and the GroEL\u2013GroES\u2013ATP complex25. In contrast, the relationship between nsp7 and nsp8 multimers in the supercomplex is not stacking but cross-linking. nsp8I and nsp8II constitute the framework of the supercomplex as 'bricks,' and nsp7 stabilizes and fills this configuration as 'mortar.' Loss of nsp7 should not markedly change the shape of the structure (Fig. 3d). Thus, we conclude that the nsp7\u2013nsp8 hexadecamer demonstrates a new mode of protein architecture in large macromolecular complexes. The relationships between the 16 monomers are shown in Supplementary Figure 3 online.

We found that the four long helices of nsp8I could insert into the grooves of dsRNA and the positively charged residues on these helices are conserved in all homologous coronavirus nsp8 proteins. To test whether these residues are related to nucleic acid binding, we identified several basic residues located around the channel (Supplementary Fig. 6 online) and designed three mutants: nsp7m (nsp7 R26A K32A), nsp8m1 (nsp8 K77A R80A) and nsp8m2 (nsp8 K63A R84A R85A). We then performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) to examine the nucleic acid binding affinity of each mutant. The results showed that the nucleic acid binding affinities of nsp8m1 and nsp8m2 were much weaker than that of the wild-type protein, whereas mutations in nsp7 had no effect (Fig. 4c,d). With a calculated isoelectric point of 6.5, nsp8 should not bind nucleic acids by electrostatic interaction, unlike basic proteins. As nsp8 contains a total of 22 positively charged residues (lysines and arginines), the change in overall charge caused by the loss of two or three of these should not result in a marked change in affinity. Furthermore, the mutations did not affect supercomplex formation and stability, as we ascertained by gel filtration and crystallization experiments (data not shown). The only explanation is that the locations of these mutated residues make them essential for nucleic acid binding. As they are all located around the central channel, we conclude that the channel should encircle nucleic acid. In addition, the results of EMSAs showed that nsp8 mutants have higher affinity for dsRNA than for dsDNA, as they could still bind dsRNA but hardly bound dsDNA. This suggests that dsRNA is the likely natural binding partner of the nsp7\u2013nsp8 supercomplex.",

The electrostatic properties of the hexadecamer and the diameter of its central channel are similar to those of PCNA and the \u03b2 subunit ring, the processivity factors of DNA polymerase26,27, which encircle dsDNA and interact with the polymerase to confer high processivity on it29. Coincidentally, experiments on MHV have shown that RdRp co-immunoprecipitates with nsp8, nsp9, nsp5 (main protease, also called Mpro or 3CLpro) and nsp13 (helicase)30, which also implies an interaction between RdRp and the nsp7\u2013nsp8 hexadecamer. Their remarkably large genomes and putative proofreading activities suggest that coronaviruses may differ from other RNA viruses and share unprecedented similarities with DNA-based life forms in the mechanisms of genome biosynthesis6. The hexadecamer might be a factor that binds and trails RdRp, conferring high processivity on it for efficient replication of the extremely large coronavirus genome. Such a binding mode would give a molar ratio of 8:1 between nsp7\u2013nsp8 and RdRp, which agrees with the natural abundance of orf1a-encoded nsps in the replication and transcription machinery (three- to five-fold in excess of orf1b-encoded nsps such as RdRp, helicase, exonuclease and others) resulting from a ribosomal frameshifting mechanism1.",

Analytical ultracentrifugation experiments further indicate that SARS-CoV nsp8 interacts with nsp9, a ssRNA-binding protein20. In addition, the disorder of the nsp8 N-terminal region has been seen to decrease upon the addition of nsp9 to nsp8 (ref. 20). On the basis of the nsp7\u2013nsp8 hexadecameric structure, the most probable nsp9-binding site should be in the region formed by the N-terminal 50 residues of nsp8II, which is located at the entrance of the channel and has high flexibility with missing electron density. Wrapping of ssRNA around the nsp9 dimer is suggested by the nsp9 structure and by a study using tryptophan fluorescence quenching19. We therefore consider that the function of the nsp9 dimer might be to protect the newly unwinding nascent and template strands emerging from the channel of the nsp7\u2013nsp8 complex, which have not yet formed a stable secondary structure, from nuclease processing.",

Sixteen molecules associate tightly with one another to form a handled hollow cylindrical structure in which the coexistence of two conformations (nsp8I and nsp8II) is observed. Its novel architecture and unique mode of assembly should provide new insights in the field of macromolecular complex structures. Designing peptides or nonpeptidyl compounds that mimic the interaction interface between nsp7 and nsp8 is one strategy to block supercomplex formation and interfere with virus replication.
