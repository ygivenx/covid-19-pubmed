The preexisting antibodies against PRCV/TGEV in pigs did not neutralize SARS-CoV and decreased during the experiment. Neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV developed in pigs, with titers ranging from 1:10 to 1:160 at the time of euthanasia. The SARS antibody titers corresponded for both types of virus neutralization tests (the macrotiter plaque reduction assay and the microtiter CPE blocking assay). Table 4 summarizes the changes in SARS- and TGEV-neutralizing antibodies in pigs during the course of the experiment. No antibodies >1:10 were detected in chicken serum samples on the final bleed.",

Clearance of low or nonreplicating intravenous inoculum from blood, including the viral RNA, occurs rapidly in a number of viruses (8,9). In light of the typical clearance rates and the estimated initial virus load of 5 PFU/100 \u03bcL (porcine blood), the detection of RNA, corresponding to a minimum of 10-3 PFU/ 100 \u03bcL, in blood at 48 h after inoculation is likely not due to a nonreplicating residual virus inoculum. Our data suggest that pigs and chickens of the age used in the experiment were infected with SARS-CoV and, to a very limited degree, supported virus replication. The unsuccessful attempts at virus isolation could be explained by a very low rate of virus replication perhaps combined with loss of infectivity during the sample collection and processing. Although the observed decrease in virus recovery (virus spiked control samples) is not significant, it may have played a role in case of the low virus load. The intravenous route likely does not represent the route of infection in a field situation, and the question of possible natural infection of chickens and pigs with SARS-CoV remains open.",

These antibodies did not cross-react with TGEV/PRCV in a TGEV neutralization assay (PRCV and TGEV are indistinguishable in the virus neutralization assays) (10). Likewise, the preinoculation serum samples with the highest TGEV-neutralizing antibodies did not neutralize SARS-CoV, and the neutralizing antibodies against TGEV decreased as the SARS antibody titers increased. Based on the serum neutralization tests, TGEV/PRCV and SARS-CoV do not appear to be antigenically closely related, an observation supported by the initial genomic analysis (1,2). The cross-neutralization with TGEV/PRCV was initially a concern after the publication of immunohistochemical assays on SARS-CoV\u2013infected cells (11). Since virus-neutralizing antibodies often take approximately 3 weeks to develop in chickens, no conclusions were made with regard to the low or absent antibody titers in their sera at 2 weeks after inoculation. In conclusion, the limited extent of virus replication as indicated by RT-PCR, the failure to isolate the virus, and the lack of virus shedding indicate that neither pigs nor chickens are likely to play a role as an amplifying host.",
