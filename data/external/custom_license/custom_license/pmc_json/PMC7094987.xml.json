As yet, they do not know whether the virus is present in the blood of symptomless carriers, although most consider this unlikely by extrapolation to other viral infections. Agencies such as the US Food and Drug Administration and the Frankfurt Blood Bank are looking at screening strategies to identify the virus, should it turn up in blood.",
