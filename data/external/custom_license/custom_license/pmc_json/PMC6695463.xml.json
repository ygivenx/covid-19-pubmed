Predictive diagnostics, targeted prevention, and personalization of medical services are the main objective of the predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine (PPPM). Translational medicine was introduced recently to emphasize the appropriate translation of knowledge from studies at the bench side to care at the bedside. Economic circumstances and missing political regulations are among the factors resulting in the blockage between the bench and bedside; to these, we should add the applicability of the bench studies as the foundation of clinical investigation and subsequent clinical trials. In order to efficiently indorse the translational medicine as the \u201ccatalyzer\u201d for the practical implementation of the accumulated scientific achievements, an appropriate dialogue is essential between three clusters of \u201cclinician, clinical investigator, and PPPM relevant professional groups,\u201d \u201cthe bench scientists,\u201d and \u201cindustry and policy-makers\u201d [1, 2].",

When an animal model is used as the basis of a clinical trial, it is needed to mimic the complex properties of the patients. Otherwise, animal models might be misleading; consequently, a large number of therapeutic modalities might have lost in translation [7]. This study was therefore undertaken to provide shreds of evidence against the validity of animal models. It has been systematically discussed why the authors believe that it is time to re-evaluate the validity of animal experimentations. Although plenty of state-of-the-art disease modeling techniques have been introduced recently, their acceptance and application in the medical science society are scarce; nevertheless validity of these modern modeling techniques needs further evaluation as well. There is a gap between bench and bedside that, unfortunately, has not been appropriately filled with the animal models. In our contribution, we want to provide relevant facts which clearly show that translational medicine and PPPM need accurate surrogate for misleading animal models in order to increase the level of the future healthcare. In this article, we review the knowledge on inappropriate modeling of chronic and complex disorders, which is very important point for the predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine. The translation medicine in this point has to deal with this problem in order to support further and smooth development of PPPM. It is absolutely essential the experts in all fields of medicine, and beyond, are aware of the described problems. The predictions in PPPM and potential preventive actions may very well be compromised if inappropriate modeling is being widely used in numerous cases, let alone the creation of personalized models for an individual patient. There is a great need and potential for fundamental changes in strategies, leading to substantial improvements in future healthcare.",

None of these adverse effects were predicted by animal experiments and prompted the FDA to halt several gene therapy programs in the USA [14, 15]. Hemophilia gene therapy programs were also discontinued in 2004 due to perilous complications such as liver damage which was not predicted in animal studies [15, 16].",

Our efforts in the war against cancer were not encouraging in terms of therapeutic approaches; in fact, it was preventive approaches that showed promising effects. Genetic, molecular, cellular, and immunologic differences between models and human beings made them poor prognostic modalities [4]. False positivity of rodent studies in this case was around 95% [25, 26]. In reality, rodent cancer models is believed to be invalid and financially indefensible [27]. Only 8% success rate in the translation of cancer studies has been reported; actually, 85% of all clinical trials failed before starting phase 3 trials. Among studies which enter phase 3, half of them were withdrawn [28, 29]. Only a little number of these studies are adopted and the others are being withdrawn after sacrificing their victims [7, 30]. Most of the cancer animal models are suffering from inappropriate modeling. Inoculation of malignant cells (cell lines) is the most common current method of malignancy modeling. This model does not reflect the prolonged complex process of developing a malignancy. Recently, knocked out animal models and animal models with special mutations have been introduced [7, 29, 31]; although these models sufficiently mimic genetic background of malignant tumors, the epigenetic role and the role of environment were not reflected in these models. Additionally, there are several probable genotypes for a single phenotype of malignancy.",

The 8th edition of the AJCC tumor, node, and metastase (TNM) breast cancer staging system delivers a flexible platform for prognostic classification based on traditional anatomic factors, which may be modified and enhanced with respect to patient biomarkers and other prognostic panel data. Compared to the previous version, a variety of genetic and molecular factors has been incorporated to the current version, among them are HER2, estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and also multigene panels such as Oncotype DX [35, 36]. There is a difference between \u201csilent\u201d carriers of tumor lesions and patients who are predisposed to disease development and progression; a \u201cfertile\u201d microenvironment that supports the tumorigenesis, tumor invasion, and metastasis can distinguish between them.

That is why a large number of drug discoveries in this field were the result of direct human observations. A large number of current neuropsychiatric medications were initially studied for other diseases and serendipitously discovered by observation of their side effects. For example, amantadine was originally developed to prevent influenza but was found to improve symptoms including tremor, akinesia, and rigidity in people with Parkinson disease [76\u201378]. Chlorpromazine, currently prescribed for its antipsychotic properties, was traditionally introduced as a possible additive to potentiate general anesthesia [79].",

First of all, this model is extremely sensitive to infection; second, SOD-1 mutation is only responsible for less than 3% of the patients, and surprisingly, transgenic mouse which has 23 copies of this gene is known as the standard ALS model in the majority of studies. Conclusively, SOD-1 ALS transgenic models were representative of rare disease forms instead of prevalent mutations. This model represents a very aggressive presentation of ALS which does not respond to almost any treatment except for SOD inhibitors. Thus, current protocols of ALS treatment are a range of broad-spectrum antibiotics and general anti-inflammatory agents. Cochrane database analyses showed that even in the case of riluzole, the sole FDA-approved treatment of ALS, mean survival of the patients increased only up to 2\u20133 months [18].",

            "text": "A brief review of the literature will disclose several so-called animal models of Alzheimer, but a deeper look at Alzheimer models reveals that these models generally cover only one aspect of the complex character of this neurodegenerative disease [93]. A large number of responsible factors have been suggested for developing Alzheimer and among them are aging, inflammation, oxidative stress, vascular abnormalities, and amyloid depositions. Surprisingly, lifestyle, nutrition, education, academic achievements, and even career are also related to Alzheimer development [94\u201396]. Now it is time to ask, how could we synthesize such a complex, chronic, multi-factorial disease of an extremely complex organ (human brain) in a mouse model? Is a transgenic model such as amyloid precursor protein transgenic mouse model a suitable model for human Alzheimer disease [97\u201399]? It has been shown that patients with Down syndrome develop Alzheimer earlier than the normal population due to having three copies of chromosome 21 and hence three copies of amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene. However, does it mean that Alzheimer in Down syndrome is equal to Alzheimer in elderly?! Does an Alzheimer model, which was developed by means of applying a mitochondrial toxin to a rat, is a good representative of Alzheimer in a Nobel laureate? How could we compare cognitive impairment in animals and human beings? We have to change the names of our models. Amyloid precursor protein transgenic mouse model is not an Alzheimer model. It is nothing but three copies of amyloid precursor protein deposition in the brain of a mouse. Conclusively, targeting a single aspect of a multifactorial disease such as Alzheimer will not appropriately model such a multifactorial chronic complex disease. In fact, none of age, oxidative stress, education, and other responsible genes were reflected in APP models of Alzheimer. It seems that in neuroscience, it is inevitable to fade out the stress of primary animal models. Weight of human trials is not comparable with the animal studies. Animal models might be misleading, if we do not revise our models\u2019 names and if not revising the concept of disease modeling instead of risk factor modeling.",

Pretreatment and immediate treatment are prevalent in models, while in the real world, there is almost no pretreatment for MI/stroke. It happens suddenly and generally only hours after the MI/stroke, treatment will start for most of the patients.In experimental studies, the efficacy of treatment in models is evaluated by infarct volume, while the clinical relevance of infarct volume with the patients\u2019 outcome is in doubt. Infarct size has been shown to have a moderate correlation with the patients\u2019 clinical status and outcome [3].Preconditioning is of great importance specially in terms of applying recombinant cell protectors such as EPO; nevertheless, preconditioning has not been modeled in animal models of stroke and MI.Percentage of cells undergo stunning, and the location of the infarct plays a crucial role in clinical presentation and outcome of the patients.
