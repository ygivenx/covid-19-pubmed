As a set of individuals as well as a sub-set of social influence (Axelrod 1997), cultures shapes communication patters among different entities (Centola et al. 2007; Tinsley and Brett 2001). Cultures influence individual\u2019 choices of communication partners, thus drive the formation and differentiation of communication groups over time (McPherson et al. 2001). For example, people tend to interact with others having similar cultural background more frequently than with those who have different cultures (Centola et al. 2007).",

Fewer studies have exclusively explored the nuances of cultures in general, or the formation and differentiation of risk communication based on understanding of the cultural nuances. In addition, compared to the large volume of communication studies in disaster management, lesser volume of studies has explored the cultural tendencies embedded in communication structures in the context. Previous studies tend to focus on minorities\u2019 culture and cultural competency and awareness of majority emergency managers (Bergeron 2014; Renzaho and Oldroyd 2014; Tovar et al. 2014; Mileti 1999; Cross 1989). Therefore, operational definitions of cultures have been limited to certain ethnic, lingual, or racial groups. If not, cultures have been treated as control or contextual variables which are not the main antecedents of emergency response communication, but just something else to have in mind.",

While researchers are studying culture in crisis communication, it is primarily organizational culture or national level culture. For example, Zhu et al. (2017) studied crisis communication response from two multinational corporations in China. Results conclude the need to contextualize the crisis communication with culture is essential for the stakeholder\u2019s perception of specific response strategies and role of influential social media users.

Best practices state emergency managers should incorporate multiple methods of communication to assist residents, visitors, and other stakeholders to prepare for, respond to, recover from, and mitigate for an emergency or disaster (Tinker and Vaughan 2010).",

Specifically, Mary Queen of Vietnam Church mediated critical response and recovery efforts with local, state, national, and international agencies and organizations. Therefore, when compared to other neighboring communities, these residents returned sooner and in greater numbers (Airriess et al. 2008; Leong et al. 2007). While the Catholic Church was the primary religion in many southern Louisiana communities, especially in Lafayette Parish, the past decade has seen a shift from Roman Catholic to Christian.

Yet, the lack of response from local, state, and federal government officials during and after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita reinforced this distrust. Researchers have written about this unethical behavior, especially from New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin, law enforcement officers, Louisiana Governor Kathleen Babineaux Blanco, FEMA Director Michael Brown, and President George W. Bush (Ancelet et al. 2013; Eikenberry et al. 2007; Jurkiewicz 2007, 2009). The level of distrust at the state and local level is shifting. Currently, Governor John Bel Edwards (D) is serving his first term with a 63% approval rating; however, the outgoing republican governor, Governor Jindal, had one of the lowest approval ratings in the state\u2019s history (below 30%) (O\u2019Donoghue 2016).

One of the issues is that local land use plans used outdated flood maps from 1996; therefore, residents were unaware their subdivisions were built in a flood zone and that they needed flood insurance. In fact, approximately 80% of those homes did not have flood insurance (Chiglinsky 2016). Not only do the flood maps need to be updated, they also need to account for climate change. FEMA officials update the flood insurance maps every 5 years, which may not be accounting for the effects of climate change (Joyce 2016). Specific to this case study, model simulations estimate that between 10 and 20% of the precipitation in the Louisiana Flood could be attributed to climate change (van der Wiel, et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2016). Researchers have concluded that the effects of climate change increase the risk of losing diverse cultures and language especially in coastal communities (Adger et al. 2011).",

It is advantageous to use Twitter data streams in investigating communication since the system is designed to support millions of users\u2019 information sharing with open public about ongoing event at any moment around the world (Weng et al. 2013). Twitter stream data is distinctive from other web-based engines. Traditional web search engines are useful to identify user\u2019s intention, desire, wants, or needs. In contrast, Twitter data streams identify users\u2019 actions and thoughts about current events. In addition, with the technological support of the social media platform, the data stream can capture direct interactions among the users, and a user\u2019s information sharing through denotation of other users and reposting other\u2019s initial postings (Bifet et al. 2011). Therefore, the Twitter data\u2014 Twitter contents and interaction behaviors among the users\u2014are useful to examining patterns of human communication behaviors (Weng et al. 2013). This study investigated Twitter data streams from September 9\u201316, 2016, which is 2 weeks after the last date of the flood inundation, August 25, 2016. The time frame is important to observe the disaster response communication. During the time frame, response activities were still underway while the recovery operations were initiated. In addition, during the time, information was shared across stakeholders to make important decisions about the longer-term response and attempting to return all system back to their normal state. Therefore, the observation period allowed evaluating specific communication behaviors and actions of stakeholders emerged during the longer-term response phase.",

Group 3 has both strong out-going and in-coming ties from group 2. Group 3 also receives ties from all other major groups. Group 4 and 5 have mutual ties with group 2 and 3, but they only receive ties from group 1. This inter-group communication structure indicates that groups 2 and 3 bridge communication across the major clusters through their mutual group communication, as well as each of their connections with all other groups. In particular, groups 2 and 3 bridge communication among groups 1, 4, and 5. Figure 2 summarizes information of inter-group communication among the top five groups.\n",

For instance, realtime data directly collected from social media overtime provides first responders with an opportunity to assess whether cultures embedded in local community matter in facilitating communications with key stakeholders such as local governments and nonprofits via social media. Also, social network analysis with social media datasets can allow practitioners to identify the most influential stakeholders and keywords as needs of affected communities over time (Jung et al. 2017). The application of a webometric approach as a method of social network analysis with social media datasets will be critically considered as a smart big-board which exactly identify dominant cultures of key stakeholders\u2019 communications, which helps an organization respond to an unexpected event and develop communication strategies.As with any case study, there are limitations and recommendations for future research. First, researchers often criticize single-case study designs for lacking external validity because the study results are harder to generalize to larger populations. Sobeck (2003) and Yin (1994), among other scholars, make the argument that case study research is attempting to create analytic, and not statistical, generalizations. Future research should replicate the data collection and analysis methodology to study culture in other disasters, such as the recent 2016 disasters: Korean Earthquake, San Jose Flood, and Fort Lauderdale Airport Shooting. Second, researchers in this case study collected the Twitter data for dates following the disaster. Similar to the study on Twitter use before, during, and after Superstorm Sandy (Jacques and Knox 2016), a future study could expand the Twitter data collection to capture cultural communications throughout the disaster.",
