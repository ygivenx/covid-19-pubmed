            "text": "Coagulation is the formation of a blood clot. Coagulation is a highly ordered process that involves three components (endothelial cells, platelets and coagulation factors) in a sequential action of primary hemostasis, secondary hemostasis and fibrinolysis.21 Typically, coagulation is initiated by an injury to the vascular endothelial cells (ECs) (Figure 1b). Primary hemostasis is characterized by platelets that bind to injured and/or activated ECs and the immediate formation of a platelet plug (Figure 1c). Secondary coagulation has two separate initial pathways, the contact activation pathway (intrinsic pathway) and the tissue factor (TF) pathway (extrinsic pathway) (Figures 1d and e). Both pathways result in the production of factor X, which induces thrombin and the formation of fibrin strands to strengthen the platelet plug and form a stable platelet\u2013fibrin clot (Figures 1f and g). The coagulation process is tightly controlled by anticoagulants, which can limit the clot to avoid thrombus propagation, and fibrinolysis, which is responsible for the degradation of the platelet\u2013fibrin clot as the wound heals (Figures 1a and h).",

Once activated or injured, ECs initiate coagulation by activating platelets and the expression of coagulation components, as well as by down-regulating physiological anticoagulant components and suppressing fibrinolytic activity55 (Figure 1b). At the same time, the activation of ECs can result in an increase in local blood circulation, localized plasma leakage and the recruitment and activation of leukocytes to promote inflammation.56, 57 IAV can directly and/or indirectly induce EC activation and vascular hyperpermeability (Figure 2a). Certain IAV subtypes, such as H3N2 and H5N1, may infect lung endothelial cells, which also express \u03b12, 6-linked sialic acid and are adjacent to the primary target cells of the respiratory epithelia. Recognition of damage-associated molecular patterns, such as HMGB1 or oxidized phospholipids via TLR4, also activates ECs to drive lung injury.53, 58, 59 Direct stimulation of TLR3 by viral RNA results in the upregulation of TF and the downregulation of thrombomodulin in endothelial cells.60 Human IAV has been reported to induce pulmonary microvascular leakage through the degradation of the tight junction protein claudin-5.61\nIn vivo, D-dimer and tissue fibrin deposition are elevated.60",

Platelets are major pro-inflammatory cells under inflammatory conditions.71, 74, 75, 76, 77 Upon activation, platelets change from smooth discs to spiny spheres and rapidly release inflammatory and coagulatory mediators stored in their granules and express a number of receptors for adhesion and clotting molecules.77 The interaction of P-selectin on activated platelets and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand expressed on neutrophils leads to the activation of neutrophils in the circulation and the redistribution of Mac-1 and CXCR2, which guide neutrophil intravascular crawling and transmigration and the initiation of inflammation (Figure 2e).69 Such platelet\u2013neutrophil aggregates contribute to a variety of inflammatory settings, including acute lung injury, acute hepatic injury, sepsis and atherosclerosis.78, 79, 80 Platelet\u2013neutrophil aggregation is also responsible for the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by neutrophils, modulating the phagocytic capacity of neutrophils and the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (webs of extracellular DNA and histones).79, 80 Activated platelets also interact with T cells, B cells, NK cells, dendritic cells (DCs) and monocytes and induce their homing, activation and recruitment, and cytokine release (Figure 2e).81 More importantly, the cytokines and chemokines released from the activated platelets, including CD40L, IL-1\u03b2, CCL5, CXCL4, CXCL7 and TGF-\u03b2, are profoundly involved in the modulation of endothelial cell function, leukocyte trafficking and immune response (Figure 2c).81 For example, CD40L, released from activated platelets, can activate CD40 on endothelial cells to upregulate ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin and P-selectin and to release IL-6, MCP-1, CCL2 and TF, thereby promoting leukocyte recruitment to lesions and immune activation.82, 83, 84",

Inflammation caused by IAV infection causes disruption of the vessel walls that exposes TF to the circulation.33, 65 ECs and monocytes begin producing TF in response to various pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 and MCP-1) and pathogen-associated molecular pattern (such as viral RNA).60, 99 The coagulation cascade is initiated quickly once TF has been exposed to the blood (Figure 1d). The activated coagulation cascade generates thrombin protease (factor IIa), which converts fibrinogen into fibrin (Figure 1f). Thrombin is involved in the feedback activation of coagulation by activating coagulation factors V, VIII, XI and XIII (Figures 1e and f). As one of the strongest platelet activators, thrombin also induces platelet aggregation and clot formation.100 Furthermore, fibrinogen and fibrin also activate macrophages and cytokine production through TLR4.101, 102",

Treatment with a recombinant inhibitor of the FVIIa/TF complex attenuates the pro-inflammatory response and prolongs survival rates in a rhesus monkey model of Ebola hemorrhagic fever.103 The pro-inflammatory function of coagulation factors is mediated through their activation of PARs (PAR-1, -2, -3 and -4), which are mainly expressed in platelets and other cell types, including ECs, macrophages, mast cells, eosinophils, myocytes and gastrointestinal and bronchial epithelial cells.19, 89, 104 PAR-1, -3 and -4 are activated by thrombin, whereas PAR-2 is activated by FVIIa and FXa but not by thrombin. PAR-1 is also responsible for FXa signaling.19 PAR signaling activates ECs, platelets and leukocytes to express pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and increases the permeability of ECs and the adhesion and chemotaxis of leukocytes (Figure 2b).19 The TF/thrombin/PAR-1 pathway promotes the deleterious innate inflammatory response to an influenza virus infection in mice.89, 104 PAR-2 plays both a protective and a pathogenic role in response to an H1N1 infection.105, 106 The activation of PAR-4 exacerbates acute lung injury, inflammation and death through platelet activation and a PAR-4 antagonist (pepducin p4pal-10) protects mice during influenza virus infection.20 Taken together, these results suggest that coagulation factors mainly play pathogenic roles through PAR-1 and PAR-4, which may serve as therapeutic targets against IAV infection.",

The proteolytic cleavage of HA by trypsin-like proteases in the respiratory tract can process the HA precursor protein into two disulfide bond-linked subunits, HA1 and HA2. This is an essential step in the life cycle and is required for IAV infectivity.134 Influenza viruses use the conversion of plasminogen into plasmin, and the latter possesses a trypsin-like protease activity to cleave HA (Figure 3b).135, 136 Moreover, mini-plasmin, which is generated by the sequential processing of plasminogen by a plasminogen activator and elastases, has been found in the epithelial cells of the bronchioles and is reported to process HA.137 The accumulation of mini-plasmin in the cerebral capillaries has also been implicated in influenza encephalitis.138, 139 Therefore, plasminogen-dependent cleavage of HA is used by influenza viruses to increase their replication rates and infectivity (Figure 3b). On the other hand, the binding of NA of the influenza virus A/WSN/33 to plasminogen helps to sequestrate plasminogen on the cell surface and increases the cleavage of HA. This further helps in the dissemination of the virus and the efficient replication of IAV in the brains of mice.135, 136 Binding of plasminogen to NA seems to rely on the unique sequence motif of the WSN strain.135 The activation of plasminogen also helps with the replication of other influenza virus strains in an NA-independent fashion. In this case, annexin II of the host cell binds to plasminogen and activates HA cleavage.134, 140, 141 Moreover, viral HA itself seems to be able to recruit plasminogen for HA cleavage.142 Bacterial staphylokinase can activate plasminogen to plasmin and thereby induce cleavage of HA of the MS96 (H9N2) virus. This mechanism may partly explain why bacterial infection can enhance influenza infectivity.143",

The activated ECs and platelets first produce pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that enhance inflammatory cell infiltration and increase vascular permeability. Platelets are further activated under these circumstances. Second, coagulation factors are activated, which further augment the inflammation via PARs on ECs, platelets and leukocytes. Third, the expression of anticoagulant components decreases as the ECs are activated.

Activated platelets release a number of mediators, such as ADP and vWF stores within their granules, leading to further platelet recruitment, activation, aggregation and plug formation, which is a process termed primary hemostasis. (d) The interaction between TF and factor VII initiates the extrinsic pathway. (e) The exposure of collagen to blood starts the intrinsic pathway.
