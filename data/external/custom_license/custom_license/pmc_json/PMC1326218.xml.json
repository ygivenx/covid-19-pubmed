Although the worst outbreaks have resulted in only several hundred deaths worldwide [3\u20136], the filoviruses are considered a significant global health threat, because as the reservoir remains unknown, the pathogen is extremely deadly and highly infectious by aerosol, and there is anecdotal evidence that the use of both MARV and EBOV were explored as potential biowarfare agents in the offensive program of the former Soviet Union [7\u201310]. The filoviruses are relatively simple viruses of 19-Kb genomes and consist of seven genes which encode nucleoprotein (NP), glycoprotein, four smaller viral proteins (VPs) (VP24, VP30, VP35, and VP40), and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L protein), all in a single strand of negative-sensed RNA [11].",

Although there has been significant progress toward vaccine development via demonstration of protection in nonhuman primates from EBOV illness and death [12,13], a vaccine will not fulfill all requirements for EBOV countermeasures. Administration of type I interferons, therapeutic vaccines, immune globulins, ribavirin, and other nucleoside analogues have been somewhat successful in rodent EBOV models, but all failed to benefit EBOV-infected nonhuman primates [1,14,15]. EBOV frequently causes severe disseminated intravascular coagulation, and administration of a recombinant clotting inhibitor was recently shown to protect 33% of rhesus monkeys [16]. It appears that host-directed consequence management of the disease alone may not be sufficient, and an additional well-orchestrated sequence-specific attack on viral replication may be more effective as a successful anti-filovirus treatment regimen.",

Since then, remarkable progress has been made by modifying oligonucleotides to increase their stability, affinity, and delivery into cells [19]. Phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs) are a subclass of antisense agents modified to include a phosphorodiamidate linkage and morpholine ring, and exhibit limited off-target effects, favorable base stacking, high duplex stability, high solubility, cell permeability, and no hybridization complexities [20,21]. Formation of a PMO:mRNA duplex can effectively block translation of viral RNA, thereby inhibiting viral replication [22,23]. Antisense PMO are effective as antivirals against vesiviruses [24], flaviviruses [23,25], and the SARS coronavirus [26]. The successful inhibition of viral replication by PMOs in these reports was demonstrated in vitro, but has not yet been shown in an animal model.",

In order to test our hypothesis, PMOs were designed to inhibit translation of the mRNAs for EBOV VP35, VP24, and L (Figure 1A). These EBOV-specific PMOs demonstrated sequence-specific inhibition when compared with a PMO molecule with a MARV-specific sequence or PMOs containing EBOV-scrambled sequences in a reporter-based in vitro translation assay (Figure 1B\u20131D). No inhibition was observed for the scrambled or nonspecific PMO at up to 10 \u03bcM concentration for the EBOV VP24, VP35, or L RNA targets (Figure 1B\u20131D). To determine whether the EBOV-specific PMOs could reduce viral propagation in vitro, VeroE6 cells were pretreated with the PMOs at a concentration of 20 \u03bcM and then infected with a multiplicity of infection of 1. Treatment with the EBOV VP24-, VP35-, or L-specific PMO was able to consistently reduce the viral titers in the EBOV-infected VeroE6 cells (Figure 1E). A combination of the three PMOs also reduced the viral titers in the VeroE6 cells, but did not show an enhanced effect as compared with treatment with any one of the PMOs (Figure 1E). In the same assay, the viral titers in the scrambled PMO-treated cells were nearly identical to those observed in untreated VeroE6 cells, and the PMOs did not cause obvious cytotoxicity at concentrations used in this assay (unpublished data).",

            "text": "To evaluate the in vivo efficacy of the EBOV-specific PMOs, we first determined the survival of mice treated with individual PMOs at 24 h and 4 h before challenge with 1,000 plaque-forming units (pfu) of mouse-adapted EBOV. The three PMOs exhibited a wide range of efficacy against lethal EBOV infection. Both the VP24- and VP35-specific PMOs provided nearly complete protection when the mice were pretreated twice with 500 \u03bcg doses (Figure 2A\u20132B, p < 0.001 for both VP24 and VP35 PMO treatment versus PBS treatment). In contrast, and despite its strong activity in the cell-free translation assay, the L-specific PMO conferred survival to ~30% of treated mice at the 500-\u03bcg dose (Figure 2C, p = 0.5 for both doses of the L PMO compared with PBS-treated mice). As expected, treatment of the mice with a Marburg-specific VP24, VP35, or L PMO did not provide protection against EBOV (Figure 2A\u20132C). Next, we investigated whether a combination of all these PMOs could further enhance efficacy. We found that when the VP24-, VP35-, and L-specific PMOs were administered together at 24 h and 4 h before lethal EBOV challenge, this resulted in robust protection at all the doses tested (Figure 2D, p = 0.00001, 0.001, and 0.0136, respectively, for the 500-, 50-, and 5-\u03bcg EBOV-specific PMO-treated mice compared with the PBS-treated mice). To investigate the usefulness of the PMO in a post-exposure regimen, mice were treated with a single dose of the three PMOs administered 24 h after EBOV infection (Figure 2E). The PMO-treated EBOV-infected mice were fully protected at the 500-\u03bcg doses, and at lower doses the post-challenge treatment provided enhanced protection (p = 0.00001, 0.0136, and 0.2105, respectively, for the 500-, 50-, and 5-\u03bcg PMO-treated mice compared with the PBS-treated mice). Mice receiving a single PMO treatment 4 h before infection showed similar protection (p = 0.00001, 0.237, and 1.0, respectively, for the 500-, 50-, and 5-\u03bcg PMO-treated mice compared with the PBS-treated mice). Here, a single dose of PMO at 24 hpi was used and, at the highest concentration, the combination of PMOs completely protected EBOV-infected mice. In this single-dose therapeutic regimen, the lower PMO dosages did not provide complete protection. It may be possible that repeated injections of lower concentrations of EBOV-specific PMOs could provide equivalent protection to fewer administrations of higher amounts. Importantly, multiple injections (n > 5) of nonspecific PMOs did not enhance survival of EBOV-infected rodents (unpublished data).",

Rhesus monkeys were treated with the VP35 PMO only (n = 4) or a combination of the VP24, VP35, and L PMOs (n = 4) from 2 d prior to EBOV infection through day 9 of the infection (Figure 6A). An initial study tested the efficacy of the VP35 PMO, the compound that exhibited the highest activity in mice. Unfortunately, all of the VP35 PMO-treated monkeys, as well as the untreated control monkey, died within the time-to-death expected for EBOV-infected rhesus macaques (days 7, 7, 8, 8, and 7, respectively). In contrast, treatment of rhesus macaques with a combination of the VP24, VP35, and L PMOs showed substantial efficacy. Two PMO-treated monkeys survived the EBOV challenge with few clinical signs beyond mild depression from days 6\u20139 (Figure 6B). A third PMO-treated monkey cleared the EBOV infection and remained aviremic from days 9\u201314 (Figure 6C), but died of a severe bacterial infection, with no evidence of ongoing EBOV infection, on day 16 (Figure 6B, unpublished data). The fourth PMO-treated monkey succumbed to EBOV infection on day 10 (Figure 6B). Three na\u00efve control monkeys used in this experiment received no treatment and succumbed to EBOV infection on days 7, 9, and 10. Since the VP35 PMO alone did not provide any protection to nonhuman primates, these data suggest that a combination of PMOs is more efficacious than a single-target PMO treatment and also suggests that protection in the combination PMO-treated monkeys is not due to nonspecific effects of PMO administration.",

Our current studies indicate the effectiveness of PMOs targeted to specific EBOV mRNAs against in vitro, rodent, and nonhuman primate EBOV infections. The data presented here are in line with our working hypothesis that a combination of PMOs that target multiple viral genes can slow EBOV replication, allowing enough time for development of antiviral immune responses and viral clearance.",

While the reporter-based in vitro assays appeared to be good indicators of sequence-specific activity of PMOs, it seems that in the case of EBOV, the in vitro translation assays were not fully predictive of the rodent efficacy data. Using VeroE6 cells we showed that EBOV replication was moderately suppressed in cells treated with EBOV-specific PMOs. However, no visible difference was observed when comparing the ability of a single PMO and the combination of three PMOs to reduce viral growth. The PMOs used in these studies were not conjugated with peptides that facilitate cellular uptake. We have observed lower cellular uptake of naked PMOs compared with peptide-conjugated PMOs by Vero E6 cells (unpublished data), and this may explain the moderate inhibition observed in the in vitro replication assay. Nonetheless, the data summarized in Figure 1 clearly indicate the feasibility of specific gene targeting by unconjugated PMO and the favorable antiviral activity of these compounds.",

We hypothesize that the efficacy of this strategy relies on the ability of PMOs, by reducing viral replication, to create a window of opportunity for the immune system to clear the otherwise lethal infection. This approach does not result in sterile protection, as evidenced by the robust anti-EBOV immune responses in the surviving mice and nonhuman primates, and by the mild clinical signs (thrombocytopenia, liver enzyme elevations, depression, and lethargy) observed in the PMO-treated monkeys. It is likely that successful treatment of patients infected with EBOV will require a multifaceted approach consisting of an antiviral, and therapeutics for symptom and disease management [1,9].",

            "text": "Post-exposure treatment with PMOs was the most efficacious against EBOV in rodents, and, presumably, this is explained by the pharmacokinetic properties of PMO. Following parenteral injection, PMOs are cleared from the bloodstream within hours, but accumulate and remain within tissues such as spleen and liver for days (unpublished data). By administering PMO after challenge, it is likely that higher concentrations were available in the circulation and tissues during the peak of viral replication. Thus, the PMOs may have been able to reduce amplification of EBOV during this critical timeframe, allowing development of appropriate host immune responses to the otherwise lethal viral infection [27\u201329]. Since effective treatment seemed to require critical timing of PMO administration, and nonhuman primates are highly sensitive to EBOV infection, we decided to both pretreat and administer daily doses of PMOs after viral challenge in the proof-of-concept nonhuman primate studies. While short-term stability in vivo is an unfavorable property for a potential therapeutic, it should be noted that for a deadly acute infection that has only a short period of treatment in the clinic, repeated administration of a life-saving drug is entirely feasible. Along these lines, future studies may show that the pharmacokinetics of PMO can be enhanced by other modifications or alternative routes of administration or regimen to improve efficacy.",

While the mouse model has several differences in pathogenesis compared with EBOV infection of nonhuman primates and humans [31\u201333], it is widely accepted as an appropriate model for rapid testing of potential antivirals before proceeding to NHP trials. While the differences in the pathology may severely hamper the predictive value of mouse studies using therapeutic strategies that rely on targeting mouse-specific virus\u2013host interaction or the pathologic response by rodents, interventions that target viral replication can be evaluated with a high degree of confidence in this model. Antiviral efficacy in rodents may not always be predictive of efficacy in nonhuman primates, although an antiviral compound that is unsuccessful in rodents will most likely also fail in nonhuman primates, justifying initial screening in rodent models.",

Future studies will focus on determining the most favorable PMO dose and regimen and also the therapeutic potential of these molecules. Additionally, antisense PMO designed to target other regions within the EBOV genome will be pursued. Genetically designed microbial therapeutics, such as antisense PMOs or other sequence-based approaches, allow quick hit-to-lead optimization and may accelerate time-to-drug development. Together, these strategies could result in a highly efficacious therapeutic treatment regimen for lethal viral infections. Nucleotide-based antivirals, such as PMOs, can be easily produced in large quantities, have already been tested in human clinical trials, and have appropriate safety profiles for use with humans [34].

Levels of EBOV-specific antibodies were determined from serum or plasma samples, as previously described [39]. Antibody titers were defined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution giving a net optical density value \u22650.2. Epitopes recognized by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells of surviving mice were determined as previously described [40]. Briefly, EBOV-specific responses were analyzed by culturing splenocytes with 1\u20135 \u03bcg overlapping 15-residue peptides representing the GP or VP40 of EBOV (Mimotopes, Clayton, Victoria, Australia) or 25 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and 1.25 \u03bcg/ml ionomycin in complete RPMI containing 10 \u03bcg/ml brefeldin A. After 5 h of culture, the cells were stained with anti-CD44, -CD8, or -CD4 (Pharmingen, San Diego, California, United States) in brefeldin A. After the cell surface staining, the cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde, permeabilized with saponin, and stained with anti-IFN-\u03b3 PE (Pharmingen).",

Plasmids containing 150 nucleotides encompassing the PMO target area from EBOV VP24, VP35, or L fused to firefly luciferase were used to generate RNA.
