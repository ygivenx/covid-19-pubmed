However, severe hypoxemia with profuse lung infiltrates occurred on the next day. Even under broad-spectrum empirical antibiotics (imipenem with cilastatin sodium and vancomycin), she still developed signs of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS): persistent shock, hypoxemia, and acute DIC (D-dimer 5510 ng/ml, prothrombin time (PT) 15.5 s, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 50.3 s). A surge in serum concentrations of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) was also observed. A combination therapy of recombinant human activated protein C (rhAPC, 24 \u03bcg\u00b7kg\u00b7h continuous IV for 96 h) and pulsed methylprednisolone (500 mg daily IV for 3 days) was administered. The levels of cytokines reduced rapidly and oxygenation and, thrombocytopenia improved from the 72nd h of therapy onwards. Of particular note, coagulopathy improved within 48 h after initiating therapy and returned to normal range 48 h after therapy completion (PT 12.2 s, aPTT 30.9 s). Finally, the analysis of sputum, urine, catheter tips, blood, and serologic tests for common and atypical pathogens during these episodes were all negative. Without residual organ-system dysfunction, she was discharged from hospital 2 months later.",

Although corticosteroid has been cited as an important therapy for SARS [2], some SARS patients experienced rebound of fever during step-down of corticosteroid and required subsequent rescue pulse steroid therapy [3, 4]. Cytokine overproduction has been known to induce tissue damage, acute DIC, MODS, and death [5]. In this patient, hypercytokinemia was associated with the relapse of SARS upon tapering corticosteroid. Although in this particular patient we successfully reversed acute DIC-associated MODS using a combination of pulse corticosteroid and a novel drug with immunomodulatory and anticoagulant effects, rhAPC, further controlled trials are strongly recommended to clarify the standard of care for avoiding disease relapse and associated catastrophic complications.",
