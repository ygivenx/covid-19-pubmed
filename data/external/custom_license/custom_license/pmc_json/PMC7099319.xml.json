This outcome is believed to be due in part to exposure of the allograft to the external environment. Inhalation of environmental agents such as infectious organisms can be a trigger for immunologically mediated, deleterious effects on lung function. The community-acquired respiratory viruses (CARVs) such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), influenza A and B (Flu), adenovirus (ADV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), coronavirus, and rhinovirus (RV) are increasingly recognized as important pathogens in lung transplant recipients [1\u20135].",

Viral infections generate direct cytopathic damage to lung epithelium and provoke indirect injury through the stimulation of inflammatory cytokines and T cell activation [6\u2022]. This alloreactive response to viral infection can lead to substantial morbidity and mortality in lung transplant recipients. The development of potent antiviral agents, sensitive molecular techniques for the detection of infection, and comprehensive management strategies is paramount to reducing complications from CARVs following lung transplantation. This review discusses the individual pathogens, the incidence of disease, the role of new diagnostic techniques, treatment regimens for established viral infections, prevention strategies, and the potential impact of CARVs on acute and chronic allograft rejection.",

Standards for diagnostic tests include the immunofluorescent antibody assay (DFA) and respiratory culture performed on nasal wash, nasal swab, or BAL specimens [2, 6\u2022, 16]. Compared to pediatric patients, the yield obtained from upper respiratory tract samples in adults may be inferior due to decreased viral burden or shedding in the nasal passages [2, 11]. Analysis by BAL has been shown to improve the sensitivity of results [2]. Viral culture can also take many days for a positive result to return which delays initiation of antiviral therapy and risks transmission of illness to other immunosuppressed patients. These older forms of testing typically identify fewer numbers of the CARVs. Newer tests such as rapid respiratory viral culture (RRV) and antigen detection (EIA) allow for faster and more precise results [17]. At the present time, however, no commercially available antigen detection kits exist for rhinovirus and coronavirus.",

A review of the 2009 Australian H1N1 pandemic in lung transplant recipients revealed an overall incidence of 3 % (24 patients), with allograft dysfunction in 75 % and death in 21 % [19]. Current antiviral therapy for FLU is directed against proteins contained in the viral envelope. The amantanes or M2 inhibitors consisting of amantadine and rimantidine, block ion channels within the membrane. Unfortunately, efficacy for this class of drugs is limited due to the rapid development of antiviral resistance and the lack of effect against FLU-B [3, 20].",

The inhaled form of this medication should be used with caution in patients with serious preexisting respiratory disease due to the potential side effects of cough, bronchospasm, and even death. If inhaled zanamivir is contraindicated, then an intravenous form has been approved for use in emergency situations. Intravenous peramivir is also only approved under an emergency use authorization. Similar to the M2 inhibitors, immunocompromised patients have been shown to have higher resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors possibly due to prolonged viral shedding leading to selection of resistant strains [21].

Although there is limited data for treating RSV following lung transplantation [13] many experts recommend administration of inhaled ribavirin, IVIG, methylprednisolone, and palivizumab [4, 11, 13, 25]. Vilchez et al. reported a decrease in the incidence of post-RSV BOS to 15 % with the use of inhaled ribavirin [3] compared to an incidence of 32 % in those without therapy [1]. Another study in hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients with RSV pneumonia revealed a mortality of 31 % with combination therapy (IVIG, steroids, ribavirin, and palivizumab) versus 100 % in those who were untreated or experienced a delay in treatment [5]. The exact mechanism of action of ribavirin is unclear. The drug is a synthetic nucleoside analog which may interfere with the expression of viral mRNA and proteins at the translatory level. It may also be incorporated into the RSV RNA viral genome and lead to \u201clethal mutagenesis\u201d [13].

Multiple studies have described an association of hMPV infection to acute rejection (AR) with incidences up to 63 % [32]. As a more recently recognized CARV, treatment options for hMPV are less well studied. No specific therapy for hMPV exists, but ribavirin has been shown to have in vitro activity against the virus consistent with other members of the Paramyxoviridae family. Published case reports indicate successful treatment of hMPV with intravenous ribavirin monotherapy or in conjunction with IVIG and steroids in lung transplant recipients [34]. Novel research evaluating the possibility of synthetic, interference RNAs (RNAi) as therapeutic agents against hMPV demonstrated complete inhibition of viral replication in vitro and partial inhibition in a murine model [35].",

Investigational trials in immunocompetent adults revealed a shorter time to alleviation of illness and decreased frequency of positive cultures from nasal secretions with treatment [39]. Reports of utilization of pleconaril in lung transplant recipients with rhinoviral pneumonia are limited and proof of its efficacy is still lacking [40].

Several other retrospective studies, however, have supported an association between CARVs and chronic rejection [1\u20133, 7, 8, 11, 33, 41, 46]. A review of cohort studies by Vilchez et al. in 2003 reported that the rate of BOS following CARV infection in lung transplant recipients ranges from 32\u201350 % depending on the type of virus [3]. Billings et al. suggested that recipients with LRTIs due to a CARV had a relative risk of 2.3 for developing high-grade BOS and that recipients infected within the first six months post-transplant were more likely to acquire high-grade BOS [1]. Further support for an independent connection between CARV infection and BOS was published in a 2004, retrospective study by Khalifah et al. [8]. This analysis indicated that CARV infection after lung transplantation doubled the risk of developing BOS stage 1 and if it was a LRTI the risk of subsequent progression to BOS was tripled.",

            "text": "Current prospective analyses also provide inconsistent data for the relationship between CARV infection and BOS in lung transplant recipients. A multicenter study by Milstone et al., which predominantly followed patients with URTIs for one year post respiratory infection, did not find a difference in the rates of BOS development between infected and non-infected recipients with RSV or PIV [9]. In contrast, a single-center investigation by Gottlieb et al. with 40.8 % of patients exhibiting LRTI-symptoms, indicated that symptomatic CARV infections increased the probability for new onset of BOS, but not progression. Risk was particularly increased following PIV infection [47\u2022]. A third prospective analysis which evaluated up to nineteen CARVs over a three-year period post-infection reported a 62 % incidence of BOS I at one year [6\u2022].",

            "text": "Lung transplant recipients are frequently exposed to CARVs. These viruses are becoming increasingly recognized as an important cause of morbidity and mortality in lung transplant recipients. Both upper and lower respiratory tract infections have been shown to occur with all of the CARVs and newer, highly sensitive diagnostic techniques have led to improvements in the diagnostic accuracy of results. Although studies evaluating the impact of CARVs on short and long term allograft function are heterogenous and have various limitations, the majority of the investigations support a direct relationship between AR and CARV infection. This also supports an association between CARV infection and BOS since AR is an established risk factor for BOS. At the present time, proven treatment for CARV infection in lung transplant recipients is extremely limited. Combination therapy with ribavirin has been reported to have activity against RSV, PIV, hMPV, and ADV. Alternative medications for the treatment of Paramyxoviridae infection as well as FLU, ADV, and RV are in development. Further insight into disease pathogenesis of CARV infections through future prospective studies is warranted in order to hasten the implementation of novel management strategies and decrease the risk of BOS which is the major cause of long-term graft failure in lung transplant recipients.",
