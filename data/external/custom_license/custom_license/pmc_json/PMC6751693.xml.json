            "text": "Detection and sensing of viruses, pollutants,\nand other related\nproteins have received much attention with the Zika and MERS outbursts\nin recent years.1\u22125 To be considered a good detection and sensing platform, stability\nand detection sensitivity as well as ease of use and maintenance should\nbe guaranteed.6,7 There are several careful studies\nof paper-based sensing membranes that provide a cheap and convenient\noption for virus/pollutant detection.8\u221212 To date, a large number of novel paper-based sensing\ntechnologies, including nanoparticle-based and electronic-based sensors,\nhave been developed to increase detection sensitivity.13\u221216 However, many of these technologies require a significant amount\nof detection time, function only under certain storage conditions\nand are quite often expensive. As alternatives to these high technology\nsensing platforms, colorimetric and immunosensors are still popular\nin clinical use.17\u221219 These immunosensors are based on immobilized capturing\nantibodies, and virus particles/antigens captured on antibodies were\ndetected by detection antibodies.20,21 Colorimetric/immunosensing\nplatforms are widely used in various viruses, antigens, and pollutant\ndetection systems; however, most of the studies of these paper-based\nsensors focus on detection sensitivity and not stability or storage\nconditions.22\u221224 In addition, a large number of paper-based sensing\nmembrane systems have adopted chemically treated membranes to enhance\nprotein/antibody adsorption and stability,25\u221227 but comparative\nstudies of protein stability and detection sensitivity on different\npaper-based membranes are rare. To verify the stability of printed\nproteins on paper-based membranes and to fill the gaps in research,\nwe conducted systematic studies of protein stability and sensitivity\non three different paper-based membranes. We also conducted long-term\nmonitoring of printed proteins/antibodies on paper-based platforms\nwith varying storage temperature conditions to identify an optimal\nstoring period and temperature for printed proteins.",

            "text": "We\nfirst tested whether inkjet-printed proteins on a paper-based\nmembrane are functional. We focused on maintenance of functional ability\nof printed HRP and structural integrity of printed PSMA and TNF-\u03b1\nproteins. Varying concentrations of anti-IgG HRP antibodies (1\u2013100\n\u03bcg/mL) were printed on printing paper and nitrocellulose and\nPVDF membranes, and the HRP substrate was added to detect signals\nfrom the printed antibodies (Figure 1A). As low as 1 \u03bcg/mL of printed IgG-HRP antibodies\ncan be detected on paper-based membranes (Figure 1B,C), which suggests that piezo inkjet printing\ndoes not induce changes or damage to the function of printed antibodies.\nThe concentration of the anti-IgG-HRP antibody versus the chemiluminescence\nsignal intensity from the printed IgG-HRP plot showed a linear relationship,\nwith R-squared values of 0.952, 0.931, and 0.946\nfor printing paper, nitrocellulose membrane, and PVDF membrane, respectively\n(Figure 1C). These\ndata suggest that the signal intensity from printed IgG-HRP is a good\nreflection of the concentration of IgG-HRP. IgG-HRP-printed printing\npaper and nitrocellulose and PVDF membranes were stored at three different\ntemperature conditions: r.t. (\u223c22 \u00b0C), 4, and \u221220\n\u00b0C, to test the effect of storage temperature on printed protein\nfunctionality and stability. Chemiluminescence signal intensities\nfrom printed IgG-HRP antibodies on printing paper and nitrocellulose\nand PVDF membranes showed less than 10% variation, which suggests\nthat the binding capacity of the three paper-based membranes tested\nare quite similar. The HRP signal from printed IgG-HRP on printing\npaper decreased rapidly during the initial 5 days when stored at r.t.\nHowever, 4 and \u221220 \u00b0C significantly increased printed\nprotein stability, and the signal intensity from HRP remained >50%\nup to 60 days. Signals from printed HRP on printing paper can be detected\nup to 180 days when stored at \u221220 \u00b0C. These data suggest\nthat storing temperature is critical in maintaining printed protein\nfunctionalities. However, when the same protein was printed on the\nnitrocellulose membrane, the signal intensity from HRP dropped rapidly\nover the first 2 days, regardless of storage temperature (Figure 2C). Although protein\nmolecules bind to nitrocellulose membranes through hydrophobic interactions,\nprinted proteins on nitrocellulose membranes lose functionality in\na very short amount of time. IgG-HRP antibodies printed on PVDF also\nshowed significant signal intensity drops over the first 5 days; however,\nsignals from HRP can be detected up to 6 months when stored at 4 and\n\u221220 \u00b0C.",

Although signals\nfrom anti-PSMA-HRP and anti-TNF-\u03b1 HRP were lower compared to\nthe directly printed IgG-HRP antibody, printed PSMA and TNF-\u03b1\nwere still detected when printed on all three paper-based membranes.\nSignal intensities from the detection antibody were highest on printing\npaper followed by PVDF and nitrocellulose membrane; however, they\ndid not show a linear relationship with the concentration of printed\nPSMA and TNF-\u03b1 (Figure 3C,D). These data may suggest that the signal intensities from\ncolorimetric/immunosensors may not exactly reflect the actual concentration\nof antigens. We again tested whether printed proteins can be detected\nby detection antibodies after storage at various storage temperatures.\nIt took \u223c3 days for signals to be reduced to half of the initial\nintensity from printed proteins on printing paper (Figure 3A,D). Storage temperatures\nhave a minimal effect on signal intensity in the first 3 days; however,\nstoring at \u221220 \u00b0C increases printed protein stability\nafter 7 days of storage.",
