Virus culture has long been the \u201cgold standard\u201d and can detect a wide range of viruses, including previously unknown viruses. It also confirms that what is detected is viable. Culture is, however, labour-intensive and slow to produce results. Likewise, serology to detect antibody response to infection may only produce positive results up to two weeks after infection. These two techniques, therefore, have little routine diagnostic value, as most infections will have resolved before the results are available [1, 5]. Immunofluorescence/antigen detection tests can allow rapid detection but are subjective, rely on the experience of investigators and lack sensitivity [1, 5].",
