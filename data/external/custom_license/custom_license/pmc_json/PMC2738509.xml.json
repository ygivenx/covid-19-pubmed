Patients were under the routine care of one or more of the authors, each an experienced senior academic infectious diseases pediatrician. All diagnoses of DHF/DSS in infants conformed to World Health Organization case definitions. In Bangkok, serum samples from all infants and children hospitalized for DHF were sent for routine diagnostic study to the Virology Department, Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences (AFRIMS). For nearly 30 years, AFRIMS has provided such dengue diagnostic services to Bangkok Children\u2019s Hospital. Similar routine diagnostic tests were provided for infants and children admitted to Children\u2019s Hospital, Yangon, by the Virology Department, Department of Medical Research. Fiscal constraints limited the number of serologic tests performed. Individual data were disassociated from any identifiers and are presented here only in aggregate.",

Primary and secondary DHF infections are reconciled in a long-standing explanatory hypothesis linking severe disease to actively or passively acquired antibodies (4,8,18). In our study, infants constituted approximately 5% of total DHF/DSS patients, lower than the nearly 10% reported from Bangkok Children\u2019s Hospital in the 1960s (7,17).",

In Yangon, the curve declined at 8 months but rose again at age 10 months, and no dip in cases occurred in 1-year-old children (Figures 2 and 3). In Ho Chi Minh City, infant cases declined at the end of the first year of life, but not to the baseline; by contrast, in Thailand and Indonesia by the end of the first year of life, the curve approached the baseline. These phenomena may be explained by differences in average annual rates of dengue infection. In Yangon, the modal age of hospitalization for DHF/DSS for children is 4 years (Figure 3), while in Bangkok it is 8 years (Figure 4). In Bangkok, DHF/DSS is rarely seen in 12- to 24-month-olds, signifying that second infections are usually delayed until after a child has lived through two dengue transmission periods (Figure 4). Among serologically studied infant DHF/DSS patients in Yangon, several ages 10 months and older had secondary dengue infections. These observations are consistent with high average annual rates of dengue infection in Yangon and lower infection rates in Bangkok. These relationships have been modeled mathematically (19).",

This study included 13 Bangkok infants, all with primary DENV-2 infections, who were admitted to hospital at different ages in the first year of life. During hospitalization, mother\u2019s blood was taken and tested as a surrogate for cord blood at birth. An analysis of dengue-neutralizing antibodies showed that every mother in the study had had two or more previous DENV infections (8). All infants acquired DHF/DSS during the short window of time when maternal DENV-2 neutralizing antibodies had degraded to a titer of approximately 1:10. Maternal sera enhanced DENV-2 at high dilutions. These data provide a logical explanation for the observed age distribution of infant DHF/DSS. At birth, maternal antibodies protect infants from dengue infection. As IgG antibodies are catabolized, a period of risk to enhanced infection ensues, followed in turn by the loss of enhancing antibodies and a corresponding decline in risk for DHF/DSS (Figure 5).",

Most cats naturally exposed as adults to FIPV develop antibody titers without showing clinical signs. Lesions in sick cats are believed to result from immunologically mediated responses (9,10,21). Kittens receiving apparently competent neutralizing antibodies to FIPV, transferred in colostrum from immune queens, develop a fatal disease a few days after infection with wild-type virus (22). Passive transfer of antibody by other routes produces the same result (22,23). This phenomenon is called the early death syndrome. FIPV in antibody-negative kittens occurs less reliably and is delayed for several weeks until animals develop their own antibody response to the virus. FIPV in kittens is characterized by thrombocytopenia and elevated ALT, AST, and serum bilirubin (22).",

One of the most intriguing aspects of coronavirus replication is the occurrence of high-frequency homologous RNA recombination (25). Together with porcine Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), canine coronavirus, and human coronavirus 229E (HCV), the feline coronaviruses form a separate cluster within the genus Coronavirus, including Feline enteric coronavirus, and FIPV (26). Coronavirus virions possess three structural proteins, a large spike glycoprotein (S), a small integral membrane glycoprotein (M), and a nucleocapsid protein (N) (24). These proteins are analogous to the envelope (E), M, and nucleocapsid (C) proteins of the flaviviruses. The feline coronaviruses can be divided into two serotypes, I and II, on the basis of cross-reactivity to canine coronavirus in virus neutralization assays (26). Type I viruses grow poorly in tissue cultures and show virtually no neutralization with anti\u2013canine coronavirus sera (27). Type II viruses grow readily in vitro (28). Analysis of gene structure suggests that type II viruses are derived from recombination of type I feline coronavirus and canine coronavirus (26). The two serotypes circulate as two pathotypes, the avirulent enteric viruses and the virulent FIPV (26). High-frequency mutations may help coronaviruses escape neutralization and promote infection enhancement in Fc receptor\u2013bearing cells.",

More cells are infected in the presence compared with the absence of antibody; the rates of viral entry and viral replication are similar under both conditions (30). Coronaviruses appear to enter mononuclear phagocytes by means of the plasma membrane without marked involvement of phagocytic or endosomal pathways (28). Some researchers have surmised that, as with DENV, when antibody-virus complexes attach to Fc-receptors, viruses are brought close to cell surfaces, where they enter the cells by normal mechanisms (31,32). Enhancement is mediated by clusters of epitopes on the S protein (33,34). Results with FIPV suggest that feline IgG2a antibodies mediate both neutralization and enhancement (33). Antibody-dependent enhancement in FIPV demonstrates a bell-shaped curve with increasing dilutions; maximal enhancement occurs at subneutralizing titers (34).",

A phenomenon reminiscent of the feline coronaviruses is the evidence that DENV also circulate as two biotypes: DENV-2 American genotype does not cause DHF/DSS, while DENV-2 SE Asian genotype does (40). As with feline coronaviruses, the severity of disease with the two DENV biotypes may be regulated by cross-reactive antibodies (41). Focused research on viral-antibody interactions at the structural level might clarify early pathogenesis events in DHF/DSS. Infants may provide an accessible and inexpensive model to study mechanisms controlling the severity of dengue infections. Workers actively involved in developing dengue vaccines may benefit from lessons learned in the FIPV model.",
