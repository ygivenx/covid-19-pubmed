            "text": "In South Korea, physicians are legally required to complete death certificates, which are then sent to Statistics Korea and made publicly available through the Korean Statistics Information Service (KOSIS; http://kosis.kr/eng). The death certificate includes information on disease directly leading to death, antecedent causes, and other major conditions contributing to death (12). Once the death certificate is submitted, a professional staff in Statistics Korea identifies a single most relevant underlying cause for each death, in accordance with the World Health Organization definition (13). The coding is reviewed by a committee to finalize the national public data provided to the users. Nationally, \u224890% of all deaths were certified in 1987, and almost 100% of deaths were certified by 2007 (14,15). The causes of death are coded according to the Korean Classification of Diseases, Sixth Revision, which is based on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), 10th Revision (ICD-10). The Korean Classification of Diseases was first adopted in 1973 and was revised in accordance with the amendments in the ICD scheme. The death data collected before 1995, which were coded in the ICD\u2019s Ninth Revision codes, are converted to ICD-10 codes by Statistics Korea by using a mapping reference table (https://kssc.kostat.go.kr:8443).",

We analyzed trends by age group (<1, 1\u20134, 5\u201314, 15\u201364, and >65 years) and disease (respiratory tract infection, sepsis, TB, intestinal infection, vaccine-preventable disease, central nervous system [CNS] infection, viral hepatitis, HIV-caused disease, and rheumatic heart disease). We used joinpoint regression analysis to identify years associated with significant changes in mortality rates (18). We calculated annual percentage changes (APCs) by using generalized linear models, assuming that a Poisson distribution was in play. To assess the trend over an interval, we computed an average of the APCs from the joinpoint model and used that result as a summary measure. The p value for a 2-sided test for which the true average of the APCs was zero was calculated based on a t distribution (https://surveillance.cancer.gov/help/joinpoint/setting-parameters/method-and-parameters-tab/average-annual-percent-change-aapc).",

The mortality trend for such diseases is U-shaped; a significant decrease is evident from 1983 to 1991 (APC \u22129.73), followed by an increase from 2006 to 2015 (APC 8.97). During the period of decrease, the largest percentage change was evident in death rates associated with intestinal infections (APC \u221214.30%), followed by death rates associated with CNS infections (APC \u221213.94), vaccine-preventable diseases (APC \u221210.97), and TB (APC \u22129.12). South Korea underwent rapid economic development in the 1980s, which was associated with the implementation of accessible universal healthcare in 1989. In 2000, an aging society was evident in South Korea, when the proportion of the population >65 years of age was 7.2% (6); this proportion increased to 10.7% in 2010 and to 12.7% in 2014. Improvements in healthcare access and public hygiene might have acted as the key drivers of the decrease in infectious disease mortality (5). Surprisingly, however, respiratory infection\u2013associated mortality has increased (APC 11.47), as has mortality attributable to sepsis (APC 6.99) and to intestinal infections (APC 5.48). A major societal turning point occurred in 1997; an economic crisis increased income inequality and weakened social cohesion, which affected health (21). The changes in societal structure and the resulting policies have been influenced by efforts to expand flexible labor markets. While workers have been experiencing job insecurity and disadvantages in wages and benefits, the economic crisis has exacerbated health inequalities; recent studies have shown increasing socioeconomic inequalities in self-rated health, suicide, and infant mortality (21). The increasing health inequalities are an important aspect of the recent increase in infectious disease\u2013caused mortality in South Korea. Health inequalities are not only an ethics and social justice issue but also an important public health problem that needs to be addressed appropriately. Addressing health inequalities should be prioritized in public health policy for the prevention and control of infectious diseases in South Korea.",

The greatest declines in infectious disease\u2013related infant mortality were observed during 1983\u20132007 (APC \u201310.86) and 2010\u20132015 (APC \u221218.45). In South Korea, large corporations were mandated by law to provide health insurance, commencing in 1977, and such coverage was gradually expanded to include the entire population by 1989 (22). Improved healthcare access has greatly increased vaccination and antibiotic treatment of infectious diseases. Infants are very susceptible to vaccine-preventable diseases; thus, the introduction of publicly available vaccines and expansion of vaccination coverage was effective in preventing infectious disease deaths. In 1991, the vaccination rates for publicly provided childhood vaccines in South Korea were 56%\u201280%, whereas in 2012, the vaccination rates were 95.9%\u2012100% (23,24). Moreover, although TB is not uncommon in South Korea, our data provide compelling evidence that deaths from TB have significantly declined over the past 23 years. TB control efforts (improved screening and early treatment) clearly have been successful in mitigating mortality (25).",

Many persons were subjected to layoffs, early retirements, and business failures, which affected major health indices such as healthcare use, rates of chronic and acute disease, and all-cause mortality rates, including that of suicide. Given the limited social security available to the elderly population in South Korea, the impact was more severe in this population, especially among persons with less education. The hospitalization rate decreased during the early stage of the economic crisis. During 1995\u20131998, rates of chronic disease increased by 27.1% and rates of acute disease by 9.5% (26). All-cause mortality began to increase \u22481 year after the crisis (27). During 1970\u20132010, overall mortality decreased by 70%\u201380%; however, only a minimal decline was evident in persons with less education (28). We found that education level affected mortality associated with respiratory tract infections and sepsis. Moreover, the elderly population might have acquired chronic diseases that contribute to the increased incidence and severity of infections. Also, the recent decrease in mortality associated with chronic diseases might have resulted in longer periods of exposure to infectious diseases, increasing the risk for death from certain infections in vulnerable populations (29).",

The numbers of immunocompromised persons are growing; the number of susceptible persons is increasing as a result of the greater extent of procedural and treatment invasiveness, including that associated with chemotherapy and transplantation (34,35). Nosocomial infections and antimicrobial resistance might increase both the incidence of and death from sepsis, intestinal infections, and pseudomembranous colitis. Few population-level epidemiologic data on sepsis or pseudomembranous colitis are available in South Korea (36). We emphasize, therefore, that public health authorities must note that the trends in deaths caused by sepsis have changed (37). The hepatitis A outbreak in South Korea during the late 2000s reflects an immunity gap in young adults (38). In South Korea, the seroprevalence of hepatitis A has been changing dynamically in adults 20\u201339 years of age, the population most affected by the outbreak. The increase in viral hepatitis\u2013related deaths in the 2000s suggests that epidemiologic transition cannot be ignored when formulating public health policies.",

The need to identify a specific cause of death might encourage miscoding and thus might bias our estimates. However, a previous validation study showed that \u224867% of the deaths from infectious disease were classified accurately (39). Second, the KOSIS database does not provide detailed classification of certain disease groups. For example, perinatal infections (P23 and P35\u201239) are included among \u201ccertain conditions originating in the perinatal period (P00\u201296),\u201d heart infections (I30 and I33) are included among \u201cother heart diseases (I26\u201251),\u201d and infections of the kidney and urinary tract (N10\u201213) are included among \u201cdiseases of the genitourinary system: urinary system (N00\u201239).\u201d Therefore, deaths caused by these disease groups were not included in this analysis. Third, the practical classification of the diseases in this study might not reflect the specific public health measures for control and prevention. For example, influenza and hepatitis A and B are now vaccine-preventable diseases, but influenza is still classified as a respiratory infection, and hepatitis A and B are still classified as viral hepatitis. As another example, the coding of sepsis is sometimes inconsistent and not standardized explicitly. Because sepsis develops mostly as a consequence of other disease processes, establishing a causal relationship with death is difficult, resulting in certain variations in coding. Depending on the etiology, certain subcategories of sepsis, CNS infections, lower respiratory tract infections, and intestinal infections can be prevented by vaccination.",

Periodic estimations of disease burden in South Korea are required to appropriately transition epidemiologic public health measures. Our findings will be useful in implementation and evaluation of control and preventive strategies. Sepsis and lower respiratory tract infection deserve attention as serious public health issues in the undereducated elderly population in South Korea.
