            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) causes lethal diarrhea in piglets, resulting in great economic losses all over the world, and is a member of Coronaviridae, causing severe entero-pathogenic diarrhea especially in piglets. PEDV belongs to group I coronavirus which consists of PEDV, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) (Vijgen et al. 2004), feline coronavirus (FeCoV), canine coronavirus (CCV), and human coronavirus NL63 (NL or New Haven) (BaoXian et al. 2009; van der Hoek et al. 2004). PEDV and TGEV caused the diseases characterized by rather similar clinical symptoms which make it rather difficult to draw a clear dividing line between them. Both of them replicate in the differentiated enterocytes of the small intestine and cause severe diarrhea (Sanchez et al. 1992). Several viral proteins are important for inducing an immune response to PEDV: the spike protein (S, 180\u2013220 kDa), the membrane protein (M, 27\u201332 kDa), and the nucleoprotein (N, 55\u201358 kDa) (Egberink et al. 1988). The S glycoprotein of PEDV possessed an immunodominant region S1 (Liyun et al. 2008) and plays a crucial role in the early steps of infection. It mediates binding of the virus to the cell surface and the subsequent fusion between the viral and cell membranes (Yeo et al. 2003; Duarte and Laude 1994). PEDV N protein forms a helical nucleocapsid with genomic RNA and is the predominant antigen produced in coronavirus-infected cells, thus making it a major viral target. Therefore, N protein as a sensitive diagnostic antigen was used to develop specific and sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Hou et al. 2007a; Rodak et al. 2005). However, N protein was not able to induce immunoprotection against PEDV infection owing to an envelope surrounding the virion shielding (Ge et al. 2009; Hou et al. 2007b).",

Many strains of LAB are able to survive and colonize in the intestinal tract (Wei et al. 2010; Davidson et al. 2011; Mohamadzadeh et al. 2010; Moeini et al. 2011; Fredriksen et al. 2010; Yigang et al. 2007). LAB are used as a live carrier delivering model pathogenic antigen on mucosal surface to induce systemic and mucosal effective immune responses, which may be preferable in terms of safety control, minimization of side effects, and non-specific immunoadjuvant effect (Galdeano and Perdigon 2006; Ogawa et al. 2006); this has provoked serial studies aimed at determining the capability and feasibility of the application of LAB as safe oral vaccines (Claassen et al. 1995; Pouwels et al. 1996; Maassen et al. 1998).",

            "text": "Like many other pathogens, PEDV initiates its infectious cycle at the mucosal surfaces, especially the intestinal mucosal epithelial surface (Ben Salem et al. 2010; Duarte and Laude 1994). Efficient protection against mucosal infections requires the development of new vaccines that induce protective immune responses not only at the systemic level but also at the mucosal level in order to inhibit the entry of virus into the body through the mucosal approach (Mota et al. 2006). This can best be achieved by mucosal vaccination, a route which offers several advantages over the traditional parenteral vaccines. The potential development of lactic acid bacteria to deliver heterologous antigens to the mucosal immune system has been proposed; these have many properties that make them attractive candidates as antigen delivery carriers for the presentation to the mucosa of compounds with pharmaceutical interest, in particular vaccines (Perdign et al. 2001; Mercenier et al. 2000; Wells et al. 1996).",

In addition, PG2-S1 and PG1-N were constructed previously in our laboratory (JunWei et al. 2009; Ge et al. 2009).

The death rate of infected piglets is over 95%, leading to significant economic losses in swine husbandry (de Arriba et al. 2002; Yeo et al. 2003). Hence, it is important to develop an effective vaccination to protect against PEDV infection. Because PEDV replicate mainly in the villi of the small intestines (Ben Salem et al. 2010), the recombinant live mucosal vaccines expressing pathogen-derived antigens can be an alternative method for providing protection (JunWei et al. 2009; Jun-wei et al. 2010). Mucosal immunization offers a number of advantages over other routes of antigen delivery, including convenience, cost-effectiveness, and induction of both mucosal and systemic immune responses (Shaw et al. 2000; Seegers 2002; Xin et al. 2003; Mannam et al. 2004; Lee et al. 2006). The goal is to provide the first line of defense by effectively eliminating pathogens at the mucosal surface. There were several studies focused on surface-displayed expression system based on bacteria (Ge et al. 2009; Hou et al. 2007a; Lee et al. 2006). However, surface display of antigens on the bacterial surface has been problematic because large antigens perturb membrane topology. True surface exposure of antigens requires a transmenbrane anchor that is long enough to cross the cell wall (Lee et al. 2006). At least 100 amino acids are needed to properly cross the cell wall (Leenhouts et al. 1999). In this report, we have developed a surface display system using the poly-gamma-glutamate synthetase A protein (pgsA) as the transmembrane anchor to present heterologous proteins on Lc. We adapted pgsA derived from the pgsBCA enzyme complex of B. subtilis isolated from chung-kook-jang (a traditional Korean soybean paste used as a food additive).",

            "text": "Mucosal delivery of vaccines induces mucosal immunity more efficiently than parenteral immunization (Mutwiri et al. 1999). The surfaces of the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and urogenital tracts, which are not covered by skin, are referred to as mucosa (Butler 1999). In total, the mucosa covers an area that is about 200 times larger than the skin. This large area is not as resistant to penetration as the skin because it is often limited by a thin epithelial layer without keratinization. A number of pathogens initiate infection through the mucosal surfaces. The mucosal surfaces, particularly the respiratory and digestive tracts, are exposed daily to a wide variety of foreign organisms and antigens. In addition, immunoglobulin A (IgA) is the primary immunoglobulin isotype induced at the mucosal surface. Secretory IgA (sIgA) in mucosal secretions provides protection against bacterial and viral pathogens and neutralization microbial toxins (Zhang et al. 2002; Yigang and Yijing 2008). Thus, they must be very effective in dealing with the large amounts of foreign antigens. The mucosa and associated lymphoid tissue is an attractive target for vaccine strategies because they harbor the early stages of infection (Ogra et al. 2001). Our observation supports the concept of a mucosal immune system in which mucosally situated IgA and IgG plasma cell progenitors are stimulated selectively by mucosal immunization and predicts that mucosal immunization can provoke both mucosal and circulating antibody responses better than parenteral immunization (Heritage et al. 1996).",

The corresponding recombinant strains PG2-S1 (JunWei et al. 2009) and PG1-N (Ge et al. 2009) have been constructed in our previous work. Lc-expressing S1, Lc-expressing N, and a mixture of equal parts of Lc-expressing S1 and Lc-expressing N were used to vaccinate mice via oral route, respectively. Although the amount of Lc-expressing S1 in the mixture was just half as much as that of Lc-expressing S1 alone for oral administration, a much higher level of IgG (serum) or IgA (mucus) specific for S protein was elicited by the mixture, which was consistent with PEDV neutralizing activity reflected by plaque reduction assay. However, antibody response specific for N protein induced by the mixture was inferior to that by Lc-expressing N. In view of the above-mentioned facts, we could speculate that N protein seems to play a crucial role in the production of higher-level antibody by the mixture, but S protein does not. Subsequently, we observed that the secretory level of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 of splenocytes isolated from mice immunized with the mixture stimulated by N protein was obviously higher than S protein. Theoretically, IL-4 could effectively advance the proliferative differentiation of B cells to plasma cells secreting a large amount of antibody. IFN-\u03b3 as an important member of cytokines has a vital role to play in directing immune responses and regulating immune network, especially the aspect of antivirus effect. As described above, it was undoubtedly logical that the mixture induced higher antibody responses against S protein. In theories, IL-4 could inhibit IL-12 pathway so that the secretion of IFN-\u03b3 is down-regulated. However, the result showed that IL-4 and IFN-\u03b3 were together induced by N or S1 to make Th1/Th2 relatively balanced with the greater amount of IL-4 than IFN-\u03b3, which demonstrated that Th2 response was a leading one.",

On the premise of the same bacterial amounts, the quantity of antigen anchored on the surface of Lc PG1 was far larger than Lc PG2 (data not shown) when recombinant Lc colonized the mucosal surface of the gastrointestinal tract because Lc PG2 secreted antigen into the external milieu. In addition, both Lc PG1 and Lc PG2 are inducible expression systems based on xylose operon and could not keep a sustainable expression of the target protein.

Taking the difficult expression of the whole S protein of PEDV in L. casei into consideration, an oral vaccine that induces neutralization of an antibody must include S protein immunodominant region S1 (Ho et al. 2005; JunWei et al. 2009; Liyun et al. 2008). For a successful immune response against an antigen, it is necessary that the antigen is present in sufficient quantities and in a form that can be recognized by antigen-presenting cells of the immune system. Consequently, L. casei suitably acts as mucosal vaccine carrier against gastrointestinal tropism pathogens. Although Balb/C mouse is not a genuine and susceptible animal model for PEDV, the results of our study at least indicate that L. casei surface-displayed S1 combined with L. casei surface-displayed N could act as a novel mucosal vaccine formulation that may present significant opportunities for PEDV vaccine development.",

By combining knowledge from the different disciplines, virology, molecular biology, immunology, bioinformatics, ecology, and epidemiology, even greater progress is expected to be made towards understanding of the importance of live bacterial carriers and the underlying principles of mucosal vaccination therein (Collins and Schodel 1997). The elucidation and characterization of the physical structure, chemical composition, and bioinformation of bacterial cell wall and surface protein have provided new and challenging opportunities which allow us to better understand the interaction between intestinal Lactobacilli and mucosal tissues. The recent development of molecular biological techniques could permit the construction of lactic acid bacteria-presenting foreign antigens exposed to the different immune organizations and for the first time make it opportunistic to further explore the potential of these safe food bacteria as vaccine vehicles (Gentschev et al. 2001).",

Although it is possible to determine the relative accurate level of expressed antigen in the test tube, we cannot precisely monitor gene expression in the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, it is necessary to develop novel methods to analyze expressed genes encoding antigens in situ so as to control the efficiency and persistence of expression. In addition, what is the optimal proportion of Lc-expressing S1 and Lc-expressing N in a mixture yielding better immune efficacy and how long could recombinant bacteria persist in the gastrointestinal tract remain in need of further research.",
