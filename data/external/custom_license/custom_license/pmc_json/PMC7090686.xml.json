This theory posits that information about a health threat evokes two cognitive processes: the formation of risk perceptions and appliance of protective behavior. The formation of risk perceptions is a process of \u201cthreat appraisal\u201d of perceived severity and the likelihood of threat to the individual\u2014both need to be elevated for a high risk perception to occur. Only those with a high risk perception will take precautionary actions but individuals need to believe such actions are effective (response efficacy) and that they are personally able to undertake such actions (self-efficacy). Information-seeking about a risk\u2019s severity and vulnerability is an essential part of this process [10, 11]. Intentions to implement protective actions, however, can be weakened by the perceived costs of the advocated risk-reducing behavior and the perceived benefits of the risk-enhancing behavior. As a consequence, people with high response efficacy could have low self-efficacy and would not adopt protective behavior.",

For example, the Asian media were associated with regularly updated death and infection bulletin tolls, implementation of protective measures, and the sacrifices made by the health workers.

In addition, the transience and mobility of the Chinese population meant that some key informants might have moved on since SARS. However, close links formed with key informants and purposive recruitment ensured inclusion of respondents with diverse SARS experiences. Media reports produced at the time of the outbreak were available for respondents to aid recall and group facilitation techniques were effective in seeking clarity and identifying uncertainty.",

More importantly, despite the challenges of communicating risk to ethnic minority populations who use diverse global information sources, a coordinated response from global media and national authorities will be essential. At a minimum, authorities in unaffected areas need to be able to communicate with information providers outside their own countries of jurisdiction and not rely on national outlets alone, as these will not reach population subgroups that regularly access media from their home countries. Similarly, broadcasts from affected regions need to acknowledge that they are likely to have an audience from unaffected regions who are also seeking advice and guidance. Accurate, timely, and transparent provision of information is critical for containing the outbreak and reducing public fear and uncertainty in response to new and emerging infections such as SARS in a global scope, not only in affected regions. In order to minimize adverse effects on vulnerable populations in unaffected regions during future outbreaks, needs assessment is required to map out the scope and nature of potential threats (physical, economic, and sociopsychological) and to assess the communication channels responsible for contributing to both risk perceptions and perceived efficacy of precautionary actions.",
