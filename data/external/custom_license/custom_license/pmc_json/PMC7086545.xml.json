Papers appeared describing progressively better techniques for specimen processing, as the transmission electron microscope became easier to use and more widely available. The transmission electron microscope employs a fine electron beam, created by a high-voltage, electric current-heated tungsten filament, focused by magnetic lenses. The electron beam passes through an ultrathin plastic section whose tissue and cellular components have been post-fixed in osmium and impregnated with the heavy metals uranyl and lead, which impede the beam in proportion to their respective degrees of electron density. The differential transmission of the electrons creates an image that is captured on a fluorescent screen, where it is viewed through a binocular microscope. Once the image is finally focused with the magnetic lenses, the film is exposed or the image is captured with a digital camera.",

Some laboratories, such as ours, have submitted a portion of virtually all biopsy and resection specimens from HIV/AIDS patients for ultrastructural study. As a result, new genera and species of pathogens have been discovered, and knowledge of the ultrastructure of these pathogens has been acquired, rendering their diagnosis at the light microscopic level easier; for example, several new microsporidia were identified and their morphogenesis was revealed17,18,19,20,21,22. The persistence of infectious HIV particles associated with follicular dendritic cells in the germinal centers of hyperplastic lymph nodes from HIV/AIDS patients was an important observation made by TEM, and confirmed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization. The pathology and diagnostic characteristics associated with viruses such as adenovirus, cytomegalovirus and papovavirus have been elucidated using TEM23,24. The human herpesvirus 8 or Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus associated with Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and multicentric Castleman's disease was successfully visualized in Kaposi's sarcoma specimens25.",

            "text": "As more and more antibodies have become available, IHC has all but replaced TEM in many surgical pathology departments. In some cases, this has been unfortunate, as markers that have purported to be specific for certain cell types/tumors, in time, turn out to have only a nonspecific association. A prime example is the antibody for neuron-specific enolase, which was heralded as specific for neuroendocrine tumors and is now referred to as 'nonspecific enolase'. As in many cases, one antibody, like neuron-specific enolase, has been replaced by a panel of antibodies, to create statistically more specific diagnostic results. On the other hand, the transmission electron microscope is an excellent tool for identifying the few and the many diagnostic dense core granules in the range of neuroendocrine tumors from small cell to carcinoid, respectively. With increased use of IHC, it has become apparent that there are few magic IHC 'bullets' and panels of IHC stains typically must be used. Interestingly, compared to a panel of IHC stains, TEM often is not only at least as specific, but is also a more economical approach in solving a diagnostic problem. Ultrastructural study can readily determine the type of a poorly or 'undifferentiated' carcinoma and even indicate the primary site of a metastasis.",

Epithelial cells are easily distinguishable from mesothelial cells. Needle biopsies are particularly good specimens for TEM. Radiographic guidance assures obtaining lesional tissue, minimizes elapsed time between the procedure and immersion in fixative and guarantees optimal preservation. Likewise, fine-needle aspirates (FNAs) are ideal for TEM. They can be optimally fixed by being injected directly into glutaraldehyde and treated as a cell suspension. Of course, if there are fragments of tissue present, they can also be routinely processed.",

Adjust the pH with HCl and NaOH and bring to a final volume of 1 liter with distilled water. Cover with parafilm and refrigerate.CautionSodium cacodylate is an irritant to the eyes, skin and respiratory tract. For this reason, some laboratories use phosphate-buffered saline as their primary buffer.Phosphate buffer (Sorenson's) Prepare a 0.2 M phosphate buffer comprising 0.2 M NaH2PO4 (sodium dihydrogen orthophosphate; for each 100 ml use 0.497 g) and 0.2 M Na2HPO4 (disodium hydrogen orthophosphate; for each 100 ml use 2.328 g). Keep refrigerated.Glutaraldehyde, etc., primary fixative The primary fixative for tissue and cells is 2.5% (vol/vol) glutaraldehyde in buffer. Mix 50 ml of 50% glutaraldehyde with 950 ml of sodium cacodylate buffer. There are several other glutaraldehyde fixatives that are in use, for example, 1% glutaraldehyde/10% formalin in phosphate buffer and paraformaldehye/glutaraldehyde (2% each in 0.1 M buffer).CautionGlutaraldehyde, formaldehyde and paraformaldehyde are irritants to the eyes, skin and respiratory tract.Osmium tetroxide, secondary fixative The secondary fixative is 0.5% osmium tetroxide in buffer. Depending on their results, some go as high as 2% osmium tetroxide. Take 200 ml of sodium cacodylate buffer in a brown bottle that has been thoroughly rinsed with distilled water and then add osmium (add an ampoule if you cannot get all of the crystals out) and rotate (container capped and sealed with parafilm) until osmium has dissolved. Store in a refrigerator. Alternatively, one can prepare a 4% stock solution in aqua dest. and store aliquots in the freezer and, when needed, thaw and add to buffer.CriticalIf using the crystalline form of osmium tetroxide, this solution must be prepared a day before usage, as it is poorly soluble in water.CautionOsmium tetroxide is highly toxic and must be used under a fume hood. It stains the skin black and its vapors can cause temporary blindness.Uranyl acetate contrast-enhancing ('stain') agent Dissolve 2% uranyl acetate in 50% ethanol (some use 4% uranyl acetate in 40% ethanol). Shake well and allow to settle overnight before usage. Uranyl salts dissolve slowly in water and are light sensitive. Store in a brown glass bottle.CautionToxic if ingested, inhaled and absorbed through a skin defect; effects are cumulative. Use under a fume hood.Lead citrate contrast-enhancing ('stain') agent Take 1.33 g lead nitrate and 1.76 g sodium citrate in a 50 ml conical tube. Add 30 ml of CO2-free aqua dest.

If using option B, C or D, once you have completed the steps, follow option F, the agarose method for preparing cells and FNAs for embedding.A\nTissue\niCarefully sample the tissue specimen. The pieces can be small cubes or thin shavings, but should not exceed 1 mm in thickness. They should be totally representative of the specimen. This is especially important when the specimen is variegated in color and texture. Samples from areas with different appearances can be put into either the same or separate bottles of glutaraldehyde.Critical StepIt is generally important when processing tumors to avoid fat, which appears yellow before osmium post-fixation and black thereafter, and necrotic areas, which will usually be soft and yellowish in color. Also, generally avoid hemorrhagic areas. However, there are situations, for example, bone marrow and tumors of fat cells, where processing fatty tissue is essential.iiStart the fixation process as soon as possible after the tissue has been separated from its blood supply (humans and experimental animals) by placing it in a scintillation vial with 5\u201310 ml of pH 7.2\u20134 buffered 2.5% glutaraldehyde. In our experience, we have found that temperature is not critical and processing on ice is not necessary. Store the fixative at 4 \u00b0C and let the fixation continue for at least 1 h at room temperature, before returning the vial to the refrigerator. Process the tissue at room temperature (we usually process only once or twice a week). The buffer can be either cacodylate or phosphate-buffered saline (for example, Sorenson's); we have not found any distinction.Critical StepThe speed of fixation is critical. Surgical procedures that are prolonged, for example, cystectomy, regularly result in poorly preserved tissue for ultrastructural study. Speed is so important that fixing the tissue in 10% neutral buffered formalin, when glutaraldehyde is not readily available, can suffice and even be equal to glutaraldehyde. Replace the formalin with glutaraldehyde, as soon as possible.Pause pointThe specimen can be stored in a refrigerator for up to a week before processing, with absolutely no ill effects.iiiCreate a puddle of buffer on a piece of dental wax and add the fixed tissue. Using a razor blade or scalpel, cut 'viable', representative tissue into no larger than 1 mm pieces and transfer eight pieces (if there are that many) into a labeled porous processing capsule. Remember, for TEM, a single lesional block of 'viable' tissue can go a very long way. Cap the capsule, put it into a beaker with buffer and a stir bar and place the beaker on a magnetic stirrer.Critical StepDo not ever allow tissue to dry out.Pause pointIf there are a large number of samples (e.g., ten or more), place the beaker containing the capsules in a refrigerator overnight and start the processing the next day.We have found that a sample can be left at room temperature in glutaraldehyde for years without ill effects. Occasionally we have to go back to fixed tissue, because the initially processed sections did not contain either any tumor or viable tissue, or because a retrospective TEM study was being performed. Alternatively, tissue can be stored in 70% ethanol or buffer.\nB\nCells in suspension, for example, \nlymphocytes and effusions\niCentrifuge untreated suspensions as soon as possible at about 800g at room temperature for 15 min to make a moderately firm pellet. A million cells yield a good visible pellet that makes a good 'healthy' TEM block. However, it is better to have more cells, so that one can have several blocks and potentially save a block or two in reserve if something unexpected happens during processing. With a hypocellular effusion, pelleting, adding more suspension and repelleting several times might be necessary to form an adequate pellet. Usually, if one can visualize a pellet, it is a sufficient amount for processing and TEM.iiRemove the supernatant, replace with pH 7.2\u20134 buffered 2.5% glutaraldehyde, re-suspend and allow to fix at room temperature for at least 60 min.iiiProceed with option F.\nC\nFNAs\niInject the aspirate directly into a bottle of pH 7.2\u20134 buffered 2.5% glutaraldehyde. Do not first put it in any cytology agent.iiIf the FNA has fragments of 'tissue', one can process them as tissue (see option A) and the rest as a suspension.iiiPellet the suspension in a microfuge at 9,500g at room temperature for 5\u201310 min and proceed with the agar method (option F).\nD\nCells, for example macrophages, attached to a substrate (plastic Petri dish)\u2014scraping method\niPour off medium and replace with room temperature, pH 7.2\u20134 buffered 2.5% glutaraldehyde. This maintains the shape of the cells. Any protein in the medium or specimen does not usually affect the TEM images. If it does, for example, reduce the crispness of the plasma or viral membranes, and if it is important, the cells can be rinsed in situ with buffer or suspended in buffer and pelleted, before adding the fixative. As we are often working with cells that are releasing virus and want to maintain as many virions associated with the cells as possible, we routinely do not pre-wash the cells.iiAfter about 1 h of fixation, scrape the cells free with either a rubber-policemen or the tip of a disposable plastic pipette. (Some recommend that the cells be scraped free after they have been first osmicated.) One needs at least one million cells for a barely visible pellet, but several million is preferable and will yield more than one block. As always, it is desirable to preserve enough cells for a possible second run.iiiPellet the cells in a microfuge at 9,500g at room temperature for 5\u201310 min and proceed with the agar method (option F).\nE\nProcessing cells \nin situ\n attached to a plastic substrate that will automatically detach with propylene oxide treatment\niWash the glutaraldehyde-fixed cells twice with buffer (degenerating and necrotic cells will generally spontaneously lift off the substrate and can be discarded, if so desired).iiFollow normal embedding procedure; pour graded ethanol solutions in and out of culture plates/wells.iiiRemove the final 100% ethanol from the wells using a glass pipette, replace with propylene oxide and leave it for 30 s.ivDraw the propylene oxide up and down in the pipette and transfer to a microfuge tube (cells will come off in sheets of transparent film). Centrifuge at 9,500g at room temperature for 5\u201310 min.vSubject pellets to two more changes of propylene oxide, centrifuging each time. Either process as described, or process the film with cells in agarose, as described in option F.viPut pellets in a mix of 50% propylene oxide and 50% Spurr's, for a minimum of 1 h, followed by 1 h in 100% Spurr's.viiPut pellets in fresh Spurr's in a small (0.4 ml) microcentrifuge tube and centrifuge (9,500g) at room temperature for 1 min. Polymerize in an oven at 70 \u00b0C for at least 12 h.viiiRemove the sample from the centrifuge tube, cut off pellet and place it in the tip of a BEEM capsule.ixFill the BEEM capsule with 100% Spurr's and polymerize in an oven at 70 \u00b0C for at least 12 h.\nF\nAgarose method for preparing cells and FNAs for embedding\niHeat water bath to about 90 \u00b0C.iiMelt the agarose (2% in buffer), bring to a boil on a hot plate and ensure all of the agarose has dissolved (can be stored at 4 \u00b0C). Leave on the hot plate, while being stirred with a stirring bar, so that the agarose stays in a liquid state.iiiCarefully aspirate the supernatant from the pelleted cells.ivAdd 5\u20136 drops of agarose to the cell pellet and gently vortex to make a homogeneous suspension.vPlace in water bath until ready to microcentrifuge at 9,500g at room temperature for 5\u201310 min.viIncubate tubes at 4 \u00b0C to allow the agarose to solidify (3\u20134 h).viiLabel microporous capsules with a pencil.viiiGrasp a wooden applicator stick at its ends and snap in two. Use the splintered end of the stick to carefully remove the pellet from the tube. Use a razor blade to remove excess agar, so that the pellet fits in a microporous capsule. After processing, cut the agarose block into tissue-size pieces for embedding.ixPlace the capsule in buffer until ready for processing.\nTroubleshooting\n\n\n",

Trim the faces of the chosen blocks so that they resemble a trapezoid. Use a new, single-edged razor blade that has been cleaned with acetone to remove oil. Place the block in chuck and mount into the adapter so that the microtome (e.g., Pyramitone) optics can be used to view the block while further trimming. Remove as much unwanted plastic as possible.

If the blocks do not harden sufficiently after a few more hours of heating, then cells or tissue kept in reserve must be processed. One can try increasing infiltration time or more gradually increase the percentage of resin during the infiltration phase. If the soft block represents the only available material, then one can cut away as much of the plastic as possible, and soak the block in sodium ethoxide on a rotator for 24 h at room temperature. Sodium ethoxide is prepared by adding NaOH pellets to ethanol until saturated. The solution is stored overnight before use and can be kept for months.

As shown in Figure 1, one can expect the 'trichrome' semi-thin plastic section stain to give differential staining similar to paraffin section trichrome and mucin stains. Figure 2 shows the type of result that can be obtained on a specimen initially paraffin embedded and then treated as described in Box 1. This figure illustrates that one can expect that neuroendocrine granules can be visualized by TEM, even though the tissue has been initially embedded in paraffin. Figures 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 are photomicrographs of tissue processed by following the standard procedure (option A). They demonstrate that one can expect preservation and visualization of characteristic cellular features, such as keratin (Fig. 3), endocrine granules (Fig. 4), surfactant (Fig. 5), long wavy microvilli (Fig. 6), glands (Fig. 9), core rootlets (Fig. 10) and actin (Fig. 11), as well as, parasites (Fig. 7) and viruses (Fig. 8). Figure 3 shows the typical appearance of intermediate filaments (cytokeratin) and junctions in well-preserved tissue. Figure 4 illustrates the diagnostic appearance of insulin granules even in suboptimally preserved tissue. Figure 5 illustrates the diagnostic appearance of laminated surfactant bodies of alveolar type II pneumocytes. Figure 6 shows the diagnostically long microvilli of mesotheliomas. Figure 7 illustrates the ultrastructural features of a Cryptosporidium parasite in the bowel.",
