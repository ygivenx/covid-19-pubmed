            "text": "The nucleic acid in an RNA virus is usually single-stranded RNA (ssRNA). Among the infectious diseases caused by ssRNA viruses are influenza, norovirus infection, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (Mayo and Pringle 1998). Recent studies have identified the imidazoquinoline resiquimod (R-848) to be an activator of human and murine toll-like receptor (TLR) 7 (Hemmi et al. 2002) and human, but not murine, TLR8 (Jurk et al. 2002). R-848-induced immune activation is very similar to virus ssRNA-induced immune activation because both R-848 and viral ssRNA bind to TLR7 (Akira et al. 2006). In fact, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 are induced by R-848 stimulation via nuclear factor-kappa (NF-\u03ba) B activation, which lies downstream of the TLR\u2013ligand interaction (Gibson et al. 2002). In addition, R-848 is a potent inducer of interferon (IFN)-\u03b1, an antiviral cytokine (Colonna et al. 2002), through interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 7 activation (Gibson et al. 2002; Heil et al. 2004; Karlsson et al. 2008).",

            "text": "In recent studies, it has been reported that stressful exercise might be associated with an increased susceptibility to viral infection by the herpes simplex virus (HSV) and influenza virus infections (Kohut et al. 2001; Murphy et al. 2008). In fact, stressful exercise has been shown to decrease the macrophage, neutrophil and natural killer cell functions (Davis et al. 1997; Ceddia and Woods 1999; Pyne et al. 2000; Kohut et al. 2001). In contrast, based on the findings of a bioassay sensitive to IFN-\u03b1, it has been suggested that there is a rise in the circulating concentration of IFN-\u03b1 following acute exercise (Viti et al. 1985). However, the changes in IFN-\u03b1 after pathogen stimulation during exercise and after exercise were not shown in that study. Accordingly, there is a possibility that changes in IFN-\u03b1 in response to R-848 occurred with exhaustive exercise. We and other researchers have already shown that bacterial component-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine production is inhibited by acute exhaustive exercise (Bagby et al. 1994; Kato et al. 2006; Kitamura et al. 2007; Tanaka et al. 2010). Furthermore, Kitamura et al. (2007) suggested that exercise-induced catecholamines are responsible for exercise-induced suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokine production. However, it remains unclear whether the immune response to viral infection is also inhibited by intense exercise. In particular, the role of TLR7 on stressful exercise-induced increase in viral infection is not currently understood. It is also unclear whether exercise-induced catecholamines stimulate cytokine production in response to R-848. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether exhaustive exercise (EX) inhibits TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b1 production after R-848 injection in mice. Our hypothesis was that R-848-induced TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b1 production would be inhibited following exhaustive exercise.",

The plasma TNF-\u03b1 concentration in N-EX mice was greatly increased at 1 h after R-848 injection (P < 0.01). In EX mice, however, the elevation of TNF-\u03b1 concentration in plasma was not as high as that in the N-EX group at 1 and 3 h after R-848 injection (P < 0.05, respectively). This phenomenon, i.e., that R-848-induced TNF-\u03b1 production is inhibited by prior exhaustive exercise, seems to be very similar to that of LPS-induced TNF-\u03b1 production (Bagby et al. 1994; Kitamura et al. 2007; Tanaka et al. 2010). Therefore, intense exercise might inhibit R-848-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine production.\n",

It is clear that the signaling pathway downstream of TLR7 requires IRF7, which enhances the ability to bind to the IFN-\u03b1 promoter after nuclear translocation. Therefore, only IFN-\u03b1 is directly induced by viral infection, and IFN-\u03b1 induction is a consequence of this initial IFN-\u03b1 expression. During viral infections, the rapid production of IFN-\u03b1 is required to prevent the spread of viruses within the host organism. In addition to its direct antiviral effects, IFN-\u03b1 regulates both the innate and adaptive immunity. Accordingly, exhaustive exercise-induced IFN-\u03b1 suppression may be one reason why prolonged strenuous exercise increases the risk for viral infection (Nieman 1994).",

            "text": "However, the question as to which stage (pathogen recognition, the mRNA expression of cytokine, mRNA translation, and/or post release neutralization) regulates immune depression after exercise remains unanswered, despite tremendous advances in our understanding of the role of TLRs in host defense and the specific signaling events that are initiated following TLR activation (Akira and Takeda 2004). Acute exercise has been reported to decrease the monocyte cell-surface expression of TLRs in humans (Gleeson et al. 2006; Lancaster et al. 2005; Stewart et al. 2005; Simpson et al. 2009). However, other studies found no effect of acute exercise on monocyte cell-surface TLR4 expression (McFarlin et al. 2004; Tanaka et al. 2010). The most likely explanation for the differences in these findings is related to the intensity/duration of the exercise stimulus and the form of the subject mammal. However, even if the expressions of TLR1, 2, 3 and 4, but not 9, were decreased by acute exercise (Gleeson et al. 2006; Lancaster et al. 2005b), the effect of the exercise on TLR7 expression still remains unclear. In addition, a recent study showed that EX-induced TNF-\u03b1 suppression in response to LPS was observed despite no changes in the cell-surface expression of TLR4 and the TNF-\u03b1 mRNA expression (Tanaka et al. 2010). Although this model of exercised animals with LPS injection might contribute to the study of immune function in response to bacterial infection, further studies are needed to clarify the detailed cellular and molecular mechanisms of immune functions in response to virus infection. Because it is well known that both LPS/TLR4 and R-848/TLR7 recognition induce NF-\u03baB activation, and thereafter stimulate TNF-\u03b1 mRNA expression (Akira et al. 2006), one possibility is that exhaustive exercise-induced TNF-\u03b1 suppression in response to R-848 can also be regulated at the post-transcriptional stage of TNF-\u03b1 in response to R-848.",

            "text": "The differences in the concentrations of epinephrine and norepinephrine between exercised and non-exercised animals are considerable. Exhaustive exercise increases plasma epinephrine (3.0\u20133.7-fold) and norepinephrine (4.2\u201310.4-fold) in rodents (Kitamura et al. 2007; Kr\u00fcger et al. 2008). These catecholamines bind to \u03b1- and \u03b2-adrenergic receptors on the external surface of the cell membranes. The hormone\u2013receptor complexes interact with G proteins and activate adenylate cyclase which converts adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). cAMP activates protein kinase A, which subsequently phosphorylates certain intracellular proteins, thereby altering their activity (Tanaka et al. 2002; Collado-Hidalgo et al. 2006). Catecholamines have been shown to suppress TNF-\u03b1 production in response to LPS via a \u03b2-adrenergic receptor (Elenkov and Chrousos 2002; Kitamura et al. 2007). In peripheral blood leukocytes and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), the induction of interferon antiviral activity by double-stranded RNA (poly I:C) or CpG DNA was substantially inhibited by catecholamines (Collado-Hidalgo et al. 2006). In the present study, we found that epinephrine could completely inhibit and norepinephrine could partially, but significantly, inhibit the R-848-induced TNF-\u03b1 production in RAW264 cells. Furthermore, the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol greatly attenuated exercise-induced suppression of TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b1 in response to R-848 in mice. Our data for the first time demonstrate the independent role of catecholamines in suppressing cytokine production in response to R-848 after exercise. It is known that catecholamines reduce macrophage production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 (Zinyama et al. 2001) and type I interferon such as IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 (Collado-Hidalgo et al. 2006). We hypothesized that catecholamines contribute to the exhaustive exercise-induced reduction in TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b1 levels following R-848. In an in vitro experiment, following R-848 treatment TNF-\u03b1 production was significantly inhibited by pre-treatment with epinephrine and norepinephrine. It has been reported that \u03b2-adrenergic agonists suppress, and \u03b1-adrenergic agonists augment LPS-stimulated TNF-\u03b1 production and its gene expression (Ignatowski et al. 1996). Norepinephrine has a high affinity for both \u03b1- and \u03b2-adrenergic receptors, whereas epinephrine has a high affinity for \u03b2-adrenergic receptors alone (Woods 2000). Therefore, the \u03b2-adrenergic receptors, which have an affinity for both epinephrine and norepinephrine, may modulate the effects of catecholamines on the exercise-induced changes in TNF-\u03b1 in response to R-848.",

            "text": "In this study, however, R-848 did not stimulate any significant IFN-\u03b1 production in macrophages in vitro. Recent studies have reported that R-848 could not induce IRF7 and IFN-\u03b1 production in human macrophages (Heil et al. 2004; Siren et al. 2005). It remains to be determined which specific cell type is responsible for the increase in plasma IFN-\u03b1 in response to R-848. Ito et al. (2002) previously reported that R-848 had the capacity to induce IFN-\u03b1 production from pDCs, but not from CD11c+ myeloid DCs, in human peripheral blood. It is noteworthy that the pDCs constitutively express both \u03b2-adrenergic receptors (Goyarts et al. 2008) and TLR7 (Ito et al. 2002). Although it has been reported that exercise induced IL-12 production of DCs in animals (Chiang et al. 2007) and that acute exercise induced a rise in circulating DC counts in humans (Ho et al. 2001), unfortunately, it is not yet known whether the IFN-\u03b1 production in DCs is induced by exhaustive exercise. At least, we could conclude that exercise-induced catecholamines acting through \u03b2-adrenergic receptors can significantly blunt TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b1 productions in response to R-848.",

Both TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b1 concentrations in exercised mice were significantly lower than those in non-exercised mice. Furthermore, in an in vitro experiment, prior epinephrine treatment strongly inhibited R-848-induced TNF-\u03b1 production in macrophages. Finally, the exercise-reduced TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b1 production in response to R-848 is completely inhibited by the blockade of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors. These results suggest that exhaustive exercise-induced catecholamines reduce cytokine production in response to R-848 via TLR7.",
