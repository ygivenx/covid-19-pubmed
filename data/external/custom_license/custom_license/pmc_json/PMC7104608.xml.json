            "text": "In the era of big data, companies and organizations are able to capture, process, manage, and analyze large volumes of data and turn them into valuable information and managerial insights that can help design better products, enhance service quality, improve operations, and make decisions. Big data analytics not only supports businesses and commercial organizations to create further profits, but also helps governments and public sectors with providing high-quality services to citizens, and consequently benefits the populations by enhancing the quality of life. Although many sectors like retail and banking have already embraced big data for many years, the healthcare industry has lagged behind them due to several reasons, such as medical service providers\u2019 resistance to change, underinvestment in information technology because of uncertain returns, security issues, and patient privacy concerns (Groves et al. 2013; Kayyali et al. 2013). While there are various barriers to utilize big data in the healthcare industry, without a doubt big data can substantially benefit the healthcare stakeholders, for instance, by conducting comparative effectiveness research, developing clinical decision support systems, remotely monitoring patients, promoting personalized medicine, and analyzing disease patterns (Manyika et al. 2011). In this paper, we present a platform, which is based on radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology, for hospital ward management. With a prototype developed based on the architecture of this platform, a pilot study was then conducted in two medical wards of the intensive care unit of one of the largest public general hospitals in Hong Kong to demonstrate the feasibility of its practical use.",

            "text": "Prior to the introduction of RFID technology to the healthcare industry, healthcare facilities had to keep track of patients and valuable assets manually, or by the use of barcoding; the adoption of RFID in healthcare management has facilitated those practices. RFID has advantages over barcodes; barcodes have to be scanned manually one at a time within the line of sight of the reader, while multiple RFID tags, even if they are covered by some other objects, can be detected automatically and simultaneously by an RFID reader, whose read range is longer than the read ranges of barcode scanners. This automated process can save labor hours for performing some hospital routine tasks. The time saved from these non-value-added activities can help to reduce operational costs, or be transferred to provide additional professional services that can benefit patients. RFID not only reduces healthcare expense, but also facilitates automating and streamlining patient identification processes in healthcare operations (Chowdhury and Khosla 2007). The identification processes can help to reduce medical errors and mitigate patient risk. Overall, those healthcare facilities which had implemented RFID believed that the technology has more advantages than disadvantages (Reyes et al. 2012).",

            "text": "Our work was motivated by the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Hong Kong. In the incident, a significant number of individuals, including patients and hospital staff, were infected with SARS within a hospital. A project team from the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) considered the deployment of RFID technologies to trace the physical contacts of individuals within the wards in case of an infectious disease outbreak, in order to immediately and effectively isolate potentially infected individuals to mitigate the risk of disease widespread. Although many healthcare professionals around the world have put enormous efforts into avoiding cross-infection among people in healthcare facilities since the SARS outbreak in 2003, risk mitigation of infectious disease in healthcare settings appears to be not very effective. It is not uncommon that individuals working in or visiting a healthcare unit are infected by some disease carriers. For example, the recent outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in South Korea, where most of the infections took place in health facilities (BBC News 2015), has again raised public worry about the spread of infectious disease in healthcare settings and has further affirmed the importance of tracing physical contacts between individuals in order to quickly and effectively isolate individuals suspected of carrying MERS. The goal of the project presented in this paper is to develop a platform that enables traceability of individuals in healthcare settings. In addition to the traceability, our proposed platform also benefits the healthcare stakeholders by enhanced patient care, and increased operational efficiency and throughput.",

RFID applications not only have practical contributions to optimizing operations in business and public sectors, but also have research values; in particular, academic journals in the field of operations and processes management such as Production and Operations Management, International Journal of Production Economics, and International Journal of Production Research devoted special issues to papers of real-life RFID applications (Dutta and Whang 2007; Ngai and Riggins 2008; Ngai 2010). For overall RFID applications, literature review, and future research, we refer the reader to Chao et al. (2007), Ngai et al. (2008), Liao et al. (2011) and Zhu et al. (2012). Although RFID technology has been widely applied in many industries, its adoption in the healthcare industry is still far behind from others due to various reasons, such as long payback periods, the need to modify the existing processes, the lack of applicable standards (Reiner and Sullivan 2005), and privacy and security concerns (Rosenbaum 2014). For recent reviews of literature on the adoption and implementation of RFID technologies in the healthcare industry, we refer the reader to Health Industry Business Communications Council (2012), Wamba (2012), Yao et al. (2012), Coustasse et al. (2013) and Wamba et al. (2013).",

            "text": "There have been various successful RFID-enabled applications in the healthcare industry. A major proportion of work deployed RFID to reduce medical mistakes or errors, which aims to improve patient safety. Medical mistakes are the third leading cause of death in the United States (Hospital Safety Score 2013) and are estimated to cause 440,000 preventable deaths of patients (James 2013). Among all kinds of medical errors, misidentification is a major source (Yao et al. 2012). Positive patient identification (Aguilar et al. 2006), which requires each patient to wear a RFID wristband that contains the patient demographic information, has been proposed to provide a solution for reducing those errors due to patient misidentification. Dalton and Rossini (2005) used RFID technologies to avoid blood transfusion errors. The staff members of the blood donation centre used RFID readers to scan the RFID wristbands of patients and checked with their PDAs if the information is identical with the blood bag tag. Fuhrer and Guinard (2006) developed a web-based application, which is called the RFIDLocator, to track and locate patients. The system made sure that the correct operation is performed on the right patient at the right operating theater. Yen et al. (2012) proposed two RFID-based solutions to reduce inpatient medical errors by nurses. An offline solution was proposed for the use in a hospital environment that does not support wireless communication. The nurses had to download the latest inpatient\u2019s prescription records from the system at the nurse station to their PDAs before visiting their patients, and to upload the their drug administration records from their PDAs to the system after their visits. An online solution was proposed for the use in an environment that wireless communication is enabled, so that the nurses could download and upload real-time drug administration information from and to the system at any moment. For both solutions, the nurses used their PDAs, which were equipped with an RFID reader, to read the RFID tags in the wristbands of the patients and in the corresponding unit-dose packages to eliminate medication errors during drug administration tasks.",

A smart active label, which was capable of measuring and recording the time stamp of application, its duration, temperature, and ethanol concentration, was used to transmit the information to readers. They proposed two methods, differential dynamic method and static disinfection control, to monitor hand disinfection of people in hospitals. To fight against drug counterfeiting, pharmaceutical companies have also deployed RFID for drug packaging and labeling to prevent fake products from entering their supply chains (Young 2004).",

The data can reflect the usage durations for different classes of staff and equipment. Hospital administrators can therefore calculate the utilizations of different types of resources, identify scarce resources, and determine their optimal levels for future use.

Hong Kong was the city suffering most from SARS; there were 1,755 cases and 299 deaths reported in the period of outbreak (WHO 2004). The SARS epidemic in Hong Kong began in the Prince of Wales Hospital (PWH) in Hong Kong five days before WHO announced that there were numerous cases of acute respiratory syndrome with unknown aetiology reported in the area of the southern part of the People\u2019s Republic of China (SARS Expert Committee of Hong Kong SAR Government 2003). Before WHO announced the outbreak of this deadly disease and placed a high alert on the situation, the hospital management of PWH had already suspected that there was a communicable disease outbreak within the hospital when eleven medical staff members working in the same ward reported sick leave simultaneously. Although PWH had eventually identified the index case-patient and then immediately isolated this patient and other infected carriers, a total of 239 individuals, including medical staff, students, patients, and visitors, were cross-infected with SARS in PWH due to the unawareness of this previously unknown disease when this patient was admitted (SARS Expert Committee of Hong Kong SAR Government 2003). After the outbreak of SARS, a project team from the CUHK considered the feasibility of using RFID technology to enable traceability for person-to-person physical contacts in order to provide immediate response to the widespread of infectious diseases and better risk management within hospital wards.

Such cross-infection can be difficult to prevent as carriers of some deadly infectious disease may only show mild symptoms (such as fever, cough, and muscle pain) at an early stage after being infected so that medical staff are not able to identify these carriers and isolate them in the first place. The outbreaks of SARS in Hong Kong and MERS in South Korea are examples of cross-infection of deadly diseases among people in healthcare settings. Since an effective and prompt isolation of potentially infected individuals can substantially mitigate disease widespread, the project team of CUHK aimed to apply advanced technology to facilitate the isolation procedure.",

Each ward was subdivided into different zones, where active RFID readers were installed at the corners of each zone. Therefore, there were at least four RFID readers used to locate each object with a high accuracy of the location data. The active RFID readers and tags, that were used to track the locations of the objects, were manufactured by the Department of Electronic Engineering of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Figure 2 shows an RFID reader that was used in this project. The tags were attached to the patients, caregivers, and equipment (infusion pumps, cardiac meters, oxygen cylinders, stretchers, and wheelchairs) of the two wards to track their locations. The RFID tags were inexpensive (less than USD 8), and small enough (around 5 cm) so that they could be embedded in the badges of the caregivers and the patients could wear them as wristbands. Figures 3, 4 and 5 showed the RFID tags that were used in the pilot study. In this project, in total, there were 55 patients, 110 caregivers, and 72 equipments tracked in the RFID-enabled environment. All of them were given a unique object ID and registered in the system. In summary, the data captured by this platform were location data about the tagged objects in the wards and have the following characteristics:Velocity: In every second, the readers and the tags communicated and the object-location data were stored in the system.Volume: The fast data collected from the readers were stored into the system continuously. There were in total more than 15 million records (excluding those records that the location data remained constant in a period of time) captured by the system.Veracity: Multiple readers were installed in different locations of the wards to obtain object-location information of high accuracy.\n",

In order to effectively and promptly identify and isolate the high-risk groups of people that had contacted the carrier, a system that can trace the physical contacts associated with this patient will be exceedingly helpful. Our platform is able to report person-to-person physical contacts. A user can define a person-to-person physical contact.The user has to specify how close two individuals were and how long they were together to constitute a physical contact. For example, the user can define a physical contact between two individuals if the two individuals were staying together continuously for 5 s with their distance less than 1 meter. With the user\u2019s definition of person-to-person physical contacts, the platform is able to list all pairs of individuals that had contacts. This person-to-person physical contact relationship can be reported using a network diagram, where a node represents an individual and an edge represents a physical contact between them . Figure 6a shows a network diagram which represents the person-to-person physical contacts. The node size and edge size are proportional to the number of individuals that the represented person contacted in the ward and total contact time between them. We can also select a particular person and identify the individuals that this person has contacted in the incubation period, where an example is illustrated in Fig. 6b. This data visualization technique can enable the hospital management very quickly to trace back whom the patient has contacted physically and identify high-risk contact groups, e.g., the individuals that have a significant duration of physical contacts with the carriers or have contacted a number of carriers. The times and durations that the physical contacts have taken place are also stored in the system for more detailed risk analysis.\n",

When the walking distance is calculated for a ward staff, the ward manager is able to identify the staff who have moved too frequently and may redesign the workflow. The time-location data about staff can also be associated with those about the equipment and the patients. If a caregiver was with a particular equipment and a patient for a significant time duration, it is very likely that a caregiver was providing the patient with some service using that equipment. Since each equipment is designed for some specific purpose (e.g., an infusion pump is used for injecting medication or nutrients into a patient\u2019s body), the concurrence of a caregiver, an equipment, and a patient at the same location point can imply the type of service that the caregiver was providing in that period. This can also help hospital administrators understand the activities of the nurses for better workforce planning and avoiding unbalance workload.\n",

For example, it was not recommended because patients\u2019 both wrists were full of needle applications or due to their skin conditions. Besides patient physical conditions, some of the patients were reluctant to participate due to various personal reasons, e.g., resistance to advanced technology and unwillingness to being tracked during the length of stay.

Although there have been various applications of big data for healthcare use, the healthcare industry is still lagging behind other industries such as retail and banking. This indicates that there is a need to further promote big data in the healthcare domain. In this paper, we presented an active RFID-enabled platform to keep track of the locations of patients, ward staff, and medical equipment, for hospital ward management. The platform empowers real-time monitoring and tracking of objects, reporting of ward statistics, and providing intelligence and analytics. A distinctive feature of our proposed platform is that, all the individuals, including ward staff, are tagged and their locations are tracked continuously. This enables the traceability of person-to-person physical contacts in case of an infectious disease outbreak so as to provide immediate and effective response to mitigate risk of disease widespread within the hospital. A pilot study which deployed a prototype developed based on our proposed architecture of the platform was conducted in two medical wards of the intensive care unit of one of the largest public general hospitals in Hong Kong. Although the pilot study demonstrated its feasibility for practical use, we also report some of the human issues that obstruct its adoption and implementation, which are beyond the technical challenges that researchers and engineers can handle. Furthermore, installation of a RFID-network can be costly due to the infrastructure (e.g., active RFID readers, wiring, and some construction work) and the development of a middleware so that hospital management may hesitate to adopt the technology. Nevertheless, these costs are mostly one-time initial set-up costs, because the tagged wristbands can be reused, while the maintenance cost is relatively lower. The hospital also further benefits from cost saving by preventing valuable medical equipment being stolen [e.g., the price of a cardiac monitor ranges from a hundred to several thousand US dollars according to Alibaba.com (2015)] and well-utilizing the scarce medical staff, who have been in huge shortage in the medical system particularly in Hong Kong (Chinadaily Asia 2014). We also believe that the implementation of this RFID-enabled platform would benefit the healthcare stakeholders by the advantages of enhanced patient safety, increased operational efficiency and throughput, and mitigation of infectious disease widespread. Most importantly, the enhancement in effectiveness and efficiency of medical service delivery to patients and the capability of mitigating patient risk can improve patient health outcomes and even save more invaluable human lives that can hardly be measured in monetary value.",
