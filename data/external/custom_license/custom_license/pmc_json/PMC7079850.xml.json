            "text": "Licorice root has been a herbal medicine in China for over a thousand years. It is commonly used in Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) and Chinese proprietary medicines (CPMs). Glycyrrhizic acid (GL) (Fig. 1a) is a major active compound and a quality control marker of licorice root. It has anti-viral [1, 2], anti-inflammatory [3], anti-carcinogenesis [4, 5], anti-hepatitis [6\u20138], anti-thrombotic [9], and immunomodulatory [10] activities. Its antiviral activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus has recently been demonstrated in vitro [11, 12]. GL is also used as food additive and masking agent in pharmaceutical products because of its sweet taste (170 times sweeter than sucrose) [13].\n\n",

            "text": "The content of GL in the licorice roots varies considerably with strains, cultivars, growing regions, climatic conditions, and harvest age. The quality of the raw herbs used in the CPMs affects the final therapeutic outcomes and consumer safety. An effective method is needed to screen large numbers of licorice root samples for the quality control. Existing methods for the determination of GL include high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) [14, 15], liquid chromatography\u2013ion trap mass spectrometry (LC-ITMS) [16], capillary electrophoresis [17], near-infrared spectroscopy [18], immunosensor [19], immunoassay [13, 20\u201322], and micellar electrokinetic chromatography [23]. Compared to conventional instrumental methods, immunoassay is a rapid and sensitive method which needs small quantities of test materials and simple pretreatments. There are reports of ELISAs based on monoclonal antibody (MAb) against GL [13, 24]. The MAb was obtained from GL\u2013BSA synthesized by the NaIO4 method. The ELISA reported by Mizutani et al. [13] had a detect range of 20\u2013200 ng mL\u22121. Here, we report a new ultra-sensitive and specific immunoassay by using a new GL MAb. A conventional indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (icELISA) and a simplified icELISA were developed for the determination of GL in different licorice samples.",

In general, there is some correlation between the position in the hapten molecule used for the conjugation to carrier protein and the recognition of epitopes on the hapten by the prepared antibodies. The epitopes distant from the site of conjugation tend to be well recognized by antibodies, whereas epitopes neighboring the coupling site tend to be less well recognized [27]. There are three carboxyl groups in the GL molecule. Thus, it is proposed that the carboxyl group in its aglycon, but not the carboxyl groups in the two glucuronic acid molecules, was connected with the free amino group on the carrier protein (Fig. 1c). However, the hypothesis needs further study to be verified.",
