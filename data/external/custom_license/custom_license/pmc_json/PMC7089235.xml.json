Suppose outcomes are assessed on the basis of well-being and an outcome with more overall well-being is better than one with less overall well-being. Supporters of the incompatibility thesis might claim that more overall well-being will result if physicians are not allowed to refuse to provide medical services for reasons of conscience. However, those who reject the incompatibility thesis might advance the opposite claim. It is doubtful that empirical evidence is available to confirm decisively or disconfirm either claim. Moreover, it is overly simplistic to talk about comparing a conception of professional obligations that permits conscientious objection with one that does not, for there are a variety of conditions that might be placed on conscientious objection, such as requirements to notify in advance and refer. In addition, the calculation can become even more complex if an ideal or pluralistic conception of well-being is adopted, and intrinsic value is ascribed to moral integrity, the primary value underlying claims of conscience [3].",

In addition, although it might be stipulated that each person has an interest in access to health care and appreciates the value of protecting one\u2019s moral integrity, the veil of ignorance precludes knowledge of the individual\u2019s distinctive moral and religious beliefs. Now, suppose that the choice is between two principles specifying the professional obligations of health care professionals. One principle, P1, permits conscientious objection by physicians when it does not place an undue burden on patients\u2019 access to medical services. The other principle, P2, prohibits conscientious objection. It is at least arguable that P1 would be preferred to P2. In support of this conclusion, it can be said that choosing P1 would protect a very important interest (moral integrity) without significantly threatening another very important interest (access to health care).",

According to this account, insofar as the end or goal of medicine is healing, entering the profession requires a commitment to that end (i.e., healing patients). If an individual is not willing and able to make such a commitment, she should not become a doctor, and anyone with a medical license who does not make and consistently honor that commitment is not a virtuous physician.",

For example, suppose Dr. Brickstone becomes a Christian Scientist after completing his residency in obstetrics/gynecology. He now refuses to provide any medical intervention and promotes prayer as the only acceptable means of healing and pain control. We justifiably would be reluctant to say that he is promoting the goals of medicine or even engaged in its practice. But, what if, due to conscience-based objections, another ob/gyn physician, Dr. Morrison, refuses only to prescribe emergency contraception, perform abortions, and administer terminal or palliative sedation? Does it follow that she is failing to honor a commitment to promote healing? There are at least two reasons for a negative answer.",

In this sense, healing can occur when the patient is dying even when cure is impossible\u201d [6, p. 568]. As laudable as this more expansive conception of the end of medicine may be, the claim that it is derived from the concept of medicine as a profession is implausible. Until fairly recently, it was not generally accepted within the medical profession that physicians have a legitimate role in providing care and comfort to dying patients. Palliative care advocates could not rely on a timeless concept of medicine and its end(s). Instead, it was necessary to promote a more expansive conception of the goal(s) of medicine. Insofar as it is debatable whether \u201chealing\u201d does or should include palliative care, it is a contested concept, and conceptual analysis alone cannot conclusively resolve the debate.",

Don\u2019t abortions to protect a pregnant woman\u2019s health or life clearly fall within the scope of the physician\u2019s professional obligation to promote healing? Dr. Morrison might defend a negative answer by claiming: (1) since the result is the death of the fetus, even a therapeutic abortion cannot be characterized as an act of healing, or (2) performing therapeutic abortions falls outside the scope of legitimate means for physicians to promote healing. The former claim cannot be refuted by appealing to the plain meaning of \u201chealing.\u201d To be sure, the latter claim is contrary to current professional norms.

A physician can be committed to healing and still not provide all healing-related services. Specialists and subspecialists offer only a limited range of medical services that promote healing. For example, dermatologists treat skin cancer and acne, but they do not treat hernias and coronary artery disease. Even within specialties and subspecialties, physicians may limit the types of treatments that they offer. Yet, by virtue of limiting the healing-related services they offer, they cannot be accused of failing to honor a commitment to healing. Accordingly, if Dr. Morrison provides other healing-related services, it cannot be said that she fails to honor a commitment to healing when she refuses to prescribe emergency contraception, perform abortions, and provide terminal or palliative sedation.",

This feature is the alleged nature of the physician\u2013patient relationship and the corresponding professional obligation of physicians to give priority to patients\u2019 interests over their own. As Pellegrino puts it: a \u201csuppression of self-interest\u201d is mandatory \u201cwhen the welfare of [patients] requires it\u201d [5, p. 378]. This obligation is said to derive from the physician\u2019s commitment to healing combined with the vulnerability of patients, which is due to illness and the power and knowledge differential between them and physicians. The reasoning is as follows: In order to promote healing, physicians must not allow their own interests to interfere with their clinical judgment and recommendations. Moreover, if physicians did not demonstrate a willingness to suppress their self-interest and, when healing requires it, place the interests of patients above their own, patients would not trust physicians. Maintaining trust, however, is essential because it is a precondition of an effective and enduring physician\u2013patient relationship (i.e., a relationship that enables the physician to practice her profession and pursue the goal of healing).",

However, if \u201cmedicine\u2019s standard of altruism\u201d required physicians to put patients\u2019 financial interests or interest in convenience above their own, let alone their arguably more significant interest in moral integrity, it would be a violation of a physician\u2019s professional obligations to charge patients with financial problems, take vacations, limit time spent with patients, or refuse to make house calls or schedule night-time and weekend appointments for patients with day jobs.3 More to the point in the context of an analysis of the essentialist conception of the internal morality of medicine, insofar as the end of medicine is said to be healing, the interests of patients that a physician would be required to put above his own would be limited to those related to healing, and there is no apparent connection between the interests identified by Rhodes and healing-related interests.",

As this statement indicates, they reject the implausible absolutist view that the healing-related interests of patients always trump physician interests. They do not provide a criterion for striking an appropriate balance, but any reasonable criterion would have to distinguish among interests according to their importance or significance and moral weight; and a physician\u2019s interest in moral integrity is a very important interest that has substantial moral weight.4 In any event, the admission that a balancing of interests is required to determine a physician\u2019s obligations suggests that it is mistaken to believe that a general duty to treat despite conscience-based objections is derivable from an essentialist conception of the internal morality of medicine.5 Accordingly, that conception does not unequivocally support the incompatibility thesis.",

However, there does not appear to be such a tradition within Western medicine. Indirect evidence for this conclusion is provided by the medical profession\u2019s response to the Church Amendment (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300a-7), the first Federal \u201cconscience clause\u201d legislation. It was enacted by the U.S. Congress in the wake of the 1973 Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision affirming a Constitutional right to abortion and an earlier 1972 Federal District Court decision mandating a Catholic hospital to permit its facilities to be used for a sterilization procedure. The Church Amendment protects physicians who refuse to perform abortions and sterilizations for reasons of conscience. If permitting physicians to refuse to provide services that conflict with their religious and/or moral beliefs had represented a significant break with a time-honored moral tradition within medicine, considerable opposition would have been expected. However, the medical profession did not engage in an organized effort to prevent the legislation or to repeal it after it was enacted. On the contrary, as evidenced by numerous professional codes and guidelines enacted in ensuing years permitting physicians to refuse to provide services that violate their personal moral and/or religious beliefs, it seems that the medical profession tended to embrace conscientious objection (see, e.g., [20, 21]).",

Assuming physicians have an obligation to promote the health and well being of patients that may require some self-sacrifices, it remains to specify how much is required. From the general principle that some self-sacrifice is required, it may follow that physicians are required to incur increased risks from exposure to infectious diseases or bioterrorism agents. However, that principle fails to specify the level of risk that is required. Generally, it might be said that only a \u201creasonable\u201d risk is required, but it is then necessary to specify a criterion of reasonableness. Similarly, in the case of conscientious objection, the key question is: what is a \u201creasonable\u201d reciprocity-based requirement? It is arguable that a requirement to provide services even when a professional has a conscience-based objection to doing so is no more reasonable than a requirement that physicians treat patients no matter how high the risk of death due to epidemics or bioterrorism. It is also arguable that more reasonable reciprocity-based requirements would set limits to risks and would permit conscientious objection with procedural requirements to protect patients, such as advance notification and referral.
