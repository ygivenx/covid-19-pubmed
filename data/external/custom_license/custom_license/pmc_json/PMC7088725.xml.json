These properties have qualified these compounds to be widely used in various fields of applications, e.g., as organocatalysts for asymmetric allylation of aldehydes [1], as inhibitor of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase [2, 3], as antiviral agent against various SARS coronavirus strains [4], as antiadhesive and quorum-sensing inhibitor, and as antifungal agent [5]. Recent studies have shown that pyridine-N-oxide derivatives are genotoxic. The genotoxicity of this class of compounds is a consequence of damaging to DNA by affecting enzymes involved in DNA replication and the subsequent possible cell mutation which may lead to cancer [6]. Due to the conjugation of the nitro group with the N-oxide functional fragment 2- and 4-nitropyridine-N-oxides have been known as versatile intermediates in organic synthesis [7\u201311].",

The additional substitution of a ring hydrogen by a strong electronegative fluorine atom would certainly result in a sizable rearrangement of the electronic structure of the nitropyridine-N-oxide fragment. Depending on the relative positions of these electron withdrawing substituents to each other and to the N-oxide entity the impact of such kind of substitution on the reactivity of the entire molecule could be noticeable. Moreover, the insertion of the fluorine substituent to the nitropyridine-N-oxide leads to a marked distortion of the sterical arrangement of the nitro group and the ionicity of the N-oxide and N\u2013O bonds of nitro group. Because of the proximity of these multifunctional substituents to each other and due to the electronic mediation of the aromatic system both, the deviation of the NO2 and N-oxide groups from the co-planarity with the ring as well as the planarity of the heterocyclic ring itself are anticipated to be differently affected. The peculiar crowding of these particular substituents which are electronically coupled through the pyridine ring has qualified this class of multifunctional heteroarene compounds to become the focal point of interest for many researchers in different fields of applied sciences and technology. Nitro pyridine-N-oxides have been used in agriculture for plants growth rate regulation [12], in photonics like the design and development of new organic nonlinear optical (NLO) materials for frequency doubling by means of second-harmonic generation (SHG) [13\u201319].",

Interesting variations of the structural parameters of the stable rotamers, which correspond to minima on the predicted potential energy hypersurface, were observed. To ensure that these rotamers represent real minima but not saddle points on the potential energy surface we carried out frequency calculations (here and for all molecules occurring in this work) and only rotamers with no imaginary frequencies were considered. These stable out-of-plane rotamers result from a competing electronic interplay between the repulsive N-oxy and NO2 group interaction on one hand and the attractive N=O\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7H interaction on the other hand.",

            "text": "Our calculations have shown that surprisingly the insertion of the NO2 group in the ortho position to the N-oxide fragment has no significant effect on the structural parameters of pyridine-oxide (PO). By applying the MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ chemistry, we found that the N-oxide bond in 2-NPO shortens only by 0.006 \u00c5 (Table 1) in comparison to PO (this work, supporting information Table S1) and the ring N\u2013C2, C2\u2013C3, and C3\u2013C4 bonds shorten only by 0.003, 0.003, and 0.004 \u00c5, respectively (for atomic numbering see Fig. 1). The nitration of PO, however, exerts more distinct effect on the bonding angles. For instance the C2\u2013N1\u2013C6 angle narrows by 1.7\u00b0 and the N1\u2013C2\u2013C3 angles widens by approximately 2.7\u00b0 upon nitration of PO in ortho position. From Table 1 (in this table the Dunning\u2019s basis sets cc-pVDZ and cc-pVTZ are abbreviated as VDZ and VTZ and as AVDZ and AVTZ after their augmentation with diffuse functions), it can be seen that the values obtained from the density functional wave function are generally smaller by 0.005\u20130.01 \u00c5 than those provided by the MP2 method except for two cases, i.e., C2\u2013N8 and N1\u2013O7, where the values are slightly larger. The variations of the bond angles as obtained from both methods are almost negligible. Only the N1\u2013C2\u2013N8 bond angle widens by 3.3\u00b0 when B3LYP/AVDZ is used. The application of the density functional method provides a second stable rotamer in addition to that one shown in Table 1 with a positive low frequency in which the O\u2013N\u2013O plane is perpendicular to the ring plane. However, the energy difference between the two rotamers of 0.02 kcal mol\u22121 is almost negligible which indicates that the appearance of a second rotamer most likely is an artifact generated by the density functional wave function and is due to the quite flat potential minimum as it will be shown later in this work. Strikingly, the MP2/AVDZ method suggests an eclipsed arrangement for the C2\u2013N8 and N1\u2013O7 bonds in contrast to all other levels of theory in Table 1 which provide a dihedral angle N8\u2013C2\u2013N1\u2013O7 deviating from zero and the N8\u2013C2 and N1\u2013O7 bonds are no more co-planar. Maybe of interest to note that the total dipole moment of PO increases by about 3 Debye on nitration in ortho position (from 5.2 to 8.1 D for PO and 2-NPO, respectively) emphasizing the asymmetric distribution of charges within 2-NPO and its accentuated polarity.\n\n",

Similar trend was also suggested by the B3LYP/aug-cc-pVDZ (Table S3) and by applying the same wave functions in combination with the 6-311++G(d,p) basis set (Table 2). This weakening of the C\u2013NO2 bond lends 3-NPO higher reactivity, and thus particular importance for technical and chemical applications. It is generally accepted that the C\u2013NO2 bond and its properties play a prominent role by the determination of the impact sensitivity of energetic materials [26\u201328]. As a result of the strong electron withdrawal ability of the NO2 group, the angles including the anchor atoms widen substantially by approximately 3\u00b0 and the C2\u2013N1\u2013C6 angle increases by 2\u00b0 in 2-NPO and remains unchanged in 3-NPO and 4-NPO in comparison to PO. Finally, as a consequence of the proximity of the two electron-rich N-oxide and NO2 groups in 2-NPO and the resulting electrostatic repulsive interaction between these groups the NO2-plane adopt a perpendicular arrangement to the ring plane.",

Among the structures which these authors have optimized by applying B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) were 2-, 3-, and 4-nitropyridine-N-oxide. The endocyclic N1\u2013C2, N1\u2013C6, and the C\u2013NO2 bond lengths in these NPOs were found to be 1.374, 1.378, 1.472 \u00c5 in 2-NPO, 1.369, 1.377, 1.485 \u00c5 in 3-NPO, and 1.377, 1.377, 1.464 \u00c5 in 4-NPO, respectively (only these bond lengths were cited in this paper). A comparison of these values with those which have been produced by applying the MP2/6-311++G(d,p) method (Table 2) shows that the latter model chemistry predicts N1\u2013C2, N1\u2013C6 bond lengths which are longer by 0.010 and 0.012 \u00c5 in 2-NPO, 0.018, 0.015 \u00c5 in 3-NPO, and 0.011, 0.011 \u00c5 in 4-NPO. In contrast, the C\u2013NO2 bond length is shorter by 0.014, 0.007, and 0.002 \u00c5 in 2-NPO, 3-NPO, and 4-NPO, respectively. Similar result was obtained from the comparison of the computed structure of PNPO by applying B3LYP and MP2 wave functions in combination with the 6-311+G(d,p) basis set. As is evident from Table 2, the MP2/6-311+G(d,p) method provides a N1\u2013C2(6) bond length which is by 0.015 \u00c5 longer than that produced by the density functional method. However, the perturbation computational method suggests for the three C\u2013NO2 bond distances, C2(3)(4)\u2013NO2 values which are by 0.022, 0.020, and 0.019 \u00c5 shorter than it was predicted by the B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) levels. Interestingly, comparable behavior of the ring N\u2013C and C\u2013NO2 bond lengths was obtained by applying the MP2 and B3LYP wave functions in combination with Dunning aug-cc-pVDZ basis set (Table S3). It is worth to point out that the crowding of the electron-rich substituents in PNPO leads to an apparent deviation of the ring skeleton from planarity, which is manifested in the puckering amplitude value of Q = 0.028 \u00c5 (Table 2) and the dihedral angle N1\u2013C2\u2013C3\u2013C4 of 2.8\u00b0. Based on the above-demonstrated dependency of the C\u2013NO2 bond length on the employed level of theory, it is worth to indicate that using the computed lengthening of the C\u2013NO2 bond (and thus its weakening) is not primarily appropriate criterion for the determination of the impact sensitivity of energetic materials.",

A comparison between the calculated structural parameters which we obtained from the MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ method with the experimentally determined values [30] reveals that the experimental values are quite unreasonable. So for instance, the electron diffraction study provided 1.281(22) and 1.469(66) \u00c5 for the N\u2013O and C2\u2013N1 bond distances, whereas our calculations predict 1.267 and 1.391 \u00c5. Particularly striking is the C\u2013NO2 bond length of 1.628(13) \u00c5 versus our calculated value of 1.461 \u00c5. All these evident discrepancies indicate that the experimental study of the structure of 4-NPO needs to be revisited. In the same electron diffraction investigation, the molecular structure of 4-chloropyridine-N-oxide (4-ClPO) was determined as well. The optimized structure 4-ClPO (MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ was used) revealed that reasonable agreement between the observed N-oxide bond length of 1.262(25) \u00c5 and the calculated value of 1.269 \u00c5 exists but a significant disagreement for all other structural parameters (differences of \u00b10.03 to \u00b10.05 \u00c5 for the bond lengths and up to 5\u00b0 for the bond angles) is apparent which also necessitates the experimental reinvestigation of this molecule.",

Numerous papers have been published over the last four decades in which the reasons for the remarkable properties of nitropyridine-N-oxides and their derivatives have been investigated. Mainly intramolecular interactions of various kinds and charge redistribution as a result of substitution have been made accountable for their chemical reactivity, remarkable magnetic and optical properties, and versatile biological activity. However, to the best of our knowledge never before has the contribution of the non-planarity of these heteroaromatics been considered for the elucidation of these particular properties. We strongly believe that the enforced disruption of the planarity of these heterocyclic compounds and the resulting extra strain play a prominent role by the enhancement of the chemical and biological activity of this class of molecules, e.g., impact sensitivity for characterizing high energy density materials and genotoxicity.",

Such an effect is likely to anticipate since the charge shift towards the fluorine atom and its ability to hyperconjugate with the aromatic ring system by donating lone pair electrons into adjacent antibonding orbital (negative hyperconjugative interaction) and to exert exchange repulsive interaction (Pauli-repulsion) would contribute to pronounced charge density redistribution within the 2-NPO molecular system.

The largest variation of 0.009 \u00c5 is attributed to the C3\u2013C4 bond length in 2-NPO-3-F and 2-NPO-4-F. On the other hand, while the C\u2013F bond in 2-NPO-4-F and 2-NPO-5-F lengthens by 0.007 and 0.005 \u00c5 in comparison to 2-NPO-3-F, this bond shortens significantly by 0.019 \u00c5 in 2-NPO-6-F. Obviously, this latter bond contraction is due to hyperconjugative interactions with the neighboring N-oxide fragment. For the same reason while the expected shortening of the C\u2013F bond is almost negligible upon the progressive fluorine substitution in meta and para positions in 2-nitro-3,4,5,6-tetrafluoropyridine-N-oxide (2-NPO-F4) this shortening becomes notable (0.016 \u00c5) for the C\u2013F bond in ortho position.

In this context, it is worth to indicate that the values of the exocyclic bond angles involving the fluorine substituent (Table 3) show that there is an attractive interaction between the fluorine atom and the nitro group in 3-NPO-3-F and rather more accentuated attractive interaction between the fluorine substituent and the N-oxide oxygen in 2-NPO-6-F and 2-NPO-F4. In these instances where the F\u2026O distance is between 2.6 and 3.3 \u00c5, it appears that the attractive fluorine\u2013oxygen dispersion interaction is the predominant effect in comparison to the repulsive Pauli exchange interaction. This finding is in agreement with the very recently discussed importance of the dispersion energy by the stabilization of large molecules by means of intramolecular dispersion interaction between, e.g., functional groups [31]. Another intriguing feature is that the geometrical parameters of the nitro group in all fluorinated compounds which are shown in Table 3 are insensitive to the charge density variation of the heterocyclic ring as a consequence of the charge withdrawal by the fluorine atoms. The opening of the endocyclic angles involving the anchor atoms for the fluorine substitution can be explained by invoking the \u03c3-electron withdrawing ability of the fluorine substituent.",

From the comparison of structural parameters of 2-NPO-Cl4 and 2-NPO-F4, it emerges that the N1\u2013C6, C3\u2013C4, C4\u2013C5, and C5\u2013C6 are by 0.016, 0.013, 0.012, and 0.013 \u00c5, respectively, longer in the former than in the latter compound. It is also worth to note that the NO2 plane in 2-NPO-6-Cl is perpendicular to the ring plane which is in contrast to the arrangement of the nitro group in the corresponding fluoro compound (Table 3). All these structural trends have also been reproduced by applying the B3LYP wave function and the Gaussian basis set 6-311++G(df,pd).",

            "text": "In a further attempt to separate the concerted effects of the fluorine and nitro group on the geometrical parameters of the pyridine-N-oxide skeleton and to learn more about the effective role of the nitro group by the charge redistribution within the ring skeleton we studied the structures of 2-fluoro-, 3-fluoro, 4-fluoro-, 3,4,5,6-tetrafluoro-, and penta-fluoro-pyridine-N-oxide. Table 4 summarizes the most important structural parameters of these fluorinated pyridine-N-oxides as suggested by the MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ calculations. From the comparison of Tables 3 and 4, it emerges that the absence of the nitro group has almost negligible effect on the ring bond distances. Conspicuously is that the N-oxide as well as the C\u2013F bond lengths in all nitrated homologues are by 0.004 to 0.008 \u00c5 shorter than the corresponding bonds in the fluoro pyridine-N-oxide counterparts. In contrast to the bond lengths the endocyclic bond angles vary more significantly and non-uniform in both series. The largest variations show the angles N1\u2013C2\u2013C3 and C2\u2013C3\u2013C4. For instance, the N1\u2013C2\u2013C3 angle in 2-NPO-3-F is by 2.5\u00b0 larger and the C2\u2013C3\u2013C4 angle is by 2.0\u00b0 smaller than in 3-F-PO. Similarly, the former angle widens by 2.4\u00b0 and the latter one narrows by 1.6\u00b0 on moving from 2-NPO-6-F to 6-F-PO. Moreover, we note that the nitration of the fluoro-pyridine-N-oxides leads to the anticipated increase of the molecular dipole moment and the largest increase of 3.6 D occurs on going from 3-F-PO to 2-NPO-3-F.\n",

From Table 5, it is apparent that the insertion of the nitro group in ortho position to the N-oxide moiety results in a withdrawal of charges from the ring atoms and the N-oxide oxygen. The substitution of hydrogens in different positions of 2-NPO by a fluorine atom does not show a clear systematic variation of the charge distribution in this diversity of fluoro 2-NPO compounds. The reason for that could be the alteration of the charge distribution within the ring represents a compromise between two competing effects of substituents: the strong negative inductive and resonance effects of the nitro group (increased electron density in meta position) and the negative inductive and positive resonance effects of the fluorine atom (higher electron density in ortho and para positions). The largest loss of charges, however, shows the C6 atom of +0.63 e\u2212 (+0.61 e\u2212 as produced by MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ, Table S5) in 2-NPO-6-F. Also in this compound, the charge of the N1 atom of +0.007 e\u2212 (+0.03 e\u2212) is close to neutrality and the N-oxide bond possesses a distinct polarity within this series of fluorinated 2-NPOs. As a result the N1\u2013O7 and the C\u2013F bonds of 1.259 and 1.332 \u00c5 (Table 3), respectively, are the shortest within the monofluorinated compounds. By applying the MP2/6-311++G(df,pd) computational method, these bond lengths are even shorter and amount to 1.246 and 1.307 \u00c5.\n\n",

For instance, in contrast to the NPA, the MPA suggests negatively charged hydrogen atoms and positive charges on the carbon atoms. Moreover, regardless the significant differences in the evaluation of the charge distribution by both methods, the MPA seems to overestimate the charge depletion and concentration between atoms in a bond. For example in 2-NPO-4-F, the MPA predicts charges of +0.24 on N1 and \u22120.78 on O7, while the NPA suggests +0.04 and \u22120.52 e\u2212 on these atoms, and thus different degree of bond polarity. By using different wave functions (B3LYP, HF, MP2) and the basis sets (6-311++G(df,pd) and aug-cc-pVDZ) to examine the dependency of both the NPA and Mulliken charge distribution on the level of theory, we found that the MPA provides inconsistent, and in some cases unreasonably fluctuating charge distribution. Most remarkably the MPA at the B3LYP/6-311++G(df,pd) level predicts for the NO2 group negative charges on nitrogen and positive charges on the oxygen atoms (Table S7) leading to a bond polarity of the type: O+\u2013N\u2212\u2013O+. However, by using the HF/6-311++G(df,pd) method, it provides negative charges on nitrogen as well as on the oxygens (Table S8).

Adding a fluorine substituent next to the nitro group, 2-NPO-3-F, leads to an additional loss of the ring charges by 0.533 e\u2212, and thus the net charge of the ring becomes positive.

The considerable increase of the positive charges of the ring of Q\nring = +1.84 e\u2212 in 2-NPO-F4 was obviously expected due to the appreciable electron withdrawal by the four fluorine atoms. Such kind of consideration is also valid for the tetrafluoro PO.\n",

Table 7 shows that substantial variation of the Q\nring value by the nitration or fluorination of PO in ortho position to the N-oxide fragment occurs. It is also worth noting that the largest loss of ring charges within the monofluorinated derivatives occurs on going from PO to 2-NPO-4-F, where \u0394Q\nring is 0.91 e\u2212, and the smallest loss of charges emerges upon moving from PO to 2-NPO-6-F, where \u0394Q\nring amounts to 0.88 e\u2212. This is because of the fluorine hyperconjugative effect and the increase of the charge density in ortho position and the higher electronegativity of the oxygen atom. From Table 7, it can be seen that the fluorination of PO leads to a significant loss of ring charges ranging from 0.558 e\u2212 in the case of 4-F-PO to 0.529 e\u2212 in 6-F-PO. The nitration of PO in ortho position results in a decrease of the ring charges by only 0.353 e\u2212. Obviously the insertion of four fluorine substituents to PO and 2-NPO results in a considerable loss of ring charges of \u0394Q\nring = 2.18 e\u2212 and 2.17 e\u2212, respectively. This result is somehow intriguing because the alteration of Q\nring upon fluorination is almost the same in both cases regardless the nitration of PO in ortho position.",

Nevertheless, the barrier heights at \u03b3 = 0\u00b0 and \u03b3 = 90\u00b0 drop from 2.27 to 0.23 and from 1.52 to 0.99 kcal mol\u22121 upon using the HF instead of the MP2 wave function. Employing the B3LYP wave function, however, leads to an inversion of the barrier heights at \u03b3 = 0\u00b0 and \u03b3 = 90\u00b0 which means that in contrast to above mentioned methods the density functional method predicts a barrier at \u03b3 = 90\u00b0 which is by 0.9 kcal mol\u22121 higher than that at \u03b3 = 0\u00b0. Likewise, the application of the same wave functions in combination with the Pople double-zeta basis set for scanning the NO2 rotational potential function provides analogous trend. Interestingly, similar dependency of the NO2 torsional potential function on the applied wave function was obtained for various fluorinated 2-NPOs whose NO2 torsional potential functions exhibit two distinctive energy maxima at \u03b3 = 0\u00b0 and \u03b3 = 90\u00b0, i.e., 2-NPO-4-F, 2-NPO-5-F, and 2-NPO-6-F (Figs. 4, 5). The application of the MP2/cc-pVDZ computational method predicts potential barriers for the NO2 internal rotation in these compounds (Fig. 4c, e, 5a) of 1.22, 1.41, 1.39 kcal mol\u22121 at \u03b3 = 0\u00b0 and 1.10, 1.12, and 1.11 kcal mol\u22121 at \u03b3 = 90\u00b0. For comparison, the B3LYP/cc-pVDZ method suggests barrier heights of 0.49, 0.51, and 0.66 kcal mol\u22121 at \u03b3 = 0\u00b0 and 1.45, 1.88, and 1.42 kcal mol\u22121 at \u03b3 = 90\u00b0. In conclusion, the barrier heights at \u03b3 = 0\u00b0 and \u03b3 = 90\u00b0 undergo an inversion upon the alteration of the wave function (and a slight shift of the potential minima) which parallels the behavior of the potential barriers in 2-NPO. It remains to point out that using Pople\u2019s triple-zeta basis set along with the MP2 and B3LYP wave functions for scanning the NO2 rotational potential barriers has shown that only in the case of 2-NPO-5-F (not in 2-NPO-4-F and 2-NPO-6-F) such an inversion of the barrier heights occurs (Fig. 4e).\n\n",

However, in the case of 2-NPO-3-F, the potential function shows a distinctive minimum at \u03b3 = 90\u00b0 (Fig. 4b). From this comparison, it can be concluded that the nitro group in both instances, where either the fluorine substituent is absent (2-NPO) or is not in ortho position to the nitro group (2-NPO-6-F), this group performs a large amplitude motion, which is manifested by the flat broad minimum as Figs. 3d and 5b demonstrate. On the other hand, the seemingly attractive interaction between the nitro group and the fluorine atom in 2-NPO-3-F suppresses such large amplitude motion which is evident from the sharp potential minimum at \u03b3 = 90\u00b0.",

            "text": "Assuming that steric interactions and intramolecular hydrogen bonding do not play a prominent role by the determination of rotational barriers in the investigated 2-NPOs, it can be postulated that the shorter the C\u2013NO2 bond (the larger the bond strength), the higher is the barrier for internal rotation of the nitro group. Chen et al. [46, 47] and others [48] have found that such correlation is excellently applicable to a variety of aromatic nitro compounds. This correlation seems to be invalid for the series of heteroaromatics which we presented in this work. From Table 3, it is evident that the C\u2013NO2 bond length varies only marginally within the fluoronitropyridine-N-oxides, but on the other side, the potential barriers for the NO2 internal rotation fluctuate over a wide scale of potential energy no matter which computational method is used. For instance, by applying MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ the potential barrier at \u03b3 = 0\u00b0 varies between 1.9 kcal mol\u22121 for 2-NPO-4-F and 7.6 kcal mol\u22121 for 2-NPO-3-F (Fig. 4b, d). Further, MP2/6-311++G(df,pd) predicts a variation of this barriers ranging from 3.2 kcal mol\u22121 in 2-NPO-4-F to 8.5 kcal mol\u22121 in 2-NPO-3-F, whereas the alteration of the C\u2013NO2 bond length within these fluorinated 2-NPOs amounts only to \u00b10.001 \u00c5. One conceivable interpretation of this striking behavior is that the barrier heights for the internal rotation of the nitro group in the fluorinated heterocyclic series depends on the proximity or remoteness of the fluorine substituent to the nitro or the N-oxide fragment. These barriers are predominantly governed either by attractive intramolecular fluorine\u2013oxygen dispersion interaction or O\u22efH hydrogen bonding but less by mesomeric or hyperconjugative interactions and an increase of the C\u2013NO2 bond strength.",

For instance, a comparison between the profiles of the potential function for 2-NPO and 2-NPO-3-F as predicted by the MP2/cc-pVDZ method reveals that the potential barrier at \u03b3 = 0\u00b0 grows noticeably by 4.2 kcal mol\u22121 and the barrier at \u03b3 = 90\u00b0 lowers by 0.8 kcal mol\u22121. By using the 6-311G(df,pd) basis set, the barrier at \u03b3 = 0\u00b0 and \u03b3 = 90\u00b0 increases by 4.8 and decreases by 0.3 kcal mol\u22121, respectively. Adding diffuse functions to these basis sets leads to rather higher potential barrier at \u03b3 = 0\u00b0 (Figs. 3b, d, 4b). Similar decisive effect of the fluorination on the potential energy barriers is apparent from the consideration of 2-NPO-F4. The tetrafluorination of 2-NPO elevates the barrier for internal rotation of the NO2 moiety at \u03b3 = 0\u00b0 by 3.5 kcal mol\u22121 and reduces this barrier at \u03b3 = 90\u00b0 by 0.7 kcal mol\u22121 when MP2/cc-pVDZ was used.

We also analyzed the delocalization energies as estimated by the second-order perturbation theory (SOPT) in the NBO space.

Perhaps the most essential features which have been provided by this analysis were the demonstration of the prominent role of the lone pair electrons by the determination of the structure and rotamers stability of the fluorinated 2-NPOs under consideration and thus of their potential energy function. In this context, it is worth to note that in all these compounds, the lone electron pair orbitals (n\n\u03c02) on the oxygen atoms in the N-oxide and NO2 groups have the lowest orbital charge population and, therefore, the most significant deviation from the idealized Lewis occupancy. For instance, the n\n\u03c02 orbitals on the N-oxide oxygen, O7, are occupied by 1.62, 1.65, 1.58, 1.63, and 1.63 electrons (at the B3LYP/6-311++G(df,pd) level) in 2-NPO-3-F, 2-NPO-4-F, 2-NPO-5-F, 2-NPO-6-F, and 2-NPO-F4, respectively, which is way off from the Lewis occupancy.

A comparison of the Lewis energy for the ideally localized structure, E\nL, and the electronic delocalization energy, E\nNL, for 2-NPO-5-F with those of the remaining monofluorinated 2-NPOs [E\nL (or E\nNL) (2-NPO-5-F) \u2212 E\nL (or E\nNL) (2-NPO-x-F)] has revealed that the energy difference, \u0394(E\nL), for 2-NPO-3-F, 2-NPO-4-F, and 2-NPO-6-F amounts to \u221210.3, \u2212136.8, \u221230.0 kcal mol\u22121 and \u0394(E\nNL) is 7.6, 136.5, 27.4 kcal mol\u22121, respectively. From these \u0394(E\nL) and \u0394(E\nNL) values, it can be concluded that the Lewis energy E\nL favors 2-NPO-5-F over all other monofluorinated 2-NPOs which implies that electrostatic and exchange repulsion interactions are predominant in this molecule. Consideration of the \u0394(E\nNL) discloses that 2-NPO-4-F is mainly stabilized by the delocalization of occupied NBOs into vacant antibonding orbitals. Interestingly, parallel trends have been observed for the chlorinated 2-NPOs.\n",

As it can be seen from Table 9, the deletion of all fluorine hyperconjugative interactions in 2-NPO-3-F leads to the highest electronic delocalization energy, E\ndel, of 150.5 kcal mol\u22121. The smallest E\ndel value of 107 kcal. mol\u22121 (which represents 7.5 % of the total deletion energy that was obtained by using the NOSTAR deletion option) emerges by switching off all fluorine donor\u2013acceptor interactions in 2-NPO-4-F. This peculiar small contribution of the fluorine hyperconjugative interaction to the total delocalization energy manifests that 2-NPO-4-F is mostly stabilized by the donor\u2013acceptor interactions of the remaining NBOs in addition to \u03c0-delocalization (conjugation) and dispersion interactions. From Table 9, it can be concluded that generally the fluorine Lewis\u2013non-Lewis interactions play only a moderate role by the stabilization of the listed 2-NPOs except in the case of 2-NPO-F4. In this case, the contribution of the fluorines hyperconjugative stabilizing interactions to the total non-Lewis energy E\nNL (=E\ndel) amounts to approximately 30 % of the total deletions energy on zeroing all donor\u2013acceptor natural orbital interactions.",

In addition, changes in charge density distribution, \u03c1(r), mirror the effects of substituents and thus the variation of the Laplacian of the charge density, \u22072\n\u03c1(r\nc) (which is the algebraic sum of the three eigenvalues, \u03bb\n1, \u03bb\n2, \u03bb\n3 of the charge density at a bond point), allows for a three dimensional representation of these effects. Table 10 summarizes some topological properties of \u03c1(r) (atomic units are used), which we obtained from the AIM analysis for pyridine, pyridine-N-oxide, and 2-NPO.

The NBO analysis has shown that the C\u2013NO2 bond is mainly stabilized by the \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\left( {n_{\\uppi 1} } \\right)_{{{\\text{O}}_{ 9 , 1 0} }} \\to \\upsigma_{{{\\text{C}}_{ 2} - {\\text{N}}_{ 8} }}^{*}$$\\end{document} orbital interactions. Now, a consideration of the AIM results in Table 11 reveals that remarkably the charge density distribution at BCP of the C2\u2013N8 bond remains unaffected by the fluorination in all fluoro 2-NPOs. The small value of the charge density of 0.27e/a\n03 (1.82 e\u00c5\u22123) and the relatively low value of the Laplacian distribution of \u22120.76 to \u22120.78 e/a\n05 (\u221218.3 to \u221218.8 e\u00c5\u22125) at the BCP of the C\u2013NO2 bond in all fluorinated 2-NPOs indicate that the charges in the C\u2013NO2 bonds are appreciably depleted which is a clear evidence for the accentuated weakness of this bond in comparison to all other bonds in the fluoro 2-NPO series. In addition, the anisotropic charge distribution in these N=O bonds mirrored by the deviation of the ellipticity values from the typical value for a cylindrical charge distribution demonstrates the \u03c0 character of this bond. From the aforementioned, it becomes apparent that all 2-NPOs (fluorinated and non-fluorinated) exhibit C\u2013NO2 bonding properties, which classify them to be potential energetic materials. They possess a weak C\u2013NO2 bond that is ready to rupture upon exposure to an external shock which confers such kind of material higher impact sensitivity. Besides, it should be noted that more accurate assessment of the impact sensitivity of the 2-NPOs presented in this work could be achieved by investigating the electrostatic potentials formed by the nuclei and electrons on the surface of a molecule. Such correlation between the impact sensitivity and the electrostatic potential has been excessively studied by Politzer et al. [65, 66].",

It is somehow surprising that the values of the charge densities remain almost constant at the BCPs which denotes that the C\u2013F bond strength in these fluorinated 2-NPOs is apparently independent of its position on the heteroaromatic ring. This finding is reflected by the similar values of the C\u2013F bond length in these 2-NPOs (Table 3). The slightly increase of the charge accumulation at the BCP of the C6\u2013F bond in 2-NPO-6-F and 2-NPO-F4 in comparison to the C\u2013F bond in the remaining fluoro 2-NPOs (Table 11) and the mixing of \u03c0 character as a result of fluorine lone pair donation in this bonding orbitals justify the strengthening of this bond. As it was shown above in this work (Table 3) the C6\u2013F bond length in these two fluorinated 2-NPOs is significantly shorter than the C\u2013F bonds in the remaining fluoro 2-NPOs which confirms this way of elucidation.",

These values also reveal that the 2-NPO-F4 exposes the largest aromatic character followed by 2-NPO-5-F, 2-NPO-3-F, 2-NPO-6-F, and 2-NPO-4-F, respectively. As Table 12 additionally shows the non-fluorinated compounds, pyridine-N-oxide and 2-NPO, exhibit almost the same degree of aromaticity as in pyridine indicating the little influence of the diatropicity of pyridine ring by N-oxidation and nitration in ortho position. A comparison of the NICS(1) values for the fluorinated 2-NPO and pyridine-N-oxides (POs) shows that the nitro group leads to a slight increase of the electron delocalization and thus to higher aromatic character (diatropicity) of the fluorinated pyridine-N-oxides. One exception within this series of compounds is provided by the fluorination in ortho position where the NICS(1) value slightly decreases (by 0.6 ppm) upon nitration. However, it should be noted that all differences of the NICS(1) value which are less than 1 ppm are marginal and lie within the uncertainty limits of these values. Aside from that, the NICS index has generally proven to be to some extent dependent on the computational level of theory. For example although the trend of the NICS(1) values which have been obtained from the B3LYP/6-311++G(df,pd) (Table S14) is roughly consistent with the HF/6-311++G(df,pd) results, however, the density functional method predicts a decrease of the aromaticity of the pyridine ring upon N-oxidation (NICS(1) for pyridine is \u221210.4 and for pyridine-N-oxide \u22128.8) and a slight increase of the aromaticity of pyridine-N-oxide on nitration in ortho position to the N-oxide group (Table S14).\n",

            "text": "Without going into further details, it is of importance to note that in a vast number of papers it has been elaborately shown that (depending on the size of the ring) the in-plane aromaticity which is indicated by the isotropic NICS(0) value contains considerable contribution of in-plane \u03c3-aromaticity resulting from the diamagnetic shielding of the \u03c3 electronic framework. Although the NICS(1) value is a better descriptor of the \u03c0 contribution to aromaticity due to the apparent decrease of the local contributions of the \u03c3 framework at larger distances from the ring center, however, this value is still related to the total isotropic shielding and thus is contaminated by \u03c3 contributions. A largely separation of the \u03c3 aromaticity from the out-of-plane \u03c0 aromaticity was achieved by the introduction of new NICS descriptor which considers the out-of-plane zz components of the shielding tensor elements at a certain distance n in \u00c5 above the ring plane designated as NICS(n)zz. NICS(1)zz is defined as the MO contribution to the zz component of the shielding tensor perpendicular to the ring plane. Since this NICSzz index still incorporates some non-\u03c0 contributions a new more specific measure for the pure \u03c0-aromaticty was introduced (NICS\u03c0zz) which takes into account only the \u03c0 contributions to the out-of-plane NICS tensor component arising from the canonical molecular orbitals with \u03c0 character [69, 70]. However, on various occasions it has been pointed out that NICS(1)zz is easily computable and is an excellently performing aromaticity descriptor. Therefore, it represents an adequate substitute for NICS\u03c0zz [70]. Moreover, recently it was also shown that the NICS(1)zz value denotes the highest degree of aromaticity for aromatic systems [71]. Based on these observations we focused on the NICS(1)zz index to elucidate the variation of the degree of aromaticity in all fluorinated and non-fluorinated 2-NPOs and pyridine-N-oxides. Assuming that the non-planarity of some of the compounds which are displayed in Table 12 has only marginal effect on the NICSzz tensor component perpendicular to the ring plane, the following conclusions can be derived from the evaluation of the NICS(1)zz values for these compounds: (a) An apparent reduction of the degree of \u03c0 aromaticity upon N-oxidation and nitration of pyridine is indicated by the less negative values of NICSzz. (b) The fluorination of 2-NPO in 3 and 4 positions has no influence on the aromaticity of this molecule. (c) The fluorination in para position to the nitro group exhibits the highest degree of aromaticity within the fluorinated 2-NPOs indicating the largest \u03c0 electron delocalization and the para directionality of the fluorine substituent. (d) There is almost no difference between the aromaticity of 2-NPO-6-F and 2-NPO-F4 which may be interpreted in terms of charge delocalization in these two molecules that is predominantly caused by the fluorine substituent in ortho position to the N-oxide moiety.",

On the other hand, while the C\u2013F bond in 2-NPO-3-F, 2-NPO-4-F, and 2-NPO-5-F remains essentially unaffected this bond shortens significantly by 0.019 \u00c5 in 2-NPO-6-F. This bond contraction is due to hyperconjugative interactions with the neighboring N-oxide fragment which has been confirmed by the NBO analysis and the delocalization energy calculated by SOPT.A large variety of NPOs with different kinds of substituents like F, Cl, CH3 and additional NO2 groups has been examined in order to get more insight into the reasons leading to the alteration of the structure, aromaticity and the intramolecular stabilizing or destabilizing interactions between substituent/heteroaromatic ring and between substituents themselves including the N-oxide fragment.Analogous to the known relationship between the total Mulliken charges of the NO2 group, \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$Q_{{{\\text{NO}}_{ 2} }}$$\\end{document}, and the conformational stability and structures of a variety of nitrobenzene derivatives, we introduced the corresponding total charges for the pyridine ring, (Q\nring), and methyl group (\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$Q_{{{\\text{CH}}_{ 3} }}$$\\end{document}). For forming these total charges, we used the less basis set-dependent natural charges. It was shown that the group charges, Q, are basically indicative for occurring electronic effects, but they do not provide indications of directionality of substitution on the heteroaromatic ring since due to their inductive or resonance effects and their relative positions to each other. All these factors may lead to additive or opposing subtracting effects which dictate the reactivity of ring in the NPOs molecular systems and its readiness for electrophilic or nucleophilic attack.This work has also shown that the variation of the basis set and its augmentation with diffuse functions (and in some instances the alteration of the wave function as well) has tremendous impact on the profile, conformational stability and the barrier height for internal rotation of the NO2 group. The computational results clearly demonstrate that particular caution should be exercised when investigating energy minima on the potential energy hypersurface by performing quantum mechanical calculations and applying various basis sets (and wave functions) at different levels of theory.Not only the size of the selected basis set has profound influence on the potential barrier for internal rotation of the nitro group but also the fluorine substitution. Hyperconjugative interactions as well as electrostatic and Pauli-exchange repulsive interactions (steric effects) are accountable for the alteration of the potential barrier within the fluorinated heteroaromatics which have been presented in this study.Switching off all antibonding and Rydberg off-diagonal Fock-matrix elements (NOSTAR deletion) in the NBO space has revealed that 2-NPO-5-F is the most stable molecule among the monofluorinated 2-NPOs. From the \u0394(E\nL) values for the variety of fluorinated 2-NPOs, it was concluded that the Lewis energy E\nL favors 2-NPO-5-F over the other homologues. Consideration of \u0394(E\nNL) values revealed that 2-NPO-4-F is mainly stabilized by the delocalization of occupied NBOs into vacant antibonding orbitals. Interestingly, parallel trends have been observed for the chlorinated 2-NPOs.One of the focal points of this study was the scrutiny of the C\u2013NO2 bond in the fluorinated and non-fluorinated 2-NPOs. As generally accepted, this bond plays a key role by the determination of the impact sensitivity of energetic [26\u201328] and genotoxic [6] materials. The NBO analysis has shown that the C\u2013NO2 bond is mainly stabilized by the \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\left( {n_{\\uppi 1} } \\right)_{{{\\rm O}_{9,10}}} \\to \\upsigma_{{{\\text{C}}_{2} - {\\text{N}}_{8} }}^{*}$$\\end{document} orbital interactions. From the AIM results in Table 11, it was apparent that the charges in the C\u2013NO2 bond in all fluorinated 2-NPOs are appreciably depleted which is a clear evidence for the accentuated weakness of this bond. From these results, it became apparent that all 2-NPOs (fluorinated and non-fluorinated) exhibit particular C\u2013NO2 bonding properties which classify them to be potential energetic materials (with high impact sensitivity).and perhaps biologically active agents.Our calculations showed that the C\u2013NO2 bond length is fairly dependent on the employed level of theory; therefore, it is not appropriate to consider the computed C\u2013NO2 bond length for the assessment of the impact sensitivity of energetic materials. Also the known correlation between the C-NO2 bond length and the barrier height for internal rotation of the nitro group (the shorter this bond the higher is the potential barrier) should be considered with caution (at least in similar heteroaromatics presented in this work).Finally, two essential remarks have to be made concerning the topological properties of the charge density distribution and the various conclusions which have been derived from them: (1) The classification of bonds in shared interactions (covalent bond) and closed-shell interactions (polar or ionic bonds) and the consideration of the bond ellipticity as a measure for the extent of the \u03c0 character contribution to a bond are not strictly direct consequences of the AIM quantum theory but only based on trends observed in the results which were obtained from a large number of theoretical calculations [64]. (2) These properties are inconsistent upon the variation of the level of the computational method in use.\n",
