In 1980 [1] advised a prenatal genetic test for Thalassemia that was not based on DNA sequencing, but on restriction enzymes that cut DNA at specific short sequences, creating various bands of DNA strand depending upon the presence of allele (genetic variation). In the 1980s, the term \u201cMolecular Diagnostics\u201d was utilized in the names of companies such as Molecular Diagnostics Incorporated and Bethesda Research Laboratories Molecular Diagnostics [2]. The 1990s saw an era of identification of newly discovered genes and new techniques for DNA sequencing. This led to the emergence of a distinct field of molecular and genomic laboratory medicine; in 1995, the Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP) was formed to give it structure. In 1999, the AMP co-founded The Journal of Medical Diagnostics; Informa Healthcare launched Expert Reviews in Medical Diagnostics in 2001 [3]. From 2002 onwards, the Hap Map Project combined information on the one-letter genetic differences that recur in the human population, as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and also pointed their relationship with disease. In 2012, molecular diagnostic techniques for Thalassemia use genetic hybridization tests to recognize the specific SNP causing an individual\u2019s disease.\n",

It is a robust technique as a large amount of copies of the target sequence generated by its exponential amplification, permiting the identification of a known mutation within a single day, rather than months. With the advent of PCR, molecular diagnostics to cross the threshold of the clinical laboratory for the provision of genetic services, such as carrier or population screening for known mutations, prenatal diagnosis of inherited diseases, or in recent years, identification of unknown mutations. Therefore, being moved to their proper environment, the clinical laboratory, and molecular diagnostics could provide the services for which they have been initially considered. Each PCR cycle theoretically doubles the amount of specific DNA sequence present resulting in an exponential accumulation of the DNA fragment being amplified. PCR is an enzyme-driven, primer-mediated (forward and reverse primer), temperature-dependent process for replicating a specific DNA sequence in vitro. The principle of PCR is based on the repetitive cycling of three simple reactions of amplification that include: (1) Denaturing: At 95 \u00b0C template DNA double strand separates into two single strands. (2) Annealing: Next the temperature is reduced to 55 \u00b0C and two specific oligonucleotide primers attach to the DNA template complementarily. (3) Extension: The temperature is then raised again but this time to 72 \u00b0C, facilitating the DNA polymerase to extend the primers at the 3\u2032 terminus of each primer and synthesize the complementary strands along 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 terminus of each template DNA using deoxynucleotides contained in media.",

Here two or more primer pairs are included in one reaction tube and two or more DNA templates are targeted simultaneously. It is a relatively effortless molecular way to detect few different bacteria in one PCR reaction. In multiplex PCR, the primer pairs should be specific to the target gene and the PCR products (amplicons) should be in different sizes that are specific to different DNA sequences. This technique saves time and reagents by targeting multiple genes at a time, therefore extra information may be gained from a single test-run that otherwise would require several times the reagents and more time to perform. Annealing temperatures for each of the primer sets must be optimized to work correctly within a single reaction, and amplicon sizes. That is, their base pair length should be different enough to form distinct bands when visualized by gel electrophoresis.",

This is the most valuable and sensitive technique for mRNA detection and quantitation that is currently available. RT-PCR is mostly used to detect viruses and the viability of microbial cells through the assessment of microbial mRNA. The discovery of PCR also has provided the foundations for the design and development of many mutation detection schemes, based on amplified DNA. In general, PCR either is used for the generation of the DNA fragments to be examined, or is part of the recognition method. The first attempt was the use of restriction enzymes [6] or oligonucleotide probes, immobilized onto membranes or in solution [7] in order to spot the existing genetic variation, in particular the sickle cell disease-causing mutation. In the following years, an even larger number of mutation detection approaches have been build up and implemented. RT-PCR may be single step or two step procedure. As the name suggests single step RT-PCR shall combines first-strand cDNA synthesis (RT) and subsequent PCR in a single reaction tube. This technique requires gene specific primer and is useful in high throughput applications. However it is less sensitive and efficient since the reaction is a compromise between reverse transcription and amplification conditions. Two step PCR requires two steps\u2014first one for the synthesis of c-DNA in a PCR tube followed by second step in a separate PCR tube for amplification of gene of interest. This technique is more sensitive, flexible and allows analysis of multiple genes.",

It exploits the alterations in restriction enzyme sites, leading to the gain or loss of restriction events [6]. Since then a number of enzymatic approaches for mutation detection have been conceived, based on the dependence of a secondary structure on the primary DNA sequence. These methods utilize the activity of resolvase enzymes T4 endonuclease VII, and more recently, T7 endonuclease I to digest heteroduplex DNA formed by annealing wild type and mutant DNA [9]. Mutations are indicated by the size of the various fragments. A variation of the theme involves the use of chemical agents for the same purpose [10]. Another enzymatic approach for mutation detection is the oligonucleotide ligation assay [11]. This technique involves the hybridization of two oligonucleotides to complementary DNA stretches at sites of possible mutations. The oligonucleotide primers are designed such that the 3\u2033 end of the first primer is immediately adjacent to the 5\u2033 end of the second primer. Therefore, if the first primer matches completely with the target DNA, then the primers can be ligated by DNA ligase. On the other hand, if a mismatch occurs at the 3\u2033 end of the first primer, then no ligation products will be obtained.",

This technique usually involves hybridization of DNA with target molecule, for quantitative (gene expression) or qualitative (diagnostic) analysis of large numbers of genes simultaneously or to genotype multiple regions of a genome. Each DNA spot contains approx. picomoles (10\u221212 mol) of a specific DNA sequence, known as probes (or reporters). There has been a tremendous improvement in the microarray technology in terms of efficiency, discriminatory power, reproducibility, sensitivity and specificity due to advances in fabrication, robotics, and bioinformatics, these improvements have allowed the transition of microarrays from strictly research bench site to bed site in clinical diagnostic applications. Microarrays can be differentiated on the basis of characteristics such as the nature of the probe, the solid-surface support used, and the specific method used for probe addressing and/or target detection.",

In-situ synthesized arrays are synthesized directly on the surface of the microarray made up of 1.2 cm2 quartz wafer unlike the printed oligonucleotide arrays described above because in situ-synthesized probes are typically short (20\u201325 bp), multiple probes per target are included to improve sensitivity, specificity, and statistical accuracy. Yet another type are the bead array, similar to the above mentioned printed and in situ-hybridized microarrays, Bead Arrays (Illumina, San Diego, CA) provide a patterned substrate for the high-density detection of target nucleic acids. However, instead of glass slides or silicon wafers as direct substrates, Bead Arrays rely on 3-\u03bcm silica beads that randomly self-assemble onto one of two available substrates: the Sentrix Array Matrix (SAM) or the Sentrix Bead Chip [15]. Unlike the other array the exclusive feature of Bead Arrays rely on passive transport for the hybridization of nucleic acids. One more type of array, electronic microarrays utilize active hybridization via electric fields to control nucleic acid transport. Microelectronic cartridges (NanoChip 400; Nanogen, San Diego, CA) use complementary metal oxide semiconductor technology for the electronic addressing of nucleic acids [16]. Each Nano Chip cartridge has 12 connectors that control 400 individual test sites. In contrast to the above mentioned arrays, which are 2-D based, Suspension bead arrays are essentially three-dimensional arrays based on the use of microscopic polystyrene spheres (microspheres or beads) as the solid support and flow cytometry for bead and target detection. Furthermore, they are distinct from the high-density Illumina Bead Arrays, in which the beads are immobilized on fiber-optic strands or silicon slides. Most of the clinical diagnostic laboratories have not chosen expensive high technology infrastructure, as the number of tests expected to be performed, have not been large enough to justify the capital outlay. Therefore, simple screening tests such as SSCP and HDA were and still are the methods of choice for many clinical laboratories, as they allow for rapid and simultaneous detection of different sequence variations at a detection rate of close to 100%.",

            "text": "Although PCR has significantly facilitated the expansion of molecular diagnostics, it nonetheless has a number of limitations. First of all, it is problematic for Taq Polymerase to amplify CG repeat-rich regions which sometimes leads to the classic alternative of Southern blot analysis. Also, Taq Polymerase is error-prone at a range of 104\u2013105 nucleotide, which is strongly influenced by the conditions of the amplification reaction, such as magnesium or deoxyribonucleotide concentration, pH, temperature, and so on. Due to Polymerase errors there can be unspecific background, depending on the detection method, resulting in limiting the detection level. To overcome these technical problems, positive results should be confirmed by alternative methods or by using high fidelity thermo stable polymerases. Finally, it needs to be stressed that despite the wealth of mutation detection methodologies, DNA sequencing technology has immensely contributed to detection of unknown mutations. Until the late 1970s, determining the sequence of a nucleic acid containing even five or ten nucleotide was an extremely difficult and laborious task. After introduction of new technique of DNA sequencing, which includes several methods and technologies that are used for determining the order of the nucleotide bases\u2014adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine\u2014in a molecule of DNA, the knowledge of DNA sequences has become indispensable for basic biological research and in numerous applied fields such as diagnostic, biotechnology, microbiology etc. There has been significant acceleration in the field of biological research and discovery with the advent of DNA sequencing. Several microbial genomes have been sequenced using this technique. In 1977, two different methods for sequencing DNA were developed, that is, the chain termination method and the chemical degradation method. In 1976\u20131977, A. Maxam and W. Gilbert developed a DNA sequencing method based on chemical modification of DNA and subsequent cleavage at specific bases. This rapidly became more accepted, since purified DNA could be used directly, while the initial Sanger method required that each read start be cloned for production of single-stranded DNA. However, with the improvement of the Sanger method, Maxam\u2013Gilbert sequencing has less popular due to its technical complexity, prohibiting its use in standard molecular biology kits, extensive use of hazardous chemicals, and difficulties with scale-up. Each of four reactions (G, A + G, C, and C + T). Thus a series of labeled fragments are generated, from the radio labeled end to the first \u201ccut\u201d site in each molecule. Size based separation of the fragments in the four reactions is done by parallel electrophoresis on a denaturating acrylamide gel. Visualization is done by exposure of gel to X-ray film for autoradiography, yielding a series of dark bands each corresponding to a radiolabeled DNA fragment, from which the sequence may be inferred. This method is sometimes called \u201cchemical sequencing\u201d method. The chain-terminator method or Frederick Sanger method became a popular method of DNA sequencing due to its greater efficiency and use of fewer toxic chemicals and lower amounts of radioactivity than the method of Maxam and Gilbert. The key principle of the Sanger method was the use of dideoxynucleotide triphosphates (ddNTPs) as DNA chain terminators.",

Post human genome draft publication, the major challenge, was to improve the existing mutation detection technologies to achieve robust cost effective, rapid, and high-throughput analysis of genomic variation. In the last decade, technology has improved rapidly and new mutation-detection techniques have become available, whereas old methodologies have evolved to fit into the increasing demand for automated and high throughput screening. Denaturating high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) used for detection of polymorphic changes of disease-causing mutations one of the new technologies that emerged. It detects the presence of a genetic variation by the differential retention of homo- and heteroduplex DNA on reversed-phase chromatography under partial denaturation. DHPLC has proved to be one of the most powerful tools of mutation detection and is capable of detecting single-base substitutions, deletions, and insertions can be detected successfully by UV or fluorescence monitoring within 2\u20133 min in unpurified PCR products as large as 1.5-kilo bases. Another useful technique of mutation analysis is Pyro sequencing, which is a non-gel-based genotyping technology, and provides a very reliable method and an attractive alternative to DHPLC. Pyrosequencing detects de novo incorporation of nucleotides based on the specific template, causing release of a pyrophosphate, which is converted to ATP and followed by luciferase stimulation. The light produced, detected by a charge couple device camera, is translated to a pyrogram, from which the nucleotide sequence can be deducted [17].",

There is a wider acceptance for Real-time PCR [17] due to its improved rapidity, sensitivity, and reproducibility. There is a real time detection of the PCR product during the exponential phase of the reaction, thereby combining amplification and detection in one single step. The reduced number of cycles, use of fluorogenic labels and sensitive methods of their detection has largely removed post-PCR detection procedures, making the technique sensitive. Currently, newborns can be screened for phenylketonuria and other treatable genetic diseases. In the future, we might see children at high risk for coronary artery disease getting characterized and treated to prevent changes in their vascular walls during early adulthood. In the near future, we could witness as a part of standard medical practice, the individual drug monitoring response profiles throughout life, using genetic testing for the identification of their individual DNA signature, Shortly, genetic testing will comprise a wide spectrum of different analyses with a host of consequences for individuals and their families, which is worth emphasizing when explaining molecular diagnostics to the public.",

The PACE2 products now help in detection of both Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis in a single specimen (one specimen, two separate probes). The hybrid capture systems identify human papillomavirus (HPV) in cervical scrapings, herpes simplex virus (HSV) in vesicle material, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) in blood and other fluids. Although less sensitive than the target amplification based methods for detection of viruses, these methods do give the quantitative results which have proven fruitful for determining viral load and prognosis and for monitoring response to therapy [21]. Probe hybridization is useful for identifying slow growing organisms after isolation in culture using either liquid or solid media. Identification of mycobacteria and other slow-growing organisms such as the dimorphic fungi (Histoplasma capsulatum, Coccidioides immitis, and Blastomyces dermatitidis) has certainly been facilitated by commercially available probes. All commercial probes for recognizing organisms are produced by Gen-Probe and use acridinium ester-labeled probes directed at species-specific rRNA sequences.

Many micro-organisms, have been identified using this technique for example Mycobacterium tuberculosis, pneumococci, meningococci and Burkholderia cenocepacia. Over 100 viruses are known to cause acute viral encephalitis in humans. There is a battery of infective states of CNS which can be accounted for by viral infections like those involving the spinal cord (myelitis), the brain stem (e.g., rhombencephalitis), the cerebellum (cerebellitis), or the cerebrum (encephalitis) and almost all acute viral infections of the CNS produce some degree of meningeal as well as parenchymal inflammation. Rarely, such as West Nile virus (WNV) meningoencephalitis or cytomegalovirus (CMV) radiculomyelitis, polymorphonuclear cells rather than lymphocytes may be the predominant cell type, and thus provide some diagnostic guidelines. Even with such a diverse symptoms routine CSF studies only rarely lead to identification of a specific etiologic agent. The entire picture of diagnosis of viral infections of CNS has changed for good now a days due to the discovery of new molecular diagnostic technologies, such as the PCR to amplify viral nucleic acid from CSF [28, 29]. The real-time multiplex PCR assay designed by researchers is extremely rapid and permits the confirmation of bacterial isolates as Brucella spp., B. abortus, or B. melitensis within 2\u20133 h. Further this technique has assisted in the identification of infrequently isolated Brucella species and the recognition of atypical Brucella strains by utilizing genus specific primers-probe sets. This is advantageous since the conventional methods for Brucella isolation and characterization may take days to weeks to perform and often requiring the preparation of heavy suspensions of these highly infectious pathogens [30]. Since viral disease severity and viral load are linked, use of real-time PCR quantitation has proven beneficial when studying the role of viral reactivation or persistence in the progression of disease [31]. Nonetheless, the general diagnosis of invasive diseases caused by Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus flavus has been made easier by real-time PCR assays [31]. The diagnosis of efflux-mediated resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been performed by using molecular diagnostic approach. Real time PCR has helped in the detection of mexA and mexX and reverse transcription pCR for mex C and mex E, thus helping in the analysis of multidrug resistance in P. aeruginosa [28].",

Shortcomings of western blot analysis in confirmation of HIV infection have been overcome by an amended testing algorithm employing qualitative nucleic acid testing [33]. The APTIMA HIV-1 RNA Qualitative Assay and the Procleix HIV- 1/HCV assay (Gen-Probe, San Diego, CA, USA) are both Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for blood-donor screening to exclude blood from donors with acute HIV infection [34]. Transcription-mediated amplification technology is used in these two assays [35]. Infants born to mothers infected with HIV-1 have maternal antibodies directed against HIV up to 18 months of age and prevents the use of antibody-based assays for the early diagnosis of HIV infection. Such infected infants have a high morbidity and mortality in the first 2 years of life; thus, an early diagnosis is important to establish the infection status of the exposed infant in order to employ appropriate ART sufficiently early. Qualitative nucleic acid assays for the detection of HIV pro-viral DNA, viral RNA and total nucleic acid [36], have become the methods of choice for diagnosis in infants born to HIV-1-infected mothers. Cobas AmpliPrep/COBAS\u00ae TaqMan\u00ae HIV-1 Qualitative Test is one such test that uses 70 \u00b5l of whole blood or dry blood spot, and is directed against gag and LTR regions of HIV-1 genome.",

HIV-1 viral load determination is typically performed with HIV RNA amplification by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) or branched chain DNA tests. New microarray techniques including those from Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA, USA), have currently allowed host transcriptome analyses in individuals infected with HIV-1 [38], and 34 studies involving HIV-1 and microarrays from 2000 to 2006 yielded important data on HIV-1-mediated effects on gene expression and provided new insights into the intricate interactions occurring during infection [39].

Thus this technique is helping in combat infectious diseases, where a consistent detection of bacteria in specimens would prove critical in diagnosis and future therapy. Under these circumstances, PCR is the most reliable assay for detection of microbes in clinical specimens. The major challenge in the rapid detection, identification and characterization of microbial pathogens lies in the accurate recognition of a traits, species, sub species and genus, or combination of traits, that is unique to a specific microbial strain [40]. Increasingly, DNA based assays are replacing the conventional serotyping based methods. Rather DNA based assays detect known genomic signatures generally on 16s rRNA-based almost that is conserved by nature And offer rapid and reliable identification of microbial pathogens in most precise manner [41].

Primarily these fragile sites to be cloned and characterized which is accountable for the single most common form of inherited mental retardation, the Fragile X Syndrome. This syndrome, clinically well-defined by the presence of mental retardation of variable severity, modest facial dysmorphism and macroorchidism in adult males, has been documented for years as an X-linked Mendelian disorder offering abnormal and confusing features of inheritance, penetrance, cytogenetic expression and clinical variability. The mainstream of males who carry the Fragile X Mutation (FRAXA) are exaggerated by mental retardation and show a cytogenetically inducible fragile site, but 20% of obligate male carrier, the so called \u2018normal transmitting males\u2019, are both clinically and cytogenetically negative. Overall, characteristic can be defined by the nature of the FRAXA dynamic mutation and the inactivation of the FMR1 (Fragile X Mental Retardation 1) gene, coding for the RNA-binding protein (FMRP), typically expressed in human brain and testis. The 59 untranslated region of the FMR1 gene harbors a series of CGG triplet repeats, highly polymorphic in normal individuals; the total of these repeated units varies from 4 to about 54. A FRAXA mutation is demarcated as a \u2018premutation\u2019 when the repeats increase beyond the upper-normal limits to a size of about 200 triplets, characteristic of carrier females and normal transmitting males in whom, despite the structural modification, the gene is expressed and the protein is functional [42]. The altered allele transmitted by a premutated mother to her offspring scarcely ever shows small decreases of the repeats; more commonly, with a risk that is higher for larger premutations, it undertakes a process of expansion that can reach a size increase of more than 2000 repeats and is referred to as the \u2018full mutation\u2019 [43].",

Pathologic conclusions are retinal and central nervous system hemangioblastomas, pheochromocytomas, and renal and pancreatic cancer. In von Hippel\u2013Lindau disease both sexes are equally involved, there is a penetrance of about 90% at the age of 65 with a mean age at diagnosis of 26 years. TheVHL gene is 1810 bp in length, with an open reading frame (ORF) of 852 bp and two in-frame starting codons; it is composed of three exons, with exon 2 alternatively spliced. The alternative transcripts are ubiquitously expressed in a tissue-specific and developmentally selective manner [45]. The study of the normal function of this tumor suppressor gene promises a wide gain in our knowledge of the mechanisms of gene transcription: VHL acts as a competitor of Elongin (SIII), one of the transcription elongation factors, and can modify vascular endothelial growth factor and neoangiogenesis, upon which tumor growth is dependent. The practical approach is precise for the finding of medium small-size mutations, the type of alteration commonly found in the VHL pheochromocytoma phenotype [46]. Detection is done with the procedure of PCR amplification of partially overlapping genomic DNA fragments covering the entire coding sequence of the VHL gene and including exon-flanking intronic regions. The amplification products are subjected to polyacrilamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), for detection of deletion/insertion mutations that may change the molecular weight of the product, and to Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. This method, designed to specifically identify single base substitutions, is the most widely used mutation scanning technique; it is based on the tendency of single stranded DNA molecules to assume a three-dimensional conformation which is dependent on the primary sequence, is very specific and can be simply detected on a native polyacrylamide gel. DNA fragments that show size alterations on PAGE analysis or aberrant SSCP bands are subsequently subjected to direct automated sequencing to confirm and characterize the mutation. This strategy has allowed to identify different mutations, in unrelated VHL patients, and to detect case of somatic mosaicism in an asymptomatic subject [47].",

The pathological processes influencing these organ systems happen due to mutations in the CFTR gene which encodes the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, a membrane chloride channel present in the apical membrane of secretory epithelia. The CFTR protein is a cyclic-AMP dependent channel, activation of protein kinase A occurs when there is increase in levels of c-AMP inside a secretory epithelial cell ultimately it binds to the phosphorylation site on the (regulatory) R-domain of the CFTR protein thus opening the channel. The CFTR chloride channel essentially works as an electrostatic attractant by directing intracellular and extracellular anions toward positively charged transmembrane domains inside the channel. The CFTR protein includes 12 transmembrane (TM) domains. Two of these (TM1 and TM6) attract and bind chloride (and/or bicarbonate) ions. After binding chloride ions to these sites in the pore, the mutual repulsion hastens expulsion of the ions from the cell [48].",

Current methods used in CFTR testing can be categorized into two groups: targeting at known established mutations, and scanning methods. These now include exploration of large unknown CFTR rearrangements, including large deletions, insertions and duplications, by semi-quantitative PCR experiments, i.e. Multiplex Ligation-dependant Probe Amplification CFTR mutations may be missed by scanning techniques, especially when homozygous, and even direct sequencing cannot identify 100% of mutations [50]. Undetected CFTR mutations may penetrate deep within introns or regulatory regions which are not generally analyzed. For example 3849 + 10kbC > T (c.3718-2477C > T) and 1811 + 1.6kbA > G (c.1679 + 1.6kbA > G), the detection of which require meticulous methodologies. Attention should also be pin-pointed on heterogeneity, as it has been stated in patients with the classical form of CF, including a positive sweat test, but this possibly concerns less than 1% of cases. Additionally mutations in the SCNN1 genes, encoding sodium channel (ENaC) subunits have been revealed in non-classic CF cases where no CFTR mutations could be recognized by extensive mutation scanning [51].",

            "text": "The main pathogenetic event in TSEs is the conformational change of a host protein, cellular PrP (PrPc), encoded by the prion gene PRNP, into a pathological isoform. This conformer, called PrPSc (after its first identification in experimentally scrapie-infected rodents) aggregates into amyloid fibrils and accumulates into neural and, often, lymphoreticular cells [61]. Although blood taken from vCJD patients and inoculated into susceptible mice does not always cause disease, it is still possible that low level of infectivity and, as a consequence, PrPSc might be present in blood. Further efficiency and species barrier may upset its manifestations. Numerous Animal studies have shown that the pathogenesis of TSE as after experimental inoculation of rodents/Mice with TSE agents, PrPSc is characteristically noticeable in the CNS weeks before the expression of disease and its level augments until the animal dies. As the rise of PrPSc corresponds to that of infectivity, PrPSc is commonly used as a surrogate marker for assessing the amount of infectivity in biological samples. The ratio of infectivity and PrPSc is relatively constant in the hamster brain experimentally infected with the 263 K strain of scrapie at a mean value of ~105\u2013106 protein molecules for one lethal dose 50 (LD50) [62]. But recently few techniques at pre-clinical levels have sufficient potency to be proved as good biomarkers as they can detect very low levels of these proteins like chemicophysical precipitation based protocols, affinity chromatography or affinity precipitation techniques. The amended isolation method for PrPSc with sodium phosphotungstate [63], and novel molecules plasminogen, and protocadherin-2 binding with high affinity to PrPSc, might enhance new expectations for preclinical diagnosis of TSEs. Among the immunological methods of PrPSc screening, western blotting is mainly characterized and widely validated method. It offers the advantage of recognizing different forms of PrPSc through the analysis of the molecular mass and the relative abundance of di-, mono- and non-glycosylated bands. These parameters characterize the so-called PrP glycotype, a kind of \u2018PrP signature\u2019, which varies among different forms of TSEs. PrPSc glycotyping has been projected for differentiating various forms of TSEs (e.g., scrapie from BSE, sporadic from variant CJD and for improving the classification of human TSEs. In sporadic CJD, for example, the combination of the two most frequent PrPSc glycotypes (I and II) with the three possible genotypes of PrP at the polymorphic codon 129 (methionine homozygous, valine homozygous, or heterozygous) enables the sub classification of this form into six distinct groups, each of which presents distinct clinical and pathological features [64]. But this technique is time consuming and only few samples can be assessed at a time so ELISA can overcome these problems. Further development and up gradation in immune assay in the form of Dissociation-enhanced lanthanide fluorescence immunoassay/conformation-dependent immunoassay (DELFIA/CDI) is the latest-generation immunoassay with an ELISA format, where the detection system is sensitive time-resolved lanthanide fluorescence instead of chemiluminescence. It can measure picograms (10\u201312 g) of PrPSc per ml and thus represents one of the most sensitive technique for the detection of PrPSc [65]. Further one more technique MUFS (Multi-Spectral Ultraviolet Fluorescence Spectroscopy) characterizes proteins by their specific fluorescent pattern of emission when they are excited by ultraviolet radiation and bypasses the need for pre-treatment steps to eliminate PrPc or for antibody binding. It has the potential to discriminate cellular from pathological prion protein, and various forms of PrPSc from different strains. Moreover most sensitive and specific technique which uses fluorescent antibody with confocal microscopy in FCS (Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy) which recognizes single fluorescent molecules in solution as they pass between the exciting laser beam and the objective of a confocal microscope, equipped with a single-photon counter. It is performed quickly and requires only small amounts of samples. The assay solution is mixed with anti-PrP antibodies tagged with fluorophores that bind strongly to PrPSc aggregates, which become highly fluorescent and easily visible against the background of monomeric PrPc. This technique is ~20-fold more sensitive than western blot and was able to detect, for the first time, PrPSc in the CSF of ~20% of CJD patients.",

This wide diversity is pin-pointed by the fact that HCM may be seen in all phases of life, from the new-born to the elderly. The clinical course is extremely variable, with few patients remaining asymptomatic throughout life and others developing severe symptoms of heart failure, few die prematurely, either suddenly (often in the absence of prior symptoms) or owing to progressive heart failure. It has been marked, even from the preliminary descriptions of the disease, that HCM is commonly inherited as a Mendelian autosomal dominant trait [69]. HCM can be caused by a mutation in any 1 of 5 genes that encode proteins of the cardiac sarcomere: b-myosin heavy chain (on chromosome 14), cardiac troponin T (chromosome 1troponin I (chromosome 19), a-tropomyosin (chromosome 15), and cardiac myosin-binding protein C (chromosome 11). Moreover, mutations in 2 genes encoding crucial and regulatory myosin light chains have been reported in what may be an extremely rare form of HCM. This genetic diversity is further compounded by intragenic heterogeneity, with a total of more than 100 individual disease-causing mutations identified for these genes. Available data support that mutations in the b-myosin heavy chain gene (myosin is the primary contractile protein in thick filaments of myofibrils) may responsible for as much as 35% of familial HCM. All the known genetic myosin defects have proved to be missense mutations [70]. Cardiac troponin T mutations [71], responsible for an estimated 10\u201320% of familial HCM. Troponin T binds the troponin complex to tropomyosin and plays a major role in calcium regulation of cardiac contraction and relaxation.",

Life expectancy may be reduced, usually due to involvement of the cardiovascular system with progressive aortic root dilatation, dissection and rupture, or valvular regurgitation. The primary defect responsible for MFS, first described in 1991, resides in a gene (FBN1) localized to the long arm of chromosome 15 encoding the connective tissue protein fibrillin-1 [73]. Fibrillin is a structural glycoprotein component of microfibrils, which are extracellular components that participate in the formation of mature elastic fibers and which provide structural functions independent of elastin. Linkage analysis has shown no locus heterogeneity for MFS; the cause-and-effect relation with the clinical Marfan phenotype has been confined to fibrillin mutations [74].",

Thus persistent progress in molecular research has quite simplified the puzzle although its pathogenesis is still in infancy in various cancers. Cancer is a change in the cellular processes that cause a tumour to grow out of control. Cancerous cells sometimes have mutations in oncogenes, such as KRAS and CTNNB1 (\u03b2-catenin) [75]. Analyzing the molecular signature of cancerous cells, the DNA and its levels of expression via messenger RNA enables physicians to characterize the cancer and to choose the best therapy for their patients.

Epigenetic gene regulation denotes to non-coded heritable changes in gene expression which includes DNA methylation, histone modifications and noncoding RNA-induced transcriptional changes. These are desirable for the transcriptional regulation and genomic stability. Two histone modifiers HAT p300 and HDM EZH2 are promising PCa biomarkers which have shown to be over expressed in PCa and its expression levels precisely linked with different disease stages. This characteristics may make it a standard dual biomarker. Hypermethylation and gene silencing have been documented for cell cycle regulation such as anaphase promoting complex (APC) and Ras association domain-containing protein 1 (RASSF1a), detoxification enzymes e.g., glutathione S-transferase Pi 1 (GSTP1). Furthermore, combined assays for GSTP1 and APC hyper methylation have unlimited potential for detectingPCa in clinical samples up to 100% sensitivity. The risk of PCa can also be evaluated from single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of alleles in different region of chromosome (EHBP1, THADA, ITGA6, EEFSEC, PDLIM5, FU20032, SLC22A3, JAF1, LMTK2, NKX3, CMYC, MSMB, CTBP2, HNF1B, KLK2-3, TNRC6B, BIK, IL-10, IL-18 [77], NUDT10-11) which influence the behavior of the disease and its progression by changing expressions of mRNA and protein [78].

The term ncRNA encompasses the well-studied functional RNAs like rRNA and tRNA, as well as microRNA (miRNA; previously known as small ncRNA) including long ncRNA (lncRNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA). Three known lncRNAs which have validated their significance in detecting, screening and monitoring PCa [80], because of their high specificity and sensitivity are PCa non coding RNA-1 (PRNCR1), prostate-specific gene 1 (PSGEM1), and PCa antigen 3 (PCA3); also referred to as differential display 3 (DD3). Recently it has also been proposed that PCGEM1 gene, which encodes a lncRNA is highly prostate-specific. Moreover, the screening of TMPRSS2-ERG fusion (TEF) techniques as examined by Immunohistochemistry, FISH and RT PCR found to have significance in the diagnosis PCa. However the TE fusion in combination with PCA3 mRNA may prove more beneficial in diagnosis [81]. Circulating microRNAs (miRNA) have newly been supposed to be biomarkers for non-invasive diagnosis in various tumors [82]. Several gene expression studies also reported altered interleukins expressionin prostate cancer patients [83]. These differentially regulated miRNAs lead to changes in the expression and activity of their targets in PCa. The miRNA expression changes with the development and progression of PCa as some of the cancer-related genes are regulated by them and thus its dysregulation has significance in PCa. Using a mouse xenograft model, Mitchell et al. [84] have demonstrated that miRNAs originated from the human PCa xenografts enter the circulation and thus reported that miR-141 is up regulated in sera of metastatic PCa patients which can distinguish PCa patients from healthy controls with high sensitivity and more accuracy.",

The number of deaths was 21.2 per 100,000 women per year. These rates are age-adjusted and based on 2010-2014 cases and deaths. (National Cancer Institute stats report https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/breast.html). The more typical approach to breast cancer diagnostics via hormone receptor analysis is IHC. IHC involves the use of antibodies and enzymes, such as horseradish peroxidase, to stain tissue sections for the tumor antigens of interest. This analysis method can be performed on either frozen or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue, as well as on small amounts of tissue acquired in procedures such as core biopsies. IHC also has the advantage of not only determining the percentage of positive nuclei but also the intensity of staining in individual nuclei. Unfortunately, in addition to a lack of inter laboratory standardization of the IHC technique, the process for characterizing the positivity of either ER or PR staining is performed subjectively by a pathologist, thereby introducing variability in interpretation. Regardless of this subjectivity in staining intensity, IHC is by far the most common approach to evaluating hormone status in breast cancer today. Another major prognostic marker that is currently recommended for the evaluation of primary invasive breast cancer is the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, also known as HER2. HER2 is an oncogene belonging to the EGF receptor (EGFR) family. Gene amplification of HER2 has been shown to occur in 10\u201340% of primary tumors and HER2 protein over expression is found in almost 25% of breast cancers [93].",

The test needs a fresh sample (at least 3 mm in diameter) obtained during a surgical biopsy to be sent to the Agendia laboratory in Amsterdam in an RNA-stabilizing solution for analysis. RNA is isolated from the sample, amplified and hybridized with a standard reference to the Mamma Print microarray to obtain the 70-gene expression profile [96]. This method has been shown to have an extremely high correlation of prognostic prediction to tumor recurrence (p < 0.0001). In 2007, the US FDA approved the Mamma Print test for use on freshly frozen tissue. Although the Mamma Print gene expression profile has the potential to be a useful diagnostic tool, there are many limitations that need to be taken into consideration.",

Currently, Oncotype DX is the standard breast cancer screening test for women with early-stage (Stage I or II), node-negative, ER + invasive breast cancer. The assay reports a recurrence score that ranges from 0 to 100, indicating the probability of cancer recurring within 10 years of the original diagnosis. The recurrence score is then categorized into one of three groups: low, intermediate or high risk. There is a particular urgency for such information in women with early-stage breast cancer, where the great variety of treatment options can be narrowed down and tailored to each patient. Both ASCO and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) have incorporated the Oncotype DX assay into their guidelines [97].",

Since this first study, there has been a surge of data added on the expression of various microRNAs and their roles in breast cancer. miR-21 has surfaced in multiple studies as having consistent and significant increased expression in breast cancer cell lines and human tissue when compared with normal cells and tissues. Additionally miR-10b was one of the three microRNAs in the Iorio et al. study that demonstrated significant down regulation in breast cancer cells compared with primary human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs). However, in a successive study, miR-10b appeared to be highly expressed in metastatic cancer cells. Functional studies have described that miR-10b over expression promotes cell migration and invasion in vitro, and initiates tumor invasion and metastasis in vivo. Multiple studies have also demonstrated a significant association between expression of miR-206 and the expression of estrogen receptors in breast cancer. Iorio et al. [98] were the first to show that miR-206 expression was raised in those tumors that were ER. miR-125a and miR-125b were first reported in a microRNA profile study to be significantly down regulated in HER2-positive breast cancers. Computation analysis then confirmed target sites at the 3\u2032UTR regions of HER2 and HER3 for these microRNAs. (Mattie et al. 2006) A tissue culture analysis showed that overexpression of miR-125a or miR-125b in an ErbB2-dependent cancer cell line (SKBR3) suppressed HER2 and HER3 transcript and protein levels, which decreased cell motility and invasiveness [99]. Recent advancements and investigations in the field of liquid biopsy-based biomarkers, especially DTCs and CTCs bearing molecular signature have the capability to behave as potential biomarkers and can discriminate breast cancer between localized to metastasizing one.

Non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) explains for 80\u201385% of all lung cancers, with lung adenocarcinoma being the most typical histologic type in the United States. Enhancements in our knowledge of molecular alterations at multiple levels (genetic, epigenetic, protein expression) and their functional importance have the potential to impact lung cancer diagnosis, prognostication and treatment. In lung cancer as in other malignancies, tumourigenesis narrates to activation of growth promoting proteins [e.g., v-Kiras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), BRAF, MEK-1, HER2, MET, ALK and rearranged during transfection (RET)] as well as inactivation of tumour suppressor genes [e.g., P53, phosphatase with tensin homology (PTEN), LKB-1 [100]. Lung cancers have extremely complex genomes with a recent large scale exome sequencing study of 31 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) identifying 727 mutated genes not previously described in the literature or in the COSMIC database. Genomic studies have established previously well-known alterations in lung cancer such as KRAS, EGFR and BRAF and also identified low frequency but recurrent mutations that are novel in lung cancer including potentially targetable alterations in JAK2, ERBB4, RET, fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1), and discoidin domain receptor 2 (DDR2) [101]. Lung cancer mutations have been recognized in v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), BRAF and the parallel phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3 K) pathway oncogenes and more recently in MEK and HER2 while structural rearrangements in ALK, ROS1 and possibly rearranged during transfection (RET) provide new therapeutic targets. Amplification is another mechanism of activation of oncogenes such as MET in adenocarcinoma, fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) and discoidin domain receptor 2 (DDR2) in SCC.",

The occurrence of these molecular targets as labelled above now defines the characteristics of NSCLC, with EGFR mutation and ALK rearrangements being the most clinically relevant at present. The prevalence of these mutations varies in lung cancer arising from patient in different regions. Activating EGFR mutations were found in up to 20% of Caucasians while in the Asian populations these EGFR mutations can be present in up to 40% of patients with NSCLC. These ethnic difference in NSCLC properties seems to be not limited to the presence of activating EGFR mutations but is also evident in other driver oncogenic mutation profiles (including ALK, KRAS, MET etc.), histology and hence tumour response to targeted therapy treatment. The presence of these driver mutations is normally found to be mutually exclusive to others in the same tumour [102]. In lung ADC among Asians, ALK rearrangement is seen in up to 7% of patients with lung ADC. Based on current reports of therapeutic molecular targets of EGFR mutation and ALK gene rearrangement in NSCLC and the availability of corresponding targeted agents, an algorithm of testing for molecular targets in NSCLC is proposed, which signifies a stepwise approach to testing for individual targets, beginning with EGFR then, if negative, ALK fusion gene or other potential targets if appropriate. Among NSCLC, adenocarcinoma accounts for up to 80% of histological subtypes. There are previous reports of correlations between histological subtypes of ADC demonstrating micropapillary features with presence of activating EGFR mutations, leading to the suggestions that the presence of specific mutations in NSCLC in fact represent heterogeneity in cancer biology and also response to therapy [103]. Given the heterogeneity of lung cancer histology, however, histological subtypes are hard to be used as the sole reliable marker for guidance to molecular phenotyping and selection of targeted therapy. Targeting therapeutic oncogenic mutations like EGFR and ALK can give dramatic initial treatment response or at least an initial stable clinical disease.",

Early detection and quick treatment provide the best chance for cure.

The practise of such biomarkers as adjuncts to routine histopatholoigical assessment may help prognostication and effective management of PMLs but their routine use is still hindered by the cost and complexity of the tests, the lack of facilities in some laboratories, and limited outcome studies to date. More readily available markers, such as those of cell proliferation (Ki-67 antigen) and apoptosis (Bax, Bcl-2), may also play a diagnostic role: apoptotic Bcl-2 expression de- creases significantly in dysplastic and early invasive lesions and then increases almost to normal tissue level in consequent stages while Ki-67 expression increases sharply in initial stages of OSCC, but significantly decreases in later stages [104].",

Although large individual variability in drug efficacy and safety has been known to exist since the establishment of human medicine but the cause was beyond to knowledge. On the other hand, the request to overcome such variation has received more consideration now after the draft of human genome than ever before. The human genome sequence offers a special record of human evolution that varies among populations and individuals. Sequence variations in drug target proteins, drug-metabolizing enzymes, and drug transporters can alter drug efficacy, drug side effects, or both to cause variable drug responses in individual patients.

The fast build-up of knowledge on genome-disease and genome-drug interactions has also encouraged the transformation of pharmacogenetics into a new entity of human genetics, pharmacogenomics and, at the same time, provided a rationale for the hope that individualized medicine can be achieved in the near future [113, 114].",

Further, Nutrigenomics is also evolving and promising a better management of patients. Several bioactive food components, including both essential and nonessential nutrients, can regulate gene expression patterns. Thus, nutrigenomics is providing the effects of ingested nutrients and other food components on gene expression and gene regulation, i.e. diet\u2013gene interaction in order to spot the dietetic components having beneficial or detrimental health effects. Nutritional genomics (nutrigenomics), the junction between health, diet, and genomics, is influenced via epigenetic, transcriptomics, and proteomics processes of biology. Thus, it will help in determining the individual nutritional requirements based on the genetic makeup of the person (personalized diet) as well as the association between diet and chronic diseases like cancer, opening new vistas to understanding the complexity of various diseases [116].",

            "text": "In the upcoming years, molecular diagnostics will continue to be of critical importance to public health worldwide. Molecular diagnostic offers physicians with critical information based on the early exploration of pathogens and subtle changes in patients\u2019 genes and chromosomes, allowing for earlier diagnosis, selection of appropriate therapies and monitoring of disease progression. A wide range of molecular based tests is available to evaluate DNA difference and changes in gene expression of patient DNA and RNA through Real-Time PCR, FISH and Sequencing Technologies [117]. Further, the complex relationship between diseases like Fertility and Obesity or Metabolic syndrome with Cancer have also gained momentum due to exploration of common pathways, that only become possible of due to such advancement in molecular techniques [118]. However, there are many obstacles to overcome before the execution of these tests in clinical laboratories, such as which test to employ, the choice of technology and equipment, and issues such as cost-effectiveness, accuracy, reproducibility i.e. robustness, personnel training etc. Currently PCR-based testing outweigh; however, alternative technologies aimed to explore genome complexity without PCR are anticipated to gain momentum in the coming years as sequencing devices are more costly at present. Furthermore, development of integrated silicon chips mounted with biomolecules is now going to change the concept of traditional wet lab to \u201clab-on-a-chip\u201d. Thus it would be possible to analyse thousands of genes/proteins in hours from low amount/single cell sample. Thus coming era will be revolutionary, it will not only going to change our diagnostic systems but also plan of treatment and therapy [119, 120].",
