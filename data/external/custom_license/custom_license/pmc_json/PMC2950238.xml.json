The chamber was designed mainly to separate the internal controlled environment from the external environment, and the operator from the experiment and the experimental products. The primary aim was to prevent cross-contamination from the internal to the external environment or vice versa (Kruse et al., 1991; Wathes and Johnson, 1991; Huang, 2005; Tattershall, 2006). Isolation chambers were designed to improve experimental safety by preventing this cross-contamination, reducing the likelihood of operator error, and minimizing the contaminated area. In addition, the comfort level of scientists working with the isolation chambers was taken into account. The safety level of these chambers allows for the operator to avoid wearing too many protective suits, which improves both the comfort and flexibility of the operator (Sawyer et al., 2007).",

Rigid barriers can be made of many different materials, and the more rigid the material, the more reliable the physical barrier. Construction of these rigid barriers usually makes use of plastic enclosures, metal profile enclosures, or hot-worked metal enclosures (ISO 10648-1:1997). The isolation chamber is designed to house a living animal, and therefore continuous airflow inside the enclosure is needed to drive out heat and moisture generated by the animal\u2019s metabolism and to decrease the concentration of odor, dust, and infectious substances (Hillman et al., 1992). The resulting exhaust gas is subject to a filtering system designed to prevent pathogen contamination of the external environment (Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources Commission on Life Sciences, National Research Council, 1996). The aerodynamics is allowed for one-way flow or turbulence of the airflow inside the isolation chamber, under negative pressure relative to the environment. Supply and exhaust air can be passed through high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters to prevent the formation of aerosols that could potentially escape into the environment (Runkle et al., 1969).",

The current operating parameters are displayed on the touch screen interface and can then be adjusted by the human operator by following the interface prompts. The isolation chamber should be monitored for 48 h to ensure that it is running normally. This includes supplying filtered air to the isolation chamber and ensuring that the exhaust air is cleaned by the double in-line HEPA filters and passed through the exhaust air system into the open air. Fresh air exchanges should be conducted at a rate of about 36 times per hour. Following 48 h of monitoring, the inside temperature is 22\u201323 \u00b0C, the relative humidity is 60%, the working negative pressure in the isolation chamber is adjusted to \u2212100 Pa with respect to the laboratory. Appropriate anesthesia should be used on healthy medium-sized animals to pass them through the quarantine system and into the isolation chamber via the DPTE system. The animal experiment should be performed according to bio-safety operation standard procedures while the animal is still under the appropriate anesthesia. If the gloves are removed during the operation, a low pressure audible/visual alarm system is activated, and a minimum velocity value of 0.65 m/s in the center of the glove port is maintained. If a glove is damaged by a needle, the blowers are capable of maintaining the isolation chamber pressure at \u2212100 Pa, but the alarm system would not be activated because the micro-differential pressure sensor is not sensitive enough for a leak of this size. Proper procedure dictates that the small hole be labeled by the operator and a new glove exchanged. All of the feeds, experimental material, waste, feces, and other materials can be transferred into or out of the isolation chamber by the DPTE system. There are several isolation chambers in one room, and the autoclave does not connect with any of them. Instead, DPTE \u03b2 canisters are filled with items and are then sterilized in the autoclave. After sterilization, the sterile items are removed after opening the \u03b2 door with specialized tools. The sterile items are then sent to a centralized disposal center for medical waste. Following the completion of studies with single animals, each animal is treated as dictated by bio-safety operation standards and general animal welfare. The cadavers are autoclaved in \u03b2 canisters and sent to animal carcass disposal sites. The isolation chamber is connected to the peracetic acid sterilizer to sterilize its interior.",

The extraction blowers contain an integrated backup system with one blower running at full strength and another on standby to act as a backup. Negative or positive pressure state is kept at a stable and safe level through the automatic control system. The pressure is adjusted depending on different requirements for different animals and/or experimental conditions. (2) A DPTE 270 \u03b1 door mounted on one side wall of the isolation chamber allows for the transfer of experimental materials. Another DPTE 270 \u03b1 door is mounted on the bottom of the isolation chamber near the disinfection pool with a slightly tilted bottom. Animal excrement can be discharged to the DPTE container via the flexible silicone diversion tube. The excrement collection package is then minified. An experimental sample can also be transferred to the bio-safety cabinet through a shorter DPTE container. (3) The control cabinet installation is comprised mainly of the PLC, electric element (which includes the voltage transformer, secure alternating current contactor, circuit breaker, electric cable, indicating lamp, and button), printer port (for data output), and industrial Ethernet interface (which allows for the remote data control of multiple isolation chambers by the WINCC 6.0 program system). Automatic control and monitoring of the isolation chamber and sterilization system are achieved by the exchange of data between the touch screen and control cabinet through the industrial bus Profibus DP to meet different laboratory animal research project parameter requirements such as pressure, humidity, temperature, illumination, and disinfection. A human operator can set the isolation chamber environment parameters according to the requirements of the infectious animals or for cleaning animals, allowing for the acquisition of adequate and authentic data.
