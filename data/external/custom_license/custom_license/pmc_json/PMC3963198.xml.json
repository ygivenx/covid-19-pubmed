Due to the secondary bacteremia, burn wound manipulation and/or excision, prophylactic systemic antibiotic therapy may be given immediately before, during and for one or two doses after the procedure, particularly in burn patients with extensive injury (e.g. 40% TBSA) (2A).[2425]Early burn wound excision now occurs within the first few days after burn injury and has resulted in improved survival. The primary aims of early excision are removal of the dead tissue that stimulates an overwhelming systemic inflammatory response syndrome and prevention of infection by temporary or permanent closure of the burn wound.[25] Furthermore, shortening the period of wound inflammation, which in turn reduces the development of hypertrophic scarring, may optimize the outcome in terms of function and appearance.[25] This is achieved by early removal of necrotic tissue (e.g. eschar) and wound closure with autograft, allograft, or skin substitutes in selected patients.\n",

            "text": "\nHand washing: This is the single most effective hygiene practice for minimizing health care associated infections. HCWs must wash their hands before and after every significant patient contact. Hand basins with hot and cold water supplies, non-touch taps with antisplash devices, supplies of liquid handwash (preferably in non-refillable disposable containers) and disposable paper towels or single-use, clean, cloth towels are recommended to facilitate hand hygiene. CDC guidelines[48] and the WHO guidelines[4] recommend that HCWs wash their hands with soap and water when visibly soiled and exposure to potential spore-forming pathogens is strongly suspected or proven, including outbreaks of C. difficile (1B). Otherwise, hand rubbing with an alcohol based agent is recommended (1A) for all other opportunities as it is faster, more effective and better tolerated by the skin. Exposure of hands to body fluid in presence of intact skin deserves decontamination (recommendation level 1B) but it is particularly vital when skin is not intact or mucous membrane has been exposed (recommendation level 1A).[5] Compliance monitoring for hand hygiene among HCWs therefore had been given a higher recommendation level (1A).[44849]Recommendations for use of gloves:[50]\nSterile gloves \u2013 for procedures requiring a sterile field, involving normally sterile areas of the bodyNon-sterile gloves \u2013 for procedures other than the aboveGeneral purpose utility gloves \u2013 for housekeeping and cleaningUse of gloves had been advocated when it can be reasonably anticipated that contact of blood or other potentially infectious materials with, mucous membranes, or non-intact skin will occur (IC).[4]\nRecommendations for changing gloves:[50]\nAfter contact with each patient and when performing separate procedures on the same patient if cross-contamination is possibleas soon as gloves are damaged (torn or punctured);After completion of any task not involving patients but requiring the use of glovesBefore answering telephones or recording patient notesRemove gloves after caring for a patient. Do not wear the same pair of gloves for the care of more than one patient (IB).[4]\nRecommendations for eyewear or face-shields: During procedures where there is potential for splashing, splattering or spraying of blood or other body substances[50]Waste disposal and spillage: Disposal protocol should be followed differently for general waste (concern is not more than household waste), cytotoxic waste, pharmaceutical waste, chemical waste and radioactive waste. For blood spillage in ward or operation theater, cleaning should be done at the earliest with paper towels followed by water and detergents. Sodium hypochlorite is not necessary for such cleaning. Laboratory spillage should be absorbed on to paper towels and disposed of as clinical waste. The contaminated surfaces should be treated with 2.0-2.5% sodium hypochlorite, left for 1 h and cleaned again with paper towels that are disposed of as clinical waste. In suspected creutzfeldt-jackob disease spillage of brain tissue or spinal fluid is treated in the similar manner but the paper towels are incinerated.[50] It has been observed that HBV and HCV in dry blood remain infectious even when exposed to external environment for up to a week and 16 h respectively. Implications remain the same even if blood is invisible or not present in sufficient quantity.[51] Considering this glucometers should be cleaned and disinfected as per CDC recommendation after every use to avoid contamination[1152]\n",
