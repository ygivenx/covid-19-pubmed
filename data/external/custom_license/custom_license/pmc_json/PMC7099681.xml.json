All of these infants were from one center and our findings may not be generalizable to the population at large; however, comparison with one national database did show similar outcomes for BPD severity.22 Also, obtaining long-term data on extremely preterm infants can be challenging, especially for infants who are born >160 km from the admitting NICU center. Therefore, some infants were LFU after hospital discharge. Some of these infants could have moved out of state and died in another center or have significant pulmonary morbidity that was being managed at another location. Another limitation was our definition of infections. Although the patients were in the NICU, we had better control over management; once the patients were in the community, the type of work-up they obtained varied and did not always include the same supporting laboratory/radiographic studies. We identified one no/mild BPD, one moderate BPD and three severe BPD cases that relied on documented radiographic, laboratory and clinical exam findings to diagnose the viral upper respiratory tract infection but no actual virus was isolated on viral studies. Two no/mild, three moderate and one severe BPD case did not have confirmation on how the viral upper respiratory tract infection was diagnosed. During this time period, the extended viral PCR panel (Biofire FilmArray RP), which now includes an extended number of viral pathogens including Coronavirus 229E, Coronavirus HKU1, Coronavirus NL63, Coronavirus OC43, Influenza A subtype H1-2009, Parainfluenza virus 4, Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydophila pneumonia and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, was not commonly being used in our center or the community. Once discharged from the NICU, the infants were not evaluated on a daily basis by a physician and it is likely that minor infections, both bacterial/viral, went unnoticed by caregivers. Also, our center followed the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendation for Synagis administration. It was given 48 to 72 h before discharge between the months of November and March. Out of 157 patients, 51 were discharged within this timeframe and all received their initial Synagis dose in-house; however, subsequent doses were provided to their local pediatricians so compliance data are not available for this cohort. Potentially, a future prospective study would be better able to control for some of these limitations; however, even future prospective studies could have difficulties because currently the outcome variables used (diuretic use and inhaled steroid use) do not have nationally agreed upon routine use. Locally, we were consistent with our initiation of therapy and weaning protocols; however, this will not be the case if data from multi-center national databases are used, this further highlights the need for ongoing research into this area of clinical management for this population.",

Our study also required access to medical records for this cohort past hospital discharge with special interest being placed on ER, hospital and primary care provider records. As this center is the only tertiary referral center for children with complex illness in this geographic region, we hospitalize over 86% of pediatric cases (unpublished CMH demographic data) and closer to 100% of high-risk cases. A multispecialty clinic follows the NICU graduates closely over the first few years of life with close coordination/communication with the outside pediatrician. This makes it less likely that an episode of illness requiring health-care utilization was missed. The NICU clinic sees the patients every 1 to 3 months for at least a year post NICU discharge and the CMH-DR has permission to collect information on participants up to 5 years post NICU discharge. Only 13% (19/142) of the cohort were LFU and 78% (111/142) of participants were successfully followed through their first year of life (82% if deaths were excluded (111/136)).",

However, recent literature has shown that pulmonary follow-up keeps the ER visits and hospitalization rates between mild and severe BPD patients stable27 when normally more severe BPD patients have increased sequelae. Previous recommendations for evaluation of sleep disordered breathing in this population was focused on infants with severe BPD; however, recent studies have shown that daytime oxygen saturations and respiratory rates did not predict instability seen on sleep studies.28 Recent studies performing serial infant pulmonary function tests did not demonstrate any \u2018catch up\u2019 lung growth in the BPD infants in the first year of life.29, 30 Studies in teenagers/adults with a history of BPD showed persistent abnormalities in lung function as seen by increased air trapping, increased residual volume, increased incidence of airway hyper reactivity and a faster decline in lung function in adulthood compared with controls.31, 32, 33 Our study suggests that a wider range of extremely premature infants, even those with no/mild BPD, may be at risk of significant pulmonary sequelae from intercurrent infections based on this increased use of oxygen over the first year of life.",
