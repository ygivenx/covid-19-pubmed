Compared with seasonal H1N1 influenza, H5N1 influenza has a much higher case fatality rate, which is believed to result predominantly from lung injury and respiratory failure. Sun et al. found an accumulation of autophagosomes in H5N1-infected lungs from human cadavers and mice, and observed that H5N1 but not H1N1 viruses induced autophagic cell death in alveolar epithelial cells. Importantly, they also observed that prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of mice with the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine ameliorated lung inflammation and improved survival rates, indicating that blocking autophagy in the lungs could be an effective way to combat the threat of an H5N1 pandemic.

Comparison of the genome sequence of an MRSA ST398 strain with the sequences of 88 other S. aureus isolates revealed that it is descended from an antibiotic-sensitive strain that originally infected humans and changed rapidly after the jump into livestock, giving rise to new strains with resistance to several different antibiotics. Non-therapeutic use of antibiotics has been banned in the European Union but is still common practice in other parts of the world, including the United States, where the use of antibiotics in livestock production is thought to be driving an increase in the appearance of antibiotic resistance in bacteria. The US Food and Drug Administration caused controversy when it recently announced that it would not regulate the use of antibiotics in animal feed, a decision that may need to be reconsidered in light of these findings.",

Poisoning with BoNT often occurs through ingestion of food that is contaminated with Clostridium botulinum; however, it was unclear exactly how NTNHA helps BoNT to remain intact in the hostile environment of the human gut but releases the toxin on entry into the circulation. Gu et al. show that NTNHA provides large and multivalent binding interfaces that protect BoNT from degradation, and that this complex is regulated in a pH-dependent manner, allowing toxin release on leaving the gut. These findings will not only help to improve the design of inhibitors against BoNT, but also potentially lead to the development of better delivery vehicles for oral drug administration.

The new drug, BPH-703, is similar to several inhibitors of geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (GGPPS; an enzyme involved in isoprenoid biosynthesis) that have been used to treat osteoporosis. However, unlike these other drugs, BPH-703 can enter Plasmodium-infected red blood cells in a mouse model of malaria and kill the parasite. Importantly, the new drug has little effect on isoprenoid biosynthesis in human or mouse cells and is effective at low concentrations in Plasmodium-infected mice, with no observed toxicity. Malaria killed an estimated 655,000 people in 2010, and finding new drug targets, such as GGPPS, remains a priority. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA",
