            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), which is characterized by vomiting, watery diarrhea, and dehydration, is a highly contagious enteric disease. When PED occurs in a swine farm, nursery piglets usually have high morbidity and mortality, although all of the pigs are susceptible. The etiological agent of PED is porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), which was first recognized in Belgium and the UK in 1978, and it quickly spread in Europe and Asia, resulting in severe economic losses [1\u20134]. In China, PEDV infection is a continuing problem, although a dual-combination kill vaccine against PEDV and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is in use. Since late 2010, PEDV variant infections have become a severe problem in the Chinese swine-production industry. Guangdong, as one of the major swine-producing provinces in China, has suffered economic loss from these new PEDV outbreaks [5\u20138]. Seven strains were isolated in these outbreaks. In the course of our continuous PEDV surveillance activities in Guangdong, we also isolated three Vero-adapted PEDV strains (GDS01\u20133) from Guangdong in 2012 and 2013. Apparently, PEDV infection status has greatly changed since late 2010. Although new variants were isolated, we have less knowledge and understanding of the reason for the circulation and of the molecular profiles of these new isolates.",

            "text": "PEDV is a positive-sense single-strand RNA virus belonging to Group 1 of the genus Alphacoronavirus, within the family Coronaviridae [9]. Its genome organization is similar to other coronaviruses and is arranged into orderly 5\u2032-untranslated regions (5\u2032-UTRs), the polymerase gene, spikes (S), open reading frame 3 gene (ORF3), envelope (E), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N), and 3\u2032-UTR [10]. The structural protein genes, including S, E, M, and N, are located downstream, with the ORF3 gene among the genes as the only accessory gene. Among the structural proteins encoded by the genes mentioned above, the S protein, a glycoprotein peplomer on the viral surface, plays an important role in the process of inducing neutralizing antibodies and specific receptor binding [11]. Several neutralizing peptides (SS2, SS6, 2C10, and COE) have been identified in the spike protein of PEDV [12\u201314]. In addition, mutations within the S gene are also associated with the adaption process in vitro and the induction of attenuation in vivo [15]. Some studies of CoVs S have revealed that the differences within the S protein influence the induction of syncytia in infected cells [15, 16]. To better understand the newly isolated PEDV strains in Guangdong and effectively prevent related outbreaks, it is necessary to investigate the molecular changes of the spike gene of the new variants and compare them with early reference isolates and glycoprotein peplomer vaccine strains. The evaluation of sequence property, primary structure, secondary structure, and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) regions could reveal whether the mutations change the structure and further impact the protein function. The aim of those tests is to form the basic structure profile of PEDV variants with reference strains. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) often strongly affecting the protein functions, N-glycosylation sites, and potential phosphorylation are studied as they relate to virus biology such as survival and virulence. In addition, palmitoylation as a special class of PTMs could enhance the surface hydrophobicity and membrane affinity of protein substrates and then may influence the virulence. Thus, palmitoylation predictions of both early strains and recent strains are needed. In this study, 10 Guangdong strains isolated from 2011 to 2013 and reference strains were evaluated for those bioinformatics features, and meanwhile, phylogenetic analysis of those strains was also performed. These findings provide useful evidence as to the nature of the circulating PEDV strains, and the implications of this study in terms of the strategies for future protection of PEDV infections are also discussed.",

From retrospective study and our analysis, the three substitutions could be seen as the marker, which make PEDV virus easy to live.

These motifs perhaps are related to the virus virulence, however, the virus virulence may be decided by not only the changes present in spike protein but also ORF3 protein according to previous reports [33]. Thus, we also analyzed the ORF3 protein of Guangdong strains and the result showed that the ORF3 of GDS03 presents the characteristic continuous deletion of attenuated vaccine. Previously, the CHGD-01 ORF3 revealed notably five amino acid substitutions from other PEDV isolates [34]; our study found GDS02, GD-1, and GD-A have the same substitutions with the CHGD-01 strain. Furthermore, GDS01, LC, CH-GD-2011, and particularly DX strain present four of five amino acid substitutions; the phylogenetic analysis showed those eight strains cluster in one group (data not shown). We speculated that the ORF3 of Chinese early strain DX maybe the origin of the seven Guangdong strains. These unique amino acid substitutions are further needed to test the virulence.",

In this study, phylogenetic analysis revealed an interesting trend that the after-2010 strains in China or other areas appear to have closer relationships between each other [36]. The findings of the present study suggest that the genetic diversity and molecular characteristics in the sequences of the spike glycoprotein of new isolates may be the basis of the trend.",
