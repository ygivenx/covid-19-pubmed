This symposium is Canada's premier critical care conference and attracts participants from across the country, the United States, Europe, Australia and Asia. The attendance this year was in excess of 900 people and included the disciplines of medicine, nursing, respiratory therapy and other allied health care professionals. The themes of this year's meeting included sepsis, organ donation, blood conservation strategies, acute lung injury and ethics. In addition, many of the plenary addresses reviewed the recent severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) crisis. The discussion surrounding SARS was particularly poignant as Toronto was the North American city most affected by the outbreak.",

Although she never sought medical attention (she eventually died), her son became ill and sought medical attention at Scarborough Grace Hospital in Toronto. It was with this visit that the health care system in Toronto became involved in the spread of SARS, with devastating consequences. There were a total of 375 cases in Ontario and there are presently 43 deaths attributed to SARS.",

Leukoreduction essentially reduces the average white blood cell content in a unit of packed cells from 3.0 \u00d7 109 to 2.5 \u00d7 105. The rationale for leukoreduction is to minimize exposure to transfused leukocytes, which can lead to adverse transfusion reactions or alterations in immunity or inflammation. Since 1999 all blood in Canada has been leukoreduced. A large Canadian study recently examined the effect of this change in practice in adult high-risk surgical patients [3]. Fergusson reviewed the findings of their trial that showed a reduction in mortality, fever and antibiotic use, but failed to demonstrate a change in serious nosocomial infection. Similarly, when they evaluated the effects in neonates (<1250 g) there was evidence of decreased morbidity and ICU stay following the implementation of leukoreduction [4].",

Between 20 and 30% of all blood transfusions occur in the ICU setting, and 85% of patients present in an ICU for longer than 1 week receive a transfusion [5]. Higher transfusion rates have been associated with an increased length of stay and increased mortality versus matched controls [6]. Robert Fowler (University of Toronto) proposed several approaches to decrease the frequency of, and possibly the need for, transfusion in the ICU. Perioperatively, the use of autologous donation, the use of normovolemic hemodilution and the use of cell recovery are possible options. Implementation of a lower hemoglobin threshold for transfusion, limitation in the use of 'routine' daily laboratory work, the use of antifibrinolytics, the use of erythropoietin and a reduction in the amount of phlebotomy performed for the purposes of laboratory testing were all suggested in the ICU. In fact, one ICU study indicated that phlebotomy rates and volumes directly accounted for 30% of all blood transfusions [5]. The use of pediatric phlebotomy tubes in adults and having closed arterial line systems to reduce wastage are viable options that have been shown to significantly reduce blood loss from phlebotomy [7,8].",

In a talk appropriately entitled, 'Still 70?', Hebert revisited the question of what hemoglobin value should be the threshold for transfusion. It seems that clinical practice remains inconsistent. Many people maintain that a value of 70 g/l remains the hemoglobin threshold for transfusion. However, what people think and what they do in daily practice seems to be different. This disparity was emphasized in the anemia and blood transfusion in critically ill patients (ABC) trial. In that study of the transfusion practice of 146 European ICUs, the average hemoglobin at which patients were transfused was 84 \u00b1 1.3 g/l [6]. More randomized controlled trials are needed to answer the question more definitively, particularly in patients with ischemic heart disease. Hebert hinted that a value greater than 70 g/l might be reasonable in patients with ischemic heart disease, with 80 g/l being a possible threshold.",

Given a standard scenario, there was a wide degree of variation in ICU clinicians' decisions about the appropriate levels of care for the given patient [9]. In addition, the confidence of these management choices was highest when the decisions were extreme in nature (i.e. withdrawal of life support) [10]. Factors that predict the implementation of withdrawal of life support include the use of inotropes or vasopressors, physician prediction of an ICU survival of less than 10%, physician prediction of poor residual cognitive function and physician perception of the patient's desire to limit life support [11]. Interestingly, physician prediction of ICU mortality is the greatest independent predictor of ICU death, even greater than the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score or the multiple organ dysfunction score. In summation, Cook stressed that uncertainty exists, as demonstrated in multiple studies examining confidence, predictions, perceptions and discomfort in end-of-life decisions.",

With regards to dying in an ICU, the majority of family members rated their satisfaction with overall care as excellent or very good [14]. For Canadian ICU patients and their family members the most important aspect of achieving quality end-of-life care was having trust in the doctors looking after you. Problem areas that were identified included a perceived gap between patient and family needs, and a shortfall in services to assist with care upon discharge from hospital.

Caregivers rarely decide on their own about a child's end-of-life wishes, as parents' views are involved in the decisions [15,16]. The greatest source of conflict is secondary to poor communication, and this conflict can have serious detrimental effects on the child's care [17]. To prevent conflict, the information given to parents needs to be consistent. They should be reassured that nothing will be done to hasten the death of the child and that drugs will be used only for comfort and palliation [18].",

He based his philosophical discussion on the four main pillars of medical ethics: autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence and distributive justice. During his discussion, Vincent emphasized that any decisions about organ donation needed to represent a balance of these four concepts. Vincent contrasted the North American style of obtained consent for organ donation with the approach of presumed consent practiced in some European centers. In the latter situation, citizens have to register their objection to organ donation or it is presumed that they are willing donors. It was emphasized, however, that if a family of a brain-dead patient indicated that they felt their loved one was against donating, then those wishes should and would be respected. Finally, the issue of nonheart-beating donors was touched upon, and further debate is almost certain as this is becoming a hot topic in transplant and critical care medicine.",

Recommendations were put forth for the minimal clinical criteria for NDD, including the appropriate brain stem reflexes to be tested.

With regards to the apnea test, the recommendation was to achieve PaCO2 \u2265 60 mmHg and \u226520 mmHg above baseline, and pH \u2264 7.28.

The importance of correct antibiotic selection from the start of treatment was stressed, since inappropriate antibiotic coverage from the outset has been shown to increase morbidity and mortality [26-28]. Therefore, if VAP is strongly suspected, the empiric use of broader spectrum antibiotics is probably the best approach. However, the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics can lead to increased resistance, cost and toxicity. To help combat these drawbacks of broad-spectrum antibiotics, Heyland proposed a 'de-escalation' of antibiotic coverage once culture results are available.

A novel method of ruling out the diagnosis is through the interpretation of the waveform that is generated during the performance of the partial thromboplastin time assay. The presence of an abnormal waveform is associated with increased mortality and can be a sensitive and specific indicator of disseminated intravascular coagulation. The waveform changes may also precede the onset of clinical disease by 48 hours [34].

The administration of ethyl pyruvate has been shown to successfully modulate the inflammatory response in animal models of sepsis. Work is underway to evaluate its effects in humans.

The mechanisms of lung injury are complex and can be divided into early (proximal) and late events. One of the first events is bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide binding to toll-like receptors. If this pathway can be interrupted early then the cascade that follows may be stopped or reduced. One possible way to achieve this is by the use of agents that bind lipopolysaccharide, such as antibodies. Techniques to interrupt in the later stages of the sepsis cascade include antioxidants, such as alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E). Interruption of these late stages has been shown in murine models to confer protection even if given 1 hour after the initiating stimulus.",

He proposed that MOF represents cellular shutdown and is a late-stage adaptive response to a prolonged insult. He challenged the audience that meddling with the immune response to prevent MOF may be counter-productive. In defense of this proposal, Singer argued that tissue oxygen levels increase and oxygen consumption decreases during sepsis [40-42]. This is associated with mitochondrial inhibition, yet ATP levels are often preserved [43]. Indeed, during MOF there is little histological evidence of cell death, and if the patient survives so do the organs [44,45]. In a sense, the cells of major organ systems go into a state of hibernation and re-emerge when the illness is resolving. The analogy of hibernation not only applies to the animal kingdom, but can also be appreciated in the phenomenon of 'hibernating' myocardium. Cellular shutdown leading to organ failure may thus just be an adaptive response or a 'last-ditch' effort at organ preservation.",

Lung recruitment may have a role in cases of difficult oxygenation or ventilation and as an early protective strategy in patients with acute lung injury. Evidence does suggest that recruitment maneuvers lead to increased oxygenation, at least in the short term [46]. The success of lung recruitment maneuvers to increase the PaO2/FiO2 ratio depends on the stage of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with increased success early in the course. Other factors include the severity of illness, the type of ARDS, patient positioning and positive end-expiratory pressure settings postmaneuver [47-50]. Recruitment maneuvers have been shown to have low complication rates, with hemodynamic consequences being the most frequent [48]. There are a variety of ways to perform recruitment maneuvers, but most of the maneuvers require the patient to be heavily sedated. Stewart also presented some promising interim analysis of the Lung Open Ventilation Study demonstrating the safety of recruitment maneuvers.",

He eloquently described the physiological interaction between the abdomen and the chest wall during the respiratory cycle. In the supine patient the pressure of the abdominal contents is directed on the diaphragm in a cephelad direction. This subsequently causes atelectasis in the dependent lung zones near the diaphragm. Increases in both chest wall compliance and abdominal pressure will exaggerate this effect. In fact, by decreasing chest wall compliance through the experimental use of weights directly applied to the chest wall, one can demonstrate a reduction in V/Q mismatch and an improvement in oxygenation. Pesenti left the audience with four simple words to remind us of the importance of the abdomen in respiratory mechanics: 'breathe with your belly'.",

The lung seems to be in a unique situation to contribute to multiple organ dysfunction. It receives all of the systemic circulation and contains 25\u201350% of the marginated neutrophil pool. A variety of studies have suggested the connection between lung injury and multiple organ dysfunction. In particular, lung overinflation without positive end-expiratory pressure has been demonstrated to promote bacteremia, and there is pulmonary to systemic translocation of endotoxin [53,54]. In addition, Slutsky discussed ongoing animal research that is looking into the relationship of injurious ventilatory strategies and apoptosis of organs distal to the lung (e.g. kidney, gut). A reduction in cell death was noted in the lung protective strategies in this animal model. Overall, both biochemical and biomechanical injury to the lungs causes the release of a variety of inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines, complement and neutrophils [55]. These mediators in turn may lead to MOF and contribute to the morbidity and mortality beyond the initial lung injury.",

Evidence is mounting that lung protective strategies may reduce the harm to patients secondary to injurious methods of ventilation. However, the knowledge of lung protective strategies has not translated into their widespread use in practice. Gordon Rubenfeld (Washington University) cited many reasons for this discord. Failure to recognize mild forms of acute lung injury/ARDS and lack of knowledge surrounding lung protection are continuing problems. In addition, physician reluctance was seen as a barrier to implementation. The solution to this failure to apply the literature to everyday practice requires several approaches. Better training and improved documentation of patient's ventilation parameters at the bedside are starting points. However, Rubenfeld indicated that standard protocols for ventilation might be the most efficient and effective solution.",

The rationale for using surfactant includes better mechanical function, anti-inflammatory properties and strong evidence in infant respiratory distress syndrome and in animal models. Improved mechanical function relates to less regional overdistention when adequate surfactant is available. Previous attempts to study the use of surfactant replacement in ARDS have not shown an improvement in outcome. However, these studies were complicated by inefficient delivery systems and surfactant preparations that may have been inadequate [56]. More recent studies have pointed to improved oxygenation and possibly a trend towards decreased mortality [57]. Issues that may be important in the effectiveness of surfactant as a therapy include the nature of the lung injury (direct versus indirect), the timing, the protein/phospholipid content and the dosing route.",

Asynchrony between the patient and the ventilator is common in the critically ill. This often leads to ineffective ventilation, to ventilator-related complications (e.g. pneumothorax) and to increases in sedation. Neurally controlled ventilators would have the timing and possibly the magnitude of ventilatory assistance controlled via a neural input from the patient. Diaphragmatic electrical activity can be monitored and can act as a signal to in effect \"inform\" the ventilator about a patient's respiratory cycle. With neurally adjusted ventilators the amount of mechanical support varies from moment to moment according to a mathematical function that converts diaphragmatic electrical activity to ventilator flow and pressure. This mode of ventilation has significant relevance as it stands to improve patient\u2013ventilator synchrony, to reduce requirements for sedation and to facilitate weaning. Future research includes the use of neural-controlled ventilation in neonates and as a noninvasive modality [58].",

Patients were assessed 3, 6 and 12 months after discharge from the critical care unit. With regards to the pulmonary function tests, the lung volumes approached normal values by the 12-month mark, but the diffusion capacity remained substantially lower than predicted. The distance walked over 6 min (a measure of patient functioning) was less than predicted at 12 months. This was attributed to global muscle weakness and wasting, to foot drop, to immobility of large joints and to dyspnea. Surprisingly, 49% of patients had returned to work 1 year after discharge, with the majority in their original position. The absence of systemic corticosteroids, the lack of acquired illness during the ICU stay and the rapid resolution of lung injury were associated with higher functional levels at 1 year.",
