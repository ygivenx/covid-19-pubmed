A minority of patients with H1N1 virus infection (0.3\u201313 %) needed hospitalization, and 10\u201330 % of these developed rapidly progressive pneumonia. The ensuing profound inflammatory response caused the most severe form of acute lung injury, called acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), either isolated or as part of a multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) [1]. ARDS due to this infection was associated with a high mortality rate (14\u201341 %) [1, 2]. Controversy exists regarding use of anti-inflammatory agents such as corticosteroids (CS) for ARDS. While an initial meta-analysis concluded that a definitive role of CS in ARDS was not established, a more recent one reported improved mortality as well as length of stay and less organ dysfunction with early, low- to moderate-dose CS in some subgroups of ARDS patients [3, 4].",

Invasive aspergillosis is also described as a dreaded complication with high mortality in critically ill patients without malignancy or neutropenia [11, 12]. Recent clinical reports suggest that CS therapy may be associated with increased ICU-acquired pneumonia and possibly favor fungal superinfection in patients with H1N1 virus infection [8, 13]. However, in these studies, including 465 patients, only 2 % of critically ill patients with H1N1 virus infection were found to develop invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA). In addition, case reports of IPA as a fungal superinfection in critically patients with H1N1 virus infection have been described recently [13\u201318].",

The medical ICU of UZL has 17 beds, whereas the mixed ICU of UZA has 45 beds. Patients <18 years old were excluded.

Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis was diagnosed based on the revised EORTC/MSG consensus group (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Mycoses Study Group) guidelines [19]. Patients had proven IPA if there was microscopic evidence of dichotomous branching hyphae with positive culture for Aspergillus spp. from endobronchial biopsy (not BAL), irrespective of host factors or clinical features. Probable IPA required a host factor, clinical features, and mycological evidence of aspergillosis. Since host factors in the revised EORTC definitions are basically intended for immunocompromised hematological patients, we defined broader risk factors, based on \u201cmodified EORTC criteria,\u201d according to our previous prospective study on the value of BAL for diagnosis of Aspergillus in ICU patients [20]. Mycological evidence was based on microscopy or culture of Aspergillus spp. cultured from a BAL specimen or a galactomannan (GM) optical index >0.5 from a BAL or serum sample. Sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for GM detection (Platelia Aspergillus; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Marnes-la-Coquette, France) was performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer [20, 21]. Lower tract respiratory samples were inoculated onto a Sabouraud agar (2 days at 37 \u00b0C and another 19 days at 30 \u00b0C) for fungal isolation. Aspergillus species were identified by their culture characteristics and morphologies. During the study period, routine baseline monitoring was performed in the ICU and in all high-risk wards taking care of oncology, hematology, and transplant patients. This monitoring was performed at least once a year [22]. Severity of illness was assessed based on the Acute Physiology and Chronic Evaluation Score (APACHE) II score and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score 24 h after admission. Patients were considered immunosuppressed at baseline in case of underlying malignant hematological disease, solid-organ transplant recipient, or any other illness necessitating immunosuppressive therapy. Neutropenia was defined as neutrophils <500/mm3 for >10 days. In both centers, the doses and frequency of all drugs administered in the month before and during admission to the ICU were recorded in the medical records and the patient data management system (PDMS, Metavision; iMDsoft, Boston, USA). Day of ICU admission was called day 0. All CS doses are expressed in mg hydrocortisone equivalent. Outcome measures included ICU or hospital survival and length of stay, days of organ support [mechanical ventilation, inhaled nitric oxide (NO) or high-frequency rescue ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), vasopressor, renal replacement therapy], and ICU complications (bacteremia, ventilator-associated pneumonia). In both centers, CS were started on ICU in patients with refractory shock and/or late ARDS, according to the treating physician\u2019s judgement.",

Figure 1 reflects the distribution of H1N1 cases in ICU over time and the proportion of those patients who were diagnosed with IPA. In all 40 included H1N1 patients, at least one lower tract respiratory sample was inoculated onto a Sabouraud agar for fungal isolation. Aspergillus fumigatus was isolated in lower respiratory tract sample cultures of 8/9 cases of IPA. In one IPA patient, microbiological data were limited to GM detection in BAL and serum, in combination with new bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray and macroscopic white pseudomembranous lesions on bronchoscopy. Unfortunately, the biopsy specimens of these bronchial lesions were lost for microscopic or microbiological processing. Five patients had \u201cproven\u201d disease. \u201cProbable\u201d infection was diagnosed in the other 4/9 patients. All but one of the latter four patients had positive Aspergillus BAL cultures, and all four patients had a positive BAL GM (Table 2). All patients who received amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate or piperacillin\u2013tazobactam in the 5 days before a positive GM detection had multiple confirmatory positive GM samples clearly separated in time (\u22654 days later) from the latest administration of these antibiotics (n = 3) or had \u201cproven\u201d fungal infection (n = 1). All IPA patients received voriconazole for 43 \u00b1 19 days. At the time of the ICU admissions, there were no works in progress in either of the two hospitals in the vicinity of the patients\u2019 wards. In both centers, extensive environmental fungal sampling is performed regularly in the ICU and the hospital wards. During both H1N1 seasons only very few environmental fungal isolates could be detected, and there was no increase compared with previous years. Four of nine IPA patients were transferred from a referral hospital, and no data regarding environmental fungal sampling in these referral hospitals were available. Table 1 presents the differences in baseline characteristics, risk factors, and outcome parameters between IPA and non-IPA patients. IPA patients were mostly men. No patients were known with liver cirrhosis or had neutropenia during their ICU stay. There was no difference in the number of IPA versus non-IPA patients developing ventilator-associated pneumonia, but IPA patients had more bacteremia during ICU admission. Importantly, ICU stay [26 (13\u201369) versus 15 (7\u201325) days, p = 0.03] and hospital length of stay [58 (26\u201365) versus 23 (12\u201336) days, p = 0.02] were significantly higher in IPA versus non-IPA patients. ICU and hospital mortality tended to be higher in IPA patients, without reaching statistical significance.\n\n",

Five of the nine IPA patients had proven IPA, based on microscopic evidence of Aspergillus in endobronchial biopsy. Four IPA patients were diagnosed with probable IPA using the modified EORTC criteria for ICU patients as published previously [20]. Increasing evidence indeed shows that ICU patients frequently develop IPA even without the classical risk factors according to the revised EORTC criteria [12, 20, 23\u201326]. This is an inherent limitation that applies to all reports on incidence of invasive aspergillosis in ICU patients. De Pauw et al. [19] also explicitly acknowledge this limitation in their paper on the revised EORTC definitions. The modified diagnosis of probable IPA in our ICU population should be further examined in multicentric studies. Finally, the key message of this paper is to draw the attention of the ICU physician to the fact that new risk categories for developing IPA (such as H1N1 with steroid use) may be identified, indicating the need for a high level of clinical vigilance to detect such extremely dangerous but treatable co-infection.",

[9] found similar results: 1.6 % of 245 critically ill H1N1 patients were diagnosed with IPA. In comparison with these two studies, we noticed that our H1N1 patients were sicker and received more CS prior to ICU admission, which could explain the higher incidence of IPA in our study. Moreover, our diagnostic approach included not only BAL cultures, but also implementation of GM detection in serum and BAL. This latter test has been validated as a valuable diagnostic tool in a prospective study in our ICU [20]. Extensive environmental fungal sampling in the ICUs as well as in the hospital wards did not indicate an outbreak of IPA during the study period in both ICUs. A few years before the H1N1 flu seasons, Meersseman et al. [12] reported incidences of proven and probable IPA on the same ICU unit (UZL) where the current study was performed [12, 20]. In a retrospective study between January 2000 and 2003, 5.7 % (105/1,850) of ICU patients had proven or probable IPA [12]. In a prospective follow-up study between July 2005 and December 2006, the same authors found 3 % (34/1,109) of ICU patients to have proven or probable IPA [20]. Besides a high incidence of IPA and in line with others, we also found a worse outcome of IPA patients: ICU and hospital length of stay were significantly higher in IPA patients [27].",

            "text": "There are several reasons why critically ill patients with pneumonia due to H1N1 are at risk for developing aspergillosis. First, influenza viruses have been reported to cause cell-mediated destruction of airway epithelium and disruption of normal mucociliary clearance, fostering colonization and invasion with Aspergillus spp. [28\u201330]. Since 1952, 32 cases of Aspergillus superinfection associated with influenza have been reported [14, 15, 31]. A recent study of lung pathology in fatal H1N1 cases suggested that viral overload leads to altered immune responses, as with fatal H5N1 cases [32]. H1N1 leads to a necrotic pneumonia, as shown by increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, being an ideal breeding medium for fungal colonization and growth of hyphae. Secondly, CS is frequently administered in conjunction with antiviral agents in order to limit inflammation in lung parenchyma. CS diminish host defenses and are increasingly recognized as a risk factor for developing aspergillosis in ICU patients [12, 23]. CS exert their immunosuppressive effects via transcriptional inhibition of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-\u03baB), leading to inhibition of cellular immunity [monocytes, T-lymphocytes, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs)] which is essential for defense against IPA [23, 33]. Moreover, in vitro experiments showed enhanced growth of Aspergillus spp. on CS exposure. Finally, CS may also hinder the efficacy of antifungal therapy [33, 34]. Administration of CS may be especially detrimental in severe influenza pneumonia, possibly by favoring persistent viral replication. This is also suggested by different recent clinical reports [10, 13, 35, 36]. As in H1N1, Li et al. [37] reported that CS administration resulted in increased rates of secondary infections in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients. However, the retrospective design of our study does not allow conclusions about causal relationships between H1N1, CS, and IPA. The limited number of patients in this study also limits the robustness of the multivariate analysis. In our study, early CS administration before ICU admission appeared to be relevant, since IPA was acquired early after ICU admission.",

Use of CS prior to ICU admission appeared to be one of the main risk factors. These findings may have consequences for daily clinical practice. The threshold to actively search for invasive aspergillosis in critically ill H1N1 patients (via BAL cultures and GM detection) should be low, and patients who are treated with CS warrant special attention. Moreover, one should be cautious about giving steroids to mechanically ventilated patients suffering from H1N1. These conclusions need further confirmation in larger studies.",
