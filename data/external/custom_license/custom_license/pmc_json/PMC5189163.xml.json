Three samples were positive for HEV; we performed complete genome sequencing of these samples as described (Technical Appendix) (5,7). We also performed comparative genomic analysis as previously described (1,2,8).

Whole-genome sequencing of the 3 Bactrian camel HEV (BcHEV) strains (GenBank accession nos. KX387865\u20137) showed genome sizes of 7,212\u20137,223 bp and a G + C content of 52.7%\u201353.1%. Overall, nucleotides in the BcHEV genome differed by >20% compared with those in all other HEVs. Genomes of the 3 BcHEV isolates contained 3 major ORFs; genome organization was typical of and characteristics were similar to those of HEVs from other Orthohepevirus A species. Phylogenetic trees constructed using ORF1, ORF2, ORF3, and concatenated ORF1/ORF2, excluding the hypervariable region, showed that these 3 BcHEV isolates clustered with the 2 dromedary camel HEV7 strains and the HEV7 strain from the liver-transplant recipient with chronic hepatitis (Figure; Technical Appendix Figure 1) (5,6). However, amino acid distances based on the concatenated ORF1/ORF2, excluding the hypervariable region of the 3 BcHEV isolates and the existing genotypes, ranged from 0.095 to 0.148, which was greater than the threshold (p-distance = 0.088) to demarcate intergenotype distance (1,2). Using this criterion, we propose that the 3 BcHEV isolates should constitute a new HEV genotype, HEV8.",

Even though HEV is an emerging pathogen in the Middle East, limited sequence data exist regarding the virus on the Arabian Peninsula. Recently, we discovered the HEV7 genotype in 1.5% of 203 feces samples from dromedaries in Dubai (5). In the current study, we detected a new HEV genotype in 1.5% of 205 Bactrian camels on a farm in Xinjiang. Comparative genomic and phylogenetic analyses showed that BcHEV represents a previously unrecognized HEV genotype. It has been shown that HEV7 from dromedaries can be transmitted to humans; thus, meat and milk from Bactrian camels might pose a similar risk to humans. The increasing discoveries of camel viruses and of their transmission to humans highlight the need for caution when handling these mammals and processing food products derived from them.",

The tree was constructed using the maximum-likelihood method using the Jones\u2013Taylor\u2013Thornton substitution model with invariant sites and gamma distributed rate variation. The analysis included 2,282 amino acid positions (aa residues 1\u2013706 and 789\u20132409, numbered with reference to GenBank sequence M73218). Bold indicates the 3 strains of BcHEV with complete genomes sequenced in this study. GenBank accession numbers are shown in parentheses. Scale bar indicates the estimated number of substitutions per 20 aa. ORF, open-reading frame.",
