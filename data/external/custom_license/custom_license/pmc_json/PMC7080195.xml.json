In a few weeks, the new agent causing this \"severe acute respiratory syndrome\" (SARS), a coronavirus, has been identified, sequenced, and tests have been developed for diagnosis [1]. As of the end of April 2003, about 5,000 suspected or probable cases have been reported to the WHO from 27 countries [2], with a vast majority from inland China (57% of reported cases), which appears to be at the origin of the epidemic, and Hong Kong (32%). In other countries from the Asian continent, which appear to have been secondarily affected, reported cases have been few so far, e.g., Singapore (4% of reported cases), Vietnam (1%) and Taiwan (<1%). Altogether, 95% of the cases have been reported from Asian countries. Interestingly, the epidemic seems to have rapidly abated in Vietnam, from where no new cases have been reported since mid-April.",

As of 26 April 2003, 142 suspected or probable cases have been reported from Canada; in the US, 41 such cases have been reported [4].

In addition, there are special features to this epidemic which are of particular concern. Most cases reported from outside the Asian countries can be traced to people who have traveled to an affected area and come into close contact with a suspected or confirmed case, consistent with droplet transmission. However, there is concern that indirect transmission via inanimate environment or fomites may occur because of persistence of the virus for hours on surfaces, or even airborne transmission, given epidemiological information gathered from clusters in Hong Kong. In addition, health care workers have been affected to a large extent, probably because of insufficient awareness and lack of precautions taken at the earlier stage of the epidemic. For example, such workers accounted for about half the cases reported from a large outbreak in Hong Kong [5].",

The crude mortality rate is currently estimated at <5%, and most fatalities have occurred in people with underlying disease. This rate needs to be reassessed, however, once a reliable diagnostic test becomes widely available. The early Toronto cases have had a higher mortality rate because of a high rate of severe respiratory failure requiring ICU admission, with about 20% of patients receiving mechanical ventilation. Risk factors for mortality were analyzed in the Hong Kong outbreak: higher age, high serum lactate dehydrogenase (pointing to lung injury), and high absolute neutrophil counts were found associated with fatalities.",

In this issue of Intensive Care Medicine, Lapinsky and Hawrylucks review the questions the staff must address when a patient with SARS is admitted to the ICU [6]. The first problem is identifying the patient as having suspected SARS. This may be especially difficult in areas where the disease has been rare up to now. As the epidemic continues to spread, and secondary or tertiary cases become more prevalent, a history of traveling to the areas most affected up to now or of contact with a patient suspected of SARS may no longer be enough to raise clinical suspicion. As the authors point out in their review of the clinical presentation of the syndrome, based on their experience in Canada, clinical and radiological findings are non-specific, and point to an \"atypical pneumonia\" syndrome, although radiographic features appear somewhat suggestive after a few days.",

            "text": "Perhaps the most important part of the paper by Lapinsky and Hawrylucks is their detailed account of isolation precautions in the ICU to protect personnel, other patients and visitors of a patient affected with SARS. Many procedures are performed in the ICU which may expose both personnel and the patient's environment to contamination. Altogether, the authors' recommendation is to avoid as much as possible at-risk procedures, ranging from bronchoscopy to transport of the patient outside the ICU. Certainly, the most important component of protection is wearing a mask, with the same specifications as for tuberculosis, i.e., a surgical mask for the patient to avoid droplet spreading, and a \"respirator\" for personnel, i.e., masks that provide at least 95% filtration for microparticles (<0.2 \u00b5m), and which have <10% leakage around the mask to prevent inhalation of airborne infective material; to be effective, these masks have to fit tightly to the face. The recommendation also includes equipment of ventilators with filters, equipment placed in the room of affected patients, and precautions during procedures that involve a risk of droplet shedding. Their recommendations will be extremely useful to all units faced with this problem. As pointed out by the authors, these are likely to evolve rapidly as new information is gathered.",

Information on the syndrome has been disseminated at full speed and has been updated on a daily basis. The internet has contributed much to this ease of dissemination and updating, so that public awareness has been maximized within a minimum time frame. While Gerberding has questioned whether the global response steps have been taken fast enough to contain the epidemic [1], it is difficult to envision a quicker pace for control of an emerging disease such as SARS.",
