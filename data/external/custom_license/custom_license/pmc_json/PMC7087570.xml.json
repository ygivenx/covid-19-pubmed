Several species have very large geographical ranges and may exhibit partially migratory or nomadic lifestyles with food availability likely to be the most significant factor driving movement patterns (Fleming and Eby, 2003). Previous studies of the long-distance movement of flying-foxes have used radiotelemetry and banding techniques. However, these approaches have limited application due to the spatial scale involved. Satellite telemetry has the potential to overcome this limitation and has been utilized to track a small number of individuals of Pteropus poliocephalus, Pteropus vampyrus, and Eidolon helvum (Tidemann and Nelson, 2004; Richter and Cumming, 2008; Epstein et al., 2009).",

Nipah virus also has been detected by PCR in P. lylei from Thailand (Wacharapluesadee et al., 2005) and evidence of exposure to henipaviruses or related viruses has been reported from bats in Indonesia (Sendow et al., 2009), China (Li et al., 2008), Bangladesh (Hsu et al., 2004), India (Epstein et al., 2008), Madagascar (Iehle et al., 2007), and Ghana (Hayman et al., 2008). The potential for overlap in distribution of Hendra and Nipah viruses and for flying-foxes to act as vectors for long-distance transmission of these viruses is largely unknown. Nipah virus, which (in Bangladesh) has transmitted directly from human to human, appears to pose a greater threat to human populations than Hendra virus because it has been responsible for many more human deaths, and has so far had much greater economic impact (Field et al., 2007; Wacharapluesadee et al. 2009).",

Transmitter duty cycles were set for transmission periods of 7\u201312 h every 120\u2013155 h depending on PTT model. One location fix comprised of latitude, longitude, time of transmission, and accuracy of location data (Error Class). Individual fixes were assigned to one of seven error classes by Argos; fixes falling in the most accurate four error classes were used in this study.

Pteropus alecto has not previously been reported to make long-distance movements and, as a dietary generalist, it has been suggested that this species may be more sedentary than P. poliocephalus and P. scapulatus, which are primarily nectarivorous and follow seasonal pulses of nectar (Parry-Jones and Augee, 1992; Markus and Hall, 2004). A 12-month radiotelemetry study of P. alecto in northern Australia by Palmer and Woinarski (1999) showed a maximum roost-to-roost movement of 133 km, with a mean of 35 km; Woinarski et al. (2007) reported an approximate 25 km crossing over sea from mainland Australia to Melville and Bathurst Islands for this species. However, a genetic study of P. alecto in eastern and northern Australia, using allozyme electrophoresis, has indicated a high level of gene flow among populations, suggesting long-distance movements may indeed occur among populations within Australia (Webb and Tidemann, 1996).",

The limited historical records of P. alecto on mainland New Guinea may reflect a lack of previous survey effort, a recent northern expansion of the range, or an increased abundance of this species in the area. Consistent with the latter interpretation is the finding that P. alecto has expanded its range southwards along the east coast of Australia, from the Mary River in the 1930s (Ratcliffe, 1932) to Sydney in 2007 (Parry-Jones, 2007), a distance of more than 950 km.",

In the present study, the movement patterns have shown this species forages among islands in the Fly River delta with a radius of 73 and 31 km covered by bats F and G respectively, less than some P. alecto (139, 175, and 248 km radii for bats A, C, and D, respectively).

However, genetic studies, incorporating all claimed subspecies, do not show differentiation, thus suggesting high levels of gene flow between populations in peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra, Java, Borneo, and the Lesser Sunda Islands (Olival, 2008). Individuals of this species have been recorded travelling up to 50 km per night and flying short distances between islands to forage (Mickleburgh et al., 1992). In the present study, P. vampyrus yielded the least data of the three species monitored in terms of duration of transmission, with a combined total of only 94 days of movements being recorded. Bat I moved from Timor-Leste to Indonesian West Timor, and both individuals showed foraging activity in areas of cultivated plants and human settlements. The apparent limited mobility of these bats is at odds with other studies (below), and it is possible that our findings are confounded by the limited duration of transmission, which may have precluded seasonal or biological pressures that induce greater distance movement. Satellite telemetry has previously been used to track the movements of P. vampyrus in peninsular Malaysia and Sumatra with four animals travelling across approximately 50 km of open sea (the Strait of Malacca) from peninsular Malaysia to Sumatra, and later returning to peninsular Malaysia (Daszak et al., 2006; Olival and Higuchi, 2006; Epstein et al., 2009). The movements of three bats, tracked for 84\u2013112 days, and travelling average distances of 26, 30, and 58 km per week (total distances 360, 810, and 420 km) (Olival and Higuchi, 2006) were greater than the distances travelled by P. vampyrus in the present study (11 and 19 km per week), and comparable to those of P. alecto and P. neohibernicus.",

Hendra virus has been isolated from P. alecto, and this species is believed to be one of the reservoirs for this virus (Halpin et al., 2000). Neutralizing antibodies to Hendra virus have been found in P. neohibernicus from the north coast of Papua New Guinea (Mackenzie, 1999), and neutralizing antibodies to Nipah virus have been found in P. vampyrus on peninsular Malaysia (Johara et al., 2001), Java and Sumatra (Sendow et al., 2006). Thus, each of these pteropid species has the potential to transmit Nipah or Hendra viruses. The frequency and scale of transboundary movements add to the findings of previous studies and further demonstrate the potential for the introduction of henipaviruses and other bat-associated infectious diseases to adjacent populations, and/or indicate the likelihood of this having occurred in the past.",

Similarly P. scapulatus is widespread in northern Australia, including the Torres Strait islands but has only been reported from New Guinea on one occasion (Waithman, 1979). Our study suggests that for P. alecto, Torres Strait seems to be readily traversable and that a contiguous population of P. alecto may occur from northern Australia, through the TransFly region of Papua New Guinea into southeast Papua, Indonesia. Hence, the flying-foxes in these three areas may share the same pathogens, including henipaviruses and others, such as lyssaviruses and Dengue virus.",

They are taxa of high conservation concern; 27 of the 52 Pteropus species are considered threatened with extinction, with hunting and habitat loss identified as the main drivers of population declines (IUCN, 2010). The hunting of flying-foxes for food occurs across the area covered by this study and increasingly frequent contact between bats and humans may facilitate disease spillover. The present study shows the potential for close connectivity between flying-fox populations on the Australian and New Guinean land masses, and underscores the importance of consultative cross-border approaches in disease risk management and conservation planning. It also suggests the possibility that P. alecto may range more widely than P. neohibernicus, highlighting the potential heterogeneity of movement patterns among flying-fox species. A thorough understanding of flying-fox movement dynamics and the processes that drive them is a necessary prerequisite for mapping the risk of emergence of infectious disease from bats to humans and domestic animals. Assessment of the risk of disease emergence across regions and national boundaries can then meaningfully inform disease surveillance and management strategies, facilitating appropriate and efficient use of limited resources.",
