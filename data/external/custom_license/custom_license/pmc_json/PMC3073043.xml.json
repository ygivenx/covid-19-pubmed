The increase in bone resorption is due both to increased osteoclastogenesis and to decreased osteoclast apoptosis (2,3). Osteoclasts may also play a role in the etiology of post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA), the most common form of arthritis. At an early stage of disease pathogenesis, there is a phase of increased bone resorption and turnover in periarticular subchondral bone volume and an increased number of osteoclasts, prior to later stage sclerosis and eburnation(4). Similarly, increased osteoclast functional activity is directly responsible for the generalized bone loss that occurs in rheumatoid arthritis (5). Thus, we hypothesized that an antiresorptive strategy that selectively targets osteoclasts and/or carries an active drug to osteoclast cells directly would be highly desirable as a therapeutic to treat bone disease involving upregulated osteoclast activity.",

The principle behind staining of TRAP involves the use of napthol AS phosphates in conjunction with fast garnet GBC salts for the detection of acid phosphatase. This diazonium fast garnet GBC salt was selected because it couples rapidly at acid pH, forming insoluble dye deposits. Napthol AS-BI, released by enzymatic hydrolysis, couples immediately with fast garnet GBC salt, resulting in the formation of insoluble maroon deposits at sites of activity. Tartaric acid was used in order to demonstrate the presence of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase. Hence, cells containing tartrate-sensitive acid phosphatase are devoid of activity, and only the cells containing tartrate acid-resistant phosphatase show maroon dye deposits at the sites of activity. Staining confirmed that the presence of TRAP-positive multinucleated osteoclast-like cells was limited to those wells dosed with exogenous M-CSF and RANKL, under the cell culture conditions described (Fig. 5).\n",

            "text": "To determine the in vitro efficacy of the anti-RANK mAb-sCT conjugate on osteoclast activity, we quantified osteoclast activity using a spectrophotometric total culture TRAP activity assay and a mineral resorption assay. TRAP has been shown to be a specific and sensitive indicator of bone resorption (36) and contributes to the intracellular processing of primary bone matrix degradation products prior to its final release through the basolateral membrane of resorbing osteoclast cells (37,38). Osteoclasts, as the bone-resorbing cells of the body, further show the ability to dissolve the mineralized inorganic phase of bone matrix known as hydroxyapatite (39). We found that the use of our conjugate in culture significantly reduced TRAP enzyme activity as compared to sCT alone, and use of the mAb alone also showed inhibition of TRAP enzyme activity. Although the cause for this effect shown by our anti-RANK antibody alone has not been tested, we speculate that in binding the RANK receptor, the antibody may be functioning as a receptor antagonist. That competitive binding would interfere with the interaction of RANKL with RANK, an essential step of osteoclast differentiation. Nonetheless, further antiresorptive and/or anabolic effector functions could be attributed with the development of a targeted delivery strategy to osteoclast cell receptors. We further evaluated if the mAb-sCT conjugate had an effect on the ability of osteoclasts to resorb bone. We cultured osteoclast-like cells on calcium phosphate-coated culture plates in the presence of conjugate, antibody or sCT. We found that both the conjugate and the mAb alone were capable of significantly reducing the resorption of mineral layer as compared to the sCT alone. Then, we performed cyclic AMP assay to confirm that bioactivity of conjugated calcitonin. Human breast carcinoma T47D cells known to express the calcitonin receptor were used for this purpose. Binding of sCT with its receptor activates adenylyl cyclase, an enzyme responsible for the generation of cAMP. Our in vitro cAMP assay results confirmed that the modification of sCT by conjugation did not interfere with its ability to bind the calcitonin receptor and trigger its biological activity. We measured the conjugate to have increased activity over calcitonin alone, and the exact reason for that effect is still not clear. It is likely our conjugation strategy allowed one mole of antibody to become conjugated with greater than one mole of calcitonin. It has been reported that when IgG is treated with a 10 molar excess of Traut\u2019s reagent, 3-7 thiol groups are generated, which may result in the attachment of 3-7 PEGylated calcitonin molecules per molecule of IgG.",

Studies have that RANKL-RANK signaling controls the development of lactating mammary glands in pregnancy, with the highest levels being at day 15.5 in mice (40,41). Several studies that looked at transgenic Rankl-/- and Rank-/- mice found that there was a complete absence of lymph nodes (42). This led to further studies involving patients with an osteoclast-poor form of the autosomal recessive osteopetrosis (ARO), where they found the cause of the disease to be various mutations in RANKL (43). The same research then found that these patients showed no palpable signs of lymph nodes, further strengthening the theory that RANKL-RANK signaling is involved in lymph node formation in humans. RANK is further known to be expressed by monocyte/macrophages and dendritic cells, specialized immune cells programmed to capture and process antigens in the body and present them to na\u00efve T-cells (44). However, the targeting of drug \u201ccargo\u201d to the RANK receptors of those cells may not necessarily result in drug action with those cells if the cargo is carefully chosen not to affect those cell types. For example, it is highly unlikely for any cell (other than the mature osteoclast) to express both the RANK receptor and calcitonin receptor at the same time. Thus, the Boolean \u201cand/or\u201d logic can be applied to the selection of the differential cargo targeting to cellular phenotypes expressing the RANK receptor at any given time. The extent of this limitation remains to be fully determined, however, should not necessarily preclude the further exploration of RANK receptor targeting strategies, which may in turn provide a more comprehensive understanding of RANK signaling and crosstalk with other signaling pathways.",

This drug-delivery strategy may find utility as \u201ca universal osteoclast-targeting platform\u201d in order to directly target and deliver antiresorptive agents, anti-inflammatory agents, cathepsin K inhibitors, disintegrins, H+-ATPase inhibitors, and so on, directly to osteoclast cells. We have shown this platform is capable of being employed as an antiresorptive strategy, and our efforts will now center on the in vivo evaluation of this targeting strategy.",
