The frequency and importance of emerging new pathogens have significant implications for therapy.

Fever was moderate, continuous in nature without any chills or rigors. Breathlessness was gradual in onset and progressive in nature. Cough was productive; the sputum was yellowish green in color and around 30 ml/day with occasional hemoptysis. There was no history of any recent weight loss, loss of appetite, burning micturition, chest pain, swelling of lower limbs, orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. He had suffered from pulmonary tuberculosis 12 years ago in 2001 and had taken complete treatment for it.",

Chest X-ray [Figure 1] showed bilateral fibro infiltrative Koch's with cavities in right upper lobe. There was volume loss of the right lung and mediastinal shift to right. Computed tomography-thorax [Figure 2, 3 and 4] was suggestive of features of old pulmonary Koch's with residual bilateral bronchiectasis and secondary infection. There was no evidence of any malignancy. Sputum examination was negative for acid fast bacilli. Sputum cultures carried out with the help of calorimetric VITEK-2 card identified A. denitrificans, repeatedly on two samples without any concurrent infection. It was sensitive to meropenem, imipenem, piperacillin, ticarcillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and third generation cephalosporins. It was resistant to all the aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, tetracycline and first and second generation cephalosporins. Blood cultures were sterile. Coagulation profile, renal functions, liver functions, electrolytes were within the normal limits.",
