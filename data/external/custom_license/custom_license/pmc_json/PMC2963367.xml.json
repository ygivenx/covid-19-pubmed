            "text": "The genome of SARS-CoV contains a single-stranded plus-sense RNA of \u223c29.7 kb\n(2). At the molecular level, CoVs employ a\nvariety of unusual strategies to accomplish a complex program of gene expression (5). Coronavirus replication requires the synthesis of\nboth genomic and multiple subgenomic RNA species and the assembly of progeny virions by\na pathway that is unique among enveloped RNA viruses (5\u20137). Fourteen open reading frames (ORFs) have been identified, of\nwhich 12 are located in the 3\u2032-end of the genome. The other two ORFs (1a and\n1b), which are located in the 5\u2032-proximal two-thirds of the genome, encode two\nlarge polyproteins translated directly from genomic RNA. ORF 1b is expressed by a\n\u22121 ribosomal frameshifting at the end of pp1a, extending its coding sequence and\nthus generating the pp1ab polyprotein (6). These\ntwo polyproteins are cleaved into 16 functional viral replicase proteins called nsp1 to\n-16 (for non-structural proteins 1\u201316). Those nsps form the membrane-bound\nreplication-transcription complex, which is localized to a network of endoplasmic\nreticulum-derived membranes in the infected cell (8, 9). Bioinformatics, structural\nbiology, (reverse) genetics, and biochemical studies have contributed to the\ncharacterization of CoV nsps (10). Many enzymatic\nactivities have been documented for products of ORF 1a and ORF 1b. Among these are the\nproteolytic activities endowed by nsp3 and nsp5, required to mature pp1a and pp1ab\npolyproteins into individual non-structural proteins (11, 12); the RNA-dependent RNA\npolymerase by nsp12, and a putative RNA primase, nsp8, involved in replication and\ntranscription (13\u201315); several RNA modification\nenzymes, such as nsp14, an exoribonuclease, nsp15, an endoribonuclease, and nsp13, a\nhelicase/RNA triphosphatase (16, 17); and two\nS-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet)-dependent methyltransferases\ncarried by nsp14 (N7-MTase) and nsp16 (2\u2032O-MTase) (18\u201320). In addition, some of\nthese nsps have thus far no known function nor enzymatic activity, and/or their\nfunctions remain more elusive (nsp1, nsp2, nsp4, nsp6, nsp9, nsp10, and nsp11), even if\nsome of them may regulate host cellular functions (nsp1, nsp4, and nsp6) or enzymatic\nactivities from the replication-transcription complex (10).",

Although no CoV guanylyltransferase (16\u201323) activity has been identified, CoVs are likely to follow the canonical\ncapping pathway involving (i) an RNA triphosphatase that removes the 5\u2032\n\u03b3-phosphate group of the mRNA; (ii) a guanylyltransferase that catalyzes the\ntransfer of GMP to the remaining 5\u2032-diphosphate terminus; and (iii) an N7-MTase\nthat methylates the cap guanine at the N7-position, producing the 7MeGpppN\n\u201ccap 0 structure.\u201d Cap 1 structure formation requires an additional\n2\u2032O-MTase, that methylates the ribose\n2\u2032O-position of the first nucleotide of the mRNA.

The crystal structure of nsp10 shows that it\nbelongs to the zinc finger protein family (22,\n28, 29). nsp10 has no known enzymatic activity but may have a role in the regulation\nof enzymatic activities at different steps of the viral transcription/replication or by\nplaying an architectural role. This hypothesis is supported by the micromolar affinity\nbinding of both MHV and SARS-CoV nsp10 to single-stranded RNA (28, 30). In MHV, nsp10 plays\na critical role in RNA synthesis, and a temperature-sensitive nsp10 Q65E mutation causes\na defect in minus-strand RNA synthesis, whereas plus-strand synthesis is unaffected\n(31). Furthermore, the role of nsp10 in MHV\nreplication was confirmed by alanine-scanning mutagenesis of residues conserved among\nCoVs (22). Viable mutants synthesized lower\namounts of viral RNA, and lethal mutants delineated a core structure of nsp10\nsurrounding the zinc fingers (22). Also nsp10\nacts as an essential co-factor triggering nsp16 2\u2032O-MTase\nactivity, suggesting its involvement in the regulation of viral RNA capping (1). Altogether, these studies suggest that the nsp10\nand nsp16 protein-protein complex might define a new target for antiviral molecules\nagainst pathogenic CoVs, such as the SARS-CoV.",

We therefore analyzed the\nfunctional consequences of nsp10 mutations on nsp16\n2\u2032O-MTase activity. The nsp16\n2\u2032O-MTase activity was first determined by\nincubating 200 nm purified nsp16 with an increasing concentration of\nwild type nsp10 (1 nm to 3.2 \u03bcm), in the presence of\na short capped RNA substrate (7MeGpppAC4; Fig. 5A,\nsquare). Fifty percent of the maximal\n2\u2032O-MTase activity was obtained when 200\nnm purified nsp16 was incubated with 1200 nm nsp10 (Fig. 5A). These conditions\nwere chosen to assess the stimulating or inactivating effect of nsp10 mutant\nproteins on nsp16 2\u2032O-MTase activity. Under these\nconditions, any slight alteration of nsp10 binding strength to nsp16 should\nresult in a significant increase or decrease of nsp16\n2\u2032O-MTase activity (Fig. 5A). For this purpose, 14 His6 tag\nnsp10 mutants were produced in E. coli and purified. The\nbottom panel of Fig.\n5B shows that the mutant proteins migrated in\nSDS-PAGE at a molecular mass similar to that of wild type nsp10 protein (15\nkDa) upon SDS-PAGE with a minor contaminant detected around 50 kDa. Fig. 5B shows that one\nmutant protein overstimulates nsp16 2\u2032O-MTase activity\n(Y96F), whereas almost all of the others were not active in potentiating the\nnsp16 2\u2032O-MTase activity. Overall, there was excellent\ncorrelation between the BRET analysis and the ability of nsp10 mutant proteins\nto stimulate nsp16 enzyme activity; all nsp10 mutant proteins with reduced\nnsp16 affinity as judged by BRET assay (BRET value ranging from 10 to 50%) also\nlose their stimulating effect on nsp16 2\u2032O-MTase\nactivity (V42A, M44A, G70A, R78A/G, K93A/E, G94D, and Y96I/V/A) (Figs. 3A and 4A). Furthermore, two mutant\nproteins, G94A and K95A, that bind nsp16 with a slightly reduced affinity in\nour BRET assay (60 and 80%, respectively) are still able to stimulate nsp16\n2\u2032O-MTase activity (compare Figs. 3A and 5B). These data confirm that the binding of nsp10\nto nsp16 is absolutely required to stimulate the nsp16-mediated\n2\u2032O-MTase.",

This central core is resistant to mutations because any modification\nwithin this region induces a lethal phenotype (22). It is therefore tempting to hypothesize that the phenotype observed by\nDonaldson et al. (22) reflects\nthe importance of the nsp10-nsp16 interaction during CoV replication. Moreover, most of\nthe residues involved in the interaction between nsp10 and nsp16 are also involved in\nits stimulating effect on the nsp16 2\u2032O-MTase activity.

This\nhypothesis is strengthened by the G70A and K93A mutant proteins that retain 50% of\nbinding to nsp16 in pull-down assay but are unable to efficiently stimulate nsp16\n2\u2032O-MTase activity. We note a residual\n2\u2032O-MTase activity of G70A mutant protein compared with\nK93A.

To address this issue, nsp10 and nsp16 were incubated alone or in\ncombination with mGpppRNA. In these experimental conditions, we could not detect any\nmGpppRNA binding activity when proteins were incubated alone (data not shown). In\ncontrast, when both proteins are present, the complex is able to bind mGpppRNA, and\ncross-linking experiments identify nsp16 as the unique RNA-binding protein, suggesting\nthat nsp10 binding induces a conformational change in nsp16, resulting in mGpppRNA\nbinding activity (data not shown).

Indeed, cap methylation genes\nof many (+)-RNA viruses, such as alphaviruses and flaviviruses, were shown to play a\ncrucial role for efficient virus replication (20,\n24, 42\u201344). In the case of CoVs, a functional and genetic analysis\nperformed on MHV temperature-sensitive mutants mapped to the N7-MTase domain of CoV\nnsp14 and in the 2\u2032O-MTase nsp16 indicated that both are\ninvolved in positive strand RNA synthesis by previously formed replicase-transcriptase\ncomplexes (13). The importance of cap MTase for\nviral RNA synthesis is also supported by data obtained by mutagenesis of MTase catalytic\nresidues in SARS-CoV RNA replicon systems (20,\n24). Therefore, cap MTases constitute a new\nattractive antiviral target. Accordingly, the development of small molecules\nspecifically inhibiting protein-protein interaction and the\n2\u2032O-MTase activity of nsp16 could be envisaged. Furthermore,\nbecause this surface of interaction is conserved among CoVs, molecules or peptides\ninhibiting SARS-CoV nsp10-nsp16 interaction might be developed and extended to the\ninhibition of the nsp10-nsp16 interaction in other viruses when this interface of\ninteraction is conserved (30).",
