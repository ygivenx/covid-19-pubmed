VP6F and VP6R primers and cycling conditions have been described (16). For VP6-positive samples, attempts were made to amplify different rotavirus gene segments (complete or partial) by using published rotavirus-specific consensus primers for VP4 and VP7 (17\u201319) and VP1, VP2, VP6, NSP1, NSP2, NSP3, NSP4, and NSP5 (5). New internal oligonucleotide primers for VP1, VP2, VP7, NSP2, NSP3, NSP5, and VP6 genes were designed on the basis of initial bat sequences obtained and sequences of published mammalian and avian rotavirus strains and used for sequencing (Table). RT-PCR products were analyzed by performing electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels containing GelRed Gel Stain (Biotium, Inc., Hayward, CA, USA) and viewed by using UV transillumination.",

The NSP4 gene of this bat rotavirus is also likely to have been introduced into the bat rotavirus genome by reassortment with human or animal strains. The possibility that the VP4 and NSP4 gene segments were originally bat rotavirus genes, which have evolved and become ubiquitous among human rotaviruses for several years, cannot be excluded.

Fruit bats often live near human habitats (11) as a result of deforestation and expanded settlement of human populations. Fruit bats must forage for food over wide areas and often feed in orchards. A proposed mechanism for bat infection with human rotaviruses would be through use of night soil (human feces) as fertilizer on farmlands and orchards, a common practice throughout Africa and Asia (32,33). Night soil contains pathogenic bacteria, viruses, and parasites linked with disease endemicity in these countries (32\u201334). Human rotaviruses have been detected in surface water, reservoirs, and sewage; and viable virus has been isolated from drinking water (35,36). E. helvum bats have has been observed skimming bodies of water in Africa, presumably to collect water for drinking (37), and surface water could be contaminated with viable human rotaviruses by night soil fertilizer or inadequate sanitation practices. Contact with human feces during drinking or feeding provides a mechanism by which fruit bats can ingest human rotaviruses, which would serve as the source of heterologous rotavirus genes acquired by reassortment. Additional information is needed about the actual mechanisms and frequency of rotavirus transmission between humans and bats.",

Group A and C rotaviruses can replicate each other\u2019s plus-strand RNAs, and it has been speculated that rotaviruses from these 2 groups can exchange genomic segments if they co-infect the same cell (27), although this phenomenon has not been demonstrated empirically.

Global surveillance for rotaviruses in bats and other wildlife is needed to corroborate, elaborate, and more fully understand the origin, adaptation, and evolution of bat rotavirus strains.
