Since PEDV was detected, the virus has continued to spread throughout the United States and has now been reported in Mexico and Canada (2). PEDV was first reported in Europe in the 1970s and was later reported in Asia during the 1980s (3,4). PEDV outbreaks in Asia were more acute and severe than the PEDV outbreaks in Europe (4). In 2010, an increase, up to 100%, in illness and deaths in piglets was reported in China associated with PEDV infection (4\u20136). The original North American PEDV strains identified in 2013 caused severe illness and deaths in piglets and had a 99.5% nucleotide identity with Chinese strain AH2012 (1,7,8).",

In January 2014, intestines from a deceased neonatal piglet, which had severe diarrhea, were positive for PEDV by real-time reverse transcription PCR, and PEDV was sequenced per request of the veterinarian. The sample was processed for next generation sequencing and analyzed by mapping to reference strain USA/Colorado/2013 (7). During the assembly of PEDV strain USA/Minnesota188/2014 (GenBank accession no. KM077139), a region of the spike only had 5\u00d7 coverage and ambiguity bases in the consensus contig whereas the coverage across the remaining PEDV genome was 50\u00d7. The consensus contig was separated at this region, and the 2 separate contigs were created. After remapping, the 2 contigs were aligned back into a new consensus contig, and the new consensus contig was remapped to verify the accuracy of the contig, which had 50\u00d7 coverage.",

The clinical presentation of diarrhea in this case was reported as equally or more severe than such presentation in cases caused by the prototype PEDV Colorado/2013.

A consistent model to properly evaluate these differences is required to control PEDV infection. The most compelling need is to understand how exposure by sows to different PEDV strains correlates with protection of piglets from clinical disease.
