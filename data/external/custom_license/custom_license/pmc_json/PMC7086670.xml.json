PRRSV can cause reproductive failure in sows and is associated with a respiratory disease complex that can affect pigs of all ages [2\u20134]. PRRSV was discovered almost simultaneously in the late 1980s on the European and North American continents and was divided into type 1 PRRSV (European genotype) and type 2 PRRSV (North American genotype) [5, 6]. PRRSV is an enveloped, single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus. Its genome is approximately 15.4 kb in size and has at least 10 open reading frames (ORFs) [7]. ORF1a and ORF1b encode non-structural proteins, and the other genes encode structural proteins, including GP2a, GP2b, GP3, GP4, GP5, GP5a, matrix protein M and the nucleocapsid protein N [8\u201313]. Of these, four are glycoproteins: the minor proteins GP2a, GP3 and GP4 and the major protein GP5, which is thought to be important for virus assembly and entry into permissive cells.",

Although many commercially available modified live and inactivated PRRSV vaccines have been developed, they fail to provide complete protection against the devastating disease caused by this virus [6, 14\u201316]. Furthermore, a large amount of literature has reported natural compounds that exhibit activity against PRRSV infection, including flavaspidic acid AB [17], matrine [18], 12-deoxyphorbol 13-phenylacetate 20-acetate (dPPA), ouabain, valinomycin and bufalin [19], and glycyrrhizin [20]. Additionally, other therapies designed to control PRRSV infection have been reported, such as LiCl [21], polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid [22], type I and type III interferons [23], double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) activated caspase oligomerizer (DRACO) [24], and microRNAs [25]. However, none of these aforementioned therapies can effectively treat or prevent PRRSV infection, so there is an urgent need to develop new antiviral strategies.",

            "text": "Surfactant protein A (SP-A) belongs to a family of mammalian C-type lectins, and it is an important innate immune molecule that is involved in a range of immune responses. The primary structure of SP-A is composed of four regions, including an N-terminal region, a collagen-like region, a coiled-coil neck peptide, and a carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) [26]. The CRD can interact with sugar moieties that are present on the surface of many pathogens, including viruses, fungi and bacteria, resulting in inhibition of infectivity in a calcium-dependent manner. Previous studies on the antiviral activity of SP-A have been focused on human medicine. In the late 1990s, human SP-A was shown to inhibit respiratory syncytial virus by blocking viral entry and subsequent syncytium formation [27]. Research on porcine SP-A activity against PRRSV was limited to one report indicating that recombinant porcine SP-A could exert anti-PRRSV activity [28]. Unfortunately, no additional studies on the anti-PRRSV potential and mechanism of SP-A were performed. However, studies on the antiviral activity of SP-D, which has a primary structure that resembles that of SP-A, have been reported more frequently. SP-D had an inhibitory effect on HIV infection through inhibition of viral entry by affecting gp120\u2013CD4 interactions [29]. Marine and colleagues demonstrated that recombinant porcine SP-D prevented the attachment of human seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 virus to receptors on epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract [?\n36\n?]. Notably, porcine ficolin is also a collagenous lectin that was established to reduce PRRSV infection in Marc-145 cells in neutralization assays and to inhibit the replication of infectious viral particles in a GlcNAc-dependent manner [30].",

After removal of the supernatant, 150 \u00b5L of DMSO was added to each well to dissolve the crystals for 10 min. Absorbance at 490 nm was recorded using an ELISA microplate reader.",

We found that RpSP-A expressed by Sf9 insect cells could block virus entry. Viral entry represents an attractive target for chemotherapeutic intervention [32]. However, drugs that inhibit virus entry prevent infection of cells by cell-free virus particles and also prevent virus transmission between virus-infected and uninfected cells [32, 33]. The capacity to inhibit both modes of infection by a single drug is one of the reasons why SP-A may be superior to other microbicide drugs.

            "text": "Researchers have confirmed that lectins inhibit virus entry [27, 29, 34, 35], and each step of the viral entry pathway is a potential target for antiviral agents. We conducted virus attachment and penetration assays to assess whether RpSP-A also interfered with PRRSV entry. The virus entry assay showed that RpSP-A strongly inhibits virus attachment, but its effect on virus penetration was, at most, modest, suggesting that RpSP-A most probably blocks virus attachment, like other lectins. It has been shown that hippeastrum hybrid agglutinin (HHA), a mannose-specific lectin, probably interferes with SARS coronavirus attachment. When attachment occurred at 4 \u00b0C, HHA was twice as active (EC50 = 2.5 \u00b5g mL\u22121) as it was in a situation where both attachment and penetration were allowed to occur at 37 \u00b0C (EC50 = 5.2 \u00b5g mL\u22121) [34]. In another study, recombinant porcine SP-D was shown to inhibit IAV attachment using human trachea tissue, and it fully prevented binding of human seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 IA at higher dose [35]. Our data indicate that the suppression of PRRSV penetration by RpSP-A gradually weakened and even disappeared as the time between infection and addition of RpSP-A increased, suggesting that RpSP-A might act on PRRSV entry into Marc 145 cells only at the cell surface and that it has no effect once the virus has entered the cell.",

Taking the previously reported data and our own findings together, we hypothesize that RpSP-A inhibits PRRSV entry by binding to glycoprotein GP2, GP3, GP4 or GP5 on the surface of PRRSV, thereby preventing it from interacting with its receptors on Marc 145 cells. The mechanism of the antiviral activity of lectins has been studied by several researchers. It has been shown that human SP-A can bind to the F (fusion) glycoprotein on the surface of respiratory syncytial virus and may neutralize RSV by directly inhibiting the fusion function of this protein, thereby inhibiting viral entry [27]. In another study, Marine et al. reported that the interaction between RpSP-D and the viral HA prevented attachment of the virus to target cells and contributed to the neutralizing effects of RpSP-D [35]. In addition, other lectins such as SP-D and plant lectins have been shown to bind to glycoprotein gp120 of HIV-1 and block access of gp120 to the receptor protein CD4 [29, 32, 33, 36], thereby blocking viral entry to reduce HIV-1 infection. The nature of the interactions among PRRSV, RpSP-A and cells is not yet known, so this model should be assessed in further studies.",
