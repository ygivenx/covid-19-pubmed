This policy has significantly eased the health and economic burden associated with HIV infection, increased HIV screening and linkage to care, and improved overall health of PLWH. More so, this foundational policy focused China\u2019s leadership on an HIV response strategy characterized by critical evaluation of current evidence, pragmatic development of tailored interventions, and iterative assessment and improvement of HIV-related services. For example, the World Health Organization (WHO) has repeatedly revised treatment guidelines for resource-limited settings, and each time, leaders of China\u2019s National Free ART Program have reviewed the evidence and expanded ART coverage to meet WHO-recommendations. Most recently, in 2016, CD4-based ART eligibility requirements were eliminated in China (5), and in the following year, almost 600,000 PLWH in China were accessing ART (6).",

Effective data collection, management, and analysis are necessary for the development of comprehensive response strategies and are essential to timely identification of outbreaks. In 2006, the National Center for AIDS/STD Control and Prevention (NCAIDS) at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) launched its national, web-based HIV/AIDS information system, the Comprehensive Response Information Management System (CRIMS) (7). This system has improved the efficiency of data collection and analysis and is a key tool for the implementation of national HIV/AIDS programs in China and is an important resource for epidemiological study since today it tracks the largest cohort of PLWH in the world.",

In response to the small outbreak among people living with hemophilia who had received contaminated factor VIII from the United States, the Chinese government banned the importation of blood products. This abrupt decline in imported blood supply suddenly created high demand for domestic blood products. However, due to traditional Chinese cultural beliefs, voluntary blood donation was rare (14). As a result, many small, commercial and government-managed plasma collection stations, which paid people to donate blood, were set up primarily in rural areas in China throughout the early 1990s (14, 15). Unfortunately, the leadership of many of these stations placed the pursuit of profits ahead of the protection of patients and unsafe blood product collection practices caused an outbreak of HIV infection among FPD (15).",

In January 2017, an HIV outbreak was reported at a hospital in the southern Chinese city, due to lymphocyte immunotherapy (LIT) performed at the hospital in the prior year (23). The index patient\u2019s exposure was traced to her husband, who reportedly had condomless, receptive anal sex with a man prior to LIT donation (23). Additionally, a failure to follow the official laboratory protocol by the attending technician led to unsafe exposure to HIV. It was identified that, due to a lack of disposable sterile equipment at the hospital, the attending healthcare worker reused LIT tubes, likely leading to a number of LIT patients receiving the contaminated lymphocytes from the infected, index case-patient (23). All LIT services were immediately suspended until new guidelines were issued in late December 2017, restricting the further spread of the outbreak.",

Though male-male sex has been legal in China since 1997, sociocultural factors mean this group often faces stigma and discrimination, causing them to hide their sexual behaviors from partners and medical workers (36). The importance of family in Chinese culture also places substantial pressure on MSM to conceal their MSM identity (37). Subsequently, HIV prevention and testing rates in MSM have reportedly remained low, most likely due to fears of disclosing personal information or being discriminated against (37). Additionally, recreational drug and alcohol use in MSM in China has also been associated with unsafe sexual behaviors, particularly unprotected anal and receptive sex and multiple sexual partners (38).",

Additionally, China is providing innovative strategies to HIV testing for MSM in cooperation with community based organizations (CBOs), including assessing the feasibility and acceptability of HIV self-testing, including testing kits in vending machines on college campuses, and using social networking applications to provide HIV counseling and testing (38). Specifically, in combination with public health agencies and CBOs, innovative efforts to improve care through the use of the Internet and Wechat have been adopted (38). Additional scale up of condom promotion activities and outreach services using new and innovative techniques such as social networking applications are a few of the key strategies being implemented to reduce HIV among MSM (38, 39). Despite these efforts however, the prevalence continues to rise. New interventions, such as the rollout of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in this group are currently be considered.",

The initial phase of the HIV epidemic was primarily concentrated in rural areas in Southwestern and Western China as seen in Fig. 1a, then spreading into cities and urban areas across all provinces (9, 39). According to sentinel surveillance data, in 1998, more than 1000 cases were identified in Yunnan and Xinjiang Province, while the remaining provinces reported far fewer cases. As previously discussed, these new infections did not remain contained in just southwestern China. On the contrary, due to the increase in drug use and unsafe sexual behaviors, the epidemic began to spread and by the next decade, was present in all provinces throughout the country. The largest number of PLWH continued to be located in Southern and Southwestern China, though a growing number of cases were identified in Central China, as seen in Fig. 1b. Yunnan was still home to the largest epidemic at the time, with more 100,000 PLWH, followed by Xinjiang, Sichuan, Guangxi, Guangdong, and Henan, which reported more than 50,000 cases in 2008. The eastern coast of China also began to experience a growing number of new cases, with many provinces in the region reporting more than 10,000 cases (Fig. 1b). This trend has continued to today, where in 2018, Southwestern China still reports the largest number of HIV cases. Yunnan and Sichuan had more than 100,000 PLWH in 2018, followed by Guanxi, Guangdong, and Henan with more than 50,000 cases in the same year (Fig. 1c). The epidemic has continued to grow in Eastern and Northern China, while regions such as Inner Mongolia, Qinhai, Hainan, and Tibet report the fewest number of PLWH, with less than 5000 in 2018.",

The HIV epidemic has transitioned from injection drug using (as seen in the initial epidemic in South and Southwestern China) into heterosexual transmission. From 1989 to 1995, majority of HIV infections were due to injecting drug use (49). Now, however, over 70% of newly diagnosed HIV cases are due to heterosexual contact (21). Currently, male-male sexual contact is the major mode of HIV transmission in China, particularly in larger, urban cities, such as in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, as well as other parts of Northern China, as seen in Fig. 1c.",

Even with the free provision of ART to all infected patients in China, the number of deaths reported among PLWH and the proportion of overall mortality due to HIV/AIDS has steadily increased. In 2003, the total number of deaths caused by all infectious diseases combined was 6474, while 379 of which were due to AIDS, being the fifth leading cause of death among all notifiable diseases that year (51). In 2008, the number of AIDS-related deaths increased to 5389 and became the leading cause of death among all infectious diseases for the first time (52). In 2018, the number of AIDS-related deaths increased to 18,780 which was 4.3 times all other infectious disease related deaths combined (53). Previous research in China has shown multiple factors contributing to this rise in HIV/AIDS related mortality. In particular, late diagnosis, education level, socioeconomic status, and older age were also associated with AIDS-related mortality (54). Thus, earlier diagnosis and immediate ART initiation are strategies that could be strengthened to reduce this burden of HIV-related deaths.",

China has implemented countless laws, policies, and guidelines to support the HIV/AIDS response, committing both political and economic will to the fight against HIV/AIDS. Based on the available epidemiological data, the HIV/AIDS response has been drastically scaled up across the country, increasing access to services and ultimately reducing the prevalence of the disease. What initially began as an epidemic among injection drug users has now shifted to heterosexual transmission in the general population. After the implementation of harm reduction strategies in 2004, the HIV epidemic in PWID has steadily declined, while HIV transmission via sexual contact continues to increase steadily and slowly, now accounting for 95% of newly reported cases. Though the prevalence of HIV infection has remained low in female sex workers and male STD clinic attendees, the number of HIV cases caused by heterosexual transmission continues to increase. This, coupled with the rising number of deaths, remains challenges for controlling the HIV epidemic in China. Improving access to HIV testing and linking patients to care prior to their progression to AIDS should be a key focus of future strategies and evidence-based policies.",
