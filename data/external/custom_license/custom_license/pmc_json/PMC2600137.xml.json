To develop an accurate and comprehensive baseline of diversity (parasite species and their host and geographic associations), we conducted opportunistic and targeted field surveys (Figure 2). Physical vouchers (representative specimens that are definitively identified and held in permanent museum repositories), frozen tissues, and associated data formed the basis for archival collections (9,11,18). Archival collections link surveys, informatics, phylogenies, history, biogeography, and ecology to form long-term baselines for exploring biodiversity and the evolutionary and ecologic determinants of infectious disease emergence (3,9,18). Such baselines allow tracking of changes in pathogen diversity and genetics, as well as differentiation between new detection versus true emergence of diseases.",

Further complications arose from the absence of properly preserved and documented parasite specimens and the specialized knowledge needed to identify such specimens to the species level. To identify parasite species in wildlife across extensive geographic ranges in remote northern locations, we developed molecular probes for the identification of larval parasites in feces. We used these techniques to redefine the distribution of a parasite (Parelaphostrongylus odocoilei) in multiple host species across northwestern North America (15) and to detect at least 1 new protostrongylid species in moose, muskoxen, and caribou in northern North America (20; Figure 2); these fell within the category of emergence of new recognition of a pathogen. In addition, by using a combination of morphologic and molecular methods of identification, we detected a host switch of a lungworm (Protostrongylus stilesi) from Dall sheep to sympatric muskoxen (21) (category of emergence: host switching).",

In addition, our extensive survey across northern North America reinforces the hypothesis that Old World protostrongylids (i.e., species of Elaphostrongylus, Neostrongylus, and Cystocaulus) do not naturally occur in North America and have not yet been introduced (20), with the exception of Elaphostrongylus rangiferi, which has been translocated and established on the island of Newfoundland in eastern Canada (19) (category of emergence: new introduction of pathogen).",

Increasingly cold climate during the Pliocene and Pleistocene periods may have further influenced selection of an Arctic-adapted fauna with its own unique developmental constraints and environmental tolerances (10,22). Historical climate dynamics can serve as an analog for the effects of accelerated change currently experienced in the North (9,18,22), including the emergence of pathogens and disease. Based on our understanding of the past determinants for northern host\u2013parasite systems, we predict increased host switching and range expansion as climate change removes ecologic barriers and developmental constraints for pathogen transmission and redraws the maps of host distributions and timing of seasonal movements by hosts (10,23).",

Our interpretations of current host and geographic distributions of northern parasites have been guided by a strong foundation in historical processes, both recent and deep (10 thousand years before present [KYBP] to 5 million years before present [MYBP]) (9,18,22). For example, the current focal distribution of the Arctic-adapted lungworm U. pallikuukensis in a circumscribed population of muskoxen (Figure 2) is attributed to recent host extirpation and reduction to a remnant population in the early 1900s, primarily as a result of hunting (12,14). In contrast, deeper historical processes (600\u2013300 KYBP) account for widespread distribution of the lungworm P. stilesi in wild sheep, which entered North America across Beringia, the land mass that historically joined North America and Siberia (10,24). The muscleworm P. odocoilei has a more heterogeneous distribution in wild sheep because these hosts were colonized relatively recently (late Pleistocene) in a host-switching event from deer (Odocoileus hemionus), probably when the 2 species were concentrated in glacial refugia, and later expanded northwards following deglaciation (categories of emergence: host switching and geographic expansion) (15,24; I. Asmundsson, E.P. Hoberg, E.J. Jenkins, unpub. data).",

This is especially true in the North, where the sheer size and diversity of the geographic areas, low densities and isolation of human communities, and remote study areas hamper year-round observation of illness and death in wildlife. Therefore, we recruited local community members and hunters to create a network of \u201cwildlife health monitors,\u201d who are trained to collect standardized samples and data to develop baselines for wildlife health over time (http://wildlife1.usask.ca/sahtu/monitors.php). Even if a decline in a wildlife population is detected and documented, the role of disease can be difficult to tease from an array of complex ecologic relationships. Therefore, to isolate the effects of single pathogens and evaluate subclinical disease, we experimentally infected captive wildlife and monitored them by using a variety of veterinary clinical techniques (24,26).",

In muskoxen, infections of U. pallikuukensis are cumulative with age, and adult parasites are associated with large, space-occupying lesions in the lungs. Infected animals exhibit epistaxis and may be more susceptible to predation (12,14). In wild sheep, P. odocoilei causes diffuse, pulmonary granulomas that can lead to respiratory failure in heavily infected or otherwise compromised animals. Experimentally infected sheep exhibited marked weight loss and transient neurologic signs, which, together with decreased respiratory function, would compromise their ability to escape predation at high altitudes and over rough terrain (24,26). Also, respiratory pathology may result from synergy of P. odocoilei with the lungworm P. stilesi because both parasites are present in almost all wild sheep in some regions (24,26). Infections of Parelaphostrongylus andersoni, possibly in combination with the new protostrongylid species, have been linked to verminous pneumonia in barren-ground caribou in Alaska and Canada.",

For step 2, field and laboratory experiments showed specific tolerances and thresholds and a direct relationship between temperature and development of U. pallikuukensis and P. odocoilei in intermediate hosts (7,12). For step 3, historical temperature data demonstrated that the core region for our studies (the Mackenzie District of the Northwest Territories) had the highest rate of warming in Canada (60-year warming trend of 2.2\u00b0C in annual temperature; www.msc-smc.ec.gc.ca/ccrm/bulletin/annual06/regional_e.cfm), and that warming available for parasite development had already increased at multiple sites in the Canadian Arctic (4,6,7). For step 4, a model for temperature and rates of larval development in gastropod intermediate hosts was validated for these protostrongylids and applied to climate warming scenarios (6,7). Based on these projections, we determined that climate warming led to substantial amplification of parasite populations in disease-endemic areas through reduction in generation times and broadened seasonal windows for transmission, contributing to heightened intensity of infection among individual hosts (4,6,7). Climate change also may result in release of some \u201cgeneralist\u201d parasites (e.g., P. odocoilei) from environmental constraints, which, in combination with a breakdown in mechanisms for ecologic isolation, could facilitate range expansion and colonization of na\u00efve hosts (2 categories of emerging infectious disease) (7).",

Following the warmest recorded annual temperature for this region in 1998 (www.msc-smc.ec.gc.ca/ccrm/bulletin/annual06/rsummarytable_e.html?table=temperature&season=annual&date=2006&nyears=59), fatal pneumonia associated with P. odocoilei was first detected in wild sheep in the Mackenzie Mountains in 1999, although this may reflect increased vigilance rather than true emergence. Emergence of disease may follow climate change, but for macroparasites in particular, there are likely to be lag times determined by a period of development in the host population (30). Cascading and cumulative long-term effects of climate change, including shifts in host\u2013pathogen relationships, may be among the factors contributing to large-scale changes in abundance and distribution observed in keystone wildlife (e.g., boreal woodland and barren-ground caribou) in northern North America.",

Examples of regulation of wildlife populations by macroparasites are increasing, often in combination with malnutrition or predation (27,34). Despite this, microparasites (generally prions, viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoans) often remain the singular focus of research on emerging infectious diseases (35,36). Greater effort needs to be dedicated to the effects of macroparasites on population health and demographics to ensure detection and proactive management of emerging diseases caused by these organisms. Our next challenge will be to understand the effects of interactions of multiple pathogens (both micro- and macroparasites), nutrition, stress, and other environmental factors on health of both individuals and populations.",

Climate change will affect northern ecosystems by altering host range (i.e., expansions, shifts, increased or decreased overlap), abundance, and resilience, in addition to availability of environmental contaminants, free-living stages of pathogens, and intermediate hosts/vectors (Table 2). Climate change may also interact with other drivers for infectious disease emergence in northern North America. These include 1) development of new ecotones related to expansion of southern animal species, such as deer, red fox, and domestic livestock; 2) altered routes and timing of migration for wild birds and caribou herds; 3) habitat alteration and fragmentation due to resource extraction and development; and 4) historical and ongoing translocation of hosts and pathogens (e.g., historical introductions of reindeer and muskoxen, natural expansion of existing wood bison populations, proposed reestablishment of wood bison in Alaska, and increasing interest in livestock production in the North). The cumulative implications for health of wildlife that are culturally and economically important for northern communities are unlikely to be positive (37). In addition, environmental change is predicted to drive increased dissemination of zoonotic pathogens in water- and foodborne pathways (e.g., Giardia, Cryptosporidium, Toxoplasma, Trichinella, and Echinococcus spp.), posing a direct threat to human health in communities that rely on local water sources and country foods; environmental change may also lead to emergence of disease resulting from \u201cspillover\u201d of pathogens between persons and wildlife (8,16,37\u201339).",

L1 move up the airways, are swallowed, and pass in the feces, where they must invade the foot of gastropod intermediate hosts for further development to the infective third-stage larvae (L3). Development to L3 requires a minimum amount of heating and does not occur below a critical threshold; these development parameters vary among different protostrongylid species (6,7,13).
