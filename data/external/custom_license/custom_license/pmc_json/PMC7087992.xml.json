These infections of wildlife, domestic animals, and humans seem to be increasing and more problematic every year. The cause of the recent increase in scientific and public interest in emerging infections is probably twofold. On the one hand, technological advances in detection methods and in global communications allow us to be increasingly aware of emergence events as they occur (Garnett and Holmes, 1996). Many pathogens, including West Nile virus, monkeypox virus, and H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus have attracted widespread media attention. Online news sources provide gripping, up-to-the-minute accounts of outbreaks occurring in locations that their primary audience may not even be able to identify on a map, such as the multimedia presentations produced by BBC News in 2005 of a Marburg virus outbreak in Angola (Phillips, 2005).",

            "text": "On the other hand, anthropogenic activities have increased the actual frequency of pathogen emergence. Habitat modification brings previously separated populations into contact and disrupts natural mechanisms regulating population dynamics. For example, increases in rodent populations due to clear-cutting of forested areas for the planting of food crops (particularly corn) is thought to have been responsible for outbreaks of several hemorrhagic fever viruses in South America, including Jun\u00edn and Machupo viruses (Buchmeier et al., 2001). Barriers limiting pathogen transmission are altered as we change the landscape and increase global transportation, providing unprecedented opportunities for transmission to new populations and species (Schrag and Weiner, 1995; Smith et al., 2007). These changes have implications not only for human health but for wildlife conservation and domestic animal health. Long-distance animal transport, both intentional (for agriculture or the pet trade) and unintentional, facilitates pathogen introduction (Daszak et al., 2001). For example, illegal bird transport is the suspected source of the recent introduction of H5N1 HPAI into a poultry farm in the UK (ProMED-mail, 2007a,b,c), and accidental transportation of mosquitoes aboard aircraft is thought to pose the highest risk for the introduction of West Nile virus into Hawaii and the Galapagos Islands (Kilpatrick et al., 2004, 2006).",

            "text": "Considering the broad public and scientific interest in infectious disease emergence, surprisingly little work has been done to quantitatively describe broad-scale patterns of emergence in light of pathogen characteristics. Much work on emerging infections has focused on specific emergence events, trying to determine when, where, and how a particular pathogen entered a new host population. The emergence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), for example, has been well-studied on both ecological and molecular levels. Strong evidence suggests that the bush-meat trade in West Africa has facilitated repeated retrovirus transmission events from wild primates into humans (Wolfe et al., 2004), and independent introductions of HIV-1 subgroups (M, N, O) from chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and HIV-2 subtypes (A, B) from sooty mangabeys (Cercocebus atys) are believed to be responsible for the ongoing HIV/AIDS pandemic (Sharp et al., 2001). In order to predict (rather than reconstruct) pathogen emergence, however, it is necessary to extend the domain of inquiry beyond the focus on a single disease. Specific ecological processes and pathogen characteristics must affect the probability of emergence, and until these factors are recognized we will have little predictive power.",

            "text": "Burke has suggested that the high \u201cevolvability\u201d of RNA viruses facilitates host jumps (Burke, 1998). Such evolvability is derived from a combination of high replication error rates and the ability to reassort and recombine. Although he makes no attempt to quantitatively determine the relative frequency of emergence for different types of pathogens, Burke claims that recent pandemics in humans and wildlife have mostly been caused by RNA viruses, citing multiple examples (influenza A, HIV-1, enteroviruses 70 and 71, human T-cell lymphoma virus, three paramyxoviruses, porcine respiratory coronavirus, and a calicivirus that causes hemorrhagic disease in rabbits). He goes on to predict that future global pandemics will be caused by groups of viruses that have caused major epidemics in humans or animals and that have high intrinsic evolvability; however, this approach does not allow for identification of viral groups with high emergence potential that have not produced large epidemics to date. In particular, if undiscovered virus families exist that have a high potential for emergence\u2014whether in humans or in animals\u2014a priori identification of this potential may facilitate preparedness for and rapid response to emergence events.",

            "text": "A more quantitative approach was taken by three studies published in a special issue of Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London in 2001. The first two of these studies (Cleaveland et al., 2001; Taylor et al., 2001) used a broad-scale literature search to construct a database of known infectious diseases of humans and domestic animals and to classify these diseases as emerging or not. The authors were then able to describe general patterns related to emergence status. They found that viruses are significantly more likely to be classified as emerging than are bacteria, fungi, helminths, or protozoa and that the ability to infect multiple host species is a significant risk factor for emergence in humans and domestic livestock. A recent update of the work on human pathogens has confirmed these findings with a larger dataset (Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria, 2005). A similar approach was taken by Dobson and Foufopoulos (2001), who surveyed emerging infectious diseases of wildlife based on ProMED reports over a 2-year period. Emerging pathogens of wildlife were also found to be primarily viral.",

To develop a predictive framework, however, we must distinguish between the different phenomena that the term \u201cemergence\u201d commonly encompasses. These include the appearance of a pathogen in a new host species (Woolhouse, 2002; Antia et al., 2003; Fenton and Pedersen, 2005; Woolhouse et al., 2005), the appearance of a pathogen in a new population of an established host species (or new geographic region) (Lederberg et al., 1992; Cleaveland et al., 2001; Taylor et al., 2001; Smolinski et al., 2003; Smith et al., 2007), the appearance of an antimicrobial-resistant variant of a pathogen within an established host population (Lederberg et al., 1992; Smolinski et al., 2003), and a change in the immunological interaction between a pathogen and an established host population (Smolinski et al., 2003).

This approach allows for the generation of testable hypotheses regarding the emergence potential of specific viral groups. I outline these hypotheses and then determine whether expectations based on the molecular characteristics discussed correspond to observed broad-scale patterns. Agreement with observed patterns may suggest that the molecular characteristics explored will yield substantial predictive power and a useful framework for ranking virus groups in terms of emergence potential. Inconsistencies between the patterns expected based on molecular characteristics alone and observed patterns highlight specific parts of the emergence process as highly dependent on host\u2013host or host\u2013virus interactions and less dependent on molecular characteristics of the viruses themselves.

Molecular considerations will be most important when there is no direct contact or shared vector between current and potential hosts. In such cases, the frequency with which a potential new host encounters infectious virus particles will depend on virion stability in the environment. Two main properties of the virion are likely to influence the rate of inactivation: whether the virus particle requires an envelope for entry into the host cell and the arrangement of structural proteins within the virion. Though the relative rates of inactivation of different virus species depend on specific environmental conditions (such as temperature and relative humidity), requiring an envelope for successful cellular infection may generally decrease the ability of a virus to survive outside a host, since the phospholipid membrane will be sensitive to desiccation, ultraviolet radiation, changes in pH, and ozone toxicity (Cox, 1989). Thus, the ability to enter host cells without an envelope is expected to increase emergence potential. Similarly, isometric and complex structural arrangements contain many contacts between proteins relative to their helical counterparts. These arrangements are therefore more stable against physical damage, reducing the rate of inactivation and increasing expected frequency of encounter.",

One exception is monkeypox virus (Poxviridae), which replicates in the cytoplasm but has high replication fidelity and, according to the simple genome-packaging division used here, little recombination/reassortment potential. It is worth noting that recombination of Poxviridae species has been demonstrated in laboratory experiments (see, for example, Yao and Evans, 2001). Thus, rather than implying that recombination/reassortment potential is not an important contributor to infection of novel host species, this exception may indicate that the simple molecular traits considered here are insufficient to capture the full range of recombination mechanisms available to host-jumping viruses. Of the mammal viruses lacking all three traits associated with infection of a novel host (genome reassortment or recombination, error-prone replication, and ability to replicate in the cytoplasm), none is known to infect humans, regardless of close association between humans and the animal host.

Consistent patterns of shedding in the source host across host pairs with a particular type of ecological relationship will indicate that viruses shed through particular sites of excretion are more likely to be encountered than others. As ecological relationships between species change, knowledge of these patterns will provide an indication of the risk of encounter with viral species harbored by a newly contacted host species. In the pet trade, for example, where species that are isolated in nature live in artificial, commensal-like conditions, sometimes at high densities, the expectations laid out in Figure 1 suggest that viruses shed via respiratory secretions, urine, feces, or skin lesions\u2014or those shed in the saliva if animals are kept in close enough quarters for biting to occur\u2014are likely to be transmitted between species. This type of change in ecological relationships was responsible for the emergence of monkeypox virus in the US in 2003, as African rodents were brought into contact with prairie dogs, which then transmitted the virus to humans (Guarner et al., 2004). Practical application of this type of analysis is likely to be case-specific: the approach may be useful when evaluating threats in a specific situation, such as when interested in risks to a particular endangered wildlife species (specific recipient host) or when interested in risks associated with introduction of a particular species of animal into the wildlife pet trade or wild animal markets (specific source host).",

Humans living and working near infected pigs can also become infected; however, very few virions are able to replicate in human lung tissue. Instead, virions replicate in cerebral tissue, producing an encephalitis (Hooper et al., 2001). Replication in the brain does not promote propagation, and transmission between humans does not occur. A variant of Nipah virus found in Bangladesh, on the other hand, replicates in human lung tissue, causes respiratory disease, and can propagate within the human population (Hsu et al., 2004). Even differences in tissue tropism within a given organ system may affect propagation potential. One hypothesis as to why H5N1 HPAI has so far failed to produce large chains of human-to-human transmission is that its viral attachment is concentrated in the lower respiratory tract, whereas access to the upper respiratory tract is insufficient to produce large amounts of aerosolized virus (van Riel et al., 2006).",

Large-scale characterization of receptors used for cellular entry and of the distribution of these receptors within humans, domestic animals, and wildlife could provide an invaluable tool in predicting specific interactions between viruses and potential hosts. While this task may seem daunting, host-jumping viruses often gain cellular entry via membrane proteins conserved between source and recipient host groups (Woolhouse, 2002).

Most virus groups that encode their own polymerase have no proofreading and therefore low replication fidelity; however, polymerases encoded by members of the Poxviridae, Adenoviridae, and Herpesviridae are known to have 3\u2019 to 5\u2019 exonuclease activity (King et al., 1997; Huang et al., 1999; Willer et al., 2001), which is the primary type of error correction expected to affect viral replication fidelity. Viruses in these groups are therefore expected to have high replication fidelity. Low replication fidelity is expected to promote the generation of genetic diversity and therefore increase potential for infection and propagation. \ncThe site of replication is considered to be the cytoplasm if all steps in the replication cycle take place within the cytoplasm of the infected cell; the site of replication is denoted as the nucleus if any step in the replication cycle (e.g., genome replication or transcription into mRNA) requires nuclear entry. The ability to complete replication within the cytoplasm is expected to increase relative infection potential, as nuclear entry provides an additional barrier to replication. \ndThe presence (+) or absence (\u2013) of a lipid envelope will affect the stability of a virion in the environment. \neThe arrangement of structural proteins within the virion is denoted as isometric, helical, or complex. Isometric and complex arrangements are more structurally stable than helical ones due to the larger number of protein contacts. \nfVirions of some genera of the Poxviridae are enveloped upon exiting the cell; however, an intact envelope is not required for the virus particle to remain infectious (Tidona and Darai, 2001). \ngThe lone member of the family Asfarviridae, African Swine Fever virus, encodes a viral polymerase responsible for genome replication (Fauquet et al., 2005). No studies were found in Web of Science searches that examined whether the viral polymerase has 3\u2019 to 5\u2019 exonuclease activity; however, the other families of large DNA viruses do encode polymerases with known proofreading activity (King et al., 1997; Huang et al., 1999; Willer et al., 2001) and it is assumed here that the polymerase encoded by African Swine Fever virus has undocumented exonuclease activity.",

Characteristics that increase encounter will be those that increase the stability of a virion in the environment: being infectious without a lipid envelope and having an isometric or complex virion. \ncThe infection score denotes the number of characteristics a group has that are expected to increase the ability to infect a novel host species: high recombination/reassortment potential, low replication fidelity, and an ability to complete replication within the cytoplasm. \ndThe propagation score denotes the number of characteristics a group has that are expected to increase propagation: high recombination/reassortment potential and low replication fidelity.",
