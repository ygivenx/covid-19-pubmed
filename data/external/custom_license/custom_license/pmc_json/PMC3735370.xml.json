One common criticism of neural networks is that,\nunlike some other machine-learning techniques, they are essentially\n\u201cblack boxes\u201d; it is difficult to impossible to determine\nprecisely how they come to their ultimate conclusions. Though speculative,\nwe suspect two factors explain the favorable performance of Vina\u2013NN1.\nFirst, the additional features of molecular binding that NN2 explicitly\nconsiders may not provide additional information over what NN1 can\ninfer implicitly. For example, in estimating binding affinity, NN2\nexplicitly considers the number \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking interactions;\nhowever, NN1 might be able to implicitly infer \u03c0\u2013\u03c0\nstacking by considering the number of receptor and ligand aromatic\ncarbon atoms that are in close proximity. Second, NN1 and NN2 assess\nligand potency very differently. NN1 is trained to return a binary\nresponse: good binder or poor binder. In contrast, NN2 is trained\nto return a range of scores roughly equivalent to pKi or pIC50 values. It may be that binary classification\nis more effective than continuous classification in this case.

A t-test on the slope coefficient yielded a p-value of 0.0, leading us to reject the null hypothesis that there\nis no true relationship between pKi and\nmolecular weight (i.e., that the true slope coefficient is 0). Similarly,\nthe regression equation describing the relationship between polarizability\nand pKi was pol = 4.3326 (pKi) + 7.3163, with a R2 value\nof 0.30. A t-test on the slope coefficient of this\nregression similarly produced a p-value of 0.0; the\nhypothesis that polarizability and pKi are not correlated was thus similarly rejected.",
