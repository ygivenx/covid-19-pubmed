After that outstanding meeting, the organizers endeavored to continue in its tradition to organize the 2nd PRICPS in Cairns, Australia, in 2008 in conjunction with the Asia Oceania Human Proteome Organization (AOHUPO) Congress. At that meeting, the Asia Pacific Protein Association was formed, with the main purpose of organizing protein structure and function in the Asia Pacific region, in order to promote the development of protein science and collaboration. Subsequently, the 3rd APPA Conference was held in Shanghai, China, in 2011, and the 4th APPA Conference in Jeju, Korea, in 2014, followed by this, the 5th in this series.",

In the second plenary, M.R. Jisnuson Svasti described the development of protein science in Thailand using illustrations from his own career. This was followed by the EMBO Keynote Lecture by Madan Babu, in which he described the importance of intrinsically disordered proteins and protein regions at a proteome- and genome-wide level. In his plenary, So Iwata described the use of the free electron laser to gain temporal insight into light-initiated reactions in bacterial rhodopsin and the photosystem II oxygen-evolving complex, while Ruiming Xu considered the structural basis of epigenetics, particularly histone acetylation and deacetylation. In the penultimate plenary, Akhilesh Pandey explored the identification and validation of protein\u2013protein interactions in cells as the current frontier in proteomics. Carol B. Post presented the final plenary, \u201cThe Protein Society Keynote Lecture,\u201d in which she described an unusual mechanism for regulation of protein\u2013protein interactions by phosphorylation in Syk tyrosine kinase.",

These sessions focused on diverse areas of protein research, from advances in proteomics, systems biology and bioinformatics to structural investigations of protein\u2013nucleic acid interactions and molecular processes, enzyme catalysis, dynamics of protein\u2013protein interactions and signaling, as well as protein engineering to achieve new protein activities. Outstanding scientists from around the Asia Pacific region, together with Prof. Joan Steitz from the USA, were featured as invited speakers (Table 1). An 18th session honoring the 70th birthday of Prof. M.R. Jisnuson Svasti featured outstanding Thai protein scientists who have worked with Prof. Svasti during the development of their careers. Furthermore, a Systems Biology and Computational Biology Workshop, in which senior and local scientists shared their experiences and discussed their research and related issues, was included in the afternoon parallel sessions of 12th July, while the Synchrotron Light Research Institute (SLRI) sponsored a workshop on Synchrotron Protein Research in the afternoon of 13th July to introduce researchers to the facilities available at the SLRI in Thailand, as well as in the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC), Taiwan, China, and the SPring-8 facilities in Japan.\n",

Luncheon lectures from Bio-Rad, GE and Merck introduced participants to ways of collaborating with the companies, along with some of the latest technologies available from these companies, while other companies presented their products in the exhibition. Several young scientists also took advantage of the Young Scientist Program held just ahead of the conference (9th to 11th July) to learn from senior protein researchers and present their own research in short talks.",
