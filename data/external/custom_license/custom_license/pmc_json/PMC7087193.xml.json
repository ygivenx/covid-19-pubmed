            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a member of the family Coronaviridae and is closely related to human coronavirus 229E, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) [3, 30]. This virus causes porcine epidemic diarrhea, an enteric disease characterized by acute watery diarrhea and dehydration [8]. The clinical and pathological symptoms of PEDV infection are similar to transmissible gastroenteritis, making it difficult to differentiate between the two [21]. Although PEDV has become enzootic in several countries [4], seasonal outbreaks, resulting in death of neonatal piglets as well as weight loss in fattening pigs, continue to cause serious economic losses in the swine industry [5]. Prophylactic vaccines capable of preventing the initial stages of viral infection usually induce neutralizing antibodies against the viral pathogen [20]. Due to the economic importance of PEDV, cell-adapted strains of the virus have been developed as live attenuated vaccines [16]. Other vaccine candidates have focused on the CO-26K equivalent (COE) domain located on the spike protein, which is reported to contain a neutralizing epitope against PEDV [12].",

The HE protein of these coronaviruses has a structural and functional relationship to the hemagglutinin protein of influenza C virus and may have been derived by recombination between the HE mRNA of influenza C virus and the genomic RNA of an ancestral coronavirus [17]. For others, like IBV, TGEV and BCoV, the spike (S) protein has been observed to possess sialic-acid-binding activity [15, 23].

Samples of the culture supernatant were taken at 0, 8, 16, 20, and 24 h post-inoculation (hpi) and titrated by focus formation assay as described previously [7]. At the same time, the same samples were treated with 10 \u03bcg/ml trypsin and subjected to the HA test. Figure 2 shows the comparative levels of HA units/focus-forming units of KPEDV-9. Within a 24-h period, the KPEDV-9 titer in the culture supernatant increased from 8 \u00d7 102 ffu per ml at 8 hpi to 1 \u00d7 105 ffu per ml at 24 hpi. Similarly, the HA titer of KPEDV-9 was measured at 2 HA units at 8 hpi and 32 HA units at 24 hpi. There is a positive correlation between the HA titer and infectious titer by ffa in KPEDV-9. However, the ratio of HA unit/ffu was not consistent among the samples tested, suggesting that the HA titer of PEDV cannot be precisely translated into infectious units.

            "text": "Based on the full genome sequence of PEDV strain CV777 (GenBank accession no. AF353511.1), this virus lacks the HE protein responsible for the HA activity of other coronaviruses like MHV-DVIM, huCoV OC43 and BRCV G95 [3]. Therefore, our primary assumption is that the HA activity of PEDV is attributed to the S protein. We further investigated the HA activity of the PEDV S protein by subjecting the virus or rabbit erythrocytes to neuraminidase treatment. This is based on several reports that focused on the HA activity of the spike protein of IBV and TGEV. Schultz et al. [24, 25] reported that the HA activity of IBV and TGEV can be induced by treating the virions with the neuraminidase enzyme, which removes the alpha 2,3-linked N-acetylneuraminic acid from the virus surface, while Schwegmann et al. [26] showed that neuraminidase treatment of bovine erythrocytes at less than 3 U/ml did not completely abolish agglutination by TGEV, indicating that a large amount of sialic acid on the surface of the erythrocytes was not necessary for hemagglutination by this virus. Briefly, KPEDV-9 and SM98LVec were prepared by culturing in Vero cells without supplementing with trypsin, following the method described earlier. The supernatants were harvested after 24 h then clarified by centrifugation. The virus suspensions were separated into two groups. One group was treated with 10 \u03bcg/ml trypsin as described earlier, while the other group was treated with 50 mU/ml of neuraminidase from Clostridium perfringens (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37\u00b0C for 30 min with shaking and then purified by ultracentrifugation. The purified virus was diluted to the original volume using PBS and then subjected to HA test. Rabbit erythrocytes were also treated with 2 U/ml of the neuraminidase enzyme at 37\u00b0C for 30 min and washed three times with PBS before being used in a separate HA test with the two strains of PEDV.",

The newly prepared cultures of KPEDV-9 and SM98LVec showed HA titers of 8 HA units after trypsin treatment and 2 and 4 HA units, respectively, after neuraminidase treatment. The discrepancy in the HA titer of KPEDV-9 obtained with the recent virus preparation compared to the previous preparation may have been caused by variations in the efficiency of virus replication under non-trypsin conditions. Nonetheless, the resulting HA titers were sufficient for this particular study. Differences in the HA activity between trypsin-treated and neuraminidase-treated virus can be attributed to two factors: efficiency of virus recovery during purification after neuraminidase treatment and inherent differences in the mechanism of activation of HA activity by trypsin and neuraminidase, which were not elucidated in this study. Meanwhile, neuraminidase treatment of rabbit erythrocytes did not abolish the HA activity of PEDV (Table 2). While neuraminidase-induced HA activity of PEDV was observed in rabbit erythrocytes, a similar treatment was not established for erythrocytes from other species.\n\n",

The HA activity of PEDV was elicited by trypsin or neuraminidase treatment, suggesting that proteolytic processing or removal of the N-acetylneuraminic acid from the virus surface, most likely on the spike protein, is responsible for this attribute. While the target erythrocytes of PEDV (rabbit origin) differ from those of TGEV (bovine origin), their HA activities share a common trait: neither virus requires a large number of surface-bound sialic acid residues on their target erythrocytes for a hemagglutination reaction.",

However, the conditions governing HA and the properties of hemagglutinins are very different, depending on the virus [29]. In previous studies, it was reported that some coronavirus agglutinate a variety of erythrocytes only under special conditions [2, 6]. Large variations exist among members of the family Coronaviridae in their ability to agglutinate erythrocytes. HEV readily agglutinates chicken erythrocytes at room temperature and forms a relatively permanent bond with the erythrocytes [10]. In the case of MHV, while several strains contain the HE glycoprotein, only the MHV-DVIM strain has been shown to cause hemagglutination [9, 27]. HA activity of IBV was first revealed after trypsin, phospholipase C, and neuraminidase treatment [6, 14]. Noda et al. [19] reported in 1987 that TGEV grown in primary swine kidney cell cultures agglutinated erythrocytes from chicken, guinea pig and cattle but not erythrocytes from mouse and goose at 4\u00b0C. It was also found that the HA reaction is effectively inhibited by specific antiserum.",

Both strains were able to agglutinate rabbit erythrocytes, but not the other types of erythrocytes. In addition, HA activity was only induced by treatment with either trypsin or neuraminidase, similar to that of TGEV and IBV. On the basis of these results, it can be concluded that the HA activity of PEDV is dependent on the removal of the neuraminic acid on the virion surface through either trypsin or neuraminidase treatment. The ability of PEDV to agglutinate rabbit erythrocytes, but not chicken or pig erythrocytes, can be used as a diagnostic tool to differentiate PED from TGE infection. This is particularly useful because both PEDV and TGEV infections exhibit similar clinical manifestations, and differentiation by other methods such as RT-PCR, ELISA or other commercial test kits is rather expensive. Further studies are needed to understand the mechanism of PEDV HA activity. Nonetheless, these findings provide primary insight for the development of new diagnostic methods for PEDV detection.",
