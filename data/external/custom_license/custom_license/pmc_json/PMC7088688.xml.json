            "text": "TGEV was reported in many swine-producing countries between the late 1980s and the 1990s [5\u20138]. TGEV strains of varying virulence have been isolated and characterized worldwide [9\u201312]. Some strains have been developed successfully into modified live vaccines. In China, an outbreak of transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) was first reported in the 1970s. Since then, the disease has been prevalent in the country. A TGEV was isolated from a field specimen in 1973, designated as H16, and passaged serially in PK-15 cells to level 165. Animal experiments demonstrated that pigs inoculated with H165 displayed no clinical signs of diarrhea or mortality [13]. Vaccines based on the cell cultures at passages 155\u2013165 are available commercially for the prevention and control of infections with TGEV in China. Despite the current vaccination strategy, TGE still occurs in swine in China. Various methods have been applied to detect TGEV infection in clinical fecal specimens. These include virus isolation (VI) in cell/tissue cultures, enzyme immunoassay (EIA), and cDNA probes [14\u201318]. Virus isolation requires the isolation of the virus on cell cultures, followed by quantitative analysis of the virus and this method is time consuming [16]. Standard serological tests that are used to detect TGEV also require considerable time to complete, and have not been able to distinguish between different strains. The results can be obtained using RT-PCR more rapidly than with the VI method or serological tests, and the RT-PCR technique has been used increasingly as a supplementary method in TGEV diagnosis [19\u201327]. Paton et al. [25] detected TGEV in clinical fecal specimens using single-round PCR and was able to discriminate TGEV from PRCV. Using this method, they detected viral RNA from all of the 26 different strains of TGEV and PRCV examined, covering the period from 1946 to 1996. Kim et al. [23] detected TGEV in fecal samples of swine with diarrhea using nested RT-PCR. They detected TGEV in ten intestinal and nine fecal samples, and among the nine positive fecal samples, three samples were culture negative. Chen et al. [19] established a novel real-time RT-PCR assay with the LUX primer for the detection of TGEV from different TGEV strains and clinical specimens. They found that this method is more rapid, reliable and sensitive than a gel-based RT-PCR method. The above-mentioned studies indicate that RT-PCR can be useful as a routine diagnostic method for the detection of TGEV in fecal specimens, particularly during the early and late stages of infection when the viral load may be below the limit of detection by other less sensitive methods. Given that the tests employed currently to diagnose TGEV (VI, EIA, RT-PCR, etc.) lack the capacity to differentiate between the vaccine strain and the wild field strains, the use of RT-PCR followed by RFLP may be required. In the case of PEDV, which belongs to the family Coronaviridae with TGEV, Song et al. [28] used RT-PCR\u2013RFLP to differentiate a Vero cell-adapted PEDV from Korean field strains by RFLP analysis of ORF3. The application of RT-PCR and subsequent RFLP analysis with the restriction endonuclease HindIII and XhoI enabled them to differentiate attenuated PEDV from other Korean field strains. Lee et al. [29] developed a RT-PCR\u2013RFLP method to differentiate field strains of PEDV and a vaccine strain, J-vac. Furthermore, Lai et al. [30] used arms PCR and RFLP analysis with four separate restriction enzymes (BstEII, Alw26I, DraIII, or MspA1I) to identify the genetic profiles of virulent, attenuated or vaccine strains of TGEV and PRCV.",

Three-step procedures were performed in a thermal cycler (TaKaRa) under the following conditions. A 5-min denaturation step at 94\u00b0C was used, followed by a number of amplification cycles: 30 s at 95\u00b0C, 30 s at the annealing temperature 64\u00b0C, an elongation step at 72\u00b0C for 1 min and 15 s, and an extra extension step of 10 min at 72\u00b0C.

A 5 \u03bcl volume of each PCR product was electrophoresed through 1.0% agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide and observed using a UV transilluminator. The conditions for each sample that yielded a positive result of amplification were tested two to three times to ensure consistency of the results. A negative control was always included. The specificity of the PCR was evaluated using other common viral causative agents of diarrhea: porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and porcine rotavirus and the PCR oligonucleotides used to amplify bands were as described previously [31, 32].",

Three groups, group 1 (G1), group 2 (G2), and group 3 (G3), had significant differences in their nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences.
