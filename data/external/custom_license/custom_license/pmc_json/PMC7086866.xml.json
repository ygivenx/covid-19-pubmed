            "text": "Coronaviruses are an important group of viruses that cause highly contagious respiratory and enteric diseases in animals and humans [13]. Avian corona viruses can infect a wide range of avian species, particularly those reared in close proximity to domesticated poultry, such as fowl, partridge, geese, pigeons, guinea fowl, teal, ducks, and pea fowl [8]. Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) causes enormous problems, causing a highly contagious disease in chickens. Respiratory, reproductive, digestive, and renal infections are the primary clinically important types of IBV infections in domestic chickens [15]. IBV belongs to the genus Gammacoronavirus, along with other avian coronaviruses. It is an enveloped, positive-stranded RNA virus with a genome of about 27 kb containing 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 untranslated regions (UTRs) and a poly(A) tail [5]. A major part of the genome is composed of two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs), 1a and 1b, which are translated into large polyproteins 1a and 1ab, respectively, through a ribosomal frameshift mechanism. The primary structural proteins spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) are encoded in the remaining part of the RNA genome [20, 24]. The glycoprotein S consists of two subunits (S1 and S2) and contains a wide variety of antigenic determinants that may induce the production of specific neutralizing antibodies. Mutations within this genomic region may result in the emergence of new viral variants [19]. In recent years, genotyping has been performed using S1 gene sequencing [17], which has become the procedure of choice for differentiating between vaccine and field viruses.",

IB still causes serious problems in the Iraqi poultry industry due to the inability of vaccines to provide cross-protection between different genotypes. Due to the limited network of poultry diagnostic laboratories in Iraq, differential diagnosis is can only be done based on clinical signs and gross lesions. The characterization of IBV has raised additional problems in terms of both epidemiology and control. Although IBV on the poultry farms in Iraq (with H120 and 4/91 strains) is presently controlled by inactivated and live attenuated vaccines, outbreaks of IB have nevertheless been observed on broiler farms [1, 21]. Thus, the spread of viral respiratory diseases has become the most commonly reported condition in commercial broiler flocks in Iraq; however, there have been no studies on the detection and genotyping of these viruses using molecular techniques and sequencing. In this study, genotyping of IBV isolates from broiler farms in the south and middle of Iraq was carried out based on partial S1 sequencing.",

The sequence identities within the sequenced groups were 99.36 %\u2013100 % for group 1, 96.42 %\u2013100 % for group 2 and 99.68 %\u2013100 % for group 3 (Table 3). IS/1494-like viruses (group I) shared high nucleotide sequence identity (99.67 %) with IS/1494/06, Kurdistan-Erbil 12VIR10065-16, Kurdistan-Sulaymania 12VIR10065-5, and Eg/CLEVB-2/IBV 012, while showing 98 % similarity to CH/Turkey 10RS-3161. In 793/B-like viruses (group II), the partial S1 sequences of the Iraqi strains showed 100 % identity to the pathogenic 4/91 strain. In addition, the sequence analysis of group II revealed high levels of nucleotide sequence similarity (96.39 % and 100 % identity) to the IR-1062-GA and IR-Razi-HKM1-2010 strains, respectively. The QX-like viruses (group III) were 98.39 % identical to the Chinese QX (AF193423) strain. This group shared 99.68 % identity with the Iranian QX IBV strain (PCR Lab/06/2012). Group III viruses were 99.68 % to 100 % identical to CH/AH 2010, HC10 and CH /JS/YC11-1. SGK-2 (DY12-2 like virus) was related to CK/CH/SC/DY12-2, CH/Guangdong Xindadi 0903 and CK/CH/ZJ QZ12-2 strains, with 98.72 % identity.\n",

Respiratory diseases caused by bacteria and mycoplasmas have already been detected on broiler farms located in the central and southern parts of Iraq. However, the molecular detection studies (infection rate and genotyping) of respiratory viral diseases such as IB in broilers in Iraq are limited (personal communication with veterinary organizations). We conducted the first study to determine the infection rate and IBV genotypes on broiler farms, using molecular and phylogenetic techniques. The approved vaccine strains used in Iraq are based on serotypes Ma5, H120, and 793/B [21]. IB still causes serious problems in the Iraqi poultry industry due to the inability of the vaccines to provide cross-protection between different genotypes [1]. The genotyping of IBV is necessary not only for understanding virus evolution but also for effective modification of the vaccination programs [10]. In this study, the infection rate of IBV was 32 %, which indicated widespread distribution of IBV in the southern and middle parts of Iraq. The highest infection rate of IBV was observed in Al-Najaf (50 %) governorate, while the lowest (20 %) was observed in Al-Muthana (Fig. 3). The results of the present work are in line with a study by Al-Dabhawi et al., who reported an IBV prevalence of 92.1 % in the samples collected from central Iraq, using quantitative PCR. In the latter study, 20 % were infected with IBV alone, 45.71 % were infected with IBV and Mycoplasma gallisepticum and/or avian influenza virus (subtype H9), and 25.71 % were positive for both IBV and avian influenza virus [1]. The current result is comparable to what has been observed in Saudi Arabia, where 35.36 % of tested commercial poultry farms were positive for IBV [32]. The infection rate was lower than the rate previously reported on commercial farms within neighboring countries: 58.8 % and 42.8 % in Jordan and Iran, respectively [2]. Even where there were no poultry farms in Iraq, the infection rate was as high as 32 %. This may be attributed to poor biosecurity on the farms, resulting in the spread of infection between and within the flocks [22].\n",

They shared high nucleotide sequence identity with IBV isolates from Iran, Israel, Egypt, Turkey, and Kurdistan. The isolation of IS/1494/06 (EU780077) IBV, one of two Israeli variant strains, was first reported by Meier and Mahar in Israel [23]. IBV variants have been recognized in Iraq since 2012 (Iraqi Veterinary Directorate/Ministry of Agriculture). The present work is similar to another study in which three IBV genotypes were found in Slemani-Kurdistan, Iraq, including group A (very similar to Iranian isolates), group B (closely related to Chinese isolates) and group C (similar to IS/1494 and Egypt/Beni-Seuf/01 isolates) [26]. These findings are in agreement with those of Kanan et al., who reported that IS/1494/06 IBV was the most common genotype in Egypt (2010), Lebanon (2010-2012), Jordan (2011-2012), Kuwait (2012), and Oman (2013) [12].

The present study revealed the presence of 793/B on the broiler farms. The IBV strains of the 793/B serotype were first identified in France in 1985, followed by Great Britain in 1991. Subsequently, these strains spread to other countries in Europe, Asia (Particularly to Iran, Turkey), and North America and are some of the most common IBV serotypes in some countries [9]. Our result were in line with those of Mahmood et al., who conducted the first study of identification and genotyping of IBV isolates and indicated that the 4/91-like virus is circulating on vaccinated broiler farms of the Kurdistan region of Iraq [21]. The detection of 793/B in commercial flocks was previously reported in Iran, Jordan, and Israel [23, 27, 29]. However, because all flocks have been vaccinated, we concluded that the detected viruses probably belonged to the vaccine strains. Therefore, the full-length S1 gene of the isolates should be determined to differentiate field and vaccine isolates. In this study, another important IBV variant (QX-like) known to cause respiratory, renal, and reproductive problems [12] was detected with a prevalence of 9.37 %. In 1996, QX was first described and identified in China, after which the prevalence of the so-called QX-like IBV genotype was reported, and it became one of the most dominant genotypes in many countries [28]. The genotype, designated as QX IBV, has spread from Asia, where it was described for the first time in 1996 in China, and spread to Europe and recently to the southern part of the African continent [4]. The QX-like genotype was also previously detected in central Iraq by the Iraqi veterinary directorate (official report). This finding was in line with another study in the Kurdistan region of Iraq, which showed that the phylogenetic aspects of the Kurdistan viruses were closely related (98.9 %) to the QX strain reported in China from 2009 to 2010 [4]. QX-type virus was isolated in Israel in 2004 [4]. The PCR Lab/06/2012 (JX477827) strain was isolated in Iran, which is genetically (99.36 %\u201399.68 %) related to strains of the present study [6]. This finding revealed that the QX strain has been widely transferred from other countries (probably Iran) to Iraq. Although no information is currently available about the introduction of the QX strain from China into other countries, it has been hypothesized that wild birds may be the source of introduction based on the evidence that IBV may replicate in members of the order Anseriformes [25].",

This is the first report indicating the presence of an IBV DY12-2-like strain in the Middle East. It is an updated and comprehensive study of genotyping of IBV in Iraq and completes the IBV puzzle in the region. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the detected strains are closely related to other IBV strains infecting broilers, pullets, and layers in the region. Finally, it could be suggested that 1) work be done on whole-genome sequencing, 2) cross-protection studies be conducted for designing the best vaccination program in the Iraqi poultry industry, 3) molecular surveillance in other governorates in Iraq be continued, and 4) the pathogenesis of different Iraqi IBV isolates be studied.",
