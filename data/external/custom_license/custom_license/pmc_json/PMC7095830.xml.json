In addition, monocytes crawling along the lumen of blood vessels may infiltrate tissues early in infection to then recruit neutrophils1. The upregulation of adhesion molecules, such as selectins, on endothelium is essential to initiate neutrophil recruitment. P-selectin, stored in Weibel-Palade bodies within resting endothelial cells, and E-selectin, which is synthesized de novo, are translocated to the apical cell membrane where they transiently bind ligands on neutrophils, including P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), E-selectin ligand-1 (ESL-1), CD44 and other glycosylated ligands (Fig. 1). Transient interactions between selectins and their ligands on neutrophils result in neutrophil tethering and rolling, which are the first steps of the leukocyte recruitment cascade2,3.",

Teleologically, because endothelial cells are elongated in the direction of flow, perpendicular crawling allows a neutrophil to find an endothelial junction in the shortest period of time. This inherent response to shear might be important for rapid transmigration, as neutrophils have been shown to preferentially transmigrate through junctions5,6,7,8,9,10,11 unless crawling was specifically inhibited5. In CD11b-deficient mice, neutrophils did not crawl within the vasculature, and, consequently, transcellular transmigration through endothelial cells predominated5. Endothelial cells are very active and responsive during transmigration and form docking structures (endothelial projections)12,13,14 that, in vivo, resulted in domes surrounding the entire neutrophil15,16,17. Endothelial membrane proteins, including PECAM-1, ESAM-1 and CD99, aid neutrophil emigration, and additional adhesive molecules help neutrophils move across the basement membrane through areas with low expression of laminin, collagen and nidogen-2 (ref. 18). Reverse migration back into the vessel is prevented by endothelial JAM-C11,19.",

Early work proposed that proinflammatory molecules such as platelet-activating factor were embedded in the membrane of activated endothelium and functioned in a juxtacrine manner to activate and polarize neutrophils23. Evidence is now emerging that chemokines also form gradients within the vascular compartment. Experiments in which a chemokine source was placed on one side of a blood vessel showed that the crawling neutrophils were directed to emigrate from that side of the vessel and that heparan sulfate was necessary for this process24. The heparan sulfate residues on the surface of endothelium prevent dissolution of the chemokine gradients into the blood and provide localized directional cues for crawling neutrophils24. These observations were made using CXCL1 and CXCL2 chemokines, but it is notable that different chemokines bind with different affinities to heparan sulfate25,26, so whether all chemokines can establish these heptotactic gradients remains unclear.",

Neutrophils have been shown to respond to such guidance signals in a hierarchical manner, preferring 'end-target' chemoattractant factors such as bacterial products (for example, N-formyl-methionine-leucine-phenylalanine (fMLP)) and C5a over 'intermediate' chemokines such as IL-8 (ref. 27). This preference raised the possibility that separate signaling pathways were activated in neutrophils in response to fMLP and IL-8. Notably, both fMLP and IL-8 activated the same pathway by activating the class I isoform of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), which phosphorylates the membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate (PIP2) into phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) at the leading edge of the neutrophil (Fig. 2). At the same time, the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is localized to the sides and back of the crawling cell, thereby converting PIP3 back to PIP2 in areas of the cell away from the leading edge28. It is worth mentioning that there is a body of work that suggests that SHIP rather than PTEN is the important phosphatase in this process29. This mechanism is thought to allow the neutrophil to recognize and amplify shallow gradients of only a few molecules along its length to know that it must move in the direction of PIP3. In opposing gradients, PTEN and PIP2 surround the entire cell circumference (Fig. 2c), and no gradient is recognized. However, if the same pathway is activated by all chemoattractants and PIP2 surrounds the entire cell, then how does a neutrophil ever detect a gradient? A number of groups have shown that fMLP but not IL-8 also activates p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (Fig. 2b)30,31, and that the fMLP-induced p38 MAPK allowed the neutrophil to respond to the bacterial product (Fig. 2c)32. Additional molecules that contribute to chemoattractant signaling in migrating cells ranging from Dictyostelium to neutrophils have been described recently, for example, PLA2 (ref. 33), cGMP34 and DOCK2/plus phosphatidic acid35, but whether they have redundant or distinct functions and how they fit into the hierarchical nature of neutrophil chemotaxis remains unclear.",

            "text": "Although no formal evidence of multiple in vivo gradients of chemoattractants exists, it is hard to imagine how neutrophils could move through numerous compartments over a substantial distance using only a single gradient. When one considers that a neutrophil adheres to the endothelium after being activated by endothelially produced and apically sequestered IL-8, unless a second chemoattractant is released from the affected tissue, it is difficult to understand why neutrophils would move out of the vasculature and away from the vessel. Once they have emigrated, neutrophils need to migrate toward the bacterial focus or the dying cells without being distracted by what would then be an opposing IL-8 gradient coming from the vasculature. Receptor internalization of IL-8, allowing a second chemoattractant to dominate in a sequential manner, could occur36. Alternatively, a hierarchical response may take place in which fMLP and other end-target chemoattractants inhibit the IL-8 signal30. Recently, an in vivo experiment showed that neutrophils in sinusoidal vessels initially crawled along an MIP-2 gradient but then ignored this signal and followed a new gradient of fMLP receptor ligands laid over the MIP-2 gradient, thus gaining access to a precise tissue site37 (Fig. 3). Therefore, growing evidence indicates that neutrophil recruitment in vivo results from the release of multiple chemoattractants and that synergistic and opposing effects of the involved signaling molecules are likely to govern neutrophil recruitment into the afflicted tissues.",

As a corollary, neutrophil migration defects have consistently been reported in septic individuals38. Sepsis is clinically defined by the presence of infection plus some of the following: fever, tachypnea, edema and increased or decreased white blood cell counts, high serum concentrations of chemokines and C-reactive protein, and hemodynamic alterations. When multiple organs begin to fail, this leads to severe sepsis39. Severe sepsis has one of the highest mortality rates of any disease state. Most importantly, anyone of any age is susceptible to sepsis (although the very young and very old are at the highest risk), and any delay in the immune response is likely to increase mortality, making rapid neutrophil recruitment a key endogenous host defense mechanism. Indeed, neutropenic individuals are highly susceptible to sepsis40. Despite the clear need for effective neutrophil function, overexuberant neutrophils can potentially injure 'bystander' tissues that are not part of the infected site. In fact, for many years, neutrophils have been a therapeutic target in sepsis. Total elimination of neutrophils would lead to death, but altering or modifying their actions may have potential clinical benefits.",

In fact, LPS downregulates CXCR2 on human and mouse neutrophils, thereby inhibiting chemotaxis toward IL-8 in humans and toward KC and MIP-2 in mice44. This downregulation is prevented by interleukin-33 (IL-33) through inhibition of receptor internalization44. Lipoteichoic acid, a component of Gram-negative cell walls and a TLR2 ligand, has been shown to cause downregulation of CXCR2, which would reduce neutrophil chemotaxis45. It is clear that bacterial products that activate TLRs may disrupt neutrophil chemotaxis. These data are consistent with the improved bacterial localization and clearance observed in mice that express TLRs only on endothelium and not on neutrophils or other immune cells46. In wild-type mice, TLRs on macrophages and other immune cells systemically release many chemokines and cytokines that may distract neutrophils and prevent them from locating bacteria46. In addition, circulating activated neutrophils become rigid and can be trapped within the small capillaries of the lung and in liver sinusoids and thereby are prevented from finding bacteria in compartments like the peritoneum, from which the bacteria may be emanating. Finally, certain bacterial proteases have been shown to cleave and inactivate CXC chemokines, thereby impeding the chemotaxis of neutrophils to the source of infection, which decreases bacterial clearance and increases systemic dissemination47.",

Nitric oxide (NO) is known to have antiadhesive properties that are mediated by downregulating endothelial adhesion molecules49,50, and the induction of vast amounts of NO through inducible NO synthase could also reduce neutrophil chemotaxis38,51. Moreover, therapeutically administered inhaled NO given to septic individuals with pulmonary hypertension could dislodge neutrophils from lungs, which might be beneficial but could also inhibit their chemotaxis to the necessary sites. There are many unanswered questions about the role of NO in sepsis, but general inhibition of NO may actually harm septic individuals52, although specific inhibition of inducible NO synthase could perhaps be of benefit. Finally, peroxisome proliferator\u2013activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR-\u03b3) seems to be an endogenous inhibitor of chemotaxis. This molecule is activated during sepsis and could also contribute to neutrophil impairment.",

Furthermore, organ failure, which is a major and crucial component of sepsis syndrome in humans, cannot be readily studied in mice that have received high doses of LPS or bacteria because they die before developing these secondary complications. Therefore, the results from models such as cecal ligation and puncture in mice, although more variable, may better reflect the human condition.

Most studies have focused on how neutrophil recruitment at this stage is turned off, with molecules such as resolvins taking center stage72. However, neutrophils may also contribute to tissue restitution and angiogenesis. Neutrophils produce and store proangiogenic molecules such as vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A)73 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9)74 within their granules. VEGF is a key player in blood vessel formation and has a direct chemotactic effect on endothelial cells. The proangiogenic function of MMP-9 is attributed to its ability to release VEGF and other growth factors bound to the extracellular matrix and to digest the extracellular matrix to pave the way for new vessels. The neutrophils are the only cells in the body that can release MMP-9 free of its endogenous inhibitor, TIMP, and are therefore capable of delivering highly active MMP-9 to angiogenic sites74. The proangiogenic capacity of neutrophils has been shown in a corneal injury model, where the number of infiltrated neutrophils positively correlated with angiogenesis and VEGF levels75. Neutrophil depletion markedly impaired the release of VEGF and tissue healing in this model. Furthermore, another study showed that isolated pancreatic islets transplanted to muscle did not revascularize in neutropenic mice, whereas intra-islet vasculature was restored after transplantation to wild-type mice, showing that recruited neutrophils are important in the initiation of angiogenesis76. Outside the focus of this review, but worth mentioning, is the growing evidence that neutrophils may also contribute to cancer through their effects on angiogenesis77,78. A final important point is that neutrophils have been purported to recruit monocytes that may help to remove dead and dying neutrophils but that might also assist in angiogenesis and restitution79.",

Under static in vitro conditions, neutrophils can effectively chase after and phagocytose bacteria, but under in vivo flow conditions in blood, this is expected to be a highly inefficient process. However, neutrophils seem to have adapted additional mechanisms for fighting bacteria. Neutrophils have been shown to release their DNA in a net-like fashion in the presence of various bacteria80 to create traps called NETs. These NETs are covered in proteases (including elastase) and other antimicrobial molecules (such as histones), and these toxic molecules may contribute to host cell injury.

In separate studies, eosinophils and neutrophils were found to catapult their DNA out of the cell into the extracellular space, but the DNA source was non-nuclear and, instead, the DNA originated from the mitochondria82,83. However, most other groups have not reported a role for mitochondrial DNA and have documented the presence of histones on the NETs, suggesting a nuclear source for the DNA. In addition to their direct antimicrobial effects, there is also evidence that histones may have a regulatory role during NET formation, as the process of NET formation starts with histone hypercitrullination and decondensation of the associated nuclear chromatin84. During NET formation induced by LPS, IL-8, fMLP or Shigella flexneri, increased histone H3 citrullination occurred through peptidylarginine deiminases. Citrullination is the conversion of positively charged arginine side chains into polar but uncharged citrulline side chains by deimination. Although there are five known peptidylarginine deiminases in humans, only peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4), which is expressed by neutrophils, has a classical nuclear localization signal, and PAD4 inhibition was shown to prevent histone H3 citrullination and substantially reduce NET release. However, in addition to the beneficial roles of histones, Esmon and his colleagues85 recently showed that histones injure the endothelium. They also found that activated protein C (APC), a therapeutic protein approved to treat sepsis, disables histone toxicity and preserves host cells85.",

Figure 4 summarizes this process, first showing the profound rounding and decondensation of the nucleus followed by the formation of large bleb-like structures between the inner and outer nuclear membrane, with vesicles pinching off the nuclear membrane and ultimately releasing NETs. This process was seen in the first 30\u201360 min after neutrophil activation, when no neutrophil lysis was observed. Eventually, the nuclear membrane completely broke down, perhaps leading to the release of NETs through a lytic event at a later time point (3\u20134 h after activation).

In arthropods, hemolymph contains hemocytes, which are nucleated circulating cells responsible for immunity as well as for coagulation. In higher order species, these functions have diverged into more specialized cells, but the platelet has retained some essential immune functions, particularly in partnership with neurophils and other phagocytes. Indeed, platelets can bind monocytes and neutrophils, leading to the transcellular synthesis of various inflammatory molecules90,91. Even on its own, the platelet is an important immune cell and outnumbers all other leukocytes tenfold. Platelets express many major innate immune receptors, including most TLRs, thrombin-binding protease-activated receptors, complement receptors and numerous adhesion molecules91. Animal models have indicated that platelets are crucial to sepsis and acute lung injury92. In humans, thrombocytopenia, a prognostic marker for a poor outcome in sepsis, is a major complication in sepsis that often occurs in the sickest individuals (Box 1). Although disseminated intravascular coagulation and bone marrow suppression were thought to be the key reasons for this problem, administration of LPS caused platelets to disappear from the circulation within an hour93, suggesting that bone marrow suppression is an unlikely cause of thromocytopenia in some individuals. Platelets that have been sequestered into organs by binding to the endothelium or to already adherent neutrophils could explain some of the thrombocytopenia that occurs.",

Although LPS also activates platelets, LPS-induced platelet responses appear to be far more subtle than those induced by thrombin. In fact, hallmark features of platelet activation, including P-selectin expression and platelet aggregation, are arguably not observed in response to LPS. LPS also induces potent platelet-dependent TNF production93. Following LPS administration, many platelets are sequestered in the lungs93 and bind avidly to adherent neutrophils in the liver88 (Fig. 5). Platelet-neutrophil binding has been shown to depend on TLR4 expressed by the platelet, suggesting that this anuclear cell actively participates in the adhesive interaction. In fact, activated neutrophils alone did not injure the endothelium, but the binding of TLR4-activated platelets to neutrophils induced endothelial cell death88.",

            "text": "Under flow conditions, platelets have been shown to induce neutrophils to release NETs, thereby contributing to the killing of bacteria through this mechanism88. Why might a platelet-dependent NET mechanism be required? As neutrophils are activated at 100-fold lower concentrations of LPS than platelets are, and as LPS induces the non-NET\u2013related functions of neutrophils, the platelet might function as a barometer for detecting substantial levels of bacterial products in blood. Platelets could then bind neutrophils and induce NET production as a last gasp effort to trap and destroy bacteria. This mechanism might occur preferentially in the vast microvasculature of the liver and lung where trapping of blood-borne bacteria may be the most efficient. Indeed, when a neutrophil binds in the very narrow sinusoids of the liver, it does not completely occlude the vessel, allowing plasma and bacteria to be skimmed around the neutrophils and collected in the released NETs. Although concentrations of LPS that are unlikely to ever be seen in infected humans were used in this model system, blood from septic individuals was equally effective at inducing NETs88. The major difference between the LPS and septic blood studies was that TLR4 only accounted for 30% of the NET formation in septic blood, suggesting that additional activators are present in septic blood.",

Another question that remains to be addressed, the answer to which may also differ in mice and humans, is whether there are different neutrophil subtypes, much like for monocytes. Indeed, mice have been reported to have multiple neutrophil subsets with unique surface receptor phenotypes and effector functions94. During experimental endotoxemia in humans, there is a large mobilization of band-like immature neutrophils that are CD16 low (compared to CD16 high for their mature counterparts). These immature cells tended to be less responsive to stimuli after administration of LPS and showed a smaller oxidative burst and reduced interactions with bacteria95.",

The possibility that a population of tissue-resident or perhaps continuously recirculating 'pioneer' neutrophils exists is intriguing96, although there is currently no direct evidence for this hypothesis. Indeed, it is possible that if a group of neutrophils expresses high concentrations of neutrophil chemotactic molecules such as LTB4, this may position it as a unique sentinel population that can recruit further neutrophil subsets97. The continuous expression of cytokines may also alter the neutrophil phenotype by inducing the expression of receptors that have normally been thought to recruit monocytes (such CCR2 and CCR1)98. In fact, the neutrophil phenotype may vary substantially over a typical septic episode that could last weeks. Understanding this moving target will be key to therapeutically modulating neutrophil function and also in the treatment of sepsis. In conclusion, theoretical intervention points affecting neutrophil biology that may be considered when treating sepsis include blocking platelet function or their binding to neutrophils, NET inhibition and targeting formylated peptides while preserving mitochondrial function.",
