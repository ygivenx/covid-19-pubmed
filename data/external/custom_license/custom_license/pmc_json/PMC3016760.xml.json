He had no cough and no other symptoms. Leukocyte and lymphocyte counts were normal. The chest radiograph showed no abnormalities. He did not receive any treatment except rest at home. His symptoms disappeared after 2 days. He completely recovered and returned to work 4 days after onset of symptoms.

However, their serum specimens were positive for IgG against SARS-CoV by ELISA. Those results strongly indicate that both patients had been infected with SARS-CoV, although their signs and symptoms did not meet the criteria for the SARS case definition. Mild SARS-CoV infection may not easily be defined clinically, and such patients may potentially spread the disease if they are not isolated.",
