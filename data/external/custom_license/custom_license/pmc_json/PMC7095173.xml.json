As with the approach of smallpox eradication in the 1950s, when vaccine research came to a standstill, the research and development of new polio vaccines has slowed. This slowdown must be reversed, and new vaccines once again developed and made available.",

For example, effective biocontainment of all existing polioviruses is needed to minimize the risk of accidental infections. And OPV use worldwide must be discontinued to minimize the likelihood that mutated strains of the vaccine polioviruses lead to new outbreaks. The WHO must establish an international stockpile of monovalent OPVs or mOPVs (generated from a single strain of virus) and a response mechanism for their use should poliovirus re-emerge after the current trivalent OPV stops being used. Specifically, the world now needs mOPV for type 1, 2 and 3 poliovirus, and a new type of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) that is manufactured from stocks of weakened live poliovirus strains rather than from wild poliovirus, as is current practice. Finally, it is essential that the expertise required to scale up the production of trivalent OPV (which confers immunity against all three types of poliovirus) is maintained should the vaccine needs of any future outbreaks exceed the capacity of the stockpile.",

In September 2003, a WHO consultation group on vaccine-derived polioviruses reviewed the epidemiological and genetic sequence data from the known cVDPV outbreaks and concluded that, to prevent future outbreaks after eradication, the use of trivalent OPV for routine immunization must be stopped2.

Type 1, 2 and 3 mOPVs were licensed and used in the early days of polio control. But as trivalent OPV became the accepted formulation, licences for these vaccines were not renewed. At the request of the WHO, at least two OPV manufacturers have recently begun to again develop and license type 1 mOPV, and licences for this vaccine have been granted in France and India. The development and licencing process for type 2 and 3 monovalents is planned, and must proceed as soon as possible. Once completed, these two new polio vaccines will be available for stockpiling. Type 1 mOPV may also play an important role in breaking the final chains of polio transmission in populous urban areas where only type 1 virus remains, and where a monovalent type 1 vaccine would therefore be more effective.",

Following the creation of the stockpile, and OPV cessation, the capacity to produce OPV will probably be lost as market incentives to continue production disappear.
