However, irrational antibiotic using has also become a common issue worldwide [1\u20133], which has resulted in a rise and exacerbation of antibiotic resistance, and leading to a decline in clinical efficacy and an increase in adverse reactions. Irrational antibiotic use has presented an enormous challenge to infection control in hospitals. The World Health Organization (WHO) considers \u201cbacterial resistance\u201d to be one of the healthcare issues that is severely threatening to human life. Similarly, China is also facing a large threat from antibiotic use [4\u20136]. To enhance the management of antimicrobial agents, the Ministry of Health (MOH) of the People\u2019s Republic of China released the \u201cNationwide Special Campaign for Antibiotic Stewardship Program (ASP) 2011\u201d and conducted a specific rectification of irrational antibiotic use in China [6\u201310]. In this study, we investigated and analyzed the changes in relevant indicators in antibiotic use in 41 medical organizations (19 tertiary hospitals and 22 secondary hospitals) between 2011 and 2013 in an attempt to evaluate the effectiveness of specific activities in the control of antibiotic use in secondary and tertiary hospitals in Tianjin, China.",

Mexico and Brazil use promulgation of policy to restrict antibiotic sales; the restriction on antibiotics use has an influence on the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and analgesics drugs [19].

Training on rational antibiotic use was enhanced to strictly control drug indication and administration, and to determine the frequency of antibiotic use based on pharmacokinetic features, following the principle of \u201cminimum effective dose and shortest treatment course\u201d. Antibiotic use was guided by the results of bacterial culture and drug susceptibility testing. Scientific, efficient, pragmatic, and advanced management of antibiotic use was accomplished through implementation of a long-term scientific and comprehensive management system. Based on information technology, this system monitored nosocomial infections and outbreaks in general hospitals via clinical antibiotic use and resistance surveillance networks. Combined with a computer-assisted electronic prescription system, this strategy achieved highly efficient, scientific, and pragmatic management of antibiotic use, reducing the length of hospital stays, decreasing the misuse of healthcare resources, and delaying antibiotic resistance [28\u201331].",

Drug resistance of Acinetobacter baumannii decreased, as evidenced by the reduction of meropenem resistance from 26.16% to 14.04%.
