The genus Vesivirus includes feline calicivirus, a highly contagious pathogen with a widespread distribution in the feline population. Oral ulcers, upper respiratory symptoms and high fever are the main clinical signs in FCV-infected kittens, followed by subclinical syndrome, including chronic stomatitis, pneumonitis and limping syndrome. Cats with \u2018virulent systemic FCV disease\u2019 variably show pyrexia, cutaneous edema, ulcerative lesions on the head and limbs, and jaundice. The disease is more severe in adult cats, with higher mortality [7, 25]. In addition, persistent infections lead to a high prevalence of FCV, ranging from approximately 10 % in the general cat population to as much as 90 % in some colonies [24, 36]. Therefore, treating and preventing FCV infection is challenging.",

Indeed, evolutionary rates of the variable regions of the capsid protein have been estimated to be up to 1.3 \u00d7 10\u22122 to 2.6 \u00d7 10\u22122 substitutions per nucleotide per year [8]. Accordingly, older vaccines cannot provide cross-protection against newer strains [22, 23]. In addition, the genetic and antigenic landscape is highly complex in each geographical location; thus, vaccine application must be based on an assessment of the situation at both the local and national level [9]. FCV vaccines are generally effective at reducing the severity and duration of clinical signs but do not prevent infection or shedding [24]. Given the insufficiency of FCV vaccines, it is necessary to develop a safe and effective antiviral drug as a monotherapy or combination treatment. In addition to its significance for feline health, FCV is frequently used as a model for human noroviruses, an important cause of vomiting and diarrhea in people [32, 33].",

Feline-calicivirus-specific antiviral phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMO) were tested in naturally occurring outbreaks of FCV, and the results demonstrated that PMO can work as a high-efficiency drug to treat FCV disease [30]. Mefloquine was employed as monotherapy or combination treatment with rFeIFN-\u03c9 [20], but deficiencies in a number of drug metabolism pathways have been recognized in humans [20]. For more than fifty years, lithium chloride (LiCl) has been used as a major treatment for bipolar disorder [18], and the mechanisms of LiCl have been explored, particularly for treating Alzheimer\u2019s disease [10], diabetes [16], and serous ovarian cancer [21], and also as an antimicrobial agent. Studies have demonstrated that LiCl can inhibit the replication of some viruses, such as herpes simplex virus 1 [29], coronavirus [27], infectious bronchitis virus [17], and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) [11], and it can suppress inflammatory responses [11], modulate cell apoptosis [27], and restore host protein synthesis in infected cells [35]. However, it remains unknown whether LiCl can inhibit FCV replication. In this study, the antiviral activity of LiCl on FCV was investigated in vitro, and we found that LiCl inhibited FCV replication in a dose-dependent manner.",

Inhibition by LiCl occurred primarily in the early stages and was dose dependent. LiCl treatment also inhibited the cytopathic effect of FCV. These results are consistent with the inhibitory effect of LiCl on other viruses such as HSV-1, transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus, and infectious bronchitis virus and indicate that the antiviral effect of LiCl may be a general feature of this drug on certain viruses, e.g., coronaviruses [12]. Although the frequency of FCV gene mutation is high, all FCV strains belong to the same serotype. In addition, F9 as well as another seven FCV strains show the same sensitivity to the antiviral drug mefloquine [20]. While the antiviral efficiency varied for different FCV strains infection, LiCl could function in the currently circulating viruses in China.",

In addition, when the concentration of LiCl was increased from 10 mM to 100 mM, the viability of CRFK cells decreased by less than 20 % at 24 h post-inoculation. However, the viability decreased to under 50 % at 72 h post-inoculation. F9 and other FCV strains replicate and spread rapidly. FCV-induced CPE on CRFK cells is obvious at 12 h postinfection at an MOI of 0.1, with nearly all cells becoming rounded and sloughing at 24 h postinfection. Thus, it is reasonable to use a high dose of LiCl to evaluate its antiviral effects against FCV replication in vitro, but high concentrations of LiCl in blood can cause side or toxic effects [34]. Symptoms associated with it are generally mild, including tremor, nausea, diarrhea, vertigo, and confusion [14]. However, higher lithium levels in the plasma rarely lead to persistent neurological deficits [3]. Lithium does not appear to be carcinogenic or mutagenic but may lead to renal and liver damage at prolonged exposures to serum levels of 2 mM or more [5].",

LiCl regulates multiple biological processes [34] and is considered to be a nonspecific inhibitor of GSK3\u03b2. LiCl has been shown to effectively suppress EV-A71 replication, apoptosis, and inflammatory cytokine production (interleukin 6, interleukin-1\u03b2) in infected cells [15]. However, LiCl attenuates LPS-, poly(I:C)- and Sendai-virus-induced IFN-\u03b2 production in a GSK3\u03b2-independent manner in macrophages [34], which appears to be contradictory with regard to the antiviral effects of LiCl. LiCl is widely used as a long-term mood stabilizer in the treatment of psychiatric diseases due to its inhibition of GSK3\u03b2, a multifunctional kinase involved in cellular processes, including glycogen metabolism, cell proliferation, neuronal function, oncogenesis, and development [5, 6], and recent studies have provided evidence for the involvement of GSK3\u03b2 in innate immune responses [1]. GSK3\u03b2 is also a crucial regulator of the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine production in both the peripheral and central nervous system and influences T-cell proliferation, differentiation and survival [1]. LiCl is not only a specific inhibitor of enzymes belonging to the GSK family but also of pyruvate kinase, polyphosphate 1-phosphatase, and inositol monophosphate [6, 13]. The precise mechanism of the antiviral effect of LiCl needs to be investigated further.",
