Additionally, most have longer lifespans than terrestrial mammals of similar body sizes, despite their high metabolic rate and its predicted consequences on oxidative metabolism. As such, they have one of the greatest disparities between body mass and longevity (Ball et al. 2018; Bozek et al. 2017; Davies et al. 2014; Hughes et al. 2018; Munshi-South and Wilkinson 2010; Wilkinson and Adams 2019). Their longevity has been attributed, at least in part, to enhanced oxidative stress resistance and protein homeostasis (Salmon et al. 2009; Yin et al. 2016). The body temperature of bats raises drastically during flight (O'Shea et al. 2014), and there is an excessive increase in metabolic rate and presumably oxidative stress, with heart rates up to 1200 bpm (O'Mara et al. 2017; Podlutsky et al. 2005). Anecdotal evidence from carers suggests that fruit bats can tolerate prolonged heat stress in the wild if they remain well hydrated.",

            "text": "Heat shock proteins (HSPs), as evident from their namesake, are produced in response to high temperature though also from other stress responses. There are five general classes: HSP30/40 (DNAJs), HSP60 (HSPD), HSP70 (HSPA1/4/5/8/9), HSP90 and small HSPs. Heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and 90 (HSP90) are among the better characterized HSPs. A key function of HSPs is to react to environmental and physiological stress, bind and repair damaged proteins, and re-establish protein homeostasis. High levels of HSPs have been observed in several long-lived animals (Morley and Morimoto 2004; Salway et al. 2011; Singh et al. 2006). This could be due to the enhanced protein repair mechanisms facilitated by increased HSP levels, limiting prolonged cellular damage (Galbadage and Hartman 2008; Heidler et al. 2010; Minois et al. 1999; Salmon et al. 2009; Swindell 2009; Walker and Lithgow 2003; Zhao et al. 2005). Both HSP70 (Beere et al. 2000) and 90 (Pandey et al. 2000) have been shown to inhibit apoptosis by interfering with the formation of the apoptosome, thereby reducing cell death during heat shock (Mosser et al. 1997).",

HSP70 and 90 are also up-regulated during viral infection (Geller et al. 2012; Glotzer et al. 2000; Nagy et al. 2011). It is now well-established that bats are reservoirs for several viruses capable of crossing the species barriers, evident by recent outbreaks of related viruses including Ebola virus (Leroy et al. 2005), SARS coronavirus (Li et al. 2005), MERS coronavirus (Ithete et al. 2013), and directly with Nipah virus (Chua et al. 2002) and Hendra virus (Halpin et al. 2000; Young et al. 1996). These viruses often cause severe morbidity and mortality in incidental mammals, while bats remain clinically asymptomatic upon infection (Storm, 2018 #74; Schuh, 2018 #73; Schuh, 2017 #75). Throughout evolution, bats may have gained novel functions allowing them to coexist with these viruses, thus evading the onset of severe pathology (Wynne et al 2014, Zhang et al. 2017; Zhou et al 2016). HSP70 has been shown to inhibit \u2018cytokine storm\u2019, induced by viruses like SARS (Huang et al. 2005), through binding/degrading the p65 subunit of NF\u03baB, thus reducing overall inflammation and pathology (Tanaka et al. 2014).",

            "text": "Here, we show that bats have elevated expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) in various tissue and cell lines from two species, comparative sequence analysis of HSPs from ten bat species and that increased HSP expression in vitro confers survival of cells during prolonged heat stress. This evolutionary advantage aids in bat physiology, though, and may have considerable impacts on other unique aspects of bat\u2019s longevity and zoonotic potential. The two species characterized include the Australian black flying fox (Pteropus alecto) and the cave nectar bat (Eonycteris spelaea). Both animals are frugivorous in nature, feeding mostly on nectar, flowers, seeds and fruit and are considered long-lived at 19.7 years (670.1 g) and 22 years (58.7 g), respectively (Wilkinson and Adams 2019 #59). These bats are largely data deficient with regard to maximum age, and closely related species are documented with much longer lifespans. Both are in the order Yinpterochiroptera and are considered adept at flying with single-day flight ranges documented of over 40 km (Nowak 1999 #78; Hall 2000 #77). Both species have similar blood glucose levels and respiratory capacity (/body size), suggesting similar metabolism between the two (Maina 1991 #82; Hill 1984 #81; Peng 2017 #79). We hypothesise that higher levels of HSPs allow bats to endure the metabolic stresses induced by high temperatures, presumably that generated by sustained flight, and this alters the ability of bats to survive at these temperatures. This in turn may impact the bat\u2019s lifespan (Podlutsky et al. 2005) and pathogen-host equilibrium as HSPs are involved in both processes (Salmon et al. 2009). The evolutionary conserved function of HSP\u2019s does not appear to be altered, merely the regulation of expression and intrinsic availability.",

All work was done with the ethics approval of National University of Singapore (IACUC Permit # B01/12), and the National Parks permits NP/RP11-011-3a and NP/RP12-004-2. All C57BL/6 mice were healthy, male, 8\u201315 weeks old. Healthy resting, adult, bats were used for E. spelaea tissue, and samples were obtained from 1 female and 2 males, with an average weight of 58 g. Adult Pteropus alecto bats, physically damaged but otherwise healthy, were collected from bat carers around South-East Queensland (Australia), transiently housed and processed at the resting state. Three males and 1 female were used for NGS with an average body weight of 692 g. These weights are close to the expected weights for these species (Wilkinson and Adams 2019 #59). All experiments were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. The generation of PaLuT02 (RRID:CVCL_DR91) and PaKiT03 (RRID:CVCL_DR89) cell lines has been described previously (Crameri et al. 2009). Eonycteris spelaea lung epithelia (EsLuT02) cell line was generated following our previously established method (Crameri et al. 2009) and selected for based on optimum culturing conditions matching those of most mammalian cells. This cell line exhibits a typical doubling time of 2\u20133 days, expresses no detectable HIF1\u03b1, minimal cellular/mitochondrial ROS production, and minimal uptake of trypan blue or PI and has been culture up to at least 70 passages, indicating suitable culturing conditions.

Duck embryo cell-line CCL-141 from Anas platyrhynchus domesticus (RRID:CVCL_T281) was purchased from ATCC and cultured in Eagle\u2019s minimum essential medium (EMEM) (Gibco) with 10% FBS, as recommended. All tissue was preserved in RNALater except for muscle, which was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen then processed with TRIzol directly to preserve the limited RNA amounts. All the tissue samples tested are performed in biological replicates unless otherwise stated. Cell-line studies were performed across multiple passages in separate experiments.",

Prior to treatment, cells were loaded at 37 \u00b0C with Vybrant Cell Metabolic Assay Kit with C12-resazurin (Thermo Fisher Scientific), according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (1:2000), washed twice in PBS and fresh phenol-red free DMEM was added (GIBCO, ThermoScientific). Briefly, the C12-resazurin is converted to a fluorescent by-product by cellular esterases in an ATP-dependent manner, and the fluorescence signal is proportional to the amount of ATP. C12-resazurin by-product was then measured with an excitation/emission maxima of 563/587 nm. Enough un-converted dye is loaded for 24 h of constant imaging accounting for minor bleaching. Fluorescent signal of the converted Resorufin control was the same at 37/40 \u00b0C. Knockdown of HSP90 and HSP70 by siRNAs was performed using RNAiMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with oligos purchased from IDT (Table S4) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. For siRNA knockdown of HSP90, a combination of HSP90AA1and AB1 was used at a ratio of 1:1. Cells were washed twice with PBS to remove excess dye and cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS at 37 \u00b0C and 40 \u00b0C in a Tecan plate reader and detected using Ex/Em at 560 nm/590 nm wavelength. Cell viability was calculated by normalizing against the 2-h time point after the dye had completely stabilized. The cell viability was plotted over time using GraphPad Prism software and a growth/survival (Kaplan-Meier) curve constructed. The significant difference between the different cell growth curves over time was calculated using two-way ANOVA, Bonferroni multiple comparisons.",

As HSP90 involves two different genes (HSP90AA1 and HSP90AB1), we used two qPCR primer sets along with HSP70 (HSPA5) to determine the RNA expression in two bat species, the Singaporean cave nectar bat (Eonycteris spelaea) and the Australian back flying fox (Pteropus alecto). Expression was compared relative to GAPDH, used previously for cross-species/tissue comparison (Ahn 2019 #90; Kosir 2010 #85; Foss 1998 #84; Grant 2009 #83). Inbred (C57BL/6) laboratory mice and wild-captured rats (Asian house rat, Rattus tanezumi) were added for comparison. The additional of a field-captured rodent was to control for any stress response to collection of wild animals and minimize discrepancies between laboratory and wild-caught animals. Tissues tested included heart, lung, spleen, kidney, muscle, brain, liver, intestine, wing and lymph node, collected during the resting state, depending on availability in each species. As shown in Fig. 1f, g, we found that E. spelaea, in most tissues, has a significantly higher level of HSP90AA1, HSP90AB and HSP70 compared to rodents. P. alecto also has significantly higher levels of HSP90AA1 and HSP70, with a trend for HSP90AB1 that did not reach significance (p = 0.06). Figure 1i shows a cumulative average of the tissues of each species for each gene. All three HSPs are highly expressed in the lung tissues of both E. spelaea and P. alecto (and liver for E. spelaea) compared to those in mice and rats (Fig. 1f\u2013h).",

Similar observations were found in lung-derived cells, as shown in Fig. 2f\u2013i.

While several elements are missing, or exhibiting lower sequence identity, in the P. alecto (Pa) HSPA5 (Fig. 3f) promoter compared to human, the majority of elements are conserved. There are no obvious additions with new promoter elements/transcription factor (TF) binding sites visible in the PaHSPA5 promoter. Of note, the identity/frequency increased for NFYA/CAAT and MZF1-binding sites. Taken together with higher expression of these TFs in the liver, this correlates with higher expression of HSPA5 in bat liver. It is worth to note that in the PaKi and PaLu cell lines, the expression of most known HSP promoter TFs does not correlate with the high expression of HSP70/90, particularly in comparison to HEK93, which expresses high levels of HSP\u2019s concurrent with high levels of most HSF TFs. Table S3 includes NGS FPKM values of HSP genes, TFs and housekeeping genes from PakiT03, PaLu and HEK293 for comparison.

While CrispR-Cas9 can be used in PakiT03 cells, knockdown of HSP90 and HSP70 families via CrispR proved non-viable, likely due to the essential nature of HSPs. However, PaKiT03 and PaLu cells with HSP90 and HSP70 knocked down by siRNA showed minimal signs of abnormal growth (Fig. 4a, b) or morphological change at 37 \u00b0C compared to non-silencing (NS) control siRNA. In contrast, when treated for 24 h at 40 \u00b0C, neither HSP knockdown treatments survived with PaKiT03 or PaLu cells. The control-treatment cells survived and continued to proliferate (Fig. 4c, d).

P. alecto expressed higher levels of HSP70 and 90 compared to Chalcophaps indica (emerald dove) and Treron vernans (pink-necked green pigeon) (Fig. 4f). The protein levels of HSP70 and 90 in an avian cell line (CCL-141, Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) were also significantly lower compared to PakiT03 (Fig. 4g, h), though albeit than previously examined cells. As we believe high basal HSP expression is a bat-specific adaptation to heat stress, CCL-141 was subsequently cultured at 37 \u00b0C and 40 \u00b0C to examine its resistance to heat stress. While CCL-141 continued to grow at 37 \u00b0C, the duck cells stopped growing or dividing at 40 \u00b0C and maintained a constant viability, possibly senescence (Fig. 4i).",

Knockdown of either HSP70 or HSP90 in PaKiT03 cells demonstrated a reduction in cell confluency as assessed via phase-contrast microscopy 72 h after 1 mM spermine NONOate removal (Fig. S2). In addition, using PI exclusion for viability, we observed significant reduction in the percentage of viable PaKiT03 cells in the presence of HSP70 knockdown for all spermine NONOate concentrations and with 0.1 and 0.25 mM concentrations for HSP90 treatment (Fig. 4j). High doses of spermine NONOate decreased the number of viable cells even in control cells.

Recent comparative genomics studies have confirmed that bats are different to all other mammalian groups (Ahn et al. 2016; Ng et al. 2016; Zhang et al. 2013; Zhou et al. 2014). However, it is extremely difficult to pinpoint major genetic adaptations to explain why bats have a relatively longer lifespan or to their apparent reservoir host potential. The adaptations required to sustain a high rate of metabolism and high body temperature during daily flight may provide insight. While proving high basal HSP expression of bats is an adaptive evolution from flight is not possible without a non-flying bat species for comparison, we speculate that this high expression pattern of HSPs in bats is likely an adaptation to cope with both high heat and metabolic stress.",

Additionally, the liver of animals exhibited increased expression of other HSP families including HSP40 (DNAJA1) and HSP60 (HSPD1). Salway et al. (Salway et al. 2011) previously reported that there is a positive correlation between lifespan and the level of HSP expression in animals. In our studies, we have demonstrated that the expression levels of HSP90 and HSP70 are significantly higher than those in the tissue of pigeon, duck, mouse, rat and human and in cell lines of human, dog, hamster and duck origin. This is especially true for HSP70 (HSPA5), which has a 10-fold higher level of expression in bats compared to rodents. A comparison to smaller bats with exceptional longevity quotients would be required for a correlation of HSP expression to lifespan in bats. In comparison with other flying animals, pigeon and duck have lower levels of HSP70 and 90 compared to P. alecto. This suggests that while birds still increase their core body temperature (McNab 1966) during flight, HSP expression is not be the main protective effector in birds. This suggests that high basal HSP expression is a bat-specific phenomenon. The levels we observed in pigeon and duck are comparable to the study of finches from Salway et al. (Salway et al. 2011). This was partially confirmed by the HSP expression in CCL-141 duck cells failing to confer the resistance to heat stress observed in multiple bat cells. Other primary avian cells have been reported to survive at 40 \u00b0C, presumably through HSP-independent mechanisms (Harper, 2011 #88).",

It has previously been shown that there is a disconnection between cross-species sequence homology and expression levels in the oriental fruit moth (Zhang et al. 2016). This highlights that altering expression of HSPs rather than altering the function of HSPs still confers a phenotypic advantage. This may be the case in other species, such as the bat. Further annotation and sequencing data from available bat genomes will allow a full phylogeny-independent characterization of all HSP genes from bats, though our preliminary indicates that HSP function is not altered.",

While caution must be used when using algorithms designed against human on bat transcription factors (TFs), there was an increased number of binding sites above the threshold for the NFYA/CAAT DNA-binding elements and also MZF1. Both of which show higher expression in the liver tissue of both bat species compared to mouse and human. Additionally, there is a 150-bp gap in the genome for the P. alecto promoter, which may mask other binding elements. Intriguingly, HSP expression in bats has been linked to hibernation with increased HSP70 and HSP90 expression observed during Torpor (Zhang et al. 2013). While the species investigated here are not known for hibernation, partial torpor is recorded in most fruit bat species along with resting bradycardia during flight (O'Mara et al. 2017) that resembles partial torpor. This may highlight evolutionary conserved pathways for thermos regulation in bats leading to higher expression of HSPs. Indeed, NFYA, a known regulator of HSP 70/90 and a TF expressed higher in bats (Fig. 4d), has also been implicated in torpor (Han et al. 2015). Other additional elements compared to human included GATA, NFAT, ELK1/Ets and MYB binding sites, though these had lower binding scores. A full functional analysis of the promoter elements for each HSP gene in better annotated genomes and the binding capacity of each TF would be required to clarify this alternative, HSF-independent, expression of HSPs in bats.",

That bat cells were no longer able to grow at 40 \u00b0C when either HSP70 or HSP90 was abolished by siRNA and highlights their role in endurance of heat-induced stress in bat cells, whether related to flight or independent. This high base level in vitro confers basal thermo-tolerance. This confirms the known classical function of HSP for resistance to heat-induced apoptosis or cell death (Mosser et al. 1997), largely due to HSP70\u2019s ability to bind Apf-1 and prevent recruitment of caspases for the formation of the apoptosome complex (Beere et al. 2000).",

The little brown bat Myotis lucifugus, with an estimated lifespan of 34 years (AnAge, http://genomics.senescence.info/species/), can reduce free radicals in their bodies (Brunet-Rossinni 2004). Due to the wide-ranging tissue expression, the role of HSPs in the general protein homeostasis in bats must be considered, along with any possible implication for reduced ageing. This notion is also supported by two recently published studies on the long-lived naked mole rat. While HSPs were highly conserved to other mammals, they observed reduced protein degradation and unfolding despite increased oxidative stress (Perez et al. 2009). Another recent study observed a higher level of HSP70 and HSP25 in the naked mole rat (Rodriguez et al. 2016) possibly enhancing protein repair and reducing cellular damage.",

HSP70 can promote Ebola virus replication (Shurtleff et al. 2014). Nipah virus has been shown to utilize HSP90 for chaperoning viral L polymerase (Bloyet et al. 2016), and Dengue virus (DENV) uses HSP70 and HSP90 as alternative receptors for viral entry (Reyes-del Valle et al. 2005). HSP expression also affected the mutation rate/genetic diversity of influenza viruses (Phillips et al. 2017). The basal expression level of several HSP genes is genetically imprinted in vivo in live animal-derived tissues from two species of bat, with cultured cell lines displaying the same high expression. This is required for bat cells to sustain prolonged heat stress and affects their response to oxidative stress. Together with published literature linking high HSP expression level with long lifespan and promotion of virus entry and/or replication, this speculatively links the two most fascinating features of bat biology, i.e. longer lifespan and an exceptional ability as a zoonotic host.",
