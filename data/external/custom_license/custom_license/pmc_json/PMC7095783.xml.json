But a possible second receptor, CD209L (L-SIGN) has also been identified from in vitro studies15. Thus, it was not known whether ACE2 is indeed crucial for SARS-CoV infections in vivo. To address this question genetically, we infected Ace2 knockout16 and control wild-type mice with SARS-CoV. As reported previously17, SARS-CoV infections of wild-type mice result in viral replication in the lungs and the recovery of large amounts (>107 the tissue culture\u2013infectious dose, which will infect 50% of the cell monolayers (TCID50T) per gram lung tissue) of infectious virus (Fig. 1a). In Ace2 knockout mice, only a very low quantity of infectious SARS-CoV virus could be recovered (<102 TCID50 per gram lung tissue; Fig. 1a), and the copy numbers of SARS-CoV Spike RNA were greatly reduced (Fig. 1b). SARS-CoV infection of mice is associated with the development of mild pathological changes in the lungs (Fig. 1c,d). Moreover, pathologic alterations in lungs were reduced in Ace2 mutant mice compared to wild-type mice (Fig. 1c,d). These data provide the first genetic proof that ACE2 is indeed a crucial in vivo SARS receptor required for effective replication of infectious SARS-CoV.",

            "text": "We have recently shown that the renin-angiotensin system has a crucial role in severe acute lung injury and that the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 has a protective role in acute lung failure18 (Fig. 2a). Notably, experimental SARS-CoV infections of wild-type mice in vivo resulted in considerably reduced ACE2 expression in the lungs (Fig. 2b) suggesting that reduced ACE2 expression might have a role in SARS-CoV\u2013mediated severe acute lung pathologies. By contrast, ACE lung expression levels were not overtly changed in SARS-CoV\u2013infected mice (Fig. 2b). We therefore speculated that SARS-CoV might affect lung pathologies through ACE2. To test this idea, we established a defined model system using recombinant SARS-CoV surface-Spike protein, which is the essential ligand for ACE2 binding14. This model system allowed us to avoid possible secondary effects resulting from viral replication or infections in vivo and to directly test whether SARS-CoV Spike protein might adversely affect acute lung injury through modulation of ACE2.",

Our recombinant Spike-Fc protein indeed pulled down both human and mouse ACE2 (Fig. 2c). SARS-CoV Spike-Fc binding to human and mouse ACE2 was confirmed by FACS binding assays of Spike-Fc to 293 cells overexpressing human or mouse ACE2 (Fig. 2d). Moreover, Spike-Fc bound to endogenous ACE2 in Vero E6 cells (Fig. 2e). Notably, binding of Spike-Fc to endogenous ACE2 in Vero E6 cells resulted in downregulation of ACE2 surface expression (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Fig. 1 online). Spike-Fc also decreased surface levels of human and mouse ACE2 overexpressed in 293 cells (not shown) and triggered syncytia formation of mouse ACE2-transfected but not control CD4-transfected 293 cells (data not shown). Thus, analogous to other virus-receptor interactions19, SARS-CoV Spike protein binding to ACE2 in cell lines or SARS-CoV infections in vivo results in reduced ACE2 protein expression.",

Notably, treatment with Spike-Fc protein worsened the lung function in wild-type mice, whereas control-Fc protein showed no apparent effects (Fig. 3a). Moreover, Spike-Fc treatment of acid-challenged wild-type mice augmented the pathological changes in the lung parenchyma (Fig. 3b,c and Supplementary Table 1 online) and increased lung edemas as defined by a wet/dry lung weight ratios (Fig. 3d). We next made a Spike-deletion mutant that only contained the previously mapped ACE2-binding domain (amino acids 318\u2013510)21 fused to human Fc (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Fig. 1 online). This short Spike(S318-510)-Fc protein containing the minimal ACE2 binding site also binds to ACE2 in cell lines using FACS assays and downmodulates the cell-surface expression of ACE2 (Supplementary Fig. 1 online). Treatment with Spike(S318-510)-Fc again worsened acid-induced acute lung injury in wild-type mice (Fig. 3e). Notably, in vivo Spike-Fc protein administration did not affect the severity of lung failure in Ace2 knockout mice (Fig. 3f), indicating that the effect of Spike protein on acute lung injury is ACE2 specific.",

In addition, using immunohistochemistry, we found that Spike-Fc protein localized to bronchial epithelial cells, inflammatory exudates and alveolar pneumocytes (Fig. 4b). Notably, Spike-Fc primarily localized to severe lesions (Fig. 4b). This localization of Spike-Fc protein is similar to Spike antigen staining in SARS-CoV\u2013infected mice22. Spike-Fc treatment resulted in downregulation of ACE2 protein expression in lungs of acid-treated wild-type mice in vivo (Fig. 4c), consistent with ACE2 protein downregulation in SARS-CoV\u2013infected mice (Fig. 2a) and Spike-Fc protein\u2013treated cells in vitro (Fig. 2e). These results show that the SARS-CoV Spike protein can directly affect the development of severe acute lung failure through ACE2.",

The ACE2 homologue ACE, by contrast, cleaves the decapeptide AngI into the octapeptide AngII25. Thus, ACE2 counterbalances the function of ACE and negatively regulates AngII production (Fig. 2a). To test whether Spike-Fc injections indeed affect the function of the renin-angiotensin system, we analyzed AngII levels in the lungs of acid- and Spike-Fc\u2013treated mice. Acid aspiration increased AngII levels in the lungs of wild-type mice. Notably, we observed a further, significant increase in AngII levels in the lung tissue of mice treated with Spike-Fc (Fig. 4d). To confirm whether Spike-Fc promotes lung disease pathogenesis through increased AngII production and functional alterations of the renin-angiotensin system, we blocked the AngII receptor type 1 (AT1R)26 with a specific inhibitor. The AT1R is the crucial receptor that mediates AngII-induced vascular permeability and severe acute lung injury18. Inhibition of the AT1R indeed attenuated acute severe lung injury in Spike-Fc\u2013treated mice (Fig. 4e). Inhibition of the AT1R also attenuated pulmonary edema (Fig. 4f). Taken together, our data show that SARS-CoV Spike can exaggerate acute lung failure through deregulation of the renin-angiotensin system. Moreover, SARS-CoV Spike\u2013mediated lung failure can be rescued by inhibition of AT1R.",
