            "text": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible, affects approximately 210 million people worldwide and is currently a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide [1\u20134]. Inflammation and remodeling of the small airways are major determinants for the progression and severity of COPD, as defined by the decline in FEV1[5]. The airway inflammation in COPD is generally described as neutrophilic. Several immune cells, proinflammatory chemokines, and cytokines extensively participate in the induction and maintenance of the inflammatory response in the airway [6]. The chemokine CXCL8 (also referred to as interleukin-8), which is secreted from the leukocytic cells (monocytes, T cells, neutrophils, and natural killer cells) and other cells such as epithelial cells and fibroblasts [7], has a well documented role in the pathogenesis and maintenance of airway inflammation in COPD.",

CXCL8 production is not constitutive, but is inducible by proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 [8], bacteria and virus and their products [7,10], and several environmental factors such as hypoxic conditions [11]. Two distinct G-protein-coupled receptors \u2013 CXCR1 and CXCR2 \u2013 exist for CXCL8 in humans and rodents [12,13]. The primary function of CXCL8 is the induction of chemotaxis in its target cells, especially neutrophils and lymphocytes [10], which involves G\u03b2\u03b3 subunit-activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-\u03b3 and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) signaling [14,15]. CXCL8 also induces upsurge of cytosolic calcium, which is essential for exocytosis (e.g. mediator release), and respiratory burst [7,10]. Numerous previous studies have suggested the critical role of CXCL8 in the induction and maintenance of airway inflammation in the rodent model and in clinical patients with COPD.",

One of these, the p38 MAPK pathway, is activated by cellular stress and regulates the expression of inflammatory cytokines, including CXCL8, TNF-\u03b1 and MMPs [16]. Four isoforms of p38 MAPK family (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, and \u03b4) exist. Usually, p38 MAPKs are activated by phosphorylation on Thr180 and Tyr182 in the Thr-Gly-Tyr motif of the activation loop by upstream MAPK kinases MKK3 and MKK6, which are in turn activated by the MAPK kinase kinases (MEKK). Once activated, p38 MAPKs effectively act on several downstream kinases, such as MAPK-activated protein kinase (MAPKAPK2/3), and eventually influence the function of some transcription factors, cytoskeletal proteins and translational components, and other enzymes [17].",

Suppression the activity of p38-\u03b1 isoform with inhibitor SD-282 effectively decreased TNF-\u03b1 release from human lung macrophages in vitro[19] and attenuated inflammation in a smoking model of COPD in mice [20]. Previously, it was reported that p38\u03b1 is involved in the migration of neutrophils and other inflammatory cells [17].

It was previously reported that p38\u03b1 critically participates in the migration of neutrophils, mast cells, and eosinophils induced by several proinflammatory factors [17,41]. Inhibiting activities of p38 MAPK \u03b1 and \u03b2 isoform with selective inhibitor SD282 significantly suppressed subchronic tobacco smoke-induced macrophages and neutrophils and cytokine synthesis in murine lung [20]. Transient or long-term administration of the p38\u03b1 inhibitor SB681323 significantly decreased the levels of p-HSP27 and TNF-\u03b1 in whole blood and sputum neutrophils, indicating a remarkable reduction of airway inflammation [17,42\u201344] in patients with COPD. These studies suggest the pivotal role of p38 MAPK in the induction of airway inflammation in COPD patients, probably through CXCL8 signaling [6,45,46].",

Presence of airflow obstruction, defined as the decreased FEV1%, is essential in diagnosing COPD in clinical patients [47]. An immunostaining study revealed an inverse correlation between phospho-p38 MAPK-positive alveolar macrophages and FEV1% in COPD patients [18]. Inhibition of p38 activity for 4 weeks significantly improved the lung function in COPD patients [17,48]. These findings suggest that p38 MAPK is a critical factor in devastation of lung function through the induction of airway inflammation via CXCL8 signaling in patients with COPD.",
