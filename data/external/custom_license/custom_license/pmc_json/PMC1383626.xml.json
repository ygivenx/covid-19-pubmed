            "text": "In all organisms, accurate transfer of genetic information is critical for maintaining their genetic traits. During translation, universal decoding rules would be prevailing and guarantee correct decoding of the genetic code. However, cells do evolve various translational recoding mechanisms to interpret the genetic code in alternative ways. Programmed ribosomal frameshifting is one of these recoding mechanisms. This mechanistically diverse process is well characterized in retrotransposons (1,2), bacteria (3\u20135), insects (6), animals (7) and animal viruses (8\u201311). Generally, the ribosome can shift its frame during translation elongation either in the forward (3\u2032) or backward (5\u2032) direction, causing +1 or \u22121 frameshifting. A \u22121 frameshift event takes place in most cases, such as the gag-pol gene of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (12), the 1a/1b gene of coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) (9) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (8,13). Examples of +1 frameshifting include GAG3 and POL3 (GAG3-POL3) genes of the retrotransposon Ty3 of yeast (2), the mammalian ornithine decarboxylase antizyme (7) and the thymidine kinase (TK) gene of herpes simplex virus (HSV) (14).",

The 1ab polyprotein is translated by a ribosomal frameshifting mechanism, and is a fusion product of ORF 1a and 1b. Through sequence alignment and comparison, a conserved slippery sequence (U UUA AAC) was identified in the 1a/1b region as the slippage site. Evidence provided by Baranov et al. (8) confirmed that a \u22121 frameshift event did occur during translation of the region. More recently, an atypical RNA pseudoknot and an upstream attenuation signal were shown to regulate this \u22121 ribosomal frameshift event (8,16). So far, no other frameshifting signal was identified in any other genes from SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses.",

SARS-CoV ORF 3a encodes a protein of 274 amino acids. Recent studies demonstrated that 3a protein is a minor structural protein and is associated with the spike protein in virions (17\u201320). During the course of cloning and expression of ORF 3a, a mixed population of clones with six, seven, eight and nine T stretches located 14 nt downstream of the initiation codon was found. The existence of these ORF 3a variants was confirmed recently by isolation of a heterogeneous population of subgenomic mRNA three transcripts with six, seven, eight and nine Us from the sera of SARS patients (21). Evidence provided here demonstrates that the seven and eight U stretches could function as sole elements for efficient +1 and \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting during translation of these ORF 3a variants. This report demonstrates a sole requirement of hepta- and octo-uridine as signals for efficient frameshifting during expression of authentic viral genes and reinforces the conclusion drawn by Brierley et al. (10), based on mutagenesis studies, that U stretches in mRNA are particularly slippery compared with other monotonous runs of nucleotides.",

In vitro expression of pSARS-3a/6T in the transcription coupled translation reticulocyte lysate system showed the detection of a dominant product of \u223c31 kDa, representing the full-length 3a protein (Figure 1b, lane 1). In addition, a minor band (3a*) of \u223c27 kDa was expressed, which represents the initiated product from an internal AUG (22). Interestingly, the 31 kDa full-length 3a protein was also detected when constructs pSARS-3a/7T and pSARS-3a/8T were expressed in the same in vitro expression system (Figure 1b, lanes 2 and 3). The efficiencies of the 31 kDa 3a protein expressed from these two constructs are \u223c32 and 20%, respectively, compared with that expressed from pSARS-3a/6T (Figure 1b, lanes 1\u20133). These results reveal that frameshift events may occur during translation of ORF 3a variants with seven and eight Us.",

Replacement of the original slippage site (T TTA AAC) with eight Ts in pF-S1ab/8T produced two products similar to the two proteins produced from the construct with the original slippage site (Figure 4c, lane 3). In construct pF-S1ab/7T, the original slippery sequence was replaced by seven Ts, resulting in the fusion of ORF 1a and 1b (Figure 4a). The termination product therefore contains both the 1a and 1b regions and is similar to the frameshifting product expressed from pF-S1ab and pF-S1ab/8T (Figure 4a). The putative +1 frameshifting product was expected to terminate at the original TAA codon for ORF 1a, which is equivalent to the 1a termination product expressed from pF-S1ab and pF-S1ab/8T (Figure 4a).

Mutations of stem II were then carried out based on pF-S1ab, pF-S1ab/7T and pF-S1ab/8T, giving rise to constructs pF-S1abM, pF-S1ab/7TM and pF-S1ab/8TM, respectively (Figure 5a).

Expression of pF-S1abM showed the detection of a similar amount of the 1a termination product (Figure 5b, lane 2). However, the 50 kDa frameshifting product was not observed (Figure 5b, lane 2). These results confirm that mutations introduced into stem II abolish the frameshift event.

Expression of clones with six, seven and eight Ts in an in vitro expression system, bacteria and in intact cells showed detection of the full-length 3a protein. To study the mechanisms that control the expression of the full-length 3a protein from clones with seven and eight Ts, site-directed mutagenesis was carried out based on the construct with seven Ts (TTT TTT TA). The results showed that mutation of any T in the TTT TTT TA significantly reduced the expression of the full-length 3a protein. However, mutation of the nucleotide A immediately downstream of the seven T stretch did not affect the 3a expression, suggesting that the full-length 3a protein is expressed by a +1/\u22122 frameshifting mechanism and the UUU UUU U is the slippage site. Attempts were subsequently made to identify upstream and downstream regulatory elements by deletion analysis. Neither downstream stem\u2013loop structures and pseudoknots, nor upstream sequences with stimulatory function were identified, suggesting that the hepta- and octo-uridine stretches could function as sole elements for efficient ribosomal frameshifting. This possibility was further confirmed by insertion of seven Ts into the coding region of luciferase gene and by replacement of the slippery sequence of SARS-CoV ORF 1a and 1b with seven and eight Ts. Moreover, mutations introduced into stem II of the SARS-CoV ORF 1b region totally abolished frameshifting mediated by the original slippery sequence of SARS-CoV ORF 1a and 1b, but did not affect frameshifting mediated by the seven or eight U stretches. Taken together, this study demonstrates that the hepta- and octo-uridine stretches are sole elements for efficient programmed ribosomal frameshift events.",

At present, we do not know exactly whether +1 or \u22122 frameshifting occurs. Attempts were made to purify the frameshifting products from various expression systems and to determine the precise sequence across the slippage site, but without success. Generally, +1 frameshifting is considered the main event taking place at the slippage site since the phenylalanine tRNAGAA could form perfect pairing in the +1 frame with UUU, but only one base pairing could form in the \u22122 frame with GAU. Another interesting question is whether the putative +1 frameshifting at the seven U stretch requires ribosomal slippage at both P and A sites. Mutations introduced into the slippery sequence in pF-3a/M1, M2, M3 and M4 would make imperfect pairs at the P site if +1 frameshifting occurs, resulting in the decrease of the frameshifting efficiency. In mutant pF-3a/M5, M6 and M7, perfect base pairs were maintained at the P site in the event of +1 frameshifting. As the expression of the full-length 3a protein was significantly reduced when these mutant constructs were expressed, it suggests that re-pairing at the A site was not successful, resulting in the reduction of the frameshifting efficiency. Based on these observations, it would be reasonable to conclude that a double slippage mechanism is responsible for this frameshift event, and exact base pairing is required. At present, however, we cannot rule out the possibility that a slippage-independent mechanism, such as GAG3-POL3 genes of yeast Ty3 that are dependent on slow decoding of certain codons, while not involving peptidyl-tRNA slippage (2,23), and the mammalian ornithine decarboxylase antizyme frameshift event in which a slippage was not necessary as shown by mutagenesis studies (7), could account for this frameshift event.",

Mutations that destroyed the downstream stimulatory structure did not alter/reverse the frameshifting efficiency of the two constructs, suggesting that either additional sequences located in the region or long range RNA interaction may favor \u22121 frameshifting.",

            "text": "In addition to the slippery sequence, the majority of the known frameshifting signals also contain a stimulatory element. In some cases, a secondary structure or tertiary interaction, such as a pseudoknot structure downstream of the slippage site, could significantly increase the frameshifting efficiency. In other cases, sequence specific elements, such as the Shine\u2013Dalgarno (24,25) or sequences partially complementary with yeast 18S rRNA (26), are required. Furthermore, space between the slippage site and the stimulatory element, especially the downstream secondary structure, also plays a critical regulatory role in the frameshifting efficiency (24). Although certain stem\u2013loop structures and potential pseudoknot interaction downstream of the slippage site in ORF 3a variants may be formed, deletion of sequence within 100 nt downstream of the U stretch showed that these potential structural elements did not affect the seven U stretch-mediated frameshifting, indicating that either long-range RNA interaction may play a role or stimulatory elements may be dispensable for these frameshifting events. However, the fact that frameshifting was still efficient in other ORF context, such as the luciferase gene, argues against the first possibility. This conclusion was reinforced by the observation that mutation of stem II in the SARS-CoV 1a/1b region totally abolished the frameshift event mediated by the original slippery sequence of ORF 1a and 1b, but rendered no effect on the frameshift event mediated either by the seven Us or the eight Us. Previously, a G-rich sequence was reported to induce net +1 frameshift in HSV TK gene (14). In this case, the frameshifting efficiency was not augmented by downstream structures and ribosomal pausing (14). A recent report also showed that ribosomal pausing had little correlation with the frameshifting efficiency (27).",

During transcription of homopolymeric DNA templates, DNA-dependent RNA polymerase could slip and insert non-templated nucleotide(s) into the growing RNA chain. Examples include the expression of dnaX in Thermus thermophilus (28) and bacterial IS elements (29). In this study, we show no deletion or revision of the mutations in the seven T regions during transcription of wild type and mutant constructs, arguing against the possibility that transcriptional slippage may play a role in the expression of the ORF3a variant with seven Us.
