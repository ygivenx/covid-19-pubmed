            "text": "The contribution of respiratory viruses to hospitalisation of children is often unclear. Viral emergence varies on a seasonal and annual basis, and the exact demographic characteristics of children affected are often unknown. Moreover, many viral infections are missed during routine laboratory diagnosis due to the poor quality of many clinical specimens, the lack of sensitivity of rapid antigen detection tests, and the prohibitively high cost of reverse transcriptase-PCR methods, which limits their use. The very high sensitivity of PCR methods is problematic because it is difficult to distinguish between residual genetic material from previous infections and the replicating viruses in an acute infection. Thus, nucleic acid detection methods, when used alone, may be difficult to interpret in cases of dual or multiple infections. Recent publications have shown that respiratory viruses may persist, without causing symptoms, for prolonged periods of time in the nasopharyngeal tract; in addition, noninfective viral nucleic acids from rhinovirus or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) can be detected in humans or animal models for up to several months after infection [1, 2].",

HEp-2 laryngeal carcinoma cells, which, according to ATCC genetic analyses are contaminated by HeLa cells, also support the growth of adenoviruses, RSV, and some rhinoviruses, although rhinoviruses were not targeted in this study. The MA-104 line, which, according to recent genetic analysis at the ATCC, is a mixture of rhesus monkey kidney and African green monkey kidney cells, was chosen due its proven capability to grow parainfluenza viruses, SARS coronavirus, avian pneumoviruses, and a broad range of enteric viruses.",

A PCR protocol suitable for detection of Mimiviridae in respiratory samples was kindly provided by D. Raoult, Marseille, France. To avoid specimen contamination during detection of such a rare pathogen, a \u201csuicide PCR\u201d protocol was used, which was described previously by the same group for detection of Yersinia pestis, the agent of medieval black death [11]. In the suicide PCR, primers are used only once, and there are no positive controls introduced into the laboratory. A negative test result is followed by a new test using other primers; a positive result is followed by sequencing. Although this procedure restricts sensitivity of detection of mimivirus to a certain extent, it provides absolute specificity by avoiding cross-contamination [7].",

In contrast, RSV was also detected throughout the influenza A period, yet in the particular year studied, no pronounced RSV epidemic was observed in our patients. This is probably due to the low birth rate, which results in sufficient numbers of susceptible individuals necessary for efficient transmission kinetics only every 2\u20133 years. In contrast, in countries with higher birth rates, strong RSV outbreaks seem to occur on an annual basis, with numbers of cases far exceeding the hMPV cases [12]. Furthermore, the relatively low overall population density and rural character of our region may play a role, since increases in the incidence of RSV and influenza A virus have been correlated with urbanisation in long-term epidemiological surveys [13].",

The very few isolations of hMPV in this time period were obtained in our laboratory from adult lung transplant patients only. In these immunocompromised patients, prolonged persistence of hMPV is observed, and a different virus subtype has even been sequenced in the interepidemic time period [14]. The latter finding could be an indication for independently transmitted hMPV strains within the hospital environment (nosocomial infections?), which, in adult transplant patients, may lead to rather severe sequelae [14].",

Whether this might indicate similar physico/chemical properties of the two viruses and/or comparable means of transmission remains to be clarified. As most of the dual infections observed were a combination of PIV1 and hMPV, one could also speculate that a possible synergy between these viruses might exist, leading to cocirculation in the community. Some investigators, who have reported the frequent detection of hMPV in combination with the SARS virus, have recently proposed such a concept [8]. hMPV coinfection was suspected to enhance the early transmission of the less contagious coronavirus, thus contributing to the development of so-called \u201csuperspreaders\u201d [15].",

In a recent multicentre study in Germany, K\u00f6nig et al. [5] reported that only 1% of all hMPV infections were observed in children who did not require ICU support, yet among children in the ICU, hMPV was detected in 30%, with an impressive 60% of hMPV infections being associated with RSV infection. The relatively low number of RSV dual infections in our study could also be due to the reduced sensitivity of the commercial RSV antigen detection test as compared to PCR methods, but the data are difficult to compare because the K\u00f6nig study, in contrast to ours, did not target actively replicating virus but instead detected nucleic acid material in nasopharyngeal samples directly. Thus, the amplification of residual genetic material from previous infections remains an obstacle when interpreting the results of highly sensitive PCR methods [1, 2]. Since the majority of hMPV isolations in our study were not coinfections with other viruses and the overall number of hospitalised children in whom hMPV was the only virus detected was relatively high (14%), we do not have any reason to assume that this particular hMPV strain is less virulent than RSV. However, recent data suggests that, in Italy, RSV is associated with higher hospitalisation rates than hMPV [3]. In addition, a significantly longer duration of symptoms has been reported for RSV compared with hMPV [4].",

Since mimiviruses also were not detected in several samples of amoebae-containing water obtained from water tanks, one can assume that this particular virus subtype is either not highly abundant or is subject to regional variances in prevalence that have not yet been studied.
