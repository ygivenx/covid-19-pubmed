The reason for the delay was a growing fear of smallpox as a bioweapon in a world no longer vaccinated against the disease, for routine smallpox vaccinations had been stopped after eradication had been achieved. Therefore, WHO members agreed to a smallpox research plan [35].",

Epidemiological findings indicated that these cases of inhalational anthrax most likely occurred through aerosols generated when opening or processing letters containing B. anthracis powder. There is some evidence that these attacks may have been carried out by a US scientist, although their exact background and circumstances remain officially unresolved until now. They resulted in 22 people developing anthrax, 11 of whom suffered the pulmonary form and of whom 5 died [17].",

Preparations were made for such a program, such as training of medical staff to conduct the vaccinations, etc. Compared to other vaccines currently in routine use, smallpox vaccination using vaccinia virus entails a considerable rate of side effects. Based on previous experiences, 1 in 1,000 vaccinees will develop a serious illness requiring symptomatic medical treatment, and there will be about 30 cases of permanent damage and 1\u20132 deaths per million vaccinees [10, 15]. In addition, it is likely that during a mass vaccination program, some individuals, who have unrecognized contraindications, will receive the vaccination, increasing the rate of complications further. Transmission of the vaccinia virus to contacts with or without contraindications is another risk.",

Due to the high infectiousness of many potential bioweapon agents, all handling and manipulation would have to be done under Biosafety Level 3 (BSL 3) or BSL 4 conditions to protect the handlers [36].",

Particularly categories B and C may be of interest to bioterrorists, due to the fact that some of these agents are not as infectious as those in category A and that dealing with them is, therefore, much easier. For example, multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis is relatively easy to cultivate at a relatively low biohazard level, and with its incubation period between weeks and years it would be very difficult for public health systems to realize that a large number of patients were the result of a bioweapon attack. However, the insidious course might compromise its terrorising effect. On the other hand, Marburg or Ebola viruses are, despite their fearsome reputation, rather unsuitable, not only because those involved in their propagation are likely to succumb to them before achieving their goals, but also because of their low ability to survive outside the human body. Efforts are underway to develop refined methods for assessing the suitability of biological agents as bioweapons [6].",

With the advent of recombinant DNA technology, however, researchers have techniques at their disposal for altering an organism\u2019s genetic makeup and thus biological properties. This might allow enhancing the usability of \u201ctraditional\u201d biological warfare agents [31]. Therefore, genetically modified bioweapon agents have been classified as a separate category (advanced biological warfare agents, ABW) [25]. In addition to increasing a pathogen\u2019s virulence [23], its ability to survive under different environmental conditions such as high temperature, ultraviolet radiation and desiccation could potentially be improved (Table 2); by enhancing dissemination, this might make some hitherto rather unsuitable candidate agents such as filoviruses more likely to be utilized.",

While the above-mentioned unwanted side effects were acceptable when there was still the danger of a smallpox epidemic, this is no longer true after its eradication.
