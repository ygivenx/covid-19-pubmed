Three species of Cryptosporidium have been associated with infection in cattle. Two small-type oocysts, C. parvum and Cryptosporidium bovis (Fayer et al. 2005), infect the small intestine. However, the larger type, Cryptosporidium andersoni that infects the abomasum has been implicated as a cause of reduced milk production in diary cattle (Lindsay et al. 2000).",

However, cryptosporidiosis should not only be considered from the perspective of animal health and production; its zoonotic character and the possibility that animals may act as a source of infection to humans, via foodstuff and water, should also be considered. Although the infection leads to few deaths, serious economic losses can occur due to costs involved in the treatment (de Graaf et al. 1999). Single infection with C. parvum is usually present in diarrheic calves; however, mixed infection with other pathogens exaggerates the problem (Vanopdenbosch et al. 1979).",

            "text": "Treatment of cryptosporidiosis is not effective in cattle. So, control measures are mainly based on preventive measures rather than treatment (Woods et al. 1996). However, halofuginone lactate was found to have anticryptosporidial effect (Jarvie et al. 2005; Klein 2007). Furthermore, Cryptosporidium oocysts are resistant to the commonly used disinfectant at recommended concentrations (Campbell et al. 1982). It is necessary to find management approaches to minimize the risk of infection with cryptosporidiosis. Cryptosporidiosis in water buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) received great interest in different localities of the world (Galiero et al. 1994; Dubey et al. 1992; Rinaldi et al. 2007). In Egypt, studies limited to the prevalence and zoonotic aspects of the disease were done (Iskander et al. 1987; El-Sherif et al. 2000; El-Dessouky and El-Masry 2005; El-Sherbini and Mohammad 2006). The prevalence of cryptosporidiosis was also mentioned in African buffaloes (Syncerus caffer) among wildlife animals in Tanzania (Mtambo et al. 1997). However, the risk factors concerned with cryptosporidiosis in buffalo calves have not been described. Consequently, the objective of the present study was to determine the prevalence and determinants (risk factors) of cryptosporidiosis in buffalo calves in Middle Egypt.",

However, the independent variables were the hypothesized risk factors. Variables with significance at P < 0.1 were selected for further multivariate logistic regression model. Hosmer and Lemeshow\u2019s goodness of fit statistic test greater than 0.05 was used to imply that the model\u2019s estimates fit the data at an acceptable level in multivariate analysis. The results were each expressed as P value and odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI 95%). A chi-square (\u03c7\n2) analysis test was used to study the possible association between the infection and the variables of clinical findings and fecal characters. For those variables with more than two categories, Chi-square of linear trend was used and the results were considered to be significant at P < 0.05.",

Thus, 53 (81.53%) of the parasitized calves had diarrhea compared with 12 (18.46%) with normal fecal consistency. Thirty two calves had soft pasty feces, whereas 21 were showing watery diarrhea. Overall results showed that diarrheic calves had higher rate of infection (17.72%) than non-diarrheic ones (7.54%). There was a significant association (P < 0.01) between Cryptosporidium infection and the presence of mucus in the feces; 36 (55.38%) of the infected calves had mucus in their feces. Also, there was a relationship between the presence of Cryptosporidium oocysts and the existence of blood in the feces (P < 0.01), 63.07% of the infected calves had blood in their feces, versus 36.93% calves. Moreover, there was significant association between the severity of infection and presence of blood, mucous or both in the feces (\u03c7\n2, P = 0.002; linear trend test, P = 0.001), thus 21 cases of severely infected calves had combined mucous and blood versus five of mild infection and 10 of moderate infection.

To our knowledge, there are no published reports dealing with risk factors and sufficient causes associated with cryptosporidiosis in buffalo calves. The prevalence of infection was 14.19%, which was found less than that recorded in water buffaloes (Iskander et al. 1987; Galiero et al. 1994) as well as wild buffalos (Mtambo et al. 1997). The variation between the different prevalence rates of the disease may be attributed to the system of rearing and management in addition to the level of hygienic measures applied. Moreover, it may be related also to the presence of many sufficient causes and a number of contributing factors. It was also found that the prevalence in buffalo calves was less than that described in bovine calves in different localities of the world (Castro-Hermida et al. 2002; Sant\u00edn et al. 2004). In the present study, all of the calves were not separated from their mothers directly after birth and had taken their colostrums directly from their dams. It is suggested that natural feeding and delayed separation could played a role in the low prevalence compared with bovine calves. Quigley et al. (1994) and Mohammed et al. (1999) observed a decrease in the risk of infection in calves which were separated from their mothers after only a few hours and fed manually.",

The prevalence of infection by Cryptosporidium spp. varied considerably with the age of the calves, although there was a controversy about the prevalence of cryptosporidiosis in relation to the age. The highest prevalence was found in calves at 1\u201315 days-old (60%) with progressive decrease until two month of age. Calves at 61\u201390-days of age recorded no infection. This finding coincided with that recorded by Wade et al. (2000) and de la Fuente et al. (1999). On contrary, cryptosporidiosis was recorded in older bovine calves (Maddox-Hyttel et al. 2006). Fayer et al. (1998) and Castro-Hermida et al. (2002) stated that the prevalence of bovine cryptosporidiosis is underestimated because of the low number of samples taken during the pre-weaning period. Villacorta et al. (1991) recorded prevalence of 93.0% in 3\u20136-day-old calves selected randomly and examined twice weekly for one month. In contrast, when only one or two fecal samples per calf were examined during the pre-weaning period, less than 30.0% of the calves were found to have oocysts in their feces (Garber et al. 1994; Maldonado et al. 1998).",

Winter recorded the highest prevalence (49.22%), while summer recorded the lowest (9.23%). It is suggested that the prevalence of infection by Cryptosporidium spp. is not only related to the presence of calves at risk but also related to the presence of the suitable climatic condition for viability and spread of the parasite. In winter, the temperature in our locality is suitable for viability and survival of Cryptosporidium oocysts. Similar findings were recorded by Tzipori (1983) and Lefay et al. (2000). These results were supported by Anderson (1986) who found that warm temperature of 18 to 29\u00b0C, had been partially responsible for loss of the infectivity. However, Garber et al. (1994) attributed the high prevalence of cryptosporidiosis in winter to presence of large number of calves at risk a result of concentration of calving in winter months. On contrary, in California, Atwill et al. (1999) found that calves were at high risk of contracting infection by Cryptosporidium spp. during May month and they attributed this to the greatest contact with the source of infection, lowering animal resistance or environmental conditions that might favor transmission of the infection during this month. Contrary to all recorded results, absence of seasonality in the presence of Cryptosporidium infection has been described (Wade et al. 2000; Castro-Hermida et al. 2002). It was suggested that seasonal effects can only be correctly evaluated when the study is repeated over several consecutive years (Castro-Hermida et al. 2002).",

In houses with cement floor there was no efficient cleaning or using of disinfectants, which could help to retain dirties and moisture. Furthermore, mixing of the animals with each other may help in contraction and spread of infection. On contrary, Castro-Hermida et al. (2002) found that cement floor had lower risk than straw/earth floor due to daily cleaning using water with pressure hose. The use of straw and deep litter seemed to confer protection against Cryptosporidium infection or at least excretion (Maddox-Hyttel et al. 2006) .They attributed this finding to the microclimatic factors governing oocyst survival. It was also found that calves in herds with cleaning daily had low tendency to have infection than that cleaned weekly (P < 0.001). In bovine calves, a similar finding was also recorded by Castro-Hermida et al. (2002). Moreover, there was tendency for the risk of infection to decrease when animals were housed individually in pens previously disinfected with bleach or lime (Garber et al. 1994; Quigley et al. 1994; Mohammed et al. 1999).",

Unfortunately, we did not estimate the loss of body weight associated with Cryptosporidium infection, suggesting that other infections may coexist and the effects were not due to cryptosporidiosis only.",

However, C. bovis was found also to infect cattle calves and could not be differentiated by the traditional methods (Sant\u00edn et al. 2004). C. parvum was only found to be predominant in unweaned calves, whereas C. bovis was detected in weaned cattle calves (Sant\u00edn et al. 2004; Fayer et al. 2005; Starkey et al. 2006). C. andersoni infects the abomasums of juvenile and mature cattle and this infection has been identified as a cause of reduced milk production. Moreover, in a study, G\u00f3mez-Couso et al. (2005) has been identified a Cryptosporidium spp. from buffalo heifers without diarrhea using the molecular characterization. In conclusion, similar to cattle calves, the results of the present investigation demonstrate the relation between Cryptosporidium infection and the occurrence of diarrhea in buffalo calves. Further molecular biological study needs to be done to recognize the Cryptosporidium spp. specific to the buffalo calves in Egypt.\n\n",
