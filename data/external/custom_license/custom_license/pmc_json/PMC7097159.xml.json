            "text": "Approximately 25 years after their discovery in 1915 (Ref. 1), the use of phages to answer fundamental questions about the mechanisms of inheritance began, taking advantage of the ease with which they could be manipulated2. Between the years 1940 and 1970, phage experiments laid much of the groundwork for the science of molecular biology. That science, once dubbed 'modern' as distinct from 'classical' biology, has long since been assimilated into the textbooks. However, recent research indicates that the historical contributions that phage studies have made to molecular biology might be overshadowed by their future influence on biology in general, and on genetics in particular. Phages have important roles in global ecology and bacterial pathogenicity. These emerging roles, together with the increasing number of recent publications on phage genomics, highlight the need for a timely assessment of phage biology and its bright future. Here, I summarize the studies of the molecular, ecological and evolutionary biology of phages that have led to this renaissance of interest, and define some crucial unanswered questions.",

As with all viruses, phages are infectious particles that have at least two components: nucleic acid and protein. If a phage invades a susceptible bacterial cell, the phage (or at least its nucleic acid) enters the cell and triggers a cycle of phage production (Fig. 1). During this cycle, the cell is reprogrammed to become a phage factory in which the components of the biosynthetic apparatus (such as ribosomes and ATP generators) are diverted from their normal tasks in bacterial growth. The various pathways for reprogramming are initiated by phage-specified proteins, which are translated from phage mRNA that is made after infection.",

Electron microscopy of HETERODUPLEXES, coupled with the results from genetic crosses, verified that the lambdoid phages have a common genetic map but show diverse specificities for properties such as integration, repression and host range. These studies also showed that any two lambdoid phages are similar in some segments of their genomes and dissimilar in others, with abrupt transitions from similarity to dissimilarity3.",

If different closely related phages, such as lambdoids, encounter one another in nature, they can recombine. The frequency of recombination depends on the degree of similarity of the two partners at the recombination points. So, between any two phages, shared segments of HOMOLOGY can serve as recombinational linkers, and even identities of oligonucleotide length can create preferred exchange points. None of this is new. However, breakage and joining sometimes occur even if there is no homology \u2014 which represents new ground \u2014 and over evolutionary time this happens often enough to generate the sharp boundaries between homology and non-homology that are observed in phages. Most such new junctions should be lethal or deleterious, but natural selection has preserved some benign combinations.",

Among the more marked examples of molecular chimerism is phage N15. Whereas most of its phage genes are related to, and in the same order as, the genes of a lambdoid phage, its prophage form persists as a linear plasmid that includes sequences that are related to the F plasmid of Escherichia coli as well as to coliphages P1 and P4 (Ref. 6).",

This pool includes groups, such as the lambdoid phages, in which mixing is even more frequent. However, some gene blocks that are found in lambdoid phages might have resided elsewhere for much of their history, and have diverged over long periods during which they were not subject to frequent recombination with other lambdoid phages. It should be noted that molecular clock estimates indicate that some allelic variants of \u03bb-genes diverged long before the existence of E. coli, which is the host of \u03bb, perhaps even as long ago as the branching of bacteria from archaea and eukaryotes4,7. There are many reasons to question the accuracy of dating by molecular clocks8. However, the antiquity of viral genes is also indicated by an independent line of evidence9. There are marked examples (such as adenoviruses and reoviruses) in which the morphology of the viral capsid is similar in a group that includes animal viruses, plant viruses and bacteriophages. These similarities extend from the shapes of individual proteins to the overall morphology of the virus particle (composed of several protein species) and seem unlikely to represent evolutionary convergence. This indicates a common ancestry for reoviruses and phage \u03c66, for example, although the RNA and protein sequences show no significant similarities and, therefore, must have diverged anciently, perhaps before the separation of the main domains of the living world.",

Several molecules of \u03bb-integrase form an assemblage (the INTASOME) that binds to a specific segment of phage DNA, recruits the bacterial insertion sites into the complex, then makes concerted single-strand cuts in the two DNAs. The strand cutting proceeds through the covalent joining of a 3\u2032 phosphate to a tyrosine of the integrase protein. The terminal three bases of the free 5\u2032 ends then rotate to exchange partners, followed by ligation with removal of the integrase protein from the 3\u2032 ends to form a HOLLIDAY JUNCTION. The assemblage then undergoes a rearrangement (isomerization) and resolves the Holliday structure by cutting the two previously uncut strands on the other side of the junction, which allows the exchange of partners by the freed 5\u2032 ends, followed by resealing23. The reverse reaction (excision from the chromosome) requires a second phage-specified protein (excisionase) and proceeds by an analogous mechanism, which is, however, not a simple chemical reversal of the integration reaction24.",

Both repressor and Cro can bind to three sites in oR and shut-off transcription in both directions. However, one or the other will eventually get the upper hand. If repressor synthesis is established, Cro synthesis is shut off, and vice versa.

The shut-off of repressor synthesis by Cro depends on Cro binding to the oR3 operator site, which could be the crucial step in activating the lytic cycle. In this view, the establishment of repression depends on a race between Cro and the repressor. However, it has been known from early on that another protein, CII, which acts at the promoter site pRE, is crucial in repressor establishment35 and that Cro that is bound to the other oR sites (oR2 and oR1) decreases CII production. This makes it equally possible that the decisive race is between Cro and CII, with oR3 having, at most, an ancillary role.",

This work underscores the potential for modelling whole-cell physiology with the present high-throughput data on transcription rates and protein abundance. Still lacking is a complete model that predicts the strong overshoot in repressor concentration that is observed during lysogenization34. Because the rate of repressor synthesis from CII-stimulated pRE is much higher than that observed in a lysogen, it seems unlikely that Cro that is bound to oR3 can prevent repressor establishment if CII synthesis achieves its maximum rate.",

With the advent of antibiotics, the development and use of phage therapy almost disappeared from the Western world, although it continued in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe39. As the incidence of antibiotic resistance continues to rise, the field has been reactivated38. Phage therapy has some inherent advantages over antibiotics, in both the specificity and the ability of the agent to propagate in the desired location (advantages that were seldom realized in earlier work with impure phage preparations)39.

First, they are dedicated to a common function, such as pathogenicity, which is not directly needed for simple survival. Second, they differ from the surrounding DNA in molecular statistics such as the G+C content, codon usage and neighbour relations. Third, they are present in certain strains of a bacterial species and absent from others. Their widespread occurrence has only come to light through whole genome sequencing, and their molecular statistics indicate that such elements have been derived in the relatively recent past from other bacterial species, to which they might be indigenous56. Their intercalation in only certain strains of the species in which they are now observed indicates the operation of an insertion mechanism, such as phage integration or TRANSPOSITION; also, some islands are flanked by phage-insertion sites, which technically qualifies the whole unit, whatever its historical origin, as a defective prophage57,58.",
