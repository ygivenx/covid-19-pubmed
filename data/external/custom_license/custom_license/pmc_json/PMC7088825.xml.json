Although it has now been well defined that mucosal inflammation is the principal condition in these diseases, the etiology and pathogenic mechanisms underlying the development and progress of these nasal diseases are still incompletely understood. They can be influenced by multiple risk factors including gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. For example, chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) with and without nasal polyps (CRSwNP and CRSsNP) can be described as a dysfunctional host-environment interaction that occurs in the nose and paranasal sinuses [1\u2022\u2022].",

The combined function of ciliated epithelial and secretory cells maintaining efficient mucociliary clearance and a variety of other host defense mechanisms can be considered a soldier in the fight against airborne pathogens [2\u2022\u2022]. In addition, a new concept on the \u201cimmune barrier hypothesis\u201d proposes that defects in the coordinated mechanical barrier and/or the innate immune response of the sinonasal epithelium manifest as CRS [3]. This concept has been confirmed based on respiratory epithelial cells which are the primary targets of the common viruses (influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], adenovirus, rhinovirus, coronavirus, Coxsackie virus, and paramyxovirus), where various defense mechanisms have evolved in the respiratory tract to prevent and control the infection of viruses and other pathogens [4\u2022\u2022].",

Normal inspiratory nasal airflow for an adult can range from 5 to 12 L/min for calm breathing and increase to 40 L/min with physical exercise, but extreme airflow rates may be as large as 150 L/min [5]. Due to the interior structure and typical shape of the human nose, the aerodynamics of airflow changes significantly from a relatively laminar flow at the vestibule to a highly turbulent flow anterior to the head of the inferior turbinate [6]. This is critical to facilitating mucosal contact for heating/cooling, humidification, and filtration of inspired air, which is necessary in conjunction with the functions of the nervous system, vasculature, secretory tissue, and mucociliary clearance of the nasal mucosa.",

This will produce 100\u2013200 mL of mucus over 24 h in a resting rate [7]. Epithelial cells, composed of basal cells, goblet cells, and ciliated or non-ciliated columnar cells, are attached to their neighbors by cell-cell junctions, including tight junctions (TJs), adherens junctions (AJs), gap junctions, and desmosomes, which are central components of the physical barrier [2\u2022\u2022, 8]. Mucociliary clearance or sometimes referred to as the mucociliary apparatus is the process by which cilia of the nasal epithelial cells transport the viscous mucus blanket of the upper airway to the gastrointestinal tract. In the healthy nose, over 80\u201390 % of small particles (e.g., 10 \u03bcm) in the inhalant air are trapped on the surface of the nasal mucosa [9] and are transported by the mucociliary apparatus to the pharynx where they are either swallowed or coughed up. This phenomenon supports the claim that the nasal epithelium is exposed first, and to a greater extent than that of the bronchial epithelium, to all environmental agents, including infectious agents (e.g., viruses, bacteria, and fungi), allergens, and air pollutants, thus protecting the lower airways [10\u2022].",

Among these, rhinoviruses, influenza viruses, and RSV have been intensively investigated, and their mode of epithelial injury is well understood [21\u201324]. It has been reported in our previous review [25\u2022] that respiratory viruses infect epithelial cells via cell surface receptors (e.g., ICAM-1, TLR3, \u03b1-2,3-SA/\u03b1-2,6-SA, RIG-I, and MDA5), up-regulate receptor expression of ICAM-1 via IL-1\u03b2 and nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB-dependent mechanisms, and enhance release of inflammatory mediators (e.g., IL-6, IL-8, IL-1\u03b1, IP-10, TNF\u03b1, RANTES, IRF7, TGF-\u03b21, etc.) with subsequent transcription, replication, virus assembly, and release.

Some immunopathologies may be unavoidable if the host is to eradicate the viruses. The initial infection of a respiratory virus is established in epithelial cells through PRRs by initiating a cascade of signals that result in the production of cytokines and chemokines. The release of these inflammatory mediators into the surrounding environment alters the innate immune system in the presence of infection and establishes a localized antiviral state [26]. However, the pathogenic mechanisms of virus-induced inflammation and pathogenesis of common cold symptoms are still not fully understood. It has been suggested that the severe lung inflammation associated with respiratory infection by certain viruses poses a unique challenge to the immune system. Not only must the virus be rapidly eliminated by the immune system, but tissue inflammation must also be controlled to prevent acute respiratory failure [2\u2022\u2022, 4\u2022\u2022, 26].",

Respiratory epithelial cells are able to recognize viruses through PRRs, such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which play a crucial role in the initiation of immune responses in the respiratory epithelium and which lead to the induction of type I IFNs [2\u2022\u2022, 27]. Type I IFNs (known as IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2) were among the first antiviral agents to be characterized and are still seen as central to the early antiviral response of virus-infected cells [2\u2022\u2022, 4\u2022\u2022]. Recently, a novel class of antiviral cytokines was discovered and are classified as type III IFNs, such as IFN-\u03bb1/IL-29, IFN-\u03bb2/IL-28A, and IFN-\u03bb3/IL-28B, which possess antiviral properties similar to those of type I IFNs but appear to be expressed especially by epithelial cells and consequently exert host protection primarily at epithelial surfaces [2\u2022\u2022, 28, 29]. It has been reported that the pandemic influenza virus (pH1N1) in 2009 was found to induce type I and type III IFNs and was extremely sensitive to the antiviral actions of type I and type III IFNs [30]. Therefore, an understanding of the mechanisms by which viruses interfere with epithelial innate and adaptive immune responses might contribute to the design of new therapeutic tools to treat or prevent respiratory disorders caused by viral infections [2\u2022\u2022].",

Identification of gene susceptibility to CRS as well as expression signatures and molecular pathways in CRS pathogenesis have also contributed significantly to a better understanding of the genetic and molecular alterations underlying CRS development and progression [10\u2022, 36]. The major inflammatory manifestations of CRS include (1) increased infiltration of eosinophils, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages; (2) abnormal regulation of Th1, Th2, and regulatory T cell (Treg) gene expression; (3) defects in the epithelial barrier and in both innate and adaptive host defense functions; (4) epithelial damage followed by aberrant remodeling; (5) alterations of eicosanoid pathways; and (6) fibrosis or edema [10\u2022]. However, the pathogenic mechanisms causing the initial process and sustaining the abnormal inflammation are incompletely understood. Future studies are needed to identify details in genetic interactions and the interacting pathways underlying CRS and to investigate the interactions with environmental factors that influence the complex pathology of CRS.

Furthermore, goblet cell hyperplasia with excessive mucus production, abnormalities in cilia architecture, and function can be found in hyperplasia or squamous metaplasia of the nasal epithelium [1\u2022\u2022, 39, 40, 41\u2022\u2022]. These pathological findings are similar to that seen in asthma where the epithelium damage and more mucus-producing cells than normal make the airway epithelial barrier more permeable and more sensitive to oxidants resulting in a deficient innate immune response to respiratory viral infections compared with that seen in normal individuals [42\u2022].

Instead of using commercially available respiratory cell lines which have often undergone long-term in vitro cultivation and therefore may not represent the real biological features of hNECs, primary hNEC culture has been used in many studies. Briefly, the epithelial cells are enzymatically dissociated from nasal biopsies and seeded on cell culture flasks. After expanding the epithelial cells in mixed cell clusters (including inflammatory cells, submucosal glands, and fibroblasts) by using a monolayer culture method, the harvested cells are then transferred into an air-liquid interface (ALI) culture to form pseudostratified epithelium. This model has been successfully used in some studies such as a study that demonstrated intrinsic alterations in innate immune gene expression in CRS epithelial cells when grown in a 6-week culture in vitro [45]. There was increased CP110 expression in rhinosinal mucosa from patients with CRS which might contribute to the poor ciliation observed in patients with CRS [40]. Properly stimulated hNECs may impart immuno-modulatory effects on the antigen-specific antibody response at least through the production of IL-6 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) [46]. It has been demonstrated recently that reconstituted epithelia from human NP epithelial cells cultured in ALI system provide a 3D in vitro model that could be useful both for studying the role of epithelium in CRSwNP while developing new therapeutic strategies, including cell therapy, for CRSwNP [47\u2022].",

The choice of experimental methodology is also important as this can greatly influence the results and interpretation when comparing the expression profiles of innate immune genes between hNECs obtained from nasal brushes and from tissue biopsies [45]. It was reported in an early study that hNECs from NPs became squamous and lose their cilia within 2 to 6 weeks in monolayer cultures, while cilia reappeared after changing to suspension cultures [48]. Therefore, it is critical for in vitro studies to establish a hNEC culture model with enough living hNECs and to maintain them in an in vitro culture system for days or weeks without changing their primary biological characteristics.",

Thus, techniques in isolation and in vitro culture of human nasal epithelial stem/progenitor cells (hNESPCs) become feasible and will provide us with an in-depth understanding of the complex mechanisms of self-renewal, proliferation, differentiation, and epithelial remodeling that occurs during development and homeostasis with common infectious and inflammatory nasal diseases [11, 49, 50].",

Some key findings from these studies are summarized in Fig. 1a. Briefly, single-cell-derived colonies stain uniformly for basal cell markers such as p63 and keratin 5 (Krt5), and about 80 % of the colonies show potential for long-term self-renewal, because they can be propagated successively for at least an estimated 20\u201350 additional doublings, while maintaining an immature phenotype [51\u2022\u2022]. Lineage potential has been assessed through multiple differentiation assays, in which the pedigree lines developed from single cells can differentiate into stratified mucociliary airway epithelium composed of both ciliated columnar cells and goblet cells. This in vitro culture system provides (1) cells in large numbers (both progenitor and differentiated hNECs), (2) cells which maintain their original biological characteristics, and (3) the in vitro differentiated epithelial cells are viable for more than 1 month in ALI culture. It opens up many research possibilities to understand the molecular mechanisms and pathways underlying both healthy and diseased nasal epithelium and to identify more targeted and cellular therapies for common nasal diseases.\n",

In contrast, hNESPCs from NPs showed a reduced growth and proliferation rate at each passage by evaluating colony-forming efficiency and doubling time and a lower percentage of Ki67+ cells among p63+ cells in the colonies in late passages. This was also confirmed by immuno-staining in the NP specimens.

Further confirmation was performed in vitro with differentiated epithelial cells derived from hNESPCs in the same patients and healthy controls. The results from both in vivo and in vitro measurements are concordant and are associated with increased expression of ciliogenesis-associated markers (e.g., CP110, Foxj1, and TAp73) that confirm the cause of these pathological changes that is likely intrinsic (Fig. 1a) [41\u2022\u2022]. These findings are of significant importance to our understanding of the clinical nature of NPs with persistent inflammation and their high recurrence even after maximal anti-inflammatory treatment and surgery. Hopefully, these results will aid in the discovery and development of more specific and directed treatments for NPs and for other inflammatory and hyperplastic airway diseases.",

In addition to continuous efforts in surveillance of naturally occurring viruses in humans, experimental studies elucidating susceptibilities to respiratory viruses and response to infection by human nasal epithelium, which is the primary target site for common cold and influenza viruses, are required. The nature and severity of viral infection observed is dependent on both the direct harmful effects of the virus itself and on the damage caused to host tissues as a consequence of the host immune response to the virus. Thus, hNESPCs and differentiated epithelial cells derived from hNESPCs in an ALI culture may offer possibilities in screening and quantitative assessment of the virulence of common viruses, and the host defense functions including viral fusion and uncoating, transport of viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes from the nucleus, replication, transcription and translation of the viral genome, export of viral RNP complexes from the nucleus, viral assembly and budding, and potential drug targets. This would provide us with a useful reference for public health risk assessment, interventions, disease control, and prognosis for viral upper respiratory infections. Figure 1b provides a schematic diagram of our current study protocol and some preliminary data elucidating viral infection in specific cell types at 24 h post viral infection. By using this model, we are able to confirm all reported and possible new specific markers (e.g., mediators, cytokines, chemokines, and receptors) from nasal epithelium at the different time points after viral infection (unpublished data) [2\u2022\u2022, 4\u2022\u2022, 25\u2022, 26].",

All pictures with double staining are carried out by using immunofluorescence staining technique. a Schematic summary of the histopathological and pathogenic alterations in nasal polyps (NPs) from recent in vivo and in vitro studies [37\u2022, 41\u2022\u2022, 51\u2022\u2022, 52\u2022\u2022]. Our in vivo studies showed that NPs are associated with chronic mucosal inflammation (e.g., eosinophilia), hyperplasia of basal cells (p63+ and KRT5+ cells) and goblet cells (MUC5AC+ cells), impairment of cilia architecture (untidy, overly dense, and lengthened) together with increased protein expression levels of ciliogenesis-associated markers (CP110, Foxj1, and TAp73) in ciliated columnar cells (\u03b2IV-tubulin+ cells) by using histo- and immuno-staining and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). These pathological findings are confirmed by the in vitro data with reduced growth and proliferation activities (Ki67+) in hNESPCs (p63+ cells), increased mucus production (MUC5AC+ cells), and abnormal cilia architecture (same as in vivo findings) in differentiated epithelial cells derived from hNESPCs also with increased protein expression levels of CP110, Foxj1, and TAp73. Thus, these ciliogenesis-associated markers are confirmed to be associated with the pathogenesis of epithelial hyperplasia and impairment of cilia architecture in NPs, and their changes are likely intrinsic. b The in vitro models for viral infections. Viral infection of influenza H3N2 virus (Influenza A/Aichi/2/68 stain, MOI of 0.1) is conducted in hNESPCs derived from biopsies of healthy nasal mucosa. The cytopathic effects (e.g., cell detachment, round up, and crimp cell membrane) and H3N2-infected hNESPCs (H3N2 nucleoprotein+) are seen 24 h post infection (hpi). In the differentiated nasal epithelial cells, H3N2 virus can impair the tight junctions by showing an enlarged and irregular pattern of ZO-1 and infect directly the ciliated cells (\u03b2IV-tubulin+) and goblet cells (MUC5AC+) as shown by a double staining of viral nucleoprotein at 24 hpi. For respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, MOI of 3), the infection may start from the ciliated cells as shown by a double staining with RSV-N protein (RSV-N) and \u03b2IV-tubulin (kindly provided with permission from Professor R.
