Recently, the WHO declared an outbreak of acute respiratory distress syndrome and pneumonia a public health emergency of international concern, the highest level of alarm. The outbreak was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and since then, tens of thousands of cases have been reported and the outbreak has spread globally. Writing in Nature, two studies provide initial insights into the cause of the respiratory disease: a novel coronavirus of probable bat origin.",

The patient experienced a severe respiratory syndrome and had abnormal chest radiographs. After excluding common respiratory pathogens as the cause, the authors performed meta-transcriptomic sequencing of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) to identify the aetiological agent. Analyses of the sequencing reads led to the identification of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). The whole genome (~29.9 kb) was assembled and characterized, and phylogenetic analyses revealed that 2019-nCoV is closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus). In phylogenetic trees based on the nucleotide sequences of whole genomes and viral protein genes, the 2019-nCoV clustered with Sarbecovirus in all phylogenies, including the 2002\u20132003 pandemic SARS-CoV. The authors found putative evidence of recombination events among sarbecoviruses, but found no evidence that recombination facilitated the emergence of 2019-nCoV.",

Significant similarities in amino acid sequence and predicted 3D structure between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV were observed, which suggests that 2019-nCoV uses the same entry receptor as SARS-CoV: the ACE2 protein.",

The authors first used a panel of pan-CoV primers to determine whether a CoV was the aetiological agent and found that five of the samples were PCR positive.
