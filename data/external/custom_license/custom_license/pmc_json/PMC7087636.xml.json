In Hong Kong, we had altogether 1755 clinical SARS patients of whom 113 were below 18 years of age [2]. In contrast with adults, there were no deaths seen in children and adolescents. It seems children suffered much less from the infection than adults, although some adolescents could have severe lung involvement [3, 4, 5]. In our hospital, among 43 SARS children and adolescents, only 5 required PICU care including 1 adolescent girl who needed intubation; all recovered from the disease with no sequelae [5].",

The regimen used in children is slightly different with lower dosage of steroid given [9]; however, their efficacy had not been proven although anecdotal evidence suggests that corticosteroids may be beneficial. Convalescent serum had been tried in patients with some good results [10].",

The usual immunosuppressant regimen might not need to be changed to keep the transplanted kidney from rejection; however, if additional immunosuppressants are to be used for SARS, they will probably need to be given at reduced dosages depending on the duration after kidney transplantation and current immunosuppressants for fear of overwhelming infections. Immunoglobulins may be considered for protection. With immunosuppression, fever might not be a prominent feature, and respiratory symptoms and signs need to be closely watched with frequent X-ray chest monitoring, especially in the second week when deterioration might be expected. Such patients should be isolated and those medical personnel taking care of them must be fully protected, with strict isolation measures enforced.",
