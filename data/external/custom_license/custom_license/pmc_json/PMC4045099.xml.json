We also provided a description of the seven domains and their elements that constitute an OHE.1 In the ensuing years, the accumulation of scientific evidence and the changes in healthcare delivery brought on by health reform have reinforced the importance of an OHE as the preferred clinical approach to patient care by individual health practitioners and healthcare institutions. Some elements in our OHE definition have been incorporated into the operations and best practices of several medical institutions and into large systems in their attempts to transform from disease treatment to health and healing.2 However, in our field studies and evaluation of the literature, we have not found a complete prototype of an optimal healing environment that fulfills our definition and criteria. This is not a criticism. Rather, it is a comment on the reality and exigencies that exist when medical organizations take on the task of changing their culture and philosophy of care. To help healthcare organizations move toward becoming OHEs, we have developed research and educational tools for making a culture change toward institutionalizing healing as a way of practice.",

From this context, our definition of healing is \u201cthe processes of recovery, repair, renewal, and reintegration that contribute to a whole person's (physical, mental, social, and spiritual) health and well-being.\u201d Defined in this way, healing processes are preventive (help retain health and build resilience), restorative (accelerate and facilitate recovery), and palliative (maximize function and well-being) even when recovery and cure are not possible. The concept also goes beyond the original psychological construct to form the foundation for a model of medical care built on health creation and not only the mitigation of disease.",

Importantly, healing may or may not result in cure, and cure may or may not result in healing.5 Healing and cure are mutually complementary, and both are essential. Thus, for good healthcare, they must be integrated. Dealing with the disease is the business of medical care. It is done in the healthcare delivery space\u2014in the office, clinic, or hospital. The enhancement of healing processes is the business of us all. It occurs in the context of relationships in the life space\u2014 at home, school, work, in a clinic, or in a community.",

In short, it is a place that delivers HOPE (healing-oriented practices and environments) and integrates them into all aspects of care. OHE is an organizing concept or heuristic framework that is applicable to all health professionals, patients and their families and significant others, healthcare organizations, and healthcare systems. Consistent with its preventive, restorative, and palliative role, it is also adaptable to schools, worksites, and community locations. It is a way of connecting the core concept of salutogenesis to many models of healthcare and service deliveries that share similar goals and philosophies.

There are questions about the availability of supporting evidence-based data, and the reliability and validity of conventional health measures in the context of a healing environment. High-tech care is still valued over high-touch care by many. There is a lack of consensus of what defines and constitutes integrative medicine. The Affordable Care Act often leaves major questions about if and how healing behaviors and practices will be covered in benefits and where along the spectrum of care they will be supported. Thus, healthcare organizations can be reluctant to invest in developing and delivering them.",

Our population is both aging and expanding as life expectancy increases and as the Baby Boomers fuel growth in the 65-years-and-older age segment. For almost all people, aging is inevitably associated with chronic health conditions and disabilities. Most chronic diseases cannot be cured. Thus, once they occur, they are constantly present in a person's daily life as are their therapeutic interventions. Accordingly, the focus of the practitioner-patient dyad must be on healing and on healing environment components regardless of whether there is expectation of cure.",
