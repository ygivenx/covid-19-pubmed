            "text": "Vincristine (VCR, Figure 1A), isolated from the leaves of the periwinkle plant Catharanthus roseus,1 is a widely used antineoplastic drug in the clinic, especially for pediatric and adult malignancies.2 It is a cell cycle-specific anticancer drug that mainly interferes with mitotic spindle microtubules3\u20137 and induces tumor cell apophysis.7\u20139 In the past few decades, optimizing the formulation and then improving its anticancer effect has attracted much attention. The investigated formulation includes microemulsions,10 common nanoparticles,11 conventional liposomes,12 sterical liposomes,13 and targeted nanoparticles.14 The clinical applications of the above carriers are largely limited by their complex components and/or complicated production process. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a VCR vehicle with higher anticancer effects. Emulsion is a commonly acceptable formulation that has been used in clinics for years, and microemulsion15\u201317 and submicron emulsion1819 have been studied extensively. These vehicles can be administered via parenteral,10,20 transdermal,19 and ocular21 routes. Wang et al prepared a micron emulsion to carry VCR,10 which was stable and exhibited greater antitumor effect. However, this formulation contained a special component poly(ethylene glycol)\u2013 distearoyl phosphatidylethanolamine that largely increased the cost of preparation and caused some side effects after repeated administrations, such as accelerated blood clearance.22\u201325 What\u2019s more, the possible mechanism of the improved anticancer effect was still unclear at the cellular level.",

As shown in Figure 3, the release rate of VCR-OA-SME was much slower than that of VCR solution, and the release profiles could be divided into two phases, ie, the initial burst-release phase and the sustained-release phase. During the first 8 hours (initial burst-release phase), 63.96% of drug was released from the VCR solution, while 35.01% was from VCR-OA-SME. The lower burst release was more beneficial, since the toxicity of VCR was normally associated with extremely high drug concentration.38\u201342 Meanwhile, the higher burst release may cause a higher risk of serious side effects, as well as a lower therapeutic effect. The burst release of VCR-OA-SME may come from the small fraction of drug adsorbed on the surface of the emulsion drops.",

From this figure, the blood concentration of VCR solution injection is always lower than the VCR-OA-SME, indicating the slower clearance of VCR-OA-SME than VCR solution, which was further demonstrated by the mean retention time value (Table 1). Since VCR is a cell cycle-specific anticancer drug3\u20137 whose curative effect is time-dependent, longer mean retention time with appropriate drug concentration may have better anticancer effect.43 The slower release of VCR from VCR-OA-SME may be one of the main reasons for its slower clearance. In addition, the area under the curve value of VCR-OA-SME is higher than that of VCR solution (Table 1), indicating that VCR-OA-SME has a higher absolute bioavailability. There is no doubt that slower clearance and higher bioavailability are beneficial for higher drug accumulation in tumors and thus for better therapeutic effect.",

It is reported that the in vitro cytotoxicity may come from drug property and release profile.44 Firstly, VCR-OA-SME can be endocytosed in an intact form due to its small size and the surface charge.

Furthermore, when VCR concentration was 10 or 20 ng/mL, the cell population in the sub-G1 phase in the VCR-OA-SME group was more than that in the VCR solution group (P < 0.001). Since the sub-G1 phase is a characteristic hypodiploid DNA content peak indicating apoptotic and necrotic cells,47 more cells in the sub-G1 phase in the VCR-OA-SME group mean that VCR-OA-SME could induce more cells to undergo apoptosis.48,49 Although MCF-7 exhibited more cells in the G2/M phase for the VCR solution group compared with VCR-OA-SME group at 20 ng/mL, more cells were arrested in the sub-G1 phase for the VCR-OA-SME group than in other groups (P < 0.001), which indicated that more cell apoptosis was induced after cell-cycle arrest by VCR-OA-SME.30,50",

It is well known that the apoptotic cell nucleus will show many morphologic modifications, such as nuclear pyknosis and condensation, chromatin fragmentation, and formation of apoptotic bodies.51 In Figure 7B, the morphology of the cell nucleus in the control group was maintained with homogeneous chromatin, while the significant chromatin condensation, nuclear fragmentation, or even apoptotic body formation could be found in the VCR-treated groups. It was also found that the nucleus-morphology change was more severe in the VCR-OA-SME group. In addition, these cell-apoptotic extents were quantified. Cells were stained with annexin-V/PI and the percentages of viable (annexin V\u2212/PI\u2212), early apoptotic (annexin V+/PI\u2212), late apoptotic or secondary necrotic (annexin V+/PI+), and necrotic (annexin V\u2212/PI+) cells were measured by CellQuest (Becton Dickinson) software (Figure 7C).

It was also found that the cell uptake of VCR solution and VCR-OA-SME were concentration-dependent. As presented in Figure 8B, the cell uptake of VCR-OA-SME was significantly restrained at 4\u00b0C and in the presence of sodium azide, which is a mitochondrial adenosine triphosphatase inhibitor and can inhibit energy metabolism,52,53 indicating that the cell uptake of VCR-OA-SME was both temperature- and energy-dependent. However, the VCR solution uptake by cells incubated at 4\u00b0C became undetectable (UI = 0), whereas the presence of sodium azide existed indicating that the uptake of VCR solution was mainly temperature-dependent. The additional cell-uptake pathway of VCR-OA-SME (the energy-dependent cell uptake) may be also one of the reasons for its higher uptake efficiency and cytotoxicity. According to the previous studies on nanomedicine54 and the characteristics of VCR-OA-SME (such as size and material composition), endocytosis could be the most likely pathway of VCR-OA-SME taken up by cells in the study.",

The in vitro release rate of VCR-OA-SME was significantly slower than that of the VCR solution. The in vivo study showed that VCR-OA-SME had a longer mean retention time compared to VCR solution. Furthermore, compared with free VCR, VCR-OA-SME could lead to more cell uptake, arrest more cells in the G2/M phase, and induce more apoptosis, and thus showed a higher antineoplastic effect.",
