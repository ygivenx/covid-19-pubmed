The outbreak of the avian influenza (AI) in the winter of 2003 had a devastating and contagious impact in East Asia and became a pandemic of global scale. This crisis was a threat to the people, economy and the states of the region, and it seemed that the previous severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak did not provide a learning experience. The associated regional integrative measures developed in response to the SARS crisis (e.g. based on the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Plus Three Action Plan on Prevention and Control of SARS and other Infectious Diseases) were not immediately drawn on. Furthermore, the international community was informed about the outbreak months after the crisis started, when Southeast Asian states realised that they could not manage the impact of the virus (Thomas 2006: 923). World Health Organisation (WHO) officials have argued that some Southeast Asian states were slow to call on international assistance, because they lacked trust in the international and external actors (e.g. with regard to virus-sharing) and for reasons of political face-saving (Butler 2005a, c).",

They heavily relied on the assistance of the WHO and a number of other international actors (e.g. Butler 2005b, in the case of American assistance for Indonesia). Seven years onwards, ASEAN states are still cooperating with external partners to increase the level of pandemic preparedness in the region.

It posits that a transnational crisis replaces goals and purposes that pre-define action and interaction in times of normalcy short of immediate threats and crises (Doidge 2008: 39). A transnational crisis acts as an independent variable generating either deeper or new integration in an issue-area. That is, it leads to both qualitative (depth of integration) and quantitative (diversification of issues) differentiation of regional integration. Thereby, regional organisations with shallow institutionalisation and an adherence to intergovernmentalism and state-centrism will advance minimally with regard to the qualitative regional and interregional dimension.",

They will attempt to trace behavioural patterns of regional organisations when facing a transnational and unconventional security threat and define the characteristics with reference to the kind of affectedness, mode of regional and interregional cooperation, the degree of institutionalisation and the role of international actors. The article will argue that these moderating variables are decisive in understanding, explaining and predicting the impact of crises on the integrative behaviour of regional organisations. It further understands that the resource\u2013capacity expectations gap is a common problem of developing countries who cannot implement the necessary levels of preparedness because of their lack of resources. This shortcoming is intertwined with the moderating variables. For comparative purposes of the regional integrative dynamics, the article will first take a look at ASEAN\u2019s intra-mural cooperation and then at the EU\u2019s deep and supranationally coordinated regionalism on AI and allude to the mentioned variables. Following the regional perspective, the article will examine what kind of external, interregional as well as bilateral actorness1 the EU displayed.",

Malaysia expressed its intention to establish a Regional Avian Influenza Research and Reference Centre. ASEAN member states committed to regional coordination, information-sharing and collaboration that was to be pursued within the ASEAN Health Ministers Meeting (AHMM) and the ASEAN Ministers Meeting on Agriculture and Forestry (AMMAF). In the ASEAN Secretariat\u2019s report, ASEAN Response to Combat Avian Influenza, a work plan was designed, synergies with international agencies envisaged and tasks distributed to individual state and ASEAN intergovernmental authorities to improve prevention, control and eradication of the virus over a three-year period (ASEAN Secretariat 2006: para. 6\u20139).",

At the APT in 2007, China proposed to set up a Regional Monitoring Centre on Infectious Diseases and Japan made a new pledge of US$ 67 million to fight AI and other pandemic diseases.

The AI crisis raised power concerns among many Southeast Asian central decision-makers.

Regional measures could not directly support this end, and, therefore, they were relegated and regarded to be strengthening the primary efforts on the national level.

Noteworthy is that there were different types of national instruments. Some were concerned with prevention such as the ones of the insular Philippines that has been unaffected from the virus. Others revolved around fire-fighting, that is, for instance, the immediate termination of livestock. Within the national poultry control and human epidemic plans the governments emphasised the long-term dimension and, for example, with regard to the animal dimension, introduced new regulations within the poultry industry. Both the short- and long-term projects received the support of external partners. The WHO, Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) were central international organisations assisting Southeast Asia. In 2006, the WHO established a Regional Pandemic Preparedness Plan to complement the national efforts. In spite of the national, regional and international efforts, as of early 2010, Indonesia and Myanmar still listed cases of AI, and it seems that the disease has become endemic to some Southeast Asian countries as suggested by a report from the FAO 6 years ago (McLeod et al. 2004).",

The inclusion of civil society actors is patchy and remains relatively neglected, although their engagement is vital in bridging the gap between the national authorities and the local level. In spite of governmental attempts to conduct surveillance, report and investigate cases of AI on the provincial levels, their lack of financial means compelled non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to step in and facilitate information flow to the micro-level. However, these NGOs also face resource shortage. In the case of Cambodia, for instance, NGOs concerned with health provided AI specific information and were dependent on outside funding for AI projects. The problem is that NGOs generally lack the resources and their external funding is short-lived and inconsistent (Keovathanak 2009: 109\u2013110).",

In particular, faith-based NGOs play an important role in this context (Keovathanak 2009). Solutions to this cultural factor cannot be achieved through policies from the central government and be imposed top-down. First, in the majority of Southeast Asian states central governments are physically and politically far away from the rural communities, which are still strongly dependent on traditional kin and patronage relationships. Local and religious authorities enjoy higher influence than the government. The issue of remoteness leads to another problematic aspect; since villagers lack an incentive to report in view of the financial burden, they do not report (Balen and Caballero Anthony 2009: 5). Second, you cannot just tell people how to change a lifestyle they and their ancestors have lived over hundreds of years. The problems of remoteness and culture are the main obstacles that have to be overcome if Southeast Asian states are determined to exterminate AI.",

The EU response to the AI outbreaks in Southeast Asia was multi-faceted and based on a comprehensive approach. From the domestic viewpoint, which is concerned with the protection of Europe -a responsibility of the Directorate General (DG) for Health and Consumers-, the trade on poultry from Southeast Asia was restricted and the EU revamped the Council Directive (92/40/EEC) on AI in 2005. The directive provided the guidelines for the member states to implement national plans. Beyond the national dimension the European Commission adopted a Community Influenza Preparedness Plan on 26 March 2004. This plan differentiated the supranational and intergovernmental competences on AI. With regard to the external dimension, Directorate General (DG) External Relations in coordination with other DGs including DG Health, DG Development and DG Research was one of the main driving forces behind the global response to AI. The EU co-organised the international ministerial conferences on animal and pandemic influenza, provided an important amount of additional funds for development and research, using the response to the crisis as a vehicle for regional integration and sustainable development (Interview with EU official 4 November 2009). Hence, an array of AI actions was pursued under various DGs -including DG Enlargement to secure and buffer beyond the EU borders-.",

Furthermore, we have to consider that the outbreak in Southeast Asia could have led to a global pandemic but that the EU had geography in its favour. Given the distance between both regions, the spread of AI from East Asia to Western Europe took months and gave the European Commission and the EU member states enough time to prepare for an outbreak in their own region.

Based on the empirical evidence, the article suggests a certain predictability of regional and interregional integrative dynamics. In conclusion, the article argues that the case study of AI has affirmed the moderating impact of the variables for the purpose of explaining and predicting behaviour, but, it also understands that crises always bear a degree of uncertainty and inconsistency. That is, they can lead to the contestation of traditional behaviour and norms and their eventual transformation or substitution as has been the case during the Asian financial crisis. This implies that some of the moderating variables may be subject to change in such a case. The financial crisis of 1997 has demonstrated that crises can only produce change of institutions and cooperative culture when the degree of affectedness is severe and the role of international aides is perceived to be detrimental. This gives impetus to meaningful regional integrative dynamics. When regional organisations and their nation-state sub-units are compelled to look into themselves and reflect, only then, institutions and their institutional culture may alter and also become the dependent variable in the causality chain.",

            "text": "This example highlights the importance of the moderating variables. In fact, the case of AI suggests that, when viewing the transnational crisis as the independent variable, one may causally explain the responsive integrative dynamic qualitatively and quantitatively only if the mentioned moderating variables are considered. It appears that exchanging two specific moderating variables (mode of regional and interregional cooperation and the degree of institutionalisation = in short, encompassed in the overall concept of institutional design3) with the current independent variable may provide a more accurate causality and deeper explanation of the regional and interregional integrative dynamics, in particular, with regard to shallow and intergovernmentally institutionalised regional organisations like ASEAN.",

            "text": "Behavioural explanatory and predictability value is more consistent and possibly higher in reference to the institutional design as the independent variable. However, behavioural patterns are subject to higher variability in the context of crises. Hence, while an institution-based approach allows us to draw on cost\u2013benefit calculations of the nation-state as well as on the notion of institutional path dependency, it will neglect behavioural and normative change. Nevertheless, the article suggests that crises as catalysts for meaningful institutional change are dependent on the severity of the crisis, the level of resource availability for response and increasing the level of preparedness and the role of external actors. It showed that this has rarely happened in Southeast Asia. Despite the creation of a variety of institutions post-SARS, when the AI crisis occurred these existing responsive regional mechanisms were not immediately drawn on. Thus, it seems that the type of institution is more important in shaping the typology of the response than the transnational crisis itself.",

To explore and explain the regional and interregional integrative dynamics in a more differentiated typological manner, the underlying factor of resource availability and the previously sketched independent variable of institutional design offer an alternative causality equation. In general, it appears that, in current times of interdependence where the state is still the central player, a neoliberal\u2013institutionalist argument may provide a deeper and more stable foundation for an outlook of regional as well as interregional integrative dynamics both in times of and in absence of crises.",
