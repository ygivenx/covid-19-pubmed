            "text": "To pursue perfection is human (Parens 1998; Keenan 1999). While the definition of perfection may be subjective, humans since time immemorial have sought any advantage to enhance their quality of life and to raise children that are physically and intellectually better than themselves. Thanks to advancements in various fields of science and technology, these pursuits seem more achievable than ever before. One of these advancements is human gene transfer, which involves the transfer of foreign genetic sequences or genetically modified organisms into a human. The purpose of this application is mainly to treat and prevent genetic diseases. Attempts to transfer foreign genes into humans have been done since 1949. One of the first attempts was the use of hepatitis virus in treating Hodgkin disease (Kimmelman 2008). However, an ethical debate regarding human gene transfer research has only seriously surfaced after an attempt made in the early 1970s to cure argininemia by infecting patients with the Shope papilloma virus (Walters 2012). Ethical concerns have been raised not only concerning safety and efficacy but also the possibility of opening the doors of genetic enhancement (Kimmelman 2008).",

            "text": "Human enhancement aims to improve or extend human physical, intellectual, psychological, or moral characteristics beyond a normal range (Peters et al. 2008; Brey 2009). Human genetic enhancement refers particularly to the use of genetic engineering such as germline gene transfer to achieve such purposes (Baylis and Robert 2004; Brey 2009). It may also be achieved through cloning a person with the desired traits (The Witherspoon Council on Ethics and the Integrity of Science 2015). Despite its potential applications, questions of whether we should pursue such applications and what are the fundamental moral principles that should guide our considerations have been raised (Anderson 1989). The benefits of human genetic enhancement appeal to parents and nations alike, further complicating the deliberation of whether to allow or ban such applications. People may hesitate at first, but to have children with enhanced cognitive abilities or other superior traits who may later contribute a lot to the national development is an offer that is hard to resist in today\u2019s competitive world (Gardner 1995). Many have argued that human genetic enhancement is not ethically acceptable (President\u2019s Council on Bioethics 2003; Resnik 2000), while others opine that humans have a moral obligation to enhance themselves and their children (Savulescu 2007). Apart from that, it is difficult to draw a line between the purpose of therapy and enhancement, as therapy may also be considered as a kind of enhancement, and patients undergoing therapy may opt to have enhancement performed as well (Anderson 1989; Parens 1998; Kimmelman 2008; Peters et al. 2008).",

            "text": "We believe that in-depth study on ethics of human genetic enhancement from various perspectives is important in enhancing scientific communication with the public. Such studies also help in developing robust ethical guidelines at both the national and international level. Since such robust guidelines should directly address public concerns and interest (Frewer et al. 1997), gaining insight into public concerns on human genetic enhancement is therefore imperative in understanding their ethical thinking and facilitating further discussion (Dijkstra and Schuijff 2015) and consequently forming the basis of the guidelines. However, research regarding public concern on human genetic enhancement has not yet been conducted in many countries (Dijkstra and Schuijff 2015). In Malaysia, attention has been given to studying the public perception of biotechnology in general and other applications such as genetically modified foods [see Amin et al. (2011)] but not to human genetic enhancement. In terms of available national instruments, specific and clear ethical guidelines on genetic research as well as human genetic enhancement have not yet been developed. Emphasis has been placed on the religious, social, cultural, and ethical values of the Malaysian community as important parts of biological law and regulations such as in the Biosafety (Approval and Notifications) Regulations 2010 (Ramatha and Andrew 2012), yet it is not clear which values will be considered and the extent to which these values influence the governmental view of human genetic enhancement.",

The authors themselves are members of the public; hence, the concerns expressed in the novel may represent the concerns of the public as a whole. The novel gives insights into their concerns and informs public dialogue on many issues (Nathan 2013). Given that genetic enhancement technologies are still largely the domain of science fiction, such novels provide speculative imagination or thought experiments on these technologies, including their ethical and social implications through the rich narratives of the settings, characters, and actions (Van Dijck 1999; Pethes 2005; Smart 2012). By using their imagination about the future, the authors express their hope and fear of science and technology in science fiction novels (Bova 1974; Brem and Anijar 2003). Therefore, science fiction novels are important in enhancing communication between scientists and the public, allowing inclusive ethical dialogue (Delgado et al. 2012).",

Since the discovery of DNA and the genetic code has brought much hope as well as fear to humankind, genetic engineering has become one of the common themes in biological science fictions. One of them is the 1990\u2019s novel Jurassic Park by Michael Crichton, which was adapted into a worldwide blockbuster film in 1993. It tells a story about cloning and genetic engineering of dinosaurs for the purpose of entertaining the public at a zoo (Slonczewski and Levy 2003).",

            "text": "Since these novels depict speculative implications of the new technology on society, they can be used as alternative way to frame ethical concerns. For example, Neuromancer, a novel about human enhancement written by William Gibson, raises ethical questions about what it means to be a human (Delgado et al. 2012). Likewise, Michael Crichton\u2019s novel The Terminal Man raises fear of a technology that has potential to become a threat to humanity. Even though this novel is about artificial intelligence, the issues raised are similar to biotechnology and may have influence on the debate of the latter (Pethes 2005). These novels present hypothetical situations which may allow inclusive and contextualize debates and later can be used as a tool in developing robust guidelines (Delgado et al. 2012). Science fiction novels have an impact on forming public opinion towards bioethical issues, especially on applications that have not yet been realized. Such an influence may even be more influential than the academic discussion on the same matter (Chan 2009). Both proponents and opponents of the new applications sometimes refer to imagery described in science fiction novels in the public debate. Mulkay (1996) explains that negative imagery from the Frankenstein novel was used by the opponents in British Parliament and press to criticize human embryo research. The same imagery was also used by the supporters to explain that the opponent\u2019s argument was weak because the imagery was only fictional and could or should not be used as a justification to ban the research.",

            "text": "Malay science fiction novels emerged relatively later than English science fiction novels. Malay science fiction writing began mostly with the publication of science fiction short stories in teenager\u2019s magazines in 1970s, which later were compiled and published as anthologies (Puteh 1989). The writings were heavily influenced by English science fiction films and the television series at that time (Al-Akiti 2007). Most of the early authors of Malay science fiction novels portrayed stories about adventures of young people. Therefore, Malay science fiction has been perceived as a literary genre suitable only for children and young adults (Puteh 1989). Di.Ar.Ti, a Malay science fiction novel published in 1989, has been recognised as the first novel in such a category that contains a more serious narrative which may also suitable for adult readers (Al-Akiti 2007). Written by Rahmat Haroun, this novel tells a story about a medical doctor who aimed to create a new medical technique to reverse the process of death. This process became known as the Death Reversal Technique. Rahmat Haroun is a medical doctor who has been regarded as the first medical doctor to write Malay novels (Salleh 2008). He has a great interest in the science fiction genre and has published five science fiction novels so far. A few Malaysian publishers have organized science fiction novel writing competitions which have successfully popularised the science fiction genre and increased the number of publications in this genre. Among them are Utusan Publications and Distributors and Penerbit UTM Press, which have jointly organised a Malay science fiction novel writing competition since 2008 (Bakar et al. 2015).",

Islam has a strong influence in their worldview therefore their responses are largely religious. One of the good examples of this are the fatwas produced by the Fatwa Committee of the National Council for Islamic Affairs of Malaysia, a committee that gives opinions regarding religious issues raised by the Muslim community. Its fatwas have touched upon a wide range of bioethical issues including uterine donation and transplantation (Isa et al. 2015; Isa 2016). However it has not yet issued fatwa regarding human genetic enhancement except one fatwa on reproductive cloning in 2002. Reproductive cloning has been declared impermissible by the council because it is against the fitrah (nature) of human creation (Department of Islamic Development Malaysia 2009). These fatwas, nevertheless, are only brief statements answering the questions of whether applications of science and technology are permissible from an Islamic perspective. They usually do not directly expound all of the public concerns that have been taken into considerations in formulating the fatwa. Apart from that, Malaysia has established its National Bioethics Council in 2012 within which the majority of the members are Malays (www.bioetika.gov.my). This council has not yet issued its perspective on human genetic enhancement.",

The story about the royal proposal to the princess can be found in the famous Legend of Puteri Gunung Ledang. Led by Dr. Ching Huat, this project was funded by Datuk Isman Hijjaz who had impatiently sought a cure for his son. The team had found genetically modified mosquitoes in a reserve forest near Mount Ledang. They believed that these mosquitoes were created hundred years ago by the princess. Since seven trays of mosquitoes\u2019 heart were among the seven conditions, they encoded the mosquito\u2019s genetic codes and tried to combine the codes with other species to produce a superb combination.

Given the fact that all the authors are Muslims, such ambivalence may exist because the ethical deliberation is not simply weighing the benefits and harms but must also include religious perspectives. Members of the communities in other parts of the world may also have a similar attitude towards human genetic engineering including genetic enhancement. Previous studies reported that the public predominantly supports the research and recognizes the importance of these applications, but they have also raised concerns from an ethical point of view (Macer 1992; Luj\u00e1n and Moreno 1994; Hampel et al. 2000; Calnan et al. 2005).

This concern has been raised in Klon, Transgenesis Bisikan Rimba and Transgenik Sifar. Advancement of scientific knowledge which allows humans to discover and develop new things, as Klon explains, may become one of the reasons why the scientists tend to play God. Both Klon and Transgenik Sifar depict producing a genetically enhanced human as immoral to some people because it involves changing God\u2019s creation and transgressing His law. In Transgenik Sifar, Haifa, the assigned psychologist for HUMAM, was against the transgenic human project because it was not in harmony with her religious teachings, whereas Dr. LeMarchel, who was an atheist, did not view the project as ethically problematic and found no reason to stop such a project. Yuhori Hajime, the renowned scientist and the founder of the transgenic human project, had a slightly different view whereby he believed that his project could not be seen as immoral because it showed no differences from other scientific innovations such as making artificial rain, which could also be viewed as attempts to transgress the Divine law.",

This may waste resources and inflict harm on research participants as well as the society. In Transgenesis Bisikan Rimba a transgenic human was successfully produced only after 4790 trials. The failure rate was high because Datin Kay tried to use an artificial uterus at first before switching to surrogacy. Thousands of embryos were used in the research and this shows that such research may bring harm to many parties, including the egg providers. This reference to 4790 trials highlights the author\u2019s hope that scientists particularly those who are involved in human research would only use methods that are proven to be safe and efficient.

This can be seen in Transgenesis Bisikan Rimba in which Datin Kay, who was portrayed as a \u2018mad\u2019 scientist in the beginning of the story, later regretted creating a transgenic human and realized that she was merely a scientist that had no power to create a human. This is also expressed through a dialogue in the novel between a supporter and an opponent of human genetic enhancement. The opponent argued that humans are not machines and they are already perfect physically, mentally and emotionally. He insisted that harm will be inflicted upon humankind if the scientists follow their lust to genetically modify human. This lust can only be overcome by having a religious conscience. He said:Whether you want to admit it or not, for me, the only thing keeping scientists from doing destructive things may be religion itself. (translated excerpt from p.274)\n",

Such a belief is common among Muslims whereby they believe that Islam informs scientists about the real purpose of their existence, which prevents them from committing unlawful actions, as well as the real purpose of science to serve humanity (Bakar 2014).",

The amount of the resources used to develop HUMAM in Transgenik Sifar was equal to the amount needed to supply food and clean water for an entire small country. Priority had become a concern in this novel because the world was facing an environmental crisis, and those resources could be used to solve the wider problems. Besides, humans had alternatives to enhance their living conditions such as by building sophisticated machines. Klon also raises the same concern. The Prime Minister in the narrative asked himself difficult questions:\u2026Why it [the advancement in science and technology] is not focusing on finding cure for AIDS, HIV, Ebola, leukemia, avian influenza H1N9, MERS-CoV and so on?
