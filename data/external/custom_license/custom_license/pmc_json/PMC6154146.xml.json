We screened samples for ICV by real-time reverse transcription PCR, as well as for 10 other BRDC-associated pathogens (Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Histophilus somni, Bibersteinia trehalosi, Mycoplasma bovis, bovine viral diarrhea virus, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine respiratory coronavirus, bovine herpesvirus 1, and influenza D virus; Technical Appendix). We sequenced a 590-bp fragment of the matrix gene from 12 ICV-positive samples (GenBank accession nos.
