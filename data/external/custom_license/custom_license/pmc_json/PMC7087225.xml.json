As lipids are major constituents of the cell membrane, it is not surprising that they are implicated in cell entry mechanisms of many viruses such as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), coronavirus, and the Semliki Forest virus (SFV), to name a few [14, 19, 20, 35]. Besides being involved in viral entry at the membrane level, cellular lipids are also essential for many intracellular processes of viral proteins such as post-translational fatty acid modifications (e.g., acylation, myristylation, palmitoylation and prenylation) and also play an important role in enveloped virus assembly and protein trafficking [1, 10, 15, 34].",

            "text": "As lipids are critical to the biology of enveloped viruses, some of these viruses modulate the host-cell lipid metabolism to their advantage, by up- or down-regulating their lipid synthesis [2, 8, 16, 28]. However, recent reports have demonstrated the involvement of lipids in the cell biology of a non-enveloped, double-stranded RNA virus, the rotavirus, as well [3, 5, 6, 13, 33]. Rotavirus belongs to the family Reoviridae and is the leading etiological agent causing viral gastroenteritis in humans and animals [18, 31]. Parashar et al. [32] estimated a mean of 611,000 (range 454,000\u2013705,000) deaths from rotavirus disease worldwide per annum. The role of lipids in rotaviral entry, specific lipid binding of the viral proteins, association of infectious virions or rotaviral proteins within lipid rafts for assembly, and release have all been documented [3\u20136, 13, 17, 29, 33]. Noteworthy among these studies are the ones that clearly underlined the role of lipid rafts in rotavirus biology by demonstrating that the viral proteins as well as the triple-layered infectious particle associate with rafts, both in culture and in cells of experimentally infected animals, and that the assembly of VP4 into the viral particle occurs as an extra-ER event [3\u20136, 33]. Recently Delmas et al. [6] reported distinct differences in raft-type membrane microdomains between Caco-2 cells and another cell line, MA104 (monkey kidney epithelial cells), the two most commonly used cell lines for studying rotavirus replication in vitro. The present study demonstrates the effect of cholesterol depletion on rotavirus titers and assembly in MA104 cells by utilizing lovastatin, which inhibits HMG CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. Our analysis revealed that while the drug treatment apparently reduces rotavirus titers in MA104 cells, transmission electron microscopy showed that the cholesterol-lowering drug has a profound effect on virus assembly and results in accumulation of defective, \u201cempty-looking\u201d particles inside the cell.",

RT-PCR was performed to detect the levels of gene segments coding for one of the rotavirus structural proteins, VP7, and a non-structural protein, NSP4, using appropriate pairs of primers. RNA levels were semi-quantitated by the end-point dilution method. The VP7 RNA segment was amplified using a set of forward (5\u2032-CGCGGATCCGGCTTTAAAGAGAGAATTTCC-3\u2032) and reverse (5\u2032-GATCTCGAGGGTCACATCGAACAATTCTAA-3\u2032) primers, whereas the NSP4 gene was amplified using a set of previously published primers for SA11 [25].",

The analysis indicated that untreated MA104 cells produce, to a large extent, normal virus particles with an electron-dense core (Fig. 4). However, the drug-treated cells had a relatively much lower number of normal virus particles but with an increased number of \u201cempty-looking\u201d particles that lack a characteristic electron-dense core (Fig. 5), suggesting a defect in virus assembly. These empty particles were uniformly sized and were closer in size to the triple-layered rotavirus particle (minus the VP4 spikes), ruling out the possibility that these empty structures could be cellular vesicles.

In this report, to investigate whether there was any difference in the availability of viral structural proteins and the non-structural proteins for virus assembly following lovastatin treatment, we selected VP4, which represents a viral structural protein and NSP2, as a representative non-structural protein, to measure viral protein levels. A reduction in the levels of either of these proteins would have indicated a direct effect on virus assembly and infectivity. However, the present analysis revealed an increase in viral protein levels following lovastatin treatment, which was unexpected and suggested that although the viral proteins were readily available in abundance, due to a mechanism that has not yet been identified, rotaviral assembly was being negatively affected. A very similar effect had been reported previously with Rous sarcoma virus infectivity in cells treated with another lipid-reducing agent, cerulenin [11].

So far, all of these reports have demonstrated the biochemical role of cholesterol in viral entry and association of viral proteins and infectious virions with lipid rafts, but none have conclusively provided visual demonstration of the effect of lipid-lowering drugs on virion assembly. In contrast, the current study presents visual evidence of the effects of cellular lipid-lowering, drug-mediated perturbations in rotavirus biology related to virus assembly.",

Virus was extracted by repeated freeze\u2013thawing, and viral titers were analyzed by fluorescent focus assay (FFA). As shown in the figure, viral titers in the lovastatin-treated group are quite similar to the control group in the initial phase of infection (12\u201324 h). However, by 48 and 72 h there is a drastic reduction, greater than a 2-log difference (P < 0.05), in viral titers in the drug-treated group compared to the control group",
