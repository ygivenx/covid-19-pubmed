Two other similar books followed, that of Metlinger (German) in 1473 and of Roelans (Belgian) in 1483. Eucharius Roesslin (German) opened the 16th Century of pediatric texts with a text on midwifery and pediatrics, with reviews of the 35 most common ailments of children, including many infections, of course (2). The book by Leonellus Faventinus de Victoriis (Italian) was published posthumously in 1544 and included a chapter on aphthae and another on measles and smallpox. The first English-language pediatric book was published in 1544 by Thomas Phaer, \u201cThe Boke of Chyldren\u201d and included chapters on Aposteme of the brayne (meningitis), Scalles of the heed, Styfnesse of the lymmes, Bloodshoten eyes [Kawasaki disease?], Diseases in the eares, Canker in the mouth, Quynsye or swelling of throte, Coughe, Feblenesse of the stomacke and vomiting, Fluxe of the belly (diarrhea), Wormes, Small pockes and measels, Fevers, and Consumpcion (1, 2). In 1553 Giovanne P. Ingrassias (Italian) differentiated scarlet fever (rossalia) from measles (1). Hieronymus Mercurialis (Italian) in 1583 published a pediatric text that mentioned the King's Evil (scrofulous glands) and included 10 chapters on worms (1). At the end of the 16th Century, understanding of disease in children had barely advanced beyond the theories and observations of the Greeks and Romans, restated by the Arab physicians, and clinical observation seemed of little value.",

Several important descriptions of diphtheria (morbo strangulatorio, angina puerorum) were made, with its epidemic nature highlighted by Johannes Sgambatus (Italian) in 1620, its pathologic anatomy in 1646 by Thomas Bartholin (Danish), who also commented on its contagious nature (1), and its method of killing children (paedanchone or child-throttling) by Marcus A.

The third English book appeared in 1664, written by J. Starsmare and included much the same topics but making the first mention in English of scrofula. Franciscus Sylvius de le Boe (Dutch) was a careful clinician and anatomist who published a book on diseases of infants in 1674 that included the usual topics. Sylvius is remembered best for the aqueduct of Sylvius and the sylvian fissure. Thomas Sydenham, the most respected English physician of the 17th Century, deserves mention here for his careful description of chorea (1686), his very detailed description of measles (1670), and his account of scarlet fever (1675), which surprisingly failed to mention pharyngitis. Thomas Willis, who described the circle of Willis, wrote a careful account of pertussis (chincough) in 1675 and said, \u201cThe plan of treatment which is usual in other varieties of cough is seldom of any use in this, which is the reason why old women and gypsies are consulted more often than doctors\u201d(1).",

Epidemics of smallpox, endemic in England through the 17th Century, were described in Massachusetts in 1633 and again in 1677, when about one-fifth of Boston's population succumbed to this scourge (5).

The first recorded North American epidemic of diphtheria occurred in 1659 in Roxbury, MA, with subsequent probable outbreaks documented in 1686 in Virginia and 1689 in New London, CT. Scarlet fever, often mistaken for both measles and diphtheria, was first reported in the colonies by both John Marshall and Cotton Mather, who wrote of an epidemic in Boston from September to December, 1702. The next epidemic in New England did not occur until 1735. Whooping cough caused an extensive epidemic in 1659 in young children, but there are no records of subsequent epidemics until 1738 (5).",

Inoculation with matter from a smallpox subject was introduced into Western Europe from Constantinople around 1720, with limited mortality from the procedure and resulting immunity (1). Other advances were being made as well. Richard Wiseman (English), surgeon to King Charles II, wrote extensively about the King's Evil (scrofula) and mesenteric adenitis. Jean Astruc (French) in 1746 published an English edition of his lectures on diseases of children that included pertussis, infant diarrhea, worms, purulent lung disease, and scrofula. Astruc was among the first to emphasize the importance of a thorough and methodical clinical exam of children.

Early accounts by Jabez Fitch (1736) of New Hampshire and Jonathan Dickinson (1740) described these events (2). Samuel Bard (1742\u20131821), Professor of Medicine at King's College, NY, in 1771 published an important book entitled Enquiry into the Nature, Cause and Cure of the Angina Suffocativa, or Sore Throat Distemper (8). This work about diphtheria emphasized its infective etiology, \u201cdrawn in by the breath of a healthy child,\u201d and urged prevention by immediate removal of the young children in the family as soon as a first case appeared in a household. In 1736 William Douglass (1691\u20131752) of Boston provided what is considered the earliest complete description of scarlet fever, terming it angina ulcusculosa (5). In 1789, Dr. Benjamin Rush (1745\u20131813) described a widespread epidemic of scarlet fever (\u201cscarlatina anginosa\u201d) occurring in Philadelphia in 1783 and 1784, while pertussis was described in detail in 1776 by Lionel Chalmers (1715\u20131777) in An Account of the Weather and Diseases of South Carolina (9).",

Cotton Mather's diary in 1713 recorded the death of his wife, the maid, his neonatal twins, and another child in his family within a 12-d period (5). This serves as a striking reminder about this now-preventable illness. Other primarily pediatric illnesses including thrush, mumps, tinea capitis, and worm infestations also were clearly described in the colonies of the 18th Century (5). In contrast to Europe, where smallpox was an endemic illness of childhood, in the colonies smallpox occurred in large epidemics with about 20-year periodicity and affected children as well as older susceptible individuals. This became an important issue during the Revolutionary War, when the troops of the Continental Army (but not the British forces) were ravaged by smallpox until General George Washington at Valley Forge decided to inoculate all susceptible troops. This act probably saved the war effort (12).",

For example, for the first three decades of the 19th Century, the severity of scarlet fever was less than observed previously but then around 1830 increased dramatically. By 1840 scarlet fever had become the leading cause of death among the infectious diseases of childhood in the U.S., Great Britain, and Europe (13). Changes in the virulence of prevalent Group A streptococcal strains would seem most likely responsible for such fluctuations, as seen in New York City, for example, where only 43 scarlet fever deaths were recorded from 1805\u20131822, but 4874 deaths by 1847 (14).",

This 1828 work built upon that of Bichat and Laennec, who provided the initial scientific basis of medicine, and classified pediatric disorders (including infectious diseases) based not upon symptoms but upon pathologic lesions, i.e. upon autopsy findings (3). Armand Trousseau (French) performed the first tracheostomy in Paris (1831), described laryngeal tuberculosis, cutaneous and mucosal diphtheria, pediatric cholera, and he originated the technique of thoracentesis in pleurisy. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Rilliet (Swiss) wrote on typhoid in children (1840), epidemic measles (1847), mumps (1850), and cholera (1856).

He was the first to teach medicine at the bedside (3). Jacobi is often called the \u201cFather of American Pediatrics\u201d and wrote extensively on a variety of pediatric problems, with his most frequent subjects related to infectious diseases, notably diphtheria. He advocated the use of boiled milk for infants (for nutritional reasons as well as to prevent the gastroenteritides). The inaugural issue of the AMA's American Journal of Obstetrics and Diseases of Women and Children in 1868, the first partially pediatric journal in the U.S., included an article on croup by Jacobi.

Credit for forming the group is given to Job Lewis Smith (1827\u20131897) of Bellevue Medical School and William Booker (1844\u20131921) of Baltimore, the first Clinical Professor of the Diseases of Children at Johns Hopkins. Jacobi was elected the first President, and there were 43 founding members, predominantly from the Northeast, including William Osler, who later served as the fourth APS President (20). Four papers were scheduled to be presented (although it is not clear from the minutes that any of them in fact was presented), including \u201cTreatment of Whooping Cough by Antipyrin\u201d by L. Emmett Holt, Sr., of New York (21). Holt was Professor of Pediatrics at the New York Polyclinic Hospital and Attending Physician at Babies Hospital in New York. He was a Founder of the American Pediatric Society and served as President in 1898 and then again in 1923. Holt's presidential address in 1898 recapped his personal experiences with New York City children's hospitals, pointing out the discouraging 50% mortality for hospitalized infants and the very frequent nosocomial infections that occurred. He advocated care in the country, away from the crowded cities, during the summer months (21). This theme was echoed by Henry Koplik of New York, APS President in 1900, who reported the continued problem of summer diarrhea and recommended ambulatory care and a \u201ccolony or camping system\u201d with care provided by live-in mothers (21).",

Life expectancy around 1888 was less than 50 years, infant mortality approached 200 per 1000 births, and neonatal mortality was about 50 per 1000 births (5, 21, 22). The infant mortality rate in 1880 in New York City, a particularly crowded urban area, was as high as 288 per 1000 live-born infants, primarily related to various infectious processes. Infectious diseases such as diarrhea, diphtheria, scarlet fever and tuberculosis dominated as the major causes of morbidity and mortality among children, and they had yet to be impacted by the just-emerging scientific base of medicine. The science of bacteriology, founded on the landmark discoveries of Louis Pasteur in Paris, Robert Koch in Berlin, and others in the early 1880s, had not yet impacted child health. Roentgen had not yet discovered x-rays. Biochemical analyses were not available for infants and children. Inadequate sanitation, impure water and unsafe milk supplies all contributed very significantly to the spread of infectious diseases among infants and children, and particularly to those living in the very crowded circumstances that promote transmission.",

Diphtheria was of particular concern at the early American Pediatric Society meetings, as the laryngeal form of the disease in that era was almost invariably fatal, despite the use of tracheostomy. The few years just before the founding of the APS and the early years of the organization represented a period of landmark advances in understanding the etiology of this illness and in the development of markedly improved treatment modalities. In 1884 Friedrich Loeffler proved that a specific bacterium was the etiologic agent of diphtheria. The introduction of the O'Dwyer intubation tube in 1885 received great attention because for the first time it enabled successful treatment of the suffocation that was associated with laryngeal diphtheria (23). Joseph O'Dwyer (1841\u20131898), Attending Physician at the New York Foundling Hospital, a facility for unwanted children, was a Founder of American Pediatric Society, and he served as President of APS in 1896 (19). O'Dwyer's 1896 presidential address reviewed his invention and experience with the intubation tube (7, 21).",

This led to the adoption of a formal resolution: \u201cResolved, that, in the opinion of the Society, the evidence thus far produced regarding the effects of diphtheria antitoxin, justifies its further and extensive trial\u201d(7, 19). A committee was apparently appointed, as the 1896 annual meeting included a report from the American Pediatric Society's Collective Investigation of the Antitoxin Treatment of Diphtheria in Private Practice, chaired by L. Emmett Holt. This confirmed the spectacular results of the 1894 French report by Roux, Martin, and Chaillou from the Pasteur Institute in Paris. The 1897 meeting received a report from the Committee on Collective Investigation of the Antitoxin Treatment of Laryngeal Diphtheria in Private Practice, chaired by William P. Northrup (24). These clinical studies of diphtheria equine antitoxin represented the first pediatric investigations in the U.S. of a national scope. The four committee members analyzed 1704 cases of laryngeal diphtheria treated with antitoxin who were submitted by APS members and concluded that antitoxin lowered the necessity for intubation from 90% to 39% and the mortality rate from 73% to 27% in this severest form of diphtheria (24). The Schick test to assess susceptibility to diphtheria was introduced by Bela Schick in 1913. Emil von Behring of Germany, who initially discovered diphtheria toxin and developed the diphtheria antitoxin that was of such great interest and importance, was awarded the first Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1901 for this work.",

Osler's commitment to pediatrics is apparent from his frequent participation in the APS meetings to discuss tuberculosis, pertussis, chorea and carditis, croup, peritonitis and other topics, as well as from the 10% of his writings which are on pediatric subjects. He was particularly interested in tuberculosis of childhood and presented a paper at the third APS meeting in 1891 on pulmonary tuberculosis in children, in which he divided it into acute, subacute, and chronic or protracted forms (20, 25), and another in 1893 that included autopsy findings (7). Papers on childhood tuberculosis were presented at virtually all of the APS scientific meetings during the early decades. Particularly noteworthy milestones included Walter Carr's 1912 presidential address that reported a 71% decline in extrapulmonary tuberculosis, the 1927 report by the Parisian Armand-de Lille of the diagnostic value of gastric aspirates in infants, the 1930 report by Bela Schick and colleagues on the BCG vaccination introduced three years earlier in France, Detroit's Joseph Johnston's discussion in 1936 of the evolution of pediatric TB to the adult type by endogenous reactivation, and the exciting initial report in 1947 by John Lyttle and colleagues from Los Angeles of the recovery of a patient with miliary TB after streptomycin treatment (7).",

He strongly urged milk sterilization and wrote and spoke about the dangers of artificial infant feeding. Bacteriologic studies of milk began to establish a scientific basis for the association of impure milk with infant diarrheal illnesses, including the work of the pediatrician Escherich in 1886, Shiga in 1898, and Flexner in 1900. The genera Escherichia and Shigella (as well as the species Shigella flexneri) honor these pioneer bacteriologists. William D. Booker's major area of interest was summer diarrhea of infancy. He presented a paper at the first APS scientific meeting in 1889 on that topic (7), and he devoted his presidential address in 1901 to the early history of summer diarrhea in America from colonial times (21).",

Many other academics preferred certification as an alternative to pasteurization, fearing that the latter would alter the chemical composition of milk and promote gastroenteritis. This proved wrong (29). Jacobi collaborated with the philanthropist Nathan Straus to establish pasteurization plants and milk stations for poor infants in New York beginning in 1893. A reduction in infant mortality of 65% was observed in just one year in the foundling hospital on Randall's Island after a pasteurization plant was established there by Straus (2, 5). However, it was not until 1908 that Chicago became the first city in the world to require pasteurization of milk, with many cities following thereafter (5). Controversy in this area was apparent early on, best exemplified perhaps by the resignation from the APS in 1892 of Arthur V. Meigs of Philadelphia, who argued vehemently against milk sterilization and who continued to reject the germ theory of disease until his death in 1912 (6, 21).",

Although extremely focused on the biochemical composition of milk, calculating in minute detail the precise amounts of protein, fat and sugar content of milk for infants, he also recognized the importance of a safe milk supply and worked to achieve that goal. The improved milk supply was complemented by studies, primarily at Johns Hopkins, by Holt, James Gamble, W. McKim Marriott, John Howland, and others, that led to understanding the roles of acidosis and dehydration in contributing to the mortality of infants and children with acute diarrhea. This led directly to effective rehydration and correction of electrolyte imbalances in such children with improved outcomes (25).",

As microbiologic advances were made, American Pediatric Society meetings continued to include many papers related to epidemic infectious diseases including summer diarrhea, poliomyelitis, typhoid fever, gonococcal infection, and meningococcal meningitis. Increasingly large U.S. poliomyelitis epidemics occurred, primarily affecting children, for example in New York City in 1907, with almost 3000 cases and up to 12% mortality (7). This peaked in a 1916 epidemic in the Northeast with almost 30,000 cases and 6,000 deaths, many in the New York City area, leading to massive public anxiety and aggressive public health measures including quarantine and travel restrictions (5). Progress in understanding the etiology and pathogenesis of polio was made early in the 20th Century. In Vienna in 1909 Landsteiner and Popper transmitted polio to monkeys by intraperitoneal injection of spinal cord material from a child who died early in the course of polio. Also in 1909 Simon Flexner (of Shigella flexneri fame) and Paul Lewis in New York extended those studies to show transmission to monkeys also after s.c., i.v., or intracerebral routes of inoculation and produced disease using filtrates of nasopharyngeal washes from polio patients (5). Additional Flexner studies from 1910\u20131917 showed that sera from monkeys that recovered neutralized the infectivity of polio material, that intrathecal injection of convalescent sera within 24 h of inoculation prevented paralysis, that recovered monkeys were protected against subsequent inoculation, and that recovered human patient sera contained antibodies to the infectious agent (5). Great effort was devoted by several groups to use intrathecal administration of convalescent polio sera to treat children with acute poliomyelitis but this proved unhelpful (5). The development of the iron lung by Philip Drinker in the late 1920s was a noteworthy therapeutic advance for affected patients.",

Nevertheless, syphilis, tuberculosis, pertussis, measles, rheumatic fever, streptococcal infections, polio, and meningitis continued to interest those caring for children, as reflected by papers presented at the annual APS meetings. Active immunization against diphtheria using toxin and antitoxin was introduced by Alfred Hess in the U.S. in 1916 (7). At the end of this era, a particularly interesting paper was presented in 1937 by Francis Schwentker, who reported the treatment of meningococcal meningitis with s.c. and intrathecal para-aminobenzenesulfonamide (sulfanilamide) (7). The first use of an antimicrobial agent in the U.S. was by future APS President A. Ashley Weech, whose unsuccessful treatment of a physician's child with H. influenzae meningitis with the sulfanilamide-containing compound sulfachrysoidine in 1935 has been well documented (34, 35). The actual administration of this agent was by the Chief Resident at Babies Hospital in New York, F. Howell Wright, who later served as Chair of Pediatrics at the University of Chicago and President and Executive Secretary of the American Board of Pediatrics (35). During this era, several APS presidential addresses concerned infectious disease issues, including that by Linnaeus LaF\u00e9tra in 1918 regarding the need for preventive measures against infectious diseases and rheumatic fever in children two to six years old; by Thomas S. Southworth in 1920 on the communicability of acute pneumonia and the need for isolation of such patients, as was done for tuberculosis patients; by L.

Curiously it was Lawson Wilkins, later known as the father of pediatric endocrinology, who initiated and organized the congenital syphilis clinic as an intern (25). As a discipline, infectious diseases did not figure as prominently as cardiology, endocrinology, neurology and other nascent subspecialty areas under Park's leadership. This theme was replicated in most other academic departments as subspecialization began to develop. A few exceptions were pediatricians known for their expertise in contagious diseases, some of whom were particularly interested in vaccine development. These included Bela Schick at Mt. Sinai and at Albert Einstein in New York, Hattie Alexander and Horace Hodes at Columbia University, Joseph Stokes at University of Pennsylvania, Russell Blattner at Baylor, William Bradford at Rochester, Amos Christie at Vanderbilt, Katherine Dodd at Vanderbilt and Cincinnati, Edith Lincoln at New York University, Louis Sauer at Evanston, IL, and John Zahorsky in St. Louis.",

A few vaccines had been introduced, but antibiotic therapy was limited to the early use of sulfanilamide. At the 50th annual meeting of APS in 1938, the first held in conjunction with the young Society for Pediatric Research (SPR), important papers presented included that of Trask and Paul, reporting the isolation of poliovirus from nasal washes and stools of asymptomatic patients, several related to the pathogenesis of pertussis, that of Lyttle showing elevated ASO titers in acute glomerulonephritis, Hodes' report of an irradiated rabies vaccine, and Stokes' isolation of various strains of influenza virus.

This occurred after the American Medical Association House of Delegates severely chastised the Pediatric Section of the AMA for taking pro-active stances favoring the Sheppard-Towner Act, which supported maternal and child health. Isaac Abt of Chicago became the first President of the AAP, which had 304 charter members and held its first meeting in Atlantic City, NJ, on June 12\u201313, 1931 (7). Early in its existence, the AAP declared its interest and involvement in infectious diseases issues. The AAP established a Special Committee on Prophylactic Procedures Against Communicable Diseases in 1933, chaired by Edward B. Shaw of San Francisco and including J.E. Gordon of Detroit and J.A. Toomey of Cleveland. This committee was disbanded after its report \u201cRoutine Measures for the Prophylaxis of Communicable Diseases\u201d was published in The Journal of Pediatrics in April 1935 (36). This six-page report dealt with diphtheria, scarlet fever, typhoid fever, whooping cough, measles, smallpox, polio (3 lines), epidemic meningitis (1 line), mumps and chickenpox (4 lines), rabies, and tetanus. The Committee on Immunization Procedures was then established in 1936, with John A. Toomey as chair. Three years later the committee name was changed again to the Committee on Immunizations and Therapeutic Procedures for Acute Infectious Diseases, in 1953 it was modified again to the Committee on Control of Infectious Diseases, and then in 1969 to the Committee on Infectious Diseases, the current name, although it is now most commonly referred to as the Red Book Committee. Since 1938, this AAP committee has published a report every one to five years (every three years for the past five editions), which because of the color of its binding has been known as the Red Book for many editions. The 26th edition of this document, the closest thing to a Bible (albeit frequently revised) in the field of pediatric infectious diseases, was published in 2003. Chairs of the Committee on Infectious Diseases and editors of the committee reports (the Red Books) have included John A. Toomey, John R. Miller, Jr., Aims C. McGuinnes, Edward C. Curnen, Jr., Alex J. Steigman, Lewis L. Coriell, Franklin H. Top, Margaret H. D. Smith, Samuel L. Katz, Martha D. Yow, Vincent A. Fulginiti, Edward A. Mortimer, Jr., Jerome O. Klein, Philip A. Brunell, Georges Peter, Stanley A. Plotkin, Caroline B. Hall, Neal A. Halsey, John S. Abramson, Larry K. Pickering, and Margaret B. Rennels. In 1990 the AAP established the Section on Infectious Diseases, which has assumed major responsibility for developing educational infectious diseases programs for the general membership of the AAP. Chairs of the SOID have included David Lang, Stanford Shulman, and Ellen Wald.",

The period from 1945 to about 1965 heralded the era of modern infectious diseases and coincided with the increasing trend to subspecialization within pediatrics and the development of full-time pediatric departments. Antimicrobial advances included the discoveries of streptomycin, isoniazid and then other agents to treat tuberculosis, as well as penicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin and other antibiotics for treatment of bacterial infections. Virtually universally fatal infections such as bacterial meningitis and endocarditis became amenable to therapy. American Pediatric Society presidential addresses during this period that dealt with infectious diseases topics included that by Jean V. Cooke in 1949 discussing the impact of specific therapy including antimicrobials upon the common contagious diseases and reviewing mortality statistics from 1930\u20131945; by Hugh McCulloch in 1952 on progress in prevention and treatment of rheumatic fever; by A. Ashley Weech in 1958 on milestones in scientific pediatrics, including the conquest of infectious diseases and the development of antibiotics; and by Joseph Stokes Jr. in 1959 regarding airborne infections and their prevention (7). This era was associated with the virtual elimination of congenital syphilis, early studies of bacterial resistance to antibiotics, improved methods of viral cultivation, but also large poliomyelitis epidemics.",

Margaret H. D. Smith (1977) worked tirelessly in the field of pediatric tuberculosis and advocated for social activism by organized pediatrics. C. Henry Kempe (1978) was instrumental in the eradication of smallpox, and Floyd Denny (1981) contributed to the understanding of group A streptococci and to the conquest of rheumatic fever. During this era, infections in the immunocompromised child began to emerge as an important clinical problem, as increasing numbers of cancer patients and other compromised patient populations were generated by improved treatment modalities (37), and these were accompanied by increasing numbers of opportunistic viral, fungal and bacterial infections requiring expert management.",

In other areas of the world, where anti-retroviral therapy during pregnancy is not being utilized, vertical transmission of HIV continues unabated. In recent years, in the U.S., the field of pediatric AIDS has focused increasingly upon prevention and treatment of adolescent HIV infection as well as upon the highly effective multi-drug therapies.",
