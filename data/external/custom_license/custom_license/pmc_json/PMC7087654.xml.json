These two epidemics have also reemphasized the importance of zoonotic origins for many emerging infectious diseases (Desselberger, 2000; Weiss, 2001). SARS is one of a number of recent examples of emergent zoonotic diseases where wild, nondomesticated species have been highlighted in the search for animal origins (Guan et al., 2003; Lau et al., 2005) The list of infectious diseases thought to have their origin in wildlife encompasses some of the most feared diseases including Ebola virus, Lassa virus, hanta virus, bubonic plague, and human immunodeficiency virus (Weiss, 2001). Indeed, in a review of human infectious agents, it was found that emerging infections were more likely to be viral and more likely to be zoonotic than bacterial or protozoal pathogens (Woolhouse et al., 2001; Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria, 2005).",

We have recently raised the hypothesis that the international, and often illegal, wildlife trade may have been a significant factor in the emergence of SARS (Bell et al., 2004). In this article, we further highlight the risks posed to human health by the wildlife trade and hypothesize that this risk may be increasing. We demonstrate how local biodiversity loss and increasing rates of animal trafficking and trade may increase the probability of global epidemics such as SARS.",

May (1988) drew attention to the low number of microbes described but was uncertain if this reflected under-recording or \u201creal\u201d low species richness. Colwell et al. (1994) suggested that just 1% of an estimated 5 \u00d7 105 viral species has been described. Although there have been some subsequent attempts to catalogue viral biodiversity at a local scale (Sabatini et al., 1965), accurate estimates, of both total viral diversity and the proportion of microbial biodiversity potentially infectious for humans, remain elusive (Wilson, 1992). However, it is likely that most of the, as yet undescribed, viruses are restricted to equatorial regions. Hunter and Izsak (1993) and, subsequently, Guernier et al. (2004) found a latitudinal gradient in diversity of human infectious diseases in parallel with that observed for most taxa (Pianto, 1967; Rosenzweig, 1995).",

For example, in one wildlife market in Equatorial Guinea between 1991 and 1996, while the number of carcasses entering the market increased by 60% over that period, the accompanying increase in biomass was only 12.5% (Fa et al., 2000). Consequently, any person involved in the hunting or processing of wildlife within such a trade system may have to capture/prepare greater numbers of individuals from an increasing range of species.",

In Southeast Asia, where the trade is predominantly of live animals, the demand for wildlife in traditional medicine, wildlife restaurants, and the pet trade poses a threat both to the persistence of viable populations of over-harvested species and potentially to human health (Li and Li, 1998; Gonzalez, 2003; Duarte-Quiroga and Estrada, 2003). In Vietnam, for example, the shift from subsistence hunting to sales in the wildlife trade for species such as civets, wild pig, deer, porcupine, and snakes appears to have been driven by increased market prices and increased national and international demand (Roberton et al., 2003).",

In what follows, we will assume that the rate of host recovery is the same for each pathogen so that the transmission coefficient is, in effect, scaled to account for host recovery. This alleviates the need to introduce additional, possibly flawed, assumptions about the distribution of the recovery rate and its independence or otherwise of the transmission rate. Hence, the number of infections secondary to the index case is R\n0 = \u03b2X.\n",

It is reasonable to assume that transmission rates (and so \u03b2) will be greatest in areas of high population density and where reliance on public transport is heaviest. Furthermore, Antia et al.

However, as the number and diversity of wild animals entering the wildlife trade increases, the probability that urban dwellers are exposed to infected animals increases. Consequently, the risk of transmission from infected animals to susceptible urban dwellers also increases. Once such a transmission event occurs, the probability of a subsequent outbreak with epidemic potential is substantially greater in the urban compared to the rural setting, as there is a higher concentration of people with lower levels of immunity living in close proximity.",

We have shown that an increase in hunting pressure and concomitant change in hunter-capture profiles may lead to an increased risk of outbreak. We also suggest that the sale and transport of wildlife away from rural communities will further increase the probability of epidemic spread and will be the most important factor in increasing risk of human epidemics. Efforts to reduce the probability of novel infections emerging from wildlife trade should be directed at regulating and reducing, or even eliminating, this often illegal trade, especially that into urban environments and across international borders.",
