For a lag of 5 days, the credible interval of Rt was wide when <20 cases were detected (periods 0<t<20 and t>63), but was relatively narrow when more cases were detected (period 21<t<62). As expected, the width of the credible interval narrowed as the lag increased and more complete data were available. The expectations and credible intervals were very similar for lags of 10 and 20 days, 67.8th and 99.7th percentiles, respectively, of the distribution of the SARS generation interval described by Lipsitch et al.

The list of communicable diseases that could be monitored is therefore relatively large, although it does not include diseases such as influenza, for which the proportion of asymptomatic or unreported cases may be large. In practice, the delay until estimates of the reproduction number become reliable will depend critically on the generation interval distribution. For SARS, when the reproduction number was constant over time, our real-time estimates were almost unbiased after only 1 day. With the original estimator of Wallinga and Teunis (2), which is not intended for real-time estimation, downward bias would be a concern for at least 2 weeks after observation. However, real-time estimates obtained for recent days displayed wide 95% credible intervals and zero-width intervals when no cases had been observed or reported for a few days. Here, owing to the relatively short generation interval of SARS (mean 8.4 days) (3), reliable estimates were obtained after only 5 days, albeit with wide credible intervals, and they were consolidated after 10 days. These lags corresponded to the 20th and 70th percentiles of the SARS generation interval (3). When the generation interval doubled, the time delay required to detect the effect of control measures implementation or to consolidate estimates roughly doubled.",

Furthermore, the generation interval may decrease during the course of the outbreak because of quicker interventions, leading to possible bias in the estimates of R (2). Further developments of the method could take these issues into consideration. For example, one could use information on traced cases as it accrues to sequentially estimate the generation interval.
