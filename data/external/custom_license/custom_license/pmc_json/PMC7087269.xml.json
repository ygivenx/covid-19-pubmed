RSV infection is associated with a high rate of morbidity and mortality in children aged < 5 years with acute lower respiratory infections (ALRIs) in both industrialised and developing countries [2\u20134]. RSV also is an important virus in adults, causing 25% of lethal respiratory infections in cold seasons, similar to the rate for seasonal influenza [5]. Globally, studies have shown an RSV-associated mortality rate of about 26.5 cases per 100,000 persons/year among adults aged > 65 years [6].\n\n",

            "text": "RSV is a member of the genus Orthopneumovirus, family Pneumoviridae. It has a nonsegmented, negative-sense RNA genome of approximately 15,200 nucleotides encoding 11 structural and non-structural proteins [7]. Of these proteins, the G protein, a type of II attachment glycoprotein of about 300 amino acids in length, is the most variable and is responsible for the differences between RSV genotypes. The G protein has two hypervariable regions, and the C-terminal region (the second hypervariable region) contains strain-specific epitopes [7\u20139]. According to the reactivity of RSV with monoclonal antibodies against G glycoprotein, the virus is divided into two major antigenic groups: group A and group B [10, 11]. The RSV-A group is further subdivided into 11 genotypes, GA1-GA7, SAA1, NA1-, NA2 and ON1 [12\u201314], and the RSV-B group is subdivided into 23 genotypes: GB1-GB4, SAB1-SAB3, SAB4, URU1, URU2, BA1-BA12, and THB [12, 15\u201321]. This strain variation allows the virus to evade the host\u2019s immune responses, which contribute to the capability of the virus to cause frequent re-infections and epidemics and creates a challenge for vaccine development [22]. Therefore, it is of great importance to identify the genotypes circulating in the population.",

The present study is the first to investigate the frequency and genetic variability of RSV group A and group B in patients with ARTI in Kuwait. A total of 305 samples from ARTI patients, including infants, children and adults, were collected, and 77 (25.2%) of the patients were found to be positive for RSV by multiplex real-time PCR. Our results, which demonstrated the predominance of the RSV-A group over the RSV-B group in the clinical samples, are in agreement with the findings of the majority of the studies on the epidemiology of RSV genotypes [23, 25\u201330]. We found that most of the patients had RSV single infections, while 17 (22%) had mixed infections of RSV and other respiratory viruses. Furthermore, we found that coinfections with RSV and rhinovirus were the most commonly detected mixed infections among the patients \u2013 a finding consistent with those of previous studies [31\u201334]. These coinfections may influence the severity of respiratory disease in patients with RSV infection. Calvo et al. showed that coinfection with RSV and other respiratory viruses did not result in greater severity of disease, but did result in mixed clinical features [31]. Goka et al. on the other hand, demonstrated an increased risk of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and death as a result of coinfection with RSV and other respiratory viruses [35]. In this study, however, we were unable to investigate the association between RSV groups or coinfections on the severity of the RSV respiratory diseases due to the lack of clinical data for the patients.",

            "text": "Since little is known about the distribution of RSV infection in different age groups, in this study we analysed the age distribution of the patients with RSV infections. Our results showed that infants less than one year of age represented that largest proportion of patients with RSV infections (66%), followed by children between one and five years old (17%). The prevalence decreased to 3% in children between six and 13 years old and further decreased to only 1% in children and adults between 14 to 28 years old. Many other studies have also demonstrated a high incidence of RSV infection and disease among infants less than one year old [36, 37]. a recent epidemiological meta-analysis study implicated RSV as one of the most significant pathogens of early childhood and placed it as the second-most-likely single pathogen to cause death in children less than one year of age [38\u201340]. Although there is evidence that maternal antibodies in infants are likely to be important in protection against RSV disease, severe disease was noted in children under six months of age, indicating that maternal RSV-specific antibodies are protective during the first 6-7 months, but this protection may then wane [41]. There are other risk factors known to predispose infants to RSV-associated disease, including physical and immunological immaturity, which causes infants younger than three months to be the most susceptible to severe disease. Also, the size of the airway is specifically problematic in neonates and young infants because obstruction from sloughed epithelium, fibrin, inflammatory debris, and mucus is a significant factor in disease pathogenesis. In fact, the period after birth is critical in the development of the lung architecture and cellular functions, including the development of immunological effector mechanisms to deal with commensal and pathogenic microorganisms [42\u201344]. It has been shown that an immune system that is weak in the early years will mature sooner when children are re-infected for the second or third time [45]. Our results showed that the prevalence of RSV infection reached 10% in patients > 60 years old, whose immune response is weakened by age. Similar observations have been made in other studies [46\u201350]. Researchers have found that infants infected with RSV develop maternal antibodies that recognise both the F and G proteins. However, in older infants, there is a dramatic increase in antibodies recognizing the G protein, while infection provokes only a modest increase in antibodies against the F protein. It was also shown that antibodies against the F protein continue to increase with age, whereas those against the G protein decrease [51].",

Many studies have shown that RSV infection in non-tropical countries occurs almost year-round and peaks mainly during winter [47, 52\u201354], which is different from what has been reported in tropical countries [55]. In our study, however, RSV infection was detected in patients in autumn to spring (November to February) but peaked in winter (January), a result that is in coordinance with studies conducted in non-tropical countries. The cold and sometimes dry conditions of the winter season in Kuwait favour survival of RSV in the environment and encourage people to crowd together indoors, which may increase the chance of parents and older siblings acquiring RSV infection and passing it on to infants in the home. Also, the cold and relative humidity conditions in winter might delay the drying of large respiratory droplets, which could favour RSV survival and transmission, since RSV is predominantly transmitted through large droplets [56].",

Furthermore, the data showed that these Kuwaiti strains formed different clusters of identical sequences. These data indicate that there is heterogeneity among the Kuwaiti strains, which differ from the known RSV-A genotypes. One can speculate that these are new strains or that they originate through recombination of other known strains. Whole-genome sequencing of these isolates is necessary to address this question. Although they were untyped, RSV-A Kuwaiti strains in cluster 5 (Fig. 3A) were more closely related to the new RSV-A/ON1 genotype than the rest of the Kuwaiti strains according to the percentage of differences in the nucleotide sequences. RSV-A/ON1 is novel genotype that was first described by Eshaghi et al. in Ontario, Canada [57], and this strain later emerged and became the dominant genotype in different countries, including northern Italy, Germany, Thailand, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia [16, 19, 30, 47, 54, 58\u201361]. A further significant result is that the two Kuwaiti strains (KW-1411 and KW-827) were more closely related to the RSV-A/NA1 strain than other Kuwaiti strains based on pairwise nucleotide distances. The RSV-A/NA1 genotype and the NA2 genotype are new variants of A2 genotype that caused large epidemics in Japan during the 2005-2006 and 2006-2007 seasons because of the lack of immunity in the children [62]. Also, the AN1 genotype was a dominated genotype in India among children < 6 years old during the period 2009-2012 [28] and in Italy among children < 3 years old during 2006-2012 [63]. Moreover, between October and December 2014, NA1 and ON1 genotypes of group A RSV dominated in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, among children less than five years of age with ARI symptoms [30].",

RSV-B/BA genotypes emerged in the late 1990s and then spread globally and became the predominant genotypes [64]. Many studies have divided members in the BA clade into 13 different genotypes. However, other studies disagree on the total number of genotypes because they use different reference sequences for the genotypes. Therefore, there is overlap between genotypes, as evidenced by a partial CDS tree [65]. In our study, in the phylogenetic tree, we used different BA reference sequences that represented BA1 to BA10, and it was easily to identify the BA10 strains in particular. Previous studies have also demonstrated the predominance of RSV-B/BA genotypes, which is in line with our findings [17, 19, 25, 66, 67]. Interestingly, some reports have shown that genotype BA had replaced other prevailing genotypes in certain places, such as Argentina and India [21, 23]. It has been speculated that antigenic changes in the G protein and the evasion of host immune responses had led to the selective advantage of genotype BA viruses over other RSV-B genotypes [21].",

Sequence analysis of the circulating strains demonstrated the predominance of the RSV-A group over the RSV-B group in these patients. Additionally, the circulating RSV-A strains were untyped strains, indicating heterogenicity among group A RSV strains. On the other hand, most of the strains of the RSV-B group belonged to the BA10 genotype, showing the predominance of this genotype among patients with ARTI in Kuwait. We are firmly recommending whole-genome sequencing of the untyped Kuwaiti strains for full strain characterisation, which will be accomplished in the next project. Further surveillance and sequencing of RSV strains are required to determine if these untyped Kuwaiti strains are still circulating in this region and if the dominance of certain RSV genotypes over others is sustained over time or fluctuates from year to year. The knowledge obtained in the study may be beneficial for the development of a future vaccine against RSV.",
