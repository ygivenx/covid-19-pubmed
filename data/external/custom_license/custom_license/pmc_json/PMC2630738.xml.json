These novel viruses were related to other recently described HRVs: HRV\u2013QPM detected in specimens from Australia (4), C024\u2013C026 detected in specimens from Hong Kong (6), and NAT001 and NAT045 detected in specimens from California (8) (Figure).

One of the strains (GA23592) was almost identical in partial VP1 sequence to C026 (Figure).

Lower FEV1 with genogroup C infection than with other HRVs suggests a potentially greater severity of asthma exacerbation in patients infected with these HRVs. When one considers the great variation among HRV serotypes in levels of sensitivity to candidate antiviral compounds (12,13), genogroup-related differences in associated disease patterns have implications for clinical management of HRV infections in asthma patients and for development of antiviral drugs against HRVs. Preliminary data suggest that HRV-QPM and related HRV-C strains from Hong Kong share certain VP1 sequence characteristics with HRVs that are resistant to a candidate antipicornavirus drug, pleconaril (4,6,13). These data raise the possibility that these novel HRVs might also be resistant to this compound.",
