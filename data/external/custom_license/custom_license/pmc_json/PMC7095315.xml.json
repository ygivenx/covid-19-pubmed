It is regulated by the opposing actions of two key carboxypeptidases, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 (refs 4, 6, 7). In addition to its catalytic activity, we and others have recently found that ACE2 associates with the neutral amino acid transporter B0AT1 and that ACE2 is required for expression of this transporter on the luminal surface of intestinal epithelial cells8,9. Variants in the gene that encodes B0AT1 (SLC6A19) have been identified as a cause of Hartnup\u2019s disease10, a rare autosomal recessive disorder associated with pellagra-like symptoms including diarrhoea that manifests under conditions of malnutrition11. However, the in vivo function of ACE2 in the gut epithelium remained to be investigated.",

When we challenged such mice with dextran sodium sulphate (DSS), an irritant that disrupts the intestinal epithelial barrier and results in colitis12, a profoundly increased inflammatory reaction was observable compared to wild-type littermates. We detected an enhanced infiltration of inflammatory cells, significant shortening of the colon length, increased intestinal bleeding, crypt damage, weight loss and severe diarrhoea, resulting in an overall increased disease activity13 (Fig. 1a\u2013c, Supplementary Fig. 1). Similar results were obtained using trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis (Supplementary Fig. 2). Thus, genetic inactivation of the key RAS enzyme ACE2 results in severe colitis following intestinal injury. We note that Ace2 deficiency was investigated in male mice (Ace2\u2212/y, the Ace2 gene being located on the X chromosome) throughout this study, however, we observed a similar phenotype in female Ace2\u2212/\u2212 mice (not shown).",

            "text": "To test whether the severe colitis phenotype is due to the catalytic activity of ACE2, we treated mice with recombinant soluble ACE2 (rsACE2). We and others have shown that rsACE2 rescues virtually all previously reported in vivo ACE2 functions within the RAS system3,14. As it lacks the transmembrane domain, soluble ACE2 cannot associate with the neutral amino acid transporter B0AT1 and thus cannot stabilize its cell-surface localization8. Treatment of mice with rsACE2 did not rescue the severe DSS-induced colitis phenotype of Ace2 mutant mice (Supplementary Fig. 3a\u2013h). One in vivo consequence of Ace2 deletion within the RAS is accumulation of angiotensin II (ANGII), which then primarily acts on the G-protein-coupled AT1a receptor (Agtr1a)3. We indeed observed increased AngII levels in the colon of DSS-treated Ace2 mutant mice that were reduced to background levels after treatment with rsACE2 (Supplementary Fig. 3i). To rule out the possibility that locally increased AngII might cause severe colitis, we generated Agtr1a\u2212/\u2212Ace2\u2212/y mice. Deletion of Agtr1 did not rescue the severe DSS-induced colitis (Supplementary Fig. 4), indicating that these effects are independent of the classical RAS system. In addition to cleaving AngII, ACE2 exhibits catalytic activity towards a second peptide system, Apelin15. However, DSS-induced colitis was not altered in mice carrying genetic mutations in Apelin (Supplementary Fig. 5) or its receptor Apj (Supplementary Fig. 6). Thus, the catalytic activity of ACE2, essential for its function in the RAS and Apelin cleavage, has no overt role in DSS-induced intestinal inflammation.",

TLR1\u20139 mRNA levels in jejunum, ileum, and colon were largely similar in Ace2 deficient and wild-type mice, with the exception of TLR5 and TLR9 in the colon (Supplementary Fig. 7). Transplantation of bone marrow from Ace2 mutant mice (knock-out, KO) into wild-type (WT) mice (KO\u2192WT) did not result in any obvious effect on DSS-induced colitis as compared to WT\u2192WT transplant recipients. By contrast, reconstitution of Ace2 mutant mice with WT bone-marrow (WT\u2192KO) led to an increased severity of DSS-induced colitis that was indistinguishable from the KO\u2192KO control group (Supplementary Fig. 8). Thus, ACE2 exerts its role on intestinal inflammation in non-haematopoietic cells.",

ACE levels were slightly, albeit not significantly, increased in the jejunum of Ace2\u2212/y mice (Supplementary Fig. 9c, d). As reported previously8, protein expression of the neutral amino acid transporter B0AT1 was absent in the small intestine of Ace2 mutant mice, whereas mRNA expression was not affected (Supplementary Figs 9e, f and 11a). Owing to the lack of intestinal B0AT1 protein expression, serum levels of the neutral amino acids valine (Val), threonine (Thr) and tyrosine (Tyr), and the essential amino acid tryptophan (Trp) were markedly reduced in Ace2\u2212/y mice (Supplementary Fig. 11b).

Inactivation of collectrin in mice (Tmem27\u2212/\u2212) results in a near complete downregulation of apical amino acid transporters such as B0AT1 in the kidney, thereby regulating renal amino acid re-absorption19. By contrast, ACE2 associates with B0AT1 on the luminal surface of intestinal epithelial cells, that is, ACE2 and B0AT1 regulate the uptake of neutral amino acids in the intestine where collectrin is not expressed (Supplementary Figs 11a, c and 12). In both Tmem27\u2212/\u2212 and Ace2\u2212/y mutant mice, tryptophan is reduced in the serum (Supplementary Fig 11b, and ref. 19). To test whether impaired re-absorption of amino acids in the kidney might also result in altered susceptibility to colitis, we challenged Tmem27\u2212/\u2212 mice with DSS. However, genetic ablation of Tmem27 did not affect DSS-induced colitis (Supplementary Fig. 13). Although genetic inactivation of both Ace2 or Tmem27 result in a similar deregulation of amino acids in the serum, functionally only the loss of ACE2 affects the susceptibility to intestinal inflammation.",

To test this hypothesis, we fed Ace2 mutant and control mice a protein free-diet (PFD) to eliminate dietary amino acids and challenged these mice with DSS at a dose (1%) that triggers only very mild colitis. Basal weight loss was comparable among control and Ace2 mutant mice during the period of the PFD (Supplementary Fig. 14a). Moreover, average food intake did not show a significant difference between Ace2 deficient and control mice fed PFD or normal chow (Supplementary Fig. 14b). Importantly, PFD markedly worsened DSS-triggered colitis in wild-type mice to levels seen in Ace2 mutants (Fig. 1d\u2013f; Supplementary Fig. 14c\u2013g).

We, therefore, set out to define whether a specific amino acid might be responsible for the severe inflammatory phenotype. Because serum tryptophan was markedly decreased in Ace2 mutant mice, we focused on this essential amino acid. Tryptophan is required for the in vivo generation of nicotinamide (also known as vitamin B3 or niacin)17, and insufficient niacin or tryptophan in the diet is the cause of pellagra, a disease still endemic in many countries with protein malnutrition20. More than 90% of pellagra patients develop colitis11 and for nearly 80 years nicotinamide has been used as treatment for pellagra. In Ace2 mutant mice, nicotinamide almost completely alleviated the severe colitis and diarrhoea (Fig. 2a-c; Supplementary Fig. 15). To demonstrate that the severe colitis in Ace2 deficient mice is due to impaired tryptophan uptake, we provided tryptophan in form of a Gly-Trp dipeptide to bypass the loss of the single amino acid transporter B0AT1. Dietary dipeptidic tryptophan (a Trp+ diet) restored serum tryptophan levels (Supplementary Fig. 16a) and rescued the enhanced DSS-susceptibility of Ace2\u2212/y mice (Fig. 2d\u2013f; Supplementary Fig. 16b\u2013d). A tryptophan-free (Trp\u2212) diet resulted in a very marked increase in susceptibility to DSS-induced inflammation (Supplementary Fig. 17a\u2013h). In addition, a Trp\u2212 diet markedly worsened weight loss in wild-type mice challenged with TNBS (Supplementary Fig. 17i\u2013l). Our results show that deficiency of Ace2 causes a critical impairment of local tryptophan homeostasis which alters the susceptibility to intestinal inflammation.",

A similar reduction of mTOR activity was recently reported in mice lacking B0AT1 (ref. 24). Administration of a Trp+ diet resulted in increased mTOR activity in the small intestine of Ace2 mutant mice (Fig. 3e). In vivo inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin in wild-type mice resulted in a significant downregulation of antimicrobial peptide expression, an effect that could not be rescued by nicotinamide (Supplementary Fig. 22a). Moreover, administration of rapamycin before the first challenge with DSS increased the severity of colitis (Fig. 3f; Supplementary Fig. 22b\u2013h). Notably, although acute mTOR inhibition may have beneficial effects in murine colitis models25, mTOR blockade has not been proven successful in human clinical trials in inflammatory bowel disease26.

It has been shown that \u03b1-defensins secreted into the ileum lumen persist in a functional state throughout the entire gut27 and that alterations in antimicrobial peptides can affect the ecology of the small and large bowel microbiota28. We therefore performed deep profiling of the intestinal microbiome of Ace2 mutant and wild-type littermates using 16S rDNA fingerprinting. The luminal ileocaecal microbiome of Ace2 mutant mice was markedly altered, as shown by weighted (Bray\u2013Curtis) (Fig. 4a) and unweighted (Unifrac) (Fig. 4b) analyses. Distinct operational taxonomical units (OTUs) are overrepresented in Ace2 mutant mice (Fig. 4c; Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). Rapamycin treatment resulted in a distinct alteration of the ileocaecal gut microbiome in wild-type animals; but the altered microbiome was more closely related to that found in untreated wild-type animals than that found in untreated Ace2\u2212/y animals (Supplementary Fig. 23; Supplementary Tables 3 and 4). Rapamycin acts on many different cell types that in addition to the changes in intestinal epithelial cells could alter microbiota composition29. Importantly, both Trp+ diet and nicotinamide treatment reverted the composition of the intestinal microbiota of Ace2 mutant mice to be more similar to that of untreated wild-type littermates (Fig. 4a\u2013c, Supplementary Fig. 24, Supplementary Tables 1, 2, 5 and 6).

Whether pathways other than mTOR and antimicrobial peptides also contribute to the altered microbiome needs to be explored. Our results further indicate that under conditions of intestinal injury, such an altered microbiome contributes to the severity of colitis.

Our data also identify a molecular crosstalk between the RAS system and intestinal amino acid homeostasis via ACE2\u2014and provide a direct link between dietary amino acid metabolism and innate immunity, the composition of the intestinal microbiota, and susceptibility to colitis.",

For mixed C57BL/6 \u00d7 CBA background mice, colitis was induced by feeding mice 5% (w/v) DSS. The DSS solutions were made fresh every day. TNBS colitis was induced by intrarectal administration of 0.1 ml TNBS (5 mg per mouse in 40% ethanol), through a feeding needle (Fine Science Tools) 3.5 cm proximal to the anal verge as described previously34. Body weight, diarrhoea, and occult blood in stool (Hemoccult test) were determined daily. Diarrhoea scores were: 0, no diarrhoea; 1, mild diarrhoea; 2, severe watery diarrhoea; 3, mild diarrhoea with blood; 4, severe watery diarrhoea with blood. Colon length was determined at the end of the experiments. Crypt scores, inflammation scores, and disease activity indexes were determined as previously described13. For PFD experiment, normal chow (20.8% protein) and PFD (<0.2% protein) were obtained from Ssniff GmbH. Mice were fed the protein-free, isocaloric diet for 3 days before start of the 1% (w/v) DSS treatment. Owing to the severe diarrhoea in PFD fed mice, the experiment had to be stopped for ethical reasons on day 4. For nicotinamide (NAM) treatment, mice were given NAM (Sigma) in their drinking water (0.4 g l\u22121) from 3 days before the first DSS treatment until the end of the experiment. For rapamycin (RAPA) treatment, rapamycin (2 mg kg\u22121 d\u22121; LC Laboratories) or vehicle were administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) daily for 6 days with or without NAM treatment. The solvent for rapamycin was 0.2% sodium carboxymethylcellulose, 0.25% polysorbate-80 in water. For tryptophan rescue experiments, standard food was supplemented with glycyl-l-tryptophan (Gly-Trp) hydrate (G0144, TCI Europe) (10 mg per g dry food) daily for 10 days followed by 1.5% (w/v) DSS treatment. Tryptophan-free diet was purchased from Oriental Yeast and was fed for 18 days before DSS challenge.

For microbiota transplantation, caecal and ileum extracts were pooled from Ace2 mutant mice and ACE2 expressing littermates, suspended in 3 ml PBS, and administered (0.1 ml per mouse) immediately to sterile-packed 4-week-old Swiss-Webster germ-free mice (Taconic). Transplanted mice were maintained in sterile cages for 2 weeks followed by 5% (w/v) DSS treatment.

In order to reduce the overestimation of distances between sequences, leading and trailing periods from aligned files were removed. Pairwise distances between sequences were calculated, gaps of any length were treated as single event or mismatch. Sequences with \u226597% similarity were clustered using average neighbour algorithm in to species level operational taxonomical units (OTUs)41. Phylogenetic affiliation of each OTU was performed by using RDP taxonomy and a template file. To visualize the microbial composition and structure in related on host genotype or treatment, distance matrices between samples were generated based on weighted (Bray\u2013Curtis similarity) and non-weighted (unweighted UniFrac) algorithms and visualized using principal coordinate analysis (PCoA). OTUs contributing for the shifting of the samples along the two axes were ascertained by calculating the Spearman correlation of each OTU with the two axes in the PCoA39. Similarity percentage analysis (SIMPER)42 was performed to determine the driving OTUs imparting significant differences among bacterial community composition among genotype and diet groups. The analysis was performed on Bray\u2013Curtis similarity coefficient with the program PAST (Paleontological Statistics, ver. 2.14)43.",
