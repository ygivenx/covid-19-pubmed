Spread to Mexico City occurred by 15 March 2009.\n4\n Between 15 March and 19 April, sporadic cases in Mexico City increased erratically, with person\u2010to\u2010person transmission becoming sustained and amplified after mass population return to the city following the Holy Week holiday (5\u201319 April). A public health emergency was decreed in Mexico on 23 April. After laboratory confirmation of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infection on 23 April, Direccion General de Epidemiologia, Secretaria de Salud, Mexico (DGE) developed case definitions. A suspected case was defined as severe respiratory illness with fever, cough and difficulty breathing. A probable case was defined as a suspected case in a patient from whom a specimen had been collected and tested positive for influenza A. A confirmed case was defined as a probable case that tested positive for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 by real\u2010time reverse\u2010transcription polymerase chain reaction. Health\u2010care officials were contacted and asked to provide retrospective and ongoing data for persons having illness consistent with these case definitions and seeking care on or after 1 March. As of 15 June, 6241 cases including 108 deaths have been reported as laboratory\u2010confirmed because of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in Mexico. Returning travelers have also seeded cases in 74 other countries, including 35 928 confirmed cases globally as of 15 June with 55 deaths reported outside of Mexico to date.\n5\n On 11 June, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak to be the first global influenza pandemic in 41 years.\n6\n\n",

Early transmission in Mexico City was punctuated by two pivotal sociological events. First, from 5 to 19 April, schools were closed and approximately 10% of the population left the city for the Holy Week holiday.\n7\n This may have temporarily reduced transmission within the city while increasing the risk of spread to other communities. Second, on 23 April, the government of Mexico City declared a public health emergency that may have increased hospital visits for milder illness that might otherwise have gone unreported. Mexico as a whole experienced a mild and delayed 2008\u20132009 influenza season, with other human subtypes of influenza viruses; the extent to which human influenza and other respiratory viruses contributed to illness reports during that period is unknown.",

The first time series consists of early reports of suspect influenza infection from all hospitals in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area between 15 March and 30 April (hereafter S) (Figure 1). This data included dates of self\u2010reported onset of symptoms and hospitalization for approximately 3798 suspect cases of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 variant. While it is likely that these cases ranged from mild to fatal and that treatment ranged from home\u2010based self\u2010care to hospitalization, such individual\u2010level clinical information was not available. However, prior to laboratory testing, it was unknown which of these infections were pandemic (H1N1) 2009 rather than typical influenza A or other respiratory infectious agents. After laboratory results from suspect cases were released on 4 June 2009, we received three additional epidemiological time series provided by the Mexico City Ministry of Health (Secretaria de Salud del Distrito Federal) from Mexico City (Distrito Federal) from 1 March to 30 May. These mutually exclusive data sets include symptom onset dates for cases where laboratory tests were negative for influenza A virus (hereafter N), cases where laboratory tests were positive for any influenza A strain, excluding pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (hereafter A), and cases with laboratory confirmation for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (hereafter C) (Figure 1).",

The estimate is refined with every additional day of time series data. For typical unmitigated influenza epidemics, values from this method typically converge to the best estimate of R within a few days, before the acceleration of the outbreak, and remain stable throughout the epidemic period.

At the time of this study, little was known about these parameters for the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 outbreak in Mexico City. Empirical data from contact investigations of confirmed cases of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in the Canadian province of Ontario suggest that the median interval between contact with a confirmed symptomatic case and development of symptoms is 6 days (95% CI 5\u20137 days). As such, we used a 5\u2010day latent period and 2\u2010day asymptomatic infectious period as a plausible upper bound for time from infection until development of symptomatic disease. Thus, we considered a wide range of possible values estimated for other strains of influenza and large urban centers, respectively (Table 1). The infectious period of a case may be curtailed by hospitalization or self\u2010isolation prior to recovery or death. We therefore directly estimated the distribution of removal rates via either natural causes or intervention by calculating the numbers of days between the onset of symptoms and hospitalization (type II and III triage protocol) or self\u2010isolation (type I triage protocol) for all reported cases. We assumed that unreported asymptomatic or mild cases \n12\n remained infectious until recovery.",

For each day, we estimate R using the full time series preceding and including that day. The estimates stabilize approximately one week before the end of Holy Week.

Assuming that there were no other respiratory epidemics in the same period, it is plausible that the marked increase in reported cases after 19 April is attributable to a surge in notification spurred by the end of Holy Week and the public health decrees.",

This adjusted time series should represent the number of cases identified if the public health measures described had not been implemented. Of note, the peak of the adjusted epidemic curve shifts from 27 April to 23 April, the date the public alert took place and when the social distancing interventions were implemented. This suggests that the public health interventions may have significantly mitigated the epidemic. Adjustment using both the patients without influenza (curve N) and those with non\u2010pandemic influenza A (curve A) has similar impacts (Figure 2). Looking at the time period immediately before 23 April, one may also use either curve A or N to \u2018inflate\u2019 the number of confirmed cases to reflect the hypothetical scenario of early heightened surveillance and public awareness (from the start of the epidemic) (Figure 3A,B). This approach increases confirmed cases closer to the \u2018true\u2019 prevalence. Estimates of R based on the four adjusted curves are also given in Table 2. Unlike the estimates based on the raw data, these estimates remain relatively stable throughout the period of heightened awareness and surveillance.",

The SARS\u2010CoV had a relatively long 4\u2010 to 6\u2010day incubation period and a peak infectious period that was delayed until the tenth day of severe illness.\n16\n SARS was transmitted predominantly in the healthcare settings, with a case fatality rate exceeding 10%. These features made SARS relatively easy to detect and readily amenable to individual\u2010based control measures such as case isolation and contact tracing before substantial spread could occur beyond initial seeding and local hospital\u2010based outbreaks. Influenza viruses, in contrast, are characterized by shorter incubation (typically 1\u20134 days), pre\u2010clinical virus shedding and peak infectiousness shortly after illness onset.\n17\n, \n18\n Influenza illness comprises a spectrum including mild or asymptomatic infection with overall case fatality below 2% even during the worst pandemic on record (1918) and 10\u2010fold lower still during subsequent pandemics.\n19\n In keeping with this classic influenza profile, pandemic (H1N1) 2009 shows a larger proportion of mild infections, community\u2010based propagation and a lower case fatality than SARS.\n20\n Thus, while the reproduction numbers of the two infections are not dramatically different, they likely will require a different set of population\u2010based social distancing and mitigation measures. General reinforcement of voluntary self\u2010isolation, cough etiquette, handwashing and self\u2010monitoring by contacts combined with social strategies to disrupt complex contact networks and lessen virus amplification and adaptation at the community level are needed. National health authorities in North America and Europe have implemented varying school closure policies (e.g. broadly in Mexico, targeted in the UK and minimal in the US) in an attempt to contain viral transmission; as of this writing, these measures are being scaled back, but further interventions to change social contact patterns may be important as the outbreak progresses.\n21\n\n",

Although pandemic (H1N1) 2009 is a new zoonotic pathogen and antigenically distinct from previous human or swine H1N1 viruses, there may be some pre\u2010existing immunity limiting its pandemic potential. Nevertheless, even a new variant of human influenza virus within a given subtype can significantly exacerbate seasonal morbidity and mortality (especially among persons with chronic conditions) \u2013 as was witnessed globally with the A/Sydney/05/97(H3N2)\u2010like virus in 1997\u201398 or the A/Fujian/411/2002(H3N2)\u2010like virus in 2003\u201304. Thus, delaying further spread and evolution of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 remains a worthwhile goal until a safe and effective vaccine can be developed and administered.
