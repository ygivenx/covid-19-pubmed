The efficacy of diosmectite in the treatment of acute diarrhea in children has been investigated in several controlled clinical studies. Despite varying inclusion criteria and outcome parameters, results have consistently demonstrated the efficacy of diosmectite.",

On day 5 of treatment, the incidence of diarrhea was 12% in the diosmectite group compared with 34% in the rehydration-alone group (p = 0.04). The acceptability of diosmectite was rated as \u2018good\u2019 by 88% of children in the outpatient study. There was a tendency for more patients in the diosmectite group to experience constipation in both studies; three cases in the outpatient study and two participants in the study with hospitalized infants had hardened stools.

Data from two trials[19] (n = 125) showed that the frequency of stools was reduced at 48\u201372 hours and 72\u201396 hours after start of treatment with diosmectite, compared with placebo; no difference between diosmectite and placebo was evident at <48 hours. The relative chance of resolution of diarrhea on day 3 of diosmectite treatment was 1.64 (95% CI 1.36, 1.98) compared with controls, which was statistically significant; the number of patients needed to treat to resolve one case of diarrhea was 4 (95% CI 3, 5). The analyses did not detect any differences between diosmectite and placebo in the incidence of vomiting or compliance with treatment. Available tolerability data indicated only a nonsignificant trend for more diosmectite than placebo recipients to experience constipation. While acknowledging the limitations inherent in any meta-analysis, and the methodologic limitations of the included studies, the investigators concluded that the results of the meta-analysis were promising and suggested that some children with acute diarrhea may benefit from using diosmectite. However, they also cautioned that if diosmectite is to be used, then patients, parents, and physicians need to be mindful that the focus is not removed from appropriate rehydration, electrolyte, and nutritional therapies. The investigators also noted that further well conducted research is needed to determine which patients (e.g. age, invading pathogen type, outpatient vs inpatient) will gain the greatest clinical benefit, the most effective dosing regimen, the cost effectiveness or otherwise of therapy, and the tolerability of diosmectite.\n\n",

Diosmectite inhibited mucolysis and reduced destruction of the luminal surface membranes of most epithelial cells in animals infected with EPEC. Diosmectite did not influence mucus levels in uninfected animals. In anesthetized rats, diosmectite protected the adherent gastric mucus layer from pepsin-induced mucolysis when administered 30 minutes prior to pepsin challenge.[31] When given up to 16 hours prior to pepsin challenge, diosmectite was able to prevent gastric mucosal hemorrhage and histologic epithelial damage. Mucin degradation was also significantly reduced in rats that received diosmectite 30 minutes or 2 hours before pepsin challenge, but the reduction was not significant when diosmectite was administered 16 hours before pepsin challenge. Diosmectite was also found to effectively increase the thickness of the mucus layer in rats shortly after administration. The thickness was greatest at the 30-minute measurement, and had declined to 8% of that maximum 16 hours after administration. The histologic findings suggest that diosmectite mixes with the adherent mucus, rather than forming two separate layers. In addition to binding to the mucus layer, diosmectite may also inhibit the actions of pepsin, as there was evidence of inhibition of pepsin-induced mucolysis in rats that received diosmectite.",

However, diosmectite had no effect on gastric emptying when it was administered concurrently with the toxin (and with no prior incubation). Diosmectite administered on its own also had no effect on gastric emptying, indicating the effect was dependent on the presence of the toxin.[9] The fact that incubating the toxin with diosmectite in vitro prior to administration was effective in preventing accelerated gastric emptying suggests that diosmectite may be able to adsorb the toxin. However, the findings that diosmectite is normally eliminated within 16 hours and that protection was conferred when diosmectite was administered 4 days before the toxin[9] support an additional mechanism independent of adsorption of the toxin by smectite in the stomach.",

Mannitol infusion on its own disrupted gastric and jejunal cyclical migrating motor complexes, which stimulated colonic motility activity and resulted in diarrhea 45\u201360 minutes after the start of the infusion. When the mannitol infusions were administered 3 or 6 days after diosmectite initiation, disruption of gastric and jejunal activity persisted, but the disturbances in colonic motility were absent, and development of diarrhea was delayed by >7 hours. The investigators postulated that diosmectite probably enhanced fluid absorption by some mechanism. The differing effects suggest that diosmectite may have different mechanisms on different sections of the GI tract under various conditions.",

However, it is currently not recommended by the WHO for routine use in children with acute diarrhea because of the additional costs and efficacy of ORT.[39] The WHO recently recommended use of zinc as an adjunct therapy to ORT in the treatment of acute diarrhea in children.[39] To date, no studies have shown whether concomitant use of diosmectite will affect zinc absorption. However, it should be noted that because of the adsorbent properties of diosmectite it should be administered at a different time to other medications. Although no cost-effectiveness studies have been published, it is possible that the additional cost of diosmectite is offset by the reduced duration of disease and length of hospital stay and time spent by parents looking after children with diarrhea. It has also been proposed that diosmectite might be useful for managing infectious diarrhea where extensive use of antibacterial agents has led to the emergence of multi-resistant organism strains.[13]",

            "text": "The precise process(es) by which diosmectite acts to decrease diarrhea have yet to be established and appear to be quite complex. Impairment of the structure or function of the intestinal mucosa always occurs with infectious diarrhea[14] and the anti-diarrheal properties of diosmectite probably include protection against damage to the intestinal mucosa by diarrheogenic agents. Current data suggest that multiple mechanisms may contribute to the anti-inflammatory effect, but it is likely that the decrease in proinflammatory cytokines reported in several studies is secondary to effects that occur in the lumen. Diosmectite is not absorbed from the lumen into the epithelial cells[40] and, therefore, probably inhibits some pathogens in the lumen that induce inflammation of the gut wall. Proposed mechanisms by which diosmectite acts at the luminal level include increased thickness of the mucus layer, absorption of or binding to endotoxins, absorption of proteins and antigens associated with inflammation, increase in colonic mucin, and decreased mucolysis[11] (which may also be secondary to enterotoxin adsorption). As previously mentioned (in section 4.2), Rateau et al.[30] determined that diosmectite inhibits mucolysis caused by EPEC infection. In their study, they acknowledge that smectite may have inhibited mucolysis by adsorbing enterotoxins, thereby masking their action on the goblet cells. Diarrhea is probably decreased by the anti-inflammatory effects of diosmectite resulting in amelioration of increased fluid secretion normally associated with inflammation. Changes in the absorptive properties of the intestine in the presence of diosmectite may also alter fluid and electrolyte secretion and absorption, which may also contribute to the anti-diarrheal effects.[37]",
