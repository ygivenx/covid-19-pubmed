Depending on the genetic defect, B lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells may be present or absent and this feature constitutes the basis for the classical division into T\u2010B + SCID and T\u2010B\u2212SCID, with further subdivisions into NK+ and NK\u2212 disorders.\n1\n Respiratory tract infection is a common manifestation in children in question and may be present within the neonatal period or in early infancy. Opportunistic pathogens may lead to rapidly progressive, fatal interstitial pneumonitis accompanied by hyperinflation resulting from small airway obstruction or to persistent bronchiolitic presentation. Apart from pyogenic bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas spp, Burkholderia spp, as well as Mycobacteria and fungi, in particular Pneumocystis jiroveci, respiratory viruses like respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and other viruses \u2013 cytomegalovirus (CMV), varicella\u2013zoster virus (VZV), and Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) are associated with severe pneumonia in SCID children.\n2\n Human coronaviruses (HCoV) HCoV\u2010229E and HCoV\u2010OC43 and related new strains HCoV\u2010NL63 and HCoV\u2010HKU1, identified after the epidemic outbreak of severe acquired respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, are likely to be common respiratory viruses in otherwise healthy children and were not implicated in severe lung infections in immunocompromised patients thus far.\n3\n In this report we present the case of a child with delayed\u2010onset SCID and fatal respiratory coronavirus infection.",

In early infancy, mild eczema on the child\u2019s face, in the perioral and periorbital areas was observed. By the end of the first year of life the child had thrived and had not suffered from any severe infections.

Fine papular skin eruption affecting the face was observed. Neither peripheral lymph nodes nor internal organs of the abdominal cavity were palpable. During hospitalization, lymphopenia, anemia, and thrombocytosis (the peak platelet count was 778 \u00d7 109/l) as well as increased levels of inflammatory markers and coagulopathy were found in laboratory tests. Dilation of the right coronary artery was revealed in echocardiography, giving rise to the suspicion of Kawasaki disease and the instituting of treatment with aspirin and immunoglobulins. Despite intensive pharmacotherapy with antibiotics, trimethoprime/sulfamethoxazole, acyclovir and antifungal agents, rapid deterioration of the child\u2019s clinical state and the exacerbation of respiratory insufficiency accompanied by progression in radiological features of the respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) occured. On a chest X\u2010ray, massive alveolar and interstitial infiltrations with bilaterally decreased aeration of the lung fields and blurred borders of the diaphragm and the heart shape (as shown on Figure 1) were discernible. Differential diagnostics that included examinations of the tracheal aspirate samples aimed at infectious agents were carried out. Infections with viruses \u2013 RSV A and B, parainfluenza viruses 1,2, and 3, influenza A including H1N1 subtype and B, adenoviruses, CMV, EBV, MPV, rhinovirus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), with bacteria, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella, Bordetella pertussis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, as well as with fungi \u2013Candida spp. and P. jiroveci were excluded based on negative PCR examinations, whereas the human coronavirus HKU1 \u2013 RNA proved positive. Peripheral blood lymphocyte flow cytometric immunophenotyping revealed a total lack of expression of antigens characteristic for CD4 and CD8 T\u2010cell subsets as well as NK cells along with the presence of functionally immature transitional and na\u00efve B cells. This SCID phenotype was subsequently confirmed by bone marrow flow cytometric evaluation. However, the presence of few NK cells was revealed, indicating for T\u2010B + NK + SCID.",

Moreover, seroconversion with regard to HCoV\u2010229E and above\u2010mentioned HCoV\u2010NL63 in young children was much higher and was estimated to 42\u00b79\u201350% and 75%, respectively.\n7\n The characteristics of clinical manifestation of coronavirus respiratory tract infection are predominantly reliant on case reports, and in otherwise, healthy children are comparable with bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia due to other viral infections. The epidemiological study by Kuypers et al.\n\n8\n indicated that a considerable proportion of coronavirus\u2010infected children had underlying chronic central nervous system, cardiovascular, pulmonary, allergic, and renal or hepatic conditions and diseases. These authors also paid attention to immunocompromised pediatric patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia and organ transplant recipients as a high\u2010risk group for the development of severe lung disease. However, it is worth noting that coronavirus respiratory infections have not been described in children with genetically determined immunodeficiencies thus far and this is the first report of a documented HCoV\u2010HKU1\u2010related pneumonia with the RDS in a child with SCID. It is also interesting to note that the preliminary clinical diagnosis in this patient was Kawasaki disease, what is consistent with the hypothesis by Esper et al.\n\n9\n regarding the association between Kawasaki disease with HCoV infection, supported by identification of the \u2018New Heaven\u2019 coronavirus (HCoV\u2010NH) in 72\u00b77% of respiratory specimen from affected children.",
