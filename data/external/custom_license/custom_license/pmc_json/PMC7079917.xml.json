A scant 15 years after the first reported stable transformed plant (Fraley et al. 1983; Horsch et al. 1984), the use of transgenic higher plants to produce foreign proteins with economic value was being realized (Kusnadi et al. 1998). Although transgenic animals, bacteria and fungi are also utilized for the production of proteins, it is with plants that the highest economic benefit will likely be achieved.",

In brief, the advantages of using higher plants for the purpose of protein production include: (1) significantly lower production costs than with transgenic animals, fermentation or bioreactors; (2) infrastructure and expertise already exists for the planting, harvesting and processing of plant material; (3) plants contain no known human pathogens (such as prions, virions, etc.) that could contaminate the final product; (4) higher plants generally synthesize proteins from eukaryotes with correct folding, glycosylation, and activity; and (5) plant cells can direct proteins to environments that reduce degradation and therefore increase stability. Some of these factors will be addressed again in later sections.",

One of the earliest marker genes that scientists have used in developing transformation systems in plants, uids (Jefferson et al. 1987), is now a molecular farming product (Kusnadi et al. 1998; Witcher et al. 1998). The first report of human antibodies produced in plants was by During (1988) and was expanded to include secretory antibodies by Hiatt et al. (1989). The first report of a protein being produced in plants for the specific purpose of extraction, purification, and sale of that protein was by Hood et al. (1997), which detailed the production of avidin, an egg protein with several important properties. Aprotinin, one of the first molecularly farmed pharmaceutical proteins to be produced in plants (Zhong et al. 1999), may soon be used on medical patients for wound closure and to suppress the systemic inflammatory response during surgery.",

As an example, dry corn seed has a moisture content of approximately 11\u201315% and, at that level, the seed is metabolically inert. Thus, long-term non-refrigerated storage of the seed, if properly carried out, can allow the protein to exist without degradation for at least 2 years. This seed can then be transported to its final destination without refrigeration. Another advantage to this system is that large acreage can be utilized with the lowest possible cost. Since crops such as rice and corn are grown throughout the world, the products have the potential to be produced near the target markets.",

The protein is composed of four identical subunits, each 128 amino acids long. The usual source for commercial quantities of avidin is from chicken egg white but the resultant product is relatively expensive due to the cost of maintaining live animals. Hood et al. (1997) reported the production of chicken egg white avidin in transgenic corn using an avidin gene whose sequence had been optimized for expression in corn. The resultant avidin had properties almost identical to those of avidin from chicken egg white. The pI, K\ni, and antigenic properties were identical. Both the corn-derived and the chicken egg-derived avidin were glycosylated. While the avidin apoproteins were identical, the size of corn-derived avidin was slightly less than chicken egg-derived avidin (16.8 vs 17.6 kDa) due to a less complex glycosylation composition (M. Bailey, unpublished observations). This difference did not alter the binding activity of the mature protein. Corn-derived avidin expression levels over 20% TSP (total soluble protein) have been observed (Masarik et al. 2003). Processing methodologies were developed to extract and purify this novel product from transgenic corn (Kusnadi et al. 1998). This product is currently being sold by Sigma-Aldrich (#A8706; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.)",

GUS is widely used as a visual marker in transgenic plant research. It was first reported to be produced commercially in transgenic corn (Kusnadi et al. 1998, Witcher et al. 1998), where its properties were compared with GUS extracted from Escherichia coli, the original source of the protein. The molecular weights were identical, as were their antigenic qualities K\ni and pI. Their K\nm values were nearly identical (0.20 vs 0.21) and their V\nmax values for the substrate MUG (4-methylumbelliferyl-\u03b2-d-glucuronide) were also quite similar (2.9\u00d7105 nM/h for corn-derived vs 2.2\u00d7105 nM/h for E. coli-derived). The sequences of the two genes were similar, with the exception of the most N-terminal amino acid. It was surmised that removal of the terminal amino acid in plants was a result of the N-terminal rule in action (Hirel et al. 1989) as a result of the change in sequence. An interesting paper describing an economic evaluation of the extraction and purification of corn-derived GUS was published by Evangelista et al. (1998). Corn-derived GUS has been marketed by Sigma-Aldrich (#G2035).",

Mucosal surfaces such as the mouth and the urogenital tract are the primary ports of entry of most disease organisms. Edible vaccines have been shown to induce excellent mucosal immune responses. Recent reviews of edible vaccines include Carter and Langridge (2002) and Streatfield and Howard (2003). The laboratory of William Langridge at Loma Linda University (Loma Linda, Calif.) has been active in developing edible vaccines against diabetes and cholera using a flexible hinge peptide between the antigens and the protein adjuvants in order to minimize stearic hindrance (Arakawa et al. 1998, 2001; Yu and Langridge 2001).

As mentioned above, Klaus During described the production of MAbs in his 1988 Ph.D. thesis (During 1988) and published this work in a peer-reviewed journal in 1990 (During et al. 1990). Briefly, this work demonstrated expression of the B 1\u20138 light chain and heavy chain in transgenic tobacco and then showed assembly of the full MAb. Unexpectedly, a high percentage of the B 1\u20138 MAb was found in the chloroplasts. At about this time, Hiatt and colleagues, then at the Scripps Research Institute (La Jolla, Calif.) reported that they had crossed transgenic tobacco containing gamma or kappa immunoglobulin chains and obtained progeny having fully functional MAb (Hiatt et al. 1989).",

The addition of xylose and change from a \u03b21\u21926 to a \u03b21\u21923 linkage of fucose are typical in plants. A significant difference with transprotein production in plants is their inability to add sialic acid to glycoproteins (Lerouge et al. 1998). This sugar has been implicated in longer clearance times for proteins in the blood and therefore is a major factor for a select group of pharmaceutical proteins. These differences have had minimal or no effect on the function of the transprotein products from plants to date (Hood et al. 1997; Samyn-Petit et al. 2001; Woodard et al. 2003).",

However, today\u2019s public also wants to know that not only is there a benefit for the direct end user, but that there are otherwise no significant risks to the general public. This is illustrated by the recent concerns and debates over the use of GMO products produced in plants. While the initial concern involved GMO food products, this now encompasses non-food products as well. The fear is that the non-food products may inadvertently enter the food chain and present an unintentional risk (J.A. Howard and K.C. Donnelly, A quantitative safety assessment model for non-food products produced in agricultural crops. MS submitted). On the surface, this appears to be an unprecedented use of food crops to produce pharmaceutical and industrial products.

While some of these products may present a significant risk to the public, many of the products would not pose a hazard if they were inadvertently introduced. In fact, many of the products in the pipeline are either already in the food supply or endogenous to humans. This is not to say that we should accept these products into the food chain, but rather we are prepared for all possible situations. A quantitative risk assessment similar to that employed for other regulated products can be used to evaluate what type of measures need to be taken for specific products.

As the industry develops, academic laboratories will need to put more emphasis into downstream process development research. This will complement their fundamental work on protein expression and will provide the basic knowledge to fuel the industry. However, the marketing and delivery of commercial products will necessarily fall to industry. As with any new industry, there have been hurdles to overcome, both technical and regulatory.
