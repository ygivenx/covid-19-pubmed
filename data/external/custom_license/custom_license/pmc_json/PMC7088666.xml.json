            "text": "Fred Hoyle (1915\u20132001) was one of the intellectual giants of the twentieth century. He is best known for his contributions to astronomy and the Steady-State Model of the Universe. His highest recognition was the Crafoord Prize by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. This prize is awarded in field not covered by the Nobel Prize. Concerning the origin of life on Earth, he and the author of the book under review worked for decades on the theory of panspermia. Chandra Wickramasinghe (b. 1939 in Sri Lanka, then, Ceylon) is Professor of Applied Mathematics and Astronomy at Cardiff University of Wales and Director of the Cardiff Centre for Astrobiology. He collaborated with Fred Hoyle for four decades. In addition to this book having an autobiographical character, it gives great emphasis to those contributions of Hoyle and Wickramasinghe that have challenged the theory that life originated on Earth in a warm primordial soup. Wickramasinghe forcefully advocates his agenda and for this reason that I find it justified to subject his views of criticism.",

            "text": "It has always been tempting to invoke the interference of the distant and the exotic when scientists failed to come to grips with issues by investigating them in their own context. It is well known that an extraterrestrial influence was seriously considered as the cause of puerperal fever in the nineteenth century and Ignacz Semmelweis had to overcome stiff resistance to convince gynecologists of his time about the very earthly nature of the condition. But puerperal fever is not the only microbial infection that was thought to have a mysterious origin. The \u201cmiasma theory\u201d implied that all communicable diseases originated from bad air. Air was supposed to assume \u201cepidemic influence\u201d under certain circumstances and became \u201cmalignant\u201d when combined with emissions of organic decomposition from earth. The hypothesis of Fred Hoyle and Chandra Wickramasinghe on the interstellar traffic of microbes\u2014though it draws on some important discoveries made earlier by the investigators\u2014should unfortunately be considered a modern day reincarnation of these unscientific, fantastic theories.",

Though Chandra Wickramasinghe claims that experiments have been done proving that microbes can resist adverse conditions in space he conspicuously fails to give references on the subject. This is in sharp contrast to other less relevant issues addressed by the book where appropriate references are always disclosed.",

            "text": "Nevertheless, it is not only the lack of evidence that makes the hypothesis untenable. Author suggests that there is an incessant traffic of microbes between planets and even today microbes regularly arrive to earth from space. In his view extraterrestrial microbes are responsible for novel viral diseases arising from time to time in East Asia. In fact, the emergence of the new types of East Asian influenza viruses and that of the novel type of corona virus causing SARS are well established to have originated locally, as a consequence of poor hygiene and a close contact between humans and animals. Furthermore, if microbes arrived from space to earth nowadays they would primarily belong to the groups of spore-forming bacteria that constitute the most durable form of microbial life. However, there is absolutely no evidence for the emergence of novel spore-forming bacteria displaying unorthodox features or causing unusual diseases on any continent.",

There are several distinct codes in microorganisms and also in higher forms of life that slightly deviate from the standard code. If an assortment of genetic codes could have evolved on a single planet, how could a microbe arriving to Earth from enormous distances be expected to command an identical genetic code with those of most terrestrial microorganisms?",

Instead of \u201cconventional microbes\u201d we should, perhaps, focus on the latest achievements of biology. The sphere of life has recently been extended to new horizons: Stanley Prusiner at the University of California, San Francisco, proved that some protein molecules\u2014prions\u2014can act as pathogens when assuming altered conformations and these conformational changes remain stable, i.e., conformations are capable of harboring information. Thus, the origin of life on earth may soon turn out to have a much more humble beginning than the \u201chighly sophisticated\u201d microbes scientists have been pursuing.",
