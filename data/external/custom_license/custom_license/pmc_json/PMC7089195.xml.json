The two cases exemplify the need for analyzing infectious disease data and understanding epidemic evolution, and serve as an initial point of reference for creating strategies and suggestions for improving these aspects in communities. Economic costs are atypical in the onset, beginning, and mid-stages of an epidemic occurrence typically as other physical hazards do; thus, resulting in a distinctive pattern of effects and overall spread.\n",

Even smaller than bacteria, viruses cause a multitude of diseases\u2014ranging from the common cold to AIDS; Fungi. Many skin diseases, such as ringworm and athlete\u2019s foot, are caused by fungi. Other types of fungi can infect lungs or nervous system; and Parasites. A tiny parasite that is transmitted by a mosquito bite causes malaria.

This type of model is capable of providing the justification as to why certain epidemics do not reach a pandemic stage and mass outbreak levels. Real-time forecasting model allows one to calculate the early stages of a future outbreak showing the timing of the illness, with its affects and the time that it persists in a country comparable with surveillance systems. This variation takes on the assumption that an influenza case is latent for 2 days, infectious for 2.5 days, with viral shedding starting 1 day before symptoms develop in symptomatic cases (Hall et al. 2007). For the application of this model, there are nine specified parameters, including size and frequency, duration of time (i.e., 2 days, 2.5 days, and 1 day), growth rate, and the ratio of cases reported for the dataset. These parameters are used to create the relationship curves of comparing and estimating the effects of an epidemic.",

While there are several positive aspects to this highly mobile society, there are also some negative features, among which probably the most serious issue is the recurrence of epidemics and pandemics. This fact is demonstrated by the spread of AIDS, SARS, and the recent Ebola pandemic. In this study, we examined two particular epidemics: cholera in India and meningitis in DRC. For these studies, the data record is 30 years long from 1980 to 2010. While the length of data record is not entirely ideal from statistical purposes, nevertheless it is long enough to provide some useful regression relations.\n",
