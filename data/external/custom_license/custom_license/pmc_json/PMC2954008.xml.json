An accumulation of data, such as antimicrobial drug susceptibilities and observation of atypical bacteria in intestinal macrophages, has suggested that this disease is an infectious disease. Tropheryma whipplei is recognized as the infectious agent responsible for Whipple disease (2). Recent studies using molecular biology (3\u20135) and culture-dependent (6\u201310) techniques have enabled the T. whipplei genome to be fully sequenced (11,12) and have resulted in development of new culture media (13), selection of highly sensitive primers for quantitative PCR (14), and genotyping (15\u201319). The bacterium is found in a viable form in stools of infected patients (9).",

Moreover, the prevalence of T. whipplei in feces of healthy children 2\u201310 years of age who lived in rural Senegal (sub-Saharan Africa) was 44% (46/105) (21).

Our data exclude the possibility of PCR contamination. We also found bacterial loads higher than those in previous reports of chronic carriers (20).

Comparison of the prevalence of antibodies for control children (22%) with preliminary prevalence data for persons 61 \u00b1 3.6 years of age (45%) (30) showed that the difference is significant (p<0.001); thus, possible acquired immunity to infection with T. whipplei may explain why this bacterium causes diarrhea in children, but not in most adults.",

We previously reported an association between G. duodenalis infection and Whipple disease (27). As with other organisms such as Helicobacter pylori, T. whipplei may also be transmitted through saliva because it has been found in saliva of asymptomatic carriers and patients with Whipple disease (20). Therefore, we hypothesized that primary infection with T. whipplei in children may result in gastroenteritis, especially when associated with other intestinal pathogens. We have provided several lines of evidence that T. whipplei is causing or exacerbating gastroenteritis. The incidence of T. whipplei DNA in stools of children 2\u20134 years of age with gastroenteritis was higher than that in the control group; these infected children also have higher levels of antibodies. That healthy children of the same ages were not infected with T. whipplei also suggests that primary infection is symptomatic. Sociodemographic differences between the 2 groups could theoretically explain our findings. However, most of our patients and controls were from the same geographic area, which enabled us to rule out this hypothesis.",

The association we found between T. whipplei and other pathogens transmitted by the fecal\u2013oral route supports the conclusion that T. whipplei and other intestinal pathogens have a common source of infection and that they are often co-transmitted (31,32). However, for unknown reasons, T. whipplei could replicate in children with low-grade chronic infections without causing diarrhea. That T. whipplei\u2013infected patients were more likely to have co-infections than patients infected with other pathogens may also indicate that T. whipplei may decrease below molecular detection limits when diarrhea resolves. However, higher levels of IgM against T. whipplei in case-patients suggest infection with this bacterium. Moreover, an in vivo animal model of oral infection by T. whipplei has shown a pathogenic effect only in mice with previously inflamed colonic tissues (D. Raoult et al., unpub. data). Thus, inflamed colonic tissues may also explain the frequency of co-infections with common pathogens observed in persons with T. whipplei\u2013positive gastroenteritis.",
