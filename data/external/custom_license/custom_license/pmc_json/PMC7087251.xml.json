The genomic RNA is 27.6 kb in length, and approximately two thirds of the nucleotide sequence encodes ORF 1, which includes ORF 1a and ORF 1b [11, 22\u201325]. A papain-like protease (PLP) is encoded by the region from nucleotides 4243 to 5553 of ORF 1a [21], comprising the catalytic domain of nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3). Proteolysis at the Gly673-Gly674 and Gly2265\u2013Gly2266 dipeptide bonds leads to release of the 87-kDa and 195-kDa N\u2013terminal mature proteins and the C-terminal 41-kDa cleavage product [20, 21, 23]. Site-directed mutagenesis studies have confirmed that the Cys1274 and His1437 residues of PLP are essential for proteinase activity [20].",

At least two CoVs, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [1] and IBV [21] encode only one functional papain-like protease, termed PLP. The proteolytic processing mediated by the PLP encoded by IBV [20] is similar to that of PLP2 encoded by other CoVs [3, 6]. PLPs of CoVs also perform deubiquitinating (DUB) and interferon (IFN) antagonism activities. For instance, PLP2 of MHV-A59 [29] can bind to IRF3, cause its deubiquitination and prevent its nuclear translocation, thus inhibiting cellular IRF3-mediated type I IFN production and promoting viral infection. The SARS-CoV PLP pro-catalytic core also has DUB activity and can deubiquitinate IRF3, thereby stalling its migration to the nucleus and preventing the host antiviral response [7, 10, 26]. Similarly, purified PLP2 of HCoV\u2013NL63 can hydrolyze K48-linked hexa-ubiquitin (K48-Ub6) to produce monoubiquitin [6, 7], and therefore negatively regulate antiviral defenses by disrupting the STING-mediated IFN induction [26].",

Here, we demonstrate that IBV has DUB activity, and like other CoVs, IBV can recognize and process both K48- and K63-linked polyubiquitin chains. We also demonstrate that the core domain of IBV PLP-TM is a coronaviral DUB enzyme. We also evaluated the role of PLP catalytic activity in DUB activity and found that PLP-TM does not require catalytic activity to cleave polyubiquitin-linked proteins. This study represents a first step in elucidating the role of PLP-TM in IBV pathogenesis and provides new insights on how IBV escapes host antiviral immune mechanisms.",

PLP2 of PEDV has potent DUB activity that is dependent on its catalytic activity. In notable contrast to PEDV PLP2, the DUB activity of IBV PLP is not dependent on its protease activity. Another group reported that IBV PLP can degrade K48- and K63-linked polyubiquitin chains to monoubiquitin but cannot degrade linear polyubiquitin [18]. HCoV-NL63 PLP2 has a DUB activity that is dependent on its protease activity [7]. By contrast, both the PLP2-TM and catalytic mutants of PLP2-TM [26] had DUB activity, although the DUB activity of the PLP2-TM catalytic mutants was lower than that of PLP2-TM, suggesting that the TM domain plays a role in PLP2 DUB activity. Similarly, our study confirmed that the TM domain downstream of IBV PLP is essential for PLP DUB activity. The IBV PLP cleaves the ORF 1a to generate nonstructural proteins that associate with endoplasmic reticulum membranes to generate convoluted membranes and double membrane vesicles (DMVs), which are the site of viral replication. The PLPs are tethered to the DMVs by a TM domain [12, 17]. Many reports have demonstrated that the TM domain plays an important role in CoVs DUB activity, possibly by facilitating correct protein folding or interactions with cellular proteins. Additional studies are needed to identify the exact functions of the TM domain during IBV replication and the interaction between the host innate immune system and IBV infection.",

            "text": "This study raises important questions concerning the role of viral DUB activity in CoV replication and pathogenesis. Coronaviral DUB activity may target the Ub-proteasome pathway to facilitate virus replication and damage host defense mechanisms, including innate immunity [5, 8]. Some CoVs may utilize DUB activity to escape the host innate antiviral response [13, 27]. For example, PLP2 of MHV-A59 can bind to IRF3, cause its deubiquitination and prevent its nuclear translocation. Co-expression of PLP2 inhibits CARDIF-, TBK1- and IRF3-mediated IFN-\u03b2 reporter activities [29]. MHV-A59 may use DUB activity to reduce IFN induction, to promote viral growth and to escape from host innate antiviral responses [29]. PEDV infection suppresses the production of IFN-\u03b2 and PLP2 acts as a viral DUB to interfere with RIG-I- and STING-mediated signaling pathways [28]. However, some CoVs PLP-mediated interferon antagonism is independent on protease and DUB activity. The PLP2 of NL63 has DUB activity and antagonizes the induction of type I IFN, whereas PLP-mediated IFN antagonism is independent of DUB activity [6]. These data show that CoVs PLPs target the activity of type I IFN through DUB activity and inhibit the activation of the innate immune system. Joeri Kint et al. showed that IBV inhibits the synthesis of host proteins, including type IIFN, a key component of the antiviral response [15, 16]. Our study also indicates that IBV PLP-TM process both K48- and K63-linked ubiquitin. K48- and K63-linked ubiquitin are the most common types of modified polyubiquitin and play key roles in protein degradation and in response to changes in the innate and adaptive immunity systems. Further investigations are necessary to determine if IBV PLP DUB activity inhibits the host antiviral response.",
