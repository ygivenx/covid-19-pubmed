Although ACE2 is expressed in the lungs of humans10 and mice (see Supplementary Fig. 1a, b), nothing is known about its function in the lungs. However, mortality following SARS coronavirus infections approaches almost 10% owing to the development of ARDS14,15,16. To elucidate the role of ACE2 in acute lung injury, we examined the effect of Ace2 gene deficiency in mouse experimental models that mimic the common lung failure pathology observed in several human diseases, including sepsis, acid aspiration and pneumonias such as SARS and avian influenza A17.",

Acid aspiration in wild-type mice, which mimics human acute lung injury18,19, resulted in rapid impairment of lung functions assessed by increased lung elastance (a measure of the change in pressure achieved per unit change in volume, representing the stiffness of the lungs) (Fig. 1a), decreased blood oxygenation (Fig. 1b) and the development of pulmonary oedema (Fig. 1c). Acid aspiration resulted in increased alveolar wall thickness, oedema, bleeding, inflammatory cell infiltrates and formation of hyaline membranes (Fig. 1d). Notably, acid-treated Ace2 knockout mice8 showed significantly greater lung elastance compared with control wild-type mice, but there were no differences in lung elastance between saline-treated Ace2 knockout and wild-type mice (Fig. 1a). Moreover, loss of Ace2 resulted in worsened oxygenation (Fig. 1b), massive lung oedema (Fig. 1c), increased inflammatory cell infiltration and hyaline membrane formations (Fig. 1d) in response to acid aspiration. It should be noted that ACE2 protein expression is typically downregulated in wild-type mice following acid challenge (Fig. 1e).",

We therefore examined the effect of Ace2 gene deficiency on sepsis-induced acute lung injury using caecal ligation and perforation (CLP)20. CLP causes lethal peritonitis and sepsis due to a polymicrobial infection that is accompanied by acute lung failure20. Whereas all CLP-treated wild-type mice survived, only two out of ten CLP-treated Ace2 knockout mice survived the 6 h experimental observation period (Fig. 2a). CLP resulted in lung failure defined by increased elastance (Fig. 2a), pulmonary oedema (Fig. 2b) and leukocyte accumulation (Fig. 2c) in wild-type mice. CLP-treated Ace2 knockout mice had a marked worsening of lung functions (Fig. 2a), increased oedema (Fig. 2b) and leukocyte accumulation (Fig. 2c) compared with wild-type mice. In addition, Ace2 knockout mice also developed markedly enhanced acute lung injury after endotoxin challenge18 (see Supplementary Fig. 2a\u2013c). Ace2 maps to the X chromosome, and it should be noted that loss of ACE2 expression resulted in equally severe acute lung injury phenotypes in male (Ace2-/y) and female (Ace2-/-) mice. Our data from three different acute lung injury models show that loss of Ace2 expression precipitates severe acute lung failure.",

ACE cleaves the decapeptide angiotensin (Ang)I into the octapeptide AngII (refs 11, 12). ACE2 cleaves a single residue from AngI to generate Ang1\u20139 (refs 6, 7), and a residue from AngII to generate Ang1\u20137 (ref. 6). In this way, ACE2 negatively regulates the renin\u2013angiotensin system by inactivating AngII (Fig. 3a). Acid aspiration in wild-type mice resulted in marked downregulation of ACE2 protein, but ACE levels remained constant (Fig. 1e). Moreover, only catalytically active ACE2 improved the acute lung injury phenotype in mutant and wild-type mice (Fig. 2d\u2013f). To clarify whether acute lung injury shifts the functional equilibrium between ACE and ACE2, we measured AngII levels in acid-treated and control mice. Acid aspiration markedly increased AngII levels in lungs (Fig. 3b) and plasma (see Supplementary Fig. 4a) of wild-type mice. We observed a further, significant increase in AngII levels in the lungs (Fig. 3b) and plasma (see Supplementary Fig. 4a) of acid-treated Ace2 knockout mice. Thus, acute lung injury results in decreased ACE2 expression and increased production of AngII.",

Moreover, treatment with rhuACE2 protein attenuated lung injury (Fig. 2d\u2013f) and further reduced AngII levels in the lungs of acid-treated mice (Supplementary Fig. 4d). In contrast to Ace2 knockout mice, Ace-/- mice21 were partly protected against acute lung injury induced by acid-aspiration (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 5). These effects were dependent on gene dosage and were observed to a lesser extent in Ace+/- mice. In addition, inactivation of Ace on an Ace2 knockout background rescued the severe lung failure (Fig. 3d), oedema formation (Fig. 3e) and histological changes (Fig. 3f) compared with Ace2 knockout mice. Similarly, in endotoxin-induced acute lung injury, the severe lung impairments in Ace2 knockout mice were reversed by additional Ace gene deficiency (see Supplementary Fig. 6). Thus, ACE promotes acute lung injury pathology and ACE2 alleviates it.",

The receptors for AngII in mice are angiotensin II type 1a (AT1a) receptor22, the type 1b (AT1b) receptor and the type 2 (AT2) receptor23. AT1a and AT2, but not AT1b receptor expression is found in the lungs25. We therefore explored which AngII receptor subtypes are responsible for ACE/ACE2 regulated acute lung injury, and whether AngII signalling through its receptors is responsible for ACE2-regulated lung pathology (Fig. 3a). Compared with wild-type mice, genetic loss of AT1a receptor expression in Agtr1a-/- mice24 markedly improved lung function (Fig. 4a) and reduced oedema formation (see Supplementary Fig. 7a). In contrast, inactivation of the AT2 receptor (Agtr2-/y)25 aggravated acute lung injury (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 7a).

Pulmonary perfusion pressures generated by AngI or AngII injection into lungs of acid-instilled animals or into lungs perfused with LPS were also similar between wild-type and Ace2 knockout mice (see Supplementary Fig. 8a, b). Moreover, fractional shortening using echocardiography (an indicator of left ventricular systolic function) and mean arterial pressures were comparable between Ace2 knockout and wild-type mice during the experimental period (see Supplementary Fig. 9a, b).

These results were confirmed using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated dextran (40 kDa) as another marker to assess vascular leakage of macromolecules (data not shown).

All animals were then ventilated for 3 h. RhuACE2 protein and mut-rhuACE2 protein were purified from transfected CHO cells by affinity chromatography. The catalytic activities of purified recombinant ACE2 proteins were measured using the fluorogenic peptide Substrate VI (R&D Systems). Mut-rhuACE2-Fc showed >95% loss of catalytic activity (see Supplementary Fig. 3a). For inhibitor studies, mice received intraperitoneal injections of the AT1 inhibitor Losartan (15 mg kg-1), the AT2 inhibitor PD123.319 (15 mg kg-1) or control vehicle 30 min before surgical procedures.",
