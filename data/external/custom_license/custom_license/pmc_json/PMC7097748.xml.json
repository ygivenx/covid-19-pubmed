As with prior crises, in the wake of Ebola, multiple commissions have offered suggestions for essential reforms8,9. Most focus on systems-level change, such as funding research and development or creating a centralized pandemic preparedness and response agency. However, they also call for enhanced molecular diagnostic and surveillance capacity coupled to data-sharing frameworks. This hints at an emerging paradigm for rapid outbreak response, one that employs new tools for pathogen genome sequencing and epidemiological analysis (Fig. 1) and that can be deployed anywhere. In this model, portable, in-country genomic diagnostics are targeted to key settings for routine human, animal and environmental surveillance or rapidly deployed to a setting with a nascent outbreak. Within our increasingly digital landscape, wherein a clinical sample can be transformed into a stream of data for rapid analysis and dissemination in a matter of hours, we face a tremendous opportunity to more proactively respond to disease events. However, the potential benefits of such a system are not guaranteed, and many obstacles remain.",

Most NGS services rely on bench-top instruments and sequencing from culture. However, when trying to proactively detect emerging infections or in many rapid outbreak responses, the aetiological agent behind a cluster is often unknown. Even if the agent is known, both the limited culture capacity in a field laboratory and the need for diagnostic turnaround times in hours, not days, preclude sequencing from culture. Sequencing directly from a sample using a portable sequencing platform is therefore more relevant in the field. Similarly, the need for a sequencer that can withstand being shipped and operated under rough field conditions, coupled with the need for rapid turnaround, make small, portable sequencers an attractive option.",

With its untargeted approach to sequencing, clinical metagenomics can cross disciplines in a way that clinical microbiology struggles to \u2014 identifying viral, bacterial, fungal and other eukaryotic pathogens in a single assay11 and coupling pathogen detection to pathogen discovery. Given the current high cost of the technique \u2014 conservatively estimated at several thousand dollars \u2014 it is most often used when dealing with potentially lethal infections that fail the conventional diagnostic paradigm, such as the recent diagnosis of an unusual case of meningoencephalitis caused by the amoeboid parasite Balamuthia mandrillaris12 or the diagnosis and treatment of neuroleptospirosis in a critically unwell teenager13. In the latter case, despite a high index of suspicion for infection, Leptospira santarosai was not detected by culture or PCR, as the diagnostic primer sequences were eventually found to be a poor match to the genome of the pathogen. Intravenous antibiotic therapy resulted in rapid recovery. In such an example, the costs are easily justified, particularly when offset against the cost of a stay in an intensive treatment unit. However, routine diagnostic metagenomics is currently limited to a handful of clinical research laboratories worldwide; it is therefore regarded as a 'test of last resort' and kept in reserve for vexing diagnostic conundrums.",

Chief among these is analytic sensitivity, which depends on pathogen factors (for example, genome size, ease of lysis and life cycle); analytic factors (for example, the completeness of reference databases and the potential to mistake a target for a close genetic relative); and sample factors (for example, pathogen abundance within a sample and contaminating background DNA). As an example of a problematic sample, during Zika surveillance, attempts to perform untargeted metagenomics sequencing on blood yielded few, or in some cases zero, reads owing to low viral titres14. Target-enrichment technologies (reviewed in Ref. 15) such as bait probes can be employed, but even these were unsuccessful at recovering whole Zika genomes, necessitating PCR enrichment14. In addition to sensitivity, universal pathogen detection through clinical metagenomics is complicated by specificity issues arising from misclassification or contaminated reagents, the challenge of reproducing results from a complex clinical workflow, nucleic acid stability under varying assay conditions, ever-changing bioinformatics workflows and cost.",

Recent studies have used metagenomics in common presentations, including sepsis16, pneumonia17, urinary tract infections18 and eye infections19. These have generally yielded promising results, albeit typically at a lower sensitivity than conventional tests and at a much greater cost. Despite these problems, two factors will drive sequencing to eventually become routine clinical practice. First, the ever-decreasing cost of sequencing coupled with the potential for cost savings achieved by using a single diagnostic modality versus tens or hundreds of different diagnostic assays \u2014 each potentially requiring specific instrumentation, reagents, validation and labour \u2014 is attractive from a laboratory operations perspective. Second, and perhaps most compelling, is the additional information afforded by genomics, including the ability to predict virulence or drug resistance phenotypes, the ability to detect polymicrobial infections and phylogenetic reconstruction for outbreak analysis.",

Given that outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) most often occur in settings with minimal laboratory capacity, where routine culture and bench-top sequencing are simply not feasible, the need for a portable diagnostic platform capable of in situ clinical metagenomics and outbreak surveillance is evident. A trend towards smaller and less expensive bench-top sequencing instruments was seen with the 454 Genome Sequencer Junior system (which has since been discontinued), the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM) system and the Illumina MiSeq system, which were released in close succession20. Each of these instruments costs <$150,000 and puts NGS capability into the hands of smaller laboratories, including clinical settings. In 2014, the MinION from Oxford Nanopore Technologies was released to early access users21, heralding the potential for highly portable 'lab-in-a-suitcase' sequencing. The MinION is pocket-sized and is controlled and powered through a laptop USB connection. It is provided under a model whereby the hardware is free but the consumer pays a premium for the reagent and flow cell consumables. Compared with bench-top instruments, the absence of a rolling service contract or regular engineer visits makes it theoretically possible to scale this platform out to potentially unlimited numbers of laboratories. Importantly, the MinION has been used in field situations, including in diagnostic tent laboratories during the Ebola epidemic22,23 and in a roving bus-based mobile laboratory in Brazil as part of the ZiBRA project3,24. Others have taken the MinION to more extreme environments where even the smallest traditional bench-top sequencer could not go, including the Arctic25 and Antarctic26, a deep mine27 and zero gravity aboard the reduced-gravity aircraft (nicknamed the 'Vomit Comet')28 and the International Space Station29.",

The many genomic epidemiology studies from the Ebola outbreak (reviewed in Ref. 48) used bench-top and portable sequencing platforms to reveal outbreak-level events and epidemic-level trends. Real-time analyses published around the peak of the epidemic suggested the following: the outbreak probably arose from a single introduction into humans and not repeated zoonotic introductions49,50; sexual transmission had a previously unrecognized role in maintaining transmission chains51; and survivor transmission \u2014 another unrecognized phenomenon \u2014 contributed to disease flare-ups later in the outbreak52. The first sequencing efforts, all of which had an effect on the epidemiological response in real time, unfolded months into the epidemic. Had they been deployed earlier, we can only speculate as to their potential impact. Arguably, the most compelling use of early sequencing would have been to provide a definitive Ebola diagnosis in this previously unaffected region of West Africa. However, even after the outbreak was underway, sequencing could have benefited the public health response. For example, ruling out bush meat as a source of repeated viral introductions could have changed public health messaging campaigns from avoiding bush meat to the importance of hygiene and safe funeral practices53, potentially averting some cases. Portable sequencing and phylodynamic approaches are currently being deployed in the ongoing Zika epidemic; whether the real-time reporting of genomic findings is able to alter the course of a vector-borne epidemic remains to be seen.",

Within these regions, sewer systems and wastewater treatment plants could be important foci for sample collection, providing a single point of entry to biological readouts from an entire community. Indeed, proof-of-concept metagenomics studies have revealed the presence of antibiotic resistance genes59, human-specific viruses60 and other pathogens of interest in this readily accessible sample type. Other recent surveys offer insight into what such systems might need to look for. In 2013, Rosenberg et al. reported that viruses dominate the list of agents newly recognized to cause disease in humans61. Most were zoonotic in origin, and over one-quarter had been detected in non-human species many years before being identified as human pathogens. A later review reiterates this observation, noting that recent agents of concern \u2014 Ebola, Zika and chikungunya \u2014 had been identified decades before they achieved pandemic magnitude62. As a result of NGS technology, the pace of novel virus discovery is accelerating, with recent large-scale studies revealing 184 new viruses sampled from macaque faeces in a single geographic location63 and 1,445 new viruses discovered from RNA transcriptomic analyses of multiple invertebrate species64. However, understanding which of these new entities might pose a threat requires a new approach.",

One of the first studies coupling detailed wildlife and livestock movement data with phylodynamic analysis of a bacterial pathogen revealed that cross-species jumps from an elk reservoir were the source of increasing rates of Brucella abortus infections in nearby livestock72; as the most common zoonosis of humans, brucellosis control programmes will benefit substantially from this sort of One Health approach73.",

Initial forays into this area have been successful; for example, metagenomics analysis of human diarrhoeal specimens and stools from nearby pigs revealed potential zoonotic transmission of rotavirus75. However, metagenomic sequencing across a range of animal species and environments yields more questions than answers. What is an early signal of pathogen emergence versus background microbial noise65? Which emerging agents are capable of crossing the species barrier and causing human disease74? What degree of sampling is required to capture potential spillovers67? Ultimately, a more efficient use of metagenomics in a One Health surveillance strategy might be scanning for zoonotic 'jumps' in selected sentinel human populations rather than a sweeping animal surveillance strategy62, with sentinels chosen according to EID hotspot maps and other factors65 and interesting genomic signals triggering follow-up sequencing in the relevant animal reservoirs. By combining genomic data generated through these targeted surveillance efforts with phylodynamic approaches, it will be possible to take simple presence or absence signals and derive useful epidemiological insights: signals of population expansion; evidence of transmission within and between animal reservoirs and humans; and epidemiological analysis of a pathogen's early expansion.",

In the PREDICT consortium, the HealthMap system89 and local media surveillance were combined to identify 307 health events in five countries over a 16-week period90. PREDICT also suggested a role for digital epidemiology in not just event detection but also the identification of changing EID drivers. EIDs are driven by multiple factors, many of which have digital outputs and represent novel sources of surveillance data91. For example, human movement can be revealed by mobile phone data or by the patterns of lighted cities at night, hunting data collected by states can reveal interactions between humans and wildlife, and social media and digital news sources can reveal early signals of famine, war and other social unrest. A major challenge is that the number of digital data sets available for each driver varies substantially, from hundreds for surveying land use changes \u2014 many based on remote sensing data92 \u2014 to mere handfuls around social inequalities and human susceptibility to infection, with most data biased towards North America and Europe.",

Complicating the existence of a rapid, open, transparent response is the fact that no matter the setting, there are often conflicting interests at work. In an outbreak scenario, conflict may result from governments wishing to keep an outbreak quiet and/or from the tension between lower-income and middle-income countries with few resources for generating and using data and the researchers or response teams from better-resourced settings115. Indeed, the conflicting values in outbreak responses meet the definition of a 'wicked' problem, where issues resist simple resolution and span multiple jurisdictions and where each stakeholder has a different perspective on the solution. Even the International Health Regulations (IHR), which ostensibly provide a legal instrument for global health security, fail to effect a basic surveillance and outbreak response. As of the most recent self-reporting, only 30% of the 196 member countries of the IHR are in compliance, meeting the prescribed minimum public health core capacities5. In these settings, digital pathogen surveillance must be within the purview of the larger global health community and its diverse group of non-state actors rather than being solely the responsibility of nations themselves116. This raises an important issue: if nations are willing to cede a certain amount of surveillance and diagnostic control to the global health community, the notion of reciprocity suggests that they should derive some corresponding local benefit. The 'trickle-down' effects of global genomic surveillance have yet to be fully articulated, but they are likely to be realized first in the zoonotic domain, where global surveillance efforts will feed back into improved animal health at a local level, in turn benefiting local farmers.",

Expert panels convened by Harvard and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine9 and by the National Academy of Medicine8 have called for a central pandemic preparedness and response agency and also underscored the need for deeper partnerships between formal and informal surveillance, epidemiology and academic and public health networks5.

In one such region, the syndromic surveillance system reports higher-than-average sales of a common medication used to relieve fever. Spatial analysis of the data from the pharmacies in the region suggests that the trend is unique to a particular district; a follow-up geographic information system (GIS) analysis using satellite data reveals that this area borders a forest and is increasingly being used for the commercial production of bat guano. An alert is triggered, and the field response team meets with citizens in the area. Nasopharyngeal swabs are taken from humans and livestock with fever as well as from guano and bat tissue collected in the area. The samples are immediately analysed using a portable DNA sequencer coupled to a smartphone. An app on the phone reports the clinical metagenomic results in real time, revealing that in many of the ill humans and animals, a novel coronavirus makes up the bulk of the microbial nucleic acid fraction. The sequencing data are immediately uploaded to a public repository as they are generated, tagged with metadata about the host, sample type and location and stored according to a pathogen surveillance ontology. The data release triggers an announcement via social media of a novel sequence, and within minutes, interested virologists have created a shared online workspace and open lab notebook to collect their analyses of the new pathogen. \nPowerPoint slide\n",
