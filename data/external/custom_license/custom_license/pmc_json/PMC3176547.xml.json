For animal i in disease state X, a value TX(i) is defined, describing the expected time that animal i spends in category X given progression to X at a previous time step. Infection occurs through environmental contamination, which is quantified by the density of infectious pathogen shed by infected animals in categories D and C into the environment. Each individual has its predefined shedding rates \u03baD(i) and \u03baC(i) associated with the diseased and the carrier state, respectively, which are defined as the number of bacteria shed into the environment per unit area per day. It is assumed that the total amount of infectious pathogens shed by individual animals is cumulative and uniformly dispersed, so that all animals have equal exposure to the pathogens in the contaminated environment. Infectious bacteria are assumed to have a mean survival time in the environment of TB days.",

Both the time between successive events (i.e., the interevent time) and the probability of a specific event to occur are determined by the set of individual transition rates rX(i)=1/TX(i) from a state X (X = S, L, D, C, or R) to the next state in the SLDCRS sequence, by the pathogen shedding rates \u03baD(i) and \u03baC(i) and by bacterial decay rates rB = 1/TB as follows: in the population as a whole we define the average rate of infection of susceptible individuals as r1=\u2211i\u2208SrS(i)E, where E is the environmental bacterial load, rS(i)=1/TS(i), and the sum is taken over all susceptible individuals.

            "text": "Field studies have shown that host genetic factors influence an animal\u2019s susceptibility to footrot as well as the speed of recovery and duration of immunity and that these traits are of complex inheritance; i.e., genetic variation is best described by continuous distributions (Raadsma et al. 1994, 1995; Nieuwhof et al. 2008). For ease of interpretation, variation between hosts was considered separately for each host-specific epidemiological trait listed in Table 1 (i.e., TS, TL, TD, TC, TR, \u03baC, or \u03baD). A heritability of 1 was assumed for all traits; i.e., it was assumed that environmental variation is fully represented by the stochastic nature of the model. Values for the host-specific epidemiological trait in question were drawn from a two-parameter continuous gamma distribution with shape parameter \u03b1 and scale parameter \u03b8 [i.e., probability density function is x\u03b1\u22121(exp(\u2212x/\u03b8)/\u0393(\u03b1)\u03b8\u03b1)]. The individual transition rates between successive disease states in the epidemiological model are then the inverse of the corresponding gamma-distributed time periods. Hence, for TX \u223c Gamma (\u03b1, \u03b8), rX = 1/TX \u223c InverseGamma (\u03b1, 1/\u03b8). Gamma distributions can adopt a variety of shapes, such as concave (\u03b1 < 1), nearly symmetric (\u03b1 large), or unimodal and strongly right skewed (\u03b1 \u2248 1). The shape of the probability density function is determined by the shape parameter \u03b1, and the coefficients of variation, dispersion, skewness, and kurtosis, are 1/\u03b1, 1/\u03b1, 2/\u03b1, and 1/\u03b1, respectively. Smaller values of \u03b1 thus indicate greater heterogeneity as well as a greater degree of asymmetry and peakedness. As an example, supershedders in a disease to which the \u201c20/80 rule\u201d (20% of the population contributes 80% of the entire transmission potential) applies (Woolhouse et al. 1997; Matthews et al. 2006) can be represented as the top 20% from the right-hand tail of a gamma distribution for \u03baD or \u03baC with shape parameter \u03b1 = 0.25. From a genetic point of view, the shape of the gamma distribution reflects the genetic architecture of the trait. For example, an infinitesimal genetic model assuming that the trait in question is affected by a large number of genes each with an infinitesimally small effect, would correspond to a symmetric distribution, whereas the presence of few loci with large effects on the trait of interest and an unbalanced allele frequency at these loci in the population, or dominance, could give rise to a skewed distribution.",

Finally, as the stochastic epidemiological model provides continuous information of the disease state of every individual over time, observable phenotypic infection characteristics, such as the frequency of infections (i.e., number of times that the individual moved from state S to L) and the number of days that an individual was infected (i.e., spent in categories L, D, or C) throughout the simulated 3 years, were calculated for each individual. These characteristics may constitute the estimated or observed phenotypes in genetic analyses of field data and hence form the bases of selection or management strategies. We therefore assessed how population averages and variances of these observable infection characteristics are affected by variations in epidemiological input parameters. The averages and variances were calculated as averages over all individuals, over all replicates avoiding stochastic extinction, and refer to the last year in the simulations, i.e., when the system reached a steady state.",

In particular, by representing host heterogeneity with right-skewed gamma distributions, our model results predict that the influence of a large proportion of individuals with low values in a particular trait (e.g., low resistance, low shedding rate, short duration of diseased period, or short-lived immunity) on the disease epidemiology outweighs the influence of a small proportion of individuals with extremely high values for these traits. Thus, the presence of few high shedders does not necessarily increase disease risk if the majority of individuals have low pathogen shedding rates. Also, our results suggest that understanding the source of genetic variation, i.e., identifying the epidemiological trait(s) for which variation occurs, is important when making predictions for epidemiological outcomes and interpreting epidemiological data. Distributions of the same shape for different epidemiological traits often resulted in different predictions for disease risk and severity. The impact of variation in a particular trait depends strongly on the role of this trait in the progression of the disease in the population. For example, both the duration of the infectious period (TD and TC) and bacterial shedding rates (\u03baD and \u03baC) may be considered as measures of host infectivity in field studies. However, whereas shedding rates are incorporated directly into epidemiological models, time periods are usually incorporated through their inverses, as these provide the required transition rates. Hence, even if variation in shedding rates and duration of the infectious period are represented by distributions of similar shape, their impact on the epidemiology can be quite different.",

            "text": "Our study differs from the majority of previous theoretical studies in that it focuses on an infectious disease that is transmitted through an environmental source instead of through direct contact with infectious individuals. This type of disease merits attention as it constitutes a substantial proportion of livestock diseases of major concern for animal and human health. Our results agree with those from studies on directly transmitted diseases in that host genetic heterogeneity can significantly affect the risk of disease emergence (e.g., Hethcote and Van Ark 1987; Lloyd-Smith et al. 2005; Yates et al. 2006) and persistence (e.g., Doeschl-Wilson et al. 2009) and the course of emerging epidemics (e.g., May and Anderson 1988; Springbett et al. 2003; Nath et al. 2008). However, our results provide novel evidence that, for a disease transmitted through the environment, the influence of host genetic variation on disease emergence and severity can strongly depend on environmental conditions. These were found to affect more the degree than the direction of influence. For example, heterogeneity in host susceptibility was found to increase disease risk and severity in all modeled environments but its impact was much stronger when environmental contamination was low (Figures 2, A and B, and 3, A and B). Also, except for populations with large heterogeneity in susceptibility, predicted variances in observable phenotypic infection characteristics were generally lower in these conditions (Table 2), indicating that genetic variation may not be fully observed in environments with low exposure. These results complement the analytical expressions derived by Bishop and Woolliams (2010), which predict that incomplete exposure to infection (e.g., due to low disease prevalence in the population) leads to a downward bias in estimates of genetic variation.",

The study closest to ours in terms of definition of host heterogeneity is that of Lloyd-Smith et al. (2005) who modeled host variation in infectiousness for diseases transmitted through direct contact also with continuous gamma distributions. They established that the probability of extinction increases with increasing dispersion and skewness due to the high proportion of individuals contributing very little to the spread of the disease at the early stages. Our model predicts the same trend for diseases transmitted through environmental sources. However, the models of Lloyd-Smith et al. (2005) also predict for populations avoiding extinction more severe outbreaks as dispersion and skewness increase. In contrast, our model predicts that variation in infectiousness, when represented by the duration of the infectious period or by different shedding rates, tends to decrease disease prevalence at all times. The discrepancy could be attributed to the different modes of disease transmission considered in both models. Compared to directly transmitted diseases, the influence of few highly infectious individuals on the spread of disease is diffused when transmission occurs through an environmental source, whose contamination level is the cumulative contribution of all infectious individuals.",

For example, assuming a finite locus model for genetic variation, with one locus controlling the transmission coefficient (representing host susceptibility to infection) and another locus controlling the recovery rate, Nath et al. (2008) found that genetic variation in the transmission coefficient resulted in higher probabilities of disease emergence, whereas variation in the recovery rate had no such impact. Defining host variation also by few (i.e., two) distinct homogeneous subgroups, Yates et al. (2006) have further shown that variation in host infectivity can greatly reduce the probability of disease emergence. Our model predicts similar trends if host susceptibility, recovery, or infectivity are controlled by multiple loci. However, in contrast to the results of Nath et al. (2008) and our results, Yates et al. (2006) predict that variation in susceptibility will not increase the risk of disease establishment, in particular when bacterial decay is fast. A likely cause for this discrepancy is that Yates et al. (2006) simulated heterogeneous populations by assigning 100 times higher susceptibility to 10% of the individuals than to the rest of the population, thus approximating a negatively skewed distribution in susceptibility rather than the positively skewed distributions considered here. Combining the results of both studies would thus suggest that compared to homogeneous populations with the same average susceptibility, heterogeneous populations with a large proportion of highly susceptible individuals have a higher risk of disease emergence, but the emergence risk will not decrease if the majority of individuals are resistant.",

The latter has long been considered a viable alternative to conventional disease control, but its benefits in terms of reducing disease risk and severity are poorly understood. Our results suggest that accurate predictions of selection response for disease risk and severity require a thorough understanding of the structure of genetic variation, i.e., of the source of genetic variation and the shape of the corresponding distributions. Genetic control strategies in livestock currently focus on exploiting genetic variation in disease resistance as a whole to reduce disease risk and severity. Our results, however, indicate that variation in different epidemiological traits, such as infectiousness or duration of immunity, can influence very differently both disease risk and severity. The question therefore arises whether genetic variation in these alternative traits can be identified using currently available disease data and statistical methods. For example, a recent simulation study (Lipschutz-Powell et al. 2010) demonstrated that classic quantitative genetics models applied to binary incidence data cannot identify genetic variation in infectivity, as an individual\u2019s infectivity is expressed in its group members rather than in the individual itself. Further efforts in more detailed recording of disease data and in the development of adequate genetic models would be required, before this important source of genetic variation can be exploited.",

Genetic analyses of disease data often assume an underlying normally distributed individual liability for disease prevalence (Robertson and Lerner 1949; Falconer and Mackay 1996). Although this assumption may hold for diseases for which many genes have small additive effects on epidemiological parameters, skewed leptokurtic distributions may be more appropriate for diseases where a number of genes have large effects and allele frequencies are unbalanced or in cases where the relationship between genetic effects and the epidemiological traits in consideration is not linear. Our results suggest that greater attention should be given to the assumptions concerning liability distributions in genetic analyses of disease data, as disease risk and prevalence depend strongly on the shape of the distributions. Wrong assumptions could not only lead to biased estimates of genetic parameters, but also produce wrong predictions for the selection response. Recent advances in genomic studies could provide the opportunity to accurately describe the genetic architecture that defines the shape of the distribution in epidemiological traits of interest.",

For example, selecting against high susceptibility would not only increase the average disease resistance in future generations, but also decrease the proportion of highly susceptible individuals in the frequency distribution for susceptibility. On the basis of our predictions, the associated changes in the shape of the distribution would decrease the future risk of disease establishment and disease severity much more than would be anticipated from classical quantitative genetics theory alone, which does not account for changes in the distributions\u2019 shapes. Finally, the results of our study elucidate that the choice of the most appropriate selection strategy would depend on the parent and offspring environment. For example, whereas our results suggest that selection against high susceptibility would be the most efficient means to reduce disease risk and prevalence in environments with low contamination risk, selection for fast recovery would be advantageous if the contamination risk is high. Given thus the results from this study, among the next steps to be taken in the genetic control of infectious disease are a more accurate description of genetic heterogeneity among individuals and the development of statistical methods to account for different types and shapes of genetic variation in the analysis of disease data and in genetic\u2013epidemiological models.",
