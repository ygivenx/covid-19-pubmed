Sixty lactating Holstein cattle ranging from 3 to 8 years of age were identified for this study according to computer records (Table 1). All cattle were housed on a single dairy farm in North Carolina. This farm had never used an autogenous or commercially available Salmonella vaccine, and there had not been a diagnosis of clinical salmonellosis on the farm for at least 10 years. Although extensive testing had not been done to rule out the presence of subclinical salmonellosis in the herd, the farm had extensive diagnostic testing records of both calves and adult cattle. This data included fecal cultures from healthy animals as well as those with diarrhea along with numerous necropsy reports spanning a period of 10 years. During this time period, there had never been a positive Salmonella culture on the farm. A search of the farm's records identified the next 60 cows scheduled for dry\u2010off. These cows were randomly allocated to serve in either \u201cvaccinated\u201d or \u201ccontrol\u201d groups by assigning every other cow in the computer\u2010generated list to opposite groups. Thirty cows were allocated to a group that was vaccinated at the end of lactation (dry\u2010off). During the week, the cow was scheduled to be dried off (8\u2010week dry period), 10 mL of blood was collected and each cow was vaccinated with 2 mL of a commercially available Salmonella enterica serotype Newport bacterial extract1 given SC in the neck. The vaccine has a conditional license in the United States and is approved for use in cattle 6 months of age and older. An additional 30 cows were allocated to the control group and received 2 mL of saline SC in the neck during the week of dry\u2010off. Cows were identified with neck bands by group at the time of initial vaccination. Four weeks after the initial injection, all cows in the \u201cvaccinated\u201d group received a 2nd dose of (2 mL) Salmonella Newport vaccine, whereas the control group again received saline. Cows were housed together in a grass calving lot during the dry period, and were fed a total mixed ration (TMR).",

The average of the negative controls' optical density was calculated and subtracted from all values as a reagent blank. Individual test variability was factored out by analyzing the optical density (OD) reading and factored out a known positive and negative OD reading from the same test. Then the sample duplicates were averaged and divided by the positive control average yielding the S : P titer.",

Whether these antibodies would offer significant protection against Salmonella infections in the first few weeks of life remains to be determined. Although limited research has been done to this point looking at the ability of passive immunization to offer protection against Salmonella infections early in life, this suggests that this approach may offer some potential. In a study done in the 1960s, calves that received colostrum from cows vaccinated with a killed S. Typhimurium vaccine showed a reduction in fecal shedding of Salmonella after challenge.6 In another study, a group of dairy cows were vaccinated 2 and 7 weeks before calving with a killed S. Typhimurium vaccine, whereas another group was left unvaccinated.7 Calves were divided into several groups: those allowed to nurse colostrum from a vaccinated dam for 48 hours and then fed colostrum from the same dam throughout the challenge period (VC/VM); calves allowed to nurse colostrum from a vaccinated dam for 48 hours and then fed colostrum from an unvaccinated cow throughout the study (VC/NM); cows that suckled an unvaccinated dam for 48 hours and then were fed colostrum from a vaccinated cow after day 2 (NC/VM); and calves that suckled an unvaccinated cow and were fed colostrum from unvaccinated cows through the challenge period (NC/NM). All calves were challenged with S. Typhimurium on day 5. Death rates were significantly reduced in cows that were allowed to suckle cows that had been vaccinated before calving (0% and 22% in the VC/VM and VC/NM groups) as compared to calves that received colostrum from unvaccinated cows (75% and 50% death rate in the NC/NM and NC/VM groups). Fecal shedding of Salmonella organisms was also shorter in calves that nursed colostrum from vaccinated cows.",

However, more recent advancements have led to vaccines that offer cross\u2010protection against multiple bacterial strains across different Salmonella serogroups. Some of these are modified live vaccines that contain mutations in different regions of the bacterial genome.9 The vaccine used in this trial is a subunit vaccine that is composed of purified extracts of siderophore receptors and porins (SRP).10 These SRP proteins are shared by all Salmonella organisms and are critical for iron acquisition by the bacteria. The goal of the vaccine is to inactivate SRP proteins by antibody binding to restrict the ability of the bacteria to gain iron from the environment. Therefore, the vaccine has the potential to induce immunity to multiple serogroups of Salmonella. Further research is necessary to determine whether or not this vaccine would be able to prevent Salmonella infections in calves and what strains it would be effective against.",

Experimental studies with aro minus vaccines have demonstrated good protection against several different Salmonella serovars when calves were challenged within 3 weeks after vaccination.12 The current dilemma is providing some immunity to young calves when Salmonella challenge occurs within the first few weeks of life. The use of dry cow vaccination to stimulate colostral antibodies that can be absorbed by the calf at birth offers a way to provide some degree of protection to these calves until they are old enough to be given a modified live vaccine. This study suggests such a strategy is possible; however, further challenge studies are needed to confirm that the presence of Salmonella antibody in the calves will actually provide a significant benefit from bacterial challenge.",
