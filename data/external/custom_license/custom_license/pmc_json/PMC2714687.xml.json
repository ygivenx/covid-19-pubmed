Evidence that this new strain could pass from human to human led the World Health Organization to quickly raise its pandemic alert level to phase 5, representing \u201ca strong signal that a pandemic is imminent and that the time to finalise the organisation, communication and implementation of the planned mitigation measures is short.\u201d1 This was subsequently raised to phase 6, indicating that a full global pandemic was under way. Given the lack of any specific vaccine against swine flu, mitigation measures in the United Kingdom have so far focused on identifying, treating, and isolating people who have the disease and educating the public about the steps that individuals can take to reduce the risk of transmission. These recommendations include using tissues when sneezing, washing hands regularly with soap and water, and setting up a network of \u201cflu friends\u201d to provide mutual assistance should someone become ill.2\n3",

Maximising response rates takes time, however.26 Yet after a major incident, data on perceptions and behaviours must be collected quickly if they are to have any impact on policy.25 Because speed was important, we elected to use random digit dialling with quota sampling so that the demographic distribution of our sample matched that of the population of England, Scotland, and Wales. In practice the use of quotas prevented only 55 potential respondents from participating. The low response rate (7%) may be of more concern, although as participants were not informed of the survey topic until consent had been obtained, any non-response bias on the basis of interest in the topic should have been minimal. Given the nature of this telephone survey, we were unable to obtain any data about non-responders with which to assess potential bias.",

If \u201coften\u201d is defined as 10 times or more a day4 then 41.3% of our sample met the criterion for compliance. If defined as five or more times a day,27 then 76.9% met the criterion. Using compliance rather than behaviour change as the outcome might have resulted in a different set of findings. However, while such data are of importance to disease modellers and policy makers, from the perspective of assessing public responses to an incident, behaviour change is the key indicator to consider. Compliance by default among people who frequently wash their hands is of lesser interest.",

Use of tissues was not included as this is important for the protection of others rather than oneself and hence may be qualitatively different in terms of its relation with predictor variables.",

Equally, understanding how the public responds to reports of a potential pandemic may also be useful in identifying ways of encouraging behaviour change during the early stages of any future outbreak of infectious disease.",

The perception that government warnings or media stories represent scare mongering may be difficult to tackle but requires further attention.
