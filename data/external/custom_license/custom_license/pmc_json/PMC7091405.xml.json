            "text": "Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are the most frequent cause of acute upper respiratory tract infections in humans and are usually responsible for 30\u201350% of cases of common cold [1\u20133]. However, they may also be associated with more-severe lower respiratory tract infections. Rhinoviruses have been isolated from cases of cystic fibrosis, otitis media, sinusitis, asthma, exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and pneumonia, especially in children, in the elderly, and in immunocompromised patients [4\u201314]. Evidence demonstrating that HRV disease is not exclusively limited to the upper airways and may cause lower respiratory complications, together with the frequency of HRV infections and the increasing number of immunocompromised patients underline the need for rapid and accurate diagnosis of HRV infections. Two nucleic acid amplification techniques (NAATs) are actually available for the detection of HRV: reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) [15, 16], and nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) [17, 18]. NASBA has proven to be highly sensitive, specific, and more rapid than RT-PCR technique [19, 20]. Currently, only qualitative NASBA kits for the detection of HRV are commercially available (registered trademarks owned of bioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy L\u2019Etoile, France), while there are no quantitative NASBA kits. Some quantitative molecular beacon real-time NASBA assays have been described in the literature, mainly for the identification of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), respiratory syncytial virus A and B, influenza A virus (H1N1), Trypanosoma brucei, Aspergillus fumigatus, Plasmodium species, and Listeria monocytogenes [21\u201329]. However, these real-time NASBA assays use mathematical models for the analysis of results that requires employing of specific complex software calibrated to each target [30]. Other quantitative NASBA assays, instead, compute the ratio of the time to positivity (TTP) values for both the target RNA and internal control by using standard curves with a correlation coefficient less than 0.99 (R\n2 < 0.99), index of an insensitive assay [19, 24, 26].",

Subsequently, a mix containing buffer 5\u00d7 [250 mM Tris\u2013HCl (pH 8.3 at 25\u00b0C), 375 mM KCl, and 50 mM DTT], MgCl2 (25 mM), ImpromII RT (1 U/\u03bcl), and Recombinant RNasin\u00ae Ribonuclease Inhibitor (40 U/\u03bcl) (Promega) was added.

To generate the IC RNA, the U1A molecule was extracted from a clinical specimen, precisely from a human bronchoalveolar lavage sample, and subjected to reverse transcription (RT) reaction by using random primers (600 ng/\u03bcl) and ImpromII RT (1 U/\u03bcl).

            "text": "Primers and molecular beacon probes were obtained from literature [31, 32] (Table 2), synthesized by Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium), and diluted to a final concentration of 100 \u03bcmol/l. Moreover, to maximize the oligonucleotides stabilization, we added 60% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to primers and beacons mixture. The HRV beacon was labeled with FAM at its 5\u2032-end and quencher DABCYL at its 3\u2032-end, while the IC beacon contained a ROX at its 5\u2032-end and a DABCYL quencher at the 3\u2032-end. The stability and predicted structure of the beacons were analyzed by using the European MFOLD server (http://frontend.bioinfo.rpi.edu/applications/mfold/cgi-bin/dna-form1.cgi). Real-time NASBA reaction was performed on a NucliSens EasyQ analyzer (BioM\u00e9rieux) using the NucliSENS EasyQ Basic Kit Version 2 (bioM\u00e9rieux, Lyon, France) for the amplification according to the manufacturer\u2019s manual. To obtain the best amplification efficiency, conditions for the real-time NASBA assay were optimized until the best primers, beacons, and KCl concentrations were determined. Titrations of IC RNA (between 10 and 106 copies) and HRV RNA were performed to determine the optimal amount of internal control to generate the greatest dynamic range for the assay without interference with the detection of HRV RNA (data not shown). As a result, each reaction was run with the addition of 105 copies of the IC RNA. Briefly, a total volume of 10 \u03bcl of reaction mixture containing 80 mM KCl and 0.3 \u03bcM of the HRV- and IC-specific primers was incubated with 2.5 \u03bcl HRV RNA and 2.5 \u03bcl IC RNA in the presence of 0.05 \u03bcM of HRV- and IC-molecular beacons at 65\u00b0C for 2 min to denature secondary structure RNA. The reaction was subsequently cooled to 41\u00b0C for 2 min to anneal the primers before adding 5 \u03bcl of enzyme mixture containing avian myeloblastosis virus retrotranscriptase, RNase H, and T7 RNA polymerase. After a brief centrifugation and gentle mixing by tapping, the tubes were then incubated at 41\u00b0C for 90 min. To estimate the dynamic range of the real-time NASBA assay (range of concentrations over which the method performs in a linear manner with an acceptable level of trueness and precision), we used HRV standard dilutions from 108 copies/\u03bcl to 1 copy/\u03bcl. Sensitivity of NASBA assay was determined by the lowest standard dilution consistently detectable in replicate reactions at frequency of 100%, whereas the limit of detection by the lowest concentration of target quantified. Nuclease-free water was included as the no-template control (NTC) to serve as a control for background fluorescence. The fluorescence signal was measured with an interval time of 45 s for each independent reaction at two wavelengths using the accompanying NucliSENS EasyQ Director software (Version 2.0). Following amplification, a specific fluorescence value was chosen as a positive signal (threshold level = 1.1). Using this value for all reactions in one experiment, the time that the target and IC amplification curves reached the threshold level was recorded as the time to positivity (TTP). HRV TTP values were regressed against the original standard curve to generate a predicted amount of target RNA. In particular, for data analysis, Excel calculation engine was used. NASBA dynamic range was calculated from TTP values regressed against the standard curve by using an Excel spreadsheet that was created \u201cad hoc\u201d by us. In particular, for each individual HRV standard dilution (from 108 copies/reaction to 1 copy/reaction), fluorescent threshold levels of target close to 1.1 and values of the corresponding minutes were extrapolated by the NucliSENS EasyQ Director software. Therefore, minutes were normalized to a value of threshold level = 1.1, and the natural logarithm of normalized minutes was calculated. Quantification capacity was assessed by plotting the TTP values obtained against the logarithm of the number of target molecules in each dilution and calculating a linear regression.\n",

In particular, we used four different dilutions (102, 103, 104, and 105 copies/reaction) of quantification standards. Each dilution was analyzed 10 times, with the same method on identical test items in the same laboratory by the same operator using the same equipment. Regarding intermediate reproducibility, each dilution was analyzed with the same method on identical test items in 10 different runs performed by three different operators using different equipment on different days. Moreover, we used the Dixon\u2019s test to examine if one measure from 10 replicate measures that we performed (102, 103, 104, and 105) could be rejected or not, and the Shapiro\u2013Wilk\u2019s test to compare these measures against the normal distribution.

            "text": "Viral respiratory tract infections have been recognized as a predominant cause of human disease. To improve clinical management of such patients, it is important to obtain an accurate diagnosis and to identify the causative agent early in infection to ensure appropriate treatment. In this study, we developed the first quantitative NASBA assay for the detection of HRV serotypes. By combining NASBA amplification with molecular beacon probes, this assay becomes a real-time analysis tool that offers faster results than conventional RT-PCR technique. Since NASBA amplification involves three separate enzymes each with their own kinetic parameters, variability in every measurement is inevitable [19]. Weusten et al. [30] were the first to describe a mathematical model for RNA amplification of both target and internal calibrator RNA in a molecular beacon-based NASBA reaction to normalize enzyme efficiency differences between reactions. However, the description of this model did not include all of the essential parameters needed to operate the model. Consequently, analysis using this model requires software calibrated to each target and is commercially available for only a few specific targets. Here, we describe an alternative method for normalizing NASBA data by using a simple TPP calculation in the presence of an internal control that reduces the variability between replicates and increases the precision, trueness, and accuracy for predicting unknown concentrations of HRV RNA. It has been shown that tube to tube variation within NASBA can be normalized with the addition of an internal control in each reaction [34, 35]. In particular, the optimal concentration for the internal calibrator should be determined as the concentration providing the greatest dynamic range of amplification of both the target and internal control RNA. In our study, a fixed amount of 105 copies of the internal calibrator RNA was optimal for the assay reported here (data not shown). Furthermore, the addition of an internal control is fundamental to identify false negative results because of reaction failure, and to monitor the effects of unknown sample factors that might interfere with the amplification kinetics. As concerns the importance of primers and KCl for NASBA optimization, their role has not been emphasized to date. NASBA is an isothermal nucleic acid amplification method able to specifically amplify target RNA by using specific primers in a KCl background. Initially, the concentration of the primers relative to the total concentration of amplifiable RNA is very high, is not rate limiting, and relatively small amounts of primers are consumed in depletion of the initially present pool of RNA copies (linear phase of NASBA process). At some time point, obviously, the primers\u2019 concentrations do become rate limiting, and decline to practically zero. At this time point, the DNA intermediate levels have reached their maximum and RNA production proceeds at high speed. From now on, the only reaction that can proceed is T7 RNA polymerase-mediated formation of RNA from the DNA intermediate templates. This time interval represents the second phase of NASBA process characterized by an exponential kinetics. We observed that high concentrations of primers and KCl elongate the linear phase of NASBA process by shorting the exponential amplification; whereas, low concentrations of primers and KCl promote the exponential phase. In particular, in this study we used relatively low concentrations of primers and KCl (0.3 \u03bcM and 80 mM, respectively) to elongate the exponential phase of NASBA process, and accordingly, to minimize the reaction-to-reaction variation. By using this simple expedient, we have significantly increased our accuracy, precision, and trueness of prediction over the standard TTP calculations. In summary, we describe a simplified method of calculating unknown concentrations of target RNA using an internal calibrator. This method allowed for greater precision, accuracy, and trueness for predicting HRV RNA over the standard TTP analysis. In conclusion, we described the first real-time NASBA assay capable of accurate quantification of HRV RNA making it a valuable tool in the molecular diagnostics of HRV serotypes.",
