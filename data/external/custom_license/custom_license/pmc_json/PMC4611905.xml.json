On physical examination, she was conscious but swallowing, chewing and speech functions damaged, muscle strength was 0/5 and deep tendon reflexes (DTRs) were absent, the plantar response was flexor. Physical examination of other systems was normal. Complete blood count, electrolytes and blood biochemistry and urinalysis were normal, C-reactive protein was negative and erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 20 mm/h. Chest radiography was normal. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure, glucose, and protein were normal. Blood, urine, and CSF cultures were negative. Stool and nasal swab cultures were taken. Electroneuromyography (ENMG) revealed no pathological findings. No abnormalities in the brain and spinal cord magnetic resonance imaging were detected - so intracranial and spinal pathologies were excluded.",
