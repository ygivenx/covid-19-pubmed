IB has been reported frequently in China since it first appeared in 1965 [1], although some vaccines have been adopted. The variation of serotypes of prevalent IBV may decrease the effect of some IBV vaccines used in some countries. Currently, the Chinese IBV isolates H120 and H52 are commonly used vaccine strains in China. The application of these vaccines in most of the chicken farms has decreased the large-scale outbreak of IB in China, however, the sporadic occurrences of IB are reported frequently. The primary target of IBV is the respiratory tract, and some isolates also replicate in the kidney and oviduct, resulting in nephritis and reduced egg production, respectively [2].",

IBV has three major structural proteins, which include the spike (S), the membrane (M), and the nucleocapsid (N) protein. The structural genes, together with other open reading frames (ORFs), organize the typical avian coronavirus genome characterized in order of 5\u2032-Pol-S-3a-3b-E-M-5a-5b-N-UTR-3\u2032 [9]. The spike of IBV is formed by post-translational cleavage of two separate polypeptide components, designated S1 and S2 [10]. The S1 glycoprotein is associated with virus attachment and is a major target of the neutralizing antibodies in chickens. It is commonly accepted that the serotype of IBV is determined by the S gene, particularly the hypervariable S1 gene. The N protein of IBV is the preferred protein to use in development of group-specific serologic assays and is produced abundantly during infection, and has high immunogenicity, readily inducing antibodies and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte immunity in chickens [11].",

When synthesized in the absence of other viral components, M protein tends to accumulate in the Golgi complex as detergent-insoluble, polymeric structures, presumably as part of its retention mechanism [13, 14]. The M protein as the major inducing component has been proposed to play a role in interferon induction [15, 16]. It was demonstrated that the coexpression of M and E proteins allowed the formation of pseudoparticles, which exhibited an interferogenic activity similar to that of complete virions [17].",

However, the IBV S1 region displays very distinctive difference with the vaccine strain H120 that is used for vaccination in northeastern China. There are several papers describing the epidemic situation regarding IBV in China, based on the S1 gene sequences [18\u201321]. Evidently, the genotypic and phenotypic characterization of IBV is important for analyzing IBV variations [22]. In this paper, we further characterized the IBV isolate and cloned the M gene. The phylogenetic relationships among the IBV isolates derived from different countries or regions were investigated by sequence comparison and phylogenetic tree topology. This study provides useful information of a Chinese isolate of IBV, which may assist in elucidating the genetic evolution of IBV in China.",

Currently the major control measures of IB are vaccination of live attenuated IBV vaccine (Mass serotypes) such as H52, H120, and Ma5 strains in China; however, the chicken flocks vaccinated with the live vaccines usually fail to present full protection to field virulent IBV challenge, and the vaccinated chicken flocks were often subjected to the attack of nephropathogenic IBV. [25]. In our study, the nephropathogenic IBV isolate HH06 was also isolated from a chicken flock vaccinated with live attenuated vaccine (H120 strain) and experiencing IBV infection, supporting the notion that Mass serotype of live attenuated IBV vaccine might be not ideal in protection of chickens in some places in China.",

The sequencing results indicated that the HH06 shared a very high similarity with many Chinese IBV isolates, however, it had a very low sequence identity with the IBV vaccine strain H120, although IBV HH06 was isolated from the suspected young chicken flock that had been vaccinated with IBV H120. The emerging of IBV HH06 supports the notion that variant IBV isolates can be obtained from vaccinated birds because cross neutralization does not occur between different serotypes. Because both sequence comparison and phylogenetic tree analysis showed that HH06 had a distant relation to H120, we believe that the local prevalence of HH06 may be attributed to the failure of traditional viral vaccine. In addition, our animal experiments show that kidney injury is one of the serious signs of IBV-infected chicken.",

Many aspects of IBV have been extensively studied [27\u201332].

In agreement with the sequence comparison, the tree topology showed the IBV isolates have been divided into several branches, and most Chinese isolates including HH06 isolate were closely clustered in the phylogenetic tree. Most American IBV isolates were also located in neighbored branches. Interestingly, many Chinese IBV isolates that were from different places shared the same branch. For example, SAIBK isolated from Sichuan Province, partridge/GD/S14/2003 and LDT3 isolated from Guangdong Province, and HH06 isolated in Northern China shared the same branch and displayed closer relationships. This result, together with the sequence comparison, allows us to hypothesize that some Chinese IBV isolates may have a common ancestor, although they were isolated from the different regions in mainland China. Particularly, it should be noted that the IBV LDT3 is a peafowl isolate [19, 36]. However, the distinctive dissimilarity between many Chinese isolates and the widely used IBV vaccine strain such as H120 and H52 also indicates that the antigenic drift is likely to occur among some Chinese IBV strains under the long-term immune pressure.",
