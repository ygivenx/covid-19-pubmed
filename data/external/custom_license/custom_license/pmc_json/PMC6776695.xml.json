Acoustic angiography35, 36 revealed angiogenesis and the formation of large blood vessels (Fig. 1d, left panel). Vasculature was also observed within the human lung implant (Fig. 1d, right panel). Fig. 1e and Supplementary Video show a 3D reconstruction of the implant, illustrating its structure and extensive vasculature. Finally, surgical excision of a human lung implant revealed its well-defined structure and internal vasculature (Fig. 1f).",

We injected cell-free HCMV TB40/E, a clinical HCMV strain, into the human lung implants of LoM. HCMV-DNA was detected in the lung implants of LoM as early as 4 days post inoculation (mean: 4.70\u00d7103 \u00b1 2.54\u00d7103 s.e.m. HCMV-DNA copies/105 cells, range: 2.94\u00d7102-1.19\u00d7104 HCMV-DNA copies/105 cells) (Fig. 2k). HCMV immediate early (IE), early (E) and late (L) proteins were detected in lung implants at 14 and 52 days post-inoculation indicating that HCMV infection was maintained over time (Fig. 2l). The expression of IE proteins is consistent with lytic HCMV replication in this model as observed during human primary infection and reactivation42. In vivo, HCMV antigen was observed in human mesenchymal cells (Fig. 2m). We determined the effect of pre-exposure prophylaxis with ganciclovir (GCV) on HCMV replication in LoM. GCV was administered once daily two days prior to and 14 days after inoculation of HCMV TB40/E expressing luciferase (Fig. 2n). HCMV replication was monitored over time by measuring luciferase activity. By four days post-exposure, HCMV levels were ~66% lower in the human lung implants of GCV-treated LoMs (mean: 3.36\u00d7105 \u00b1 1.61 \u00d7105 s.e.m. radiance) compared to untreated controls (mean: 1.00\u00d7106 \u00b1 2.90 \u00d7105 s.e.m. radiance) (Fig. 2n). HCMV levels continued to decline over time in GCV-treated LoM. At the end of the GCV treatment course (14 days post HCMV exposure), HCMV levels were ~2 logs lower in the lung implants of GCV-treated LoM (mean: 1.48\u00d7105 \u00b1 4.96 \u00d7104 s.e.m. radiance) compared to untreated LoMs (mean: 8.99\u00d7106 \u00b1 5.02 \u00d7106 s.e.m. radiance) (Fig. 2n). Suprisingly, after GCV treatment was discontinued, HCMV levels continued to decline. By 25 days post HCMV-exposure (11 days after the last GCV dose), HCMV levels in the lung implants of GCV-treated LoM were further reduced by ~40% (mean: 9.25\u00d7104 \u00b1 2.65 \u00d7104 s.e.m. radiance) and significantly lower than untreated controls (mean: 3.27\u00d7107 \u00b1 1.69 \u00d7107 s.e.m. radiance) (Fig. 2n). Together, these results demonstrate the ability of LoM to sustain replication of several clinically relevant human pathogens and to serve as a platform for the in vivo testing of existing and novel antimicrobials.",

Since natural infections are typically asymptomatic and undiagnosed, the profile of HCMV genes expressed during lytic replication in vivo has not been determined on a genome-wide scale due to the difficulty of obtaining acutely infected samples. To define the complement of HCMV genes expressed in human tissue in vivo, we injected cell-free HCMV TB40/E into the human lung implants of LoM. HCMV (ds)cDNA was enriched with biotinylated probes spanning both strands of the entire HCMV genome and next generation sequencing used to measure viral gene expression. Using this novel approach, we were able to measure, for the first time, the complement of viral genes expressed in vivo in human tissue during lytic replication. Results revealed widespread HCMV gene expression spanning the viral genome, consistent with robust lytic replication (Supplementary Fig. 4). Expression of known lytic genes encoding IE proteins IE1 (UL123) and IE2 (UL122), early proteins (UL44 and UL38), and late proteins pp65 (UL83) and pp71 (UL82) were detected. By contrast, expression of UL138, a well-characterized latency gene, was not observed. These results serve as proof-of-principle of the utility of LoM to investigate key aspects of HCMV replication in human lung tissue in vivo.",

IE1-specific CD8+ T cell responses measured by ICS were detected more frequently in repeatedly HCMV exposed mice than in singly exposed BLT-L mice (Fischer\u2019s exact, two-tailed p=0.039) (Fig. 5d,e and Supplementary Tables 4, 7 and 8).

Despite a 111\u2013120 day follow-up (post first HCMV exposure), no IE1-specific T cell IFN-\u03b3+/CD107a+ responses were detected (Fig. 5e, Supplementary Table 7). T cells and mDCs in this cohort were functional; specifically, mitogenic stimulation of T cells induced potent cytokine production and degranulation and autologous mDCs induced a mixed-lymphocyte reaction (MLR) when co-cultured with allogeneic PBMC (data not shown). These results suggest that a limited repertoire of HLA presented viral peptides impedes the generation of antigen-specific adaptive immune response in vivo.",

Two pieces of autologous human lung tissue (~2\u20134 mm3) was implanted subcutaneously into the right and left back. Following tissue implantation animals received a bone marrow transplant (via tail vein injection) of autologous liver-derived human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells. The non-CD34+ cell fraction was used for 4-digit HLA typing at the HLA-A, B and C loci. Reconstitution of BLT-L mice with human hematopoeitic cells was monitored longitudinally by flow cytometry as previously described13, 14, 62\u201364.

Prior to primary antibody incubation, antigen retrieval was performed and Ig-binding sites and endogenous peroxidase activity blocked. Tissue sections were developed using the MACH-3\u2122 polymer system (Biocare Medical) and DAB (Vector Laboratories), counterstained with hematoxylin and mounted. Immunofluorescence staining was also performed on 4% PFA or formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue sections. Following antigen retrieval and blocking with 5% serum (corresponding to the secondary antibody\u2019s host species), 0.1% Triton x100, and 50% Rodent M block (Biocare Medical) in PBS, tissue sections were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4\u00b0C. Tissue sections were then stained with fluorescent conjugated secondary antibodies followed by DAPI and then mounted. Primary antibodies were directed against human epithelial cells (cytokeratin 19), endothelial cells (CD34), mesenchymal cells (vimentin), hematopoietic cells (CD45), macrophages (CD68), dendritic cells (CD11c), natural killer (NK) cells/NK T cells (CD56), B cells (CD20), T cells (CD3), CD4+ cells (CD4), CD8+ cells (CD8) (Life Sciences Reporting Summary). Primary antibodies directed against mouse endothelial cells (mCD34), epithelial cells (mcytokeratin 19), and hematopoietic cells (mCD45) were used to distinguish the presence of mouse cells (Life Sciences Reporting Summary). Primary antibodies directed against HCMV glycoprotein B, immediate early (IE), early (E) and late (L) proteins were used to detect HCMV positive cells (Life Sciences Reporting Summary). Tissue sections were stained with an anti-ZIKV NS2B antibody to detect ZIKV infected cells. Small pieces of human lung implant tissue collected from MERS-CoV infected LoM were fixed in 10% formalin for >7 days at 4\u00b0C, embedded in paraffin, sectioned (5 \u00b5m) and stained with MERS-CoV nucleocapsid polyclonal antibody (Life Sciences Reporting Summary). Tissue sections were also stained with appropriate isotype negative control antibodies. Tissue sections for immunohistochemistry were imaged on a Nikon Eclipse Ci microscope using Nikon Elements BR software (version 4.30.01) with a Nikon Digital Sight DS-Fi2 camera and Brightness and contrast were adjusted on whole images in Adobe Photoshop (CS6). Tissue sections for immunofluorescence were imaged on an Olympus BX61 upright wide field microscope using Improvision\u2019s Velocity software (version X) with a Hammatuse ORCA RC camera. Brightness and contrast were adjusted on whole images using ImageJ software (version 1.51C). In Fig. 2b, d, h and m, pseudocoloring was used to depict MERS-CoV, ZIKV, RSV and HCMV antigen in green and human cell types in magenta. In Fig. 1i and j, Fig. 2i and Supplementary Fig. 1b, where red/green fluorescent images were originally captured the red fluorescent signal was digitally altered to improve visualization by colorblind readers by adjusting the red channel hue by \u221245 using Adobe Photoshop (CS6).",

Next, cells were stained with Zombie NIR viability dye at RT 20 min, then labelled with CD3-BV421; CD4-BV650; CD8-BV510; PerCP-conjugated CD14, 16, 19, and 56 (dump channel) at RT 15 min. Cells were fixed, permeabilized and stained intracellularly with either IFN-\u03b3-PE. For detection of IFN-\u03b3/TNF-\u03b1, monensin/Brefeldin A was added to co-cultures which were then incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2. The next day, cells were stained with Zombie NIR and lymphocyte markers are described above. Cells were fixed, permeabilized and stained intracellularly with IFN-\u03b3-FITC and TNF\u03b1-PE/Dazzyle\u2122594 (Life Sciences Reporting Summary). In all assays, fluorescence minus one (FMO) controls were used for gating of CD107a, cytokine and CD8 reactive populations. For compensation, beads were used for all colors excepting Zombie. For Zombie, live and dead (heat inactivated) cells were mixed and Zombie stained to generated positive and negative populations. All cells were acquired using an LSRFortessa flow cytometer and data analyzed with FlowJo Software (version 10) (gating strategies illustrated in Supplementary Figure 11a,b). T cell responses were expressed as frequency of either CD8+ or CD4+ T cell lymphocytes. A HCMV-specific T cell response met the following criteria: >10000 CD4 or CD8 positive events, > 0.01% of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells; a minimum of 10 events in the IFN-\u03b3 /CD107a or IFN-\u03b3 /TNF-\u03b1 double-positive gate, 2\u00d7 no-peptide control.",
