It involves a cohesive network of polarized cells and restricts the flux of fluids, ions and pathogens into and out of the respiratory organs. An increasing number of pathogenic human viruses are found to be transmitted between mucosal epithelia of individuals, including human immune deficiency virus HIV, influenza virus, enteroviruses, hepatitis A, B, C and E viruses, poxviruses and also human adenoviruses1,2. Adenoviruses are an environmental risk factor outnumbering the ubiquitous enteroviruses in surface waters3. Of the 55 human adenovirus types known today (http://www.vmri.hu/~harrach/AdVtaxlong.htm), more than one third is associated with disease. Fatal cases of adenovirus infections are mostly due to T-lymphocyte deficiencies and occur in immunosuppressed patients4. In normal individuals, respiratory epithelial cells are initial sites for infection, although the underlying mechanisms are unknown. This leads to respiratory disease, gastroenteritis, acute haemorrhagic cystitis, meningoencephalitis and conjunctivitis5,6,7.",

We validated this observation with two different human lung epithelial cell lines, bronchial epithelial 16HBE14o cells and alveolar type II epithelial A549 cells. When grown to confluent monolayers on transwell filters and inoculated with a non-replicating adenovirus reporter, which expresses murine interleukin (IL)-2 (Ad5-muIL2, muIL2 expression is hereafter referred to as infection)17, both cell types were poorly infected from the apical side, but were strongly infected from the basolateral side yielding infection levels of 20\u201340% of nonpolarized cell infections (Fig. 1a).

Isolated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)-derived macrophages could not be infected with Ad5-muIL2 up to 45 h postinfection (pi), unlike 16HBE14o cells (Supplementary Fig. S2a). As expected, PBMC-derived macrophages did not express the Ad2/5 attachment receptor CAR, and had moderate levels of \u03b1\u03bd\u03b23/5 integrins on their surface (Supplementary Fig. S2b18). To mimic the natural situation of macrophage-controlled mucosal epithelia, we seeded macrophages onto the apical side of polarized 16HBE14o monolayers and allowed attachment for 24 h. Transmission electron microscopy of macrophage and 16HBE14o co-cultures showed intact epithelial monolayers with macrophages attached to the apical membranes (Fig. 1c). On apical inoculation of co-cultures with Ad5 wildtype for 1 h, virions could be readily detected in vesicular structures of macrophages and to a much lower degree in epithelial cells (Fig. 1c,d). Epithelial cells cultured without macrophages contained no detectable virus particles (not shown). When co-cultures were inoculated with Ad5-muIL2 for 20 or 30 h, we detected no significant differences between apical or basolateral inoculations, whereas polarized epithelial cells without macrophages were not infected by apical inoculation (Fig. 1e). These data indicate a crucial role for macrophages in Ad5 infection of epithelial layers consisting of macrophages and epithelial cells.",

            "text": "Macrophage-mediated apical infection depends either on direct interactions of macrophages with epithelial cells, or on messengers secreted from macrophages, such as cytokines. We tested whether the supernatant from macrophages inoculated with adenovirus, the so-called conditioned medium (CM), was sufficient to increase the Ad5-muIL2 infection of polarized epithelial cells. PBMC-derived human macrophages were inoculated with Ad2 for 4 h; the medium was collected and cleared by centrifugation and added to polarized 16HBE14o cells for 4 h, followed by apical inoculation with Ad5-muIL2 for 20 or 30 h (Fig. 2a). Stimulation of polarized cells with CM led to strong increase of apical infection compared with non-stimulated cells (Fig. 2b). Although we observed variations of CM potencies between macrophages from different blood donors, the typical increase of viral infection was 8- to 12-fold. In all instances, the maximal stimulation of apical infection was obtained at 4\u20138 h post stimulation (Fig. 2c). Interestingly, the infection stimulation was much stronger, if CM was applied apically than basolaterally, and was only marginally increased by simultaneous addition to both apical and the basal domains compared with apical stimulation (Fig. 2d). Importantly, the CM did not lose its potency by previous centrifugation under conditions, which completely pelleted viral particles (Supplementary Fig. S3a). Heat inactivation of CM at 75 \u00b0C for 15 min reduced the stimulatory activity to almost background levels, suggesting that the heat-sensitive factor(s) were responsible for the infection-stimulating effects (Supplementary Fig. S3b). Taken together, the data suggest that adenovirus-inoculated macrophages condition the medium with heat sensitive agents, which act on the epithelial cells from the apical side and enhance apical adenovirus infection.",

To identify cytokines in the infection stimulating CM, we performed a BioPlex assay including 12 different cytokines with known effects on epithelial layers. At 4 h after inoculation of macrophages with adenovirus, we detected IL-6, CXCL8, IL-10 and TNF-\u03b1 in the supernatant, and at 8 h, interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 was also detected, but IL-10 was no longer detected (Supplementary Table S1). We did not detect IL-1\u03b2, IL-4, IL-12/p70, IL-13, IL-15, IL-17 or IFN-\u03b12, suggesting that these cytokines have no decisive role in stimulation of epithelial infection. The treatment of polarized 16HBE14o cells with recombinant human CXCL8 (CXCL8), however, boosted apical infection in a dose-dependent manner, although not to the full extent as CM. Recombinant human IFN-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) had no infection-supporting impact (Fig. 3a), although it increased the expression of HLA-1 (MHC-I) epitopes on A549 cells (data not shown). The depletion of CXCL8 from CM with a neutralizing antibody, however, significantly reduced the stimulation of apical infection, whereas depletion of IL-10 did not (Fig. 3b). These data suggest an important role of CXCL8 in stimulating apical adenovirus infection, although it did not account for the full stimulation by CM. This conclusion was corroborated by the finding that blocking of the CXCL8 receptors, CXCR1 and CXCR2, with neutralizing antibodies before stimulation with CM reduced CM-mediated infection to a significant extent, yet not completely (Fig. 3c). Neutralization of both receptors together did not have additive effects, suggesting a co-dependency of receptor function by heterodimerization, as earlier reviewed in ref. 20.",

Further analysis by SDS\u2013PAGE and western blotting identified \u03b23 integrin as one of the biotinylated, thus apical proteins. The membrane cofactor CD46, which was reported to localize to the apical membrane compartment23, was also significantly biotinylated from the apical side, similar to \u03b23 integrin (Fig. 4d). We next tested the functional significance of the apical localization of \u03b1\u03bd\u03b23 integrin on CM stimulation. Apical addition of anti-\u03b1\u03bd\u03b23 integrin function blocking antibodies to CM-stimulated 16HBE14o cells strongly reduced Ad5-muIL2 infection, whereas anti-\u03b1\u03bd\u03b25 integrin antibodies had no significant effects (Fig. 4e).",

It is of note that the chemokine CXCL8 not only acts as an important chemo-attractant to neutrophils and initiates directed cell migration, it has also been implicated in inducing wound healing and migration of epithelial and endothelial cells25. CXCL8 leads to formation of focal complexes by signalling via Src/FAK and paxillin26. We tested whether signalling via Src and paxillin is involved in \u03b1\u03bd\u03b23 integrin relocalization.

In epithelial cells, the genomes of adenoviruses counter the antiviral effects of the cytokines by expressing early region three genes, and thereby downregulate cytokine mRNAs and protein levels35. In macrophages, however, the levels of viral gene expression are low, possibly due to inefficient delivery of viral genomes to the nucleus (reviewed in 28).

CM was more potent than isolated cytokines in stimulating infection of nonpolarized cells, but the specific components of CM responsible for these effects are unknown. In contrast, the CXCL8 ligand\u2013receptor pair is best known for its angiogenic and neutrophil chemotactic properties36. CXCL8-driven chemotaxis can be elicited in many cell types expressing CXCR1/2. It has an important role in fibroblast-mediated wound healing37, the formation of tumour metastases38, and neutrophile chemotaxis37. Chemotaxis forms and dismantles focal complexes and adhesions, and dynamically modulates anchorage of cells to the extracellular matrix. Anchorage involves \u03b1\u03bd\u03b23 integrin, initially in the leading edge of migrating cells39. Intriguingly, CXCL8 enhancement of apical adenovirus infection required the induced localization of \u03b1\u03bd\u03b23 integrin in the apical plasma membrane of the polarized epithelial cells, as indicated by neutralizing antibodies or soluble \u03b1\u03bd\u03b23 integrin competition, which also blocks infection of nonpolarized cells (CJ Burckhardt, M Suomalainen, P Schoenenberger, K.B., S.H. and U.F.G., unpublished results). \u03b1\u03bd\u03b23 integrin has an important role in viral infections, where it serves as an affinity-regulated co-receptor by binding to a 50-amino-acid RGD stretch of the adenoviral capsid protein penton base40,41, and also critically contributes to HIV infection of adherent macrophages42.",

Activated Src undergoes autophosphorylation on tyrosine 416 inducing a complex with focal adhesion kinase, which then phosphorylates paxillin on its critical tyrosine residue 118 (refs 39,46,47,48). The stimulation of polarized epithelial cells with conditioned medium leads to phosphorylation of a Src-family kinase at Y416 and paxillin at Y118, indicating that this pathway is activated. This pathway is crucial for infection, because inhibition of Src family tyrosine kinases with PP1 and PP2 leads to loss of Src and paxillin phosphorylation, failure of \u03b1\u03bd\u03b23 integrin relocalization, and abrogated the infection stimulation. Paxillin may function in \u03b1\u03bd\u03b23 trafficking or as a component of a retention mechanism holding \u03b1\u03bd\u03b23 on the apical membrane on stimulation.

It critically supports infection, as indicated by soluble CAR and viral fibre knob competition experiments. In normal polarized epithelial cells, CAR is restricted to the baso-lateral domain and tight junctions by an intracellular trafficking mechanism involving the clathrin-adaptor AP1B51. Whether CAR is specifically delivered to the apical membrane or released from tight junctions remains to be investigated. In any case, the virus makes CAR available for apical infection. In doing so, it takes advantage of antiviral functions of CAR on epithelial cells, where CAR binds JAML from neutrophils, and thereby supports the infiltration of immune cells at sites of cell injury and infection52. Strikingly, epithelial CAR also enhances wound-healing in mucosal tissue by activating and binding to JAML on gamma-delta T cells53. These cells have important roles in primary defence of epithelial barriers against infection, traumatic insults and malignancies. These cells might have pivotal roles in the defence against adenoviral infection, and if impaired contribute to the severe pathological conditions in immunocompromised individuals.",
