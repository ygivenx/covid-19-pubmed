The mechanism of RPA is similar to that of PCR.

After adaptor ligation and USER treatment\nof E. coli libraries, 20 min of linear\nRPA was performed with the P7 index primer (Table S3). A short cycle of PCR was performed with the P5 index and\nP7 end primers to attach the P5 index for NGS. We confirmed the size\ndistribution of products by agarose gel electrophoresis prior to performing\nNGS and found broader size distributions (Figure S4) than that obtained with two-primer RPA (Figure S2).
