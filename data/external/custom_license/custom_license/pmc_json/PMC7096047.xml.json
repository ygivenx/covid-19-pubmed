Jointly written by a scientist and a journalist, it is directed at the general reader and attempts to strike a middle ground between an account for the lay public and a scientific primer.",

Chapters are devoted to long-recognized infectious diseases such as influenza\u2014where the dangers of antigenic shift carry the potential for a new global pandemic\u2014and to bacterial diseases, where antibiotic resistance constitutes an ever-increasing challenge to effective therapy. The book addresses in some detail problems that have appeared more recently, such as bioterrorism, the mere threat of which has already disrupted many aspects of life in the developed world. Likewise, recently imported diseases such as West Nile fever and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) are presented in historical context.",

Instead, I would read the recent record as evidence that man-made changes in our ecosystem underlie most of the recent threats, such as SARS, monkeypox and West Nile virus.",

That phenomenon is mainly due to transmission of genetic elements\u2014such as plasmids\u2014that carry resistance genes. Among viruses, antigenic shifts in influenza are caused by 'new' reassortant viruses whose genome consists of segments derived from both human and avian or porcine viruses.",

Both the transmission of zoonotic infections into humans and their spread are closely associated with human behavior and technological 'advances', which frequently perturb the complex ecosystems in which we live.",

Unfortunately, it lacks the graceful sophistication of the best medical journalism, such as articles published in the New Yorker magazine; neither does it possess the authority of scientific accounts by researchers who contribute to the primary literature. In summary, this layman's introduction to emerging infectious diseases, although informative, is unlikely to be remembered as an outstanding exposition of this important topic.",
