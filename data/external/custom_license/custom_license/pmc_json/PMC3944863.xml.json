Analyses showed that each of the 8 gene segments of the virus we isolated were closely related to pH1N1 viruses circulating among humans, including a human representative strain (A/California/04/2009) and a contemporary strain (A/Sichuan/1/2009); these viruses showed 98.6%\u2013100% nt identity to the panda strain (Technical Appendix Table 1). Phylogenetic analysis of the 8 gene segments of the virus we isolated showed that the isolate was related to the pH1N1 virus clade of influenza viruses (Figure 2; Technical Appendix Figure). The results of the BLAST and phylogenetic analyses suggest that a human pH1N1 virus was transmitted directly to giant pandas without recombination or significant adaptation.

We documented infection with this virus in giant pandas in China during 2009. Sequence analysis of a virus isolated from a nasal swab sample revealed that it was nearly identical to the pH1N1 virus circulating in humans, which suggests that the virus may have been transmitted to the pandas directly from humans. Furthermore, serologic analysis of samples from the affected pandas was consistent with productive infection by pH1N1 virus. Seroconversion was documented in each animal, although 1 animal appeared to have been previously exposed to pH1N1 or a related virus that was able to elicit cross-reactive antibodies. Similarly, some pandas had detectable HI antibodies against H3 and H6 subtype influenza viruses, raising the possibility that giant pandas may be infected with human- and avian-origin influenza viruses.",
