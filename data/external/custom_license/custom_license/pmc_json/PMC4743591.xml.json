Old world pathogens such as Dengue and Chikungunya virus, previously restricted to the Middle East, Africa and Asia have now appeared in the Americas [1]. Newer pathogens such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), an entirely new coronavirus affecting humans, have been spreading beyond the region of the world from which they derive their names [2]. Meanwhile, human populations in developing areas of the world continue to be threatened by neglected tropical diseases (NTD). More than two billion people \u2013 nearly 30% of the world\u2019s population \u2013 suffer from one or more NTD [3], which include leishmaniasis, lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis, among others (Table 1). In addition to climate change and airline travel, economic conditions leading to transmigration contribute to the spread of NTD. Recent examples include the reemergence of Leishmania in Spain [4] and Chagas disease in Texas [5].",

In contrast, vaccines for important emerging infectious diseases (EID, Table 2) are being developed, to a certain extent, by large biotechnology companies, particularly when these companies receive guaranteed purchase agreements or other incentives to accelerate vaccine development. Examples include the development of a vaccine for H7N9 (an emerging avian influenza) by Novartis and Novavax in 2013 [6,7] and work toward the development of a new MERS-CoV vaccine in 2014 [8]. However, the standard approach to develop new vaccines for emerging (and reemerging) infectious disease threats, which is to implement previously existing vaccine design methodologies such as cloning and expressing the dominant surface antigen [9], frequently results in the development of vaccines that are only effective when given with strong adjuvants [10]. This approach is particularly unlikely to work for pathogens that have complex lifecycles (such as parasites) or are highly mutable (such as RNA viruses). This article will discuss new, computational approaches that may accelerate and improve the design of vaccines for NTD and EID.",

Although vaccines are in development for several NTD pathogens [11], lack of financial incentive to invest in research and development programs for diseases concentrated in low-income countries has mired the progress of vaccine efforts among large pharmaceutical companies [3]. Preventative chemotherapy mass drug administration (MDA) programs employing donated or extremely low-cost generic drugs are currently in progress to control lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, leprosy, trachoma and helminthiases in many areas of the world [12]. A complication inherent in this strategy is that because the regions affected by different NTD overlap, coinfections can be difficult to manage with antiparasitic agents [13]. The success of these long-term efforts and off-target effects of mass-eradication campaigns at the individual and population levels remain to be determined [14]. As has been observed for polio, geopolitical upheaval may hamper global efforts to eradicate NTD. Thus, effective NTD vaccines are still needed [15]. New cost\u2013effective design methodologies can help to bridge the gap between the great need for these vaccines and return on investment for pharmaceutical companies.",

Others may be proteins that serve as \u2018housekeeping\u2019 genes that are also well conserved in harmless commensal organisms. On the other hand, proteins that are highly conserved across variant strains, that are pathogen-specific and those that are upregulated during interactions with the host, particularly those that are secreted by a pathogen (presumably in an attempt to alter the host environment), are excellent targets for vaccine development.",

The Expert Protein Analysis System (ExPASy) proteomics server of the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics offers a wide variety of proteomics tools that can be used for this purpose, including tools related to protein identification and characterization. Our groups have adapted an approach first described by Gennaro et al. for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) [49], employing a series of ExPASy tools (SignalP, TMPred and Prosite Scan [50]) to triage pathogen genomes, reducing the number of potential targets from thousands of proteins to several dozen candidate antigens. In our first test of this approach, we found that a subset of epitopes derived from the Mtb genome elicited IFN-\u03b3 response from Mtb-exposed human samples, and prototype epitope-based TB vaccines were shown to be robustly immunogenic in murine studies [51].",

In this context, an immunogenicity score of zero reflects random or \u2018average\u2019 putative epitope content; positive scores reflect more epitope content than expected, while negative scores reflect less epitope content than expected [52]. Large numbers of protein sequences derived directly from the genome of selected pathogens can be ordered by potential class I (CTL), class II (T helper) or both class I and class II epitope content and placed on an immunogenicity scale (Figure 1). This tool allows researchers to quickly rank a given set of proteins both in relative (i.e., relative to each other) and absolute (i.e., relative to a panel of known immunogens and nonimmunogenic proteins) terms [53]. In our experience, epitope-rich proteins are good vaccine targets and elicit strong antibody responses \u2013 thus, as previously stated, T-cell epitope content is a useful proxy for overall immunogenic potential.",

For example, in Figure 1, we show two candidate antigens derived from B. malayi, a causative agent of lymphatic filariasis, whose life cycle is divided into multiple larval stages including a microfilarial stage [54]. In this case, TPX-2, a protein that has been identified as a potential vaccine target [55], is shown to contain minimal T-cell epitope content, with an immunogenicity score of \u201327.61, and thus it may be less successful as a vaccine candidate. In contrast, Juv-p120, a B. malayi ortholog of a Litomosoides sigmodontis antigen implicated in conferring protection against microfilarial infection [56] carries substantially more T-cell epitope content, scoring +94.14 on the immunogenicity scale, in the same range as other well-known immunogens. Furthermore, as is illustrated here in the case of B. malayi, we frequently find evidence that pathogens appear to reduce T-cell epitope content in key proteins to avoid human immune responses. Epitope deletion is an established means of immune evasion in HIV and HCV [57,58]; thus, the mechanism may also be relevant in the context of infections that are associated with chronic infection caused by filaria, leishmania and other chronic NTD, particularly in stages associated with chronic parasitism and parasite persistence in the face of immune pressure.

The EpiMatrix algorithm compares the amino acid sequence of each given 9-mer peptide to the coefficients contained in stored probability matrices and produces a raw score.

Using a recently developed tool called JanusMatrix we first determined that published effector T-cell epitopes can be distinguished from reported regulatory T-cell epitopes on the basis of TCR-specific cross-reactive potential with the human genome and human microbiome [67]. JanusMatrix differs from whole-sequence alignment tools such as BLAST [68] in its basis upon T-cell receptor homology. Pathogenic peptides whose TCR-facing residues are identical to the epitopes contained in multiple self may be recognized by T cells specific to those human proteins. Of course, even though the MHC-facing residues may differ, these peptides must still have the capacity to bind to the same MHC as the pathogen sequence, provided that binding is preserved. Taking this into account, JanusMatrix compares the TCR-facing contour of pathogen ligands to other genomes of interest, identifying matches therein that are predicted to bind the same MHC. TCR-homologous epitopes shared between pathogens and humans, or pathogens and other microbes, can be uncovered with remarkable speed using the JanusMatrix tool.",

We have repurposed Cytoscape to describe the relationship between epitopes across proteins in groups of sequences (the human genome, the human microbiome, pathogen genomes [67]). Using Cytoscape [74], the results of JanusMatrix analysis (e.g., comparing a pathogen epitope to the human genome) can be visualized as networks where each epitope derived from a pathogen is linked to its TCR-matched counterparts in the search database, which themselves are linked to their source proteins. For example, an influenza T-cell epitope previously identified by Mark Davis and colleagues [70] that stimulates T cells in subjects never exposed to influenza can be shown to have an extensive network of cross-reactive TCR-facing epitopes in the human microbiome. In contrast, an epitope from vaccinia virus synthesized and tested by Larry Stern\u2019s group is shown to have extensive cross-reactivity with the human genome by JanusMatrix. This epitope was nonimmunogenic in vitro (by IFN-\u03b3 ELISpot) even though it was shown to bind to the correct class II MHC [75]. This epitope fits the emerging in silico definition of a Treg epitope.",

It has been shown that putative epitopes for HLA class II are not often distributed evenly across protein sequences, but instead tend to cluster in specific regions, where it is not uncommon to observe several reactive 9-mer frames in close proximity [76]. These \u2018clusters\u2019 of unusually high predicted epitope density can be identified in silico using the ClustiMer algorithm. In general, T-cell epitope clusters identified by the ClustiMer algorithm tend to be promiscuous MHC binders and are frequently T-cell epitopes [52]. Due to overlapping peptide-binding preferences among HLA-DR alleles, it is also possible to identify single 9-mers capable of binding four or more HLA alleles [76]. These sequences have been dubbed \u2018EpiBars\u2019 due to their horizontal, band-like signature in readout from EpiMatrix (Figure 3). T-cell epitope clusters can be very powerful, and EpiBars may be a characteristic feature of highly immunogenic, promiscuous class II epitopes. These compact, highly reactive peptides are relatively easy to deliver and show great promise as vaccine components when cross-reactivity with the human genome is limited (see above). We have used these clusters extensively in our own work [24,43,51].",

An ideal vaccine might include whole proteins in addition to some epitopes; some or all of these antigens could be optimized using the ICS approach.

To describe this relationship, EpiVax researchers have developed a metric that may be useful in clinical assessment of immune response to vaccines, called the \u2018individualized T-cell epitope measure\u2019 or iTEM. For a given T-cell epitope, an individual\u2019s iTEM score can be calculated by weighting and summing the epitope\u2019s EpiMatrix Z-scores for each HLA allele in a given subject\u2019s haplotype. This calculated score allows for individualized immunogenic potential to be predicted based on the number of putative epitopes contained in a protein and a given individual\u2019s HLA haplotype. Using this score, it is possible to analyze the contribution of haplotype to the corresponding T-cell response. In prospective and retrospective evaluations, significant correlations were found between the IFN-\u03b3 response to a given antigen and the iTEM scores for individual subjects [42]. In addition, correlations between the iTEM score and patient HLA have been observed for antibody titers [40,81,82], reflecting the importance of HLA-restricted T-cell responses to the genesis of a robust antidrug antibody response.",

However, the lack of spacers between the payload epitopes has raised concern that these sequences may contain junctional epitopes. VaccineCAD, an algorithm that iteratively analyzes epitope assemblies and minimizes the potential for junctional immunogenicity in any string-of-beads construct, has been developed to address this concern [40]. Peptide sequences contained in the junctional regions between the target epitopes are evaluated for potential immunogenicity. The highest scoring junction is identified and the algorithm optimizes the order of epitopes by evaluating potential alternative sequences. The process is repeated until no additional reductions in junctional immunogenicity can be achieved or until all junctional immunogenic potential has been eliminated. When the potential for junctional immunogenicity cannot be sufficiently reduced, a cleavage promoting spacer sequence, typically \u2018AAY\u2019 for class I restricted constructs [86] or a binding inhibiting \u2018breaker\u2019 sequence such as \u2018GPGPG\u2019 for class II restricted constructs [87] is placed between the two offending epitopes.

Compared to conventional strategies, this approach has the potential to create more effective and safer next-generation vaccines, as carefully selected epitopes focus immune responses on the minimal, essential pathogen-specific antigenic elements; epitopes directed against conserved \u2018self\u2019 (host) antigens are eliminated. This approach is also well suited for highly variable pathogens, as selection of epitopes that are conserved across multiple strains or subtypes enables the development of a broadly applicable, multipathogen vaccine. The genome-derived vaccine strategy has been applied by our team to a wide range of pathogens, including F. tularensis, variola, HIV, Mtb, H. pylori and influenza. These studies demonstrate that immunoinformatic-predicted epitopes are immunoreactive in vaccinees and survivors of infection, and stimulate de novo, protective immune responses in vivo in HLA transgenic mice (e.g., [24\u201326,51]).",

For EID, \u2018tried and true\u2019 approaches often win out over newer approaches, even though traditional approaches have no greater likelihood of success. The MERS-CoV vaccine development programs that have been implemented illustrate this principle; despite the fact that the virus belongs to a family of coronaviruses that have a history of rapid evolution, vaccination approaches are once again targeting the \u2018spike\u2019 protein. A similar approach was used during the emergence of SARS and completely failed to protect against rapidly evolving SARS viruses in animal challenge models [9,90]. Application of advanced immunoinformatics tools to NTD vaccines has also lagged for a number of reasons. NTD researchers do not use the tools because they lack access to and familiarity with them, and there are no widely publicized examples focusing on diseases that impact the developing world.",

Computational vaccinology cannot currently address all of these challenges; however, the approach described here offers a unique opportunity to address certain hurdles early in the developmental process. Early in the pipeline, antigen discovery using T-cell epitope prediction and ranking, along with candidate epitope triage using cluster analysis and cross-reactivity prediction provide valuable leads. Selected peptide candidates can be screened ex vivo in order to verify the phenotype of the immune response prior to inclusion in a final vaccine product.",

This flexibility extends to the antigen discovery approach as well, in that many kinds of targets may be explored using immunoinformatics tools. A pertinent example for NTD and EID applies to vector-based targets. Vaccine components based upon the salivary proteins of arthropod vectors are already under investigation [92]. However, vector salivary antigens also have known immunomodulatory properties allowing for extended host tolerance [93,94]. The same discovery and evaluation strategy described for pathogenic antigens could be applied to such proteins, potentially providing a mechanism through which to stimulate robust immune response in the absence of the immunomodulatory properties of the complete salivary antigens.",

By applying these technologies to the study of EID and NTD causative agents, and expanding our genomic knowledge of these organisms, the feasibility of using high-throughput, informatics-based tools for the identification of putative protein and peptide targets increases. Vaccine efficacy may also improve, as the selection of targets can be refined by comparing the antigen to other genome sequences, such as the human genome and the human microbiome. The in silico-based approach to vaccine design may also alleviate many of the funding-associated challenges common to traditional vaccine design, by reducing the number of assays that need to be performed to select vaccine targets. Reduced cost should allow for the reallocation of critical funding to the testing of in silico-predicted targets and constructs. And finally, improved safety, by eliminating human genome cross-conserved epitopes, may reduce unwanted adverse effects. Looking further into the future, we are confident that the evolution of the tools described here will eventually contribute to the development of personalized, on-demand vaccines [95].",

All other factors being equal, the more HLA ligands (i.e., putative T-cell epitopes) contained in a given protein, the more likely that protein is to induce an immune response. To capture this concept, the EpiMatrix immunogenicity scale presents proteins by the EpiMatrix protein score, and compares them to other known immunogens. The EpiMatrix protein score is the difference between the number of predicted T-cell epitopes expected in a protein of a given size and the number of putative epitopes predicted by the EpiMatrix. The EpiMatrix protein scores are \u2018normalized\u2019 and can be plotted on a standardized scale. \u2018Average\u2019 proteins score near zero. Protein scores above zero indicate the presence of excess MHC ligands and denote a higher potential for immunogenicity, while scores below zero indicate the presence of fewer potential MHC ligands than expected and a lower potential for immunogenicity. The EpiMatrix protein score is correlated with observed immunogenicity in vitro and in vivo. As shown here, proteins scoring above +20, such as Brugia malayi antigen Juv-p120, are considered to have a significant immunogenic potential.
