Influenza B viruses are not subtyped. Historically, only three HA subtypes, H1, H2 and H3, have been responsible for pandemic outbreaks. This includes the 2009 outbreak caused by a novel influenza A (H1N1) virus of swine origin [2]. In contrast, all virus subtypes and combinatorial possibilities of HA and NA have been detected in wild birds and poultry [3]. Since 1997, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses, in particular the H5N1 subtype, have jumped the species barrier and caused ongoing sporadic fatal outbreaks in humans [4]. Therefore, the looming threat of pandemics from influenza viruses cannot be overlooked, and assays that enable rapid, accurate identification and subtyping of influenza viruses is pertinent for surveillance and outbreak management.",

Gene sequences from human, avian, pandemic influenza A and influenza B viruses were downloaded from GenBank\u2019s Influenza Virus Resource (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/FLU/FLU.html) as well as from Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) (http://platform.gisaid.org/). The sequences were aligned using the BioEdit sequence alignment editor version 7.0.5.3, and highly conserved regions resulting from the alignment were used for probe and primer design. As shown in Table 1, HA-specific primers were designed for pandemic and seasonal H1N1, H3N2, H5N1 and influenza B viruses. Additional primers and probes were designed against the NA segments of pandemic H1N1 and H5N1 to facilitate subtyping. Reverse primers were synthesized with the addition of a 5\u2032-terminal Cy5 label (Sigma Proligo, Singapore). The capture probes were designed using the variable regions of the genes (Table 1). The assay comprised 14 influenza-virus-specific PCR primers and a set of forward and reverse PSII primers for the amplification of a PCR-positive control of plant origin (Table 1). Together, these primers constituted the VereFlu\u2122 primer mix A. There were 23 influenza targeted capture probes, 2 RT-PCR control probes, and positive and negative hybridization control probes (Table 1).\n",

Each TCS or thermal reactor accommodates a maximum of five chips, which can be run either simultaneously or independently using different protocols. The modular nature of the system allows the linkup of more than one TCS unit to the computer, hence enabling the system to be adapted to the throughput needs of either large- or small-scale diagnostic settings.

Multiplexing capabilities of real-time PCR reactions are typically limited to a fourplex as restricted by the number of fluorescence acquisition channels present in the PCR instrument. In contrast, the detection format in the VereFlu\u2122 assay is low-density-array-based, allowing tens to hundreds of capture probes to be spotted and correspondingly allowing a similar number of amplicons to be detected.

In our assay, capture probe cross-reactions were observed for the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) probe with human coronavirus OC43 and the influenza B capture probe with human adenovirus type 7. During the testing of clinical samples, false positives of this nature will be unlikely, as hybridization to only one capture probe (instead of both probes for influenza B virus or all three probes for 2009 pandemic H1N1) is insufficient to permit the VereFlu\u2122 software to call a positive result.
