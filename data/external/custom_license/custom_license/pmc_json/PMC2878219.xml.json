Controls were randomly selected from a list of names generated by a census of all households in the affected community and matched to a case-patient (6:1) by sex and age (\u00b1 2 years; all case-patients and controls were >4 years of age). They were given a 2-part questionnaire in Bengali. The first part focused on environmental exposures and established whether the participant had had contact with a specific probable or confirmed case-patient(s). The second part focused on types of contact with specific case-patients to elucidate possible modes of transmission from person to person.

These included surfaces within hospitals where Nipah virus patients received care, surfaces within homes of confirmed case-patients, trees where bats foraged, date palm sap collection pots, and fruits that may have been in contact with fruit bats. Surfaces were rolled with sterile, cotton-tipped applicators, which were stored in 500 \u03bcL Dulbecco modified Eagle medium supplemented with an antibiotic-antimycotic solution. Viral RNA was extracted from 140 \u03bcL of the resulting suspension by using a Viral RNA Minikit (QIAGEN, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) and eluted in a volume of 50 \u03bcL. Nipah virus RNA was detected by using the LightCycler RNA Amplification Kit SYBR Green I (Roche, Laval, Quebec, Canada) with primers for the nucleoprotein gene (NPF: 5\u2032-ATCAATCGTGGTTATCTTGAAC-3\u2032 and NPR: 5\u2032CCTCTTCGTCGACATCTTGATC-3\u2032) and with thermocycling and real-time detection performed on a SmartCycler II reaction block (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).

Our findings are also limited by recall bias.

When possible, medical records were used to supplement patient reports of illness history, but often these records were incomplete or nonexistent. However, the investigation began just days after onset of illness in most patients, which provided for optimal recall of events.
