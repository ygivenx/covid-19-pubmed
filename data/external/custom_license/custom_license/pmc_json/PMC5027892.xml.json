MoM bearings generate less volumetric wear which may translate into longer implant survival.6 In addition, MoM bearings facilitate greater hip stability and range of movement from larger head sizes. Furthermore, MoM bearings allow for bone-conserving hip resurfacing (HR) which is important for younger patients who will eventually require revision surgery.7 Both MoP and MoM bearings have been associated with elevated systemic levels of metal ions and ARMDs, however, ion levels have been shown to be consistently higher in patients with MoM bearings, and ARMDs appear to be more common in these patients.8-11",

Surveillance with metal ions has been recommended for patients with the ASR implant (Depuy Synthes, Warsaw, Indiana) in the United Kingdom, with large-diameter THA and small-diameter hip resurfacing (HR) in Australia, and with large-diameter THA and any HR in Europe. The recommended work-up of symptomatic patients by each of these organisations includes blood metal ion assessment. To date, the most detailed guidelines were put forth by the United Kingdom\u2019s Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency which advised that a blood metal ion level > 7 \u00b5g/L indicates potential for soft-tissue reaction. As noted by others, ion level cut-offs are arbitrary and not supported by scientific data.5,24-26",

We supplemented the electronic search by obtaining referenced articles and articles citing articles were each of the articles ultimately included in the meta-analysis through Scopus. Two readers (a fellowship-trained joint reconstruction surgeon and orthopaedic surgery resident) independently reviewed all articles using explicit criteria, and recorded assessments using a standard computerised form. A third reader (a fellowship-trained joint reconstruction surgeon) resolved any disagreements. Readers screened titles and abstracts to exclude animal and basic science studies, review articles, guidelines, and editorials.

Consequently we felt that there was a high risk of bias from the spectrum effect as ion levels were likely used in the decision-making process.27 Eligible measures of diagnostic performance included: sensitivity; specificity; predictive values; likelihood ratios; diagnostic odds ratios; and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. If an odds ratio for an ion cut-point used as a covariate in logistic regression was reported, we deemed the study eligible. Reviewers collected the following covariates: country of study; inclusion criteria; benchmark test; index test; number of patients; ARMD prevalence; number of revisions; and prevalence of symptomatic patients.

This suggests that the discriminative capacity of the ion test is homogeneous across studies but that there is substantial cut-point heterogeneity. The cut-point heterogeneity may be due to heterogeneity in the benchmark modality used: the studies reporting unexpectedly high specificity and low sensitivity at 5 \u00b5g/L and 7 \u00b5g/L cut-points did not exclusively use MARS MRI as the benchmark (Fig. 2c). Sample size, ARMD prevalence, prevalence of symptomatic patients, and ion test characteristics were not associated with cut-point heterogeneity (Figs 2d, 2e, 2f and 2g). Given the homogeneity in discrimination capacity but implicit cut-point heterogeneity we pursued SROC meta-analysis without meta-analysing cut-points (see Appendix 2).",

Accounting for this random variability, we have 95% confidence that the study-specific \u201ctruth\u201d will lie within the 95% prediction region. The prediction and credible regions have similar widths, which further supported minimal heterogeneity. The area under the curve (AUC) for the SROC curve was 0.615 (95% CI 0.480 to 0.735), thus we can state that the probability that metal ion testing is actually clinically useful with AUC \u2265 0.75 is 1.7% (see Appendix 2).41",

Since screen-positive patients will undergo further testing, screening tests need not be as accurate as diagnostic tests. Screening can use two different approaches: exclude patients with very low probability of disease from further testing by maximising the negative predictive value (NPV), or identify high-risk patients for further testing by maximising the positive predictive value (PPV).46 The performance of ion testing using these two approaches is shown in Table II. Calculations were made using the SROC curve plotted in Figure 3 and using the mean prevalence of ARMDs in the studies included in this review (41%). Indeed, maximising NPV is burdensome because 99% of patients will test positive. Furthermore, test-positive patients have the same probability of disease as they did prior to undergoing the test. On the other hand, maximising PPV does not reassure test negative patients because they still have a 21% probability of having an ARMD. Test-positive patients are hardly \u201chigh risk\u201d because the risk of an ARMD is marginally different from the pre-test probability (52% versus 41%). Aside from statistical concerns, screening for ARMDs is problematic on theoretical grounds. The World Health Organization recommends that screening only be performed if patients will be offered treatment.47 We are unaware of any evidence supporting revision on asymptomatic patients with ARMDs and thus screening would serve no clinical purpose.",

The methodological heterogeneity only manifested in heterogeneity in the cut-point effect, and not in the accuracy effect. Due to heterogeneity, our meta-analysis cannot be used to determine a useful cut-point. However, this is a moot point because the accuracy of the test is so poor. It was remarkable that these methodologically heterogeneous studies formed a smooth ROC curve (Fig. 2). Therefore, there was substantial homogeneity among these studies in the accuracy effect. This homogeneity is further reflected in the fact that the prediction intervals and confidence intervals were nearly equivalent in width (Fig. 3). In other words, our results are tantamount to those from a single study with 898 hips and 376 ARMDs.",
