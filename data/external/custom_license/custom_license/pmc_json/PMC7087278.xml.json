FCoV is classified into two biotypes based on differences in pathogenicity: feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV). FECV infection is asymptomatic in cats. In contrast, FIPV infection causes a fatal disease, feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). The difference in pathogenicity between FECV and FIPV in cats is considered to be associated with macrophage tropism of the viruses [27, 29]. It has been proposed that FIPV arises from FECV by mutation [11, 26, 37], but the exact mutation and inducing factors have not yet been clarified.",

This phenomenon is known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of FIPV infection. A similar phenomenon has been observed with other virus infections, such as dengue and human immunodeficiency virus infections [10, 33, 35]. ADE of FIPV infection has been reported to be induced by antibodies against FIPV spike (S) protein [5, 12, 23]. In ADE-induced macrophages (ADE macrophages), TNF-alpha production increases with viral replication, and this TNF-alpha acts on macrophages and promotes virus receptor (feline aminopeptidase N; fAPN) expression [31].",

For example, antibodies produced due to FIPV infection bind to the virus and form immune-complexes [1, 24]. These complexes are deposited in micro blood vessels. Complement binding to the deposit injures the vascular tissue and causes vasculitis (immune-complex-mediated vasculitis). Hyperproteinemia also develops with an increase of gamma-globulin in FIP cats [1]. Moreover, increased levels of interleukin (IL)-6, a cytokine involved in the survival of B-cells and their differentiation into plasma cells, in ascites and culture supernatant of peritoneal exudative cells (PEC) from FIP cats have been reported [8].",

For B-cells to differentiate into plasma cells, various factors (cytokines, antigens, etc.) are necessary. We focused on IL-6, CD40L, and BAFF as B-cell differentiation/survival factors. IL-6 is involved in the differentiation of B-cells into plasma cells, and signal transmission via the IL-6 receptor inhibits B-cell apoptosis [7, 18, 36]. CD40L inhibits the induction of B-cell apoptosis by binding to CD40 expressed on the B-cell surface, activating B-cells [3, 16, 17, 20]. BAFF induces an apoptosis-inhibitory gene, Bcl-2, by binding to the BAFF receptor expressed on B-cells, inhibiting B-cell apoptosis [6, 22]. We clarified that IL-6, CD40L, and BAFF mRNA expression was increased in macrophages in FIP cats. The IL-6, CD40L, and BAFF mRNA expression levels were also increased with virus replication in macrophages inoculated with FIPV, suggesting that FIPV replication induced BAFF, IL-6, and CD40L production in macrophages of FIP cats, and these factors promoted B-cell differentiation into plasma cells.",

We reported previously that when the FIPV antigen was detected by the fluorescent antibody method, 10\u201320% of cells were positive when SPF cat-derived alveolar macrophages were inoculated with FIPV + anti-FIPV S MAb, whereas 1\u20132% of cells were positive when alveolar macrophages were inoculated with FIPV [12, 15]. It seems that the increased number of virus-infected macrophages leads to the over-expression of B-cell differentiation/survival factor mRNA in macrophages. However, there is no evidence that this hypothesis is correct. A continued examination of the mechanism of ADE activity in FIPV infection would strengthen this hypothesis.",

The increased IL-6, CD40L, and BAFF mRNA expression levels in ADE macrophages may also be closely involved in aggravation of pathogenesis, as well as TNF-alpha. That is, our data suggest that FIPV re-infection induces ADE and advances FIP development in cats. However, Addie et al. [2]reported that FCoV re-infection of anti-FCoV antibody-positive domestic cats might not result in the development of ADE. Although the details are unclear, differences in the immunological condition of FCoV-infected cats may be the reason why the phenomenon noted in ADE does not occur in domestic cats. It is necessary to analyze mechanism of ADE in detail.",

Similarly, increased levels of immune-complexes in the blood of mice induced to overexpress BAFF have been reported [21]. Therefore, it is easily predicted that IL-6, CD40L, and BAFF are involved in the development of immune-complex-mediated vasculitis. IL-6 has also been reported to induce Blimp-1 expression in B-cells, mainly by activating STAT3 [19], suggesting that IL-6 is involved in the enhanced Blimp-1 mRNA expression in PBMCs in FIP cats.",
