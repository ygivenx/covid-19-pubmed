Outbreaks occur frequently in hospitals and healthcare centers and pose a serious risk of colonization or illness to susceptible patients and healthcare staff. It was stated in a recent report that only six (three high-income and three low-income) countries are equipped to deal with a pandemic [1]. Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae outbreaks occur in hospitals when the healthcare environment is compromised [2]. Outbreak control must be well planned, fast, and effective. The primary components of a management plan are risk assessment, case findings, patient evaluation and risk mitigation. The Rapid Isolation and Treatment of Infection strategy (RITE strategy) was recommended for the Ebola outbreak in Africa [3]. Infection control personnel expend considerable effort investigating outbreaks, leading to unexpectedly high costs for the affected hospital. Approximately 2\u201310% of all nosocomial infections are acquired during a nosocomial outbreak [4]. This review describes the major and minor components, and special measures for outbreak control in low- and middle-income countries.",

Elsewhere, a significant reduction in Gram-negative bacteria count was observed when hand hygiene measures were performed using soap and water in conjunction with an alcohol hand-rub soap [7]. It was shown that an alcohol-based hand-rub reduced the Acinetobacter baumannii count by 98% on experimentally contaminated hands. Hand contamination, despite wearing gloves, was reported on the hands of 5% and 1% of HCWs after caring for MDR A. baumannii and MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonized or infected patients, respectively [8].",

The annual net cost to India and China from not performing handwashing was estimated to be US$ 23 billion and US$ 12 billion, respectively. The expected net return, following the introduction of nation-wide programs to effect a change in handwashing behavior, was estimated to be US$ 5.6 billion for India (at US$ 23/disability-adjusted life-year that was avoided, representing a 92-fold return on the investment), and US$ 2.64 billion for China (at US$ 22/disability-adjusted life-year that was avoided, a 35-fold return on the investment) [9]. Hand hygiene is probably the most effective measure that can be used to control an outbreak, while being cost-effective. The introduction of an alcohol-based hand-rub was also demonstrated to lead to increased hand hygiene compliance among healthcare workers and fewer hospital-related infections in another study [6]. However, maintaining good hand hygiene practices in hospitals remains a challenge [10].",

Personal protective equipment is a critical measure to protect healthcare workers, military and voluntary personnel assisting people from highly infectious diseases [14]. This is to ensure a reduction in the risk of transmission of blood-borne and other microorganisms from both recognized and unrecognized sources. In addition to standard precautions being taken, contact precautions should include wearing a gown and gloves upon entering the room of a patient who is colonized or infected with epidemiologically targeted bacteria, as well as using disposable, single-use or patient-dedicated, non-critical care equipment (such as blood pressure cuffs and stethoscopes). Once MDR bacterial infection or carriage is detected in hospitalized patients, most international guidelines recommend the application of contact precautions to these patients to prevent the spread of infection, even if the quality of evidence is low [15]. There are multiple ways of implementing contact precautions:Special isolation wards can be allocated to infected patients, or a particular group of patients (for example, patients in whom infection has definitively been identified) can share an area.Colonized patients could be isolated in single or cohort nursing rooms on the general wards, with the need for designated personnel.Contact precautions should be applied when caring for colonized or infected patients.",

In addition, antibiotics have long been established as a crucial risk factor for Clostridium difficile infection. In patients colonized by C. difficile, antibiotics may promote C. difficile proliferation and the number of C. difficile spores that are shed in the local environment. Antibiotic use in C. difficile-infected patients can have a potentially negative effect on any other patient in the same environment who is not receiving them. In turn, this may result in a higher environmental C. difficile burden and greater risk for acquisition and infection in future patients who share the same environment as those infected with C. difficile [18].",

Social media and Internet-based data have also been shown to play a role in the ability to send early warning signals to public health authorities, enabling them to take an informed course of action to prevent and control the spread of disease [27]. The use of social media has also been pivotal in improving real-time reporting, utilized to inform the public and governments about possible health-related threats. It has been reported that, on average, there is a lag time of at least 2 weeks from receipt of information about an infectious disease event to the dissemination of the data via traditional surveillance systems. The distribution of data by means of the Internet and social media ensures acceleration of the process of informing the public and governments about threats to public health, especially infectious diseases. Technology, especially in the light of ongoing advancements, can be used as a platform to improve the quality of detection and reporting of infectious diseases threats, through exploitation of the sensitivity and timeliness capabilities of digital-based surveillance systems [28]. A mathematical model has recently been developed for use in predicting new infectious disease outbreaks in low- and middle-income countries [29].",
