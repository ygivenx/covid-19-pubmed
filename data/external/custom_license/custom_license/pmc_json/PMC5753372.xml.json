Since the beginning the foundation of these systems has been molecular sequence data, such as the nucleic acid sequence data in GenBank\u00ae (1), which NCBI continues to maintain and which continues to receive data through the international collaboration with the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) and the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) as well as from the scientific community. Over the years the amount and variety of data that NCBI maintains has expanded enormously, and can be generally divided into six categories: Literature, Health, Genomes, Genes, Proteins, and Chemicals (Table 1). Each of these six categories has a corresponding web page that lists the relevant databases and tools, along with links to tutorials and other information. Links to these pages are also provided in Table 1. NCBI also provides a variety of services to support the research enterprise: (i) facilities that allow submission of scientific data and open-access publications, (ii) facilities for downloading large and/or customized datasets, (iii) educational events and materials about NCBI products, (iv) software and services to support an expanding developer community, (v) software tools to analyze and/or display NCBI data, and 6) direct involvement in research in computational biology. These services, along with all other data resources, are available through the NCBI home page at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. In most cases, the data underlying these resources and executables for the software described are available for download at ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.",

Links to the web portal for each of these databases are provided on the Entrez GQuery page (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gquery/). Entrez supports text searching using simple Boolean queries, downloading of data in various formats, and linking records between databases based on asserted relationships. In their simplest form, these links may be cross-references between a sequence and the abstract of the paper in which it is reported, or between a protein sequence and either its coding DNA sequence or its 3D-structure. Computationally derived links between neighboring records, such as those based on computed similarities among PubMed abstracts, allow rapid access to groups of related records. A summary of available links for selected databases is shown in Figure 1. The LinkOut service expands the range of links to include external resources, such as organism-specific genome databases. The records retrieved in Entrez can be displayed in many formats and downloaded singly or in batches. An Application Programming Interface for Entrez functions (the E-utilities) is available, and detailed documentation is provided at eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.",

Once entered, corrections appear on PubMed in 24\u201348 h. As a result, users can now report PubMed citation errors directly to the relevant publisher, who can then make the corrections.

As time progresses, more new sequence records will be assigned only accession.version identifiers (current examples of such sequences are unannotated WGS and TSA contigs). In November 2016, NCBI removed GI numbers from GenBank and FASTA formats obtained from the web, APIs, or FTP (they will remain in XML and ASN.1 formats).

It includes genomic elements that function in gene regulation, chromosome organization, recombination, and DNA replication. Each functional element is represented both as a genomic RefSeq record (in GenBank flat file and ASN.1 formats) and also as a new \u2018biological region\u2019 type of Gene record. These Gene records contain metadata about the element, details about its genome annotation, associated literature, and more. An example functional element is the locus control region for human beta-globin, which has Gene ID 109580095, gene symbol HBB-LCR, and sequence NG_052895. These records are all linked to BioProject PRJNA343958 and can be downloaded from that resource as well as from the RefSeq, Genomes, and Gene FTP sites.

Initial datasets are currently available for human, mouse, and rat. In the future a text summary will accompany each gene's expression profile, and these data will be indexed within the Entrez query system. These expression profiles are computed from RNA-seq alignments generated by NCBI\u2019s eukaryotic genome annotation pipeline. This process selects representative datasets publicly available in SRA based on their breadth of tissue and developmental samples, their read characteristics, and other considerations. After aligning reads from a sample to the genomic sequence, for each gene the read coverage is computed (compared to all annotated exons for that gene), normalized to all reads aligned to the genome, and used to derive reads per kilobase per million reads placed (RPKM) across the gene. Data from biological replicates within the same SRA project are averaged and reported with the standard deviation. Expression levels from different SRA projects are reported independently, given the lack of clear standards for coping with batch effects from heterogeneous sample preparations (6,7).",
