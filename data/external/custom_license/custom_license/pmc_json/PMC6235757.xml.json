Since VLPs cannot replicate in humans or revert to a pathogenic form, they are suitable candidates for vaccine development, especially those against life-threatening viruses such as SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, which cause high morbidity and death. By co-expressing the S, envelope (E), and membrane (M) genes, Wang et al. generated VLPs of MERS-S (2017). However, it is difficult to generate these VLPs in large amounts owing to the lack of an efficient viral core protein. Chimeric VLPs (cVLPs) of SARS-CoV, containing the SARS S protein and the matrix protein of influenza virus using the baculovirus insect cell expression system, completely protected mice from death when administered intramuscularly or intranasally in the absence of an adjuvant (Liu et al.\n2011). The use of influenza M1 as a core protein to generate cVLPs for other viruses is reportedly a promising approach, potentially increasing the yield and activating antigen-specific B cells for differentiation and antibody secretion (Liu et al.\n2011). In the present study, we developed a novel type of cVLPs containing modified MERS-CoV S protein and the avian influenza matrix 1 (M1) protein, using a baculovirus insect cell expression system.",

To construct the St/HAk, the transmembrane and carboxyl termini (TM/CT, aa 1296 to 1353 of MERS-CoV Spike) of MERS S protein were replaced with the corresponding segment (TM/CT) of HA-derived A/Anhui/01/2005 (H5N1). Thus, the recombinant St/HAk gene contained the ectodomain of MERS-CoV Spike and TM/CT of H5N1 HA. pFastBacDual-M1-St/HAk was digested with restriction enzymes KpnI and NheI. Further sequenced to ensure the accuracy of the sequences of M1 and St/HAk. The tandem chimeric S/M1 plasmid pFastBacDual-M1-St/HAk was transformed into competent cells of DH10Bac\u2122 (Invitrogen, California, USA) to generate recombinant bacmids (Bacmid M1-St/HAk), and verified via PCR. Purified recombinant bacmid DNA was transfected into Sf9 cells (ATCC CRL-1711) to generate recombinant baculoviral M1-St/HAk, using a Bac-to-Bac baculoviral expression system (Invitrogen). Harvested Sf9 cells infected with baculovirus M1-St/HAk were lysed with SDS-PAGE buffer. Recombinant proteins were identified via Western blot analysis and indirect immunofluorescence (Lan et al.\n2014; Deng et al.\n2018).\n",

Suspended High Five\u2122 cells were infected by recombinant baculovirus M1-St/HAk at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1, 5, and 10, and harvested at different time points (24, 72, and 96 h). Protein expression was analyzed via SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis to determine the optimal conditions. Recombinant M1-St/HAk protein expression was highest at a MOI of 5 after 72 h. After large-scale amplification, the recombinant proteins yielded bands at approximately ~ 157 kDa, which represents a monomer of the S protein ectodomain, a ~ 110-kDa band, which represents the cleavage of S glycoprotein into an amino-terminal domain (S1), and a 25-kDa band, which represents the M1 protein of H5N1 (Fig. 1B), thereby confirming MERS-CoV S protein and H5N1 M1 protein expression. After purification via ultracentrifugation at 4 \u00baC, 3,000 rpm for 2 h, the cVLPs of MERS-S were negatively stained and observed via transmission electron microscope. Enveloped VLPs displayed a spheroid morphology, with a diameter of 80\u2013100 nm and displayed morphological similarity with CoV virions, with enveloped spikes arranged in a crown shape (Fig. 1C-a). After labelling with murine monoclonal antibodies against S protein of MERS-CoV and gold-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG antibody, S specific proteins shown as black pellets were observed on the cVLPS (Fig. 1C-b). These results indicate that chimeric MERS VLPs are morphologically similar to native MERS-CoV (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/photos.html).",

After the third immunization, the IgG titer was further elevated (more than 105). More importantly, high titers of neutralization antibodies (at a serum dilution of 1:320, > 50% neutralizing activity based on the pseudovirus neutralization assay, indicated as pI50 = 320) were also detected in mice immunized with cVLPs (Fig. 1E).",
