Over the past 3 years, human enterovirus 68 (EV-68) has been highlighted as an increasingly recognized cause of respiratory illnesses in outbreak events and case clusters, with the clinical presentation ranging from mild illness to complications requiring hospitalization and/or death [1, 2]. EV-104, EV-109, and EV-117 were also detected from the patients with acute respiratory tract illnesses [3\u20135]. EV-105, EV-116, and EV-118 were detected in the symptomatic children with fatal acute flaccid paralysis, gastroenteritis, and respiratory tract disease [6, 7]. Here we reported the detection and genomic characteristic of EV-118 in two pediatric cases with pneumonia in China.",

The VP1 nucleotide sequences of CQ5112 and CQ5185 demonstrated similarities of 97.6 and 97.3 % to ISR10 strain from Israel, and 91.1 and 91.5 % to PER161 strain from Peru (GenBank accession number: JX393301), respectively (Table 1). Phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the VP1 gene nucleotide sequences using the maximum-likelihood method, with all members of the HEV-C species available included for analysis. All EV-118, EV-109, EV-105, EV-117, and EV-104 strains formed a separate cluster (Cluster 2.1, Fig. 1). The two strains (CQ5112 and CQ5185) were genetically closer to ISR10 than to PER161. Based on the VP1 amino acid sequence, higher identities were presented between the two strains and ISR10 (98.9 and 99.6 %) than between the two strains and PER161 (95.9 and 97.2 %). Three amino acid differences occurred in the BC loop, at position 90, 92, and 94, while no differences found in the DE loop (Supplemental Fig. 2). BC loop in VP1 region has been shown to be important for the reactivity of type-specific antibodies, and these variations may affect the different antigenic properties in different areas.\n\n",

End-specific nucleotide sequences were determined by using the 5\u2032RACE (Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends, Invitrogen) and 3\u2032RACE (Core Set Ver 2.0, TaKaRa). The primers used were provided in the Supplemental Table 1. The complete genome of EV-118 consists of 7,360 nucleotides, excluding the poly (A) tail. The 5\u2032UTR contains 669 nucleotides, and 3\u2032UTR consists of 73 nucleotides. EV-118 features a single open reading frame from base 670 to 7,287 that encodes the 2,206-amino-acid polyprotein. The base composition of the full genome of EV-118 is 27.9 % A, 24.2 % C, 24.4 % G, and 23.6 % U. Based on the comparison of the full genome, EV-118 shares 64\u201379 % nucleotide sequence identities with other HEV-C coding regions, including EV-109 (79 %), EV-104 (73 %), coxsackievirus A19 (CV-A19) (69 %), CV-A22 (69 %), and CV-A1 (69 %). A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the complete nucleotide sequences with maximum-likelihood method, which illustrated that CQ5185 and PER161 clustered with EV-109, EV-105, EV-104, and EV-117, and were genetically closer to EV-109 and EV-105 (Supplemental Fig. 2). The CQ5185 strain differed from the PER161 strain, being supported by a 100 bootstrap value.",
