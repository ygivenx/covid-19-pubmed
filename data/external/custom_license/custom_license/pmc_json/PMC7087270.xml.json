Therefore, the importance of IB lies in the economic losses, as the infection often causes respiratory disease in broiler chickens, decreasing weight gain, increasing mortality and the rejection of slaughter carcasses, and increasing the susceptibility of the chickens to opportunistic bacterial infections [32]. In laying and breeding hens, the infection has been associated with a decrease in production, a worse internal and external quality of the eggs, and a reduction in the hatchability rate [41].",

The mechanisms that regulate the evolution of IBV include mutation, recombination, and selection in the host [34, 45].

The second PCR consisted of 25 \u00b5L of Go Taq\u00ae Green Master Mix (Promega), 2 \u00b5L of amplified DNA, 50 \u00b5M of each CK2 and CK4 oligonucleotide [24], and nuclease-free water (Promega) in a final volume of 50 \u00b5L. The amplification was carried out for one cycle at 94 \u00b0C for one minute, followed by 40 cycles (94 \u00b0C for 30 s, 50 \u00b0C for 45 s and 72 \u00b0C for 1 min) and a final step of 72 \u00b0C for 5 min. The PCR products separated by electrophoresis in a 1.5 % agarose gel together with a 100-bp DNA Ladder (Invitrogen\u2122), stained with GelRed\u2122 (Biotium) and viewed with the aid of a UV transilluminator. The amplification of the genomic target segment of IBV was performed in triplicate for each sample in the same run, and the products were sequenced separately.",
