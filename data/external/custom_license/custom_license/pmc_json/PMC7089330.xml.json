APN is mainly involved in ATP-dependent downstream processing during cytosolic protein degradation. It enables the utilization of amino acids as nutrients [2]. This enzyme is found in a variety of species, such as mammals, insects, plants, and bacteria. Human APN is identical to the human lymphocyte surface cluster differentiation antigen CD13. It is also known as APN/CD13, which is widely distributed in mammals. It is expressed on the surface of different cells, such as epithelial cells of the intestine and kidney, synaptic membranes in the central nervous system, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, epithelial cells, sebocytes, and keratinocytes [1]. Deregulation of APN/CD13 expression is observed in many diseases, such as cancer, chronic pain [3], and various forms of joint effusions, rheumatoid arthritis [4], multiple sclerosis [5], systemic sclerosis, and systemic lupus erythematosus [6]. APN plays a crucial role in tumor invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis [7] in cancer. The over-expression of APN was reported in breast, colon, gastric, ovarian, pancreatic, renal, and thyroid cancer [7]. Therefore, it is used as an important clinical marker in cancer [1]. APN also functions as a receptor for corona virus like gastroenteritis virus and human corona virus 229E [2]. Inhibition of APN/CD13 may be useful for treatment of such diseases [1]. Bestatin was first identified as APN inhibitor, isolated from Streptomyces olivoreticuli  [8], and reported to improve immunological functions by enhancing the chemotaxis of T lymphocytes. Although several small-molecule APN/CD13 inhibitors have been synthesized and evaluated biologically so far, it is still challenging to develop potent inhibitor with higher binding potential and efficacy. Recently, the X-ray crystal structure of human APN (hAPN) complex with bestatin [9] was reported, and it provided the opportunity to understand the mechanism of action of different APN inhibitors by structure-based analysis. In this study, an attempt was made to highlight the structural and physicochemical requirements of APN inhibitors. We also tried to find novel scaffolds as virtual hits to design potent drug-like APN inhibitors. Both ligand- and structure-based pharmacophore mapping studies were performed to identify the 3D structural requirements for potent APN inhibitory activity. Two different QSAR approaches, i.e., Bayesian modeling and recursive partitioning (RP) techniques, were adopted to understand the physicochemical and 2D structural requirements for better APN inhibitory activity. Simultaneously, \u2018multiple pharmacophore-based virtual screening\u2019 was employed for the selection of virtual hits from the diverse chemical databases. The best RP model was utilized to select virtual hits from the ligands obtained from \u2018multiple pharmacophore-based virtual screening\u2019. Comparative molecular docking studies with three different docking tools were performed to search the most potential drug-like virtual hits as well as to predict possible interactions between proposed virtual hits and the catalytic residues at the binding site of APN enzyme.",

From both pharmacophore mapping and RP modeling, it was inferred that polar groups and positive ionizable features play essential role in the enzyme inhibition. The Bayesian modeling reconfirmed that polar moieties, like amide, carboxylic acid, and phosphinyl groups are favorable. The functionality of aromatic moieties may be intriguing because these appeared in both favorable and unfavorable fingerprints. However, unfavorable aromatic rings were either attached to polar residues or have exocyclic conjugation. Both of the functionalities may be related to aromaticity of these rings. It was interesting to find that acyclic rings appeared as the most unfavorable fingerprints due to lack of features (positive charge, polarity, and ring aromaticity) required for higher activity.",

            "text": "Pharmacophore models (both ligand- and structure-based) are used for the screening of databases containing large number of diverse molecules to find compounds that could be proposed as potential virtual hits [39\u201346]. An ideal pharmacophore query is able to capture active molecules selectively from the databases discarding inactive molecules. Therefore, prior to virtual screening the selectivity of the model should be properly assessed. The decoy set validation is the most popular and widely used approach to confirm overall specificity of a model [43\u201346]. The decoy set is a set of compounds, where some known active compounds are combined with inactives or decoys, and the whole set is screened with the selected pharmacophore query. The selection of inactive compounds for decoy set validation is very crucial for unbiased virtual screening. The selectivity of the pharmacophore model may be represented either by ROC curve [43, 45] or by GH score [44, 46]. The largest public available database of decoys is directory of useful decoys (DUD), which provides decoys for limited number of targets [47]. In the absence of DUD for a particular target, the selection of inactives depends on the users. However, the latter approach may have two major limitations, (a) it often presumes the inactivity of the decoys despite lack of supporting evidence [48] and (b) the decoy selection method may lack transparency. Moreover, Verdonk et al. [49] earlier demonstrated that some 1D molecular properties may affect the results of docking-based virtual screening, and their proposal may be extrapolated to pharmacophore-based virtual screening as well [43]. According to Verdonk et al., it is not sufficient to use a random library (subsets of public databases) for performance assessments, but it is essential to build up a focused library that reflects the physicochemical properties of the active set. Verdonk principle may be utilized for the selection of decoys [49]. In the current approach an alternative procedure has been adopted which includes the following steps, (a) selection of an well identified and recognizable decoy set from a public database (i.e. BD), which is considerably less focused than internal dataset used for the pharmacophore model development, (b) validation of the decoy sets by multiple screening with three different pharmacophore models developed in the current study, and (c) determination of activity profile by RP model developed from the external data set. The justification of these steps (a, b and c) is discussed in the supporting information (Text S3).",

Ligand- and structure-based pharmacophore mapping, RP and Bayesian modeling were carried out and all models were properly validated to achieve the first objective. Both ligand- and structure-based pharmacophore mapping suggested that four features: (a) positive ionizable, (b) acceptor, (c) donor, and (d) ring aromatic are essential for the receptor\u2013ligand interactions. The 3D QSAR pharmacophore model may be utilized for prediction of bioactivity of the ligands. RP modeling was performed on a diverse set of molecules, and it showed positive ionizable (P) feature may be the most important determinant for APN inhibition, and increased polarity of the molecule has positive contribution for higher biological activity. Besides, hydrophobicity [related to ring aromatic (RA)] was also found to be involved in receptor\u2013ligand interaction. RP modeling presented some cut-off values of important descriptors that demarcate the active inhibitors from that of inactives. These may be utilized for the design of new molecules. In addition, Bayesian model highlighted some favorable and unfavorable fingerprints, which may also be utilized for the novel lead design purpose. The results of pharmacophore mapping, RP and Bayesian modeling were comparable and consistent enough to indicate the success of each modeling approach. To explore the second objective, an external random data set was constructed from reported APN inhibitors available in a public database (BD). It was shown that multiple screening by the ligand- and structure-based models may decrease the number of false positives gradually even from a random decoy set, the use of which is not recommended [49] for screening approaches in order to avoid low enrichment. Moreover, it was also found that the ligand- and structure-based pharmacophore models are complementary [51] because sequential screening by ligand- and structure-based pharmacophore queries gradually reduced the number of inactive virtual hits. The multiple screening followed by the RP prediction further reduced the number of false positive hits. This composite approach of screening also decreased the number of true positives to a considerable extent (Fig. 7). However, the main success of this approach lies in the fact that it is less complicated and maintains transparency in terms of the selection of decoys as well as the validation of the model. The last objective of the work was to search some potential virtual hits of APN inhibitors. Multiple pharmacophore screenings followed by RP prediction were carried out from some public databases. The retrieved virtual hits were tested for drug-likeness and pharmacokinetic properties. The filtered virtual hits were docked at the receptor active site, and four compounds showing consistent results in three different docking tools were ultimately proposed as the most potential virtual hits. All virtual hits were found to contain essential features like positive charge, polarity, and ring aromaticity, and may help to obtain useful APN inhibitors.",
