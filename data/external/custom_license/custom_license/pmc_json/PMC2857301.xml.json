At sites 1 and 2, bats of 2 species were sampled in colonies inhabiting 2 buildings 480 km apart on opposite sides of the continental divide of the Rocky Mountains. Eight occult myotis (Myotis occultus) and 1 Brazilian free-tailed bat (Tadarida brasiliensis) were captured in mist nets as they emerged from a roost in a building in Mancos in Montezuma County in southwestern Colorado (site 1) at dusk on August 19. This species was previously thought to be conspecific with the little brown bat (M. lucifugus) that is common throughout North America (16). Big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) were sampled at a roost in a building in Fort Collins in Larimer County in north-central Colorado (site 2) on August 7. Other bats (n = 27) were sampled at sites 3 and 4 incidental to ongoing, unrelated bat faunal surveys. One western small-footed myotis (M. ciliolabrum) and 1 long-eared myotis (M. evotis) were captured in mist nets over water on August 8 at Soapstone Prairie Natural Area in Larimer County (site 3). Four big brown bats, 3 long-eared myotis, 8 occult myotis, 1 Brazilian free-tailed bat, 7 long-legged myotis (M. volans), and 2 silver-haired bats (Lasionycteris noctivagans) were trapped in mist nets during the nights of August 14\u201320 as they drank or foraged near open water at 2 sewage treatment lagoons (9 km apart) (site 4) in Montezuma County, Colorado. Bats were captured under authority of a Colorado Division of Wildlife Scientific Collection License following procedures approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the US Geological Survey, Fort Collins Science Center. Typically, each bat was sampled within 5\u201310 minutes of capture and then released.",

Although these sequences were similar to those published for Asian bat group 1 coronaviruses, there was enough dissimilarity in this highly conserved region to suggest that the Rocky Mountain specimens represent unique coronaviruses (8,9). Phylogenetic analysis of this region of gene 1b suggests that the RM-Bt-CoVs cluster in 3 subgroups within group 1. Three of the 5 specimens from the occult myotis (samples 6, 11, and 48) were in 1 cluster and the other 2 (samples 3 and 27) formed a second cluster within group 1 coronaviruses.

Old World fruit bats (family Pteropodidae) are reservoirs for Hendra virus, which caused small outbreaks of severe respiratory illnesses in horses and humans in Australia (18\u201324) and Nipah virus, which caused large outbreaks of lethal encephalitis and respiratory illnesses in humans and pigs in Malaysia and Singapore (25\u201328). Old World fruit bats may also be the long-sought reservoir hosts for Ebola and Marburg viruses (29,30). More than 60 different RNA viruses have been isolated from and detected in bats, which play important roles in maintaining and transmitting zoonotic viruses (31\u201333).",

The gene encoding the viral spike glycoprotein that binds the virus receptor human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 was one of the fastest-adapting genes of SARS-CoV during the 2002\u20132003 epidemic. Nonsynonymous amino acid substitutions in the spike protein that were selected during the epidemic optimized binding of the spike to its human receptor and enhanced human-to-human transmission (34,35). Sequencing of SARS-CoV genomes during and after the epidemic suggests that multiple independent species-jumping events of SARS-CoV from animals to humans have occurred.",

Five (50%) of 10 occult myotis and 1 (17%) of 6 big brown bats tested contained low levels of coronavirus RNA in feces. No coronavirus RNA was detected in the oral or anal region swabs tested. Similarly in Asian bats, coronavirus RNA was found in a higher percentage of fecal samples than saliva samples (8,9,14). Thus, bats may be persistently infected carriers that shed low levels of coronaviruses in feces. Persistent fecal shedding of coronaviruses has also been detected in pigs, cats, dogs, and cattle (36). The mechanisms for persistent fecal shedding of viruses in bats without apparent disease have not yet been determined (32,33).",

Therefore, it is of great interest that group 1 coronaviruses have now been found in bats in North America as well as in Asia. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of related coronaviruses from different species of bats on different continents is likely to provide information about coronavirus evolution. Figure 2 shows the phylogeny of RM-Bt-CoVs in relation to group 1 coronaviruses from Asia on the basis of the 440-nt amplicon in gene 1b. Bats of the genera Myotis and Eptesicus are in the family Vespertilionidae, which has diversified into many different species in the Eastern and Western Hemispheres (17). Amplicons of 3 of the 5 coronaviruses (samples 6, 11, and 48) from occult myotis in Colorado have the highest nucleotide sequence identity with the HKU6 bat coronavirus found in an Asian bat of the same genus but a different species, Rickett\u2019s big-footed myotis (M. ricketti, subfamily Myotinae) (11,17). The coronavirus RNA in the big brown bat (sample 65) from Colorado (subfamily Vespertilioninae) was most similar to HKU2 bat coronavirus found in Asian bats in the family Rhinolophidae (11) (Figure 2). Rhinolophid bats are not found in the Western Hemisphere and are phylogenetically far removed from the big brown bat (37,38).",

For example, determining if North American bat coronaviruses are species-specific will provide useful information. In Asia, different species of bats roosting in the same cave host different coronaviruses (9).

The North American species of bats found to harbor group 1 coronaviruses commonly roost in buildings inhabited by humans (39), which provides ecologic overlap between these bats and humans. Before the SARS epidemic of 2002\u20132003, only 2 coronaviruses, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, were known to cause human disease, primarily mild upper respiratory tract infections. In contrast, SARS-CoV caused severe lower respiratory tract disease with a death rate of 10%.
