Approximately 16% of patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU) present with a pulmonary infection3. Additionally, the lung is the primary site of infection in over 60% of nosocomial infections occurring within the ICU3. Attributable mortality from ventilator-associated pneumonia is estimated to be 13%, but may be as high as 69% in certain subgroups4. Pulmonary infections in critically ill patients are caused by a wide range of organisms, including difficult-to-treat organisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa5. Use of appropriately targeted antimicrobial chemotherapy is associated with improved clinical outcomes6. However, clinical outcomes in patients that are infected with a susceptible organism receiving an appropriate antimicrobial agent remain sub-optimal. This is partly due to marked pharmacokinetic (PK) variability occurring in critically ill patients7. The PK of critically ill patients may be affected by physiological changes associated with illness, which typically results in a higher proportion of patients receiving sub-optimal drug exposure when a fixed regimen is used7\u20139. Additionally, many currently licensed drug regimens are informed by studies performed in non-critically ill patients, and may not necessarily be appropriate outside that context.",

            "text": "Piperacillin-tazobactam is a combination of an extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactam antibiotic (piperacillin) with a \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor (tazobactam). Piperacillin-tazobactam has a broad-spectrum of action that includes Gram-positive, Gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria10. Consequently, piperacillin-tazobactam is a common choice for both directed and empirical treatment of critically ill patients11. The pharmacodynamic index that best links piperacillin concentrations with its antimicrobial effect is the fraction of the dosing interval that unbound piperacillin concentrations are above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)12. Near-maximal antimicrobial effect is generally observed when free piperacillin concentrations exceed the MIC for at least 50% of the dosing interval (50% fT>MIC)13. However, 100% fT>MIC may be more appropriate for critically ill patients14. The global increase in the incidence of antimicrobial resistance has focused attention on antimicrobial drug regimens that are safe, effective and also minimise the probability of the emergence of antimicrobial resistance15. We recently used a hollow fibre infection model of piperacillin-tazobactam versus Pseudomonas aeruginosa to demonstrate a trough (Cmin) total piperacillin concentration-to-MIC ratio of between 3 and 10 prevents the emergence of antimicrobial resistance16. Identification of piperacillin-tazobactam regimens that enable the attainment of pharmacodynamic targets for both efficacy and suppression of emergence of antimicrobial resistance may led to improved clinical outcomes and increase the clinical longevity of this commonly used agent.",

For pulmonary infection, the epithelial lining fluid (ELF) represents a compartment that is both clinically relevant and accessible for measurement of drug concentrations18,19. In general, clinical \u03b2-lactam exposure\u2013response relationships within ELF are poorly defined18. An understanding of drug penetration into ELF and drug exposure-response relationships within that compartment are an important consideration when bridging from pre-clinical to clinical studies20. The pulmonary penetration ratio, or partition coefficient, relates drug exposure in ELF to drug exposure in plasma. Healthy volunteer data suggests the area under the concentration (AUC) time curve in ELF is \u224825% and \u224850% of the plasma piperacillin and tazobactam AUCs, respectively21. While there is a general paucity of information regarding ELF penetration of antimicrobial agents in critically ill patients, two studies suggest that piperacillin and tazobactam ELF concentrations are \u224850% and 65-90% of their respective paired plasma concentrations22,23.",

            "text": "Beta-lactam antibiotics penetrate the lung by passive diffusion18,29. Diffusion into tissues is dependent on the concentration gradient across biological membranes, the surface area of the membrane and a diffusion coefficent30. The diffusion coefficient is principally influenced by physicochemical characteristics of the drug (e.g. the degree of lipophilicity) and the extent of protein binding31,32. There was a positive correlation between plasma and ELF exposures for both piperacillin and tazobactam. However, these relationships did not reach statistical significance which is unexpected and perhaps due to the modest number of patients in the study. In this study we used the ratio of total protein in ELF to plasma as a surrogate measure of lung permeability33. We expected to see an increase in diffusion of drug with increasing pulmonary protein penetration. However, we observed a statistically significant negative correlation between the piperacillin pulmonary penetration ratio (AUCELF/AUCunbound plasma) and pulmonary permeability (Figure 5). As pulmonary permeability increased, there was a reduction in the relative proportion of piperacillin penetrating the lung. For tazobactam there was no statistically significant correlation between the pulmonary penetration ratio (AUCELF/AUCunbound plasma) and pulmonary permeability. The relationship between pulmonary permeability and pulmonary drug concentration has not previously been investigated for \u03b2-lactam antibiotics. Pulmonary vancomycin penetration has been shown to be higher in patients with increased pulmonary permeability as measured by ELF albumin concentration34. Lung penetration of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics has been shown to be dependent on plasma albumin concentration31,35,36. Increased tissue penetration occurs when higher unbound plasma \u03b2-lactam antibiotic concentrations are observed in patients with hypoalbuminaemia. This phenomenon primarily affects highly protein bound agents such as ertapenem and flucloxacillin31,35,36. There are a number of potential explanations for the relationship between piperacillin lung penetration and permeability. Methodologically, this is a small study with extreme PK variability in both the observed plasma and ELF drug concentration. Multiplication of the measured pulmonary sample concentration by a dilution factor, derived from comparison of urea concentrations in plasma and pulmonary samples37,38, may contribute to the greater variability observed in the pulmonary drug concentrations when compared with plasma concentrations. A possible biological explanation includes dilution of intra-pulmonary piperacillin due to larger ELF volumes that are associated with increasing pulmonary permeability. Alternatively, \u03b2-lactam antibiotics are substrates for organic anion transporters in other organs such as the kidney39. Disruption of an active transport system may occur in the injured lungs of critically ill patients, which exhibit increased permeability to protein. Another explanation may be that an increase in pulmonary protein permeability preferentially affects diffusion of piperacillin and tazobactam in and out of the lung. Therefore in lungs with low protein permeability, piperacillin diffuses into the lung faster than it diffuses out. The reverse occurs in lungs with higher protein permeability. Validation of negative correlation of pulmonary piperacillin penetration and pulmonary permeability is required in a similar clinical cohort.",

Micro-dialysis techniques may provide a better estimate of pulmonary drug concentrations than bronchoalveolar lavage for quantifying drug concentrations in ELF40. However, due to practical difficulties with pulmonary micro-dialysis, ELF sampling remains the most commonly utilised technique in both pre-clinical and clinical studies17,41. In this study we used NBL. NBL is a safe and effective way of sampling the lung and quantifying antimicrobial drug concentrations in the ELF of critically ill patients42. NBL is less invasive than bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), allowing multiple NBL samples to be collected throughout the dosing interval. The collection of two NBL samples from each patient, rather than one BAL provides a more robust estimate of the concentration-time profile in the ELF of individual patients. Only one minor adverse event was reported following NBL.",

For piperacillin the unbound piperacillin concentration must be above the MIC for at least 50% of the dosing interval is generally associated with near maximal efficacy (50% fT>MIC)13. We recently demonstrated a trough unbound piperacillin concentration to MIC ratio of >3.4 is required to suppress the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (Cmin/MIC>3.4)16. From the target attainment analysis (Figure 6) the empirical administration of piperacillin 4g three times daily, as a 30 minute infusion (i.e. the MIC is not known) results in an 80% probability of attainment of a pharmacodynamic target of plasma 50% fT>MIC or a 77% probability of attainment of a pharmacodynamic target of 50% ELF T>MIC. The probability of achieving the same pharmacodynamic targets increases to 86% and 82%, for plasma and ELF respectively, when the MIC is known and organisms with MICs beyond the breakpoint (i.e.>16 mg/L) are excluded. Therefore, 14-18% of patients with a \u201csusceptible\u201d organism will have sub-optimal drug exposure. Furthermore, approximately 60% of patients will not achieve the plasma or ELF pharmacodynamic targets associated with suppression of antimicrobial resistance (Cmin/MIC>3.4). This analysis identifies two important issues. Firstly, piperacillin 4g three times daily, as a 30 minute infusion, is inadequate for effective treatment and suppression of emergence of antimicrobial resistance in an unacceptably high proportion of critically ill patients, and especially those with pneumonia resulting from infection with a less susceptible organism. Secondly, the probability of achieving each of the pharmacodynamic targets (i.e. fT>MIC, Cmin/MIC etc) in plasma and ELF are similar. Plasma piperacillin concentrations do not precisely predict ELF piperacillin concentrations. Consequently, some individuals with \u201csufficient\u201d plasma piperacillin exposure will have inadequate ELF piperacillin exposures and vice-versa. ELF rather than plasma exposure has been shown to predict outcome for other antimicrobial agents17. The causative organisms were not isolated in our 17 patients which makes exploration of the relationship between piperacillin plasma and ELF pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamic (fT>MIC, Cmin/MIC) and clinical outcome impossible. Further appropriately powered clinical studies are required to examine whether piperacillin exposure in plasma or ELF better predicts clinical outcomes.",

The current regimen of piperacillin-tazobactam, at a fixed 8:1 ratio, is supported by in-vitro studies44\u201346. However, the pharmacodynamic index that best links \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor exposure with effect is poorly defined. Both: (i) the fraction of the dosing interval the \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor concentration is above a threshold (T>threshold) and (ii) the area under the \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor concentration time curve have been suggested as the relevant pharmacodynamic indeces47\u201349. The required concentration of \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor is dependent on the amount and type of \u03b2-lactamase50. Tazobactam penetrates the lung of most critically ill patients, but there is marked variability. Therefore, a subset of patients may have insufficient pulmonary tazobactam concentrations to adequately inhibit some \u03b2-lactamases that cause hydrolysis of piperacillin and clinical failure despite adequate piperacillin exposure. Increasing the tazobactam dosage (while maintaining the piperacillin dosage) may overcome \u03b2-lactamase production as has been demonstrated in an in-vivo meningitis model51. As plasma tazobactam exposure does not reflect tazobactam exposure in ELF, the identification of patients with poor pulmonary tazobactam penetration is difficult and appears to require direct sampling from the lung.",

Additionally we show an unexpected relationship of increased pulmonary permeability being associated with a reduction in pulmonary piperacillin penetration. We also demonstrated that predicting pulmonary piperacillin and tazobactam exposures on the basis of plasma drug exposures may be unreliable. Approprialty powered clinical trials are required to further defined the relationship between plasma and pulmonary drug exposures and establish the impact of pulmonary, rather than plasma, drug exposure on clinical outcome. Additionally pre-clinical and clinical studies are required to investigate mechanisms lung penetration in patients with pneumonia. Biomarkers related to pulmonary permeability or drug penetration could be incorportated as covariates into mathematical models to improve predictions of pulmonary drug exposures. New regimens of piperacillin-tazobactam may be required which optimise drug concentrations in the lung, at the site of infection. It is likely that a single regimen is not suitable for all individuals. If ELF exposure is shown to predict clinical outcome, with great accuracy than plasma exposure, and covariates for pulmonary drug penetration cannot be identified then direct measurement of drug concentrations in the pulmonary compartment, and adjustment of individual regimens may be required.",
