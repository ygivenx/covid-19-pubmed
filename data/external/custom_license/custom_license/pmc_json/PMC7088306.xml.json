            "text": "Enzymes offer tremendous opportunities for the chemical industry as they can efficiently and economically convert molecules and replace well-known and established industrial processes with more sustainable ones. Traditionally, enzymes are used by food and feed industry, but are increasingly implemented in emerging markets such as pharmaceutical and fine chemicals industries [18]. The production of catalytically active proteins in heterologous microbial and fungal hosts leads to lower costs and high yields, which is crucial for the economy of an industrial process. Escherichia coli is the host of choice if post-translational modifications of the enzyme are not required for its activity [19]. The use of E. coli as whole-cell biocatalyst offers additional benefits such as cofactor regeneration, high catalytic efficiency and mild and simple reaction conditions [24]. However, the production of misfolded and inactive aggregates such as inclusion bodies is problematic when recombinant proteins are over-expressed in bacteria. Strategies for overcoming this disadvantage of heterologous expression are the optimization of the expression system, e.g. by using tightly regulated promoters or by attaching solubility-enhancing fusion tags. When using whole-cell biocatalysts for biocatalysis, substrate and product transmembrane transport and cofactor regeneration capacity of the used strain must similarly be considered. For the moment, the most promising method for whole-cell biocatalysis seems to be the use of engineered E. coli, which offers the potential for large-scale and cost-effective production.",

Recently, the glycosylation reaction has attracted much attention because volatility, poor water solubility and instability limit the application of many small molecules in consumer products [7, 28]. The transfer of sugars to small molecules makes them non-volatile, more water-soluble and improves their stability, bioavailability and functionality. Volatile terpenols become non-volatile by glycosylation, allowing them to be applied as slow release aroma chemicals [29] and the water solubility of resveratrol increases by a factor of 1700 when sugars are attached, which results in improved bioavailability [21]. Glycosylated vitamin C and anthocyanidins are more stable than their non-glycosylated precursors [38, 39], alteration of the sugar residues of quercetin affects pharmacological properties [17], and transfer of sugars to the diterpenol steviol results in sweet tasting steviosides [10].",

            "text": "In nature, glycosylation reactions are primarily catalysed by nucleotide-sugar-dependent glycosyltransferases [30]. These enzymes transfer carbohydrate residues from activated sugar donors to a multitude of acceptor molecules, including proteins, saccharides, lipids and small molecules. Glycosylation of their \u2013OH, \u2013NH2, \u2013SH, and \u2013COOH groups results in O-, N-, S-glucosides, and sugar esters, respectively [16]. Uridine diphosphate sugar-dependent glycosyltransferases (UGT) form the largest group and are characterized by a unique C-terminal consensus sequence representing the sugar donor site [22]. Plant genomes are rich sources for UGT genes, which code, among others for biocatalysts that can transfer sugars to small molecules and on-going sequencing projects continuously deliver new nucleotide sequences (http://supfam.org/). These UGTs are capable of efficiently glycosylating various plant metabolites from different chemical classes in a stereo- and regioselective manner [23]. VvGT14a from grapevine (Vitis vinifera) is a promiscuous enzyme that can efficiently glucosylate not only terpenols such as geraniol, citronellol and nerol, but also eugenol [2]. Thus, plant glycosyltransferases are ideal biocatalysts for the biochemical and biotechnological production of small molecule glucosides but utilize costly cosubstrates such as UDP-glucose, which requires the use of whole-cell biocatalysts for cosubstrate recycling and efficient production [7].",

The potential strain activity is the product of the enzyme concentration and its correctly formed proportion. Enzyme level and productivity could be increased by influencing the expression of the gene of interest, by using an efficient origin of replication (ori) [24], and by choosing appropriate selection markers (e.g. antibiotic resistance gene). Product titre was also raised by utilizing additional beneficial genes (e.g. the lac-repressor lacI) [34], by optimizing the ribosomal binding site [37], or by fusing the enzyme to a solubility enhancing partner [33]. In addition, catalytic efficiency of biocatalysts was increased by random mutagenesis followed by a screening for better performing variants [9] and the lifetime of enzymes was extended by modifying the C-terminus [27]. Furthermore, additional expression of chaperones promoted proper folding and prevented the accumulation of inactive enzyme in inclusion bodies [36].",

            "text": "Therefore, optimization of the vector for improved process productivity involves the selection of a suitable resistance marker, ori, promoter, and fusion tag. Ampicillin was not suitable for high cell-density fermentation as it was rapidly degraded in the periplasm [1]. Kanamycin was more stable and better suited for high cell-density fermentations [31, 32]. The ori determines the plasmid copy number (PCN). Plasmids with the pBR322 ori resulted in a PCN of approximately 15\u201320 [3], whereas the high-copy ori RSF yielded PCN of over 100 copies [6]. The promoter affects the expression strength and tac and T7 are considered strong, inducible promoters [4, 35]. A gene containing a T7 promoter is only transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase encoded by the lambda DE3 prophage insertion. Therefore, only strains with the (DE3) insertion transcribe genes harbouring a T7 promoter [15]. The small fusion tags, His-tag and S-tag, are mainly used for protein purification purposes [40] while larger fusion tags are said to improve solubility. The SUMO- and the trxA-tags are 100 and 109 amino acids long, respectively, and the glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tag has a length of 211 amino acids [26]. Other fusion tags like NusA and MBP are also often used to facilitate higher solubility, however they are even bigger than GST with 495 and 396 amino acids, respectively [7]. NusA and MBP were not investigated in this study due to their enormous sizes. The aim of an optimal fusion protein is to facilitate higher solubility without impeding the strain\u2019s metabolism.",

The glucosyltransferase gene VvGT14a was isolated from Vitis vinifera and the encoded protein biochemically characterized [2]. VvGT14ao was cloned in frame with the N-terminal GST tag into the pGEX-4T-1 expression vector (Amersham Bioscience), which was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells. Eurofins Genomics (Ebersberg, Germany) synthesized the codon-optimized gene VvGT14ao. The expression vector pET-SUMO_VvGT14ao was produced by ligation independent cloning (LIC) [12]. The entry vector was linearized by using SspI and subsequently treated with T4 DNA polymerase and dGTP. The gene of interest was amplified by PCR using primers with the LIC-site extension (Supplemental Table S1). The purified PCR product was treated with T4 DNA polymerase and dCTP. The annealing was performed with a vector-to-insert ratio of 1:3 regarding to the amount of substance. All other constructs were produced by standard cloning procedures. For the cloning of the VvGT14ao gene, the entry vectors were digested with BamHI and NotI and dephosphorylated with FastAP. The gene of interest was amplified by PCR using primers with the corresponding BamHI-/NotI-extensions (Supplemental Table S1). Where applicable, the primers were additionally expanded with spacer bases to assure an in-frame insertion. The cleavage was also done with BamHI and NotI. The constructs were finished with a ligation. The vectors pGEX-K and pET32aK are modified versions of pGEX-4T-1 and pET32a. Their ampicillin cassettes were exchanged with the kanamycin resistance cassette KanR2 from pRSFDuet-1. For the cloning of pET32aK two parts, pET32a backbone and the kanamycin resistance gene, were amplified by PCR using primers with an Eco31I + linker-extension (Supplemental Table S1). Both parts were cleaved with the IIS nuclease Eco31I, creating two unique overhangs. The construct was finished with a ligation. For the cloning of pGEX-K, the entry vector pGEX-4T-1 was digested with AatII and BsaI and dephosphorylated by using FastAP. Subsequently, the DNA fragment was gel purified. The kanamycin resistance gene was amplified by PCR using primers with the corresponding AatII/BsaI-extensions (Supplemental Table S1). The cleavage of both parts was performed with AatII and BsaI. The construct was finished after ligation. All ligations were performed by T4 DNA ligase (Promega) with a vector-to-insert ratio of 1:3 by weight. The codon-optimized UGT gene VvGT14ao was cloned by a standard restriction-ligation procedure into respective plasmids to obtain pET29a_VvGT14ao, pET32a_VvGT14ao, pET32aK_VvGT14ao, pGEX-4T-1_VvGT14ao, pGEX-K_VvGT14ao and pRSFDuet-1_VvGT14ao (Supplemental Figure S1).

The plates allowed the downscaling from shaking flasks with 50 mL of culture to a working volume of 2 mL culture per well. Each well had a total volume of 25 mL, which allowed for high rotational speeds (Supplemental Table S2). The formation of a wave inside the wells could only be observed at rotational speeds upwards of 200 rpm. The maximum wave height was 6, 13, and 16 mm above the resting liquid level at rotational speeds of 300, 400, and 500 rpm, respectively. The formation of a wave increases the liquids surface and improves the surface/volume ratio further. This was necessary for good aeration and thus for unhindered cell growth. Experiments could be performed in parallel and in multiple determination across the 24 wells (4 \u00d7 6) of the plate. Multiple repetitions of biotransformation experiments confirmed the reproducibility of the experimental results (Fig. 1). Initially, the cell densities were adjusted before induction. Since the cell densities were only slightly different, but the workload involved was high, the laborious adaptation was omitted. Since the glucosyltransferase VvGT14ao (codon-optimized) from grapevine, which was used to develop the whole-cell biocatalysts exhibited promiscuous activity toward terpenols and phenols [2], four alcohols (geraniol, nerol, citronellol, and eugenol) were used as substrates.

E. coli BL21 does not carry the gene for T7 RNA polymerase and thus is only suitable for expression from promoters recognized by the E. coli RNA polymerase. The E. coli Waksman strain is a very fast growing strain, produces low amounts of acetate and can be grown to high cell density during fed-batch culture with relative ease, and has good tolerance for environmental stresses. E. coli Waksman, E. coli BL21(DE3), and E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS combined with pGEX-K_VvGT14ao (Fig. 3, strains #9, #11, and #12, respectively) only showed low product levels.

Focusing on the kanamycin-resistant strains, a trend was observed. The majority of E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS strains (strains #2, #4, #6, and #8) produced lower glucoside titres than their E. coli BL21(DE3) counterparts (strains #1, #3, #5, and #7). In both hosts, the expression of VvGT14ao prior to IPTG induction was inhibited by the lac-repressor lacI, which was constitutively expressed. In E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS the plasmid pLysS constitutively expressed T7 lysozyme, which suppressed the basal expression of the target protein even further by inhibiting the T7 RNA polymerase. The tendency of E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS strains to produce fewer glucosides was therefore explicable, as the residual basal expression of VvGT14ao should not be a heavy burden on the cell. The low expression of LacI had a rather small impact on the metabolism of the cell unlike the propagation of an extra plasmid such as pLysS. The extra tight expression provided by pLysS is only needed for the production of toxic proteins.",

In summary, it is anticipated that the expression of a SUMO-VvGT14ao fusion protein in E. coli BL21 would result a highly efficient whole-cell biocatalyst for the production of terpenyl and phenyl \u03b2-d-glucopyranosides. The results of the HP cultivation can be employed to select promising production strains for scale-up experiments in shaking flasks. The system can also be adapted to test other production strains for various whole-cell biotransformation applications.",

The production process includes the preparation of the pre-culture from fresh material (1), main culture (2), protein expression (3), biotransformation (4), sampling (5), HPLC analysis (6), and calculation of the product titre (7). Different strains were tested with this cultivation system to test its reproducibility. The cultivation was repeated four times in duplicate using geraniol as substrate. Geranyl glucoside was quantified by LC.

Four E. coli strains (BL21, BL21(DE3), BL21(DE3)pLysS, and Waksman) were combined with seven plasmids differing in antibiotic resistance (Amp and Kan), ori (pBR322 and RSF), promotor (tac and T7) and protein tag (GST, S, SUMO, trxA, and His). The combination of all suitable strains and vectors resulted in a total of 18 different strains. Each vector contained the gene coding for the glycosyltransferase VvGT14ao from Vitis vinifera.
