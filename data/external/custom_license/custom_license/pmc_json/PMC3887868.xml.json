These molecules play important roles in cellular signaling and homeostasis, which protect the human body against bacteria and viruses. Immune cells, including macrophages and neutrophils activated by either internal stimuli or environmental stressors, release excess amounts of ROS and RNS such as the superoxide radical anion (O2\u2022\u2212), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydroxyl radical (OH\u2022), nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and peroxynitrite (ONOO\u2212) due to activation of NADH/NADPH oxidase, 5-lipoxygenase, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in the mitochondria (Trachootham et al., 2008). This may result in noxious effects on cells by direct interaction with cellular macromolecules such as DNA, RNA, lipids and proteins; the damage caused by the free radicals is reported in the etiology of several diseases (Lee and Kang, 2013; Rahman et al., 2012; Valko et al., 2007).",

Zymosan is recognized and phagocytosed by macrophages, monocytes, leukotriens (LTs) and complements in the absence of immunoglobulins and leads to cellular activation, which stimulates secretion of many inflammatory products such as prostaglandins (PGs), LTs, cytokines, chemokines, and oxygen radicals (Volman et al., 2005). In addition, zymosan induces inflammatory signals by binding with Toll-like receptors (TLRs) after phagocytosis by macrophages, and the signals are prolonged because they are not degraded and can be enhanced by the use of mineral oil as a carrier (Sato et al., 2003).",

Among the quercetin-related bioflavonoids, quercitrin (quercetin 3-O-\u03b1-L-rhamnopyranoside) and isoquercitrin (quercetin 3-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside) have quercetin and either rhamnose or glucose as the glycoside moieties, respectively. Quercetin 3-O-\u03b2-(2\u2033-galloyl)-rhamnopyranoside (QGR) and quercetin 3-O-\u03b2-(2\u2033-galloyl)-glucopyranoside (QGG) were first isolated from the aerial parts of Polygonum salicifolium and Persicaria lapathifolia (Calis et al., 1999; Park et al., 1999), and contain gallic acid as their building block with either a quercitrin or isoquercitrin moiety, respectively (Kim et al., 2000). In this study, we found that QGR and QGG exhibited significant stronger antioxidant activity compared with their aglycone core structure (quercetin) and their building blocks (quercitrin, isoquercitrin and gallic acid) in zymosan-stimulated macrophages. In addition, both compounds exhibited anti-inflammatory activity through inhibition of the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-\u03baB), protein kinase A (PKA) and C (PKC) signaling pathways in zymosan-stimulated macrophages. However, the inhibitory action of QGR and QGG on their signaling was mediated by mechanisms distinct from those of quercetin.",

Quercetin effectively inhibited the phosphorylation and degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1, as well as the phosphorylation of NF-\u03baB p65 in zymosan-stimulated RAW264.7 cells, which is consistent with previous reports (Chen et al., 2005; Cho et al., 2003). However, treatment with QGR, QGG, quercitrin, isoquercitrin and gallic acid at up to 100 \u03bcM did not inhibit the phosphorylation and degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1, and phosphorylation of NF-\u03baB p65 (Fig. 7B).",

QGR and QGG inhibited the SEAP expression of CRE and AP-1 in a concentration-dependent manner. The inhibitory activities of QGR and QGG on both CRE and AP-1 transcription were similar but slightly weaker than that of quercetin (Figs. 8A and 8B). However, quercetin, QGR and QGG had no effects on SEAP expression of the SRE and NFAT (Supplementary Fig. S2). The transcriptional activation of CRE and AP-1 is implicated in either the cAMP/PKA or JNK pathway. In addition, PKC activity is important during superoxide generation in the membrane-associated NADPH oxidase complex. Although QGR and QGG inhibited the transcriptional activity of CRE, neither affected PKA or PKC activity. However, quercetin inhibited PKA, but not PKC, activity. Additionally, quercitrin, isoquercitrin and gallic acid did not affect PKA or PKC activity (Fig. 8C). Regarding JNK signaling, QGR, QGG and quercetin inhibited JNK phosphorylation, but quercitrin, isoquercitrin and gallic acid did not (Fig. 8D).

To prevent ROS- and RNS-mediated damage, the human body has multiple enzymatic antioxidant systems, such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase (Irshad and Chaudhuri, 2002). Low levels of ROS and RNS generated by natural by-products are considered beneficial for the cellular immune response against invading microorganisms. However, excessive amounts of these molecules generated during oxidative stress have been implicated in various pathogenic conditions, and activate various signaling pathways through oxidation of reactive cysteine residues on specific target molecules. Therefore, regulation of the ROS- and RNS-generation systems and scavenging of the ROS and RNS generated is important for prevention of oxidative stress-related disorders. We assayed DPPH radical scavenging activity, superoxide production, superoxide scavenging activity, MPO activity, and NO and ONOO\u2212 production in zymosan-stimulated macrophages to investigate the antioxidant activity of structurally quercetin-related flavonoids and gallic acid. QGR and QGG exhibited the greatest antioxidant potential as indicated by scavenging activity and inhibition of ROS and RNS production. Although quercetin also showed effective antioxidant activity, no peroxynitrite scavenging and MPO activities were observed. Quercitrin, isoquercitrin and gallic acid showed similar antioxidant potentials, which was lower than those of QGR, QGG and quercetin. In flavonoids, the 3\u20324\u2032-dihydroxy B-ring and hydroxyl group at position 3 of the C-ring are structurally important for antioxidant activity (Cao et al., 1997; Choi et al., 2002; Heijnen et al., 2001). QGR and QGG contain either quercitrin or isoquercitrin and galloyl moieties in their structures, while quercitrin and isoquercitrin contain a quercetin moiety as well as a glycoside (rhamnose or glucose). Despite the importance of the phenolic hydroxyl groups of quercetin for the antioxidant activities of QGR and QGG, the galloyl moiety appears to play a more pivotal role as indicated by the significant increase in activity, even though the activity of gallic acid was either very low or nonexistent.",

Quercitrin and QGR also inhibit NF-\u03baB activation and iNOS expression, as well as NO production (Camuesco et al., 2004; Kim et al., 2005). We found that quercetin inhibited iNOS expression by targeting the phosphorylation and degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 in zymosan-stimulated RAW264.7 cells, indicating an upstream target of NF-\u03baB; this is consistent with other reports. However, QGR and QGG exhibited different NF-\u03baB-mediated mechanisms of inhibition of NO production and iNOS expression than quercetin. QGR and QGG inhibited DNA binding of the NF-\u03baB complex in the nucleus without affecting phosphorylation and degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1, whereas quercitrin, isoquercitrin and gallic acid did not inhibit NO production and iNOS expression. Therefore, gallic acid is essential for inhibition on the NF-\u03baB signaling by QGR and QGG, even though quercitrin and isoquercitrin do not affect this signaling.",

Similar to quercetin in NF-\u03baB signaling, the molecular targets of QGR and QGG in both the cAMP/PKA and JNK/AP-1 signaling pathways differed. Moreover, gallic acid was essential for the QGR and QGG activity because their building blocks quercitrin, isoquercitrin and gallic acid did not inhibit these signaling pathways.",

            "text": "NADPH oxidase and iNOS produce superoxide, NO and ONOO\u2212 in activated immune cells (Bedard and Krause, 2007; Montezano and Touyz, 2012). The NADPH oxidase complex is composed of the membrane-associated cytochrome B558 and the cytoplasmic complex p40phox, p47phox and p67phox (Babior, 1999). PKC, specifically PKC\u03b4, is important for activation of the NADPH oxidase complex (Brown et al., 2003). In addition, zymosan activates PKC via a receptor-mediated signaling pathway, and PMA is a direct activator of PKC in phagocytes (Klebanoff and Headley, 1999; Liu and Heckman, 1998; Phillips et al., 1992). Although quercetin, QGR and QGG effectively inhibited superoxide production in zymosan-or PMA-stimulated RAW264.7 cells, these compounds showed no significant inhibitory effects on PKC activity, suggesting prevention of the membrane-associated assembly of the NADPH oxidase complex, an event downstream of PKC-mediated phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic p47phox component that is similar to the NADPH oxidase-inhibitory mechanism of apocynin (Stolk et al., 1994). Zymosan and PMA induce NADPH oxidase activation by phosphorylation of the p47phox and activation of the Rac2 through signaling pathways of the protein tyrosine kinases, phosphatidylinositol 3\u2032-kinase (PI3K), PKC, ERK1/2 and p38 MAP kinases (Karlsson et al., 2000; Makni-Maalej et al., 2013; Raad et al., 2009). Our results indicated that strong anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of qurecetin, QGR and QGG than quercitrin, isoquercitrin and gallic acid resulted in regulation of the NADPH oxidase complex, specifically p47phox.",
