In fact, mortality reaches 30\u201375 % during aplasia after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) [2\u20134]. Human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV-3) causes bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children <6 months old, and mild respiratory tract infections in both immunocompetent children and adults during the spring and summer months. Outbreaks of severe pneumonitis due to HPIV-3 have been previously described in immunocompromised patients, particularly after HSCT [2, 3, 5]. Therefore, a rapid screening of HPIV-3 in symptomatic patients at risk is indicated to investigate and control nosocomial transmission. Multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a rapid method that allows the simultaneous identification of several respiratory viruses [6].",

Almost complete HN coding sequence (1,703 bp) from laboratory-confirmed HPIV-3 specimens collected during the study period was amplified by one-step RT-PCR and sequenced using primers as previously described [7], with minor modifications. In addition, other HPIV-3-positive samples collected after and before the outbreak occurred were also included in the phylogenetic analysis (collection dates are shown in brackets of taxon names of the phylogenetic tree, Fig. 1). Purified PCR products using ExoSAP-IT (USB, Affymetrix, Inc., Cleveland, OH, USA) were sequenced by the ABI Prism BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit v3.1 on an ABI PRISM 3130XL sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The nucleotide sequences were assembled and edited using SeqScape v2.5 software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Sequences were aligned using the MUSCLE program, implemented in MEGA 5.1 [8]. The molecular evolutionary models of nucleotide substitution were fitted to the multiple sequence alignments using evolutionary analyses conducted in MEGA 5.1. The phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using a neighbor-joining distance method as implemented in MEGA 5.1 with the evolutionary model with the lowest Bayesian information criterion score. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. Reliability for the internal branch was assessed using the non-parametric bootstrap analysis with 1,000 replicates.",

Demonstration of HPIV-3 infection in a patient with persistent fever may help to orientate its origin. Although coinfection with other pathogens needs to be ruled out, extra diagnostic procedures and treatment to find the origin of the persistent fever must be conducted keeping it in mind. In regard to HPIV-3 diagnosis, multiplex real-time PCR has demonstrated to be a rapid, sensitive, and specific technique for the detection of several respiratory viruses in a single assay [6]. This is especially useful in immunocompromised patients, as it permits a prompt diagnosis during the early phase of the infection, when only slight symptoms have appeared. On the other hand, when this test cannot be performed, other radiological findings could help to suspect this infection, such as the presence of multiple small and non-cavitating nodules with irregular margins, which has been specifically related with HPIV-3 infection, although consolidation has been described too [10].",
