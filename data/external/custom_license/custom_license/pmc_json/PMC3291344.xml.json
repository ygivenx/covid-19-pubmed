Using the simulation model, we generated outbreak signals and time until the first clinical diagnosis for 3 amounts of spores released. To incorporate into the model the uncertainty in parameter values, we used a Latin hypercube sampling design, which allows many parameter values to vary simultaneously (15). The 3,000 simulated signals generated with this sampling strategy were superimposed in turn onto baseline administrative records of ambulatory healthcare visits in the Norfolk, Virginia, area. These records are generated daily and similar types of records are used widely for syndromic surveillance (4,7,9). We assessed the usefulness of syndromic surveillance by modeling the healthcare system use that would occur after an anthrax attack and superimposing this use onto actual administrative data over 1-year period. Finally, we assessed, over a range of specificity, the sensitivity and timeliness of syndromic surveillance and the detection benefit of syndromic surveillance compared with clinical case finding for each simulated outbreak. We summarize our methods in the remainder of this section and refer readers to the Technical Appendix for additional details.",

This is a probit model with a 50% lethal dose (LD50) of 8,600 spores and a slope of 0.67. Uncertainty exists about the values for many of the parameters in the disease and healthcare use models. To incorporate this uncertainty into our estimates, we used a Latin hypercube sampling approach to sample parameter values for random variables in our simulation model (15). This approach requires specifying equal probability bins for parameter values. We specified 3 bins for each parameter value, a narrow bin around the most likely estimate, and wider bins on either side of the estimate. Table 1 shows the bins we used for each parameter value, the probability distribution that each value parameterizes, and the sources that we used to define the bins.",

Timeliness is the duration between the release of anthrax spores and the first report of an outbreak. We also computed the detection benefit of syndromic surveillance relative to clinical case finding, and the proportion of runs with a detection benefit >0. Detection benefit is the potential time saved in detection from using syndromic surveillance compared with clinical case finding. The benefit is calculated as the difference in the timeliness between syndromic surveillance and clinical case finding in those simulations in which detection occurred first by syndromic surveillance. When an outbreak was not detected by syndromic surveillance, the detection benefit was 0. For a given release scenario, each of the 1,000 simulations integrated both randomness in the component model outputs as well as uncertainty in component model parameters. Each of the 1,000 simulations is a sample from the integrated distribution of possible outcomes. To indicate the spread of the integrated uncertainty distribution, we calculated the upper and lower deciles from the 1,000 simulations. For plots, we calculated 95% confidence intervals, which reflect finiteness of the simulation.",

In contrast, the appropriate action after a result from syndromic surveillance system is not well-defined (34). For example, some public health departments routinely wait 1 day for a second alarm before taking action (35). This strategy could eliminate the potential detection benefit of syndromic surveillance. Another concern is the relatively low specificity at which syndromic surveillance must operate to consistently result in a detection benefit. A system producing this many false alarms may result in excessive costs, and users may minimize the importance of these results.",

Although our sampling approach did allow us to vary many parameter values simultaneously, it did not clarify how the results vary in relation to changes in the value of a single parameter. Our estimate of detection performance through syndromic surveillance is comparable to estimates observed through studies that used simulation models (12,37), but those studies did not allow direct comparison of detection through syndromic surveillance with detection through clinical case finding. Our estimate of the time until detection through clinical case finding is longer than the estimate used by the authors of a study aimed at modeling response strategies to an anthrax outbreak (2), but those authors did not provide a clear rationale for the value they chose. An initial presumptive diagnosis may occur earlier than the first positive blood culture result (e.g., through clinical symptoms and chest radiographs), but a decision for large-scale intervention would likely not be made until at least after the first definitive diagnosis was made.",
