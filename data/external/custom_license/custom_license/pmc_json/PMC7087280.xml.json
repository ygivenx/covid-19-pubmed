The subfamily Parvovirinae is further divided into eight genera: Amdoparvovirus, Aveparvovirus, Bocaparvovirus, Copiparvovirus, Dependoparvovirus, Erythroparvovirus, Protoparvovirus, and Tetraparvovirus [2]. The genus Bocaparvovirus contains small, non-enveloped, autonomously replicating, single-stranded DNA viruses with an icosahedral capsid. Bocaparvoviruses are unique among parvoviruses, as they contain a third open reading frame (ORF) between the regions encoding the non-structural and structural proteins, and they have a genome length of approximately 5.4 kb. The genus was originally named according to its initial two members, bovine parvovirus (BPV) and minute virus of canines (MVC) [1, 13, 18, 19].",

MVC was first discovered in Germany in 1967 in feces samples of clinically healthy dogs [5, 12]. Initially, MVC was not thought to cause disease; however, several studies, including experimental infections, revealed its role as a pathogen in newborn pups and canine fetuses [4, 6]. Recently, MVC was reported to be associated with neurological disease in dogs of various ages [7] and with severe gastroenteritis in an elderly dog [15].",

Briefly, a specific region (nucleotides 606\u20131112) of the NS1 gene of the 15D009 strain was amplified by PCR, using NS1 forward (5\u2019 AACGCGATTTGCACCTTCAT 3\u2019) and NS1 reverse (5\u2019 CATCAAACATTTCTCCGGCA 3\u2019) primers. The PCR product was labeled with digoxigenin (DIG) and subsequently used as a hybridization probe. Using this probe, the tissues of parenchymal organs taken from the infected dogs were investigated for the presence of MVC nucleic acid. To detect MVC DNA, additional paraffin-embedded tissues were sectioned at 4-\u03bcm thickness and hybridized in situ using a fully automated system (NexES IHC instrument; Ventana Medical Systems, Inc., Tucson, AZ, USA) and a DAB detection system (Ventana Medical Systems Inc.). The tissue sections were deparaffinized (standard xylene and industrial methanol) and fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 10 min. Tissues were then permeabilized by incubation in 0.1 M HCl containing 1 mg of pepsin per mL for 20 min at 37 \u00b0C, followed by denaturation at 70 \u00b0C for 10 min before hybridization with the DIG-labeled riboprobes at 65 \u00b0C for 6 h. After hybridization, samples were washed twice 0.1\u00d7 SSC at 75 \u00b0C for 6 min, followed by PBS at room temperature for 5 min. After hybridization, slides were incubated with QDs 605\u2013conjugated anti-DIG antibody (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 30 min and then rinsed twice in PBS for 5 min. All tissue sections were mounted with coverslips using 90 % (v/v) glycerol/PBS mounting solution. The DAB detection system was then used to detect antibody binding. Finally, sections were incubated at 37 \u00b0C and then counterstained with hematoxylin and post-counterstained with bluing reagent.",

            "text": "The NS1 region of 15D009 strain shared 81.7-88.4 % nucleotide and 86.7-93.5 % amino acid sequence identity with the other MVC strains (Table 1). These values are lower than the mean nucleotide and amino acid sequence identity values for the NS1 regions of other MVC strains (approximately 94.7 % and 95.0 %, respectively). The VP1/VP2 region of 15D009 strain shared 86.3-86.8 % nucleotide and 95.1-96.4 % amino acid sequence identity with other MVC strains (Table 1), which is also lower than the mean nucleotide and amino acid sequence identity values for the VP1/VP2 region of other MVC strains (approximately 97.8 % and 98.6 %, respectively). Phylogenetic analysis based on these NS1 and VP1/VP2 regions also showed that the 15D009 strain formed a distinct branch that was separate from the other previous MVC strains. This indicates that this strain is distinct from these previously isolated strains (Fig. 2). However, the NP1 region of the 15D009 strain showed greater nucleotide and amino acid sequence similarity to that of the HM-6 strain (AB158475), which was isolated from a Korean dog in 2004 (99.1 % and 99.4 %, respectively), compared to those of the other MVC strains (mean similarities of 90.9-91.4 % and 93.0 %, respectively) (Table 1). Phylogenetic analysis based on the NP1 region of the MVC strains also showed that the 15D009 and HM-6 strains fell into the same cluster, which is distinct from other MVC strains (Fig. 2). The high level of nucleotide and amino acid sequence similarity in the NP1 region between these two Korean strains implies that the 15D009 strain could be a mutated strain of HM-6 or an endemic strain from Korea that has not been isolated previously. In addition, the coding region of 15D009 shared 84.1-87.8 % nucleotide sequence identity to the other MVC strains (Table 1), and this value is lower than the mean nucleotide sequence identity of the coding region of the other MVC strains (approximately 96.2 %). Phylogenetic analysis based on the complete sequence of the 15D009 strain indicated that this strain could be correctly classified as an MVC strain, although it forms a distinct branch on phylogenetic trees when analyzed with respect to the NS1 and VP1/VP2 regions. Interestingly, the MVC strains, including the 15D009 strain, are more closely related to feline bocaviruses than the novel canine bocaviruses (Fig. 2). This observation supports the possibility of a common origin and cross-species transmission between MVC and feline bocavirus.\n\n",

            "text": "In conclusion, our results indicate that the MVC 15D009 strain is a possible cause of degenerative viral hepatitis in dogs. Although liver degeneration in canines has also been described at post-mortem examination of a pup infected with MVC [6], and a novel bocavirus (KC580640) that was highly divergent from known MVC strains has been isolated from canine liver [11], hepatitis with evidence of intranuclear inclusion bodies that correspond to MVC infection has not yet been reported. Therefore, the present study suggests two possible mechanisms for the observation of hepatic intranuclear inclusion bodies following infection with the novel MVC 15D009 strain. First, there is the possibility of pathogenic variation between the 15D009 and other MVC strains, based on differences in nucleotide and amino acid sequences. The 15D009 strain showed comparatively low nucleotide and amino acid sequence similarity to other MVC strains, except in the NP1 region of the HM-6 strain, and the region related to pathogenicity might be altered, resulting in an acquired ability to cause hepatitis. The second possibility is that an immunocompromised state of the host animal might affect virulence. Generally, the pathogenic potential of MVC for adult dogs has been considered minimal [1, 4, 5, 13]. However, the host animal in the present study had surgery a few days before presenting with symptoms, and this procedure may have weakened the host immune system, which can be influenced by factors such as stress, anesthetic effects, or the effects of other drugs. This weakened immunity might explain the occurrence of hepatitis; in fact, simultaneous human bocavirus infection and hepatitis has been reported in a boy with severe T-cell immunodeficiency [10]. Further studies, such as isolation of the 15D009 strain and a subsequent animal inoculation tests, are required to clarify the exact relationship between this strain and hepatitis and to determine the distribution, diversity, and pathogenesis of MVC in dogs.",
