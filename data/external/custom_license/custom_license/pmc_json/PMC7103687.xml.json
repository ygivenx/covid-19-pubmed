As\nwe will see further in this review, numerous assays are offered, all of which use the same\ninstrument, and all cartridges fit the instrument. Instruments are available in varying\nsizes, from a single-cartridge system all the way up to a system that holds 80 cartridges\nat one time. The GeneXpert Infinity systems hold either 48 or 80 cartridges and are\nequipped with a robotic loading system, further reducing the hands-on time in high-volume\nlaboratories. Each module within a system operates individually, so the system is\nrandom-access, and can run as many different assays as the lab would like at the same time\n(e.g. an influenza assay can run at one time, and at any time later, a Clostridium\ndifficile assay can run in the module next door, etc.). Therefore, this system\nis extremely flexible for laboratories of all sizes. A sample is pipetted into the sample\narea of a cartridge, and the cartridge is loaded into individual modules within the system\nby simply opening the drawer and inserting the cartridge, similar to how an ink-jet\nprinter is loaded with an ink cartridge. Within the instrument, a plunger descends into\nthe cartridge, which forces a valve body to rotate. Multiple plunges and rotations occur,\nwhich isolates the organisms onto a solid membrane and adds reagents to the solution.\nLysis occurs via sonication and additional rotations of the valves occur to add more\nreagents and force the sample into the reaction chamber, which juts out from the cartridge\nsimilar to a shark fin. Following one round of thermocycling, the solution is pulled back\ninto the cartridge, additional reagents are added, and the solution is forced back into\nthe reaction chamber to undergo another round of thermocycling, which is accompanied by\ncolor detection to complete the real-time PCR reaction.",

The FilmArray pouch contains freeze-dried\nreagents in discrete blisters; steps within the multiplex, nested PCR process, and melting\ncurve analysis are completed in each blister. The pouch is entirely closed, including\nwaste, and the pouch is disposed of after a single use. The user adds a provided hydration\nsolution to the pouch by drawing up the solution into a syringe and then placing the\nsyringe into a port on the pouch; the pouch draws up the required volume with a vacuum so\nthat measurement is not necessary by the user.

The CDC\nrecommends placing these patients in a private room to minimize the transmission.[79] One major associated cost with C. difficile\ninfection is the length of hospital stay. Slow TATs of some of the available tests can\nattribute to the longer stay and perhaps unnecessary isolation. Rapid molecular testing\nhas a higher sensitivity and specificity compared to other rapid tests and only one\nsample is required. Faster TAT leads to earlier detection, reduced repeat testing, and\nultimately shorter hospital stay and unnecessary isolation.[84] Many institutions place patients in contact isolation when C.\ndifficile is suspected. Often this is done by flagging patients who have a\npending order for a C. difficile test. Therefore, they may stay in\nisolation until the C. difficile test is negative. In this approach,\nthe longer the C. difficile test takes, the longer a patient may stay\nin isolation who may or may not need it. Isolation not only implies extra costs for the\nhospitals and patients but also leads to patient dissatisfaction.[84,85] A study that was published in Society for\nHealth care epidemiology of America (SHEA) found that patients placed in contact\nisolation were likely to report perceived care problems twice as much as patients not in\ncontact isolation.[85]",

A\nmeta-analysis of online data from 1999\u20132010 reported that despite the high sensitivity\nand specificity of PCR for C. difficile, the accuracy of the assay\ndepends on the C. difficile prevalence. When C.\ndifficile prevalence in the tested population was <10%, the positive\npredictive value was only 71%. This can possibly lead to overtreatment and unnecessary\nisolation. On the other hand, at a C. difficile prevalence of >20%,\nthe PPV was 93%. Therefore, PCR might not be the best diagnostic test in patient\npopulations with low prevalence.[86] The other limitation is\nthat the molecular assay very specifically detects the gene encoding the toxin and not\nthe toxin itself. This may result in positive results in asymptomatic C.\ndifficile carrier patients.[86] Hence, some\ninstitutions have instituted algorithms using both PCR and the toxin EIA in order to\nincrease the positive predictive value. In addition, asymptomatic colonization with\ntoxigenic C. difficile is common in children < 1 year old (50\u201370% of\nhealthy neonates), which makes interpretation of a positive result complicated.[66,86]",

Additionally, signs and\nsymptoms can be nonspecific and easily confused with other genitourinary diseases.[89] Diagnostic techniques that are rapid and highly sensitive and\nspecific should increase the rate of treatment and time to treatment and partner\nnotification, which should reduce the overall transmission and prevalence in a community.\nConventional methods in this field include culture, laboratory-developed molecular assays,\nserology, and immunochromatographic POC tests, the latter of which are not routinely used\ndue to poor performance.
