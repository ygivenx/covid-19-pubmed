The first inclusion criterion was serologic evidence of SARS-CoV infection. Altogether, 433 patients who exhibited either seroconversion or a fourfold rise in anti\u2013SARS-CoV immunoglobulin (Ig)G antibody titer were identified. Detection of anti-SARS-CoV IgG antibody was based on an in-house immunofluorescence assay that used virus-infected cells. Of the 433 patients with positive serologic test results, 18 were excluded because no samples had been collected for virus detection. As a result, 415 patients were included in this study. Twelve were pediatric patients 3\u201316 years of age (mean 11.3, standard deviation [SD] 4.1), divided equally between girls and boys. Three hundred thirty-five were adult patients 17\u201364 years of age (mean 37.1, [SD 11.2), with 60.9% females. The remaining 68 were elderly patients 65\u201397 years of age (mean 76.7, SD 8.2), with 37 (54.4%) women. Altogether, 48/335 (14.3%) of the adult group and 2/68 (2.9%), respectively, of the elderly group required ventilation and received intensive care but recovered; 4/335 (1.2%) of adults and 21/68 (30.9%) of elderly patients died of the infection. All children recovered without requiring mechanical ventilation or intensive care.",

This achievement led to the hope for an accurate laboratory diagnosis to guide patient management and to control the spread of infection. During the course of the outbreak, a few centralized laboratories were set up in Hong Kong. All possible resources were deployed to provide a rapid diagnostic service for SARS patients, and a turnaround time of 24 to 48 hours was achieved for RT-PCR. From our experience, more than half of the patients did not have any positive virologic findings. For these patients, the diagnosis could not be confirmed until a convalescent-phase serum specimen was available at a later stage. Thoroughly understanding the viral shedding pattern, the diagnostic yield of various specimen types, and various detection methods is crucial to improve the diagnostic performance.",

In addition, respiratory shedding >2 weeks after the onset of symptoms was common. This pattern of respiratory shedding is consistent with a previous report of a community outbreak in Hong Kong (15). We found that the peak of viral shedding in stool occurred a few days after that of respiratory shedding. The ability to detect virus in stool specimens peaked at the beginning of the second week and remained high over week 3 and week 4. Occasionally, the shedding of virus in stool could last for more than 6 weeks after the onset of symptoms. The viral shedding peak in urine occurred even later, at weeks 3\u20134.",

This, together with the prolonged viral shedding, could partly explain the propensity for this infection to be transmitted in healthcare settings. We observed that all those who shed virus for a prolonged period (arbitrarily defined as the shedding viruses >6 weeks after onset of symptoms) had their positive samples collected while still critically ill and had received intensive care. The infectiousness of these patients is difficult to discuss because the virus was detected by RT-PCR but not by virus isolation. Nevertheless, further investigations on whether the adverse outcome could be related to inadequate viral clearance are worth pursuing.",

In addition to the difference in the sensitivity of detection assays used, the procedures of gargle sample collection could have affected the diagnostic yield.

Our data indicate that a combination of stool sample and pooled throat and nasal swab specimens should be the specimens of choice for a safe and high-yield SARS-CoV detection.

However, stool and rectal swab specimens had a much lower isolation/RT-PCR index. The presence of toxic substances in stool or rectal swab samples may have interfered with virus isolation. However, toxicity was only occasionally observed on Vero E6 monolayers after adding stool or rectal swab samples. SARS-CoV can survive for at least 2\u20134 days at room temperature when mixed with diarrheal or normal stool specimens (18). Thus, the poor isolation rate could not be a result of viral inactivation by fecal contents during specimen storage and transport. The big difference in isolation rate from stool compared to respiratory and urine samples deserve further investigation, and the possibility of viral growth interference due the presence of immunoglobulin (Ig)A antibodies needs to be considered.",

If this approach is successful, it will close the gap caused by lower virus shedding from the gastrointestinal or respiratory tract that occurs in the first few days after the onset of symptoms. Second, a SARS-CoV-specific monoclonal antibody would be valuable in developing an immunofluorescence assay to detect virus-infected cells from respiratory samples. Such an approach has been shown to provide high sensitivity for influenza and respiratory syncytial viruses. Third, an assay should be developed to detect viral antigens from stool samples as is available for rotavirus detection. Further work to improve the sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic assays for SARS-CoV is needed. The unusual shedding pattern of SARS-CoV should be considered when formulating infection control strategies.",
