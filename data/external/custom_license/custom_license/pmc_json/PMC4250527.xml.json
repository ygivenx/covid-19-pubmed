So far, factors that determine the variable outcomes of HBV infection are little known. Besides pathogenesis of virus, environment factors, ethnic differences and genetic susceptibility have also been reported to have an effect on the progression of this liver disease[2]. Recently, a number of studies have shown that genetic polymorphisms of cytokines have a correlation with the outcomes of HBV infection[3],[4]. However, controversies exist among similar studies.",

The expression and function of ER might be influenced by its own variation and thus modulate diverse pathologies correlated with prognosis and survival of chronic hepatopathy[17],[18]. Previous studies[19]-[21] reported an association of ER polymorphisms with susceptibility to chronic HBV infection and other chronic hepatic diseases. Deng et al.[19] found that, as a haplotype-tagging SNP, ER\u03b1 rs2077647 T/C genotype (previous reported c.30T > C, exon 1) had an influence on susceptibility to persistent HBV infection and HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma. It was also observed that the relative messenger RNA levels of the at-risk C allele of rs2077647 were consistently higher than those of the T allele in the heterozygous cells[22]. Therefore, it is rational to consider that ER\u03b1 may be a biological candidate susceptibility gene for chronic HBV infection.",

On one hand, in acute self-limited HBV infection, the antigen-specific fraction of T cells selectively secrete Th1-type cytokines, with a predominance of IFN-\u03b3[23]. On the other hand, cell clones from persons with chronic HBV infection produce a predominantly type 2 response[24]. IFN-\u03b3 rs2430561T/A is a SNP located in the first intron of the IFN-\u03b3 gene, which is confirmed to coincide with the nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) binding region[25]. It had been demonstrated that possession of rs2430561T and A alleles should be associated with high and low IFN-\u03b3 expression, respectively[7],[25]. In this study, we performed a meta-analysis and concluded that IFN-\u03b3 rs2430561 T allele was associated with significantly reduced risk of persistent HBV infection and the carriers with the IFN-\u03b3 rs2430561 TT genotype were more likely to clear HBV spontaneously compared with those carrying the IFN-\u03b3 rs2430561 AA genotype. In stratified analyses, the results did not change in Asian and hospital-based subgroups. However, when studies not in HWE were excluded, the results showed no significance. Nevertheless, it was still meaningful that IFN-\u03b3 rs2430561 T allele and TT genotype could up-regulate the expression of IFN-\u03b3, rendering these subjects less prone to persistent HBV infection. Most importantly, more functional analyses should be conducted to demonstrate it.",

However, prior studies had shown that this SNP correlated with both spontaneous and anti-viral treatment-induced HCV clearance[26],[27]. These conflicting results suggested that although HBV and HCV shared a similar natural history, pathogenesis and transmission modality[28], rs12979860 might alter the immune responses against HCV but not HBV. Potentially, this could be explained by the characteristics of IL28B. By triggering a cascade through the JAK-STAT (Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription, JAK-STAT) pathway, IL28B up-regulates the IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and produces an antiviral state[29]. In addition, when used as a vaccine adjuvant, IL28B could significantly decrease splenic regulatory T cells, increase splenic and peripheral blood CD8+ T cells, and lead to increased antigen-specific perforin induction and degranulation[30]. These adaptive immune responses might be more important in HCV infection[15]. Therefore, IL28B plays a more important role in the infection of HCV than that of HBV.",

            "text": "Chronic hepatitis B progresses at unequal rates between males and females, being more frequent in men than in women[31]. This sexual dimorphism might be due to lower expression of estrogen and a reduced response to the action of estrogen[32]. Furthermore, It was reported that estrogen could directly activate the promoter of IFN-\u03b3 and this effect was mediated by estrogen receptors (ERs, ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2)[16]. The production and function of ER might be influenced by its own variation, and thus influence the diverse pathologies of chronic hepatopathy[17],[18]. According to our findings, compared to CT+TT, ER\u03b1 rs2077647 CC genotype might play a role in protecting individuals against HBV persistence, since the risk of persistent HBV infection was reduced to 0.289 (95% CI, [0.187, 0.446]; P < 0.001). However, ER\u03b1 rs2077647 T/C is a synonymous polymorphism located in exon 1, and Zhai et al.[22] investigated that such effect could be caused by some other functional polymorphisms (such as a [TA]n repeat and a PvuII RFLP) in LD with rs2077647 T/C. Thus, to date, the potential function of rs2077647 T/C could not be confirmed, and further investigation was required to explore the exact mechanism and association of ER\u03b1 polymorphisms with outcomes of HBV infection.",

Firstly, due to the limited availability of published results, the number of studies included in each meta-analysis was small. We expected that as more studies become available, an accurate estimation of the relationship of the 3 SNPs with susceptibility and clearance to persistence HBV infection would be obtained. Secondly, several comparison models were found to have heterogeneities, and the genotype distribution also showed deviation from HWE in four studies. These could be attributed to ethnic differences (Asian versus non-Asian descent), potential selection bias (in-patients versus outpatients) or other factors. The third limitation of this analysis is that we did not have original data for all studies to account for other factors, like presence of co-infection with HIV or immune deficiency, genotypes of HBV and transmission modality that may modify the risk estimates. In spite of these, meta-analysis is a powerful statistical tool to summarize inconsistent results from different studies, so our meta-analysis provided more convincing conclusions.",
