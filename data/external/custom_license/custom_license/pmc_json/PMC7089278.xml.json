Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), the first coronavirus to be discovered, is the etiological agent of infectious bronchitis and responsible for large economic losses in the poultry industry. IBV replicates primarily in the respiratory tract and also in some epithelial cells of the gut, kidney, and oviduct, causing different clinical symptoms, such as respiratory distress, decrease in egg production, and quality in layers. Some IBV strains are associated with nephritis due to its tissue tropism [3\u20137].",

More than 20 IBV serotypes have been identified worldwide, which might emerge due to gene deletion, gene substitution, gene insertion, and/or RNA recombination of the S1 subunit [9, 10]. The emergence of many IBV serotypes is a major problem in the poultry industry, which causes high disease incidence and production losses due to infections with strains serologically different from the vaccine strains [11, 12]. In recent years, it is believing that avian coronavirus has a wider host range than it was previously thought, not only in galliform (chicken-like) birds (peafowl), but also in non-galliform birds (teal or duck species) [13].",

            "text": "IBV is a member of the family Coronaviridae [15], which consists of several enveloped viruses. It replicates in the cell cytoplasm and contains an unsegmented, single-stranded, and positive-sense RNA of approximately 27\u201332 kb. IBV has four structural proteins (S, E, M, and N): the spike (S) glycoprotein, the small envelope (E) protein, the membrane (M) glycoprotein, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein [16, 17], which are encoded by subgenomic mRNAs (sgRNAs) 2, 3,4, and 6, respectively [18, 19]. The structural genes, together with other open reading frames (ORFs), organize the typical avian coronavirus genome characterized by the order 5\u2032-ORF1a-ORF1b-S-3a-3b-E-M-5a-5b-N-UTR-3\u2032 [18, 20]. It is commonly accepted that the IBV serotype is determined by the S gene, particularly the hypervariable S1 subunit. Moreover, previous reports have shown that the host range can be determined by the surface spike glycoprotein (S). For example, a genetically manipulated murine coronavirus with the S protein of feline coronavirus replicates in feline cells [21]. Though the M protein, a polytopic membrane protein, is the most abundant component of coronavirions, it is required in virus assembly and budding, and involved in virion morphogenesis. For the identification and clinical signs of pathogenic viruses, proper protein genes in the viral genome are needed to be selected for phylogenetic analysis, due to the presence of large mutations in the highly variable regions.",

Currently, the serotypes, including Mass, T, Holte, and Gray, were prevalent in China and there were also other variants. However, IBV outbreak remains common and continues to cause large economic losses in the poultry industry, despite intensive vaccination policies, due to gene mutations and gene re-combinations. Since the first IBV isolate was found in China, the inactivated oil emulsion and live attenuated vaccines used with different strains (such as H120, H52, Ma5, W93, and M41) have been used to prevent and control the disease. Moreover, most of the currently used commercial vaccines, such as H120, H52, and M41, belonged to the Mass type. In 2004, a virulent IBV strain was isolated in 30-day-old ducks reared with broilers vaccinated with H120 and M41 in the Henan Province of central China. A novel coronavirus, ZZ2004 virus, fulfilling all of Koch\u2019s postulates, was announced to be the primary etiological agent of ducks on September 22, 2012 by Xingyou Liu (patent in Chinese NO. ZL201010225577.4). To further reveal the nature of the virus, it was identified by virus isolation, virus neutralization test, RT-PCR, sequence alignment, and phylogenetic analysis. The results indicated that the isolate was genetically different from most of the prevalent strains of IBV found in China.",

IBV is therefore a very important pathogen in the poultry industry. It is widely prevalent in China and brings large economic losses for farmers. It is challenging to eradicate by routine vaccination due to the emergence of viral variants. In this study, 15 specimens were taken from a duck flock reared together with chickens that had been subjected to a full vaccination program of both live and inactivated IB vaccines in Henan province, China, in 2004, as part of a wider animal surveillance program for identifying potential reservoirs of animal coronaviruses. The duck flock showed growth retardation and no appetite after chickens reared in the same farm displayed severe respiratory signs and diarrhea. Embryo dwarfing and curling was observed during virus isolation, and the results of the RT-PCR assay based on the highly variable S1 subunit and conserved M genes of IBV found that individual samples from the above ducks were coronavirus-positive. These results therefore added ducks to the list of avian species known to be susceptible to coronavirus infection.",

This serotype is genetically and antigenically distinct from all other known IBV strains. We propose to call the new genotype and serotype ZZ2004, according to the location where the field virus was found. In the future, it will be important to compare the pathogenicity of ZZ2004 with other circulating IBV strains and to test its complete genome.",
