First, it demonstrates that coronaviruses are capable of causing fatal diseases in humans. Second, the identification of bats as the reservoir for SARS-related coronaviruses, and the fact that SARS-CoV3\u201310 probably originated in bats, firmly establishes that bats are an important source of highly lethal zoonotic viruses, such as Hendra, Nipah, Ebola and Marburg viruses16.",

Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV, a coronavirus) had caused prior outbreaks at this farm, and was detected in the intestines of deceased piglets at the start of the outbreak. However, PEDV could no longer be detected in deceased piglets after 12 January 2017, despite accelerating mortality (Fig. 1a), and extensive testing for other common swine viruses yielded no results (Extended Data Table 1). These findings suggested that this was an outbreak of a novel disease. Clinical signs are similar to those caused by other known swine enteric coronaviruses17, 18 and include severe and acute diarrhoea and acute vomiting, leading to death due to rapid weight loss in newborn piglets that are less than five days of age. Infected piglets died 2\u20136 days after disease onset, whereas infected sows suffered only mild diarrhoea and most sows recovered within two days. The disease caused no signs of febrile illness in piglets or sows. The mortality rate was as high as 90% in piglets that were five days or younger, whereas in piglets that were older than eight days, the mortality dropped to 5%. Subsequently, SADS-related outbreaks were found in three additional pig farms within 20\u2013150 km of the index farm (Extended Data Fig. 1a) and, by 2 May 2017, the disease had caused the death of 24,693 piglets at these four farms (Fig. 1a). In farm A alone, 64% (4,659 out of 7,268) of all piglets that were born in February died. The outbreak has abated, and measures that were taken to control SADS included separation of sick sows and piglets from the rest of the herd. A qPCR test described below was used as the main diagnostic tool to confirm SADS-CoV infection.\n",

The virus replicated to higher titres in piglets than in sows (Fig. 1b). SADS-CoV displayed tissue tropism of the small intestine (Fig. 1c), as observed for other swine enteric coronaviruses20. Retrospective PCR analysis revealed that SADS-CoV was present on farm A during the PEDV epidemic, where the first strongly positive SADS-CoV sample was detected on 6 December 2016. From mid-January onwards, SADS-CoV was the dominant viral agent detected in diseased animals (Extended Data Fig. 1b). It is possible that the presence of PEDV early in the SADS-CoV outbreak may have somehow facilitated or enhanced spillover and amplification of SADS. However the fact that the vast majority of piglet mortality occurred after PEDV infection had become undetectable suggests that SADS-CoV itself causes a lethal infection in pigs that was responsible for these large-scale outbreaks, and that PEDV does not directly contribute to its severity in individual pigs. This was supported by the absence of PEDV and other known swine diarrhoea viruses during the peak and later phases of the SADS outbreaks in the four farms (Extended Data Table 1).",

To test this hypothesis, we developed a SADS-CoV-specific qPCR assay based on its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene (Supplementary Table 2) and screened 591 bat anal swabs collected between 2013 and 2016 from seven different locations in Guangdong province (Extended Data Fig. 1a). A total of 58 samples (9.8%) tested positive (Extended Data Table 2), all were from Rhinolophus spp. bats that are also the natural reservoir hosts of SARS-related coronaviruses3\u201310. Four complete genome sequences with the highest RdRp PCR-fragment sequence identity to that of SADS-CoV were determined by NGS. They are very similar in size (27.2 kb) compared to SADS-CoV (Fig. 2a) and we tentatively call them SADS-related coronaviruses (SADSr-CoV). Overall sequence identity between SADSr-CoV and SADS-CoV ranges from 96 to 98%. Most importantly, the S protein of SADS-CoV shared more than 98% sequence identity with sequences of two of the SADSr-CoVs (samples 162149 and 141388), compared to 86% with HKU2-CoV. The major sequence differences among the four SADSr-CoV genomes were found in the predicted coding regions of the S and NS7a and NS7b genes (Fig. 2a). In addition, the coding region of the S protein N-terminal (S1) domain was determined from 19 bat SADSr-CoVs to enable more detailed phylogenetic analysis.\n",

Both phylogenetic and haplotype network analyses demonstrated that the viruses from the four farms probably originated from their reservoir hosts independently (Extended Data Fig. 3), and that a few viruses might have undergone further genetic recombination (Extended Data Fig. 4). However, molecular clock analysis of the 33 SADS-CoV genome sequences failed to establish a positive association between sequence divergence and sampling date.

The first challenge experiment was conducted with specific pathogen-free piglets that were infected with a tissue homogenate of SADS-CoV-positive intestines. Two days after infection, 3 out of 7 animals died in the challenge group whereas 4 out of 5 survived in the control group. Incidentally, the one piglet that died in the control group was the only individual that did not receive colostrum due to a shortage in the supply. It is thus highly likely that lack of nursing and inability to access colostrum was responsible for the death (Extended Data Table 4). For the second challenge, healthy piglets were acquired from a farm in Guangdong that had been free of diarrheal disease for a number of weeks before the experiment, and were infected with the cultured isolate of SADS-CoV or tissue-culture medium as control. Of those inoculated with SADS-CoV, 50% (3 out of 6) died between 2 and 4 days after infection, whereas all control animals survived (Extended Data Table 5). All animals in the infected group suffered watery diarrhoea, rapid weight loss and intestinal lesions (determined after euthanasia upon experiment termination, Extended Data Tables 4, 5). Histopathological examination revealed marked villus atrophy in SADS-CoV inoculated farm piglets four days after inoculation but not in control piglets (Fig. 3a, b) and viral N protein-specific staining was observed mainly in small intestine epithelial cells of the inoculated piglets (Fig. 3c, d).\n",

For DNA virus screening, NEBNext Fast DNA Fragmentation & Library Prep Set for Ion Torrent (New England Biolabs) was used for library preparation. Both libraries were sequenced on an Ion S5 sequencer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). An analysis pipeline was applied to the sequencing data, which included the following analysis steps: (1) raw data quality filtering; (2) host genomic sequence filtering; (3) BLASTn search against the virus nucleotide database using BLAST; (4) BLASTx search against the virus protein database using DIAMOND v.0.9.0; (5) contig assembling and BLASTx search against the virus protein database. For whole viral genome sequencing, amplicon primers (provided upon request) were designed using the Thermo Fisher Scientific online tool with the HKU2-CoV and the SADS-CoV farm A genomes as references, and the sequencing libraries were constructed using NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina and sequenced on an MiSeq sequencer. PCR and Sanger sequencing was performed to fill gaps in the genome. Genome sequences were assembled using CLC Genomic Workbench v.9.0. 5\u2032-RACE was performed to determine the 5\u2032-end of the genomes using SMARTer RACE 5\u2032/3\u2032 Kit (Takara).

In the first experiment, which was conducted before the virus was isolated, we used three-day old specific pathogen-free (SPF) piglets of the same breeding line, cared for at a SPF facility, fed with colostrum (except one). These piglets were bred and reared to be free of PEDV, CSFV, SIV, PCV2 and PPV infections, and were routinely tested for viral infections using PCR. We also conducted NGS to further confirm that these were animals were free of infection of the above viruses before the animal experiment, and to demonstrate that the animals were free of SADS-CoV infection. The intestinal tissue samples from healthy and diseased animals (intestinal samples excised from euthanized piglets, then ground to make slurry for the inoculum and NGS was performed to confirm no other pig pathogens were found in the samples), were used to feed two groups of 5 (control) and 7 (infection) animals, respectively. For the second experiment, isolated SADS-CoV was used to infect healthy piglets from a farm in Guangdong, which had been free of diarrheal disease for a number of weeks. These piglets were from the same breed as those on SADS-affected farms, to eliminate potential host factor differences and to more accurately reproduce the conditions that occurred during the outbreak in the region. Both groups of piglets were cared for at a known pig disease-free facility. Again, qPCR and NGS were used to make sure that there was no other known swine diarrhoea virus present in the virus inoculum or any of the experimental animals. Two groups (6 for each group) of three-day old piglets were inoculated with SADS-CoV culture supernatant or normal cell culture medium as control. NGS and qPCR were used to confirm that there were no other known swine pathogens in the inoculum.",

It is important to point out that piglets when they are three days old tend to suffer from diarrhoea and weight loss when they are taken away from sows and the natural breast-feeding environment even without infection.
