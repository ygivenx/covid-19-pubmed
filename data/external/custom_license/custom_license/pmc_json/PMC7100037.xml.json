Also intestinal mucin-type glycoprotein 1 and 2 have been identified as receptors for F4ac,9, 10 but these have not been reported to initiate endocytosis or induction of a mucosal immune response, and are therefore unlikely to be F4acRs involved in transcytosis and induction of mucosal immunity.",

Pigs were orally given anti-APN rabbit immunoglobulin (Ig) G (anti-APN group) or an equal amount of IgG purified from irrelevant rabbit serum (IgG group), or with anti-APN IgG or IgG from irrelevant rabbit serum adjuvanted with cholera toxin (CT) (anti-APN+CT group and IgG+CT group, respectively). Although serum IgA, IgG, and IgM directed against rabbit IgG only appeared 13 dppi (days post-primary immunization) in the IgG group, a serum IgG, IgA, and IgM response could be observed as soon as 7 dppi with anti-APN. This response reached a maximum 13 dppi (mean IgG, IgA, IgM titers of 320, 113, and 23, respectively, compared with mean IgG, IgA, IgM titers of 44, 11, and 17, respectively, in the IgG group), and was only slightly boosted by a secondary immunization. Furthermore, the serum antibody response in the IgG group remained lower than in the anti-APN group during the course of the experiment. Addition of CT (IgG+CT group) increased the IgA, IgG, and IgM response in animals immunized with control IgG to similar titers as observed in the anti-APN group, whereas addition of CT to anti-APN further increased IgA and IgG titers at least threefold from day 13 onwards, resulting in significantly higher IgA and IgG titers on days 13, 20, and 27 and significantly higher IgM titers on day 20 in the anti-APN+CT group compared with the IgG group. Significant differences between the other groups were not observed (Figure 8).",

Our finding that binding of F4ac to BBMVs depends on glycosylation is in line with earlier reports that binding of F4 fimbriae to the F4R is dependent on the presence of a carbohydrate structure.10 Treatment of BBMVs with neuraminidase from A. urefaciens reduced binding of F4, leaving a possible role for \u03b12-3,6,8 sialic acid linkages. Enzymatic removal of all N-linked glycans on the BBMVs using N-glycosidase F also reduced the binding of F4ac, whereas exclusive removal of non-sialylated N-linked glycans of the high-mannose type with endoglycosidase-H had no effect. These results suggest that F4ac is a sialic acid-binding lectin and that interactions between sialic acid residues on pAPN and F4ac fimbriae are essential for binding.",

            "text": "Another important issue was whether pAPN has a role in endocytosis of F4ac, which could be an important factor in the reported ability of F4ac to transcytose small intestinal enterocytes and to induce a mucosal immune response.6, 8 We recently demonstrated that F4ac fimbriae are internalized in the porcine epithelial cell line IPECJ2 via clathrin-mediated endocytosis. However, we were unable to detect APN expression on the surface of IPECJ2 cells using monoclonal or polyclonal APN-specific antibodies (unpublished data), suggesting that APN expression is below the detection limit using these antibodies or that other receptors are involved in endocytosis of F4 in this in vitro system. Therefore, we performed experiments with pAPN-transfected BHK-21 cells to evaluate the role of APN in endocytosis of F4ac fimbriae. A role for APN in endocytosis was supported by the inhibitory effect of bestatin, an APN inhibitor, on endocytosis of F4 in pAPN-transfected BHK-21 cells. During several steps of ligand-induced endocytosis of cellular receptors, microtubules, actin, and clathrin are of critical importance.17, 18, 19 Experiments with chemical inhibitors and pAPN-transfected BHK-21 cells confirmed the importance of these structural proteins in pAPN-mediated internalization of F4ac. The importance of clathrin during the early phases of F4ac internalization was shown by inhibition of clathrin-coated pit invagination at the plasma membrane using amantadine-HCl. In addition, inhibition of clathrin-coated vesicle budding using cytochalasin D also resulted in a strong decrease in F4ac internalization. Furthermore, colocalization of vesicles containing F4ac and clathrin could be observed during F4 internalization. Similarly, endocytosis of gonococci-expressing galactose-terminating lipooligosaccharide that binds to the human asialoglycoprotein receptor occurs through clathrin-dependent receptor-mediated endocytosis.21 Other bacterial pathogens, such as Chlamydia species,22, 23, 24\nCampylobacter jejuni, and Citrobacter freundii,25 some strains of enterohemorrhagic E. coli26 and Staphylococcus aureus27 have also been found to invade host cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis in a clathrin-dependent matter.",

This immune response requires the presence of the F4R as oral immunization of F4R\u2212 piglets with F4 fimbriae does not result in the induction of an F4-specific mucosal immune response.6 F4 strongly adheres to the villous epithelium and the follicle-associated epithelium of the jejunum and ileum of F4R+ pigs and is endocytosed by villous enterocytes, follicle-associated enterocytes, and M cells.8 Intestinal mucin-type glycoprotein 1 and 2 have been identified as receptors for F4ac,9, 10 but there are no indications that these would be involved in endocytosis and mucosal immunity against F4 fimbriae. Here, we demonstrate that pAPN serves as an F4acR and does lead to F4 internalization. An additional indication for the involvement of pAPN in the oral immunogenicity of F4 comes from our observation that antibodies against APN, which also adhere to and are taken up by enterocytes, elicited a strong immune response. Even in the absence of an adjuvant, strong serum IgA, IgG, and IgM responses could be observed after primary immunization, indicating that APN may represent a promising target for oral delivery of antigens across the epithelial barrier. Although much weaker than observed with APN-specific antibodies, irrelevant rabbit antibodies also interacted with enterocytes and induced a weak serum antibody response. This might be explained by the fact that the neonatal receptor for IgG, FcRn, is expressed on porcine intestinal epithelium throughout lifetime and is in line with another study demonstrating that orally delivered bovine IgG to pigs was transferred into the blood supply.31 In conclusion, we identified APN as a novel F4 receptor. APN is expressed on the small intestinal brush border and is involved in the adhesion of F4ac+ ETEC, to the intestinal epithelium. The interaction between F4 fimbriae and APN critically depends on the presence of sialic acid containing carbohydrate structures and binding of F4 fimbriae to APN results in clathrin-mediated endocytosis of the fimbriae. The fact that APN is present on the intestinal epithelium of many animal species, makes this molecule an interesting candidate for the selective targeting of vaccine antigens towards the mucosal epithelium.",

(a1) The brush border membrane vesicles (BBMVs) of F4 receptor (F4R)\u2212 (lanes 1 and 2) and F4R+ pigs (lanes 3 and 4) were treated with neuraminidase (lanes 2 and 4). Untreated samples were run on lanes 1 and 3. The positions of the molecular weight marker (M, kDa) are indicated. (a2) The BBMVs of F4R+ (lanes 1 and 2) and F4R\u2212 pigs (lanes 3 and 4) were treated with PNGaseF (lanes 2 and 4). Untreated samples were run on lanes 1 and 3. (a3) The BBMVs of an F4R+ pig were treated with endoglycosidase H (EndoH; lane 2), an untreated sample was run on lane 1. (b) As a positive control, fetuin was treated with neuraminidase ((b1), lane 1) and RNaseB was treated with PNGaseF (b2, lane 2) or with EndoH (b3, lane 2), and a Coomassie staining was performed to observe if a gel shift occurred compared with the untreated samples (b1, lane 2; b2, lane 1; and b3, lane 1). \nPowerPoint slide\n",
