In addition, assessment of the PE reads\nwas performed by average quality score per base position, using FastQC (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). Trimmed reads\nwere aligned in paired-end mode to the GRCh37 human genome assembly using Burrows-Wheeler\nAlignment tool (v0.7.12, parameters: bwa mem)24 .\nThe switch region of the IgH locus was defined on GRCh37, with the following coordinates:\nchr14:106050000-106337000. To find insertions in the IgH switch region locus, we selected\ngenomic ranges when sequence coverage was above 2 reads and/or above 40 reads, thus,\ngenerating two respective and separated workflows, with a sequence length comprises\nbetween 50 bp and 2000 bp. Genome coverage was processed by Bedtools (http://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html, v2.26.0) and a\ndedicated python script using pysam (https://github.com/pysam-developers/pysam) was written to identify potential\ninsert. Briefly, in both workflows (2 and 40 reads), potential inserts were assigned if\nthey fulfilled the following criteria: (i) one mapping read in 5\u2019 end is chimeric\nwith the switch region (ii) one mapping read in 3\u2019 end is chimeric with the switch\nregion (iii) two discordant reads have their mates read mapped in the switch region.\nAfterwards, inserts coming from 2 and 40 minimum reads coverage were merged according to\nthe following rule: if the difference between two inserts that overlap was equal or below\n10 bp, we kept the shortest one, otherwise the longest one is kept. The list of potential\ninserts was annotated using GENCODE v1925 and\nBEDOPS tools26 and individually validated by a\nde novo assembly of the contig sequence. Non-chimeric, but properly\npaired reads mapping the insert coordinates and chimeric reads corresponding to the\nencompassing mate pairs and spanning mate pairs, were extracted using SAMtools27. Reads mapping to the switch region were extracted\nonly if they were spanning mate pairs related to the insert coordinates. Selected reads\nwere uniquely mapped to the region of interest (no XA tag), with a minimum mapping quality\nof 5. Original reads sequences were retrieved, pull together and used as input files to\nperform a de novo assembly using the Trinity software28. Finally, to validate a contig sequence for each\ninsert, we used BLAST29 (command-line version,\nv2.5.0+). The consensus insert sequences were \u201cblasted\u201d against the switch\nregion and we removed the inserts that had an alignment with at least half of their\nsequence length at a minimum 80 % identity (parameters: -task megablast -dust no\n-perc_identity 80). Then, we blasted each contig sequence against the switch region\nsequence and the consensus insert sequence (parameters: -task blastn -dust no\n-perc_identity 70) to confirm if the contig was made of the complete insert sequence and\nif the contig contained two flanking sequences of at least 50bp that matched the switch\nregion. The shortest contig that fulfilled the criteria mentioned above was selected for\neach insert.",
