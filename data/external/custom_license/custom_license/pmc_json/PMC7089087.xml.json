This possibility may prevent researchers and animal owners from achieving a better understanding of the damage caused collectively by these agents in milk-feeding calves aged only a few days, which motivated this research. For this reason, the present study aimed to verify the prevalence and risk factors for agents causing diarrhea (Coronavirus, Rotavirus, Cryptosporidium spp., Eimeria spp., and gastrointestinal nematodes) in dairy calves from Brazil. In addition, the age with higher risk for occurrence of each agent was verified utilizing the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.",

These states were chosen because they represent 80% of Brazil\u2019s total milk production (IBGE 2017). Initially, 872 farms located in these states were contacted, and only 195 did not administer any vaccine or specific drug against the five agents involved in this study. Among these 195 farms, 39 farms (20%) belonging to 29 municipalities were randomly chosen for conducting the study. In some states, such as Minas Gerais, several farms were selected, while in others, such as Goi\u00e1s, only one or two were selected. On these 39 farms, fecal samples were collected from 868 female calves. Samples were obtained from animals aged between 1 and 135 days, all of which were consuming milk. All these samples were collected directly from the rectum of animals and, after individual identification (using the animal\u2019s ID number), were stored in isothermal containers filled with ice. The samples were subsequently sent to the Veterinary Parasitology Center of the Veterinary and Animal Husbandry School, Federal University of Goi\u00e1s (Centro de Parasitologia Veterin\u00e1ria da Escola de Veterin\u00e1ria e Zootecnia da Universidade Federal de Goi\u00e1s, EVZ/UFG), for processing.",

The RNA of enteric viruses in fecal samples was investigated by molecular techniques, such as reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and semi-nested PCR (SN-PCR), for partial amplification of the BCoV N gene (Takiuchi et al. 2006), bovine RVAVP4 and VP7 genes (Gentsch et al. 1992; Gouvea et al. 1990), bovine rotavirus B (RVB) NSP2 gene (Gouvea et al. 1991), and bovine rotavirus C (RVC) VP6 gene (Alfieri et al. 1999). The RT-PCR was performed using the oligonucleotide primers upstream 5\u2032-GCCGATCAGTCCGACCAATC-3\u2032(nt79\u201398) and downstream 5\u2032-AGAATGTCAGCCGGGGTAT-3\u2032(nt 467\u2013485) that amplify a 407 base pair (bp) fragment of the N gene of BCoV. The technique was carried out as described by Tsunemitsu et al. (1999). The reverse transcriptase reaction was conducted as follows. In the tube, 10 \u03bcl of RNA sample was added to 2 \u03bcl of the downstream primer (50 pmol). The tube was incubated at 100 \u00b0C for 2 min and then quenched on ice for 5 min. Subsequently, 4 \u03bcl of 5 \u00d7 RT buffer [250 mM tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 375 mM KCl, 15 mM MgCl2], 1 \u03bcl of 0.1 M dithiothreitol, 2 \u03bcl of 10 mM dNTPs, 0.5 \u03bcl of RNAsin (Promega Corporation), and 0.5 \u03bcl of AMV RT (Promega Corporation) were added and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 60 min. Then 10 \u03bcl of the RT reaction samples was added to 40 \u03bcl of the PCR mixture.

In this case, coinfections with Rotavirus and Coronavirus were detected in 3% of all calves. Although these two viral agents were observed simultaneously in animals, it was not possible to determine the occurrence of one agent that was a risk factor for the appearance of either agent (P > 0.05). This possibility was confirmed in the present work, as it is possible to observe that these agents appear in different periods and ages, as previously described. Feitosa et al. (2008), analyzing the importance of Cryptosporidium spp. as a cause of diarrhea in calves, verified a peak of occurrence in 15-day-old animals and observed that all samples positive for this protozoan were also positive for Coronavirus and Rotavirus. In the present study, which analyzed all of these enteropathogenic agents together, it is possible to verify that Rotavirus was a risk factor for the occurrence of Cryptosporidium spp., and this protozoan also showed a significant positive correlation with Coronavirus, with these three agents triggering diarrhea in animals. However, when analyzing specificity and sensitivity to detect an agent obtained by the ROC curve, it is possible to determine that there were interactions between Cryptosporidium spp. and Coronavirus from the 6th to the 10th day of age, as well as interactions between Cryptosporidium spp. and Rotavirus from the 7th to 21st day of age, with peaks of diarrhea being observed in animals at the 15th day of life, as observed by Feitosa et al. (2008), only for Cryptosporidium spp. The results of this study indicate that the diarrhea affecting calves between 6 and 10 days of life occurs mainly by Coronavirus and Cryptosporium, whereas the diarrhea described in calves at 10 to 21 days of age occurs mainly by Cryptosporidium and Rotavirus. The results obtained in this work demonstrate the importance of conducting studies involving several enteropathogenic agents together in calves of different ages.",

In the study by these researchers, the use of halofuginone lactate for preventing cryptosporidiosis in naturally infected neonatal calves was investigated on a dairy farm with a high prevalence of infection, where animals were kept in two different calf rearing systems. These researchers reported that halofuginone lactate use combined with good hygiene measures, such as rearing animals in clean individual pens, was the most effective method to reduce cryptosporidiosis risk among 7\u201313-day-old calves when comparing these calves with animals bred in collective pens. The latter had easier access to excrement from other calves in comparison with calves reared in isolated housing or tied with chains.

When water originated from rivers, streams, and ponds, bovines presented 7.931 times higher probability of being infected by Eimeria spp. compared with animals that received water from artesian wells (P < 0.0001). The previously mentioned research of consecutive outbreaks by E. zuernii in calves, published by Cruvinel et al. (2018b), also describes such similarity, indicating that water from rivers, streams, and ponds is more easily contaminated by feces/oocysts of Eimeria spp. than water from artesian wells. In addition, calves infected with Eimeria spp. were 18.62 times more likely to be infected with gastrointestinal nematodes (P < 0.0001). These results demonstrate the importance of conducting future studies to determine the true impact that these two parasites can trigger together in infected animals.",

The ages with the highest probabilities of occurrence of such diseases are < 10, > 8, > 6, > 37, and > 36 days old, respectively. There is a positive correlation (P \u2264 0.05) between Coronavirus, Rotavirus, Cryptosporidium spp., and diarrhea. In addition, diarrhea occurs more significantly (P < 0.0001) in bovines less than 21 days old and mainly in those that received milk through automatic feeders (P < 0.001). Cryptosporidium spp. and Rotavirus are risk factors for each other\u2019s occurrence (P = 0.0039), and the former also presents a positive correlation with Coronavirus (P = 0.0089). In addition, calves bred in compost barns are more easily infected by Cryptosporidium spp. than those that are raised in isolated housing or tied to chains (P = 0.0273). Young bovines that drink water from rivers, streams, and ponds have a higher chance of being infected by Eimeria spp. (P < 0.0001) and gastrointestinal nematodes (P < 0.0001). The presence of diarrhea in calves was not significantly correlated (P > 0.05) with the presence of Eimeria spp. and gastrointestinal nematodes in animals.",
