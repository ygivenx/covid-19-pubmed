Normal mammalian cells are found to be resistant to NDV replication, while oncolytic NDV can selectively replicate in tumor cells and induce apoptosis in late stages of infection [1]. However, in the initial phase of infection, NDV must prevent the rapid elimination of tumor cells to ensure its own survival and propagation. To date, the mechanisms that underlie the interaction between NDV and target cells in early stages of infection remain largely unclear.",

The hallmark of autophagy is a double-membraned autophagosome that engulfs bulk cytoplasm and cytoplasmic organelles [3]. Autophagosomes fuse ultimately with lysosomes, thereby generating single-membraned autophagolysosomes and degrading their contents [4]. During autophagy, LC3 (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3) is converted to lipidated LC3II and associates with the autophagic membrane. The punctuate distribution of LC3 upon lipidation is characteristic and serves as a marker for autophagy [5], while the LC3II/actin ratio correlates well with the number of autophagosomes [6]. A multifunctional protein p62 (SQSTM1) interacts with LC3II and is specifically degraded by the autophagic-lysosome pathway [6].",

The molecular pathways that regulate autophagy have been investigated extensively. A critical positive regulator of autophagy is the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3KC3), whose activity in promoting autophagy depends on its association with a multi-protein complex that contains the essential mammalian autophagy protein Beclin-1 (homologue of yeast Atg6) [7]. Two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems are required for the formation of autophagosomes, in which several Atg genes including Atg5 are involved. Autophagy may also be negatively regulated by the serine/threonine kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) [8, 9]. Other negative regulators of autophagy include the class I PI3K/Akt pathway, which controls autophagy via its downstream regulator mTOR.",

It has been demonstrated that some viruses, such as herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and cytomegalovirus, have evolved mechanisms to suppress autophagy and, in the case of HSV-1, this increases its own survival [11, 12]. In contrast, several single-stranded RNA viruses, such as poliovirus, coronavirus and dengue virus, exploit the elements of the autophagy system to benefit their own replication [13\u201315]. So far, several members of the family Paramyxoviridae have been shown to induce autophagy in target cells [16, 17].

The cells were examined subsequently by standard transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As depicted in Fig. 1A, mock-infected cells showed a normal distribution of organelles (Fig. 1A, a), while some infected cells were highly vacuolated and showed disappearance of most organelles (Fig. 1A, b). In some infected cells, cup-shaped membranous structures were observed wrapping around mitochondria in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1A, c). An autophagosome, or initial autophagic vacuole, containing a mitochondrion and other organelles, can be seen fusing with a lysosome to form a single-membraned vacuole (Fig. 1A, d). These observations indicate that ultrastructural features similar to autophagosomes were formed during NDV infection.\n",

In addition, upon NDV infection, elevated phosphorylation of p70S6K, a downstream effector of mTOR signaling, was also detected with a time dependence similar to that of mTOR phosphorylation (Fig. 2). It is known that mTOR is one of the downstream effectors of the class I PI3K/Akt signaling pathways and that Akt signaling has been shown previously to be involved in the induction of autophagy in malignant glioma cells [23]. We examined Akt phosphorylation at different time points after NDV infection. As shown in Fig. 2, increased phosphorylation of Akt was observed in NDV-infected cells until 24 hpi. Together, these data suggested that the class I PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway was activated during NDV infection and may not contribute to NDV-triggered autophagy.\n",

U251 cells infected with NDV were mock treated or treated with the autophagy inducer rapamycin, or the autophagy inhibitor CQ, at the concentrations used in previous studies [26\u201329]. The two compounds had no effect on cell viability at the concentrations used in this study (data not shown). As can be seen in Fig. 3A, the production of LC3II was increased at 24 and 48 hpi in NDV-infected cells treated with rapamycin. CQ inhibits autophagy at a late stage by preventing the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes and thus increasing the cellular burden of autophagosomes [30, 31]. Because LC3II is an essential element in the formation of the autophagosome, the inhibition of autophagy by CQ results in the marked accumulation of LC3II [32, 33]. Figure 3B shows that CQ induced a moderate increase in LC3II in infected cells, indicating that CQ treatment blocks the fusion of the NDV-induced autophagosomes with lysosomes. Overall, these results indicated that rapamycin exerts an enhanced effect on NDV-induced autophagy, whereas CQ inhibits NDV-induced autophagy.\n",

            "text": "Members of the family Paramyxoviridae have been shown to induce autophagy in target cells. It has been reported that the parainfluenza virus simian virus 5 activates plasmacytoid dendritic cells through the autophagy pathway [16], while measles virus induces autophagy in HeLa cells through a pathway mediated by CD46 [17]. However, it remains unclear whether autophagy is triggered upon NDV infection. In the current study, we demonstrated that, shortly after infection, NDV triggers autophagy in U251 glioma cells. By means of fluorescence and electron microscopy, several hallmarks of autophagy, including the formation of autophagosomes and GFP-LC3 dot formation, were observed in U251 cells upon NDV infection (Fig. 1A and B). These observations were attested further by the increased production of LC3II (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, decreased levels of p62 at 24 h and 48 h after NDV infection correlate well with LC3II production, indicating that a complete autophagic response was induced upon NDV infection. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that autophagy is induced and is a part of the cellular response during NDV infection. Further studies will be carried out to examine whether autophagy is induced in other cell lines upon NDV infection.",

So far, the mechanisms that participate in paramyxovirus-induced autophagy remain largely unknown. In this report, we showed that Beclin-1 expression was induced at early stages of NDV infection, which correlates well with the increased production of LC3II, indicating a potential role of the class III PI3K/Beclin-1 pathway in NDV-triggered autophagy. In contrast, we observed increased phosphorylation of Akt, mTOR and p70S6K in NDV-infected U251 cells, suggesting that NDV-induced autophagy is not triggered by the class I PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Therefore, the class III PI3K/Beclin-1 pathway plays a crucial role in NDV-induced autophagy.",

            "text": "Although autophagy is known to be a cellular defense against viral infection, induction of autophagy has been shown to be beneficial for the replication of a few RNA viruses, including poliovirus [35], dengue virus [14] and coxsackievirus [36]. In this report, we show that manipulation of the autophagic induction in NDV-infected U251 cells by pharmacological compounds or target-specific RNA interference resulted in significant alterations in virus replication. CQ treatment decreased virus production 24 and 48 h after NDV infection, while elevated virus production by rapamycin treatment was detected at 24 and 48 hpi. Interestingly, the effect on virus yield by CQ or rapamycin correlates well with their diverse effects on NDV-induced autophagy. Together, our data suggest that autophagy plays a critical role in virus production in NDV-infected cells. This notion is supported further by results from siRNA manipulations targeting ATG5 or Beclin-1 in U251 cells. The ATG5 protein is essential for the formation of the autophagosomal membrane, while Beclin-1 is necessary for cellular autophagy. A previous study has shown that ATG5 is necessary for the delivery of Sendai virus genetic material from the cytoplasm into endosomes, where the ssRNA sensor Toll-like receptor 7 resides [37]. The suppression of either of the two autophagic molecules in NDV-infected U251 cells resulted in the reduction of virus yield when compared with control. Together, these data indicate that autophagy is likely to be utilized by NDV to facilitate its own production. Of note, although several negative-stranded RNA viruses have been shown to induce autophagy, the relationship between autophagy and virus replication is poorly understood. Thus, our data will increase understanding of the role of autophagy in negative-stranded RNA virus replication.",
