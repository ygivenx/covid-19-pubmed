Those products have been used in the treatment of patients at more than 50 hospitals in Indonesia. In 2004, these tissue Banks produced 8,542 grafts and 5,000 of them were amnion grafts for eye treatment, as well as for wound dressing. All of those grafts were used for patients as well as for researches. In 2006, the production increase up to 9,000 grafts. Although the capacity of those banks can produce more grafts but we are facing problems to get raw materials from suitable donors.
