Generally, native pAPN is a mixed protein which consists of the full-length pAPN protein (aa 1\u2013963, 150 kDa), the B subunit of pAPN (aa 1\u2013572, 95 kDa) and the C subunit of pAPN (aa 573\u2013963, 50 kDa), because of trypsin cleavage at the potential site Arg572 of the pAPN molecule (Delmas et al. 1994). In the full-length pAPN, the TGEV binding site is mainly located in the C subunit of pAPN (pAPN-C) and the catalytic site of pAPN is located in the B subunit (Jongeneel et al. 1989). APN enzymatic activity is not, however, involved in the process of TGEV entry into the host cells (Delmas et al. 1994).",

Of several TGEV structural proteins, the S protein is a major structural protein involved in virus entry (Egberink et al. 1988; Delmas et al. 1990; Schwegmann\u2013Wessels et al. 2011). Interaction of the S protein with pAPN and sialic acid residues plays a significant part in the process of adsorption and penetration, thus initiating virus infection (Gebauer et al. 1991; Ren et al. 2008). pAPN and the S protein of TGEV have become interesting targets for research into the pathogenesis and prevention of TGEV infection (Sun et al. 2007; 2008). Recombinant pAPN protein and its antiserum can block TGEV infection in vitro (Liu et al. 2009) and the amino acid regions, aa 36\u2013223, aa 349\u2013591 and aa 592\u2013963, in pAPN are major virus-binding regions for TGEV (Ren et al. 2010). However, the precise mechanism involved in virus binding to these regions of pAPN-C has not yet been fully elucidated.",

After induction with IPTG, seven truncated forms of the pAPN-C gene were expressed (Fig. 1a). Purification of the truncated pAPN-C recombinant proteins was then carried out using the gel-cutting method followed by successive dialysis renaturation.

APN is a cellular receptor for several coronaviruses (Yeager et al. 1992; Benbacer et al. 1997; Hegyi and Kolb 1998). For swine coronavirus TGEV, the receptor and the catalytic functions, associated with the C and B subunits of pAPN respectively, involve distinct domains of the molecule. Thus pAPN-C holds significant potential for designing an anti-virus strategy against TGEV. In this study, seven overlapping truncated forms of the entire pAPN-C protein were expressed in Escherichia coli. Protein purification, immunogenicity analysis, and tests of the virus-binding activity of these recombinant proteins were carried out in succession.",

The 18 kDa Trx-His-S Tag protein of the vector pET-32a promoted high-level expression of the target proteins while having little effect on the expressed proteins (Yang et al. 2003; Gasparian et al. 2007). At present, many measures have been reported for the purification of the recombinant proteins expressed in Escherichia coli (Li 2011; Kim et al. 2011; Tzou et al. 2011). In our study, high-purity recombinant pAPN-C proteins were obtained from inclusion bodies by the gel-cutting purification method combined with dialysis refolding, which had been verified as a simple, time-saving, and inexpensive method (Liu et al. 2009; Sun et al. 2011). A polyclonal antibody against native pAPN was used to perform ELISA and western blot analysis of the binding competence of the purified recombinant proteins. The advantage of the polyclonal antibody against the native pAPN was that it recognized any proteins which were consistent with the structure of native pAPN. In our study, all purified recombinant pAPN-C proteins reacted more strongly with antiserum against the native pAPN in both ELISA and western blot. This result provided strong evidence that the purified recombinant proteins possessed similar biological activity to the natural pAPN protein.",

In this study, a monoclonal antibody against His-tag was used to analyze the binding activity of the truncated pAPN-C recombinant proteins with TGEV by an indirect ELISA using the purified TGEV particles as the coating antigen. Of these truncated recombinant proteins, rpAPN-C2 (aa 623\u2013722) and rpAPN-C3 (aa 673\u2013772) showed the highest virus-binding activity. However, rpAPN-C1 (aa 573\u2013672), which overlaps rpAPN-C2, showed low virus-binding activity, while rpAPN-C4 (aa 717\u2013822), overlapping rpAPN-C3, showed medium virus-binding activity. These results suggest that the overlapping region (aa 673\u2013722) between rpAPN-C2 and rpAPN-C3 may be a crucial amino acid region for virus-binding activity of pAPN-C. In addition, the recombinant proteins rpAPN-C4 (aa 717\u2013822) and rpAPN-C5 (aa 773\u2013872) were found to have medium virus-binding activity. The rpAPN-C4 region had been reported previously by Delmas et al. (1994). In this report, the potential virus-binding determinants of pAPN-C are analyzed using a series of truncated recombinant proteins, and the results will provide valuable information for further understanding the function of pAPN-C in infection.",
