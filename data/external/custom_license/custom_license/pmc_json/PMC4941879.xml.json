During influenza outbreaks or pandemics, healthcare workers are at an elevated risk for acquiring influenza infection due to the prolonged periods of exposure to influenza viruses within healthcare settings. The mechanisms of influenza virus dissemination and transmission are poorly understood. Experimental studies have shown that influenza viruses can be transmitted via contact with respiratory secretions, large droplets, and aerosolized small particles/droplet nuclei.\n2\n Mucous membrane contact of large droplets expelled from the respiratory tract are thought to be the predominant mode by which influenza infection is transmitted, but small particle aerosols and droplet nuclei are also of concern due to the potential for prolonged airborne suspension.\n3\n, \n4\n\n",

Such measures would not only enable improved monitoring and detection of viruses, but more importantly, would help prevent widespread transmission. To date, several bioaerosol samplers are available that use impaction or impinger sampling methodologies for viral aerosol detection.\n7\n, \n8\n However, limitations exist within each of these methods such as poor collection efficiency, limited sampling time, and inability to separate particles based on size. Further complicating the study of viral aerosols is that in many environments where it would be desirable to sample for viral aerosols (e.g., hospitals, airports), the level of other biologically relevant particles such as bacteria, fungi, and pollens can also be very high.",

This bioaerosol sampler contains two microcentrifuge tubes and a back\u2010up filter, which separate airborne particulates based on their aerodynamic diameter.\n10\n The first tube (T1) of the sampler collects particles that are greater than approximately 1.8 \u03bcm in diameter, while the second tube (T2) collects particles from 1.0 to 1.8 \u03bcm in diameter and the back\u2010up filter (F) collects submicron particulates. Because the sample is deposited directly in microcentrifuge tubes, the sampler facilitates the direct processing of samples for downstream diagnostic applications such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay. The bioaerosol sampler potentially eliminates several limitations associated with other air sampling devices such as sample loss, contamination, and degradation. In this proof of concept study, we characterized the utility of the two\u2010stage bioaerosol sampler for fractionating viral particles and separating them from other particulates.",

Following 40 minutes of aerosolization (Figure 3), the bioaerosol sampler was able to separate these particles of differing size. Both qPCR and spore counts confirmed that stage T1 retained 96% of the A. versicolor spores while stage T2, with 2% of the spores, was found to contain the greatest amount of viral particles (48%). An overall shift in the deposition of viral particles toward T1 was observed when co\u2010aerosolized with A. versicolor spores (24%\u201342%). Significantly fewer viral particles were detected on the back\u2010up filter F (10%) in comparison with the back\u2010up filter F using FluMist\u00ae alone (38%), suggesting some interaction or aggregation of the particles during aerosolization.",

As anticipated, qPCR results confirmed that a significant number of the aerosolized viral particles were localized within stages T2 and F. These results are in agreement with the sampler cutoff size of 1.0 and <1 \u03bcm for stages T2 and F, respectively.

In aerobiological studies using different viral strains,\n18\n, \n19\n it was found that prolonged sampling periods resulted in decreased viral recovery.

The sensitivity and specificity of qPCR detection is limited to the targeted template. In this study, primers and probes were designed to selectively amplify the HA and NA genes from strains H1N1 and H3N2, respectively. Interestingly, the results showed a considerable difference in the number of viral particles that were detected for strains H1N1 and H3N2. The FluMist\u00ae vaccine is formulated so as to contain an equivalent concentration of each viral strain using the median culture infectious dose (TCID50) assay\n21\n but does not account for non\u2010viable viral particles. qPCR can detect viral cDNA from both viable and non\u2010viable viral particles, and perhaps explain this discrepancy. As for the qPCR detection of strain B, erratic results were obtained. As qPCR detection was successful for both strains H1N1 and H3N2, this may not be due to the presence of inhibitors in the reaction but instead is more likely due to poor primer or probe design or the presence of secondary structures in the influenza B RNA, resulting in poor reverse transcription and insufficient target template.",

Recent findings by Lindsley et al\n\n10\n demonstrated that the two\u2010stage bioaerosol sampler was effective at collecting and separating aerosolized fungal spores and fragments. Results of the current study provide supporting evidence that the bioaerosol sampler is able to successfully recover and size\u2010fractionate viral\u2010laden aerosols. The culmination of these results suggests that the bioaerosol sampler would be an ideal air\u2010sampling device for the aerobiological monitoring of various microorganisms within occupational environments. However, preliminary findings from a co\u2010aerosolization study suggest fractionation of environmental samples may be more complex. Namely, an overall shift in the viral particle deposition in the presence of A. versicolor spores was observed. The shift in viral particle deposition may be attributed to the attachment of viral particles to A. versicolor spores. APS data (not shown) further suggest that particles adhere to one another. Given that the viral and spore\u2010laden solution is pre\u2010mixed prior to aerosolizing, it remains unclear as to whether the binding may occur before, during or after aerosolization within the calm\u2010air settling chamber. Future studies will further elaborate on the use of the bioaerosol sampler to capture and effectively size\u2010fractionate co\u2010aerosolized particles of different species.",

Whether aerosolized influenza particles are a significant contributor to influenza transmission in work environments and the community remains to be determined. Future experiments will focus on studying the dissemination of viral\u2010laden aerosols utilizing an artificial cough generator to simulate cough dispersal of influenza viruses within a room\u2010sized aerosol chamber. These findings would significantly contribute toward understanding the transmission of aerosolized influenza viral particles. Furthermore, we will test the bioaerosol sampler in a healthcare setting to monitor the prevalence of airborne influenza viral particles and to study the transmission of influenza via the inhalation of aerosolized viral particles. Such studies will help to further elucidate the routes of transmission of influenza and would ultimately contribute to better patient management as well as improve infection control guidelines and decrease worker health risk.",
