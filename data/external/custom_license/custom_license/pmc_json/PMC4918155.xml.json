In addition, characteristics of case-patients may be skewed because most were healthcare personnel from a single hospital cluster. Also, we were unable to correlate timing of reported clinical symptoms with laboratory sample collection in 7 of the symptomatic case-patients, even though multiple data sources were used. Moreover, laboratory specimen collection was not systematic in timing or in type of specimens; laboratory specimens were ordered by physicians at different times during a patient\u2019s hospitalization. Because we reviewed medical charts retrospectively, we were unable to verify whether asymptomatic patients were truly asymptomatic, or if they had undocumented mild symptoms. Although PCR testing provides information regarding viral detection, it does not provide information regarding live virus, and its correlation with virus transmission is unknown. Finally, genetic sequence analysis was able to support the epidemiologic links found in the large healthcare-associated cluster, but not all case-patients had specimens available for genetic sequencing.",

            "text": "In summary, our findings of predominance of male MERS-CoV case-patients, development of more severe disease in older case-patients, and clustering in healthcare settings and household settings are consistent with previous reports (12,20). This descriptive study also highlights demographic, risk factor, and symptom data related to case-patients tested for MERS-CoV in Abu Dhabi. Our study provides further evidence of a long duration of PCR positivity and the value of using lower respiratory tract samples in monitoring MERS-CoV infection. We also identified asymptomatic and mildly ill MERS-CoV case-patients, which informs practicing clinicians that MERS-CoV causes a wide spectrum of disease. Finally, our study provided a detailed overview of the unique and comprehensive surveillance and response model for MERS-CoV in Abu Dhabi, which included screening symptomatic and asymptomatic case-patient contacts and collecting detailed epidemiologic data on MERS-CoV case-patients. Further studies must investigate characteristics of case-patients, the role of virus detected by PCR in virus transmission, and potential MER-CoV spread from mildly ill or asymptomatic patients to clarify, and ultimately stop, MERS-CoV transmission.",
