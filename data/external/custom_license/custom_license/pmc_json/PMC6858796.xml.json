            "text": "The field of clinical microbiology comprises both diagnostic microbiology, the identification of pathogens from clinical samples to guide management and treatment strategies for patients with infection, and public health microbiology, the surveillance and monitoring of infectious disease outbreaks in the community. Traditional diagnostic techniques in the microbiology laboratory include growth and isolation of microorganisms in culture, detection of pathogen-specific antibodies (serology) or antigens and molecular identification of microbial nucleic acids (DNA or RNA), most commonly via PCR. While most molecular assays target only a limited number of pathogens using specific primers or probes, metagenomic approaches characterize all DNA or RNA present in a sample, enabling analysis of the entire microbiome as well as the human host genome or transcriptome in patient samples. Metagenomic approaches have been applied for decades to characterize various niches, ranging from marine environments1 to toxic soils2 to arthropod disease vectors3,4 to the human microbiome5,6. These tools have also been used to identify infections in ancient remains7, discover novel viral pathogens8 and characterize the human virome in both healthy and diseased states9\u201311 and for forensic applications12.",

Metagenomics for clinical applications derives its roots from the use of microarrays in the early 2000s13,14. Some early successes using this technology include the discovery of the SARS coronavirus15, gene profiling of mutations in cancer16 and in-depth microbiome analysis of different sites in the human body17. However, it was the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies in 2005 that jump-started the metagenomics field18. For the first time, millions to billions of reads could be generated in a single run, permitting analysis of the entire genetic content of a clinical or environmental sample. The proliferation of available sequencing instruments and exponential decreases in sequencing costs over the ensuing decade drove the rapid adoption of NGS technology.",

For example, NGS was used for the clinical diagnosis of neuroleptospirosis in a 14-year-old critically ill boy with meningoencephalitis19; this case was the first to demonstrate the utility of metagenomic NGS (mNGS) in providing clinically actionable information, as successful diagnosis prompted appropriate targeted antibiotic treatment and eventual recovery of the patient. Examples in public health microbiology include the use of NGS, in combination with transmission network analysis20, to investigate outbreaks of the Escherichia coli strain O104:H4 (ref.21) and for surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in the food supply by bacterial whole-genome sequencing22. Increasingly, big data provided by mNGS is being leveraged for clinical purposes, including characterization of antibiotic resistance directly from clinical samples23 and analysis of human host response (transcriptomic) data to predict causes of infection and evaluate disease risk24,25. Thus, mNGS can be a key driver for precision diagnosis of infectious diseases, advancing precision medicine efforts to personalize patient care in this field.",

A complex interplay of microbial and host factors influences human health, as exemplified by the role of the microbiome in modulating host immune responses26, and it is often unclear whether a detected microorganism is a contaminant, colonizer or bona fide pathogen. Additionally, universal reference standards and proven approaches to demonstrate test validation, reproducibility and quality assurance for clinical metagenomic assays are lacking. Considerations of cost, reimbursement, turnaround time, regulatory considerations and, perhaps most importantly, clinical utility also remain major hurdles for the routine implementation of clinical mNGS in patient care settings27.",

This step can increase the detection sensitivity for microorganisms being targeted, although it limits the breadth of potential pathogens that can be identified. An example of a targeted approach is the use of highly conserved primers for universal PCR amplification and detection of all microorganisms corresponding to a specific type from clinical samples, such as 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene amplification for bacteria38,39 and 18S rRNA and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) gene amplification for fungi40 (Fig. 2). Previously, such approaches were followed by Sanger sequencing of the resulting PCR amplicon to identify the pathogen and make a diagnosis; now, this step is commonly accomplished using NGS. Universal PCR for detection of bacteria and fungi has now been adopted in many hospital laboratories and has increased the number and proportion of infectious diagnoses39,41, although the technique is limited by the breadth of detection (that is, bacteria or fungi only or even a more limited range of targets, such as mycobacteria only, depending on the primer sets used) and by concerns regarding sensitivity42.",

Although this enrichment method has been shown to increase the sensitivity of metagenomic detection in research settings, especially for viruses, it has yet to be used routinely for clinical diagnosis. A promising application of this approach may be the enrichment of clinical samples for characterization of antibiotic resistance23, a considerable problem in hospitals and the primary focus of the US National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria53. However, drawbacks of capture probe enrichment, compared with untargeted approaches for infectious disease diagnosis, include a bias towards targeted microorganisms, added steps, increased costs and long hybridization times (24\u201348 hours) as a result of the additional processing needed for maximal efficiency.",

This study demonstrated for the first time the high-resolution mapping of likely transmission events in a hospital, some of which were unexpected on the basis of initial epidemiological data, and also identified putative resistance mutations in emerging resistant strains.

In principle, nearly all pathogens, including viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites, can be identified in a single assay56. mNGS is a needle-in-a-haystack endeavour, as only a small proportion (typically <1%) of reads are non-human, of which only a subset may correspond to potential pathogens. A limitation of mNGS is that the sensitivity of the approach is critically dependent on the level of background. Tissues, for example, have increased human host background relative to cell-free body fluids, resulting in a reduced number and proportion of microbial reads and hence a decrease in mNGS sensitivity33,36,37. Moreover, defining specific microbial profiles that are diagnostic or predictive of disease development can be difficult, especially from nonsterile sites that harbour a complex microbiome, such as respiratory secretions or stool6. Nevertheless, several groups have successfully validated mNGS in Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified clinical laboratories for the diagnosis of infections, including meningitis or encephalitis36,37, sepsis33,57 and pneumonia58, and these assays are now available for clinical reference testing of patients.",

Interrogation of RNA reads from microorganisms corresponding to active microbial gene expression might enable the discrimination between infection versus colonization25 and live (viable) versus dead organisms79. Moreover, RNA-seq analyses of the human host can be used to identify novel or underappreciated host\u2013microbial interactions directly from clinical samples, as previously shown for patients with Lyme disease68, dengue80 or malaria81. RNA-seq may be particularly useful in clinical cases in which the causative pathogen is only transiently present (such as early Lyme disease82 or arboviral infections, including West Nile virus83 or ZIKV84); analogous to serologic testing, indirect diagnosis of infections may be possible on the basis of a pathogen-specific human host response. Analysis of pathogen-specific host responses may also be useful in discriminating the bona fide causative pathogen or pathogens in a complex clinical metagenomic sample, such as a polymicrobial abscess or respiratory fluid25. Yet another promising application of RNA-seq is in discriminating infectious versus non-infectious causes of acute illness25. If an illness is judged more likely to be non-infectious (for example, an autoimmune disease) on the basis of the host response, for example, clinicians may be more willing to discontinue antibiotics and treat the patient aggressively with steroids and other immunosuppressive medications. As large-scale sequencing data continue to be generated, perhaps driven by routine clinical mNGS testing, secondary mining of human reads might improve the accuracy of clinical diagnoses by incorporating both microbial and host gene expression data.",

Differential lysis of human cells followed by degradation of background DNA with DNase I \u2014 thus retaining and enriching for nucleic acid from organisms with cell walls, which include some bacteria and fungi \u2014 has been shown to provide substantial microbial enrichment of up to 1,000 times94,99,100.

These limitations include potential decreased sensitivity for microorganisms without cell walls, such as Mycoplasma spp. or parasites; a possible paradoxical increase in exogenous background contamination by use of additional reagents101; and the inability to detect free nucleic acid from dead organisms that are lysed in vivo by human host immune cells or antibiotic treatment. The importance of retaining the ability for cell-free DNA detection from culture-negative samples from dead organisms is also why incorporation of a propidium monoazide treatment step to select for DNA from live organisms may not be clinically useful as an enrichment method for mNGS102.

Separating the assay workflow into multiple discrete steps to be performed by rotating shifts can be helpful to avoid laboratory errors.",

As shown for HIV-1, recovery of the complete viral genome from a patient sample by metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) (part Ad, graph) facilitates sequence analysis to predict susceptibility or resistance to antiretroviral drugs (part Ad, bar plot); the susceptibility profile for the analysed strain (black bars) predicts resistance to the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) class of drugs (denoted by an asterisk), as opposed to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) or protease inhibitors (PIs). B | Microbiome analyses can inform disease prognosis in acute and chronic disease states and underlie the development of probiotic therapies. Coloured bars represent individual microbiota species. A reduction in species diversity is seen in dysbiosis (an unhealthy state), such as present in patients with Clostridium difficile-associated disease. Stool from healthy individuals can be harvested to treat patients with C. difficile infection by faecal stool transplantation or as orally administered encapsulated faecal pills. Alternatively, synthetic stool generated from microbiota species observed in healthy individuals can be used as probiotics to treat patients. In addition to C. difficile infection, chronic diseases such as obesity, inflammatory bowel disease and diabetes mellitus are potential targets for probiotic therapy. C | RNA-sequencing-based transcriptomics can improve the diagnosis of infectious and non-infectious conditions on the basis of the human host response. Host transcriptomic profiling by NGS can enable the construction of a classifier metric to discriminate between patients with infection (red bars) from uninfected patients (blue bars) with high accuracy (part Ca). Metric scores above the dotted line indicate infection, whereas scores below the dotted line indicate absence of infection; the overall accuracy of the classifier metric shown is 83%. Cluster heat map analysis identifies individual, differentially expressed host genes associated with infection (genes A\u2013F) versus those associated with no infection (genes G\u2013L) (part Cb). D | Sequencing of viral tumours or liquid biopsy analyses in oncology can be used for simultaneous pathogen detection and characterization of host genetic mutations. mNGS can be used to detect Merkel cell polyomavirus, the virus associated with the development of Merkel cell carcinoma. Simultaneous sequencing of host DNA can identify mutations that arise from integration of the viral genome containing the full-length large T antigen (LT) followed by subsequent truncation of the LT antigen (part Da) or truncation of the LT antigen before viral genome integration (part Db). Both of these two mutations lead to cellular transformation that drives tumour proliferation. Although promising, many of these sequencing-based applications have yet to be incorporated into routine clinical practice.

An initial preprocessing step consists of low-quality filtering, low-complexity filtering and adaptor trimming. Computational host subtraction is performed by mapping reads to the host (for example, human) genome and setting aside host reads for subsequent transcriptome (RNA) or genome (DNA) analysis. The remaining unmapped reads are directly aligned to large reference databases, such as the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank database or microbial reference sequence or genome collections, or are first assembled de novo into longer contiguous sequences (contigs) followed by alignment to reference databases. After taxonomic classification, in which individual reads or contigs are assigned into specific taxa (for example, species, genus and family), the data can be analysed and visualized in a number of different formats. These include coverage map and pairwise identity plots to determine how much of the microbial genome has been recovered and its similarity to reference genomes in the database; Krona plots to visualize taxonomic diversity in the metagenomic library; phylogenetic analysis to compare assembled genes, gene regions or genomes to reference sequences; and heat maps to show microorganisms that were detected in the clinical samples.
