These determinants can be grouped into 4 categories (Table 1) (4,5). The first group is related to the molecular characteristics of pathogens, such as virulence, transmissibility, and survival fitness, which are issues beyond the scope of this article. Moreover, progress in microbiologic detection and identification of infectious pathogens is likely to influence diagnostic uncertainty and prescribing patterns of antimicrobial drugs. The second group of determinants is linked to prescribers of antimicrobial drugs, physicians, who may change their prescription patterns. Recent data from different parts of the world show promise in this area. The third group is related to characteristics of patient populations and host-related factors. Not only does this include infection rates and case-mix characteristics, but also consumer attitudes and global migration patterns. A fourth group of determinants is linked to macro-level factors related to the healthcare environment. These factors include regulatory policies that may influence use of antimicrobial drugs, infection control practices, technologic development, and drug discovery.",

First, new diagnostic tests will facilitate initiation or withdrawal of antimicrobial therapy soon after onset of symptoms, especially in the hospital setting. Several new biological markers, such as procalcitonin and soluble triggering receptors expressed on myeloid cells, have been proposed to serve either goal (7,8). Second, molecular diagnostics may increase diagnostic accuracy and enable more prudent antimicrobial drug use in the future. Amplification technology with DNA microarrays and simplified automation opens the potential for rapid testing. Dunne et al. described a scenario in which by the year 2025, sophisticated laboratory platforms with real-time amplifiers will automatically obtain and analyze clinical samples and be able to detect any potentially pathogenic microbe within 30 minutes (9). The threat of bioterrorism may also foster research about rapid molecular diagnostic tests that may be used at the bedside. Third, new diagnostic tools may be available to rapidly distinguish between bacterial and viral infections in the ambulatory setting. Fourth, profound changes will be seen in the techniques used to perform molecular identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. In summary, there are several lines of evidence suggesting that a number of molecular, immunologic, and microbial techniques will change the way infectious diseases are diagnosed and reduce diagnostic uncertainty in the next 2 decades (10).",

Prediction rules designed for the early discontinuation of antimicrobial agents have been validated by prospective trials and will further optimize antimicrobial drug use (12).",

Consequently, in many industrialized countries, either the number of antimicrobial agent prescriptions or the volume of antimicrobial use has decreased over the last 10 years, especially in the ambulatory setting (Table 2) (13,14). A plateau in worldwide antimicrobial consumption seems to have been reached, leading to a saturated market. As stated recently by representatives of the pharmaceutical industry, \"The awareness of the relationship between use and emerging resistance has led to efforts to decrease, even restrict, antibiotic use, and therefore decrease the positive influence of resistance on the market and decrease market potential\" (15).",

An increase in immunocompromised patients, the growing life-expectancy, and the susceptibility of older persons to infections could indirectly contribute to greater antimicrobial drug use and dissemination of resistant microbes. Moreover, infectious diseases are influenced by developments in other areas of patient care. New technologies and treatments can create new infectious diseases or eliminate existing ones. For instance, cancer chemotherapy led to new types of susceptible hosts and infectious disease problems, indirectly impelling the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance within hospitals. Key trends in clinical care and biomedical discovery that are likely to influence antimicrobial resistance are the increased use of medical devices and gene therapies, and better management of chronic diseases such as diabetes and cancer. These developments will likely reduce some types of resistance problems and help spawn others.",

For nstance, in several countries, such as France and Spain, which use a great amount of antimicrobial agents, a decrease in pneumococcal resistance rates among invasive isolates has been noted recently. This coincides with a decrease in antimicrobial drug use after nationwide campaigns and the introduction of a conjugate pneumococcal vaccine (22).
