The ability of influenza A viruses to reassort their segmented genomes further facilitates the generation of pandemic viruses.

Phylogenetic analysis of the haemagglutinin (HA) segment revealed that H17 is closely related to the HAs of influenza A viruses6, although structural and functional studies have indicated that this protein lacks a typical sialic acid-binding pocket and receptor-binding properties7,8. Similarly surprising, N10 is only distantly related to neuraminidases (NA) of influenza A and B viruses, and lacks detectable sialidase activity9,10. Despite these differences, phylogenetic analysis of the segments coding for the three polymerase subunits PB2, PB1 and PA, the nucleoprotein NP, the matrix protein M1 and M2, the non-structural protein NS1 and the nuclear export protein NEP suggests a closer relationship to influenza A viruses than to influenza B viruses6. Reconstitution of the polymerase complex demonstrated that the replication machinery of H17N10 is fully functional in human cells6. Moreover, the N-terminal domain of bat PA exhibits a tertiary structure and endonuclease activity similar to other conventional influenza A viruses11. Recently, a second bat influenza virus, designated H18N10, was identified from flat-faced fruit bats (Artibeus planirostris) from Peru, suggesting a broader distribution and diversity of bat influenza viruses at least in Central and South America12.",

We find that both the nucleoprotein NP and the polymerase subunit PB2 support the reconstitution of influenza A but not of influenza B virus polymerases in human cells. Functional compatibility is also observed in the formation of virus-like particles (VLPs) using HA and NA of the influenza A virus strain A/SC35M and all internal bat proteins. Based on these findings, we generate an infectious virus containing six out of the eight bat virus genes and two genes of the influenza A virus strain A/SC35M coding for H7 and N7. This virus replicates well in mammalian cells and mice, but not in avian cells or in embryonated chicken eggs without further adaptation. Despite the inability to reassort with other influenza A viruses, our data suggest that zoonotic transmission of bat influenza viruses into the human population cannot be excluded.",

            "text": "Based on the phylogenetic relationship between the known bat influenza viruses and influenza A viruses6,12, we speculated that components of the replication machinery between these viruses might be compatible. We therefore reconstituted the viral ribonucleoprotein/polymerase complex of several influenza A viruses in human HEK293T cells and substituted single polymerase subunits or NP with the corresponding H17N10 components. Bat influenza virus NP, and to a certain degree PB2, supported the polymerase activity of the mouse-adapted A/SC35M (H7N7) influenza A virus14, whereas replacement of PB1 and PA was not tolerated (Fig. 1a). Vice versa, bat influenza virus polymerase activity did not change if NP was substituted by the corresponding protein from SC35M, highlighting the functional compatibility of NP between these two strains (Supplementary Fig. 1A). Bat NP also supported the polymerases of all other tested influenza A virus subtypes, including A/Brevig Mission/1/18 and A/WSN/33 (both H1N1), A/Panama/2007/99 (H3N2) and A/Thailand/KAN-1/2004 (H5N1; Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 1B). In sharp contrast, no functional compatibility of the polymerases and NP of influenza B viruses B/Yamagata/73 and B/Lee/40 with any corresponding protein from the bat influenza virus was observed (Fig. 1b), suggesting a closer relationship of the replication machinery of H17N10 with influenza A than with influenza B viruses. NP from the bat influenza virus also supported the formation of SC35M-specific VLPs containing viral ribonucleoproteins coding for green fluorescent protein (GFP; Fig. 1c), further highlighting the functional compatibility of this nucleoprotein. Although we observed no GFP reporter signal if only bat virus components were used (Supplementary Table 1), systematic exchange of bat and SC35M components revealed that infectious VLPs are efficiently formed with HA and NA of SC35M combined with the internal proteins of H17N10 (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Table 1).",

Successful rescue of infectious virus in human HEK293T cells and subsequent amplification in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells was only possible using the latter strategy (Fig. 2a). This is consistent with the presence of specific packaging signals at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the viral segments that include portions of the coding region, as it has been shown to be the case for conventional influenza A virus16.",

Deep sequencing of the viral genomes revealed non-silent mutations in Bat C1 (NA V167I, PA S550R) and Bat C2 (PB1 E656G), respectively, whereas no mutation was found in the coding sequences of Bat C3 (Supplementary Table 2) compared with published sequences6. All three plaque-purified viruses replicated to similar titres in MDCK cells of up to 108 plaque-forming unit (PFU) per ml (Fig. 2c). Efficient growth was also observed in the kidney-derived bat cell line EpoNi/22.1 (Fig. 2d), but not in the bat cell line CarperAEC.B-3 (Supplementary Fig. 2A). In newborn swine kidney (NSK) cells (Fig. 2e) and cells derived from newborn pig trachea (NPTr; Supplementary Fig. 2B), all three viruses grew to similar titres of up to 107 PFU per ml. Viral replication was also evident in both human lung carcinoma epithelial cells (A549; Supplementary Fig. 2C) and primary human bronchial airway epithelial (HBAE) cell cultures, although not to the same extent compared with SC35M (Fig. 2f). However, increased viral titres were observed in HBAE cells at later time points post infection (p.i.; Fig. 2f). Sequence analysis at day 7 p.i. excluded the acquisition of new adaptive mutations. Replication of Bat C3 in the bat cell lines EpoNi/22.1 and CarperAEC.B-3 was reduced at lower temperature (33 \u00b0C) and almost absent at 40 \u00b0C (Supplementary Fig. 2D). This suggests that the optimal temperature for viral growth of the bat/SC35M chimera is around 37 \u00b0C, consistent with the observation that the average temperature of Sturnira lilium is 36.4 \u00b0C (ref. 17), the bat species in which the H17N10 viral genomes were identified. Together, these data suggest that the bat influenza viral proteins in combination with HA and NA of SC35M fully support viral replication in various mammalian species, including primary HBAE cells, although, in general, the bat/SC35M chimeric viruses had showed slower replication kinetics and/or reached somewhat lower titres than the control SC35M virus in mammalian cells.",

Bat C2 replicated poorly and reached, independent of the infection dose, maximal lung titres of 3 \u00d7 103 PFU per lung, whereas infection with Bat C1 and C3 resulted in higher lung titres of up to 106 PFU per lung (Fig. 2g). Viral titres of the latter two viruses remain elevated in lung and nasal turbinate 5\u20136 days p.i. (Supplementary Fig. 3A and B). However, infection of BALB/c mice with up to 106 PFU of Bat C3 caused no weight loss and mortality (Supplementary Fig. 3C). Similar viral lung titres were observed 72 h p.i. in B6 mice infected with 104 PFU of Bat C1, C2 and C3 (Supplementary Fig. 3D). Intriguingly, poor replication of Bat C2 was also observed in B6 mice lacking an intact IFN response system (B6 mice devoid of STAT1; Supplementary Fig. 3D), suggesting that the poor viral replication cannot be increased in the absence of a robust intact innate immune response.",

In LMH cells, growth of the chimeric viruses, especially of Bat C3, was severely compromised compared with SC35M (Fig. 3a). In contrast, all three viruses replicated in DF-1 cells to viral titres of up to 107 PFU per ml, although with slower kinetics than the SC35M control virus (Fig. 3b). Interestingly, all bat/SC35M reassortant viruses acquired several mutations during growth in DF-1 cells (Supplementary Table 3). To test whether these mutations are involved in adaptation to avian cells, we compared the replication of DF-1 passaged viruses with the MDCK-derived viruses in embryonated chicken eggs using 104 PFU for either virus. Whereas the MDCK-derived Bat C2 and especially Bat C3 replicated only poorly in eggs, infection with Bat C1 resulted in high virus titres of up to 108 PFU per ml of allantoic fluid in some embryos (Fig. 3c). Following passaging MDCK-derived Bat C1 and Bat C2 viruses in embryonated eggs, analysis of virus quasispecies by deep sequencing identified several mutations, which resulted mainly in amino-acid changes in HA and PA (Supplementary Table 4). Intriguingly, Bat C1, C2 and C3 that were passaged in DF-1 cells replicated to higher titres in embryonated chicken eggs than the corresponding viruses passaged in MDCK cells (Fig. 3c). The mutations acquired after one passage in DF-1 cells (Supplementary Table 3) were also maintained in eggs (Supplementary Table 4). Non-silent mutations resulted in amino-acid changes in HA, PA, M1 and most frequently in M2 (N31S; Supplementary Table 4). Following passage in embryonated chicken eggs, these viruses gained the ability to replicate more efficiently in LMH cells (Fig. 3d) than the original MDCK-derived viruses (Fig. 3a). These findings suggest that the mutations acquired in DF-1 cells and in ovo enhanced viral replication in avian cells. For further proof, we rescued Bat/SC35M chimeras (Bat-PA(S550R), Bat-M2(N31S,T70A), Bat-PA(S550R)M2(N31S,T70A) and Bat-PB1(E656G)M2(N31S,T70A), which contained the avian-like amino-acid mutations determined by deep sequencing (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). These viruses show enhanced viral growth in LMH cells compared with BAT C3, indicating that these avian-adapting mutations do indeed enhance viral replication in avian cells (Fig. 3e). To test whether the mutation in either PA (S550R) or PB1 (E656G) would increase the polymerase activity, we reconstituted the bat polymerase in either avian (LMH) or human cells (HEK293T) and compared the activity of these two mutant proteins with wild-type bat PA and PB1. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 4, PA S550R as well as the PB1 E656G increased the polymerase activity in avian cells but not in human cells compared with wild-type bat polymerase. Together, these results indicate that the mutations observed following passage in DF-1 cells or chicken embryos led to increased replication in avian cells. Furthermore, this also suggests that bat influenza viruses are poorly adapted to avian hosts and adaptive mutations are required to overcome this species barrier.",

Likewise, no reassortant viruses could be found after co-infection of MDCK cells with either Bat C3 and SC35M or Bat C3 and A/WSN/1933 (H1N1; Supplementary Table 6). This argues for incompatibilities of the H17N10 genomic RNA segments with segments of conventional influenza A viruses.

This suggests that the cellular receptors for the bat influenza virus are different from those of conventional influenza A viruses.

Interestingly, in a VLP assay, the bat M2 protein was not functional in the context of the SC35M NP and M1 proteins, and vice versa SC35M M2 protein was not functional in the context of the bat virus NP and M1 proteins (see Supplementary Table 1). This indicates that the bat virus M2 protein does not cooperate with the NP and M1 proteins of SC35M. Although the chimeric virus with the homotypic bat virus NP, M1 and M2 proteins turned out to be resistant to amantadine, a mutant virus emerged during passage in avian cells, which was highly sensitive to this drug. This finding argues for a proton channel activity of the bat M2 protein. Whether this activity exhibits also a similar role in the viral life cycle as the conventional M2 proteins has to be further investigated.",

            "text": "Although we cannot exclude zoonotic transmission of bat influenza virus, several barriers may exist that could prevent such events. Bat influenza viruses may bind to cellular receptors, which might be much more uncommon than sialic acids. In addition, the RNA packaging signals are different from those of conventional influenza A viruses thus impairing the emergence of reassortant viruses. Lack of reassortment with conventional influenza A viruses supports the inclusion of bat influenza viruses as a novel type (A-like) of influenza viruses. Moreover, M2 of the bat influenza virus did not functionally cooperate with NP and M1 proteins of conventional influenza A viruses. In addition, both PA and PB1 of H17N10 did not support polymerase activity of several influenza A virus polymerases. The probability that a non-human conventional influenza A virus infects people is already quite low, as even the most frequent human infections with non-human viruses are very low (39 human cases for H5N1 in 2013 and 375 human cases for H7N9 between May 2013 and February 2014 (WHO Global Influenza Program, http://www.who.int/influenza/en/)). However, both H5N1 and H7N9 viruses are able to infect human cells, albeit with a different receptor specificity than human influenza viruses, and are able to reassort with human influenza viruses. The inability of bat-derived influenza viruses to infect human cells and to reassort with conventional influenza A viruses significantly reduces the risk of these viruses to cause human infections as compared with non-human conventional influenza viruses, such as H5N1 and H7N9.",

After removal of the media, cells were incubated for 40 s with 0.1 M glycine-HCl (pH 2.2) and subsequently maintained at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2 in DMEM supplemented with 0.2% (v/w) BSA, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U penicillin per ml and 100 \u03bcg streptomycin per ml. After 48 h, virus-containing cell supernatants were collected and subjected to plaque assay on MDCKII cells. From each co-infection experiment, 100 plaques were picked and multiplied on MDCKII cells until cytophatic effect was visible, and cell culture (0.3 ml) supernatant was subjected to RNA purification. To establish the strain-specific reverse transcription PCR (RT\u2013PCR) procedure, 30 individual plaques from each strain were picked and amplified. Viral RNA was obtained using QIAamp viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) and eluted in 60 \u03bcl. Next, 5 \u03bcl of viral RNA were used as template to amplify influenza-specific cDNAs with a mixture of primers matching sequences in all eight segments from the three parental viruses (Supplementary Table 7). The one-step reverse transcription (RT)-PCR consisted in a 1-h RT at 42 \u00b0C followed by 10 cycles of PCR, using Promega\u2019s AccessQuick RT\u2013PCR system (Promega). 5% of the resulting cDNA solutions were used as template in segment-specific real-time PCR using LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master. Primer pairs were chosen empirically to amplify fragments from the parental viruses with different melting temperatures. Single peak melting temperatures were used to identify the parental origin of each segment. In the case of six samples that yielded inconclusive results, viral supernatant of clones that were positive for Bat and SC35M was used to infect MDCK cells for further plaque purification of at least four clones. The viral segments of these individual plaque-purified clones were analysed by RT\u2013PCR using strand-specific primer and partial sequencing. This revealed in all cases either Bat C3 or SC35M, indicating that a mixture of these two viruses, was present in the original six samples.",
