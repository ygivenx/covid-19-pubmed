When caring for him, staff were advised to use personal protective equipment as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Unfortunately, the patient died on October 8, and 2 nurses who had cared for him contracted EVD (1). This failure of infection control contributed to the public spread of panic, served as a wake-up call to the public health community, and helped convince the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that EVD should be treated only in specialized hospitals with highly trained personnel (2).",

Since the practice of infection prevention and control became a specialty in the 1960s, healthcare-associated infections have decreased substantially (5). New leaders in the field of infection prevention and control will always be needed. It is for these emerging experts that Lautenbach and colleagues have updated their book, Practical Healthcare Epidemiology, to a fourth edition (Figure). They set forth to provide \u201ca pragmatic, easy-to-use reference\u201d that provides \u201creal-world advice\u201d as if they were speaking to a person who would be running an infection prevention program and who was just starting in this field.
