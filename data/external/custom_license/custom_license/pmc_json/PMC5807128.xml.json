Currently approved antiviral drugs treat fewer than\nten viral infections. While antibacterial agents are more widely available,\nonly a minority of them penetrate mammalian cells and achieve a therapeutic\nlevel in the appropriate intracellular compartment to treat intracellular\nbacterial infections.1 The narrow spectrum\nof coverage of most antimicrobials that target microbial functions,\nparticularly viruses, is another major limitation. Given the high\naverage cost (over two billion dollars) and long timeline (8\u201312\nyears) to develop a new drug, the scalability of targeting microbes\nindividually is limited. Lastly, resistance typically emerges rapidly\nwhen conventional drugs that target microbial functions are used as\nmonotherapy.",

Since some host functions are hijacked by various\nviruses, intracellular bacteria, and/or protozoa, they may represent\ntargets for broad-spectrum antimicrobials.
