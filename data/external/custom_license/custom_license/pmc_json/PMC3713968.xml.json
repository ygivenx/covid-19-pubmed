A striking observation is that the critical positions P1 and P2 are among the most consistently mutated (Figure 3). To a lesser degree, variability extends to other positions of the cleavage motif, notably in the P1\u2032, P3, P4, and P5 positions (Figure 2). Examination results of the entire portion of spike sequenced in this study indicate that the conserved R-R-S/A-R-R-S motif in FECV is present within a region of the spike gene that shows a high degree of variability, in contrast to other neighboring regions that are more highly conserved (Technical Appendix Figure 1).",

However, feline furin has not been directly studied to any degree, and reagents are not readily available. Feline and human cells lines show identical rates of cleavage for a known furin target protein (PSCK-9), which contains an active furin cleavage site (Technical Appendix Figure 2). We used fluorogenic peptides containing the canonical motif (R-R-S-R-R-S) or with substitutions from positions P1\u2032 through P7 (Figure 4, panel A). The canonical peptide was efficiently cleaved by furin (Figure 4), with average Vmax of 235 Relative Fluorescence Units (RFU) per minute.",

Modifications of the P1 arginine in the canonical peptide, regardless of the residue tested, for example, glycine (G), methionine (M) or threonine (T), abrogate cleavage by furin (Figure 4). Modifications at the P2 arginine residue in the canonical peptide have variable effects. When P2 arginine is changed to histidine (H), there is complete inhibition (0% of canonical cleavage). When P2 is changed to leucine or serine, cleavage efficiency is reduced by \u224850% and 20%, respectively. When P2 is modified to proline (P), cleavage efficiency slightly increases to 129% of the canonical peptide (Figure 4). The P3 S-A substitution minimally enhances cleavage (Figure 4). P4 arginine is another residue position that is essential for furin cleavage. In the canonical peptide, P4 R-K substitution, there is a slight decrease in cleavage efficiency (88.7% of canonical rate). In contrast, when the P4 arginine is substituted with glycine, furin cleavage is completely abrogated (Figure 4).",

In addition to the consensus R-X-K/R-R motif, additional flanking residues can also be consequential for furin-mediated cleavage (26\u201328). In particular, a serine (S) residue is critical in the P1\u2032 position (29) and it is notable that all FECVs examined contained a P1\u2032 S residue. The fact that the S1/S2 site is extremely well conserved is an indication that it is functionally essential for FECV replication in the enteric epithelium.",

            "text": "In contrast to the situation for asymptomatic cats infected with FECV, we found that sequences of FCoV sampled from tissue of confirmed FIP-positive cats consistently have mutations at the S1/S2 site. In the most critical position for furin cleavage, P1, we found that >40% of FIPVs have a mutation in the arginine residue, which is replaced by an aliphatic (methionine and glycine) or polar uncharged (threonine) residue. Overall, the distinguishing feature of FIPVs is the absence of the P1 arginine, rather that the presence of any particular residue. This is corroborated by our peptide cleavage data that demonstrate that furin cleavage is fully abrogated for all P1 substitutions tested. The next most common position mutated in FIPV is P2; >30% of the FIPVs analyzed bore mutations at this position. Most mutated residues found were aliphatic (P and L). Some sequences were substituted with a polar basic (H) or a polar uncharged (S) residue. Apart from the P2 R-P substitution, peptide cleavage data indicates that all other substitutions have an inhibiting effect on furin cleavage. Of note, for murine hepatitis virus (MHV), a betacoronavirus that also harbors an S1/S2 cleavage site in its spike protein, there is a precedent for the inhibitory effect of the introduction of a histidine in the P2 position of the cleavage site. Two well-studied strains, MHV strain A59 (MHV-A59) and the neurovirulent MHV strain JHM (MHV-JHM), have a notable difference at this site. MHV-A59 has an R-R-S-H-R-S sequence and is less efficiently cleaved than MHV-JHM, which has an R-R-A-S-S-R sequence (18). P4 is generally considered to be critical for furin cleavage, but we found limited variation in this residue position for the FIPVs tested and found mutation to the polar basic residue (K) or polar uncharged residue (S) in <5% of viruses. The peptide data indicates that, although introduction of a serine at P4 completely abrogates cleavage, the P4 R\u2192K substitution has minimal effect. The FIPV P3 position showed small variation compared with FECV after the introduction of a polar uncharged residue (T) in 1 sample. For the P5 position, the only change was a slightly higher frequency of the lysine residue in samples from cats with FIPV. Peptide cleavage data indicated that the common S-A substitution found for FECV and FIPV P3 positions has only slightly increasing effect on proteolysis by furin. Furthermore, the P5 R\u2192K substitution has an enhancing effect in the peptide cleavage assay. At P1\u2032, the conserved polar uncharged residue (S) was retained in the majority of FIPV samples, however, the introduction of an aliphatic amino acid (L) was found. It is notable that furin cleavage has been suggested to be incompatible with a hydrophobic aliphatic side chain, with a strong preference for serine in the P1\u2032 position (27,29). In the D04-397-2 sample containing the P1\u2032 L, the basic residues within the S1/S2 site remain identical to the ones found in FECV sequence; we suggest that disruption of furin cleavage is mediated by a mutation in P1\u2032, rather than the more typical P1, P2 and/or P4 mutation. This hypothesis is supported by the peptide cleavage assay, where the P1\u2032S-L peptide is unable to be cleaved by furin.",

We consider that the presence of a P6 furin cleavage in samples of cat 151643 is consistent with our hypothesis of a switch in the activating protease for the virus, because this is not typical of naturally occurring furin cleavage sites. Samples 1 and 2 from cat N05-110 harbor virus with an atypical lysine residue at P5. While unusual for FECVs, a P5 lysine residue does appear to be compatible with furin cleavage, so it remains to be determined how noteworthy a P5 lysine residue versus a P5 arginine residue is in the context of a protease switch for FIPV, or whether other mutations correlated with FIPV in the case of this cat.",

Cat 304, living in the same house as cat 234, remained asymptomatic. Cat 304 harbored a mutated virus, but the mutation was in a functionally irrelevant position (P3 S-A). Identification of cats with FECV in which FIP subsequently develops is challenging, and while we present a single example, we consider these data to be strong evidence that mutations at the S1/S2 site are linked to a change in the pathogenic properties of the virus, and likely to be essential for the acquisition of macrophage tropism seen in FIP.",

We have undertaken an analysis of the S1/S2 sites sequenced by Chang et al. and find that our hypothesis that mutation within the S1/S2 furin motif correlates with FIP in \u224864% of their samples. There are 3 differences in methodology that may explain this lack of agreement: first, we employed immunohistochemistry to confirm the diagnosis of FIP, while Chang et al. reported using postmortem examination; second, all FIP samples in this study originate from tissue, while Chang et al. included both tissue and ascites fluid; and finally, we report multiple sequences for FIP-affected cats, while Chang et al. reported a single sequence. Sequence data from samples D04-397-1 and D04-397-2 provide evidence that both FECV and FIPV populations can be identified within an affected animal.

Given that the majority of the FIPV S proteins still harbor basic residues at the S1/S2 boundary, it could be reasoned that the mutated site becomes more open and can be cleaved by a range of other proteases. The switch in proteolytic requirements of S that we propose may offer an explanation for the crucial tropism transition during FIP. A possible consequence of the mutations is cleavability by monocytic/macrophage-specific proteases. These could be pro-protein convertases, cathepsins, or other macrophage-specific proteases. In particular, cathepsin B, matrix metalloproteases, and furin-related PCSK1 are likely to be expressed on the surface of macrophages and recognize the hallmark residues remaining or acquired in FIPV S1/S2 cleavage site (30). Matrix metalloprotease 9 is of particular interest because it was demonstrated to be upregulated in activated monocytes and macrophages during FIP (31). A shift in the entry pathway to enable virus entry at the cell surface instead of the endosome may simultaneously explain the ability of FIPV to infect macrophages and the macrophage resistance of FECV. It is also possible that the mutations in the S1/S2 region affect the heparin sulfate binding site in this region (19). However, heparin sulfate binding is a cell culture adaptation of the virus, and as so, its relevance to the clinical situation would appear to be unlikely.",

Based on the data we present here, we conclude that mutation of the S1/S2 locus and modulation of a furin recognition site normally present in the S gene of FECVs is a critical contributing factor for development of FIP.
