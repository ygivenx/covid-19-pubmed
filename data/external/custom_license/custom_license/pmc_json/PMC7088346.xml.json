            "text": "Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a serious infectious disease accompanied with high morbidity and mortality, and has a mortality of 30\u201350% [1, 2]. It is defined as a common infection which is potentially life threatening, particularly in older adults along with those with comorbid disease [3]. Severe CAP (SCAP) has generally been defined as CAP requiring admission to the intensive care unit due to invasive mechanical ventilation or septic shock requiring vasopressors [4\u20136]. It is related to severe mortality and approximately 16\u201336% patients with SCAP may die in a short time [7]. It is reported that about one-third of patients with CAP requiring hospitalization present with co-infection of both bacteria and virus, and most of them are Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) and influenza [8]. The main bacterial causes of CAP are well described, with S. pneumoniae acting as the most significant pathogen in all age groups [9]. Viruses, such as influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza viruses as well as adenoviruses, are also considered as important causes of CAP [10]. Currently, proper antibiotics, simple analgesics accompanied with adequate rest are the major medication against pneumonia [11]. And the macrolide antibiotics have been demonstrated to be widely applied to treat CAP (including pneumococcal pneumonia) due to their excellent inhibition against S. pneumoniae and atypical organisms [12]. Nevertheless, the prevalence of influenza A (H1N1) virus-associated pneumonia and the role of bacterial co-infection in the prognosis of patients are poorly described in the general population [13].",

            "text": "Flexible bronchoscopy combined with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is a viable alternative for sputum acquisition if noninvasive samples are unobtainable from the lower respiratory tract [14]. Pathogens detected in BAL can be verified by easy molecule biological methods, which can be used to improve the sensitivity and accuracy of diagnostic studies in patients with CAP who are nonresponsive to empiric antibiotic therapy [15]. However, the molecular mechanism of pathology by these pathogens remains unclear. Pneumonia is per se an inflammatory condition caused by multiple factors. It has been reported that pneumonia is strongly associated with inflammation caused by autophagy and apoptosis [16]. Beclin1, a mammalian homolog of the yeast Atg6/Vacuolar protein sorting 30 (Vps30) protein, is suggested to play a vital role in macroautophagy and vacuolar protein sorting [17]. Meanwhile, Beclin1 is necessary for the development of normal mammalian and it has been demonstrated to play a pivotal role in pathogenesis, including cancer [18]. The phosphorylation of Beclin1 mediated by protein kinase B (AKT) functions in oncogenesis and autophagy inhibition [19]. Meanwhile, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathway mediated by a pathogen contributes to coordination of actin rearrangement, thereby leading to internalization of the organism [20]. A study has suggested that the activated PI3K/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway is implicated in lung tumorigenesis and it has been related to high-grade tumors and advanced diseases [21]. In conclusion, this study is carried out to discuss the role of Beclin1-PI3K/AKT axis in reinfection of S. pneumoniae after influenza A virus.",

The included patients met the criteria for CAP and the criteria for SCAP in Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society guidelines in 2007 [6]. The patients were excluded from our study who met the following criteria: patients with lung neoplasms, noninfectious pulmonary interstitial diseases, pulmonary edema, atelectasis, pulmonary embolism, pulmonary eosinophil infiltration, and pulmonary vasculitis; patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome or human immunodeficiency virus infection; patients were diagnosed with tuberculosis or nontuberculosis mycobacterium infection; patients admitted to a nursing home within three months or who have used antibiotics within three months to consider cases of healthcare-associated pneumonia; patients showed lower respiratory tract infection 48 h after admission to consider cases of nosocomial pneumonia. An electro-fiberoptic bronchoscopy was used to lavage the lung segment and sublung segment of the selected patients with saline water, and 20 mL bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and sputum samples from patients with CAP were collected for further detection. Additionally, BALF samples, obtained from foreign bodies in the bronchus, from 15 healthy controls were collected as controls, including nine males and six females, whose age was between 18 and 45 years, with the mean age of 33 years.",

By detecting the respiratory viruses in the clinical samples of BALF, we found that 31 cases (51.67%) were positive in the sputum sample while 45 cases (75.00%) were positive in BALF sample (p < 0.05; Table 3). These results suggested that BALF sampling was superior to traditional sputum sampling in the detection of bacterial pathogens in pneumonia. In order to investigate whether the pathogenesis of reinfection pneumonia was related to the Beclin1-PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, we examined the expression of related genes in alveolar epithelial cells of BALF in 16 viral positive patients. The expression of Beclin1 in BALF was significantly lower than that in sputum of patients with reinfection pneumonia (p < 0.05), and the expression of Beclin1 in BALF of viral positive patients further decreased (p < 0.05; Fig. 1a). Five cases were randomly selected from each group, and then determination of the Beclin1-PI3K/AKT pathway-related proteins (Fig. 1b, c) suggested that in contrast to the normal group, levels of p-PI3K/PI3K, p-AKT/AKT, and p-mTOR/mTOR increased while the protein expression of Beclin1 decreased in the Pne and the Flu + Pne group (all p < 0.05). Relative to the Pne group, levels of p-PI3K/PI3K, p-AKT/AKT, and p-mTOR/mTOR further increased while the expression of Beclin1 further decreased in the Flu + Pne group (all p < 0.05), suggesting that Beclin1 is downregulated and the PI3K/AKT pathway is activated in reinfection pneumonia.",

Compared with the control group and Flu group, the survival rate of mice significantly decreased in the SP group, and further decreased in the Flu + SP group (p < 0.05; Fig. 2a). The amount of virus detected in the lungs of the mice showed that the number of H1N1 influenza viruses in the Flu and Flu + SP groups increased significantly on the 5th day compared with the 1st day (Fig. 2b).

However, in the SP group, inflammatory cell infiltration, alveolar collapse, perivascular, and peribronchiole edema were found in the lung tissue of mice. What is more, the lung injury in the Flu + SP group was more serious than that in the SP group (Fig. 2e).

Due to the increasing resistance among respiratory pathogens, together with the fact that S. pneumoniae is considered as the most common etiologic agent that is identified in CAP, the strategies for antimicrobial therapy should no doubt based upon the causative pathogen, local resistance patterns as well as the risk factors for infection with resistant bacteria [3]. However, the causative agents of CAP have not been routinely determined in China, especially in some severe cases. In this present study, we aim to discuss the molecular mechanism of reinfection of bacteria plus virus, figuring out the role of Beclin1-PI3K/AKT axis in reinfection of S. pneumoniae after influenza A virus. Collectively, we came to a conclusion that the inhibition of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway or overexpressed Beclin1 is in favor of suppressing the reinfection of S. pneumoniae after influenza A virus infection in SCAP.",

BAL uses sterile fluid to wash pathogens directly. BAL has been widely applicable for adults and children in the determination of the reason of ventilator-associated pneumonia, nosocomial pneumonia, severe CAP, or recalcitrant pneumonia [14]. Additionally, BALF is suggested to be easily suitable for multiple detection methods, such as microscopy, aerobic culture, PCR as well as viral culture [15]. BAL is a noninvasive method, hence safe for patients. A previous study has suggested that BAL could be a useful tool in the identification of pathogens in ventilator-associated pneumonia, or in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure which requires noninvasive ventilation [31]. Another literature also has elucidated the utility of BAL acting as a less invasive option for the assessment of lung pathology, which could also aids in the diagnosis of Cytomegalovirus pneumonitis using molecular methods [32]. Therefore, BAL is an accurate and safe method to validate pathogens in pneumonia.",

Besides pneumonia, similar to our study, a study revealed that Beclin1 expression was markedly downregulated in cartilage tissue of osteoarthritis [33]. And it has been reported that Beclin1 is component in the PI3K complex and it is also a target of the kinase AKT [19]. Several studies have elucidated that the activation of PI3K happens in host cells during the invasive process by Streptococcus agalactiae (S. agalactiae), and the involvement of PI3K has been detected during the invasion process of S. agalactiae together with other human pathogens [34, 35], which suggests a responsive inflammation occur. A recent study has suggested that the activation of AKT is of great importance for engulfment of P. aeruginosa, a extracellular pathogen, and the loss of bacterial motility results in a corresponding loss of stimulation and phagocytosis of AKT [36]. Taken together, the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway collaborates with Beclin1 to regulate pneumonia progression.",

Beclin1 regulates autophagy initiation through interaction with Atg14/ATG14L/Barkor (Complex I) and regulates vacuolar protein sorting, cytokinesis as well as receptor degradation by regulating Vps38/UVRAG (Complex II) [17]. And it is demonstrated that ectopic Beclin1 expression suppressed cancer cell proliferation in vitro and tumorigenic potential in vivo, thereby implying a role for autophagy in tumor suppression [18]. As for the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, it is a signal transduction pathway that is implicated in the regulation of a great deal of cellular functions, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, adhesion, and invasion [37]. It is reported that the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway is frequently initiated through the regulation of trans-membrane receptor signaling, which is followed by activation of Src kinases to recruit and activate PI3K [38]. Kierbal et al. have observed that blockade of cellular PI3K activity is able to prevent P. aeruginosa entry into both kidney and HeLa epithelial cells [39]. Therefore, it is promising to target Beclin1-PI3K/AKT for pneumonia treatment.",
