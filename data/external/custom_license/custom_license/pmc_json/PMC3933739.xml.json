Ultrastructural analysis of CoV have revealed that they form pleomorphic particles that are roughly spherical but show variations in size (80\u2013120 nm in diameter) and shape [7\u201310]. The entire CoV replication cycle take places in the cytoplasm. In general, enveloped viruses are able to use a variety of cellular membranes at different steps of their life cycles. In fact, almost any membranous subcellular compartment appears to be used by particular viruses to support their replication complex and assembly process [10, 11]. Coronaviridae family causes various diseases including bronchitis, gastroenteritis, hepatitis systemic diseases and etc. on humans, animal and birds [12, 13]. Both host and viral factors affect the coronavirus virulence and the disease severity in animals. The disease is generally most severe in newborns [14].",

The SARS-CoV alarmed the world because it sickened more than 8,000 people and killed nearly 800 of them [16]. Recently, a novel coronavirus caused respiratory infectious disease with high mortality. The virus is called Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). This novel MERS-CoV was first reported in Saudi Arabia and eight other countries in 2012 [17]. Currently, there are no approved drugs against CoVs but some potential therapies have been proposed.",

The nsp3 interacts with N protein through its EF motif site that contains a calcium binding domain, which can mean that this interaction could depend on calcium. It has been shown that intracellular calcium signaling triggers the elevation of reactive oxygen species in mitochondria that effect replication of influenza virus [19]. Also poliovirus infection increases intracellular calcium concentration [20]. These findings suggest that intracellular calcium concentration might be important for viral replication; therefore viruses may be targeting cellular mechanisms that regulate this concentration.",

The transient receptor potential proteins (TRPs) is group of ion channels family that are responsible for a wide range of cellular functions including adjusting intracellular Ca2+ concentration [21]. The TRP superfamily can be divided into seven families: TRPC (canonical), TRPV (vanilloid), TRPM (melastatin), TRPN and TRPA (ankyrin), TRPML (mucolipin) and TRPP (polycystin) [22]. TRP channels are triggered by a many different stimuli such as; growth factors, chemicals, temperature, depletion of intracellular calcium level and etc. Triggering mechanism of channels and selectivity can be different between the TRPs [23]. The expression levels of TRPM and TRPV families have been associated with tumor growth and progression [23\u201325].",

IL-8 levels increased following treatment by Ns, Ah and Cs extracts for both 1/50 and 1/100 dilutions at 24 h. However IL-8 levels had decreased at 48 h for Ah and Cs treated cells.

Together with the data showing that virus loads were decreased upon extract treatments we predicted that TRP genes might be involved in CoV survival inside cells. Considering that replication of other viruses were related to intracellular calcium concentration and TRPs modulate ion concentrations, including calcium we measured intracellular calcium concentrations and found that they increased following plant extract treatments of infected cells. The controversial TRP gene expression and calcium concentration results suggest that they may not be related to decreased viral loads in plant extract treated infected cells or decreased TRP gene expression and/or increased calcium concentration decrease viral loads through unknown mechanisms. Undetectable levels of the virus after Ah treatment can mean a specific factor being involved following that treatment and this factor can be the TRPV4 gene, whose expression went down only in the case of Ah treatment for both 6 and 8 h time points. Currently there is no literature tying TRP genes to viral survival.",

Further research is required in order to identify the specific ingredient(s) in the extracts that led to this phenotype and also to identify the mechanism by which it prevents virus replication or leads to more efficient virus killing. Undetectable virus loads after Ah extract treatment can mean future research can identify certain molecule(s) in Ah extract that can be used as highly effective drugs against not only CoV but also other viruses as well.\n",
