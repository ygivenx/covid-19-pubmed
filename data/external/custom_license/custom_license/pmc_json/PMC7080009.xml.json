This appearance is termed \u201cround pneumonia\u201d and is most commonly caused by bacteria. A round opacity in adults is suspicious for malignancy, whereas in children it is likely to represent a benign process [2]. In a child with symptoms and signs of pneumonia and a round opacity on the chest radiographs, the diagnosis is most likely round pneumonia. However, one has to be aware of other pathologies that can present a similar imaging appearance in children [3]. In this essay, we discuss the etiology and clinical and radiographic features of round pneumonia, as well as its less common mimickers. Awareness of radiographic mimickers can prevent diagnostic pitfalls, unnecessary tests and radiation, as well as assist in improving patient care.",

Pores of Kohn are openings that develop between adjacent alveoli (interalveolar connections). The channels of Lambert are bronchoalveolar channels that involve the terminal bronchioles opening into alveolar sacs. These structures function as collateral circulation and allow the passage of fluid or bacteria. With developed collaterals, the infection can spread easily into adjacent alveolar sacs and throughout the lobe. With less developed collaterals, there is centrifugal spread, and the consolidation is spherical with sharp margins. These factors result a slow progression of the disease and a higher chance of detecting the infection in children. There is a preferential posterior and lower lobe distribution of round pneumonia, likely resulting from gravity and a supine position while sleeping [4, 5].",

Chest radiographs typically reveal a circumscribed, homogeneous spherical lesion greater than 3 cm (range 1\u201312 cm). The definition of the margins of the round opacity decreases with increasing age, indicating more developed collateral circulation (Fig. 2). Satellite lesions are sometimes present, and air bronchograms can be seen in up to 20% of cases. Round pneumonia does not characteristically demonstrate calcifications, cavitations, lymphadenopathy or pleural effusions.

After appropriate treatment, a follow-up radiograph is useful to ensure resolution. There are no evidence-based guidelines regarding the appropriate radiographic follow-up of children with round pneumonia. However, the literature on round pneumonia suggests a follow-up chest radiograph 10\u201314 days after appropriate antibiotic therapy.

In the absence of an air-fluid level, pulmonary abscesses can mimic round pneumonia on radiographs (Fig. 6). There is a resurgence of childhood pulmonary TB in developed countries because of HIV infection, overcrowding and immigration [17]. Although mediastinal and hilar adenopathy is common in children with tuberculosis, parenchymal opacities occur in the form of consolidation. Tuberculosis can present as any type of parenchymal opacity, such as round (Fig. 7), patchy, linear or mass-like. Ghon complex (a.k.a. Ranke complex) refers to the parenchymal lesion of primary pulmonary tuberculosis associated with a corresponding lymph node. Even though the primary complex of tuberculosis can involve any part of the lung, the middle lobe is the least involved [18]. Radiologists must look carefully for adenopathy, a distinguishing feature that is very common in pediatric tuberculosis. The right hilum is more commonly involved because of the pattern of lymphatic circulation through the lungs. A right-side parenchymal lesion leads to right hilar adenopathy. On the other hand, a left-side lesion can lead to bilateral hilar adenopathy [19].\n\n\n",

However, by definition, there is no systemic arterial supply in a CPAM, whereas sequestrations have a systemic arterial supply [26]. CPAM, sequestrations and congenital lobar hyperinflation can appear as round opacities on chest radiographs on a newborn due to the lack of focal reabsorption of the parenchymal fluid within the lesion. In this period, age is a differentiating feature, as round pneumonias and even lobar pneumonias are exceedingly rare in the first few months of life. CPAM Type 3, because of its microcystic nature, typically presents as a round, solid mass most similar to a round pneumonia.",

In a very small percentage of cases, pulmonary involvement is the first manifestation of lymphoma (Fig. 10) [29]. Further investigation should be prompted if a process different from round pneumonia is suggested by the clinical presentation and careful scrutinization of the radiographs. For example, an apparent round pneumonia in a posteromedial location with erosion of adjacent bony structures is a neuroblastoma until proved otherwise (Fig. 11) [30]. Thoracic neuroblastomas are typically posterior mediastinal in location, have associated calcification (50%) and rib destruction, and occur within the age range of round pneumonia [31]. Other pleural-based or even chest wall lesions, when large, can be diagnostic dilemmas on radiographs. Basic radiological signs are very helpful in deciding whether the lesion is parenchymal, pleural, mediastinal or within the chest wall (Fig. 12). Lesions in each of these locations can appear as round opacities, but careful evaluation of the radiographs can in most cases, determine the correct location.\n\n\n\n",

In these cases, attention to radiographic signs will usually suggest a typical anterior or posterior location, as in the case of Morgagni and Bochdalek hernias, respectively. Small hernias can also present as a solitary pulmonary nodule [32]. The presence of air-fluid-containing structures, such as bowel or very sharp margins, can help distinguish against round pneumonia. The fluid-filled or collapsed bowel loops within the hemithorax have a homogeneously opaque appearance. Less commonly, bowel becomes entrapped in a small hernia, producing a large pleural effusion.

This is different from adult imaging, in which malignant processes predominate. With appropriate antibiotic therapy, a follow-up frontal radiograph to ensure improvement or resolution can confirm the round pneumonia diagnosis. In a child with clinical symptoms and signs of pneumonia, even if the round opacity has atypical features on chest radiographs, round pneumonia is still the likely diagnosis. One needs to recognize the clinical scenario and the mimics of round pneumonia.
