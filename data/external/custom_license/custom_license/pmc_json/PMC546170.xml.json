Here, critical advances have come from the development of nucleotide analogues with improved properties over natural nucleotides and recently several of these such as phosphorothioates (8,9), 2\u2032-O-Me (10,11), 2\u2032-O-allyl (10) and 2\u2032-deoxy-fluorouridine (8,9) have been examined as a means to improve the prospect for siRNA therapy. Briefly, these studies have demonstrated that siRNAs can accommodate quite a number of modifications at both base-paired and non-base-paired positions without significant loss of activity. Moreover, some of the modified siRNAs were found to exhibit enhanced serum stability (11) and longer duration of action (10). Modification of the 5\u2032 end of the antisense strand with 2\u2032-O-allyl (10) or chemical blocking of the 5\u2032-hydroxyl group (11) resulted in a dramatic loss in activity consistent with the proposed in vivo requirement for 5\u2032 end phosphorylation. Also, more substantial modifications, such as total modification by 2\u2032-O-Me (8) or PS modifications of every second or all internucleoside linkages (8,9) increased cytotoxic effects and resulted in a significant decrease or complete loss of activity.",

When used in antisense constructs, LNA has been reported to combine substantially increased potency in vitro and in vivo with minimal toxicity (12\u201317). Also, the commonly used LNA contains a methylene bridge connecting the 2\u2032-oxygen with the 4\u2032-carbon of the ribose ring. This bridge locks the ribose ring in the 3\u2032-endo conformation characteristic of RNA (18\u201321). As such, LNA is a prime candidate for introducing critical new features into siRNAs without perturbing the overall A-form helical structure they require for activity (22).",

In this report, we expand on these early findings by systematically pursuing the construction and biological testing of LNA-modified siRNA molecules, hereafter termed siLNA, aiming at in vivo applications. We show that LNA is substantially compatible with the siRNA machinery, and that siLNAs exhibit greatly improved bio-stability and shows enhanced inhibition at certain RNA targets. We further show that LNA can be used to reduce sequence-related off-target effects by either lowering incorporation of the siRNA sense-strand and/or by reducing the ability of inappropriately loaded sense-strands to cleave the target RNA.",

A priori, this suggests that LNA may be used to increase the functional half-life of siRNA in vivo by two different mechanisms, e.g. by enhancing the resistance of the constituent RNA strands against degradation by single-stranded RNases and by stabilizing the siRNA duplex structure that is critical for activity. To investigate how these mechanisms influence overall biostability, we assessed the integrity in fetal bovine serum, as well as human and mouse serum, of either unmodified siRNA or siLNAs that were modified to enhance exonuclease resistance (siLNA5) or further modified to also increase duplex stability (siLNA7). Briefly, siLNA5 has LNA modifications at the 3\u2032 ends and exhibits a duplex stability similar to the unmodified siRNA1 (Tm = 69.7\u00b0C for siLNA5 and 70.5\u00b0C for siRNA1) whereas siLNA7 has six additional duplex stabilizing sense strand modifications at base-paired positions which increases its Tm to >90\u00b0C. As shown in Figure 1a and b, unmodified siRNA (siRNA1) was markedly degraded after 6 h during which it produces a smear of faster migrating species. A similar diffuse band was not observed with the 3\u2032 end protected siLNA5, which in contrast to the unmodified siRNA showed only weak signs of degradation after 24 h. The more modified siLNA7 had a striking stability and showed no signs of degradation even at 48 h. When incubated in either undiluted human or mouse serum (Figure 1c and d), the unmodified siRNA1 were fully degraded within 6 h. An increased degradation rate was also observed with the siLNA5 where little full-length product remained at 24 h. In contrast, siLNA7 remained intact for the full 48 h of the assay in both human and mouse serum.",

As shown in Figure 2a, the firefly siRNA (siRNA1) effectively and selectively reduced firefly luciferase activity whereas an unrelated siRNA control was essentially without effect. Introduction of LNA modifications in the 3\u2032 overhangs in either or both strands of the firefly siRNA revealed no loss of inhibitory effect (siLNA1\u20133). One LNA in the 5\u2032 end of the sense strand was fully compatible with activity (siLNA4 and 5), while an LNA at the 5\u2032 end of the antisense strand (siLNA8\u201311) dramatically impaired the inhibitory effect. To exclude the possibility that this impairment was due to a lack of a 5\u2032 phosphate, which has been shown to be crucial for siRNA function (27), the 5\u2032 end of the antisense strand in siLNA8 and 11 was phosphorylated in vitro. However, this procedure did not recover any of the lost effect (data not shown). SiLNAs wherein the sense strand was modified in the 3\u2032 overhangs and at as many as seven base-paired positions (siLNA6 and 7) retained significant inhibitory activity whereas siLNAs comprising various combinations of either fully modified sense or antisense strands did not have any inhibitory effect (data not shown).",

As shown in Figure 2c, we observe the same tendency as with the firefly target. SiLNA12 and 13, carrying modifications in the 3\u2032 overhangs were as functional as unmodified Renilla siRNA (siRNA2). Again, the 5\u2032 end of the sense strand could be modified without loss of activity (siLNA14), while an LNA in the 5\u2032 antisense end significantly reduced the effect (siLNA15). Interestingly, in this case part of the activity that was lost as a result of the 5\u2032 antisense LNA (siLNA15) could be recovered by simultaneously modifying the 3\u2032 sense end (siLNA16) and even more so if modifications also included the 5\u2032 sense end (siLNA17).",

Although we cannot exclude that these modifications somehow prevent loading of the antisense strand into RISC, we believe this to be unlikely given the functionality of many significantly more modified siLNAs. Rather, as these positions are all close to the site where RNA target cleavage occurs [between pos. 10 and 11 of the siRNA strand counting from the 5\u2032 end (28)], we suspect that the LNA modifications may exert a direct conformational or functional effect on the catalytic site.",

            "text": "Figure 5: LNA improvement of medium-efficient siRNAs. (a) Renilla luciferase activity. Effect of siRNA and siLNA depending on the target sequence (siRNA4 and 5 have different target sequences, accordingly also siLNA40 and 41). (b) Effect of siRNA and siLNA on SARS-induced cytotoxicity depending on the target sequence (SARS 1\u20133). Vero cells were transfected with 85 nM siRNA or siLNA and then infected with 6000 TCID50 SARS-CoV. SARS-induced cytotoxicity was assessed 50 h later. The untransfected but infected sample was set to 100% cytotoxicity. Mean and SD values in the Renilla case are from two experiments performed in triplicate, and in the SARS case from three experiments performed in quadruplicate.",
