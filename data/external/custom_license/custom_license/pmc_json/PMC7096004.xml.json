He is currently revamping his infrastructure for the tighter security controls, during which time much of his microarray and proteomics work has been halted. He expects the renovations to cost in excess of $400,000, and, even after his lab is up to code, there could still be problems ahead for his research program.",

To advance the product further, Baric had hoped to test the experimental vaccine on larger animals, such as hamsters, ferrets or primates. Yet, the development of the vaccine requires collaboration with other labs, including the one at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, that analyzed SARS RNA for the latest paper. For that collaboration to continue, these labs will also have to upgrade their facilities to achieve biosafety level 3 (BSL3) status.",

At Novavax, for example, researchers are forging ahead with an experimental vaccine that combines two structural proteins\u2014one from SARS, the other from the influenza virus\u2014but does not involve a live virus. The Maryland-based company does not have a BSL3 lab, nor do they need one. Last year, for the mouse experiments demonstrating that the vaccine offers protection from an otherwise lethal challenge of SARS (Vaccine\n29, 6606\u20136613, 2011), the Novavax scientists simply teamed up with virologist Dale Barnard at Utah State University in Logan, which has BSL3 facilities.",

The recent cases out of the Middle East certainly prove this point.",
