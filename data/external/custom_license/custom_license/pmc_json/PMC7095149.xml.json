Two viral glycoproteins are key to this process: a variable attachment protein (HN, H or G) and a more conserved fusion (F) protein1. The attachment proteins interact with different cellular receptors. For example, SV5 HN protein binds sialic acid, measles virus H protein interacts with CD46 or CDw150/SLAM (refs 4, 5), Nipah and Hendra virus G proteins bind to Ephrin B2 (refs 6, 7) and RSV G protein binds heparin sulphate8.

F assembles into homotrimers that are proteolytically cleaved, priming the protein for membrane fusion (Fig. 1), similar to the influenza virus haemagglutinin12 (HA) and other class I viral fusion proteins such as HIV Env, Ebola virus GP and SARS coronavirus S (refs 12, 13). The uncleaved precursor (F0) is processed into a larger carboxy-terminal fragment (F1) and a smaller amino-terminal fragment (F2). F1 contains a hydrophobic fusion peptide at its N terminus and two hydrophobic, heptad repeat regions (HRA and HRB). HRA is immediately adjacent to the fusion peptide and HRB is proximal to the transmembrane domain, with about 250 residues separating the two.",

Subsequent refolding and assembly of HRA and HRB into a six-helix bundle (6HB) occurs, placing the fusion peptides and the transmembrane domains in proximity13,17. Formation of the 6HB and the associated free-energy change are tightly linked to merger of the viral and cellular membranes16,18. The isolated F 6HB structure, generated from HRA and HRB peptides17,19, is stable up to 100 \u00b0C and is thought to represent the lowest-energy conformation of the protein after membrane fusion. We previously reported the structure of the uncleaved, secreted hPIV3 F0 ectodomain (solF0), truncated before the transmembrane domain20. Unexpectedly, this structure contains the postfusion 6HB, indicating that F protein cleavage is not required to attain the postfusion conformation and that the F transmembrane domain and/or the cytoplasmic tail are important for the folding to, or stability of, the prefusion metastable state20. It remained unclear to what extent the F pre- and postfusion conformations differ21,22 and how these are linked to membrane fusion.",

The globular head contains three domains (DI\u2013DIII) identified previously20,21. DI and DII reposition as rigid modules during the conformational transition, and the main refolding occurs in DIII. Core structural elements of DIII act as a scaffold for the folding of HRA, preventing its assembly into the postfusion helical conformation. The fusion peptides at the N termini of HRA segments are sequestered between adjacent subunits, and cleavage/activation sites are exposed at the protein surface. None of the intersubunit contacts are conserved in the pre- and postfusion forms. The SV5 F structure provides a model for the stepwise induction of membrane fusion by paramyxoviruses and shows how several sequence elements have distinct structural roles in the pre- and postfusion conformations.",

Mutations of L447 and I449 to aromatic residues also destabilize the prefusion conformation31, and these larger amino acids would disrupt hydrophobic contacts.

Other mutations affect SV5 F fusion activity30,32,33,34 and can be explained similarly by their locations in the prefusion form of F. Finally, the presence of the GCNt domain, or the natural transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, undoubtedly stabilizes the HRB stalk, explaining why F-GCNt remains in the prefusion conformation, whereas secreted anchorless hPIV3 and NDV F proteins convert to the postfusion form20,21.",

We propose the following model. In the first step, the HRB helices melt (\u2018open-stalk form\u2019; Fig. 5), breaking interactions at the base of the head, but leaving HRA in the prefusion conformation. This intermediate is consistent with the effects of mutating residues 443, 447 and 449, and with peptide inhibition data. HRA-derived peptides, which probably bind to the endogenous HRB segment, inhibit an early intermediate along the fusion pathway, whereas HRB-derived peptides inhibit a later intermediate by binding the endogenous HRA coiled coil16. Opening of the HRB stalk could initiate further changes in F by affecting the packing of DII and the fusion peptide (through the HRB linker), and by affecting the stability of the head intersubunit contacts, which shift during the conformational transition. It seems possible that transient dissociation of the F trimer could occur, analogous to the dimer-to-trimer transition characterized in alphavirus and flavivirus fusion proteins35,36.",

This pre-hairpin intermediate has been trapped and co-precipitated with HRB-peptides16. Removal of the fusion peptide from the intersubunit interfaces would enable an inward swing of DII and the formation of new contacts with DI of a neighbouring subunit, compacting the head. The refolding of DIII HRA would also expose its core \u03b2-sheet and, together with the inward movement of DII, enable the HRB linker (at the C terminus of DII) to form parallel \u03b2-strands with the DIII core, probably preceding and initiating the final positioning of HRB (Fig. 5). The assembly of the final 6HB completes the conformational change and membrane merger. Although proteolytic cleavage of the F protein is required for membrane fusion activity, it is apparently not required for formation of the postfusion conformation. The role of the HN or H protein in stimulating the F conformational change remains to be elucidated, but it could exert effects by, for example, influencing the stability of the F prefusion stalk in a receptor-dependent manner.",

The folding of metastable proteins, as well as their activation, is not well understood but is a hallmark of class I viral fusion proteins such as F, influenza virus HA and HIV Env12. The F structural changes are very different from those observed in influenza virus HA12, which is the only other class I viral fusion protein for which we have both pre- and postfusion structures37,38. However, new and potentially general concepts for these protein machines emerge from a comparison of the F and HA fusion proteins: first, in the metastable state, the N-terminal (fusion-peptide-proximal) HRA segment is prevented from assembling into the postfusion coiled-coil structure; second, the fusion peptide is initially buried at subunit interfaces that undergo considerable reorganization between the pre- and postfusion states; third, refolding of HRA projects the fusion peptide away from the initial positions of the transmembrane anchors and viral membrane; and last, the C-terminal HRB region is prevented from adopting its final state both by the absence of the HRA coiled coil and by other inhibitory structural elements present in the prefusion conformation. For HIV Env, it is tempting to speculate that the gp120 \u2018inner\u2019 domain, which switches conformation between the free and receptor-bound states, could act similarly to the F DIII core by regulating the folding of the HRA segment of HIV gp41 (refs 39, 40).

All crystals belong to space group C2221. Native data set 1 (in Tris-HCl) was collected to 3.0 \u00c5 and native data set 2 (in imidazole buffer) was collected to 2.85 \u00c5 (Supplementary Table 2). Crystals soaked with heavy atoms (10 mM OsCl3, 1 mM PiP (di-\u00b5-iodobis(ethylenediamine)diplatinum(ii) nitrate) or 20 mM AuCN2) were collected to 4.5 \u00c5 (Supplementary Table 3).

Using three platinum sites, four gold sites and three osmium sites, we obtained an initial 4.5 \u00c5 density-modified map and associated phases. These were used to position individual domains (DI\u2013DIII) and a three-helix bundle from the hPIV3 F structure by using the six-dimensional phased translation search implemented in BRUTEPTF47. The search resulted in good solutions for parts of each of DI\u2013DIII and a three-helix bundle20 that matched the observed electron density and could also be arranged as a three-fold symmetric trimer. The original experimental phases after solvent flattening were used, along with a partial molecular envelope and subunit NCS transformations based on this preliminary trimer model, as input to the program DM43. Density modification and three-fold NCS averaging were carried out with phase extension from 8 to 3.0 \u00c5 resolution in 1,500 steps, yielding a readily interpretable electron density map.",

After several rounds of manual rebuilding and refinement, the 2.85-\u00c5 native data set 2 was used to complete the model rebuilding and refinement after transferring the original Rfree set. To improve the electron density for difficult regions, model phases were input into SHARP to improve the heavy-atom model and refinement. Additional heavy-atom sites were identified (Supplementary Table 3), and the resulting SHARP/Solomon electron density maps were of higher quality, enabling the HRB linker and C-terminal GCNt residues to be traced. The final structure has an Rwork of 22.2% and an Rfree of 26.1%. A Ramachandran plot shows that 99.3% of the residues are in the most favourable or additionally allowed regions.
