These pathogens became known after extensive surveys of bats following outbreaks. As a first step in investigating unidentified pathogens in bats and to help forecast the potential threat of emerging infectious diseases, we tried to isolate and characterize viruses that persistently infect bats. In the process, we isolated a novel adenovirus from a fruit bat in Japan.",

With the permission of the governor of Okinawa, we caught 1 adult male bat of this species and used its spleen and kidneys to establish primary cell cultures. On the 4th passage of the primary adherent cells derived from the spleen, a cytopathic effect (CPE) appeared without any visible microbe, indicating that the cell culture contained a virus. The virus, tentatively named Ryukyu virus 1 (RV1), caused apparent CPE on primary kidney cells derived from a Ryukyu flying fox and on our established bat kidney T1 (BKT1) cells, which were derived from the kidney of a horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) and transformed with expression plasmid DNA encoding the large T antigen of replication origin-defective simian virus 40.",

However, no viral nucleic acid sequence was detected from an RNA sample in the RV1-infected BKT1 cells. For detection of viral DNA, we developed a system for rapid determination of viral DNA sequences (RDV-D) by minor modification to the RDV system for RNA viruses (2\u20134). The results indicated that 2 of the fragments were homologous to the gene encoding the precursor of terminal protein (pTP) of adenoviruses. Further RDV-D analysis showed that 6 fragments (139 bp, DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank accession no. AB302970) were homologous to the pTP gene and that another 6 fragments (316bp, DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank accession no. AB302971) were homologous to the gene encoding the precursor of protein VI (pVI) of adenoviruses. These results indicated that RV1 must belong to the family Adenoviridae.",

A fragment of \u2248550 bp was amplified from RV1 as well as from human adenoviruses-1, -3, -4, and -7 (data not shown). Sequence analysis of the amplified product (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank accession no.

In addition, a phylogenic tree based on amino acid sequences indicated that RV1 belongs to family Adenoviridae, genus Mastadenovirus (Figure).",

The isolation of the novel adenovirus seems to be possible because of usage of the primary cells originated from the host; DNA viruses might have more restricted host range than RNA viruses and require host-originated cells for the growth. In addition, our success in DNA virus isolation might have resulted from usage of the adult animal latently and persistently infected with DNA viruses such as adenovirus and herpesvirus.",
