Gao reported the clinical characteristics of affected patients. Fever and cough were the most common symptoms; 98 of 111 patients (88.3 %) had lymphocytopenia and 44 (39.6 %) had thrombocytopenia [1]. Bilateral ground-glass opacities and consolidation were typical radiology findings [2]. In this work we investigated CT image changes and persistence of lymphocytopenia, to determine the correlation with resolution of pneumonitis and recovery from lymphocytopenia.",

CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are related to viral immunity and lack of these cells would lead to a delay in viral clearance and increased mortality [6, 7]. In our study, it is hypothesized that lack of lymphocytes could result in disease progression, then recovery from lymphopenia together with pneumonitis resolution. As support, a correlation can be established between the time to recovery from lymphopenia and the time to resolution of the chest CT findings.
