All the information on the spike mutations in 48 patients and their sampling dates are summarized in Appendix Tables 1 and 2. The timelines of the detection of spike mutations are depicted in Figure 1. We focused on 2 mutations (D510G and I529T) in the RBD region because these 2 novel mutations substantially reduced MERS-CoV affinity to human receptor CD26 and were observed in multiple patients during the outbreak (6). In addition, no nonsynonymous spike mutation was consistently associated with the 2 spike mutations (Appendix Table 2). Wild-type MERS-CoV was detected in the index patient (P001) on May 19, 2015; however, the I529T mutation was observed 3 days later (May 22, 2015), suggesting that the I529T mutation emerged within 11 days after symptom onset. The potential change in spike gene is consistent with the fact that early contactors (P002, P009, and P010) with P001 also carried the wild-type virus, but most of the subsequent patients, including 2 superspreaders (P014 and P016), were infected with I529T mutant viruses. Moreover, the second mutation (D510G) was first detected in P014. The respiratory sample collected from P014 on June 1, 2015, included mixed spike sequences (wild-type, I529T, or D510G) and a rare double mutation (D510G\u2013I529T) (11). Even though most of the patients infected by P014 carried MERS-CoV with the I529T mutation, the second mutant D510G was transiently or consistently observed in some of the tertiary and quaternary cases (P050, P066, P080, P122, P155, and P168) (11). These results indicate that P014 initially harbored mixed wild-type and I529T mutant viruses and generated the D510G mutation, but the I529T mutant virus dominated the exposure period. In addition, this patient spread both mutants simultaneously during subsequent human-to-human transmission. The D510G mutant was detected only in the patient group infected by P014 but not in those infected by P001 or P016, further indicating that P014 is the probable origin of the D510G mutation. The I529T mutant was initially dominant in 2 patients (P077 and P080), but wild-type MERS-CoV later overtook as the major population, suggesting a fluctuation of wild-type and mutant viruses in the hosts.",

We reviewed the clinical data of 48 patients for whom virus spike sequence information was available and classified them into 4 groups on the basis of disease severity and death rates during the MERS outbreak (Table; Appendix Table 1) (12). Group I includes 6 persons who were asymptomatic or had fever without pneumonia. Group II includes 19 patients who had mild pneumonia without hypoxemia. Twelve persons who recovered from more prolonged and severe pneumonia are classified as group III. Group III subjects experienced hypoxemia and were treated with oxygen during hospitalization. Eleven patients who died from acute respiratory distress syndrome are classified as group IV. Baseline characteristics of the patients, including exposure period, date of symptom onset, and fever duration, are summarized (Figure 1; Appendix Table 1). Initially, we assessed the potential association of spike mutations with disease severity (Table), but could not observe any statistically significant association of MERS severity with spike mutations or mixed spike genotype infection. However, the average days of fever duration in MERS patients was generally longer in cases associated with wild-type virus (mean + SD, 18 + 6 days) or mixed infection including wild-type (mean + SD, 16 + 14 days) compared with fevers in patients infected only with I520T (mean + SD, 11 + 8 days) or D510G (mean + SD, 10 + 8) mutant (Figure 2, panel A). Even though differences in fever duration between the patient group associated with wild-type virus, including mixed infection (17 + 12 days), and those infected only with either of the mutant viruses (mean + SD, 11 + 7 days) are statistically marginal (p = 0.0654) (Figure 2, panel B), potentially because of limited data, the reduction of fever duration in patients associated only with the primary and secondary mutations seems to be consistent.",

The average size of viral plaques formed by I529T mutant MERS-CoV (mean + SD, 0.49 + 0.15 mm2) was significantly smaller (\u224823%) than that of wild-type virus (mean + SD, 0.64 + 0.21 mm2) in Vero E6 cells (Figure 2, panel C). It was consistently observed in a human embryonic kidney cell line, 293T cells overexpressing human CD26 (293T\u2013CD26) (Figure 2, panel D). The average size of plaques induced by I529T mutant (mean + SD, 0.08 + 0.07 mm2) was also smaller (\u224825%) than that of wild-type MERS-CoV (mean + SD, 0.06 + 0.05 mm2) in 293T\u2013CD26 cells.

We performed a 50% pseudoparticle neutralization test assay on wild-type and mutant spike-pseudotyped lentiviruses and then compared their neutralizing efficacy. Average titers of serum samples from the immunized mice showed gradually decreased neutralization of I529T (mean + SD, 1,727 + 897) or D510G mutant viruses (1,009 + 482) than wild-type virus (mean + SD, 2,629 + 1,384) (Figure 3, panel A), demonstrating that the mutant viruses are neutralization escapers. Finally, we measured the neutralizing antibody titers (using a 50% plaque reduction neutralization test [PRNT50]) against MERS-CoV bearing wild-type and I529T mutant in serum samples from the 3 recovered patients (P002, P009, and P010) who carried only wild-type MERS-CoV. Neutralizing efficacy (PRNT50 titers) of the serum samples against wild-type MERS-CoV were consistently higher than those against I529T mutant MERS-CoV (Figure 3, panel B). Average PRNT50 titers of the 3 serum samples against wild-type (mean + SD, 2,943 + 2,994) were 3.3-fold higher than those against I529T mutant MERS-CoV (mean + SD, 888 + 723), indicating that I529T mutant MERS-CoV escapes better from neutralizing antibodies generated by infection with wild-type virus. PRNT50 titers of serum samples from P009 and P010, who had more severe disease, were higher than those of P002, who had only mild symptoms.",

Such superspreading persons have been well documented in a previous severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic and recent ongoing MERS outbreaks (13). Although the underlying biologic causes and determinants of superspreading are still poorly understood, superspreading events of zoonotic coronaviruses might be related to higher levels of virus shedding for prolonged periods of uncontrolled exposure to susceptible contacts early in the outbreak, before the need for infection control is appreciated (5). Our study systemically assesses MERS-CoV genetic changes during the 2015 MERS outbreak in Korea and highlights potential biologic factors associated with the short-term evolutionary pathway of zoonotic coronavirus adapting to the human population in the context of superspreading events.",

In this study, we showed that antibodies generated in immunized mice with wild-type spike antigen or in human patients who had recovered from wild-type MERS-CoV infection were generally less efficient at neutralizing the mutant virus bearing I529T or D510G spike mutations than wild-type virus (Figure 3). In addition, in vitro virus growth of I529T mutant MERS-CoV, its cell-to-cell spread, or both are significantly reduced compared with that of wild-type virus (Figure 2, panel C and D). Given that there are only 2 amino acid differences in spike RBD (I529T and V534L) and 5 nonsynonymous nucleotide changes throughout the whole virus genome (GenBank accession no. KT029139.1 for wild-type and KT868873.1 for I529T mutant) between the wild-type and I529T mutant isolates from Korea used in this study, the difference in plaque sizes is primarily attributable to the spike mutation (Appendix Table 3). A recent study demonstrated that changes D510G or I529T increased resistance of spike protein\u2013driven entry to neutralization by monoclonal antibodies and serum from MERS patients (10). The study also confirmed that changes D510G or I529T reduced spike protein binding to CD26 but showed that this reduction only translates into diminished virus entry when expression of CD26 on target cells is low (10). Neither mutation modulated spike protein binding to sialic acids, spike protein activation by host cell proteases, or inhibition of spike protein\u2013driven entry by interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (10). In this study, however, we consistently observed that the average size of viral plaques formed by the mutant MERS-CoV bearing I529T mutation was significantly reduced in 2 types of permissive cells, Vero E6 and HEK293T-CD26 cells expressing high levels of CD26 (14,15), compared with that of wild-type MERS-CoV (Figure 2C and 2D).

That study proposed that 1 CD26 molecule might cross-link 2 MERS-CoV spike trimers by binding to standing RBDs, 1 from each trimer, whereas the monomeric ACE2 receptor will bind to the SARS-CoV spike trimer with 1 receptor to 1 spike trimer, enabling MERS-CoV to have higher avidity to receptor binding than SARS-CoV (20). Inherent differences in avidity to the cellular receptors of spike trimers might partially explain why these 2 animal coronaviruses evolved in opposing directions in terms of receptor affinity when they switch hosts to the human population; spike mutations with higher affinity might be the only way to ensure successful human-to-human transmission in SARS-CoV with intrinsic lower avidity, whereas the higher spike avidity of MERS-CoV might afford the virus to have spike mutations with lower affinity to human receptors for increased antibody escape. Therefore, a vaccine immunogen designed to broadly raise neutralizing antibodies would preferably target the conserved and surface exposed stem region rather than RBD (20). Recently, a study showed that single mutations can make influenza virus completely resistant to both narrow strain-specific antibodies and a broad antibody that targets residues in hemagglutinin RBD, whereas broad antibodies to hemagglutinin\u2019s stalk are more resistant to virus escape through single mutations (21).",

Wild-type virus was dominant in several tertiary patients (e.g., P077 and P080) at the later stage of infection, although mutant virus was the major population in the earlier stage (Figure 1). P077 had hypotension, chronic respiratory disease, and pancreatitis. P080 had lymphoma and respiratory illness before infection by P014. P077 died 13 days after symptom onset, and P080 died of lymphoma 174 days after symptom onset. In both cases, wild-type and mutant viruses were detected initially (11), suggesting a mixed infection from P014, and the patient might have suffered from immunosuppression upon virus infection either by initial high viral load (in the case of P077), as observed in other fatal cases (12), or by previous cancer treatment (in the case of P080). Failing adaptive immunity in these patients might provide a specific environment that allowed wild-type virus with higher affinity to host to resurge among the mixed population in the later stage of infection. Indeed, serial samples from P077 and P080 show a substantial decrease in normalized leukocyte count and a simultaneous increase in the frequency of the wild-type allele (11). Again, these results suggest that the selection pressure exerted by the host immune response might favor variants with reduced affinity to the host receptor, but wild-type virus with high affinity is dominant when immune pressure is reduced.
