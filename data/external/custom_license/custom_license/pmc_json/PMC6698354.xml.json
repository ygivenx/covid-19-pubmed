In comparison with the numerical values of multiple groups, ANOVA was used for variables with normal distribution and Kruskal Vallis test was used for variables with no normal distribution. Comparison of categorical variables was carried out by chi-square test and Fisher Exact test. The most effective presenting finding on mortality was revealed with regression analysis. Multivariate regression analysis was performed for determining mortality risk factor. Critical pH and pCO2 value were found with the ROC curve. ROC analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship between blood pH and mortality. The p-value <0.05 was considered as significant. The results were evaluated using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences - SPSS 17 (Chicago, USA) program.",

In line with this, our study group shows a very high mortality rate as 7.6%, which supports the justification of this multicenter survey. Although respiratory tract viruses commonly cause lower respiratory tract infections, presentation with extrapulmonary clinical manifestations are also likely in children under one year of age.8,19 Similarly, the most common cause of hospitalization was respiratory symptoms in our study. Fever, neurological symptoms, circulatory disorders, and shock were more common indications for hospitalization in patients under one year compared to older children (Table 2). In patients over one year of age presenting with respiratory symptoms, hypoxia as well as a need for MV were more common. We attributed this situation to RSV, which was more frequently observed in this age group. In the literature, RSV is more prevalent in infancy for PICU admission though influenza and bocavirus that was more common in our patients less than one year of age.1,9,10",

It was observed that presenting symptoms that have an effect on mortality were neurologic symptoms, hypotension, tachycardia, and hypoxia. It was also found that liver and renal function test abnormalities, higher lactate values were related with death. Eighty-seven percent of mortalities are presented with acidosis (Table 1). The critical pH value related with mortality and critical PCO2 was \u22647.10 and \u226560 mm Hg, respectively. In regression analysis, acidosis alone was found to increase mortality by 2.5 folds. In the light of these findings, it can be predicted that patients with neurological symptoms, tachycardia, hypotension, low levels of pulse sO2, acidosis, and impaired liver or renal function at the time of admission will have a higher morbidity and mortality.",

We found that antiviral therapy did not affect mortality (Table 5) including the influenza subgroup. Though, there are studies in literature showing that oseltamivir initiated in the early period was effective.37\u201339 However, weakness of our study is that the data we gathered is not capable of differentiating the initiation timing for antiviral therapy. Further studies are needed for this issue. Influenza is already known as the only agent that benefits from oseltamivir. When we separately evaluated the influenza subgroup, we found the median patient age as 41 months and higher PRISM and PELOD scores compared with rest of the viral agents. Influenza was more common in older children and progressed more severely. Therefore, oseltamivir can be preferred in children especially over one year of age and who presented with more severe symptoms because they are more likely to have influenza.",

Respiratory symptoms were common and besides respiratory symptoms, incidence of circulatory disorders and shock findings were also high in patients less than one year of age. Fever, tachycardia, neurologic symptoms, the incidence of anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, impaired renal tests, and electrolyte imbalance were high in patients less than one year of age. Consequently, acidosis and MODS at the time of admission or a patient less than one year of age with symptoms mentioned above should alert clinicians for a possible poor prognosis. Although we could not show the relationship of virus type with severity and mortality, RSV, parainfluenza, and influenza were the commonly isolated viruses in the patients who died. Coronavirus was found as the most lethal virus. Although coronavirus is known as the primary agent of upper respiratory tract infection and common cold, this result of our study can be attributed to the incidence of secondary bacterial infections being high in the patients with coronavirus detected. With this context, further studies are needed to investigate the relationship between coronavirus and mortality.",
