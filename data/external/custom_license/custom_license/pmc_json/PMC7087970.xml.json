            "text": "DNA methylation is an epigenetic change that results in the addition of a methyl group at the carbon-5 position of cytosine residues. DNA methyltransferase enzymes (DNMTs) mediate this process. To date, three types of DNMTs have been identified in the human genome, including the two de novo methyltransferases (DNMT3A and DNMT3B) and the maintenance methyltransferase (DNMT1), which is the most abundant among the three [1\u20133]. DNMT1 is responsible for duplicating the pattern of DNA methylation during replication, it is essential for proper mammalian development, and it has been proposed as the more interesting target for experimental cancer therapies [4]. DNA methylation represents a central mechanism for mediating epigenetic gene regulation. Thus, the development of DNMT inhibitors provides novel opportunities for cancer therapy [1, 5\u20137]. It is worth nothing that epigenetic alterations are not only associated with cancer but also with psychiatric and other diseases [8\u201310].",

The mechanism of DNA cytosine-C5 methylation is schematically depicted in Fig. 1 [4, 14, 15]. DNMT forms a complex with DNA and the cytosine which will be methylated flips out from the DNA. The thiol of the catalytic cysteine acts as a nucleophile that attacks the 6-position of the target cytosine to generate a covalent intermediate. The 5-position of the cytosine is activated and conducts a nucleophilic attack on the cofactor S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) to form the 5-methyl covalent adduct and S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH). The attack on the 6-position is assisted by a transient protonation of the cytosine ring at the endocyclic nitrogen atom N3, which is stabilized by a glutamate residue. An arginine residue may participate in the stabilization of the intermediate making a hydrogen bonding interaction with the carbonyl oxygen of cytosine. The covalent complex between the methylated base and the DNA is resolved by deprotonation at the 5-position to generate the methylated cytosine and the free enzyme.\n\n",

Molecular docking of 5,5-methylenedisalicylic acid with an homology model of the catalytic domain of DNMT1 indicated the key role of the carboxylic acids in the binding recognition including hydrogen bonds with amino acid residues that are involved in the catalytic mechanism of methylation [25]. Recently, researchers have shown an increased interest in the biological activity of 5,5-methylenedisalicylic acid and related compounds. For example, 5,5-methylenedisalicylic acid also emerged as an experimentally validated hit of a virtual screening with the viral NS5 RNA methyltransferase, a promising drug target against flaviviruses which are the causative agents of severe diseases such as Dengue or Yellow fever [26]. Moreover, in an independent virtual screening, the aurintricarboxylic acid (which is a structural analogue of 5,5-methylenedisalicylic acid) was identified as a highly potent inhibitor of the methyltransferase activities on flaviviral methyltransferases [27]. Also, a recent study shows that aurintricarboxylic acid inhibit two AdoMet-dependant RNA methyltransferases of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus [28].",

Data analysis was performed using Graphed Prism software (La Jolla, CA) for curve fits. Reactions were carried out at 1 \u03bcM of S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM). S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH) is used as standard positive control in these assays.

Despite the fact that a recent crystallographic structure for human DNMT1 has been recently published (vide infra), the structure corresponds to the enzyme bound to unmethylated DNA and this structure it is not suitable to model small-molecule inhibitors of DNMT1. This is because in the crystallographic structure the catalytic loop has an open conformation and the catalytic cysteine is far from the binding site (more than 9 \u00c5) [32]. Therefore, the geometry of the catalytic site does not represent the catalytic mechanism of DNA methylation. Briefly, to build the homology model, the catalytic domain of the human DNMT1 was taken from the UniProt (UniProt ID: P26358) [33]. The DNMT1 sequence was aligned based on the sequence of DNA methyltransferases M.HhaI (PDB ID: 6MHT), M.HaeIII (PDB ID: 1DCT) and DNMT2 (PDB ID: 1G55) and built based on the template 3D structures using Prime (PRIME, version 2.2, Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC, New York, NY, 2010). The co-factor was included in this model and the DNA double helix was constructed from the structure of M.HhaI. The variable small loops and gaps were filled by knowledge-based, homology or ab initio approach of ORCHESTRAR, and then missing long loop was modeled using Loop Search module implemented in Sybyl 8.0. The loops showing the highest homology and the lowest root mean square deviations were selected. The side chains and hydrogen atoms were added and the stability of the homology model was validated by checking the geometry using PROCHECK. The homology model coordinates were then energy minimized with Macromodel (MACROMODEL, version 9.8, Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC, New York, NY, 2010) using MMFF94s force field in a water environment (until converging at a termination gradient of 0.05 kJ mol\u22121-\u00c5) and the H-bonds were fixed using the SHAKE algorithm during molecular dynamics.",

To generate the grids for docking, the complexed DNA structure was removed from the homology model of human DNMT1, excluding the target cytosine. The shape and properties of the catalytic site were mapped onto the grids with default dimensions centered on the target cytosine. The best docking poses were selected and compared to the structure-based pharmacophore we recently reported for inhibitors of DNMT1 [31].

The efficacy of the docking protocol was recently demonstrated in a recent published docking and structure-based pharmacophore study of several known DNMT1 inhibitors [31]. Figure 3 shows three- and two-dimensional (3D and 2D) representations of the optimized docked model of NSC97317 with DNMT1. Selected residues are shown. Of note, the deprotonated form of NSC97317 (expected in aqueous solution) is shown in the binding models. The best docking conformation of NSC97317 was generated by flexible docking. According to this binding model, NSC97317 makes hydrogen bond interactions with Ser1229 and Arg1397. The phosphate group of nucleoside analogues as well as the carboxylate anion of 5,5-methylenedisalicylic acid and RG108 also make hydrogen bonds with Ser1229 [31]. One of the salicylic acid moieties of NSC97317 forms a hydrogen bond network with key residues Glu1265, Arg1311, and Arg1461 (Fig. 3b). It is worth pointing out that Glu1265 and Arg1311 seem to play a crucial role in catalytic mechanism (Fig. 1). Furthermore, hydrogen bonds with Glu1265, Arg1311, and Arg1461 have also been predicted for other DNMT1 inhibitors and could be pharmacophoric. The second methylbenzoic acid moiety of NSC97317 makes hydrogen bonds with Gln1226, Lys1462, and 2\u2032-OH of the co-factor (Fig. 3b). A similar hydrogen bond interaction with the co-factor has been reported for aurintricarboxylic acid, which is a very similar compound to NSC97317, with other methyltransferase. These hydrogen bond interactions are in agreement with the interactions found in the docking models of nucleoside analogues which are the most potent DNMT1 inhibitors. A comparison of the optimized binding mode of NSC97317 with 5,5-methylenedisalicylic acid revealed that both compounds adopt a different docking position in the binding pocket (vide infra). Of note, the docking score of NSC97317 with DNMT1 (-9.45 kcal mol\u22121) was better than the docking score of 5,5-methylenedisalicylic acid (-7.73 kcal mol\u22121) and similar with that of nucleoside analogues (data not shown).",

Molecular docking studies with the catalytic domain of DNMT1 indicate that NSC97317 makes hydrogen bond interactions with amino acid residues involved in the mechanism of DNA methylation. The polyanionic structure of NSC97317 and the electropositive binding region of the catalytic site of DNMT1, due to several arginine residues, also seem to play a key role in the binding recognition. The key interactions of the analogue of aurintricarboxylic acid with the binding pocket of DNMT1 can be exploited in the structure-based discovery and optimization of DNMT1 inhibitors. NSC97317 is a promising research tool to study enzymatic inhibition of DNMT1 in the research of cancer and other diseases related to DNA methylation. Follow up studies include the evaluation of NSC97317 as a demethylating agent in cell based assays.
