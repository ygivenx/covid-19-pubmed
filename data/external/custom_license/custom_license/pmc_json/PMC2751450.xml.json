For the most part, the application of patent law to veterinary pharmaceuticals parallels its application to human pharmaceuticals, with outcomes dependent on the particular facts in each case. In a few areas, however, the law itself is different for veterinary products; and these specific exceptions\u2014in areas such as \u201cpatent term restoration\u201d and \u201csafe harbor uses\u201d\u2014are discussed in the final section of this article.",

As a policy matter, the grant of a patent is sometimes viewed as a quid pro quo, whereby innovation is advanced through full disclosure of a useful invention in exchange for the grant of exclusive rights for the life of the patent. For innovators, the possibility of an exclusive right provides an incentive to invest in research and development. For the public, the full disclosure of inventions in published patent documents expands the general knowledge base and leads to further innovations.",

(See list above for examples in the veterinary field under U.S. law).Utility \u2014 The invention must be useful and have real world utility; its use must be specific, substantial and credible.(1,2) (The utility requirement is not usually an issue in the veterinary field).Novelty \u2014 The invention must be truly new, and cannot have existed beforehand.(3)Non-obviousness \u2014 It is not enough for a new invention to be novel\u2014it must also be \u201cnon-obvious\u201d to a person having \u201cordinary skill in the art.\u201d(4) In many foreign jurisdictions, the corresponding patentability requirement is referred to as \u201cinventive step\u201d. See, e.g., Article 56 of the European Patent Convention.(5)Sufficiency of the Disclosure in the Patent Specification as Filed \u2014 U.S. Patent law requires that patent applications disclose the best mode for carrying out the claimed invention and provide adequate written description of how to make and use the invention. With regard to the adequacy of a patent application\u2019s written description of how to make and use the invention, contemporary case law in the U.S. highlights two significant tests. The more classic of the two is what is often referred to as \u201cenablement\u201d\u2014this is the more technologically-based test of whether one of ordinary skill in the art could make and use the claimed invention without \u201cundue experimentation\u201d. The other major test of adequate disclosure in the U.S. is often referred to as the \u201cwritten description\u201d requirement. This test is focused on factors such as whether the inventors have shown, through their patent specification (in sufficient wording and detail), that they are truly \u201cin possession\u201d of the invention as claimed.(6)",

With regard to the factors to be considered in determining whether \u201cundue experimentation\u201d is required, reference is usually made to the landmark case of In re Wands, 858 F. 2nd 731 (Fed. Cir. 1988). In the Wands case, the patent claims at issue related to immunoassay methods for the detection of hepatitis B surface antigens using high-affinity IgM monoclonal antibodies, and the issue was whether undue experimentation would have been required to produce the monoclonal antibodies. The patent applicant asserted that his invention was enabled because the monoclonal antibodies needed to perform the immunoassays could \u201ceasily be made from readily available starting materials using methods that are well known in the monoclonal antibody art\u201d(8). The court agreed and noted that there was no challenge to applicant\u2019s contention that the starting materials (mice, HBsAg antigen and myeloma cells) were available to the public. Most importantly for future cases, the court set forth the following eight factors to consider in determining whether \u201cundue experimentation\u201d would be needed:\nThe quantity of experiments necessary;The amount of direction or guidance presented;The presence or absence of working examples;The nature of the invention;The state of the prior art;The relative skill of those in the art;The predictability or unpredictability in the relevant field;The breadth of the claims.",

In order of expanding scope, the claims at issue in Wright were directed to vaccines against the specific Prague Avian Sarcoma Virus (PrASV) in chickens; vaccines against all avian RNA viruses; and vaccines against all RNA viruses. However, the patent application gave only \u201ca single working example\u201d of a vaccine (specifically, a vaccine against PrASV in chickens). The court held that the narrower claims directed to vaccines against the specific chicken virus were allowable, but the court also held that the claims drawn to vaccines against any and all avian RNA viruses, as well as the claims directed to any and all RNA viruses, were not enabled. The court cited examples such as the general difficulty in developing RNA virus vaccines (such as AIDS vaccines) and reasoned that one working example was simply insufficient given the lack of predictability due to the mutation and diversity of these RNA viruses. Moreover, the court noted there was nothing in the record to establish that an immune response caused by an antigenic envelope protein would have been sufficient to rise to the level of an \u201cimmunoprotective\u201d response (9).",

In that case, the University presented claims covering the entire genus of \u201cvertebrate\u201d cDNAs encoding insulin (in addition to claims drawn to \u201cmammalian insulin cDNA\u201d and narrower claims drawn specifically to \u201chuman insulin DNA\u201d). However, the University\u2019s patent application disclosed only rat cDNA, along with the amino acid sequence for human insulin, and a method for isolating human DNA using the rat sequence. In ruling that the University\u2019s claims failed to meet the written description requirement and were therefore unpatentable, the court stated that a \u201cdescription of rat insulin cDNA is not a description of the broad classes of vertebrate or mammalian insulin cDNA,\u201d(10) Citing Fiers v. Revel, 984 F.2d 1164, 1171 (Fed.

In recent years, however, criticism grew that the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the main appeals court in patent cases) was interpreting the Graham v Deere test in a way that unfairly raised the bar for parties trying to invalidate patents.

KSR (the accused infringer) argued that the claimed invention of the patent in suit (the combination of a known adjustable gas pedal with a known electronic throttle control) merely represented an obvious combination of existing devices. In response, the party asserting the patent (Teleflex) argued that the Federal Circuit case law pertaining to obviousness required a party to demonstrate a specific teaching, suggestion or motivation to combine reference teachings, and in this case there was no evidence of a specific teaching, suggestion or motivation to combine the known gas pedal with the known electronic control.",

In general, the evaluation of \u201cinventive step\u201d in Europe starts with the identification of the \u201cclosest prior art\u201d and the \u201ctechnical problem to be solved\u201d. This is then followed by an analysis of whether the technical solution to the problem represents an unexpected or \u201cnon-obvious\u201d advance over the \u201cclosest prior art\u201d (when combined with either a second prior art reference or common general knowledge in the relevant art). A thorough review of the European case law on inventive step can be found in Case Law of the Boards of Appeal of the European Patent Office, pp. 120\u2013168 (5th Ed. 2006) (20). With particular regard to the life sciences, it is worth noting cases such as Modifying Plant Cells/MYCOGEN (T 694/92; OJ EPO 1997, 408), Vaccines/GENENTECH (T 187/93; 1997), and Triazole/ AGREVO (T 939/92 OJ EPO 1996/309), where there is an interesting interplay between the \u201cinventive step\u201d requirement of Article 56 EPC and the \u201csufficiency of disclosure\u201d requirement of Article 83 EPC. In particular, these cases show that it has been the practice of the European Patent Office, under the so-called \u201cproblem and solution\u201d approach, to evaluate whether or not the problem in a given case has been solved across the full scope of the claims, and then to limit a patent proprietor\u2019s claims to a scope commensurate with the proprietor\u2019s actual contribution to the art.",

Section 271(e)(1) provides a \u201csafe harbor\u201d exemption from patent infringement for \u201cuses reasonably related to the development and submission of information under a Federal law which regulates...drugs or veterinary biological products,\u201d and this special exemption has been given a fairly broad interpretation under recent case law.(22) However, once a party commercializes a therapeutic, that party can no longer use the Section 271(e)(1) exemption as a defense. It also would not be a defense simply to say that it is the clinician or veterinarian who is the infringer and not the company that supplies the therapeutic product. This is because the company selling the product commercially could be accused of inducing infringement under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(b) or contributing to infringement under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(c). Although it is beyond the scope of this article to speculate on how all this might be played out in court and what remedies might or might not be available, there are some court cases that may be of interest in this analysis. See, e.g., Hybritech Inc. v. Abbott Laboratories, 849 F. 2d. 1446 (Fed. Cir. 1988), where the defendant\u2019s infringing cancer and hepatitis test kits were not included in the preliminary injunction order against the defendant since the patentee did not offer such kits and there were no other suppliers at the time. Moreover, the U.S. Supreme Court has recently issued a landmark decision on remedies in patent infringement cases, ruling there is no longer a \u201cgeneral rule\u201d in patent cases that courts will almost always issue permanent injunctions against infringement. Specifically, in eBay, Inc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C, 547 U.S. __, 126 S. Ct. 1837 (2006), the Supreme Court held that in patent cases, like all other types of cases, permanent injunctions can only be issued where the remedy is appropriate in light of equitable principles. This means that the remedy must be assessed under the well-established four-factor test used in all other cases, whereby a plaintiff/patentee seeking a permanent injunction is required to show that:\nThe patentee will suffer irreparable harm,Standard legal remedies such as monetary damages are inadequate to compensate for the injury,A permanent injunction is warranted in view of the balance of hardships (between patentee and infringer), andA permanent injunction would not be against the public interest.",

The component of the application that establishes human food safety must contain an analytical method that has been properly validated. The performance characteristics of that method are then integrated into the establishment of a withdrawal time (i.e., the time between the last dose and when the animal-derived food product is considered to be safe for human consumption).

The generic companies, on the other hand, argued that they could not get on the market until years after the patent expiration. This was because of the famous 1984 case, Roche v. Bolar, 733 F.2d 858 (Fed. Cir. 1984), which held that testing and development in pursuit of regulatory approval constituted infringement even though the generic company was willing to wait for the patent to expire before commercializing the product.",

To remove this potential dilemma, there is a unique provision in the patent term restoration statute that provides a patentee in the animal health area the important option of actually deferring its one-time opportunity for patent term extension until its approval for the food-producing animal indication comes through. This represents a very unusual statutory exception to the general rule that a patent can only be extended for the first approval. No such exceptions exist for human therapeutics.",

In general, the patent term restoration statute contains strong prohibitions against obtaining a second patent term restoration for the same active ingredient (26). However, if one reads carefully through all the statutory prohibitions, the possibility for the following special scenario can be seen: Assume that a company has two patents: Patent A covering the use of Compound X in a human indication (as approved under Section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (\u201cFDCA\u201d)) and Patent B covering use of the same Compound X in an animal indication (as approved under Section 512 of the FDCA). Then, in this particular situation (assuming all the other conditions are met), the company can obtain one extension\u2014on Patent A\u2014based on the human indication, plus an additional extension\u2014on Patent B\u2014based on the veterinary indication.
