This has resulted in H3N2 SIVs with human\u2010like HA and NA genes and avian\u2010like internal genes.2, 3 In North America, H3N2 viruses did not become established in the pig population until 1998. These viruses are \u201ctriple\u201d reassortants with the HA, NA, and PB1 genes of human H3N2 viruses from the mid\u20101990s and the remaining genes of classical swine and avian origin.4 Multiple H3N2 SIV lineages have been found in Asia, and all have HA and NA genes derived from human H3N2 viruses from various time periods.5, 6, 7 Because of slower antigenic drift in the H3 HA in swine than in humans,5, 8 human\u2010lineage H3N2 viruses in swine over time become increasingly divergent from contemporary human H3N2 viruses. As an example, European H3N2 SIVs from 1983 to 1999 showed a six times slower rate of antigenic drift than their human counterparts.8 Consequently, European H3N2 SIVs from recent years still show some degree of serological cross\u2010reactivity with human viruses from the 1970s to 1980s, but not with human viruses isolated after 1990.9, 10\n",

Most cases of swine influenza occur in people with direct or indirect exposure to swine, frequently children, or young adults. The European H3N2 SIV has been isolated from a 1\u2010year\u2010old girl and a 2\u2010year\u2010old boy in the Netherlands in 1993.14 A closely related virus was also isolated from a 10\u2010month\u2010old girl in Hong Kong in 1999.15 In North America, nine cases of human infection with triple reassortant H3N2 SIV have been reported from 2005 to 2010.12, 16, 17 A variant of the original triple reassortant H3N2 SIVs, which contains the matrix gene of the pandemic 2009 H1N1 virus, has been detected in 13 humans in the United States from July 2011 to April 2012,18 and in 306 cases in 10 US states from July to September 2012, mainly in children visiting county or state fairs.19 The increasing numbers of human cases may be in part due to heightened awareness and surveillance.

However, it remains unknown to what extent immunity to human H3N2 viruses may offer protection against H3N2 SIVs.

Each group was housed in a separate biosafety level\u20102 HEPA\u2010filtered isolation unit. Before the start of the experiment, all pigs were seronegative to any of the European endemic H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2 SIVs, as determined by HI test, immunoperoxidase monolayer assay, and a competitive anti\u2010influenza A NP enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay (Idexx Laboratories, Hoofddorp, the Netherlands). After acclimation for 1 week, three groups were inoculated with A/Vic/75, A/Wis/05, or sw/Gent/08, respectively. One group was left uninoculated and served as the challenge control group. Six weeks later, all groups were challenged with sw/Gent/08. All inoculations were performed intranasally with 7\u00b70 log10 50% egg infective doses (EID50) influenza virus in 3 ml (1\u00b75 ml per nostril) as described elsewhere.26 Pigs were observed daily for clinical signs from 4 days before until 7 days after each inoculation, or until euthanasia. To determine virus excretion, nasal swabs were collected daily from all pigs from 0\u20137 days post\u2010primary inoculation (dpi) and from 0\u20137 days post\u2010challenge (dpc), or until euthanasia. Four pigs per group were euthanized at 3 dpc and gross lung lesions were assessed as described elsewhere.27 To determine the extent of replication of the sw/Gent/08 challenge virus in the respiratory tract, tissue samples of the upper (nasal mucosa respiratory part and olfactory part, tonsil, and trachea) and lower (apical, cardiac, and diaphragmatic lobes of the left and right lung) respiratory tract were collected and titrated separately.

            "text": "The increasing antigenic divergence between H3N2 viruses from swine and humans may have important implications for zoonotic transmission of H3N2 SIVs. This is the first study to evaluate cross\u2010protection between human and swine H3N2 viruses in pigs. It shows a complete virological protection against infection with a contemporary European H3N2 SIV in pigs infected with A/Vic/75 6 weeks earlier, but only a minimal protection in pigs pre\u2010infected with the more recent human H3N2 virus A/Wis/05. We did not identify the immune mechanisms underlying the observed cross\u2010protection, but several findings point toward a role for cross\u2010reactive antibodies against the HA and/or NA of the swine virus. Indeed, the difference in protective immune response induced by the two human viruses was in line with the genetic and antigenic differences in their HA and NA. Antigenic sites A and B are located on the tip of the HA molecule, and they are supposed to be the primary targets for neutralizing antibodies.21, 22 A/Wis/05 differed from sw/Gent/08 in as much as seven of the total nine amino acids of site B, and it had two additional N\u2010glycosylations in site A, which make it more distinct from sw/Gent/08 than A/Vic/75. In addition, low\u2010titered cross\u2010reactive VN antibodies against sw/Gent/08 were found in all pigs previously infected with A/Vic/75, but they were rare after infection with A/Wis/05. Post\u2010challenge, however, such antibodies developed more rapidly in A/Wis/05 pre\u2010infected pigs than in challenge controls, and this coincided with the enhanced clearance of the challenge virus. The HI test, as well as the NI test, is less sensitive than the VN test.26 This can explain the lack of cross\u2010reactive HI and NI antibodies in most A/Vic/75\u2010inoculated pigs. Given the low cross\u2010reactive serum antibody titers in A/Vic/75\u2010inoculated pigs, it is likely that local antibodies in the respiratory tract and cell\u2010mediated immunity, which are more cross\u2010reactive,31 also contribute to the cross\u2010protection.",

            "text": "Previous studies by Kyriakis et al.9 have shown that H3N2 SIVs from 2007 to 2008 cross\u2010react in the HI test with hyperimmune sera against the human viruses A/Vic/75 and A/Philippines/2/82, but not with sera against A/Sydney/5/97 or A/Wis/05. The present comparison of sw/Gent/08 with human H3N2 viruses showed increased genetic differences since 1987\u20131989, as reflected by an increased number of aa differences in the HA (\u226514) and NA (\u226513), and additional N\u2010glycosylations in the HA1 globular head. This suggests that especially people born after the mid\u20101980s are at a higher risk for infection with European H3N2 SIVs. Additional in vivo cross\u2010protection studies with more, antigenically distinct human viruses would be required for a better understanding of the nature of the human viruses that could offer cross\u2010protection against swine viruses. Still, genetic and antigenic analyses should be interpreted with caution. Our cross\u2010NI test results with A/Wis/05 serum from ferrets versus swine, for example, illustrate that sera from different animal species may yield discrepant results. As for the definition of antigenic sites, this is based on studies of the oldest human viruses and their reaction with mouse monoclonal antibodies. It is questionable whether the antigenic sites of such historical viruses will overlap exactly with those of recent human or swine H3N2 viruses. Furthermore, different animal species will likely mount antibodies recognizing different epitopes. Finally, some amino acids will be more important for antigenic drift than others. According to recent studies, only 7 aa positions in the HA were largely responsible for the antigenic evolution of human H3N2 viruses over a period of 35 years.32 It is of great interest to identify the immunodominant amino acids in the HA of SIVs and those that are cross\u2010reactive with human H3N2 viruses.",

A/Wis/05 also seemed to replicate less efficiently in pigs than A/Vic/75, which is more closely related to swine\u2010adapted H3N2 viruses. Similar findings were made in a comparative pig infection study with a triple reassortant H3N2 SIV from North America and a non\u2010reassortant wholly human H3N2 virus.33 Like the authors of that study, we suspect that the lower antibody responses to human influenza viruses in pigs are in part due to their lower replication efficiencies. Virus titers in the ferret model also differ for different H3N2 virus strains.34, 35 Comparative studies of the pathogenesis of human and swine H3N2 viruses in pigs and ferrets would help to select the best animal models and experimental conditions for cross\u2010protection studies with such viruses. On the other hand, a separate experiment in our laboratory has demonstrated complete protection against A/Wis/05 in pigs that had been previously infected with the homologous virus under the same conditions as in the present study, and with similar antibody titers. Thus, human H3N2 viruses can elicit an efficient protective immune response in pigs.",

            "text": "The recent infections of over 300 humans in the United States, mainly children in a fair setting, with a variant H3N2 virus (A(H3N2)v) of swine origin have raised concerns about the extent of pre\u2010existing immunity against this virus in the human population. Serological studies have shown cross\u2010reactive HI antibodies in \u226550% of late adolescents and young adults, whereas such antibodies were generally lacking in children under 10.18, 36, 37 Overall, these serological findings and the present study support the idea that various H3N2 SIV lineages could cause epi\u2010 or pandemics in the younger population, should they acquire the capacity to spread efficiently between people. The H3 of A(H3N2)v is phylogenetically most closely related to human H3N2 viruses from the 1995 to 1997 era and slightly more related to human H3N2 viruses from the 21st century than European H3N2 SIVs.38 We therefore assume that the immune status of young people may be even lower for the European H3N2 SIV than for A(H3N2)v. Both serological investigation of humans and experimental cross\u2010protection studies, as well as studies of the host barriers, are needed to further explore the susceptibility of humans to various H3N2 SIVs. Experimental cross\u2010protection studies are performed under artificial conditions, but they will assess all arms of the immune response and true protection. Many serological studies only consider subjects with HI titers \u226540 as protected, and they may therefore underestimate protection against SIVs in the human population.",
