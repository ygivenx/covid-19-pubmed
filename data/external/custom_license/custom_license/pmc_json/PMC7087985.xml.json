For instance, notorious viral infections include acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) which is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) which is caused by the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and influenza due to the influenza virus. Even hepatic cancer has been proven to be related to a hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Among them, the influenza virus is a type of rapidly transmitted virus, infecting the upper respiratory tract and sometimes causing acute viral respiratory illness. Unlike most viruses, influenza infects all-age groups and recurs in many former patients. Furthermore, influenza epidemics show abrupt and rapid infections throughout a population with a high infection rate, especially in school-aged children.",

            "text": "Influenza viruses are enveloped ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses and can be generally classified into three types, namely influenza viruses A, B and C. The majority of respiratory diseases in human beings are caused by influenza viruses A and B. The influenza virus A can be further subtyped by two different expressed surface proteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Various subtypes of influenza virus A infections have caused severe pandemics. For example, a H1N1 pandemic happened in 1918 and is commonly known as the Spanish Flu (Johnson and Mueller 2002), a H2N2 pandemic in 1957 is known as the Asian Flu (Kawaoka et al. 1989) and a H3N2 pandemic in 1968 is known as the Hong Kong Flu (Both et al. 1983). Most new subtypes of influenza virus emerge and can lead to high mortality pandemics, such as the Hong Kong Flu in 1968\u20131969 which caused about one million deaths worldwide (Horimoto and Kawaoka 2005). Additionally, in early 2009, the novel influenza A (H1N1) virus, containing RNAs from human, pig and avian flu viruses (Medina and Garcia-Sastre 2011), emerged and made people realized that even a well-known seasonal influenza virus could develop into another unpredictable serious disease. For public health, it is therefore important to develop a rapid and accurate diagnostic method (or kit) for preventing the worldwide spread of these viral strains.",

            "text": "There are four main types of influenza diagnostic tests: virus culture, serological detection, viral nucleic acid detection and viral antigen detection. A virus culture is classically accepted as a \u201cgold-standard\u201d for the diagnosis of an influenza virus. However, it is a very time-consuming and labor-intensive process, often requiring 2 to 14 days for well-trained personnel (Kaiser et al. 1999; Woo et al. 1997). Serological detection methods for the diagnosis of influenza infection are traditionally conducted by performing a complement-binding reaction (CBR), a hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test, an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) or a neutralization test (Cox and Subbarao 1999). It requires less time for the treatment of clinical samples, when compared to a virus culture, thus making serological diagnosis methods more valuable for epidemiological research or for the clarification of influenza infection outbreaks (Espmark and Salenstedt 1961). Alternatively, molecular diagnosis based on a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a very sensitive method with a high specificity. Nevertheless, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the most expensive method for influenza diagnosis and the diagnosis time can take from a couple of hours to up to 1 day (Atmar et al. 1996; Poon et al. 2009; McGeer 2009).",

            "text": "Methods of virus antigen detection include the immunofluorescence test (IFT) or the well-known enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which is most commonly used by hospital medical departments for clinical diagnosis or in the research laboratory. ELISA can be performed faster than the other three types of influenza diagnostic tests (Zheng et al. 1990; Siavashi et al. 2005). However, the relatively time-consuming and labor-intensive protocols which require highly skilled operators are always the drawbacks of these diagnostic methods. Recently, microfluidic systems have been demonstrated as a rapid and automatic detection platform for diagnosis. For example, the on-chip fluorescence imaging for ELISA using a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera and a microscope for detection was reported to successfully analyze target immunoglobulin M (IgM) at 17-nM concentrations (Eteshola and Balberg 2004). Furthermore, a surface-modified microfluidic system to perform rapid ELISA was demonstrated for the detection of the dengue virus in 30 min (Weng et al. 2011a). Recently, bead-based immunoassays have further been integrated into microfluidic systems to enhance their performance. Because of the high surface-to-volume ratio and the fact that the surface of these microbeads can be selectively modified with a variety of detection targets, the sensitivity and applicability of these bead-based immunoassays can be greatly improved. These microbeads can be further easily manipulated, sorted, and concentrated in the microfluidic systems. Therefore, more bead-based assays have been reported recently on microfluidic systems (Vignali 2000; Choi et al. 2001; Fern\u00e1ndez-Lafuente and Guis\u00e1n 2006; Yang et al. 2008; Liu et al. 2009). In this study, rapid detection of influenza virus infection using an integrated microfluidic system will be explored.",

Previous studies with rapid test kits showed that the sensitivity of the broad influenza tests ranged from 25 to 100 % and the range of selectivity were from 51 to 100 % (Gavin and Thomson 2003). However, some tests showed extremely low sensitivities of only 10 % but with a selectivity of 100 % (Hurt et al. 2007). Moreover, recent research regarding the detection of the influenza A/H1N1 virus using clinical specimens have shown sensitivity over a broad range from 10 to 69 % (Drexler et al. 2009; Faix et al. 2009; Ginocchio et al. 2009; Vasoo et al. 2009; Tsao et al. 2011). Most of the existing rapid tests for influenza infections do not show reliable detection sensitivity in clinical or laboratory tests. In order to accurately diagnose and treat influenza infected patients efficiently, a well-designed microfluidic system is thus in great need.",

Furthermore, the nucleoprotein (NP) were used to define the influenza serotypes A, B and C and showed much more stable than HA and NA. Thus a specific monoclonal antibody (mAbs) to influenza NP was useful for viral detection (de Boer et al. 1990). For instance, our group has reported an integrated microfluidic system for the rapid detection of the influenza A virus and successfully combined a three-dimensional (3D) magnetic-bead-based FIA and an optical detection module. It demonstrated that an efficient micromixer could enhance the interaction between the targets and surface modified magnetic beads (Lien et al. 2011). However, it could only perform one detection at a time and only influenza A virus detection was demonstrated. Based on our previous results, a microfluidic system equipped with four detection regions has been developed in this study. Different modified specific mAbs and fluorescence dye for influenza A and B can lead to successful detection within 15 min. Furthermore, 86 patient specimens have been tested. Experimental data showed that 84.8 % sensitivity and 75.0 % specificity can be achieved.",

For this diagnostic process, a newly custom-developed mAb (detailed in section 2.3) was first tested in the microfluidic system using optical detection. The developed mAb was directly tagged with a fluorescent dye that can offer a straightforward method to detect the antigen in patient samples. By utilizing this direct conjugated-R-Phycoerythrin (PE) developed mAb, detection of the influenza virus present in clinical specimens was feasible with fewer incubation steps and furthermore secondary antibody cross-reactions can be avoided.",

The clinical specimen, the washing buffer, the positive/negative developed mAbs and the specific mouse anti-influenza NP-A mAb-PE or anti-NP-B mAb-PE were first loaded into the sample loading chamber, washing buffer chambers, positive/negative developing mAb chambers and the influenza A/or B developing mAb chambers, respectively. Next, the magnetic beads coated with anti-NP-A/or B mAb were loaded into the detection and incubation chambers. The test sample was transported from the sample loading chamber to the incubation chambers by the transportation units. After transport of the test sample, an initial incubation process was engaged to mix the clinical sample with surface modified-mAbs magnetic beads for 5 min to capture influenza viral particles, as shown in Fig. 1a. After incubation, viral particles were attached onto the mAbs-modified magnetic beads forming bead-virus complexes. As shown in Fig. 1b, the magnetic bead-virus complexes were purified and collected with a magnet, and then the vacuum source, driven by the digital microfluidic control module, suctioned away all other unwanted particles, debris or mucous in the testing samples. Then the washing buffer was transported from the washing buffer chambers into the incubation chambers and gently mixing for 10 s to remove all the non-specific bound materials with the intention that the magnetic bead-virus complexes were completely purified from the clinical samples. Then, as shown in Fig. 1c, the positive/negative custom-developed mAbs and the anti-NP-A/or B mAb-PE were first loaded into the positive/negative mAb chambers and the anti-NP-A/or NP-B mAb-PE chambers, which were then transported into the incubation/detection chambers and incubated with the bead-virus complexes for 5 min. Then the magnetic bead-virus-mAb-PE complexes were formed. Because of the direct-conjugated PE fluorescent dye used in this study, there was no need to inject extra dyes. This automatic purification, collection and buffer washing processes were all driven by the vacuum source connected to the microfluidic control module. Finally, after completely washing out all the unbound mAb-PE, the magnetic bead-virus-mAb-PE complexes were concentrated on the button of the detection chamber where the fluorescence signal was excited and detected by the peripheral optical detection module, as shown in Fig. 1d, Likewise, the working process of positive and negative control testing is similar to virus testing by using different development Abs. The schematic illustration for the positive and negative testing can be found in Supplemental Information (SI) Figure 1. Furthermore, all the on-chip experimental procedures about the immunomagnetic bead-based microfluidic assay, including the reaction sample volume, the reaction time and the operating conditions of this microfluidic system are listed in Table 1.\n\n",

            "text": "The integrated microfluidic chip consisted of four layers including three layers of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) structures and one glass substrate, as schematically shown in Fig. 2a. Two of the three PDMS layers were thin layers with a thickness of 150 \u03bcm. One of them was a liquid channel layer (indicated as purple color layer in Fig. 2a), and another was used for air barriers and gates (green color layer in Fig. 2a) because the multiplexed detection area required many interlaced air-control channels. This integrated microfluidic system worked by utilizing one thick layer for air channels (blue color layer in Fig. 2a). Figure 2b shows a photograph of the developed microfluidic chip. The dimensions of the chip were measured to be 6.7 cm \u00d7 5.5 cm. In addition, this microfluidic chip was composed of several micro-devices such as normally-closed microvalves (Yang et al. 2009a), suction-type sample transportation units (Weng et al. 2011b) and vortex-type micromixers (Yang et al. 2009b) which were all integrated into the system to automate the entire assay process. The normally-closed microvalves were integrated with suction-type sample transportation units, thus the pumping rate could be significantly improved. The working principle of the sample transportation units can be briefly described as follows. First, the normally-closed PDMS membranes were deflected upwards by the vacuum force in the air channels and the liquid samples were drawn into the central transportation unit PDMS membrane. Second, the PDMS membrane of the left normally-closed microvalve was released as the right microvalve was deflected and opened such that the sample could be pushed forward. Finally, all the PDMS membranes of the central transportation unit and right normally-closed microvalve were released to push the liquid sample into the right channel. Furthermore, the vortex-type micromixers were also driven by the vacuum force to mix the liquid samples with the magnetic microbeads. The PDMS membranes of the micromixer were deflected on and released sequentially, and then the vortex-type flow force would be generated in the circular micromixer chamber (the control systems will be described in section 2.5). Figure 2c shows a schematic illustration of the microfluidic chip, which was composed of four detection regions for the positive control, the negative control, influenza A and influenza B, respectively.\n",

The initial titers of the virus stock were 128 hemagglutin units (HAU) and the titer determination method of HA testing can be found in SI section II (Vyas and Shulman 1970). The assay for influenza B virus detection used viral strain-94N399IB and the initial titers of the type B virus stock were also 128 HAU.

The results from conventional bench-top systems, including a large-scale shaker (INTELLI-MIXER, ELMI Ltd, Latvia) and a permanent magnetic concentrator (DynaMagTM-2, Invitrogen, USA) using a manual preparation protocol were used for comparison while using the same optical detection module. In brief, testing viruses were incubated with anti-NP-A/B mAb coated beads in a larger-scale shaker for 60 min. After manual washing process with 200 \u03bcL pipetman (RAININ, Anachem Ltd., United Kingdom), anti-NP-A/or B mAb-PE was used to incubate with bead-virus complexes for another 60 min in the shaker. Finally, the washed bead-virus-anti-NP-PE complexes were used for optical analysis, which used the same system as the one for the microfluidic system detection (Lien et al. 2011). A mercury lamp was used to excite the fluorescent both Alexa 488 and PE dye, and then the induced fluorescent signal was first collected through an excitation band-pass (BP) filter (535/25BP, Nikon, Japan). Next, the emitted fluorescence signals from the PE dye were passed through a dichroic mirror with a 565-nm cut-off wavelength (Nikon, Japan) and other signals were filtered out by using a 590 long-pass (LP) barrier filter (Nikon, Japan). Only signals with wavelengths greater than 590 nm could pass through and be detected by the PMT. Similar process with different filters was applied for Alexa 488 fluorescent dye. The excitation filter was 460/95BP. A dichroic mirror with a 505-nm cut-off wavelength was used and then other signals were filtered by a 510/50BP barrier filter (Nikon, Japan).",

As shown in Fig. 2c, the incubation/detection chambers were composed of micromixers which were the key units of this microfluidic chip. Therefore, the normalized concentration profile of these four air-channel-connected micromixers was first measured, as shown in Fig. 3a, where the normalization location (D+) was measured across the center of the micromixer chamber (X-X\u2019 line). The mixing period, the applied negative pressure and the working frequency regulated by the EMVs in this test were 2 s, \u221260 kPa and 2.0 Hz, respectively. As shown in this figure, the micromixer can mix the red ink and deionized water completely within a short period of time. Four different micromixers integrated in this chip show very similar performance. The optimal working conditions for the micromixers were then explored by measuring the mixing performance at various driving frequencies (0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 Hz) under \u221270 kPa, which was the negative pressure provided by the vacuum pump. As shown in Fig. 3b, when the driving frequency was 4.0 Hz, the mixing index could be as high as 96 % after 1 s of mixing. Note that the mixing index (\u03c3) is defined as follows to characterize the mixing performance (Erickson and Li 2002; Yang et al. 2009b):\n1\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ \\sigma \\left( \\mathrm{A} \\right)=\\left( {1-\\frac{{\\int {_{\\mathrm{A}}\\left| {{{\\mathrm{C}}^{+}}-\\mathrm{C}_{\\infty}^{+}} \\right|\\mathrm{dA}} }}{{\\int {_{\\mathrm{A}}\\left| {\\mathrm{C}_0^{+}-\\mathrm{C}_{\\infty}^{+}} \\right|\\mathrm{dA}} }}} \\right)\\times 100\\%, $$\\end{document}which \u03c3(A) is the mixing index for the normalized concentration (C+) distributing in the area of the micromixer chamber (A). \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ \\mathrm{C}_0^{+} $$\\end{document} is the normalized initial condition, as \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ \\mathrm{C}_{\\infty}^{+} $$\\end{document} is the completely mixed condition with normalization (\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ \\mathrm{C}_{\\infty}^{+}=0.5 $$\\end{document}). \u03c3 = 0 % means that sample was completely unmixed.

The working frequency of 0.67 Hz corresponds to the case where each step only takes 0.5 s to transport the liquid samples. Therefore, a complete cycle by the transportation unit to transfer a sample was 1.5 s.

First, the ability of the microfluidic system to wash out the nonspecific materials in the clinical samples was confirmed. A comparison between the optical signals of the negative clinical samples and those signals from the on-chip and manually operated diagnosis with on-chip or manual operation, is shown in Fig. 6. The optical images from the manual operation showed more debris and sputum-like mucus than the on-chip operations. This was because the microfluidic chip washed out the debris more efficiently and thus reduced the background noise caused by debris or sputum-like mucus. Parts of the negative specimens showed more mucous than expected, causing mAB-PE to become attached around these nonspecific materials and this resulted in a strong optical signal from the manually operated assay. In contrast, when operated with the microfluidic system, the micromixers could wash the specimens thoroughly and reduced the nonspecific signals when dealing with clinical specimens. Note that the entire process only takes 15 min, which is much faster than manually operation (180 min).\n",

The system was designed to be equipped with four detection regions, including a positive test, a negative test, influenza A test and influenza B test, enabling automatic viral diagnosis feasible on a single chip. Furthermore, the characterized micro-devices could wash the clinical samples more cleanly, thus reducing the noise level in the signal. Finally, 86 patient specimens were tested with the resulting sensitivity of 84.8 % and a specificity of 75.0 %. This indicated that this developed platform may provide a powerful tool for the rapid detection of various types of influenza infections.",
