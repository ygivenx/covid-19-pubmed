But the true incidence of infection, and the associated spectrum of disease symptoms, may be very different6: data on post-mortem investigations are largely lacking, for example, limiting our knowledge of which tissues the virus attacks and how it causes disease.

A widespread and integrated approach is needed to understand the dynamics, epidemiology and pathogenesis of these virus infections in wild birds, and the potential routes of virus transmission. For example, transmission from wild birds to poultry and mammalian species, including humans, may result from direct contact with production systems, the wild bird trade, and smuggling.",
