Seventeen patients with reverse transcription PCR\u2013confirmed MERS-CoV infections were included in this study; the patients were hospitalized at Seoul National University (SNU) Hospital or SNU Boramae Medical Center in Seoul, South Korea, or at SNU Bundang Hospital, in Bundang, South Korea. We investigated early serologic responses; thus, patients who were transferred to these facilities >14 days after illness onset were excluded from study. Patients\u2019 demographic and clinical profiles are shown in Technical Appendix Table 1. Of the 17 patients, 9 had severe disease (4 required mechanical ventilation, 4 required supplemental oxygen; 1 died) and 8 had mild disease. Serial serum samples were collected and analyzed. The study was approved by the SNU Institutional Review Board.",

MERS-CoV EMC was used for the PRNT assay; a 50% PRNT endpoint (PRNT50) was used because it was more sensitive than the 90% PRNT cutoff in detecting mild infections (6). The ELISA was based on the recombinant spike S1 region of strain EMC because that region is sufficiently divergent between different coronavirus species and expected to lead to less cross-reaction (4).",

By day 18, he had a PRNT50 antibody titer of 1:10 and a negative ELISA response; strong antibody responses developed from day 21 onwards. We hypothesize that the data from the first 21 days of illness represent his own serologic response, unaffected by the passive transfusion with convalescent-phase plasma on day 14; thus, these data were included in the analysis.

We assessed how these factors were associated with the time from illness onset to commencement of the log-phase antibody response (Table 1) and the time for the antibody response to reach a titer of 1:40 (PRNT50) or become positive in the ELISA (Technical Appendix\nTable 2). An accelerated failure model was used for a more natural interpretation of the median time from illness onset to the aforementioned antibody responses (Technical Appendix). Because the increase in antibody titers exhibited an S-shaped pattern, we assessed the rate of change in antibody response after the commencement of the exponential phase by manually removing data from the steady state, thus restricting antibody data to the log-phase response (Table 2). A linear mixed model was used to test the potential difference in the rate of increase by the above factors (Technical Appendix). Patients with severe disease had significant delays in the commencement of PRNT50 antibody responses (Table 1) but had a steeper slope to the antibody response once it began (Table 2). Thus, a delayed adaptive immune response may contribute to increased severity, and passive therapy with convalescent-phase immune plasma may be clinically beneficial. In avian influenza A(H7N9) virus infection of humans, earlier antibody responses and a faster rate of increasing antibody titers were associated with milder disease (8), but in SARS-CoV infection, earlier antibody responses were associated with an adverse outcome (9).",

            "text": "Our study has some limitations. First, no MERS-CoV isolates from the study patients were available, so MERS-CoV EMC was the basis of the serologic assays we used. Strain EMC is a clade A virus, and the outbreak in South Korea was caused by a clade B virus (1). However, using serum from naturally infected camels, we previously showed that clade A and B viruses and genetically diverse MERS-CoVs from Egypt were serologically indistinguishable (10). Another study reported that isolates of MERS-CoVs circulating in Saudi Arabia in 2014 were antigenically indistinguishable from the EMC strain in neutralization tests with human convalescent-phase serum (5). Thus, it is unlikely that the use of MERS-CoV EMC in our study considerably affected the observed antibody titers. A second limitation was the small number of patients studied (n = 17) and that they were followed only through the acute stage of illness. Longer term follow-up is needed to define the duration of antibody responses. If MERS-CoV antibody responses wane, as has been reported with SARS (11), this is relevant for interpretation of seroepidemiologic studies and for finding convalescent-phase donors with high antibody titers for passive immunotherapy. It would be useful to investigate IgM antibody responses and antibody responses to other virus proteins, including the MERS-CoV nucleoprotein, especially in patient L, who had poor antibody responses.",
