Their stool was thin or soft and watery. More than 2000 minks were owned by the cooperative in the reproduction period, and the same feed and immune procedures were used. A 5-year vaccination protocol against mink enteritis virus (MEV) and canine distemper virus (CDV) was completed. Fewer than 10 minks died after 1 week of illness, and most of those that died were malnourished. The other minks completely recovered within 5\u20137 days after showing clinical signs.

However, most of the animals recovered, and fewer than 10% of the affected minks died. MiCV was found in the liver, digestive tract, and fecal specimens of minks and was shown to be responsible for diarrhea [11]. However, its pathogenic role remains unknown, particularly its infection or coinfection process. In the present study, we investigated a major outbreak in a large population. Samples were tested for other causative agents, including MADV, MEV, CDV, coronavirus, calicivirus, rotavirus, bacterial pathogens, and parasites. After these pathogens were excluded, MiCV was detected alone, and was not found in combination with other key pathogens, such as MADV, MEV, and CDV. Thus, our findings suggested a possible association between MiCV and mink acute enteritis. Consistent with the detection results presented by Lian et al.

Moreover, the mink breed, disease symptoms, and disease duration differed. As such, the sustained direct transmission of MiCV among minks was excluded, and MiCV HEB15 was considered a new strain. The data gathered in this study expanded the known geographical distribution of MiCV. Unfortunately, the carcass of the MiCV-infected mink was not stored properly by the resident veterinarians and underwent repeated cycles of freezing and thawing, making it unsuitable for histopathological examination. For this reason, valuable information on tissue localization and alterations of MiCV could not be collected. The present study could contribute to our knowledge of the pathogenic potential of MiCV and its association with mink enteritis if our results were corroborated by further reports. The presence of MiCV might help to explain the different disease outcomes and severity often observed in MADV-/MEV-infected animals. Our results indicate that minks with acute gastroenteritis should be screened for MiCV and established pathogens, such as E. coli and MEV. This study was conducted to identify the viral agents associated with acute diarrhea in minks, and no attempt was made to determine the primary cause of death.",

Current surveillance methods are limited to viral detection using molecular assays, and no seroprevalence information is available. As a consequence, the identification and characterization of the virus depends on genetic approaches such as PCR and sequence determination and analysis. In this study, the nucleotide sequence of the MiCV genome was determined and analyzed. Our results showed that the genome sequence of MiCV isolate HEB15 was highly similar to that of MiCV DL13 in terms of size (1753 nt), nucleotide sequence (99.66% identity), and ORF analysis. The examination of other MiCV sequences from different regions will help to assess the level of genetic diversity. In our study, sequence analysis confirmed that MiCV genomes displayed the characteristics of members of the genus Circovirus, and the common features included their genome organization, the presence of a potential stem-loop and conserved nonanucleotide motif postulated to be the origin of viral DNA replication, and major ORFs and repeats [26, 27]. Conserved amino acid motifs, including WWDGY, DDFYGWLP, and DRYP, which have unknown functions, were also recognized within Rep associated with RCR and dNTPase activity. These motifs could be utilized to design primers that could amplify CV-specific DNA for discovery of new CVs in other hosts.",
