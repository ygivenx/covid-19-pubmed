To help science funding catch up from its dip during the economic recession a few years ago, the organization stated that it would increase its investment in drug development by 50%, to \u00a360 million ($96 million) spread over the next five years. \u201cOur sweet spot is first-in-class and first-in-man studies,\u201d says Nigel Blackburn, director of the Centre for Drug Development. \u201cWe can take scientific risks that the pharmaceutical industry can't.\u201d Although the funds will be directed toward studying all cancers, Blackburn says they are especially interested in research of those with low survival rates, such as cancers that affect the brain, esophagus, pancreas and lungs.",

The company marketed products from its Lanc\u00f4me G\u00e9nifique division as \u201cclinically proven\u201d to boost gene activity and \u201cstimulate the production of youth proteins.\u201d These claims were based on in vitro tests and in some cases consumer evaluations, but not on human clinical trials, which are necessary for products intended to affect the structure or function of the human body. \u201cIt would be nice if cosmetics could alter our genes and turn back time, but L'Or\u00e9al couldn't support these claims,\u201d Jessica Rich, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection in Washington, DC, said in a statement. The final order approved on 26 September bars L'Or\u00e9al from claiming that its cosmetic products can affect gene activity until, according to the FTC, such claims are supported by \u201ccompetent and reliable scientific evidence.\u201d",

Medical device companies have vehemently opposed the tax since its introduction, and the House of Representatives has voted to repeal the tax on two previous occasions, whereas the Senate has voted on it once before. \u201cThe [tax] is just fundamentally flawed,\u201d says J.C. Scott, chief lobbyist at AdvaMed, a trade association representative of medical technology companies, based in Washington, DC. \u201cIt hampers innovation and hurts the [medical device] industry.\u201d",

The database lists payments made to doctors by drug and medical device companies. For now, the database only shows information for between August 2013 and December 2013, but there are plans to expand coverage beyond that timeframe. However, \u201cOpen Payments does not identify which financial relationships are beneficial and which could cause conflicts of interest,\u201d says Shantanu Agrawal, deputy administrator and director of the Center for Program Integrity within CMS. \u201cIt simply makes the data available to the public.\u201d The effort has been criticized because of its complicated interface, which is difficult to navigate. Industry organizations and doctors have also expressed concern about the lack of contextual information about payments in the database.",

The new policy will apply only to medicines for which new marketing authorization applications were submitted to the EU drug regulator in or after 2015. In the future, the EMA also hopes to publish individual patient data and is considering the various privacy and data protection laws of the EU in order to do so. Guido Rasi, executive director of the EMA, stated in a policy document that, \u201ca high degree of transparency will take regulatory decision making one step closer to EU citizens and promote better-informed use of medicines.\u201d",

As of 20 October, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed 922 cases, including seven deaths, of infections caused by the virus. Although nonpolio enteroviruses are fairly common, causing an estimated 15 million infections every year in the US, EV-D68 has been the most prevalent strain this year. To improve diagnosis, the agency has started using a newly developed real-time reverse transcriptase PCR test that identifies the suspected strains of the virus faster than previous methods, cutting down the time it takes from several weeks to a few days. \u201cUltimately, faster testing will help to better show the trends of this outbreak since August and to monitor changes that are occurring now,\u201d according to a CDC press release.",

Francis Collins, director of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), said in a statement that such studies \u201centail biosafety and biosecurity risks\u201d and need better understanding.

Although other groups are working on similar pills, this is the first study to show the efficacy of this approach. In the study, 20 patients with recurring C. difficile infection took 30 pills over the course of two days. The intervention cured 18 of them of diarrhea, a major symptom of the infection. The pill-based trial paves the way for a cheaper alternative to traditional fecal transplants, which rely on \u201cexpensive procedures like colonoscopies,\u201d says Elizabeth Hohmann, an infectious disease specialist at Boston's Massachusetts General Hospital and senior investigator of the study: \u201cA pill makes treatment [for C. difficile] so much more available.\u201d",

Han, who is charged with four counts of felony for making false statements in grant documents submitted to NIH, entered not guilty pleas on all counts this summer. As Nature Medicine went to press, no deal had been reached and Han's lawyers had requested a delay in his trial date\u2014the third such request in the past three months\u2014from 3 November to February. Han resigned from ISU in October 2013 after an investigation found that he had falsified results by mixing human blood with rabbit blood to make an experimental AIDS vaccine seem groundbreaking. His initial claims generated tremendous interest and research funding from the US government, but with the discovery of fraud, ISU had to repay nearly $500 million in research grants, and more than $1 million in pending grants to the university were canceled.",
