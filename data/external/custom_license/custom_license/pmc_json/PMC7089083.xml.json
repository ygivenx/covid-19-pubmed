The basic premise of ecological thinking is that human health and their determinants are interrelated, and different determinants of health are leading to different patterns in the burdens of diseases. The world is constantly changing and different approaches for public health have also been adjusted to accommodate the transitional needs of the situations from the conversion of an old public health model to a new public health model, and till recently, an ecological public health model is the ultimate focus of this transitional needs for an attempt to make positive movements and actions to counter these multiple influences of our health arising from those of ecological determinants.",

In fact, many literatures also revealed different dimensions for the health concept in areas such as physical health, mental health, social health, environmental health, spiritual health and emotional health (Ananth 2008). Concepts of health are indeed defined in much broader sense, especially there are different meanings of focuses that set forth the boundaries in its field of concerns in relation to the particular health issues and/or determinants per se. This paper discusses more focuses on expanding the boundary in the concepts of health with emergence of complicated factors involved as our understandings developed through the correlations of these complex systems towards the twenty-first century in ecological public health developments, regarding the ecological determinants of health in conjunction with the harmful consequential effects of human-induced disturbances to our environments and food systems, together with the burdens from ecosystem disruption, environmental hazards and loss of ecosystem functions.",

Public health refers to \u201call organized measures (whether public or private) to prevent disease, promote health, and prolong life among the population as a whole. Its activities aim to provide conditions in which people can be healthy and focus on entire populations, not on individual patients of diseases. Thus, public health is concerned with the total system and not only the eradication of a particular disease\u201d (WHO 2015a). Transforming from the perspectives of old public health model that focused on hygiene, sanitation, clean water and housing to a new public health model that shifted to person-in-action directly towards health with emphasis on lifestyle approach, which is also in line with the governmental policies of \u201cbetter health for all\u201d as an initiative, in which the prime focuses are on the lifestyle dimension as an integral part in its concept for health, and till now in the ecological public health concern in the direction of momentous demands and focuses to support the sustainability of our eco-environments and human communities for our ongoing existence on this planet earth, inter alia with issues on global environmental hazards to human health such as climate change, stratospheric ozone depletion, loss of biodiversity, changes in hydrological systems and the supplies of freshwater, land degradation and stresses on food-producing systems, as well as other ecological determinants such as health threats from the human-animal-ecosystems interface (HAEI) and zoonotic diseases (zoonoses). Host-agent-environment model is an early public health framework that has also been viewed as adhering to this ecological standpoint, in which eco-epidemiology is grounded in the principle of ecologism with emphasis on the concept of disease resulting from complex interactions between man, an agent (e.g. domestic food animals, poultry and wildlife) and the environments.",

This paradigm shift is focused on \u201cOne Health\u201d vision and \u201cOne World\u201d concept as generated for the Ecological Public Health Model in order to promote ecological harmony and preserve the eco-environments for our co-existence of healthy ecosystems, healthy animals and healthy humans. As Rayner and Lang (2012, p. 12) reckoned that \u201cA new ecological sense of public health is emerging based on the recognition of the limits on nature, that nature no longer offers an endless cornucopia of its resources for human use or that the biological world can be ceaselessly altered to human advantage\u201d. Therefore, it is important to understand those ecological factors such as effects of ecosystem services, environmental hazards and its related impacts on the eco-environments and food systems to our human health, plus health threats being strained by HAEI. The ultimate goals of ecological public health approach served as the proactive interventions to counter or minimize those actual and potential problems.",

Food and environment served as a key connecting point to the challenges in this domain, as WHO (2014a) indicated that HAEI and zoonotic diseases (zoonoses) are common to man and animals, which have been recognized for many centuries.

Friis (2012) stated that physical and social environments play major roles in the health of individuals and communities and also further emphasized maintaining environmental quality is a pressing task for the twenty-first century. The concept of environmental hazards can be in the form of biological, chemical, physical, psychological and sociological or site and location hazards, which are harmful to our human health, and those hazards can also be affected by the changes or disturbances of biodiversity and its subsequent ecosystem services (Romanelli et al. 2014). Every disturbance to the eco-environment will prime to the subsequent alteration of disease patterns and our human exposure to the altered and later disease outbreaks that in effect guide to the increasing burdens on global health (Barrett et al. 2015).",

In fact, environmental impacts are an important factor in the interaction of agent and host under this epidemiological or ecological triad. Traditionally, the concerns of environmental epidemiology included the contamination of air, water and food. Nowadays, the focus is expanding to include predisposing factors such as climate change and other large-scale environmental impacts related to globalization and urbanization, with which also imposed a significant number of adverse health outcomes from those anthropogenic activities, for instance, as Barrett et al. (2015) stated that widespread burning of fossil fuels, combined with the destruction of forests, has already influenced earth\u2019s temperature, sea level and climate, which is threatening to wreak havoc on an unprecedented scale as the major determinant as of Omran\u2019s \u201cAge of Degenerative and Man-Made Diseases\u201d.",

The following effects of changes are some examples interconnected with those causes by adverse geo-climatic changes and environmental hazards, with further subsequent adverse outcomes such as:Higher mean of global temperatures that can lead to increase water-borne, food-borne and vector-borne diseases, e.g. wider distribution of insects, with resultant effects of increase in malaria, dengue, lyme diseases, etc. (Barrett et al. 2015; Mills et al. 2010; Patz et al. 2003; Brown and DeGaetano 2011)Sea level rise as a special type of climatic disaster that can cause inundation (Hunt 2002; Reguero et al. 2015)Climate change, drought, desertification and/or flooding can have subsequent effects on crop failure and other food productions, as well as food-, vector- and water-borne diseases and human health (Yeh et al. 2015; Yusa et al. 2015; Brown and DeGaetano 2011)Climate and atmospheric change that leads to stratospheric ozone layer depletion with increasing UV radiation, which can impose high risks to human health such as skin cancer and cataracts (Lucas et al. 2015)Acid emissions affect ocean and freshwater acidification, which can cause the loss of key aquatic life and damages to coral reefs that is also one of the inducing factors causing ecological disturbances (Driscoll et al. 2001)Soil acidification can adversely affect the agricultural and forest productivity (Driscoll et al. 2001)Air, water and soil pollutions and eco-toxicity by persistent organic pollutants (POPs), etc. (El-Shahawi et al. 2010)Resource depletion both from renewable and nonrenewable resources such as the nitrogen and phosphorus cycles, as they are essential nutrients for the survival of all living organisms, plants and animals, as well as control the ecosystem mass balance (Vitousek et al. 2010), with examples taken as follows:The ecological implications of human alterations to the nitrogen cycle from many human activities have a significant impact on the nitrogen cycle, such as burning fossil fuels, application of nitrogen-based fertilizers and other activities which can dramatically increase the amount of biologically available nitrogen in an ecosystem, and any large changes in the availability of nitrogen can lead to severe alterations of the nitrogen cycle in both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems (Driscoll et al. 2001; Vitousek et al. 1997)The phosphorus cycle is the slowest of the biogeochemical cycles, and phosphorus enters the environment from rocks and from deposits such as fossilized bone or bird droppings, of which is an essential mineral nutrient for all plants and animals. Food production depends on mineral phosphorus supplies that are nonrenewable and are being depleted (Childers et al. 2011)Global freshwater depletion and contamination are also one of the greatest environmental threats to our human health as the World Health Organization has indicated (WHO 2015b)\nThe value of the biophysical environment is being affected due to land degradation by the combinations of multiple forces, including extreme weather conditions and human-induced processes or anthropogenic activities (Gibbons et al. 2014; Powers et al. 2011)Stresses on food-producing systems from other risks associated with environmental contaminants and pollutants, as well as the man-made contaminations; misuses of antibiotics; food fraud and violations in domestic food animal and poultry welfares in productions; etc.\n",

As such, those ecological factors are the most significant components in our environments as the driver of services which provide us with basic human needs like food, clean air, clean water and clean soils, and such ecosystem functions could also prevent the spread of disease through biological control, which are essential concerns under the ecological determinants of our health.

Ritter et al. (2002) illustrated there are two primary routes of contaminants to surface waters, groundwater, sediments and drinking water as follows:Point-source pollution originates from discrete sources whose inputs into aquatic systems can often be defined in a spatially explicit manner. Examples include industrial effluents (pulp and paper mills, steel plants, food-processing plants), municipal sewage treatment plants and combined sewage-storm-water overflows, resource extraction (mining) and land disposal sites (landfill sites, industrial impoundments).Non-point-source pollution, which originates from poorly defined diffuse sources that typically occur over broad geographical scales. Examples include agricultural runoff (pesticides, pathogens and fertilizers), storm-water and urban runoff, and atmospheric deposition (wet and dry deposition of persistent organic pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls [PCBs] and mercury).\n",

Younes (2012) estimated 60 % of known infectious human diseases have their source in animals and are caused by all types of pathogenic agents\u2014including bacteria, parasites, fungi and viruses; zoonotic pathogens of those organisms from a nonhuman animal source in fact represent three quarters of emerging infectious diseases in humans as indicated by the World Health Organization, and those zoonoses still represent significant public health risks posed by endemic, epidemic and potential pandemic events, as over two hundred HAEI and zoonotic diseases have been described (WHO 2014a). Scientists widely recognize the inherent link between human and animal health in this respect of HAEI. Because of the inherent unpredictability of influenza viruses, the associated risks to both animal and human health are still unknowable at certain extent, and therefore a public health risk is assumed to exist whenever influenza viruses are circulating in certain animal populations, especially those in direct contact with humans, as well as those antimicrobial resistance pathogens and antibiotic-resistant bacteria. There are numerous examples of emerging health threats of zoonoses through:Water-borne diseases that are transmitted through drinking water, e.g. hepatitis A virus, Salmonella, cholera, amoebic dysentery, Shigella, polio virus, Cryptosporidium and Giardia.Food-borne diseases are those transmitted through food, e.g. bacteria Salmonella, serotype enteritidis, E. coli, bovine spongiform encephalopathy and variant Creutzfeldt-Jacab disease/mad cow disease. In fact, food- and feed-borne diseases are one of major factors for our public health concern (Kneifel 2014).Vector-borne diseases are those transmitted by insects or other arthropods, e.g. West Nile fever, tick-borne encephalitis, malaria, dengue fever and plague.Air-borne diseases such as Middle East respiratory syndrome corona-virus (MERS-CoV) and avian influenza H5N1 and H7N9, and pandemic A(H1N1) 2009 influenza.Antimicrobial resistance in pathogens\n",

Furthermore, the high rates of growth, substantial genetic selection for improved growth and feed conversion on poultry breeds that resulted in reduced genetic diversity of domestic poultry would also enhance the potential epidemic transmission and evolution of influenza viruses (Vandegrift et al. 2010).",

Those climate changes subsequently imposed adverse effects significantly affecting ecosystem health, water supplies and food production (Yeh, et al. 2015; Brown and DeGaetano 2011). For instance, as according to Weller et al. (2015), the global rice agriculture will also be increasingly challenged by water scarcity. Other food production problems are the increasing concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and/or hazards of heavy metals in agricultural systems that could lower the content of zinc and other nutrients in important food crops, and in effect, zinc deficiency is currently responsible for large burdens of disease globally, and the populations who are at the highest risk of zinc deficiency (Myers et al. 2015; Savic et al. 2015). The dietary deficiencies of zinc and iron are a substantial global public health problem, with an estimated two billion people suffering from these deficiencies, causing a loss of 63 million life-years annually, due to crops grown under field conditions at the elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration (Myers et al. 2014). Moreover, environmental contaminants such as heavy metals can also endanger and decrease the ecological value of surrounding water and agricultural land resources by exposing food production to potential contaminants with complex pollution sources (Savic et al. 2015).",

For those reasons, eco-friendly food products and sustainable diets should be an integral part of the concept under the ecological public health model.

Sustainable diets are protective and respectful of biodiversity and ecosystems, culturally acceptable, accessible, economically fair and affordable; nutritionally adequate, safe and healthy; while optimizing natural and human resources\u201d (Burlingame et al. 2010 p. 7). IOM (2014) also projected a series of major workshops with themes on \u201cSustainable Diets: Food for Healthy People and a Healthy Planet\u201d, which also described how different diets have different environmental impacts with respect to greenhouse gas emissions and the use and contamination of air, water and other natural resources. The concept of sustainable diets offers an opportunity for the commitments to sustainable development to the need for improving the quality and environmental sustainability of our food system, especially given the alarming pace of biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation (Johnston et al. 2014). For instance, the Mediterranean diet has become the object of increasing studies on its environmental sustainability, because of its mainly plant-based dietary pattern and its lower greenhouse gas emissions and lower water footprints, energy resources and the overall impact on the ecosystem (Dernini and Berry 2015). In fact, this is also in line with our One World concept under Ecological Public Health Model as illustrated in this paper, for sustaining our environment and the planet earth for all beings, as also echoing to Confucian\u2019s theory for the environmental ethics of ecological harmony. In fact, lack of ecological health literacy and eco-environmental ethics in practices is one of the most important factors leading to the present devastations and worries.",

As the proverb by Rudolph Virchow (1821\u20131902) says that \u201cBetween animal and human medicine there is no dividing line \u2013 nor should there be\u201d. In 2008, FAO, World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), WHO, United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), the World Bank, and UN System Influenza Coordination (FAO et al. 2008) have developed a strategy to address emerging infectious diseases that specifically focused on the interdependence of human, animal and ecosystem health, with strategic framework of breaking down the barriers among agencies, individuals, specialties and sectors in order to unleash the innovation and expertise needed to meet the many serious challenges to the health of people, domestic animals and wildlife as well as to the integrity of ecosystems. Rayner and Lang (2012) postulated a broader conception in the \u201cthinking\u201d focus of the environment with recognition that human activity was altering nature and that humans depend on that environment, not least through food, but also the realization of the impact of climate change, biodiversity loss and global interconnectedness as the challenge under an era of ecological threat.",

In this regard, a broader understanding of health and disease requires interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral efforts working collaboratively to attain optimal health for people, animals and our environments for ensuring the biological and biophysical integrity of our planet earth. Consequently, the recognitions of these relationships amongst humans, domestic animals, wildlife, ecosystem services and climate, as in the \u201cOne health concept\u201d under \u201cecosphere and zoosphere\u201d of this one world system, are therefore being formulated. A better understanding of the links between biodiversity, health and disease has direct and indirect implications for public health, as loss of biodiversity, habitat fragmentation and the loss of natural environments threaten the full range of life-supporting services provided by ecosystems at all levels of biodiversity, including species, genetic and ecosystem diversity (Romanelli et al. 2014). The diversity of relevant criteria defined around the public health interventions will be placed on in using One Health approach with this One World concept; FAO/OIE/WHO (2012) built the One Health vision in support of the collaborative multidisciplinary work for the health of humans, animals and ecosystems, in order to reduce the risk of diseases at the interfaces between them. Its critical vision facilitate the diffusion and understandings towards collaborative intervention keys with broad vision to encompass other disciplines that also impact human health from different sectors such as economics, food security and food safety. Enormous challenges are imposed on the ecological perspectives on food, including aquaculture, agriculture and the entire food systems, and hence scientific and public health interventions are required as examples taken in the following:Eco-aquaculture is an alternative model linked between aquaculture, the environment and society that acted as complementary roles of aquaculture in allowing the time for our eco-environment recovery (Costa-Pierce 2010).Efforts from the regulatory use of antimicrobial agents are needed in order to prevent development and spread of antimicrobial resistance in aquaculture and to reduce the risk to our human health. There has been much debate about the origins of AMR. Nevertheless, linkages between misuse and increasing AMR are of our concerns. FAO/OIE/WHO (2012) indicated that the accelerated emergence of resistance and the discovery and development of new antimicrobial drugs have slowed to the extent that the development of AMR is now exceeding the availability of new antimicrobial agents, making AMR a global threat to our health.Reduction on food waste to minimize the adverse cycle on the environmental problems by landfills, which cause pollution and produce methane that is a harsh greenhouse gas emission with adverse effects to our eco-environments (Kosseva and Webb 2013). For example, food wastes in Hong Kong were from less than 400 tonnes per day in 2002 to over 800 tonnes per day in 2012, and the landfill problems with excess food wastes are the major constituent of the municipal solid waste; despite the food waste is highly degradable, it can easily cause odour and hygiene problems that pose risk to our health as well as an adverse cycle by depleting the limited landfill space in HK (HKEPD 2015).Promotion of ecological health literacy and environmental ethics to the public via public health interventions and education in order to provide the public with knowledge to understand this emerging concerns is utmost vital in terms of the consequences of human actions and interactions amongst humans, animals and wildlife within the natural context of the eco-environments and its functions to our planet earth\u2019s ecosystems. A matter of education to promote the environmental ethics and way of living with concept of sustainable diets, as well as providing education and training programmes to create more ecologists as a potential workforce, should also be the prime focus, as Kosseva and Webb (2013) supported that these are critical for eco-innovation for our human capital needs in the delivery of the eco-innovative solutions to our concern.\n",

Their insights and visionaries are not about one disease or a few main listed diseases, but rather concern all human and animal diseases under all related ecologies, as The American Veterinary Medical Association (2008) also supported the concept of One Health should be the collaborative effort of multiple disciplines in order to attain optimal health for people, animals and the environment.",

In America, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2004) have offered guidelines as referred to in the \u201cManhattan Principles\u201d to build the bridges to our health in this \u201cGlobalized World\u201d, which summarized the importance of focuses from the perspectives of holistic approach for the prevention of an epidemic/epizootic disease and the maintenance of ecosystem integrity. Global health is the contemporary public health movement for the twenty-first century public health and that should be shifted into an ecological paradigm with ecological and ethical thinking for the concerns of eco-health in support of the sustainability of our environments and our planet earth for all plant, animal and human health.",

Whereas policy-makers easily see connections between animal and human health, the connections between ecosystem health and human and animal health are more subtle but no less important. Articulating these connections and their relationship to environmental conservation, biodiversity, and economic health, is also a major challenge\u201d (Harvey 2010 p. 73).",

Few would debate the interdependence but the links often are not considered by policy-makers, members of the public, and medical and veterinary professionals. As humans encroach more on natural terrestrial and marine ecosystems, as the population increases and as the effects of anthropogenic climate change are realized in the next few decades, the health of the earth\u2019s ecosystem will impact everyone, in developed and developing countries alike.",
