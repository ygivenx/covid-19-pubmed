However, these systems are mostly\nimplemented in high-income countries [9], as\nmost developing countries are faced with logistic and budgetary constraints,\nresulting in low-quality surveillance systems based on pen-and-paper methods. In\nmany cases, these low-tech systems provide health institutions with inadequate\nsupport, resulting in frequent \u201chealth crises\u201d [10]. Moreover, the healthcare infrastructure, laboratory\ndiagnostic capacity, skills and number of physicians in these countries are\ngenerally insufficient to deal with emerging diseases likely to cause epidemics.\nConsequently, delays in raising the alarm often limit the possibility of an\neffective early response to new, emerging public health problems.",

In addition, the\n2005 International Health Regulations stressed the importance of commitment to the\ngoal of global security and asked all member states to establish and implement\neffective surveillance and response systems, making it possible to detect and\ncontain public health threats of national and international importance. As a result,\nthe government of Madagascar, in partnership with the Institut Pasteur de\nMadagascar, established 13 fever sentinel sites in 2007, expanding the network to 34\nsites by 2011, to improve the timely detection and management of febrile disease\noutbreaks. Two key attributes of the sentinel surveillance system are monitored\ncontinuously: timeliness and data quality. This system was designed to identify\noutbreaks for which public health interventions may be required early enough for\nsuch interventions to be effective.",

The sentinel system in Madagascar\nwas clearly simple and rapid, but we found that some process indicators tended to\ndecline over time, due to high staff turnover. The decrease in the number of fever\nforms received annually, between 2007 and 2011, is one of the weaknesses of this\nsystem. The increase in the number of sentinel sites increased the workload of\ncentral staff managing the different activities. A lack of co-ordination hindered\nthe training of new healthcare workers entering the network, and changes in\npractices were discovered only during supervision in the field. Challenges resulting\nfrom high staff turnover have also been identified in other countries [6,8]. The\nindicators used for the continuous assessment of the sentinel network in Madagascar\nare useful for a rapid, basic internal evaluation, but an external evaluation\napproach is also required, using CDC guidelines [21], for example, and including economic indicators as an integral part\nof the surveillance evaluation process [4].",

The Madagascan network has been supported by funding from\nvarious sources over the years, focusing on different health topics.\nSelf-sustainability is another challenge, as already described [8], and has already been identified as a\nweakness of this network. We therefore need to focus on the first steps of\nsurveillance system implementation and all system changes. Initial funds targeted\narbovirosis, because of the spread of Chikungunya epidemics in Indian Ocean\ncountries in 2006, and influenza, due to the threat posed by avian flu. However, the\nsteering committee subsequently decided to include other diseases associated with\nfebrile syndromes. This policy has been tremendously successful, making it possible\nfor the network to provide epidemiological information not only about arboviruses,\nbut also about malaria and influenza, throughout the country. In 2008, the first\nhuman case of Rift Valley fever was detected, by this network, at Taolognaro (in the\nsouth of the country), a site used for both syndromic and biological surveillance.\nFor malaria, the network has monitored the shift from control to elimination\nfollowing the strengthening of malaria prevention and control measures. The\nusefulness of sentinel networks for influenza detection is well documented and was\nassessed in the last pandemic period in 2009 [15]. Funding for work on these diseases has improved geographical\ncoverage and made it possible to extend the network over the last five years. This\nnetwork has become an additional tool for public health decision-making. The\nsyndromic surveillance has been shown to be an effective approach to surveillance\nand, thanks to the availability of large mobile phone networks throughout\nMadagascar, the cost of real-time data transmission is low. This surveillance method\nmay also facilitate compliance with the revised International Health Regulations for\nlow-income countries and the aim of the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network\n(GOARN) [22].",
