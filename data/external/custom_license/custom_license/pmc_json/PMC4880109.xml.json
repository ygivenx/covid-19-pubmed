Our challenge/rechallenge trial was planned as a first stage in the assessment of the alpaca as a potential surrogate for camels for MERS-CoV vaccine testing. Consequently, the trial was not designed for direct comparison with 2 previous MERS-CoV challenge trials reported in camels (5,6). Our trial used a lower challenge dose and a different timeframe for observation; nevertheless, some preliminary comparative observations may be useful. In the previous studies, as in ours, the animals were inoculated by the oronasal route, and live virus was detected through day 7 postinfection. Similarly, neutralizing antibodies were detected beginning 7\u20138 days postinfection. However, findings in the trials with camels differed considerably from findings in our trial. The trials with camels detected live virus from nasal washes at days 1\u20133, a nasal discharge, and transient temperature rises; viral RNA was detected by real-time PCR for an extended period. Furthermore, the VNT titers for camels were much higher than those for the alpacas in our study. These differences possibly represent underlying dissimilarities in immune responses to MERS-CoV for the 2 species but may also result from the higher infecting dose (107 50% tissue culture infective dose) used in the camel studies.",

Second, our observation period of 21 days before rechallenge is informative but does not provide complete information on duration of protective immunity. Future studies should have a larger sample and a longer period of study postinoculation.
