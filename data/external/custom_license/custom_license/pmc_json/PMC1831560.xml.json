            "text": "Cryptosporidium parvum is an intracellular protozoan parasite causing gastrointestinal disease and diarrhoea in a variety of animal species including cattle, sheep and man. The first report on bovine cryptosporidiosis was published in 1971, when C. parvum parasites were identified in the faeces from an 8-month-old heifer with chronic diarrhoea [17]. Today C. parvum is recognised as an important infection in young calves. The most prominent finding in an infected calf is diarrhoea, sometimes accompanied by depression, inappetence, fever, dehydration and/or poor condition. The calf most often recovers spontaneously within 1\u20132 weeks even though there is a large variation between individuals in how they respond to and recover from infection [26,14]. Concomitant infection with other enteric pathogens can aggravate the clinical signs and prolong the duration of disease [14]. C. parvum is transmitted as microscopic oocysts that are excreted in the faeces from infected animals. Finding oocysts in diarrhoeic faeces is indicative of C. parvum being the cause of the disease. During the first two weeks of infection a calf can shed millions of oocysts [7,27] which ensures efficient dissemination of the parasite.",

            "text": "The intestinal flagellate Giardia intestinalis (synonyms G. duodenalis and G. lamblia) has a global distribution and is a common protozoan parasite in many animal species and in man [32,10]. In calves it can cause diarrhoea, malabsorption and growth retardation. However, the severity of disease is highly variable and many G. intestinalis infections are asymptomatic [32,18]. An infected individual sheds microscopic cysts with the faeces and in calves intermittent cyst shedding can continue for several weeks [33]. Infections with rotavirus and coronavirus are well-known causes of acute diarrhoea in young calves, usually occurring in calves at 1\u20133 weeks of age [13,19]. The clinical picture is similar to that of cryptosporidiosis and comprises diarrhoea, depression, anorexia and mild fever. In several surveys, rotavirus has been the most commonly detected infectious agent in bovine neonatal enteritis [21,19]. Other infectious agents \u2013 Eimeria spp, bredavirus, calicivirus, astrovirus, parvovirus, Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., Clostridium perfringens \u2013 are also reported as enteric pathogens in neonatal calf diarrhoea [25]. Bovine viral diarrhoea virus has the ability to cause immunosuppression and enhance the severity of calf diseases, including neonatal calf diarrhoea. Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (E. coli) K99+ causes diarrhoea in very young calves and the clinical outcome may be fatal. A rapid and extensive loss of body water and electrolytes can cause severe weakness, recumbence and hypothermia [3].",

The herds participated in an a long-term research project about health and growth rate in dairy heifer calves. Details about the herds, which had 29\u201394 cows, considered a reasonably representative sample of Swedish dairy farms, have been reported elsewhere [22]. The farmers were requested to take faecal samples from each up to 90 day-old heifer calf born in 1998 that had diarrhoea, and from a healthy calf of the same age. Diarrhoea was defined as faeces with a consistency that was looser than normally observed in calves, continuing for \u22652 days. Healthy was defined as absence of diarrhoea. The samples were to be collected the second day after the onset of diarrhoea and before any possible antibiotic treatment was given. The samples together with information about date of birth of the calves were sent by mail to the laboratory. The age of a calf was calculated as days between date of birth and date of arrival of sample to the laboratory. For healthy calves kept in group pens, the birth date was calculated as the mean between the birth dates of the youngest and oldest calf in the pen. At arrival, the samples were immediately analysed for presence of C. parvum, rotavirus and coronavirus. An aliquot of each sample was stored at -70\u00b0C and later analysed for G. intestinalis and E. coli K99+.",

They are also consistent with a previous finding that rotavirus and C. parvum are the predominant agents causing neonatal diarrhoea in Swedish cattle herds [5]. That E. coli K99+ was not found in any of the diarrhoea samples and in only 2 samples collected from clinically healthy calves, partly contradict results from a Swedish investigation performed in 1987\u201388. In that study, E. coli K99+ was demonstrated in 11.5% of faecal samples from dairy calves younger than 14 days and a similar percentage of diarrhoeic and healthy calves were infected [31]. However, our results support a previous suggestion that there was a substantial over-treatment with antimicrobial drugs in the farms included in the present study; 30% of the calves \u226490 days with diarrhoea were treated with antibiotics [16].",

A lack of relationship between oocyst shedding and diarrhoea has been reported from an investigation of a Swedish herd with cryptosporidiosis [24]. In the present study the higher proportion of C. parvum infected calves in the diarrhoea group compared with the healthy calves was not statistically significant. However, further studies to investigate any association between diarrhoea and C. parvum are desirable since the number of infected calves in this study was low (n = 22). There is a great variability in the clinical outcome of infection depending on e.g. the infection dose and the immune status of the calf [4]. It is therefore not surprising that subclinical C. parvum infection does occur. Further, it has been shown that there is a difference in the oocyst shedding pattern between individuals; the shedding often continues for several days and can start before the onset of scouring and continue after the diarrhoea has ceased [7,6]. In the present study C. parvum was found in faeces from calves sampled during all seasons. An absence of association between season of the year and prevalence of the parasite was reported by [28]. However, others have found seasonal variation in the prevalence of bovine C. parvum infection, maybe owing to climate factors and various managemental factors such as seasonal production of livestock [4].",
