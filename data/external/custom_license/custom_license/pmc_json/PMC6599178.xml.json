PEDV causes significantly high mortality in piglets under 7 days of age though pigs of all ages can be infected (Chen et al, 2013; Vlasova et al, 2014). Since its identification in 1984 in China, PEDV has continuously caused problems to the pig farming industry, and the situation aggravated because of the emergence of highly pathogenic PEDV variants in China in 2010 (Xuan et al, 1984; Li et al, 2012; Zhang et al, 2013). Recently, outbreaks of infections by novel variant PEDV strains with recombination and heterogenic Spike (S) genes have been reported in several provinces of China with a positive rate of up to 72% (Chen et al, 2013; Cai et al., 2016; Li et al, 2016a; Wang et al, 2016).",

Previous researches have shown that the S gene is one of the most variable genes in the PEDV genome and that it is a useful marker for determining the genetic diversity of PEDV (Chen et al, 2013; Tian et al, 2014). In recent years, PEDV has spread throughout the Hubei Province of China and adversely affected pig farming. In this study, to determine the infection status and to better understand the molecular characteristics of PEDV in different districts in Hubei, we screened PED samples for PEDV and investigated the full-length S genes. Our results revealed the coexistence of multiple PEDV genotypes with novel genetic mutant sites in the S genes in Hubei. These findings can help better understand the epidemic status of PEDV as well as aid in developing new vaccines for the control and prevention of PED.",

Upon characterization of the complete S gene, we confirmed that 7 different genotypes of PEDV coexisted in the Hubei province in 2016. Based on genetic characteristics and emerging periods, PEDV can be sorted into 3 genogroups: GI (classical), GII (variant), and INDEL-variant group (Vlasova et al, 2014; Lee, 2015; Wang et al, 2016). Most of the PEDV strains in this study belonged to the GII group, which was consistent with the PEDV situation in China, where most of the highly prevalent variant PEDV strains in China have been found to be members of the GII genogroup since 2010 (Wang et al, 2016). However, new variant PEDV strains of the GI and INDEX groups were also found in this study. These results indicated that the epidemic heterogeneity of PEDV in Hubei is more complex than previously assumed.",

More worthy of concern is the fact we found 58 new aa mutant sites in the S genes in these field strains. In some districts, multivariants and accumulating aa mutations in the S gene could be observed in a herd. For example, we detected 3 different S variants in a herd in Ezhou: HBEZ-2, HBEZ-3, and HBEZ-4 (Figure 2, Supplementary Material S2). HBEZ-2 had 2 aa mutant sites (Y307D and H1047Q), HBEZ-3 had 3 aa mutant sites (L300S, Y307D, and H1047Q), and HBEZ-4 had 4 aa mutant sites (L300S, Y307D, H1047Q, and H1377Q).",
