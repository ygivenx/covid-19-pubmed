It also seems helpful to review how great men and thinkers perceive liberty.",

A stormy development was noted in molecular biology and genetics, biotechnology, genomics, proteomics, nano-technology and signal replication. In health-care, synthesis of life-saving drugs, including hormones (e.g. insulin), development of vaccines, in vitro fertilization, gene manipulation in genetic disorders and insights in patho-physiology of diseases are among the most important achievements that improve the quality and duration of life. However, the shade of so called \u201cdual-use\u201d sometimes appears to creep up behind the scientific research [1\u20134].",

Scientists pointed on different aspects: the misbalance in funding [16]; the particular role of industry [17]; the need of a comprehensive analysis of the situation, and especially on defined criteria to recognize dual-use life-sciences research and assessment of balance between the threat and the possibilities for development in science [18\u201320].",

Tuberculosis, an old disease, considered almost eradicated in developed countries, is re-emerging now with severe variants\u2014multidrug- and extensively-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB and XDR-TB). Pulmonary tuberculosis is typical example of air-born infection and Mycobacterium tuberculosis spreads person to person via nuclei of respiratory tract secretions containing microbes. MDR strains are defined by resistance to isoniazide + rifampicin (two basic anti-tuberculosis drugs), while the XDR-strains are additionally resistant to at least one fluoroquinolon and one second line parenteral drug [64]. The treatment is very difficult, longer and more expensive than treatment of infections with susceptible strains. The resurgence of tuberculosis and the presentation of MDR-TB and XDR-TB is generally associated with non-compliance with treatment, as well as an infection in HIV-infected patients or poverty. There is a BCG vaccine and other vaccines under development. Infection control necessitates air-born isolation with respiratory masks and respirators; and protection of laboratory workers by use of safety cabinets. Aerosol dispersion of MDR- or XDR-TB strains as bioterrorist attack may have significant health-care consequences.",

In such situations, several patients with similar symptoms should be considered an outbreak. It is necessary to emphasize that to be successful, the emergency post-exposure prophylaxis and treatment with vaccines and antibiotics respectively, if available, should start immediately since the exposure.
