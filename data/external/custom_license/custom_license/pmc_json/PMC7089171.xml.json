            "text": "Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is a major pathogen causing bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) among cattle and other ruminants, leading to significant economic loss throughout the world (Brodersen 2014). BVDV is an enveloped, positive strand RNA virus, which belongs to the genus Pestivirus of the family Flaviviridae. Two BVDV biotypes are distinguished: cytopathogenic (CP) and noncytopathogenic (NCP) viruses, according to their respective effects on cell culture (Ammari et al. 2010). NCP is the most common naturally occurring biotype, but cytopathogenic effects on cultured cells do not relate to virulence in vivo (Peterhans et al. 2010). The occurrence of CP BVDV in cattle persistently infected with NCP BVDV is directly correlated with induction of lethal mucosal disease (Hilbe et al. 2013; Kuwabara et al. 2007; Walz et al. 2010). In addition, BVDV is genetically divided into three types: type 1 (BVDV-1), type 2 (BVDV-2), HoBi-like viruses (BVDV-3), or \u201catypical pestiviruses\u201d, and it is noted that only BVDV-1 and BVDV-2 are recognized species, and Hobi-like is a tentative species (Bauermann et al. 2013; Giammarioli et al. 2015b; Stahl et al. 2010). Recently, the virus isolates have been further grouped into different subgenotypes by phylogenetic analysis (Abe et al. 2016; Gomez-Romero et al. 2017; Otonel et al. 2014; Yesilbag et al. 2017; Yilmaz et al. 2012). So far, 21 subgenotypes (BVDV-1a to BVDV-1u) and BVDV-2 subtypes (2a-2d) have been reported worldwide (Deng et al. 2015; Giammarioli et al. 2015a; Xue et al. 2010; Yesilbag et al. 2014).",

            "text": "BVDV is worldwide distributed, and its seroprevalence in cattle varies among countries. In Ethiopia, seroreaction to BVDV antigens was detected in 32.6% of the 1379 cattle and 69.8% of the 149 herds sampled (Aragaw et al. 2018). Within herd of Tamil Nadu, BVDV seroprevalence was 12\u201365% (Kumar et al. 2018). In suburb of Mashhad-Iran, the seroprevalence of BVDV infection in industrial dairy cattle herds was 72.25% (Talebkhan Garoussi et al. 2009). In Ireland, BVDV infection was detected in 98.7% of non-vaccinated herds (Cowley et al. 2012). In addition, BVDV-1b and BVDV-1e were the most prevalent subtypes circulating in Italy, whereas the BVDV-1a and BVDV-2a subtypes were predominant and widespread in Korea (Bazzucchi et al. 2017; Han et al. 2018). The prevalence of persistently infected cattle from selected, nonrandom sample in six large South African feedlots was 2.9% (Meiring et al. 2011), while prevalence of PI calves in Japan in a dairy herd was estimated about 7.0%, which was very high ratio compared to that in previous reports (Helal et al. 2012). In China, the pooled BVDV prevalence in dairy cattle in China was up to 53.0% according to the data obtained from systematic review and meta-analysis (Ran et al. 2018). Furthermore, the BVDV subtypes currently circulating in China were various (1a, 1b, 1c, 1d, 1m, 1o, 1p, and 1q) (Xue et al. 2010). However, previous studies are mainly conducted in northern and western China; it is less known about prevalence of BVDV and PI animal status among dairy cattle in eastern China recently.",

Some of the tissue samples (lung, kidney, spleen, intestinal canal, and aborted fetus) were prepared and treated by tissue homogenizer and supplemented with PBS. Blood samples were collected using an EDTA vacuum blood tube from the jugular vein. The collected tissue and blood samples were repeatedly frozen and thawed for three times, and then, they were inoculated onto the MDBK cell monolayer for virus culture. The culture plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C, with 5% CO2 for 2 h. After centrifugation, the supernatants were discarded, and plates were rinsed twice with PBS (pH 7.2, 0.01 mol/L), and 1 mL DMEM (HyClone, USA) with 2% horse serum (Gibco, USA) was added. The infected MDBK cells were checked daily and appearance of cytopathic effects (CPE) was observed and recorded. If the CPE was not found, the cultures were frozen and thawed twice and the clarified supernatant was passaged five times in MDBK cells. Meanwhile, uninfected MDBK were included as negative controls.",

Reportedly, the worst part of BVD disease in cattle is the persistence of infection caused by NCP biotype of BVDV, and our results further confirmed that most of BVDV field isolates from China were NCP. Moreover, it was showed that BVDV-1a, BVDV-1c, as well as BVDV-2 were circulating in eastern China based on the sequence of highly conserved 5\u2032-UTR (Fig. 4). This study was potentially provided with additional background on the genetic heterogeneity that all BVDV isolates from cattle in China between 2005 and 2008 were of the BVDV type 1 genotypes (Xue et al. 2010). In addition, BVDV-2 genotype does exist in dairy herd although BVDV-1 was still main genotype in eastern China.",

Classically, the prevalence of PI animals ranges between 0.5% and 2% (Stott et al. 2012). In this study, we found that the ratio of PI animals was 1.86% among 377 cows, which indicates that the herds containing PI animals are at higher risk of BVDV infection in eastern China. Therefore, as the identification of potential source of contamination in dairy cattle herds has been of increasing concern, epidemiological studies and eradication or control programs may be considered essential for removal of persistently infected cattle in some regions.",
