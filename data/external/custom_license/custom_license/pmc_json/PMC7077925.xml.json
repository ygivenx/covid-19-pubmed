Scheme 1B illustrates operation of the multiplex sensor. First,\nthe sample reservoir of the top layer was punched to provide a solution\nconnection directly from the top to the bottom layer, and then the\ndevice was assembled by folding the top layer over the base layer\nto create the three-dimension origami paper-based device. A polydimethylsiloxane\n(PDMS) lid was used for holding the two layers together. The lid consisting\nof one 6 mm diameter hole over the sample reservoir and eight 4 mm\ndiameter holes over the colorimetric detection and control zones was\naligned over the device to provide consistent pressure across the\nsurface of the device. Next, the acpcPNA probe and AgNPs solution\nwere added onto the detection and control zones. Finally, the sample\nsolution was added onto the sample reservoir and flow through the\nchannels to wet the colorimetric detection zones.",

The degree of AgNPs aggregation\nwas determined by measuring the color intensity of the resulting solution\nin the presence of acpcPNA without target DNA. First, the impact of\nthe PBS concentration on AgNPs aggregation was measured. The differential\ncolor intensity (\u0394 intensity, \u0394I) obtained\nbefore and after addition of acpcPNA as a function of AgNPs to PBS\nratio is shown in Figure 2A. \u0394I increased until the ratio of\nAgNPs/PBS reached 5:1 and then decreased until it plateaued at 5:2.\nThus, the ratio of 5:1 AgNPs/PBS was selected as the optimal condition\nbecause it gave the largest \u0394I. Another important\naspect for the DNA assay is probe concentration. The influence of\nacpcPNA probe concentration on absolute intensity was studied. As\nshown in Figure 2B,\nthe acpcPNA concentration was varied within a range of 0\u20132.5\n\u03bcM, and the highest aggregation was obtained at the concentration\nof 1.0 \u03bcM. At this concentration, the aggregation became independent\nof acpcPNA concentration, which was desirable for simplifying the\nassay. Higher concentrations of AgNPs were not tested in order to\nminimize reagent consumption. As a result, the optimal conditions\nconsisting of AgNPs/PBS ratio of 5:1 and acpcPNA concentration of\n1.0 \u03bcM were selected for further experiments.",

Each zone contained AgNPs\nwith a single acpcPNA probe to provide selectivity for DNA. The base\nlayer contained four wax-defined channels extending outward from a\nsample inlet. After the device was folded and stacked together, the\nchannels of the base layer were connected to four detection zones\nof the top layer. Upon sample addition, the solution moved outward\nthrough the channels of the base layer to wet the colorimetric detection\nzones of the top layer and lead to color change. Figure 5 illustrates the ability of\nthe proposed sensor for detection of 100 nM MERS-CoV, MTB, and HPV.\nOnly the colorimetric detection zones that contained the selective\nprobes changed color compared to their control zones. This result\nindicated that the multiplex paper-based colorimetric sensor is promising\nfor simultaneous determination of MERS-CoV, MTB, and HPV.",
