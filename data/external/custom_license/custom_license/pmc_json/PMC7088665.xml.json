            "text": "Reducing sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitric oxide (NOx) pollution is one of the most concerning global issues (Radoiu et al. 2003; McDonald-Buller et al. 2016). Decreasing the discharge of these two air pollutants has an important significance for a cleaner atmosphere and environment and improved public (Xie et al. 2004; Blanchard et al. 2005; Muller et al. 2009; de Gouw et al. 2014). In fact, scientists have analyzed their trends and source characteristics, expecting to discover some physical methods or policy tools to remove the pollutants (Popp 2006; Fraley et al. 2006; Washenfelder et al. 2010; Fang et al. 2011; Hansjurgens 2011; Lu et al. 2013; Pinkerton 2014; Lee and Zhou 2015; Jacimovski et al. 2016). For example, Mekaroonreung and Johnson (2012) used the stochastic semi-non-parametric envelopment method to estimate the shadow prices of SO2 and NOx generated by US coal power plants. They proposed a price mechanism to inhibit the two pollutants\u2019 emissions. Sun et al. (2016) provided a detailed description of SO2 and NOx resources and summarized the currently used techniques to remove them in order to protect the atmospheric environment. In addition, by introducing new energy such as solar, wind, and fuel cells, controlling air pollutants had been discussed and programmed by some optimization models to satisfy the atmosphere quality demands in a cost-effective manner (Chen et al. 2016, 2017; Li et al. 2017; He et al. 2017). Thus, it is currently necessary to study this problem in depth from some other perspectives.",

            "text": "China\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) has experienced rapid growth since 1978 that has made it the fastest growing country (Zhang and Wen 2008). Similarly, its industrial GDP also showed a remarkable growth. In 2003, the Chinese industrial GDP was valued at 7.47 trillion Chinese yuan (CNY), but it increased to 22.34 trillion CNY in 2014 with an annual average increase of 10.47%. The smallest increase was 6.93% in 2014 (Fig. 1a). This rapid economic development coupled with industrialization, urbanization, and inadequate investments in basic air treatment infrastructure resulted in widespread atmospheric pollution in China (Lei et al. 2012). Therefore, more attention has been paid to whether the country\u2019s development is sustainable and when and how its environmental conditions will be improved. For example, it was projected that China\u2019s government should reduce SO2 and NOx emissions by an annual decreasing rate of 8 and 10%, respectively, while retaining an average annual GDP growth rate of no less than 7% during its 12th Five-Year Plan (2011\u20132015). As a result, the real mitigating effects (18 and 18.6% for SO2 and NOx, respectively) and the GDP growth (7.8%) were reported in the first chapter of China\u2019s 13th Five-Year Plan (2016\u20132020; Xinhua News Agency 2016). The discharges of the two pollutants decreased from 2011 to 2014, and the corresponding discharge intensities (discharge per GDP) also obviously decreased from 2011 to 2014 (Fig. 1b). Traditionally, with the development of economy, it was considered that the pollutants\u2019 discharge would show an inverted-U shape trend (Grossman and Krueger 1991). However, this was not the sole possible relationship between economic development and pollutant discharges (Douglas and Thomas 1995; Friedl and Getzner 2003), as seen in the abrupt increase of SO2 from 2010 to 2011 (Fig. 1b). Thus, some other methods and/or new perspectives are needed to study this problem in China.",

            "text": "There are two commonly used methods in the similar studies (Liu et al. 2016; Xiao et al. 2016): structural decomposition analysis (SDA) and index decomposition analysis (IDA). SDA often requires the economic data of an input\u2013output table, while IDA only needs the aggregate data of each industrial category (Cellura et al. 2012; Cansino et al. 2016; Yang et al. 2016). In addition, SDA can only analyze the change between the limited years, while IDA usually can analyze the change across any years (Hoekstra and van der Bergh 2003). Therefore, based on the available data, the IDA model was adopted for this study, despite the fact that there are still many optional indices for quantifying the impacts of factorial changes on the aggregated industrial sector. These indices include the Laspeyres index (Lu et al., 2014a, b), the Paasche index (Liu et al. 2016), the arithmetic mean Divisia index (Hatzigeorgiou et al. 2008), and the logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI; Ang 2005; Wang et al. 2005; Lee and Oh 2006; Wood and Lenzen 2006). Among them, the LMDI has become the most popular due to its incomparable advantages (Chen 2011; Tan et al. 2011; Ren et al. 2012; Zhang et al. 2013; Tian et al., 2013a, b; Shao et al. 2016). Therefore, the LMDI decomposition was chosen for this study. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: the LMDI decomposition model and the corresponding data explanation are presented in the \u201cData and methodology\u201d section, the results and related discussions are presented in the \u201cResults and discussion\u201d section, and some conclusions and particular strategies or policy implications for mitigating Chinese SO2 and NOx discharges (especially in the industrial sector) are contained in the \u201cConclusions and policy implications\u201d section.",

Thus, the time series data of SO2 from 2003 to 2014 and that of NOx from 2011 to 2014 are extracted (http://www.stats.gov.cn/ztjc/ztsj/hjtjzl/). Based on the studied period, the related economic data can be acquired from the corresponding China Statistical Yearbook (CSY). The amount and share of ancillary activities for exploitation (AAEs) are marginal, and those of AAEs of SO2 or NOx discharges are close to 0 in most years. Therefore, the AAE industry is excluded. Similarly, some other industries are also excluded (http://www.stats.gov.cn/tjsj/ndsj/). Overall, 38 industrial sub-sectors were investigated (Table 1).",

It is decomposed as the economic output effect (G), the industrial structure effect (S), and the intensity effect (I). I can somewhat reflect the technological level\u2019s progress (Sun 1998) and can be further divided into the effects of cleaner production (C) and pollution abatement (A). C is the production of the two pollutants per unit of GDP, and A is the ratio of the pollutant\u2019s discharge divided by the production\u2019s amount. Therefore, C and A can somewhat reflect the developmental status of cleaner production technologies (CPTs) and pollution abatement technologies (PATs), respectively. The CPT focuses on the management of these pollutants\u2019 sources and the reuse of resources during the process of production, whereas PAT only focuses on the pollution end-controlling.1\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ {\\displaystyle \\begin{array}{l}Y=\\sum \\limits_{i=1}^{38}\\frac{Y_i}{G}\\times G=\\sum \\limits_{i=1}^{38}\\frac{Y_i}{G_i}\\times \\frac{G_i}{G}\\times G=\\sum \\limits_{i=1}^{38}\\frac{Y_i}{E_i}\\times \\frac{E_i}{G_i}\\times \\frac{G_i}{G}\\times G\\\\ {}\\kern24.5em =\\sum \\limits_{i=1}^{38}{A}_i\\times {C}_i\\times {S}_i\\times G\\\\ {}\\kern24.5em =\\sum \\limits_{i=1}^{38}{I}_i\\times {S}_i\\times G\\end{array}} $$\\end{document}Y=\u2211i=138YiG\u00d7G=\u2211i=138YiGi\u00d7GiG\u00d7G=\u2211i=138YiEi\u00d7EiGi\u00d7GiG\u00d7G=\u2211i=138Ai\u00d7Ci\u00d7Si\u00d7G=\u2211i=138Ii\u00d7Si\u00d7G",

Moreover, the transformation of the industrial structure received great impetus as a result of some effective pollution reduction actions of the government. As a result, the proportion of tertiary industry output increased from 42.9% in 2008 to 48.1% in 2014. Therefore, it could be found that these pollutant reduction efforts (such as updating the industrial structure) surely had a positive effect on mitigating the two pollutants\u2019 discharges. For example, the industrial structure adjustment presented an overall mitigating effect on SO2 discharge from 2003 to 2014 when the average annual contribution rate was \u2212 1.16% (Table 4). In the various three stages, the corresponding average annual contribution rates were 0.04, \u2212 2.17, and \u2212 1.24% (Table 4). These results indicated that although the industrial structure adjustment in China was not obvious (Fig. 4) and was a driving effect in stage 1 (2003\u20132005, Table 4), it was ultimately effective for mitigating SO2 discharge. This adjustment concept indicated that production resources were reallocated among industrial sectors with different technologies, efficiencies, and profits, thus inducing the changes of output share among different sectors. It was an important source of sustainable growth and a radical approach to transform the developmental pattern (Ren et al. 2012). Thus, with the implementation of the three continuous Five-Year Plans, China\u2019s industrial structure gradually transformed from manufacturing industries with heavy pollutant discharges to a new phase with a more reasonable industrial structure. In this new phase, high-tech industries with high added values and low pollutant discharges (such as photovoltaic, electronic, solar, and information industries) rapidly developed. Therefore, the output share of the low discharge group started to continuously increase while that of the high discharge group symmetrically began to decrease from 2011 to 2014. The share of the former rose up from 30.25% in 2011 to 31.90% in 2014, with an annual average increase rate of approximately 0.55% (Fig. 5).",

This phenomenon could arise from the massive outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus and the related natural disasters in 2003. In 2003, the government had implemented many energy-intensive control measures to combat SARS including related research, development, and management behaviors. Fortunately, the SARS virus was soon under control and people\u2019s lives returned to normal. However, due to the lag in policy, these energy-intensive control measures caused the pollution abatement effect to show an opposing increase from 2004 to 2005.",

Similarly, from 2011 to 2014, the decomposition result of the clean production effect on NOx discharge was \u2212 1.84 Mt (Fig. 2), with the average annual contribution rate of \u2212 3.70% (Table 4). This average annual contribution rate was also the second largest among the four effects. Thus, after the pollution abatement effect, the clean production effect was also an important factor for mitigating SO2 and NOx discharges in China.",

For example, this decomposition was regarded as perfect since there was no unexplained residual term that other methods may produce (Lyu et al. 2016). Moreover, the pollutant treatment technology and the other two factors have also been recently investigated as the potential drivers of single SO2 emissions in China from 1995 to 2014 using the LMDI method (Yang et al. 2016). In addition, taking Jiangsu Province as a case, Wang et al.

Moreover, the discharges of SO2 or NOx may be mainly distributed in Eastern China (i.e., in the Jingjinji Region (which is made up of Beijing City, Tianjin City, and Hebei Province) because of the more developed economic level in these regions.

However, few scientists had investigated the potential driving forces of these two discharges from the perspectives of both the Five-Year Plan period and industrial structure. Thus, taking China as a case in this paper, we completed this work through a decomposition analysis using the LMDI method. The two pollutants\u2019 discharges were decomposed into the output effect, structural effect, clean production effect, and pollution abatement effect. The results showed that China\u2019s industrial SO2 discharge increased to 1.14 Mt from 2003 to 2014. The contributions by the four effects were 23.17, \u2212 1.88, \u2212 3.80, and \u2212 16.36 Mt, respectively. Likewise, NOx discharge increased to \u2212 3.44 Mt from 2011 to 2014, and the corresponding contributions by the four effects were 2.97, \u2212 0.62, \u2212 1.84, and \u2212 3.95 Mt. Thus, the output effect (industrial output growth) was always the most prominent driving force for the growth of the two discharges due to rapid industrialization and urbanization in recent years. The average annual contribution rates were 14.33 and 5.97%. Inversely, pollution abatement technology presented the most obvious mitigating effects (\u2212 10.11 and \u2212 7.92%, respectively). Next were the mitigating effects of clean production technology (\u2212 2.35 and \u2212 3.7%). The mitigation of the structural effect was the weakest (\u2212 1.16 and \u2212 1.25%).",
