The study coordinator contacted parents twice a week (by telephone or email) to ask about the presence of any signs or symptoms of respiratory tract illness. Respiratory signs and symptoms were defined as coryza (rhinorrhea or nasal congestion), sore throat, ear ache with or without ear discharge, cough, sputum production or dyspnea, in the presence or absence of fever (>38\u00b0C). Every 2 weeks, samples for virus detection were collected regardless of any respiratory symptoms. A sample was defined as asymptomatic if the child had no respiratory symptoms 1 full week before and 1 full week after sampling. A sample was defined as symptomatic if the child had any respiratory symptoms 1 week before and 1 week after sampling. Parents collected the samples for virus detection by rubbing 1 nostril and posterior oropharynx of their child with separate cotton-tipped swabs. Feasibility of virus sampling by the parents has been described earlier (9). The study was approved by the local medical ethics committee, and the parents gave written informed consent.",

Here we report that WUPyV and KIPyV were the only viruses found in several samples, most of them originating from symptomatic episodes. Although these findings suggest a pathogenic role for both viruses, more extensive data are needed to establish their definite role in respiratory disease. In addition, we stress that we did not look for parainfluenza virus, human bocavirus, and coronavirus HKU1 in our study. We cannot exclude the fact that these viruses might be present in the samples in which only KIPyV or WUPyV was detected.",

One study reported that WUPyV was detected in sequential samples of 2 immunocompromised patients for 6\u20138 weeks; 1 child was 16 months and the other 4 years of age (5). In the present study, positive episodes of WUPyV were interrupted by intervals during which no virus was detected in some children; however, the low viral load in these samples (high cycle threshold values) may have been below the detection limit in these negative intervals. In addition, we cannot exclude the possibility that poor collection techniques of samples with low viral loads resulted in failure to detect WUPyV.",
