            "text": "The 2003 epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) resulted in over 8,000 cases worldwide with a mortality rate of approximately 10% (Manocha et al. 2003; Centers for Disease Control 2004). The last known outbreak occurred in a research lab in Beijing in 2004. The cause of this disease was identified as a novel human coronavirus with probable origins in civets and a possible reservoir in bats (Guan et al. 2003; Lau et al. 2005; Wang et al. 2006). Coronaviruses are enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses that range from 60 to 220 nm in size. They can infect birds and mammals, including humans, and are transmitted through aerosols or the fecal-oral route. The rapid spread of coronaviruses during outbreaks suggests the primary mode of transmission of human coronaviruses is respiratory droplets; however, there is no direct evidence to support this (Belshe 1984). Since coronavirus infection in humans up to this point has been characterized as a mild, self-limiting condition, there is limited information on its transmission potential through the environment.",

The fact that SARS-CoV can replicate in the enteric tract (Leung et al. 2003) makes it a possible enteric pathogen, and the incidence of diarrhea ranging from 8 to 73% in SARS cases (SARS Epidemiology Working Group 2003) causes concern about its potential environmental transmission. Leung et al. (2003) also reported that viral cultures from SARS patients recovered higher yields from the small intestine than the lung tissues, which are the target organs of this virus. Infectious virus has been cultured from stools of SARS patients up to 3 weeks post infection (Chan et al. 2004; Liu et al. 2004). The advent of SARS and the question of its transmission indicate the need for more information, specifically the survival of coronavirus in water and wastewater. This study compared the survival of representative coronaviruses and poliovirus 1 in tap water and wastewater.",

PV-1 was titered in 6-well plastic cell culture plates by the plaque assay method (Payment and Trudel 1993). This is a direct quantitative method with a minimum detection limit of 10 pfu/ml. Each dilution was plated in duplicate wells. Coronaviruses, which do not form plaques in cell culture, were titered in 24-well plastic cell culture plates by the tissue culture infectious dose 50% technique (TCID50) (Payment and Trudel 1993). This technique determines the dilution at which 50% of the wells show CPE. Taking the inverse log of this dilution gives a titer of the virus per ml TCID50. The minimum detection for this method was 3.7 viruses per ml. Each dilution was plated in a minimum of 8 wells. Any samples that were not from test waters filtered prior to adding virus had to be filtered before assaying on cell culture to eliminate bacterial contamination. The 0.2 \u03bcm low protein binding Millex filters (Millipore, Billerica, MA) with polyethersulfone (PES) membrane were prepared by passing 3% beef extract (Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD) at pH 7 through to block sites that might adsorb virus.

The most critical influence on virus survival is temperature. It has been shown that virus survival decreases with increasing temperature, mainly caused by denaturation of proteins and increased activity of extracellular enzymes (Hurst et al. 1980; John and Rose 2005). The results of the tap water study verify that this is the case with coronavirus. By testing filtered tap water, we reduced or eliminated the influence of particulate organic matter and bacteria. At room temperature it required only 10 days to result in a 99.9% reduction of coronavirus in filtered tap water, while at 4\u00b0C this level of virus inactivation would require over 100 days. The survival of PV-1 in tap water at 4\u00b0C was similar to the coronavirus, but at room temperature (23\u00b0C) this virus survived six times longer in both the filtered and unfiltered water. The survival of the three study viruses in tap water at room temperature (23\u00b0C) and 4\u00b0C are shown in Figs. 1 and 2, respectively. The increase in virus titer over time from the initial titer in the 4\u00b0C water can be attributed to the tendency of viruses to form aggregates that then disaggregate, not from viral replication in the sample.\n\n",

The level of organic matter and suspended solids in the test waters increased from tap water to secondary effluent to primary effluent. Coronavirus inactivation was greater in filtered tap water than unfiltered tap water. Furthermore, HCoV survived longer in unfiltered primary effluent over the filtered. This suggests that higher solids do provide protection for coronaviruses in water. For PV-1, however, filtration made very little difference in its survival in tap water. In the primary effluent, PV-1 survived three times longer in the filtered primary effluent than the unfiltered. It is important to note that there was a substantial decrease in titer of the coronaviruses between the time of addition to the wastewater and the immediate retrieval for testing (zero time point). The titer of the coronaviruses immediately decreased 99.9% upon addition to the wastewater, while the PV-1 titer only dropped 10%. This decrease may be due to the presence of solvents and detergents in wastewater that would compromise the viral envelope and ultimately inactivate the virus. This may also indicate that coronaviruses adsorb more readily than PV-1 to solids in the wastewater. The hydrophobicity of the viral envelope makes coronaviruses less soluble in water and could therefore increase the tendency of these viruses to adhere to the solids. Wastewater samples had to be filtered to prevent bacterial contamination of the cell monolayer, which would remove solids and any solids-associated viruses as well.",

All three test viruses were able to survive longer in the unfiltered primary effluent than the unfiltered secondary effluent, though for FIPV this was negligible.

            "text": "The results of this study indicate that coronaviruses are much more sensitive to temperature than PV-1 and that there is a considerable difference in survivability between PV-1 and the coronaviruses in wastewater. This may be due in part to the fact that enveloped viruses are less stable in the environment than nonenveloped viruses. Coronaviruses die off very rapidly in wastewater, with a 99.9% reduction in 2\u20133 days, which is comparable to the data on SARS-CoV survival (Wang et al. 2005a, b). Survival of the coronaviruses in primary wastewater was only slightly longer than secondary wastewater, probably due to the higher level of suspended solids that offer protection from inactivation. PV-1 survived substantially longer than coronaviruses, requiring 10 days for a comparable reduction in primary wastewater and 5 days in secondary wastewater. This study demonstrates that the transmission of coronaviruses would be less than enteroviruses in the aqueous environment due to the fact that coronaviruses are more rapidly inactivated in water and wastewater at ambient temperatures.",
