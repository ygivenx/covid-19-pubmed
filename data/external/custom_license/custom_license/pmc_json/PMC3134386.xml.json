            "text": "Smallpox, which was caused by infectionwith the variola virus, was one of the most deadly diseasesin human history with a mortality rate of up to 50%    [1, 2]. Fortunately, this disease was completely eradicated throughout the world by 1980 after the introduction of a global smallpox vaccination campaign    [3]. During this process, vaccinia virus, which shares broad antigenic properties with the variola virus, played an essential role as an effective vaccine in inducing protective immunity against smallpox    [3\u20135]. It is well accepted that vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies are critical to protection    [6\u20138]. The fear of variola virus being deliberately released in potential bioterrorism attacks and the increasing use of vaccinia as vaccine vectors for other diseases such as AIDS have led to more recent studies aimed at understanding the protective immune responses induced by the smallpox vaccine    [9, 10]. It is, therefore, necessary to investigate the neutralizing antibody responses induced by historically used smallpox vaccines via different route of vaccination. ",

Accordingly, the original VTT was isolated from the skin lesion of a smallpox patient in China around 1926 followed by extensive passages of 3 times in monkeys, 5 in rabbits, 3 in bovines, then twice in rabbits and 3 times in bovines, repeatedly [12, 13]. Genetic analysis of VTT genome, however, suggested that it is a vaccinia strain instead of a variola viral variant    [14]. The clinical safety of this vaccine has not been clearly documented although VTT was historically used for millions of people. These issues are essential for a safe smallpox vaccine [15]. The biological characteristics of VTT have been described in our recent studies    [16, 17]. It was reported that VTT caused larger lesions after intradermal vaccination and was likely more virulent than other widely used smallpox vaccines such as Lister or Wyeth    [12, 18]. To date, whether or not VTT can induce protective neutralizing antibody responses through noninvasive mucosal vaccination remains less understood    [19, 20]. ",

Moreover, by conducting homologous and heterologous routes of viral challenges, we aimed to determine the efficacy of VTT for protection and to identify a strategy to overcome preexisting immunity to VTT-based vaccines. This study involved a safe, nonpathogenic viral challenge model using a high dose of modified VTT, namely, MVTT-S, which expresses the spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV. Since S is not expressed on the surface of vaccinia virus, we aimed to determine the role of anti-VTT neutralizing antibody (Nab) responses in achieving protection by evaluating the seroconversion to S. Our results have implications for understanding an aspect of vaccinia-induced protective immunity and for developing vaccinia-based vaccines.",

This is a critical question because VTT was historically used as a smallpox  vaccine for millions of people yet its potential use as a noninvasive vaccine remains elusive. To address this question, four groups of mice were inoculated with an optimal dose of 106 PFU VTT via s.c, i.m., i.n., and i.o. routes, respectively. Another group of mice received a placebo as controls. Three weeks after inoculation, the animals were tested for the production of anti-VTT Nabs using a newly developed FACS-based MVTT-GFP neutralization assay (Figure 1(a))    [24]. Since the sample quantity is small, pooled sera were tested for each experimental group. The pooled sera contain an equal amount of serum of individualmicein eachgroup. We found that each route of vaccination was able to induce anti-VTT Nab responses after one-time vaccination (Figure 1(b)). The levels of anti-VTT Nabs, however, varied depending on the route of vaccination. Apparently, higher levels of Nabs were induced via the i.n. and i.o. inoculations when compared with the i.m. and s.c. routes. The serum dilution factors based on the IC50 value via the different routes (i.n., i.o., i.m., and s.c.) were 1 : 711, 1 : 2370, 1 : 428, and 1 : 32, respectively.",

Despite the virulent effects of VTT (e.g., body weight changes) during the acute phase of vaccination, all mice survived for continuous observation. After six months of the vaccination, serum samples were collected and subsequently subjected to the same neutralization assay. Interestingly, although the IC50 was not significantly improved for the i.o. group, the rest of three groups of mice, especially the i.n. group, developed higher levels of lasting antivaccinia Nabs when compared to the early time point (Figures 1(b) and 1(c)), suggesting a prolonged VTT-antigen stimulation to immune system. The serum dilution factors based on the IC50 value via the different routes (i.n. and i.o. versus i.m. and s.c.) were 1 : 2265 and 1 : 2397 (average 1 : 2331) versus 1 : 671 and 1 : 387 (average 1 : 529), respectively (Table 1).

MVTT-S challenges, respectively, without any detectable anti-S Nabs (Figure 2(a)). In contrast, MVTT-S challenges resulted in high levels of anti-S Nabs in VTT-na\u00efve or nonvaccinated mice after the second challenge (Figure 2(a)). The IC50 values reached over 1 : 10,000 serum dilution titer. Moreover, i.m. VTT vaccination also protected mice completely against i.n. and i.o. MVTT-S challenges, respectively (Figure 2(a)). Here, the lack of detectable anti-S Nabs after two consecutive MVTT-S challenges likely suggests a possible complete protection (Figure 2(a)). Notably, the s.c. VTT vaccination did not completely protect mice against i.n. or i.o. MVTT-S challenges as anti-S antibodies were readily detected three weeks after the second challenge (Figure 2(b)). Since the mean anti-S IC50 titer of all s.c. vaccinated mice was significantly lower than that of all nonvaccinated controls (1 : 1778 versus 1 : 14678, P = .03) (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)), we speculated that at least partial significant protection was achieved by the s.c. VTT vaccination. This P = .03 value was determined by comparing the anti-S mean value of the s.c. vaccinated group (1 : 1598, 1 : 1026, and 1 : 2710, with an average value of 1 : 1778) versus control group (1 : 14261, 1 :  8251, and 1 : 21523, with an average value of 1 : 14678). It is possible that the less protection of s.c. vaccinated mice is related to lower levels of anti-VTT neutralizing antibodies induced (Figure 1(a) and Table 1). Since MVTT-S causes transient viremia and infection in mice as we recently described    [19], our efforts to detect live challenge virus around three weeks after each challenge in all groups were unsuccessful.",

Therefore, we measured the levels of anti-VTT Nab responses after each of the two MVTT-S challenges. We found that the first MVTT-S challenge boosted the levels of anti-VTT Nabs significantly, confirming its shared neutralizing determinants with VTT (Figure 4(a)). The average serum dilution factor of antivaccinia Nabs among i.m., i.n., and i.o. VTT-vaccinated mice had reached comparable levels with IC50 values of 1 : 3303, 1 : 5109, and 1 : 4727, respectively, which is not statistically significant (Figure 4(a)). This P value was calculated from the average values of anti-VTT Nabs after the first challenge from three groups: i.m. (1 : 3288, 1 : 2065, and 1 : 4555, with an average of 1 : 3303), i.n.

In addition, we determined the anti-VTT Nab response after the second challenge of MVTT-S. We found that the average serum dilution titer of anti-VTT Nabs among i.m., i.n., and i.o. pre-VTT-vaccinated mice had likely saturated at comparable levels with the IC50 values of 1 : 3410, 1 : 4434, and 1 : 5276, respectively, which is not statistically significant (Figure 4(b)). This P value was calculated from the average values of anti-VTT Nabs after the second challenge from three groups: i.m. (1 : 6280, 1 : 1587, and 1 : 2362, with an average of 1 : 3410), i.n.

To our knowledge, this study is the first to provide a parallel experimental comparison of four different routes of VTT vaccination for inducing protective efficacy in a mouse model. We provide evidence that one-time vaccination with VTT through each of four different routes was able to induce long-lasting antivaccinia Nab responses in mice. Apparently, higher levels (4.4-fold) of the Nab responses were induced via the mucosal i.n. and i.o. inoculations when compared with the i.m. and s.c. routes. Moreover, the i.n. and i.o. VTT vaccination likely protected animals completely from two consecutive mucosal challenges of the MVTT-S strain via either homologous (i.n. and i.o.) or heterologous (i.o. and i.n.) routes, respectively, (Figure 2(a)). As controls, s.c. VTT vaccination did not achieve full protection against i.m., i.n., or i.o. MVTT-S challenges, respectively, (Figure 2(b)). While i.m. VTT vaccination fully protected animals from i.n. and i.o. MVTT-S challenges, i.m., i.n., and i.o. VTT-vaccinated animals were not fully protected from i.m. challenges (Figures 2(a) and 3). Our results, therefore, suggested that the route of VTT vaccination is critical for inducing protection in mice. In the meantime, the finding that i.m. MVTT-S challenge overcomes preexisting antivaccinia immunity induced via mucosal routes has implications for MVTT-based mucosal vaccine development. ",

It has been demonstrated that Nabs induced by vaccinia vaccine play an essential role in providing sterile immunity against smallpox infections    [25, 26]. Here we show that VTT displays an advantage for inducing higher levels of antivaccinia Nabs through the noninvasive mucosal route of vaccination. The underlying mechanism of this finding remains largely unknown, although we have recently provided evidence that the tissue tropism may play a role in affecting the immunogenicity of a vaccinia-based vaccine    [19]. Since VTT and its variants unlikely establish long-term persistent infection in mice, mechanisms for the maintenance of immunological memory for lasting Nabs remain to be further investigated [8]. One study showed that antigen can be retained in the draining lymph nodes for extended periods of time    [27]. Whether this finding would have implications for the continuous maturation of VTT-induced Nabs observed in our study will require future studies. We acknowledge that different route of vaccination may have different protective effects. We did not conduct a direct comparison between intradermal (i.d.) vaccination with other routes because i.d. vaccination did not seem to induce high levels of Nabs in our previous studies    [17]. We, however, will compare the skin scarification vaccination with other routes in our future studies as it conferred sterile protection in humans against smallpox infection historically. ",

In this study, we developed a convenient model for animal challenge based on testing of the antibody response to the highly immunogenic S protein. Through our protocol, the preparation of vaccinia virus was mostly intracellular mature virion (IMV) particles. Since the S spike protein was not located on the IMV by Western blot analysis (data not shown), the MVTT-S particles themselves cannot induce S-specific antibodies unless they enter the cells and initiate infection. This design provides anti-S antibody as a valuable biological indicator for protection of MVTT-S challenge in mice and eliminates the biosafety issues related to the restricted use of pathogenic vaccinia WR by laboratory regulations [28], as well as helps to reduce study costs. Nonpathogenic viral challenge model has previously been used to study the neutralizing antibody-mediated protection against immunodeficiency viral infection    [29]. We, however, recognize the limitation of our experimental system because there might be major differences between lethal and nonpathogenic vaccinia challenge systems. For example, NKT-cells, CD8+ CTLs together with Nabs may be involved in protection against a highly pathogenic virus    [30]. This issue should be further studied in future studies.",

            "text": "Mucosal VTT vaccination elicited protection against both homologous and heterologous routes of mucosal MVTT-S challenges. Our results have provided scientific evidence that mucosal VTT vaccination (e.g., one time i.n. or i.o. VTT vaccination in this study) likely confers complete protection against mucosal routes of viral challenges (Figure 2(a)), which is consistent to previous findings    [14, 31]. These findings are relevant to smallpox prevention because the vaccination likely provided a protective barrier at the dominant portal of variola viral entry, in the mucosa. This is concluded by the fact that the transmission of smallpox occurs mainly through inhalation of airborne variola virus, usually droplets expressed from the oral, nasal, or pharyngeal mucosa of an infected person [32]. Critically, the role of mucosal immunization with a smallpox vaccine has been demonstrated in previous studies    [33, 34]. Since four groups of mice all developed systemic antivaccinia Nabs before MVTT-S challenges (Figure 1(c)), we speculated that higher levels (4.4-fold) of the Nab responses induced via the mucosal i.n. and i.o. inoculations compared with the s.c. route might have played a role in blocking MVTT-S challenge completely. To this end, the rapidly recalled high levels of anti-VTT Nabs after the MVTT-S challenges might also contribute to this protection (Figure 4(a)). In spite of these findings, extra attentions should be paid when VTT is used as a human smallpox vaccine for mucosal vaccination due to (1) its in vivo toxicity or virulence    [16] as well as (2) its complicated quasispecies containing a group of viral variants [14]. As a substitute, it is evident to use a safely attenuated and homogenous MVTT strain to conduct mucosal smallpox vaccinations [14]. ",

This is often an issue for the clinical development of a vaccinia-based vaccine. Previous studies indicated that mucosal vaccination overcomes preexisting antivaccinia immunity generated through skin vaccination    [35, 36]. Consistently, we showed that i.n. or i.o. MVTT-S challenges overcame preexisting antivaccinia immunity generated through s.c. VTT vaccination for inducing anti-S Nabs (Figure 2(b))    [17]. Moreover, we now provide a new finding that i.m. MVTT-S challenges overcome preexisting antivaccinia immunity generated through s.c., i.n., or i.o. route of VTT vaccination (Figures 2(a) and 3). Our findings have implications either for overcoming the preexisting antivaccinia immunity or for improving the immunogenicity of a vaccinia-based vaccine. Since vaccinia-based vaccines have been developed for inducing protective immune responses at the mucosal sites of viral transmission for HIV and other pathogens    [37\u201339], our findings provide evidence to support a new strategy of heterologous routes of prime and boost vaccination using the same vaccine. In comparison to heterologous prime and boost regimens using different viral vectors    [40, 41], this is an area of interest for further investigations. ",
