We expect better health, secure food, clean water, and more comfort from limited natural resources. Balancing competing demands of human health, animal health, and sustainable environmental health is a grand challenge of our time. As the distance between human, domestic animal, and wildlife populations narrows and global trade and travel amplify our connectivity, pathogens shared by humans and animals have concurrently emerged.1 Since 1999, among many examples, humans experienced outbreaks of West Nile virus in the United States and Europe, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus in China, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in the Middle East, and the emergence of the Ebola virus in West Africa. Shared pathogen exchange is perhaps best illustrated in the case of influenza, where humans serve as the source of influenza A virus (IAV) infection of pigs, and, after further evolution of the virus, it returns from pigs to humans, causing new outbreaks. The 2009 influenza outbreak was the most recent example of this cycle of human and animal infection. The failure to address interspecies transmission and ensuing pandemics as a one health issue has created the opportunity for continued emergence of novel IAV like H3N2v that emerged as a human pathogen during the agricultural fair season.2",

Advancement of health at this level of complexity requires integration of medical disciplines spanning individual care to public health, with basic and applied sciences from atomic structure to sociology providing the knowledge base as shown in the Figure. The concept of One Medicine One Science (COMOS) builds on the idea that the basic biological processes underlying health and disease share common features such that medical knowledge and expertise in one species is relevant and applicable to other species. The scientific approach that expands our understanding of biological processes and the rational basis for medical practice is the same for all species. Thus, COMOS provides common ground to assist the organization of interdisciplinary groups to seek solutions to health challenges at local and global scales. Another aspect of COMOS is development of forums that, in addition to medical and scientific participants, includes industry, governmental and nongovernmental policy makers, and funders to assist in communicating the interconnectedness of human, animal and environmental health to a broad audience so that development of public policies that guide health priorities and investments at the national and international level are informed by the best scientific knowledge.",

At the international launch of the GHSA, the United States and 30 other countries, the World Health Organization (WHO), Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) agreed to work to prevent, detect, and respond to global infectious disease threats from the perspective of one health.

This limitation has resulted in a perceived and apparent separation of science and policy, sometimes diluting the utility of the one health movement. This article builds on the discussions and dialogue about the science of one health and its connection to policy that were held at the International Conference on One Medicine One Science (iCOMOS; www.icomos.umn.edu) in 2014 and to be held again in 2016.4 In particular, it was concluded that the key roles of food and medicine in addressing health needs of a changing world require the support of rigorous science that empowers informed decision-making and development of useful policies. The goal of iCOMOS is to examine the connections between science and one health policy implementation by (1) focusing on case studies and research that demonstrate the successful integration of human, animal, plant, and environmental health and social and behavioral sciences; (2) examining the science-policy connection by convening panels that include scientists, policy makers, and representatives from private industry; and (3) conducting forward-looking workshops in areas of research, collaboration, and policy formulation. iCOMOS-2014 was focused on 2 of the most important grand challenges of our time\u2014food safety/security and emerging infectious diseases.4,5",

Given that an estimated 870 million people are currently suffering from malnutrition and that the combination of human population growth and consumer preference shifts associated with a rising global middle class are expected to exacerbate this problem, global production and delivery of food for protein, energy, and micronutrients must not just be maintained, it must be increased.6 In addition, existing land and water resources are already strained and their availability for agriculture will likely decrease, especially as the impacts of climate change shift traditional production regions. The obvious solution is to produce more efficiently, yet the very strategies that promote efficient production of food, such as concentrated farming systems, monoculture cropping, and chemical inputs of fertilizer, pesticides, and herbicides, have unintended consequences that threaten human, animal, and environmental health.7 We are faced with a paradox in which the demand for increased food production to improve human health today sows the seeds of resource depletion that limit health advances tomorrow. Thus, new research on the direct and indirect impacts of food production on human, animal, and environmental health as well as social, organizational, and behavioral sustainability should be a priority.",

Consumer demand for local and organic production systems actually increases the greenhouse gas footprint of most developed and many developing country food systems, depending on the crop or animal product8-10 and also can increase food safety risks relative to today's widely used production systems.11 Those producers that remain local are often small in size, thus limiting benefits of scale, and many use organic methods, which can limit their ability to prevent disease through approaches such as constructing barriers and facilities for containment. The result is increased contact with wildlife, which increases opportunities for the transmission of infectious diseases to crops, livestock, and humans. For instance, interaction between domestic poultry and wild waterfowl reservoirs has resulted in the introduction of new IAV,12 and the movement of H5 HPAI from domestic poultry to free-flying bird populations demonstrates that the exchange can be bidirectional,13 which changes paradigms of transboundary disease spread.",

Housing food animals inside helps to protect animal health, prevent cross-species disease transmission, and improve production efficiency, but it does not always meet consumer preference for local needs and resources. Nontherapeutic (nonclinical) antibiotic use in food animals is a tool that promotes production efficiency, but it has been associated with a rise in antibiotic resistance of human pathogens. However, epidemiological and ecological studies fail to support a causal link; instead, these studies indicate the spread of antibiotic resistance from humans to pigs and chickens.14 In the future, the World Food Summit global food strategy of \u201cproviding access for all people at all times to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food to maintain a healthy and active life\u201d must be expanded to include considerations for environmental sustainability, animal welfare and non-nutritional aspects of public health.15 Progress toward these goals requires strong linkage of scientific knowledge and discovery that helps both to advance medical practice and health improvement as well as inform health policy development.",

Loss of crossreactive immunity has opened an ecological niche that can and has been replaced by related orthopoxviruses, including monkeypox in the Congo and novel orthopoxvirus in the country of Georgia.21 Emergence of new orthopoxvirus outbreaks with pandemic potential is possible as human-infectious poxviruses circulate in natural reservoirs. The recent discovery of viable smallpox in a US Food and Drug Administration refrigerator on the National Institutes of Health (NIH) campus recently reinvigorated the discussion of both susceptibility and/or risks from infections to smallpox.22 The specter of a new pandemic, fueled by relatively recent experience with the emergence of AIDS and new influenza viruses, has driven the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the NIH-National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the US Department of Agriculture, the US Agency for International Development, and others to develop programs focused on predictive modeling of and early detection and response to novel pathogens that have evolved under a complex set of pressures such as environmental pollution, land use changes, new trade patterns, climatic change, and other anthropogenic factors. The role of medicine in addressing individual and public health needs to be supported by rigorous science that empowers informed decision-making and development of useful policies in the face of unexpected disease threats.",

Experts hypothesize that Ebola virus entered the West African population through consumption of infected fruit bats, a plausible scenario given local food needs and practices.23,24 The ongoing outbreak has stressed social organization and an already thin public health infrastructure to the breaking point in the affected countries. It threatens to exacerbate baseline food insecurity as disease control measures and fear shut down food and agriculture systems, further stressing local food security.25 This situation makes for the \u201cperfect storm\u201d of grand challenges in the one health arena. Frighteningly, while more than 27 000 cases and 11 200 deaths have been recorded as of July 14, 2015, a new ecological niche risk model predicts that 22 million people in 22 Central and West African countries are at potential risk for Ebola.26,27 While the world seems to be stepping up with much-needed scientific, medical, and infrastructure support to this tragedy, broader policies and preparedness are needed for prevention, containment, and response if we are to avoid more extreme human suffering from the virus itself as well as malnutrition, community instability, and other social consequences.",

But the universal scientific discovery and exploration approaches that have been applied so effectively to resolve focused problems offer promise in addressing the complex health issues of modern life. A linear refocusing of health research away from disease surveillance and investigation resulting primarily in treatment toward environmental surveillance resulting in prediction and prevention is not enough to inform societal debates on these complex health issues. Reducing challenges to simple scenarios allows us to find solutions that do not address the complex problems we face but instead bring on a myriad of unintended and undesirable consequences. Grand challenges do not have simple solutions. Rather, they represent \u201cwicked problems\u201d that are complex and difficult-to-balance dilemmas with fluid dynamics whose competing components change over time.28 The creation of forums for convergence on grand challenges where science and policy can be debated together, missing pieces identified, and science-based collaborations stimulated in the presence of industry, governmental and nongovernmental policy makers, and funders is an essential step. The underpinnings of COMOS\u2014ie, promoting team science that builds on the expertise of different disciplines, stakeholders, and research foci to support policy development\u2014is all the more relevant to the implementation of one health and the successful achievement of global health security goals (Figure). Universal scientific discovery and exploration approaches that have been applied so effectively to advance human society will need to be applied to complex health issues of modern life so that the resulting knowledge can inform public policy and decision-making at every level.",
