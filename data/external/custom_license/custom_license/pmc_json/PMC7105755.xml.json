Functional protein arrays display folded and active proteins and are designed to assay functional properties [6\u20138]. They are used for screening molecular interactions, studying protein pathways, identifying targets for PTMs and analyzing enzymic activities. On analytical or capture arrays, affinity reagents (e.g., antibodies) or antigens (that may be nonfolded) are arrayed for profiling the expression of proteins [9,10] or for the quantification of antibodies [11] in complex samples such as serum. Applications of antibody arrays include biomarker discovery and monitoring of protein quantities and activity states in signaling pathways. Antigen arrays are applied for profiling antibody repertoires in autoimmunity, cancer, infection or following vaccination. Moreover, antigen arrays are tools for controlling the specificity of antibodies and related affinity reagents. Reverse-phase arrays comprise cell lysates [12,13] or serum samples [14]. Analysis is multiplexed by probing replicates of the arrays with different antibodies. Reverse-phase arrays are particularly useful for studying the changes in the expression of specific proteins and protein modifications during disease progression and, thus, are primarily applied for biomarker discovery.",

However, some eukaryotic proteins are poorly expressed in E. coli or are produced, but at low solubility, and eukaryotic PTMs are lacking in prokaryotic cells. Screening assays have been developed for the rapid assessment of protein solubility, including using reporter proteins to directly monitor protein expression and correct folding [17\u201319]. Cell-free protein synthesis provides an effective and rapid alternative by using PCR DNA fragments as templates, circumventing the need for E. coli cloning [16,20]. Cell-free methods are capable of making proteins that are difficult to express in in vivo systems. Cell-free lysates can be prepared from different species, allowing protein synthesis to be carried out in prokaryotic or eukaryotic systems and at defined temperatures. These open systems can also be adjusted through the addition of further components, so as to provide environments suitable for protein folding or modifications [20]. In conventional methods, proteins expressed by E. coli or cell-free systems are purified prior to spotting onto the array surface. Purification is usually performed using affinity tags attached at either the N- or C-terminus, of which the most popular tags are hexahistidine (His6) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) [3,21]. By contrast, by spotting unpurified tagged proteins onto capture surfaces, the immobilization and purification steps can be combined into a single step [22].",

Unlike arraying of DNA samples, procedures for spotting functional proteins must ensure that they are hydrated, stable and folded during the process. However, the distributed volumes of solutions are typically in the subnanoliter range and the spots are therefore prone to drying rapidly by evaporation. Buffers for protein arraying therefore need to combine physiological conditions and compatibility with both the surface-immobilzation mechanism and the robotic-arraying process in terms of viscosity and surface tension. Typical buffer additives for protein stabilization against drying are hydroxylated cryoprotectants (e.g., glycerol, polyethylene glycol, trehalose and sucrose), but their effectiveness must be evaluated with the surface of choice [31,32]. Several new non-nucleophilic substances have recently been identified as buffer additives that improve spot morphology without interfering with immobilization [33]. An innovative method for preventing droplet evaporation was demonstrated by spotting under a layer of water-immiscible liquid fluorocarbon, coupled with a liquid-bridge, noncontact spotting technology [34]. Depending on the types of slides and the viscosity of the buffer used, printing density can generally be up to 20,000 individual features on a standard microscope slide, corresponding to a center-to-center spacing of spots in the range of 250 \u00b5m [35].",

The newly synthesized proteins become trapped by the antibody colocalized at each spot (Figure 2B). NAPPA has been applied to produce protein arrays (up to 2000 spots per slide) identifying immune-response signatures of breast cancer autoantibodies in patient sera [39,40] and to isolate target proteins with agonist activities from a cDNA library [41]. As the proteins immobilized by NAPPA remain on the same surface as the DNA array, the technology does not generate a \u2018pure\u2019 protein array, but rather one in which individual proteins are colocalized with both their encoding DNA and the general capture reagent.",

Unlike NAPPA, the DNA array to protein array method generates pure protein arrays on a separate surface. Cell-free protein synthesis is carried out within a membrane filter sandwiched between two glass slides. One of the slides carries an array of immobilized PCR DNA fragments encoding tagged proteins, while the other slide is coated with a specific tag-capture reagent. Individual proteins are synthesized in parallel from the DNA template array, diffuse through the membrane filter and become immobilized on the capture surface, creating a protein array corresponding to the DNA array (but with a mirror-image layout). Fully consistent with the concept that diffusion is the mechanism of protein transport to the capture slide, the protein-density profiles of DAPA protein spots are well-defined Gaussian distributions. DAPA is capable of producing at least 20 copies of the same protein array by the repeated use of a single DNA array template [3]. This technique may find particular use for the repeated printing of protein arrays in laboratories that do not have access to microarray spotters. DAPA has been validated by arraying a number of different proteins, including antibody fragments, green fluorescent protein and transcription factors [3].",

In antibody arrays, such sandwich-detection strategies provide a second level of target recognition, significantly increasing the specificity and sensitivity (down to picogram per milliliter) of target detection. Enhanced sensitivity can also be achieved with a number of amplification systems. Tyramide signal amplification uses peroxidase-coupled reagents to catalyze the coupling of reactive fluorophore derivatives to tyrosine residues in the vicinity [3,50] and can detect femtogram amounts of protein. DNA-based technologies, such as rolling circle amplification (RCA) [10,51\u201353], as well as proximity ligation of oligonucleotides coupled to antibodies recognizing different epitopes [54,55], provide high levels of amplification, essentially converting from protein to DNA detection. Quantum dots are emerging as the new-generation fluorophores for ultrasensitive readout of binding events [13,56].

Their relative binding strengths, as determined on the array surface, were also in good agreement with those from solution-based studies [67].

A total of 110 pairwise interactions were identified, of which 63 were previously unknown [4].

The regulatory functions of the proteins for a wide range of targets and cellular activities were revealed. Unknown interactions were also identified directly from cell lysates using arrays of functional protein-interaction domains, such as SH2, SH3, PDZ, WW, FF, PH, FHA and 14.3.3 [24]. In an approach based on parallel capture of native protein complexes from lysates of differentially stimulated T cells, peptide microarrays were used for the analysis of signaling-dependent protein-interaction networks [48]. Functional arrays of nuclear hormone receptors and coactivators were used for the systematic detection of receptor dimerization, functional classification of recruited coactivators and pharmacological characterization of receptor ligands [69].

To help reduce these problems, the \u2018Antibodypedia\u2019 database has been established, providing details of individual antibody validation from publicly available resources [90].",

Proteome-wide antigen arrays generated through cell-free synthesis of 185 proteins from vaccinia virus [91,92] or 1700 proteins from Francisella tularensis have been used to study humoral immune responses to infection with these agents [93]. They produced specific antibody profiles in sera from vaccinated or infected humans and animals that, in turn, facilitated the rational design of vaccines and diagnostic antigens [94].

For example, the patterns of antibody reactivity in multiple sclerosis sera identified by antigen microarrays, comprising heat-shock proteins, lipid autoantigens and CNS proteins, distinguished as different forms of the disease [97]. A remarkable \u2018myelin proteome\u2019 antigen microarray has been used to identify \u2018epitope spreading\u2019 through profiling the evolution of autoantibody responses that, in turn, guided the design of tolerizing DNA vaccines for encephalomyelitis [98]. To address autoimmune events associated with neurological disorders, cerebrospinal fluid, rather than serum, has also been studied on antigen microarrays [99]. As well as in the established autoimmune diseases themselves, profiling autoantibodies may be a future means of cancer diagnosis, and the antigens identified may also be potential immunotherapeutics [100]. A conformational protein array containing 329 folded and functional autoantigens was capable of detecting serum antibody profiles from non-small-cell lung cancer patients [101]. Reverse-phase antigen arrays, prepared by directly spotting various dilutions of lysates from 60 human cancer cell lines, have led to the identification of two promising pathological markers distinguishing colon from ovarian adenocarcinomas [50]. Reverse-phase arrays allowed profiling of protein levels from as few as three cell protein equivalents in samples of primary leukemia and hematopoetic stem cells [102].",

This was demonstrated for the ErbB receptor tyrosine kinase pathway using lysates of human tumor cell lines and antibody microarrays. This approach also enabled the characterization of the inhibitory profile of a small-molecule inhibitor on the pathway level [105]. To facilitate our understanding of pathways and their changes in disease, the effects of drugs and growth factors on the PTMs of specific proteins in normal and tumor cells have been studied by antibody microarrays [106,107]. A reverse-phase microarray approach has been successfully applied to discover distinct pathway-activation differences among breast cancer cell lines, demonstrating the use of array-based analysis for multiple pharmacodynamic biomarkers responding to targeted kinase inhibitors [108]. Additional signaling pathways or defects can be ascertained by exposing tumor cells or other diseased tissues to cytokines, chemokines or other bioactive molecules, using antibody arrays [85] or reverse-phase arrays [102]. In the future, it should be possible to reconstitute the complex pathways connecting the genome and the proteome in normal and diseased states through combining protein microarrays with genomic-profiling technologies. However, undertaking multiplexed quantitative analysis of protein\u2013ligand interactions on microarrays, even with purified individual domains of the same functional families, requires careful standardization to avoid pitfalls due to dissimilar behavior of the proteins and variable densities of active proteins. These considerations and the danger of relying on single concentration determinations have been discussed with respect to binding of phosphopeptides by an arrayed set of SH2 domains [2].",

For example, an array of 1690 proteins from Arabidopsis thaliana was screened with MPK3 and MPK6, respectively, followed by antiphosphotyrosine antibodies, leading to the identification of 48 and 39 candidate substrates for MPK3 and MPK6, respectively [112]. In another study illustrating the power of functional yeast proteome arrays, substrate screening identified candidate targets for each of the 87 yeast kinases [113]. Such discovery approaches are complemented by reverse-phase and antibody microarrays for the parallel analysis of known protein phosphorylations. Using reverse-phase microarrays, site-specific phosphorylation of 62 signaling proteins from IL-2 -stimulated T cells was detected, revealing differential protein phosphorylation [114]. Antibody microarrays have been employed for the time-resolved monitoring of cell-signaling pathways by quantifying both the amount and the phosphorylation status of signaling proteins [115].",

This has been achieved by immobilizing mixtures of enzymes in different ratios on an array surface. Activities and efficiencies of different enzymes were analyzed by product detection. Two-step sequential reactions, catalyzed by either luciferase or nucleoside diphosphate kinase, and a five-step pathway for trehalose synthesis, have been demonstrated [119]. This approach provides a means of optimizing enzyme proportions for maximal pathway-output efficiency. An interesting application using metabolizing enzyme arrays for toxicologic screening of drugs has been described with arrayed P450 isozymes [120].

A library-scanning strategy was described in which each individual position in a 25-mer peptide was randomized by the other 19 amino acids to generate 25 peptide libraries [121].

Current commercial array production methods are generally based on separate expression and purification of proteins; thus, they are prohibitively expensive, with costs of approximately US$1000 per slide. Typically, academic applications require customized arrays displaying proteins of interest rather than complete proteome arrays. Moreover, protein arrays for species other than humans and the most widespread model organisms are not commercially available. Another problem is their limited shelf life, especially for functional protein arrays. We expect that the in situ methods for protein-array generation will contribute to changing this situation, especially approaches such as PISA, NAPPA and DAPA, which offer cheaper and more flexible methods for academic laboratories. While small numbers of customized array slides can be economically produced through in situ synthesis when required, conventional methods that rely on spotting purified proteins are only cost effective if large batches of arrays are produced. The DAPA technique is particularly useful for laboratories without microarraying equipment as it can generate multiple copies of the same protein microarray using a single DNA array template. In current clinical applications, antigen microarrays and reverse-phase arrays are widely applied for profiling antibody repertoires from individual patient samples.",
