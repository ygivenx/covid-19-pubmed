He was fed infant formula in the hospital\u2019s nursery. On postpartum day 7, he had a fever of 39\u00b0C and tachypnea and was taken to a tertiary hospital. Chest radiograph showed a ground-glass opacity in the middle lobe of his right lung, which subsequently developed into cavities. Microbiological testing of sputum and blood specimens yielded no definitive results. His pulmonary condition deteriorated during the following days. The case was reported to the Unknown Pathogen Discovery/Investigation Group at the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control for extensive etiologic survey. Multiplex real-time reverse transcription PCR showed sputum and blood specimens to be negative for adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, coronaviruses (229E, OC43, NL63, HKU1, and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus), metapneumovirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza viruses 1\u20134, herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2, varicella-zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, human herpesviruses 6 and 7, bocavirus, parvovirus, enterovirus, and rhinovirus. However, Legionella pneumophila serogroup 5 was isolated from the sputum specimen. The patient was treated with antibacterial drugs and was discharged on postpartum day 17.",
