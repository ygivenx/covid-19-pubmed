From May 2009 to June 2010, 1,367 nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from children who visited Seoul National University Children's Hospital for acute respiratory symptoms. 12 respiratory viruses (influenza virus A, B; parainfluenza virus 1, 2, 3; respiratory synctytial virus (RSV) A, B; adenovirus; rhinovirus A/B; metapneumovirus; human coronavirus 229E/NL63, OC43/HKU1) were determined by multiplex RT-PCR. S. pneumoniae was isolated using conventional culture methods. Demographics of affected children, characteristics and the impact of pneumococcal carriage on respiratory virus infection were assessed.",

Among the 1,367 nasopharyngeal aspirates, 228 isolates (16.7%) of S. pneumoniae were recovered, and 834 respiratory viruses from 731 (53.5%) nasopharyngeal aspirates were detected. The most common respiratory viruses were as follows: rhinovirus (30.2%), RSV A (17.4%), adenovirus (11.4%), and influenza virus A (11.2%). The pneumococcal carriage rate was higher among those with respiratory virus than those without respiratory virus isolated [21.3% (156/731) vs 11.3% (72/636), P < 0.001)]. Among 12 respiratory viruses tested, influenza A (OR 3.00, 95% CI 1.75-5.14), influenza B (OR 2.73, 95% CI 1.16-6.47), RSV A (OR 2.38, 95% CI 1.56-3.63), RSV B (OR 2.90, 95% CI 1.31-6.41), and rhinovirus A/B (OR 1.96, 95% CI 1.37-2.80) were associated with higher likelihood of pneumococcal carriage.",
