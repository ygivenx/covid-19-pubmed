CoVs have four known genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus. The CoV name is a derivative from the Latin word corona which means crown. This is due to the characteristic structure of the virus whereby surface projections on the viral envelope gives it an appearance similar to a crown. The virus is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus with a genome of around 30 kb in length. This makes them the largest known RNA viruses.8 The RNA genome codes for both structural proteins (SPs) and non-structural proteins (NSPs). All known CoVs share a similar structure made of four main structural proteins: spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. Some CoVs also encode special structural and accessory proteins.9 While the exact functions of most accessory proteins are still currently being researched on, it is recognized that the structural proteins aid the viral infection of host cells and subsequent replication. The S-protein is responsible for attachment to host receptors, M protein helps shape the virion particles and binding to nucleocapsid, E-protein plays a role in the assembly and release of particles while N-protein aids with the binding of the genome to a replication-transcription complex which is required for the replication of genomic material.",

It is widely agreed that these CoVs cause respiratory tract infections and patients can present with a large spectrum of clinical manifestations. 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1 have been known to cause mainly self-limiting upper respiratory tract infections which present with symptoms such as runny nose, sore throat, fever, and cough.15 However, in instances of immunocompromise or underlying cardiopulmonary disease, they can cause pneumonia or bronchitis.16 On the other spectrum, the SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 have been known to causing life-threatening respiratory failure.17",

Despite this, the manifestations of CoVs in other organ systems should not be ignored as they can represent an alternative mode of transmission. For instance, during the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2003, it was reported that a severe outbreak of SARS-CoV occurring at a housing estate in Hong Kong was likely transmitted through the sewage system.20 It was later discovered that SARS-CoV RNA can be detected from stools of infected patients and may even survive through the sewage that has not undergone adequate disinfection.21 Such examples highlight the need for more research into the non-respiratory clinical manifestations of the disease. In fact, it has already been established that the SARS-CoV-2 can be shed through the oral\u2013fecal route as well.22",

This was the HCoV-NL63. The virus was first isolated from a 7-month-old child before being identified in seven additional individuals. During the infection, the child had symptoms and physical examination findings of bronchiolitis and conjunctivitis.23 Together with the SARS-CoV crisis that was happening during that period of time, it triggered greater interest in understanding the spectrum of clinical manifestations associated with the new HCoV-NL63. In 2005, a retrospective study that analyzed the nasal swabs of children with respiratory illnesses from 2000 to 2003 for HCoV-NL63 was conducted in France. In this study, they found that 17% (n = 3) of HCoV-NL63 patients (n = 18) had developed conjunctivitis.24 However, to date, there has not been any further studies detailing the pathogenic mechanisms of HCoV-NL63 in the infection of ocular tissues.",

In 2004, tear samples collected from 36 suspected SARS-CoV patients were sent for RT-PCR for the SARS-CoV. The SARS-CoV RNA was identified in three of these patients. Out of the three, one patient had the RNA identified in all three stool, respiratory swab, and tear samples. One patient had RNA identified in stool and tear samples but the respiratory swab was not sent. The last patient had RNA identified in tear samples only while stool samples were negative and the respiratory swab was not sent. The findings of this study suggested that SARS-CoV can be present in tears and emphasized the need for appropriate precautions to prevent transmission through ocular tissues and secretions.18 However, up till today, it is still unclear how SARS-CoV can end up in tears. Proposed theories include the conjunctiva being the direct inoculation site of SARS-CoV from infected droplets, the migration of upper respiratory tract infection through the nasolacrimal duct or even hematogenous infection of the lacrimal gland. Furthermore, the results were inconsistent across studies. Another study that assessed both tears and conjunctival scrapings from 17 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV infection did not yield any positive result from RT-PCR. The authors attributed the findings to three possibilities. Firstly, the RT-PCR was not sensitive enough to pick up small quantities of SARS-CoV RNA. Secondly, the sample collection was a one time process, which may have missed the window if viral shedding in ocular tissue only lasted for a short period of time. Finally, there is also the possibility that the SARS-CoV did not exist in ocular tissue. However, as the SARS-CoV epidemic died down, these crucial questions were left unanswered.25,26",

On the 22nd of January 2020, Guangfa Wang, a member of the national expert on pneumonia had developed conjunctivitis during an inspection of Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak. He was subsequently tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 but recovered from the infection eventually.27 This has resulted in a call for research into ocular infection as a possible alternative route of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.28,29 As the epidemic is still in its early stages, not much has been published with regards to the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenic mechanisms, especially with respect to ocular tissues. However, from genomic and structural analyses, it has been reported that the SARS-CoV-2 has a similar receptor-binding-motif as SARS-CoV, which allows it to infect host cells via the angiotensin-converting-enzyme-2 (ACE2).30 Interestingly, the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), apart from its well-known endocrine role in blood pressure regulation, also has complicated autocrine functions within specific tissues. The human eye has its own intraocular RAS, a system that has been the interest of many projects focusing on developing anti-glaucomatous drugs. ACE2 has been found in the aqueous humor.31 However, the expression of ACE2 in more anterior tissues such as the conjunctiva or cornea has yet to be established. Hence, more research exploring the hypothesis of SARS-CoV-2 ocular infection through ACE2 has to be conducted.",

Approximately 20\u201360% of domestic cats are seropositive, while in animal shelters, the seropositive rates can approach almost 90%.32 FCoVs can be further classified into two biotypes which reflect very varied clinical presentations. These are the feline enteric CoV (FECV) and the feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV). In majority of these seropositive cases, the FCoVs exist as FECV. For most of the FECV cases, the infection is usually benign or associated with a self-limiting diarrhea.33 This is because FECV has been shown to demonstrate tropism to the apical epithelium of the intestinal villi from the small intestine to the cecum.34 As such, FECV shedding in feline feces is responsible for the fecal\u2013oral spread and maintenance of FECV infection in feline populations, explaining the high seropositive rates of the infection.",

It has been suggested that within the monocytes, the FECV acquires mutations in the genome which result in the transformation to FIPV.36 The FIPV then display an altered cell tropism, infecting monocytes and macrophages more efficiently as compared to FECV. These cells play a pivotal role in the drastically different clinical manifestation of the disease. The FIP disease is characterized by fibrinous and granulomatous serositis, protein-rich serous effusion in body cavities and granulomatous lesions. It has been suggested that the underlying pathogenic mechanism is a vasculitis triggered by the infected monocytes and macrophages leading to endothelial barrier dysfunction and extravasation of these immune cells into the tissue.37 These lesions are multi-systemic and lead to an extremely poor prognosis of the infected felines. Those affected had fever, loss of appetite, and weight loss. The majority of felines who have been experimentally infected with FIPV died within 4\u20135 weeks.38",

Furthermore, the initially healthy offspring, after being kept with the infected parents for 100 days, developed recurrent bouts of conjunctivitis.39 Apart from conjunctivitis, ocular manifestations include pyogranulomatous anterior uveitis, choroiditis with retinal detachment and retinal vasculitis.40 In general, ocular manifestations of FIPV infection have poor prognosis both visually and systemically.",

In the model, the disease is biphasic, characterized by inflammation in the early phase and retinal degeneration in the late phase. After inoculation, the presence of the virus in the retina and retina pigment epithelium will result in the infiltration of immune cells and release of pro-inflammatory mediators. After the first week of infection, viral clearance is achieved. However, subsequently retinal and RPE cell autoantibodies are produced, resulting in progressive loss of photoreceptors and ganglion cells as well as thinning of the neuroretina.49 This suggests an autoimmune process causing majority of the retinal damage.",

Firstly, CoVs are capable of producing a wide spectrum of ocular manifestations from anterior segment pathologies like conjunctivitis and anterior uveitis to sight-threatening conditions like retinitis and optic neuritis.
