            "text": "Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, affecting over six million people worldwide [1]. Pathologically, PD is characterized by the marked degeneration of dopaminergic (DArgic) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Although the mechanism underlying selective degeneration of DArgic neurons is not known completely, the data indicate that oxidative stress has been reported to play important roles [2, 3]. Accumulating evidences show that oxidative stress is one of the important pathways leading to neuronal cell death in PD. Although the source of increased oxidative stress is not completely known, environmental factor, excitotoxin, dopamine homeostasis and others have gained more attention [4]. Oxidative stress may induce mitochondrial dysfunction, genetic mutation and protein aggregation, and ultimately cause cell death [5]. Oxidative damage mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) which can be generated following cell lysis, oxidative burst, or the presence of an excess of free transition metals, can attack protein, deoxyneuclic acid, and lipid membranes, thereby disrupting cellular function and integrity [6, 7]. Among a great variety of ROS, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is known to play a pivotal role because it is generated from all sources of oxidative stress and can diffuse freely in and out of cells and tissues [8]. In the brain several antioxidant molecules such as ascorbate, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase can remove ROS and protect against oxidative stress. Therefore, therapeutic strategies aimed at preventing or delaying ROS induced apoptosis might be reasonable choice for treatment of neurological diseases.",

Tripterygium regelii (T. regelii) Sprague et Takeda is one of the most common traditional medicinal herb, native to Korea and Japan. The herb T. regelii has been used in traditional Korean medicine for centuries [9] and has been reported to have various pharmacological properties including anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory effects [10\u201312]. Diterpene-quinonones and triterpenoids were reported from T. regelii and have been shown that triptoquinone A and B inhibited growth of P-3888 leukemia cells in vitro [13, 14]. Over 300 compounds have been identified in the genus Tripterygium and many of them have been evaluated for biological activity [15]. Tripterygium\nwillfordii Hook.F. is among the most studied plant of the genus Tripterygium. Nevertheless, no information is available regarding the effect of T. regelii extract against the pathogenesis of PD. Therefore, this study was designed to explore the antioxidant activity of T. regelii extract and evaluate its neuroprotective effects against H2O2-induced DArgic neuronal damage.",

The nuclear morphology of cells exposed to TRE alone was intact and similar to that of untreated control cells (Fig. 3c). However, H2O2-treated cells (Fig. 3b) exhibited highly condensed and fragmented nuclei morphologies, characteristics of apoptosis. In contrast, TRE pre-treatment inhibited these apoptotic features (Fig. 3d).

Many studies have shown that the oxidative stress is an important mediator of cellular damage in various neurological disorders including PD. Oxidative stress induces ROS such as H2O2 and superoxide anion which results in mitochondrial dysfunction, protein misfolding, genetic mutation and finally cell death [31]. Suppression of ROS by antioxidants might be an effective strategy in inhibiting oxidative stress-induced cell death. Therefore, the use of anti-oxidant agents as a way of neuroprotection could be a potential therapy to slow or ameliorate the progression of neurodegenerative diseases [32]. In this study, we found that TRE exhibited potent DPPH radical scavenging activity, H2O2 scavenging activity and strong reducing power.

Several studies have shown that celastrol, a quinone methide triterpenoid isolated from T. regelii, possesses various biological properties including chemopreventive, antioxidant, neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory actions [33, 37, 38]. Recently, Kim et al. [38] showed that celastrol effectively suppresses the inflammatory responses accompanying the direct inhibition of nitric oxide, prostaglandin E2, cyclooxygenase-2 and inflammatory cytokines in murine macrophages. Moreover, it has been reported that some quinone-methide triterpenes such as celastrol, pristimerin, tingenone, and iguesterin including celastrol isolated from T. regelii exhibited inhibitory effects for SARS-CoV 3CLpro (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS- CoV) [39]. Natural triterpenoid pristimerin was found to induce mitochondrial cell death through ROS-dependent activation of both Bax and PARP-1 in human cervical cancer cells [40]. In addition, regelin and regelinol, new antitumour ursine type triterpenoids have been reported from this plant [10]. Previous studies have shown the anticancer activities of some sesquiterpenes such as triptofordin F-2, triptogelin A-1, and triptogelin C-1 from T. regelii [41]. Furthermore, diterpene quinoids, triptoquinones A-F isolated from T. regelii have been reported to have anti-inflammatory activities [34, 42]. These studies have demonstrated the potential of TRE to reduce inflammation and autoimmune responses. However, its relationship with neurodegenerative disease is unexplored. In this study we found that TRE could modulate PD-related neurotoxins-induced cell death in human DArgic neurons.",

Our results confirmed that treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with H2O2 resulted in a dose dependent viability loss (Fig. 2a). However, pre-treatment with TRE (10 \u03bcg/ml) efficiently prevented the loss of cell viability (Fig. 2b, d), which is further confirmed by morphological observations (Fig. 2c). These results indicated that TRE significantly protected SH-SY5Y cells from H2O2-induced cytotoxicity through the inhibition of both apoptotic and necrotic process. Further, in the present study, we showed a protective effect of TRE against H2O2-induced cell death in human DArgic cells, SH-SY5Y. Apoptosis is the process of cell death characterized by cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation, DNA fragmentation and membrane blabbing. These apoptotic features in situ were detected by DAPI, TUNEL and PI staining (Fig. 3).

            "text": "Apoptosis is mediated through extrinsic pathway by death receptor and intrinsic pathway by mitochondria. Ultimately, these pathways activate caspases, and activated caspases induce cell death. Bcl-2 family consists of two groups; anti-apoptotic group (Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) and pro-apoptotic group (Bak, Bax, Bid), and they play an important role in mitochondrial related apoptosis pathway. Bcl-2, one of anti-apoptotic factor, residing in the outer mitochondrial membrane inhibits Cytochrome c release [47]. The pro-apoptotic factor Bax, resides in the cytosol. Translocation of Bax to the mitochondrial membrane might lead to loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and an increase in mitochondrial permeability. Increased mitochondrial permeability results in the release of Cytochrome c from the mitochondria [48]. Released Cytochrome c triggers activation of caspase-9 which in turn activates caspase-3, and activated Caspase-3 induces cell death. In this study we examined the modulation of the gene expression of Bcl-2 and Bax after treatments with H2O2. Our data reveal that Bax/Bcl-2 protein ratio is increased following a treatment with H2O2, but it decreases with the administration of TRE prior to H2O2. These results suggest that TRE can indeed diminish H2O2-induced apoptotic cell death. Moreover, we demonstrated that TRE prevented depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential induced by H2O2 as detected by Rodamine 123 (Fig. 4). In addition, our present findings show that H2O2 induces an activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9, while TRE can prevent these events, supporting a strong anti-apoptotic potential for TRE.",

Dramatically reduced numbers of TH-positive neurons was observed in brains of primate and rodent models of Parkinson disease and increased activity of TH in parkinson rats resulted in effective DA production and relief of disease symptoms [50]. It has been reported previously that BDNF is the most important neurotrophic factor for the differentiation and survival of midbrain DA neurons [51, 52]. BDNF can protect DA neurons against neurotoxins in vivo and in vitro [53, 54].

The mechanism underlying the protective effects of TRE in H2O2-injured SH-SY5Y cells might be related to the inhibition of apoptotic features such as change in cellular morphology, nuclear condensation and DNA fragmentation, maintenance of MMP stability, increased Bcl-2 activity and decrease of Caspase-3, caspase-9, and Bax activation through mitochondrial-dependent pathway. Moreover, TRE increased the TH and BDNF in SH-SY5Y cells. A probable underlying mechanism of this novel action of TRE may be associated with the presence of flavonoids in the extract, which are a source of antioxidants, since oxidative process are important in the pathogenesis of several disorders including PD. The components with potential antioxidant activity are promising candidates for use as new therapeutic agents against PD. Therefore, TRE may be a highly valuable candidate for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders associated with oxidative stress.",
