In Costa Rica, there have been no rabies outbreaks associated with canine\ncases since 1987. However almost every year there are outbreaks in bovids produced\nby hematophagous bats. In order to establish the relationships of rabies bat viruses\nin Costa Rica outbreaks, a total of thirty bovine and two human brain tissue samples\nbelonging to twenty-one rabies outbreaks were amplified and sequenced. Samples were\nobtained and stored by SENASA from 2004 to 2015. The complete nucleoprotein gene\nsequences were aligned with thirty-five rabies virus sequences downloaded from the\nGenBank/DDBJ/EMBL database using Bioedit software. The phylogenetic analysis was\nperformed using the maximum likelihood method and GTR + G + I model included in Mega\n6. The topology of the tree is discussed.",
