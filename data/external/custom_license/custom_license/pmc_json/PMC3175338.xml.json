While younger infants (birth to 5 months of age) are undergoing exposure to their first viral season and are likely experiencing a primary infection, these older children (6\u201323 months) may be more likely to have had previous exposures to these respiratory viruses in an earlier season.

These associations may offer insight into which virus predominates in a multiple virus illness. Notably, 82% of coinfections consisted of one virus from the group with consistently high viral load (RSV, Flu A, hMPV, or PIV3) combined with an alternate virus (CoV, PIV 1, or AdV). This may suggest a possible model for virus coinfections that include one predominant virus and one virus that is present at a lower quantity and does not confer increased severity. The presence of low\u2010quantity CoV and AdV in a coinfection merits further study, especially given the finding that the prevalences of these two viruses in asymptomatic individuals are second only to rhinovirus.\n16\n, \n23\n, \n24\n\n",

Although viral load generally decreases from illness onset,\n25\n our study was able to compare viral loads at the time of illness symptoms that warranted medical attention.
