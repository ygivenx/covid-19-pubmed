In both photoaging and natural aging, there is a loss of intact collagen and an increase in fragmented collagen in the skin [12, 45, 49]. RA treatment reverses the increased expression of connective tissue-degrading matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) [10, 11] and concomitantly stimulates new collagen synthesis [15, 27, 28, 49]. Given the ability of RA to reduce collagen damage and induce new collagen synthesis, it is not surprising that topical retinoid use not only improves the appearance of damaged skin but also results in better function. Specifically, a number of past studies have demonstrated that RA-pretreatment of skin that has been damaged as a result of aging/photoaging or as a consequence of either diabetes or chronic corticosteroid use improves the healing of superficial wounds that occur subsequent to treatment [1, 33, 42, 55, 57].",

At the histological level, one sees a perivascular accumulation of mononuclear cells, with neutrophils and monocytes scattered throughout the dermis and an occasional foci of neutrophils in the dermis or epidermis [3, 14, 23]. Epidermal thickening along with features of abnormal differentiation are also seen. Irritation is a major cause of non-compliance among retinoid users. In addition, excessive irritation may counteract the beneficial effects of topical retinoid use. While the molecular events that underlie retinoid-irritation have not been completely delineated, the retinoid irritation response is, fundamentally, a form of inflammation.",

A number of hypotheses have been put forward to explain the beneficial effects of calorie restriction. While the mechanisms by which CR might exert its effects have not been fully elucidated, a reduction in pro-inflammatory events seems to be an important component of the overall response to CR diets. Numerous observations specifically linking CR to a reduction in oxidant-mediated, pro-inflammatory processes have been made [7, 34, 37]. Given this background information, the present studies were carried out to assess retinoid irritation in CR mice as compared to their ad libitum (AL)-fed counterparts. Our results indicate that CR dramatically blunts RA-induced skin irritation under conditions in which beneficial effects of retinoid use (i.e., RA-induced epidermal proliferation and dermal collagen production) are largely unaffected.",

One day later, treatment with RA was initiated. Once daily for 14 days, each animal was topically treated over the shaved area with 100 \u03bcl of the retinoid solution. In each experiment, some mice (AL and CR) were kept as non-retinoid-treated controls. These animals received 100 \u03bcl of DMSO alone. Previous studies have demonstrated that treatment of hairless mice with RA in this manner leads to an intense irritation response that can be seen as early as 3\u20134 days after initiation of treatment and is maximal by day 7 or 8. Irritation is associated with increased keratinocyte proliferation and epidermal thickening [51]. The animals were examined for signs of skin irritation each day after RA treatment. Irritation was characterized by redness, dryness (with small cracks developing in the skin), epidermal flaking and failure of hair to grow at the treated site. The animals were carefully evaluated for these features and given an overall \u201cirritation score\u201d of 1+ to 4+. A 1+ score indicated no difference between the RA-treated animals and controls and a score of 4+ indicated maximal irritation. All measurements were made in an unblinded fashion. On day 7 and day 14, cohorts of CR and AL animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation after exposure to CO2. Two biopsies (2 mm full-thickness) from the treated area were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and used for histology. Epidermal thickness (i.e., distance from the dermal\u2212epidermal juncture to the upper level of viable cells was assessed randomly at 4 or 5 sites in each tissue section. Two additional 2 mm full-thickness biopsies were put into organ culture using Keratinocyte Basal Medium (KBM) (Lonza, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with Ca2+ to a final concentration of 1.4 mM as culture medium. Incubation was at 37\u00b0C in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Three days later, the conditioned medium was obtained and used for the various analyses indicated below.",

Consistent with past findings in hairless mice [51], AL mice at all three ages developed an intense skin irritation as a result of the retinoid treatment.

In some places, the inflammation was so intense that the epidermis was almost completely eroded. In these areas, keratinocyte necrosis was evident (Fig. 3e).

Just as observed in AL mice, there were mononuclear cells and granulocytes scattered throughout the dermis and occasional foci within the dermis (Fig. 3f).

Additionally, retinoids have detergent-like properties [35] and influence such fundamental properties as membrane fluidity [48] and cation transport [46, 47]. Through one mechanism or another, topical treatment of skin with RA results in a substantial keratinocyte proliferative response, leading to increased epidermal thickness [21, 23, 26, 29, 50, 54]. Altered differentiation [9, 13, 20] and a reduction in cell\u2013cell cohesion [45] accompany increased proliferation. Our recent studies have shown that several pro-inflammatory cytokines are elaborated in the rapidly proliferating epidermis [52, 53].

Given the similar inflammatory cell infiltrate found in both AL and CR mice and given that there were no apparent differences in elaboration off pro-inflammatory cytokines between the two groups, it seems reasonable to suggest that CR acts somehow to protect the tissue from inflammatory injury rather than by blunting pro-inflammatory events, per se. Consistent with this, previous studies have demonstrated changes in cellular membrane composition resulting (directly or indirectly) from CR [19, 30, 31]. A recent study [19] showed that cells maintained in culture with serum from CR animals had a significant increase in the plasma membrane redox system antioxidants (\u03b1-tocopheral and coenzyme Q10). Since oxidants are a major contributor to cell injury in inflammation [17], increased cellular anti-oxidant levels, especially in cellular membranes, could be expected to provide protection.",

            "text": "Alternatively, CR has been shown to interfere with signaling events that influence AP-1 and NF-\u03baB-mediated gene transcription [24, 25, 41]. Since both of these transcription complexes regulate synthesis of tissue-destructive MMPs, [2, 10, 11], interference with either or both pathways could be expected to reduce MMP levels. there was a decrease in MMP-9 in skin organ culture fluid from CR mice (RA-treated) as compared to AL controls. Although we used MMP-9 as our \u201creadout\u201d in these studies, It should be noted that several other MMPs are also regulated at the transcriptional level in parallel to MMP-9 [10, 11]. While there is no direct evidence that MMPs are primarily responsible for tissue damage in retinoid irritation, these enzymes are important mediators of inflammatory tissue injury in other contexts [6, 8, 44]. The lack of decrease with MMP-2 is consistent with this model, because MMP-2, unlike most other MMPs, is not regulated at the transcriptional level [10]. In contrast to these results, we did not see a decrease in the level of various pro-inflammatory cytokines in the CR mice. KC/IL-8 and MCP-1 were both well-represented in organ culture fluid from both AL and CR mice, but there was no significant difference between the two groups. In contrast, IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 were were barely detectable, but unexpectedly, the levels of these two were actually higher in organ culture fluid from CR mice as compared to AL controls. We have no explanation for this.",

Retinoid patch-testing is a sensitive, reliable and easily quantified way to assess retinoid irritation in human skin [14, 23]. As studies on CR in humans move forward [18, 32, 43], it will be important to have sensitive measures for functional outcomes as well as for metabolic changes that result from dietary modification. One could envision using retinoid irritation as a predictor of responsiveness to treatment on an individual basis. Such a marker could also be useful for assessing how rapidly beneficial effects are observed and how long they persist once CR is stopped. Finally, this could be used to help elucidate mechanisms of CR action in humans.",

At the end of the incubation period, organ culture fluid was collected and assessed for soluble type I collagen by Western blotting followed by digitization of the collagen band. Values shown (normalized to 1.0 in the AL group) are means and standard errors, based on organ cultures from 8 AL mice and 6 CR mice. Lower panel: MMPs. The same organ culture fluids were assessed for MMP-2 and MMP-9 by gelatin zymography followed by digitization of the latant and active enzyme forms. Values shown (normalized to 1.0 in the AL group) are means and standard deviations, based on organ cultures from 8 AL mice and 6 CR mice (duplicate organ cultures per mouse). Statistical significance of the difference between paired groups was determined using the student t-test. *P < 0.05 relative to AL control skin",
