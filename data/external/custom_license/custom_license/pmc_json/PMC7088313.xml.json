            "text": "Lectins, or carbohydrate-binding proteins, are present in various organisms from viruses to mammals and serve as recognition molecules between cells, cell and matrix, and organisms. Owing to the capability of discriminating carbohydrate structures, not only are lectins used as valuable biochemical reagents in many research fields, including glycomics, but they are promising candidates for medicinal and clinical application (Sharon and Lis 2003). Indeed, antiviral activities have been reported for several lectins (Botos and Wlodawer 2005). Antihuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and/or anti-influenza virus lectins from bacteria, algae, fungi, and land plants have the common property of binding to high-mannose N-glycans, thereby blocking the entry of viruses into host cells through binding to the mannoside structures in the viral envelope glycoproteins, which are critical for the primary infection of viruses (Balzarini 2006). The anti-HIV lectins from cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) and eukaryotic macroalgae are presently marked as a new antiviral agent because their HIV-inhibiting activities are extremely strong compared to those of lectins from other biological groups (Zi\u00f3lkowska and Wlodawer 2006; Balzarini 2007). Practically, a potent anti-HIV lectin, griffithsin, from the red alga Griffithsia sp., has been investigated in detail with this objective (Mori et al. 2005), as well as some anti-HIV cyanobacterial lectins (Zi\u00f3lkowska and Wlodawer 2006; Sato et al. 2007). Recently, the high-mannose N-glycan-specific lectins from the red alga Kappaphycus alvarezii (KAA-2) (Sato et al. 2011a) and the green alga Boodlea coacta (BCA) (Sato et al. 2011b) showed strong anti-HIV and anti-influenza virus activities in a similar manner. Although these anti-HIV lectins share both binding specificity for high-mannose N-glycans and repeated domain structures, they differ from each another in amino acid sequences and recognizing branched mannoside structures, which may lead to subtle differences in the degree of inhibiting activities. Some of high-mannose binding lectins also inhibit the infection of other enveloped viruses such as Ebola virus (Barrientos et al. 2003), hepatitis C virus (HCV) (Helle et al. 2006), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (O\u2019Keefe et al. 2010). Thus, high-mannose binding lectins may become a useful interesting target for application. Furthermore, antibacterial activities have been reported for lectins from various biological sources (Slifkin and Doyle 1990). However, little is known about the effects of marine algal lectins towards marine vibrios, except the species-specific activities against vibrios have been reported for the lectins from the red algae, Eucheuma serra and Galaxaura marginata (Liao et al. 2003). Marine vibrios are halophilic Gram-negative proteobacteria, which occupy a diverse range of ecological niches including sediments, water column, and in association with organisms either as symbionts or pathogens (Tracy et al. 2007). They cause an economically important disease of fish, marine invertebrates, and are responsible for high mortality rates in aquaculture worldwide (Marhual et al. 2010). Among the vibrios, Vibrio alginolyticus and V. parahaemolyticus are quite important, since they cause serious episodes in marine fish and shellfish including shrimp (Zorrilla et al. 2003; Marhual et al. 2010). In Vietnam, V. alginolyticus, V. parahaemolyticus, and V. harveyi have greatly reduced yields of farmed shrimps (FAO 2013).",

Those algal species have been introduced in more than 20 countries for mariculture purposes (Ask and Azanza 2002). In Vietnam, E. denticulatum has been cultivated since 2005 from algal seeds that were transported from Bohol, Philippines. Although the high-mannose N-glycan-specific lectins from carrageenophytes have been reported, including ESA-2 from Eucheuma serra (Hori et al. 2007), KAA-2 from K. alvarezii (Sato et al. 2011a), and KSA-2 from K. striatum (Hung et al. 2011), little is known about lectin from E. denticulatum, which can provide valuable information regarding lectins from this cultivated carrageenophytes, whose biological roles still remain elusive to a large extent. In a screening of hemagglutinins in Vietnamese marine algae, strong hemagglutination activity was detected in the extract of cultivated E. denticulatum (Hung et al. 2009a). The objective of this research was to evaluate the primary structure, the carbohydrate-binding specificity, and the biological properties including the antibacterial activities against the shrimp pathogenic vibrios of the lectin from cultivated E. denticulatum for future applications.",

Briefly, a fresh sample (1 kg) of cultivated E. denticulatum was homogenized with equal volume (v/w) of 40 % aqueous EtOH (v/v) and kept at 4 \u00b0C for 18 h with occasional stirring. After filtration through a cheese cloth, the filtrate was centrifuged at 3500 \u00d7 g for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C. The supernatant was collected and examined for hemagglutination activity. To the supernatant, cold absolute EtOH (\u221220 \u00b0C) was added to attain a final concentration of about 80 % as measured by an alcoholmeter and the mixture was kept at 4 \u00b0C overnight. The resulting precipitates were collected by centrifugation at 3500 \u00d7 g for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C and thoroughly dialyzed against 50-mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.15-M NaCl. The non-dialyzable fraction was applied to a Superdex R 75 HR column (10 \u00d7 300 mm) equilibrated with the above buffer. The column was eluted with the same buffer at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min\u22121. Active fractions were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration, and dialyzed against 20-mM Tris\u2013HCl buffer (pH 8.0). The concentrate was subjected to ion-exchange chromatography on a TSKgel DEAE-5PW column (7.5 \u00d7 75 mm) equilibrated with 20-mM Tris\u2013HCl buffer (pH 8.0). This elution was performed at a flow rate of 0.4 mL min\u22121, first with the same buffer for 3 min, then with a linear gradient between 0 and 0.16-M NaCl in the buffer for 22 min, and finally with 1-M NaCl in the buffer for 10 min. The eluate was monitored for absorbance at 280 nm and for hemagglutination activity with trypsin-treated rabbit erythrocytes. Active fractions were pooled and dialyzed against distilled H2O.",

Briefly, the samples for SDS-PAGE were denatured at 100 \u00b0C for 5 min with or without 2 % 2-mercaptoethanol and then electrophored using a 10 % gel (Laemmli 1970). After electrophoresis, the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Prior to determination of molecular mass by ESI-MS using a LCQ (Finnigan, USA), intact lectin was further purified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a YMC PROTEIN-RP column (6.0 \u00d7 250 mm) which had been equilibrated with 20 % acetonitrile in 0.1 % trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). After injection of the lectin sample, the column was washed with the starting solvent and then eluted with a linear gradient of acetonitrile from 20 to 70 % in 0.1 % TFA. The eluate was monitored for absorbance at 280 nm. The peak containing lectin was recovered and dried by a Speed Vac SC100 concentrator (Sarvant, USA). The purified sample was dissolved in 50 % acetonitrile in 0.1 % TFA and subjected to mass spectrometry. The parameters of ion source were as follows: Sheath(N2) gas, 70; aus (He) gas, 10; spray voltage, 4.5; capillary temperature, 220 \u00b0C; capillary voltage, 3 kV; tube lens offset, 10. Calibration was performed using ESA-2, a lectin protein that had been analyzed before in the same assay system (Hori et al. 2007) and stocked in the laboratory. LCQ Bioworks (Finnigan, USA) was used to analyze and deconvolute the raw mass spectrum. For detection of glycoproteins, the electrophored gel was blotted to a PVDF membrane and the membrane was subjected to staining for carbohydrate using a GP SENSOR kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.",

An active peak fraction obtained by gel filtration, which included three isolectins from E. denticulatum, was used as a lectin solution (EDAs). The bacteria were grown in a sterilized seawater medium containing nutrient broth and yeast malt broth and incubated overnight in a shaker 37 \u00b0C. The cell concentration of bacteria was determined by measuring the suspension turbidity at 600 nm and converted to colony forming units (105\u2013106 CFU mL\u22121) using a calibration curve. Serial twofold dilutions (100 \u03bcL each) of an original solution of EDAs (1942 \u03bcg mL\u22121) were prepared in PBS in test tubes. To each dilution, a 50 \u03bcL of bacteria suspension (OD600 = 0.47) in a medium was added, and the mixtures were gently shaken and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 24 h. As a positive reference, 50 \u03bcL of ampicillin solution (1000 \u03bcg mL\u22121) in a medium was examined in the same way. As a negative control without both lectins and ampicillin, 50 \u03bcL of the bacterial suspension (OD600 = 0.47) was added to 100 \u03bcL of PBS and incubated in the similar way. After incubation, the turbidity of reaction solutions was measured at 600 nm as the index of bacterial growth. The bacterial growth in the presence of EDAs and ampicillin was compared to that in a control. The inhibition activities of EDAs at various concentrations were determined as the ratio (%) to that of ampicillin (1000 \u03bcg mL\u22121) and expressed as an efficient concentration (EC50) relative to the inhibition activity of ampicillin at 1000 \u03bcg mL\u22121.",

The primary structure of EDA-2 has four tandemly repeated domains, each consisting of 67 amino acids and sharing 47 % sequence identity (Fig. 5). The homologous sequences were found in database search, including lectins from cyanobacteria Oscillatoria agardhii (OAA) (132 aa) (P84330), proteobacteria, Burkholderia oklahomensis EO147 (BOA) (276 aa) (ZP_02360833), Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf0-1 (PFL) (133 aa) (YP_346241), and Myxococcus xanthus (MBHA) (267 aa) (M13831), and from marine red alga Eucheuma serra (ESA-2) (268 aa) (P84331). All of them contain four tandemly repeated homologous domains of about 67 amino acids, except OAA and PFL, which are composed of only two tandemly repeated homologous domains. The identity of ESA-2, MBHA, and BOA with EDA-2 in amino acid sequences were 95.2, 59.0, and 57.1 %, respectively, whereas OAA and PFL showed a considerable sequence identity, 61.4 and 63.6 %, to the N-terminal half of EDA-2, respectively (Fig. 6).\n\n\n",

The binding activity of EDA-2 was more than 90 % with the PA-oligosaccharides, 4, 6, 8, and 11, all of which have an exposed (\u03b11-3) Man residue at non-reducing terminus in the D2 arm, while the activity significantly decreased with PA-oligosaccharides, 5, 7, 9, 10, and 12 (less than 50 %), where the (\u03b11-3) Man residue in the D2 arm was masked by the addition of a non-reducing terminal (\u03b11-2) Man residue. The addition of (\u03b11-2) Man at the terminus of D1 or D3 arm had little effect, as the binding activity was unchangeable with the PA-oligosaccharides 6, 8, or 11.

            "text": "The binding activity of EDA-2 differed among high-mannose N-glycans examined, being attributed to subtle differences in the structures of branched oligomannosides (Fig. 8, Table 4). The binding activity of EDA-2 was considerably decreased when (\u03b11-2)-linked Man is attached at the terminus of D2 arm (5, 7, 9, 10, and 12), whereas it was not affected but rather enhanced by the presence of (\u03b11-2)-linked Man at the terminus of D1 or D3 arm (4, 6, 8, and 11). In other words, the attachment of Man (\u03b11-2) at the non-reducing terminus of D2 arm blocked the carbohydrate interaction of EDA-2. This suggests that a C2-OH of the Man (\u03b11-3) residue in the D2 arm may interact directly with the EDA-2 molecule. The Man (\u03b11-3) in the D2 arm may be the primary target for EDA-2 binding because EDA-2 did not interact to the oligosaccharide 14 (0 %) lacking the Man (\u03b11-3) in the D2 arm, whereas it bound to the oligosaccharide 13 (37.1 %) containing this residue, indicating that EDA-2 recognized preferentially the exposed (\u03b11-3) Man in the D2 arm. The similar binding specificity has also been reported for high-mannose binding lectins from the algae such as ESA-2 (Hori et al. 2007), KSA-2 (Hung et al. 2011) and OAA (Sato et al. 2007). On the other hand, the addition of one (\u03b11-2) Man residue to Man(\u03b11-3)Man\u03b21-unit in the D1 arm notably enhanced the binding activity (binding activity of EDA-2 with PA-oligosaccharides 4 compared to that with 3), indicating that the (\u03b11-2) Man residue attached at Man(\u03b11-3)Man\u03b21-unit in the D1 arm serves as another target for enhancing the binding affinity of EDA-2 to oligomannosides. The similar cases have also been reported for the algal lectin ESA-2 (Hori et al. 2007), KSA-2 (Hung et al. 2011), while the binding activity of OAA was not affected by the (\u03b11-2) Man residue(s) in the D1 arm (Sato et al. 2007). In contrast, a leaf lectin CRLL from the land plant Cycas revoluta, which belongs to the Jacalin-like superfamily, loses the binding to high-mannose glycans in which a (\u03b11-2) Man residue was attached at Man(\u03b11-3)Man\u03b21-unit in the D1 arm, indicating that the addition of (\u03b11-2) Man to the core Man(\u03b11-3)Man\u03b2 had rather a destructive effect on CRLL recognition (Nakamura et al. 2005).",

(Moulaei et al. 2010), BCA from the green alga B. coacta (Sato et al. 2011b), cyanovirin-N from the cyanobacterium Nostoc ellipsosporum (Boyd et al. 1997), MVL from the cyanobacterium M. viridis (Williams et al. 2005), SVN from the cyanobacterium Scytonema varium (Bokesch et al. 2003), ASAs from the garlic A. sativum (Dam et al. 1998; Bachyhawat et al. 2001), and HRL from the mushroom Hygrophorus russula (Suzuki et al. 2012). The high-mannose binding affinities of EDA-2, ESA-2, KSA-2, KAA-2, and OAA were impaired by the addition of the terminal (\u03b11-2) Man in D2 arm, while griffithsin, BCA, cyanovirin-N, SVN, and ASAs preferentially recognized the non-reducing terminal (\u03b11-2) Man of the mannosides such as Man8GlcNAc2 and Man9GlcNAc2 (Moulaei et al. 2010; Sato et al. 2011b; Botos et al. 2002; Bokesch et al. 2003; Dam et al. 1998). MVL recognized the core tetra- and pentasaccharides of high-mannose N-glycans (Williams et al. 2005), and HRL showed the highest affinity for N-glycan core structure, Man(\u03b11-6)[Man(\u03b11-3)]Man(\u03b21-4)GlcNAc(\u03b21-4)GlcNAc, but had much lower affinity for Man8GlcNAc2 and Man9GlcNAc2 (Suzuki et al. 2012). Thus, there seems to be subtle difference in the recognition modes among high-mannose N-glycan-binding lectins.",

The growth inhibition of V. alginolyticus with EDAs was not observed in the presence of yeast mannan bearing high-mannose N-glycans, indicating that V. alginolyticus have mannoside or mannoside-like structure(s) on the cell surface, which might respond as a receptor(s) for EDAs, while V. parahaemolyticus and V. harveyi do not have such structure on their cell surfaces. The species-specific antibacterial activities have been reported for the lectins from the red algae, E. serra and Galaxaura marginata, in which both lectins displayed antibacterial activity toward the fish pathogen V. vulnificus, but not toward V. neresis and V. pelagius (Liao et al. 2003). Although antibacterial activities have been reported for lectins from various biological sources (Santi-Gadelha et al. 2006; Charungchitrak et al. 2011; Riera et al. 2003), there seems to be not reported for the growth-inhibiting activity against shrimp and fish pathogens, except the high-mannose N-glycan specific lectins from carrageenophytes mentioned above. These algal lectins may be useful to not only clarify the infection mechanism of their marine pathogens but also protect fishes and shellfishes from the infection.",

            "text": "In this study, we have determined the primary structure of EDA-2 (Fig. 4) and confirmed that it strongly resembles that of ESA-2 (Hori et al. 2007) and MBHA (Romeo et al. 1986; Koharudin et al. 2012) (Fig. 6), including its molecular size and the presence of four tandemly repeated motifs. Clusters of identical amino acids of EDA-2 were located on both N- and C-terminal regions of each repeated domain, portions of which also correspond to the conserved regions among the four repeated domains of the lectin. Recently, genes coding the lectins belonging to the same lectin family including OAA and ESA-2 have been discovered in several other prokaryotic microorganisms, including cyanobacteria, proteobacteria, chlorobacteria, and in an eukaryotic marine red alga (Sato and Hori 2009; Koharudin et al. 2012). Similar to members of this lectin family, EDA-2 shared a considerable structure similarity and high-mannose N-glycan binding specificity with ESA-2 (Hori et al. 2007), BOA (Whitley et al. 2013), OAA (Sato et al. 2007; Sato and Hori 2009), MBHA (Romeo et al. 1986; Koharudin et al. 2012) and PFL (Sato et al. 2012). The lectins in this family are commonly monomeric proteins composed of either two or four tandem repeats of homologous domains, depending on different family members (Sato and Hori 2009; Koharudin et al. 2012). From a comparison of the sequences, it is also speculated that the highly conserved segments in both the N-terminal and C-terminal regions may be involved in the carbohydrate binding (Fig. 6). Although the high-mannose N-glycan recognition profile of EDA-2 was slightly differed from those of the high-mannose binding cyanobacterial lectins such as CV-N (Botos et al. 2002), MVL (Williams et al. 2005) and SVN (Bokesch et al. 2003), EDA-2 has no sequence similarity with these cyanobacterial lectins, except for OAA (Sato et al. 2007). The strict specificity for high-mannose oligosaccharides with very high binding affinities seems to be a common feature among the lectins from lower organisms such as cyanobacteria and algae.",

EDAs also inhibited the growth of a marine pathogenic bacterium, V. alginolyticus in dose-dependent manner. The oligosaccharide-binding properties and the primary structure of EDA-2 well resemble those of the antiviral lectins which belong to the high-mannose N-glycan specific lectin family in lower organisms (Sato et al. 2007, 2011a), suggesting that EDA-2 is also predicted to have antiviral and other applicable activities. This study indicates that E. denticulatum might become a candidate for a functional food that can prevent virus infection in the future. Clarifying the structural basis of the recognition mode of the carrageenophyte lectins, including E. denticulatum lectins, should contribute to demonstrate the biological function(s) as well as application of this lectin group.",
