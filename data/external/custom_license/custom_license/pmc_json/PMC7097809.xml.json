Physicians are rightly concerned that the existing therapeutic armamentarium and nephrological services will be unable to cope with the burden of diabetic renal disease that is projected to develop. Urgent emphasis is now being placed on early detection and prevention of diabetic nephropathy, and chronic kidney disease in general. Initiatives such as World Kidney Day\u2014inaugurated in March 2006\u2014aim to raise awareness of the scale of the problem.",

The relative affluence of these countries grants their citizens access to lifestyle choices that, despite being perceived as making life 'easier', are actually detrimental to health and wellbeing. Fast food, efficient forms of transport and mechanization of tasks that previously required expenditure of physical energy have contributed to an epidemic of obesity and the metabolic syndrome, which in turn drive development of type 2 diabetes, diabetic nephropathy and end-stage renal disease.",

First, increasing rates of international travel and immigration are resulting in physicians encountering clinical entities with which they are unfamiliar. Editors at Nature Clinical Practice Nephrology work hard to commission articles that provide insight into such cases. In this issue, the Review on viral nephropathy by Kar Neng Lai and Andrew Lai includes sections on pathogens such as the coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome. Upcoming articles will examine the role of plant and animal toxins in acute renal failure.",

Renal Sister Centers, the Fellowship Program (see the Editorial in the February issue of the journal) and World Kidney Day (in conjunction with the International Federation of Kidney Foundations) are just a few examples.",
