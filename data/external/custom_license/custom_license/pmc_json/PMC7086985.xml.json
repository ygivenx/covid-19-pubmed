            "text": "Avian influenza (AI) is caused by viruses that are classified as members of the family Orthomyxoviridae, genus Influenzavirus A [31]. Influenza A viruses have two major surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). At present, 16 hemagglutinin (H1\u2013H16) and nine neuraminidase subtypes (N1\u2013N9) of the virus have been recognized [11]. Avian influenza viruses are classified as highly pathogenic (HP) and non-highly pathogenic (non-HP) or mildly pathogenic (MP) [9]. Based on experimental inoculation of chickens and the sequence of amino acids at the cleavage site of the HA molecule, only a small percentage of H5 and H7 AI viruses have been HP. By contrast, all AI viruses of the other HA subtypes are non-HP (i.e., MP) for birds [1, 22, 32]. The HA plays a key role in the pathogenicity of avian influenza virus [6, 17]. HAs of HP AI viruses are cleaved by cellular proteases, such as ubiquitous furin and PC6. In contrast, the HAs of non-HP AI viruses are cleaved only by trypsin-like proteases, which are secreted from cells in restricted tissues, such as the respiratory and intestinal tracts [17, 31]. Cleavage of HA into HA1 and HA2 is required for the entry of the virus to the host cell plasma via fusion of the viral envelope with the endosomal membrane after receptor-mediated endocytosis [18]. Cleavage of the HA allows exposure of the amino terminal fusion peptide of the HA 2 subunit.",

Mortality rates in some broiler farms in Iran are up to 65% [25]. However, the isolate was characterized as Non-highly pathogenic in the laboratory [34]. Mixed infections of influenza virus with other respiratory pathogens have been found to be responsible for such a high mortality, resulting in great economic losses [3, 5, 10, 15]. Since infectious bronchitis is one of the most prevalent respiratory viral infections in broiler chicken farms in Iran, infectious bronchitis live vaccine (IBLV) is used extensively in chicken farms in Iran. In the present study, experimental co-infection of IBLV with H9N2 virus in chickens and chicken embryos was carried out.",

However, the causative virus has been characterized as mildly pathogenic [34]. So far, there has not been any clear explanation for such a discrepancy in mortality and severity of clinical manifestation between field and experimental induction of the disease in a controlled environment. One of the possible explanations for such a high mortality could be that it is due to mixed infection of the virus (H9N2) with other respiratory pathogens.",

Postmortem lesions such as tracheal congestion, lung hyperemia and exudation of the trachea with tubular cast formation in the tracheal bifurcation, which have been reported previously [26], were observed in necropsy examination. Cast formation in the tracheal bifurcation abruptly reduced airflow, resulting in asphyxiation. It is well known that trypsin-like proteases are necessary for the cleavage activation of the HA and thus play a key role in viral pathogenicity [6, 17]. IBLV co-infection may have provided the enzymes and enhanced H9N2 pathogenicity in this experiment. It has been reported that a trypsin-like serine protease domain is encoded by coronavirus IBV [20, 24]. The presence of similar enzymes in the field situation could possibly increase the pathogenicity of H9N2 AIV. There is general agreement that clinical signs and disease effects of AI may be far more devastating in the presence of bacterial pathogens, environmental conditions and other stresses [2, 4, 5, 8, 16, 21, 29]. For explanation of this phenomenon, other researchers have proposed various hypotheses. These hypotheses are: secretion of trypsin-like proteases by bacteria [33], stimulation of host cells to produce or secrete more protease, destruction of endogenous cell protease inhibitors [21] and suppression of the immune system due to stress by bacterial infection [16]. Our findings, including faster AIV propagation and gross lesions in the embryos inoculated with AIV + IBLV, may be due to an increase of protease activity. The extended viral shedding period in the group of AIV + IBLV-inoculated birds may affect clinical signs, postmortem examination and embryo studies.",
