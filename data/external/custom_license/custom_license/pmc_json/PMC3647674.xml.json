Fecal pellets were collected and suspended in RNAlater Stabilization Reagent (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). RNA was purified as described (11).

Juvenile bats and lactating females were significantly more likely to be CoV-infected than were adult and nonlactating female bats, respectively (Table 2). Virus concentrations in feces from Nycteris bats were high (median 412,951 RNA copies/g range 323\u2013150,000,000 copies/g).",

The Nycteris bat virus in Africa extends this bat CoV clade over 2 different host families, Nycteridae and Vespertilionidae (Technical Appendix Figure).

This suspicion is supported by observations that tentative bat CoV species (RGUs) are commonly detected within 1 host genus (5). Within the Arabian Peninsula, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (www.iucn.org) lists 50 bat species, including P. arabicus, P. ariel, P. kuhlii, P. pipistrellus, P. rueppellii, and P. savii bats.

Whether cross-order (e.g., chiropteran, carnivore, primate) host switches, such as suspected for SARS-CoV, have occurred for 2c clade bat CoVs remains unknown. However, we showed previously that CoVs are massively amplified in bat maternity colonies in temperate climates (13). This amplification also might apply to the Nycteris bat CoV because, as shown previously for vespertilionid bats from temperate climates (14), detection rates of CoV are significantly higher among juvenile and lactating Nycteris bats. In light of the observed high virus concentrations, the use of water from bat caves and bat guano as fertilizer for farming and the hunting of bats as wild game throughout Africa (15) may facilitate host switching events. To our knowledge, no CoV has been isolated directly from bats. Further studies should still include isolation attempts to obtain full virus genomes and to identify virulence factors that may contribute to the high pathogenicity of EMC/2012 (7).",

AY291315). Data were analyzed with MrBayes version 3.1 (http://mrbayes.sourceforge.net/) by using a WAG amino acid substitution model and 4 million generations sampled every 100 steps. Trees were annotated by using a burn-in of 10,000 and visualized with FigTree version 1.6.1 from the BEAST package (www.beast.bio.ed.ac.uk). A whale gammacoronavirus was used as an outgroup. The novel Nycteris bat viruses are shown in boldface and red, the novel Pipistrellus bat viruses and other bat CoVs in the 2c clade are shown in boldface and cyan, and the novel human betacoronavirus EMC/2012 is shown in boldface. Values at deep nodes represent statistical support of grouping by posterior probabilities. CoV clades are depicted to the right of taxa. B) Phylogeny of the complete Spike gene of clade 2c CoVs determined by using the neighbor-joining method with an amino acid percentage distance substitution model and the complete deletion option in MEGA5 (www.megasoftware.net). The Nycteris CoV Spike gene was equidistant from other 2c-CoV Spike genes with 45.6%\u201346.8% aa divergence. Human coronavirus (hCoV)\u2013OC43 was used as an outgroup. No complete Spike gene sequence was available for VM314 or the novel Pipistrellus bat CoVs. Scale bar represents percentage amino acid distance. The analysis comprised 1,731 aa residues. C) Phylogeny of the partial Spike gene of clade 2c CoVs, including the novel CoVs of Pipistrellus bats from Europe, determined by using a nucleotide distance substitution model and the complete deletion option in MEGA5. Scale bar represents percentage nucleotide distance. The analysis comprised 131 nt corresponding to positions 25378\u201325517 in hCoV-EMC/2012. Oligonucleotide sequences of primers used to amplify full and partial Spike gene sequences are available on request from the authors. Values at deep nodes in B and C represent statistical support of grouping by percentage of 1,000 bootstrap replicates.
