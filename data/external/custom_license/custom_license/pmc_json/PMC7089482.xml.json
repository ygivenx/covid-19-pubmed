            "text": "Healthcare is a very substantial issue to be managed effectively for any nation\u2019s development. One of the most vital challenges for any government healthcare agency is to protect its citizens from disease outbreak which can spread from one citizen to another through air or other common mediums [1]. Viruses affect humans in large numbers as these are microorganisms that can propagate very easily. Corona virus is one of the common viruses which can cause multiple diseases in humans as well as animals. In 2015, its outbreak in South Korea has caused more than ten deaths, and thousands of citizens got infected [2]. MERS-CoV infected person is having primary symptoms such as respiratory diseases with fever, cough, shortness of breath (SoB), and diarrhea. Some of the secondary symptoms of MERS-CoV infection are acute renal failure, multiorgan failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and consumptive coagulopathy [3]. The MERS-CoV source is not yet confirmed; however, many studies suggested that this is an animal virus. Reports have confirmed the transmission of the virus from human to human, but proper intermediate hosts for its transmission are still unknown which further increases its risk [4]. MERS-CoV is a novel corona virus that was first identified in the residents of Middle East countries in late 2012 with a death rate of more than fifty percent in infected citizens. As the studies suggested, MERS-CoV spreads using common mode of contacts from one individual to another [3]. MERS-CoV is declared as a public health threat; therefore, the government\u2019s healthcare agencies are committed to provide affordable medical facilities and suggestions to the infected citizens. One of the most important steps to cure MERS-CoV is to stop its infection rate and transmission process by early identification of infected patients as well as providing precautionary measures to uninfected citizens. Identified infected patients should be quarantined as early as possible so that they do not contribute further in the infection spreading. The healthcare sector and the government agencies are adopting cloud computing with data mining approaches to control different infectious diseases [5]. Cloud computing can offer benefits such as improvement in quality of medical services, increased risk responsiveness, collaborating mobile apps, large storage space, and reduced capital investment.",

            "text": "Cloud computing is an emerging technology which provides information technology (IT) resources over the Internet. It is different from traditional IT hosting services because it delivers IT resources on demand without the need of any capital investment with pay-as-use pricing model [6]. With the increase in the use of digital patient\u2019s records in hospitals, large amount of data related to patients, doctors, medication, and the staff are generated. To store, analyze, and effectively represent the outcomes of data mining on this rapidly generated data with minimal time, hospitals need bigger IT infrastructure. Hence, IT expenditure in hospitals is continuously increasing day by day for installation and maintenance of hospital management systems. As anticipated, in the near future, the traditional IT infrastructure setup will not be sufficient to provide necessary quality of service (QoS) parameters. Growth of healthcare systems using cloud computing is emerging as an effective solution with the benefits of more dependable Qos, reduced costs and flexibility [7]. Infectious diseases like MERS and H1N1 happen rarely, so IT infrastructure used to prevent outbreaks of these infectious diseases should be adaptive and scalable in nature. Cloud computing is more suitable for such a varying demand system because it provides virtually unlimited resources on demand with a pay-as-use pricing model [8]. Infection outbreak preventing systems should be highly responsive and provide the desired service with high accuracy. Requirement of cloud service provider to provide agreed QoS facilities high system agility and generates appropriate compensation if requirements are not met [9]. The characteristics defined above act as a motivation to use cloud computing in healthcare infectious disease management system. Some of the significant health service benefits of shifting to cloud computing are listed in Table 1.\n",

Hence, the primary aims of the proposed system areTo provide an initial diagnosis to all users depending on their respective symptoms.To distinguish population at risk using geographic positioning system (GPS).To secure the personal information of MERS-CoV-infected citizens to prevent mass panic paranoid.To achieve these objectives, a mobile cloud system is proposed which stores personal as well as MERS-CoV\u2019s symptom-related information over the cloud. Initially stored information is processed using information granulation so that private data of users can be truncated and a unique case number is provided to each registered user. Using information granulation, the proposed system can achieve confidentiality of personal information related to patients. For all the future communications between users, physicians, and the government agencies, the unique case number provided by information granulation is used. Bayesian belief network (BBN) is used for initial diagnosis of users which will classify users as possibly infected or uninfected. All possibly infected users will be tracked by GPS from their respective mobile phones. Regions on the map are classified into different categories depending on the level of infection activity in that region. Google map assisted risk assessment, and re-routing is provided to citizens using this activity map. Using mobile application designed in the proposed system, most of the users can check their MERS-CoV-infection status by submitting symptoms for the sake of curiosity or peer effect. It will assist the government to scan population of infected users very efficiently and efficaciously. All communications and information are stored over cloud storage which can be easily shared and analyzed using multiple data mining tools.",

            "text": "In 2013, Gautret [10] studied the effect of travel history on the outbreak of MERS-CoV infections in the world. There can be human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV infection, so the risk of infection increases to Hajj pilgrims visiting the Middle East countries. According to him, the first case of MERS-CoV was identified from South Arabia. In 2013, Hon [11] discussed that pilgrims from various countries, who visited South Arabia to perform Hajj were identified as infected with respiratory viruses. Infected pilgrims increased the risk of epidemic not only in their home countries upon their return but also to other countries. To control the epidemic, Hajj pilgrims should be advised proper protective measures, and precautionary actions should be taken when they arrive back home. He suggested that it is necessary to know about travel pattern and health symptoms of Hajj pilgrims to control the epidemic. In 2013, Lu et al. [4] described the challenges in identifying the source, designing MERS vaccines, and developing anti-MERS therapy for MERS-CoV infection. However, they had not provided any proposal for identifying the source and to control the spread of MERS-CoV. In 2013, Omrani et al. [12] carried out research on identifying the transmission mediums used by MERS virus for its propagation such as body contact, air, or water. They found that the intermediate host of transmission of MERS-CoV infection can not be recognized or be symptomatic in most of the cases. To manage this significant problem, they suggested early recognition of MERS-CoV-infected patients and implementation of proper infection control measures. In 2014, Corman et al. [13] presented the effective use of RT-PCR kit for real-time detection of MERS-CoV infections in many patients. In 2014, Al-Tawfiq et al. [14] discussed sources of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-COV) and MERS-CoV with their modes of transmission to humans. They suggested precautionary measures to travelers going to and returning from Middle East countries. All of the further mentioned articles related to MERS are from year 2015. Bhadra et al. [15] developed a real-time isothermal assay test for the detection of MERS virus. Kupferschmidt [16] and Soliman et al. [17] discussed the vaccinations and causes of MERS virus. They also provided first-aid and prevention measures for MERS. Yusof et al. [18] studied the number of camels infected with MERS and their locations in Saudi Arabia Emirate and the United Arab Emirates. Arabi et al. [19] demonstrated the effect of severe neurologic effect of MERS in hospitalized patients. Shalhoub [20] studied the effect of MERS when patients suffer from some chronic diseases. They studied the effect of MERS on a HIV-positive patient for 38 days. Similarly, Alghamdi [21] presented a case study of two MERS-infected users admitted in hospital. Banik et al. [22] argued about the knowledge gap of MERS in doctors and citizens. They also provided its infection rate as well as its difference from other similar viruses. Shehri [23] described the actions taken by health agencies in Saudi Arabia after MERS outbreak. He mentioned benefits and limitations of each action taken by government. Youde [24] listed the relationship between global health governance and MERS outbreak in detailed comparison. No further work has so far been presented for the detection and prevention of MERS-CoV to the best of our knowledge.",

            "text": "Cloud computing in healthcare area is still in its early days. Some of the notable contributions are discussed here. In 2010, Doukas et al. [25] demonstrated that mobile application and cloud computing together can enable better sharing, storing, updating, and retrieval of electronic healthcare data. A prototype has been implemented in the form of an android mobile application. The Amazon S3 cloud service was used for evaluating the developed system. In 2012, Rao and Kumar [26] developed predictive models for diagnosis of the Dengue fever and increased the probability of correct detection. Methodology used by them imputed missing values in the dataset using a novel imputation strategy and then generated a decision tree. Wrapper-based feature selection algorithm was proposed to extract the most important symptoms of dengue. In 2014, Thilakanathan et al. [27] demonstrated security protocol that allowed secure sharing of data in the cloud within the context of mobile health applications. They attempted to address the problems of achieving efficient user revocation especially while considering large data sizes. First, they defined a secure data-sharing model and protocol. Second, they demonstrated the feasibility of the protocol through their own developed prototype which combines smart phone, Bluetooth, and cloud computing technologies. Secure data-sharing architecture was adopted by adding a security layer that enables efficient and secure data sharing. In 2014, Kaur and Chana [28] proposed cloud intelligent system for diabetic patients. They used principal component analysis (PCA) for identifying minimum correlative variables from collected attribute variables. Na\u00efve bayes and k-nearest neighbor classifiers were used to classify infected and uninfected users. In 2014, Ali et al. [29] studied a wireless lightweight, body-worn sensor used in cloud health care for real-time and continuous physiological monitoring. They suggested a data authentication scheme to authenticate data generated by sensors, because they argued that sensors operate in lossy environment. In 2014, Sultan [30] explained the potential of cloud computing for improvement and advancement of life science research. However, they only provided cloud computing advantages in healthcare sector; no new work was proposed.",

Probability of exposure is predicted based on these three exposure attributes using the first stage of BBN classification. Similarly, medical history of any user may depend on multiple attributes such as heart, lungs, and diabetes, so predicting their effects on final MERS-CoV prediction is complex. The first stage of the proposed BBN predicts probability of effect of medical history taking into account all attributes.

The objective of risk assessment is to identify risk-prone areas, population at risk and control the epidemic. MERS-CoV is an airborne disease so up-to-date and relevant information of possibly infected users should be securely available to the government healthcare agencies. Location-based risk assessment and healthcare services will be highly beneficial for airborne diseases such as MERS-CoV. Location of possibly infected users can be effectively used to separate an area into different risk levels. If proper up-to-date information regarding risk-prone areas is available online, then people living in risk-prone areas can be effectively alerted in due time, and infection-control suggestions can be issued to them [19]. Figure 5 shows use of the GPS [34] for pinning hexagonal location of possibly infected users identified by the proposed system. However, pinpointing the exact location of the possibly infected user can cause mass paranoid panic. To effectively represent the spread of infection and risk-prone areas, hexagonal structure-based mapping is applied as indicated in Fig. 6. Total geographic area, possibly infected by MERS-CoV, is converted into non-overlapping hexagonal structures of the same size. Size of hexagonal structure can be changed as decided by the authority. A different color scheme is also proposed to effectively represent the different locations based on the level of infection in population density [36] of MERS-CoV possibly infected users. The chances of MERS-CoV infection are very high at the home and workplace, so these two places are used to define different risk-prone areas on the Google maps [35] web service.\n\n\n",

            "text": "Synthetic data generated are used to train and test the BBN which will be used for classification of users into uninfected or possibly infected users. To develop a Bayesian network, data of 5000 users are used in R Studio using \u201cbnlearn\u201d package. Table 7 shows the results of different learning algorithms. This package is run on Amazon EC2 virtual machine with four virtual CPUs and 2 GB of RAM. As the results show, \u201cgs\u201d and \u201cfast.iamb\u201d suited the proposed system better because of their low execution time and more learned arcs. For further experiments, \u201cfast.iamb\u201d has been used in this paper. Trained BBN is tested in Weka 3.7 [39] for various statistical measures. BBN learned is divided into two separate BBNs which are the first stage and the second stage, as explained in Sect. 3.3. Experimental evaluation is done for three BBNs as follows:The first stage which calculates probability of exposure and medical history.The second stage which calculates MERS-CoV when the first-stage probabilities are statistically provided.Complete BBN which calculates MERS-CoV-infection probability when the first- and the second-stage BBNs work collaboratively.Summary of the models (the first stage, the second stage, and the complete BBN) tested in Weka 3.7 is shown in Table 8 and Table 9. All BBNs classify the users with an accuracy of more than 80 % in all the stages of the proposed BBN. The detailed accuracy of each class parameter as classified by BBN are also listed in Table 9. True-positive (TP) rates\u2014also known as sensitivity and false-positive (FP) rates, also known as specificity\u2014are statistical measure to rate quality of any classification algorithm. TP rate defines the percentage of possibly infected MERS instances which are correctly classified by classification algorithm. FP rate defines the percentage of uninfected MERS instances which classification algorithm classifies as uninfected [40]. A classification algorithm with high TP and FP rate is desirable. The proposed classification algorithm provides a high TP rate that is 0.800, and a high FP rate that is 0.880. Precision and recall provide the relevancy of the classified instances. The higher the value of precision and recall, the better will be the classification because only relevant instances will be classified [40]. The proposed algorithm provides very high precision and recall rate values which are 0.809 and 0.800, respectively. F-Measure is a statistical value for classification accuracy which lies between 0 and 1. Algorithm with a high F-Measure value will be more accurate, and the proposed two-stage BBN provides an F-Measure of 0.826. Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) is a statistical measure used to find quality of any binary classification. As the proposed algorithm is for binary classification, so MCC measure is very important for it. It lies between \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$-$$\\end{document}-1 and \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$+$$\\end{document}+1, and the higher the value, the better is the classification. The proposed algorithm provides high value of MCC which is 0.720. Similar is the case with receiver-operating characteristic (ROC); high value of ROC area represents the accuracy of the proposed algorithm [40]. With the level of accuracy conceived in the above-listed statistical terms, it justifies the use of BBN for the proposed system.\n\n",

            "text": "The proposed system is complex and constituents of multiple components which makes its experimental evaluation even more complex. Thus, experimental evaluation had systematically carried on and is broadly divided into four parts. No availability of data for MERS forced us to create a synthetic data that are generated for 0.2 million users and explained in detail in Sect. 4.1. Then, the training of the proposed two-stage BBN using synthetic data in Sect. 4.1 is done in Sect. 4.2. All the experimental generated statistical measures justified the use of the proposed two-stage BBN, as listed in Tables 7,  8, and  9. Data table fragmentation process divided into three separate data matrices is also experimentally verified in Sect. 4.3. Table 10 provides the snapshot of data table and three data matrices which indicated the successful conversion. In Sect. 4.4, whole classification process is tested for 0.2 million users on Amazon EC2 cloud using multiple classification algorithms. The proposed two-stage BBN performed better in all cases than its fellow competitors. However, NN is also close to BBN in classification accuracy, but its classification time is much larger than the proposed two-stage BBN. Last, the system is tested for re-routing of citizens, which is successfully completed as shown in Fig. 10.",

With the advancements in information technologies, it is possible to control many infections in the most effective and efficient way. In this paper, a system is proposed for predicting and preventing an airborne disease known as MERS-CoV using cloud computing and GPS. Bayesian belief network (BBN) is utilized to classify users, and cloud computing is used for effective information analysis and sharing. The key point of the paper is the use of geographic positioning system to represent each MERS-CoV possibly infected users on Google maps and provide re-routing to uninfected users. Proposed system implemented on Amazon EC2 cloud provides 80 % accuracy in classification and appropriate GPS re-routing. It will help the citizens to avoid regional exposure and the government authorities to manage the problem more effectively. Future study will include the use of the internet of things (IoT)-based smart devices for more accuracy and effectiveness in controlling infectious epidemic.",
