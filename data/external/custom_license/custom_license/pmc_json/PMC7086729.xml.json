Respiratory viruses were detected by a multiplex RT-PCR assay as described previously [6, 14]. In brief, 17 viruses were detected in a five-tube mRT-PCR assay. Tube 1 targeted IFV-A, IFV-B, RSV, HMPV; tube 2, PIV1\u20134; tube 3, EV, HRV and IFV-C; tube 4, CoV-229E, CoV-OC43, CoV-NL63 and CoV-HKU1; and tube 5, ADV and BoV. For each tube, we selected one of the targeted viruses and used the culture supernatant of the standard strain of the selected virus as a positive control for RNA extraction. As a result, RSV, PIV-3, HRV, Co-229E and ADV were selected for tubes 1-5, respectively. The amplification reaction was performed using a QIAGEN OneStep RT-PCR Kit (QIAGEN, Germany). For quality control in the multiple RT-PCR, a mixture of plasmid templates was used as a positive control, and distilled water was used as a negative control. A 25-\u00b5L PCR mix including 5\u00d7 QIAGEN OneStep RT-PCR Buffer, dNTP Mix (final concentration of each dNTP, 400 \u00b5M), primers F and R (final concentration, 0.6 \u00b5M), QIAGEN OneStep RT-PCR Enzyme Mix (1 \u00b5L), RNA template (2.5 \u00b5L), and RNase-free water was prepared. The reaction steps included reverse transcription at 50 \u00b0C for 30 min, initial PCR activation at 95 \u00b0C for 15 min, 40 cycles at 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, 55 \u00b0C (tube 1 and tube 2) or 50 \u00b0C (tube 3, tube 4 and tube 5) for 30 s, and 72 \u00b0C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72 \u00b0C for 10 min. To increases the amplification in tube 3 and tube 4, an additional eight cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, 55 \u00b0C for 30 s, and 72 \u00b0C for 1 min were added after the initial PCR activation. The respiratory viruses were distinguished according to the product sizes in 2 % agarose gel electrophoresis.",

The Nanxiang district of Shanghai has a mean monthly temperature of 17.5 \u00b1 9.2 \u00b0C, humidity of 69.7 \u00b1 6.2 %, and rainfall of 90.8 \u00b1 79.1 mm.

When multiple stepwise regression analysis was performed, mean monthly temperature appeared to be the only factor associated with influenza virus infection. In contrast, the incidence of PIV infection was significantly positively correlated with mean monthly temperature (Spearman\u2019s rho: 0.545, p < 0.001) and mean monthly rainfall (Spearman\u2019s rho: 0.415, p = 0.007).

In China, the positive rates of respiratory viruses in children with ARTIs or influenza-like illness (ILI) range from 37.6 to 78.7 % [5\u201313]. The positive rates appear to be slightly different in different regions, which may be attributed to different years and regional variation, as well as a lack of unified methodology. However, a large-scale surveillance based on 39,756 children with ARTIs in central China showed that the prevalence was only 13.1 %, substantially lower than that found in other studies [16]. Similarly, in this study, we found that the prevalence of respiratory viruses was 24.5 % among 2891 children with ARTIs from August 2011 to December 2014 in Jiading district of Shanghai, significantly lower than those (59.5 % and 78.7 %) obtained from two previous studies based on 817 children with ARTIs during 2006 to 2008 [17] (\u03c72=353.907, p<0.001), and 164 children with ARTIs from May 2009 to July 2010 [20] (\u03c72=227.960, p<0.001) in Shanghai.

In this study, we investigated 2819 children with ARTIs and found that IFV, PIV and RSV were still the most common viruses, together with EV. Compared to the previous study [6], we detected a decreasing prevalence (0.6 %) of HRV. One possible reason was that relatively severe cases (e.g., sudden onset of fever >38, cough or sore throat and difficulty breathing) were enrolled in the previous study [6, 7], which resulted in a higher detection rate. On the other hand, the genotypes of certain respiratory viruses also vary over time. A genotype shift of RSV was observed in Chongqing and Shanghai from 2006 to 2012 [14, 17, 18]. For PIV, the proportions of four genotypes (PIV-1, -2, -3, -4) were consistent with those reported previously [7, 11, 19, 20].",

We found that the prevalence of respiratory viruses decreased with age and that the highest prevalence (29.0 %) occurred in children less than 1 year old, suggesting that children younger than 1 year old are the most susceptible to infection with respiratory viruses. Multiple respiratory viruses were detected in children with ARTIs in Jiading district of Shanghai. IFV, PIV, EV, and RSV were the dominant respiratory viruses, with prevalence of 5.8 %, 5.7 %, 4.3 %, and 3.6 %, respectively. The prevalence of IFV, PIV and EV exhibited distinct seasonal variation. The prevalence of IFV and PIV was significantly negatively and positively correlated with mean monthly temperature, which was the only meteorological factor associated with IFV and PIV infection.",
