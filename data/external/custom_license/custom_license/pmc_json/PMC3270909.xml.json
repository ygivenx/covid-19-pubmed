Mask wearing, overall, is the behavior that people reported being least willing to comply with and it is possible that, for this reason, higher threat perception (concern and likelihood of pandemic) is required to drive compliance with this behavior. Younger people (16\u201324 and 25\u201334) are generally less willing to wear face masks, and only those with university qualifications or equivalent are significantly more likely to be willing to wear face masks. In the event of a pandemic it is likely that the public will be required to wear masks, especially in health care facilities, in public places, and in situations where individuals need to interface with the public, eg, certain critical occupations such as banking, welfare, post/delivery, fuel service, and shops. The mediating effect of increased threat perception in the event of actual pandemic is likely to raise compliance but data suggest that certain sectors of the general population are likely to remain resistant to mask wearing and require further encouragement, communication strategies, and education.",

Although the adoption of such an approach might seem compelling, Middaugh in a recent paper23 warns about the unintended consequences of raising concern over \u2018frightening\u2019 the public about germs, increasing concern about seasonal influenza (to increase take-up of vaccination) and emphasizing the role of social distancing.
