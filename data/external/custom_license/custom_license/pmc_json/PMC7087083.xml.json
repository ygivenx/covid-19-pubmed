In an ultrasound, one author detected a thickening of the radial nerve [13]. In other cases, histology fat necrosis [7, 10] and a granulomatous reaction [10] were reported in histological examinations and an EMG showed either normal results [11], absent sensory and motor response [7, 8] or fibrillation [15]. In most cases, no further investigation has been done. In a recently published case [5], a subcutaneous fat necrosis and a deep-seated hematoma in the region of the radial nerve are documented. In our case, we decided to renounce further investigation due to the typical clinical features.",
