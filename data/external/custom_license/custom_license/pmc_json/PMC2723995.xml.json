Based on their physiologic and pharmacological properties, imidazoline receptors are classified into three main types: I1R, I2R, and I3R [2\u20134]. I1R and I2R have been implicated in hypertension and psychiatric disorder regulation, respectively, while I3R may be involved in insulin secretion [5\u20139]. Compared with mitochondrial I2R, which resides within the monoamine oxidase protein [10], the clonidine-preferring imidazoline binding sites (known as I1R) are localized to plasma membrane fractions [11, 12] and specifically to synaptic plasma membranes [13].",

            "text": "A strong candidate for I1R, known as imidazoline receptor antisera-selected protein (IRAS), has been cloned from human hippocampus [14]. hIRAS is a larger protein of 1504 amino acids consisting of an NH2-terminal phox (PX) domain, 5 putative leucine-rich repeats, a predicted coiled-coil domain, and a long COOH-terminal region. Several evidence supported the identity of native I1R and IRAS protein in tissue distributions, ligand binding properties, some cellular functions and downstream signal pathways [14\u201318]. The murine form of IRAS, Nischarin, truncated at the N-terminal 244 amino acids including the PX domain compared with the hIRAS, was a soluble cytosolic protein involved in cytoskeletal organization [19]. It has been shown that decreasing the expression of rat IRAS or Nischarin in PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells could attenuate the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) or reduce the radioligand binding to I1R, which further supported that hIRAS or Nischarin might serve as I1R itself, or at least a functional subunit of I1R [20]. Recently, Molderings et al. have reported that the \u201cI1-imidazoline receptors\u201d mediating effects of clonidine and moxonidine in PC12 and the transfected HEK293 cells belonged to the S1P-receptor family, in particular, representing a mixture of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P)1- and S1P3-receptors and/or heterodimers of both. It was then proposed that an increased expression of IRAS or Nischarin may improve the receptor-trafficking from cytosolic S1P-receptors to the cell membrane and thereby increase the number of binding sites in the plasma membrane for radioligand binding [21]. In our previous study, we also reported that IRAS mediated agmatine-induced inhibition of opioid dependence in morphine-dependent cells [22]. Despite intensive efforts, the molecular base of the I1R had not yet been elucidated.",

            "text": "To elucidate the functional and structure properties of I1R, several different epitope-specific antisera against IRAS have been raised in rabbits [23]. Because of IRAS splice variants or nonspecificity of these antisera, more sizes of IRAS (\u224833, \u224885, \u2248170 KDa) have been visualized in various tissue and cells, which limited their uses on western blot. IRAS was reported to target to the endosomes by a combined action of a PX domain and a coiled-coil region. The PX domain, consisting of 10\u2013130 amino acids, was first identified from the sequence analysis of two SH3 domain-containing cytosolic components of NADPH oxidase, p47phox  and p40phox  [24]. Therefore, in the present study, we developed the newly monoclonal antibody against the N-terminal hIRAS region including the PX domain (10\u2013120aa). This development has great utility for immunoblotting, indirect immunofluorescent staining, immunoprecipitation, and flow cytometry. These monoclonal antibodies will provide powerful reagents for the further investigation of hIRAS protein functions.",
