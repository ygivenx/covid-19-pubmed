On April 18, results of a physical examination (including chest radiograph) for a visa extension in Qatar were unremarkable. On the day of arrival back in Tunisia (April 28), the patient experienced chills, followed by arthralgia, dry cough, and fever. The daughter reported that her father had had no direct contact with camels during his stay in Qatar or Saudi Arabia. One of his children (patient 3, a nurse) gave him acetaminophen and aspirin for 3 days and then intravenously administered dexamethasone (4 mg) twice a day for 2 days. On May 6, patient 1 experienced worsened dyspnea and he sought care at the Centre Hospitalier-Universitaire Fattouma Bourguiba Hospital (Monastir, Tunisia) emergency department, where he received a fifth injection of dexamethasone. Chest radiograph showed left lower lobe infiltrate (Technical Appendix Figure). The patient was first admitted to the pulmonary ward, where he received amoxicillin-clavulanate (1 g) 3 times daily; however, on May 8, respiratory failure and peripheral signs of shock necessitated admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), where he was positioned prone and given noradrenalin infusion and mechanical ventilation with additional nitric oxide.",

The lavage fluid was then tested in the Tunisia National Reference Laboratory (TNRL) for MERS-CoV by using real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) upE (region upstream of the E gene), open reading frame (ORF) 1a, and ORF1b assays. These assays were developed in house according to the Corman et al. protocol (3); results were negative. On May 10, patient 1 died of multiple organ failure. Because nasopharyngeal swab samples from his 2 adult children were positive for MERS-CoV, the case of patient 1 was reported to the World Health Organization as probable MERS-CoV infection (4).",
