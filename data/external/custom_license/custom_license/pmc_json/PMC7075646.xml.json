Seminal work investigating the stability of the coiled\ncoil suggests that helices consisting of fewer than three heptads\ngenerally do not create enough opportunities for hydrophobic interactions\nin the core to favor superhelical assembly.27,28 On the basis of the X-ray crystallography and coiled-coil sequence-to-structure\nrelationship study, we engineered a peptide containing the three integral\nheptads, designated as P21, spanning residues 1260\u20131280 of\nthe MERS-CoV S protein CHR as a template for inhibitor design (Figure 1C). Analysis of the\ncrystal structure of CHR in complex with NHR helices shows that six\nresidues at the a and d positions\n(L1262, M1266, L1269, V1273, L1276, and Y1280) are buried in the 6-HB.\nIn addition to the hydrophobic interactions contributed by their side\nchains, residues L1262, M1266, V1273, and Y1280 form four hydrogen\nbonds with NHR-helical trimer residues, including Q1023, N1016, Q1009,\nand K1000, via their main-chain amino or oxygen groups. Meanwhile,\nthe hydroxyl group of the Y1280 side chain accepts a hydrogen bond\nfrom the NH group of Q1009 in NHR helices.11,16 Together with critical hydrophobic stacking forces, these hydrogen\nbonds constitute a polar contact network that further tightly ties\nCHR to NHR helix. We initially utilized the \u201cstaple scanning\u201d\napproach along the length of the peptide helix, but away from the\ncritical a\u2013d residues, to\nidentify the optimal stapling sites. We substituted pairs of (S)-2-(4-pentenyl)alanine (abbreviated as S5 residues) at\nthe i and i+4 positions because\nit is the most widely used unnatural amino acid for such type of staple.21 Accumulated evidence that underline the structure\nand stability of coiled-coils has shown that the superhelix stability\ncan generally be improved by inserting residues with more hydrophobic\nside chains at the a\u2013d positions.28,29 Among the six buried a\u2013d residues, Leu and Val, who possess high hydropathy indices,30 can strongly bind to the grooves on the surface\nof the N-helix trimer through their fully hydrophobic side chain interactions\nbut Met and Tyr are polar residues. On the basis of the scanning study\nresults, we elected to create stapled structures with hydrophobic\nmutations in the buried a\u2013d residues through individual substitution of M1266 or Y1280 with l-norleucine, an isosteric Met analogue with less polar and\nmore hydrophobic properties,31 or F, respectively,\nor a combination of both replacements, thus expecting to form a potential\nhydrophobic binding core.",

Among these \u03b1-helical\nmimetics, P21S8 and P21S10 strongly inhibited S protein-mediated cell\u2013cell\nfusion, with EC50 values of 0.26 and 0.33 \u03bcM, respectively,\nwhich are even more potent than the most active MERS-CoV fusion inhibitor\nso far, namely the 36-mer peptide HR2P-M2.11 Importantly, their unmetathesized analogues, i.e., peptides containing\nun-cross-linked S5 residues had a dramatically decreased membrane\nfusion inhibitory potency (Table 1). These results reveal the critical contribution of\nhydrocarbon stapling to replicate the local topography of MERS-CoV\nshort C-terminal helices for therapeutic benefit. In addition, shifting\nthe position of the all-hydrocarbon staple had a significant effect\non anti-MERS-CoV activity. Peptides P21S2, P21S4, P21S5, and P21S9,\nwith a 2/6, 5/9, 8/12, and 15/19 staple, respectively, exhibited only\nsimilar activity compared to their relevant unstapled peptides, whereas\npeptides P21S1, P21S3, P21S6, and P21S7 had no activity. Compared\nto P21S8 whose cross-link had the S,S-configuration, its R,R-configured\ncounterpart, P21R8, provided 62-fold weaker anti-MERS-CoV activity,\nconsistent with previous publications revealing the requirement of S-form building blocks for an i, i+4 staple type.21 Finally, we\nexplored whether the incorporation of hydrophobic mutations at the\nbinding interface could lead to an improvement in biological activity.\nIn our assay, replacing M1266 with l-norleucine (i.e., Z),\nwhich led to P21S8Z, retained the high activity of P21S8 whereas Y1280F\nalone and the combination of M1266Z and Y1280F showed decreased potencies\ncompared to that of P21S8, indicating the critical role of hydrogen\nbond formation between Y1280 and Q1009 of the S protein NHR trimer.\nAlthough buried hydrophobic residues may contribute more energy toward\nstabilization of a coiled-coil structure than polar interactions,28,32 subtle specific interacting networks are required for hydrocarbon-stapled\npeptides to stop the MERS-CoV\u2013cell fusion process efficiently.",

As shown in Table 2 and Supporting Information, Figure S1, P21S8, P21S10, and P21S8Z could significantly\ninhibit the MERS-CoV pseudovirus carrying the wild-type S protein,\nwith EC50 values of 3.03, 0.97, and 2.80 \u03bcM, respectively.\nAlthough P21S8 exhibited 2.8-fold greater potency than the positive\ncontrol HR2P-M2 in inhibiting cell\u2013cell fusion, it was 2.8-fold\nless active than HR2P-M2 against wild-type MERS-CoV pseudovirus. Notably,\nP21S10 displayed potency similar to that of HR2P-M2 in both cell\u2013cell\nand virus\u2013cell fusion inhibition. These results suggest that,\nunlike P21S10, P21S8 does not have good correlation between its blockage\nof S protein-mediated membrane fusion and inhibition of wild-type\nMERS-CoV infection. One of the possible explanations for this discrepancy\nis that P21S8 may have lower target binding capability than P21S10\nduring the inhibition of virus infection. In addition, none of these\nviral fusion blockers displayed significant cytotoxicity to Huh-7\ncells up to 100 \u03bcM (Table 2 and Supporting Information, Figure S2). The selectivity index (SI = CC50/EC50) of P21S10 was greater than 103. Among clinical MERS-CoV strains,\nS protein amino acid changes of Q1020H and Q1020R located in the NHR\ndomain were under positive selection and present in nearly all variants.33 Therefore, we next investigated whether P21S8,\nP21S10, and P21S8Z would be effective against MERS-CoV strains with\nthe Q1020H and Q1020R mutations. Strikingly, these peptides were effective\nfor inhibiting infection by MERS-CoV pseudoviruses with mutated S\nprotein, with EC50 values similar to those for inhibiting\npseudovirus carrying the wild-type S protein (Table 2 and Supporting Information, Figure S1). P21S8 and P21S8Z displayed about\n3-fold less potency than HR2P-M2 for inhibiting infection by pseudoviruses\ncarrying S protein with Q1020H or Q1020R mutation; however, P21S10\npossessed potency similar to that of HR2P-M2. Because MERS-CoV is\nprimarily infecting the human respiratory tract, we further tested\nthe inhibitory activities of these stapled peptides on MERS-CoV pseudovirus\ninfection in a human lung-derived cell line Calu-3. Strikingly, P21S8,\nP21S10, and P21S8Z could inhibit MERS-CoV pseudovirus infection in\nCalu-3 cells with EC50 values of 2.21, 1.58, and 2.57 \u03bcM,\nrespectively, in an agreement with result observed in experiment using\nHuh-7 cells (Supporting Information, Table S1 and Figure S1). They also had no significant\ncytotoxicity to Calu-3 cells at the concentrations as high as 100\n\u03bcM (Supporting Information, Figure S3). Moreover, we evaluated the aqueous solubility of these stapled\npeptides. P21S8 and P21S10 had aqueous solubilities of 6.47 and 10.5\nmg/mL at pH 7.4, respectively, which were 14-fold and 22-fold higher\nthan that of P21S8Z (Supporting Information, Table S2), suggesting their good potential for further development.",

Furthermore, these stapled peptides were indeed more helical than\ntheir correponding uncyclized linear precursors (Supporting Information, Table S3\u2013S4). These data further confirmed\nthe successful mimicry of the CHR helix via cyclization using the\nstapling strategy. Interestingly, although the CD spectra for peptides\nP21S8 and P21S10 were similar to those of P21S6 and P21S7, a difference\nin inhibitory potency of more than 193-fold was observed between them,\nsuggesting that the much higher biological activity cannot be merely\nattributed to the helical propensity.

The significant\nincrease over the sum of the individual spectra of two peptides mixed\ntogether in equimolar concentrations indicates that the interaction\nbetween them led to enhanced helical structures.34,35 The isolated HR1P displays a random coil structure in phosphate\nbuffer (pH 7.2) as judged by CD spectroscopy, which was consistent\nwith previous reports.11 Both P21S8 and\nP21S10 interacted with HR1P, resulting in 35.5% and 45.6% \u03b1-helical\ncontent in the complex, respectively. The CD signals of the P21S8/HR1P\nmixture and the P21S10/HR1P mixture at 222 nm were dramatically greater\nthan the mathematical sum of those of the isolated peptides, indicating\nthe induction of a large \u03b1-helical structure upon their interaction\n(Figure 3A). Strikingly,\nthe thermal unfolding transition (Tm)\nvalues of P21S8/HR1P and P21S10/HR1P reached 71.1 and 76.4 \u00b0C,\nrespectively (Figure 3B). Together, these CD data are consistent with P21S8/HR1P and P21S10/HR1P\nfolding to form thermally stable and cooperatively folded helical\nbundles. Stapled peptides with moderate activity, including P21S4,\nP21S5, and P21S9, resulted in a less stable interaction with Tm values ranging from 56.6 to 66.6 \u00b0C while\npeptides with very poor antiviral activity showed no, or weak, coiled-coil\ninteractions (Supporting Information, Table S4).

In N-PAGE, owing\nto its net positive charge, HR1P did not appear on the gel as it migrated\ninto the solvent under the native electrophoresis conditions; these\nresults are consistent with previous observations.11 The respective stapled helical peptides with various antiviral\npotencies were mixed with HR1P and subjected to N-PAGE analysis. As\nshown in Figure 3C,\nboth P21S8 and P21S10 formed stable complexes with HR1P, as evidenced\nby new bands at the upper position in the gel concomitant with the\nfading or disappearance of the stapled peptide bands, suggesting that\noligomeric complexes formed via coiled-coil interactions.

This is in agreement with the CD data, where the signal of the\nP21S7/HR1P mixture was dramatically smaller than that of the mathematical\nsum of the isolated peptides, suggesting that addition of P21S7 to\nHR1P distorts the \u03b1-helical conformation of P21S7 due to their\ninteraction.

These stapled peptides were\nable to block the formation of the hexameric coiled-coil fusion complex\nand thus inhibit viral\u2013host cell membrane fusion. Our data\nshowed that one of these stapled peptides, P21S10, not only preserves\nthe biologically active \u03b1-helical conformation, as found in\nthe MERS-CoV fusion machinery, but also has good potential to be developed\ninto anti-MERS therapeutics based on its promising antiviral activity,\neffective native ligand-binding capability, and favorable pharmacokinetics.\nFormation of MERS-CoV 6-HB fusion core between CHR and NHR is basically\nthe result of \u03b1-helix-mediated protein\u2013protein interactions\nwherein the CHR helix can be considered to have two distinct faces,\ni.e., a buried hydrophobic surface and a solvent-exposed surface.29 The established rules of thumb that underline\nthe sequence and structure in coiled coils reveal that stabilization\nof individual helices will enhance the overall stability of the superhelical\nprotein structural motif.28 Therefore,\nstrategies used for reinforcing the secondary structure of constituent\n\u03b1-helices in a coiled coil such as introducing intrahelical\nsalt bridges at solvent accessible site and substitution of noncore\nresidues with helix-favoring amino acids have been successfully applied\nto HIV fusion inhibitor design.36 We envisioned\nthat these strategies would also be applicable to the further optimization\nof our lead compounds found in this study. In addition, rather than\ngenerating hydrophobic mutations in buried residues, for future design\none should also consider the place of polar amino acids at the interactive\nsite of stapled peptides, which could establish attractive interhelical\nelectrostatic interactions or hydrogen bonds, thus increasing their\naqueous solubility and target-binding affinity.37,38 Overall, considering the universal 6HB fusion mechanism employed\nby the class I enveloped viruses, our study establishes the paradigm\nthat hydrocarbon stapling may be an attractive strategy for developing\nviral entry inhibitors designed to control viral epidemics through\nrecapitulating certain \u03b1-helical peptides of the viral fusion\ncore structures so that NHR/CHR coiled coil-mediated interactions\nare inhibited.",

Natural amino acids were coupled using O-benzotriazol-1-yl-N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetramethyl-uronium hexafluorophosphate (3 equiv)\nin DMF and diisopropylethylamine (DIEA) (6 equiv) in NMP as coupling\nreagents, 3 equiv of N\u03b1-protected\namino acid, and 3 equiv of 1-hydroxy-benzotriazole. After each coupling,\nor Fmoc removal, the resin was washed with DMF (5 \u00d7 1 min) and\nDCM (3 \u00d7 1 min). For the assembly of olefin-containing amino\nacids, a double coupling method was performed to achieve a complete\nreaction, as described previously.39 After\nfinal deprotection, the peptide-bound resin was treated with acetic\nacid anhydride\u2013DIEA (1:1, v/v) (2 \u00d7 30 min). For synthesis\nof the all-hydrocarbon-stapled peptides, the RCM reactions of the\nprotected peptides containing S5 ((S)-2-(4-pentenyl)alanine)\nor R5 ((R)-2-(4-pentenyl)alanine) were performed\non-resin using the first-generation Grubbs catalyst. First, the reaction\nbottle containing peptide-bound resin was kept under lucifugal conditions\nby silver paper and then protected under nitrogen. Second, Grubbs\nI catalyst (0.3 equiv) in dichloroethane was added to the resin, the\nmixture was stirred for 6 h at room temperature, and then repeated\ntreatments with fresh catalyst were carried out for 6 h to obtain\nmore complete conversion. After the reaction solution was drained,\nthe resin was washed with DMF (2 \u00d7 1 min) and DCM (2 \u00d7 1\nmin). The resin cleavage was performed by treatment with a cleavage\ncocktail containing 85% TFA, 5% thioanisole, 5% m-cresol, and 5% water. After cleavage from resin, crude peptides\nwere precipitated using cold diethyl ether. The crude products were\npurified by preparative reversed-phase (RP) HPLC, and the purity of\neach compound was confirmed to be \u226595% by analytical RP-HPLC.\nSuch information is provided in the Supporting Information (Tables S6\u2013S7).
