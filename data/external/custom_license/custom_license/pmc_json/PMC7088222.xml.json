            "text": "Diarrhoea is a common problem in young calves and a cause of impaired animal welfare. Farmers may suffer large economic losses due to veterinary treatments, mortality and reduced growth rates. Calf diarrhoea has a multifactorial aetiology, and Cryptosporidium parvum is a protozoan parasite that is frequently associated with the disease (de la Fuente et al. 1999; Joachim et al. 2003; Snodgrass et al. 1986). The parasite is resistant in the environment (Fayer 2008), creating high infection pressures in some affected herds. Other common diarrhoeal pathogens are rotavirus, coronavirus and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli F5+ (Barrington et al. 2002; de la Fuente et al. 1999; Foster and Smith 2009). E. coli F5+ causes diarrhoea in calves younger than 1 week, whereas the other three pathogens mainly cause diarrhoea in 1- to 3-week-old calves. Individual calf factors such as failure of passive transfer of colostral antibodies, and management associated factors such as personnel and stable hygiene, routines at calving, milk feeding regimens and crowding, affect the course of disease (Barrington et al. 2002).",

            "text": "A limitation with previously performed studies on the association of diarrhoea and cryptosporidiosis in calves is that all oocysts approximately 5 \u03bcm in diameter until recently were recognised as C. parvum. However, molecular diagnostic methods have shown that three morphologically similar species, C. parvum, Cryptosporidium bovis and Cryptosporidium ryanae, can be found in cattle. Several studies applying DNA analysis have identified C. parvum in 88.0\u201395.5% of preweaned calf diarrhoeal samples, with C. bovis and C. ryanae detected in 0\u20135.9% and 1.6\u20135.9% of samples, respectively (Plutzer and Karanis 2007; Soba and Logar 2008; Thompson et al. 2007). In contrast to C. parvum, C. bovis, C. ryanae and a fourth larger species, Cryptosporidium andersoni, are considered to be associated with subclinical infection in cattle (Fayer et al. 2007; Langkjaer et al. 2006). We have shown that Cryptosporidium parasites are ubiquitous in Swedish dairy herds but we found no association between infection and diarrhoea in individual calves (Silverl\u00e5s et al. 2009). With the help of DNA analysis, we identified C. bovis as the most prevalent species (74%) in preweaned calves, and C. parvum, C. bovis and C. ryanae were all detected in diarrhoeal calves (Silverl\u00e5s et al. 2010). It is thus not correct to conclude that diarrhoea is associated with C. parvum solely based on the presence of C. parvum-like oocysts. The improved diagnostic methods call for to further examine the relationship between Cryptosporidium infection and diarrhoea. It is also important to identify additional factors affecting the course of infection because a key component for improved calf health in herds with Cryptosporidium-associated diarrhoea is to decrease infection pressure by improved management.",

Samplings were done by herd health veterinarians or by author CS. Matched case\u2013control herds were sampled by the same veterinarian within a week from each other. A total of eight veterinarians participated. Detailed instructions about sampling procedures and data collection were sent to participating veterinarians to minimise personnel bias. Rectal faecal samples were collected from 10 calves (\u22642 months old), 10 young stock (4\u201312 months old) and five periparturient cows (1 week before expected partus to 2 weeks post partum). Any additional calves with diarrhoea were also sampled. Eight herds had insufficient number of calves, young stock or periparturient cows at sampling, in which case all calves or young stock in the preset age interval and five cows as close to the preset interval as possible were sampled. Jugular vein blood was collected in serum tubes from a maximum of five 1- to 8-day-old calves in each herd. For sampled calves, a number of parameters, e.g. age, the consistency of faeces, general condition, pen environment and any medical treatment (drug, disease and dates of treatment) were recorded. For sampled young stock and cows, consistency of faeces and age were recorded. For cows the number of days in relation to calving was also recorded. The visiting veterinarian completed the questionnaires through interviews with the farmers.",

Shedding rates approximately follow bell shaped curves over time, and shedding intensity and diarrhoeal intensity seem to peak around the same time (Jarvie et al. 2005; Joachim et al. 2003; Lallemond et al. 2006; Lefay et al. 2001; Villacorta et al. 1991). For calves with high C. parvum shedding rates, it is thus likely that the parasite is associated with diarrhoea, and the identification of high numbers of C. bovis oocysts in diarrhoeic samples indicates that this species can cause diarrhoea in calves. C. bovis has been associated with subclinical infection (Sant\u00edn et al. 2004), but massive intestinal invasion with subsequent diarrhoea should be possible if enough other factors, such as lack of passive immunity, are present, even if this species would lack virulence factors similar to those present in C. parvum.",

Because intestinal damage is caused by the intracellular parasite stages, diarrhoea might be present already when the first few oocysts are shed because these do not reflect the intensity of intestinal invasion. Moreover, calves with failure of passive transfer of colostral antibodies have poor health to start with, and might develop diarrhoea more easily and at a lower degree of intestinal invasion than calves with sufficient passive transfer. On the other hand, if the few oocysts reflect low-grade infection, the real cause for diarrhoea could be an unidentified pathogen. Repeated samplings are crucial to confirm or reject the association between infection and diarrhoea in these calves, but that could not be done in this study.",

This indicates that other diarrhoeal causes such as Eimeria spp., or dietary imbalances could also be present in the herds of this study. However, diarrhoeal pathogens outside the \u201cC. parvum diarrhoeal window\u201d were not targeted because the main focus was to investigate the role of different Cryptosporidium species in herds with diarrhoeal problems. The reason for including calves older than 4 weeks is that we have shown Cryptosporidium infection to be common in this age group (Silverl\u00e5s et al. 2009). Preweaned calves are often kept close together so these calves may act as an important infection source for the younger ones. Indeed, a high prevalence in old calves was shown in this study as well (Fig. 1).

We have no explanation for the results regarding rotavirus. We used the same ELISA, and the same person performed the analysis as in two Swedish studies that identified rotavirus in 24% and 44% of diarrhoeal samples, and in 8.9% and 3.7% of non-diarrhoeal samples (Bj\u00f6rkman et al. 2003; de Verdier Klingenberg and Svensson 1998). The coronavirus results are not so surprising. Bj\u00f6rkman et al. (2003) found a low prevalence (3%) of coronavirus-positive diarrhoeal samples, and in a recent Norwegian study (Gulliksen et al. 2009) no diarrhoeal samples were positive for coronavirus. In addition, our results are supported by Snodgrass et al. (1986) who found coronavirus to be equally common in healthy and diseased calves. The low prevalence of E. coli F5+-positive samples was in accordance with previous studies (Bj\u00f6rkman et al. 2003; de Verdier Klingenberg and Svensson 1998). Other pathogens such as Salmonella spp. have been reported as common calf diarrhoeal pathogens (Barrington et al. 2002). In addition, bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) is recognised as an important calf health modulator worldwide, among other things causing immunosuppression and diarrhoea. As a result of successful control programmes, BVDV and Salmonella are uncommon in Swedish cattle, with 99.8% of herds being free from BVDV (professor Stefan Alenius, personal communication), and Salmonella only being identified in five to 13 herds per year (Anonymous 2007).",

The same association has been shown for weaners (Maddox-Hyttel et al. 2006). This association could be seen as an effect\u2014i.e. herds with diarrhoeal problems start to disinfect. However, because these herds still had problems, disinfection seemed either not to work or to be insufficient. Moreover, if disinfection routines were started a short time prior to sampling, the full effect might not have been reached at the time of sampling. We did not ask about how long these routines had been used, and cannot investigate this possibility further because of the high risk of recall bias. A potential explanation for disinfection not working is that farmers rely on the disinfectant to do the work of reducing infection pressure instead of cleaning thoroughly. Without proper cleaning, only the surface of the dirt layer is disinfected, pathogens can continue to thrive beneath, and calves are exposed again as soon as the top layer is disrupted. Cryptosporidia are resistant to most commercial disinfectants (Fayer 2008). Thus, if cryptosporidia constitute a large part of the problem even proper disinfection that reduces viral and bacterial pathogens would not be successful. Of the disinfectants used by farmers in this study, Virkon has not proven effective against Cryptosporidium oocysts (Fayer 2008, Table 1.9). Lime seems to reduce oocyst numbers (Graczyk et al. 2008; Zintl et al. 2010). These studies used quicklime (CaO) on sewage sludge (Graczyk et al. 2008) or hydrated lime (Ca[OH]2) in water solution and purified oocyst solutions incubated in used bedding material (Zintl et al. 2010). The effect of powdered hydrated lime on faecal oocysts has to our knowledge not been tested. Still, this might be at least partially effective in reducing oocyst load. We have not been able to identify references concerning the components of Stalosan F. Drying and heating are effective for decreasing oocyst viability (Fayer 2008, Table 1.7). Thus, proper cleaning (with water), followed by drying and use of powdered quicklime, or the use of deep litter bedding (provided that the surface is regularly overlaid with dry, clean bedding material) might be two effective ways of keeping Cryptosporidium infection pressure down.",

The fact that disinfection of single pens was identified as a risk factor could have several explanations that have already been discussed. The type of diarrhoea most common in preweaned calves could also be seen as an effect rather than a risk for belonging to a case herd. This variable was introduced in the model as an indicator of total infection pressure, hypothesising that a low total infection pressure would be more associated with pasty diarrhoea and that a high total infection pressure would be more associated with watery diarrhoea. Because some farmers stated that the type of diarrhoea varied considerably, this represented a third level of the variable. Indeed, although the level watery diarrhoea tended to have higher OR, this was the level that produced a significantly higher OR compared to pasty diarrhoea. A highly fluctuating infection pressure, due to e.g. long time between thorough cleaning of pens or fluctuations in calving intensity, could explain the significant association.",
