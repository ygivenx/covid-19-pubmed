Influenza A viruses of subtypes H3N2 and H1N1 have been circulating in the human population since 1968 and 1977, respectively. However, in 1997, the highly pathogenic avian H5N1 virus emerged in China, subsequently spread across Europe and into Africa in 2004\u20132005 and continues to cause sporadic zoonotic human infection associated with high mortality\n1\n in multiple countries. In 2009, the first pandemic of the 21st century was caused by a novel H1N1 influenza virus of swine origin. This pandemic H1N1 2009 virus has been associated uncommonly with severe viral pneumonia and excess mortality in children and young to middle\u2010aged adults\n2\n and continues to circulate in the human population today. These recent events and the continued threat of pandemics caused by other subtypes have lead to renewed influenza research on disease pathogenesis, clinical management and novel therapeutic options.",

However, this underestimates the total number of deaths owing to lack of ascertainment. Furthermore, an accurate case fatality rate is difficult to determine owing to incomplete surveillance data on mild and asymptomatic cases. In Hong Kong, seroepidemiology and investigation into hospitalised cases have allowed good estimates of pandemic H1N1 2009 infection attack rates and disease severity. The overall population attack rate was found to be 10.7%, but infection and mortality rates were highly age dependent. Whilst overall infection rates of those 30\u201360 years of age were low, case fatality rates increased dramatically in older adults (i.e. 66\u2010fold increase in fatality rates in those 50\u201060 years of age compared with children).\n6\n Many mild or asymptomatic infections occurred, especially in children, as reported elsewhere.\n6\n, \n7\n Thus, H5N1 has infected small numbers of people, but the proportion developing severe disease is very high, whereas the disease profile of pandemic H1N1 infections shows that the proportion of severe cases is very small with a far larger proportion of mild and asymptomatic infections. These observations suggest an important role of as\u2010yet\u2010unidentified host genetic factors in predisposing to infection by H5N1 and to severe disease by both H5N1 and pandemic H1N1 viruses.",

The pathology is characterised by a primary viral pneumonia that can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ failure (MOF) associated with lymphopenia and renal and liver dysfunction. The virus can sometimes disseminate systemically to cause extrapulmonary disease, but the major cause of death is caused by progressive respiratory failure. Severe pandemic H1N1 disease has been associated in the majority of cases with underlying conditions such as pregnancy, morbid obesity, chronic respiratory disease or cardiovascular problems, but the proportion of severely affected patients who have no recognised underlying condition has exceeded 50% in some reports, therefore many previously healthy persons developed severe disease. Whilst the risk of severe disease in pandemic H1N1 infections was lower than with H5N1, those who did develop severe disease had similar lung pathology and respiratory complications, usually succumbing to ARDS and acute respiratory failure. In contrast to severe H5N1 disease, a significant proportion of patients with severe pandemic H1N1 illness had secondary bacterial infection at presentation (26\u201355% of fatal cases).",

Evidence for a dysregulated host innate immune response in H5N1 infections comes from clinical observations and animal models of infections (reviewed in Peiris et al. 2009\n8\n). H5N1 infections induce high levels of proinflammatory serum cytokines and chemokines (e.g. MCP\u20101 IL\u20106, TNF\u2010\u03b1 and IL\u20108) which correlate with nasopharyngeal viral loads.\n9\n H5N1 infection of macaques also shows markedly elevated levels of innate cytokine production that corresponds to prolonged, high\u2010level viral replication.\n10\n H5N1 preferentially infected type II pneumocytes in the lung that function to maintain lung integrity and repair that are compromised during influenza infection.\n10\n Of note, fatal cases of pandemic H1N1 virus infection show viral replication in both type I and II pneumocytes.\n11\n In a novel attempt to reduce disease severity, a CXCR3 antagonist (AMG487) has been used to block an innate signalling pathway in a ferret model. Ferrets infected with H5N1 and treated with AMG487 showed a reduction in weight loss and viral load, although final mortality rates were the same for both treated and untreated ferrets.\n12\n\n",

It is unclear whether severe disease and ongoing viral replication cause the dysregulated cytokine patterns observed, or whether and to what extent the cytokine dysregulation causes the severe disease. Correlations exist between increased viral load and increased cytokine levels,\n8\n so that continued viral replication is a contributing factor to disease. One strategy to elucidate the mechanisms of the early innate responses to infection is to use in vitro systems employing primary human epithelial cells and macrophages. Both epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages can be infected with H5N1 virus, and cytokines produced by each cell type act in an autocrine and paracrine manner.\n13\n Studies to date have shown that primary human macrophages infected with H5N1 differentially express proinflammatory cytokines by stronger activation of the p38MAPK and IRF\u20103 cell signalling pathways.\n14\n, \n15\n, \n16\n, \n17\n In addition, primary human macrophages infected with H5N1 produce highly elevated levels of TNF\u2010\u03b1, IFN\u2010\u03b2 and IFN\u2010\u03bb1 in comparison with seasonal H1N1 infection.\n17\n Transcriptomic studies on macrophages infected with H5N1 and seasonal H1N1 influenza infection show that the marked differences between these viruses are quantitative rather than qualitative differences resulting from activating unique signalling pathways.\n18\n Primary epithelial cells infected with H5N1 also upregulate the expression of proinflammatory cytokines like IFN\u2010\u03b2, IL\u20106, IL\u20108 and chemokines.\n19\n The cytokines produced by the epithelial cells and macrophages represent only the start of the immune response, and their paracrine action further amplifies and broadens the host response. As infection progresses, leucocytes are recruited to the infection site, thus enabling adaptive immunity to develop. Because H5N1 infection causes an early rise in chemokines, it is expected that increased numbers of immune cells are also recruited to the lung. Cyclooxygenase \u20102 (cox\u20102) has been found to play a central role in amplifying this proinflammatory response and therefore may be a suitable target for therapeutic intervention.\n13\n In addition, recent in vitro studies showed that endothelial cells also upregulate cytokine expression in a manner similar to that seen in epithelial cells after H5N1 infection.\n20\n Because H5N1 viruses can infect and egress from endothelial cells from either the apical or basolateral aspect, this provides a mechanism by which these viruses may spread systemically.\n20\n\n",

The main pathologic observations noted in pandemic H1N1 fatalities included tracheitis, bronchitis and bronchiolitis, often accompanied by inflammation, ulceration and squamous metaplasia. These pathologic findings are similar to those observed in autopsies from the 1918 pandemic.\n35\n In both instances, the lungs frequently exhibited oedema, haemorrhage, infiltrating lymphocytes and diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with hyaline membrane formation, a hallmark of ARDS. The type of DAD varied between patients; the majority of fatal cases manifesting DAD had acute DAD (64% of cases) associated with a shorter time in hospital before death (mean, 3.4 days), as compared to those with organising DAD (28% of cases; mean, 11.7 days) or fibrosing DAD (8% of cases; mean, 31.5 days). These patterns are similar to those seen in SARS where fatal cases that had a hospital duration or 10 days or less exhibited acute DAD, whereas cases hospitalised for more than 10 days showed organising DAD.\n36\n It would be important to fully understand the mechanisms behind the very striking pulmonary inflammatory reactions in some patients. Whilst almost all of these patients would have been artificially ventilated with high airway pressures and oxygen levels, interventions that might cause additional damage and associated fibrosis, similar fibrosis was also seen in fatal cases during previous pandemics where such interventions were not used. Therefore, it is thought that these pathologic observations are primarily a function of the disease rather than mechanical interventions.",

Viral antigen often did not colocalise with foci of DAD, which might suggest rapid asynchronous kinetics of virus infection and clearance, as well as substantial heterogeneity in local pulmonary immune responses.

It seems that the pulmonary pathology remains consistent whilst the sector of the human population that is susceptible to lethal infection changes with each new viral emergence. The current pandemic deaths have occurred disproportionately in young adults, which is in contrast to seasonal influenza where most deaths occur in those over 65 years of age.\n39\n In the New York study, the decedents included two infants and 29 adults who ranged in age from 25 to 49 years. The factors that predispose to severe viral pneumonia are incompletely understood, but an important contributing factor appears to be the existence of underlying medical conditions. In this study, 91% of fatalities had a comorbidity, and those with obesity (BMI > 30; 72% of patients), especially morbid obesity (BMI > 39; 47% of patients), were disproportionately represented. The exact mechanism by which these comorbidities contribute to severe disease, in both seasonal and pandemic influenza, remains to be fully understood.

DAMPS comprise endogenous cellular or extracellular molecules released upon stress or damage and can include chemicals such as silica crystals and alum salts. DAMPS undergo lysosomal degradation causing the release of lysosomal cathepsin B that has been associated with NLRP3 activation and subsequent IL\u20101\u03b2 production and cell death. Lysosomal degradation products can also initiate the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cytosol which in turn can also activate NLRP3. In vitro and in vivo mouse experiments showed that ROS inhibition reduced the IL\u20101\u03b2 response after influenza infection, suggesting that ROS formation is necessary for inflammasome activation during influenza infection.\n44\n Cathepsin B was also found to be necessary for the NLRP3\u2010dependent IL\u20101\u03b2 influenza response. These results indicate that the NLRP3 inflammasome response to influenza infection involves lysosomal cathepsin B and ROS that are typical of DAMP detection pathways. However, as discussed below, ROS also contribute to lung damage, and inhibitors like N\u2010acetyl cysteine have been used in individual cases of severe pandemic H1N1 influenza.\n45\n In addition, viral RNA sensing was also found to be important in initiating the inflammasome response: mice exposed to synthetic RNA analogues, both dsRNA and ssRNA, subsequently mediated NLRP3 inflammasome IL\u20101\u03b2 production.\n44\n These observations have the potential to inform therapeutic choices for future study, although much work will be necessary to characterise the magnitude and timing of the cytokine responses to other influenza viruses and in models involving other species before it can be determined that a particular immunomodulator might be of benefit and not retard viral clearance.",

They have described this as the \u2018innate immune rheostat\u2019, similar to a light controlled by a dimmer switch.\n76\n Activating molecules on alveolar macrophages include PRRs, CD40 and OX40L. Molecules that are involved in dampening the response include suppressive cytokines (e.g. IL\u201010), TGF\u2010\u03b2, adenosine and CD200L. The balance of both activation and dampening pathways is site specific, such that in mucosal sites, the balance is tipped in favour of the dampening pathways to prevent excessive and potentially damaging immune reactions.",

Homeostasis in the lung is maintained via signalling through epithelial TGF\u2010\u03b2, IL\u201010 and CD200 and the corresponding receptors (TGF\u2010\u03b2R, IL\u201010R and CD200R) found on alveolar macrophages. These signals serve to keep macrophages in a relatively inactivated state. After pathogen is encountered, the inflammation stage begins. Inflammation can be triggered by direct damage to the epithelium by infecting virus. Epithelial damage also leads to the loss of \u2018dampening\u2019 ligands that are found on the epithelial cells that express them, e.g. CD200. In addition, OX40L is upregulated on macrophages allowing helper signals to be provided to OX40\u2010expressing T, B and DC cells. During the resolution stage, macrophages upregulate CD200R expression to a level exceeding that seen before infection; therefore, post\u2010infection macrophages are in a stronger \u2018dampened\u2019 state than they were pre\u2010infection with a higher activation threshold and suppressed TLR responsiveness. OX40L is also maintained on alveolar macrophages after resolution.",

Innate and adaptive immune responses must also be allowed to prevent susceptibility to repeat and secondary infections. Conceptually, the \u2018inflammation\u2019 stage may be an optimal stage for therapeutic intervention. During this stage, macrophages and other APCs interact with T cells to elicit an effector T\u2010cell immune response. A number of costimulatory molecules are necessary for the development of this response, including the T\u2010cell\u2010expressed OX40 interaction with OX40L on APCs. OX40\u2010Ig fusion protein (OX40:Ig) can block the interaction between OX40 and OX40L. The administration of OX40:Ig to mice infected with influenza was found to significantly decrease morbidity and lung pathology, even with the treatment given as late as 3 days post\u2010infection.\n77\n OX40:Ig treatment did not affect viral titres in the lung, and both treated and untreated mice showed similar ability to clear virus.\n77\n During inflammation, epithelial cells are damaged leading to the loss of epithelial CD200, thereby contributing to the loss of dampening signals. An alternative therapeutic approach would therefore be to treat with exogenous CD200. Experiments where mice infected with influenza and then treated with CD200:Fc, both at the time of infection and up to 4 days post\u2010infection, showed reduced morbidity and lung inflammation and increased recovery.\n78\n In addition, a CD200R agonistic monoclonal antibody showed similar beneficial effects. Both the CD200:Fc and agonistic antibody treatment did not affect viral clearance.\n78\n These data indicate CD200R agonists as promising novel therapeutics.",

The \u2018innate immune rheostat\u2019 appears to be qualitatively different after influenza infection where a sustained increase in basal levels of CD200R is observed on alveolar macrophages.\n78\n In mice, influenza is also associated with an apparent post\u2010viral desensitization to TLR ligands which can last for up to 6 weeks post\u2010infection. Mice challenged with a TLR agonist 6 weeks after influenza infection showed a decrease in KC, MIP2\u03b1 and TNF\u2010\u03b1 expression in both alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells compared to uninfected controls.\n79\n This effect was not owing to differences in TLR expression levels but instead to reduced levels of NF\u2010\u03baB nuclear translocation in response to TLR ligation in alveolar macrophages.\n79\n Study of other virus strains, such as influenza X31 (A/Hong Kong/68 H3N2 HA and NA genes on a PR8 backbone) and RSV, in these systems indicate that the severity of the initial infection is related to an increase in CD200R after resolution, such that influenza causes more CD200R expression than RSV infections. This \u2018innate imprinting\u2019 can account for observations of increased susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections following influenza. Mice infected with influenza followed by a Streptococcus bacteria up to 2 weeks post\u2010influenza infection show not only an increase in bacterial load in the lung, but also much higher mortality than mice given virus or bacteria only\n79\n, \n80\n (Goulding J, A Godlee, S Vekaria, M Hilty, R Snelgrove, B Askonas and T Hussell, Imperial College London, unpublished observations). Of note, CD200R knockout mice can control respiratory bacterial infections better than wild\u2010type animals. In summary, the position of the \u2018innate immune rheostat\u2019 is specific to person, body site and previous pathogen experience. Each individual begins with a slightly different \u201crheostat\u2010setting\u201d that is further recalibrated each time a new infection is experienced.

Dr Jerry Aldridge (St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA) described a unique subset of dendritic cells (DCs) that contribute to this lung pathology and studies evaluating the alteration in innate cell trafficking hypothesised to occur during severe influenza infection. In mice infected with a lethal A/PR8 or a sublethal X31 virus inoculum, greater increases in a subset of lung DCs that were Ly6chi and CD11bhi (called tipDCs) occurred in animals infected with A/PR8 compared to X31.\n81\n Similarly, tipDCs were also increased in lungs of mice lethally infected with an A/H5N1 virus as compared to those infected with a non\u2010lethal H5N1 strain. TipDCs were found to be recruited to the lungs during influenza infection by the chemokine CCR2. However, in CCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice with ablated tipDC recruitment, no reduction in morbidity or protection from lethal challenge was observed. In addition, it was found that antigen\u2010specific CD8+ T\u2010cell numbers were significantly reduced in the airways, but not in the mediastinal lymph nodes, of CCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice, and this leads to compromised viral clearance. In studies using a virus mutated in two CD8+ T\u2010cell epitopes (in NP and PA) and a wild\u2010type virus of comparable replication competence, tipDCs from mice infected with the mutant virus and then adoptively transferred to X31 virus\u2010infected CCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice were unable to elicit an antigen\u2010specific CD8+ T\u2010cell response. In contrast, tipDCs adoptively transferred from the wild\u2010type virus\u2013infected mice were able to rescue this response. Therefore, antigen is likely presented by tipDCs, and this is a necessary prerequisite for the recruitment of antigen\u2010specific CD8+ T\u2010cell responses in the lung.",

Initial experiments used varying doses of MCP\u20101 neutralising antibodies and MCP\u20101\u2212/\u2212 mice to reduce tipDC recruitment via the MCP\u20101 ligand CCR2, but neither of these approaches had any effect. The peroxisome proliferator\u2013activated receptor\u2010\u03b3 (PPAR\u2010\u03b3) agonist pioglitazone, already a licensed drug for type II diabetes, has multiple pharmacologic actions including reducing MCP\u20101 (monocyte chemotactic protein\u20101 or CCL2), TNF\u2010\u03b1 and iNOS levels. Pioglitazone pre\u2010treatment of mice given A/PR8 virus reduced morbidity and mortality significantly without affecting viral replication. Protection was found to be correlated with reduced MCP\u20101 and MCP\u20103 production and fewer numbers of tipDCs in the lungs after infection. The fact that viral replication was not altered with pioglitazone and yet mortality improved in some experiments suggests mechanisms other than viral clearance might be operative, perhaps the amount of damage caused by CD8 cells, the rate of injury repair or alterations in other cell types within the infiltrating inflammatory population. Interestingly, an early increase in lung neutrophils was observed in pioglitazone\u2010treated mice, whereas some earlier studies have correlated increased neutrophil numbers with worse disease in 1918 virus\u2010infected mice.\n63\n Another action of pioglitazone is to alter mitochondrial membrane potential, which might lead to other intracellular inflammatory pathways and apoptosis that may enhance inflammation in some circumstances, potential effects that should be explored future experiments.

Therefore, to detect more subtle differences over a longer time frame, a subsequent experiment used the A/Hong Kong/486/97 H5N1 virus that is of lower lethality for mice.

CC10 is produced by many tissues in the body, but the highest expression of CC10 is found in the respiratory tract, where it is mainly produced by the non\u2010ciliated Clara cells of the epithelium and is the most abundant single protein normally found in respiratory mucosa.\n111\n, \n112\n CC10 appears to have multiple functions. It acts on Clara cells to facilitate cell trafficking and protein transport and probably upon other cell types, including vascular epithelial cells, neutrophils, lymphocytes and dendritic cells in a similar manner, but there is no consensus on its mechanism of action on other cell types. CC10 appears to act as an \u2018all is well\u2019 signal for epithelial cells. CC10 deficiency leads to severe inflammation and airway dysfunction and is associated with diseases such as pneumonia, ARDS, COPD, asthma and pulmonary fibrosis. CC10 maintains the airway epithelia and overall lung function through autocrine stimulation of Clara cell renewal and preservation of pulmonary structural integrity. CC10 can suppress NF\u2010\u03baB signalling and proinflammatory cytokine production which helps reduce vascular permeability, as well as accelerate viral clearance,\n113\n possibly by interfering with intracellular viral transport.\n114\n One audience member described recent work that found that during inflammation, part of the CC10 promoter is downregulated.

Inhibition of viral replication with efficient antivirals is likely essential but not sufficient to achieve optimal patient outcomes in severe human influenza. Effective immunomodulatory interventions, particularly combined with antivirals during periods of active viral replication, are needed for such patients. However, the functional redundancy of the pathways and rapid changes in responses over time involved create challenges for intervention. Considerable heterogeneity exists in innate immune responses related to both host and viral factors. Key questions regarding the particular targets for intervention, their appropriate level of inhibition, the timing (both initiation and cessation) of intervention within the course of infection and the appropriate patient populations remain to be resolved. Downregulation of overly exuberant innate immune responses also has the potential to upregulate viral replication and increases the risk of secondary bacterial infections. It is also clear that deficient innate immune responses exist in certain situations (e.g. inadequate interferon production or signalling) that might be amenable to targeted upregulation or exogenous supplementation.",

Many of the presentations during this workshop addressed studies in murine models, especially mouse strains with defined genetic defects. The extension of findings in such models to other species is a key point for further study. Clinical testing of candidate agents needs to rigorously assess clinical, virologic and immune measures, in part because of the safety issues raised by modulating immune responses. Placebo\u2010controlled studies of selected immunomodulators in uncomplicated influenza are now possible. These would provide useful information regarding possible effects on virology and immune responses but would be of uncertain value in predicting safety and efficacy in more severe disease states like influenza viral pneumonia.
