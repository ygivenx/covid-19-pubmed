The early phase of the disease appears to be due to the virus itself whereas the later phase is thought to be due to an inflammatory response. Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of nasopharyngeal aspirates has shown that the viral load peaks at about 10 days from symptom onset [1], and serum concentrations of IL-6, IL-8, IL-16 and tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 are most markedly raised 8\u201314 days from disease onset [2]. In addition, the histological changes in the lungs of patients who died from SARS suggest cytokine dysregulation [3]. Thus, the available data suggest that the clinical manifestations of SARS in the second week of illness are predominantly due to an excessive immune response to viral infection rather than to infection itself. Because admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) occurs 8\u20139 days after symptom onset and the median duration of ICU stay is 8.5\u201314.5 days [4-6], it is likely that most critically ill patients are in this immunological phase. Therefore, a logical approach is to modify the immune response with anti-inflammatory agents such as corticosteroids.",
