The etiologic agent was soon identified as a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV 1, 2. The plague ended in July 2003, with a death toll of more than 700 patients and 8 000 probable diagnoses [http://www.who.int/csr/sars/country/table2004_04_21/en/index.html]. This disease had a significant impact on international social and economic activities. In addition to the likely reemergence of SARS, there are serious concerns about its potential misuse as a biological weapon. Four years after its identification, however, many pathological aspects of this virus have yet to be characterized.",

In the latter mechanism, the endocytosed virions are subjected to an activation step in the endosome, which is typically mediated by the acidic endosomal pH, resulting in fusion of the viral and endosomal membranes and release of the viral genome into the cytosol. Therefore, the endocytic mechanism is thought to be a pH-sensitive process, while direct membrane fusion is pH-independent. The endocytic pathways exploited by animal viruses to gain entry into host cells include macropinocytosis, clathrin-dependent endocytosis, and caveolae-dependent endocytosis, as well as poorly characterized routes such as clathrin- and caveolae-independent endocytosis 3, 4. Although most viruses use only one of these pathways to enter cells, recent studies have shown that some viruses use multiple mechanisms to gain entry into host cells 5, 6, 7, 8.",

Some later studies have shown that entry of SARS-CoV may be pH-dependent 12, and that the endosomal protease cathepsin L 13, 14 might be involved, suggesting that this virus may employ endocytosis. Because conflicting results have been obtained by various research groups using similar experimental methods, such as fluorospectrometric monitoring of GFP-labeled pseudovirus entry into host cells, we decided to use a different approach. We labeled the SARS-CoV functional receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) with GFP by stable transfection of human embryonic kidney 293E (HEK293E) cells. Receptor recycling was then tracked after the cells were treated with pseudoviruses or the spike protein, a membrane component of SARS-CoV that mediates membrane fusion and is required for viral entry 11, 12. This new approach greatly improves experimental stability and reliability. The results showed that SARS-CoV entered cells via receptor-dependent, pH-sensitive endocytosis. We also showed that the specific endocytic pathway used by SARS-CoV to enter cells is clathrin- and caveolae-independent. Moreover, lipid rafts were found to play an important role in this process. Our results provide further insight into the pathological characteristics of this newly emerged virus.",

Purified recombinant spike protein fused to the human IgG Fc fragment (S1190-Fc) was added to 293E-ACE2-GFP cells. After incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 3 h, a number of GFP-containing vesicles were observed in the perinuclear area (Figure 1B), whereas vesicles were not observed in the control cells treated with Fc protein alone (Figure 1C), suggesting that spike protein specifically induced translocation of ACE2-GFP from the cell surface to the interior of the cells. Statistical analysis of the percentage of cells in which vesicles accumulated showed that there was a significant difference between the effects of these treatments on virus entry (Supplementary information Figure S2). A dual staining assay for spike protein and ACE2-GFP showed colocalization of these two proteins (Figure 1D), which suggests that spike protein was bound to ACE2 in the vesicles and that spike protein was taken up by the cell, most likely by endocytosis. The fact that spike protein induced translocation of ACE2 from the cell surface to intracellular compartments is in agreement with our previous finding that surface expression of ACE2 in Vero E6 cells decreased after incubation with spike protein at 37 \u00b0C for 3 h 16.",

This process can be blocked by lysosomotropic agents, which are reported to function by elevating the pH of acidic compartments, thereby inhibiting dissociation of the ligand from the receptor and trapping the receptor in the endosome 17. We found that after treatment with ammonium chloride, bafilomycin A1, or chloroquine, the viral receptor was trapped within perinuclear vacuoles, even after a 14-h incubation, a period that would allow the receptor to be recycled to the cell surface under normal conditions (Figure 1F and unpublished data). These results reflect the normal traffic of membrane flow; that is, cargos are first internalized by a besieged membrane, which fuses with the early endosome and then the late endosome, where cargos are dissociated from the receptors. Receptors are usually recycled back to the cell membrane, while cargos are targeted to lysosomes.",

Pseudoviruses are often used to mimic the entry of real viruses, such as hepatitis C virus 18, 19, Ebola virus, and Marburg virus 20, into host cells. This strategy is a powerful tool for studying early events in the life cycle of a virus. Therefore, we used retroviral pseudoviruses bearing the SARS-CoV spike protein to infect ACE2-GFP-expressing HEK293E cells. After a 3-h incubation at 37 \u00b0C, GFP-containing vesicles were detected within the cells (Figure 2A), while there were few intracellular vesicles when the same cell lines were treated with a control pseudovirus bearing VSV-G protein on the surface (Figure 2B). Dual labeling of spike protein and ACE2 also showed colocalization (Figure 2C), which indicates that the pseudovirus may be contained in the vesicles. After an additional 10 h incubation, few vesicles were observed (Figure 2D) for both treatments. This result was similar to that observed following treatment with spike protein alone. Moreover, after treatment with ammonium chloride, bafilomycin A1, or chloroquine, GFP-containing vesicles were detected, even after a 12-h incubation (Figure 2E and unpublished data), suggesting that these reagents inhibited receptor recycling. These results were nearly identical to those obtained following spike protein treatment, which indicated that SARS-CoV may enter cells via endocytosis. Although the pseudovirus can express GFP, the green vesicles observed in these cells at this time point resulted from cellular ACE2-GFP rather than from virally expressed GFP, as expression from the viral GFP gene was not observed at 12 h after infection. This notion was verified with ACE2-Myc-expressing HEK293E cells, in which no GFP expression was observed at 12 h postinfection with the pseudovirus (Supplementary information Figure S3).",

The effect of CPZ on clathrin-mediated endocytosis was first tested with transferrin labeled with Alexa 594 (Alexa 594 Tf) using Vero E6 cells. In mock-treated cells, transferrin appeared to cluster in the perinuclear region, while in the CPZ-treated cells, transferrin uptake was blocked, leaving transferrin at the cell surface (Figure 3A and 3B). This result confirms the effectiveness of CPZ. We then tested the effect of CPZ on spike-pseudovirus entry using two different methods: confocal microscopy and spectrofluorometer measurement. After Vero E6 cells were treated with CPZ and incubated with spike-bearing pseudoviruses for 1 h, the ability of spike-bearing pseudovirus to enter Vero E6 cells was examined using confocal microscopy. Figure 3C and 3D showed that the spike-bearing pseudovirus can enter Vero E6 cells despite CPZ treatment. In order to quantify the effect of CPZ on viral entry, Vero E6 cells were treated with the indicated amounts of CPZ and were then infected with spike-bearing pseudoviruses. The relative infectivity of the viruses was determined by measuring the level of GFP expression at 60 h postinfection using a spectrofluorometer.

Caveolae are small, flask-shaped invaginations in the plasma membrane composed of high levels of cholesterol and glycosphingolipids as well as the integral membrane protein caveolin 27. Because cholesterol is a prominent component of lipid rafts, which are involved in caveolae formation, sequestration of cholesterol with the sterol-binding drugs filipin and nystatin impairs caveolae-mediated endocytosis 4. To determine whether SARS-CoV enters cells through a caveolae-mediated pathway, we treated cells with filipin and nystatin. As a control, the effects of these drugs on caveolae-mediated endocytosis were examined by measuring the uptake of cholera toxin subunit B (CTB), since it is targeted to caveolae and its uptake can be blocked by these kinds of drugs 28, 29. Data presented in Figure 5A-C indicate that these drugs block CTB uptake, since Alexa-594 CTB clustered at the cell surface following drug treatment, compared to its concentration near the nucleus in mock-treated cells (Supplementary information Figure S4). When treated cells were infected with pseudovirus, virus entry was not inhibited by treatment with filipin or nystatin (Figure 5D and 5F), but was inhibited by another drug, methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (M\u03b2CD) (Figure 5E), an oligosaccharide used to deplete cholesterol from cell membranes. The effects of these drugs on virus entry were measured quantitatively. Treatment of Vero E6 cells with M\u03b2CD was shown to inhibit pseudovirus entry in a dose-dependent manner (Figure. 5H), while filipin and nystatin had no inhibitory effect on virus entry (Figure 5G and 5I).",

Caveolae-mediated endocytosis can be disrupted by drugs that sequester cholesterol from the plasma membrane. In order to define the role of caveolae-mediated endocytosis in SARS-CoV entry, we used several drugs that affect this pathway, such as nystatin, filipin, and M\u03b2CD. In our experiments, neither nystatin nor filipin inhibited virus entry, while M\u03b2CD was able to block virus entry in a dose-dependent manner, which was in agreement with a previous report by Li et al.\n32. These results, together with the fact that dual immunostaining showed that SARS-CoV and caveolin-1 did not colocalize, suggest that depletion of cholesterol by M\u03b2CD inhibits SARS-CoV entry, not through interfering with caveolae-mediated endocytosis per se but most likely by altering the integrity of membrane lipid microdomains. Therefore, these results suggest that caveolae-mediated endocytosis is not involved in the entry of SARS-CoV. This finding is in agreement with the fact that SARS-CoV can infect the colon carcinoma cell line Caco-2 33, 34, which is devoid of caveolin-1 35.",

A wide variety of viruses have been reported to use macropinocytosis to gain entry into host cells, because macropinosomes can be acidified and intersect with endocytic vesicles 4. The process of macropinocytosis requires actin; therefore, the most commonly used inhibitor of macropinocytosis is cytochalasin D. We found that treatment of Vero E6 cells with cytochalasin D slightly inhibited viral infection (Supplementary information Figure S5). However, macropinocytosis is unlikely to be the main pathway of entry for SARS-CoV, since SARS-CoV pseudoviruses induced receptor translocation from the cell surface to intracellular compartments, and macropinocytosis is not dependent on a receptor.",

This observation can be explained by the complicated conformational changes that occur during virus entry. For example, in the case of HIV-1, after virus binding to CD4, the CD4-HIV-1 complex may either leave the raft compartment in order to associate with CXCR4 outside of rafts or stimulate entry of CXCR4 into rafts. A similar scenario may exist for SARS-CoV. Although ACE2 does not directly localize in rafts, some unknown factors involved in virus entry may localize to lipid rafts. Further detailed experiments are necessary to determine whether host factors other than ACE2 are involved in virus entry, and, if so, whether they localize to lipid rafts and how they interact with ACE2 to facilitate virus entry.",
