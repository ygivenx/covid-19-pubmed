All diseases might be considered as disturbances in one or more of these equilibria. The balance between protein production and degradation is one of these equlibria, which are crucial to health. Degradation of proteins is brought about by proteolytic enzymes, proteases, which based on their catalytic mechanisms can be sorted into four major classes; the serine, cysteine, aspartic and metallo-proteases.",

The action of these proteolytic enzymes is biologically controlled by proteinase inhibitors. Cystatins constitute a powerful regulatory system for endogenous cysteine proteinases which are often secreted or leaking from the lysosomes of dying or diseased cells. Cystatins are proteins that tightly bind and inhibit the harmful effect of cysteine proteinases (Ekiel et al. 1997). These proteins are all related by structure and function to an inhibitor of cysteine proteinases which was first described in egg white and called as chicken egg white cystatins. Cystatins have been evolutionary related forming the \u201cCystatin Superfamily\u201d. The members of a protein superfamily were grouped into three families on the basis of their location, size and complexity of polypeptide chains (Barrett et al. (1986a, b).",

They contain additional disulfide bonds and are also glycosylated. Cystatins have an important regulatory role in normal body processes involving cysteine proteinase activity. Because these cysteine proteinases exist in all living organisms and because they are involved in various biological and pathological processes the control of their protease function by cystatins is of cardinal importance. An increasing attention is being paid to the physiological significance of these natural inhibitors in pathological processes. The reason for this growing interest is that uncontrolled proteolysis can lead to irreversible damage and detrimentally affect human health by facilitating diseases. This review focuses on the possible role of cystatins, natural and specific inhibitors of cysteine proteinases in pathological processes.",

Cystatin C levels did not correlate with gestational age and did not differ between males and females. Fetal cystatin C serum levels are lower in the IUGR group, significantly decrease after birth and do not correlate with maternal levels in both groups.

The disease was previously linked to human chromosome 21 q 22.3.

The protein coded by this gene was named cystatin like metastasis-associated protein (CMAP) and showed 22.1\u201328.1% homology to human family 2 cystatins. CMAP mRNA was selectively expressed in all murine liver metastatic tumors but not in any pulmonary metastatic tumors examined. Transfection of CMAP antisense DNA into highly metastatic liver cells greatly decreased their metastasis potential and CMAP expression indicating that CMAP is involved in liver metastatic ability after intravastion of malignant cells (Masashi et al. 1999).",
