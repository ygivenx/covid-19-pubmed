It has faced lots of achievements as well as setbacks in its journey through history, but the revolution of knowledge that happened after the renaissance (15th century) and the public health initiatives thereafter, shaped the modern philosophy of health. The World Health Organization's (WHO) definition of health added much to the concept.[1] As wellbeing is closely linked to the development sectors conventionally considered outside the purview of health,[2] the new definition of Health broadens to include health and development. Now it has entered the post modern era influenced much by the economic reforms and globalization. Eradication of smallpox by an international campaign (1977) and massive achievements in the control of communicable diseases had kindled lot of hope regarding the future of health.[345]",

            "text": "The acceptance of the principle of Primary Health Care (PHC) by the WHO has spearheaded many activities towards achieving its goal of Health For All (HFA) by 2000 A.D.[6] Although the member countries of WHO formulated their health policies according to the broad vision of HFA 2000, the campaign was not successful in bridging the huge health gap across the world.[7] The United Nation's Millennium Development Goals (MDG), was introduced as a philosophical successor of WHO's HFA by 2000 A.D. MDG envisaged the overall development as the outcome of improvements in health, education, poverty eradication, gender equity, environmental sustainability, and international co-operation. Health sector does not have independent existence. It is closely related to other sectors like education and agriculture. Interestingly, the commission on social determinants of health by the international health organization explained how the health of individuals and communities are affected by inputs from other developmental sectors.[8] Ill health can be tackled effectively only if social determinants are addressed to. Diseases are distally determined by certain social factors and poor health in turn leads to unfavorable social conditions. This acts as a vicious cycle and, therefore, the development of other related sectors becomes inevitable for improvements in health of a community. Poverty is a social evil closely related to ill health across the world, more evident in the under developed nations. The modern epidemic of Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome (HIV-AIDS) is a striking example of this mechanism. Some studies conducted in Africa give evidence to suggest that the poorer sections of the population have a much higher risk of contracting HIV than the non poor community,[9] and there are other studies from the same region which describes the devastating effects of HIV on the socioeconomic conditions.[10] This mechanism has played a definite role in blowing up the disease burden into epidemic proportions. The situation in Scandinavian countries and Sri Lanka[11] set a positive example where the better health nurtured by the society had given its toll on overall social development. But the challenges faced now in the sector of global health are much more complex. Visualizing a direct linear relation between social development and the health of the community has become obsolete. The relation between community and health is largely altered by the time, place, and personal situations. The complexities of culture and customs, economic situations, geography, ethnicity, and political situations make the challenges related to public health specific for every nation. WHO along with all those interested in the well being of humanity is revisiting the concept of PHC and reaffirming their solidarity to this philosophy. This is the background of the comprehensive outlook of PHC that has appeared in the World Health Report of 2008 [Table 1]. The policy argued that the initiatives of primary healthcare could not be considered cheap because, the philosophy need much resources from the community other than the money to initiate and sustain the activity.",

Transformations are more complex in middle income countries where the social inequalities are deep. Infectious diseases have lost their previous predominance but still maintain a major position in the epidemiologic profile. At the same time absolute and relative importance of non-communicable diseases and injuries has increased. Another important attribute of the transition is that it is not always unidirectional from communicable diseases to non-communicable disease. A reversal of trend known as \u201ccounter transition\u201d is occurring in some areas e.g. AIDS, TB, and Arboviral diseases. Some of the transition-related health issues are discussed below.",

After pneumonia and diarrheal diseases, HIV/AIDS has emerged as the most common cause of mortality in the third world nations.[32] It has become one of the leading causes of mortality among adults aged 15-59 years.[29] The development of drug resistance has emerged as a huge challenge for HIV and Tuberculosis (TB). The emergence of HIV-AIDS had made the burden of TB more intense and complicated. Resistance to conventional anti-TB drugs is well-documented, but the emergence of resistance to the second line drugs, the extensively drug resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB)[333435] and totally resistant Tuberculosis (TDR-TB),[363738] which is considered to be virtually untreatable, has added much burden to the already challenging scenario. The statistics available in the WHO's regional data strongly indicate the existing health gap between countries [Table 4].[39] Malaria is another major problem to which half of the world population is at risk and it causes about 3,000 deaths every day. The deaths are mostly caused by a single species, Plasmodium falciparum. The burden of Malaria is accentuated by the increasing drug resistance and insecticide resistance. Recent data indicate that there are countries where death rate due to Malaria is as high as 2.4 per 1,000,[39] which is comparable to the overall death rate of some developed countries. The deaths due to Malaria is highest in African region with a median of 94 per 100,000 population.[39]",

Economic issues and provision in healthcare was always a concern in India where the public investment in health care, social assistance, and risk pooling are often meagre or made available only for a minority and the major share of healthcare expenditure is still out of pocket.[51] The provision from the central government was below one percentage of gross domestic product until recently.

The provisions of basic facilities like institutional deliveries, attended by trained personnel have not been made widely available across the nation. As the practice of people in India is greatly governed by local beliefs and traditions, certain concepts like child birth in an institution still remains alien for a rural woman and her family (lack of acceptability). Coupled with ignorance, these acceptability issues lead to many unethical practices especially among the backward communities which are hazardous to health. The skewed distribution of the PHCs in rural areas along with poor transportation facilities leaves the needs of rural people unattended (lack of accessibility). The utilization of service is again limited by external factors. For example, the PHCs in most areas do not work round the clock and are not utilizable for the public in times of real need.",

The country has widely adopted a system, which utilizes the services of multipurpose workers to deliver majority of the services.[52] The leadership in community health activities in rural seldom involves a doctor due to their scarcity. In this context, it is paradoxical that this country exports many of its health professionals to European and American nations. The regrettable fact is that this second most populous country in the world even finds it difficult to get trained multipurpose workers to serve in the field. International agencies like world bank have a definite role in identifying and accumulating resources in India whose health predict the global health because of the massive nature of its population. The role of each state inside the federal democratic system of India is crucial but often less discussed. As health, according to the constitution of India is a state subject, it is the primary responsibility of the state government to see the wellbeing of its public. The responsibility the individual states are not carried out satisfactorily at least in certain areas as evidenced by huge disparity of health indicators across the states. Decentralized planning which is implemented in India should help to generate local resources including human power. In short, the lack of resources in health could be tackled in four levels such as village level, state level, national level, and international level. However, the priority should be given to the lowest strata as what is envisaged in primary health care concept.",
