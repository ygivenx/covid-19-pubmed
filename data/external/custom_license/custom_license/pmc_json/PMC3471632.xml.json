Prolonged detection episodes and high viral copy numbers in respiratory specimens were also observed. However, we did not observe many associations with acute respiratory symptoms. We found that detection of a respiratory virus was a risk factor for KIPyV detection and that concurrent detection of the polyomaviruses and respiratory viruses was common. Although it has been suggested that KIPyV and WUPyV might be major pathogens in immunosuppressed patients, we did not find a clear role for these viruses as respiratory pathogens with classic upper and lower respiratory tract symptoms. At this time, we do not recommend routine testing for these viruses in immunocompromised patients or inclusion in multiplexed respiratory virus PCR panels. Further investigations examining other specimen types, such as BAL, blood, and urine, from a larger patient cohort over a longer period of time may be necessary to elucidate the role of these viruses in highly immunocompromised patients.",
