If the epidemic worsens, an avian pandemic may occur, and countries with big poultry industries, such as Mexico and Brazil, could potentially be encumbered with culls of equal of even greater magnitude.",

It would also avoid the necessity for 'hysterical' attempts to slaughter massive numbers of uninfected animals as a last ditch effort to halt an outbreak. These animals, whether chickens, ducks or pigs, have lives too, and almost no religion on earth would condone such massacres of living organisms on such a scale, especially with the availability of preventative measures. Besides, culling all suspected animals may not be a good approach for preventing avian flu, as evident from the resurgence of the disease in early January after a cull of 1.8 million chickens and ducks in South Korea.",

In contrast to time-consuming conventional means of pathogen detection, such as microbial culture or antibody testing, molecular diagnostics enable mass screening at high speed. Indeed, success of viral culture depends on the presence of infectious viral particles in the samples, and antibody-based detection methods often lack sensitivity and specificity. Therefore, we should be using new-generation detection methods based on nucleic acid sequence based amplification (NASBA) or PCR to deal with disease outbreaks in this new century. To this end, our laboratories are working to develop expeditious molecular diagnostic methods for detecting avian flu of H1 to H15, H5, H7 subtypes2,3,4. Our bird flu virus detection systems are all validated by actual field tests, using samples collected from infected birds found in Hong Kong and other parts of the world.",

To avoid tragedies similar to the SARS outbreak, we cannot overemphasize the necessity of a sensitive and effective avian flu virus detection system.",
