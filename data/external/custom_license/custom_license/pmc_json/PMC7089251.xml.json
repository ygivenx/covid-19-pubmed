Some neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) have already been developed to treat disorders such as anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Traggiai et al. 2004) and anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (Mehandru et al. 2004; Ferrantelli et al. 2004). A recent development in immunodiagnosis of human disease has been the introduction of molecular recombination techniques leading to the emergence of new analytic approaches based on the essential properties of the single-chain variable fragment (ScFv) (Hafner et al. 2000), or the selection of a relevant recombinant antibody with the use of ScFv phage-display libraries (McCafferty et al. 1990; Clackson et al. 1991; Tanaka and Rabbitts 2009; Pansri et al. 2009) and the production of the recombinant antibodies using different expression systems (Pollock et al. 1999; Yang et al. 2005). The long-term goal of our laboratory is to characterize the Ab repertoire generated against the Hantaan virus following construction of an immune phage ScFv library.",

Investigators have tried to devise an universal primer or set of primers for amplifying all possible human V genes (Welschof et al. 1995; McCafferty and Johnson 1996; Sblattero and Bradbury 1998). The primers reported in these studies were designed based on the human Ig sequence data available at the time these primers were devised. This raises the question whether these primers still cover all known genes adequately. One research group has attempted to overcome the shortcomings of this earlier research by using a set of different V-gene specific primers in combination with Ig-class specific reverse primers (Lim et al. 2010). However, Lim\u2019s study did not design primers for building ScFv directly.",

A good coverage of V genes is desirable when generating antibody libraries for phage display to ensure the retrieval of diverse set of binding antibodies during selection. Because the 400 bp length of an antibody V gene has approximately 108 variations, amplifying a Fv is more complicated than an unknown gene in other gene families. To amplify the VH genes of Ig cDNAs from PBMCs, we first had to design primers of relatively low degeneracy to realize the natural benefits of a degenerate primer to cover every family sequence and minimize the number of primers. To accomplish this, we focused on selecting conserved regions of the V genes and the degeneracy of primers.",

            "text": "Although there are several other publicly available tools for designing degenerate primers, iCODEHOP is the only tool that contributes to designing primers with the consensus-degenerate hybrid format. It is also one of only a few programs that design primers from amino acid multiple alignments. Several existing systems, including SCPrimer (Jabado et al. 2006), Amplicon (Jarman 2004), and HYDEN (Linhart and Shamir 2005) design degenerate primers entirely from nucleic acid multiple alignments. This approach is profitable when nucleotide information is available and avoids the problem of back-translating amino acid sequences. However, it is sometimes impossible to recognize conserved regions among the many nucleotide sequences that can encode a protein family of interest, even when conservation is visible at the amino acid level. To the best of our knowledge, GeneFisher (Giegerich et al. 1996; Lamprecht et al. 2008) is the only other publicly available web application besides iCODEHOP that both designs degenerate primers from amino acid sequences and generates degenerate primers that have been verified in laboratory experiments. GeneFisher2 appears to allow degenerate positions at any position along the primers it produces. In contrast, the CODEHOPs created by iCODEHOP have degenerate positions only within 11\u201312 bases at their 3\u2032 end. The remaining positions of a CODEHOP are derived from the input amino acid multiple alignment by determining the most common codons of the consensus amino acids created from the alignment. As discussed above, we selected iCODEHOP to design degenerate primers for Ig VH genes.",

Under certain conditions, iCODEHOP is incapable of designing primers for a particular protein multiple alignment because conservation is too poor among the selected sequences for the program to detect primers that satisfy degeneracy and clamp length constraints. We used two methods of alignment to find the more conserved region. The first method was to use all human Ig gene sequences in all families defined by IMGT aligned as one group. However, the conserved region was not found, so we abandoned this alignment approach. The second method we tried was to take all human Ig gene sequences listed and align them within each family. This way, we selected the optimal region, which was in the begin or in the middle of the VH FR1. Based on this alignment, the number of primers designed by our program at the 5\u2032 end of the VH region was 7, less than the number of primers designed by other authors. For 3\u2032 primer design, known FR4 sequences are normally chosen as the target sequences. The JH genes retrieved from IMGT databases were 13, so we appreciated designing degenerate primers manually.",

However, the primers were not family-specific because the human V genes showed intra- and inter-family sequence variability, and they were somatically rearranged in a way that generated nearly limitless Ab diversity. Additionally, somatic hypermutation events that coincide with the primer binding sites can potentially affect the amplification efficiency. Therefore, some primers matched more than one V gene family and some V genes were matched by more than one primer.",
