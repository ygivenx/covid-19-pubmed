Natural product-based drug discovery research programs represent important avenues for drug development13, including anti-viral drugs14,15. For example, emodin (1,3,8-tri-hydroxy-6-methylanthraquinone) is an active ingredient sourced from herbs belonging to genera Rheum, Polygonum, Rhamnus and Senna. Extracts from these herbs have been used for the treatment of epidemic-prone diseases16.

MRC5 are human lung fibroblast cells. Although EV71 infection mainly leads to central nervous system symptoms, the lungs can also be infected by the EV71 virus in vivo24, meaning that MRC5 cells can be used as a cell model. The cell inhibitory ratio was detected via MTT analysis at 48 h post-treatment. After 48 h of treatment with 0, 13.69, 27.38, 54.77, 82.15, 109.53, and 136.92 \u03bcmol/L of Rheum emodin, the concentrations with inhibitory ratios below 10% ranged from 0 to 82.15 \u03bcmol/L (Figure 1A). After 0, 1, 5, 25, 50, 75, and 85 \u03bcmol/L of Artemisinin or Astragaloside treatment for 48 h, the concentrations of Artemisinin with inhibitory ratios below 10% ranged from 0 to 75 \u03bcmol/L (Figure 1B) and the concentration of Astragaloside with inhibitory ratios below 10% ranged from 0 to 85 \u03bcmol/L (Figure 1C). Therefore, the range of concentrations for Rheum emodin (0 to 82.15 \u03bcmol/L), Artemisinin (0 to 75 \u03bcmol/L) and Astragaloside (0 to 85 \u03bcmol/L) did not affect cell survival. Based on the results of both a published study25,26,27 and our MTT assay, we chose the following concentrations for further study: 29.60 \u03bcmol/L of Rheum emodin, 50 \u03bcmol/L of Artemisinin or 50 \u03bcmol/L of Astragaloside for anti-EV71 activity.

While Rheum emodin treatment (Figure 2B2) inhibited cell morphologic changes including being rounded up and detached from the bottom of the dish due to EV71 infection, Artemisinin (Figure 2B3) and Astragaloside (Figure 2B4) did not. Nuclear staining tests were also completed to confirm the effects of Rheum emodin, Artemisinin and Astragaloside on cell death. After the EV71-infected cell nuclei became condensed and bright (Figure 2C1), which indicated cell death, Rheum emodin treatment inhibited the appearance of condensed and bright nuclei induced by EV71 infection (Figure 2C2), while neither Artemisinin (Figure 2C3) nor Astragaloside inhibited cell death induced by EV71 infection (Figure 2C4). Therefore, Rheum emodin possessed the ability to protect host cells from EV71 viral damage, while Artemisinin or Astragaloside were unable to achieve the same results.",

Therefore, we examined whether the effects of emodin were mediated by interfering with the cell cycle environment favored by the EV71 virus in this study. Cell cycle profiles were determined via flow cytometry after drug treatment or EV71 infection (Figure 5A). At 24-h post-infection, an obvious accumulation in S phase was observed by the ModFit analysis in EV71-infected cells, with an increase from 31.15%\u00b11.25% to 50.74%\u00b11.13% (increase of 62.89%, P<0.01) compared to the mock-treated cells. After Rheum emodin treatment, there was a decrease in S phase from 50.74%\u00b11.13% to 28.31%\u00b11.16% compared to the mock-treated cells (P<0.01) after EV71 infection (Figure 5B). Artemisinin treatment decreased S phase from 54.08%\u00b11.24% to 47.65%\u00b10.23% (P<0.01) after EV71 infection (Figure 5D); Astragaloside treatment also induced a decrease from 50.74%\u00b11.13% to 46.01%\u00b11.16% (P<0.01) post-EV71 infection (Figure 5F). To further emphasize the effects of Rheum emodin, Artemisinin and Astragaloside treatment on S phase in EV71-infected cells, we analyzed the percentage of S phase cells after EV71 infection. The percentage of S phase cells after Rheum emodin treatment was 55.78% of that observed in the mock-treated cells (Figure 5C). The corresponding S phase percentages in the Astragaloside- and Artemisinin-treated cells were 90.68% (Figure 5E) and 88.11% of mock-treated cells (Figure 5G), respectively. Thus, our findings suggest that Rheum emodin inhibits the S-phase accumulation induced by EV71 infection.",

Our results clearly indicate that Rheum emodin decreased the levels of viral genomic level, viral protein expression, and EV71 virulence compared to the control-treated group. Therefore, Rheum emodin inhibits cell death by inhibiting viral production. The fold difference in the TCID50/mL, mRNA levels, and protein expression between the control-treated and Rheum emodin-treated cells is 1.33\u00d7107, 6.34, and less than 30, respectively, indicating that while Rheum emodin inhibits viral gene replication and viral expression, it mainly inhibits maturation, which is the final step for viral assembly. Rheum emodin also suppressed viral replication for 36 h. Similar anti-EV71 effects were not observed for either Artemisinin or Astragaloside. It should be noted from practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine that the three natural products Rheum emodin, Artemisinin, and Astragaloside were extracted from Chinese rhubarb (also from Polygonum cuspidatum Sieb.et Zucc; Rumex patientia Linn; Fagopyrum dibotrys (D Don) Hara; Rumex japonicus Houtt; Fallopia multiflora (Thunb) Harald), Artemisia carvifolia and Astragalus, respectively.

It was therefore concluded that Rheum emodin inhibited EV71 viral replication by intervening in the cell cycle environment favored by the virus.
