Using PCR-based methods, we excluded the following as causative agent: mink enteritis virus, canine distemper virus, Aleutian mink disease virus, mink orthoreovirus, and mink coronavirus. To identify the causative agent, we separately homogenized fecal, liver, and gut samples from diseased unvaccinated mink in phosphate-buffered saline and then submitted the supernatants to negative staining and observation under an electron microscope. We found circovirus-like particles, but not in typical lattice arrangement, in liver and gut samples. We performed PCRs with degenerate primers (CV-F1, CV-R1, CV-F2, and CV-R2; Table 1) based on highly conserved amino acid motifs in the Rep proteins of circoviruses and cycloviruses. Products of \u2248400 bp were purified and sequenced by using primer CV-R2. ",

The product was sequenced in duplicate. The complete circular genome of MiCV-DL13 contained 1,753 nt (GenBank accession no. KJ020099); highest similarity was 64.1% with the genome of BtCV-XOR.

In this study, the novel circovirus, MiCV, was identified in liver and digestive tract samples from mink with diarrhea. No MiCV DNA was found in any healthy mink, thereby indicating a strong relationship between the isolated virus and disease. Whether other mustelids (e.g., weasels, badgers, and ferrets) or even humans in close contact with infected mink are susceptible to this virus merits further study.",
