            "text": "Measurement of lung volume has always been a concern in patients receiving mechanical ventilation (MV), and complex methods have been proposed for clinical investigation. Patroniti et al. [1] described a simplified helium dilution technique to measure end-expiratory lung volume and compared it to computed tomography (CT) in 21 MV patients. The authors specifically studied the accuracy and precision of the method. A simple rebreathing gas was used to deliver at least ten usual tidal volumes. The agreement between the two methods was found very acceptable for clinical purposes. It was noted, however, that the higher the amount of hyperinflated tissue, the greater was the underestimation of lung volume by the helium dilution method. It has been well demonstrated that a frequent cause of repeated lung volume loss is endotracheal suctioning. This can induce derecruitment in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The effects of such maneuver were tested in ten patients with only mild to moderate lung failure by Fernandez et al. [2]. Three techniques were compared with or without preoxygenation. The authors found that reduction in lung volume during suctioning was similar with the quasiclosed and closed systems but significantly higher with the open system. They also observed that in these patients without severe lung disease these changes were transient and rapidly reversible within 10 min.",

            "text": "Measurement of respiratory mechanics usually describes the respiratory system in terms of elastance, compliance and time constant. In an elegant study, Kondili et al. [4] divided tidal expiration in different phases based on the analysis of expiratory flow-volume curves in ten patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). They showed that the end of expiration is characterized by a lengthening of time constants, and that the addition of external positive end-expiratory pressure decreases resistance at the end of expiration and shortens time constants, thus facilitating equilibration between the external pressure and the alveolar pressure. Although we already knew the effects of external positive end-expiratory pressure in such patients, this new method of exploration sheds new light on its mechanisms. A part of expiratory resistances can be caused by the endotracheal tube itself. In many cases its contribution is not huge. However, more and more studies suggest that over the course of MV the inner diameter of the tube may progressively decrease due to the permanent deposits of secretions. Using the acoustic reflectometry method Boqu\u00e9 et al. [5] prospectively assessed the inner volume reduction of 94 endotracheal tubes, used in 80 patients, and found this reduction to be extremely frequent. In almost one-fourth of the patients the real diameter of the tube was smaller than 7 mm. The clinical implications of such findings may be important, and further studies are needed on this topic.",

It is thus the great merit of this multicenter collaborative 1-day prevalence study by Malbrain et al. [6] in 13 ICUs of six countries to evaluate its frequency in a cohort of 97 patients. Based on a definition of abnormal intra-abdominal pressure of 12 mmHg or higher, its prevalence was 50%, while 8% of the patients had abdominal compartment syndrome with a pressure of 20 mmHg or higher. The only risk factor was the body mass index, while the effects of massive fluid resuscitation and renal and coagulation impairment were at the limit of statistical significance.",

They tried to identify all contributing factors, of which 46% were system-based and the others were human-based. In 31% of the incidents there were significant adverse outcomes. A number of factors were also identified as having prevented or limited harm. These problems are often underestimated or underreported and deserve great attention.

            "text": "Epidemiological characteristics and outcomes from acute lung injury (ALI) vary across studies. This variability depends on definitions, subpopulations included in studies, comorbidities, and the severity of the disease per se. Brun-Buisson and coworkers [9] studied the current occurrence and causes of ALI and ARDS, the relationships and respective outcome of mild ALI (PaO22/FIO2 between 200 and 300 mmHg) and ARDS (PaO2/FIO2 equal to or below 200 mmHg), and the factors associated with survival. A 2-month inception cohort (February\u2013March 1999) of 463 individuals with ALI among 6,522 patients who were admitted for at least 4 h in an intensive care unit (ICU) was scrutinized. Data pertain to ten European countries and 78 ICUs. Among 136 patients initially having mild ALI 74 (55%) went on to ARDS. There were 62 with mild ALI while 401 had ARDS. Crude ICU and hospital mortality rates were 22.6% and 32.7% (p<0.001) for mild ALI and 49.4% and 57.9% (p=0.0005) for ARDS. Initial mean tidal volume and positive end-expiratory pressure were 8.3\u00b11.9 ml/kg and 7.7\u00b13.6 cmH2O in ARDS patients. Air leaks were detected in 15.9% of subjects. In multivariate analysis mortality was associated with age, immunoincompetence, Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II, logistic organ dysfunction score, and early air leak. The authors concluded that ALI is frequent, that there is a continuum between ALI and ARDS, and that there is a substantial difference in mortality, being much higher in ARDS.

Ferguson and colleagues [12] analyzed the impact on enrollment in a trial of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation and the potential effects on study outcome when screened ARDS patients were placed on standard ventilator settings. These settings were pressure control ventilation to achieve a tidal volume 7\u20138 ml/kg predicted body weight ensuring peak inspiratory pressures below 35 cmH2O, FIO2 1 and positive end-expiratory pressure 10 cmH2O. Forty-one consecutive patients were included. After institution of standard settings, in 17 patients (41%) the PaO2/FIO2 was persistently below 200 mmHg and the remainder (24 patients, 59%) had a PaO2/FIO2 above 200 mmHg 30 min after the changes were implemented. The change in FIO2 was the main reason for these changes in PaO2/FIO2. The ICU mortality rate was significantly greater in those with persistent ARDS than in those with the transient form, 52.9% vs. 12.5% respectively (p=0.01). The authors concluded that their findings are important for trial design because of the observed differences in outcome, and proposed the use of standardized ventilator settings for patient enrollment.",

The aim was to investigate the incidence, causes, and outcome of ARDS in adult patients who were treated in the ICU for at least 24 h. A total of 5,320 admissions were registered during this period, and 108 patients (2%) were diagnosed as having an ARDS. The most common predisposing factors for ARDS were pneumonia (34%) and sepsis of nonpulmonary origin (31%). Twenty-seven patients were not intubated. In those who received invasive MV the most frequently used ventilatory mode was synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (32%). In hospital mortality rate for ARDS patients was 68.5%. The majority of ARDS patients who died (60%) did so because of multiple organ dysfunction, whereas 23% died because of refractory respiratory failure.

Their median Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score was 11 (interquartile range 8\u201313). At 28 days 34 patients (63%) were alive and not undergoing MV, 6 (11.3%) were receiving MV, and 14 had died (25.9%). Seven of 27 ventilated patients (25.9%) developed barotrauma despite a low tidal volume (mean tidal volume 7.7\u00b12.2 ml/kg predicted body weight) and low-pressure strategy (mean positive end-expiratory pressure 8.3\u00b12.5 cmH2O, and peak airway pressures of 25.6\u00b14.8 cmH2O in those who did not develop barotrauma and 26.5\u00b13.1 cmH2O in those who did not develop it). Variables associated with poor outcome on univariate analysis were age, severity of illness, lymphocyte count, decreased steroid dose, positive fluid balance, chronic disease or immunosuppresion, and nosocomial sepsis. The authors concluded that mortality is high for this syndrome, it causes severe respiratory failure with little organ failure, and there is a high incidence of barotrauma in those requiring MV.",

Traditional weaning indices are poor predictors of extubation outcomes. Data suggest that patients with neurological diagnoses, lack of adequate cough, and frequent endotracheal suctioning are at increased risk of extubation failure. Salam and coworkers [15] objectively assessed the impact of neurological status, cough strength, and volume of endotracheal secretions on extubation outcomes. In 88 patients who had passed a spontaneous breathing trial they measured cough peak flow, endotracheal secretions and ability to complete four simple tasks (open eyes, follow with eyes, grasp hand, and stick out tongue). Fourteen patients (15.9%) failed the first extubation. Patients with a cough peak flow equal to or below 60 l/min were more likely to fail extubation than those with a cough peak flow higher than 60 l/min [risk ratio (RR) 4.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.4\u201316.2]. Patients with secretions of more than 2.5 ml/h were more likely to fail than those with fewer secretions (RR 3, 95% CI 1\u20138.8). Patients unable to complete the tasks were more likely to fail than those who completed the commands (RR 4.3, 95% CI 1.8\u201310.4). The presence of any two of those risk factors had a sensitivity of 71% and specificity of 81% in predicting extubation failure. The authors concluded that these simple, inexpensive, and reproducible methods provide a useful clinical approach to guide the extubation process.

Multiple logistic regression indicated that patients with a low sedation level and higher degree of consciousness were at higher risk for deliberate self-extubation.

Seventeen patients of this latter group developed severe complications vs. only four of the CPAP group.

Mortality rate, duration of MV, and length of ICU and hospital stay did not differ between the two groups, but the NIV group had fewer complications and a tendency to be weaned earlier from ventilation. Intubation rate in the case group was 62%, but this subset of patients had similar outcomes as those of the control group. Those with successful NIV had lower mortality rate and shorter ICU and hospital stay than the patients who received intubation.

The pathogenesis of infection was confirmed by DNA typing of organisms. The overall CVC-related BSI rate was 5.9/1,000 catheter-days. In the pooled control groups of the two trials 25 CVC-related BSIs occurred (7.0 per 1,000 catheter-days), in 60% of which infections were extraluminally acquired, 12% intraluminally derived, and 28% indeterminate. In contrast, CVC-related BSIs in the treatment groups were most often intraluminally derived (60%, p=0.006). The authors concluded that most CVC-related BSIs were extraluminally acquired and derived from the cutaneous microflora. Therefore strategies achieving successful suppression of cutaneous colonization can substantially reduce the risk of CVC-related BSI associated with short-term CVCs.",

Hemodynamically stable patients without proven bacteremia, insertion site infection, or intravascular foreign body were randomized to a standard-of-care group (in which all CVCs were changed as planned) or the watchful waiting group (in which CVCs were changed only when bacteremia or hemodynamic instability subsequently occurred).

In an accompanying editorial, Brun-Buisson [35] emphasizes the value of this conservative approach in selected patients with low/moderate suspicion of CVC infection and comments on the potential value of additional tests (skin site insertion swab culture, paired blood culture) to assist the clinical decision making in this conservative approach.",

Pneumonia was diagnosed on positive cultures (\u2265 103 cfu/ml) of the latter. The authors reported a good correlation between the two techniques for identifying bacterial species and differentiating between positive and negative cultures of the plugged telescoping catheter by using a diagnostic threshold for ETA of 104 cfu/ml. They calculated a sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 85% for ETA. With the usual and widely used threshold of 106 cfu/ml for ETA, results were less good, with a poor agreement between the two techniques (\u03ba=0.48). The authors concluded that ETA quantitative cultures are adequate techniques to identify pathogenic organisms in significant concentration in the lower respiratory tract but not to diagnose VAP since quantitative cultures of the plugged telescoping catheter are not a \u201cgold standard\u201d and even not a \u201csilver standard\u201d to differentiate lung infection from heavy colonization of the lower respiratory tract.",

CPIS, which is no more than the quantification of a clinical evaluation, does indeed constitute significant progress, particularly when it is included in a management algorithm [47]. As indicated by Yu and Singh [46] in their editorial, the use of such an algorithm based on CPIS resulted in limiting the number and duration of antibiotics, reducing incidence of infections due to multiresistant bacteria, shortening duration of stay, and lowering 30-day mortality rate. It is therefore possible to reduce antibiotic use without deleterious consequences for MV-treated patients treated with clinical signs suggesting the development of VAP. Furthermore the authors clearly stated that excessive broad-spectrum therapy leads to greater emergence of multiply-resistant organisms and increases mortality and morbidity. Limiting the use of antibiotics in patients with CPIS lower than 6 is a very important first step of a \u201crevisited\u201d strategy. Yu and Singh reported important data concerning this strategy. During the 3 years following the implementation of the Singh protocol they had not experienced \u201ca single case of a patient with an invasive infection leading to death in a patient with CPIS <6 receiving 3 day monotherapy.\u201d Thus the relevant questions are: Is this patient developing VAP? Does the patient require antibiotics? To answer to these questions, it is possible to propose at least two new randomized trials: first, according to the authors, a comparison of a short-course monotherapy vs. no antibiotics in patients with low (<6) CPIS and, second, a comparison of the Singh protocol with a bacteriological strategy already evidenced as superior to the \u201cclassic\u201d clinical strategy [55].",

The authors concluded that cytokines and cytokine inhibitor production are compartmentalized in the lung of patients who develop VAP.",

            "text": "El-Solh et al. [63] evaluated the impact of inadequate antimicrobial therapy on procoagulant and fibrinolytic activity in 29 patients with bacteriologically confirmed VAP and 8 control patients treated with MV. Seven patients were not treated appropriately; thrombin-antithrombin complex, prothrombin activation fragment, and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 levels were higher than in those who received adequate treatment. Despite antibiotic adjustment on day 4 thrombin-antithrombin complex levels remained elevated and were correlated with P/F ratio. Such a procoagulant activity was accompanied by a local depression of fibrinolytic capacity. No correlation was found between the bacterial burden and the homeostatic derangements. The authors suggested that the lung inflammatory response in patients with inadequately treated VAP induces a local procoagulant activity associated with hypoxemia.",
