The prenatal form is divided into severe and mild subtypes, based on time of onset: before and after 35 weeks of gestation, respectively. The infantile form has an onset within the first 6 months of life and in the majority of cases resolves spontaneously by the age of 2 years.",

In several reports, researchers investigated familial cases and hypothesized that the pattern of inheritance might be autosomal dominant with incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity.3 In 2005, Gensure et al.4 confirmed the autosomal-dominant trait of ICH by performing a genome-wide analysis of three unrelated families presenting the disease. The researchers found a novel missense mutation in the COL1A1 gene on chromosome 17q21. This mutation is a 3040C>T transition, resulting in the substitution of the amino acid Arginine by Cysteine at position 836 (R836C) within the helical domain of the a1 chain of type 1 collagen. This finding places ICH within the group of type 1 collagen-related conditions, such as osteogenesis imperfecta and Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome.5 Following this report, patients with ICH expressing the COL1A1 mutation were reported worldwide,6\u201311 and even one lethal prenatal genetic case of ICH was described.12",

The amino-terminal domain D1 enables high affinity to calcium phosphate, forming soluble protein\u2013mineral complexes (\u201cmineral chaperones\u201d), thereby preventing pathological calcification at enriched mineral sites.28 In addition, fetuin-A functions as an antagonist to the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) superfamily of cytokines and in this manner controls tissue remodeling and inflammation in osteoblastic cells. Fetuin-A structure shares homology with the extracellular domain of TGF-\u03b2 receptor type II, allowing fetuin-A to bind directly to TGF-\u03b21 and TGF-\u03b22 and with greater affinity to TGF-\u03b2-related BMPs (BMP-2, BMP-4, and BMP-6) and limit cytokine activity.29 In vitro studies showed that, in cultures of rat bone marrow cells, fetuin-A binds to TGF-\u03b2 cytokines and suppresses dexamethasone osteogenesis.29,30",

Rittenberg et al.34 implanted human native BMP into hindquarter muscles of mice and showed that the ratio of cortical to cancellous bone was more than two-fold higher in Ahsg\u2212/\u2212 mice compared to WT and also presented higher incidence of immature bone islands (\u201csatellite ossification\u201d). Szweras et al.35 showed that mice lacking ASHG protein display growth plate defects, increased bone formation including cortical thickening, and enhanced cytokine-dependent osteogenesis. All these findings in mice highly point to a possible role of AHSG deficiency in the pathophysiology of Caffey disease, which is characterized by subperiosteal bone hyperplasia.",

These findings also support the theory that ICH can be inherited in an autosomal-recessive manner. Our discovery raises the possibility of potential treatments for ICH. For instance, in patients with pseudoxanthoma elasticum, a hereditary disease of ectopic mineralization in soft connective tissues caused by a known mutation in ABCC6 gene, circulatory fetuin-A was found to be reduced.38 Jiang et al.39 suggested that normalization of serum fetuin-A, either through gene therapy or by direct protein delivery to the circulation, can be used to treat the disease.

The novel stop codon mutation that we described causes zero production of fetuin-A. In other words, it is equivalent to knocking out the AHSG gene. Thus we consider this mutation to be the cause of ICH in our patient. We, therefore, propose that additional Caffey disease patients with non-COL1A1 defects will be assessed for fetuin-A deficiency. It can be argued that our patient might have a \u201cCaffey-like\u201d disease with manifestations imitating the classic infantile Caffey disease described in the literature.
