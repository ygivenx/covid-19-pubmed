Consequently, resources were centralized to maximize staff and patient throughput. With the advent of SARS, there is a need for decentralization of services and segregation of patients according to risk for nosocomial transmission of infection. As far as possible, procedures on SARS suspects should be performed at a designated isolation facility, preferably outside the main radiology department. Keeping possibly infectious patients out of the main radiology department will reduce the risk of transmission to attending staff, other patients or unsuspecting visitors of the department. Of the 206 cases of SARS in Singapore, 10 were radiology-related infections. Four involved staff members and the 6 remaining were either visitors or outpatients of the department. The segregation of patients with SARS to dedicated isolation facilities will also allow the main radiology department to continue providing services to other non-infected patients, restoring some semblance of efficiency.",

Although reassuring, the exclusion of aerosolization is a significant caveat. It is our practice to use PAPR when performing any procedures on SARS or SARS-suspect patients, in aerosol-generating procedures or if patients are expected to have significant respiratory symptoms (Table 1). It might seem excessive to extend the use of PAPR to include all patients subjected to aerosol-generating procedures.

Minor procedures were done in a designated procedure room located within a SARS intensive-care ward using a portable fluoroscopic C-arm unit (Opescope WHA50 C-arm, Shimadzu Medical Systems, Torrance, CA). Under normal circumstances, this room was used for cardiac pacing, being located in what was previously the coronary care unit. With minimal adaptation, the room was adequate for fluoroscopic-guided procedures including deployment of the IVC filter and retrieval of a lost guidewire. The other location where more complex fluoroscopic procedures could be performed was in a dedicated SARS operating theatre suite. A portable fluoroscopic C-arm unit (BV300, Philips Medical Systems, Best, Netherlands) capable of obtaining digital subtraction images was used. This theatre was primarily used for surgical operations and only the percutaneous biliary drainage and stenting was performed here.",

Workflows and patient scheduling will have to be completely reevaluated. Instead of merely trying to achieve a high turnover, the schedule will have to take into account segregation of more healthy outpatients and elective inpatients from the more ill inpatients. Spatial segregation if different facilities are available would be ideal, otherwise a temporal segregation with emphasis on traffic control, provision of holding areas and redesign of waiting areas would be a feasible alternative. The schedule should also take into account stratification of risks from the infection control viewpoint, so that febrile patients and abscess drainages should be performed at the end of the list or in a designated room.",

Even when SARS is subsequently controlled globally, we have to be prepared to confront the threat of other new emerging infections. In the true spirit of IR, we need to adapt, innovate and manage these issues so as to ensure the survival of our specialty. Habits are difficult to change and change is sometimes not welcome.
