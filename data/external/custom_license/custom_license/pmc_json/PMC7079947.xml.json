Although ROS function is a beneficial component of the immune response, unregulated and excessive ROS are toxic, inducing irreparable damage to the cellular membrane, proteins, and nucleic acids. Under normal physiologic conditions, antioxidant enzymes help to maintain the balance of ROS. This functional interaction has lead to interest in generating antioxidants as therapeutic agents for ROS-mediated injury and diseases.",

CAT works by catalyzing the decomposition of H2O2 into molecular oxygen and water (Lv et al. 2009; Ogbeyalu et al. 2009; Brian 2009). CAT plays an important role in the development of tolerance to oxidative stress. This process has been defined as protective against several pathological conditions, such as allergies (Yoshimaru et al. 2006), atherosclerosis (Kudchodkar et al. 2007), ischemia (Hanawa et al. 2009), chronic granulomatous (Yu et al. 2008), metastatic tumor progression (Nishikawa et al. 2009; Hyoudou et al. 2004), and aging (Brown-Borg and Rakoczy 2000). The potential of catalase as a therapeutic agent has been explored for many different diseases and in many different forms, including gene therapy (Guy et al. 1998) and recombinant catalase (Yabe et al. 1999), for well over a decade. In a previous study, we found that inhalation of native recombinant human catalase (rhCAT) elicited a protective effect in mice with influenza-associated pneumonia (Shi et al. 2010).",

Approximately four million of those cases end in death, accounting for 7 % of the total mortality worldwide. The recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus, avian influenza A (H5N1) virus, and the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus served to highlight respiratory viruses as important causative agents of severe pneumonia. Nonetheless, the current battery of antivirals available in clinical practice for the treatment of pneumonia is limited (Ruuskanen et al. 2011; Rudan et al. 2008). The continued pandemic threat of these circulating viruses makes identification and development of novel therapeutic strategies, especially for the treatment of influenza A, an urgent matter (Derek 2009).",

            "text": "Pneumonia and severe acute lung injuries often occur after infection with the H1N1 influenza virus. Virus invasion of the bronchi and/or alveoli in the lung destroys these structures, leading to a drastic reduction of the air space that is essential for oxygen/CO2 exchange (Hurt et al. 2004). The immune response to the virus manifests as increased vasodilation and leakage of leukocytes and neutrophils into the lung tissue, ultimately resulting in life-threatening pulmonary edema and congestion. Studies to identify the mechanisms underlying cell death associated with influenza-induced pneumonia have implicated ROS in promoting the extent of lung injury and respiration compromise (Gangehei et al. 2010; Case et al. 2011; Nakamura et al. 2002). Thus, it has been theorized that quenching ROS levels might be a promising strategy to alleviate the severity of viral pneumonia.",

The immune response rapidly exhausts the pool of available antioxidants, as evidenced by low levels of CAT and SOD during the immediate-early stages of severe pathogenic infection. Augmenting the natural antioxidant pool with recombinant CAT can promote the system's ability to eliminate excessive ROS and help to restore redox balance. Indeed, intranasal administration of PEG-rhCAT helped to resolve the influenza-induced perturbations of MDA, CAT, SOD, and TAS in mice with viral pneumonia. In this manner, we presume that PEG-rhCAT therapy may down-regulate ROS, thereby helping to alleviate the destruction of lung tissues and promote survival.",

            "text": "Second, influenza invasion is known to frequently stimulate an excessive immune response, which is accompanied by a robust infiltration of inflammation-related cells, such as monocytes, to the site of infection. The persistent release of inflammatory factors causes significant damage to the underlying tissue and can compromise pulmonary function. In conditions of excessive amounts of ROS, the macrophage-expressed CD200 signaling molecule is activated. Activated CD200 induces expression of several chemokines and proinflammatory cytokines, which in turn recruit peripheral inflammation-related cells to the virus-infected organ (Snelgrove et al. 2006; Rosenblum et al. 2004). By augmenting the antioxidant pool with recombinant CAT, the excessive ROS may be eliminated, thereby helping to quell macrophage-mediated processes, such as apoptosis. The rhCAT-mediated clearance of ROS may also help to halt the massive influx of immunomodulatory cells, as was observed in our histopathological analyses of pulmonary tissue from PEG-rhCAT-treated mice with influenza pneumonia.",

            "text": "Third, virus clearance is initiated by the innate immune system but is dependent upon adaptive immune processes for completion. ROS-mediated tissue injury during severe infections disrupts normal T cell development, thereby impairing adaptive immune responses and inhibiting clearance of an influenza infection (Case et al. 2011; Imai et al. 2008). In our study, untreated mice with influenza pneumonia presented with atrophied thymus and spleen on day 4 post-infection (data not shown). The structural destruction of immune organs had functional consequences on the immune system, impairing maturity of the adaptive immune T cells, and presumably hindering effective virus clearance. Therapeutic administration of rhCAT, however, lowered the viral load, possibly as a result of excessive ROS elimination, which would have decreased destruction of immune-related organs and helped to restore the specific adaptive immune response.",
