Healthcare personnel were disproportionately affected, accounting for up to 57% of cases in some countries. The combination of increasing infectivity in the later stages of SARS, performance of the aerosol-generating procedures (bronchoscopy, intubation), and clustering of SARS patients further enhanced transmission of the SARS-associated coronavirus.",

Worldwide, unsafe injections alone are estimated to cause 21,000 cases of hepatitis B, 2,000 cases of hepatitis C, and 260 cases of HIV each year. Countries with limited resources are at a disproportionate risk for adverse injection-related outcomes. While lack of sterile supplies is important, unnecessary injections and poor understanding of infection control principles and practices also contribute to the spread of bloodborne viruses. These last two factors are not unique to the developing world. Four recent outbreaks of hepatitis B and C viruses in patients in ambulatory care facilities in the United States are a reminder that unsafe injections can occur in any healthcare setting. In these outbreaks, a lack of administrative oversight and poor understanding of infection control practices contributed to the contamination of multidose vials or the reuse of injection equipment and transmission of hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus to numerous patients.",

These organisms limit treatment options, increase transmission risks for vulnerable patient populations, increase illness and death, prolong the hospital stay, and add to healthcare costs. The rise of these organisms has been most dramatic in U.S. intensive care units, where >50% of Staphylococcus aureus isolates are resistant to methicillin (MRSA) and >25% of enterococcal isolates are resistant to vancomycin. Cases of vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus and three recent cases of vancomycin-resistant S. aureus, both in outpatient settings, attest to the potential for amplification of these organisms in healthcare settings. Gram-negative organisms resistant to extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamases present similar concerns and have been associated with numerous outbreaks in healthcare facilities.",
