In most cases, the etiology of uveitis is unknown; however, it can be associated with autoimmune disease, infection (viral, fungal, or parasitic), or trauma [2\u20136]. Uveitis results in significant visual impairment and is thought to account for 10\u201315% of all cases of total blindness in the United States (US) and developed world [1, 4, 6\u20138]. While posterior uveitis accounts for only 20% of the estimated 1 in 500 people in the US with uveitis [1], it is the more severe form of the disease.",

Treatments aimed at reducing CME are therefore effective in the treatment of uveitis. Corticosteroids are considered the mainstay of noninfectious uveitis treatment [4, 9]. However, since the disease is typically chronic in nature, patients often require long-term repeated treatment with either topical or systemic corticosteroids [10, 11]. In severe cases of uveitis, multiple rounds of sub-Tenon or intravitreal corticosteroid injections as well as systemic corticosteroids may be necessary. The potential for complications such as endophthalmitis, vitreous hemorrhage, and retinal detachment following use of repeated intravitreal injections is substantial [12, 13]. Systemic corticosteroids require high dosages to achieve therapeutic concentrations in the eye and are associated with systemic side effects including hypertension, hyperglycemia, and increased susceptibility to infection [14, 15]. Immunosuppressive agents can be an effective treatment option, but are associated with serious and potentially life-threatening systemic adverse events (AEs) such as renal and hepatic failure and bone marrow suppression [9, 16]. Thus, such therapy is usually reserved for patients with severe uveitis who are unresponsive to corticosteroid therapy or with corticosteroid-induced complications.",

Approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of chronic non-infectious posterior uveitis (NIPU), the FA implant is inserted into the posterior segment through a small pars plana incision and sutured to the sclera. The implant releases FA at a nominal initial rate of 0.6 \u00b5g/day, decreasing over the first month to a steady state between 0.3 and 0.4 \u00b5g/day for approximately 2.5 years. The sustained release of FA was previously reported to result in long-term, continuous control of inflammation [17, 18], and the implant is therefore considered to be particularly suitable for patients with chronic inflammation due to NIPU.",

The 0.59-mg implant releases FA at approximately 0.4 \u03bcg/day, whereas the 2.1-mg implant releases FA at a rate of approximately 2 \u03bcg/day initially, decreasing to approximately 1 \u03bcg/day over a 3-year period. Surgical implantation was performed under local or general anesthesia with placement of the implant in the inferonasal or inferotemporal quadrant of the posterior segment at the pars plana. A pars plana infusion line was placed to reduce the possibility of globe collapse in vitrectomized eyes. An 8-0 Prolene\u2122 (Ethicon, Inc., Somerville, NJ, USA) suture anchored the implant, such that the top surface of the implant faced the front of the eye.",

The FA intravitreal implant effectively reduced rates of uveitis recurrence and improved visual outcomes compared to nonimplanted fellow eyes. The degree of improvement relative to the nonimplanted fellow eyes was especially notable given that most patients had bilateral NIPU and had the more severely affected eye implanted. Uveitis recurrence rates in eyes treated with the FA intravitreal implant (combined dose groups) decreased from 42.3% during the 1-year pre-implantation period to 25.9% during the 3-year post-implantation period, and control was maintained through 3 years. Visual acuity in implanted eyes was stabilized or improved in 80% of eyes with a significant number of eyes demonstrating a \u22653 line improvement at 3 years post-implantation. Furthermore, eyes treated with the FA intravitreal implant had a reduced need for adjunctive systemic therapy or periocular or topical corticosteroid injections to control uveitis. These data are consistent with two previous studies evaluating the FA intravitreal implant in the treatment of NIPU [18, 20]. Both the marketed 0.59-mg FA intravitreal implant (Retisert) and the 2.1-mg FA intravitreal implant demonstrated similar efficacy, although the higher-dose implant tended to have a shorter time to uveitis recurrence. This was attributed to a shorter lifespan of the 2.1-mg implant and consistent with known in vitro release rate data, suggesting that the drug reservoir is depleted more rapidly in the higher-dose implant.",

            "text": "The main cause of visual loss in patients with posterior uveitis is CME [21, 22]. The ability of the FA implant to reduce CME through control of inflammation led to good visual acuity outcomes. These improved visual acuity outcomes were observed despite the formation of cataracts in the majority of implanted patients. Cataract formation and progress are common in eyes with uveitis and attributable both to the inflammatory progress and to the chronic use of corticosteroids to control the disease. [16] In this study, nearly all (94.9%) implanted phakic eyes underwent cataract surgery during the 3-year follow-up with a high incidence of reduction in BCVA of \u22653 lines observed between 12 and 18 months post-implantation\u2014the period during follow-up when most cataract surgeries were performed in implanted eyes. However, following cataract removal, implant eye visual acuity improved, with a significant improvement in mean BCVA compared with baseline in the 0.59-mg implant group at 2 and 3 years post-implantation and with 27.4% of implanted eyes (both dose groups combined) improved by \u22653 lines over baseline at 3 years post-implantation, a significantly greater proportion than that observed in fellow nonimplanted eyes (P < 0.0001). Notably, in a follow-up post hoc analysis of post-surgical outcomes in eyes requiring cataract extraction from an earlier Phase II/III study of the FA implant in the treatment of NIPU, Sheppard et al. [23] reported better vision and less intraocular inflammation following cataract surgery in implanted eyes compared with nonimplanted eyes. These results were more remarkable, in that in the study, as well as in the current study, the FA-implanted eye represented each patient\u2019s worse eye. At 1 and 3 months post-cataract extraction, mean improvement in visual acuity was significantly greater in implanted than nonimplanted eyes (P \u2264 0.0047) and significantly fewer AC cells were seen in implanted than nonimplanted eyes (P \u2264 0.0084) [23].",

Herbert et al. [26] reported the prevalence of elevated IOP in uveitis patients to be as high as 41.8%; with 29.8% of cases requiring treatment to manage the elevated IOP. The proportion of implanted eyes experiencing elevations in IOP in this study was higher (67.8% and 71.3% of eyes in the 0.59- and the 2.1-mg implant groups, respectively), due to the fact that corticosteroid treatment itself may also lead to reduced aqueous outflow through a variety of mechanisms [27, 28]. While the majority of implanted eyes with IOP elevations were successfully treated with IOP-lowering medications, 33% of implanted eyes with IOP elevations required glaucoma-filtering procedures to control IOP. Details of the topical IOP-lowering medications and filtering procedures utilized in this study and the two previous FA implant studies have been described by Goldstein et al. [29]. Trabeculectomy was the most common surgical procedure in this and previous studies, and surgical procedures were deemed successful in 85.1% of eyes at 1 year (postoperative IOP of 6\u201321 mm Hg with or without additional IOP-lowering medication).",

Adverse events in nonimplanted eyes appeared to be reflective, in large part, of the underlying uveitic process (e.g., reduced visual acuity, cataract, eye pain, increased IOP, conjunctival hyperemia, vitreous floaters, blurred vision, macular edema), while AEs in implanted eyes were consistent with the surgical procedure and corticosteroid delivered (e.g., increased IOP, eye pain, conjunctival hermorrhage, postoperative wound complications, cataract formation). Notably, there were no nonocular AEs considered treatment related in either implant group. This finding is likely due to the negligible systemic exposure to FA following implantation of the FA implant. In a previous study of patients who received the intravitreal implant, and had blood samples taken at various times after implantation, plasma levels of FA were below the limit of detection [30].",
