The first cases occurred after new feeder pigs from a large piglet producer were brought onto the farm. The incoming animals showed diarrhea 2 days after arrival. Within 1 day thereafter, the disease had spread to pigs in all other age groups. Clinical signs were present for at least 1 week; \u224820 pigs died. Fecal samples from diseased pigs were submitted to the regional laboratory for diagnosis, and coronaviruses were detected by electron microscopy (Figure 1). Additionally, 3 pigs with catarrhal enteritis were euthanized; postmortem examination at the regional laboratory confirmed coronavirus infection in all 3 animals. ",

At this institution, 2 fecal samples with high genome load, as determined by 2 independent, published (8,9) reverse transcription quantitative PCRs selective for PEDV nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) genes, were chosen for routine virologic testing and next-generation sequencing. Sequencing and data analyses were performed as previously described (10). The phylogenetic tree, based on full-length genomes, was constructed by using PhyML (11) in the Geneious software suite (http://www.geneious.com/) with a generalized time reversible substitution model, and the tree was supported by 1,000 bootstrapping replicates.",

Comparative analyses of full-length sequences revealed that the isolates from these pigs in Germany show very high nucleotide similarity with strain OH851 found in the United States in 2014. However, differences exist that distinguish the strains from Germany from the highly virulent PEDV strains that caused the major losses in the United States. Given the fact that PEDV surveillance has been lacking in Germany, we cannot exclude the possibility that the strains described here have already been circulating in Europe for a longer time or were indeed recently introduced from the United States or Asia to Europe. Therefore, our report provides useful information about recent PEDV strains in Europe, but a comprehensive evaluation is still difficult because of a lack of data about additional strains. Future studies should therefore concentrate on analysis of additional PEDV from different years and locations.",
