For both cell lines there was a linear dose\u2013response curve with a wide dynamic range. This result suggested that this methodology can be used to accurately titer virus stocks. We next determined the titer of stocks of several influenza A and B virus strains using the ELVIRA\u00ae Flu A\u2010luc and ELVIRA\u00ae Flu B\u2010Rluc cells and determined the titers at the same time with MDCK cells using a TCID50 method. We included in this analysis four strains of highly pathogenic avian (H5N1) influenza A virus which all were able to induce luciferase in the ELVIRA\u00ae Flu A\u2010luc cells (data not shown). As shown in Table 1 the titers generated with both cell lines were very similar.",
