The absence of an animal cell model for most caliciviruses has restricted our understanding of their biology. In particular, infection with human noroviruses (HuNoVs) has caused viral epidemic gastroenteritis globally in people of all ages [38]. Feline calicivirus (FCV) and murine norovirus have been used widely as model systems [39], and this has contributed to our understanding of HuNoVs. FCV belongs to the genus Vesivirus and is a highly contagious pathogen that is widely distributed in the feline population [41]. Previous FCV isolates mainly induced upper respiratory tract disease and oral ulceration [22, 23, 31, 32] with a low mortality rate (~2 %) [2, 40]. However, several outbreaks with high mortality (up to 60 %) have been reported in recent years [24].",

FCV has the highest evolutionary rate among viruses [4]. Although there is only one serotype of FCV, the variability of its main antigen VP1 often contributes to a lack of efficacy of vaccination, and widespread vaccination does not prevent the spread of FCV [19]. In natural infections, cats that have recovered fully from an FCV infection are not protected against infection with other FCV strains [21]. In addition, FCV variants can inhibit or evade the host immune response and persist in cats [4]. After recovery from FCV infection, the clinical symptoms disappear, but many cats continue shedding virus for more than 30 days or even several years [32]. Our previous study found that FCV strain 2280 cannot induce IFN-\u03b2 expression in vitro [34], which may be a key factor for survival of FCV in cats. Failure to efficiently control FCV infection leads to a high prevalence of FCV. FCV vaccines reduce the duration and severity of clinical signs but do not inhibit virus shedding or infection [25].",

Production of type I interferons (IFNs), which are involved in antiviral responses and have broad-spectrum antiviral activities, is triggered by the presence of viral dsRNA or by-products of viral replication [10]. However, many viruses have evolved multiple strategies to evade or inhibit the IFN response [5\u20137, 35\u201337]. In vitro infection with some FCV strains does not result in activation of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter [34], thus allowing these viruses to evade the IFN response.",

Phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMO) can function as efficient drugs to control FCV disease [30] and have been tested in natural outbreaks of FCV. Mefloquine is a human-approved pharmaceutical compound that has been demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of FCV infections [18]. Combination treatment with Mefloquine and \u201crecombinant feline interferon \u03c9\u201d (rFeIFN-\u03c9) results in a higher efficiency in controlling FCV infection [18]. However, the unfavorable aspects of many drug metabolism pathways might restrict their application [18]. Lithium chloride (LiCl) is widely applied as an important therapeutic agent for nervous system disorders [15], including Alzheimer\u2019s disease [8], and for serous ovarian cancer [20] and diabetes [12]. Several studies have suggested that LiCl can act as an antiviral agent for inhibiting the growth of viruses, such as coronavirus [27], herpes simplex virus type 1 [29], porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) [11] and infectious bronchitis virus [13]. Moreover, LiCl can suppress host inflammatory responses [11], regulate cell apoptosis [27], and restore the synthesis of host proteins in virus-infected cells [43]. Our previous study found that LiCl can efficiently suppress FCV replication in in vitro [41]. However, antiviral therapy with a single drug often causes the emergence of drug-resistant FCV strains. In addition, the high evolutionary rate of FCV [4] makes it necessary to identify more antiviral drugs.",

It can suppress angiogenesis and metastasis, which contributes the restriction of cell proliferation. Due to its potential to inhibit the growth of tumour cells, germacrone has been widely used as an anti-cancer drug in China [17]. It has been demonstrated that germacrone can inhibit the replication of H1N1 and H3N2 influenza A virus in vitro by impairing the attachment/entry step and early events in the viral life cycle [14]. Another study also found that germacrone may be a potential drug against porcine parvovirus (PPV) infection [3]. In the current study, the antiviral effects of germacrone on FCV replication were investigated by measuring changes in viral RNA (vRNA) levels and virus yield. The results indicated that germacrone can act as an efficient antiviral drug against FCV replication.",
