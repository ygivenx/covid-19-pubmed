A memorandum to address this matter have been useful. Moreover, the genomic revolution has caused a taxonomic revolution; this is specifically true for bacteriology. For example, 16S rRNA sequencing allowed reclassification of many pathogenic organisms and descriptions of many others. These advances is genomic knowledge have brought about many changes in the names of pathogenic microorganisms, evidenced here by the authors' devoting the largest part of the book to bacteria.",
