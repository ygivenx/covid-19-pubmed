Relatively fresh fecal samples were collected from sheets at approximately 5:30 to 6:00 the next morning and placed in VTM. Samples were transported to the laboratory and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use. All animals trapped for this study were released back to their habitat after sample collection.

ACE2 expression was detected using goat anti-hACE2 immunoglobulin (Ig) (R&D Systems) followed by FITC-labeled donkey anti-goat Ig from PTGLab (Chicago, IL). Virus replication was detected using rabbit antibody against the SL-CoV Rp3 nucleocapsid protein followed by cyanin 3-conjugated mouse anti-rabbit IgG. Nuclei were stained with 4\u2032,6\u2032-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Staining patterns were examined using a FV1200 confocal microscope (Olympus).",
