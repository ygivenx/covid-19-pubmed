The existence of 2\u20103 and 2\u20106 linked sialic acid in the swine respiratory tract allows type A influenza viruses of human and avian origin to infect pigs.\n11\n\n",

One possibility is that an avian\u2010like swine H1N1 virus (ancestral ALa) was introduced into the Thai pig population around 1990, where two distinct classical swine viruses (Cla and Clb) had already been circulating. By means of this introduction, all of the gene segments except the HA of the Cla viruses were replaced by genes of ancestral ALa virus. For the viruses which retained the Clb HA gene, most of the segments were also replaced by genes of ALa origin. The fact that three strains (Chon9469, Chon977 and Sara13021) with the Clb HA had retained NS genes of Clb origin supports this possibility. Another possibility is that progenitor viruses with a combination of genes of Clb and ALa origin established elsewhere were introduced into the Thai pig population where only viruses with genes of Cla origin had been circulating. The coincidence of the divergent year of hypothetical ancestral genes for Clb and ALa genes supports this possibility. A weakness of the latter hypothesis is that there has been no report of such a progenitor virus in the world, although this does not completely exclude the possibility. Also, the existence of the Clb NS genes in the Thai SIVs discounts this possibility as well. In any case, the introduction of avian\u2010like swine virus resulted in a variety of genetic constellations within the H1N1 Thai SIVs.",

SIVs with an avian internal protein gene constellation have been recognized in Europe for H3N2 and H1N2 subtypes since the mid\u20101980s and \u20101990s respectively.\n4\n, \n22\n Although it is not clear when the progeny Hb Thai viruses were introduced into the Thai pig population, our estimation revealed that the H3 and N2 genes of an ancestral Hb virus had diverged in 1976, indicating that the virus did not contain any avian\u2010like swine genes at that time. Then, genes encoding internal proteins of the H3 (H1) N2 SIVs possessing surface antigens of Hb origin were replaced with those of the H1N1 SIVs established in Thailand, although it is not clear that the ancestral H3N2 viruses containing Hb origin were circulating amongst the Thai pig population prior to the introduction of the ALa genes from the data analysed by us.",

Further surveillance would elucidate whether one genotype highly adapted to the pigs in each subtype gradually became dominant amongst various genotypes of the Thai SIVs. It is unclear whether different gene constellations observed in this study could affect the pathogenicity of the Thai SIVs. Van Reeth observed no differences of virulence in pigs amongst three subtypes (H1N1, H3N2 and H1N2) or strains.\n34\n In addition, dual infections with SIVs and other pathogens such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV)\n35\n and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae\n\n36\n complicate the pathogenicity of SIVs.
