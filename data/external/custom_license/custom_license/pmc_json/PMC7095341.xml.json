            "text": "The recent identification of a novel coronavirus, MERS-CoV\u2014which, as of May 15th 2013, had infected 40 patients with a total of 20 fatalities\u2014has drawn worldwide attention as a potential cause of a future pandemic5. Unlike most coronaviruses circulating in humans that only cause mild respiratory illness6, MERS-CoV possibly represents a second reported coronavirus of severely high virulence after SARS-CoV, which caused over 8,000 infection cases globally in 2003, with more than 800 deaths3. The clinical manifestations of MERS-CoV infection include fever, cough, acute respiratory distress syndrome and, in some cases, accompanying renal failure1,2, and are very similar to those caused by SARS-CoV. However, the novel coronavirus diverges from SARS-CoV in genomic sequence, and is much more closely related to the bat-derived HKU4 and HKU5 coronaviruses7,8. Consistent with phylogenetic analysis, MERS-CoV does not use the SARS-CoV receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), as its entry receptor9; rather, a recent study showed that it uses human CD26 for this purpose4. CD26 is the third peptidase to be identified as a functional coronavirus receptor, the others being aminopeptidase N (ANPEP, also known as APN and CD13)10,11 and ACE2 (ref. 12).",

            "text": "The recognition of CD26 by MERS-CoV is mediated by virus surface spike (S) protein4. As with other coronaviruses, the MERS-CoV S protein would be cleaved in host cells into S1 and S2 subunits (Fig. 1a). S1 engages the receptor4 whereas S2, with typical sequence motifs homologous to those identified as the heptad repeats in class I enveloped viruses13,14,15, should mediate membrane fusion. The exploitation of the virus\u2013receptor interaction and thus of the intervention strategies requires an atomic delineation of the receptor-binding properties of S1. On the basis of previous studies, the receptor attachment sites of coronavirus S1 subunits might locate to either the amino-terminal (such as in murine hepatitis virus16) or the carboxy-terminal (such as in, for example, SARS-CoV17 and human coronavirus NL63 (ref. 18)) domain. We therefore tested individually the binding of MERS-CoV S1 and its N- and C-terminal-domain proteins to cell-surface-expressed CD26 molecules. The receptor-binding capacity was attributed to the C-terminal amino acids 367\u2013606 of MERS-CoV S1 (Fig. 1b). We hereby referred to this domain as RBD. The potent interaction between MERS-CoV RBD and CD26 was further demonstrated by surface plasmon resonance assays, in which CD26 binds to MERS-CoV RBD with a dissociation constant (Kd) of about 16.7 nM (Kon, 1.79 \u00d7 105 M\u22121s\u22121; Koff, 2.99 \u00d7 10\u22123s\u22121), but does not bind to the RBD of SARS-CoV (Fig. 1c).",

Two molecules of essentially the same structure are present in the asymmetric unit. Each molecule contains 208 consecutive density-traceable amino acids from V381 to L588. A Dali19 search within the Protein Data Bank (PDB) revealed clear structural homology between MERS-CoV RBD and SARS-CoV RBD (PDB code, 2DD8; Z score, 15.1). We therefore divided the MERS-CoV RBD structure into two subdomains: a core and an external \u03b2-sheet, using the structure of SARS-CoV RBD as a reference. The core subdomain reveals a five-stranded antiparallel \u03b2-sheet (\u03b21, \u03b23, \u03b24, \u03b25 and \u03b210) in the centre. The connecting helices (four \u03b1-helices: \u03b11\u20134 and two 310-helices: \u03b71 and \u03b72) and two small \u03b2-strands (\u03b22 and \u03b211) further decorate the sheet on both sides, together forming a globular fold. Three disulphide bonds, connecting C383 to C407, C425 to C478, and C437 to C585, respectively, stabilize the core-domain structure from the interior. At the solvent-exposed side, the RBD termini are clinched adjacent to each other (Fig. 2a, b). This subdomain fold is very similar to that of the SARS-CoV RBD core (a root mean squared deviation of 2.79 \u00c5 for 76 C\u03b1 pairs). Superimposition of the two structures reveals a well-aligned centre sheet and homologous peripheral helices and strands, although several intervening loops are observed to exhibit large conformational variance (Fig. 2c).",

Two small 310 helices (\u03b73 and \u03b74) and most of the connecting loops in this subdomain locate on the interior side of the sheet, hence exposing a flat exterior sheet-face to the solvent. Residues C503 and C526 form the fourth disulphide bond, linking the \u03b73 helix to strand \u03b26 (Fig. 2a, b). With no observable structure homology (Fig. 2c), the external subdomains of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV RBDs are topological equivalents, both being present as an \u2018insertion\u2019 between the equivalent core-strands (strands \u03b25 and \u03b210 in MERS-CoV, and \u03b26 and \u03b29 in SARS-CoV) (Supplementary Fig. 1).",

Consistent with the high binding affinity between MERS-CoV RBD and CD26, the complex is easily obtainable and stable (Supplementary Fig. 2). The complex structure was solved at 2.7 \u00c5 resolution (Supplementary Table 1) with one RBD binding to a single CD26 molecule in the asymmetric unit. The receptor, as shown in previous reports20,21, is composed of an eight-bladed \u03b2-propeller domain and an \u03b1/\u03b2 hydrolase domain. MERS-CoV RBD binds to the side-surface of the CD26 \u03b2-propeller, recognizing blades IV and V and a small bulged helix in the blade-linker. As for the viral ligand, the entire receptor binding site locates in the external subdomain and to the solvent-exposed sheet-face, qualifying the subdomain as the receptor binding motif (RBM) (Fig. 3a). Overall, engagement of the receptor does not induce obvious conformational changes in RBM, although small structural variance could be observed for the tip-loops. The \u03b72\u2013\u03b14 loop in the RBD core, however, unexpectedly exhibits a large conformational difference between the free and the bounded structures (Supplementary Fig. 3). We believe this is due to a crystal contact present in the free RBD structure, which is interrupted in the complex crystal by the engaging receptor.",

The dimerization of the peptidase relies on broad intermolecule contacts contributed by the hydrolase domain and the extended strands in blade IV of the \u03b2-propeller20,21. A lateral binding of MERS-CoV RBD to CD26 would therefore not disrupt CD26 dimerization. Accordingly, a similar U-shaped CD26 dimer could be generated by symmetry operations of the complex structure. The viral ligand locates at the membrane-distal tip of the dimer, corresponding well to a trans interaction between the virus and the receptor (Fig. 3b). Considering that the RBD N and C termini are on the same side distant from CD26, it is unlikely that the remaining S domains would contact the receptor molecule. The binding mode revealed by the complex structure is also in good accordance with a previous study showing that the virus\u2013receptor interaction is independent of the peptidase activity of CD26 (ref. 4). The bound RBD is far away from interfering with either the substrate/product accessing tunnels or the catalytic centre20,21 (Fig. 3b).",

Scrutinization of the binding interface reveals a group of hydrophilic residues at the site, forming a polar-contact (H-bond and salt-bridge) network. These interactions are predominantly mediated by the residue side chains (including RBD Y499 with CD26 R336, N501 with Q286, K502 with T288, D510 with R317, E513 with Q344, and D539 with K267), although CD26 L294 and RBD D510 are observed to contact RBD R542 and CD26 Y322, respectively, through the main-chain oxygen atom (Fig. 4b). In addition, the bulged helix in CD26 properly positions three hydrophobic residues A291, L294 and I295 into close proximity with the RBD amino acids Y540, W553 and V555, forming a hydrophobic centre at the interface (Fig. 4c). Further virus\u2013receptor contacts include V341 and I346 of CD26 packing against P515 and the apolar carbon atoms of R511 and E513 in RBD (Fig. 4d), and a CD26 N229-linked carbohydrate moiety interacting with RBD amino acids W535 and E536 (Fig. 4e). Overall, the virus\u2013receptor engagement is dominated by the polar contacts mediated by the hydrophilic residues, and mutations of those in RBD (six alanine substitutions and one Y499F mutation of the CD26-) completely abrogated its interaction with CD26 (Supplementary Fig. 4). The features of these residue interactions are very similar to those mediating the interaction between adenosine deaminase (ADA) and CD26 (ref. 23). By a pairwise comparison, we unexpectedly found that all those CD26 residues identified in the virus\u2013receptor interface are also involved in ADA binding, indicating a competition between ADA and the virus for CD26 receptor. As the ADA\u2013CD26 interaction is shown to induce co-stimulatory signals in T cells22, this may indicate a possible manipulation of the host immune system by MERS-CoV through competition for the ADA-recognition site. It is also noteworthy that those CD26 residues involved in RBD binding are highly conserved between human and bat, with only two variations (I295T and R317Q), explaining the capability of MERS-CoV using bat CD26 for cell entry4 (Supplementary Fig. 5).",

Both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV belong to the betacoronavirus genus, but are classified into different lineage subgroups (subgroup 2b for SARS-CoV and 2c for MERS-CoV)8. We noted that the spike sequences are of low identity among different subgroup members. For example, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV S proteins show a sequence identity of less than 28%. Nevertheless, RBDs of the two coronaviruses are homologous for the core subdomain. Notably, the three interior disulphide bonds in the core are well-aligned for the steric positions in the two RBD structures and well-conserved in sequence among betacoronaviruses. Conversely, the external RBM region is highly variable in both length and residue composition (Supplementary Fig. 6). Consistently, no structural homology in this subdomain is observed between MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. Yet it is this subdomain that engages cellular receptors. We therefore assume that betacoronaviruses probably have a similar core-domain fold in the S protein to present the external amino acids with divergent structures for viral pathogenesis, such as receptor recognition.",

Nevertheless, related structural topologies can still be observed in RBDs of these coronaviruses26. We noted that in the RBD\u2013receptor complex structures of both MERS-CoV and porcine respiratory coronavirus the binding interfaces involve a receptor N-glycan. This might represent another cross-genus similarity in the Coronaviridae family, which supports a proposed common evolutionary origin of coronavirus S proteins26.

A large number of antibodies show neutralization activity by targeting the RBD and thereby disrupting the virus\u2013receptor engagement. Therefore, a properly folded RBD could be an ideal immunogen for vaccination, as demonstrated for SARS-CoV27. A recent report indeed shows the presence of S-specific neutralizing antibodies in MERS-CoV-infected patients28.
