They display evolution in real time as they acquire antiviral drug resistance, mediate persistent infection through escape from T and B cell immune system responses to infection or, at the experimental level, rapidly adapt to different cell culture conditions, new receptors and new hosts. Although biologists since the time of Darwin have convincingly inferred the existence of natural selection from the current species distributions of animals and plants, and their genetic relationships, this evidence is almost always indirect and observational. By contrast, virologists have access to the remarkable field of experimental evolution, such that adaptive processes that may occur over centuries or millennia in larger organisms can be observed in viruses over days or weeks.",

Newly developed methods to characterize viruses from ancient DNA (aDNA) samples have revealed that viruses that circulated in ancient times do not substantially differ genetically from those that currently circulate in humans. Furthermore, the discovery of endogenous viral elements (EVEs) in the genomes of mammals, birds and other eukaryotes shows that viruses similar to contemporary virus species existed tens of millions of years ago.",

Virus sequence change occurs so quickly that phylogenetic trees of their genes are often temporally structured \u2014 viruses from older samples show systematically less divergence from the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) than those collected more recently. As an early example of this phenomenon, the distance from the tree root of sequences of enterovirus 70 isolates collected through the 1970s and 1980s showed a linear relationship with collection date; the calculated nucleotide substitution rate of 5 \u00d7 10\u22123 substitutions per site per year (SSY) allowed the start of the outbreak to be dated to 1967 (ref.8). The availability of virus samples collected over relatively wide date ranges, often stretching back to the 1950s or 1960s, has enabled more sophisticated Bayesian methods (for example, Bayesian evolutionary analysis by sampling trees (BEAST)9,10) to estimate dates of origins and substitution rates for a wide range of viruses associated with recent outbreaks. Furthermore, these evolutionary timescales have often been linked to historical events. Among many examples, a nucleotide substitution rate of 5 \u00d7 10\u22124 SSY in the hepatitis C virus (HCV) genome was used to calculate dates of emergence of various genotype 2 subtypes to 1470, a finding that might explain the association of genotype 2 infections in areas where the slave trade operated several hundred years ago11. On the basis of its substitution rate and geography of currently circulating genotypes, hepatitis B virus (HBV) was proposed to have originated in native South American populations and spread into Europe and elsewhere after contact with the Europeans in the 1500s12. Likewise, the origin of the four genotypes of hepatitis E virus (HEV) infecting humans was estimated to be between 536 and 1,344 years ago13, and this was suggested to be associated with the spread of pig farming; HEV strains of genotypes 3 and 4 in Japan apparently originated from the 1900s, when pigs were first imported from Yorkshire in England14.",

For example, influenza A virus shows rapid, antibody-driven antigenic drift of the haemagglutinin gene that enables it to escape from neutralizing antibodies16. Both HIV-1 and HCV fix several amino acid changes in immunodominant T cell epitopes during primary infection that prevent antigen presentation to cytotoxic T cells, contributing to their ability to replicate and transmit17,18.",

This appears particularly applicable to those emerging viruses responsible for the numerous recent and often severe disease outbreaks that have afflicted humans, animals and plants. This impression is reinforced by what we know about the origins of particular viruses; the emergence of HIV-1 is indeed documented to be recent, originating from multiple cross-species transmissions of a chimpanzee lentivirus into humans in the late 19th century in Gabon and the Congo21. This was followed by various genomic changes associated with human adaptation and increases in human-to-human transmissibility in the subsequent decades that enabled its spread out of Africa in the 1970s to become a global pandemic22,23. Recent outbreaks of influenza A virus, Nipah virus, Hendra virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus similarly have zoonotic origins with the associated public health concern of host adaptation and the permanent establishment of these viruses in human populations24.",

Viruses circulating in these prehistoric times in many cases matched currently circulating HBV genotypes (genotypes A, B and D) and were only 1.3\u20133.0% divergent from modern strains. This indicates a long-term substitution rate ranging from 8.04 \u00d7 10\u22126 SSY to 1.51 \u00d7 10\u22125 SSY, which is around 100-fold lower than that measured in contemporary samples (7.72 \u00d7 10\u22124 SSY39). Similar samples also provided evidence for the circulation of B19V in humans from Central Asia 5000 bc and in Vikings from Sweden ad 100038. These strains closely matched contemporary genotypes (type 1 and type 2), and a similarly revised lower substitution rate estimate was observed. Whereas an early study of sequence change in B19V (ref.7) predicted a time of origin of current genotype 1 strains to the 1960s or 1970s, the aDNA study indicated that this genotype was actually alive and kicking in Eurasia in the early Neolithic era, nearly 7,000 years ago. Further analyses of progressively older aDNA sequence libraries will undoubtedly reveal more insights into the pace of virus evolution for ever-widening collections of human, animal and plant viruses.",

Once endogenized, EVEs are genetically stable and preserve information about the circulation of ancient viruses that is impossible to infer from examination of contemporary virus populations. For example, lentiviruses were originally considered as a recently emerged group of viruses on the basis of the very recent origins of HIV-1 itself and measured substitution rates that place the origins of lentiviruses to a few thousand years ago21. However, endogenous lentiviruses in rabbits45, ferrets, Madagascan lemurs and colugos demonstrate the circulation of lentiviruses over almost the entire time span of mammalian evolution46\u201348. In addition to retroviruses, other RNA and DNA viruses have also adventitiously integrated into host germ lines and created records of ancient infections. On the basis of their distribution in descendant species, filoviruses44,49, parvoviruses, circoviruses and bornaviruses must have all circulated over long periods during mammalian evolution44. In addition, the detection of reptilian hepadnaviruses provides evidence for the circulation of these viruses in the early Mesozoic, >200 million years (Myr) ago, long before the radiation of mammals50.",

However, over longer timescales, viral evolutionary rates are several orders of magnitude slower, approaching those of their hosts. Rather than a simple dichotomy between short and long timescales, viral evolutionary rates appear to decrease continuously with the timescale of measurement57, with a decay rate that is strikingly consistent with a power law relationship between substitution rate and observational period53 (Fig. 1; data sources are listed in Supplementary information). Over the longest timescales (100 million to 1 billion years), substitution rates for DNA and RNA viruses of any configuration were remarkably similar: rates of 1\u20135 \u00d7 10\u22129 SSY; these in turn closely match the 2.2 \u00d7 10\u22129 SSY mean substitution rate calculated for mammalian genes58. At the other end of the scale, short-term substitution rates varied by virus group, with slower rates for double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses (4 \u00d7 10\u22124 SSY) than RNA viruses (8 \u00d7 10\u22123 SSY for those with positive-strand RNA genomes), with a degree of virus lineage-specific variability in short-term rates within each Baltimore group (discussed in ref.57). However, for each Baltimore group, rate decay over time was comparable. Remarkably, the recently obtained substitution rates from aDNA studies superimpose directly upon the regression line inferred from other methods (Fig. 1; blue dots).",

Using inappropriate substitution models frequently leads to underestimations of age through, for example, the effects of saturation60. However, it is unlikely that even the most complex currently available models can accurately capture nuances of viral genome evolution (for example, the effects of gene overlap, epistasis and nucleotide biases) and reconcile these disparities in age estimations. Sequencing errors, now rare in next-generation sequencing data, could also elevate recent rate estimates, but this effect cannot scale over the longer timescales, over which rate variation is observed. Explanations positing changes in biology over time have also been put forward, such as variance in the fidelity of viral polymerases61, but it is difficult to see how such features could explain the wide-ranging observation of the phenomenon across taxa and over time. Perhaps the most widely accepted explanation is that short-term rate measurements capture population-level processes including transient deleterious mutations and transient beneficial but short-sighted adaptations for their current host62,63 that do not survive in the longer term, whereas long-term rates more closely represent the true fixation rate of mutations over macroevolutionary timescales57,64. Although this explanation could account for the TDRP over short timescales, it is not clear whether deleterious mutations persist for long enough to explain the effect over timescales spanning millions of years.",

If we take parvovirus B19V and HBV as examples of viruses showing evidence for long-term presence in their host populations, their genotypes typically show diversity in the 10\u221215% nucleotide sequence divergence range, which is represented figuratively as the blue area of potential sequence \u2018wobble\u2019 in the virus niche (Fig. 2). This pattern of within-species diversity typifies a wide range of other human, veterinary and plant viruses; examples of the former include individual serotypes of alphaviruses, flaviviruses, measles virus, mumps virus, most of the paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses, and so on. This pattern is also the norm for the vast range of virus species infecting arthropods and fungi, and represents the fraction of genome sites not under selection for fitness optimization. Variation at this level represents the majority of what is captured in temporal sampling and may underlie the generally rapid substitution rates reported for RNA and small DNA viruses over short observation periods. However, the sequence space is small and restrictive \u2014 changes at those few neutral sites may saturate at much lower divergence levels than evolutionary models typically expect. We might describe this constraint as a cage \u2014 not in the sense of the limited genome size of RNA viruses70 but reflecting those host-imposed constraints on virus sequence change that create the appearance of much less sequence divergence and hence temporal depth than is actually present.",

The niche is defined by the host organism that the virus infects, the viral sequence defines the phenotype, and changes are primarily adaptive. Short-term substitution rates simply reflect a virus exploring the limits of its cage at rates linked to their error rates and demography; longer-term diversification of RNA and DNA viruses calculated from aDNA and EVE data (Fig. 1) reflects how viruses adapt as the niche shape changes (Fig. 3).

Host jumps are associated with periods of accelerated sequence change as the virus remodels and regains fitness in an altered environment, very much as conceptualized in bacterial evolution71. Host adaptation after cross-species transmission is associated with rapid amino acid sequence changes of viral genes, typically those associated with receptor interactions and the evasion of innate immunity72\u201376 but often pervasive throughout the entire virus genome77. Larger-scale gene modifications, such as the repurposing of the HIV-1 accessory protein Vpu to antagonize the cellular antiviral protein tetherin was a key adaptive change that enhanced the replication ability of HIV-1 in humans following its zoonotic transfer from chimpanzees22. The diversification of HIV-1 populations in the 100 or more years since its zoonotic introduction might indeed be interpreted as an ongoing process of fitness optimization. The gradual attenuation of disease severity in HIV-1 infections78 perhaps anticipates a time when HIV-1 diversity is substantially lessened following niche adaptation and the evolution of fitness-optimized, less pathogenic and fully host-adapted HIV-1 strains. HIV-1 population structures and diversity may ultimately match the endemic and tolerated SIV strains that have infected and adapted to many Old World monkey species over much longer periods.",

Immediately after infection, immune escape of viruses in different individuals may drive rapid antigenic diversification. However, the sequential transit of a virus through dozens or many hundreds of individuals may lead to a static cycle of adaptation on infection and reversion on transmission through different MHC repertoires. At the population level, there may be no net sequence change, an interesting variant of the Red Queen hypothesis79,80. This larger adaptive space (but still a cage) feeds into a complex dynamic of population susceptibility, transmission rates, neutralization escape and changes in receptor use that perpetuates infections in hosts with adaptive immunity. The elaborate serotype and antigenic shift and/or drift population structures of mammalian viruses in particular may be its direct consequence.",

Although it is known that viruses evolve under constraints and adapt to hosts on transmission, the perspective we offer casts viruses and their genetic relationships to each other as being primarily conditioned by hosts they infect. Their own genetic history that is emphasized so much in virus-centric accounts of their evolution over short periods is quite subservient to the shaping forces of host-driven evolution. Similarly, although existing accounts of virus sequence change are so much focused on their seemingly unlimited evolutionary potential and adaptability, the range of viruses that are able to successfully infect and maintain transmission in their hosts appears limited and is more a function of the host niches a virus can exploit65. For example, the wide range of viruses that infect humans possess specific tissue tropisms, pathologies and transmission routes. However, homologues of these viruses in other mammalian species typically reproduce very closely, and appear restricted by, these same virus\u2013host interactions. As further evidence of host-induced constraints, virus replication ability, transmissibility and successful establishment of zoonoses are predicated, at least in part, on the degree of relatedness of the hosts involved in the host jump81\u201384. Host relatedness indeed underpins the distribution and pathogenicity of lentiviruses infecting primates and humans85,86. If viruses were genuinely able to adapt and innovate in any host environment, these regularities and apparent niche restrictions across viruses infecting different hosts should not occur.",

Indeed, more than any other factor, the idea that host-adapted viruses are exploring space around a small cage of tolerated substitutions accounts best for the absurdly different short-term and long-term substitution rates they display over differing evolutionary timescales. That small cage and the consequent isolation of virus populations from each other may frequently underpin what are classified as virus species in virus taxonomy88,89, which we may now regard as constrained, separate virus populations with often highly demarcated host ranges. The model of host-driven virus evolution thus places viruses as long-term residents of the hosts they infect, perhaps over millions of years or longer, a concept that accords with the general host specificity that virus species display. The majority of their differences from each other are driven by their host adaptation; niche-filling models accord with the growing evidence of the role of selection and adaptation as the driving forces behind longer-term evolution and speciation elsewhere in biology90.",
