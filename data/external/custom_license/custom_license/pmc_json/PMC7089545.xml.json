            "text": "Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV), which belongs to the order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, genus Coronavirus, was first isolated from the brains of suckling pigs with encephalomyelitis in Canada in 1962 [5]. Since then, more PHEVs were isolated from 30 different outbreaks of encephalomyelitis in Canadian pigs over the following few years [4]. Apart from North America, another type of PHEV, characterized by vomition, inappetence and loss of condition, was reported in Belgium in 1973 [16]. PHEV infection is now known to be widespread in worldwide but it usually remains subclinical because pigs are protected by colostral antibodies and subsequently they develop age-related resistance against PHEV [15]. However, when PHEV-seronegative piglets (<3 weeks old) are introduced to this virus, the mortality reaches almost 100%. This is significant for gnotobiotic pig farms or SPF pig farms [24] where the pigs do not receive colostral antibodies. Also, even in not one of those specialized farms, nonimmune subpopulations that might exist in a large gilt pool could act as potential sources of PHEV [17] to induce clinical syndromes, the vomiting and wasting disease (VWD) and/or the encephalomyelitis. Although there has not been any actual outbreak of PHEV in gnotobiotic or SPF pigs in South Korea, PHEV infection seems to be prevalent in conventional swine farms [10]. Therefore, it is important to screen-out the virus from the pig farms in order to prevent an outbreak.",

For serological studies, hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test was used in most cases and virus neutralization (VN) test has been also available for detection of PHEV antibody [20, 22]. For more rapid and accurate PHEV diagnosis, without the need for virus strain, reverse transcriptase PCR and nested PCR methods were developed to detect PHEV using spike gene specific primers [24]. The spike gene of PHEV appears to be the most variable region among coronaviruses [21, 25], which can be exploited to enhance the specificity of PHEV detection. However, sensitivity might not be improved because the region is hypervariable. On the other hand, the nucleocapsid gene is known to be highly conserved and so is appropriate for diagnostic purposes. In the case of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), which belongs to coronavirus as PHEV, the nucleocapsid gene has been implicate as a target for the accurate and early diagnosis of PEDV [12], suggesting that it also could be applied to PHEV diagnosis.",

However, the rate of detection in suckling pigs that we tested came out at 14.3%, lower than that of the previous study (44.4%). We can presume two possible reasons for such a lower rate of detection. Firstly, neutralizing antibodies may have been formed prior to death, interfering the detection of the virus, and secondly PHEV infection in suckling pigs in Korea may have decreased since 2006 due to the presence and acquisition of colostral antibodies.",

In general, PHEV is known to be fatal only to suckling pigs, since they eventually develop immunity against PHEV during growth. A serological survey conducted in Japan revealed a PHEV seropositivity of 90\u2013120 days old pigs exceed 80% [7]. These pigs had been infected by PHEV but showed no clinical signs and remained normal, indicating PHEV might be perpetuated as unapparent form of infection. Moreover, PHEV infection in pigs which are older than 3 weeks is subclinical or shows mild symptoms such as occasional vomiting and brief periods of inappetence and listlessness [15]. However, in this study, PHEV infected weaning and growers had clinical signs that included respiratory distress, neurological symptoms, arthritis, diarrhea, and death. A common aspect was that all the affected pigs were co-infected with other viruses including porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus and/or porcine circovirus-2. Hence, it is presumed that the other virus infection made the pig weak and prone to PHEV infection, possibly because of the poor management or biosecurity in the farm or because of reduced tier of colostral antibody that precluded development of age-related immunity against PHEV.",

Nevertheless, based on the farm management information gathered from farms where PHEV was detected, it seems evident that the conditions on the affected farms were worse than farms where PHEV was negative. For instance, the poor hygiene on the affected farms created the possibility of cross-contamination between rooms. Biosecurity was also poor, with as neighboring farms being closely associated without any intervening partition wall. There were no facilities or equipment for washing and disinfecting the transport trailer or any vehicles entering the farms, and vehicle entry was not strictly restricted. Moreover, facilities and houses for raising pigs were in poor conditions with lack of ventilation systems. As well, some of the affected farms did not have any replacement animal isolation facility. As a result, disease control was unstable and mortality rate increased during the seasonal change. Adding to the problem, some farmers were reluctant to improve their deficient farm management practices. We speculate that all of the above factors might have contributed to PHEV infection and clinical signs. Moreover, the antibody titers of other pathogens including porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Pasteurella multocida, Actinobacillus pleuropneumonia, and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae from these farms were low and uneven, possibly due to poor health management. Hence, without maintenance of a high and consistent antibody titer, the immune state of pigs could be unstable, increasing their susceptibility to infectious diseases.",

            "text": "While serological testing should have been applied to determine the PHEV antibody titer, tests including hemagglutination inhibition and virus neutralization test were not performed. The reason is that when we were collecting samples, only a few of the serum samples were submitted with organs and some pigs were already dead when they arrived. It was decided that in the absence of equal samples numbers for serological testing and PCR, serological results could be inaccurate or unreliable. Antibody for PHEV is highly prevalent worldwide, and seropositive pigs remain subclinical [7]. This could be interpreted inversely to mean that reduced antibody titer might induce clinical signs. All the samples submitted to our lab were from clinically ill pigs. Thus, it was very likely that PHEV would be detected and so, presumably the antibody titer would be low. Based on this postulation, only antigenical testing was conducted. Future work will focus on the isolation of the virus from PHEV-positive samples to perform both serological and antigenical testing using sufficient samples for each case.",

The clinical signs of VWD are characterized by sneezing, coughing, depression, loss of appetence, weakness, and marked vomition [15, 16]. On the other hand, the encephalomyelitic form may start as VWD signs but pigs soon develop severe neurological signs such as muscle tremor, hyperesthesia, incoordination, paddling, or paralysis and in most cases, they precede death [15]. Among the PHEV-positive pigs presently detected, two cases had neurological disease and the rest had respiratory or enteric disease. Respiratory disease might be considered as a primary sign for both VWD and the encephalomyelitic form. In the cases of enteric disease, PHEV-positive pigs showed diarrhea instead of vomition, and were also diagnosed with Escherichia\ncoli or Salmonella spp. that are known causative agents of diarrhea [3, 23]. Nasal bleeding was seen in three cases and this might have represented localized idiopathic epistaxis, trauma or inflammation. All PHEV-positive pigs were co-infected with other viruses and bacteria such as porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus, porcine circovirus-2, transmissible gastroenteritis virus, E. coli, Actinobacillus pleuropneumonia, Streptococcus spp., or Salmonella spp. Hence, it is difficult to prove that the clinical signs of the PHEV-positive pigs were caused mainly by PHEV infection but might be the results of co-infections.",

Appropriately, a phylogenetic tree was constructed for the nucleocapsid gene to observe the evolutionary pattern of the PHEV- positive samples. Based on the result, one genogroup cluster including both the PHEV-positive samples and the PHEV reference strains was established, suggesting that the Chinese type (JT06), European type (VW572), North American type (IAF-404) reference strains and PHEV circulating in Korea may be genetically the same. The variation was not significant compared to existing PHEV strains, with the nucleotide identity exceeding 96%. This is because PHEV has remained genetically stable since its first isolation in Canada in 1962 [21]. Therefore, there may exist only one genogroup from PHEV infected pigs, regardless of age, clinical signs and geographical location. Further analysis of other genes such as the spike gene of all the strains should be conducted to confirm this result.",

However, outbreaks occurred in other countries; 2001 in Japan [24], 2002 in Canada [1], and 2006 in Argentina [17].
