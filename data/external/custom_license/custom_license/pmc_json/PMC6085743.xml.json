            "text": "Acute respiratory infections (ARI) are a real public health problem because of their high morbidity and mortality (Black et al., 2010). The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies respiratory infections as the second leading cause of death worldwide in children under the age of five (Bryce et al., 2005). Approximately 2.2 million children worldwide die each year of ARI and nearly 40% of these deaths occur in Africa because of limited diagnostic capacities (Williams et al., 2002). It has been shown that viral infections play a major role in the occurrence of ARI in developed countries. In sub-Saharan Africa some work on specific viruses such as influenza (Inf) and human respiratory syncytial viruses (hRSV) have been realized but data on the occurrence of ARI remain insufficient (Tiveljung-Lindell et al., 2009, Brittain-Long et al., 2008). Indeed, the responsibility of viruses other than influenza in the occurrence of ARI is not yet sufficiently documented.",

Recent studies done in Kenya, Cameroon and Senegal have highlighted the high prevalence of these pathogens in ARI (Berkley et al., 2010, Njouom et al., 2012, Niang et al., 2010) especially in children. Respiratory viruses frequently associated with ARI include Inf A and B, hRSV, Enteroviruses (EnV), human Metapneumovirus (hMPV), Rhinovirus (hRV), Adenovirus, Parainfluenza virus (PIV) type 1-3 (Pretorius et al., 2012, Razanajatovo et al., 2011). These viruses are responsible for severe clinical forms of common viral infections (bronchiolitis, pneumonia, laryngitis, asthma)(Puzelli et al., 2009). However these etiologic pathogens are not sought in practice due to the underestimation of their involvement in ARI, the lack of an adapted laboratory diagnosis capacities, and limited treatment options. The control of children morbidity and mortality is based on a better understanding of the epidemiology of the disease and the availability of adequate laboratory diagnosis capacity.",

This surveillance has helped to identify and characterize circulating seasonal influenza A(H1N1), A(H3N2), A(H1N1) pdm09 and influenza B viruses. These viruses circulate throughout the year with a peak that varies according to the occurrence of the rainy season between the months of May and June. This surveillance system has contributed to identify age groups at high risk of severe influenza disease (Kadjo et al., 2013). Along with the circulation of influenza viruses, other respiratory viruses were detected in patients presenting with ILI. Given the limited resources of the laboratory, the diagnosis of other respiratory viruses was retrospective and limited to children under five years old. From 2006, as part of the preparation for influenza pandemic, the technical capacities of the laboratory have been strengthened by the tools for molecular diagnosis, staff training and regular supply of reagents and consumables through a cooperative agreement with the U.S. CDC Influenza Division in Atlanta and the Institut Pasteur in Paris. Therefore, it seemed appropriate in this context to add the surveillance of other respiratory viruses to the influenza surveillance network. This study aims to describe the epidemiological and virological patterns of ARI due to non-influenza respiratory viruses in children under five years of age in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.",

After collecting specimens from the first three cases each day, all subsequent cases meeting the case definition for ILI were counted, recorded and reported in a weekly summary. Patients who did not meet the case definitions or for which the verbal consent of the parent or legal guardian was not obtained were excluded from the study. A structured and standardized questionnaire to collect socio-demographic, epidemiological and clinical data was developed and used. The questionnaire also included the collection of outcome data, risk factors related to the severity of the influenza virus infection such as asthma, chronic lung disease, hepatitis, diabetes, malnutrition, obesity, heart disease, chronic kidney disease, blood disorders, and immune deficiencies (e.g. HIV infection) (Mertz et al., 2013, Gill et al., 2015). Samples from each patient included in the study were collected using sterile nasopharyngeal swabs that were then placed in a viral transport medium, VTM (MEM, Gibco-BRL, life Technologies, Paisley, Scotland, Penicillin 200 U / ml, streptomycin 200 mg / ml, BioWhittaker, MA; mycostatin 200U/ml, Sigma, bovine serum albumin 0.25%, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany).

Circulation of other viruses (coronavirus OC43 and enterovirus) occurred in the months of March, May, June and November. (Figure 2).",

            "text": "This is the first study describing the circulation throughout the year of respiratory viruses other than influenza associated with patients less than 5 years with ILI or SARI cases in Cote d\u2019Ivoire and demonstrating their contribution to respiratory disease in this age group. The present study targeted eleven respiratory viruses involved in human respiratory infections. The global detection rate of viruses in our study was 29.1%. This result is consistent with the results of several previous studies that found percentages between 27\u201335% (Yang et al., 2012, Ren et al., 2009, Pierangeli et al., 2007, Arbefeville and Ferrieri, 2017) but it is lower than those reported by several studies in other Africa countries and other regions in the world where the percentages of virus detection were ranged between 40\u201360% (Pretorius et al., 2012, Lekana-Douki et al., 2014, Ahmed et al., 2012). The difference observed in rate of viral etiology could be explained by several factors related to the different study population, geographical catchment area, inclusion criteria, targeted viruses and diagnostic techniques and primers used (Choudhary et al., 2016, Ali et al., 2011). When conducting this study, conventional PCR was the only method available in the laboratory for the screening of other respiratory viruses. In 10 recent years the sensitivity of diagnostic tests for the detection of respiratory viruses has been greatly improved with the development of multiplex real time PCR protocols with high sensitivity and targeting major respiratory viruses involved in human pathology (Barratt et al., 2017, Zhao et al., 2017, Malhotra et al., 2016). The use of conventional PCR could thus be one of the main limitations of our study and explain to a large extent the overall virus detection rate reported in our study. However, it should be noted that for a better understanding of the involvement of respiratory viruses in the respiratory infections of children, it would be interesting to have standardized study protocols.",

            "text": "The most common viruses detected in our study were rhinovirus and hRSV accounting for almost 56% of all cases. Others reported both viruses previously as the major etiology for respiratory viral infections in children under five (Razanajatovo et al., 2011, Kumar et al., 2017, Buecher et al., 2010). The positive rate found for RSV of 24.4% in the study was consistent with our previously published results (Kadjo et al., 2013). The age distribution in our study indicated that infants whose age ranged between 0 and 1 year were more likely to be infected by Rhinovirus and hRSV. Our results also showed that 20.5% of viral pathogens detected were PIV, which implied that PIVs played an important role in children with respiratory as mentioned by Henrickson KJ and al. similar findings were obtained in the studies conducted in several countries in Africa (Lekana-Douki et al., 2014, Lagare et al., 2015). Human metapneumovirus has been proven to be one of the main viral pathogens responsible of respiratory infections. However, its prevalence in cases of acute respiratory infections in children remains low as attested by the results of this study and previous studies conducted in Cote d\u2019Ivoire and in Sub-Saharan Africa regions (Njouom et al., 2012, Kadjo et al., 2013, Lekana-Douki et al., 2014). The results of a meta-analysis study of 75 articles on hMPV prevalence data shown 6.24% cases among ARI cases (Gill et al., 2015). The HCoV229E was with a rate of 12, 05 % of detection. Some studies have found low rates of detection of coronaviruses. According to McIntosh et al (2004), the global incidence of LRTIs due to HCoV was not higher than 3.8% However some studies have shown that the prevalence of these coronavirus in pediatric patients can be significantly higher, varying from about 5% to more than 30% and these discrepancies could be attributed to differences in the research methodologies. Parainfluenza viruses were the most frequent pathogen detected in dual detection cases. These data do not corroborate the assertion that the viruses most commonly involved in co-detection were the viruses with the highest incidence (O\u2019Grady et al., 2016). From the clinical point of view, our study showed that respiratory viruses were found in both cases of ILI and SARI in Children with high proportions (23.4% - 29.8%). Search for respiratory viruses in cases of acute respiratory infections is not systematic in our tropics. The diagnostic approach is empirically oriented on bacterial etiologies. Today with the accessibility and widespread of PCR, this research should be integrated into the clinicians\u2019 diagnostic approach particularly in infants in whom the viral infection can lead to a severe form of respiratory infection especially in the presence of risk factors. Indeed as attested by our study, over 68.0% of children with risk factors presented with severe acute respiratory infections related to viral infection. The most predominant viruses in these cases were hRSV with a rate of 50.0%. The hRSV were also the most involved viruses in SARI cases with 41.2% of cases. This correlated well with the results of several studies showing hRSV as a common cause of lower respiratory tract infection in children admitted to the hospital (Nair H et al., 2010) Our study showed a high proportion of asthma (63.4%) in patients with history of risk factors in According to recent systematic review, using molecular techniques, respiratory viruses are detected in around 80.0% of asthma exacerbation with highest prevalence in children (Papadopoulos and Johnston, 1998). It is obvious that preventive measures and timely management of viral infections in children including children with a history of asthma reduce exacerbation of seizures and progression to severe forms of viral infection.",

            "text": "Among all viruses detected, we have three seasonal profiles. The first profile is that of viruses with a high circulation during the first semester of the year it is the HCoV229E, hRV and PIV; Viruses with high circulation during the second semester of the year, RSV and hMPV and the group of viruses with sporadic circulation, HCoVOC43, EnV. Interestingly the circulation of HRhV and PIV was well correlated with the dry season, which occurred between the months of January and May (fig 2). Our results showed a significant association between the proportion of positive cases of HRV and PIV viruses and dry season with a p-value < 0.001. This has also been observed with the proportion of hRSV positive cases during the rainy season with p-value < 0.001. This association between hRSV and the rainy season has been put in evidence in several studies conducted in tropical area (Lekana-Douki et al., 2014, Do et al., 2016). The transmission pattern of hRSV and the observed promiscuity during rainy seasons play a key role in the high incidence of hRSV during the rainy season.",

Furthermore, such initiatives will assist policy makers to evaluate the benefit of introducing prevention and treatment strategies.",
