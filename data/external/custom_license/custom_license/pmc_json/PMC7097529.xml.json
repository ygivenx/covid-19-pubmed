Outside the cell, however, nanoengineers are uncovering the many hidden talents of DNA. The DNA sequence is able to process information in biochemical assays, its structure is an ideal building material, and its folding pathway allows DNA to move and respond to its environment. Here, I review several innovative applications of designed DNA molecules, some underlying design principles and the prospects for future developments. The applications of new DNA-based technologies range from molecular diagnostics to protein purification and from therapeutics to the assembly of tiny electronic circuits. These uses exploit the properties of DNA at three levels \u2014 sequence only, structure (which depends on sequence) and folding pathways (which depend on both sequence and structure) \u2014 as the following examples show.",

The past decade has seen huge advances in the development of design principles, particularly by exploiting DNA structure and folding pathways, but also in applications of designed DNA sequences. Together, techniques for the in vitro selection or molecular evolution of DNA molecules from random pools have given spectacular yields, including DNA aptamers and enzymes, which can inhibit the expression of harmful genes or disrupt protein function. Excellent reviews of selected DNA molecules can be found elsewhere1,2,3; this paper includes only examples of designed DNA molecules, or molecules that combine both selected and designed features. The examples are organized by the primary property of DNA used: sequence, structure or folding pathway (although the distinctions are sometimes blurred). Overall, I hope that the reader will gain a renewed appreciation for the extraordinary abilities of DNA, and that the range of examples will stimulate ideas for further practical applications.",

Two powerful principles unify the applications of DNA tags. First, new DNA codes4 can direct the cheap and efficient parallel synthesis of large sets of polymers. In this case, each DNA tag is composed of ordered segments that specify the sequence of polymeric units of one molecule to be synthesized, just as a sequence of natural codons specifies the sequence of amino acids that make up a protein. Second, efficient methods for amplifying, sequencing and detecting DNA can be extended to new types of molecule using their attached DNA tags. Several applications of DNA tags are described next.",

Bio-barcode amplification (BCA), which has been developed by Nam and colleagues8, is a new streamlined method that achieves highly sensitive detection at attomolar concentrations without the need for PCR amplification. In BCA, the target protein to be detected is 'sandwiched' between two probes: a tagging probe and a capture probe (Fig. 1). Both probes contain antibodies, which bind to the target protein such that the protein is sandwiched between the probes. Two key innovations are that many copies of a DNA tag are attached to the tagging probe, and that tags can be removed for detection purposes using a simple denaturing process. BCA has been successfully applied to the detection of prostate-specific antigen (an indicator of prostate cancer and breast cancer8,9), amyloid-\u03b2-derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs; indicators of Alzheimer disease10) and interleukin 2 (a cytokine protein that is involved in inflammation and immune responses in humans11). Georganopoulou and colleagues10 quantified differences in ADDL levels in clinically realistic samples of cerebrospinal fluid that were taken from human tissue. Overall, they found a significantly higher (low femtomolar) concentration of ADDLs in diseased patients, compared with samples from control patients who had not been diagnosed with Alzheimer disease.",

In the cell, the genetic code supports both translation (whereby protein products encoded by DNA are synthesized) and evolution (whereby cycles of translation, mutation and selection produce better-adapted products in the form of evolved species). The ultimate goal of DNA-templated synthesis (DTS)13 is to emulate these processes in vitro in a parallel fashion. DTS can create polymers with strong binding affinity to a target of interest, such as a disease marker or toxin (Fig. 2). DTS offers several advantages over traditional methods for developing functional molecules, including parallelism, ease of purification and mutational evolution. Rosenbaum and Liu14 reported the first DTS of molecules that do not have a ribose backbone, which are called peptide nucleic acids (PNAs); these are valuable substitutes for DNA in environments where the backbone of DNA is prone to degradation, such as in therapeutic uses in living cells. Gartner et al.15 showed that DTS can be followed by in vitro selection for desired functional properties \u2014 in this case, a molecule that inhibits the activity of carbonic anhydrase. Carbonic anhydrase-driven reactions, which convert carbon dioxide and water into hydrogen ions and bicarbonate, have several functions in the body (such as maintaining an acidic environment in the stomach and transporting carbon dioxide by red blood cells) and so inhibitors of such reactions have therapeutic uses.",

Another challenge is to identify those pairs that do react. DNA tags solve both of these problems: the molecules to be paired have complementary regions on their tags so that they come together by hybridization, and sequencing of the tags provides the means to identify reactive pairs.

            "text": "Computing with DNA. In the applications described so far, DNA sequence has an informational role. Is computation possible for information stored in DNA? In essence, computation is the process of determining an output from a list of inputs, using elementary instructions, where the available instructions depend on the context of the computation. For example, a schoolchild can determine the sum of two multiple-digit input numbers written on paper, using a sequence of single-digit additions. By contrast, a computer calculates the sum of numbers in binary format, using the principles of Boolean logic. Computation is not, however, limited to paper or silicon media. Indeed, as Adleman21 showed (Fig. 3), DNA is an attractive medium because of its high information density. Inputs to the Adleman computation are DNA sequences that represent candidate solutions to a computational problem. The computation repeatedly prunes out incorrect solutions, so that, ultimately, the true solution is selected. This select-and-prune process is analogous to in vitro selection, except that sequences are selected on the basis of their information content rather than their functionality. In the largest experiment so far, Braich et al.22 reported a search-and-prune computation involving more than 1 million inputs, representing potential solutions to a problem of mathematical logic. Although this approach is not competitive with conventional computers, the work has inspired many creative approaches for DNA computation that exploit structure and folding pathways, which are described in later sections.",

Single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been used to realize tiny electronic transistors, which have potential for assembly into nanocircuits. There are several challenges to building a circuit from CNTs, however, including controlling the layout of the component CNTs and placing the wires to connect the components according to a specific pattern. DNA tags (and also tags made of PNA) offer great promise in meeting these challenges. DNA tags that are attached to CNTs can direct their assembly by binding a tag with its complement23. DNA strands have been used to spatially position CNTs, making it possible to assemble them into circuits24. In addition, ssDNA can be stretched across a surface to connect two electrodes by binding the ends of the ssDNA with complementary strands that are attached to the electrodes. Silver can then be deposited along the stretched DNA strand, to create a nanowire that connects the electrodes25,26.",

The double helix is just one possible conformation; structures might have branching helices that stem from junctions or loops (Fig. 4a). The stacking of adjacent base pairs causes short helices to be rigid, unlike ssDNA. Some DNA molecules enjoy further structural complexity, such as G quartets (Fig. 4b), which can fit snugly in crevices of proteins, and therefore can have high binding specificity for important protein targets. One DNA aptamer exploits a G-quartet structure to bind to thrombin and can inhibit thrombin-catalysed fibrin-clot formation in vitro in samples of human plasma32.",

Nanobarcodes are distinguishable, using fluorescence spectroscopy, by their ratios of red to green fluorophores. As proof of concept, nanobarcodes were used to detect the presence or absence of DNA fragments from four pathogens (Bacillus anthracis, Francisella tularensis, Ebola virus and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus) in a prepared solution with a detection limit of 620 attomoles.

Shih et al.43 used this approach to construct the first rigid 3D structure, crafting an octahedron from a single long (1,669 nucleotide) strand and five shorter (30\u201335 nucleotide) strands. The short molecules bind so as to form appropriately placed rigid DX structures, which become edges of the octahedron. Rothemund42 illustrated the generality of a different method, known as scaffolded origami, by constructing smiley faces, a world map and many other complex 2D patterns (Fig. 5c). To design a pattern, Rothemund uses a computational tool to plan the layout of a single long DNA strand, called a scaffold strand, which fills in the desired pattern row by row \u2014 similar to laying out yarn to create a string picture. Short staple strands are then designed, which can hybridize to segments of the scaffold strand that are juxtaposed on adjacent rows, crossing over from one row to another in a manner resembling DX molecules. The staple strands therefore hold the pattern together rigidly when combined with the scaffold strand in solution.",

The 'program' for doing this is not a traditional sequence of instructions, but rather is implicitly specified by interconnection patterns (which function as sticky ends) between pieces. The DNA lattices and nanotubes described above are examples of periodic structures, the assembly of which is programmed by their sticky ends.

In a typical case, DNA molecules are initially bound to each other, but have some single-stranded regions. When a new DNA molecule is introduced that can bind with a single-stranded region, it can displace base pairs by a process called branch migration. This displacement can cause the potential energy trapped in loops of the initial structure to be released, thereby providing fuel for DNA devices, such as DNA tweezers59, and can also cause the movement of the DNA molecules. Simmel and Dittmer60 provide a comprehensive overview of several feats of motion by DNA molecules, including unidirectional walking and movement along a track. Such devices might aid in the transport of tiny molecules in a nanoscale system. Alternatively, changes in buffer conditions, which are achieved by introducing positively charged ions, can cause a DNA helix to come apart and switch from its usual B form (in which the helix twists to the right) to the less standard Z form (in which the helix twists to the left)61,62. The addition of enzymes that cleave DNA also causes a change in the environment and a corresponding change in the stable structure of the collection of DNA molecules, which could be used to detect the presence of the enzymes. The following examples highlight work that directly explores the potential for applications of nanodevices that exploit folding pathways.",

To detect a target DNA strand, the beacon initially forms a hairpin structure closed by a short helix, in which the loop sequence includes the complement of the target strand. One end of the sequence is linked to a fluorophore, whereas the other end is linked to a quencher. Binding of complement to target causes the hairpin to open, thereby separating the fluorophore and quencher, and causing a fluorescent signal to be emitted. Hamaguchi et al.65, and Nutiu and Li66 showed that features of molecular beacons and DNA aptamers could be integrated to obtain devices that signal on detection of proteins. For example, by incorporating the aptamer into the hairpin of the molecular beacon, the hairpin sequence can bind to the protein target of the aptamer, so that the hairpin opens and a fluorescent signal ensues. Stojanovic et al.67 showed that, by combining both an aptamer for a reagent and a DNA enzyme in a single strand, it is possible to bring the enzyme and reagent together, thereby catalysing a reaction and detecting the signal.",

Their drug is a short antisense DNA that can bind to the mRNA transcribed from harmful genes, such as cancer-causing genes, thereby preventing their expression. The device progresses through several diagnostic states, which indicate the outcomes (positive or negative) of the diagnostic tests performed so far. These states are concretely represented by intermediate structures formed by the DNA components of the device. In the initial structure, the drug sequence is included in the loop of a hairpin closed by a long helix. On each positive diagnosis, the helix becomes shorter (through the action of an enzyme and other participating DNA strands), so that the loop sequence is completely cleaved from its closing helix and is therefore released only if all diagnoses are positive.",

One of the strands used in their device is the DNA aptamer for thrombin, with additional unpaired bases, called sticky ends, which do not interfere with the formation of the thrombin-binding G-quartet structure of the aptamer. This DNA aptamer is used to bind thrombin, thereby preventing it from performing other functions. To release thrombin, a second DNA strand is introduced, which binds with the sticky end of the aptamer and then displaces thrombin. A third strand can be introduced that binds with the second; this releases the thrombin-binding strand, so that it once again binds with thrombin. By alternating addition of the second and third strands, the device can repeatedly cycle between its binding and releasing functions.",

Two types of probe are used to detect a protein target, which, in the illustration, consists of amyloid-\u03b2-derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs) in human cerebrospinal fluid. Tagging probes consist of a gold nanoparticle (yellow) to which an antibody for the target (blue) and complements of DNA tags (black) are attached. DNA tags (green) are then hybridized to their complements. Capture probes consist of magnetic beads (blue circles) to which antibodies (pink) are attached. On exposure to the magnetic beads, the target, ADDL, is caught on the capture probes (step 1). It is then 'sandwiched' between capture and tagging probes, by binding to antibodies on both types of probe (step 2). The resulting complexes are separated from solution using a magnetic field and washed (step 3), at which point the tags denature from their complements. The concentration of ADDL in the sample can then be estimated on the basis of the amount of tag that is released. To this end, Georganolpoulou et al.10 used scanometric DNA detection (step 4). In this method, tag DNA is captured on a glass slide, which has been spotted with DNA strands that are complementary to part of the tag. Gold nanoparticles (Au), which contain DNA strands complementary to the remaining (unhybridized) part of the DNA tag, then sandwich the tag between a slide and nanoparticle. The nanoparticles are coated with silver (Ag), and the light intensity scattered from each spot is measured.

A set of three DNA templates, each the concatenation of three sequences that are complementary to three distinct tags, is initially synthesized. These templates represent the three macrocycles to be synthesized. Attached to each initial template is a single unit (X; a lysine derivative) that will form part of each macrocycle. The macrocycles are then synthesized in a multi-step process, in which each step increases the length of the synthesized molecule by one. In the first illustrated synthesis step, the tags attached to reagents A, B and C (yellow, green and dark pink, respectively) hybridize to each of the three templates, bringing the X unit into proximity with the A, B and C units (one per template). The units then conjugate with the X unit by amine acylation, to produce synthesized molecules of length 2. The process is repeated (synthesis steps 2 and 3) to produce three synthesized four-unit macrocycles. The biotin present on the tags allows the macrocycles to be purified by capturing them on streptavidin beads and then releasing them. Following synthesis, one macrocycle is selected for function, and its tag reveals its identity.

Tiles assemble upwards from the blue frame, starting from the position marked with the red asterisk, forming patterned rows (c). Each tile is marked with either 0 or 1 (corresponding to the sticky ends of the DX molecule) on each of its four corners, and is added to the assembly in such a way that the mark on its lower-left corner matches the mark on the adjoining tile immediately to its left in the row below it, and similarly the mark on its lower-right corner matches the mark on the adjoining tile immediately to its right in the row below it. Crucial to the success of the construction is that the two sticky ends on the lower end of a DX molecule (tile) bind cooperatively to the upper sticky ends of the two matching DX molecules (tiles) below it; a tile with just one matching sticky end is considered to be too weak to persist. Analogously, if working on a puzzle, by moving inward from one corner of the frame and ensuring that each inserted puzzle piece properly connects with two pieces already in the puzzle, mistakes can be reduced. The proof proposed by Winfree to show that DNA self-assembly is able to perform general-purpose computation builds on the classical work of Wang82, and relies on the cooperative binding of DNA tiles.

B | A folding pathway of the hybridization chain reaction68, the initial structure of which consists of two types of hairpin, closed by long helices.

The first type, H1, has a helix formed from complementary sequences (b and b*), a hairpin loop formed by sequence c and an unpaired sequence (a) emanating from the 5\u2032 end of the helix. The second type, H2, has a similar helix with reverse polarity, but differs in its hairpin loop, which is the sequence a* complementary to a. Bb | On introduction of the target sequence (a*b*), the target binds to the unpaired 'a' region of an H1 hairpin and opens the stem through a branch migration, leaving cb* unpaired. Bc | This unpaired region then binds to and opens an H2 hairpin, exposing a new unpaired region (a*b*) on H2. This unpaired a*b* region is similar to the initial target sequence, forming the basis for a chain reaction that produces 'polymers' of alternating H1 and H2 components. C | A computation for disease diagnosis and drug delivery71. The inputs are all identical, consisting of a hairpin structure with a long helix, and a drug sequence encapsulated in the hairpin loop. The computation process is similar to a search-and-prune computation (Fig. 3), except that selection steps are replaced by diagnostic tests for disease indicators (high or low levels of expression of a gene) in the environment. Each positive diagnosis causes shortening of the hairpin helices, so that the drug is released if all diagnoses are positive. Therefore, in this computation, the inputs change at each step, in contrast to the search-and-prune computation of Fig. 3; this highlights the wide range of ways in which DNA-based computations can proceed.

Addition of a blue sequence (a quencher, Q) causes the blue and grey regions to bind, ultimately disrupting the G-quartet structure of the thrombin aptamer and causing thrombin to be released. On addition of the green sequence (a remover, R), the blue and green sequences bind, displacing the black\u2013red aptamer sequence through branch migration, and causing thrombin to be bound again. Further cycles are possible, by cycling addition of blue and green strands. Panel b reproduced with permission from Ref. 68 \u00a9 (2004) American Association for the Advancement of Science.
