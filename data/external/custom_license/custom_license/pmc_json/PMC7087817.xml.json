Over the last 10 years there have been a large number of outbreaks, many unreported, and hundreds of millions of poultry birds have died of the disease or through culling to prevent its spread (Alexander 2007; Alexander and Brown 2009; Kawaoka 2012). In 2012, human H5N1 cases continue to be reported from Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Egypt, Indonesia and Vietnam, countries which are either enzootically infected, or have land borders with one (WHO 2012). Sporadic and more persistent spread extends from these areas to Japan and the Koreas eastwards, and to Europe and the Mediterranean westwards (Dubey et al. 2012; Marinova-Petkova et al. 2012; Sakoda et al. 2012). A deadly human influenza pandemic involving H5N1 therefore remains possible, although international concern and funding is falling.",

Membership of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and avian influenza control are correlated (Pavade et al. 2011). These conventional disease control methods, designed by and for economically developed countries, are encapsulated in the World Organisation for Animal Health\u2019s (OIE) codes, standards, decisions and guidelines (cf. OIE 2012). Underlying them is a set of medicalised \u2018outbreak\u2019 narratives focused on contamination, containment, and eradication (Rosenberg 1992; Scoones and Forster 2008; Wald 2008), a framing which has resonated with national health security concerns and media interests in the developed world. From 2003, when the virus reappeared in southeast Asia, to around 2008, the response to avian influenza was consequently cast as a global emergency, and in the wake of a deadly outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) emanating from Hong Kong in 2002\u20132003, manifested in significant international efforts focused on affected geographical areas, which have cost around US$1 billion annually (UNSIC/World Bank 2010). This response has reflected high income country approaches, emphasising disease surveillance, wide area and local culling, vaccination, biosecurity on farms and in supply chains, and behaviour change communications.",

This paper draws on improved understandings of the epizoosis over the last 10 years to investigate how such innovative approaches might be generated. Accepting that approaches developed in economically advanced countries have proved difficult to replicate with any sustained success in poorer regions, the paper argues that social, economic, and political factors have been primary in disease persistence, and many aspects of its spread, and that these dynamics have been occluded by technically orientated, emergency responses which have focused on disease outbreaks rather than their underlying causes. In order to respond more effectively to avian influenza, it is necessary not only to examine and take into account the dynamic biology of the virus, and the wider ecological systems in which it is in action, but also the social, economic and political environments in which the pathogen and responses to it land.",

Similarly, if more networked, locally embedded arrangements are to be developed, which will necessarily involve wider expertise (Scoones 2010a), diverse forms knowledge will need to engage (Parkes 2011), and political negotiations to find balances between differing goals and interests will be inevitable.",

Here potent national level political factors include the livelihoods of poor people, commercial agribusiness concerns, and the state of relations between people and their governments. Internationally, the health security and economic concerns of wealthy nations are also relevant, as are current shifts in global economic power and related conceptions of development. The paper next considers the current configuration of institutions and expertise arranged in response to avian influenza, and finds it ill-equipped to address or engage with the negotiations that are inherent in processes associated with formulating any \u2018unconventional\u2019 responses. In conclusion the paper suggests that it is only by adopting more open and participatory approaches, which encourage rather than suppress negotiation and debate, that any innovative responses will be generated, and that such plural, negotiated approaches offer further benefits related to equity, sustainability, democratic accountability, and managing uncertainty.",

In some cases, governments have little authority to set or implement credible policy. In Indonesia, for example, small poultry farmers have experience of a catalogue of misguided government interventions dating back over 40 years (Rusastra et al. 1988; Yusdja 1996; Yusdja et al. 2004), and particularly in the context of rising democracy, unpopular centrally determined interventions have been regularly challenged or ignored. In Thailand, as discussed above, policy was unduly influenced by business interests. In other cases, governments can ignore popular opinion and enforce ineffective policies. Few Vietnamese farmers, for example, have been consulted on any policies or plans, and have been coerced into compliance with inappropriate vaccination and culling programmes (Vu 2009). More prosaically, low commitment from some governments is understandable. Many lower income countries face more immediate and dangerous health threats than avian influenza, and building the veterinary, animal production, and laboratory infrastructures required for any effective surveillance and response systems are long-term, politically unrewarding processes.",

These are particularly potent in the case of avian influenza as a result of the mingling of national security concerns and more normative, development-orientated, global public health agendas. Given the human pandemic potential of the virus, and the potential economic effects of such an event, avian influenza surveillance and response efforts are easily perceived as designed primarily to benefit wealthy nations (Calain 2007a, b). Indonesia\u2019s withholding of human H5N1 virus samples between 2007 and 2009, claiming that they would be used to make vaccines unaffordable to Indonesia, made plain the nature, scale, and importance of possible contestations (Fidler 2007, 2008, 2010; Sedyaningsih et al. 2008; Elbe 2010). As global economic orders reconfigure, novel conceptions of international relations and development are emerging, remote from existing centre-periphery models (Appadurai 1996; Sivaramakrishnan and Agrawal 2003; Sassen 2007), and beyond responding to avian influenza, global authority is increasingly fragile, and increasingly subject to negotiation, even given widespread implementation of the 2005 International Health Regulations.",

Yet, as discussed below, the current configuration of institutions and expertise, internationally and nationally, is poorly equipped to do this. With rapidly expanding, lightly regulated, poultry production sectors now linked with avian influenza incidence and persistence (Gilbert et al. 2008; Hogerwerf et al. 2010), and mixes of different farming systems with inconsistent biosecurity standards in close proximity implicated in inhibiting disease control (Food and Agriculture Organization [FAO] 2011), which organisations, for example, nationally or internationally, have the authority, credibility or inclination to negotiate with, or even to broker negotiations among, a food and farming industry that ranges from billion dollar turnover transnational corporations to subsistence level smallholders?",

Likewise, if public and private actors are to be better co-ordinated, and if any long-term demand for disease control is to be encouraged among poultry producers, traders, governments and, perhaps most importantly, consumers, the competing goals, interests and concerns of different groups need to be recognised, along with the inevitability and importance of wide-ranging, transparent, and equitable negotiations among and between them.",

This uncertainty is compounded by the variable manifestations of the disease in humans and animals, and embedded and propagated in response efforts (Fish et al. 2011). In these circumstances, the current science-based configuration of the response, which is based on rationalist, reductive-aggregate approaches to risk management, is insufficient (Stirling and Scoones 2009). A risk management-based approach to surveillance, response planning, and disease control that depends on expert authorities assessing hazards, devising rational management strategies, and communicating with lay publics, fails in the face of the uncertainties that the virus and the disease present, and the ignorance that persists regarding aspects of both. Treating ignorance and uncertainty as risk, however, is not just an inadequate response to incomplete knowledge. Such processes also narrow response and policy options, limit the possibility of democratic engagement, and make scientific advice vulnerable to unacknowledged political dynamics (Stirling 2010). Professionally, institutionally, and culturally, then, the current configuration of the response is not just ill-equipped to foster or broker innovative, unconventional approaches, but actually inhibits their development.",

First, it is evident that if increasingly prosperous and urbanised populations are to consume increasing amounts of poultry, highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses such as H5N1 will present us not just with a long-term problem, but a permanent one. Low pathogenicity avian viruses circulate widely in aquatic wild birds and poultry, and some H5 and H7 low pathogenicity viruses have the potential to mutate to highly pathogenic ones. Furthermore, as the 2009\u20132010 H1N1 pandemic demonstrated, avian viruses and swine viruses, which are subject to the same drivers of increased meat consumption and mixed farming systems, have a lively affinity. The influenza virus\u2014in birds, pigs and humans\u2014is therefore unlikely ever to be eradicated. No \u2018control at source\u2019 is possible. The best we can do is to learn to co-exist.",

The benefits of allowing plural, self-determined responses go beyond fostering innovation and the sustainability that accompanies democratic engagement. Accepting, or at least considering, a wider range of viewpoints reduces uncertainty. Surprises are still possible, but if as many options as possible have been considered, surprises are less likely, and in the wake of wide-ranging and open consultations, unpleasant surprises are less politically catastrophic. A more open, participatory stance also increases accountability and makes more explicit the social dynamics and political pressures acting on, and among, scientific policy advice. Opening up rather than closing down negotiations around alternative and complementary responses also brings into focus the distributive effects of any interventions. By considering who gains and who loses as a result of any interventions, or the lack of them, more equitable, and therefore more sustainable, responses can be devised.",
