            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), an illness identified in 2003 that spread throughout the world for several months, re-awakened nightmares of a lethal global pandemic. Caused by the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), therapeutic options are limited, and fears of renewed outbreaks highlight the paramount importance of understanding its pathogenicity. Reporting in Nature Medicine, a multinational research team now provides a molecular explanation for the high lethality associated with SARS, and highlight a potential therapeutic strategy for tackling SARS and possibly other respiratory disease viruses.",

Angiotensin II, which is produced through the action of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), has been identified as a potent vasoconstrictor that can aggravate lung injury and produce lung oedema.",

Now, by using mice deficient for ACE2, Kuba et al. provide the first in vivo evidence for the importance of this enzyme in SARS-CoV replication, and show that infection with SARS leads to downregulation of ACE2. The authors identified the SARS-CoV Spike protein as an interaction partner for ACE2, and demonstrated that recombinant Spike exacerbates acute lung injury through down-modulation of ACE2 and subsequent accumulation of angiotensin II. Recombinant ACE2, as well as angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1R) inhibitors, which are already in clinical use for the control of blood pressure, were shown to protect against Spike-mediated lung injury in mice.",

Furthermore, the SARS-CoV\u2013ACE2 interaction might also provide a molecular explanation for the long-standing puzzle as to why SARS-CoV is so much more lethal than other coronavirus infections, which are responsible for \u223c30% of common colds.",
