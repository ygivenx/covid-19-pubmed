In the course of further evolution, a glycosylation site at the head domain at position 160 is lost, and there are 2 other unique substitutions (K193N, T193D) in the vicinity of the receptor-binding site.

In the glycan array, the R227S substitution did not affect binding of H5N8 HA to fucosylated sialosides (Figure 7, panel E), but the Q222K substitution, alone or in combination with the R227S substitution, inhibited binding of fucosylated receptors (Figure 7, panels D, F). We conclude that the identity of residue 222 plays a crucial role in binding of fucosylated sialosides, regardless of the background of highly pathogenic influenza A virus H5 protein.

We have shown that amino acid substitutions K222Q and S227R in the receptor-binding site of early clade 2.3.4.4 HAs are required for this change in receptor-binding specificity. HA residues K222 and S227 are extremely conserved among all clades of highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses; the double substitution K222Q/S227R was introduced only at the root of clade 2.3.4.4 (Figure 5). Structural analysis of a clade 1 HA indicates that the close proximity of the conserved K222 side chain and the fucose moiety of 3\u2032SLeX most likely destabilizes their interaction (29). Modeling indicates that such destabilization is still present in H5N12.3.4 HAs but is absent in H5N8 HAs that contain Q222 and R227 residues (Figure 8).",

However, additional introduction of an arginine at position 227 (double substitution K222Q/S227R) in H5N12.3.4 HA was sufficient to cause a glycan array binding profile nearly identical to that of H5N8 HA. Substitution S227R might result in the 220-loop interacting with the conserved loop at the N terminus of the 190-helix through 2 hydrogen bonds between R227 and N186 (Figure 8, panel C). This interaction, which potentially limits mobility of the 220-loop, might contribute to stabilizing the receptor-binding site in a conformation that enables binding of fucosylated receptors. R227 was required for binding of fucosylated sialosides in the background of H5N12.3.4 HA, but not H5N8 HA (Figure 7). Consistent with our findings, HAs of the Taiwanese/North American branch of clade 2.3.4.4 viruses, which obtained reverse substitution R227S (Figure 5), also efficiently bind fucosylated receptors (23).",

HA binding displays a clear receptor fine specificity, but substrate fine specificity of NAs has not been extensively investigated. A recent report showed that all NA genotypes (only N4 was not tested) displayed relatively poor digestion of fucosylated receptors (44). Possibly because of tight binding of such receptors by clade 2.3.4.4 viruses, N1 of highly pathogenic H5 viruses might have lost an unknown advantage over other NA genotypes in creating an optimal HA/NA balance, which lead to the remarkable success of novel H5Nx virus reassortants within this clade.",
