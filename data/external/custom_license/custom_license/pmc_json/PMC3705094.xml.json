This relationship between stress and immunity is particularly significant in the older population (Ginaldi et al. 2001) because of an age-related reduction in bodily immune functions. In respiratory infections, influenza viruses are among the most studied because of their significant impact on morbidity and mortality in the older population (Hoyert et al. 1999; Yap et al. 2004).",

Studies in western countries on elderly caregivers with high levels of stress have found prolonged endocrine and immune dysregulation, including alterations in vaccine response (Gravenstein et al. 1994; Kiecolt-Glaser et al. 1996). Older adults with poorer responses to vaccines also have higher rates of clinical illness including influenza virus infections (Gravenstein et al. 1994). As influenza vaccine efficacy is much lower in the elderly when compared with young adults (Berstein et al. 1999), chronic stress could further decrease the vaccine efficacy in this population which could be of public health significance. With emerging viral infections such as SARS and \u201cavian flu,\u201d and the aging of post-war baby boomers (in a Western context), research aimed at understanding the various influences on the health and immune functions of older adults is of considerable public health importance.",

Culture- or race-specific studies are important because stress experiences may differ among different cultures, and it has been shown that racial and cultural factors are important determinants of stress experience (Connell and Gibson 1997; Valentine et al. 1998). For example, members of collectivistic cultures that exist in Asia are associated with less caregiver strain (Garnaccia and Parra 1996) and receive better social support from their family networks (Ell 1996; Ohaeri 1998; McCabe et al. 2003). Besides possible cultural influences on the caregiving stress experience, variable seasonal patterns of influenza in the tropics and sub-tropics has led some to raise uncertainty on the immunogenicity of influenza vaccines in these regions (Hsu et al. 1996; Thorpe et al. 2006). Furthermore, a study conducted in Taiwan showed that there were ethnic differences in immune responses to the hepatitis B vaccine, suggesting that host factors pertaining to ethnic origin could be a factor in determining immune responses to vaccination (Govaert et al. 1994).",

In particular, although evidence supports a relationship between psychological stress and secondary immune responses to immunization, the evidence is weak for the relationship between chronic stress and the primary immune response.

Our study showed that even in caregivers who receive influenza vaccination, the effects may be attenuated through decreased lymphocytes and cytokine production. Thus, caregivers may suffer from a double disadvantage of both decreased access to vaccine and reduced effectiveness from the vaccine itself. We also showed that the decreased immune response to influenza vaccination associated with chronic stress is present in a Chinese population residing in a tropical region where influenza is a common and important cause of mortality and morbidity, especially in the elderly population. As a result, there is a need to study the unmet needs of this population, in particular, their psychological and social needs. Further research, using rigorous experimental designs, should be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of social or psychological interventions in increasing protection to both with and without disease vaccination against influenza and other infectious diseases in this population.",
