HCA7 cells have previously been reported to express high levels of COX-2 with abundant PGE2 generation (Sheng et al, 1997). Apoptosis was quantified by fluorescence labelling with FITC-conjugated antibody to Annexin V and propidium iodide assessed by flow cytometry (Figure 1). Following a 24 h treatment with the selective COX-2 inhibitor SC236 (5 \u03bcM), a significant decrease (P=0.01) in HCA7 cells viability was observed (Figure 1B), mirrored by a doubling of the proportion of the cell population gated to the early apoptosis phase (Annexin V positive, propidium iodide negative) (Figure 1B). The observed increase in apoptosis at low micromolar doses of SC236 was prevented by co-administration of exogenous PGE2 (1 \u03bcM), whereas more marked increases in apoptosis seen with higher doses of SC236 were not rescued. A similar effect was noted with regard to effects on cell proliferation (see Supplementary Figure S1). The ability of PGE2 to promote cell survival confirmed that at low micromolar doses the effects of SC236 are largely dependant on its ability to inhibit COX-2.",

However, a potential function in the regulation of cell death and viability in cancer has not been explored to date. A comparison of our expression data set with another recently published HDONA experiment (Levitt et al, 2004) (evaluating selective COX-2 inhibition in a breast cell line) revealed a cluster of genes regulated by COX-2 in both systems (see Supplementary data; Table S1) and differential expression of DRAK2 once again featured as a strong signal.

To test this hypothesis further, five patients with newly diagnosed CRC (not taking aspirin or NSAIDS) were recruited to a pilot study. Endoscopic biopsies of tumour tissue were obtained before and after a short course (5\u20137 days) of treatment with the COX-2-selective inhibitor rofecoxib at a dose of 25 mg daily, a dose that has been demonstrated to selectively inhibit COX-2 in vivo (Ehrich et al, 1999). The study was conducted before the withdrawal of rofecoxib by the manufacturer. qRT-PCR demonstrated an induction in DRAK2 expression (Figure 4A; mean 2.5-fold increase, P=0.01) in tumour from each of the patients treated with rofecoxib, reflective of the changes seen with COX-2 inhibition in vitro. The expression of a panel of additional genes was also evaluated for comparative purposes (Figure 4B). Although no significant change in several genes that modulate apoptosis (Bax, Bcl-xl) was observed, a significant decrease in VEGF expression was noted, with a mean reduction of close to 40% (P=0.01). This pro-angiogenic factor has previously been linked to COX-2 activity and reduced VEGF expression has been observed in animal models following treatment with rofecoxib (Yao et al, 2003). This finding provided additional validation of the suppression of COX-2 activity in the tumours of these patients.",

We suspected DRAK2 expression was already significantly suppressed in HCA7 cells, given high levels of COX-2 expression whereas HT-29 cells showed lower levels of COX-2 with higher levels of DRAK2 expression. Following transient transfection of HT-29 cells with a commercially available sequence validated siRNA to DRAK2, significant repression of DRAK2 transcription was seen (Figure 5A). To counteract the effects of low transfection efficiency and maximise detection of a phenotype associated with DRAK2 silencing, a GFP expression vector was co-transfected to \u2018gate'-transfected or \u2018silenced' cells in subsequent assays to quantify cell survival using an established method (Vezina et al, 2001). The percentage of viable cells (without 7-ADD uptake) and non-viable cells (with 7-ADD uptake) was calculated in mock-transfected cells and in DRAK2 siRNA-transfected cells selected (gated) by GFP fluorescence. Loss of cell viability was observed in mock-transfected HT-29 cells following treatment with both SC236 and staurosporine (Figure 5B). In contrast, the siRNA-transfected (GFP-gated) cells showed no loss of cell viability following treatment with the COX-2 inhibitor SC236. They did however still show a significant loss of viability with staurosporine, suggesting a specific effect on the pathway involved in the action of SC236.",

Enhanced COX-2 expression in cells alters susceptibility to tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand by reduction in membrane death receptors (Tang et al, 2002) and may also alter the threshold for intrinsic pathway activation (Tang et al, 2002). Over-expression of COX-2 leads to the generation of prostanoids, particularly PGE2, and signalling through the various EP receptors, several of which have been implicated in carcinogenesis (Watanabe et al, 1999; Sonoshita et al, 2001; Mutoh et al, 2002). PGE2 stimulates TCF-\u03b2-catenin-mediated gene transcription (Castellone et al, 2005; Shao et al, 2005; Eisinger et al, 2007), possibly by activation of EP2 and EP4 receptors (Fujino et al, 2002). Some of the important effects of PGE2 are probably also related to its ability to transactivate the epidermal growth factor receptor through a number of distinct mechanisms (Pai et al, 2002; Shao et al, 2003; Al-Salihi et al, 2007). It seems likely therefore that prostaglandins generated by CRC cells do not exert their activity by a single mechanism but have a range of downstream signalling targets.",

Specific studies of differential gene expression in colon cancer cells (using suppressive subtractive hybridisation and differential screening) have previously demonstrated altered expression of genes involved in cell proliferation and viability (Zhang and DuBois, 2001), however high NSAID doses and long time points make a direct comparison with our expression studies difficult. We chose to look at early time points following treatment with the highly selective COX-2 inhibitor SC236 to identify crucial early responses. COX-2 independent effects of SC236 have been described (He et al, 2006). However, we chose to use SC236 at a dose which was associated with only modest changes in rates of apoptosis but where we observed rescue by co-incubation with PGE2, in the belief that study of a more subtle but specific phenotypic change would yield more significant findings.",

This predominantly nuclear serine\u2013threonine kinase has similarity to the DAP kinases and is involved (at least in certain cell types) in initiation of apoptosis (Sanjo et al, 1998). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of our expression data (Supplementary Figure S2) selected a cluster of genes showing a similar pattern of upregulation with COX-2 inhibition. This cluster of genes have either known nuclear localisation within the cell or have a bipartite nuclear localisation signal, which suggests their ability to traffic to the nucleus. Many of these are known to be involved in transcriptional regulation or in the induction or potentiation of apoptosis. Prior expression analyses have previously identified nuclear proteins as significantly over-represented in genes induced by aspirin treatment in colon cancer cells (Hardwick et al, 2004) and a mechanism regulating the nuclear trafficking of DRAK2 has recently been suggested (Kuwahara et al, 2008).",

Both COX-2 and DRAK2 have been implicated in the modulation of T-lymphocyte function, with opposing phenotypic consequences. Activated T cells in patients with SLE markedly upregulate and sustain COX-2 expression and resist inactivation and cell death (Xu et al, 2004). Indeed, COX-2 expression has been shown to mediate lethal T-cell activation (Brewer et al, 2003). By contrast, over-expression of DRAK2 in activated T cells enhances apoptosis in the presence of IL-2 (Mao et al, 2006), and studies in mice with targeted disruption of DRAK2 have demonstrated that this protein is an important negative regulator of T-cell activation, raising the threshold for activation through the T-cell receptor (McGargill et al, 2004; Friedrich et al, 2005) and acting as an important regulator of T cells response and survival (Schaumburg et al, 2007; McGargill et al, 2008).",

In addition to in vivo evidence from DRAK2 transgenic mice (Mao et al, 2006), induction of DRAK2 in vitro in a variety of contexts and cell types augments apoptosis (Sanjo et al, 1998; Kuwahara et al, 2006; Mao et al, 2006). We also show that silencing DRAK2 expression in HT29 cells promotes cell survival and abrogates the effects of a COX-2 inhibitor in vitro. These findings confirm published observations on the effect of DRAK2 silencing by RNAi on susceptibility of rat colon cancer cells to UV-induced apoptosis (Kuwahara et al, 2006). We also recently observed that DRAK2 may be important in the ability of COX-2 to protect cardiomyocytes from doxorubicin-induced apoptosis (Neilan et al, 2006), suggesting that the modulation of DRAK2 expression may not be confined to cancer but may also be important in the positive effects of COX-2 on cell viability and tissue healing in other systems. For the moment, the precise mechanisms by which DRAK2 impacts on cell survival are unclear. Recent observations suggest that the ribosomal kinase p70S6, involved in cell-cycle regulation, is a substrate for DRAK2 (Mao et al, 2009), highlighting a possible involvement in regulation of cell-cycle dynamics. In an analysis of publicly available expression data (Whitfield et al, 2002), we have noted that DRAK2 forms part of a cluster of genes showing similar cyclical changes in expression with cell-cycle periodicity in HeLa cells (Supplementary Figure S3; Supplementary Table 2). There is an interesting degree of overlap (summarised concisely in Supplementary Figure 4) between this panel and COX-2-regulated genes identified by our gene expression analysis and a number of other gene discovery studies that examined the effects of COX inhibitors (Iizaka et al, 2002; Levitt et al, 2004).",

One of the most consistent observations about COX-2 in cancer is its contribution in vivo to the risk of systemic metastases (Tomozawa et al, 2000; Yao et al, 2004). This fact likely explains the impaired survival observed in individuals whose tumours express COX-2 (Sheehan et al, 1999). Previous observations about the effects of DAP kinase (the best-characterised member of the kinase family to which DRAK2 belongs) in cancer cells may provide a unifying explanation, linking the ability of this DAP kinase to regulate apoptosis to a suppression of metastatic potential (Inbal et al, 1997). The most plausible explanation is that the enhanced cell survival conferred by DRAK2 silencing (by COX-2) provide a resistance to various forms of cell death and possibly crucially to anoikis (matrix detachment-induced cell death) (Hofmann et al, 2007), the form of cell death that may be the most important in deciding the viability of circulating tumour cells and their ability to form distant metastases.",
