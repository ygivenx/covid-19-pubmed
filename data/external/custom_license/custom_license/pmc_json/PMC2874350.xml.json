These patients had no meningismus, focal neurologic deficit, hypotension, respiratory distress, or metabolic disturbances. Brain computed tomography (CT) scans showed no acute cerebral lesion. CSF analyses showed no bacterial or viral pathogen or pleocytosis.

            "text": "Our findings agree with studies of influenza-associated encephalopathy in children. Influenza virus is rarely detected in the CSF, and pleocytosis is often absent (1,2,4\u20136). High levels of cytokines (e.g., IL-6, soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 1) can be consistently found in CSF/blood specimens, correlating with disease severity and outcomes (hyperactivated cytokine response is absent in febrile seizure associated with influenza) (2\u20134,8). We found a broader range of cytokines/chemokines being activated (7); for certain cytokines (CXCL8/IL-8, CCL2/MCP-1), the CSF concentrations were 3\u00d7 those in plasma. IL-6, CXCL8/IL-8, CCL2/MCP-1 and CXCL10/IP-10 have been shown to play pathogenic roles in CNS viral infections, cerebral injury, and acute brain syndrome in susceptible patients (7,9,12). The high CSF/plasma ratios suggest that for some cytokines, activation within the CNS might have occurred along with respiratory-tract and systemic productions (cytokines are not detected in CSF normally; (Table 2) (4,7\u201310,12). Resident macrophages/monocytes, astrocytes, microglial and endothelial cells in the CNS are shown to release cytokines/chemokines when stimulated by viral/influenza infection; activation mechanisms without involving overt CNS invasion have been suggested (1,4,9,12\u201314). Cytokines may cause direct neurotoxic effects, cerebral metabolism changes, or breakdown of the blood-brain-barrier (endothelial injury) to produce symptoms (1\u20134,8,12\u201314). Whether early viral suppression by antivirals can lead to attenuation of these cytokine responses and better outcomes warrants further study (7).",

However, only the active metabolite (OC) was detected in the CSF of patient 3; the CSF/plasma concentration ratio was 12%\u201313% (18.3/143.8 ng/mL) at 18-hours postdose. This degree of CSF penetration is similar to that observed among healthy patients, with a Cmax CSF/plasma concentration ratio of 3.5% (at \u22488 hours), and a ratio of \u224810% at 18 hours (concentration-time profiles for plasma/CSF differ). Assuming a similar ratio, the CSF OP concentration would have fallen below the assay\u2019s detection limit (0.25 ng/mL) by 18 hours (11,15). The low CSF drug-penetration, together with high cytokines in CSF and symptom progression despite drug withdrawal suggest that the manifestations of patient 3 may have been disease-related. Symptoms developed in patients 1 and 2 without antiviral exposure. Further investigations on the CNS effects of oseltamivir in the clinical setting are needed..",
