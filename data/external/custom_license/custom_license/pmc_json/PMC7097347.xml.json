However, both the WHO and the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) believe that the new virus is different from SARS coronavirus. Similarly, virologist John Oxford (Queen Mary, University of London, UK) commented that \u201cSARS was very quick off the mark infecting hospital staff etc and this new virus does not ... appear to be in the same 'big bang' group.\u201d (BBC News, 24 Sep 2012.)",
