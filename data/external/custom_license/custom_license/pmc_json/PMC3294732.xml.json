These include human metapneumovirus (HMPV) (1), severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2013associated coronavirus (2), human coronavirus (HCoV) NL63 (3,4), HCoV HKU1 (5), and, most recently, human bocavirus (HBoV) (6). The latter belongs to the Parvoviridae family and is most closely related to bovine parvovirus and canine minute virus (CnMV), which are members of the genus Bocavirus (6). Parvovirus B19 and HBoV are the only 2 parvoviruses known to be pathogenic to humans, but the relevance of HBoV infection in the clinical setting is not known.",

PCR amplification of a region of the NP-1 gene and the 3\u00b4 portion of the VP1/2 capsid gene of HBoV was performed. Briefly, 10 \u03bcL DNA was added to a 50-\u03bcL PCR mix containing 2 IU Supertherm polymerase (JMR Holdings, Kent, UK), 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 200 \u03bcmol/L each dNTP, and 0.2 \u03bcmol/L primers NP-1 s1 (5\u00b4-TAACTGCTCCAGCAAGTCCTCCA) and NP-1 as1 (5\u00b4-GGAAGCTCTGTGTTGACTGAAT). To improve sensitivity, a second seminested reaction with 2.5 \u03bcL outer product and NP-1 as1 primer and NP-1 s2 (5\u00b4-CTCACCTGCGAGCTCTGTAAGTA) primer was performed at an annealing temperature of 55\u00b0C. Negative controls were used, and appropriate measures were taken to prevent contamination (7). Samples with an NP-1\u2013specific PCR product of 368 bp were confirmed by amplifying a 980-bp product of the VP1/2 capsid gene in a similar seminested PCR amplification protocol (primers VP s1 5\u00b4-GCACTTCTGTATCAGATGCCTT, VP as1 5\u00b4-CGTGGTATGTAGGCGTGTAG, and VP s2 5\u00b4-CTTAGAACTGGTGAGAGCACTG). A selection of the inner VP1/2 amplicons obtained from samples taken over the year were sequenced directly and aligned in ClustalX, and a phylogenetic tree was constructed with the Kimura 2-parameter neighbor-joining method with 1,000 bootstrap resamplings. Comparative sequences were obtained from GenBank and included HBoV isolate st1 (DQ000495), HBoV isolate st2 (DQ000496), and a CnMV isolate (NC_004442). Nucleotide sequences from this study were deposited into GenBank (DQ317539\u2013DQ317561).",

A diagnosis of pneumonia or lower respiratory tract infection was made for 30 (86%) children. Thirteen (37%) HBoV-positive children required admission to the intensive care unit. Comorbid conditions were present in 22 children: cystic fibrosis (1), spinal muscular atrophy type 1 (4), Down syndrome (4), cardiac abnormalities (5), and HIV infection (8). Co-infection with a range of viral and bacterial organisms was a common feature in HBoV-positive children and was found in 14 (37%) samples. These organisms included cytomegalovirus (4), respiratory syncytial virus (2), adenovirus (1), HCoV NL63 (1), parainfluenza 3 (1), Staphylococcus aureus (1), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1), and Pneumocystis jirovecii (2).
