Plain chest X-ray diagnosed 70.2% of cases and ultrasonography was used for follow-up. CT was used to detect 2.6% of episodes of pneumothorax. This corroborates with Wilkerson and Stone,[12] Rowan et al.[13] who reported that the plain radiograph is the primary radiological tool for screening for pneumothorax with a sensitivity of 80% in erect posture and 36-48% in the supine anteroposterior position. Ultrasonography has become more readily available at the bedside, and a recent literature review has reported a sensitivity of 86-98% and a specificity of 97-100% for diagnosing pneumothorax.[14] CT chest scanning is the gold standard test for both diagnosing and determines the size of pneumothorax,[15] but the problem of mobilizing hemodynamically unstable PICU patients for a CT scan precludes the use of CT for diagnosing pneumothorax in critically ill patients.",

The risk factor for acquiring pneumothorax was high in some diagnostic categories of patients such as those with respiratory diseases (39.4% vs. 23.9%) and sepsis and septic shock (34.8% vs. 24.1%). Many investigators have emphasized that pneumonia is an important predisposing factor in the development of pulmonary barotrauma in mechanically ventilated patients.[16] Patients with other lung diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome have a high incidence of pneumothorax (20-34%) in mechanically ventilated patients.[17]",
