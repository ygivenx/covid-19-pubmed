Improvement in these surveillance system characteristics is particularly relevant to mass gathering settings which may strain the resources of the host community, introduce new health risks, and at the same time be high profile for the community (McCloskey et al. 2014; World Health Organization 2015). The population influx associated with these events can increase the risk of communicable disease transmission due to importation of new infectious microbes and crowding and can also lead to health impacts due to the activities involved, such as environmental exposures from extended time outdoors. Toronto, Canada, was the host city to the 2015 Pan and Para Pan American Games (P/PAG) from July 10\u201326 to August 7\u201315, 2015, respectively. The P/PAG is a sporting event that draws thousands of athletes, visitors, officials, and media personnel from 41 countries (The Toronto Organizing Committee for the 2015 Pan American and Parapan American Games 2015). With a large population influx expected over an extended duration, surveillance was a key activity for public health agencies in preparedness and response to P/PAG (Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion (Public Health Ontario) 2015).",

            "text": "Syndromic surveillance uses pre-diagnostic data, and the inclusion of syndromic data sources in public health surveillance for mass gatherings has been shown to be useful (McCloskey et al. 2014). Interest in the implementation of novel or non-routine data sources for syndromic surveillance data has largely been driven by an aim of more timely notification and tracking of health risks (Henning 2004). Syndromic surveillance ideally leads to more rapid identification of risks than is possible by traditional surveillance sources that are primarily dependent on disease reporting based on laboratory testing. The ubiquitous use of mobile phones and the Internet has further led to consideration of novel data sources for syndromic surveillance (Keller et al. 2009; Brownstein et al. 2009; Charles-Smith et al. 2015; Jia and Mohamed 2015). Social media platforms such as Twitter capture population comments and thoughts that could indicate a health issue. By extracting relevant tweets based on keywords related to a health syndrome or condition of interest, social media has been used as a data source during emergencies such as Hurricane Isaac and the Boston Marathon explosions (Keller et al. 2009; Cassa et al. 2013; Bennett et al. 2013). A recent systematic review, however, indicated that the evidence base on the use of social media in public health surveillance practice has many gaps (Charles-Smith et al. 2015). In particular, this review identifies that a specific challenge exists in translating research using social media for surveillance into practice and notes that under-representation of social media analytics in active surveillance may be due to a lack of resources or required technical skills. While there was insufficient evidence to support including social media as an official data source for P/PAG surveillance, our team sought to leverage our combined analytic expertise relevant to social media and surveillance in order to pursue further research to understand the practical role of social media in public health surveillance for mass gatherings.",

A list of potential keyword terms was identified for each syndrome through multiple steps. First, an initial list of keywords was generated for the syndromes based on a review of recent publications that used Twitter in public health surveillance and monitoring (Aslam et al. 2014; Denecke et al. 2013; Broniatowski et al. 2013). Second, term lists were augmented by terminology from ED chief complaint data used for syndromic surveillance. Definitions from an ED-based syndromic surveillance ontology were reviewed as relevant to the syndromes of interest for this study (BLU Lab (University of Pittsburgh), The Surveillance Lab (McGill Clinical and Health Informatics Research), NLP Research Group (National Institute of Informatics, Japan) n.d.). To account for the different language that may be used for ED chief complaint data, compared with tweets, the lexical database WordNet was employed to supplement corresponding synonyms and regular expressions expected to be used on Twitter (WordNet 2015). Third, term lists for each syndrome were refined based on a consensus meeting including research team members with expertise in syndrome surveillance approaches (DB, IJ, YK, GL, KM). When applicable, a relative emphasis on over-inclusion of potentially relevant terms was used in final term selection to ensure term list comprehensiveness. The final list of terms is provided as Supplementary Table 1.",

Twitter\u2019s public streaming application programming interface (API) provides free real-time access to a 1% random sample of all tweets. This 1% of data is publicly available and free to all public health agencies wishing to analyze it. Initially, all tweets, regardless of geographic location, matching any of the keywords were collected and stored (Elasticsearch 2017). Using the term lists described previously, each tweet was classified into one or more of the four target syndromes of interest (i.e., respiratory, GI, heat-related, and ILI). Tweets could be classified into multiple syndromes; for example, \u201ccough\u201d appears in both respiratory and ILI syndromes and \u201cmuscle spasm\u201d appears in both ILI and heat syndromes. In step 2, filtering was conducted based on a geographical boundary consistent with the City of Toronto. Geographic filtering occurs by using Global Positioning System (GPS) location or user profile information collected with each tweet. Specifically, tweets were identified as being from Toronto based on users enabling their GPS coordinates and being located in Toronto at the time they tweeted or identifying themselves as having a location of Toronto within their Twitter profile.",

There were no communicable disease outbreaks during the P/PAG time period, and the only public health incidents that occurred during this period were several heat alerts (Chan et al. 2017). In this study, we demonstrate that the Twitter syndromes were sensitive to the heat alerts, as Twitter data were correlated with the telephone health helpline (Telehealth) data for heat syndrome and also correlated with maximum daily temperature. The peak correlations in the Twitter signal were on the same day as peaks in telephone helpline and temperature data. Based on this study, the addition of Twitter data to surveillance did not contribute to increased timeliness for mass gathering surveillance. This is an important finding given that the inclusion of novel sources of surveillance data aims to generally increase the timeliness of detection; however, Twitter data also includes a geospatial dimension which is unique and potentially useful for identifying the location of a public health issue. The weak GI and respiratory correlations that were found did not persist over a range of days and did not demonstrate a persistent alert as the heat correlations did. The negative cross-correlations found for respiratory and ILI syndrome, as well as the positive GI and respiratory correlations, were difficult to interpret given the lack of any detectable communicable disease events during the P/PAG. It is reassuring, however, that there were no peaks or aberrations noted in the Twitter data that could have been misinterpreted as health events. While it was not possible to assess the sensitivity or positive predictive value of Twitter for all public health risks identified for the P/PAG, the temporal correlations for the Twitter heat syndrome with heat alerts declared during the event provide support for the potential value of Twitter as a data source.",

Access to firehose data could be purchased but is not openly accessible; therefore, this study represents a practical use and analysis of Twitter data that would be accessible to all public health agencies. In addition, the small number may relate to the fact that tweets were identified as being from Toronto based on user preferences or their Twitter profile. The proportion of Twitter users that are GPS-enabled or have location identified in their profile is estimated to be smaller than the actual number of individuals tweeting (Burton et al. 2012).",

In 2013, Denecke et al. published a set of recommendations for establishing systems to exploit Twitter for public health monitoring, which included implementation of machine-based learning capability which would increase specificity and can help mitigate limitations to specificity in syndromes (Denecke et al. 2013). Further, additional techniques could be considered to analyze the content of tweets beyond the keywords, to better understand context or sentiment (Mollema et al. 2015). Since increased timeliness of Twitter data was not observed in this study, the analysis of context, sentiment, or geolocation implications may represent an important area for future study. The size and capacity of local public health agencies varies and the added cost of implementing infrastructure for collecting and analyzing social media data may not be practical for all public health agencies. Centralized data infrastructure for public health surveillance might best address resource considerations, although more evidence is needed to warrant such an investment.",

            "text": "In this study, we found that surveillance of syndromes defined from tweets can detect an increase in heat-related illness during a mass gathering where heat alerts were the only public health event. The absence of major spikes in the Twitter syndromes for communicable diseases also supports the finding in a previous study that social media data sources can be used for reassurance during high profile events when no signals have been detected from multiple data sources and, thus, support ongoing activities for the event (McCloskey et al. 2014). In moving from our study to routine public health practice, there are additional considerations for the validation of a Twitter-based surveillance system. The syndromes we used were created based on methods that have been applied in ED syndromic surveillance (BLU Lab (University of Pittsburgh), The Surveillance Lab (McGill Clinical and Health Informatics Research), NLP Research Group (National Institute of Informatics, Japan) n.d.). It is possible that the same approach used for chief complaint-based syndromes in ED surveillance may not translate well to Twitter which is based on expressions on social media. To mitigate this, we added regular expressions using a lexical database; however, it is possible that this did not capture all of the expressions that may be used by the public on Twitter. This could also increase the likelihood of correlations with ED data. The background level of \u201cnoise\u201d on Twitter may affect specificity of the syndrome, which is important to consider for future study. For example, some keywords can be used colloquially or in reference to non-health-related events or expressions (e.g., uses of the word \u201chot\u201d) and may therefore not be valid for the syndrome of interest. As well, health-related tweets may not indicate infection or health impacts, as media organizations and health interest groups may use Twitter to raise awareness and communicate with the public. As Denecke suggests, machine-based learning can be used as a strategy to address aspects of signal to noise (Denecke et al. 2013). Future work would therefore benefit from further validation of the Twitter syndromes and consideration for machine-based learning algorithms or content analysis. In addition, further research is needed to examine the role for social media in surveillance for other mass gathering contexts, considering implications of the type of event, seasonality, and the host population.",
