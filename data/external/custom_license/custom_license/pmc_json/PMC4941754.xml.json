This observation implies that interspecies transmission of CIV H3N2 to ferrets is not fully established and that further adaptation might be needed. Such additional adaptation may occur when ferrets are intranasally inoculated with the virus. A previous report has indicated that viral deposition was primarily restricted to the upper trachea in ferrets exposed to airborne virus, whereas the deposition occurred in the peripheral lung tissue of animals infected by intranasal inoculation.\n15\n Therefore, the ferrets with intranasal infection had higher chance to allow CIV H3N2 to be adapted and the adapted viruses could be transmitted from the infected ferrets to the na\u00efve ferrets. Also, the direct contact by caging the ferrets together provided a much higher and prolonged exposure, even if the shed titers were lower, so that the ferrets to ferrets transmission of CIV H3N2 could be possible compared to dogs to ferrets transmission, which was restricted by aerosol transmission. Nevertheless, interspecies transmission of CIV H3N2 from dogs to ferrets was not as efficient as it was between dogs and cats, which implies further biological and epidemiological adaptation would be needed in the case of dogs to ferrets transmission.",
