Due to their ability to bind the targets with high specificity and affinity as well as near absence of non-mechanism toxicity due to off-target binding (3), mAb-based drugs offer attractive advantages over the small molecule therapeutics. On the other hand, these biotherapeutic drugs possess complex and conformationally heterogeneous molecular structures that are vulnerable to the changes in their environments and themselves. A complex series of processing steps between production to administration results in several physico-chemical stresses on the molecules (4). These stresses include high concentrations, variable temperatures, pH extremes, varying ionic strengths, shear stresses, and air-water as well as a variety of solid-liquid interfaces. As a result, potency and purity of the final drug product is impacted via multiple degradation pathways (5). Hence, there is considerable interest in the biopharmaceutical industry towards gaining fundamental understanding of the molecular properties that determine chemical, thermodynamic and long-term stability of biotherapeutic molecules.",

            "text": "Aggregation is also a topic of intense research for proteins in general. Accumulating experimental evidence shows that specific regions of protein sequences, especially the ones with amyloidogenic properties, tend to drive aggregation (8\u201312). Early studies on small proteins and peptides have led to characterization of the physico-chemical properties of amyloid or amyloid-like aggregates associated with neurodegenerative diseases (13). The molecular trigger for these aggregates is the generation of the cross-\u03b2 motif whose molecular structure was recently elucidated by Eisenberg lab (14,15). Formation of cross-\u03b2 motif and amyloid-like aggregates in proteins is quite common. From a survey of the literature, we have found that experimental evidence is available for more than seventy different proteins showing aggregation via formation of the cross-\u03b2 steric zipper motif (16), and even proteins in bacterial inclusion bodies can aggregate via this route (17). Short sequence regions that potentially drive aggregation have been detected in these proteins. These are called aggregation prone regions (APRs) (18). Typically, these APRs have unique features with respect to charge, hydrophobicity, aromaticity and secondary structural preference. A number of computational approaches have been developed to predict potential APRs in proteins (16). Most of these prediction methods use only the protein sequences as input to identify short APRs of 5\u20139 residues capable of forming amyloid-like fibrils (19). Other methods based on pattern recognition, three-dimensional profiles and molecular simulations are emerging (20\u201326).",

The solvent-accessible surface area buried upon Fab-antigen complex formation is used as a parameter to gauge Fab-antigen interaction and the contribution of the potential APRs towards antigen recognition. In literature, protein-protein interactions have been commonly measured using approaches that rely on energetics (32,33) or contact residues (34) and the buried surface area (35) at the interfaces. The two approaches are closely related. In this study, we preferred to use buried surface area as a metric because it can be easily calculated.

Incidence of APRs is not uniform in all CDR loops. In particular, APRs are less frequent in the heavy chain CDR 3 (H3) loops.

(b) Antigen is protein with at least 50 residues; complexes with small molecule haptens, polysaccharides, peptides and RNA as antigens are not included. (c) The complex has full Fab structure; complexes with Fv or single chain of antibody are not included. (d) The antibody sequences contained in complexes are non-redundant. This last criterion was hard to meet because the antibody sequences show high homologies when both variable and constant regions are included in the alignments. We retained one complex with best resolution from a set of complexes where both light chains and heavy chains of the Fabs showed greater than 90% sequence identity. The choice of 90% sequence identity is arbitrary. The average sequence identities for variable regions of Fab light and heavy chains in the final dataset are 60% and 55%, respectively. This indicates that we have a fair coverage of antibody sequence variation in our dataset. If more than one complex were present in the crystallographic asymmetric unit, only one copy is retained.

The potential APRs obtained from TANGO (28) and PAGE (29) analysis are highlighted in Fig. 2 to facilitate direct comparison among the complexes. The APRs in variable domains (VL and VH) are primarily located in CDR loops and adjoining \u03b2 strands. The APRs in constant domain (CL and CH) are well conserved in terms of location and composition. Each Fab in the complex contains 3\u20139 APRs with at least one of them being in CDR loops. These observations are consistent with our previous finding (30), even though different criteria are used here (see Materials and Methods section for details). In this study, we classify the APRs into types 1, 2, and 3. We consider APRs of types 1 and 2 to be strong predictions, while the type 3 APRs are weak predictions. Most of the APRs found in the CDRs and adjoining regions are of types 1 and 2. The APR \u201cFTLTI\u201d located in light chain framework region 2 for a few Fabs is of type 3. However, this APR is not involved in antigen binding.\n\n",

On average, 16.0 \u00b1 10.7% (range: 0\u201342.7%) of buried surface area of Fabs can be attributed to APRs. The variation is large. For example, in case of the murine antibody Fab-protein A complex (PDB ID: 1OSP), the variable domain contains only one APR which falls in H3 loop but does not participate in antigen binding. In the case of the VEFG-blocking Fab\u2014Neuropilin-1 complex (PDB ID: 2QQN), the contribution of APRs is the highest (42.7%). APRs contribute more than 10% to buried surface area of Fab in 20 out of the 29 complexes (69%). Among commercial antibodies, with the exception of the neutralizing Fab-VEGF complex (PDB ID: 1BJ1), APRs account for greater than 15% of buried surface area of Fab. Fig. 3 shows, as an example, the structure of the IGG RU5 Fab-Von Willebrand factor complex (PDB ID: 1FE8). In this case, 29.8% of buried surface area in Fab is attributed to binding residues that belong to APRs.

If the average buried surface area contribution for each loop is normalized by number of binding residues in the loop, H3 loops again have the greatest contribution (5.3% per residue). Consistently, the variability plots of antibody sequences and statistical studies of antigen-contacting residues have shown that H3 loops are important for antibody specificity (36,54,55).\n\n",

In particular, we cite three examples because of good agreement between the experiments and computational predictions. These are bovine growth hormone (74), amyloidogenic immunoglobulin light chain (75) and a human IgG1 mAb (23,24). We summarize our findings below; the details of these cases are presented in Supplementary Material. First, based on the experimental studies, Lehrman et al. have identified a sequence region 109\u2013133 in bovine growth hormone (bGH) to be involved in aggregation (74). Our TANGO and PAGE analyses indicate the presence of APRs in this region (119-GILALM-124). The experimentally designed variants 8H-bGH and human growth hormone (hGH) differ in the sequence region 109\u2013133 and show reduced aggregation propensity in the experiments of Lehrman et al. (74). Consistent with this observation, TANGO/PAGE spectra do not indicate an APR in this region for 8H-bGh and hGH. Second, Baden et al. (2008) have identified three non-conserved somatic mutations, I34N, Q42K and H87Y, which restore amyloidogenic immunoglobulin light chain AL-09 to its germline sequence \u03baIO18/O8 (75). TANGO spectrum of AL-09 indicates a very strong APR containing I34 (32-YLIWY-36, TANGO aggregation score \u223c90%). The PAGE spectrum shows an APR containing H87 (87-HCQQY-91). Both TANGO and PAGE did not find an APR involving the residues at the position 42. The corresponding TANGO spectra for both the germline sequence \u03baIO18/O8 and the AL-09 mutants with reduced aggregation propensity indicate that APR 32-YLIWY-36 is substantially weakened for the germ line light chain due to the somatic disruption at position 34. However, APR 87-HCQQY-91 identified by PAGE remained unchanged. Third, L309K mutation in the CH2 domain of intact IgG1 mAb studied by Chennamsetty et al. (2009) reduces its aggregation propensity as shown by turbidity and HPLC assays and improves its stability in DSC experiments (see Table I and Fig. 3 in Ref. 24) (24). This mutation actually disrupts a strong APR (302-VVSVLTVL-309) (TANGO aggregation score \u223c90%) found in the Fc regions of IgG mAbs. This APR is well conserved among immunoglobulin Gs and was documented earlier (30). In all three cases, both TANGO and PAGE also detected additional APRs that were common between the proteins and their variants, indicating the potential for further reduction in aggregation propensities of the molecules.",

This may help improve expression levels in cell lines, facilitate high concentration dosage forms and increase shelf\u2013life of the product. However, developability-related sequence mutations should not adversely impact the potency of the therapeutic mAbs.

Molecular models, crystal structures of Fab-antigen complexes and Alanine scanning experiments may help identify such binding hot-spot residues. Mutations affecting these residues should be avoided to preserve potency. On average, CDR loops H3, H2 and L3 contribute the most towards antigen recognition. H3 loops do contain fewer APRs, but this is not the case for H2 and L3 loops. While different binding site residues contribute unequally towards antigen recognition, there is still some risk that mutations in these loops could also impact potency of the mAb candidates. This is especially true at early discovery stages where Fab-antigen complex crystal structures are not yet available, antigen-binding residues are not well identified, and project time-lines are tight. On the other hand, L2 loops contribute the least towards antigen binding but often contain APRs (Fig. 6). Mutations aimed at disrupting the APRs in this region could help improve mAb stability without significantly impacting potency. Apart from L2 loops, L1 and H1 loops are the other regions where disruption of potential APRs can reduce mAb aggregation tendency and not impact the potency substantially.",
