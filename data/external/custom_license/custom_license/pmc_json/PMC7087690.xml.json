            "text": "Caveolae were discovered by electron microscopy as small (60\u201380 nm) flask-shaped plasmalemma vesicles more than 50 years ago (Palade 1953; Yamada 1955). They are particularly abundant in adipocytes, smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells and fibroblasts and reportedly function in a multitude of cellular transport- and signaling processes (Mineo and Anderson 2001; Nichols and Lippincott-Schwartz 2001; Pelkmans and Helenius 2003; Carver and Schnitzer 2003; Hommelgaard et al. 2005; Parton and Simons 2007; Patel et al. 2008). Caveolae owe the characteristic shape to their main structural proteins, the caveolins (Fra et al. 1995; Drab et al. 2001). These are ~22 kDa cholesterol-binding proteins with both the N- and C-terminal ends in the cytoplasm and anchored to the membrane by a central putative hairpin intramembrane domain. About 150 oligomerized caveolin molecules are present in a single caveola (Williams and Lisanti 2004; Pelkmans and Zerial 2005) which has also been estimated to harbor ~20,000 cholesterol molecules and to be relatively enriched in certain sphingoglycolipids and sphingomyelin (Ortegren et al. 2004). This composition favors the formation of liquid-ordered lipid raft domains, and caveolins and other proteins that localize to caveolae are generally found to be enriched in preparations of detergent resistant membranes (DRM\u2019s) (Simons and Ikonen 1997; Anderson 1998).",

            "text": "Assembly of caveolae de novo is thought to take place in the secretory pathway, most likely in a late Golgi compartment from where they are subsequently targeted to the plasma membrane as exocytotic caveolar carriers (Parton and Simons 2007; Echarri et al. 2007). Their mode of functioning at the surface of various types of cells has been intensely studied for several years, but it is still a matter of some controversy whether they are static or dynamic membrane structures. Early on, the term potocytosis was introduced to describe a receptor-mediated endocytosis of folate by caveolae, followed by direct delivery to the cytoplasm and thus bypassing the lysosomes (Anderson et al. 1992). However, experiments including FRAP microscopy of cells expressing GFP-caveolin-1 later indicated that caveolae remain at the cell surface as immobile units for long periods of time (Thomsen et al. 2002). More recently, TIR-FM experiments have revealed two possible modes of dynamic caveolar functioning in HeLa cells: one consisting of rapid fission\u2013fusion cycles taking place in close vicinity of the plasma membrane (termed kiss-and-run recycling), and another, microtubule-dependent long-range cytoplasmic transport (Pelkmans and Zerial 2005). Furthermore, caveolar mobility and long-range transport to caveosomes could be dramatically increased by simian virus 40 (SV40) (Tagawa et al. 2005), a virus known to use caveolae for cell entry (Anderson et al. 1996). In either mode, however, the caveolae function as fixed entities, i.e., unlike clathrin- and COP-mediated vesicular transport, where coat molecules undergo cycles of assembly and disassembly.",

            "text": "Fibroblast-like synoviocytes are rich in caveolae, both single and interconnected in large clusters, and in a previous work the membrane peptidase CD13 (also known as aminopeptidase N) was shown to reside partially in clusters in the \u201cflat\u201d areas of the plasma membrane and partially in caveolae (Riemann et al. 2001). CD13 is an ectopeptidase that has been implicated in the control of growth and differentiation of many cellular systems, and it is involved in processing a number of peptide hormones, including angiotensins, met-enkephalin, and somatostatin (Riemann et al. 1999). In addition, it has been proposed to function together with CD64 (Fc\u03b3 receptor) in a multimeric receptor complex in monocytes (Riemann et al. 2005), and to act as a modulator of signal transduction and cell motility in endothelial cells (Petrovic et al. 2007). Furthermore, human coronavirus 229E exploits CD13 as a receptor and causes a redistribution of the peptidase from the surface to caveolae in fibroblasts (Nomura et al. 2004), and recently CD13 was reported to be regulated by the reversion-inducing cysteine-rich protein with Kazal motifs (RECK) by a modulation of its surface expression (Miki et al. 2007).",

We found that all single caveolae and most but not all of the caveolae clusters are normally freely accessible. About 50% of all caveolae were capable of internalizing CTB within 5 min of chase, but once internalized, the toxin remained in the closed caveolae for periods up to 24 h, as judged by lack of colocalization with markers for endosomes (EEA1) and lysosomes (lysotracker). The synoviocyte caveolae clusters were strongly associated with vimentin-based intermediate filaments, and we propose that association with this cytoskeleton without molecular motors for vesicle trafficking attached, may explain the static behavior of caveolae in synoviocytes and other cell types. Finally, RECK localized to the caveolae clusters and by associating with CD13 may act to down regulate the expression of the proteinase at the \u201copen\u201d cell surface.",

This was the case both for the single caveolae positioned close to the surface, as well as the clusters of interconnected caveolae typically seen deeper within the cell. However, among the many sections examined, unlabeled caveolae were only occasionally detected, indicating their ability to seal off from the surface (Fig. 1a). These unlabeled caveolae were most often of the clustered type and were always seen at some distance from the cell surface (Fig. 1b, c). In contrast, single caveolae seen in direct contact with the plasma membrane were always stained by Ruthenium Red, indicating a permanent access to the extracellular medium for this caveolar subpopulation.

To study the dynamics of caveolae internalization, we performed sequential double color labeling experiments with Alexa 488- and Alexa 594-conjugated CTB (Fig. 4a). Colocalization of the two fluorophores was close to 90% when they were added simultaneously, but within 5 min of \u201cchase\u201d period between the two additions of toxin, colocalization decreased to about 45%, indicating the induction of a rapid internalization of about half the surface-bound CTB. During chase periods for up to 3 h, the degree of colocalization only slowly decreased further, to just under 30%. This degree of colocalization was observed even by 24 h of chase, indicating that the internalized CTB remains stable over a long period of time (Fig. 4b). Regardless of the chase time, the labeling representing internalized CTB was localized in punctae mainly centered around the nucleus, whereas the immobile, colocalized fraction was mainly seen at the periphery of the cell, in particular along the cell protrusions (Fig. 4a). This distribution agrees well with the Ruthenium Red experiments (Fig. 1), and implies the existence of an internalization-competent subpopulation of caveolae, consisting mainly of the caveolae clusters, and an immobile fraction of single caveolae in close proximity to the cell surface.\n\n",

The filaments were immunogold labeled by an antibody to vimentin, demonstrating that they are of the intermediate type (Fig. 6a), and in higher magnification, putative linker proteins between filaments and caveolae were detectable (Fig. 6b). In line with this, the most abundant protein in DRM\u2019s prepared from synoviocytes, as judged from protein staining, was a 55-kDa band subsequently identified by MALDI-TOF analysis as vimentin (data not shown).

The RECK labeling partially colocalized with that of CTB, indicating that the double labeled punctae represent caveolae or caveolae clusters. Together, these experiments show that RECK is expressed in synoviocytes.

Furthermore, the infrequently occurring unlabeled caveolae were only detected in the subpopulation of caveolae that extend into the cytoplasm, suggesting that only these pleiomorphic membrane structures engage in internalization. In a study, using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy methodology, single caveolae, as visualized by caveolin-1-GFP, were observed to undergo repeated and rapid (on a millisecond timescale) cycles of fission and fusion without disassembly of the caveolar coat (Pelkmans and Zerial 2005). Only 45% of the cell\u2019s caveolae engage in this apply termed kiss-and-run recycling which proceeds in a confined volume close to the cell surface and relies upon the activity of dynamin and a number of kinases. Assuming caveolar kiss-and-run occurs in a similar fashion in synoviocytes, caveolae thus engaged would be seen as static and, most likely, as open in the experiments with Ruthenium Red performed in the present work.",

The kinetics of this process suggests that those caveolae capable of internalization do so rapidly (within 5 min of chase) and then remain surface inaccessible for a very long time (24 h). Morphologically, the internalization-competent caveolae were predominantly of the clustered type that extend deep into the cytoplasm. These so called endocytotic caveolar carriers (Parton and Simons 2007) may traffic further to either the endosomes (Sharma et al. 2003; Pelkmans et al. 2004) or the caveosomes reported previously by others to function as an intermediate compartment in caveolar endocytosis of SV40 as well as CTB (Pelkmans et al. 2001; Nichols 2002).",

            "text": "Clearly, the data obtained in the present work regarding further membrane transport of internalized CTB in synoviocytes do not fit well with the above dynamic concept of the caveosome as a major trafficking hub. The failure to detect a convincing colocalization with the endosomal marker EEA1 after 30 min or Lysotracker after 3 h of internalization strongly argues against a major pathway leading to the acidifying organelles. In fact, the persistence of the characteristic punctate labeling pattern throughout the time-course of the incubation suggests that most if not all internalized CTB in synoviocytes remains within the closed caveolar system. A possible explanation for this observed stability is the strong association with the intermediate filament system, as evidenced by the relative abundance of vimentin in synoviocyte DRM\u2019s, as well as by immunogold electron microscopy. Association between caveolae and intermediate filaments have previously been described for transmigrating endothelial cells (Santilman et al. 2007), but otherwise the action of the microfilaments has been implicated in caveolar endocytosis. Thus, SV40 binding in HeLa cells induced a transient break down of existing actin stress fibers and a recruitment of actin to virus-loaded caveolae to initiate formation of new actin fibers (Pelkmans et al. 2002). This ligand-triggered rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton has been proposed to eliminate the spatial restrictions on caveolar dynamics and enable caveolae to switch from local kiss-and-run recycling to committed, long-range, microtubule-dependent internalization to intracellular organelles (Tagawa et al. 2005). The trafficking/functioning of caveolae in a given cell type therefore seems to depend upon their cytoskeletal interactions. Thus, in synoviocytes, where association with intermediate filaments dominates, we find it doubtful if the caveolae clusters that internalize CTB also engage in bona fide membrane trafficking from the surface to the cell interior. Conceivably, the internalization process may consist merely of a caveolar closure, taking place either at the cell surface or maybe somewhere within a pleiomorphic caveolae cluster. Furthermore, as judged by the experiments with Ruthenium Red, closure is a rare event in cells not challenged by pathogens and thus may not be an important part of normal caveolar functioning. This may be examplified by the dual localization of CD13, partly at \u201cflat\u201d areas of the plasma membrane and partly in caveolae. By sequestering from the former to the latter compartment by regulated association with the caveolar RECK protein (Miki et al. 2007), CD13 (and membrane proteinases of the MMP family) will be prevented from participating in cell\u2013cell interactions and contact with the extracellular matrix regardless whether the caveolae are open or not. Along these lines, future work should aim to clarify which of the many other biological functions ascribed to caveolae, including signaling, lipid regulation/storage and mechanosensing (Parton and Simons 2007) that involve true internalization.",
