            "text": "RNA interference (RNAi) gained international attention in 1998 when Fire, Mello and colleagues discovered the ability of double-stranded RNA to silence gene expression in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans1. Three years later, Tuschl and co-workers published their celebrated proof-of-principle experiment demonstrating that synthetic small interfering RNA (siRNA) could achieve sequence-specific gene knockdown in a mammalian cell line2. The first successful use of siRNA for gene silencing in mice was achieved for a hepatitis C target shortly thereafter3. Since that time, the biotechnology sector has made considerable efforts in the advancement of siRNA therapeutics for the treatment of various disease targets, including viral infections4,5 and cancer6,7,8.",

RNAi is triggered by the presence of long pieces of double-stranded RNA, which are cleaved into the fragments known as siRNA (21\u201323 nucleotides long) by the enzyme Dicer9. In practice, siRNA can be synthetically produced and then directly introduced into the cell, thus circumventing Dicer mechanics (Fig. 1). This shortcut reduces the potential for an innate immune interferon response and the shutdown of cellular protein expression that can occur following the interaction of long pieces (>30 nucleotides) of double-stranded RNA with intracellular RNA receptors10.",

Argonaute 2, a multifunctional protein contained within RISC, unwinds the siRNA, after which the sense strand (or passenger strand) of the siRNA is cleaved12. The activated RISC, which contains the antisense strand (or guide strand) of the siRNA, selectively seeks out and degrades mRNA that is complementary to the antisense strand13 (Fig. 1). The cleavage of mRNA occurs at a position between nucleotides 10 and 11 on the complementary antisense strand, relative to the 5\u2032-end14. The activated RISC complex can then move on to destroy additional mRNA targets, which further propagates gene silencing15. This extra potency ensures a therapeutic effect for 3\u20137 days in rapidly dividing cells, and for several weeks in non-dividing cells16. Eventually, siRNAs are diluted below a certain therapeutic threshold or degraded within the cell, and so repeated administration is necessary to achieve a persistent effect.",

Indeed, it has already been reported that synthetic siRNAs are capable of knocking down targets in various diseases in vivo, including hypercholesterolaemia17, liver cirrhosis18, hepatitis B virus (HBV)4,19, human papillomavirus20, ovarian cancer21 and bone cancer22. In order for these advances to be implemented in a clinical setting, safe and effective delivery systems must be developed. While 'naked', chemically modified siRNA has shown efficacy in certain physiological settings such as the brain23 and the lung24, there are many tissues in the body that require an additional delivery system to facilitate transfection. This is because naked siRNA is subject to degradation by endogenous enzymes, and is too large (\u223c13 kDa) and too negatively charged to cross cellular membranes. The issue of effective and non-toxic delivery is a key challenge and serves as the most significant barrier between siRNA technology and its therapeutic application.",

This effect can be reduced by the incorporation of 2\u2032-O-methyl modifications into the sugar structure of selected nucleotides within both the sense and antisense strands38,40 (Fig. 3a). 2\u2032-O-methyl modifications have also been shown to confer resistance to endonuclease activity41 and to abrogate off-target effects when incorporated into the seed region, which corresponds to nucleotides 2\u20138 on the antisense strand42. Other common modification approaches to mitigate enzymatic degradation include the introduction of phosphorothioate backbone linkages at the 3\u2032-end of the RNA strands to reduce susceptibility to exonucleases.

A study by Morrissey and co-workers indicated that HBV replication was inhibited through the delivery of an siRNA\u2013SNALP complex that targeted HBV RNA. Three daily intravenous injections of 3 mg per kg per day reduced serum HBV levels by at least one order of magnitude, and the effect was specific, dose-dependent and lasted for up to 7 days after dosing4. In addition, Zimmerman and colleagues demonstrated the ability of SNALPs to enable knockdown of ApoB in the liver of cynomolgus monkeys57. A single siRNA injection resulted in dose-dependent silencing of ApoB mRNA expression in the liver 48 hours after administration, with maximal silencing of more than 90%. Knockdown was confirmed to be caused by ApoB mRNA cleavage at precisely the site predicted for the RNAi mechanism, and persisted for 11 days at the highest administered dose of 2.5 mg per kg57.",

Allergan is currently conducting a Phase II clinical trial on an siRNA for AMD, with completed Phase I results indicating minimal side effects and improved vision in some of the patients. Although Silence Therapeutics also had an siRNA product for AMD in the pipeline, they have now refocused their Phase II clinical study on the treatment of diabetic macular oedema, which is another condition caused by leaky vasculature within the eye. Importantly, a recent study has reported that anti-VEGF siRNA efficacy in the eye is not due to specific gene silencing, but is instead caused by nonspecific stimulation of the TLR3 pathway, which can reduce angiogenesis102. Although this study calls into question the nature of the anti-angiogenic effect reported in AMD clinical trials, it does not explain the therapeutic effects observed in other applications of siRNA in which appropriate controls have been performed.",

Given the potential for nonspecific effects, it is important that the therapeutic mode of action be validated when possible, such as through direct measurement of target mRNA levels in vivo.
