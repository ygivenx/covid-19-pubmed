For example, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was controlled after the identification of the causative agent coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (1). Developments in molecular biological approaches in recent years have led to the identification of many unknown pathogens. Once a fragment from the agent's genome has been isolated and sequenced, standard genomic walking techniques are used to extend the known sequence, and computer homology searches can then be used to identify the likely phylogenetic relationship of the agent with other known organisms (2). Additionally, sequences of some viruses, such as SARS-CoV, have altered during transmission, and this may prevent the detection of the virus by a PCR method (3,4). Thus, a detection method that is not based on the known sequence is essentially required as an alternative method to the normal PCR method.",

The technique is based on PCR enrichment of DNA fragments that are present in agent-infected cells but absent in normal cells. Using RDA, Chang et al. (6) isolated two DNA fragments from a Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) lesion in an AIDS patient. The determination of sequences of these fragments resulted in the discovery of the KS-associated herpes virus (7). Despite the fact that RDA has been developed for detecting agents with a DNA-based genome, it can be used to detect the presence or absence of RNA in a sample by generating a cDNA intermediate (cDNA RDA) to amplify the RNA (8). Since a large quantity of ribosomal RNAs interfere with cDNA RDA, the cDNA intermediate should be synthesized from poly(A)+ RNA. Therefore, it is difficult to detect RNA viruses from virus-infected cells by cDNA RDA because many viruses have no poly(A) at the end of the genome. If cDNA RDA can be applied to total RNA without interference with ribosomal RNAs, the virus genome can be amplified from total RNA of virus-infected cells by cDNA RDA.",

Primers that are specific to a viral genome also efficiently eliminate the influence of ribosomal RNAs. However, prior knowledge of the virus genome is required for the construction of specific primers. In this study, based on the fact that cDNA can be primed with a mixture of oligomers, we constructed a set of oligomers that was inefficient for priming ribosomal RNAs but that normally primed most of the genome of an RNA virus (9,10). Based on the frequency distribution of hexanucleotides in ribosomal RNAs and viral sequences in current public databases, we determined a mixture of 96 hexanucleotides that rarely prime ribosomal RNAs but can prime all the known mammalian viruses listed in public databases. The results of this study show that species-independent detection of viral RNA from infected cells is possible.",

Genomic sequences of SARS-CoV (AY291315) and bovine parainfluenza virus 3 (BPI3, NC_002161) were also selected as representatives of RNA virus (11). We created three programs, GREG, GAS and OSC (produced by C's Labs, Sapporo, Japan and licensed by Sigma\u2013Aldrich Co. Ltd, St Louis, MO), connected to a MySQL database server (version 4.0.20). The program GREG transformed FASTA-formatted sequence to a text-formatted sequence and inserted it into a table in the MySQL database (GREG table). Using these programs, we designed a mixture of hexanucleotide primers. First, sequences were divided into hexamers, and each hexamer was classified into a pattern of hexanucleotide sequence in which 46 = 4096 patterns were included. The program GAS generated frequency distributions of hexanucleotides in the sequences in the GREG table, extracted the progeny with their probabilities of hexanucleotide patterns and inserted them into a table (GAS table) of the database. We made four sets of GREG and GAS tables for rat ribosomal RNAs, a satellite repeat, BPI3 and SARS-CoV (Table 1). The program OSC listed the differences between the two GAS tables, i.e. the program selected oligomer patterns that exist in BPI3 but not in ribosomal RNAs. The frequency of hexamer patterns in each RNA sequence was transferred into a table of Microsoft Access. A total of 96 hexamer patterns, including those having very low frequencies or those that did not appear in ribosomal RNAs, were synthesized and mixed for use as an RT primer (Table 2, non-ribosomal hexanucleotides).",

First, we downloaded all viral sequences from the FTP site of EMBL database (release date 30 June 2004) and entered them into tables (EMBL data table) of the MySQL database. The table included EMBL ID, title, annotation and sequence as fields. The annotation field included taxonomic classification of the origin of the data. We separated the words included in the annotation field into taxonomic words, such as family names, and inserted them into a new table (taxonomic table), in which EMBL IDs and taxonomic words were included. We then selected EMBL IDs of mammalian viruses with any of the viral family names listed in Table 5 from the taxonomic table. Next, sequences of mammalian viruses were divided into groups according to their species presented in the taxonomic table. To determine the targets for hexanucleotide analysis, EMBL IDs having the longest sequence in the species were selected as the estimated genomic sequence of the virus, and then, a new table named \u2018Sequences of viral species\u2019 was prepared. Although the longest sequence from each species was selected, some of these sequences were very short. Therefore, we eliminated sequences that were shorter than half of the common genomic size of each viral family. The resultant 1791 viral sequences were inserted into a table titled \u2019Genomic sequence of viral species\u2019. The frequency of the non-ribosomal hexanucleotides was determined in sense and complementary strands of the sequences included in the table titled \u2018Genomic sequence of viral species\u2019.",

Among the sequences of 30 selected clones, the sequences of 25 clones and 5 clones were highly homologous to those of ribosomal RNA and a 1399 bp satellite repeat (GenBank accession no. V00125), respectively. Based on this result, ribosomal and satellite sequences were determined for analysing hexanucleotide frequency. Since the reported ribosomal sequences of mammals are highly homologous to each other, we selected rat premature 18S, 5.8S and 28S ribosomal sequences as ribosomal sequences for hexanucleotide frequency analysis. Genome sequences of SARS-CoV and BPI3 were selected as representatives of RNA viral sequence. Table 1 shows the probabilities [number of the patterns/(length of sequence \u00d7 2)] of hexanucleotides in the human ribosomal RNA, V00125 satellite repeat, BPI3 and SARS-CoV. If a random sequence is assumed, frequencies would be distributed according to the Poisson's distribution, and the average of frequency would be the same as the variance of frequency. Although the average/variance ratios of all the four sequences were <1, the ratio of ribosomal RNA was smallest in these sequences (Table 3). This value suggests that the probabilities of hexamer patterns of ribosomal RNA were strongly biased from random sequence. Based on histograms of probabilities, the distribution of the probabilities of hexamer patterns in ribosomal RNA differed greatly from those of V00125 satellite repeat or BPI3 (Figure 1). It should be noted that 8 hexanucleotides did not exist and over 90 hexanucleotides were rare in the ribosomal sequence. To determine primer sequences that do not prime ribosomal RNA but prime viral RNA, the probabilities of hexamer patterns in ribosomal RNA and satellite repeat were calculated. The hexamer patterns were then realigned in an ascending order according to the sum of probabilities, and the 1st to 96th patterns were selected as non-ribosomal hexanucleotides, i.e. we selected 96 rarest hexanucleotide patterns (Table 2, non-ribosomal hexanucleotides) in major transcripts in normal mammalian cells on the assumption that ribosomal RNA and transcripts from satellites are the most frequent transcripts in normal cells.",

We investigated the effect of non-ribosomal hexanucleotides on cDNA synthesis by using in vitro synthesized plasmid RNA (artificial RNA) and total cellular RNA, including ribosomal RNAs. An autoradiogram of 32P-labelled double-stranded cDNAs that were synthesized using non-ribosomal hexanucleotides or a random primer and subsequently separated by agarose gel electrophoresis is shown in Figure 2. When test and total cellular RNAs were reverse transcribed individually, the efficiencies of cDNA synthesis from artificial RNA using random and non-ribosomal hexanucleotides were almost similar; however, the efficiency of cDNA synthesis of cellular RNA was markedly lower in a non-ribosomal hexanucleotide-primed cDNA sample than in a random primer-primed cDNA sample (Figure 2A). In the mixed samples of test and total cellular RNAs, ribosomal RNAs were inefficiently reverse transcribed with non-ribosomal hexanucleotides. The total incorporated counts in non-ribosomal hexanucleotides-primed cDNAs decreased with a decrease in the proportion of the test RNA in the mixed RNA samples (Figure 2A). It is considered that the efficiency of reverse transcription depends on the proportions of the test RNA in the mixed RNAs. When approximately the same counts of cDNAs were loaded on the gel, synthesis of ribosomal RNA-derived cDNA (ribosomal cDNA) was obvious in random primer-primed cDNAs (Figure 2B). On the other hand, the synthesis of ribosomal cDNA was not obvious in the cDNA primed with non-ribosomal hexanucleotides. A relatively large cDNA derived from artificial RNA could be observed even when a smaller proportion of test RNA was mixed with cellular RNA and non-ribosomal hexanucleotide-primed samples. These data suggest that the relative amount of test RNA-derived cDNA is greater in non-ribosomal hexanucleotides-primed samples than in random primer-primed samples.",

This usage of mixed primers was based on the assumption that the specificity of primers was equal to the summation of the specificity of each primer. Thus, we searched for primers that do not prime ribosomal RNAs by frequency analysis of hexanucleotides. The frequency and distribution of oligonucleotides in mammalian and viral genomes have been studied to search for common motifs that might be used for controlling cellular functions (19\u201323). Volinia et al. (22) found sets of common decamers that can be used for the control of transcription control signals or for the common amplification of viruses. Programs for frequency analysis have been useful for searching common oligonucleotides in many subsets of sequences. On the other hand, database programming is useful not only for searching common oligonucleotides but also for searching oligonucleotides that do not exist in a subset of sequences. In this study, we found that there were hexanucleotide patterns that were rare or that did not exist in ribosomal RNA sequences. We also showed that sequences of 96 selected non-ribosomal hexanucleotides are normally present in known viral sequences (Table 5).",

The artificially synthesized RNA included 30 priming sites for non-ribosomal hexanucleotides and was efficiently reverse transcribed (Figure 2). In the model experiments, cDNA RDA with non-ribosomal hexanucleotides efficiently reverse transcribed and specifically amplified the extracellular test RNA in the mixed RNA (Figure 3). cDNA RDA-derived detection of the artificial RNA was 30-fold more sensitive when non-ribosomal hexanucleotides were used than when random hexamers were used. These results suggest that non-ribosomal hexanucleotides dramatically improve the detection efficiency of cDNA RDA.",

Additionally, this method can be applied to most productive viruses, since sense and complementary sequences of non-ribosomal hexanucleotides were found to exist in most of the known virus sequences in GenBank (Table 5).
