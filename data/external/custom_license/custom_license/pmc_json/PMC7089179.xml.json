Through a rhetorical lens, discourse is seen as having intention, as being addressed, and as taking place in a specific context that exerts shaping power on what is expressed (Bitzer 1968). Key to rhetorical study is a sensitivity to the symbolic dimension of communicative elements. Through humans\u2019 ingrained ability to comprehend and create symbols, we are refined receptors\u2014not always consciously\u2014of messages operating at symbolic levels (Burke 1973; Foss 2017).",

While the influence of occupational ideology on the enactment of one\u2019s conception of journalism has been investigated (e.g., Shoemaker 1991; Deuze 2005), in the immediacy of certain contexts (such as a novel infectious disease outbreak), my findings suggest that slippage exists between journalists\u2019 ethical responsibilities as journalists and their responsibilities as human beings; and between health and science journalism, and simply \u201cnews.\u201d In these situations, journalists are aware that media stories may be the basis for public actions and public policy having consequences measured in degrees of human health or, more rarely, in lives.",

In contrast with the \u201cnon-symbolic operations of nature,\u201d (Burke 1989), Burke describes the distinction at its most basic by noting:there is the self-evident distinction between symbol and symbolized (in the sense that the word \u2018tree\u2019 is categorically distinguishable from the thing tree)\u2026.one can at least begin with this sufficiently clear distinction between a \u2018thing\u2019 and its name. (1989: 53; emphasis in original)For Burke, language is not about defining the-thing-called-tree as tree, rather, what draws his attention is that an act is being performed when the word (or symbol) \u201ctree\u201d is attributed to the-thing-called-tree (1989: 53). Thus, he argues language is \u201can aspect of \u2018action,\u2019 that is, as \u2018symbolic action\u2019\u201d (114). As such, language becomes a much more generative field of interpretation than simply \u201cas means of conveying information\u201d (1966: 54).",

The virus becomes a backdrop against which the ability of public health authorities to respond quickly and efficiently is called into question through the creation of opposition between health authorities. These texts create opposition between authoritative officials from organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO), on the one hand, and a regional official on the other (e.g., Alphonso 2009). Terministically, the journalist identifies with the messages of one source and invites the audience to do so as well. This is illustrated by a number of direct quotes from the featured source (e.g., regional official Dr. Michael Gardam in Alphonso 2009). The rhetor invites the audience to identify with this source, via the number of direct quotes from Dr. Gardam as opposed to any other authority in the piece, many of which feature the first-person pronoun (i.e., \u201cIn my mind\u201d; \u201cI understand that\u201d; \u201cI am assuming\u201d; \u201cMy own personal opinion\u201d; \u201cif I was planning\u201d; \u201cif I was hearing\u201d; \u201cI would probably rethink\u201d). Direct quotes from other health authorities are in contrast shorter and fewer in number; more often paraphrasing occurs instead. The portrayal of Dr. Gardam functions to discredit the elements of reassurance provided through other authorities\u2014such as the WHO\u2014represented in the text.

It should be noted that water is not a recognized vector for influenza transmission.1 Concern for audience needs, and consequently recognition of audience agency, is given somewhat greater prominence, as the outbreak and its attendant health threats are presented from a perspective contrasting with the sanctioned one (e.g., the contention, represented at the time by the Public Health Agency of Canada, that it is still safe for Canadians to travel to Mexico).",

One journalist points out that despite a relatively low number of deaths, SARS hurt markets and had a particular impact on the airline industry (Deveau 2009). In other words, in these texts, H1N1 is portrayed as a harbinger of chaos. Stories focus on the virus as mutating and spreading, or on the broader concept of \u201cpandemic\u201d as a consequence of the virus\u2019 spread. These texts convey high anxiety, describing the beginning of a long-forecasted pandemic and its anticipated impacts, both biological and economic. Journalists describe the vulnerability of health officials to respond to it effectively, and, in contrast to the neutral language of the public-health motif, they emphasize the potency of the virus. Texts feature terms such as \u201cmutated\u201d; \u201cmulti-strain\u201d; and \u201cpandemic-type\u201d (Nicholson 2009) to describe the virus. Texts here do not suggest means of protection, at the level of individuals or otherwise. In sum, a pandemic is to be feared and this is reflected in the terminology used to describe it. Reassurance is largely absent and avenues of protection do not exist: rather than offering the development of a vaccine as reassuring, journalists emphasize that currently there is no vaccine (e.g., Branswell 2009; Nicholson 2009).

Means of protection are absent from media stories and terms such as \u201cplague\u201d and \u201cexplosion\u201d are used to characterize the \u201cscene\u201d of the outbreak (e.g., Branswell 2009). In this drama, the audience is united. To use Priscilla Wald\u2019s terminology, when we acknowledge common susceptibility, we accept common humanity (2007: 54). Consequently, I suggest the purpose of journalists adopting this role is to warn audiences against one universal threat. This role is also un-represented in existing literature.",

In terms of \u201cshares\u201d on Twitter, the authors found, similarly, that content drawn from traditional media (specifically, newspapers) was more likely to be shared, than content from a blog or tweet.

Even with the burgeoning uptake of social media, Jones and Salath\u00e9 (2009) found that audiences still preferred traditional media as a source of information during the H1N1 outbreak, even while public health organizations such as the CDC add social media to their outbreak communication strategies.

Kenneth Burke asserts that \u201cdifferent frameworks of interpretation will lead to different conclusions as to what reality is\u201d (1984: 35). I argue that divergent rhetorical motifs influence the delivery of health information by the media in the context of a pandemic. First, the public health motif supported a view of the outbreak as posing little threat, and as easily managed by the health care system. The \u201cevidence\u201d for this motif originated in clusters of association in which the H1N1 virus was linked with the term \u201cmild,\u201d with \u201ccommon flu,\u201d and was dissociated from the term \u201cpandemic,\u201d which in some texts was completely absent. H1N1 was also dissociated from the more frightening, more dangerous SARS outbreak. Health officials are hierarchically privileged, and journalist-rhetors are fully engaged in the communication of protective information, refraining from meta-commentary on the nature of the scene or the content of officials\u2019 remarks. Audiences accepting this motif, despite being provided with information regarding personal protective measures, could place their faith in the protective capacity of the public health system and dissociate themselves from implementing steps to maintain health.",

Here, the vulnerability of the public health system appears, with some authorities expressing \u201cconcern.\u201d Audiences subscribing to this motif could deflect risk through symbolic means as opposed to implementing protective behaviours (e.g., the threat is not biological in nature, but rather is a potential lack of transparency on the part of authorities).",

Journalist-rhetors featuring this motif view the challenge as the intensely dramatic nature of the outbreak, and function to \u201cmythologize\u201d the outbreak to the exclusion of other functions of the text. Texts exhibiting this motif do not offer reassurance of any kind. Texts exhibiting this motif reject possibilities of \u201cmild\u201d disease and of the outbreak tapering off.
