This was relevant to the study because it revealed insights about the farmers\u2019 understandings of animal welfare, especially confinement, which is also applicable to their treatment and production of livestock. All of the dogs encountered by the interviewers were tethered with limited room for movement (similar to the pigs which were confined in small cramped backyard pigsties). The dogs were regarded as guard dogs rather than pets as there was an absence of pet-keeping among the farmers who emphasised the commoditisation of animals. Discussions revealed the dogs had been tethered for hours, days, months and years, although some farmers took them for daily walks. Reasons given by the participants for dog-tethering included concerns about protection of property, as guard dogs barked when approached by people; the dogs would run away from home or be stolen or eaten by others; and they could bite or injure people. The participants did not report any appreciable knowledge of the welfare needs of their dogs such as companionship and interaction with people, and they did not know the dogs could suffer physical and psychological harm being permanently tied with limited room for movement. Only two participants thought dogs and farm animals would not be happy when confined.

That the study identified gaps in the farmers\u2019 knowledge justifies veterinary health education activities to provide factual information about animal influenza, especially to encourage action for its prevention and containment on farms. The paucity of knowledge about influenza among the farmers may suggest deficiencies in the Chinese government\u2019s nationwide awareness campaigns which might not be reaching ethnic minority groups or issues understanding the health information people receive. However, there were demographic differences as older participants were less knowledgeable of animal influenza and were less likely to take action when their animals showed signs of disease. This is most likely because they were less educated than younger people and fluent only in Dai Lue language, whereas younger people have attended school, understand Mandarin (the official language of China) and have a higher exposure to media. Older participants also reported temporal comparisons, such as changes in farming conditions in recent decades, and were more experienced and knowledgeable of folk medicine for animals as it was popular in times past.",

(2015) which observed low awareness and lack of concern of avian influenza and human infection as well as low rates of protective measures. Similarly, Lau et al. (2009) found widespread public misconceptions about animal influenza in a Chinese city. However, other studies suggest some segments of the Chinese public have a better understanding of influenza as well as greater compliance with government advice and recommended behaviour changes (Goodwin and Sun 2013, 2014). Sampling most likely accounts for this difference as the majority of previous studies sampled urban and Han participants, whereas the present sample had rural and low education and socio-economic backgrounds. This should be taken into account when interpreting the findings, which is consistent with earlier work which illustrated differential threat perceptions among urban and rural residents (Liao et al. 2009). Therefore, sampling farmers or the general public with higher education and socio-economic levels might reveal greater awareness of animal influenza and its prevention and control. The low socio-economic background of the farmers in the present study is also important because the poorest segments of the population are more at risk of contracting zoonotic diseases and carry the heaviest burden, which creates obstacles for socio-economic development (Gilbert 2012; Liu et al. 2014; World Health Organization 2006).",

Dai society is obviously not the \u2018risk society\u2019 that characterises the so-called post-industrial modern societies, as the farmers did not seem to care about the risks associated with influenza. Some Dai cultural traditions likely augment zoonotic infection, for example, the attribution of influenza to supernatural beliefs such as evil spirits, which reduces confidence in the utility of veterinary services, and the close proximity of farmers and animals in old-style houses, as physical closeness to animals is associated with zoonotic risk (Klous et al. 2016). This reveals important information about the types of contact between humans and livestock for disease transmission in this group of people.",
