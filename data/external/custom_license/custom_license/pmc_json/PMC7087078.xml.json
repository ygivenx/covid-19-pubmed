The virus is the etiological agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), an acute and highly contagious enteric disease characterized by watery diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, and high mortality in nursery piglets [1]. PEDV was first recognized as the causative agent of PED in Belgium [2] and the United Kingdom in 1978 [3]. The presence of PED in China was confirmed, by immunofluorescence assays and serum neutralization tests, in 1984. Bivalent killed or attenuated vaccines have been used to prevent transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) and PED in China since then. Clinical PED outbreaks have reemerged in the major pig-producing areas of China since December 2010, resulting in major losses of suckling piglets. Morbidity rates between 90 and100 % have been observed, with mortalities of 70\u2013100 % on affected pig farms [4].",

A number of molecular investigations have been conducted, revealing different levels of variation in nucleotide sequences among PEDV isolates [5\u20137]. Because of incomplete genomic information, most molecular epidemiological analyses have targeted a single gene of PEDV. To date, complete genome sequences of 18 PEDV strains, including 10 endemic Chinese isolates, have been submitted to the GenBank database [4, 8\u201319]. To better understand the diversity, epidemiology and molecular characteristics of PEDV isolates in China, we sequenced the complete genome of a virulent PEDV strain from Henan Province, China. This isolate was from a suckling piglet that exhibited severe diarrhea. We compared its genomic sequence with those of other Chinese PEDV isolates and reference strains.",

When confluent, growth medium was removed, and cell monolayers were washed once with PBS and then with DMEM containing 0.3 % tryptose phosphate broth and 0.02 % yeast extract. The washed cells were infected with the filtered intestinal preparation that had been resuspended in \u2018infection medium\u2019 (DMEM, 0.3 % tryptose phosphate broth, 0.02 % yeast extract, and 10 \u03bcg/ml trypsin). After adsorption at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h, an equal volume of infection medium was added. Every 24 h, the culture supernatants were supplied with trypsin at 80 % of the initial concentration.

Our findings indicate that the current PEDV isolate prevailing in China is a novel strain with a variant S gene that is distinct from previous Chinese and reference strains. This could explain the less-effective immunological protection against PEDV strains induced by the current vaccine in China, and the effectiveness of feeding sows feces or intestinal contents of infected piglets.
