It has been established that the majority of exacerbations are provoked by viral respiratory infections, most notably rhinoviruses (RVs); however, exacerbations also occur in the absence of infections1,2. Furthermore, even in children with severe asthma, the majority of respiratory infections do not progress to exacerbation3. The fundamental question of why some but not all colds lead to exacerbations has not been fully answered, and the similarities and differences between the mechanism(s) of virus-associated and nonviral exacerbations are unknown. Identifying the molecular pathways underlying progression from colds to exacerbations has the potential to improve understanding of the mechanisms of these events and, from this information, to target therapeutic strategies more precisely and effectively.",

However, these therapies reduce, rather than eliminate, exacerbations and do not correct the physiological abnormalities of asthma, thereby confirming the contribution of additional factors to the genesis of exacerbations7. Respiratory epithelial inflammation, in particular IL-33 signaling, has been demonstrated to have an important role in RV-induced exacerbations8. Several additional immune pathways have been linked to asthma exacerbations, generally through targeted investigations9. Current evidence has yet to fully establish how multiple interacting molecular pathways may lead to asthma exacerbations.",

This approach has added novel information to the understanding of asthma11\u201314; however, previous asthma \u2018omics\u2019 studies have not been designed to determine molecular networks specific to asthma exacerbations. We have therefore performed the first study in asthma that uses transcriptome network analysis in a case\u2013control, longitudinal study design. In our study, we prospectively evaluated a cohort of children with high disease burden. We combined nasal virus PCR, nasal and peripheral blood cell differentials, and nasal and blood RNA-seq for serial sample collections at baseline and longitudinally during episodes when participants reported cold symptoms to determine the key molecular pathways associated with subsequent asthma exacerbations. We combined cell deconvolution, weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA), and linear mixed-effects modeling to establish the repertoires of cellular transcriptional pathways underpinning asthma exacerbations, including distinct pathways in virus-associated and nonviral exacerbations, the kinetics of these pathways leading to exacerbations, predictors of exacerbation risk, and the responses to systemic corticosteroid therapy. Our results constitute an unbiased, detailed, and sensitive systems-level mechanistic summary that substantially advances understanding of the immunopathogenesis of asthma exacerbations. Moreover, these methods provide a framework for in vivo investigation of mechanisms of therapeutic intervention.",

Of the 154 total events captured in 106 children, 47 were Ex+ events and 107 were Ex\u2013 events. All Ex+ events had one or two samples collected prior to initiation of systemic corticosteroids, and these samples were used for the primary analysis. When comparing the Ex+ and Ex\u2013 events, there were no differences in demographic variables or in nasal or blood cell differentials (Table 1). Virus PCR and partial sequencing were used to identify events associated with a respiratory virus (V+) or virus-negative (V\u2013) events; 66.2% of events had a detectable respiratory virus, and, of these, 53.9% were positive for RV-A or RV-C. However, there were no differences in virus frequency or type when comparing Ex+ and Ex\u2013 events. Pulmonary functions were assessed at baseline and during events. Only Ex+ events were associated with significant decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) predicted (%) and FEV1 to forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) ratio, demonstrating a change in pathophysiological measures of lung function associated with the standardized clinical definition of asthma exacerbation used in the study (Fig. 2).",

Gene expression levels measured in nasal samples were associated with percentages of neutrophils, lymphocytes, macrophages, eosinophils, respiratory epithelial cells (termed \u2018epithelium\u2019), and/or squamous epithelial cells (termed \u2018squamous\u2019) in nasal samples. Gene expression levels measured in peripheral blood were associated with percentages of neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and/or basophils in peripheral blood. By applying this modular framework, we compared Ex+ and Ex\u2013 events to identify immune pathways underlying asthma exacerbations. Expression patterns in 13 nasal modules were statistically significantly associated with exacerbations at false-discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05, 11 of which had increased expression in Ex+ events and 2 of which had decreased expression (Table 2); 6 of these modules had FDR < 0.001 (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 2a). In contrast, there were no significant differences in expression for the blood modules. The comparison was adjusted for cell percentages and the presence or absence of virus during cold symptoms; these variables were the primary sources of variability in module expression (Supplementary Fig. 3) but were not different between the Ex+ and Ex\u2013 groups. Our results therefore suggest that the observed differences are predominantly due to changes in gene expression in specific cell types as opposed to changes in cell population composition. Each of the differentially expressed modules represents a significant protein\u2013protein interaction network (enrichment P < 0.001) that includes important known asthma-associated genes but also demonstrates a much broader functional network (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 2b).",

We compared module expression levels to the time from baseline to the first asthma exacerbation. Four nasal modules were significantly associated with time to exacerbation (P < 0.05; Supplementary Table 3). To determine the optimal model, we performed forward stepwise regression with the significant modules. Two of these modules, \u2018type 2 inflammation\u2019 and \u2018type I IFN response\u2019, each independently contributed significantly to overall model fit (beta coefficient, P < 0.05), and the model incorporating both of these modules showed significantly better fit (ANOVA, P < 0.05) than either univariate model. Specifically, higher expression of the \u2018type 2 inflammation\u2019 module and lower expression of the \u2018type I IFN response\u2019 module were associated with a shorter time to exacerbation. When related to exacerbation probability, an elevated ratio of \u2018type 2 inflammation\u2019 to \u2018type I IFN response\u2019 expression corresponded to a highly significant risk for exacerbation in the short term, with individuals in the highest quartile having a significantly shorter time to exacerbation than individuals in the lower three quartiles (P < 0.001) and >50% risk of an exacerbation in the first 30 d after the baseline visit (Fig. 5a). This expression ratio was a better predictor of short-term exacerbation risk than any of the collected clinical variables, such as baseline FEV1 predicted (%) (Fig. 5b). These results show that a baseline gene expression pattern constituting high expression of nasal type 2 inflammation genes and low expression of type I IFN response genes is a robust predictor of short-term exacerbation risk.",

Corticosteroids induced broad changes in immune pathways, altering the expression of 11 nasal modules and nasal eosinophil and neutrophil percentages, as well as the expression of 6 blood modules and blood eosinophil and neutrophil percentages (FDR < 0.05; Supplementary Table 4).

Expression of genes in the \u2018eosinophil activation/mucus hypersecretion\u2019 and \u2018SMAD3-related cell differentiation\u2019 modules returned to levels equivalent to baseline after initiation of systemic corticosteroids (Fig. 6a); however, the other four core exacerbation modules did not show a significant change in expression with systemic corticosteroids.

SMADs are signaling proteins that are a surrogate for TGF-\u03b2 activity31 and are known to have a central role in airway inflammation and remodeling in asthma; SMAD3 is required for airway remodeling in mice32. We observe that this pathway is upregulated in exacerbations regardless of the apparent trigger and upregulation is an early, central event in exacerbation development. This observation may represent a mechanism central to the link between repeated exacerbations and decline in lung function33, with TGF-\u03b2 activity inducing SMAD3 signaling within the epithelial\u2013mesenchymal-trophic unit to enhance airway remodeling34.",

            "text": "We demonstrate that high type 2 inflammation and low type I IFN response gene expression in nasal samples at baseline predicts short-term exacerbation risk, building on previous results showing that nasal IL13 expression is associated with exacerbation likelihood30. This suggests a specific \u2018at-risk\u2019 immune state, when a child is highly susceptible to exacerbation. Furthermore, our results provide insight into conflicting data regarding antiviral IFN responses in asthma from earlier studies, in which some have shown relative deficiency in IFN responses44,45 whereas others have shown normal or excessive responses46,47. Our data show that both observations may be valid; IFN responses may not be consistently diminished or elevated, but rather dysregulated. Low IFN signaling at baseline may enable viral replication and/or epithelial damage during the early phase of infection, which secondarily induces an exaggerated IFN response promoting exacerbation. We show that systemic corticosteroid treatment affects only a subset of exacerbation-associated pathways, in particular those related to eosinophil activation and mucus hypersecretion, type 2 inflammation, and epithelial SMAD3 signaling. The failure of corticosteroids to moderate other pathways, including EGFR signaling and ECM production, may help to explain why corticosteroid treatment has limited efficacy in preventing lung function decline48. This result also provides an example of definition of the in vivo molecular effects of therapeutics, which is critical to improving interventional approaches.",

By using daily symptom monitoring, we captured events at the beginning of symptoms prior to both clinical exacerbation and initiation of systemic corticosteroids, while also capturing follow-up samples to investigate progression of the immune response and the effect of systemic corticosteroids. By using transcriptome network analysis, we were able to investigate our aims in an unbiased manner, leading to the discovery of new findings while also confirming and expanding upon anticipated results. Through serially combining two powerful network analysis techniques, cell deconvolution and WGCNA, in a novel algorithm, we distilled a massive dataset into coherent, statistically rigorous, and biologically meaningful conclusions.",

Previous work has demonstrated that nasal epithelial expression profiles are globally similar to those of the lower airway30 and are specifically similar in key pathways, including aspects of remodeling49, but there is also evidence of differences in certain immune pathways, including interferon responses50. It is possible that we have missed aspects of the lower-airway inflammatory response by not directly sampling the lower airway during illness. However, the clear differences between Ex+ and Ex\u2013 events and the corresponding decrease in pulmonary functions suggest that our findings reflect molecular pathways directly relevant to the pathophysiology of exacerbations. Paired upper- and lower-airway samples collected in future work can build upon our results. By collecting lavage from the upper airway, we obtained samples that were mixtures of inflammatory and epithelial cells. Given the clear importance of respiratory epithelium in viral infections and asthma, future studies could use epithelial brushings as a means to potentially further define the role of the epithelium in exacerbations.",

This strategy revealed coordinated epithelial and eosinophil pathways that are upregulated as well as lymphocyte pathways that are downregulated in both virus-associated and nonviral exacerbations. We also found distinct responses in viral and nonviral exacerbation events and identified baseline characteristics associated with susceptibility to exacerbations. Finally, we have developed a new sample collection and analysis platform that can be readily integrated into translational asthma research. Collectively, we anticipate that these approaches will advance understanding of both the efficacy of current and novel intervention strategies and unresponsiveness to these strategies in some treated individuals, thereby leading to a clearer and more comprehensive understanding of asthma exacerbations and how to prevent and treat them.",

Single-read sequencing was carried out on a HiSeq 2500 sequencer (Illumina), by using the HiSeq SBS v4 kit to generate 58-base reads, with a target of approximately 10 million reads per sample. Samples were sequenced in four batches and repeated samples were used across batches to allow assessment for batch effects. Resulting bcl files were deconvoluted and converted to fastq format by using Casava from Illumina. fastq files were aligned to the Ensembl version of the human genome (GRCh38; GenBank assembly GCA_000001405.15) with TopHat (version 1.4.1)55. The single-paired flag was set to \u2018single\u2019, while all other TopHat parameters were set to default. HTSeq-count56 was used to generate gene counts with the mode set to \u2018Intersection (nonempty)\u2019 and the minimum alignment quality set to 0; parameters were otherwise set to default. In quality-control analysis, samples were kept that had >0.3 million counts, >0.66 percent alignment, and median CV coverage of <1.5. Genes were filtered to include those that had a trimmed mean of M value (TMM) normalization count of at least 1 in at least 10% of libraries and were classified as protein coding with BioMart57. Each of the four sample batches was independently normalized within the batch via TMM normalization and values were transformed to log2 (counts per million) along with observations level weights by using voomWithQualityWeights from the limma R package58,59. Batch processing did not contribute variability in gene expression due to batch effects, so the replicate with the highest percentage alignment was included for analysis and the other replicates were removed. The final dataset included 374 nasal samples composed of 13,672 genes and 387 blood samples composed of 13,316 genes.",

We selected the model providing the lowest Akaike information criterion that had significant P values for each beta coefficient, which was a linear combination of two modules. Samples were divided into quartiles according to their scaled combined expression value for the two modules. A Kaplan\u2013Meier curve showing the exacerbation probability over time was fit to the data splitting individuals according to quartile. The lower three quartiles overlapped and were each significantly different from the top quartile, and they were therefore combined. For comparison, a Kaplan\u2013Meier curve was generated on the basis of FEV1 predicted (%) split at 80% or split by quartile. For the Kaplan\u2013Meier curves, time was censored at 100 d for display purposes, but the results are similar when using the entire length of follow-up.",
