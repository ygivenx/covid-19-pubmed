Temporal analysis using time series algorithms is a conventional approach due to its simplicity when compared with spatial algorithms, which require additional geographical information. One of the algorithms, the wavelet anomaly detector (WAD) algorithm [4] developed by the University of Pittsburgh, is used in the Realtime Outbreak and Disease Surveillance (RODS) system. It computes a score for each unit (e.g., ZIP code) area based on how many standard deviations that the number of the cases from that area in the most recent day is elevated from the expected, and then reports all the areas with higher-than-threshold scores. Some other algorithms applying temporal analysis have also been explored in [5,6,7].",

There are two approaches for spatial and tempo-spatial algorithms: the frequentist approach and the Bayesian approach. A representative algorithm using frequentist approach is the spatial scan statistic (KSS) developed by Kulldorff et. al. in 1997 [8], which scans the region of interest for clusters using circular windows of various sizes. Each scanning window may cover a number of ZIP code areas and is considered as a cluster candidate. This frequentist approach uses a likelihood-ratio test, a statistical test used to compare the fit of two models: the null hypothesis (no outbreaks in a region) model and the alternative hypothesis (an outbreak in a region) model, to find a window (cluster) with maximum likelihood ratio. The derivatives of KSS include the elliptic spatial scan statistic and the flexible spatial scan statistic (FSS), which are derived by relaxing the constraint of a circular cluster shape (window) [9,10].",

It computes the posterior probability of the alternative hypothesis H1, P(H1(S)|Data), in a region S. It creates a conjugate Gamma-Poisson model to compute the posterior probability of having an outbreak in region S. BSS employs a rectangular scanning window (aligning with x and y axes) to search for clusters over a m \u00d7 m grid covering the whole region of interest. Each window can comprise one or more grid cells and is considered as a potential cluster. The algorithm identifies the outbreak cluster with the highest posterior probability of having an outbreak. Another spatial clustering algorithm recently developed by the authors, the rank-based spatial clustering (RSC), employs a different searching scheme which has been demonstrated to improve computational complexity [12].",

In order to define the alert threshold, Pt, used by the detection algorithms, we applied the analysis to each of the 365 days between April 1, 2008 and March 31, 2009 and recorded the highest score for each day. This allows us to calculate the false alarm rate as i/365 if pt is the i-th greatest in the set of 365 recorded scores. The assumption here is that during the 3-year period before April 1, 2009, there were no H1N1 pandemics.

In addition, Fig. 6 shows the geographical distribution of the ZIP code areas with significantly elevated thermometers sales from April 25, 2009 to April 30, 2009, using the same color scheme to represent the two significance levels. As shown in both figures, the number of significantly elevated ZIP code areas stayed low (less than 20 ZIP codes) before April 27. From our past experience, the spikes shown in these areas probably resulted from an imperfect data collection process or from some other stochastic reasons (e.g., non-continuous data reporting from some stores) since the spikes are distributed randomly and only last for a day (see Fig. 6(a), 6(b)). However, starting from April 27, 66 ZIP code areas simultaneously signaled alarms. Furthermore, the thermometer sales stayed significantly high for several days, until around May 7, and the number of significantly elevated ZIP codes exceeded 100 on April 29 and April 30 (in Fig. 6(c-f)). More specifically, the same ZIP codes in the counties Nueces, Travis, Bexar, Collin, Dallas and later El Paso, Bowie, Tarrant and Cameron, repeatedly reported significantly elevated thermometers sales within those days. These results suggest that WAD was able to detect the significant increase on April 27, 2009, by identifying 66 ZIP code areas in about 20 counties showing a significantly elevated amount of thermometer purchases from those drug stores under surveillance.",

The first day BSS fired an alarm was April 30, 2009 which was 3 days later than WAD did. It reported a cluster including 409 out of total 581 ZIP codes with the posterior probabilities above the threshold corresponding to one false alarm per month (Fig. 7(a)). The cluster was located in the eastern central part of Texas. On the next day, May 1, 2009, BSS fired the 2nd alarm with a cluster comprising 272 ZIP codes with significance of one false alarm per two months (Fig. 7(b)). Fig. 7 shows that the cluster had become more localized and moved to the southeast. However, during the first 6 days of the real outbreak, from April 24, 2009 to April 29, 2009, BSS did not identify any significant cluster. It is also worth noting that after May 1, although the counts of thermometers sales were still high, BSS did not fire any alarms at all for the rest of days within the evaluation period (except for May 5, when a 3 ZIP code cluster was found but was believed to be a false alarm).",

The slow timeliness of BSS in this study compared with WAD can be attributed to the violation of the basic assumption that only one outbreak cluster can occur at the same point in time in different geographic regions. Therefore, in order to rapidly detect a pandemic, such as the 2009 H1N1 flu outbreak, which takes place in multiple distant places in a sudden and simultaneous way, our results show that the spatial models with the one-cluster assumption are not preferred.",

Time series algorithms are less robust on noisy data (e.g., caused by imperfect data collection process, etc.) since they signal alarms whenever the deviation of the observed counts from the expected counts in an area exceeds a threshold. Thus, a secondary analysis is recommended to be performed. A secondary analysis may include 1) considering the output for the previous days as well to determine if the newly alarmed areas are correlated with the previous ones; 2) studying if there is a data quality problem that may cause an abnormal increase of sales; and 3) waiting for the outcome from the next time period to make better decision.",

In the study dataset, the number of thermometer sales is much higher than the number of confirmed cases each day at the end of April. This implies that a big proportion of the elevated thermometer purchases possibly were not due to H1N1 infection but other reasons. Although the literature has shown that OTC data can be used to predict number of cases in Emergency Departments [26], research on the relationship between OTC sales and medical treatment seeking is still needed especially by the people from the public health or social behavioral fields, such as the study on the relations between hospitality and behaviors during outbreaks [29,30].",

Our experimental design was restricted to analyzing only one type of data (i.e., the OTC thermometer sales) due to data availability. Some public health organizations or biosurveillance systems, however, may have more than one possible data source (e.g., emergency department patient visits, etc.) available, which to some extent may contain better signals of H1N1 pandemic. Also it would be ideal to analyze multiple states of data and to use ED data to create a better gold standard in terms of deciding outbreak onset period. We hope in the future to use ISDS distribute project data for a larger scale study. Furthermore, the comparison in this study was only performed between one spatial algorithm and one time series algorithm. Evaluation using other algorithms (e.g., moving average, the spatial scan statistic, etc.) would be helpful to support our findings. In addition, this study only used one known H1N1 pandemic to test the performance of the two algorithms; thus confidence interval for timeliness is not available.",

Although the spatial algorithm was more robust (fewer false alarms) and informative (suggesting geographical distribution of outbreaks) than the pure time series algorithm, our results suggest that the time series analysis is still desirable in detection of pandemics as it may achieve a more sensitive performance with better timeliness. The use of time series algorithms, therefore, is still necessary for rapid outbreak detection, especially in scenarios where the single-cluster assumption does not hold. Instead of replacing the time series algorithms, we suggest epidemiologists or biomedical informaticians apply time series algorithms as a complement to current spatial algorithms for public health surveillance purposes.",
