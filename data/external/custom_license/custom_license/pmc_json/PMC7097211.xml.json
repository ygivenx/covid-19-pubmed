            "text": "For small viruses, such as HIV, influenza virus, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), the sequencing of partial genomes has been widely used for research, but it also has important clinical applications. One of the main applications and reasons for sequencing viruses is the detection of drug resistance. For example, the management of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for HIV relies on viral sequencing for the detection of drug-resistant variants. HAART has substantially improved the survival of patients who have HIV, but successful therapy requires long-term suppression of viral replication with antiretroviral drugs, which may be prevented by impaired host immunity, suboptimal drug penetration in certain tissue compartments and incomplete adherence to therapy19. When viral replication continues despite treatment, the high mutation rate of HIV enables resistant variants to develop. It has become standard practice in many parts of the world to sequence the HIV pol gene, which encodes the main viral enzymes, to detect variants that confer resistance to inhibitors of reverse transcriptase, integrase or protease20, particularly when patients are first diagnosed and when viral loads indicate treatment failure. Sequencing resistant variants has enabled targeted changes in treatment, which has resulted in greater reductions in viral loads than with standard care (undetectable HIV load in 32% versus 14% of patients after six months)21,22. Thus, sequencing resistant variants to guide HIV treatment improves disease outcomes. Similar approaches have been used to identify resistant variants of HCV23, HBV24 and influenza virus25.",

            "text": "Limited sequencing of the small number of genes that encode targets of antiviral agents, such as HIV pol, has been the norm in clinical practice. For the detection of a limited number of antiviral-resistant variants, WGS has been too costly and labour-intensive to use compared with sequencing only the specific genes that are targeted by the drugs. However, the increasing number of resistance genes that are located across viral genomes, together with decreasing costs of sequencing and the use of sequence data for transmission studies, are driving a reappraisal of the need for WGS. For example, antiviral treatment for HCV now targets four gene products (NS3, NS4A, NS5A and NS5B), and these genes encompass more than 50% of the viral genome26. Individually sequencing each of these genes can be as expensive and time-consuming as WGS27. Partial-genome sequencing is particularly problematic for large viral genomes, in particular those of the herpesviruses HCMV12, varicella zoster virus (VZV)28, herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1)29 and HSV-2 (Ref. 30). These viruses have traditionally been treated with drugs that target the viral thymidine or serine/threonine protein kinases and DNA polymerase. However, the increasing number of drugs in development that interact with different proteins that are encoded by viral genes scattered across the genome, means that targeted sequencing for resistance testing is costly, involves more PCR reactions (which increases the chance of failure), requires more starting material, is more labour intensive and generally less tractable for diagnostic use31. Sequencing the whole genome simultaneously captures all resistant variants and removes the need to design and optimize PCR assays for the detection of resistance to new drugs. A good example of this is HCMV, for which WGS can simultaneously capture the genes that encode targets of licensed therapies, such as UL27 (unknown function), UL54 (DNA polymerase) and UL97 (serine/threonine protein kinase), and of newer drugs, such as letermovir, which targets UL56 (terminase complex). This enables comprehensive antiviral-resistance testing in a single test12. In addition, WGS can provide information on antigenic epitopes, virus evolution in a patient over time12, and evidence of recombination between HCMV strains32. WGS can also detect putative novel drug-resistant variants and predict changes to epitopes, although phenotypic testing of variants is required to confirm clinical resistance33 and to map epitope changes34.",

The numerous phylogenetically informative variant sites that can be obtained from full-length or near full-length genomes removes the need for high-quality sequences, which enabled the robust linking of cases of Ebola virus infection and public health interventions in real time during the 2015 epidemic39.

Minority variant analysis is particularly powerful for RNA viruses, reverse-transcribing DNA viruses and retroviruses, because they typically show high diversity, even in a single host. HIV is the classic example; the reverse transcriptase of HIV is error-prone and introduces mutations at an extremely high rate (4.1 \u00b1 1.7 \u00d7 10\u22123 per base per cell)45. Many closely related, but subtly different, viral variants exist in a single patient. These variants are sometimes described as a quasispecies or a cloud of intra-host virus diversity. The presence of a mixed population of viruses introduces problems for the determination of the true consensus 'majority' sequence, but these minority (non-consensus) variants may also change the clinical phenotype of the virus, and can be used to predict changes in genotype, tropism or drug resistance. For example, a minor variant that confers drug resistance in HIV that is present in only 2.1% of sequencing reads in a patient at baseline can rapidly become the majority (consensus) variant under the selective pressure of drug treatment46. Similar changes in the frequency of resistance-associated alleles during treatment have been observed for HBV47, HCV48, HCMV12 and influenza virus49.",

Maraviroc is a CCR5 antagonist that blocks infection of R5-tropic HIV, but not of X4-tropic and R5X4-tropic HIV. Just a 2% frequency of X4 or R5X4 genotypes is predictive of maraviroc treatment failure50. Sub-consensus frequencies of X4-tropic or R5X4-tropic HIV are also important for the success51 and failure52 of bone marrow transplants from CCR5-deficient (CCR5-\u039432) donors, and this information may influence the decision to stop antiviral therapy in these patients51.",

Many studies of drug resistance in HIV that use deep-sequencing of PCR amplicons require minority variants to be present at >1% to decrease the possibility of false-positive results56,57. This may miss drug-resistance mutations at frequencies of 0.1\u20131% and lead to poor treatment outcome57. Although a 1\u20132% frequency threshold (or lower) may be clinically relevant for the detection of drug resistance in HIV, it is less clear whether the same degree of sensitivity is required for monitoring vaccine escape in HBV or drug resistance in herpesviruses (discussed below).

Metagenomic approaches have been used extensively for pathogen discovery and for the characterization of microbial diversity in environmental and clinical samples60,61. Total DNA and/or RNA, including from the host, bacteria, viruses, fungi and other pathogens, are extracted from a sample, and a library is prepared and sequenced by shotgun sequencing or RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Box 1 explores the diagnostic applications for metagenomics and RNA-seq; for example, in encephalitis of unknown aetiology62,63,64, for which conventional methods such as PCR are often not diagnostic, metagenomics and RNA-seq have detected viral infections65,66,67 and other causes68 of encephalitis. In addition, these methods have been used to sequence the whole genome of some viruses, including Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV)69 and HCV27. However, in clinical specimens, the presence of contaminating nucleic acids from the host and commensal microorganisms58 (Table 2) decreases sensitivity. The proportion of reads that match the target virus genome from metagenomic WGS is often low; for example, 0.008% for EBV in the blood of a healthy adult70, 0.0003% for Lassa virus in clinical samples71 and 0.3% for Zika virus in a sample that was enriched for virus particles through filtration and centrifugation72. The read depth is often inadequate to detect resistance27 and the cost is high. Thus, metagenomic sequencing has typically only been carried out on a small number of samples for research purposes72,73. The concentration of virus particles (see the Zika virus example above72), depletion of host material and/or sequencing to high read depth can increase the amount of virus sequence, but all of these methods add to the cost. The concentration of virus particles from clinical specimens by antibody-mediated pull-down (for example, virus discovery based on complementary DNA (cDNA)\u2013amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), abbreviated to VIDISCA), filtration, ultracentrifugation and the depletion of free nucleic acids, which mostly come from the host, have all been tried74,75,76,77; however, these methods may also decrease the total amount of viral nucleic acids so that it is insufficient for preparing a sequencing library. Non-specific amplification methods, such as multiple displacement amplification (MDA), which make use of random primers and \u03a629 polymerases, can increase the DNA yield. However, these approaches are time consuming, costly, and may increase the risk of biases, errors and contamination, without necessarily improving sensitivity78,79. Moreover, the proportion of host reads often remains high80.",

PCR amplification of viral genetic material using primers that are complementary to a known nucleotide sequence has been the most common approach for enriching small viral genomes, such as HIV and influenza virus. Recent examples of PCR amplicon enrichment followed by WGS include phylogenetic analysis of a measles virus outbreak at the 2010 Winter Olympics85 and tracking the recent Ebola virus39 and Zika virus (Box 2) epidemics. PCR amplicon WGS of norovirus, which has a genome size of 7.5 kb, has been used to understand virus transmission in community86 and hospital87 settings, which revealed both independent introductions of the pathogen to the hospital and nosocomial transmission despite measures to control infection87. Other PCR-based deep-sequencing studies have generated several whole genomes of influenza virus88 (\u223c13.5 kb), dengue virus89 (\u223c11 kb) and HCV90 (9.6 kb). This was feasible because these viruses all have relatively small genomes that require only a few PCR amplicons to assemble whole-genome sequences. However, the heterogeneity of RNA viruses, such as HCV27, norovirus86, rabies virus91 and RSV38, may necessitate the use of multiple overlapping sets of primers to ensure the amplification of all genotypes. PCR amplicon sequencing is more successful for WGS from samples that have low virus concentrations than metagenomic methods27, although other methods such as target enrichment of viral sequences may work equally well in such samples, as shown for norovirus samples92.",

This limits the number of suitable samples that are available and also the genomes that can be studied using this method. For example, 8\u201319 PCR products were required to amplify the genome of Ebola virus39, and two studies of norovirus needed 14 and 22 PCR products, respectively86,87. For clinical applications this is problematic because of the high laboratory workload that is associated with numerous discrete PCR reactions, the necessity for individually normalizing concentrations of different PCR amplicons before pooling, the increasing probability of reaction failure due to primer mismatch (particularly for highly variable viruses), and the high costs of labour and consumables94. Therefore, although PCR-based sequencing of viruses as large as 250 kb is technically possible, the proportional relationship between genome size and technical complexity make PCR-based sequencing of viral genomes that are more than 20\u201350 kb impractical with current technologies, particularly for large multi-sample studies or routine diagnostics. Another consideration is that increasing numbers of PCR reactions require a corresponding increase in sample amount, and this is not always possible as clinical specimens are limited. Improvements in microfluidic technologies may help to overcome some of these barriers; for example, Fluidigm, RainDance and other 'droplet' sequencing technologies. Microfluidics-based PCR and the pooling of multiple amplicons have been used successfully to sequence several antimicrobial-resistance loci (for example, from the microbiome of pigs)95 and can also be used for viral genomes, potentially down to the single-genome level96.",

Methods of target enrichment (also known as pull-down, capture or specific enrichment methods) can be used to sequence whole viral genomes directly from clinical samples without the need for prior culture or PCR98,99,100. These methods typically involve small RNA or DNA probes that are complementary to the pathogen reference sequence (or a panel of reference sequences). Unlike specific PCR amplicon-based methods, the reaction can be carried out in a single tube that contains overlapping probes that cover the whole genome. In a hybridization reaction, the probes, which are bound to a solid phase (for example, streptavidin-labelled magnetic beads), capture or 'pull down' complementary DNA sequences from the total nucleic acids that are present in a sample. Capture is followed by sequencer-specific adaptor ligation and a small number of PCR cycles to enrich for successfully ligated fragments. This has been used successfully to characterize small and large, clinically relevant viruses, such as HCV27, HSV-1 (Ref. 101), VZV100, EBV102, HCMV69, human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6)103 and HHV7 (Ref. 104). The reaction is carried out in a single well and, similarly to microfluidics-based PCR, is amenable to high-throughput automation102. The lack of a culture step means that the sequences that are obtained are more representative of original virus rather than cultured virus isolates, and there are fewer mutations than in PCR-amplified templates69,100. The success of this method depends on the available reference sequences for the virus of interest; specificity increases when probes are designed against a larger panel of reference sequences, as this leads to better capture of the diversity in and between samples. Target enrichment is possible despite small mismatches between template and probe; however, whereas PCR amplification requires only knowledge of flanking regions of a target region, target enrichment requires knowledge of the internal sequence to design probes. However, if one probe fails, internal and overlapping regions may still be captured by other probes69,100. Target enrichment is not suitable for the characterization of novel viruses that have low homology to known viruses for which metagenomics, and, in some cases, PCR using degenerate primers, which are a mix of similar but variable primers, may be more appropriate.",

With metagenomics, the proportion of sequencing data that map to the pathogen from unenriched clinical samples is small. Target enrichment can increase the percentage of on-target viral reads from 0.01% to 80% or more69. The improvement in quality and depth of sequence that results enables more samples to be sequenced per run than unenriched metagenomic libraries for equivalent on-target sequencing performance. This improvement also decreases the price of sequencing, although the cost of library preparation is increased.

To date, there has been very little direct comparison between the three methods for viral genome sequencing in clinical practice, with only one paper evaluating relative performance for the sequencing of HCV27. Results from this study, in which three different enrichment protocols, two metagenomic methods and one overlapping PCR method were evaluated, showed that metagenomic methods were the least sensitive, yielded the lowest genome coverage for comparable sequencing effort and were more prone to result in incomplete genome assemblies. The PCR method required repeated amplification and was the most likely to miss mixed infections, but when reactions were successful it resulted in the most consistent read depth, whereas read depth was proportional to virus copy number in metagenomics and target enrichment. PCR generated more incomplete sequences for some HCV genotypes (particularly genotype 2) than metagenomics and target enrichment. Target enrichment was the most consistent method to result in full genomes and identical consensus sequences. The ease of library preparation for metagenomic and target enrichment sequencing of HCV was considered a major advantage for clinical applications, but PCR may still be appropriate for samples that have very low viral loads.",

These incidental findings remain a topic of intense medical ethical debate108. The risk of incidental findings in pathogen sequencing (for example, the discovery of HIV infection during metagenomic sequencing for other pathogens) is not novel and the solution in clinical virology laboratories that use multiplex PCRs is to suppress results that have not been requested (J.B., unpublished observations). In the United Kingdom, the clinical virologist who interprets the test results is part of the team that manages the patient, and, as such, may decide to discuss an unexpected result with the physician in charge. Incidental host genetic findings (for example, the detection of variants that predispose to cancer development) in a pathogen metagenomic analysis are not reported to the individual in the United Kingdom, because this is only permissible with the consent of the patient. In regard to both host and virus incidental findings, target enrichment and PCR have the advantage of only providing results about the pathogen of interest.

As with other highly sensitive technologies, robust laboratory practices and protocols are required to minimize contamination. It is also important to remember that the detection of viral nucleic acid does not necessarily identify the cause of illness, and it is good practice when using NGS methods for the diagnosis of viral infections to confirm the findings with alternative independent methods that do not rely on testing for nucleic acids.

Strict version control of software and analysis pipelines is required to ensure that results are reproducible, to make best practices easily shareable, and to enable the accreditation of analysis software. However, best-practice analysis methods are continually evolving and the premature standardization of best practices in an overly rigid manner may inhibit innovation. Commercialization and regulation may help, as they provide financial and regulatory incentives to ensure that analysis tools and technologies meet clinical needs. Finally, the development of well-curated databases that show which variants are truly indicative of drug resistance will be crucial for accurate clinical interpretation.

Achieving the high coverage that is necessary to ensure accurate variant typing is challenging when there is a lot of host DNA compared with viral sequences, and when the error profile of a technology makes point mutations particularly hard to detect125. At the time of writing, MinION sequencing (R9 pore chemistry) has raw high quality (so called '2D reads') read error rates of around 5% (J. Quick, personal communication), which compares unfavourably with the error rates of other technologies (Illumina (<0.1%), Ion Torrent (\u223c1%), but not PacBio (13% single pass))132, although accuracy can been improved using circular consensus read sequencing133,134.",

Metagenomic sequencing is most appropriate for diagnostic sequencing of unknown or poorly characterized viruses, PCR amplicon sequencing works well for short viral genomes and low diversity in primer binding sites, and target enrichment works for all pathogen sizes but is particularly advantageous for large viruses and for viruses that have diverse but well-characterized genomes.
