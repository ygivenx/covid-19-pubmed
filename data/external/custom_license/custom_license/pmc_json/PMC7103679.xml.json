The disease has a wide range of clinical presentation and epidemiology [2\u20136]. Three main factors contribute to the transmission of MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV): the virus, the host, and the environment. With regard to the patterns of transmission, three patterns have been recognized: sporadic transmission, limited intrafamilial transmission, and health-care-associated transmissions. Here, we review the available data regarding the diversity of transmission and summarize known risk factors for such transmission.",

The most common presentations among hospitalized MERS patients were fever, cough, shortness of breath, and clinical and radiological evidence of pneumonia [7\u201310]. Patients may also present with nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, myalgia, fever, cough, headache, vomiting, and diarrhea [7\u201310]. Patients with severe disease develop respiratory failure secondary to acute lung injury, and may develop renal failure and coagulopathy [11\u201315]. The case fatality rate is related to the viral load, severity of the disease, and the presence of comorbidities [11\u201315]. In a recent study, multivariate analysis revealed predictors of mortality as: age >60 years (odds ratio [OR] 11.7), underlying illness (OR 5.19), lower Ct values where the odds of death increased 17% for each 1 point drop in Ct (OR 1.17) [16]. The risk of death in patients with MERS was significantly associated with age >65 years (9.3 times that of younger patients) and treatment for underlying diseases (7.8 times that of other patients) [17]. The majority (>95%) of the cases of MERS infection occur in adults and older adults with one or more comorbidities, and few cases occurred among children [18,19]. Comorbidities associated with MERS-CoV infection include: diabetes mellitus, renal failure, and hypertension, as shown in Table 1 [7,9,12,13,20].\n\n",

Currently, the detection of MERS-CoV in respiratory samples is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of MERS in a clinical setting. Lower or deeper respiratory samples were more likely to be positive for MERS-CoV than upper respiratory samples and thus these samples are the preferred method of testing using real-time PCR [16,21]. Viral loads in lower respiratory samples were at least 100 times more compared to upper respiratory tract samples (5 \u00d7 106 vs. 1.9 \u00d7 104 cop/mL, respectively) [22]. Serology using immunofluorescence, serum neutralization, or protein microarray assays adds additional diagnostic methods for the detection of MERS-CoV antibodies, but most of these tests require a minimum of 3 weeks postinfection to reveal positive results [21,23\u201326].",

These antibody detection tests (PRNT, MN, ppNT, and ELISA test) have an excellent sensitivity of 94\u2013100% [27]. The ppNT does not require biosafety level (BSL)-3 containment [27\u201330]. In one study, serum dilutions causing plaque reductions of 90% (PRNT90) and 50% (PRNT50) showed that the use of PRNT50 detects few infections that were not detected by PRNT90 tests [25].

The source of the infection in the remaining 4% was not reported [39]. The dynamics of the transmission of MERS-CoV possibly involves small animals, such as bats, and dromedary camels of Africa, with the importation of camels into the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia resulting in subsequent zoonotic transmission. These sporadic cases then lead to intrafamilial transmission and outbreaks in the health-care settings (Figure 1).",

The evidence for dromedary camels as a potential source of infections relies on four different lines of evidence. These lines of evidence are: the high seroprevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies in dromedary camels, shepherds and abattoir, [42\u201345] as well as similarity in the genome sequences of MERS-CoV from dromedary and human specimens, [40,44\u201347] the isolation of MERS-CoV from camels, [48\u201350] and serological evidence that animal infection preceded the human infection in the Jeddah case [41,51]. The exact mode of transmission of MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans remains to be elucidated. In a recent case-control study, 30 primary cases were matched to 116 controls [52]. The answers of the questions for the primary cases were provided by family members in 57% of instances compared to 1% in the control group [52]. In a univariate analysis, the following risks were significant: direct physical contact with a dromedary camel during the last 6 months, household members frequently visited farms with dromedaries, household members had direct contact with dromedaries during the exposure period, dromedaries were present on farm, milked dromedaries while on farm, household members visited a farm with dromedaries during the exposure period, and any direct contact with a dromedary camel during the exposure period [52]. In a multivariate analysis, risks were associated with direct dromedary exposure in the preceding two weeks, diabetes mellitus, heart disease, and current tobacco smoking [52]. In June 2012, the investigation of the source of MERS-CoV around the house of the first patient in Bisha showed that a sample from a Taphozous perforatus bat (Egyptian tomb bat) had 100% identity to the human MERS-CoV cloned from the index case-patient [53]. There are no studies of bats in Saudi Arabia to further confirm this finding.",

In Al-Hasa, Saudi Arabia, 23 confirmed cases and 11 probable cases constituted the outbreak [13]. Further genotyping studies revealed multiple introduction of MERS-CoV into the hospital outbreak [74].

Of all the cases in that outbreak, 60% of the cases resulted from health-care-associated transmission [75]. Factors contributing to the transmissions and increased number of cases included: sensitive case definition, active search for cases, and contact tracing [57]. In 2015, a large MERS outbreak occurred in the Republic of Korea [76]. The outbreak was epidemiologically linked to a single patient who visited multiple countries in the Arabian Peninsula [76].

These factors include: late recognition, overcrowding, inadequate infection control precautions, prolonged viral shedding, and the occurrence of superspreading events [32]. The exact definition of a superspreader is not well defined. In one study of SARS, a \u2018superspreading event\u2019 was defined as transmission of SARS to at least eight contacts, [82] and others used the term to refer to individuals infecting unusually large numbers of secondary cases [83,84]. A superspreading event was recognized during the SARS outbreak when a flight attendant infected more than 100 patients in Singapore [85\u201387]. In the Al-Hasa outbreak, a single patient caused seven secondary cases; [13] thus, a superspreading event may have contributed to the outbreak. The index case in the Republic of Korea caused 27 secondary cases; one of these cases caused 24 tertiary cases while another patient caused 73 tertiary cases [80]. In the Republic of Korea outbreak, superspreaders contributed to the infection of 85, 28, 23, 11, and 6 from patients\u2019 number 14, 1, 16, 76 and 15, respectively [20]. Another secondary patient resulted in 91 tertiary MERS cases, of which 39% were other patients in the emergency room, and 13% were health-care workers [88].

In particular, the transmission within health-care settings is of major concern due to the potential to cause large outbreaks even outside the Arabian Peninsula. This is exemplified by the large outbreak in the Republic of Korea. Transmissions of MERS-CoV within health-care settings are facilitated by overcrowding, poor compliance with basic infection control measures, unrecognized infections, the superspreader phenomenon, and poor triage systems. The actual contributing factors to the spread of MERS-CoV are yet to be systematically studied, but data to date suggest that viral, host, and environmental factors play a major role. Understanding these factors and the contribution of each factor to the superspreading events would further enhance the control measures of MERS-CoV transmission. The epidemiology of the disease was studied in many aspects and showed propensity for the older and those with underlying medical conditions. There is yet an unexplained low rate of involvement of children. The clinical picture of MERS had been further elucidated to include asymptomatic infections, mild or moderately symptomatic cases, and fatal disease. This heterogeneity in the clinical presentation is similar to other known infectious diseases and might be related to the immune response. MERS-CoV is present in the lower respiratory tract system for a prolonged period of time and at higher concentrations than those of the upper respiratory tract, the urine, and the stool. This finding puts the MERS-CoV dynamics in the same clinical presentation as SARS. The finding also has an important role for the prospect of control in health-care settings.",
