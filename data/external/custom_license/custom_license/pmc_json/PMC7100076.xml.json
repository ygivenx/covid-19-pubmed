From there it spread rapidly to the rest of the world during the early months of 2003.[1] As of July 2003, the total number of people infected with SARS worldwide was 8437 with a mortality rate of 9.6%.[2] The vast majority of cases have been from Asia.[2] The SARS-CoV is evident in a number of animals and appears to have undergone interspecies transmission to infect humans.[1]",
