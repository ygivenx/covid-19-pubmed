            "text": "Supplemental oxygen, which is frequently used in the treatment of pulmonary insufficiency in premature infants, has been implicated in the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). BPD remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality during the first year of life, and some of these infants have significant respiratory problems throughout childhood, including increased airway reactivity and the development of restrictive airway disease (1). Hyperoxia induces lung injury and may contribute to BPD. A comprehensive review of the literature reveals a strong association between exposure to hyperoxia and subsequent expression of comorbidities. Hyperoxia can directly cause lung injury by generation of reactive oxygen radicals. Prolonged exposure of neonatal mice to hyperoxia results in impaired alveolarization and capillary development and in increased lung fibrosis that is similar to human BPD (2).",

In studies of tissue fibrogenesis, the tissue RAS is believed to play a key role in initiation and progression of fibrous tissue accumulation in a variety of organs. Both ACE inhibitors and Angiotensin receptor antagonists have been shown to prevent fibrogenesis of the heart (4), liver (5), kidney (6), and lungs (7,8). ANG II, produced by ACE, is the main effector molecule in the RAS. ANG II is a potential pulmonary profibrotic mediator which activates ANG II type I receptor and stimulates collagen synthesis. Studies done in vivo showed that the angiotensin system was upregulated in oxygen-exposed fetal lung fibroblasts (9). The main function of ACE-2 is to convert the octapeptide angiotensin II to a heptapeptide ANG 1\u20137. This limits the accumulation of ANG II and protects against experimental lung fibrosis.",

Previous work from this laboratory demonstrated that ACE-2 protects against fibrosis, but is downregulated in both human and experimental lung fibrosis models (11), and that inhibition of ACE-2 is associated with increased lung tissue injury/fibrosis. Earlier, Uhal et al (3). demonstrated the existence of an angiotensin/TGF-\u03b21 \u201cautocrine loop\u201d in human lung myofibroblasts. More important in the context of the neonatal lung, Jiang et al (12). showed the activation of the angiotensin system in hyperoxia-induced lung fibrosis in neonatal rats. Chou et al (13). showed that blocking ANG II activity through the AT1R (angiotensin type I receptor) blocker losartan prevented lung fibrosis in response to hyperoxia.

These authors also showed that TACE-dependent \u201cshedding\u201d of ACE-2 ectodomain is completely dependent on the binding of SARS-S protein to ACE-2 and that TACE was required for viral entry (16). Further, the shedding was blocked by TACE antagonists, TAPI-0, and TAPI-2 (15). TACE (also known as ADAM17), originally identified as a metalloprotease required for processing the membrane form of TNF-\u03b1 and its release as a soluble factor (17), is now known to be involved in the cleavage and release of the ACE-2 ectodomain in several tissues (18).",

In support of this theory, a pharmaceutical preparation of recombinant human ACE-2 (rhACE-2) is currently in clinical trials for acute lung injury (GlaxoSmithKline, pipeline drug GSK2586881). ACE-2, a carboxypeptidase which degrades Angiotensin II, was shown to be protective but downregulated in human interstitial pulmonary fibrosis and in experimentally-induced lung fibrosis by Li et al (11).. A clear role for ACE-2 in modulating acute lung injury was shown by the demonstrations of Imai et al (10). who showed that the absence of ACE-2 in ACE-2 knockout mice exacerbates experimental acute lung injury. To date, the potential role of ACE-2 in hyperoxic lung injury has not been explored.",

More recently, the milder form termed \u201cnew BPD\u201d has been described, characterized by abnormalities in alveolar septation, pulmonary edema, and less overt fibrosis (19,20). In adult animal models of acute lung injury (10,21), ACE-2 was shown to inhibit lung edema formation and inflammation as well as fibrogenesis. Thus, although little is known about the role of ACE-2 in alveolar septation, ACE-2 might be expected to protect against the \u201cnew BPD\u201d as well as the more fibrotic \u201cold\u201d form. Regardless, a small percentage of children with BPD today present with classic findings of the \u201cold BPD\u201d, and it may be that a continuum exists between the milder forms and the more severe presentations. Therefore, the study of ACE-2 and other components of the RAS in hyperoxic lung injury and the possibility of ameliorating the most severe, and possibly the milder, forms of BPD associated with hyperoxic injury remains critical.",

To our knowledge, the present study is the first to demonstrate that ACE-2 is expressed by human lung fibroblasts and is downregulated by hyperoxia. It is also the first to document that this downregulation could be prevented by TACE antagonist in hyperoxia-treated cells. Given the known function of ACE-2 in preventing lung collagen deposition in experimental lung fibrosis (11), its expression by the fibroblastic cells most responsible for collagen synthesis is not surprising. Indeed, other authors have shown that lung collagen accumulation in neonatal rats exposed to hyperoxic gas could be prevented by blockers of angiotensin receptor AT1 (25).",

Although the 95% oxygen did cause a very minor increase in necrotic cells (<1% see Table 1), it seems unlikely that this small but statistically significant effect would have physiologic significance. The hyperoxic gas did, however, cause a significant decrease in ACE-2 (Figure 2); whether or not subphysiologic oxygen concentrations reduce ACE-2 will be an interesting topic for further research. In the light of all published evidence, the downregulation of ACE-2 would be expected to lead to accumulation of ANG II and its downstream profibrotic pathways (see Figure 7). Indeed, hyperoxic gas was previously shown to increase ANGII-mediated collagen synthesis by human lung fibroblasts (9), and either inhibition or gene knockdown of ACE-2 increased autocrine ANGII generation by human lung cells in culture (11). Furthermore, the heptapeptide ANG1-7, the product of ACE-2, was shown to be antifibrotic in lung tissue (21,27) and inhibition of ACE-2 reduces its production (see Figure 7). Accordingly, the reduction of cellular ACE-2 induced by hyperoxia would be expected to promote fibrogenesis through both increasing ANGII and simultaneously decreasing ANG1-7.",

This sequence of redox poise variation is reminiscent of ischemia\u2013reperfusion injury, in which many key signaling pathways are induced not during the ischemic period, but during the return to normoxia (28). Although unknown at present, the mechanisms induced by hyperoxic/normoxic cycling may be speculated to involve mitochondrial or other redox sensing mechanisms known to be influenced by reactive oxygen or nitrogen species (29). The elucidation of these pathways will also be a very interesting topic for future inquiry.",

ACE-2 protein and enzyme activity, but not mRNA, were decreased by hyperoxia in cultured fetal lung fibroblasts, but ACE-2 protein was increased in the cell culture supernatants. Inhibition of these effects by TAPI-2 suggests a mechanism mediated by ADAM-17/TACE-induced shedding of ACE-2 from the cell surface. Since it is known that lung injury and fibrosis can be abrogated by ACE-2, the demonstration of a direct effect of hyperoxia on ACE-2 in human lung cells has significant implications for the pathogenesis of hyperoxic lung injury, fibrogenesis and viral infection of the lungs.",

Angiotensinogen (AGT) produced by either alveolar epithelial cells or myofibroblasts (3) can be cleaved by a variety of pulmonary aspartyl proteases (3) to yield angiotensin (ANG) I, which in turn is cleaved by various lung enzymes to yield the profibrotic ANGII. ANGII is degraded by ACE-2 to yield the antifibrotic peptide ANG1-7, which acts through its receptor mas. Hyperoxia causes, by mechanisms yet unknown, the release of ACE-2 from the cell through ectodomain cleavage mediated by increased ADAM-17/TACE. Through this mechanism, hyperoxia is theorized to promote fibrosis through both (a) promoting accumulation of ANGII (8,9) and (b) reducing production of the antifibrotic peptide ANG1-7 (21). See text for Discussion. Processes depicted here as intracellular (dark shaded areas) or extracellular (light shading) may well occur in either or both compartments. \nPowerPoint slide\n",
