            "text": "Zika virus (ZIKV) belongs to family Flaviviridae. Dengue, West Nile, yellow fever, and Japanese encephalitis viruses transmitted to humans by mosquitoes in genus Aedes all belong to family Flaviviridae. ZIKV was first isolated from a sentinel monkey in 1947 (Faye et al. 2014). It is responsible for an unprecedented epidemic currently occurring in Brazil and America (Campos et al. 2015). Before this outbreak, ZIKV was not viewed as an important pathogen because the majority of its infections are asymptomatic (Duffy et al. 2009). However, there is now growing evidence showing that ZIKV infections might be linked to fetal and newborn microcephaly (ECDC 2016; WHO 2016) with serious neurological complications such as Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) (Petersen et al. 2016). Moreover, ZIKV intersects with the placenta and causes microcephaly by targeting cortical progenitor cells, inducing cell death caused by apoptosis and autophagy and impairing neurodevelopment (Cugola et al. 2016; Li et al. 2016). The increases of Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome and microcephaly associated with ZIKA infection have led the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare ZIKV infection as a global public health emergency in February of 2016 (ECDC 2016; WHO 2016). To date, no vaccine or therapeutic has been clinically approved for preventing or controlling ZIKV infection.",

It is initially translated as a single polyprotein (Kuno and Chang 2007) and then post-translationally cleaved into three structural proteins: capsid (C), premembrane/membrane (prM), and envelope (E) as well as nonstructural (NS) proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) (Baronti et al. 2014). NS3 protein of ZIKV possesses putative protease activity at its N-terminus and putative ATPase/helicase, nucleoside triphosphatase, and 5\u2032-triphosphatase activities at its C-terminus (Zhu et al. 2016). The polyprotein is cleaved co-translationally and post-translationally by cellular proteases of furin-type or Golgi-localized proteases. The viral serine protease is embedded in the N-terminal domain of NS3 (NS3pro) (Bollati et al. 2010). Since NS3 is essential to life cycle of ZIKV, it is an attractive target for the development of antiviral drugs (Lei et al. 2016).",

Polyphenols possess antiviral activities against influenza virus (A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B virus) (Liu et al. 2008), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Nguyen et al. 2012), and dengue fever virus (Zandi et al. 2011). However, there has been no report on the inhibitory activity or structure\u2013activity relationship of polyphenols against NS2B-NS3pro of ZIKV. Therefore, we expressed NS2B-NS3pro from ZIKV in Escherichia coli and studied the inhibitory activities of 22 polyphenol compounds belonging to four groups of flavonols, flavanols, flavones, and flavanones against ZIKV NS2B-NS3pro and their structure\u2013activity relationship.",

It was inserted into pET28a vector (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) (pET28a-NS2B-NS3pro) for the expression of NS2B-NS3pro enzyme with poly-histidine tags in both N-terminal and C-terminal ends. The protein encoding NS2B-NS3pro comprised of 49 NS2B amino acid residues (amino acid residues 1421\u20131469) were linked by a flexible GGGGSGGGG linker with 186 NS3pro amino acid residues (amino acid residues 1503\u20131688) (Supplementary Fig. 1). pET28a-NS2B-NS3pro was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) which was then grown in LB supplemented with kanamycin (50 \u03bcg ml\u22121) at 37 \u00b0C. Cells were induced with 0.5 mM IPTG when the OD600 reached 0.5. Induced cells were kept at 16 \u00b0C for 12 h at 200 rpm. Cells were collected by centrifugation (8000\u00d7g for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C), resuspended in 50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.0), and lysed via sonication. After centrifugation (12,000\u00d7g for 30 min), the cell lysate was loaded onto 8 ml Ni-agarose resin. Proteins were eluted from the column with elution buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl, 30 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole, pH 8). Fractions containing pure protein were pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed against 50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7). The concentration of protein was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Purified protein was confirmed by 12% SDS-PAGE.",

            "text": "Similar to other flavivirus proteases such as those of dengue virus (DENV) and West Nile virus (WNV), the mature form of ZIKV protease consists of the N-terminal domain of NS3 which carries the catalytic triad Ser135-His51-Asp75. It requires the central hydrophilic domain of NS2B as a co-factor for enzymatic activity (Falgout et al. 1991; Lei et al. 2016). Its cleavage sites have common Lys-Arg, Arg-Arg, Arg-Lys, or Gln-Arg motifs (Bessaud et al. 2006; Lei et al. 2016). ZIKV NS2B-NS3pro was designed to compose 49 NS2B amino acid residues (amino acid residues 1421\u20131469) linked by a flexible GGGGSGGGG linker with 186 NS3pro amino acid residues (amino acid residues 1503\u20131688) (Supplementary Fig. 1). It was cloned and expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3). The purification of recombinant ZIKV NS2B-NS3pro was achieved in a single Ni-agarose chromatography with 21-fold purification. SDS-PAGE analyses revealed a protein band of approximately 35 kDa (Fig. 1a) with over 80% in purity.\n",

Polyphenols fisetin, quercetin, anringin, and rutin can inhibit dengue virus, a member of the family Flaviviridae that also contains ZIKV (Zandi et al. 2011). Therefore, in this study, 18 flavonid compounds belonging to four groups of flavonoids (flavonol, 6 compounds; flavanol, 8 compounds; flavone, 2 compounds; flavanone, 2 compounds) and four non-flavonoid type phenolic compounds (pyrogallol, pyrocatechol, caffeic acid, and gallic acid) were selected to test their inhibitory activities against ZIKV NS2B-NS3pro. The structures of these compounds are shown in Fig. 2. Results on the inhibitory activities of these polyphenol compounds at 100 \u00b5M against NS2B-NS3pro are shown in Table 1. Among these tested compounds, myricetin, astragalin, rutin, epigallocatechin gallate, epicatechin gallate, gallocatechin gallate, and luteolin at 100 \u00b5M inhibited more than 40% of the activities of ZIKV NS2B-NS3pro. Therefore, they were selected for the determination of IC50 values. Results are shown in Table 1. The IC50 of myricetin, astragalin, rutin, EGCG, epicatechin gallate (ECG), gallocatechin gallate (GCG), and luteolin were 22 \u00b1 0.2, 112 \u00b1 5.5, 105 \u00b1 2.9, 87 \u00b1 1.2, 89 \u00b1 1.6, 99 \u00b1 1.8, and 53 \u00b1 1.3 \u00b5M, respectively (Table 1).\n\n",

The order of inhibitory activities of the flavonol class of compounds at 100 \u00b5M was: myricetin < rutin < astragalin < quercetin < ampelopsin < icaritin. Icaritin had lower inhibitory activity compared to other compounds in this class. The methoxy group at C4\u2032 in the B-ring and the prenyl group at C8 position in the A-ring of icaritin might have contributed to its lower inhibitory activity against ZIKV NS2B-NS3pro. Myricetin contains three OH groups on its B-ring. Ampelopsin has the same three OH groups at its B-ring but lacks the double bond between the C2 and C3 positions in its B-ring. The absence of the double bond in ampelopsin might have decreased its inhibitory activity against ZIKV NS2B-NS3pro. This may be the primarily reason why ampelopsin had lower inhibitory activity than myricetin. Quercetin had lower inhibitory activity compared to myricetin, luteolin, and astragalin. Rutin having glycosylation at C3 position in the C-ring but no OH group at C3\u2032 in the B-ring had higher inhibitory activity than quercetin, although their inhibitory activities were lower than those of myricetin and luteolin.",
