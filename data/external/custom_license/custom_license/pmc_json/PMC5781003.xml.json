Prior antibiotic therapy is of great influence on the growth of S. pneumoniae in sputum samples and blood cultures. Several studies found that during antibiotic treatment sputum samples became rapidly negative for S. pneumoniae in contrast to the S. pneumoniae PCR that remained positive. In our study, S. pneumoniae was detected in all culture\u2010positive sputum samples and in many culture\u2010negative sputum samples by PCR, presumably reflecting the increased sensitivity of molecular technique above traditional culture methods. Of the 60 patients with S. pneumoniae as causative organism, the pneumococcal antigen assay was positive in 62%. The results of the pneumococcal antigen assay showed a lower sensitivity compared with data reported by others.\n42\n The reason for this difference in sensitivity is unclear but could be explained by the influence of prior antibiotic therapy, not concentrating the urine before executing the assay, and the fact that the pneumococcal antigen assay is more sensitive in patients who are bacteraemic than in patients without a bacteraemia.",
