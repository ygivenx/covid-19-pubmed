The HCV structural protein includes two envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2; these glycoproteins form a heterodimer and mediate viral binding and entry into host cells [4, 5]. To infect a cell, HCV must first attach itself to the cell surface by interaction with specific cell surface receptors, and consequently induce conformational changes in the glycoproteins E1 and E2 and fusion of the viral and cellular membranes [2, 4, 5].",

Since liver is the major target organ of HCV infection, the expression pattern of HCV receptors has been suggested to be liver specific or dominant within the liver. In addition to cause an infection, HCV can use multiple attachment factors and receptors in parallel or in succession [4]. Dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN; also termed CD209) and DC-SIGN related (DC-SIGNR; also known as L-SIGN and CD209L) are two members of the C-type lectin family; these bind to viral glycoproteins such as E2 in HCV [9\u201312].",

LSECtin shares 32% and 31% amino acid sequence identities with DC-SIGNR and DC-SIGN, respectively, and has been shown to bind in vitro with mannose, GlcNAc, and fucose. Interestingly, LSECtin can be colocalized with DC-SIGNR on the LSECs [13]. Recent studies showed that LSECtin could bind to Ebola virus surface glycoprotein, filovirus glycoproteins, and the spike protein of SARS coronavirus [14\u201316]. In addition, LSECtin was also demonstrated to be expressed in human peripheral blood and thymic dendritic cells isolated ex vivo. LSECtin expression confers Ebola virus-binding capacity to leukemic cells, participates in antigen uptake and internalization, and therefore it functions as a pathogen receptor [17]. However, the potential role of LSECtin in HCV binding to LSECs was not fully understood.",

This knowledge prompted us to investigate whether LSECtin could interact with DC-SIGNR or CD81. First we detected the physical interactions of LSECtin with DC-SIGNR using co-immunoprecipitation assay (Co-IP) in the HEK293T cells co-transfected with LSECtin and DC-SIGNR expressing plasmids. As shown in Fig. 1a, ectopic expressed LSECtin could be coimmunoprecipitated with Myc-tagged DC-SIGNR in HEK293T cells. The reciprocal Co-IP assays also indicated that DC-SIGNR could be coimmunoprecipitated with LSECtin (Fig. 1b). Then the soluble LSECtin adhesion assay was performed to confirm the interaction. The soluble LSECtin protein consisting of only the central ectodomain (aa 55\u2013162) was incubated with the HEK293T cells transfected with DC-SIGNR or with vector-mock cells. Their associations were assessed by FACS assays with anti-LSECtin antibody. About a half of the DC-SIGNR-HEK293T cells were bound to the soluble Fc-LSECtin but not control-Fc protein, whereas only 6% of the mock cells were adhered to LSECtin (Fig. 1c). Since soluble LSECtin contains only the ectodomain, this result implicated that the ectodomain of LSECtin was sufficient for its interaction with DC-SIGNR.",

To further investigate whether the ectodomain of LSECtin was required for and whether other regions were involved in the interaction with DC-SIGNR, a series of LSECtin truncates or point mutants were constructed and used in the Co-IP assays. The expressions of these mutants in cells were adjusted to a comparable level and the lysates in same amount were used as input for immunoprecipitation. The 5% inputs and IP products were run on SDS-PAGE gel and detected by western blotting. As shown in Fig. 1d, deletion of the coiled-coil region within the ectodomain (indicated by D2) completely abolished the interaction of LSECtin with DC-SIGNR. In contrast, deletion of the potential endocytic motif (indicated by D1) or mutation of each N-linked glycosylation sites N73, N159 to Ala (M1, M2) had no significant effect on the interaction, and the deficiency of CRD/CTLD domain (D3) also had modest effect on the interaction which might be caused by conformation changes. Compared with the binding affinity of wild-type LSECtin to DC-SIGNR (indicated as onefold), the affinities of various LSECtin mutants to DC-SIGNR were D1, 1.2; D2, 0; M1, 0.8; M2, 1.5; D3, 0.8, respectively. These results clearly showed that the central ectodomain is critical for the LSECtin-DC-SIGNR interaction.",

The binding of Myc-tagged E2 to the HEK293T-LSECtin cells was also inhibited by the soluble His-tagged LSECtin protein (Fig. 3d). Previous studies have shown that EGTA, chelators of calcium ion, and mannan could block the binding of the virus to DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR [9\u201312]. LSECtin can bind to carbohydrates such as mannose, GlcNAc, and fucose [13]; this prompted us to investigate whether the interaction between the E2 glycoprotein and LSECtin was influenced by these agents. The binding of E2 with NIH3T3-LSECtin stable transfectants was efficiently inhibited by EGTA and less efficiently by mannan (Fig. 3e); the latter was a little different from that in the case of DC-SIGNR.

So we speculated whether LSECtin could capture viruses and had any effects on HCV infection in a manner similar to that of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR. NIH3T3 transfectants and Hep3B hepatocellular carcinoma cells (positive control) were infected with the HCV pseudotype particles and the luciferase activities were measured 48 h post-infection.

Moreover, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) serve as an active barrier between circulating blood and hepatocytes. During HCV infection in the liver, LSECs capture the circulating HCV particles, transmit the captured particles to the endothelial cells, and present them to the entry-permissive hepatocytes. The adherence of CD81-expressing cells to soluble LSECtin also implicated a potential interaction between CD81 on hepatocytes and LSECtin on LSECs, which may be involved in the transmission of the HCV virions to hepatocytes. This possibility should be further investigated in the future.",

L-SIGN showed high affinity to high mannose oligosaccharides, but LSECtin bound with high selectivity to glycoproteins terminating in GlcNAc\u03b21-2Man. We noted that mannan, a mannose polymer obtained from yeast cell wall, could not significantly block the binding of the E2 glycoprotein and HCV pseudotype particles with LSECtin (Fig. 3e, 4a and c), while mannan could compete for binding to L-SIGN. These results suggested that the presence of various types of incompletely matured glycans may facilitate the interaction of enveloped viruses with multiple cell surface receptors. In addition, we observed similar affinities of LSECtin and DC-SIGNR to HCV-E2 in binding assays with soluble E2 proteins (Fig. 3e) but different affinities in the assays with pseudotype particles (Fig. 4a). This might be caused by different conformations of E2 proteins in different contexts or different length of ectodomains of LSECtin and DC-SIGNR. In this aspect, ectodomain length of type 2 C-lectins has been demonstrated critical for pathogen recognition [10, 11, 17], and LSECtin ectodomain is shorter than DC-SIGNR ectodomain [13, 16].",

This inconsistency may be from the different affinity of LSECtin to the variants of E2 protein from different HCV isolates. HCV can be classified into six major genotypes and further subdivided into at least 70 subtypes, which exhibit different phenotypic properties. It was reported that a soluble form of E2 protein had a significant genotype-specific difference in CD81 binding assay. In our present study, HCV E1E2 glycoprotein constructs were amplified using the infectious molecular clone H77 as the template. Another possibility is the different sensitivity in detecting the p24 antigen recovery with the different titer of HCV pseudotype particles because the affinity of LSECtin with HCV pseudotype particles was only half of DC-SIGNR.",
