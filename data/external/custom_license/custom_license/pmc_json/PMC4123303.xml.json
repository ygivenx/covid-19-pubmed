Among patients with lung adenocarcinoma, those with TTF-1-positive cancer exhibit better prognosis than those with TTF1-negative cancer4,5,6. Using a transgenic lung cancer mouse model, deletion of TTF-1 has been shown to promote invasion and metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma, in part due to the role of TTF-1 in HMGA2 expression7. TTF-1 was also shown to reduce cell motility and metastasis through induction of MYBPH expression8. These findings strongly suggest that TTF-1 functions as a tumor suppressor in lung adenocarcinoma. In contrast, genomics analyses revealed that human TTF1/NKX2-1 gene was amplified in 10%-15% of lung adenocarcinomas; it is therefore called a lineage-survival oncogene9,10,11,12. TTF-1 has been shown to exhibit a pro-survival effect by inducing ROR1 expression, which enhances AKT signaling through the EGF-ErbB3-PI3 kinase axis13. It has also recently been reported that amplified TTF-1 and FOXA1 cooperatively regulate expression of the LMO3 oncogene, which mediates cell survival downstream of TTF-114. Although the precise mechanism(s) of favorable prognosis brought by TTF-1 remains unknown, it is possible that TTF-1 interacts with other transcription factors and alters their signaling activities.",

TGF-\u03b2 binds to type II and type I receptors, resulting in phosphorylation of the receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads): Smad2 and Smad3. R-Smads form hetero-oligomeric complexes with Smad4, and translocate into the nucleus15,16, where they regulate the transcription of target genes through interaction with other transcription factors. Smad3 and Smad4 bind directly to chromatin through their N-terminal MH1 domains; Smad2 does not bind directly to chromatin because of an insert sequence that is present in its MH1 domain17,18. Several groups have reported genome-wide analyses of the binding patterns of TGF-\u03b2 receptor-regulated Smads in various cancer cell lines and embryonic stem cell-derived cells19,20,21,22,23,24,25. These results reveal varied Smad-binding profiles in different cell types, indicating that \u201ccell-specific context\u201d is important for the response to TGF-\u03b2 signaling.",

We previously reported that TTF-1 inhibits TGF-\u03b2-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in lung adenocarcinoma cells28. Conversely, TGF-\u03b2 decreased endogenous expression of TTF-128. Thus, functional links between TTF-1 and TGF-\u03b2 signaling appear to be important for the progression of lung adenocarcinoma. Genome-wide analyses of TTF-1 binding have recently been reported14,29; however, how TTF-1 regulates TGF-\u03b2-Smad signaling remains to be elucidated. Here, we identified and compared Smad3-, Smad4- and TTF-1-binding sites in the H441 lung adenocarcinoma cell line to understand the mechanism by which TTF-1 inhibits TGF-\u03b2 signaling. Our data suggest that TTF-1 regulates TGF-\u03b2-Smad signaling by competing with Smad4, and that Smad3 acts together with TTF-1 to regulate expression of certain genes, e.g., LMO3, in a Smad4-independent manner. TTF-1 may therefore contribute to context-dependent regulation of TGF-\u03b2 and Smad3 signaling in lung epithelial cells and lung adenocarcinoma cells.",

Co-immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that TTF-1 bound to Smad3 with or without TGF-\u03b2 stimulation, and formation of the Smad3 and Smad4 (Smad3-Smad4) complex induced by TGF-\u03b2 was strongly inhibited by TTF-1 overexpression (Figure 1A).

Exogenous expression of TTF-1 strongly inhibited the binding of Smad3 to the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1, also known as SERPINE1) and SMAD7 promoters (Figure 1E). Next, we examined the effects of TTF-1 on TGF-\u03b2-induced transcription using a luciferase reporter containing the PAI-1 promoter (PAI-1-luc) and a reporter containing tandemly repeated Smad-binding elements (SBEs; 9\u00d7 CAGA-luc). TTF-1 overexpression inhibited the promoter activity of PAI-1-luc induced by TGF-\u03b2, but did not affect that of 9\u00d7 CAGA-luc (Figure 1F). However, treatment with the TGF-\u03b2 type I receptor inhibitor SB431542 effectively reduced TGF-\u03b2-induced activation of both reporters (Figure 1F). These findings suggest that certain cis-regulatory element(s) other than the canonical SBE might be required for TTF-1 to inhibit Smad-induced transcription.",

We then calculated the siControl/siTTF-1 ratio of the read counts at each binding peak. If this ratio is high, then TTF-1 does not tend to inhibit Smad3 binding in the respective region. If the ratio is low, the binding strength of Smad3 in the respective region is likely to be attenuated by the presence of TTF-1. We arranged the Smad3-binding peaks with respect to these ratios, chose the top 2 000 and bottom 2 011 peaks and examined whether there were any TTF-1-binding region(s) within 200 bps of the peak summit. Interestingly, more than 80% of the top 2 000 binding peaks have TTF-1-binding regions within 200 bps of their binding summits, while TTF-1 binds to only 8% of the bottom 2 011 peaks (Figure 2C). Therefore, Smad3 colocalizes with TTF-1 on chromatin in the presence of TTF-1, and the inhibitory effect of TTF-1 on Smad3 does not appear to be induced by competition in chromatin binding.",

We performed sequential anti-Smad3 and anti-Smad4 ChIP-qPCR at the peak e in Figure 2D. We found that Smad3 and Smad4 were colocalized at this peak, and that the binding strength was increased when TTF-1 was knocked down (Figure 2E). Next, we used scatter plotting to compare the changes in read counts of Smad3-TTF-1 common regions (Figure 2F, upper panel) or Smad3-only regions (Figure 2F, lower panel) between siControl- and siTTF-1-transfected cells. The read counts in most of the Smad3-TTF-1 common regions did not increase more than two-fold in H441 cells with siTTF-1 compared with cells with siControl, while the read counts in the Smad3-only regions increased more than two-fold in the siTTF-1-treated cells.

These Smad3-binding peaks were common to TTF-1 binding, and were therefore termed Smad3-TTF-1-requiring loci (STRL). We identified the genes nearest to these loci, and compared their expression in the presence and absence of TGF-\u03b2. Genes located near the STRL, whose expression levels were reduced by more than half after 24 h of TGF-\u03b2 stimulation, are shown in Supplementary information, Table S8, including LMO3, which exhibits pro-survival effects in adenocarcinoma cells14. To determine whether Smad3 binding to the STRL is regulated by TGF-\u03b2 signaling, we performed ChIP-qPCR analysis at these loci in the presence of TGF-\u03b2 or the TGF-\u03b2 type I receptor inhibitor SB431542. Surprisingly, Smad3 bound strongly to these loci in the presence of SB431542, and TGF-\u03b2 treatment reduced the respective binding strengths of Smad3 to these loci (Figure 4A, left). Moreover, knockdown of Smad4 did not attenuate Smad3 binding to these loci (Figure 4A, right), suggesting that Smad3 binds to these loci independently of Smad4. We confirmed colocalization of Smad3 and TTF-1 at the LMO3 region by sequential ChIP using TTF-1 and Smad3 antibodies (Supplementary information, Figure S5). We also found that Smad2 colocalized with TTF-1 at this region, possibly through interaction of Smad2 with Smad3. We examined whether Smad3 or Smad4 affects mRNA expression of these genes, and found that knockdown of either Smad3 or Smad4 cancelled the effects of TGF-\u03b2 (Figure 4B). By knocking down Smad3, the basal expression level of LMO3 was increased, whereas those of SDPR and FBP1 were reduced, suggesting that Smad3 could act as both a repressor and an activator of genes close to the STRL. Expression levels of those genes in A549 cells (which lack endogenous TTF-1 expression) were comparable to those in H441 cells (which express TTF-1) treated with TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h, suggesting that binding of TTF-1-Smad3 complex to these target regions is important for regulating the expression of these genes in H441 cells.",

On the other hand, TTF-1 inhibits TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT28, and thus functions as a tumor suppressor gene. TTF-1 may thus have two different effects that are opposite to the effects induced by TGF-\u03b2 signaling: pro-survival and anti-EMT functions.

Thus, the balance between TTF-1 expression and TGF-\u03b2 signaling may be very important for differentiation of lung epithelial cells and progression of lung adenocarcinoma. TTF-1 inhibits parts of TGF-\u03b2 signaling, and TGF-\u03b2 conversely inhibits the function of TTF-1. Interaction of Smad3 with TTF-1 did not alter the binding profiles of TTF-1 to chromatin (Supplementary information, Figure S6A and S6B). Of note, TGF-\u03b2 reduced the expression of TTF-1 mRNA only at later time points (Supplementary information, Figure S4A), while TTF-1 binding to chromatin was rapidly inhibited by TGF-\u03b2, suggesting that some other mechanisms are important in regulation of the function of TTF-1 by TGF-\u03b2 signaling.",

Furthermore, we observed that expression levels of some other genes that are known to be involved in EMT are regulated by TGF-\u03b2 and TTF-1. ITGA5 is reportedly up-regulated during EMT. Moreover, integrin \u03b15 (encoded by ITGA5) interacts with the extracellular matrix and enhances cell migration36. Using the 3C assay, we observed enhanced Smad3 binding to the ITGA5 promoter and the interaction of distant chromatin regions around the ranscription start site in H441 cells upon TTF-1 knockdown. Thus, ITGA5 might be another direct target of TGF-\u03b2, which is suppressed by TTF-1. Also, some genes shown in Supplementary information, Table S7, e.g., LOX and RUNX2, have been reported to promote EMT in some carcinomas37,38.

These tissue-specific factors seem not only to enable Smad3 to bind to specific regions, but also to inhibit Smad3 binding to certain regions. These factors may bind to unphosphorylated Smad3, as well as to the Smad3-Smad4 complex.
