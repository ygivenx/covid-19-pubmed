Previous studies have reported selected cases or outbreaks and may therefore give an overestimate of the risk to ICU staff [2, 3, 4]. This is important, because the perceived risk of infection may affect the willingness of staff to work in the ICU in any future epidemic.",

By the end of the period, all patients remaining in the ICU had been in the ICU for at least 2 weeks, and there were no further admissions with SARS. During the study period, only patients with SARS or suspected to have SARS were admitted to our ICU. The layout of the ICU is shown in Fig. 1. The ICU is normally a 22-bed adult multidisciplinary facility, but for 2 days during the first week of the epidemic, the capacity was increased to 24 beds by converting one of the four-bed cubicles into a six-bed cubicle. The number of air changes per hour was 15.6 in open patient areas, 16.9 in isolation rooms and 16.1 in offices. Seventy percent of exhaust air was recycled, except in isolation rooms, where 76% was recycled. Recycled air was filtered prior to recirculation. The quoted efficiency of the filters was 95% of 0.3 \u03bcm saline particles. Isolation rooms were either not used for isolation or were used for protective isolation of patients in whom the diagnosis of SARS was unclear. The nurse-to-patient ratio was 1:1. The following data were collected from patient notes and charts by a trained research nurse: patient demographic data and factors that might affect the rate of transmission of SARS\u2013duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, place of intubation, ICU length of stay, number of days with diarrhoea and days from symptom onset to ICU admission. Diarrhoea was defined as two or more loose bowel motions in a calendar day. Duration of exposure to SARS patients was obtained from nursing and medical rosters. Only staff on the roster solely to work in the ICU were included in the study. Time for rest periods was taken into account when calculating number of exposure hours. The exposure hours therefore reflect time spent in contaminated areas of the ICU. All staff who became infected were questioned shortly after becoming infected, to obtain the data presented in Table 1. All other staff who worked in the ICU during the study period were asked, after the end of the study period, to give a sample of blood to test for SARS seroconversion, to detect asymptomatic infection. Written informed consent was obtained from all staff who agreed to testing.\n\n\n",

The time of introduction of the major components of the protocol is illustrated in Fig. 2. In brief, the final protocol consisted of the following: All staff entering the ICU were required to clean their hands and don a waterproof gown, gloves, cap, full-face shield and fit-tested N95 or N100 mask. Initial fit testing involved a qualitative fit test, with a subsequent quantitative test for those who failed the qualitative test. Staff for whom an adequate fit could not be achieved with a N95 or N100 mask were issued powered air-purifying respirators. A nurse was stationed at the entrance of the ICU to ensure compliance, and staff were encouraged to ensure each other's safety by pointing out protocol errors. Entry and exit from the ICU were segregated. Hoods were the only additional personal protective equipment used for high-risk procedures, such as intubation. Patients were given oxygen at flow rates of up to 15 l/min via simple and reservoir face masks. Venturi-type masks were not used.\n\n",

Paired serum samples were tested. The tests were regarded as positive if a seroconversion or fourfold rise in antibody titre was detected.

The temporal distribution of admissions of patients and the number of patients in the ICU on any given day are shown in Figs. 3 and 4. Thirty-two patients were ventilated for a median (IQR) of 14.5 (7\u201325) days. Total number of ventilated patient days was 525. No patients received non-invasive ventilation. All patients who were ventilated were intubated by ICU doctors, 28 in the ICU and four in other areas of the hospital. Diarrhoea occurred in 55% of patients. Thirty-five doctors worked in the ICU for a median (IQR) of 284 (97\u2013376) h. One hundred fifty-two nurses and healthcare assistants worked for a median (IQR) of 119 (57\u2013166) h.

The average incubation period of SARS is 6 days, with a range of 2\u201316 days [1, 10]. This strongly suggests that the three healthcare workers who became symptomatic within 10 days of admission of the first patient with SARS were infected in the first few days of exposure, when the protective strategies were being developed and vigilance in the correct use of protective equipment was probably lowest. Thereafter, only two members of staff became infected. None of the staff who agreed to testing showed evidence of asymptomatic infection. Our data suggest that, with adequate infection control measures, the risk to healthcare workers in ICU may not be as high as earlier reports suggested [2, 3, 4]. Although significant asymptomatic infection amongst untested staff remains a possibility, this is unlikely, as other data suggest subclinical infection is rare [11, 12].",

A zero infection rate has been reported by a Singapore ICU that admitted 39 patients with SARS following strict imposition of infection control procedures [13, 14]. This unit used an even higher level of protection, using negative-pressure isolation rooms for each patient and powered air-purifying respirators. In contrast, data from a Toronto hospital, in which personal protective equipment was only inconsistently used by a substantial proportion of staff, showed that eight out of 32 critical care nurses exposed to three patients developed SARS. This occurred despite relatively short exposure times (40\u2013935 min) [3].",

            "text": "One of the difficulties in determining the effectiveness of infection control measures in SARS is the bimodal nature of spread with the existence of \u201csuper-spreading\u201d incidents, whereby, one individual infects many others, while many individuals do not infect any others [15, 16]. Different rates of infection may simply reflect the presence or absence of \u201csuper-spreading\u201d events and may be unrelated to infection control measures. Data from a hospital in Vietnam which treated 33 patients over a 6-week period revealed that no staff became infected despite lax infection control measures during the first week of exposure [17]. It is therefore possible that our low infection rate merely reflects an absence of exposure to super-spreading events. However, we believe this unlikely. Firstly, excluding super-spreading events, SARS is moderately transmissible, with an estimated 2.7 secondary infections per case at the start of the epidemic [15]. Secondly, as discussed above, our patients were likely to be maximally infectious during their ICU admission. Thirdly, many of the individual components of our infection control measures (e.g., use of gloves, gowns, caps and masks) are associated with a decreased SARS infection risk [18, 19]. Fourthly, super-spreading events appear to be associated with older patient age, more severe illness, and larger number of close contacts [16]. Although our patients were relatively young, they were severely ill and, as hospitalised patients, had a large number of close staff contacts.",
