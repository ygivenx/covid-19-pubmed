            "text": "Looking at the world from above, it is striking how once vast belts of tropical rainforest are being fragmented into ever smaller forest blocks (Myers, 1990; Myers et al., 2000; Fig. 1). Human encroachment on pristine ecosystems is driven by logging and agricultural conversion, resulting in sharp and rapidly moving gradients between the relatively cool and humid primary forest and the cultured land or villages, which show strong insolation, higher temperature, and lower humidity (Malhi and Wright, 2004). Simultaneously global warming is further modifying rainfall and temperature levels (Kerr, 2007). The consequences of these changes on the flora and fauna are frequently discussed (Trenberth, 2004; Vora, 2008; Ellis and Wilcox, 2009). In general, alterations to habitats and increasing proximity of humans to wild animals are creating new opportunities for infectious diseases to emerge in humans and wildlife, including vector-borne diseases, such as dengue fever, yellow fever, malaria, or Lyme disease, and also parasitic or respiratory infections (Daszak et al., 2000; Allan et al., 2003; Patz et al., 2005; Nunn and Altizer, 2006; Reiter and LaPointe, 2007; Gillespie and Chapman, 2008; K\u00f6ndgen et al., 2008).",

Mosquitoes are common disease vectors because they provide an effective way to spread pathogens between humans and wildlife (Gubler, 2001; Mackenzie et al., 2004; Enserink, 2007). Infection risk with mosquito-borne diseases depends on several factors, including the abundance of competent vectors, the availability of vertebrate hosts, and the biting rate (number of mosquitoes biting their host per time unit). Mosquito prevalence, density, and distribution are in turn influenced by a number of other factors: notably, temperature, rainfall, humidity, vegetation, food supply, and hatchery resources (Kramer and Ebel, 2003).",

            "text": "At 435,000 hectares, Ta\u00ef National Park in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire represents the largest remaining tropical rainforest in West Africa, yet it accounts for only a fraction of the original forest, which once covered approximately 40 million hectares (Boesch and Boesch-Achermann, 2000). The climate is characterized by two dry seasons: from December to March, and from August to September. The annual rainfall is approximately 1,800 mm in this region. In 1979 a research camp was constructed in the primary forest (geographic coordinates: lat 5.86767554/long \u22127.33968803) with the purpose of studying chimpanzees. Three additional research camps have since been built and included in this study (Fig. 1; geographic position: lat 5.87235332/long \u22127.33774074; lat 5.83327353/long \u22127.34220930; lat 5.84151328/long \u22127.34666177). Five sampling points were in the primary forest of Ta\u00ef National Park (lat 5.86350739/long \u22127.35515901; lat 5.86298704/long \u22127.35587248; lat 5.86266518/long \u22127.35780903; lat 5.86294949/long \u22127.35530385; lat 5.86287975/long \u22127.35483178). The border of the park is lined by a secondary forest, which was partially logged for agricultural use but integrated into the park in 1977. Vegetation in the secondary forest is not as high and dense as in the primary forest (trees < 20 m). In the secondary forest mosquitoes were collected at three different sampling points (lat 5.84795058/long \u22127.38078483; lat 5.84979594/long \u22127.37809190; lat 5.84871769/long \u22127.38030204). Cultivated land, including coffee plantations (lat 5.83680868/long \u22127.40369090) and cocoa plantations (lat 5.83935142/long \u22127.39825674), abuts the park. Humans are present on a daily basis in these plantations. The human population around the park increased from 23,000 in 1965 to 375,000 in 1988 and with that more coffee and cocoa plantations were established around the park. Two villages (Goul\u00e9ako lat 5.83436787/long \u22127.41086313 and Ta\u00ef lat 5.87468348/long \u22127.45474125) were included as sampling points (Fig. 1).

Traps were installed for 3 days at each sampling point. To cover the total height of each habitat and to sample a representative mosquito population, traps were set up to the canopy level for each habitat. Female mosquitoes were anesthetized with triethylamine and identified using the key of Gillies and De Meillon (1968) and Gillies and Coetzee (1987) for the Anophelinae and the key of Jupp (1996) and Edwards (1941) for the Culicidae. Species belonging to the Culexdecens complex, which can only be differentiated by dissection of genitalia, were not differentiated and are marked as Culexdecens complex. After identification, the mosquitoes were pooled according to species, sex, habitat, and altitude level, placed in sterile cryovials, and stored in liquid nitrogen.",

For mosquito abundance, we chose as the test statistic the absolute difference between trapping rates derived for secondary forest and the other habitats. We permuted the data by first randomly choosing a number of values from the other habitats, with the number of values chosen equal to the number of trap sites in the secondary forest. We then exchanged these randomly chosen values with randomly chosen values observed in secondary forest. To reflect that under the null hypothesis any observation could happen in each habitat, an actual exchange of two values (between secondary forest and any other habitat) took place with a probability equaling the proportion of other habitats in our sample. All random selections were performed with replacement, and a total of 1,000 permutations were conducted. For CPE and virus prevalence, we permuted the mosquito pools 100 times to reestimate infection probability. The multiple testing for the analysis on the induction of CPE in cell culture according to mosquito genera in each habitat required error-level correction. We did this using Fisher\u2019s omnibus test. This procedure combines a number of P values into a single chi-square distributed variable with its degrees of freedom equaling twice the number of P values (Haccou and Meelis, 1994).

We recorded significant variation in the distribution of mosquito genera in different habitats in and around a tropical rainforest region (Fig. 2). Although Uranotaenia mosquitoes were dominant in the primary forest, they were rarely found in the other surveyed habitats (permutation test, P = 0.032). Conversely, Culex mosquitoes were most common in disturbed habitats, including the research camps, but were least abundant in the primary forest (permutation test, P = 0.002). Anopheles mosquitoes were found at significant numbers only in the villages (permutation test, P = 0.029), whereas Aedes mosquitoes were mainly trapped in the secondary forest (permutation test, P = 0.019). Among these mosquito genera, Aedes, Anopheles, and Culex are known to transmit human pathogens. Because variance among species within these genera in host preference and vector competence due to differences in vectorial capacity amongst species for specific viruses is great, comparison on species level by habitat type was performed for ten species that were caught in sufficient numbers (Ae harrisonin = 85, An gambiae complex n = 71, Cx annuliorisn = 274, Cx decens complex n = 631, Cx nebulosus n = 619, Cx quinquefasciatus n = 85, Ur chorleyin = 93, Ur mashonaensisn = 630, Ur ornatan = 424). Aedes harrisoni was the most abundant Aedes species and encountered predominantly in the secondary forest. Although mosquitoes of the Anopheles gambiae complex, the primary vectors of Plasmodium, were not found in the primary forest as previously reported (Doucet et al., 1960), one mosquito of the Anopheles gambiae complex was trapped at a camp site. The majority of mosquitoes belonging to the Anopheles gambiae complex were found in the villages, indicating a potential risk for malaria infection. Culex species were prominent in human-altered habitats but differed between habitat types: Cx annulioris showed a higher prevalence only in the plantations, mosquitoes belonging to the Culex decens complex in the secondary forest and the plantations; Cx nebulosus was highest in the villages followed by secondary forest and plantations; Cx quinquefasciatus was highest in the villages.

Ninety-eight of the pools (22.7%) induced CPE; the proportion of CPE-positive pools was significantly higher in the samples originating from the villages (44%, permutation test, P = 0.002) and the secondary forest (30%, permutation test, P = 0.017) than in those originating from camp sites and the primary forest (14%, permutation test, P = 0.012; Fig. 3).

Real-time PCR assays were established for Nounan\u00e9 virus (NOUV, a flavivirus; Junglen et al., 2009), Moussa virus (MOUV, a rhabdovirus; Quan et al., 2009), Cavally virus (CAVV, coronavirus-like), Goul\u00e9ako virus (GOUV, a bunyavirus), and Herbert virus (HERV, unclassified isolate). All pools that induced a CPE were tested for the presence of these five viruses; in addition all 432 pools tested negative for yellow fever virus, dengue virus, and West Nile virus, three common viruses of the region. As summarized in Fig. 4, NOUV was only found in two mosquito pools of the same species (Ur mashonaensis) trapped in the primary forest. In contrast, MOUV was found in seven pools of Culex and other mosquitoes from all habitat types except the villages, with highest prevalence in the secondary forest. CAVV was found in 39 pools and in all habitats, with highest prevalence in the villages. The virus was most frequently isolated from Culex species; however, Anopheles (three pools) and Aedes (one pool) mosquitoes also were infected. GOUV and HERV were detected in 28 pools and in all habitats, and in three different mosquito genera: Anopheles, Culex, and Uranotaenia. In most pools, both viruses were present, but infection with only one of the viruses was evident. The prevalence of these two viruses was lowest in the primary forest and highest in the villages. With the exception of NOUV, which was detected exclusively in primary forest, we found higher virus prevalence in mosquito pools from disturbed habitats, the camp sites, secondary forest, plantations, and villages compared with the primary forest (permutation test, P = 0.001).",

This approach to vector and virus surveillance can provide important insights into changes within mosquito populations, enable early detection of viral emergence, and provide insights into human driven habitat changes on the risk of mosquito-borne infections. However, our statistical analyses showed that broader sampling approaches are needed to accurately estimate the factors driving the differences observed.",

Our data for five virus isolates from widely differing taxonomic groups are consistent with the notion that disturbed habitats, and especially human settlements, seem to support proliferation of endemic viruses more efficiently than the pristine primary forest. Aedes, Anopheles, and Culex mosquitoes were most common in disturbed habitats and likely to carry pathogens. Species belonging to the genera Aedes, Anopheles, and Culex differ greatly in their feeding preferences and further investigation of the distribution of individual species is important to identify potential bridge vectors that can introduce viruses to new habitats or hosts. If we assume that mosquito abundance and the presence of virus-positive mosquitoes represent a human disease risk, the highest risk exists in the villages, followed by plantations and the secondary forest. The risk in the primary forest is lowest, but seems to increase in association with clearings and the presence of humans at camp sites. Thus, our data are in concert with others who have proposed that changes in habitat may have a marked impact on the distribution of mosquito genera and species, influencing virus distribution and risk for human disease (Vasconcelos et al., 1992; Patz et al., 2004; Obsomer et al., 2007).",

Differences in temperature, rainfall, and humidity are known to influence the life cycles of different mosquito species, thus contributing to the success of some species compared with others (Vasconcelos et al., 1992). Variation in vegetation\u2014especially height of the forest\u2014also can have major impact on mosquito abundance in general and on specific genera in particular, as can the density of suitable hosts for blood meals (Wolfe et al., 2007). We were unable to investigate differences along a forest canopy gradient due to insufficient numbers of mosquitoes collected. Furthermore, little is known about environmental effects on the survival of viruses within mosquito hosts. In this respect, assessment of male mosquitoes as an index for horizontal transmission will be an interesting aspect for future studies.",
