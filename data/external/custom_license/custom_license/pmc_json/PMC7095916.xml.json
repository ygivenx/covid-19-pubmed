Now that the world is fighting severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), their warnings appear fully justified. The research community has risen to the occasion, working around the clock to define the disease. But government officials have not yet struck the right balance between communicating risks to the public and placing them in the proper context.",

Five days later, it called on 11 laboratories in nine countries to investigate the disease. The WHO's worldwide network has been in place for several years, but it has rarely been used for an emergency response. Its importance is now paramount. As of 14 April, the disease had spread to nearly 3,200 people in 21 countries, claiming 122 lives.",

The most likely culprit appears to be a previously unknown strain of the coronavirus, but this hypothesis has not yet been confirmed. We also do not know whether SARS is caused by a single virus or by a combination of viruses. Given these considerations, it may be a mistake to base all current SARS prevention and treatment efforts on the coronavirus.",

Although there are already early reports of mutating strains in East Asia, the sequence will help develop better diagnostic tests, treatment strategies for the disease and vaccine research. It will also help determine whether the virus jumped to humans from animals in the Guangdong province of China.",

Nearly a third of those infected by SARS are medical staff. In Hong Kong, healthcare workers have begun to steer clear of hospitals, forcing the government to turn to the private sector.

Then again, these are still early days and it is difficult to predict what the picture will look like months, or even weeks, from now. People might develop immunity to the now-novel virus, the epidemic may weaken over time, and we may be better equipped to combat the disease with vaccines and drugs.",
