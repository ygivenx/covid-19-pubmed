The structure of IFIT5 reveals a helical domain with approximate dimensions of 80\u00c5 \u00d7 55\u00c5 \u00d7 40\u00c5 (Fig. 1a and 1b). In most multi-TPR-containing proteins such as O-linked GlcNAc transferase (OGT), the relationship between successive TPRs is regular and repeating such that they form open-ended superhelical structures with distinct convex and concave surfaces4,16. In IFIT5, of its total 24 \u03b1-helices, 18 form canonical TPRs (TPRs 1\u20139; Fig. 1a), while the remaining 6 helices intervene between the TPRs such that the regular repeating relationship between them is disrupted. This results in the formation of three distinct bundles of TPRs (Subdomains I, II and III) oriented with respect to one another to give the overall protein a relatively closed clamp-shaped structure (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 5a).",

This is facilitated by a connecting 17-residue loop (L1) containing a highly conserved CHFTW pentapeptide motif that is invariant among the overwhelming majority of IFIT proteins (Supplementary Fig. 2), and forms a single turn of a helix that packs against the concave inner face of Subdomain I (Supplementary Fig. 4). This same arrangement of Subdomain I is also found in the structure of nIFIT1 (r.m.s.d. 1.4 \u00c5; Supplementary Fig. 3) and is likely a defining characteristic of all IFIT proteins given the high TPR and sequence conservation in Subdomains I and II (Supplementary Fig. 1 and 2).",

Subdomain II forms a canonical four-TPR repeat domain where strikingly, its first helix (\u03b17) interacts with Subdomain I in a manner reminiscent of TPR protein-ligand interactions observed previously17 (Supplementary Fig. 4). This leads to the concave surface of Subdomain II forming one wall of a large cavity in the centre of the protein closed off at its base by helix a2 (Fig. 1b). The same TPR-ligand relationship between Subdomains I and II is maintained in the nIFIT1 structure as well (Supplementary Fig. 3).",

All of the structures were similar, therefore we initially describe the general features of IFIT5-oligo-C complex since it was the highest resolution structure. Difference Fourier maps revealed strong positive electron density within the central positively charged pocket from which the 5\u2032-triphosphate and the first four nucleotides of the RNA could be reliably modelled (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 10a). The 5\u2032-triphosphate group is nestled deep within the pocket and makes a multitude of electrostatic interactions with protein side chains from helix \u03b12 (Glu33, Thr37 and Gln41) located at the very base of the pocket, and residues from the concave inner surface of Subdomain II (Lys150, Tyr250 and Arg253) (Fig. 2c). Arg186, which in IFIT1 (Arg187) was previously identified to be required for RNA interaction, makes a weak salt-bridge with the \u03b1\u2013 and \u03b2-phosphates and Van der Waal contacts with the first ribose moiety. These RNA interacting residues are for the most part conserved in sequence and structure between IFIT5 and IFIT1 (Supplementary Figs. 2 and 7), the only IFITs that have been shown to bind PPP-RNA with significant affinity2. One notable exception is Thr37, which is replaced in IFIT1 by Arg38, suggesting slight differences in RNA recognition between IFIT1 and IFIT5. Conversely in IFIT3, which is known to not bind PPP-RNA2, Tyr250 is substituted with a negatively charged residue \u2013 Asp242, and Arg186 with His182 (Supplementary Fig. 2), both of which would directly interfere with RNA binding.",

Based on ligand distances and geometry, the ion is likely Mg2+ from the in vitro transcription reactions, but could potentially also be Na+ (a component of the crystallization buffer). It is unlikely that capped mRNA can be accommodated within this pocket owing to size constraints. Additionally, given the critical interactions made with the \u03b3-phosphate and the metal ion, the pocket is unlikely to accept with significant affinity 5\u2032-monophosphorylated or 5\u2032-hydroxylated RNA. Thus, the structure of the IFIT5 TPR domains have evolved to specifically engage PPP-RNA, and in doing so, distinguish between self and non-self nucleic acids.",

Well-defined density is observed for the phosphodiester backbone and ribose sugars (Supplementary Fig. 10a), which also form several specific interactions with the protein (Fig. 2c). In particular, the 5\u2032-phosphate of N2 hydrogen bonds with Tyr254 and that of N3 makes a salt-bridge with Arg260 and Lys257, and hydrogen bonds with Gln288 (Fig. 2c). The 5\u2032-phosphate of N4 interacts with Arg294, and weak electron density was observed for the 5\u2032-phosphate of a fifth nucleotide (Supplementary Fig. 11a). The 2\u2032-hydroxyl of the ribose sugars also make specific interactions with the protein, but in this case, interactions that are dependent on the sugar pucker. N1 adopts a C2\u2032-endo conformation (commonly found in B-form dsDNA, Supplementary Fig. 9) and hydrogen bonds with Tyr156 (Fig. 2c), whereas N2 and N3 are C3\u2032-endo (as found in A-form dsRNA) and interact via their 2\u2032-hydroxyls with His287/Gln288 and Arg294/Asp343, respectively (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 11a).",

In both the oligo-C and oligo-U complexes, the pyrimidine base at position 1 is abutted from the top by Van der Waal interactions with Tyr156 and two glycine residues from the loop of TPR3 (between \u03b17 and \u03b18), and from the bottom by non-specific stacking interactions against the second base, which in turn stacks with Phe337 (Fig. 2c). Notably, the first two bases do not make any specific hydrogen bonds with protein residues and there is ample space adjacent to the pyrimidine ring edges, suggesting that the larger purine bases can also be easily accommodated (Fig. 3). The structure of the oligo-A complex confirms this notion and reveals that the adenine rings reach further out into the periphery making additional non-specific Van der Waals contacts with Thr371, His374 and Phe339, which were absent with the pyrimidine bases (Fig. 3b\u2013d).",

Superposition of the RNA-bound and free forms of IFIT5 reveal that the RNA-bound state is more compact, with the largest motions occurring at the pivot helices between Subdomain III and the rest of the protein (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 13). These motions position several key residues from the different subdomains for optimal interaction with the RNA. Moreover, limited proteolysis of IFIT5 in the presence and absence of RNA supports the notion of compaction and stabilization of the protein in the RNA-bound form (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 15).",

SAXS analysis revealed significant reductions in the radius of gyration (Rg, ~2.5 \u00c5), the maximum dimension (Dmax, ~25 \u00c5) and the volume (~14000 \u00c53) of the protein upon addition of RNA (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 14). The scattering curves show good agreement between solution (Rg, 28.2 \u00c5) and crystal structure (Rg, 27.5 \u00c5) for the RNA-bound form (Supplementary Fig. 14h), in contrast to the apo form, which displays significant differences (solution Rg, 30.6 \u00c5; crystal structure Rg, 28.3 \u00c5). This suggests that in solution, the apo-protein is either more open or possibly flexible. To discern between these possibilities, we subjected the SAXS data to a Porod-Debye analysis, which provides information on the degree of flexibility present in the scattering sample19. For both apo and RNA-bound IFIT5, the Porod-Debye plot showed characteristic plateaus that indicate the presence of distinct conformations for both species (Supplementary Fig. 14k,l). Thus, apo-IFIT5 likely exists in a more open conformation in solution than that observed in the crystal structure, facilitating RNA entry.",
