According to information from the WHO, between 330 million and 1.575 billion individuals suffer from influenza and influenza-like virus every year throughout the world, with deaths of between 0.5 and 1 million individuals [2]. In many countries, including Poland, for each age group, the rate of vaccination against influenza is still at a very low level, which generates high social costs, not infrequently family tragedies in the case of irreversible complications of influenza, or death of a loved one. The most effective and cheapest way to combat influenza is through vaccination [1\u20133].",

            "text": "Three pandemics caused by 3 different subtypes of the influenza virus occurred in the twentieth century [1]. The pandemic of 1918\u20131919, referred to as the Spanish flu, was caused by the A/H1N1/ virus; the pandemic 1957\u20131958, known as Asian flu, was caused by the A/H2N2/ (1\u20134 million of deaths); and the pandemic known as Hong Kong flu was caused by the A/H3N2/ (1\u20134 million of deaths) [2]. According to the present data, the 1918\u20131919 pandemic resulted in 50\u2013100 million deaths [1]. People who had lived during the pandemic and who had survived, and remembered the spectre of death caused by influenza, did not challenge the validity of vaccination when the 1957\u20131958 Asian flu pandemic occurred and were eager to undergo vaccination, notwithstanding the lesser quality of vaccines at that time compared with the present [1,4]. During the Spanish pandemic, the highest incidence was recorded in individuals aged 5\u201314 years, while the highest mortality rate was recorded in the population aged from 24\u201340 years [4]. Therefore, in order to avoid complications from influenza, and to ensure the appropriate development of children and young people, preventive measures, including regular vaccination against influenza, should be in place [5]. This does not mean that other age groups should be omitted from vaccination. The high variability of the influenza virus is a characteristic feature that has been known for many years [6]. In each successive seasonal epidemic, the circulation of influenza virus strains can be expected within a population. These strains are genetically and antigenically different from those which caused illness in the past or even in a number of recent epidemics, not only because of mutations, but also due to changes of reassortment resulting from the segmented genome [7]. This may in turn, have health and economic impacts associated with the occurrence of epidemic and pandemic influenza. Therefore, regular vaccination is one of the few steps that may be taken to protect people, especially in high-risk groups, from the potential, serious complications of influenza [1].",

In effect, throughout the world many millions of doses of unused vaccine against pandemic influenza are wasted, representing many millions of Euros. Moreover, additional costs arise from the disposal of the vaccine purchased surplus to need, and it was a shame that these sizeable funds could not be devoted to other public health purposes instead. As we have stated and written many times, and what both then and now continues to give us cause for real concern, is the fact that confidence in the WHO has been undermined, the take-up of all vaccines has decreased, and that there will be a further reduction in the already low take-up of the influenza vaccine, particularly in Poland. Therefore, we deplore the fact that all those individuals who expressed themselves so actively in the press, radio and TV did not take action to increase the rate of vaccination against influenza, particularly since the ternary composition of the vaccine for the 2010/2011 season included the A/H1N1/pdm09 pandemic strain.",
