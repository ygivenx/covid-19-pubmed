On April 28, when a student (case-patient 1) visited the school nurse on the first day that he had a fever, an infection specialist from affiliated Tzu-Chi Medical Center immediately responded. The specialist discovered that this student\u2019s close friend in the same class (case-patient 2) was already febrile. Case-patient 2, a Hong Kong resident who leaves Taiwan for Hong Kong every 3 months, had visited Hong Kong twice in March and April 2003. Both students were isolated in the hospital on April 28.",

Cough was productive in three schoolmates and dry in one. Chest x-ray results were normal for eight teenagers but showed linear interstitial pneumonia for one teenager. Four schoolmates took ribavirin for <2 days. Only the teenager with pneumonia was treated with both ribavirin and clarithromycin, for 12 days. The other four schoolmates did not take medication. All nine schoolmates became afebrile by the third day. Seven schoolmates were completely asymptomatic in 3 days. Two other schoolmates showed improvement and had normal values of all repeated laboratory tests in 5 days; however, they still had mild coughs on the seventh day, when they were discharged. The one teenager with interstitial pneumonia also had a normal chest x-ray result on the fifth day. All nine teenagers were discharged after 1 week of hospitalization and were continuously isolated in a special dormitory for another 2 weeks.

Our teenagers with presumed SARS-CoV infection had very mild courses. This benign course was not related to treatment: only one teenager had a full course of ribavirin treatment, and most of the teenagers had either no specific medications or medications for <2 days. Our preliminary presumption for the benign course was the patients\u2019 young ages. The benign course of SARS-CoV infection in our teenage students supports the WHO finding of less-severe disease in younger persons. These reasons should be explored more fully and may facilitate the development of more effective treatment and prevention programs in persons of all ages.",
