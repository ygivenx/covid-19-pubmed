He was recently diagnosed with severe falciparum malaria with multi-organ dysfunction, after being non-compliant with anti-malarial prophylaxis, while working for the Peace Corps in Togo in November 2017. He was treated with IV quinine with complete clearance of his parasitemia. He fully recovered but still required dialysis, and returned to the United States in December 2017. On the day of admission in late December, he arrived for scheduled dialysis and was found to be tachycardic which prompted him to be sent to an outside hospital, where he had an episode of confusion and dysarthria, after which he returned to his baseline mentation. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head was unremarkable. Next day, the patient had a grand mal seizure. A CT of the head was repeated which was again negative for any acute findings. No focal neurological deficit was observed following the seizure. However, the patient remained lethargic, agitated, and was not speaking or following commands, prompting the transfer to our hospital. On arrival, had a fever of 38.9 \u00b0C with sinus tachycardia of 130 beats/min, normal blood pressure and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 7. He was lethargic, wincing with sternal rub, not responding to verbal commands, and had no meningismus.",

Although most cases of P. falciparum occur in Africa, our results appear to be skewed by the large Vietnamese study [1]. There were 36 males and 13 females with male:female ratio of around 2.76:1. All the cases were preceded by falciparum malaria except one, which had P. vivax, reported from India. PMNS occurred mostly in patients who had preceding severe falciparum malaria. The mean parasitemia was 19.4% for 22 cases in which it was quantified. The common clinical features were confusion (50%), fever (47.7%), seizure (31.8%), speech abnormalities (18.2%), tremor (18.2%), behavioral abnormities (16%), impaired consciousness (16%), myoclonus (11.3%), ataxia (11.3%) and headache (6.8%). Less common features were psychosis (6.8%), catatonia (4.5%), hallucinations (6.8%), weakness (4.5%), dizziness (4.5%), mydriasis (4.5%), nystagmus (2.2%), paraplegia (2.2%), and somnolence (2.2%). The median duration of onset of PMNS in Nguyen\u2019s study of 22 patients was 4 days; in 22 patients (out of 27 that these data were available for) the median duration was 14 days. However, the syndrome can occur anywhere from 0 to 60 days following clearance of parasitemia [1]. The median duration of symptoms was 13 days (range 3\u201325 days) excluding Nguyen\u2019s study; in his study, it was 2.5 days (range 1\u201310).",

            "text": "The exact pathogenesis of PMNS is not known. Some authors suggest obstruction of cerebral microvasculature by parasitized red blood cell inducing cerebral hypoxemia [1, 7]. Hsieh et al. [7] described brain single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) findings with markedly decreased radioactivity. However, this mechanism is questionable as obstruction of microvasculature does not seem plausible due to the potentially long delay between malaria episode and PMNS. Another postulated hypothesis is immune mediated based on a positive response to corticosteroid therapy in some patients, and lagging of onset of PMNS symptoms after resolution of malaria symptoms [4]. An increment of serum and CSF concentrations of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL 2 and IL 6 has been described in some cases of delayed post-malaria cerebellar syndrome, which decreased following steroid therapy [24]. There is also some evidence of possible molecular mimicry, whereby antibodies to antigens expressed by certain strains of P. falciparum cross-react with antigens in the CNS [5]. However, a study by Siriez et al. [22] was unable to detect intrathecal IgG and specific P. falciparum antibodies in the CSF. Coinfection or reactivation of a viral infection capable of causing encephalitis has been suggested as another possible mechanism [4]. Schnorf et al. found elevated IgG and IgM antibodies against CMV and EBV in the serum but not the CSF of one of his patients, and positive IgG antibody against varicella zoster virus in the CSF and serum of the same patient albeit PCR repeatedly failed to detect genetic material of EBV, CMV, and VZV in the CSF. In fact, P. falciparum infection has been shown to induce polyclonal B cell activation and subsequent secretion of different antibodies, causing false-positive serological tests [25, 26]. Nguyen et al. implicated Mefloquine as a possible cause of PMNS since 17 of 22 patients (77%) were treated with Mefloquine. However, altogether 25 of 46 PMNS cases (54.3%) in our review were not taking Mefloquine.",

Clinical features can be variable. Most cases are self-limited but more severe cases may benefit from steroid therapy. In patients with recent history of malaria that present with neuropsychiatric symptoms, PMNS should be strongly considered.",
