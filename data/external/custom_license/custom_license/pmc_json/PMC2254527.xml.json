Despite\ntreatment, about 10\u201315% of the patients would die due to the acute respiratory\ndistress [3\u20136]. A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was isolated from\nSARS patients [7\u20139].

Spike protein is very important in the binding and fusion of\ncoronavirus to the host cells [11, 12]. The S protein of SARS-CoV has 1255 amino\nacids in length and 23 potential N-linked glycosylation sites. The amino\nterminus of the SARS-CoV S protein contains a short type 1 signal sequence\ncomposed of hydrophobic amino acids that are presumably removed during\ncotranslational transport through the endoplasmic reticulum. The carboxyl\nterminus consists of a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic tail rich in\ncysteine residues. The majority of protein (residues 12\u20131195) is outside the virus\nparticle, which can be divided into amino-terminal S1 and carboxyl-terminal S2\ndomain. The S1 domain (residues 12\u2013672) binds to the host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), while the\nS2 domain is responsible for membrane fusion [13\u201315]. Monoclonal\nantibodies against S1 domain can block the receptor binding and contain potent\nneutralization activity against SARS-CoV [16]. However, peptides derived\nfrom S2 domain can also inhibit SARS-CoV infection [12].",

At present, it is\nunclear whether molecular mimicry occurs between SARS-CoV S proteins and human\npeptides. We have approached this question using computer to analyze the\nsequence of spike protein of SARS-CoV and select regions that share the sequence\nhomology with human proteins. The criteria for the selection of potential\nregions include antigenic analysis and surface accessibility. In this study, we\nfind that several regions of the S protein share sequence homology with human\nproteins. Synthetic peptides, which represent some of these regions, were\nsynthesized to understand their roles in SARS-CoV infection.",

Algorithms predicting immunogenicity, second\nstructure prediction, protein topology analysis, and hydrophobicity were\nconducted to design the tested peptides. Immunogenic viral peptides were\ncalculated based on the algorithm developed by Kolaskar and Tongaonkar [18]. The\nalgorithm is based on a table constructed from the occurrence of amino acid\nresidues in experimentally known antigenic epitopes. The reported accuracy of the method is about\n75% [18]. In silico secondary structural analyses of spike protein were\nperformed based on PHD [19] and PREDATOR [20] algorithms. Protein topology\nprediction was based on the algorithm developed by TMHMM [21]. Hydrophobicity of the peptides was calculated\nbased on the algorithm HMOMENT [22]. Similarity searches between S protein and\nhuman genome database were performed by using BLASTP [23] with BLOSUM 62. Extra amino acid residues were added at either\nN- or C-terminus to keep the hydrophobic amino acid content below 50%.\nPeptides with high hydrophobicity are difficult to be tested in biochemical experiments\nsince most of in vitro assays\nare conducted in aqueous buffers. Also,\non average, one charged residue is added for every five amino acids. Multiple antigen peptides were synthesized by\nCytoMol Corp (Mountain View, Calif, USA). In addition, bradykinin and\nangiotensin I (Ang I) were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, Mo, USA).",

Its sequence comparison with angrgm-52 is shown in Figure 2(a).\nIn addition, because des-Arg bradykinin and Ang I are the substrates for ACE2 [25], we also compared the sequence of S protein against bradykinin (RPPGFSPFR) and Ang I (DRVYIHPFHL) and\nfound that residues 490\u2013502 (GYQPYRVVVLSFEE) of S protein showed sequence homology with bradykinin as\nindicated by bold letters here and in Figure 2(b).
