CTGF is a member of the CNN family of secreted, matrix-associated proteins encoded by immediate early genes that play various roles in angiogenesis and tumor growth [2]. Although papers and reviews on CTGF have been published, this review [3] focuses on the functional role of CTGF in cancer progression. The influence of CTGF expression on the behavior and progression of various cancer cells, as well as its regulation on various types of protein signals and their mechanisms are highlighted. Although CTGF expression seems to be associated with progression of many kinds of cancers, its expression may have tumor suppressive effects in a few cases such as lung adenocarcinoma cells, colorectal cancer cells and oral squamous carcinoma cells.",

The situation is more complex for the SARS coronavirus, which requires at least two structural proteins for VLP formation. The current study by Wang et al.

The function of glycinergic synapses in the inner retina has been known to inhibit glutamate transmissions, shaping light-evoked response in ganglion cells [9, 10]. However, little is known about the function of glycinergic synapses in the outer retina. In this issue, Shen et al. [11] reported that glycine depolarized rods and activated voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in the neurons, resulting in facilitation of glutamate release in photoreceptors and increase of the spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents in Off-bipolar cells. Furthermore, these authors reported that inhibition of a Cl\u2212 uptake transporter NKCC1 effectively eliminated glycine-evoked depolarization in rods suggesting that NKCC1 maintains a high Cl\u2212 level in rods, which is responsible for glycine-induced depolarization. This finding is quite significant since it reveals a new function of glycine in retinal synaptic transmission.",

In this issue, Medhi et al. [15] reported that subthreshold dose of nicotine pretreatment significantly decreased the CD50 value for PTZ. Sodium valproate but not topiramate, significantly inhibited PTZ-induced seizure. Nonconvulsive dose of nicotine significantly antagonized the protective efficacy of sodium valproate against PTZ-induced seizures.

Zebrafish appears to be a well-established model used in studying the development of vertebrates. The zebrafish is an ideal model and has been receiving attention as a human disease model, because the species fertilizes embryos externally, the fetus develops rapidly, and it manages to survive without cardiac function for days. Thus, zebrafish was used as the model organism to facilitate our investigation on the causal relationship between tbx5 and cardiac myogenesis during cardiac looping. Results demonstrated that in zebrafish, injection of tbx5 morpholino antisense RNA caused changes of heart conformation, defect of heart looping, pericardium effusion, dropsy of ventral position and decreased heart rate. In conclusion, this study showed deficiency of tbx5 might perturb cardiac looping progress, as well as the formation of atrium and ventricle, possibly through down-regulating cardiacmyogenesis genes such as amhc, vmhc and cmlc2 [24].",

Nitric oxide (NO) in the RVLM plays an important role in central cardiovascular regulation by regulating the sympathetic vasomotor outflow [29, 30], and cGMP-dependent NO signaling in the RVLM is impaired in hypertension [31]. To date, no studies have described the immunohistochemical localization of neurons capable of expressing cGMP within the RVLM. In this communication, Powers-Martin et al. [32] sought to identify the cellular targets for NO in the RVLM by visualizing anatomical relationship of cGMP with the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) or phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) cell group. Double label immunohistochemistry for cGMP-immunoreactivity (IR) and TH or PNMT neurons failed to reveal cGMP-IR neurons in the RVLM of either normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats or the spontaneously hypertensive rats. In addition, soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC)-IR was found throughout neurons of the RVLM, but did not co-localize with PNMT- or TH-IR neurons. These results indicate that within the RVLM, cGMP is not detectable using immunohistochemistry in the basal state and this raises the hypothesis that functional network inputs, such as the sympathetic baroreflex pathway are required to drive a sGC/cGMP cascade in the RVLM.",

For example, in vitro assays of NF-\u03baB [33] and COX-2 [34], two examples of drug targets, are employed to develop therapeutic strategies to counter inflammation. Since the regulation of immuno-modifiers is highly dependent on three-dimensional microenvironments, an in vivo assay can more accurately evaluate the effects of drugs on the expression of key cytokines. Su et al. [35] devised an in vivo, transgenic, human cytokine (e.g. GM-CSF) gene promoter assay using defined epidermal skin cells as test tissue. Test compounds were topically applied to mouse skin before or after gene gun transfection, using a cytokine gene promoter-driven luciferase reporter. Croton oil, an inflammation inducer, induced six-folds transgenic GM-CSF promoter activity in skin epidermis, and this effect was drastically inhibited by the phytocompound shikonin. These results demonstrate that this in vivo transgenic promoter assay system is cytokine gene-specific, and highly responsive to pro-inflammatory stimuli.",

In the present study [36], the MW of active principle was found to be between 30\u2013100 KDa, which induced nuclear shrinkage, clearance of the cytoplasm, cleavage of LC3-1Q and appearance of autophagic vacuoles and acid vesicles. On the other hand, arecoline (Are) triggered caspase-3 activation, peri-nuclear condensation and micronucleation. Furthermore, ANE 30\u2013100 K but not Are, inhibited the phosphorylation of rapamycin (m-TOR)-Ser2448. It indicates that different constituents of AN induces apoptosis or autophage of an oral cancer cell line.",

However, the procedures of this detection system are not easy to carry out. The fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) technique can precisely evaluate interaction between two molecules in cells, and the use of cyan-fluorescent protein (CFP) as an energy donor and yellow-fluorescent protein (YFP) as an energy acceptor has been reported as the most suitable combination of FRET signal detection [38]. Lin et al. [39] therefore established a FRET-based dioxin-detection assay. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and AHR nuclear translocate (ARNT) fused-cyan fluorescent protein 9CFP) and-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) constructs were transiently co-transfected into rat hepatoma cell line H4IIEC3 cells. No FRET signals were detected in AHR-CFP-and ARNT-YFP-transfected cells. However, dioxin treatment upregulated FRET signals in these transfected cells in a dose-dependent manner, indicating the potential of FRET technique in the detection of dioxin-like compounds.",
