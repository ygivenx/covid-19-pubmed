            "text": "RNA recombination is a very common phenomenon. It has been observed in all types of viruses using RNA as a carrier of genetic information: in positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses (1\u20134), in negative-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses (5,6), in double-stranded RNA viruses (7,8) and in retroviruses (9\u201311). Moreover, it has been shown that RNA recombination enables the exchange of genetic material not only between the same or similar viruses but also between distinctly different viruses (12). Sometimes it also permits crossovers between viral and host RNA (13\u201317). Taking into account the structure of viral genomic molecules and the location of crossover sites, three basic types of RNA recombination were distinguished: homologous, aberrant homologous and non-homologous (3,4,18). The former two occur between two identical or similar RNAs (or between molecules displaying local homology), while the latter involves two different molecules. Most of the collected data suggest that RNA recombinants are formed according to a copy choice model (4,18). A viral replication complex starts nascent RNA strand synthesis on one template, called RNA donor and then switches to another template, called RNA acceptor. Accordingly, two main factors are thought to affect RNA recombination: the structure of recombining molecules and the ability of the viral replicase to switch templates.",

They provided us with some specific data describing homologous and/or non-homologous recombination in particular viruses, e.g. in poliovirus, (19) mouse hepatitis virus (20,21), brome mosaic virus (BMV) (4,22), turnip crinkle virus (23,24) or tomato bushy stunt virus (25). As a result, the involvement of viral replicase proteins in recombination has been demonstrated (26,27) and a wide spectrum of RNA motifs supporting recombination have been identified (4,23,28\u201330). In general, the collected data suggest that there exist two major types of RNA structural elements that induce recombination events: (i) universal ones mediating template switching by different viral replicases, e.g. regions of local homology (28,31) or complementarity (32\u201335) and (ii) virus-specific ones, e.g. promoter-like structures (36,37). Unfortunately, up till now there has been no in vivo recombination system that could be used to test the recombination activity of any given RNA sequence and consequently to verify the above hypothesis and find some general laws governing the studied process.",

            "text": "In our studies on genetic RNA recombination we have used the well-characterized in vivo system developed in BMV (30,33). BMV is a model (+)RNA virus of plants (38). Its genome is composed of three segments called RNA1, RNA2 and RNA3. RNA1 and RNA2 encode BMV replicase proteins 1a and 2a, respectively. RNA3 encodes movement (3a) and coat proteins (CP) (38). All three BMV RNAs possess an almost identical 3\u2032-untranslated region (3\u2032-UTR). The first BMV-based recombination system was created by Nagy and Bujarski (33). They constructed a recombinationally active BMV mutant whose genome is composed of wtRNA1, wtRNA2 and modified RNA3 (PN0-RNA3 called the recombination vector, for details see Figure 1). Only 3\u2032-UTR was modified in PN0-RNA3, while its 5\u2032-UTR, intergenic and coding regions were unchanged. Despite the introduced changes, the recombination vector is stable and replicates when used together with wtRNA1 and wtRNA2 to infect plants. It starts to recombine if a recombinationally active sequence (RAS) is introduced just between the CP coding sequence and the modified 3\u2032 region (into the RAS-cloning site). Non-homologous recombination was observed when a 140\u201360 nt sequence complementary to RNA1 between positions 2856 and 2992 was inserted into PN0-RNA3 (a sequence from the 3\u2032-portion of RNA1 was introduced in antisense orientation) (30,33). Interestingly, the same RNA1 fragment inserted in sense orientation did not support homologous crossovers (33). Non-homologous recombination repaired the RNA3 vector by replacing its highly modified 3\u2032 end with 3\u2032-UTR derived from RNA1. The resultant recombinants replicated and accumulated better than the parental RNA3 molecule, and so the latter was out competed from the infected cells. The above system is extremely efficient, since it employs selection pressure to support the accumulation of RNA3 recombinants. Because RAS is placed in two different segments of the BMV genome, we have proposed to name this system heteromolecular.",

Consequently, the heteromolecular system could not be applied for testing the recombination capacity of various RNA motifs. Olsthoorn et al.

The examined sequences have been inserted into RNA3 as direct or inverted repeats. This demonstrated that the 101 nt hypervariable region of HCV efficiently supports both homologous and non-homologous crossovers, while the most conservative 98 nt portion of HCV's 3\u2032-UTR induces only non-homologous recombination events. Moreover, a direct comparison of the hetero- and homomolecular systems revealed crucial differences between the mechanisms of homologous and non-homologous recombination.

As a result, the idea arose to construct a BMV-based homomolecular recombination system. In such a system, both tested sequences are supposed to be present within the same segment of the BMV genome (either in RNA1, RNA2 or RNA3). Thus, a new vector should possess two separately located RAS cloning sites, be replicable and stable during infection. It has to be capable of generating viable recombinants, which have selective advantage over parental RNA molecules. Consequently, recombinants ought to be able to out compete the vector with inserted RASes. Assuming that RNA recombination occurs according to a copy choice mechanism, we decided that RNA3, being dispensable for BMV replication, is the best candidate for a new vector. Any changes in RNA1 and RNA2, which encode BMV replicase proteins, would strongly affect the studied process. The next important question was whether the location of RASes within the same (homomolecular system) or within two different segments of the BMV genome (heteromolecular system) influences the recombination activity of the examined RNA sequence.",

To this end two RNA3 molecules, prototypes of a new vector carrying two RASes, were prepared. To obtain them we used PN0-RNA3, described earlier, and a well-characterized recombinationally active sequence from BMV RNA1 (RAS1, see Figure 1). The 137 nt RAS1 corresponding to RNA1 between positions 2856 and 2992 was inserted into the PN0-RNA3 RAS cloning site, in antisense (RAS1as) and sense (RAS1s) orientations (Figure 2). As a result, we obtained Mag1- and MagH-RNA3 derivatives (30). Then the 356 nt portion of Mag1- and MagH-RNA3 3\u2032 end was replaced with a 379 nt sequence representing the wtRNA1 3\u2032 end (fragment encompassing the entire 3\u2032-UTR and RAS1s sequence) (Figure 2). In addition, a marker mutation (called \u0394Xho) was introduced within the RNA1-derived fragment to make it distinguishable from an analogous region present in wtRNA1. To this end, the XhoI restriction site (2988\u20132994) was disrupted by a 4 nt insertion (GATC) between C-2991 and G-2992.

After 2 weeks, when infection symptoms were well developed, the number of lesions formed on every inoculated leaf was counted to determine the infectivity of the MatH-BMV mutant. Individual local lesions were excised and total RNA was extracted separately from each of them. Then, the 3\u2032-portion of RNA3 progeny accumulating in examined lesions was selectively amplified by RT\u2013PCR involving RNA3 specific primers A and B (for their location see Figure 1). Reaction products were separated in a 1.5% agarose gel and their length was determined. The formation of an \u223c800 or 400\u2013500 nt DNA fragment indicated that the lesion contained parental or recombinant RNA3, respectively. In this way, we were able to determine the number of lesions in which a viable RNA3 recombinant was generated. The presence of recombinants in analyzed lesions was confirmed by standard northern blot hybridization. DNA fragments obtained during selective RT\u2013PCR amplification of RNA3 were cloned and sequenced. Finally, the results obtained with our new mixed homologous recombination system were compared with analogous data previously got using the heteromolecular system (33) (see Table 1 and Figure 3).",

About 85% of the local lesions developed during MatH-BMV infection accumulated the RNA3 recombinant instead of parental MatH-RNA3. In all of them, one RAS1 and a spacer were deleted. This indicates that crossovers occurred either within 3\u2032 end 5\u2032RAS1 present in MatH-RNA3 (inter- or intramolecular crossovers) or within RAS1 and 5\u2032RAS1 located in wtRNA1 and MatH-RNA3, respectively.

The situation seems to be more complicated in the mixed homologous system where three copies of RAS1 are present, all in sense orientation: two of them in MatH-RNA3 (3\u2032RAS1 and 5\u2032RAS1) and one in wtRNA1. Consequently, RAS1-mediated homologous recombination may happen according to four different scenarios (Figure 3). It can engage MatH-RNA3 only and occur as intra- or intermolecular process or it can involve wtRNA1 and MatH-RNA3. In the latter case, recombination can be mediated by RAS1 present in wtRNA1 and either 5\u2032- or 3\u2032RAS1 located in MatH-RNA3.",

            "text": "However, there are other explanations why \u0394Xho was absent in a large fraction of recombinants. It is possible that the mutation was removed either from MatH-RNA3, due to homologous recombination between its 3\u2032RAS1 and wtRNA1, or from the RNA3 recombinant (carrying a single copy of RAS1) because it could also have recombined with wtRNA1. To examine the first possibility, progeny RNA3 extracted from the local lesions accumulating MatH-RNA3 (lesions in which recombinant was not generated) was analyzed. About 800 nt RT\u2013PCR products obtained during selective amplification of RNA3's 3\u2032-portion were cloned and sequenced. In all of 20 analyzed clones \u0394Xho was present. To test the second possibility, a full-length cDNA clone of RNA3 recombinant containing \u0394Xho (RNA3-\u0394XhoR) was obtained. It was inserted into the pUC19 vector under the T7 polymerase promoter. The resultant plasmid named pRNA3-\u0394XhoR was used after linearization to produce an infectious RNA3-\u0394XhoR molecule by in vitro transcription. Then, RNA3-\u0394XhoR was used together with wtRNA1 and wtRNA2 to inoculate C.quinoa plants. After 2 weeks, total RNA was extracted from individual lesions and a 3\u2032-portion of the progeny RNA3 was amplified by RT\u2013PCR. Obtained products were cloned and sequenced. As described previously, \u0394Xho was present in all of the analyzed 20 clones. These two experiments proved that homologous recombination between either 3\u2032RAS1 of MatH-RNA3 or RAS1 present in RNA3 recombinant and wtRNA1 does not occur frequently enough to explain why most recombinants lack \u0394Xho. Altogether, these results supported our initial thesis that \u0394Xho was removed from 80% of homologous recombinants, since most of the crossovers occurred within 5\u2032RAS1 from MatH-RNA3 and RAS1 from wtRNA1.",

Amplified fragments were inserted into the 5\u2032-cloning site of Mat0-RNA3 in two different orientations (sense and antisense), then only in sense orientation into the 3\u2032-cloning site (for details see Materials and Methods). As a result, four different Mat0-RNA3 derivatives were generated: (i) MatH-HVR-RNA3, possessing two copies of HVR in sense orientation (3\u2032 and 5\u2032HVRs); (ii) MatH-X-RNA3, with two copies of X in sense orientation (3\u2032 and 5\u2032Xs); (iii) MatNH-HVR-RNA3, with two copies of HVR, the 3\u2032-copy in sense and the 5\u2032 in antisense orientation (3\u2032HVRs and 5\u2032HVRas); (iv) MatNH-X-RNA3, with two copies of X located in different orientation (3\u2032Xs and 5\u2032Xas) (Figure 5B).

Experiments involving MatH- and MatNH-BMV showed that recombination can occur both in homo- and heteromolecular systems and proved that the former should be at least as effective as the previously utilized heteromolecular one. Interestingly, the RAS1s sequence did not support homologous recombination during infection with MH-BMV (heteromolecular system) and it was quite active in the mixed system. This clearly demonstrates that not only primary and secondary structure but also the location of RAS within the viral genome affects its ability to mediate homologous crossovers. The undertaken experiments also revealed that homologous recombination occurs more often between two different RNAs (RNA1 and RNA3), while non-homologous recombination usually involves molecules representing the same segment of the BMV genome (RNA3). The obtained results constitute yet another piece of evidence that the mechanisms of homologous and non-homologous recombination are different. The same conclusion was reached by us earlier while studying the influence of specific mutations in BMV-encoded protein 2a (26,27). We identified among other the mutation in the 2a protein, which inhibits non-homologous crossovers without affecting the frequency of homologous ones.",

One can only suppose that the structural requirements of transfer of the replicase-nascent strand complex from the donor to the acceptor molecule must be different in homologous and non-homologous recombination. In the case of the former, a basic factor facilitating this process is complementarity between the acceptor and the nascent strand. Consequently, there is no necessity for the replication complex to be stable during homologous crossovers (22). Replicase can leave the donor template alone or together with a nascent strand. Then, the 3\u2032 end of the newly synthesized RNA molecule can function as a guide; it can find a complementary sequence in the acceptor RNA, hybridize and serve as a primer allowing viral replicase to reinitiate RNA synthesis. In non-homologous heteroduplex-mediated recombination, a factor enhancing crossover seems to be the interaction between the donor and the acceptor (the formation of a local double-stranded region) (30,33). Considering that BMV genomic RNAs are copied within spherules (44), intramolecular hybridization between RAS1s and RAS1as, located in MatNH-RNA3, is much more likely. Thus, the results presented here indicate that the way the virus replicates can strongly affect the recombination process. However, further detailed studies are necessary in order to explain this phenomenon.",

Moreover, the data presented suggest that sequence X, which adopts a very compact and stable structure (45), is not able to mediate homologous recombination. It occurs efficiently within AU-rich HVR sequences whose structure is more labile and dynamic (42). Earlier research on homologous recombination in BMV led to similar conclusions. It was shown that homologous recombination occurs effectively in AU-rich regions (47) and is not observed within highly structured 3\u2032- and 5\u2032-UTR (48). These observations concur with the proposed mechanism of homologous RNA recombination (22). It assumes that AU-rich regions facilitate the detachment of the polymerase-nascent strand complex from donor RNA. On the other hand, it is thought that the stability of RNA structure makes the hybridization of the nascent strand and/or replicase to the acceptor difficult.",

Not only does it permit the exchange of genetic material between viruses (3,4,22), frequent homologous crossovers between molecules representing the same segment of the virus genome also stabilize genetic information (48). Moreover, here we showed that homologous and non-homologous recombination might control the organization of the virus genome by removing direct or inverted repeats, which affect the virus' ability to replicate or accumulate in the infected cells. Interestingly, we observed that complementary sequences are more effectively deleted than homologous ones. It seems that some of the latter can prevail in the viral genome probably due to their compact stable structure that prevents recombination events.",

However, there are other factors which, in addition to RNA structure, can affect the course of the studied process. Specific properties of the viral replicase and the host proteins that are necessary for recombination events can be of equally great importance. Therefore, there is a need to create similar universal recombination systems in other viruses. We believe that these systems will be very helpful in finding some general rules in RNA recombination and will provide us with knowledge which is indispensable to understand how new RNA viruses or retroviruses are generated.",

A detailed description of the M1-BMV genome is presented in Figure 1. All nascent RNA3 molecules accumulating in M1-BMV infected plants were recombinants (RF = 100%). (B) Mixed system (MatNH-BMV). Three copies of RAS1 are located in the MatNH-BMV genome, two in MatNH-RNA3 (3\u2032RAS1s and 5\u2032RAS1as) and one in wtRNA1 (RAS1s). The recombination frequency observed during infection with MatNH-BMV was 95%. Of the identified recombinants, 10% were without the \u0394Xho marker, and 90% with the \u0394Xho marker. (C) Putative scenario of RAS1s/RAS1as-mediated non-homologous recombination in the heteromolecular system. Owing to the presence of RAS1s and RAS1as sequences in wtRNA1 and Mag1-RNA3, respectively, they are capable of forming a local double-stranded structure supporting non-homologous crossovers (for details see Figure 1). (D) Putative scenarios of RAS1s/RAS1as-mediated non-homologous recombination in the mixed system. The presence of 3\u2032RAS1s and 5\u2032RAS1as sequences in MatH-RNA3 and RAS1s in wtRNA1 creates several opportunities of heteroduplex formation: between wtRNA1 RAS1s and MatNH-RNA3 5\u2032RAS1as (intermolecular), between two pairs of RAS1s/RAS1as sequences of two different MatNH-RNA3 molecules (intermolecular) and between 5\u2032RAS1as and 3\u2032RAS1s of the same MatNH-RNA3 molecule (intramolecular).

To test the recombination activity of HCV-derived sequences X and HVR the following Mat0-RNA3 derivatives were prepared: MatH-X-RNA3\u2014with two copies of X in sense orientation (3\u2032 and 5\u2032Xs), MatNH-X-RNA3\u2014with two copies of X located in different orientation (3\u2032Xs and 5\u2032Xas), MatH-HVR-RNA3\u2014containing two copies of HVR in sense orientation (3\u2032 and 5\u2032HVRs) and MatNH-HVR-RNA3\u2014with two copies of HVR, 3\u2032-copy in sense and 5\u2032 in antisense orientation (3\u2032HVRs and 5\u2032HVRas).

RF, recombination frequency observed during infection involving each RNA3 derivative. (C). Homologous recombinants generated during infection involving MatH-HVR-BMV. RNA3 recombinants were only formed during MatH-HVR-BMV infection. In all of them, one recombinationally active sequence HVRs and a spacer were deleted and their 3\u2032-UTR was composed of RNA1 derived sequence and HVRs followed by the CP coding region.

Recombinant junction sites were located within the left portion of the local double-stranded region that could be formed either by Xs and Xas or by HVRs and HVRas [see (E)]. As a result, both sequences supporting non-homologous crossovers were almost entirely deleted, together with the whole spacer.
