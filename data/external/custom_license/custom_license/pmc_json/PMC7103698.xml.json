The replication rates and transmissibility of viruses are two major factors that underlie this threat. However, at least one additional factor plays an essential role: the lack of \u2018broad-spectrum\u2019 antiviral agents. Indeed, while bacteria can still cause substantial epidemics in parts of the world where access to clean water and/or antimicrobials is limited, the pandemic threats posed by bacteria, such as from the plague-causing Yersinia pestis, has been substantially diminished in the antibiotic era [1]. For viruses that pose epidemic risks, on the other hand, current therapeutic options are more limited.",

Thus, antiviral strategies must be directed at the virus specifically with care to avoid interfering with host cellular function. As such, the number of clear targets per virus may be limited. By contrast, bacterial protein synthesis, for example, occurs via ribosomes that belong to the bacteria and are disparate enough from human ribosomes in identity that specific antibiotics can be deployed to target only bacterial protein synthesis. This unique feature of viruses, which derives from their very nature, serves to delimit antiviral therapies in a manner not applicable to antibacterial therapies.",

Acylovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir are nucleoside analogs dependent on the virally encoded thymidine kinase enzyme for activity. There are separate specifically targeted antivirals such as ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet, or letermovir (this last is itself exquisitely targeted at just CMV) to be used in the treatment and prophylaxis of CMV. The tenuous nature of any rudimentary claim to broad-spectrum antiviral activity is also evident in acyclovir\u2019s 10-fold drop in activity against HZV compared to fellow viral family members HSV-1 and 2, despite targeting the same enzymatic function (thymidine kinase) [2,3].",

It should be noted, however that nucleo(t)side reverse transcriptase inhibitors such as lamivudine, emtricitabine, and tenofovir do have activity outside of HIV as they are competitive substrate inhibitors for DNA synthesis and are also able to inhibit the reverse transcriptase enzyme encoded by the hepatitis B virus (HBV) [5], likely due to a shared evolutionary origin between HBV and retroviruses [6].",

Lastly, identifying targets common to distinct viral families that are genetically similar would also be of great use in antiviral drug development. The broad-spectrum strategy should be pursued as a complement to (not in lieu of) the pursuit of targeted therapies such as monoclonal antibodies which also hold great promise for treating specific viral infection as evidenced by the successful deployment of monoclonal antibody products against Ebola, Hendra, Nipah, and hopeful future successes against HIV and influenza [35,36].",
