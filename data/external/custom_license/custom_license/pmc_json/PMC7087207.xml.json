Their genome consists of a single open reading frame (ORF) that encodes a large polyprotein [1]. After translation, the protein precursor is proteolytically processed into several structural and non-structural proteins. With a total size of 8.2\u20138.4 kb, the kobuvirus genome is organized sequentially as follows: VPg, 5\u2032UTR, leader protein (L), three structural proteins (VP0, VP3, and VP1), seven non-structural proteins (2A\u20132C and 3A\u20133D), 3\u2032UTR, and poly(A) tail [2]. The 3D gene encodes for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). According to the function of the encoded proteins, the kobuvirus genome can be arranged into three distinct regions, namely P1 (encoding structural capsid proteins), P2, and P3 (encoding non-structural proteins) [3].",

Later, the genus Kobuvirus was divided into three species; Aichivirus A, B and C (with strains abbreviated to AiV A, B, and C). AiV A includes human AiV and kobuviruses of dogs, cats, and mice. AiV B includes bovine, ovine, and ferret kobuviruses while AiV C includes only PKoV [4]. Kobuviruses have also been detected in black goats, rabbits, European roller, and bats (http://www.picornaviridae.com/). Based on VP1 sequence analysis, human AiV strains have been divided into three major lineages (1, 2, and 3) with nucleotide (nt) sequence identities < 84.8%. These three lineages were later renamed as genotypes A, B, and C [5]. Recently, Chang et al. [6] proposed four genotypes (A, B, C, and D) of BKoV-VP1 strains based on 85.1% nt identity as a recommended cutoff value for genotyping.",

As a newly recognized virus, GenBank contains just a single BKoV complete genome. In this study, we report BKoV infections among cattle populations of Egypt, the full-length genome of one Egyptian strain (BKoV/Egy-1/ KY407744) as well as the phylogenetic analysis of BKoV strains from Cairo and Sharkia provinces.",

The PCR reaction was performed using one step RT-PCR kit (TaKaRa PrimeScript OneStep RT-PCR kit Ver.2 Dye Plus; Cat. #. RR057A, TaKaRa Bio Inc, Japan). Briefly, each mixture contained 2 \u03bcl of one-step enzyme mix, 25 \u03bcl of one-step buffer, 1 \u03bcl (20 \u03bcM) each of upstream and downstream primers, 2 \u03bcl of test RNA and 19 \u03bcl of RNase-free water. The 50 \u03bcl-reaction mix was incubated in the thermocycler at 50 \u00b0C for 30 min for reverse transcription and at 95 \u00b0C for 15 min for initial denaturation. Then, 35 cycles of amplification (denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 1 min, annealing at 50 \u00b0C for 30 sec and elongation at 72 \u00b0C for 1 min) were applied followed by a step of final extension at 72 \u00b0C for 10 min. Part of the amplified PCR products (8 \u03bcl) were analyzed by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and ultraviolet illumination. To detect infection with bovine rotavirus (BRV), bovine coronavirus (BCV), and bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), RT-PCR was carried out using specific primers for these respective viruses (data not shown).",

They are transmitted through the fecal-oral route either directly from one animal to another or indirectly by consumption of contaminated food or water [4]. The present study reports, for the first time, the existence of BKoV (species Aichivirus B) in Egypt, in cattle showing clinical features of calf diarrhea. Using generic kobuvirus primers, 24 of 36 (66.7%) diarrheic fecal samples tested positive for BKoV. These results are somewhat different from those reported in prior surveys. For example, kobuvirus was detected in 16.7% of healthy cattle in Japan [10], 8.3% of diarrheic cattle in Thailand [17], and 18.2% of diarrheic cattle in Brazil [18, 19]. In other countries, the prevalence has been described as follows: 6.25% in Hungary [12], 1% in Belgium [20], 25.8 -34.6% in Korea [21, 22], 77.8% in the Netherlands [23], 4.9% in Italy [11], and 34.9% in China [6]. The highest rates of BKoV have been observed in Egypt (66.7% in this study) and the Netherlands (77.8) possibly due to the smaller sample size tested in these two studies (n = 36 and n = 9, respectively). Extensive epidemiologic surveillance should be planned to determine the endemicity of BKoV in Egypt.",

            "text": "On the other hand, VP1 is the most exterior, immune-determinant capsid protein in BKoV and is used for serotyping as it carries several neutralization domains [1, 27, 28]. Molecular typing of the VP1 gene correlated with serotype specificity as strains from the same serotype tend to be monophyletic. This information is valuable in assigning taxonomic groups [29]. Until now, the observed evolutionary variations among different BKoV-VP1 strains have been studied based only on sequencing of 17 BKoV-VP1 gene sequences of Chinese origin. Four lineages (genotypes) were proposed based on phylogenetics and nt sequence identities (with an 85.1% cutoff value) [6]. BKoV VP1 sequences from Egypt belonged to lineage 1 (Genotype A), which includes BKoVs from Brazil, Japan (only U-1 strain), and Scotland. The members of genotype A shared nt identities higher than 85.1%, validating the genotyping of Chang et al. [6]. Other genotypes (B, C, and D) contained BKoV-VP1 strains from China only, so it appears that genotype A is the most prevalent cluster worldwide. Also, it was noticed that some strains from Scotland (SC13, n = 14) formed a new group (tentatively named genotype E/ lineage 5) within the phylogenetic tree (Fig. S2) with nt identities less than 85.1% (74.6-78% with genotype A, 75.7-77% with genotype B, 74.6-75.3% with group C, and 77.8-78.3% with genotype D), indicating the presence of other genotypes that have not yet been acknowledged. It was noticed that BKoV-3D sequences from this study showed different phylogenetic topography than that of VP1 sequences, suggesting different evolutionary histories for the structural and non-structural regions. Due to the limited number of BKoV-VP1 sequences in GenBank, the present study provides important data for future genotyping and classification of BKoV.",

Between BKoV/Egy-1/KY407744 and BKoV/U-1/AB084788, twelve aa substitutions were observed within the VP1 protein (Table S1). Adaptive mutations may play an important role in inducing diarrheal outbreaks through the generation of new variants that may not be recognized by host immune defenses. Moreover, they may participate in the escape of kobuviruses from the gastrointestinal tract to the circulatory system [30]. The discrepancy in the phylogenetic topography of VP1 (Fig. 3) and 3D (Fig. 2) between the Cairo and Sharkia strains is likely due to differences in evolutionary pressure and substitution rates between structural (VP1) and non-structural regions (3D). However, recombination events in non-structural genes, including the 3D gene, cannot be ruled out as it is common for all picornavirus to recombine in such regions [31]. Whole genome sequencing and the continued surveillance of BKoV diversity are required to increase information about this virus in Egypt and to document genetic shift caused by recombination events.",
