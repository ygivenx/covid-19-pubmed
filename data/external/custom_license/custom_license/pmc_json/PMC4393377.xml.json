Organic carbamates (or urethanes)\nare structural elements of many approved therapeutic agents. Structurally,\nthe carbamate functionality is related to amide-ester hybrid features\nand, in general, displays very good chemical and proteolytic stabilities.\nCarbamates are widely utilized as a peptide bond surrogate in medicinal\nchemistry. This is mainly due to their chemical stability and capability\nto permeate cell membranes. Another unique feature of carbamates is\ntheir ability to modulate inter- and intramolecular interactions with\nthe target enzymes or receptors. The carbamate functionality imposes\na degree of conformational restriction due to the delocalization of\nnonbonded electrons on nitrogen into the carboxyl moiety. In addition,\nthe carbamate functionality participates in hydrogen bonding through\nthe carboxyl group and the backbone NH. Therefore, substitution on\nthe O- and N-termini of a carbamate offers opportunities for modulation\nof biological properties and improvement in stability and pharmacokinetic\nproperties.",

Because\nof their high affinity and specificity toward biological functions,\npeptide-based molecules also serve as valuable research tools. However,\nthe poor in vivo stability, inadequate pharmacokinetic\nproperties, and low bioavailability have generally limited their broader\nutility. Hence, a variety of peptide mimics are being developed to\nimprove drug-like character along with increased potency, target specificity,\nand longer duration of action.1\u22123 To this end, several classes of\npeptidomimetics are tailored by replacing the native amide bond with\nunnatural linkages4\u22126 such as retro-amide,7 urea,8\u221212 carbamate,13 and heterocycles14,15 as peptide bond surrogates. These functionalities confer metabolic\nstability toward aminopeptidases, the enzymes involved in the metabolism\nof peptide-like drugs. The carbamate\u2019s emerging role in medicinal\nchemistry is also due to its chemical stability and to its capability\nto increase permeability across cellular membranes.

In contrast to\nwhat was observed with aliphatic carboxylic acids, using similar reaction\nconditions, aromatic carboxylic acids led mainly to the formation\nof the corresponding tert-butyl ester, likely via\nthe displacement of an azide leaving group with tert-butoxide. This may be ascribed to the higher stability of aromatic\nacyl azides with respect to their aliphatic counterparts.

            "text": "Serine\nproteases are a large family of proteolytic enzymes that\nplay a variety of critical roles in many physiological processes.271,272 Deregulation of serine proteases has been related to the pathogenesis\nof diseases such as stroke, inflammation, Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\ncancer, and arthritis. Therefore, significant research efforts have\nbeen focused in the discovery of serine protease inhibitors. The active\nsite of all serine proteases consists of a catalytic triad of Ser,\nHis, and Asp. The nucleophilic attack by the hydroxyl group of serine\nat the carbonyl carbon of the scissile bond of the substrate, via\ngeneral base catalysis by histidine, leads to the tetrahedral transition\nstate. The tetrahedral intermediate ultimately collapses, leading\nto cleavage products.273\u2212275 These key active residues are conserved\nin all serine proteases. X-ray structural studies revealed that these\nresidues are superimposable in the majority of serine proteases.273,276 Therefore, selectivity over other serine proteases represents a\nkey issue to be taken into consideration during inhibitor design.\nMost early inhibitors acted via a covalent mechanism in which an electrophilic\ngroup formed a covalent bond with the serine hydroxyl of the catalytic\ntriad. The electrophilic groups are commonly referred to as serine\ntraps or warheads. However, covalent inhibitors lack selectivity and\nspecificity against other proteases in the same class or clan. The\nrational design of covalent serine protease inhibitors usually involves\nthe selection of a good substrate to be linked to a serine trap/warhead.\nChloromethyl ketones, diphenyl phosphonate esters, trifluoromethyl\nketones, peptidyl boronic acids, \u03b1-ketoheterocycles, and \u03b2-lactam\nderivatives are usually employed as warheads. On the basis of these\nwarheads, a variety of irreversible and reversible covalent serine\nprotease inhibitors were designed.275 In\nthis section, representative serine protease inhibitors containing\na carbamate functionality will be outlined.",

HCV infections can lead to progressive\nliver damage, cirrhosis, and liver cancer.288 The NS3/4A serine protease plays a critical role in virus replication\nand has become an antiviral drug development target.289,290 The first specific and potent HCV protease inhibitor with good oral\nbioavailability was ciluprevir, which contains a carbamate functionality\n(285, BILN 2061, Figure 25). This\nnoncovalent macrocyclic peptidic inhibitor was the result of a substrate-based\napproach for the design of active site inhibitors. This inhibitor\nis very active in enzymatic (IC50 = 3 nM) and cell-based\nreplicon assays (IC50 = 1.2 nM) of HCV genotype 1.291 Ciluprevir was later discontinued due to cardiac\ntoxicity in animal models, but its development paved the way to boceprevir\n(Victrelis, Schering-Plough, approved by FDA in May 2011) and telaprevir\n(VX-950, Vertex Pharmaceuticals and Johnson & Johnson).292,293 In particular, for the development of boceprevir, the introduction\nof a ketoamide moiety, together with P2 and P3 optimization, led to\ninhibitor 286 showing a Ki of 66 nM.294 Its X-ray crystal structure\nin complex with the enzyme also provided insight for further optimization.\nIndeed, a cyclopropylalanine residue was found to be optimal at P1,\nand the resulting carbamate derivative 287 showed a Ki of 15 nM. Although inhibitors 286 and 287 displayed good enzyme inhibitory potency, they\ndid not display cellular activity in a subgenomic HCV replicon assay,\npossibly because of their strong peptidic character.295 The discovery that an N-methylated leucine\nat P2 was critical for both enzymatic potency and cellular activity\nled to the potential of cyclopropyl-fused proline being envisaged\nas an optimum, conformationally constrained surrogate for this part\nof the inhibitor. Combination of the P2-optimized ligand with previously\noptimized P1 and P3 residues provided carbamate derivative 288 with a Ki = 3.8 nM and IC90 = 100 nM.296 Finally, truncation and\nP1 optimization, by the employment of a cyclobutyl moiety, led to\ncompound 289 (Ki = 76 nM),\nthe direct boceprevir ancestor.297",

HCV NS5A is a zinc-binding\nphosphoprotein, and its role in the HCV virus life cycle is still\nnot clear.305 However, it plays a critical\nrole in HCV RNA replication. Also, it is involved in virion morphogenesis.306 Due to the lack of enzymatic function, inhibitors\nof this viral-encoded protein have been pursued.307 Researchers at Bristol-Myers Squibb screened a library\nof compounds for their ability to inhibit HCV RNA replication. This\nled to the identification of a lead compound specifically interfering\nwith RNA replication and later proving to inhibit the activity of\nNS5A protein. Subsequent optimization was focused on broadening the\ngenotype specificity and improving pharmacokinetic properties of compounds.\nSymmetry of the molecule played an important role in inhibitory potency.\nThis finally led to the discovery of daclatasvir (297, BMS-790052, Figure 28) a first-in-class\ninhibitor of the HCV NS5A replication complex.308 Daclatasvir was approved in Europe in August, 2014. Ledipasvir\n(298, GS-5885, Gilead Sciences, Figure 28) is another carbamate-containing HCV NS5A inhibitor with\npotent antiviral activity against HCV genotypes 1a and 1b.309 Harvoni, a combination of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir\n(a nucleotide polymerase inhibitor), was approved by the FDA in October\n2014 for the treatment of chronic HCV genotype 1 infection. This also\nrepresents the first approved regimen that does not require administration\nwith interferon or ribavirin.310,311",

It is composed of cannabinoid receptors (CBRs), endogenous\ncannabinoids (endocannabinoids, ECs), and the enzymes responsible\nfor their production, transport, and degradation.330,331 ECs are a class of signaling lipids, such as N-arachidonoyl\nethanolamine (anandamide, AEA), oleamide, and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol\n(2-AG), that exert their biological actions through the interaction\nwith two G-protein coupled receptors, CB1 and CB2. They modulate a\nrange of responses and processes including pain, inflammation, appetite,\nmotility, sleep, thermoregulation, and cognitive and emotional states.332 The actions of these signaling lipids are rapidly\nterminated by cellular reuptake and subsequent hydrolysis operated\nby a number of enzymes. An attractive approach involved the modulation\nof the EC system and aimed at eliciting the desirable effects of CBRs\nactivation through the pharmacological inactivation of the main endocannabinoid\nmetabolizing enzymes, namely, monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) and \u03b1/\u03b2-hydrolase\ndomain containing 6 and 12 (ABHD6 and ABHD12). These three serine\nhydrolases account for approximately 99% of 2-AG hydrolysis in the\nCNS,333 whereas fatty acid amide hydrolase\n(FAAH) is responsible for AEA inactivation.330 Inactivation of these enzymes would elevate the endogenous concentrations\nof all of its substrate and consequently prolong and potentiate their\nbeneficial effects on pain and anxiety without evoking the classical\nCB1R agonists side effects (hypomotility, hypothermia, and catalepsy).",

MAGL is a 33 kDa membrane enzyme belonging to the superfamily\nof the serine hydrolases with a catalytic triad represented by Ser122,\nHis269, and Asp239.334 It is ubiquitously\npresent in the brain (cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, thalamu, and\nstriatum), where it localizes to presynaptic terminals, even if lower\nlevels are found in the brainstem and hypothalamus. A concomitant\ndistribution in membranes as well as in the cytosol has been reported.\nMAGL shares a common folding motif called the \u03b1/\u03b2-hydrolase\nfold. Studies in recent years have shown that MAGL inhibitors elicit\nantinociceptive, anxiolytic, and antiemetic responses. MAGL inhibitors\nhave also been shown to exert anti-inflammatory action in the brain\nand protect against neurodegeneration through lowering eicosanoid\nproduction.335 Recently, the potential\nof MAGL inhibitors for the therapy of Fragile X syndrome has been\nreported.336 The early discovered MAGL\ninhibitors were molecules able to target the cysteine residues present\nin the active site of the enzyme. Later, the research has been focused\non the synthesis of compounds covalently binding to Ser241 of the\ncatalytic triad. Among them, carbamate 305 (URB602, Figure 30) was the first selective inhibitor of 2-AG degradation,\nalthough its potency remained limited (IC50 = 28 \u03bcM\non rat brain).337 Selective MAGL inhibitors\nbearing a carbamate scaffold were developed by Cravatt and co-workers.338 Inhibitor 306 (JZL184, Figure 30) exhibited selectivity toward FAAH in\nvitro (IC50 = 3.9 nM and 4 \u03bcM for human\nrecombinant MAGL and FAAH, respectively).338 More recently, Cravatt and co-workers reported a distinct class\nof O-hexafluoroisopropyl (HFIP) carbamates bearing\na reactive group that is bioisosteric with endocannabinoid substrates.339 The representative compound, 307 (KML29, Figure 30, IC50 = 5.9\nnM, human MAGL), displays excellent potency and in vivo.

In particular, the Perspective\ncovers physical properties of carbamates and the development of novel\nchemical methodologies overcoming the historical safety and toxicity\nissues related to their preparation. Furthermore, the importance of\ncarbamate-derived compounds in medicinal chemistry and their widespread\nemployment as drugs and prodrugs have been discussed. Also showcased\nis the exploitation of organic carbamates in the development of numerous\naspartic acid, serine, and cysteine protease inhibitors. We hope that\nthis Perspective will stimulate further use of organic carbamate as\na structural motif in drug design and medicinal chemistry.",
