Millions of people died in the influenza pandemic of 1918, one of the worst epidemic disasters in recorded human history.\n1\n The life style of modern society, including overcrowded cities and rapid global transportation, has resulted in dissemination of influenza and generation of novel virus strains. In the past year, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a level\u20106 alert for the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, the highest level of disease outbreak, because of the sustained spread of this new virus on a global scale.\n2\n The world was fortunate not to have experienced another devastating influenza epidemic, because the fatality rate of the new virus strain was similar to seasonal influenza virus.\n3\n However, there remains an inevitability of a new influenza pandemic, which could be highly infectious and as deadly as the 1918 influenza pandemic. Thus, it is necessary, although challenging to detect the onset of a new influenza epidemic, to allow the government to make timely and proper interventions to reduce the social and economic impact from influenza epidemics.",

Two surveillance systems were established in Wuxi for influenza\u2010like illness (ILI) and unexplained pneumonia (UP) after the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak. The ILI system was implemented for influenza surveillance, and the UP system was designed to track lower respiratory illness with pneumonia symptoms. Although the disease surveillance systems appeared decades later than in developed countries, their performance is by no means inferior to define the distribution of circulating strains in the community and detect disease aberration. Here we described and compared the accumulated ILI data from 2004 to 2009 and UP data from 2007 to 2009. To further evaluate the effectiveness of these surveillance systems in early warning of influenza epidemics, we monitored ILI data between 2004 and 2008 by both a control chart method and the Serfling method and tested goodness of fit using influenza A (H1N1) data of 2009.",

These results confirmed the capability of ILI surveillance system to detect influenza. Although the UP surveillance system was designed to detect SARS instead of influenza, the data are useful because ILI and pneumonia usually have similar symptoms such as fever, cough, and breathing difficulty. Compared with the reference data (Figure 1), the sentinel UP data (Table 1 and Figure 3) also showed similar epidemic trend. However, the efficiency of early detection was not high using the UP surveillance system as significantly increased proportion of RIWF was observed in sentinel hospitals only after the first local case was reported. A reasonable explanation might be because of the diagnostic criteria. ILI was used specifically to indicate influenza, while RIWF includes pneumonia and many other kinds of respiratory illnesses besides ILI. The nature of the UP system could not distinguish between the respiratory complaints related to influenza and those caused by other pathogens. The population at risk could be another reason for not being able to detect outbreaks because the ILI sentinel sites and UP sentinel sites cover different areas. Nevertheless, the sentinel UP data provide additional information to detect influenza epidemic and can add confidence to declare an epidemic alarm.",

The increased proportion of ILI and RIWF before the first imported H1N1 case could be explained as a surveillance artifact because of the heightened concern of individuals. With the development of the epidemic, control strategies were changed to intensive treatment of the seriously ill and self\u2010isolation of mild cases. People who had mild flu symptoms were encouraged to take anti\u2010viral medicines and stay at home instead of seeking medical care in hospitals. All the sentinel hospitals collected data as usual without any strengthened effort. The higher proportion of ILI and RIWF observed after week 29 was more likely due to the high incidence of H1N1 influenza in general population rather than surveillance artifact.",

It also produced two false\u2010positive alarms, one in the beginning and the other at the end of the epidemic period. When using mean + 1\u00b76 SD as the threshold, the Serfling method detected the outbreaks in schools and the peak in the general population, with a false\u2010positive signal in the interval; when raising the threshold to mean + 2\u00b70 SD, only the outbreaks in schools could be detected in a timely manner, and the second alarm was 1 week after the peak in the general population (Figure 5). The comparison of the two methods indicated that the control chart method had better sensitivity and timeliness and the Serfling method had better specificity. Nevertheless, considering that the false\u2010positive alerts of the control method appeared outside the epidemic period, this fact might be taken in favor of a more sensitive detection. The same opinion was seen in Gault\u2019s paper.\n18\n A final decision probably should be made combining the results of both methods. The control chart method can generate sensitive and timely alerts, and Serfling method can offer secular trend to increase specificity and avoid wasting medical resources.",

So far no such actions, which we already took during the epidemic period, have been applied based on our study. Future studies will be carried out to improve the performance of these surveillance systems, such as adding more sentinel sites, covering larger population, improving the quality of indicators, and trying different detection algorithms. Studies of decision making are also needed before these approaches could be used in practice. The decision theory provides mathematical methods to estimate the benefits of true alarms and the costs of false alarms for getting an optimal threshold.\n25\n This analysis was beyond the scope of our current study, and we will investigate such methods in our future work.",
