However, an inherent problem is frequently encountered with false-negative PCR results, caused mainly by the degradation of target RNA and the presence of PCR inhibitors. Therefore, internal controls are incorporated into these assays to ensure reliable PCR results, in which true-negative results can be distinguished from false-negative results that are due to human error or inhibition (Hoorfar et al. 2004).",

Additionally, an internal control should be easy to prepare, stable, and safe for routine use. Currently, many diagnostic assays in which viral RNA is detected and quantified use a naked RNA control (Chang et al. 2012; Scholtes et al. 2012; Wernike et al. 2012). However, naked RNA is unstable and susceptible to degradation by RNase (Dreier et al. 2005; Felder and Wolfel 2014). Furthermore, when using naked RNA as a control, the lysis process is not monitored during RNA extraction, and therefore only partial quality assurance is achieved. Thus, developing an improved internal control for viral nucleic acid amplification tests is of the utmost importance.",

Reverse genetics technology can be used to generate chimeric influenza viruses containing a foreign RNA fragment based on the modification of an influenza virus internal gene (De Baets et al. 2013; Reece et al. 2013; Wu et al. 2010). Previous studies have shown that influenza virus carrying a reporter gene, such as GFP, can replicate normally and stably express the reporter gene in infected cells, which makes these viruses feasible for extensive propagation (Li et al. 2010; Manicassamy et al. 2010). Furthermore, the virion morphology of chimeric viruses is indistinguishable from those of wild-type viruses when observed by electron microscopy, indicating that chimeric viruses may be RNase resistant with lipid envelope protection (Maloney et al. 2015; Wu et al. 2010). Therefore, we conclude that a chimeric influenza virus carrying the target RNA fragment could potentially be used as internal control for rRT-PCR.",

During the first round of PCR, three separate fragments were amplified as follows. NS1, including the 5\u2032 genomic noncoding region but lacking the 3\u2032 stop codon, and NEP, including the 3\u2032 genomic noncoding region, were amplified from a pHW-NS plasmid (constructed by our laboratory) using primer pairs NS-F/NS1-OL-R (HCV) and NEP-OL-F (HCV)/NS-R. The HCV 5\u2032 UTR with the 3\u2032 PTV-1 2A peptide-coding sequence was amplified from a pMD18-HCV plasmid (constructed by our laboratory) using primers HCV-OL-F (NS1) and HCV-OL-R (NEP). After cleanup, the HCV plus NEP fragment was constructed by subsequent rounds of PCR using primers HCV-OL-F (NS1) and NS-R. PCR products were gel purified. Then, the final round of PCR fused NS1 to the N terminal of HCV-NEP via a short GSG linker using primers NS-F and NS-R. To introduce silent mutations at the splice acceptor site in NS1, nucleotides 524 to 527 (5\u2032-TCCA-3\u2032) were replaced with 5\u2032-CCCG-3\u2032 using primers NS1-M-F and NS1-M-R. All of the primer sequences that were used in this study are shown in Table 1. The engineered NS-HCV segment was cloned into the BsmBI site of the pHW2000 vector to generate the chimeric plasmid pHW-NS-HCV. The construct was sequenced across the entire NS gene to confirm insertion. Chimeric plasmids carrying the other seven gene segments of the PR8 virus (pHW-PB2, -PB1, -PA, -HA, -NP, NA and -M) were already constructed in our previous studies (Wang et al. 2012).\n",

Forty-eight hours after transfection, supernatants and cells were collected and subsequently inoculated into 10-day-old specific pathogen-free chicken embryos for virus propagation. At 72 h post-inoculation, allantoic fluids were harvested and centrifuged at 5000\u00d7g for 20 min to remove cell debris. The harvested allantoic fluids were subjected to hemagglutination (HA) assay to determine the presence of viruses. To explore the stability of rPR8-HCV, the chimeric viruses were subcultured on chicken embryos for eight passages.

This cleavage site allowed NEP to be translated independently of the NS1-HCV fusion protein. The splice acceptor site was removed to prevent splicing of NS mRNA. Additionally, the original NS1 translation stop codon TGA was deleted by site-directed mutagenesis so that the HCV gene could be fused to the NS1 protein product. The resultant cDNA was then inserted into the bidirectional expression pHW2000 plasmid to obtain the pHW-NS-HCV construct (Fig. 1a). The recombinant influenza virus, named rPR8-HCV, was successfully rescued by co-transfection with plasmids containing the other seven influenza genes into 293T cells, as described in \u201cMaterials and methods\u201d (Fig. 1b). The successful incorporation of NS-HCV into rPR8-HCV virions was examined by silver staining. As expected, an absence of the NS segment within the rPR8-HCV virus was observed. The rPR8-HCV virus had a chimeric NS-HCV segment along with the NP segment, which migrated to nearly the same position (Fig. 1c). Specific NS-HCV chimeric DNA could be readily detected from passages 1 to 8 for chimeric viruses, demonstrating that the rPR8-HCV virus was genetically stable (Fig. 1d).\n",

Similarly, we hypothesized that chimeric influenza virus could also be used as internal control for nucleic acid test, because the lipid envelope structure of influenza virus would protect the RNA of interest from adverse effect. To date, chimeric influenza virus carrying a long foreign gene have centered on modifying the neuraminidase (NA), matrix protein (M), or NS genes of the influenza viral genome (Kittel et al. 2005; Li et al. 2010; Manicassamy et al. 2010; Wu et al. 2010). Thus, we tried to insert the HCV 5\u2032 UTR into one of these three genes and only the chimeric influenza virus carrying the HCV 5\u2032 UTR was successfully generated by utilizing the smallest NS segment. The insertion of HCV 5\u2032 UTR into NS segment is analogous to the NS1-GFP virus, which was previously reported by Manicassamy et al. (Manicassamy et al. 2010). After that, we evaluated the inactivated and purified chimeric virus particles as an internal control for routine clinical diagnostic rRT-PCR assay. The results show that our obtained chimeric influenza virus is resistant to RNase and is stable, even in plasma, for up to 252 days.

Using influenza reverse genetics, specifically designed RNA was packaged into virions, thereby protecting the target RNA from RNase degradation within the viral envelope. Thus, the chimeric viruses used as internal control could be more stable than the naked RNA. As expected, rPR8-HCV particles were found to be resistant to RNase digestion and exhibited improved storage and handling properties, which will ensure the reliability of qRT-PCR diagnostic assays. Although HCV RNA within the viral particles was not completely stable at temperatures over 4 \u00b0C, its stability was preserved in plasma at 4 \u00b0C for at least 8 months. It could also be stored for 12 months at \u221220 \u00b0C and endured five freeze\u2013thaw cycles in plasma. Additionally, the chimeric viral particles can be used as control to monitor the entire process of rRT-PCR assays, including the RNA extraction step, which could not be achieved when using naked RNA transcripts.",

            "text": "Nevertheless, the manipulation of the internal gene faces some potential problems that must be overcome both theoretically and operationally. First, the influenza virus RNA genome is relatively small, and this limits the length of the incorporated target RNA (Garcia-Sastre and Palese 1995). The foreign genes introduced into influenza virus are usually restricted in several hundred nucleotides, which is suitable for most rRT-PCR assays because the RNA length in these assays is usually less than 500 bases. Indeed, the results presented here indicate that a 330-nucleotide HCV RNA sequence could be successfully inserted into virions. A previous report has shown that a GFP gene up to 720 nucleotides could be packaged and propagated using this same strategy, indicating that it is possible to carry a target gene of more than 700 nucleotides (Manicassamy et al. 2010). Further investigation is required to determine if this technique will work for inserting longer fragments, which are particularly important for assays based on signal amplification (e.g., bDNA hybridization) instead of sequence amplification (e.g., rRT-PCR). Second, the high mutation rate of the influenza RNA genome may lead to the loss of inserted target genes (Luytjes et al. 1989). However, the chimeric rPR8-HCV appeared to be completely genetically stable and was able to replicate to high titers in embryonated eggs. Interestingly, even after eight passages in embryonated eggs, the rPR8-HCV virus still showed no loss of the foreign HCV gene. Finally, infectivity may be a potential disadvantage for the routine use of chimeric influenza viruses as internal controls (Falchieri et al. 2012). The PR8 influenza virus bears infectivity, but it has strong host specificity for mice. It is noninfectious to humans, and thus there is little danger of accidental infection during manufacture. Furthermore, embryonated egg cultures confirmed that all chimeric viruses had lost their infectivity after inactivation by formaldehyde. Therefore, the chimeric virus particles can be developed as internal controls that present no infection risks, allowing them to be shipped and used safely. Nonetheless, proper clinical laboratory safety precautions should be followed because the chimeric virus particles represent genetically modified organisms.",
