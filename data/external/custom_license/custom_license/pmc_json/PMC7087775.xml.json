Since then, and given the uncertainties about the risk and management of pregnant women infected by nH1N1, all pregnant women with ILI who presented at the Hospital Universitario La Paz were admitted for hospitalisation. A diagnostic test for nH1N1 influenza A virus by specific reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in nasopharyngeal swab was performed in all of these patients. Recommendations for the use of neuraminidase inhibitors (NI) changed during the course of this study. At first, the use of NI was individualised as per clinical judgment. On 15th August, a specific protocol for the management of ILI during pregnancy was locally approved (Fig. 1). The Hospital Universitario La Paz is a 1,300-bed tertiary academic centre belonging to the Spanish National Health Service, which provides medical assistance to a mixed urban and rural population of approximately 600,000 people in Madrid, Spain. The time frame of the study included the period from 1st July 2009 to 20th September 2009. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Hospital Universitario La Paz.\n\n",

Only one-third of the non-influenza-related ILI in pregnant women had an alternative aetiologic diagnosis. Interestingly, the most frequently found agents were rhinovirus, followed by parainfluenza virus. None of these aetiological agents has a specific treatment nor was the clinical presentation of the patients infected with these alternative agents severe. Respiratory viruses have a clear seasonality, and variations in the aetiology of ILI should be expected in both time and region. Though, it has to be remarked, that this study was performed in Spain in the summertime. Indeed, this fact could explain the absence of respiratory syncytial virus. In addition, the impact of nN1H1 on the epidemiology of other circulating respiratory virus remains unknown and should be considered.",

This fact hampers the proper identification of pregnant women with influenza who would benefit from early antiviral therapy, which has been postulated as one of the most relevant modifiable factors influencing the severity of the disease in pregnant women [5]. This was, indeed, a significant clinical problem when nH1N1 virus started to circulate. At that time, not enough information on the severity of the disease nor enough data on the safety of neuraminidase inhibitor in pregnancy were yet available. In addition to the lack of information at that time, nH1N1 was circulating but significantly below the epidemic threshold in Madrid (45 cases per 100,000 inhabitants) and only one out of three ILI were due to influenza. From our standpoint, when deciding whom to empirically treat with antivirals, the epidemiologic context, the severity of the clinical presentation and the presence of additional risk factors for severe disease should be considered. Given the low sensitivity of rapid antigen tests reported for nH1N1 during the study period, we decided not to include this assay in the diagnostic protocol. Nevertheless, due to its high positive predictive value, a positive result could have helped to promptly identify pregnant women infected with influenza, regardless of the necessity of performing RT-PCR.",

We would like to remark that, beyond the contention phase of the influenza pandemic alert planning, clinical decision protocols in pregnant women with ILI should be adjusted to the local epidemiology context, which should be closely monitored, on the basis of the non-specific presentation of influenza in pregnant women. From our standpoint, this is especially necessary when the pandemic influenza activity remains below the epidemic threshold. In these circumstances, perhaps an individualised management protocol should be recommended. Additionally, on the basis of these results, we believe that the application of an extensive microbiological work-up in non-severely ill ILI pregnant women is not efficient and does not provide great assistance for the management of these patients.",
