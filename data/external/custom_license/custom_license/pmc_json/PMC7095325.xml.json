New restrictions on the publication of sensitive information relevant to biological weapons, on access to \u2018select\u2019 biological agents for research, and on the training of scientists from specified countries are some examples. Although restrictions on scientific activities might make sense in the context of nuclear-weapons proliferation, they may end up being counter-productive for the United States' defence against bioterror.",

Infectious disease cannot easily be restricted to any location, region or even nation. The World Health Organization (WHO) has documented numerous cases of global disease spread, including that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003. This virus disease originated in southern China and spread to nearly 30 countries, resulting in 8,098 infections and 774 deaths over nine months1.",

If terrorists released a biological agent in a region where quick identification of a disease outbreak was unlikely, they could exploit the ease of international travel to spread the disease to \u2018targeted\u2019 countries once it had established a sufficiently strong foothold to make containment difficult. Consequently, attention to the global dimensions of bioterror threats is particularly important, including strengthening inter-national means to identify and contain outbreaks of infectious disease.",

Homeland defence priorities3 have emphasized diplomatic, intelligence, law-enforcement (including disruption of terrorists' financial networks) and border-control measures designed to keep potential biological weapons out of the hands of terrorists. These are valid efforts but they do not fully address the international dimensions of modern bioterrorism and the most likely route by which an attack will reach the United States. It is also widely accepted that the \u2018open\u2019 nature of US society creates vulnerabil-ities to terrorism3. But when preparing ourselves for a bioterror attack, an open academic and educational system is one of our most important defensive strengths. New ways of thinking about security are sorely needed.",

This must occur at several levels. First, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia, must be better equipped to provide significant support and training to inter-national public-health personnel. Although such support has long been a focus of the CDC, the agency does not have the resources to expand these efforts: in 2003 the Council on Foreign Relations4 reported that even domestic training is \u201cdrastically underfunded\u201d. Second, efforts at the WHO to improve infectious-disease surveillance and containment must become priorities for the United States.
