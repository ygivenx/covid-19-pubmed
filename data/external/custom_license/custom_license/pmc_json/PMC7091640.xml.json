Thus, there is a high probability that viruses will rapidly develop resistance to a particular siRNA during virus replication by incorporation of nucleotide mutations within the target sequence of the siRNA. Thus, it has been shown that hepatitis C virus becomes resistant against a particular siRNA after several cycles of replication by the incorporation of point mutations within the siRNA target sequence.17 Similar data have been reported for HIV-118 and poliovirus infections.19 Therefore, therapeutic targeting of non-variable virus-binding receptors on susceptible cells or other host cell molecules directly or indirectly involved in virus infections is an interesting alternative to targeting of the virus itself.15, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 One approach of this type showed that downregulation of the CD4-independent attachment receptor (DC-SIGN) significantly inhibited HIV infection of dendritic cells (DC) and prevented the transfer of infectious HIV-1 particles from DC to T cells.22",

It has been shown recently that suppression of CAR by RNAi results in inhibition of CoxB3 infections.15, 27 These studies were carried out with cells of non-cardiac origin, and chemically synthesized siRNAs were used to inhibit CAR expression. However, the therapeutic use of synthetic siRNAs is significantly limited by their rapid degradation in target cells resulting in only transient gene silencing.28 Moreover, most cells of cardiac origin are very difficult to transfect with chemically synthesized siRNAs even in vitro. These problems are significantly aggravated in vivo. Despite intense efforts during recent years, systemic and target organ-specific delivery of siRNAs remains a major hurdle for in vivo applications of RNAi.",

The studies thus indicate cell type-specific responses of cellular CAR to shCAR treatment, which need to be considered as important determinants of this new antiviral approach in vivo.",

To test their efficacies, we co-transfected 293T cells with shCAR2m-, shCAR3m- or shCAR4m-expressing plasmid, together with plasmids expressing recombinant mCAR1 and mCAR2. As a transfection control, a plasmid expressing an irrelevant shRNA was used. To determine the extent of recombinant mCAR1- and mCAR2-mRNA downregulation, total cellular RNA was isolated 48 h after transfection and Northern blot hybridization was carried out. These experiments showed that two shRNAs were highly efficient: shCAR2m with 93% silencing and shCAR4m with 97% silencing of mCAR1- and mCAR2-mRNA. The control shRNA affected neither mCAR1- nor mCAR2-mRNA expression (Figure 2a).",

At an MOI from 60 to 100, GFP expression was seen in 76\u201380% of the cells, whereas no cytotoxic effects were observed. Further dose escalation resulted in an only slight further increase of transduction rate (Figure 3a), and at an MOI of 500 or higher, cytotoxic effects became evident (increase of apoptotic cells, reduction of cell growth). HL-1 cells express mCAR1 but no mCAR2 on their cell surface (not shown). Therefore, the silencing capacity of the new AdshCAR4m (Figure 1), which expresses the above-evaluated most efficient shCAR4m, was investigated with respect to mCAR1 expression in HL-1 cells only. To assess the amount of AdV-generated shCAR4m, HL-1 cells were transduced with AdshCAR4m at an MOI from 5 to 1000. The expression of shCAR4m was analyzed 24, 48 and 72 h later. A time- and dose-dependent transcription of shCAR4m was detected (Figure 3b). As a consequence of shRNA expression, strong downregulation of mCAR1-mRNA was observed 48 and 72 h after transduction. Near maximal reduction of 85\u201390% was observed at an MOI of 100. Higher doses did not result in significant further downregulation of mCAR1-mRNA (Figure 3c). These results indicate that an MOI of 100 was optimal for HL-1 transduction, as this dose allowed strong downregulation of mCAR1-mRNA in HL-1 cells, although cytotoxicity of the viral vector was still very low.",

This procedure led to ablation of mCAR1 protein at the cell surface 2 days after transduction (Figure 4a and b). In contrast, control cells rapidly re-expressed mCAR1 (Figure 4b). Two days after AdshCAR4m treatment, a few cells still displayed some membrane-associated mCAR1 immunoreactivity (Figure 4b), probably reflecting residual mCAR1 domains still anchored in the cell membrane after trypsinization. At days 3 and 4 after AdshCAR4m transduction, mCAR1 immunoreactivity disappeared from HL-1 cells, whereas it remained permanently detectable in the control cells (Figure 4b). Interestingly, CAR was expressed only at cell-to-cell contact sites in HL-1 cells, suggesting that the observed stability of CAR in intact monolayers is determined by homophilic or heterophilic CAR interaction at cell-to-cell contact sites. Together, the results indicate that AdshCAR4m treatment efficiently inhibits the de novo synthesis of mCAR1.",

For this purpose, we first investigated the CoxB3 protective efficacy of AdshCAR4m as a function of dose, at an MOI of AdshCAR4m ranging from 10 to 100, using the same trypsin-involving experimental procedure as described above. HL-1 cells were infected with CoxB3 48 h after transduction with AdshCAR4m and the amount of newly generated progeny virus was determined 6 days later. Virus plaque assays clearly demonstrated that CoxB3 replicates in HL-1 cells, but at a rather low frequency because no cytopathogenic effect was visible during the 6-day investigation period. As expected, the strongest reduction of CoxB3 progeny virus production by 97% was observed at the highest AdshCAR4m dose with an MOI of 100. Nevertheless, MOIs of 50 and 25 still led to significant inhibition of CoxB3 replication by 85 and 75%, respectively, whereas an MOI of 10 showed no significant effect (Figure 5a). To investigate whether disruption of pre-existing CAR affects CoxB3 infections, we either treated HL-1 cells with the trypsin-involving experimental procedure described above, or omitted the trypsinization step after AdshCAR4m transduction. The titers of CoxB3 progeny virus generated 5 and 6 days after CoxB3 infection were reduced strongly by about 97% in AdshCAR4m-transduced cells, irrespective of whether membrane-associated CAR was disrupted by trypsinization or not (Figure 5b). These experiments indicate that AdshCAR4m inhibits CoxB3 replication in HL-1 cells with high efficacy. Moreover, proteolysis of membrane-associated CAR apparently does not affect CoxB3 infection.",

After 24 h, cells were either trypsinized and re-seeded, or the medium was simply changed (treatment without trypsinization). Cells were infected with a luciferase marker adenovirus (MOI of 5) 2\u20135 days after transduction. The measurement of luciferase activity 24 h later revealed persistent reduction of marker gene expression of about \u224875% in AdshCAR4m-treated HL-1 cells during the 5-day investigation period. This clearly demonstrates that CAR-shRNA treatment inhibits adenovirus uptake into HL-1 cells, but markedly less efficient than for CoxB3.

For this reason, PNCMs were transduced with AdshCAR2m whose shRNA sequence completely matches with mouse and rat CAR sequences, or with the control vector AdshGFP, both at an MOI of 100. At this dose, nearly 80% of PNCMs were transduced with AdV (not shown), which is closely similar to the HL-1 cells. Following the treatment of PNCMs with AdshCAR2m, CAR expression was unaffected up to day 3 after transduction, but became strongly downregulated on days 6 and 8 after transduction (Figure 7a). As a consequence of this delayed CAR downregulation, challenge of AdshCAR2m-treated PNCMs with CoxB3 (MOI of 1) resulted in delayed inhibition of CoxB3 replication. In fact, significant reduction of CoxB3 replication was seen only if PNCMs were infected with CoxB3 on days 6 and 8 but not on day 3 after AdshCAR2m treatment. The degree of CoxB3 inhibition was strongly dependent on the AdshCAR2m dose. At an MOI of 100, the AdshCAR2m treatment led to reduction of CoxB3 titers by 66 and 90%, whereas at an MOI of 25, CoxB3 titers were reduced by only 16 and 34% on days 6 and 8, respectively (Figure 7b). Similar results were obtained when AdshCAR2m-transduced PNCMs (MOI of 100) were infected with adenovirus.

This strategy is an attractive alternative to siRNA-based silencing of virus-encoded gene, because it drastically reduces the probability of escape mutant development.22 In contrast to previous work,15 our investigations were carried out in myocardial cells representing the actual targets for CoxB3 and adenovirus infections in acute myocarditis and inflammatory cardiomyopathy.32 Treatment of HL-1 cells with the shCAR vector led to efficient and stable removal of mCAR protein from the cell surface, and consequently, to significant inhibition of CoxB3 and adenovirus infection of these cells. Remarkably, adenovirus internalization was reduced by only \u224875% despite the near-complete silencing of mCAR expression, whereas CoxB3 infection was inhibited by up to 97%. In contrast, CAR silencing in PNCMs resulted in strong inhibition of both adenovirus and CoxB3 infections (by 92 and 90%, respectively). Adenovirus binding to cells is not exclusively mediated by CAR. Type 2 and 5 adenoviruses use CAR to attach to the cell surface,33 whereas its internalization occurs through \u03b1v\u03b21, \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25 integrin.29, 34, 35 Others have shown that heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans and major histocompatibility complex class I molecules may also be involved in the binding of adenoviruses 2 and 5.36, 37 Moreover, the expression of receptors involved in adenovirus infections is highly variable between different cell types and tissues.38 Thus, variable receptor expression levels and interactions of adenoviruses with cell type-specifically expressed alternative receptors are the most likely explanation for the failure of complete CAR silencing to achieve efficient blockade of adenovirus infection in HL-1 cells. To enhance efficacy in inhibition of adenovirus infection via the anti-receptor approach, it seems to be necessary to simultaneously inhibit CAR and its co-receptors.",

The molecular reason for the differences of anti-CAR treatment in adenovirus versus CoxB3 infections may be the unique role played by CAR during CoxB3 infection as it induces conformational changes in the virus capsid that are essential for CoxB3 entry into the target cell.27 The high efficacy of the shCAR vector against this virus indicates that CAR silencing is a promising therapeutic approach against CoxB3 infections of the myocardium. Previous studies have shown a similar degree of inhibition when using siRNAs directed against CoxB3 viral genomic RNA or its RNA intermediate.14, 15, 39 Combination of direct antiviral approaches, which are prone to escape mutant development with the current anti-receptor strategy, is likely to further increase the efficacy of RNAi-based antiviral therapy.",

In contrast to previous CAR silencing attempts using synthetic siRNAs, the newly developed viral vectors AdshCAR4m and AdshCAR2m achieved near complete and stable knockout of CAR. This was an essential prerequisite to reveal significantly different kinetics of CAR protein ablation in different cell types, in particular, an unexpectedly high stability of CAR in primary cells versus a stable cell line. These data may be explained by cell type-specific CAR protein kinetics, but differential CAR-mRNA stability or CAR-shRNA processing through the cellular microRNA/shRNA machinery also need to be taken into account. The delayed downregulation of CAR following vector-mediated CAR-shRNA delivery in primary cardiomyocytes is relevant for in vivo investigations because the time lag between vector application and CAR silencing needs to be considered in the development of antiviral therapy protocols.",

Furthermore, treatment of HL-1 cells with AdV-generated shCAR revealed no side effects as we found no changes in cell growth, cell morphology or F-actin cytoskeleton protein expression (not shown).

HL-1 cells were transduced with AdshCAR4m or control vector (MOI of 100) as in Figure 4. After 24 h, cells were trypsinized and re-seeded (with trypsinization) or the medium was changed (without trypsinization). At 48 h after transduction, the cells were infected with CoxB3 at an MOI of 1. Five and six days later, cells were lysed by three freeze/thaw cycles and virus titers were determined by plaque assay on HeLa cells (left-hand diagram).
