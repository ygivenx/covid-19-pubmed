It is made up of three components: the O antigen (or O polysaccharide) side chain, the core oligosaccharide, and the lipid A moiety.8 LPS is an extremely biologically active substance and has been used for many years in preclinical and clinical research, due to its role in activating many transcription factors. In the serum, LPS binds to a lipid-binding protein, which facilitates the association between LPS and CD14 on the cell membranes. This in turn facilitates the transfer of LPS to the TRL4/MD2 complex (Figure 1).9 This triggers a signaling cascade in macrophage lineage and endothelial cells, resulting in the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide, and the activation of complement and the coagulation systems that contribute to characteristic features of inflammation, and with excessive stimulation, \u201cendotoxic shock.\u201d",

In addition, LPS activation results in enhanced macrophage phagocytic and cytotoxic activity. Activation of alternative complement pathway factors C3a and C5a induce histamine release, and affect neutrophil chemotaxis and accumulation. Kinin activation releases bradykinins and other vasoactive peptides, which cause hypotension. The release of these mediators and subsequent systemic response make LPS a powerful research tool in evaluating inflammatory pathways.",

When averaged over the 4-week treatment period, sputum neutrophils were significantly reduced in the active group by 57% compared to placebo (P = 0.01). There were fewer mild exacerbations (1.3 vs 2.25; P = 0.05), and there was a trend towards fewer severe exacerbations in the SCH527123 group. The Asthma Control Questionnaire score was improved by 0.42 points in the active group compared with the placebo-treated group (P = 0.053), although the difference did not reach clinical significance, and no changes were observed in FEV1. This shows that in asthma, the O3 challenge model has proved useful in demonstrating inhibition of neutrophil numbers, associated with a clinical meaningful effect.",

Therefore, safety boards may be advised to only consider subjects with mild COPD for inclusion in these studies. Healthy subjects could be used as an alternative, when determining the effects of a developmental drug\u2019s mechanism of action on lung inflammation. The LPS and O3 models have been used successfully in healthy subjects.13\u201315,22,24,26\u201328 As these models represent the local inflammation in the lung during an exacerbation, and test the mechanism of action of potential novel drugs, these data may be used for future decision making.",

Pharmaceutical companies have used LPS models as a means to establish proof of principle early during the clinical development process, because they are relatively simple to perform and have few adverse events. This model is cost effective because it can be conducted in healthy subjects, who are easy to recruit. LPS challenge data, whether positive or negative, can provide valuable information to aid investment decision making. One disadvantage of the LPS model is that it is a model of lung inflammation, but not of the disease state, thus preclinical validation of the developmental drug\u2019s effects on LPS pathways is essential. For anti-inflammatory targets that are involved in the toll-like receptor 4, NF-\u03ba\u03b2 pathway, the LPS challenge model is the model of choice.",

It has been used successfully to generate biological effect and systemic effect for fluticasone and the CXCR2 antagonists, SCH527123 and SB-656933.27,31 A limitation of the O3 model is that it has yet to be determined whether inhibition of neutrophilia translates into clinical benefits for patients with COPD. Preliminary data indicate that inhibition of the neutrophil response following O3 challenge may be associated with beneficial changes in system scores obtained in subjects with COPD.",
