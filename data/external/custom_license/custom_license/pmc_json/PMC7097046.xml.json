For example, automated systems for the detection and identification of microorganisms and for the identification of resistant organisms have been developed2. These include automated blood-culture assays and systems for the phenotypic identification of bacteria. Antibiotic-sensitivity testing and computerized interpretation systems have also been developed3. These developments have not led to significant changes in the microbiology itself, but rather enable more samples to be processed by fewer personnel and provide increased intra- and inter-laboratory reproducibility. Similar developments have been seen with immunoassays: enzyme-linked immunosorbant assays (ELISAs) have been extensively automated and standardized in recent years and have also become cheaper. Many of the automated tests that are now available were initially designed for the mass testing of blood that is destined for blood banks, but later innovations led to western blots for the confirmation of HIV infection and Lyme disease and the development of tests for the rapid detection of anti-HIV antibodies in saliva or blood2. Worldwide \u2014 mainly because of the cost of containment measures for infectious diseases \u2014 there has been a general tendency over the past 10 years to centralize clinical microbiology laboratories such that they serve several hospitals, therefore maximizing the efficiency of testing at the lowest cost4. However, such centralization of clinical microbiology laboratories can result in a lack of consultation between physicians and clinical scientists.",

PCR using universal primers followed by sequencing of the amplification products has enabled the rapid identification of cultured and uncultured bacteria and fungi. This procedure is now available in many large university hospital laboratories and is also carried out by new companies in the private sector. Genetic testing can also be used to identify DNA sequences that are associated with antimicrobial resistance. Viral loads can also be determined by PCR and this has been found to be a useful method for evaluating antiviral therapies. Finally, molecular methods allow typing of microorganisms, which can help to analyse the epidemiology of outbreaks and identify their sources, as well as distinguishing between relapse and re-infection in the case of persisting microorganisms. Indeed, infection control is now considered to be part of clinical microbiology.",

The use of molecular-biology techniques has dramatically changed clinical microbiology and the integration of the two disciplines is an important challenge for the future. In addition to detecting well-known pathogens, the laboratories of the future will also have to be able to recognize new pathogens and participate in food-safety monitoring and bioterrorism surveillance4. Recent experience has shown the necessity for laboratories to be able to rapidly develop diagnostic tests for new diseases that have a high social impact, as was the case with the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Means must also be available for the rapid transfer of such technology to laboratories in which routine diagnostics are carried out. A current problem is that scientific responses to emerging threats are far more rapid than are administrative responses, and there are often prolonged delays in the approval of new diagnostic tests for use outside research laboratories.",

The development of 'molecular microbiology' \u2014 and therefore progress in clinical microbiology \u2014 has been linked to the development of online databases. Scientists worldwide can now send their own sequences to these databases and there has been an explosion in the amount of sequence data that are available. Of the databases that are available at present, GenBank6 is the largest and the most versatile.

The sequences of some of these genes \u2014 for example, rpoB (which encodes the RNA polymerase \u03b2-subunit)9 and the SIGMA-FACTOR genes10 \u2014 differ between bacterial species and can therefore be used for bacterial identification. Large databases of the sequences of these genes are now available. For eukaryotes, the 18S rRNA gene has also been used as a 'universal' gene and there is an increasing number of 18S rRNA sequences in databases11. By contrast, there is no common gene for the detection of all viruses, although PCR targets have been developed for virus families, such as the herpesviridae12.",

Different gene sequences enable different levels of identification. Depending on the gene that is used, the genus, species, subspecies or even strain of an organism can be established. When it is crucial to determine whether one or more clinical isolates are of the same strain, a comparison of several genome sequences might be required. Such studies have identified highly variable genome fragments and have led to the development of several techniques, including MULTILOCUS SEQUENCE TYPING13. Similar identification tools have also been developed for fungi14 and protozoa15. Other sequence-based typing techniques have used intergenic, non-coding spacer sequences16 that are more likely to be variable. The one that has been the most widely used is the 16S\u201323S intergenic spacer for bacteria16 and the INTERNAL TRANSCRIBED SPACER (ITS) for fungi17. Specific, fully automated bioinformatics tools, such as BIBI (Bioinformatics Bacterial Identification)20, identify microorganisms by combining sequence databases and phylogeny-display programmes.",

The development of molecular beacons and other fluorescent probes (such as the TaqMan\u00ae probe that is produced by Roche Molecular Systems, Inc.) has made real-time monitoring of PCR amplification and quantification of nucleic acids in clinical specimens possible21. Beacons are hairpin-shaped oligonucleotide probes that have a fluorophore that emits photons and is closely associated with a quencher, which absorbs the photons. In the presence of a complementary strand of DNA, the hairpin structure unfolds and fluorescence is emitted, and this can be measured to determine the amount of DNA that is present. Multiple targets can be monitored22 using fluorophores with different emission spectra. This technology, which is highly sensitive, is commercially available as the TaqMan\u00ae (Applied Biosystems; Perkin-Elmer Corp.) and LightCycler (Roche Diagnostics Corp.) systems. The advantages of real-time PCR are the rapidity of the assay (30\u201340 min), the ability to quantify and identify PCR products directly without the use of agarose gels, and the fact that contamination of the nucleic acids can be limited. Kits are available for the detection and quantification of DNA and RNA in clinical samples, and the technique has been specifically developed to enable the follow-up of patients with HIV and hepatitis C infections (Amplitech AME Bioscience; Bayer Diagnostics; Roche Diagnostics).",

Assays with the ability to detect specific antibodies against several pathogens simultaneously have a wide application in the diagnosis of infectious diseases27,28. The indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) is commonly used to detect antibodies to infectious agents29 as it is easy to use, sensitive and specific. Recently, protein arrays have been used to develop comparative fluorescence assays to measure the concentrations of specific proteins and antibodies in complex solutions30. The lack of stability of fluorescent dyes is no longer a problem with the use of new-generation Alexa Fluor\u00ae dyes (Molecular Probes), which are available in several emission colours and allow multiple stainings of the same spot. Specific fluorescence is detected by confocal scanning microscopy and is quantified using internal calibration curves. The dyes have enabled the development of prototypes of antigenic microarrays to detect antibodies in human sera that are specific for one or several pathogens. An antigen microarray for Lyme disease has been described31. Similarly, a microarray with specific antigens of Toxoplasma gondii, cytomegalovirus, herpesvirus 1 and 2 and rubella virus gave favourable results when used to detect reactive immunoglobulin G32. Such pioneering studies provide evidence that antigen-microarray analysis could become an important diagnostic tool. The technique will enable IFAs to be standardized and inter-operator and inter-laboratory variation will be minimized. It will also be possible to digitalize IFA photographs, which will enable them to be stored and exchanged more easily.",

The molecular identification of bacteria can be based on the sequencing of the universal 16S rRNA gene34, which is a two-day task (including culture time) that can only be performed using pure cultures of bacteria. Mass-spectrometry analysis of base-specific fragmentation patterns of PCR-amplified DNA has recently been studied as a technique for the rapid identification of bacterial isolates and for the detection of specific 16S rRNA gene fragments that are amplified from complex environmental samples35. In this study, 300 base pairs were determined, and the technique shows promise of becoming the standard method for identification of pathogens, strain typing and determination of mutations that are associated with resistance in bacteria and viruses.",

The indirect diagnosis of infectious diseases by the detection of specific antibodies will continue to be a key approach for clinical microbiologists. Both individual, ready-to-use assays that would be available in the doctor's surgery and platform tests for high-throughput screening and diagnosis could be developed. 'At-doctor' serology tests would be useful for the rapid determination of the status of a patient and for speedy decision-making regarding post-exposure prophylaxis and treatment. In addition, the rapid detection of specific IgMs during epidemics could help to improve isolation measures for patients who are suspected to be infected. Antigenic microarrays will enable testing for several pathogens in parallel using little serum and few reagents. All the pathogens that are known to be causative agents of a particular clinical syndrome could therefore be tested for simultaneously using an antigenic microarray. Moreover, the versatility of this new assay will allow emerging pathogens to be quickly incorporated into the test. Future developments in antigenic microarray technology will include the development of automation for the indirect diagnosis of infectious diseases. The microarray apparatus could be fully automated up to the result output; generation of output would be rapid, as the overall process will probably take less than 2 hours, and automated microarrays could test several parameters simultaneously (for example, testing for antigens and different classes of antibody), thus allowing pathology-driven testing instead of the pathogen-driven testing that is carried out at present. As several antigens can be tested for simultaneously, this development will lead to a severalfold decrease in labour time and, consequently, a reduction in cost. These automated microarrays will be suitable both for mass screening of sera in epidemiology studies and in blood banks, and for diagnostics that are carried out on single serum samples in clinical microbiology laboratories.",

Requests for laboratory tests to diagnose infectious diseases depend largely on the knowledge of the physicians who are caring for patients. As a result, there is considerable variability in the appropriateness of the samples submitted and, therefore, in the accuracy of the resulting laboratory diagnoses. For example, the standardization of sampling for infectious endocarditis (for which three blood cultures and serological testing are required for diagnosis) could dramatically reduce the number of culture-negative endocarditis patients72. In diseases such as pneumonia and meningoencephalitis, the number of known aetiological agents is increasing and depends on many epidemiological factors. The identification of aetiological agents should benefit from the use of versatile diagnostic tools.",

To optimize diagnostic efficiency, a possible strategy would be to sample by syndrome \u2014 for example, nosocomial pneumonia, endocarditis, infectious arthritis, meningoencephalitis, uveitis or fever on return from tropical areas. Such a strategy should be based on an extensive review of the international literature that identifies the potential aetiologies of a given syndrome. The most appropriate clinical samples and laboratory tests could be deduced from this information, and diagnostic kits could be developed for each syndrome. This strategy would enable a rational search for aetiological agents, limit the use of unnecessary tests and improve the cost-effectiveness of diagnosis. Another advantage of such a strategy is that it could be coupled to a versatile diagnostic method that enables the identification of a large panel of microorganisms. Such versatile methods are available for culture, molecular detection (with broad-range standardized PCR assays), FCM detection assays and broad-range microarrays.",

            "text": "Digital pictures. A key development in clinical microbiology has been in the technology that is available to produce digital pictures, which enables image libraries to be established and readily exchanged. This includes pictures taken during clinical examinations when cutaneous signs are present, light-, confocal- and electron-microscopy pictures, and images of microarray analyses. Although it is still rare, microbiology reports can be enhanced with digital images of the organisms that are involved. The inclusion of digital photographs of Gram-stain and acid-fast-stain preparations is technically possible, and precedents for providing such images have already been set by current pathology and radiology information systems. Picture digitalization enables information to be sent instantly by e-mail. The feasibility of using static-image telepathology to assess Gram-stained microbiological preparations has been evaluated positively, although the selection of informative microscopic fields before their transmission was a prerequisite for success73. A major application of these images is that they can be used to obtain expert advice. This is of particular importance with P3 emerging and re-emerging agents and with group A and B agents of bioterrorism. In such cases, microbial agents must be confined in secure laboratories, but their digital images can be freely exchanged. The e-mailing of digital pictures was recently helpful in the management of patients with suspected smallpox or anthrax. In a patient presenting with multiple haemorrhagic vesicles on the face, anonymous digital pictures of the clinical features were e-mailed to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to obtain an expert opinion74 and the usefulness of such pictures was emphasized during the SARS outbreak73. In addition, appropriate microbiology pictures can be e-mailed to clinicians for incorporation into the patient's medical records.",

The ongoing technological revolution has rapidly transformed research, diagnostic and therapeutic tools. However, there is still a requirement for the reliability and the standardization of sampling and biological testing to be increased as information is exchanged internationally. In future, the organization of clinical microbiology laboratories will probably follow that of other areas of the life sciences \u2014 that is, with large centralized laboratories and a local head. The position and the role of experts in clinical microbiology processes will become an important question. The interpretation of diagnostic tests can require different levels of expertise. The predictive value of a test depends on its intrinsic quality and on the prevalence of the disease in the population. Therefore, the final interpretation relies on both the microbiologist and the physician. In some instances, the indications of the clinical and epidemiological data to the laboratory will make it possible for a diagnosis to be made. In other cases, communication of the intrinsic values of the test (for example, sensitivity and specificity) might allow an infectious-disease specialist to make a diagnosis on-site (Fig. 1).",
