Another swine enteric virus, porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), was firstly discovered from healthy pig herds by a research team of Hong Kong in 2012 when they did a molecular epidemiology study in 3137 mammals and 3519 birds (Woo et al. 2012). Two years later, this virus was reported to cause severe diarrhea and/or vomiting and atrophic enteritis in the USA (Wang et al. 2014) and later on in China (Song et al. 2015). Subsequently, a novel porcine enteric alphacoronavirus PEAV was discovered in 2017 from some pig farms located in Southern China, causing more than 24,000 piglets\u2019 death (Gong et al. 2017). This virus was also named as SeACoV (Pan et al. 2017) or SADS-CoV (Zhou et al. 2018b) by the other research groups.",

Swine enteric coronaviruses are the most significant pathogens causing diarrhea in piglets, especially for newborn piglets (Butler et al. 2014). All swine enteric coronaviruses, including traditional PEDV, TGEV, and newly emerged PDCoV, PEAV, could cause serious diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, weight loss, and up to 100% death in suckling piglets (Gong et al. 2017; Hsu et al. 2018). Previously, some investigators developed a serial of ELISA assays to detect PEDV, TGEV, or PDCoV infections based on M, N proteins or whole virus (Luo et al. 2017; Ma et al. 2016; Su et al. 2016). However, molecular diagnostic tools, rather than serological methods, for swine enteric coronaviruses are urgently needed due to their similar and high pathogenicity to suckling piglets, lacking a mature immune system. For swine enteric coronavirus detection, conventional RT-PCR, multiplex RT-qPCR, or pan-coronaviruses RT-PCR methods targeting M, N, S, or polymerase genes were developed in recent years (Hsu et al. 2018; Song et al. 2006). Additionally, Zhou et al. (2018a) recently reported a specific real-time PCR for the detection of PEAV. To our knowledge, there was no such method that could simultaneously detect and differentiate TGEV, PEDV, PDCoV, and PEAV from the same detection vial. To solve this urgent and important issue, we developed this multiplex real-time RT-qPCR for the detection and differential diagnosis of the swine enteric coronaviruses circulating in pig herds.",

Co-infection of swine enteric coronaviruses may cause recombination between co-infected viruses. During 2012 and 2016, some new swine enteric coronaviruses were generated by recombination with PEDV and TGEV and spread across the central Eastern European countries (Akimkin et al. 2016; Belsham et al. 2016; Boniotti et al. 2016). The recombination might create more virulent enteric virus strains or new viruses, leading to potential outbreaks or pandemics of swine viral diarrhea. Additionally, co-infections may promote the evolution of non-pathogenic enteric viruses into high virulent and pathogenic viruses. A recent example showed the existence of PDCoV in pig herds for many years in China mainland and Hong Kong but without observed clinical symptoms (Pan et al. 2017; Woo et al. 2012). Unfortunately, this virus caused severe outbreaks in some states of the USA since 2014 (Ma et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2014). This virulence change was most probably caused by the previous exposure to PEDV or other co-infected swine enteric viruses. Therefore, swine enteric coronaviruses co-infection may bring risks for the prevention and control of swine diarrhea.",
