There is clearly a need for better links between public health records and addressing databases [21], as shown by the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The SARS outbreak also motivates one of the topics of this paper, the issues involved in understanding the addressing systems in different countries. Further information on the different addressing systems in more than 193 countries can be found in The Global Sourcebook of Address Data Management [20].",

This observation indicates that, while using the same addressing system with the same kinds of address-based location procedures, the quality of the results may suffice for some applications, but may be inadequate for others. Locating precisely each provided address in a short time is essential for emergency dispatching, while an epidemiologist may be content if each West Nile virus case is located only well enough for it to be associated with a reasonably small spatial unit, such as a Census tract. Thus, in this paper, we introduce a measurement to evaluate the degree of certainty associated with geocoding, i.e., the location of events or phenomena using addresses. This measurement, which we call Geocoding Certainty Indicator (GCI), shows how certain can the user be as to the actual position of the geocoded event. The resulting GCI can be used as a threshold for a filter, to leave out less reliable data, or as a weight, allowing the user to take the uncertainty into consideration during the spatial analysis process.1\n",

The schema also extends the notion of postal address to something broader, including popular names for places, building names, reference places, and other concepts. This approach extends Simpson\u2019s and Yu\u2019s [25] work on postal codes to records of any kind, including place names and loosely formatted addresses.",

There are variations in which the numbering is sequential but block-oriented (for instance, assigning and distributing 100 numbers to a block), though the numbering is not distance-oriented. The metric system has the advantage of allowing an easy approximation of the distance between two addresses in the same street, while allowing for simple adaptation to new developments along each street. Similarly, some cities have a street naming (or numbering) which allows for a quick estimation as to the distance between two addresses.",

The Japanese system, for instance, does not assign addresses according to consecutive numbers along a road, but numbers the houses according to their date of construction [15]. Most streets actually have no name at all, and, therefore, business cards typically show small maps printed on the back to indicate the location of a place. In Korea, numbers are assigned inside neighborhoods (called dong) within urban sectors (called gu), a hierarchy of areas that are named, not numbered [4]. In Kyoto, Japan, the Digital City project has been conceived with this kind of limitation in mind: a map-based user interface facilitates the location of points of interest for tourists and locals alike, since the addressing system seems to be too complicated to navigate without detailed mapping information [13].",

Postal codes work as both a shorthand for the hierarchy of places and a redundant item, against which other elements can be checked.\nLinear references: Used in the identification of places along roads or railways, are formed by a distance along a linear feature, considering a conventional start point (\u201cmile marker 129, U.S. Route 66\u201d) or by a distance from a given point (\u201c100 km from the Mexican border, along Highway 123\u201d) [24].\nPlace names or toponyms: Names of known places, either natural or man-made (such as buildings), usually context-dependent, used by people by themselves or as landmarks. Examples: \u201cthe Eiffel Tower,\u201d \u201cManhattan.\u201d\nComposite addresses: Place indications composed by a place name and some complementary information, such as distance and/or direction, from which to indicate the location of something nearby, or by the combination of two or more place names. Example: \u201cat the corner of Oak St. and First Avenue.\u201dDepending on the type of address used, an accurate position can or cannot be obtained. Many of the addressing types express a rather general position, and are used with the intention of providing a rough idea about some location.

For now, we consider the following set of concepts on addressing: \n\nThoroughfare. A named public space, usually associated with the concept of a passage within a city; a generic concept including the notions of street, avenue, plaza, square, road, alley, lane, and boulevard (thoroughfare types).\nThoroughfare name. The name officially or popularly associated with a thoroughfare, which is usually characterized also by the thoroughfare type.\nCrossing. The location at which two or more thoroughfares meet (crossroads, street crossing).\nBuilding number. The number used to identify a building at a thoroughfare. Does not include the identification of property units within a building, such as apartment, room, office, suite, unit, floor or others (complement).\nCity sector. A named division of a municipality\u2019s territory, recognizable by people as a definite place or region (alternative names: subdivision, district, borough, or gu in Korea); may include several neighborhoods.\nNeighborhood. A subdivision of a municipality\u2019s territory, within which dwellers might consider themselves to be neighbors. Neighborhoods are named, often after the real estate development project from which they were created (alternative names: region, or dong in Korea)\nCity. A collection of human dwellings, an urban area. Depending on the size and local custom, it may assume different denominations (village, town, metropolis, municipality).\nState. A region of a country (mainly in the federal system), usually ruled by a regional government, comprising several municipal areas.\nPostal Code. An alphanumeric code used by postal authorities to facilitate the sorting of mail in preparation for its distribution by a mail carrier.\nLandmark. A place whose name is well known by the population, usually serving for routing or orientation. Landmarks include human constructions (e.g., buildings, stadiums, monuments, and bridges) as well as distinct natural landmarks (e.g., Niagara Falls, Matterhorn).With these basic notions in mind, we define the concept of an address as follows:\nAddress. A description, including the names and any complementary pieces of information, which allows someone to uniquely identify a place.Therefore, addresses are formed by combining these basic elements, provided there are enough elements to determine a unique location. The exact elements that are used to compose an address, along with the sequence and arrangement of these elements in the description, vary around the world.",

We obviously did not choose postal addresses based on a P.O. box or the like, since we are interested in the actual structure of each address and in the place names contained in them. Table 2 shows the same addresses, separating their basic components, according to our model (thoroughfare type, thoroughfare name, building number, building name, neighborhood, city, state, country, postal code, and complement). In this compilation, no address includes all of these components and no component is used by all addresses. Names of famous places are employed as addresses: for instance, the Mexican branch of Greenpeace is located at a street or avenue named Andalucia, which is also the name of a Spanish region. Such ambiguities make current Web search engines inefficient when we attempt to locate pages that refer to specific geographic locations [2].

The resulting tokens are then analyzed sequentially, in an attempt to determine the function of each one of them. The analysis of each token can use the addressing database, if it is necessary to establish hypotheses as to what is the correct interpretation of each term (token) in the address. In this process, the gazetteer defined in the addressing database schema can be helpful. Through the use of the gazetteer, and by scanning the template in order, it is possible to decide the adequate interpretation on situations in which the same name is related, for instance, to a municipality and to a state (for instance, \u201cS\u00e3o Paulo\u201d in Brazil is both a city and a state, and possibly the name of many streets all over the country). This approach contrasts with the parsing of free-form text for information retrieval (IR) [1], since in that case the intention is mostly to obtain context information by analyzing the presence, sequencing and frequency of keywords. The techniques we implemented contain a mix of language parsing with information retrieval parsing.",

Spelling problems can be countered using approximate string matching algorithms, such as Levenshtein distance [19] and Shift-And [28]. Soundex-like procedures can also be used, but we decided against including them in our implementation, based on the results presented in [30], and on our perception that phonetic methods would be best employed if source data were primarily in English, without many personal names or foreign words, which is clearly not the case of addressing data. Approximate string matching algorithms are able to find matches even when there are differences, such as missing characters, inverted characters, or extraneous characters, between the given string and the matching pattern. These algorithms are adapted to multilingual support, by granting the equivalence between accented characters and their canonical counterparts (for instance, \u201c\u00e1\u201d and \u201c\u00e4\u201d are considered equivalent to \u201ca\u201d for approximate matching purposes). If multiple matches result from this process, additional information must be used, when available. For instance, if there are two streets with the same name in given city (a common situation in developing countries), the neighborhood name or the postal code can be used to select a single result. If this is impossible, for any reason, we consider that the matching has failed. The matching also fails if no match is found with the available data.",

The indicator, which has a minimum value of 0 (completely uncertain) and a maximum value of 1 (absolutely certain), is calculated from partial indicators that are determined during the parsing, matching and locating phases. The indicator values, as well as the values of its components, can be used in various situations. We emphasized here the possibility of filtering the data by establishing a GCI threshold, but it is also possible to include the GCI value in the analysis process, as a sort of weighting factor. GCI can also be used as a ranking criterion in geographic information retrieval procedures that use addresses as spatial references.",
