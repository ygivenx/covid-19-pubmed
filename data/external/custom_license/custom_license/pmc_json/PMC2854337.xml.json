Since 2003, about 450 cases of avian influenza A (H5N1) infection in humans have been reported in 15 countries, mainly in Southeast Asia [2]. In the study reported here, we have attempted to predict the effectiveness of intervention strategies against an epidemic of a novel influenza that will be caused by new strains of influenza achieving the same transmission ability in humans as avian influenza A (H5N1) by simulating various scenarios targeting Sapporo city, the capital of Hokkaido in Japan, with a population of about 1.9 million. Influenza A (H1N1), which is a new flu virus of swine origin, was first detected in Mexico in March 2009 [3] and has spread rapidly across the globe. A total of 209,438 cases of influenza A (H1N1) infection in over 170 countries, including 2,185 deaths, had been officially reported by late August 2009 [4]. The Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare of Japan [5] designed a \u201cPandemic Influenza Preparedness Action Plan\u201d which, among other measures, includes the administration of antiviral drugs and school closure in the case of an influenza pandemic.",

To this end, we constructed an IBM for the transmission of a novel influenza virus in Sapporo city that takes personal information, such as age, household, habitation, social activity group, casual contact group, and behavioral patterns, into account, thereby resulting in a more realistic model. A series of interventions were explored: (1) targeted antiviral prophylaxis (TAP) through prescribing antiviral drugs for symptomatic patients and persons in close contact with them; (2) school-age targeted antiviral prophylaxis (STAP) by prescribing antiviral drugs for school-aged children; (3) school closure; (4) restraint.",

The combination of three interventions\u2014TAP, school closure, and restraint\u2014would decrease the number of total patients to 0.02% of that with a no-intervention situation and would be highly effective in suppressing infection. In comparison, although the combination of TAP with only school closure or restraint would have some degree of effectiveness in reducing the number of patients, this strategy would be unable to shorten the epidemic period. The results of this study will be helpful in planning intervention strategies against a future influenza pandemic.",

The illness attack rate of swine flu A (H1N1) virus has been reported to be twice as high in children as in adults [21]. A study of the sporadic transmissions of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus from birds to humans revealed that children are more susceptible to this virus than adults [2]. Because the age-specific illness attack rate of avian influenza A (H5N1) was similar to that of \u201cAsian flu\u201d A (H2N2) [22], this model adopted the estimated values in the \u201cAsian flu\u201d [10] as the age-specific illness attack rate. The mortality in \u201cSpanish flu\u201d A (H1N1) in 1918\u20131919 showed a W-shaped curve, i.e., it was high not among infants and elderly people but also among young adults (25\u201334 years), an age group which usually has a very low mortality with seasonal influenza [23, 24]. Although the profile for a future influenza pandemic is unclear, we assumed that a novel influenza infection would cause a high mortality similar to the situation of the \u201cSpanish flu\u201d A (H1N1) [24]. The age-specific illness attack and mortality rates in this model are presented in Table 1.",

Antiviral efficacy lasts only during the course, and no residual effect remains thereafter. The administration of antiviral drugs alleviates symptoms, reduces infectiveness, shortens the infectious period as a treatment effect, and also prevents infection as a prophylactical effect [26, 27]. Longini et al. [10] estimated the effects of administering the antiviral drugs that were also adopted in this model and found: (1) the illness attack rate in susceptible persons dosed with antiviral drugs for prophylaxis decreased to 0.30 on average compared with those without dosing (relative susceptibility = 0.30); (2) the probability of developing symptoms of influenza in infected persons dosed with antiviral drugs for prophylaxis decreased to 0.60 on average compared with those without dosing; (3) the infectiousness of infected persons dosed with antiviral drugs for treatment or prophylaxis decreased to 0.62 on average compared with those without dosing (relative infectiousness = 0.62); (4) the infectious period in infected persons dosed with antiviral drugs for treatment or prophylaxis was reduce to 1 day compared with those without dosing.",

There are also many commuters to school and work between wards during the daytime, which leads to the mass movement of people on a daily basis [28]. To simulate the situations of an influenza epidemic on a realistic basis, we adopted an IBM that can reflect the heterogeneous population structure for the targeted area, in which each individual was assigned his/her personal information, such as age, household, residence district, social activity group, and casual contact group. The age structure in Sapporo city [28] is shown in Fig. 1.

The average contact rate in a playgroup was set to be higher than that in other social activity groups because children spent more time in close proximity to each other at a day nursery. The usual average contact rate in the low-risk casual contact group was set to be quite low because such contacts occur accidentally during outings [12]. On the other hand, the average contact rate in high-risk casual contact groups, such as while commuting on crowded trains or buses, was assumed to be 30-fold higher than that in the low-risk casual contact group. This was assessed by the average commuting time to school and work (an hour per day) [33]. The average contact rates for every group are tabulated in Table 2. Because it is difficult for symptomatic patients to follow their usual behavioral pattern [34], it was assumed that a symptomatic patient had a different behavioral pattern from the day after onset; a symptomatic patient retreats to the home, thereby exposing only his/her family [35].",

However, it is actually difficult to implement school closure for such a long period, as was assumed in this model, where closure would be continued until no further patients were detected in the ward. Therefore, the effectiveness of school closure may be overestimated. In the outbreak of swine flu A (H1N1) in Japan in 2009, it was reported that the rapid spread of infection disrupted medical institutions [36]. Implementing a policy of school closure and restraint may be one approach to preventing an acute disruption of services at medical institutions. However, school closure also brings about the long-term absence of parents from work, which leads to economic loss [40]. The importance of restraint was recognized by only 46.2% citizens in Japan and the loss of precautions against infection may spread rapidly providing that a novel influenza infection has a low mortality [37]; therefore improved recognition of the necessity of restraint is needed.",

It resulted in a average decrease in total patients to 0.02% of that of the baseline scenario because of concomitantly preventing the spread of infection at an early stage by prophylaxis and decreasing infection risk by school closure and restraint. On the other hand, the combination of prophylaxis with antiviral drugs (TAP/STAP) with either school closure or restraint would reduce the amount of patients to some extent but would not be able to shorten the epidemic period because the influenza infection would be spread among people, unlike the combination of prophylaxis with both school closure and restraint.",

Moreover, it may be difficult to identify persons in close contact. It has been reported that the spread of the infections made it difficult for doctors to diagnose swine flu A (H1N1) cases and that it was also hard to trace persons in close contact during this outbreak [36]. In contrast, STAP is easy to implement because antiviral drugs are distributed only at schools, although STAP does have a weak ripple effect due to drug wastage. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the methods of distribution in STAP, such as its range and frequency.",
