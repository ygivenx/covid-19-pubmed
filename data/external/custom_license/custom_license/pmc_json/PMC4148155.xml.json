For the best part of the last century, Dengue virus has been\nthe most prevalent arbovirus affecting the human population. Once\nrestricted to the tropics and subtropics, it is now spreading to previously\nunaffected zones, owing to the dispersion of its vectors, Aedes spp., driven by several factors, among them an ever-increasing\nglobal temperature and widespread traveling. Apart from that, the\nfact that the last year there were over 390 million estimated cases,2 DENV is becoming a serious threat to public health.\nAlthough the most common clinical manifestations are asymptomatic\nor mild fevers that can be tackled with well-equipped hospitals, there\nare two other serious life threatening situations with mortality rates\nsurpassing 20% if left unattended.3 The\nfact that more than 40% of the world population lives in regions where\nDengue vectors thrive, leaving close to 3 billion people at risk in\nthe world, should not be overlooked.4 Although\nseveral compounds have been identified to inhibit DENV replication,5 there is actually no clinical treatment for its\ninfection.",

Leakage elicited\nby peptide 5 was remarkable in the presence of liver liposomes, since\na leakage value of about 45% was observed (Figure 2G). Lower but significant values were found for liposomes\ncontaining BMP (about 18%, Figure 2C) and ER-like\nmembranes (about 10%, Figure 2F). Leakage values\nelicited by peptides 18\u201329 were lower than that observed with\npeptide 5, oscillating between 10 and 20%. Apart from these differences,\nleakage induction was consistent throughout all liposome compositions\nused (Figure 2). Interestingly, peptide 5 overlaps\nregion b and peptides 18\u201329 overlap regions f, g, h, and i.\nPeptide 5 would be defined by a significant leakage value concurrent\nwith high hydrophobicity and interfaciality (see above) and therefore\nwould partition extensively to the membrane interface.31",

Incorporation of dens25 into DMPC at\na lipid/peptide ratio of 10:1 elicited no noticeable effect on the\nthermotropic behavior of the pure phospholipid, neither at low nor\nat high ionic strength (Figure 5A and B, respectively).\nIn contrast, the main transition of pure DMPG at 25 mM NaCl was apparently\ncomposed of two different peaks, which should be due to mixed phases\n(Figure 5C). Incorporation of peptide dens25\ninduced a significant lowering of the cooperativity of the transition,\nbut no apparent changes to the number of peaks were clearly visible\n(Figure 5C). In the presence of 100 mM NaCl,\nthe main transition of pure DMPG was composed of only one peak, as\nexpected, showing a large cooperativity (Figure 5D). When dens25 was incorporated into the membrane, a broad main\ntransition peak was observed, indicating a significant lowering in\ncooperativity (Figure 5D). The pattern observed\nat 300 mM NaCl for pure DMPG was similar to the one found at 100 mM\nNaCl, since only one very cooperative peak was observed (Figure 5E and D, respectively). The addition of peptide\ndens25 lowered the cooperativity of the main transition, but the width\nat 300 mM NaCl was narrower than that at 100 mM, indicating that an\nincrease of NaCl concentration induced an increase in the cooperativity\nof its transition (Figure 5D and E). In the\ncase of DMPS, a similar pattern was visible. In the presence of 25\nmM NaCl, peptide dens25 induced a significant decrease in cooperativity\nin DMPS if compared to the pure lipid sample (Figure 5F), whereas in the presence of 100 mM NaCl the peptide barely\naffected the main transition of the phospholipid (Figure 5G). In the presence of 25 mM NaCl, 14BMP, a negatively\ncharged phospholipid, presented two low-enthalpy peaks and one high-enthalpy\npeak (Figure 5H). In the presence of dens25,\ntwo peaks were observed, a low-enthalpy peak and a high-enthalpy one,\nthe latter displaced to lower temperatures when compared to the pure\nlipid. In the presence of 100 mM NaCl, 14BMP presented a normal pattern,\ni.e., a low-enthalpy peak and a high-enthalpy peak corresponding to\nthe Lc1\u2013Lc2 and Lc2\u2013L\u03b1 transitions (Figure 5I). Apart\nfrom abolishing the low-enthalpy peak, peptide dens25 did not exert\nany other significant effect on the high-enthalpy high-temperature\npeak (Figure 5I). These DSC data would suggest\nthat peptide dens25 affects more significantly the phase transition\nof negatively charged phospholipids in the absence of salt, an effect\nthat is significantly increased when the ionic strength is reduced;\ni.e., the less salt concentration, the bigger the effect dens25 has\non negatively charged phospholipids.",

The frequency maximum of the ester C=O band of pure\nDMPC in the presence of 25 mM NaCl had two transitions, one at about\n17 \u00b0C and the other at about 23 \u00b0C, coincident with the\npretransition and main gel to liquid crystalline phase transition\nof the pure phospholipid (Figure 6A). When\ndens25 was present, the frequency of the ester C=O band of\nDMPC displayed only one transition at about 24 \u00b0C (Figure 6A). Nonetheless, its frequency maximum was higher\nin the presence of the peptide than in its absence, suggesting that\nthe peptide increased the intensity of the 1743 cm\u20131 component relative to the 1727 cm\u20131 one; i.e.,\nthe quantity of non-hydrogen-bonded C=O ester bands increased\nin the presence of dens25.61,62 In the presence of\n100 mM NaCl, a relatively similar pattern was found for DMPC (Figure 6B). The frequency maximum of the ester C=O\nband of the pure phospholipid displayed two transitions at about 16\nand 24 \u00b0C, i.e., the pretransition and the main phase transition\n(Figure 6A). In the presence of the peptide,\nthe frequency of the ester C=O band displayed two transitions,\na broad one at about 16 \u00b0C and a narrow one at 24 \u00b0C. As\nbefore, its absolute frequency was higher in the presence of dens25\nthan in its absence; however, it was not as high as it was found in\nthe presence of 25 mM NaCl (compare parts A and B of Figure 6). The frequency maximum of the ester C=O\nband of pure DMPG in the presence of 25 mM NaCl displayed two transitions,\na broad one at about 14 \u00b0C and a narrow one at 23 \u00b0C, coincident\nwith the pretransition and main phase transition of the pure phospholipid\nin accordance with the DSC data (Figure 6C).\nNoteworthy is the result that the frequency of the ester C=O\nband of DMPG in the presence of dens25 displayed no transition at\nall in the temperature range studied (Figure 6C). In the presence of 100 mM NaCl, the frequency maximum of the\nester C=O band of pure DMPG displayed two transitions, a broad\none at about 14 \u00b0C and a relatively cooperative one at 22 \u00b0C,\ncoincident with the pre- and main transition of the pure phospholipid\n(Figure 6C). In the presence of the dens25\npeptide, the frequency of the ester C=O band displayed only\na broad transition at about 24 \u00b0C, in accordance with the calorimetric\ndata (Figure 6D). Its absolute frequency was\nhigher in the presence of the peptide than in its absence but at temperatures\nhigher than the main transition (Figure 6D).\nAll these data would suggest that dens25 affects the phase transition\nof DMPG, a negatively charged phospholipid, but not that of DMPC,\na zwitterionic one, in the presence of relatively low concentrations\nof NaCl. Conversely, the interaction of peptide dens25 with DMPG is\nabolished at relatively high salt concentrations.",

The infrared amide I\u2032 spectra of fully\nhydrated dens25 in the presence of DMPC and 25 mM NaCl below and above\nthe lipid\u2019s main phase transition temperature are shown in\nFigure 6A. At both temperatures, the amide\nI\u2032 band presented two bands appearing at about 1623 and 1648\ncm\u20131, the former with relative lower intensity than\nthe latter. The bands at about 1623 and 1648 cm\u20131 arise from the presence of aggregated \u03b2 structures and mainly\nunordered and helical structures, respectively.63,64 Upon data fitting, the relative intensity of the 1648 cm\u20131 band was about 73% and about 27% for the 1623 cm\u20131 band. In the presence of 100 mM NaCl and below and above the main\ntransition of the phospholipid, the amide I\u2032 band of dens25\npresented a similar pattern, i.e., two bands at about 1648 and 1623\ncm\u20131, with relative intensities of 68 and 32%, respectively\n(Figure 6B). The infrared amide I\u2032 spectra\nof fully hydrated dens25 in the presence of DMPG and 25 mM NaCl below\nand above the main phase transition of the phospholipid are shown\nin Figure 6C. In this case and in contrast\nto the DMPC sample, the amide I\u2032 band of dens25 presented two\nbands with slightly different frequencies. These two bands have a\nmaximum at about 1653 and 1626 cm\u20131, and their relative\nintensities were about 85 and about 15%, respectively (Figure 6C). When 100 mM NaCl, both below and above the main\ntransition of the phospholipid, the amide I\u2032 band of dens25\npresented two bands, but their frequencies were slightly different\nthan in the presence of 25 mM NaCl, about 1648 and 1622 cm\u20131 (Figure 6D). In this case, the relative intensities\nof these two bands were also different, since it was found that they\nwere 68 and 32%, respectively. From this picture, it is quite obvious\nthat, in the presence of DMPG and at low NaCl concentration, the secondary\nstructure of dens25 is different from that at high NaCl concentration,\nand this one presents a similar pattern to that found in the presence\nof DMPC at both low and high salt concentration. Although aggregated\nstructures and helical and disordered structures are present in all\nsamples, the quantity of aggregated \u03b2 structures diminished\ndramatically; i.e., the relative amount of either helical or disordered\nor both increased in the presence of DMPG, a negatively charged phospholipid,\nand a low salt concentration.",

Significantly, the interaction of dens25 seemed\nto be of an electrostatic nature: the data indicated that the effect\nwas inversely proportional to the salt concentration in the medium.\nCalorimetric experiments further corroborated these results, with\npeptide dens25 affecting more significantly the phase transition of\nmembranes containing negatively charged phospholipids in the absence\nof salt, an effect that was significantly reduced when the ionic strength\nwas increased; i.e., the less salt concentration, the bigger the effect\ndens25 has on negatively charged phospholipids. These results were\nalso corroborated by the infrared analysis of the ester C=O\nstretching carbonyl band of the lipids. In the presence of low salt\nconcentrations, dens25 affected the phase transition of the negatively\ncharged molecule, DMPG, but not the zwitterionic one, DMPC. This interaction\nwas abolished when the peptide was in the presence of increased salt\nconcentrations.",

However, the relative proportion\nof secondary structures varied depending on phospholipid type and\nsalt concentration. In the presence of DMPG and at low NaCl concentration,\nthe secondary structure of dens25 was different from that at high\nNaCl concentration, and this one was similar to that found in the\npresence of DMPC at both low and high salt concentration. Although\naggregated structures and helical and disordered structures were present\nin all samples, the quantity of aggregated \u03b2 structures diminished\ndramatically; i.e., the relative amount of either helical or disordered\nor both increased if negative lipids were present and the salt concentration\nwas kept at low levels. The secondary structure of the dens25 peptide\nwas thus affected by its binding to the membrane, as it has been suggested\nfor other peptides.53,65 Concomitantly, differences in\nthe frequency of the carbonyl band of the phospholipids were observed,\nshowing that peptide binding modulates phospholipid conformation.",
