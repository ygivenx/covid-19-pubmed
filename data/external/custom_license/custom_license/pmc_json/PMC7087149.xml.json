Usually, these systems are based mainly on nationally organized sentinel networks of physicians, covering at least 1 to 5 % of the population in their countries, and on hospital reports of clinically suspected or laboratory-confirmed influenza cases [5]. In Portugal, the National Influenza Surveillance Programme aims to collect, analyze, and disseminate information on influenza activity, identifying and characterizing influenza virus in circulation in each season, as well as performing the identification of emerging viruses with pandemic potential that pose a risk to public health. In this way, it seeks to contribute to decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with infection and its complications. The data from the National Influenza Surveillance Programme also allow orientation for prevention and control of influenza. The surveillance programme integrates the clinical and virological component enabling: (1) to estimate the morbidity of the disease through determining the weekly incidence rates of influenza-like illness and identification of outbreaks in population under observation; (2) identify and characterize the virus influenza strains circulating and quantify their presence in the population under observation, during the period of influenza activity; (3) through the information gathered and after its evaluation, promote intervention at health services in actions for prevention and therapy advising. The information and biological samples for laboratorial diagnosis came from the general practitioner network and from emergency units that are located in Portugal mainland, Azores and Madeira islands [10, 16].",

This direct approach to the population could also avoid some bias on the registry, since medical consultations will probably receive more serious cases and are also very dependent on parental anxiety.",

One of the key points of this project was the study of the role of viral respiratory infections at day care center level, particularly influenza. To accomplish this, the study included parents\u2019 phone contact to the research team whenever a child had symptoms of respiratory infection, in order to collect respiratory samples for virology analysis. The main objective of this study was to test the compliance of the parents to this report system and to see if this strategy would improve the detection, in preschool children, during epidemic periods, when compared with current surveillance systems for influenza. The detection of other circulating respiratory viruses was the second objective of the study.",

In these open sessions, a brief review of the importance of the respiratory infections in children was provided, with a special emphasis on the epidemiology of influenza infections. Parents were invited to participate in the study by calling to the ENVIRH team (a free call by a dedicated line) whenever their children presented at least two of the following clinical signs: fever, wheezing, cough, or nasal congestion. Parents\u2019 informed consents were obtained, and the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Nova Medical School, Lisbon.

Primer and probe sequences and concentrations for multiplex panels 2 to 4 and for the monoplex bocavirus assay are available on request from the authors. Amplification reactions and detection of PCR products were performed using the Rotorgene\u2122 PCR system acquiring the fluorescence on FAM, JOE, CY5, and ROX channels at each cycle. Samples and negative control (molecular grade water) were individually spiked with MS2 bacteriophage internal control (4,600 pfu per extraction) prior to nucleic acid extraction to identify any inhibitors. Positive controls for all panels were made from a combination of recombinant plasmids and from known positive specimens, diluted to give a cycle threshold value of 20\u201325. Negative controls were extracted molecular grade water.",

One possible explanation could be the operation mode of the National Programme, mainly based in general practitioners, working voluntarily as sentinel physicians for the sending of respiratory samples. In Portugal, many parents prefer to consult pediatricians, instead of the general practitioners, which may have contributed to the lower representation of children under five.",

In fact, the current project detected ten cases in children from the day care centers, while the National Programme had only five confirmed infections. Interestingly, ten additional cases were detected at the Hospital da Luz (a private hospital), suggesting that few parents consulted the Emergency Departments of the National health system that collaborate in the influenza surveillance programme, during this season, or not all cases were swabbed for laboratory diagnosis.",

At a first glance, this may seem rather difficult to achieve, since it demands a sample collection at home by a laboratory technician, every time a call is received for notification. However, it should be emphasized that all the collections of the current work were easily performed by a single technician, covering a population of 764 children, within the first 48 h after the call. Naturally, would parents\u2019 adherence be better, one technician could be insufficient to cover all the calls, but even with this level of parents\u2019 cooperation, the results were promising, as previously described. Another adding value of this system is the fact that, being more a population based than the actual health service based system, it allows the coverage of influenza cases that do not recur to a health care center or hospital. Nevertheless, it is important to state that these results are based only in one season, and that although promising, the continuous evaluation of the day care centre system, in other seasons, with the predominance of other influenza viruses, with different levels of intensity and epidemic period durations is necessary.",

Moreover, in this study, the possibility of the research staff to visit the home to assist with or perform specimen collections was available when required.

Therefore, these results are in agreement with previous published papers, where the use of sensitive molecular biology techniques detects the circulation in the community of the great majority of the described respiratory viruses [7, 8, 11, 15]. As it can be seen from the results, despite this approach being primarily described for influenza surveillance, it can identify the circulation of other viruses as well. This may bring useful epidemiological and clinical information, for instance in identifying early RSV circulation. Parents\u2019 reports were based on the detection of common and unspecific respiratory symptoms, and therefore, this system can detect all the viral respiratory infections and not exclusively influenza.",

This difference can be even lower, if we consider the eight children of the day care center group who finally attended a hospital, as part of the hospital population. The reasons for the negative results could be the presence of other viruses not included in the panels, bacterial infections, or even non-infectious causes, since the criteria for patients\u2019 selection were broad, therefore increasing sensitivity for study inclusion but decreasing specificity for viral detection. False-negative results for technical reasons can also be another explanation for, at least, some of the negative results.",

Examples are the adenovirus and the RSV, more frequent in children attending the Hospital, or the enterovirus, detected only in children staying at home or kept going to the day care center. However, only the adenovirus, linked to hospital attending, displayed a statistical difference between the two populations. Interestingly, two out of the six inpatients children had adenovirus infections, contributing to this idea that adenovirus could be linked to severity. However, it should be mentioned that this statistical difference changes from p = 0.007 to p = 0.045 (Fisher\u2019s exact test) if we consider the moving of eight children who attended the Emergency Department of a Hospital in the Lisbon area to the hospital population. Therefore, excluding this tendency of the adenovirus, the low number of samples does not allow us to draw conclusions regarding the differences of the etiologic agents between the two populations. In conclusion, the results obtained in this study suggest that a surveillance system based on parents\u2019 report could complement the implanted system of the National Influenza Surveillance Program, improving significantly the number of viral detections in young children. However, this should be confirmed by a subsequent study, covering a larger population, before solid recommendations can be done. All the respiratory viruses searched in this study were found to circulate in the community, at least in one of the periods, causing acute respiratory infections in young children that were usually mild but responsible for keeping most of the children and parents at home and, in some cases, for a hospital consultation or even hospitalization.",
