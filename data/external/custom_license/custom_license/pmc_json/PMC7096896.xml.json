It has long been appreciated that certain viral infections in infancy, for example those caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), cause inflammation and obstruction of the small airways (bronchioles), which lead to coughing and wheezing. It has also been proposed that infants who contract RSV bronchiolitis are at an increased risk of developing asthma later in life. By contrast, recent epidemiological studies indicate that not all viral infections increase the risk of asthma and, in fact, some may actually reduce the risk of developing allergic diseases and asthma.",

The chronic inflammation in asthma is a pleiotropic picture that usually includes an increase in the number of activated T cells, which predominantly secrete T helper (TH) 2-like cytokines such as interleukin 4 (IL-4), IL-5 and IL-13. This pattern of cytokine secretion, together with the secretion of epithelial-derived chemokines such as eotaxin (CCL11) and RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cells expressed and secreted; CCL5), promotes the recruitment and activation of eosinophils and mast cells, which contribute to chronic airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness of the airway to a variety of nonspecific stimuli. These factors, together with chronic structural changes to the airway and increased production of mucus by goblet cells, increase the risk of intermittent episodes of acute obstruction of airflow through the small airways of the lung in response to irritants (such as tobacco, smoke and air pollution), allergens and acute viral infections.",

Most of the risk factors for developing asthma after bronchiolitis in infancy relate to other signs or indicators of allergy, such as atopic dermatitis, food allergy or allergic rhinitis12,13,14. Furthermore, there is evidence that certain patterns of immune response to the infection, including eosinophilic inflammation in airway secretions15,16,17, reduced interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) production from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) ex vivo18, and increased ex vivo PBMC IL-10 secretion during convalescence19, are associated with an increased risk of recurrent wheezing, and possibly asthma. In animal models of infection with a related paramyxovirus, episodic lower airway obstruction after Sendai virus infection has been related to reduced production of IFN-\u03b320, and it is likely that additional immunological risk factors for lower airway effects of respiratory virus infections in humans will be identified. Although lower airway infections with RSV seem to increase the risk of recurrent wheezing in childhood21,22, this effect disappears by the age of 13 years21, indicating the increasing importance of other risk factors for asthma later on in childhood.",

This finding has led to speculation that infectious diseases, which are more likely to be transmitted in large families, could modulate the development of the immune system in such a way as to reduce the chances of developing allergies. This hypothesis implies that the immune system is skewed towards a TH2-like response pattern at birth25. According to the theory, each viral infection would provide a stimulus for the development and/or activation of TH1-like immune responses. The result of this repetitive stimulation would be to change the polarization of the TH system away from a TH2 overexpression and thus reduce the risk of developing allergies (Fig. 3).",

However, the hygiene hypothesis is supported by studies that show an inverse relationship between attendance at day care centres, where exposure to viral infections is quite high, and subsequent rates of allergy and asthma development28. However, it is not only the type of infection that is important, but also the route of exposure, as food-borne or enteric infections may have greater effects on allergy than respiratory infections29. Finally, it may not be the infections per se that are important, but rather exposure to microbes or microbial products in the environment. This concept is supported by the finding that exposure to a farming environment in early childhood, and/or having exposure to higher levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), is associated with reduced rates of allergy and asthma development30,31,32,33, Collectively, these findings indicate that repeated exposure to common infectious diseases and prolonged exposure to microbial products may protect against the development of allergies and asthma. If this concept is confirmed, determining the relevant mechanisms involved could lead to an entirely new approach to the prevention of these common problems.",

The rhinovirus has traditionally been considered to be an upper airway pathogen, as early studies indicated that it replicates better at 33\u201335 \u00b0C than at body temperature, and its injurious effects on airway tissue are limited. However, whether it induces acute asthma by infecting lower airway tissues is controversial. Direct measurements, however, have shown that temperatures in the proximal lower airways are conducive to rhinovirus replication, and only exceed 35 \u00b0C in the periphery of the lung36. Moreover, rhinovirus seems to replicate equally well in cultured epithelial cells derived from either upper or lower airway epithelium37, and has been detected in lower airway cells and secretions after experimental inoculation38,39. Finally, inoculation of healthy volunteers with rhinovirus produces lower airway inflammatory changes, including increases in neutrophils40, lymphocytes41,42 and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1)43. In addition, rhinovirus infection has been found to cause small increases in lower airway eosinophils in some40,41, but not all42, studies. Remaining areas of investigation include determining how much virus is present in the lower airway and establishing whether viral replication in the lower airway is a sufficient stimulus to provoke exacerbations of asthma.",

Individual risk factors for developing wheezing included detection of a respiratory virus, most commonly rhinoviruses, positive allergen-specific immunoglobulin E as detected by radioallergosorbent testing (RAST), and either eosinophilia or evidence of eosinophil degranulation in nasal secretions. Remarkably, the presence of virus in nasal secretions and indications of allergy (eosinophilic inflammation or positive RAST testing) synergistically increased the odds ratio for wheezing (Table 1). When considered together with findings from studies of experimental infection, these observations provide convincing evidence that people with either respiratory allergies or eosinophilic airway inflammation are at increased risk of the lower airway effects of viral infections.",

Damage to the epithelial cells can disturb airway physiology through several different pathways. For example, epithelial oedema and shedding, together with mucus production, can cause airway obstruction and wheezing. The immune response to the virus, including cell recruitment and activation, and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and mediators (for example, leukotrienes, kinins and prostenoids), can also contribute to the pathogenesis of respiratory infections. For viruses such as rhinoviruses, which infect relatively few cells in the airway, it may be the primary mechanism that causes airway symptoms and lower airway dysfunction48,49. Virus-induced cytokine production and inflammatory cell activation are likely to be instrumental in the development of neurogenic inflammatory responses, and these combined factors may increase bronchoconstriction in response to allergens or irritants.",

Activation of PKR has been linked to nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) activation, and the generation of pro-inflammatory and antiviral cytokines. Moreover, dsRNA activation of PKR induces antiviral activity through the generation of nitric oxide, inhibition of cellular translation and activation of RNase L55,56,57,58. In turn, many viruses have evolved mechanisms to inhibit these pathways to increase the probability of viral replication55. So, host-cell recognition of dsRNA seems to be an important pathway for the initiation of multiple pro-inflammatory and antiviral pathways within the cell. Whether innate antiviral responses to viral infection are impaired in asthma is clearly of interest; however, it has not yet been determined.",

It should be noted that oral corticosteroids are ineffective at reducing wheezing caused by RSV infection in infants, indicating that there are differences in the pathogenesis of these two clinical syndromes. New findings regarding the immunopathogenesis of viral respiratory illnesses indicate that it may be possible to inhibit virus-induced immune responses that are pro-inflammatory, without blocking antiviral effectors, such as IFN secretion and CD8+ T-cell-mediated responses, which are needed to clear the virus infection. Although evidence of a cause-and-effect relationship between specific cells or mediators and viral respiratory illness is at present circumstantial, viral induction of IL-8 and neutrophilic inflammation has been most closely associated with clinical symptoms, making this pathway a promising therapeutic target. In the absence of a valid animal model for rhinovirus-induced exacerbations of asthma, testing this hypothesis awaits the development of inhibitors of IL-8 and other pro-inflammatory pathways that are suitable for human clinical trials.",

Furthermore, the process can involve a progression from acute events (a) such as allergen-induced activation of mast cells to release pro-inflammatory cytokines and mediators, leading to acute bronchoconstriction and airway obstruction, to chronic inflammation (b) characterized by activation of T helper (TH) 2 cells and macrophages, and recruitment and degranulation of eosinophils. The changes in the airway cause not only airflow obstruction but also an increase in airway responsiveness. Finally, in some subjects, there is a further progression of the inflammatory changes towards airway remodelling (c). The remodelling changes can lead to permanent alterations in the airway architecture such that obstructive events are irreversible.

It is possible that this is a causal relationship, and that RSV bronchiolitis alters immune responses or lung development to promote allergy or asthma. Alternately, RSV infection could be an early stimulus for wheezing in children who have a predisposition for allergies and asthma. These possibilities are not mutually exclusive, and are currently under investigation in longitudinal clinical studies.",

Certain stimuli, such as infections with helminths or viruses (contracted from siblings or peers in day care centres), can help immunological development towards a healthy balance of TH1 and TH2-like cytokine responses. In the absence of these stimuli (that is, children who do not have contact with other children, or who live in relatively 'sterile' urban environments), the immature TH2-like pattern of cytokine production persists, leading to an increased risk of asthma and other atopic diseases.

The recruited leukocytes, together with pre-existing eosinophils in allergic airways, contribute to the inflammatory milieu through the secretion of additional cytokines and mediators.
