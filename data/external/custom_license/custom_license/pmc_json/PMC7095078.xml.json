Pandemics have occurred regularly throughout this century (1918, 1957 and 1968)4, and opportunities for the generation of new subtypes5 have persisted and probably expanded3. Pandemic influenza spreads rapidly, has high attack rates and kills millions of people worldwide1,4,6. The 1918 pandemic was particularly destructive. The case fatality proportion (CFP) was ten times higher than in all other influenza pandemics and was unusually high in young adults4,7.",

The doubling time for an epidemic curve (about three days in the 1918 pandemic) is a function of the reproductive number (R) and the serial interval (\u03bd), which is the average time between a primary and secondary case. The magnitude of R determines the intensity of measures required to halt transmission. The components of \u03bd, that is, the duration of the latent and infectious periods, determine how and when these measures must be applied. Estimates of R for pandemic influenza vary widely, ranging from 1.68 to 20 (refs 8\u201312), and are thus of limited value for pandemic preparation. Furthermore, R depends on both the infectious agent and the host population; for example, estimates for measles vary between rural and urban populations2. To our knowledge, there are no estimates of the range of R values that might be expected if a strain similar to 1918 pandemic influenza emerges.",

Infections in the SEIR model were transformed to P&I mortality by assuming a 2% CFP7,13. Time to death was based on influenza autopsy reports14,15,16, with a mean survival time of two weeks (see Supplementary Information). Excess deaths were defined as the deaths above the median for 1910\u201316 (described previously17, see Fig. 1 and Supplementary Information). The choice of baseline does not substantially affect the results; the 1918 influenza CFP was so much higher than for previous epidemics that any baseline is a small proportion of the 1918 P&I death curve (see Supplementary Information).",

To address the possibility that these initial R estimates were biased downward\u2014the model ignores the possibility of substantial slowing of exponential growth due to depletion of susceptible hosts, heterogeneous mixing and/or transmission-reducing interventions\u2014we also fit, for each city, the two adjacent weeks of data with the greatest exponential growth rate. The median estimated R (2.7) increased and the interquartile range (2.3, 3.4) widened. The maximum initial (6.3) and extreme (6.5) R estimates were similar. The extreme R values serve as an upper bound; R estimates based on fits of other regions of the epidemic curves tended to be lower than the extreme R values (see Supplementary Information). These results strongly support the conclusion that the estimated R for 1918 pandemic influenza was not large relative to that for many other infectious diseases2.",

Sensitivity analyses indicated that the assumptions governing the case-to-death transformation in our model (the CFP and the time-to-death distribution) did not affect the magnitude of R estimates (see Supplementary Information). Furthermore, calculations described in the Supplementary Information indicate that mortality data will quickly (within two weeks of the start of the epidemic) reach exponential growth at a rate determined by R, even if transmission and mortality are concentrated in separate groups. Thus, mortality-based R estimates should not be biased. We also estimated R using symptomatic influenza reports from three of the 45 cities.

Nevertheless, a large majority of the population was probably susceptible to the A/H1N1 pandemic strain in September 1918.

We know of one previous R estimate for 1918 pandemic influenza, obtained by fitting the entirety of a single curve of influenza deaths from cities across England and Wales10. Although the previous estimate was described by its author as having a poor fit to data10, and despite the additional assumptions implicit in that analysis, it is reassuring that our R estimates for 1918 A/H1N1 are similar. The median initial and extreme R values are slightly higher than 1957 A/H2N2 and 1968 A/H3N2 pandemic R estimates8,11 (see Supplementary Discussion), but are well below that of many other infections2. It is likely that an exceptionally high CFP in young adults, rather than an unusually high R, is what distinguishes the epidemic curve of 1918 from more recent pandemics.",

While the 1918 pandemic progressed quite rapidly, our results indicate that 1918 pandemic influenza A/H1N1 was not highly transmissible relative to other influenza subtypes8,11 and infectious agents2. A similar pandemic with an R0 of 2\u20134 could in principle be prevented by vaccinating or administering antiviral prophylaxis to 50\u201375% of the population, a figure that may require some adjustment owing to heterogeneous mixing patterns in real populations25. Unfortunately, controlling a future pandemic will not be so simple. At present, vaccine production capacity and antiviral medication stockpiles are insufficient to provide such broad coverage, even in wealthy countries3, although judicious use of available supplies may nevertheless reduce mortality during a pandemic8. Control measures based on case identification (for example, contact tracing, isolation, targeted prophylaxis and treatment) that were central to the control of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), whose R was similar to that for 1918 influenza26,27,28, will only be partially successful for influenza12. For influenza, unlike SARS, substantial transmission occurs before the onset of case-defining symptoms12. This implies that measures that generally reduce contacts between persons, regardless of infection status, may be our most powerful protection against a pandemic until adequate vaccine and antiviral medicines can be produced, at which point mass-vaccination and prophylaxis may be more effective than targeted approaches.",

The short time between primary and secondary cases (\u03bd) means that case numbers in a 1918-like pandemic will rise rapidly, with incident infections and the ensuing deaths doubling about every three days. Increased passenger travel relative to 1918 will facilitate the spread of a new virus across the globe. It is imperative that real-time surveillance information be shared freely, and that preventive measures be taken very early in a new pandemic. Therefore, while the relatively modest reproductive number estimated for 1918 pandemic influenza suggests the feasibility of controlling a similar future pandemic, significant planning and investment will be required to facilitate a rapid and effective response.",
