Ninety-three institutions involved in laboratory diagnostics of SARS were invited to participate in the study. Invitees were members of the international WHO SARS Reference and Verification Laboratory Network (9) or national and regional SARS reference laboratories. The study was announced as an external quality assurance study on diagnostic proficiency, which included certifying and publishing the results in a comparative and anonymous manner. Fifty-eight laboratories from 38 countries (21 European, 9 Austral-Asian, 7 North and South American, and 1 African) eventually enrolled in the study.1 Four companies that produced commercial diagnostic test systems also participated but were evaluated separately because they do not fulfill public health duties.",

The supernatants were heated to 56\u00b0C for 1 h and \u03b3 irradiated with 30 kGy. Residual infectivity was excluded by Vero cell cultures (3 passages). Aliquots of the inactivated virus stock solutions were lyophilized and redissolved, and the virus RNA was quantified by two different noncommercial real-time RT-PCR assays (2,6). Virion integrity was confirmed by morphology by electron microscopy (data not shown). Test samples for the study were generated by diluting the inactivated virus stock solutions in human fresh-frozen plasma testing negative for HIV-1, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and SARS-CoV by RT-PCR. Aliquots of 100 \u00b5L each were then lyophilized and shipped at ambient temperature to the participating laboratories. Each participant received a coded panel of seven positive and three negative samples. Virus-positive samples contained 94\u2013940,000 RNA copies per milliliter after resuspending in 100 \u00b5L of water. The participants were asked to analyze the material with the molecular methods they routinely use in suspected cases in humans. Details about the methods were requested, such as the sources of RT-PCR primers and protocols, the type of extraction method used, and suppliers and types of commercial kits, if used. The following two criteria were chosen as minimum requirements for overall proficiency. First, laboratories had to correctly detect the four samples containing >9,400 copies of viral RNA per milliliter, a concentration well above the detection limit of published and commercial nucleic acid amplification tests (NAT) for SARS-CoV (6,7,10\u201312). Second, no false-positive results were allowed with the negative samples. Indeterminate results in positive samples were treated as negative and in negative samples were treated as positive since the application of NAT usually does not involve indeterminate endpoints, and laboratories should be able to resolve unclear results by double testing with another amplification assay (13).",

The model could predict for the average laboratory that 50% of all test results could be expected to be correctly positive when 158 (95% confidence interval [CI] 76.55\u2013269.15) copies of virus RNA per milliliter of sample were present, and 95% with more than 11,220 (95% CI 5,675\u201331,988) copies per milliliter. Good compliance with the model furthermore confirmed that all samples contained the expected concentration of RNA upon reception by the participants and that no RNA degradation had occurred even in samples containing low amounts of virus.",

Only use of commercial RT-PCR test kits made a significant difference with regard to total sensitivity. This finding was in concordance with results of the four participating companies who manufacture these kits: all were 100% correct. Fourteen of 58 participants used commercial test kits. For noncommercial tests, whether laboratories developed primers themselves or adapted from other researchers did not make a difference. This finding might be due to availability of well-evaluated primers through a WHO internet resource during the outbreak (14). Forty-two of the 58 participants used at least one procedure listed on this site.",
