The 6,942 participants were randomly selected by physicians, as described (6). To detect HEV, we amplified 350\u2013400 bp of the viral protein 1 (VP1) gene by reverse transcription PCR (7) and verified the findings by sequence analysis (GenBank accession nos.

According to results of BLAST analysis (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), the HEV detected in a sample was assigned to the serotype with which the amplified sequence shared >75% nt or >88% aa sequence identity (8). All samples were simultaneously screened for influenza viruses (A, B, and C), human parainfluenza viruses (1\u20134), respiratory syncytial virus, human coronaviruses (229E, NL63, HKU1, and OC43), metapneumovirus, adenovirus, and rhinovirus (6).",

            "text": "The reason for the high frequency of CVA21 and EV68 infections in Beijing is unclear. The EV68 strains identified in this study are probably novel strains or genetic variants to which the population is immune. Moreover, the deduced amino acid identity of the EV68 strains with strains detected in children in Japan (GenBank accession nos. AB601872\u2013AB601885) (5) was 89.4%\u201393.8%, indicating the possible co-existence of 2 distinct phylogenetic lineages of EV68 strains (13). The emergence of new genetic lineages might be the reason for increasing activity of EV68 (5,13). Because the median age of CVA21-positive patients was significantly lower than that of other HEV-positive patients (Table 2), we suspect that years of CVA21quiescence probably resulted in increased susceptibility of the younger population (11). Outbreaks of classical HEVs tend to occur in several-year cycles (11). We noted that CVA21 infections were concentrated in 2006 and 2008. However, because patients were not enrolled in our study after April 2010, our data on HEV circulation might be incomplete. Longer surveillance would be useful for determining the cycle of CVA21 and EV68 infections. Another limitation of this study is that samples were collected from outpatients but not hospitalized patients, which could bias the classification of illness toward being mild. However, this study presents evidence that CVA21 and EV68 cause mild disease and fills a void left by other studies that included only hospitalized patients.",

Our findings provide further insight into the pathogenesis of HEVs and increase our awareness of their clinical role. To predict possible outbreaks, global surveillance and investigation of HEV serotypes in patients with ARTIs should be strengthened.",

The scale bars indicate evolutionary distance. GenBank accession numbers for reference serotypes are indicated in parentheses. Each detected strain is indicated by black circles and a specific identification code followed by the patient number and the time of sampling. Strains detected by other research groups are indicated by a GenBank accession number. A) Phylogenetic tree of partial coxsackievirus (CV) A21 VP1 gene. The 375-bp fragments, which correspond to the locations of nt 2565\u20132939 of the CVA21 prototype strain (GenBank accession no. AF546702), were used to construct the tree. Enterovirus 68 (EV68), CVA9, CVA4, and CVA20 (GenBank accession nos. AY426531, D00627, AY421762, and AF499642, respectively) were used as outgroups. B) Phylogenetic tree of partial EV68 VP1 gene. The 390-bp fragments, which correspond to the locations of nt 2494\u20132883 of the EV68 prototype strain (GenBank accession no. AY426531), were used to construct the phylogenetic tree.
