All patients with RSV in this study had pneumonia on admission, and five of the six patients were frail nursing home residents. The rate of pneumonia in elderly patients with RSV infection varies with the population studied. For community-dwelling elderly, the rate of pneumonia in RSV infection is estimated at 2\u20135% throughout the year and at 5\u201315% in winter, for nursing home residents at 10\u201320%, and for hospitalised elderly at 44\u201363% [11, 13].",
