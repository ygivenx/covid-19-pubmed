The data were obtained from the state government tourism websites for Victoria (20), New South Wales (NSW) (19), and the Northern Territory (21). Because details on visitor origin were only obtained at the state level, we assumed that each person in that state would make an equal contribution to visitor nights in the destination city. These values were then used to estimate the proportions of the travel volume due to each of the 2 cities on a route and to modify force of infection calculations by incorporating the average length of stay. The travel rates (weighted by length of stay) used in the simulations are provided in Table 1. Demographic data on cities and states were acquired from the Australian Bureau of Statistics population estimates for 2004 (16).",

The model evolves in discrete time, with the step length equal to 1 day. This time frame accords with real-life epidemics, for which incidence and other epidemiologic data are usually recorded daily. The discrete time structure simplifies the introduction of a variable infectivity profile, incorporating a latent, noninfectious period and a changing degree of infectivity for each person during the course of his or her illness. This feature of the model is supported by virus-shedding studies (22) and enables us to contrast the effect of a highly peaked infectivity profile, similar to that used by Ferguson et al. (6), with the effect of a constant infectivity profile (7), as depicted in Figure 1C.",

The doubling time is determined by the basic reproduction number (R0), defined as the average number of secondary infections due to a single primary infected person in a completely susceptible population, and the form of the infectivity profile. The infectivity profile primarily influences the growth rate through the mean time (or serial interval) between cases: \u22482.8 days for the peaked infectivity function and 4 days for the flat infectivity function used here. The doubling time depends linearly on the serial interval so that epidemics that use the peaked infectivity profile double in size almost 1.5\u00d7 as quickly as epidemics that use the flat infectivity profile, for the same value of R0. The infectivity profile and R0 depend on properties of the pathogen and on social, environmental, and genetic factors.",

We take R0 to be in the range 1.5\u20133.5, which corresponds to attack rates of 58%\u201397% (including subclinical infections) in a population without prior immunity or behavioral changes in response to the pandemic.",

In Figure 2B (R0 = 1.5, peaked infectivity), an increase in m20 from 22 to 32 days is seen for 80% restrictions, with a further increase to 52 days for 99% restrictions, if applied immediately. These improvements appear robust for delays of up to 4 weeks, but in fact a sizeable proportion of the simulations have spread to Melbourne by this point. This effect is illustrated in Figure 3A and B, in which we compare the full distribution of T20 in the presence of 99% travel restrictions applied at the 2- and 4-week marks, respectively. Both distributions are bimodal, but in Figure 3B, the first mode is substantial. This difference arises because a large proportion of simulated outbreaks spread to Melbourne between the 2- and 4-week marks for this combination of disease parameters, a finding that emphasizes that timing can be critical for the success of travel restrictions. Under the pessimistic assumption of R0 = 3.5 and peaked infectivity, the impact of travel restrictions is muted, and a delay of just 2 weeks renders the restrictions ineffective.",
