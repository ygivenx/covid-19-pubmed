            "text": "Infectious bronchitis (IB), an economically important disease to poultry industry, is caused by the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) which belongs to the Coronaviridae family. As a highly infectious and contagious pathogen of chickens, IBV not only causes upper respiratory disease, but also replicates in kidney and oviduct [1, 2]. IBV genome consists of a positive-stranded RNA encoding four structural proteins, envelope (E) glycoprotein, integral membrane (M) glycoprotein, phosphorylated nucleocapsid (N) protein, and spike (S) glycoprotein [3, 4]. S glycoprotein is posttranslationally cleaved into S1 and S2 by cellular proteases. S1 forms the tip of the spike, and S2 anchors the S1 to the viral membrane. S1 as the major inducer of protective immunity is the main protein responsible for attachment and subsequent infection of target cells and tissue tropism. Furthermore, S1 induced the production of neutralizing and hemagglutinating antibodies [5\u20138]. Several amino acids differences of S1 can result in a new serotype strain, and lead to poor cross-protection, but the mutations of the S1 gene are not always associated with the new antigenic variants [9\u201311].",

Viruses were propagated in 9- to 11-day-old embryonated specific pathogen-free (SPF) chicken eggs. The allantoic fluids were collected 48 h post-inoculation for RNA extraction, and viruses were identified as IBV by RT-PCR for the N protein gene.

The bootstrap values were determined from 1,000 replicates of the original data. It was clearly shown that all these isolated strains were separated into six variant lineages (CH I\u2013CH VI) (Fig. 1). Group CH I consisted of 15 isolated strains, designated as QX like variant lineage with the inclusion of Chinese QXIBV strain and Netherlandish QX-like strain L-1148; 10 isolates and 6 reference strains formed group CH II, and 4/91 strain was clustered into this big branch; group CH III of 4 isolates; group CH IV of 6 isolated and 5 Chinese reference strains, and it is interested that Pigeon coronavirus PSH050513 strain was closely related to those isolates in this group; CK/CH/SC/DY09, CK/CH/SC/ZJ10-1, CK/CH/HuN/NX09, along with Taiwanese TW-I variant lineage strain 3468/07 were grouped into the group CH V; CK/CH/GD/NC10, CK/CH/GD/KP10, and our previous isolates TC07-2 formed the group CH VI, which showed a distant relationship with other strains. Most foreign reference IBV strains showed evolutionary distances to Chinese IBV isolates according to the branch distribution of the phylogenetic tree. Different variant lineages of IBV strains were co-circulating in chicken flocks of same area, for example, both the isolates CK/CH/HB/HC09-2 and CK/CH/HB/HC09-1 were isolated in the same area and same time of Hubei province, but were clustered into variant lineage CH I and CH II, respectively, and showed large evolutionary distance. The strains from different parts could show high amino acid sequence similarities, CK/CH/SC/ZJ10-1 and CK/CH/HuN/NX09, which were isolated in Sichuan and Hunan province in 2009, respectively, clustered into one lineage. The results strongly suggest that IBV epidemiology is very complicated in China. There are also many genotypes co-circulating in Europe, USA and other parts of the world [13\u201316].\n",

Remarkably, one IBV strain of TW-type CK/CH/SCMY/10I was also isolated in Sichuan recently [17]. But previous research reveals that IBV strains from Taiwan formed a unique genotype that was separated from the Chinese genotypes [12, 18]. Taiwan is a geographically separate island from China by 100 miles of water. If there is no illegal trafficking or unapproved attenuated vaccine used in the field, considering the trading of poultry is forbidden, Taiwan researchers speculated that migrating birds provided the genetic sources of IBV variants in Taiwan [19]. Peafowl and teal may be the hosts as carriers of IBV, and have potential to transmit viruses to susceptible chicken populations [20]. In this study, a coronavirus from pigeons (PSH050513) was grouped into the CH IV. It also had high degree of amino acid sequence identity of 94.6\u201399.1% between CK/CH/HN/HN10, CK/CH/GD/YN09-1, CK/CH/GX/YL10-1, CK/CH/FJ/PT10, and PSH050513, which were located in different provinces. PSH050513 has been tentatively identified as a novel member of group 3 coronaviruses that have close genetic relationship with IBV strains [21, 22]. May be migrating birds spread the virus.",

It has been reported that S1 amino acids of different IBV serotypes usually differ by 20\u201325% [23]. This indicates that the strains of CH VI lineage are a different serotype than the vaccine strains and the other types of IBV isolates examined. In this cluster, TC07-2 was isolated in Guangdong province in 2007 [12], the other two isolates (CK/CH/GD/NC10 and CK/CH/GD/KP10) from 2010 were isolated in west of Guangdong province, where is far from the place of TC07-2 isolated. This novel IBV was also isolated in Japan recently (designated JP-IV), and the introduction route of this novel IBV into Japan and its prevalence are unknown [13], indicating these \u201cnovel\u201d strains may spread to many chicken flocks in recent years. Because the CH VI strains continue to persist in the field and have a unique sequence compared with other strains of IBV, it is an excellent choice for studying genetic drift and recombination, may be strains of CH VI has undergone recombination event as well as extensive antigenic variation like DE072 strain [24], but need further research to testify.",

The data also indicated that phylogenic distant IBV strains continued to emerge, and there were no predominant IBV strains circulating in the fields in China yet as we reported earlier [12]. Interestingly, two field isolates were classified into the new phylogenetic group CH VI; what impact they might exert on IBV\u2019s spread and circulation needs to be monitored. This paper is a periodic report on our ongoing surveillance program, and it manifests the importance of continuing surveillance of IBV strains.",
