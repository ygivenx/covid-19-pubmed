Some of the group I coronaviruses, such as porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), utilize aminopeptidase N (APN) [1, 19, 22, 23].

Expression of the TGEV receptor in mice from a transgene rendered otherwise resistant mice susceptible to TGEV [1]. However, this approach is not available for PEDV. An alternative approach is to isolate viruses that have adapted for growth within the animals and which exhibit virulence. Such adaptations have been reported for two other coronaviruses, IBV and OC43 [3]. In the present study, we isolated a strain of PEDV that was more virulent than the original tissue-culture-adapted virus after passage through mouse brain cells. The adapted virus showed enhanced cytopathology compared with the original virus.",

After staining for 2 h, the cells were washed with water and dried, and the plaques were counted under a light microscope as described for the infectious titration of human coronavirus 229E [6]. The viral titer in the brains of the mice is given as plaque-forming units (PFU)/50 \u03bcl of 10% homogenate, whereas the titer in the supernatant is given as PFU/ml of supernatant; the cell titer is given as PFU/well of a 24-well plate.",

MK and MK-p10 exhibited similar growth kinetics in suckling mouse brain, peaking on day 4 p.i. (Fig. 3a). Their growth kinetics in cultured Vero cells was also determined. Some coronaviruses tend to remain intracellular, and viral stocks are prepared by ultrasonication or repeated freeze-thawing cycles. To compare the amounts of budded and intracellular virus, the titers in the supernatant (Fig. 3b) and cells (Fig. 3c) were determined separately. Similar to the growth kinetics in the brains of the mice, the growth pattern in Vero cells did not differ significantly between MK and MK-p10 (Fig. 3b, c). These results suggest that the increased virulence in suckling mice and syncytium formation in cultured cells is not due to increased growth in the brain or cultured cells.\n",

These viruses initially showed low virulence (i.e., clinical symptoms such as tremor and rigidity and lethargy in suckling mice), but the virulence increased with repeated passage in mouse brains. In this study, the passage of PEDV in suckling mouse brains clearly strengthened its virulence, similar to the adaptation seen in OC43 and IBV. Unexpectedly, the original mouse non-adapted PEDV showed significant virulence for suckling mice. The primary sequences of S protein from the viruses isolated after repeated passages were determined. PEDV passed in mouse brains showed mutations in the S protein, which had accumulated after ten passages. The H-to-R mutation at residue 1,381, which was first detected after eight passages, is likely responsible for the enhanced cell\u2013cell fusion activity, as only those viruses with this mutation showed significantly larger syncytia compared with the original PEDV; The S protein is a major determinant of the fusion activity of coronaviruses [5, 20]. It would be interesting to find out whether this substitution in the S protein is responsible for the enhanced fusion activity by expressing S protein alone. Those mutations found in the mouse-adapted viral S proteins could be responsible for the increased virulence; however, other genes have been reported to be involved in the virulence of such coronaviruses as MHV and SARS-CoV [7, 15, 17, 21]. To identify the genes responsible for the increase in virulence, we would need the entire genomic sequences of the original and mouse-adapted PDEVs; additionally, reverse-genetic analyses would be essential.",

Few cases are known in which coronaviruses multiply in cells derived from non-susceptible host animals. SARS-CoV can grow in a variety of cells established from several animal species [13, 14, 18, 24], and it is somewhat capable of growing in the same animals; however, efficient infection is restricted to cells from animals that support SARS-CoV infection [24]. The growth potential of SARS-CoV in a variety of animal cells correlated with the utilization of its receptor molecule, ACE2 [11]. Most known coronaviruses become infective in cells when their functional receptor molecule is expressed by transfection with a plasmid encoding the receptor molecule [5]. This suggests that Vero cells susceptible to PEDV infection express a functional receptor. In our study, both mouse-adapted and non-adapted MK strains of PEDV could infect and grow in suckling mouse brains, suggesting that a receptor molecule utilized by both viruses exists in suckling mouse brain. To determine which cell types in the brain express the receptor, we are attempting to identify the cell types that are infected by PEDV in suckling mouse brain. This will provide valuable information related to the receptor molecule utilized by PEDV.",
