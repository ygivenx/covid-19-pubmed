Electrophoretic mobility shift assay, UV cross-linking, nucleotide analog interference mapping and filter binding assay have only provided restricted information on RNA-protein interactions. Therefore, a technology, which can provide a real-time kinetic analysis to compare affinities between different targets and can be used for RNA-binding protein screenings, is required [1, 2].",

SPR is an optical detection technology to measure the changes in the refractive index near a sensor surface that offers kinetic analysis of biomolecular interactions in real time [4\u20137]. Molecular binding is monitored by a change in SPR angle, which is reported as resonance units (RU). One RU corresponds approximately to a surface concentration of 1 pg/mm2 for an average protein. However, it should be emphasized that the relationship between RU and pg of the materials varies with the refractive index of the bound molecule, and, thus, nucleic acid is different from protein [6, 7]. If the molecule does not bind to a target on the chip surface, it will give zero RU of response. A limitation of the method is that the sensor surface is not well-suitable to the small molecules analysis (<200 Da). Also, the mass transfer problem should be reduced by optimizing the flow rate and the amount of bound molecules.",

The running buffer, which was also used for the ligand dilution, was HBS-EP (0.01 M HEPES, 0.15 M NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005% surfactant P20 [pH 7.4]) [15\u201317]. At first, 70 \u03bcl of 50 nM biotinylated DNA was injected at 2 \u03bcl/min into one flow cell and led to a probe capture of 828 RU, and then, 80 \u03bcl of 150 nM of the same probe provided another capture of 941 RU (Fig. 1a). Secondly, the RNA sample mixed with an equal volume of HBS-EP buffer was hybridized on the surface of the DNA-coated sensor chip at a flow rate of 2 \u03bcl/min in the running buffer (Fig. 1c), giving a probe capture of 600 RU. The 3\u2032-end of the RNA complementary to the biotinylated DNA was hybridized to the chip fixed molecules, leaving the rest of RNA sequence as a free target for protein binding. Three different temperatures (25, 30 and 37\u00b0C) were used to optimize hybridization conditions of RNAs comparing with DNA CB. We also used a non-complementary RNA probe as a negative control in the same condition to examine whether the RNA hybridization is specific. Binding capabilities of the fixed biotinylated DNA and the RNA could be verified by injections of DNA CB and DNA CR, respectively (Fig. 1b, d). Oligo dT was considered to be a negative control. Thirdly, 75 \u03bcl of the 10 nM of N protein was injected at 30 \u03bcl/min, followed by the same flow rate of running buffer (Fig. 1e). BSA protein was set as a negative control. Finally, the sensor chip was regenerated by running 5 \u03bcl of a buffer containing 20 mM NaOH and 1 M NaCl to remove all hybridized RNAs. The blank cell without biotinylated DNAs was simultaneously used as reference. The response data was analyzed using separated Ka/Kd 1:1 (Langmuir) association and 1:1 (Langmuir) dissociation models with the BIA evaluation program version 4.1. The DNA-coated chip was stored at 4\u00b0C.\n\n",

The buffer conditions used for RNA hybridization were also suitable for RNA-protein binding as determined in previous studies [10, 17]. Three different temperatures 25, 30 and 37\u00b0C were evaluated in the RNA-DNA hybridization. The same RNA sample was injected for 200 s, and the system was washed with running buffer. Temperature increase clearly enhanced the RNA-DNA hybridization (Fig. 2b). When the temperature was kept below 25\u00b0C, the hybridized RNA was hardly detectable. DNA CB complementary to the pre-immobilized DNA was also injected at three different temperatures (Fig. 1b). The hybridization of DNA CB at 25\u00b0C could reach about 50% of the level achieved at 37\u00b0C (Fig. 2c). This observation could be explained by the fact that longer single-stranded oligonucleotides can easily generate hairpins at lower temperature. Therefore, incubations at higher temperature may help to unfold the secondary construct especially in RNA molecules.",

We have shown that the binding temperature was essential to optimize RNA hybridizations (Fig. 2b). The data indicated that binding conditions were appropriate for RNA-DNA hybridizations and the binding was specific. In practice, the maximum response observed (the effective binding capacity) was affected by the activity of the ligand. Theoretically, the capture of 600 RU of 106-nt RNA only needs 600 \u00d7 33/106 = 187 RU of biotinylated DNA because biotinylated DNA was 33 nt in length. However, when we immobilized 200 RU of biotinylated DNA, the activity of captured RNAs was very low and was quickly lost in a few days. Since the maximum attainable binding capacity to capture a ligand is always lower than that of a direct immobilized ligand and the RNA should be captured at the beginning of each analysis cycle, we suggest to immobilize the maximum amount of biotinylated DNA probes. The total captured RNA can be controlled by changing the volume of the injection. Considering that RNAs are easily degraded in common conditions, we have selected a higher temperature in order to ensure a rapid RNA hybridization. Although occasional background noise signals might be increased when the temperature is higher than 30\u00b0C, this noise can be minimized by improving the injection technique and by using highly purified analytes.",
