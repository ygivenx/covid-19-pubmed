In side-by-side studies with wild-type mice and T- and B cell-deficient mouse models, T cell (cellular) responses can be separately studied from B cell (humoral) responses for many diseases (bacterial, viral, parasitic, inflammatory and autoimmune). In addition to studying the basic immune response to a pathogenic challenge, these animals have also been used to test vaccines for effectiveness (McNeal et al. 2002; Wyatt et al. 2004). Unfortunately, results from rodent immunological models often do not translate to larger mammals, such as livestock and humans (Melo et al. 2007; Rogers et al. 2008b; Butler et al. 2009).",

For example, pigs are omnivorous like humans, have a similar gut flora and are infected by closely-related viral and bacterial pathogens. For most major enteropathogens, such as Helicobactor pylori, Shigella flexneri and Salmonella enterica, mouse animal models do not reproduce the tropism, immunopathology, or other hallmarks of the corresponding human infections (Goodwin et al. 1986; Lecuit 2007). The dietary and mucosal similarity of humans and swine has resulted in their specific use as models for digestive, respiratory and/or infectious diseases, and allergies (Krakowka et al. 1991; Saif et al. 1996; Helm et al. 2002; Charley et al. 2006; Souza et al. 2007; Dawson et al. 2009). A prominent and recently described example of a porcine model that more fully recapitulated a human condition is the knock-out piglet model for cystic fibrosis (Rogers et al. 2008b).",

All subsequent steps involved amplification of relevant porcine HC sequences from a previously generated porcine primary fetal fibroblast (PPFF) cell line using primers sequences based on BAC sequence analysis. The PPFF cell line was isolated from a fetus at day 33 of gestation. After removing the head and viscera, the fetus was washed with Hanks\u2019 Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), placed in 20 ml of HBSS and diced with small surgical scissors. The tissue pellet was resuspended in 50 ml tubes with 40 ml of DMEM + 100 U/ml collagenase (Invitrogen). Tubes were incubated for 40 min in a shaking water bath at 37\u00b0C. The digested tissue was allowed to settle for 3\u20134 min and the cell-rich supernatant was transferred to a new 50 ml tube and spun down. The cells were then resuspended in 40 ml of DMEM, 10% Fetal Calf Serum, 1\u00d7 non-essential amino acids, 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen) and 2 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN), then seeded into 10 cm dishes. All cells were cryopreserved upon reaching confluence. An amplimer, extending from the intron between the HC Diversity (DH) and JH regions, and ending 3\u2032 of the Coding region of Mu constant (C\u03bc)1 of the porcine HC locus, was generated so that both homologous arms in the knockout vector could be generated from a contiguous fragment (refer to Fig. 1a for schematic of HC locus). The pKOTKneo vector (Lexicon Genetics, The Woodlands, TX), from which the poly(A) signal 3\u2032 of the neomycin Resistance gene (neoR) had been excised, was used to generate the JH targeting construct (pREV708). The single functional porcine JH is found within 6 kb upstream of the coding sequence for C\u03bc region (Butler et al. 1996). The 5.8 kb 3\u2032 homologous targeting arm sequence was ligated into the pKOTKneo vector, downstream of the phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter-neoR cassette. The 2.0 kb 5\u2032 homologous arm sequence was ligated into this same vector upstream of the PGK-neoR cassette. A 0.4 kb CMV enhancer sequence was inserted between the 5\u2032 homologous arm and the PGK-neoR cassette, making a CMV-PGK-neoR cassette (lacking a poly(A) signal sequence), and completing the pREV708 JH targeting construct.\n",

Sequence analyses confirmed the presence of one functional JH region fragment (JH5), and also revealed the presence of four JH-like fragments 5\u2032 of JH5 (JH1\u2013JH4) that, while possessing some sequence homology, due to truncation or inadequacy of their recombination signal sequences, would be regarded as JH pseudogene segments. A schematic of the genomic region and the poly(A)-trap targeting strategy described in Materials and Methods is also shown in Fig. 1a. A successfully targeted event necessitated that the poly(A) from C\u03bc be utilized as a targeting trap to ensure transcription and subsequent translation of the neoR gene product for G418 resistance. Of 476 G418-resistant colonies obtained from a total of 9 transfections, 3 were correctly targeted as determined by PCR and Southern blot (data not shown), inactivating one JH allele.

One pregnancy was utilized to collect day 45 fetuses, from which PPFFs were isolated for future manipulation and re-cloning while the remaining 2 recipients carried their pregnancies to term, producing 9 female cloned piglets. This gave an average efficiency of live births/total transferred embryos of 1.98%. Five of the 9 piglets were confirmed to be JH \u00b1 by Southern blot analysis using a digoxigenin (dig) labeled probe for the XbaI digest (see Fig. 1a for location), and a dig labeled JH probe for the NcoI digest (latter not shown in this report, used as confirmation only). The 4 JH +/+ piglets can be attributed to bystander effects, where neoR colonies selected for SCNT cloning contained a mixture of targeted and bystander unmodified cells, which would be subsequently observed in fetuses from litters originating from these colonies. JH \u00b1 cloned founder females were outbred to wild-type male pigs of a similar large white breed in order to generate JH \u00b1 F1 offspring of both sexes. F1 male and female JH \u00b1 pigs were subsequently used for cross breeding resulting in the birth of multiple F2 litters. Their genotypes approximated the expected 1:2:1 Mendelian ratio, which was confirmed after subsequent litters (data not shown).",

Five conventionally reared JH \u2212/\u2212 piglets that were allowed to suckle all remained healthy until weaning at ~4 weeks postpartum. Thereafter they suffered from a wasting-like syndrome that is characteristic of bacterial infection over a period of two months (Table 2). Just as the JH \u2212/\u2212 piglets, these JH \u2212/\u2212 pigs were devoid of IgM+ B cells in the bloodstream (3 of which are shown in Fig. 2b). Normally, serum IgG levels rise to ~30 mg/ml after suckling and then decline with a half-life of 10 days. However, since some de novo synthesis continues after birth, levels at 8 weeks postpartum do not normally drop below 6\u20138 mg/ml (Klobasa et al. 1981). Although, in the JH \u2212/\u2212 piglets, the IgG level at 8 weeks for the same 3 pigs tested in Fig. 2b was as low as ~7% of the levels of their JH +/+ littermates (i.e. 0.5\u20131.7 mg/ml versus 7\u20138 mg/ml, data not shown). These low levels are well below the cutoff for survival. Although IgG absorption by JH \u2212/\u2212 piglets had not been determined, these low post-weaning levels suggest the lack of de novo synthesis in these conventionally reared piglets. As seen in the earlier tested JH \u2212/\u2212 piglets, all 5 weaned JH \u2212/\u2212 pigs of this litter were devoid of CD79\u03b1+ B cells and follicular/germinal center development in MLNs and spleens, with no effect on staining of T cells (Table 2). The cause of illness was determined by necropsy performed by an expert veterinary pathologist. Thus, JH \u2212/\u2212 piglets are severely susceptible to bacterial infection and cannot be conventionally maintained after weaning.\n",

However, gene targeting using a promoter-trap strategy, which requires expression of the target gene, may not always be feasible due to a restricted repertoire of genes expressed in fibroblasts. In this study, a poly(A)-trap strategy was successfully used to obtain targeted recombination events in fibroblasts where promoter trapping [previously performed by our group (Dai et al. 2002)] would not be feasible (Rogers et al. 2008a). Knockout of the single functional porcine JH region gene segment, which is not actively transcribed in fibroblasts, was demonstrated in primary somatic cells. There are only two other targeted loci previously published in swine (Dai et al. 2002; Rogers et al. 2008a), and this is the first successful poly(A)-trap strategy ever published in a livestock species. Rodents and humans can utilize 4\u20136 JH gene segments, but swine only utilize one (Butler et al. 1996; Jung et al. 2006). JH \u2212/\u2212 pigs were devoid of IgM+ B cells, IgM transcripts and serum Ig isotypes in the blood. JH \u2212/\u2212 pigs also lacked follicular architecture, Ig isotype transcripts and heavy and light chain proteins, and B cells in secondary lymphoid organs.

In our study, the blood and secondary lymphoid organs of JH \u2212/\u2212 piglets were devoid of detectable transcription and secretion of all major Ig isotypes and all Ig protein chains (heavy or light chains), respectively, proving that JH \u2212/\u2212 pigs are completely deficient of Ab. Productive VDJ rearrangement at the HC locus is required for the generation of the pre-B-cell receptor, which signals differentiation from the pro-B-cell to the pre-B-cell stage during B cell development (Jung et al. 2006). Essentially, functional VDJ rearrangement at the HC locus is required for B cell survival during early development (Jakobovits et al. 1993). This was confirmed for pigs by this study, since no IgM+, kappa or lambda light chain+, or CD79\u03b1+ B cells were found in the blood or peripheral lymphoid organs of the JH \u2212/\u2212 pigs. Also, the lack of B cells and follicular architecture in the JH \u2212/\u2212 piglets supports previous contentions that development of follicles is B cell-dependent (Randall et al. 2008). We showed that normal rearrangements were observed in T cells for the TCR\u03b2 chain of all pigs tested, which, like the HC locus, undergoes VDJ recombination (Chowdhury and Sen 2004). Our data suggest that targeting both alleles of the JH region of the HC locus has no significant observed effect on VDJ recombination at T cell loci or subsequent generation of CD3+ T cells.",

It is known from studies on conventionally reared piglets that when serum IgG levels are < 5 mg/ml, piglets become highly susceptible, and die primarily from bacterial infections (Klobasa et al. 1981). In this report, the 3 JH \u2212/\u2212 piglets that survived to 8 weeks of age (~4 weeks post-weaning) showed a range of IgG levels of 0.5\u20131.7 mg/ml. Although bacteria were not seen in the lesions, the characteristics of the inflammation were always consistent with a bacterial infection. The absence of detectable levels of bacteria is not surprising, since the bacterial numbers were likely too low to be seen by light microscopy. Based on the fact that no immunocompetent pigs of the same age range (including wild-type littermates) weaned normally had any evidence of infectious diseases, and the pigs were housed in clean facilities, the lesions were most likely caused by opportunistic bacteria. The slight temporal differences in post-weaning illness onset among JH \u2212/\u2212 pigs is likely due to each piglets\u2019 ability to suckle ample quantities of Ab-containing colostrum from the sow soon after birth. Based on this phenotype, for some disease models, facilities with gnotobiotic capabilities would be required.",

Thus, it may be useful to study these heterozygotes to confirm the apparent effect of the loss of one JH allele on the ability to make productive VDJ rearrangements. According to allelic exclusion, if the rearrangement on the first chromosome fails, rearrangement on the second chromosome and subsequent expression can still occur (Jung et al. 2006). Since JH \u00b1 B cells have only one functional allele, fewer productive rearrangements and, therefore, fewer B cells may be formed. However, this is in contrast to earlier reports from one group on B cell numbers in IgM +/+ versus IgM \u00b1 mice (Kitamura et al. 1991; Kitamura and Rajewsky 1992). This may be related to the species differences, targeting strategies, or any potentially different mechanisms of generating Ab diversity between mice and swine. In previous studies, it was observed that in fetal liver and yolk, 90% of rearrangements were productive, whereas this dropped to the expected 67% in late-term bone marrow (Sinkora et al. 2003). Accordingly, this reported observation in piglets, and the histological and IHC observations reported here, suggest the need to learn more about VDJ rearrangement in swine.",

In infectious disease research and vaccine development, it is important to study the cellular and humoral immune response, both together and separately. Robl et al. first reported the targeted disruption of one functional HC locus in a large animal, namely cattle (Kuroiwa et al. 2004). No immunological characterization was performed to show a B cell and Ab deficiency at that time. More recently, the same group reported that cows express two functional HC loci (Kuroiwa et al. 2009) in contrast to the one functional locus expressed in mice (Kitamura et al. 1991), pigs (Butler et al. 2009) and humans (Yel et al. 1996). They showed that both bovine loci (four alleles in total) must be targeted for the cattle to become Ab- and B cell-deficient (Kuroiwa et al. 2009). The time and resources required to generate and house sufficient B cell-deficient cattle for research studies is significantly more than for the B cell-deficient pig model described herein. Specifically, for bovine B cell deficiency, 4 rounds of targeting and SCNT is required by their strategy, where cows are only produced by cloning (Kuroiwa et al. 2004; Kuroiwa et al. 2009). The method to generate B cell-deficient pigs has fewer burdens on molecular biology and animal cloning teams, with only 1 round of targeting and 1 round of cloning required, following by standard breeding of heterozygous knockout animals. Also, since B cell-deficient pigs are: (1) generated by breeding or cloning, (2) litter bearing (cows usually produce one offspring versus over 10 on average for pigs naturally bred at our facility), (3) smaller than cows, and (4) less difficult to raise under gnotobiotic conditions (Butler and Sinkora 2007), producing and utilizing B cell-deficient pigs as models is much more time and cost efficient in the short- and the long-run.",

Since PRRSV seems to cause virulence by subverting humoral immunity through polyclonal activation of the pre-immune B cell repertoire (Butler et al. 2008), the B-cell deficient pig model will likely be of significant value in disease etiology. Theoretically, if B cell-deficient piglets are reared in isolator units to protect them from bacterial infection, the degree to which polyclonal B cell activation contributes to PRRSV-induced immune dysregulation could be assessed. These same piglets could serve as a model to determine the relative role of cell-mediated and Ab-mediated viral immunity not only to PRRSV but other troublesome neonatal swine viruses such as influenza, parvovirus, and circovirus, which would have valuable agricultural applications (Butler et al. 2008).

For example, because of similarities with humans, pigs that lack the expression of the ion transport gene associated with cystic fibrosis (CFTR) have been generated to study this disease, since CFTR knockout mice fail to develop any clinically relevant form of cystic fibrosis (Rogers et al. 2008b). In the case of CF, there are always questions of whether bacterial infections like Pseudomonas that are often associated with CF are primary or secondary effects. This can be tested using germ-free CFTR knockout animals. It is yet unclear whether some CF pathology or CF protection is Ab mediated. Perhaps by crossbreeding CFTR \u2212/\u2212 to JH \u2212/\u2212 pigs to obtain a double knock-out pig some insight can be gained. Since pigs resemble humans in gastrointestinal physiology, dietary requirements and mucosal immunity, they have also been utilized as gnotobiotic models in studies involving rotavirus (Saif et al. 1996; Yuan et al. 2008), norovirus (Cheetham et al. 2006; Wang et al. 2006; Souza et al. 2007) and sapovirus (Wang et al. 2006), and both Heliobacter pylori (Krakowka et al. 1991) and Escherichia coli (Gunzer et al. 2003) infections. Therefore, the roles of humoral immunity in these and other infections, as well as in potential zoonotic infections [e.g. swine flu, Hepatitis E (Meng 2003)], can be addressed with the JH \u2212/\u2212 pigs (Butler et al. 2008, 2009).

We have shown the generation of a functional knockout of the HC locus herein. Further characterization experiments of this model are planned, and include evaluation of the stages involved in the B cell maturation block in the bone marrow of the JH \u2212/\u2212 pigs. Results would be expected to be similar to those reported for mice and humans, where it is known that an IgM knockout cannot ablate pro-B-cell generation (Kitamura et al. 1991; Jakobovits et al. 1993; Jung et al. 2006; LeBien and Tedder 2008). In addition, analysis of B and T cell numbers in blood, and in primary and secondary lymphoid organs will be performed, to confirm our findings and quantitatively show that targeting both alleles of the JH region of the porcine HC locus has no effect on T cells. Further studies include whether IVIG from wild-type pigs could rescue the JH \u2212/\u2212 pig\u2019s susceptibility to common bacterial pathogens, and finally, quantitative testing of the JH \u2212/\u2212 pig\u2019s immune system via challenge with T-cell dependent and T cell-independent vaccines, followed by analyzing subsequent cellular responses in comparison to wild-type pigs under gnotobiotic conditions. This would complete the validation of the JH \u2212/\u2212 pig model for aiding in vaccination strategies.",

            "text": "If B cell-deficient pigs are later constituted with the human Ig locus such that they develop B cells and secrete human Abs, much more significant value will be added; however, certain issues will have to be addressed. These include whether there will be proper communication between \u201chumanized B cells\u201d and porcine T cells so that T cell-dependent B cell responses and antigen-specific Ab production are realized. Also, since these animals likely would be reared in a conventional or Specific Pathogen- Free (SPF) environment to provide a practical source of IVIG, it remains unknown whether the human Abs produced in the pig will provide protection for the pig in such environments. Finally, significant purification steps during isolation of the humanized Abs will be required (as for any transgenic protein production system), to avoid any contamination with other porcine proteins or the potential horizontal transfer of zoonotic agents. Proof of concept for human Ig locus recombination in other species in production of \u2018humanized\u2019 Abs has already been provided, including mice and cattle (Lonberg et al. 1994; Nicholson et al. 1999; Tomizuka et al. 2000; Kuroiwa et al. 2009). Mice lack sufficient blood volume to make \u2018humanized mouse IVIG\u2019 practical. Pigs have several advantages over cattle, including shorter gestation length and time to puberty, and being large litter bearing provide a significantly larger blood volume to utilize per generation. In addition, a more efficient genetic engineering strategy can be utilized to generate the genetic platform. The latter is due to the fact that the pig only has one functional HC locus to target, and the targeted disruption of the porcine kappa (Ramsoondar et al. submitted) and lambda light chains is well underway. Therefore, 100% of all Ab produced in the pig would be fully human, generating more Ab overall and requiring less costly and less difficult purification processes. High volume, pathogen-free, fully-human IVIG from genetically-modified pigs could improve current IVIG immunotherapy by alleviating safety and supply issues, and targeting production to specific viral infections (HIV, hepatitis C, SARS, Ebola, swine flu, etc.), antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections (e.g. MRSA) and biowarfare agents (e.g. Anthrax, Smallpox, etc.) (Waltz 2006; Butler et al. 2009).",
