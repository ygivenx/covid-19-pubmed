The 5\u2032 two-thirds of the genome are occupied by ORF1a and ORF1b, which encode nonstructural proteins. The 3\u2032 one-third of the genome contains genes which encode the spike (S, 150\u2013220 kDa), envelope (E, 7 kDa), membrane (M, 20\u201330 kDa), and nucleoprotein (N, 58 kDa) separately. There is also a nonstructural ORF3 gene between S- and E-protein encoding regions.",

PED was first reported in Belgium [3] and the United Kingdom [4] in 1978. It has subsequently been reported in many other swine-producing countries throughout the world. The presence of PED in China was confirmed by the immunofluorescence assay and serum neutralization test in 1984 [5]. PED has spread and become widely prevalent in some countries and regions of Asia in recent years [6\u201310]. It also outbroke in China during 2010\u20132011 [11\u201313]. Pigs of all ages exhibited especially severe diarrhea and dehydration with up to 100 % mortality among suckling piglets. The pigs of Henan, Shanxi, Anhui, and Hebei provinces located in central China, of which breeding stock accounts for 25 % of the total pig population in China, were seriously affected and sustained great losses. Porcine intestinal tissues and fecal specimens were collected between October 2010 and December 2011 from 82 swine farms in the four provinces in central China. Among those farms, 51 samples were confirmed to be positive for PEDV by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In the present study, 15 representative samples from different area at different time were selected from 51 positive samples to investigate the molecular epidemiology and gene variation of PEDV in central China using sequence analyses of the M and ORF3 genes so as to determine the reason for the recurrence of this disease and provide recommendations for its prevention.",

In addition to playing an important role in the viral assembly process [14], the M protein induces antibodies that can neutralize virus in the presence of complement. The nucleotide sequences of M gene possess low identity with other coronavirus, but are highly conserved among PEDV strains. Nonstructural proteins encoded by the ORF3 gene of coronavirus closely relate to its pathogenicity. Highly adapted transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) and PEDV have sequence variations in the ORF3 gene and exhibit reduced pathogenicity [15, 16]. Wang et al. [17] has shown that the virulence to cells of PEDV was reduced by RNA silencing to inhibit the expression of ORF3 gene. Therefore, the ORF3 gene of PEDV has been suggested as an important virulence gene. The differences of ORF3 genes between the wild-type and attenuated type can serve as a marker of the adaption to cells of PEDV and as a potential tool to study molecular epidemiology [16]. Therefore, the M and ORF3 genes are often used to analyze the molecular epidemiology of PEDV [6, 10, 18].",

[6], PEDV became epidemic in immunized swine after 2006. Furthermore, as reported by Sun et al. [13], PED broke out in more than 10 provinces in South China and had caused more than one million piglets deaths since October 2010. Suspected PEDV-infected samples of feces and intestinal tissues, which were collected from 82 farms in Henan, Shanxi, Anhui, and Hebei provinces, were detected by duplex RT-PCR detecting TGEV and PEDV, which was developed in our laboratory. The result showed that the positive rate of PEDV was 62.2 % (51/82) and the positive rate of TGEV was 1.22 % (1/82). Furthermore, there was no co-infection of PEDV and TGEV (issued in another article). From these results, it can be deduced that the epidemic piglet diarrhea was mainly caused by single infection of PEDV, which was different from previous co-infections.",

The infection at the farm subsided gradually by vaccine immunization and artificial infection of all the sows using the feces of sick pigs. But, PED broke out again at the same farm after only 2 months. PEDVs isolated from the farm at different time were named as CH/HBXX2/11 in October and CH/HBXX3/11 in December.

Homology results show that the two PEDV strains have 100 % (100 %) nucleotide (deduced amino acid) sequence identities for the M gene and 99.9 % (100 %) nucleotide (deduced amino acid) sequence identities for the ORF3 gene, which show that the two PEDV strains are the same strain.
