This virus was first discovered in England in 1971 and was later identified as a member of Coronaviridae [1, 2]. PEDV causes severe diarrhea and dehydration, resulting in 100% morbidity and roughly 80% to 100% mortality in piglets [3\u20135]. Although great progress has been made in molecular epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of PEDV [6, 7], frequencies of outbreaks of this virus continue to rise, causing problems for the swine industry and for international trade. Indeed, outbreaks in the US and other countries have been caused by virus variants that are very similar to the Chinese AH2012 strain [8, 9], suggesting that global transmission is already underway.",

Subsequently, most research on this virus has been conducted using Vero and Marc-145 cell lines, which are derived from cells originally isolated from monkey kidney [10].

A model to investigate the interaction between porcine small intestinal epithelial cells and PEDV is badly needed to increase understanding of viral molecular mechanisms underlying virulence, pathogenesis and disease treatment. Recent study showed that IPEC-J2 from DSMZ (No: ACC701) and IECs from China can be infected with PEDV [11, 12], but still little is known about the interaction between porcine IECs and PEDV.",

Na+-K+-ATPase and Ca2+-Mg2+-ATPase are special proteins located within cell membranes that help to maintain ion balances inside and outside cells using ion transport [16]. Studies have revealed that abnormal functioning of ATPases precedes the occurrence of certain diseases, with abnormal degrees of enzyme dysfunction positively correlated with disease severity [17, 18]. PED clinical features, including watery diarrhea, dehydration and weight loss in pigs mainly result from interference with normal small intestinal function stemming from viral infection. Therefore, Na+-K+-ATPase and Ca2+-Mg2+-ATPase activities are likely to be relevant to PEDV pathogenesis and can be used as tools to study pathogenic mechanisms.",

In addition, piglets were shown to be negative for antibody specific for PEDV, as demonstrated using a TRM-556 PEDV ELISA Kit (Biovet, Saint-Hyacinthe, QC, Canada). Piglets were randomly divided into three groups designated group 1, group 2 and group 3. Group 1 and group 2 were orally administered 2 ml CV777 harvested at viral passage 10 in IEC cells or Vero cells, respectively, and were infected using the same virus dose of 106 per ml; group 3 pigs were given 2 ml of cell culture medium without virus. Clinical signs were observed daily and necropsy was performed at 4 days post-inoculation. Representative intestinal tissues were fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin wax using standard methods. The histological paraffin sections were then stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) to detect viral effects on piglet small intestinal mucosal layer thickness, villus length and villus/crypt (V/C) ratio, all of which were measured using Motic Images Advanced 3.0 software.",

Subsequently, PEDV was found to also infect Marc-145 (monkey kidney), PK-15 (pig kidney) and Huh-7 (human liver) cells efficiently when cultures were supplemented with trypsin; however, viral CPE and virus titers differed among various cell types [24]. Apparently, PEDV proliferation is complex in vitro and cellular host differences greatly influence the outcome of infection.

In most animal cells, Na+-K+-ATPases are cytoplasmic membrane glycoproteins that serve as carrier proteins involved in active transport of Na+ and K+ [23]. Ca2+-Mg2+-ATPases, another group of important enzymatic cytoplasmic membrane glycoproteins, also play a role in ion transport. Decreases in Ca2+-Mg2+-ATPase activity reduce ion transport across the membrane barrier, causing Ca2+ to accumulate in the cytoplasm that eventually leads to abnormal cell morphology, structure and function. As part of normal gastrointestinal tissue function, Na+-K+-ATPase and Ca2+-Mg2+-ATPase are key players that perform active transport-based maintenance of the protective barrier to resist tissue damage. Reduction in activities of ATPases leads to membrane ion pump dysfunction and abnormal Na+, K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ distribution, eventually resulting in gastric mucosal cell swelling and necrosis [25, 26].",

Ultimately, the use of in vitro IECs has allowed us to demonstrate that ATPase activities appear to be important for small intestine functional changes resulting from PEDV infection.

Since piglets exhibit watery diarrhea and dehydration post-PEDV infection, we studied Na+-K+-ATPase and Ca2+-Mg2+-ATPase activities in IECs and demonstrated significant alterations of Na (+), K (+) and Ca (2+) content that mirrored observed decreases in enzyme activities.
