For that study, adult volunteers were randomized to have either saline solution or saline solution containing filtered nasal secretions from individuals with \u201ctypical colds\u201d instilled in their noses. For the next 14 d, the study participants rated the severity of 12 symptoms of URI on a 0\u20133 scale. Those who received the filtered nasal secretions had significantly more severe symptoms than those receiving saline alone; a total symptom severity score of \u226514 was found to be the best cut-off value for defining a URI. This symptom scoring system, commonly referred to as the \u201cJackson score,\u201d continues to be used in studies on URIs in adults (9). Because the presence of some of the symptoms in the score, such as chilliness and myalgia, may be difficult to detect in preverbal children, the use of the Jackson score in pediatric studies may be limited. Other investigators have characterized symptom patterns in children and adults with known viral URIs (6,10,11). There has been little effort to differentiate symptoms among pediatric patients with a documented viral URI from those of children who have some features of a URI but in whom no virus is detected. Thus, there is a need for a validated symptom checklist, or prediction rule, that accurately predicts the presence of a community-acquired viral URI in children enrolled in clinical studies.",

Symptoms included sneezing, runny nose, nasal congestion, cough, fever, headache, malaise, chilliness, scratchy throat, sore throat, hoarseness, and myalgias. Each morning, for as long as symptoms persisted, parents were asked to rate the severity of each of these symptoms using the scale: 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe. An additional possible response was \u201ccan't tell,\u201d which was added because it was felt that it would be difficult for parents of young children to rate the presence and severity of some of these symptoms.

It is also possible that the utility of the symptom score would be different at another time when the distribution of circulating respiratory viruses is different. Subsequent investigation is needed to validate the URI symptom score that we developed. However, we purposefully incorporated a number of features into the development of the score that were designed to maximize its generalizability. First, rather than including symptom measures based solely on a statistical analysis, we modified the URI symptom score to have clinical \u201csensibility.\u201d The precision of the URI symptom score could have been increased in this particular population by weighting some symptoms (29). We chose the more conservative approach of giving equal weight to relevant symptoms to minimize the effects of statistical quirks of the data set. Finally, we only included symptom measures for which >90% of parents could adequately rate severity. Because measures included in the URI symptom score (significant runny nose and cough) are intuitively important, it is more likely that the score will perform similarly in other children than if a more complicated prediction rule had been developed.",
