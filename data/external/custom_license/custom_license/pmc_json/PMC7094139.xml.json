Because\nliposomes imitate the capabilities of cell membranes in several ways,\nthey have been widely utilized as model membranes to study the infection\nmechanisms of many pathogens at the biomembrane interface (Figure 1a).31 Research on the interaction between pathogens and liposomes\ncan be traced back to the 1960s, when Bangham et al. found that streptolysin-S is able to regulate the cationic permeability\nof multilayer liposomes.32 Following the\nearly mechanistic studies, researchers further applied liposomes as\npathogen substrates in the emerging infectious disease area. For example,\nliposome microarrays can be used for ultrasensitive detection of various\ntypes of pathogens including viruses, bacteria, and fungi.33 These cell-membrane mimics, consisting of synthetical\nlipids along with functional ligands, promote the formation of pathogen\u2013liposome\ncomplexes that effectively improve the detection sensitivity in various\nelectrochemical and immunological assays. Another example that utilizes\nthe liposome\u2013pathogen interaction is direct inhibition of the\npathogen infection with liposomes. The pathogens were trapped and\ndetained by cell-membrane-mimicking liposomes, thereby preventing\nthem from attacking their cellular targets.34 In viral and bacterial infection models, treatment with functionalized\nliposomes was demonstrated to improve subject survival as well as\nto reduce the overall infection.34,35 Engineered\nliposomes have also been used as a secondary therapeutic to supplement\ntraditional anti-infective drugs. Systemic administration of nanoscale\nliposomes along with penicillin effectively protected animals from S. pneumoniae- and S. aureus-caused septicemia.36 Moreover, researchers\nhave also exploited the liposome\u2013pathogen interaction for infection-triggered\ndrug release. Motivated by targeting therapeutic drugs to the specific\nsite, pore-forming toxins are able to bore holes on the synthetic\nliposomal vehicles, resulting in the selective release of vancomycin\nat the infection sites.37 Surface engineering\nof liposomes with specific molecules may further promote the applicability\nof synthetic liposomes against infectious diseases. Magee et al., for instance, successfully modified liposomes with\nantiviral antibodies for effective protection against coxsackie A-21\nvirus infection.38 With the rapid developments\nof biotechnology and nanotechnology, the physical and chemical properties\nof phospholipid bilayers may be tuned finely to improve their efficacy\nin various anti-infection applications.",
