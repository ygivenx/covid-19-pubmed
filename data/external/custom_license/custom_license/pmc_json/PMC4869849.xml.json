The study was approved by the Kenya Medical Research Institute Ethics Review Committee and the Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee. IE from three parasite isolates were separately stained with 10 \u03bcg/mL DAPI, 200 \u03bcg/mL ethidium bromide or 6.7\u00d7 SYBR Green I for one hour at room temperature. The stained parasites were washed five times, mixed in equal proportions, and diluted to a 5% haematocrit in incomplete RPMI medium. Ten \u03bcL of the parasite mixture was rotated with 2.5 \u03bcL of adult plasma for 1.5 h at room temperature, and agglutinates formed were examined by fluorescence microscopy. In the primary screen, pools of five adult plasma were tested against six Kenyan isolates (in two separate reactions). Pools that formed mixed-color agglutinates were identified and individual plasma within these pools were tested against nine isolates using the same assay. A single isolate (10668) was not detected in mixed agglutinates formed by any of the plasma and was therefore excluded from the study. Two adults (donors C and D) with plasma that formed mixed agglutinates with eight parasite isolates were selected for monoclonal antibody isolation and, following further informed consent, an additional blood sample was taken from each individual in February 2014.",

Cell lines were routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination. The antibodies were affinity purified by protein A chromatography (GE Healthcare). Variants of the MGD21 antibody were produced by i) exchanging VH, DH, JH elements or the light chain with the corresponding sequences of an irrelevant antibody (FI499, reactive to influenza virus28), ii) deleting selected segments, or iii) reverting somatic mutations to the germline configuration with reference to the IMGT database and the original LAIR-1 genomic sequence (NCBI Reference Sequence: NC_018930.2). In addition, LAIR-1-Fc fusion proteins were produced recombinantly by cloning the mutated or unmutated LAIR-1 fragment into a plasmid designed for expression of human IgG1 fusion proteins (pINFUSE-hIgG1-Fc2, Invivogen). Based on an alignment of the most potent LAIR-1-containing antibodies with the unmutated LAIR-1 sequence, five key residues that could contribute to gain of binding to IE and loss of binding to collagen were identified and added alone or in various combinations to the unmutated LAIR-1-Fc fusion protein. The MGD21 constructs and LAIR-1 exon mutants were tested for staining of 3D7 IE that were enriched for MGD21 recognition (3D7-MGD21+). For the LAIR-1 exon mutants, MFI values at 1 \u03bcg/mL antibody concentration were calculated by interpolation of binding curves fitted to a linear regression model (Graphpad Prism 6).",
