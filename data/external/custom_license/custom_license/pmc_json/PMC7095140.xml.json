To answer this, the species' basic reproductive number, R0, is measured by the average number of offspring per capita that survive to reproductive age. For a directly transmitted infectious disease, be it polio, smallpox, SARS, HIV/AIDS or some newly emerging pathogen, R0 is the average number of infections produced by an infected individual in a susceptible population2. If R0 is less than one, a self-sustaining epidemic is not possible (at least without further pathogen evolution). If R0 exceeds one, then although early stochastic fluctuations may extinguish the invader, an epidemic is possible. If R0 is large, an epidemic is virtually certain.",

These results may be appreciated intuitively. For a given value of R0, high heterogeneity in infectiousness implies that relatively few individuals are responsible for most of the transmission \u2014 or conversely, that many individuals do not transmit at all. In turn, such small numbers tend to generate pronounced stochastic fluctuations in the initial stages of the epidemic. Consequently, a heterogeneously infectious emerging disease will be less likely to generate an epidemic, but if sustained, the resulting epidemic is more likely to be explosive. Thus, it is dangerous to underestimate a disease on the basis of frequent \u2018failed\u2019 attempts, as exemplified by bird flu.",

Control efforts should aim to identify the highly infectious superspreaders, and target vaccination or other interventions at them.

Furthermore, Lloyd-Smith et al. distinguish between individual-specific and population-wide control measures (for example isolating individual patients as opposed to advising an entire population to reduce the behaviours associated with transmission). They show that individual-specific strategies are more likely to exterminate an emerging disease than population-wide interventions, because the former increase heterogeneity in infectiousness.",

Earlier research on contact patterns led to a generalized theorem (ref. 2; equation 12.23), which was based on the following reasoning. We can estimate the proportion, p*, to be vaccinated or otherwise treated in order to eradicate infection in a homogeneous population (p*=1\u22121/R0). However, if we take advantage of the heterogeneity, and target the more infectious or more sexually active individuals (depending on the disease), then we can achieve our aim by treating a smaller proportion than is estimated by p*, as echoed in the results of Lloyd-Smith and colleagues. This general result, first discovered in the epidemiological literature in the mid-1980s, also applies to the structure of information-technology networks in relation to targeted versus random \u2018viral\u2019 attacks12.",

Given that contact rates govern the likelihood both of becoming infected and of passing on infection, models based on heterogeneous contact rates have assumed perfect correlation between infectiousness and susceptibility. Consider HIV/AIDS, where in the simplest case R0=\u03b2Dc, with \u03b2 being the transmission probability (a measure of the infectiousness of an infected individual), D the duration of the infectiousness, and c the average rate at which new sexual partners are acquired. Heterogeneities among individuals with respect to \u03b2 or in D do not directly affect R0 as such: the quantities \u03b2 and D enter the dynamic equations linearly, and the appropriate values for estimating R0 are just the simple averages.",

Consequently, the epidemiologically appropriate \u2018average partner-acquisition rate\u2019, c, is not the mean of the distribution, but rather the mean-square divided by the mean. An incorrect result is obtained for R0 when the average of the partner-acquisition or contact distribution is used. (This observation, incidentally, helps explain how large geographical variation in HIV incidence can arise from differences in the tails of such distributions.) In contrast, Lloyd-Smith et al. evaluate heterogeneity in overall R0 (integrating all contributing factors), and assume that infectiousness is not correlated with susceptibility.

In the case of sexually transmitted diseases and contact patterns, however, Cohen et al.13 formulated a seemingly paradoxical method for achieving this aim, without directly identifying the active individuals. This procedure is based on the realization that one's contacts will on average be more highly connected within a contact network than oneself, simply by virtue of being a contact. Thus, highly connected individuals can be identified for intervention by first picking individuals at random, and then selecting randomly among their acquaintances. In this way, highly connected individuals are identified with minimal effort. Moreover, this procedure can be carried out either before or after an outbreak.",
