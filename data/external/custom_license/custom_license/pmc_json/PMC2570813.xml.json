NC_006450) by using Primer Express 3.0 software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). All probes were labeled at the 5\u2032 end with 6-carboxy-fluorescein and quenched at the 3\u2032 end with Black Hole Quencher-1 (Biosearch Technologies, Novato, CA, USA). Different primer and probe combinations were evaluated, and the 2 PCR assays that gave the best performance were selected for further studies (Table 1). Assays were performed by using the iQSupermix Kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) in 25-\u03bcL reaction volumes. Amplification was performed on an iCycler iQReal-Time Detection System (Bio-Rad) by using the following cycling conditions: 95\u00baC for 3 min for 1 cycle; 95\u00baC for 15 s and 55\u00baC for 1 min for 45 cycles each. Total nucleic acid was extracted from all specimens by using either the NucliSens Automated Extractor (bioM\u00e9rieux, Boxtel, the Netherlands) or the automated BioRobot MDx (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturers\u2019 instructions. Each clinical specimen was also tested for the human ribonuclease P gene to measure nucleic acid integrity as previously described (5).",

Recombinant plasmids were then isolated by using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (QIAGEN) and quantified by UV spectroscopy.

A suicide-nested PCR method for APM detection has been reported (3); however, the quicker turnaround time and lower risk for amplicon contamination makes the real-time PCR method more attractive for screening large numbers of samples.",

However, seropositivity may reflect exposure to APM antigen rather than active infection, and the potential for nonspecific cross-reactions with the serologic assays used may have inflated the true prevalence of APM infection (6). In a separate report, a laboratory-acquired APM infection was linked to acute pneumonia by seroconversion in a technician in Marseille, France, thus providing evidence that this virus can occasionally cause clinical disease (7). However, using sensitive real-time PCR assays, we failed to detect APM DNA in 496 respiratory specimens from 9 epidemiologically varied pneumonia patient populations.",
