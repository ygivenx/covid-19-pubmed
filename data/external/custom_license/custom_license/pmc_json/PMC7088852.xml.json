If a node is not in the communication area, the node will store the information and move to transmit it to the next-hop node [6]. There is no need complete link in opportunistic networks. The communication is accomplished by nodes movement. The information transmission in opportunistic networks is diffused. This feature makes the opportunistic network can be adopted in Mobile Health [7]. Persons store health information and transmit them among each other by mobile devices.

In wait step, messages are transmitted to the target node to fulfill the process of transmission unless there is no available node can be found in spray step. This method is a modified algorithm which improves the flood-transmission.

That is to say, there are a great mount of neighbors which consume much overhead and energy by source nodes. Hence this algorithm may cause nodes death by over spraying of the source nodes.",

In Spray and wait (Fig. 13a), a great number of space in transmission are occupied by Image data report, over 98 % space are transmitted Image data packets in Spray and wait. Because nodes accept data packets in order, each node must receive all image data packets from its neighbors. So much space are wasted. In Fig. 13b, the condition is better than Spray and wait, because in Binary spray and wait, only a half of data packets are transmitted from neighbors to nodes. Each node can receive many type of data packets. In Fig. 13c, we can see that many kind of EMR are occupied in transmission more average. Only 40 % space are transmitted Image data packets in ADTRA. According to ADTRA, much more EMR can be transmitted between nodes.\n",
