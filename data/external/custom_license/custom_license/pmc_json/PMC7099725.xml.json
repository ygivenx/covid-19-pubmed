            "text": "Recent severe disease outbreaks caused by enveloped viruses, such as Ebola,\nsevere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome\n(MERS), and avian influenza H5N1 have heightened fears of an imminent deadly\nviral pandemic. The major transmission routes of these viruses involved\ndirect person-to-person contact or indirect contact with contaminated\nobjects.1,2 Human enveloped viruses are often presumed to exist\nin low concentrations in human excrement and undergo rapid inactivation in\naqueous environments; however, several lines of evidence suggest these\nassumptions are not always correct. The genes of coronaviruses and avian\ninfluenzas have been detected in the feces of infected\nindividuals,3\u22129 and\nsome enveloped viruses were measured in wastewater biosolid\nresiduals.10 Likewise, some enveloped viruses can\nsurvive for days to weeks in pasteurized wastewater.11\u221213 A review of virus\nT90 values (i.e., time to reach 90% inactivation) suggests\nthat avian influenza viruses survive just as long, if not longer, than\nnonenveloped enteric viruses in some aqueous environments.14 Based on this information, it is therefore feasible that\nsewage and fecal-contaminated water could serve as vectors for certain\nenveloped viruses. Indeed, a SARS coronavirus outbreak in an apartment\ncomplex in Hong Kong was attributed to the transport of viruses in\nwastewater to the air ducts.15",

Due to the major role of water and food in the\ntransmission of enteric viruses, there are a number of established methods\nfor nonenveloped enteric virus detection in complex environmental matrices.\nEnveloped viruses differ structurally from nonenveloped viruses due to the\npresence of a lipid bilayer membrane outside the viral protein capsid, which\ncontains proteins or glycoproteins. The different functional groups on the\nouter surface of enveloped viruses compared to nonenveloped viruses likely\nimpact their survival and partitioning behavior in aqueous\nenvironments.22\u221224 Likewise, methods to concentrate and recover\nnonenveloped enteric viruses from wastewater and other environmental\nmatrices may not be suitable for enveloped viruses.
