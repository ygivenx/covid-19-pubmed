Laboratory-confirmed acute Q fever cases were defined as: a positive C. burnetii DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test and/or the presence of IgM phase II and/or IgG phase II antibodies [screening by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; Serion ELISA classic, Institut Virion\\Serion GmbH, W\u00fcrzburg, Germany) and confirmation by IFA \u22651:32 (Fuller Laboratories, Fullerton, CA, USA)] [14]. In addition, laboratory-confirmed community cases of acute Q fever subsequently notified to the regional Public Health Service between March 2009 and April 2010 received a questionnaire with questions on age, sex, and specific symptoms within days following the laboratory diagnosis. In March 2012, all farm and community cases who had earlier returned the questionnaire were selected for participation in our study, following approval by the Medical Ethical Committee of the Maastricht University Medical Centre (reference number: 10-4-034).",

The IFN\u03b3 pathway is believed to be crucial for the host defense against this intracellular pathogen [16, 18], as well as other intracellular bacteria, like Mycobacterium spp. [10, 19\u201321], but has also been associated with outcomes of, for example, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [11], respiratory syncytial virus infection [22, 23], and gastroenteritis episodes [24]. Consequently, it is reasonable to assume that polymorphisms in the IFNG gene and that of its receptor will modulate the IFN\u03b3 host pathogen (C. burnetii) interaction process [6]. A previous study by Vollmer-Conna et al. showed a significant influence of functional polymorphisms in the IFNG loci (rs2430561) on the severity and duration of illness after infection with several pathogens, including C. burnetii [12]. Vitamin D stimulates the innate immune response, but suppresses the adaptive immune response and is important in immunity to tuberculosis, diabetes, and respiratory syncytial virus [25\u201327].",

The Dutch community control group consisted of 1,008 persons, of which 55 % was male.

A dose-dependent association was found for this A-allele with susceptibility to SARS [11].

With respect to disease severity, however, significant associations of the T-allele with a more severe acute sickness response to infection have been reported previously [12, 32].

The first observation is that, surprisingly, symptom severity appeared to be much higher in population 2 compared to population 1, based on symptom scores and hospital admission rates (21 vs. 2 %). A possible explanation could be recall bias in study population 1, as participants were asked in September 2007 about their symptoms between 7 May 2007 and 8 July 2007. Nevertheless, the difference in symptom scores seems too large to be solely explained by recall bias in population 1. Furthermore, self-reported hospital admission rates seem highly unlikely to be affected by recall bias.",

A high C. burnetii dose in the environment is likely to lead to a higher probability of symptoms (i.e., a higher attack rate), even in less susceptible individuals. A dose-dependent attack rate has earlier been described for Salmonella infections in humans [33, 34]. A similar relationship for C. burnetii is suggested by experimental animal data [35], and a human dose\u2013response model for C. burnetii was recently published as well [36]. Evidence from these studies suggests that higher doses may be likely to overrule the immune system of the exposed person, resulting in an increased probability of illness. This hypothesis, in the light of the findings from our study, leads us to presume that a high dose will not only cause symptoms in the genetically susceptible individuals, but also in those genetically less prone to symptoms. In other words, the effects of heterogeneity in host susceptibility are diminished or even extinguished. Although we cannot exclude some influence of recall bias on our results of population 1, we presume that a higher C. burnetii dose was present in population 2 in 2009 compared to population 1 in 2007. Modeling studies investigating human exposure might give more insight in this hypothesis.",

This may be due to a loss in statistical power because of excluding a large number of subjects from our analysis. Besides, the question remains as to whether the criteria we used for exclusion was a good measure for high exposure, even though it was the best available option in our study.",

It can, therefore, be questioned whether the reported symptoms can be ascribed to other respiratory tract infections. Although the two outbreaks took place in different years, both occurred as seasonal peaks in spring (April\u2013June), which corresponds to the main lambing season in goats [37, 38]. Influenza, however, mostly occurs in winter and the incidence in spring was low in both years in the Netherlands [39]. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that other respiratory diseases played a major role in the two populations used for this study.",
