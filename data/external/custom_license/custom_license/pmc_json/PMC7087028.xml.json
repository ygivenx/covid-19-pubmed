The genome contains two large open reading frames (ORFs), 1a and 1b, encoding replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab, respectively. Four other ORFs encode a spike protein, an envelope protein, a membrane protein, and a nucleocapsid protein, and ORF3 is an accessory gene. The spike (S) protein is a type I glycoprotein that consists of a signal peptide, an ectodomain carrying neutralizing epitopes, a transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic domain [2, 6\u201310]. It is an important viral surface glycoprotein that mediates receptor binding and virus entry [2]. Some important epitopes of the S protein induce the production of neutralizing antibodies [6, 7, 9].",

It also plays a critical role as a carrier and adjuvant of coadministered antigens [15] and facilitates bypassing of mucosal epithelial cells. Consequently, antigen-specific lymphocytes migrate from the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue to the peripheral mucosal tissue via the circulatory system.",

They are used in vaccine development to express foreign antigens because of their nonintegrating episomal gene expression and transduction ability [16]. The most common adenoviral vectors are lacking the E1 and/or E3 coding regions, making them replication defective [17\u201319] because the E1A protein is required for adenovirus replication. The E1A protein is involved in the expression of approximately 20 delayed-early genes in the E1B, E2, E3, and E4 units and alter the expression of cellular genes [18]. The p53 suppressor induces apoptosis in cells by mechanical damage and environmental stressors. The E1B protein inhibits p53-dependent apoptosis and protects the viral and cellular genome to provide optimal conditions for virus production [18, 20]. As a result, E1-deleted adenoviruses are replication defective and replicate only in cells that contain the E1 region of the adenovirus genome, such as human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells [19].",

The rAd-LTB-COE vaccine elicited a robust humoral immune response at 14 dpi, and high antibody levels were maintained throughout the experiment. In a previous study, Tuboly et al. constructed a recombinant adenovirus type 5 carrying the full-length S gene of TGEV, which induced high levels of antigen-specific IgG in the sera of immunized pigs with a mean of 7 log2 at 21 dpi [16]. Higher titers of specific IgG with a mean of 8 log2 in sera of mice immunized with rAd-LTB-COE at 42 dpi were observed in this study. Furthermore, rAd-LTB-COE induced significantly higher levels of IFN-\u03b3 in immunized mice at 28, 35, and 42 dpi than were found in the K vaccine group. In a study by Wang et al., mice were orally immunized with Lc expressing a fused protein of a dendritic-cell-targeting peptide and COE that induced up to 1.7 pg of IFN-\u03b3 per ml [36]. Our candidate vaccine induced significantly higher amounts of IFN-\u03b3 (~ 100 pg/ml) in the supernatant of splenocyte cultures.

Ideal mucosal vaccines against PEDV need to be designed to promote both mucosal and systemic immunity. Primary protection is achieved through sIgA antibodies [25]. sIgA is more resistant to the proteolysis in the intestinal tract and neutralizes PEDV infections better than IgG or IgM [37]. In this study, rAd-LTB-COE induced significant titers of specific sIgA in the feces of immunized mice. The levels of specific sIgA in the feces of mice intramuscularly or orally immunized with rAd-LTB-COE were significantly higher than those in the K vaccine group. Our results are consistent with a previous study in which a fusion protein of LTB and COE could induce high levels of specific sIgA in the mucosal tract [35]. In addition, the rAd-LTB-COE oral group showed higher sIgA titers than the intramuscular group, which could be explained by enhanced mucosal immunity in the oral cavity and the digestive tract, as described by Song et al. [37]. These results suggest that the recombinant adenovirus expressing the LTB-COE fused protein is a novel vaccine strategy for protection against PEDV.",

Sows immunized twice with a DR13-based vaccine produced neutralizing antibody titers in the sera with means of 5 log2 against homologous PEDV [37]. Immunization with Lc expressing a fused protein of a dendritic-cell-targeting peptide and COE in BALB/c mice could raise neutralizing antibody titers against PEDV to a mean of 4.6 log2 [36]. A study by Lin et al. [38] showed that commercial vaccines based on the PEDV strain CV777 or DR13 failed to protect piglets against challenge with a field strain. In our study, neutralizing antibodies induced by rAd-LTB-COE in BALB/c mice neutralized both the PEDV genogroup I SM98 and the emerging genogroup II HID9051, with mean titers of 5 log2 and 3.6 log2, respectively. This indicates that the neutralizing epitope sequence (amino acids 490\u2013790) of the S protein and high levels of the anti-S antibodies provide better protection against PEDV infection. In summary, rAd-LTB-COE induces strong humoral, mucosal, and cell-mediated immune responses in BALB/c mice.",

The results showed that rAd-LTB-COE could induce humoral as well as cell-mediated immune responses in piglets. rAd-LTB-COE vaccination also produced higher titers of IgA in the serum than the H vaccine. Furthermore, rAd-LTB-COE induced the production of neutralizing antibodies against PEDV SM98 and HID9051 at levels similar to those induced by the H vaccine. This could be explained by the similarity in the amino acid sequences of their S proteins, which play a critical role in the production of neutralizing antibodies [6, 7, 9]. These results illustrate that rAd-LTB-COE has good immunogenicity not only in BALB/c mice but also in piglets. Further studies in neonatal piglets farrowed from the sows vaccinated with rAd-LTB-COE are needed to assess the effect of maternal immunity and to evaluate the protection against PEDV infection in challenge experiments.",
