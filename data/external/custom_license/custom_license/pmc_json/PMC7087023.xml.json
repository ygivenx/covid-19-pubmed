A total of 26 countries in the world have been affected, including countries in the Middle East (Egypt, Iran, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Yemen), Africa (Algeria, Tunisia), Europe (Austria, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Turkey, the United Kingdom), Asia (China, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand) and North America (United States) (http://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/). So far, all cases of MERS have been linked through travel to or residence in countries in or near the Middle East. Generally, the Middle East is the primary region where MERS-CoV originates, circulates and is exported. In contrast, since the first report of SARS-CoV in China in 2003, a total of 8096 SARS cases, including 774 deaths, have been reported to WHO. These have involved 19 countries, predominantly in South East Asia, with only one case identified in Kuwait in 2003, and no cases were found in the Middle East since then (http://www.who.int/csr/sars/country/table2004_04_21/en/). The fatality risk for MERS-CoV is much higher than that for SARS-CoV, which has a CFR of 9.6 % [9, 24]. Furthermore, the CFR for patients with co-morbidities is greater (60 % in MERS vs. 46 % in SARS) than those without pre-existing diseases [49]. Generally, the CFR is attributed to both host factors and virus factors (e.g. virus replication and mutation) and local medical expertise [3, 14].",

            "text": "One unique common epidemiological characteristic of these two diseases is that the spread of both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infection has been largely driven by human-to-human transmission in healthcare settings [25]. Failures in infection prevention and control in healthcare settings have occasionally resulted in large numbers of secondary cases in nosocomial outbreaks. The earliest identified nosocomial MERS outbreak was traced back to March 2012 from clusters of severe respiratory illness among healthcare personnel (HCP) in Jordan [43]. Since then, a series of nosocomial MERS outbreaks in small numbers have been identified in the Middle East (Jordan in 2012, Saudi Arabia in 2014\u20132015) [1, 6, 10, 18, 36]. In 2015, the largest known outbreak of MERS outside the Middle East occurred in the Republic of Korea; as of 19 June 2015, 186 laboratory-confirmed cases, including 36 deaths, had been reported. This outbreak was associated with a traveller returning from the Middle East (http://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/about/index.html). Although the genome sequences of MERS-CoV isolates from the Republic of Korea are similar to those isolated from the Middle East (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/mers/briefing-notes/update-15-06-2015/en/), the epidemiology of MERS in South Korea is very different to that observed in the Middle East. On the one hand, a MERS-CoV isolate that was responsible for an outbreak in South Korea showed a higher transmissibility than other previous MERS-CoV isolates. The epidemic thus far has undergone four generations of infectious events in South Korea through nosocomial super-spreading episodes [11]. On the other hand, an overall CFR of only 19.4 % (36/186) in hospital-based outbreaks in South Korea is substantially lower than the overall CFR of cases, most of which originate in the Middle East [38 % (444/1163); 65.2 % (15/23)] [1, 6]. To date, it is not clear what has caused the observed differences between the CFRs of South Korea and the Middle East.",

The CFR of this latter outbreak was also much higher than that of one extended family cluster (10.5 % [2/19]) in Saudi Arabia in 2014 [4]. These results demonstrate that the survival rate of clustered patients with MERS-CoV in Korea was higher than in the Middle East. There are several possible explanations for the observed differences between the CFRs in South Korea and the Middle East. First, there may be disparities in national surveillance and available expertise [30]. Second, the CFR for the Middle East might have been overestimated because a large number of mild and asymptomatic cases are likely to go undetected there [37]. Third, it is possible that primary cases accounted for a higher percentage of the cluster patients in the Middle East than in South Korea [36].",

Our results showed that the median age in fatal cases was much higher than that in nonfatal cases. This is in agreement with a Saudi Arabian case series report that showed individuals older than 65 years had a greater association with mortality. A multivariate logistic regression model estimated that for every 1-year increase in age, the odds of dying increased by 12 % [29]. In all, this indicates that older age is associated with death in cases of MERS-CoV infection [12, 17, 44]. In particular, the median age in fatal HCP cases was also much higher than that in nonfatal HCP cases, but lower than the overall average. This is in agreement with the findings of Liu et al. [25]. The reasons for the higher fatality rates in older individuals are not understood but have been attributed to cultural practices that result in an increase in the exposure risk that older people are willing to take [37]. In addition, older people may be more likely to smoke and to have underlying diseases and impaired immune functions, which may increase susceptibility and progression of infections and even increase the chance of death [45].",

Our findings showed that the percentage of HCP infections in MERS clusters was much higher than in sporadic cases [32.4 % vs. 10.7 %]. The recent outbreak in Jeddha demonstrated that the CFR among HCPs was only 3.7 % (4/109) [43]. Our findings suggest that the HCP-specific CFR was much lower than the overall CFR in both the Middle East [4.2 % vs. 25.9 %] and South Korea [3.2 % vs. 19.4 %]. However, the CFR of MERS in HCP has been reported to be up to 15.4 % (2/13) in four healthcare facilities of Saudi Arabia [7]. In total, the fatality risk for HCP was significantly lower than the overall fatality risk in the Middle East and South Korea. These findings can be attributed to three facts: first, the majority of HCP developed asymptomatic or mild symptoms and moderate symptoms [15]; second, HCP were confirmed as secondary cases under medical investigation, which led to earlier confirmation and good outcomes [32]; third, epidemiological analysis showed that HCP were much younger and had fewer co-morbidities compared to total MERS cases [36].",

Similar to the Middle East, this study showed that the odds of dying were four times higher for individuals with concurrent health conditions than for those without these conditions in South Korea. The odds of fatality were much lower than those estimated by the logistic regression model (seven times) [29]. This is in part due to higher viral loads in the respiratory tract and longer shedding in patients with underlying diseases compared to cases without co-mortalities [33, 49].",

Spread was assumed to occur largely via large droplets and contact [36]. Our study indicated that the percentage of human-to-human transmission in nonfatal cases was slightly higher (92.9 % vs. 64.2 %) than in fatal cases in MERS clusters, and two reasons could explain this: first, the survivors in secondary cases were younger and had fewer co-morbidities [11, 19, 20, 29, 38]; second, most of the secondary cases were under medical investigation, and therefore, the infection could be confirmed early once symptoms were observed, making timely treatment possible [16, 19, 20, 23, 36, 39, 42]. Overall, human-to-human transmission seems to have had a positive effect on the outcome of the secondary cases from the MERS nosocomial outbreaks in the Middle East. Rapid diagnosis and providing supportive care may be of marginal consequence in the MERS clusters [25, 29].",

In the Middle East, the median time from onset to confirmation in fatal cases (8 days) was clearly longer than in nonfatal cases (4 days). In South Korea, however, there was no difference in the median time between fatal and nonfatal cases. This is consistent with other retrospective studies of MERS virus infections [6, 30, 36]. Furthermore, the time between suspected symptom onset and laboratory confirmation (6.5 days) in the fatal clusters was also slightly longer than the overall average [38]. In particular, this finding indicated that delayed confirmation is a high-risk factor for human nosocomial outbreaks with MERS-CoV in the Middle East.",

            "text": "In conclusion, the overall CFR for nosocomial outbreaks in the Middle East was much higher than in South Korea. However, the mortality risk factors for MERS infections in the Middle East were similar to those identified for nosocomial outbreaks in South Korea. Older age, underlying diseases and delayed confirmation were the major risk factors for fatal outcome in human nosocomial outbreaks. In contrast, person-to-person transmission was associated with a good outcome for secondary cases during nosocomial outbreaks. Interestingly, gender, exposure history and median days were not indicators of death with MERS nosocomial outbreaks. The severity of nosocomial outbreaks and the risk of fatal infection in HCP were significantly lower than the overall rate in the Middle East and South Korea. nosocomial outbreaks of MERS-CoV infection are associated with knowledge deficits, unrecognized disease, insufficient infection control measures, poor compliance, and an overwhelming number of patient cases [21, 22, 34, 40, 45]. Therefore, early and rapid detection of suspected cases, especially in older people and HCP, along with appropriate infection control practices, education and timely preparedness, are important strategies to reduce nosocomial transmission and to improve the clinical outcome in health settings in the future [8, 27, 31, 35].\n",
