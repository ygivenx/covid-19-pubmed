            "text": "During December 2013\u2013January 2014, specimens of small intestine or feces were collected from 10 pigs that had watery diarrhea; each of the pigs lived at a different swine farm in South Korea. All samples were prepared as 10% suspensions as described elsewhere (10) and subjected to reverse transcription PCR using a Transmissible Gastroenteritis and Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Detection Kit (iNtRON Biotechnology, Seongnam, South Korea) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The full-length spike glycoprotein sequences of 10 PEDVs identified from the pigs were subsequently determined as previously described (10) and deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers shown in Figure 1. In addition, the complete genome of a PEDV strain, KNU-1305, was sequenced and analyzed. The 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the KNU-1305 genome were determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends as described elsewhere (11). Ten overlapping cDNA fragments were generated to encompass the entire genome, pooled in equimolar amounts, and subjected to next-generation sequencing as previously described (12); the sequencing reads were assembled by using complete PEDV reference genomes from GenBank (13,14). The KOR/KNU-1305/2013 PEDV sequence data were deposited in GenBank under accession no. KJ662670. The sequences of 46 fully sequenced spike genes and the 21 complete genomes of PEDV strains were independently used in sequence alignments and phylogenetic analyses as described elsewhere (10).",

The similarity between the spike genes was determined; sequence homology results are described in the Technical Appendix. Nucleotide sequence analysis showed high homology (98.8%\u201399.9%) among the 10 tested isolates. In contrast, the isolates all shared only 94.3%\u201394.7% nt sequence identity with a previously sequenced field isolate from South Korea, KNU-0801. However, the sequences of the 10 isolates were compared with those of other published PEDV strains and found to consistently share 99.2%\u201399.9% nt identity with recently emergent US strains.",

All 10 PEDV strains from South Korea were classified into subgroup 2b and most closely clustered together with the recent US strains in an adjacent clade with the same subgroup, suggesting that the US strains may be the origin of the recurrence of PEDV infections in South Korea. Subsequent phylogenetic analysis of the S1 protein showed the grouping structure was the same as that in the spike gene\u2013based tree (Figure 1, panel B). In addition, phylogenetic analysis based on the entire genome sequences demonstrated that strain KNU-1305 is grouped within the same cluster with the US stains (Figure 2).",

            "text": "Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analyses indicated that the South Korean PEDV isolates in this study differed genetically from previous isolates from South Korea and were most genetically similar to PEDV strains emerging in the United States during 2013. Therefore, our data suggest that the recent strains from South Korea might have originated from the United States, likely by the importation of pig breeding stock during or after the sudden emergence of PEDV in the United States. However, it remains unclear whether the US strain\u2013like PEDVs had existed in South Korea before the emergence of PEDV in the United States. Our retrospective study, using PEDV-positive fecal samples obtained during early 2013 (KNU-1301\u201303), verified the presence of a PEDV isolate (KNU-1303) in South Korea in May 2013 that was placed in the same clade as the US strains (Figure 1). Thus, it is also conceivable that the strains may have already been present in South Korea as a minor lineage before the recent emergence of PEDV in the United States. Given that situation, the virus could have evolved independently by recombination, or the virus could have originated directly from China and have subsequently become dominant, leading, under suitable circumstances, to the current acute outbreak in South Korea.",

In addition, the existence of distinct PEDV lineages in South Korea suggests the potential for recombination events between different PEDV lineages or sublineages and possible cocirculation of different PEDV subgroups. During the 2010\u20132011 foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks, more than one third of the total pig population in South Korea was slaughtered, and since then, the importation of breeding pigs has greatly increased. However, the vaccination program for PED prevention in South Korea was not fully implemented before this importation began. Thus, it is not unexpected that the pig population appears to have a low level of immunity against PEDV and, as a result, large-scale outbreaks of PED could occur. To prevent the periodic recurrence of acute PEDV outbreaks in South Korea, a proper vaccination program should be implemented to enhance overall immunity to the virus in all stock, and strict biosecurity measures should be established. In addition, current quarantine procedures should be adequately reinforced with respect to breeding stock imported from the United States. Our findings will provide insights into a better understanding of the genetic diversity of PEDV strains and contribute to the development of more effective preventive measures against PED.",
