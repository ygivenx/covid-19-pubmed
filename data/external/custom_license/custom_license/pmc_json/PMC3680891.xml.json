It was first described in the early 18th century as uncommon presentation of measles and small pox. Little is known about the incidence throughout the world but in USA may be approximately 1.5\u20133/100,000. ADEM is more common in the winter months and 80% of childhood cases occur in the first decade of life.[12]",
