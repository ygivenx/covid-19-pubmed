Latent virus particles rest as covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) in the neurons of the peripheral nervous system. Upon reactivation, the virus migrates down through the axon to peripheral tissue, leading to localized lesions of the skin and mucus membranes (Field and Vere-Hodge 2013). HSV-2 is the most prevalent infection worldwide (Caldeira et al. 2013), and in recent years its recurrence has remarkably increased (Richman et al. 2010).",

ACV is a synthetic nucleoside analogue, converted by the virus into an active form. The virus uses the active form of ACV instead of the nucleoside to synthesize DNA, a critical component of viral replication. Incorporation of active ACV into new viral DNA stops production of the viral genomic DNA. Resistance to drugs such as ACV has been increasingly reported. These observations underscore the importance of discovering new therapeutic tools for the treatment of HSV infections (Bacon et al. 2003).",

            "text": "Anti-HSV compounds of which their efficiency was validated in vitro are continuously reported in the literature. Todorov et al. (2010) have shown that a bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus faecium ST5Ha can inhibit the HSV-1 and has no toxicity to the tissue cells. Drannik et al. (2013) described the anti-HSV activity of trappin-2 and elafin, serine protease inhibitor. Chono et al. (2012) demonstrated the anti-HSV activity of ASP2151 by targeting the helicase\u2013primase complex of HSV-1 and HSV-2. Besides, many studies outlined the antiviral activity of probiotic strains. Related to this, Boti\u0107 et al. (2007) unveiled the potential activity of probiotic lactobacilli against vesicular stomatitis viruses (VSV). This study shows that antiviral activity is due to the direct interaction between probiotic strains and enveloped virus. Attempts to use probiotics as antiviral agents may be a promising alternative (Chono et al. 2012). Probiotic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and bifidobacteria support immune system\u2019s function and balance and contribute to immuno-modulatory effects in combating microbial pathogens, including viruses. The herpes infection is recurrent and can be reactivated at any time (Field and Vere-Hodge 2013). Acyclovir can be potent only in the reactivation stage, and for these reasons the prevention of this type of infection is of major importance in the sector of public health (Caldeira et al. 2013). Taken together, these data indicate that the need of alternative strategies and probiotics could offer various advantages. The vaginal microflora usually designed as vaginal lactobacilli is the first line of defence against a large variety of microbes (Al Kassaa et al. 2014a, b). The inhibitory potency of vaginal lactobacilli can be exerted through different mechanisms including the aggregation and production of anti-microbial compounds (Al Kassaa et al. 2014b). Related to this, lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide and bacteriocins constitute the main anti-pathogen arsenal produced by vaginal lactobacilli (Al Kassaa et al. 2014a). Conti et al. reported that the anti-HSV-2 activity of L. brevis was originated by a molecule other than lactic acid and H2O2 (Conti et al. 2009). Mastromarino et al. (2011) showed that another strain of L. brevis exerted anti-HSV-2 activity by a heat-resistant and non-protein cell surface component. Subsequent to these findings (Mastromarino et al. 2011), Khani et al. (2012) showed that L.\nrhamnosus enhanced macrophage viability in elimination of HSV-1, while Zabihoullahi et al. (2012) reported that supernatants from different lactobacilli inhibited HSV replication.",

The monolayer cells were washed five times with sterile PBS, and the adhesion score was determined by counting the adhered bacteria within 20 random microscopic fields after Giemsa staining (Jacobsen et al. 1999). Bacteria were grouped into three categories: non-adhesive (\u226440 bacteria), adhesive (41\u2013100 bacteria) and highly adhesive (>100 bacteria). The percentages of adhesion were determined by plating MRS agar plate followed by colony counting after 48 h of incubation.

The DMEM lactobacilli supernatants were mixed and incubated with viruses prior to infection step. Further, L. gasseri CMUL57-, L. acidophilus CMUL67- and L. plantarum CMUL140-derived neutralized supernatants enhanced slightly the viability of Vero cell monolayer inoculated with 100 PFU HSV-2 with about 9.5, 5.4 and 2.4 %, respectively, due to reduction in viral infectious particles. These data are normalized to HSV-2 alone used as a control (Table 2). This very weak inhibition prompted us to investigate whether the anti-HSV-2 activity of lactobacilli was exerted through an interaction between bacteria and HSV-2 particles. Thus, L. gasseri CMUL57 at 108 CFU/ml or Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium (DMEM, negative control) were incubated for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C in CO2 atmosphere in the presence of HSV-2 (104 PFU/ml) or CVB4E2 (103 TCID50/ml). Afterwards, supernatant was collected by centrifugation (20,000 g, 3 min, 4 \u00b0C) and assayed on Vero cells. After the treatment, the number of infectious HSV-2 particles was significantly reduced (15,000 vs. 100,000 PFU/ml P = 0.01), whereas that of CVB4E2 remained unchanged as compared to the control (9.8 102 TCID50/ml) (Fig. 5b, c). To be noted that the pellet was washed three times with DMEM in order to eliminate any free residual viral particles in the mixture. After each washing, the supernatants were assayed on Vero cells monolayers to evaluate the level of free infectious particles. After the final washing step, DNA was extracted from the pellet and the final supernatant to test by qPCR the presence of the viral particles trapped with L. gasseri CMUL57. Thereof, the cycle threshold of the control assay was 26.2 \u00b1 0.8 for 1000 PFU, and that of the pellet was 24.2 \u00b1 0.9 (Fig. 5d). In contrast, the detection of HSV-2 DNA in the final washing supernatant was almost negative (Fig. 5d).\n\n",

HSV-2 is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections, acting further as a potential risk factor for acquiring other sexually transmitted infections (Chopra et al. 2013). Here, we demonstrate the anti-HSV-2 potential of L. gasseri CMUL57, L. acidophilus CMUL67 and L. plantarum CMUL140 that were recently isolated from human vagina and characterized for their large antagonism and probiotic characteristics (Al Kassaa et al. 2014a). The highest anti-HSV-2 activity was observed for L. gasseri CMUL57. Recently, Zabihoullahi et al. (2012) showed the anti-HSV-2 activity of another vaginal L. gasseri strain. These two independent studies utilized live and non-live L. gasseri, respectively, and revealed the capabilities of these lactobacilli to inhibit HSV-2. Further, the absence of cytotoxicity of LAB probiotics is a prerequisite before undertaking any antiviral study. L. gasseri CMUL57, L. acidophilus CMUL67 and L. plantarum CMUL140 used in this study are shown to be not cytotoxic for Vero cells. Safety of Bifidobacterium adolescentis SPM 0214 was established on Vero cells (An et al. 2012), and that of E. faecium on porcine macrophage cell line (Wang et al. 2013). Remarkably, virus inactivation by LAB probiotics has unveiled at least two main pathways (Al Kassaa et al. 2014b). The first one is linked to the production of inhibitory metabolites such as lactic acid, bacteriocins and hydrogen peroxide that are endowed with antiviral activity (Conti et al. 2009). Here, this possibility is discarded because the assays conducted with the supernatants gathered from L. gasseri CMUL57, L. acidophilus CMUL67 and L. plantarum CMUL140 cultures revealed either slight or absence of anti-HSV-2 activity. However, the anti-HSV-2 activity attributed to molecules of a other than H2O2 and lactic acid bacteria was reported for L. brevis CD2, L. salivarius FV2 and L. plantarum FV9 isolated from human vagina (Conti et al. 2009). The impact of lactic acid produced by vaginal lactobacilli was shown to interfere with the negative charges of the viral envelopes, enhancing their sensitivity and provoking ease virus inactivation (Tao et al. 1997).",

            "text": "The second possibility of virus inactivation by LAB probiotics is thought to be exerted through a physical contact between bacterial cells and virus envelope (Al Kassaa et al. 2014b). The data obtained here agree with this concept, as we show that L. gasseri CMUL57 strain is active against enveloped virus (HSV-2), but not against naked one (CBV4E2). Interestingly, co-incubation of HSV-2 and L. gasseri CMUL57 experiments as well as the qPCR one let us to think that HSV-2 particles were indeed present in the bacterial pellet, and the absence of their infectivity could result from trapping/binding mechanism. In direct line, Tao et al. (1997) showed the capabilities of lactobacilli to trap human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by binding the mannose sugar-rich \u201cdome\u201d of their attachment glycoprotein gp120. Ivec et al. (2007) reported the trapping and adsorption of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) by Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species. Lai et al. (2009) indicated that the trapping of HIV by vaginal lactobacilli rendered the diffusion of HIV very slower than in the normal conditions. Recently, Chai et al. (2013) showed the attachment of the enteropathogenic coronavirus to the surface of E. faecium, which might be a means to trap viruses and prevent infection. Wang et al. showed that E. faecium inhibited influenza viruses by mechanisms including a direct physical interaction and strengthening of innate defence at the cellular level (Wang et al. 2013). The use of LAB probiotics as antiviral agents was reported as promising approach for aquaculture (Lakshmi et al. 2013) and poultry industry (Seo et al. 2012) because viral diseases cause an enormous loss in the production in shrimp farms (Lai et al. 2009), and avian influenza virus occurrence is responsible of severe losses to the poultry industry (Seo et al. 2012).",
