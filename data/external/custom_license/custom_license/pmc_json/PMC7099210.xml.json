            "text": "Streptococcus pyogenes, also known as group A Streptococcus (GAS), is responsible for a variety of highly communicable infections, including acute pharyngitis (sore throat) [1, 2]. GAS infection is a major healthcare burden, accounting for 5\u201315 and 20\u201330% of sore throat hospital visits in adults and children, respectively [3]. Untreated GAS infection can lead to life-threatening diseases such as acute rheumatic fever and acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis [4, 5]. Because S. pyogenes has remained fairly susceptible to broad-spectrum antibiotics, patients with GAS infections are often treated with antibacterial agents such as penicillin or amoxicillin [3]. However, the clinical signs and symptoms of streptococcal pharyngitis are similar to those of non-streptococcal pharyngitis, particularly viral pharyngitis [6]. Consequently, clinicians rely on laboratory tests to confirm or exclude GAS, make appropriate treatment decisions, and avoid unnecessary use of antibiotics.",

            "text": "Common laboratory methods for identification of GAS pharyngitis include culture of bacteria or rapid antigen detection tests (RADTs) using material obtained from throat swabs. Throat culture remains the most prominent method, but has a relatively long turnaround time (TAT) of 1\u20132 days. RADTs offer significantly shorter TAT and can be performed in low-resource or point-of-care settings. However, in comparison with the throat culture method, RADTs have inadequate sensitivity, between 70 and 90% [7\u20139]. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommendations, children with negative GAS RADT results should be retested for S. pyogenes by throat culture [5]. Due to their superior sensitivity in comparison with RADTs, nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), e.g., real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), have recently been introduced for identification of GAS infections [10]. However, the TATs of NAATs are still significantly longer than those of RADTs, and are limited to specialized laboratories because of the requirement for sophisticated instrumentation. NAATs with a rapid TAT could aid in timely diagnosis of S. pyogenes, thereby improving patient care and treatment decisions.",

Our NAAT is based on a novel isothermal nucleic acid amplification method called strand invasion based amplification (SIBA) [11, 12]. SIBA utilizes a recombinase-coated, single-stranded invasion oligonucleotide (IO) to separate the target duplex. Gp32 and UvsX are key proteins required for performing SIBA reactions. Gp32 abolish the formation of secondary structures within the IO, enabling UvsX to cooperatively bind the IO. The UvsX-IO filament complex catalyzes the strand separation of the homologous target duplex enabling target-specific primers to bind and extend the target via DNA polymerase. These events subsequently lead to an isothermal exponential amplification of the target nucleic acid (Fig. 1). The method was capable of detecting S. pyogenes within minutes and exhibited high analytical sensitivity and specificity.",

The sensitivity and specificity of the GAS SIBA assay relative to the reference GAS PCR assay were 100% (95% confidence interval [CI] 85.7\u2013100.0) and 100% (95% CI 85.1\u2013100.0), respectively, indicating that the GAS SIBA assay is highly specific and sensitive, with performance similar to that of NAAT reference methods. The GAS SIBA assay had a significantly faster detection time than the PCR reference method (Fig. 4): the average time to positive results for the GAS SIBA was 8 min, whereas the reference PCR assay took around 90 min to obtain a positive result (cycle threshold [Ct] = ~ 27).\n",

Consequently, timely diagnosis of GAS infection plays an important role in improving patient care and limiting the inappropriate use of antibiotics. Due to their short TAT and ease of use, RADTs have been used to facilitate rapid detection of S. pyogenes. However, due to their inadequate sensitivity, negative results obtained by RADT still require further confirmation by culture [5]. NAATs offer superior sensitivity over RADTs but have longer TATs. Furthermore, due to their requirement for skilled personnel and large instruments, the use of NAATs is often confined to large central laboratories. Rapid NAATs with high analytical performance could facilitate prompt diagnosis of GAS infection, improving patient care and clinical decision-making.",

Moreover, it could detect as few as ten copies of S. pyogenes DNA within 13 min of starting the reaction, significantly faster than previously reported NAATs. This short TAT was achieved in part by optimization of the magnesium concentration and reaction temperature. The GAS SIBA assay was functional at a wide range of magnesium concentrations (5\u201330 mM). Magnesium ion is an important cofactor for the recombinase and DNA polymerase used in SIBA, and is also an important cofactor for the DNA polymerase used in PCR. The presence of trace amounts of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid or other ions (e.g., calcium) originating from specimens or extraction inhibits PCR reactions [18], either by chelating or competing with magnesium ions required by the DNA polymerase. In PCR, the optimal concentration of magnesium is usually between 1 and 3 mM, whereas higher concentrations can be inhibitory [19, 20]. Therefore, PCR reactions can easily be inhibited by specimens containing small amounts of chelating agents or competing ions. By contrast, because SIBA is tolerant to high levels of magnesium, residual amounts of chelators or competing ions would have minimal effects on the reaction. Thus, SIBA reactions may be more tolerant to inhibitors than the PCR method. Furthermore, because the GAS SIBA assay is functional over a wide range of temperatures (37\u201348 \u00b0C), highly accurate temperature-controlled instruments are not necessary for SIBA reactions.",
