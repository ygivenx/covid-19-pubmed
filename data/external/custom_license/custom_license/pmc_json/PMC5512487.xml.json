She had no history of rash, head trauma, drug ingestion, travel abroad, or contact with animals. Her vaccination record was up to date. Her 3 older siblings were healthy. On examination, she was irritable and febrile (temperature 39\u00b0C), with tachypnea, tachycardia, and photophobia. On lung auscultation, a few crackles were heard on the right side. The rest of her physical examination, including a bedside undilated fundoscopic examination, was unremarkable. Blood tests, cerebrospinal fluid examination, and neuroimaging studies were conducted (Table). Results of renal and liver function and metabolic screening tests and serum calcium, troponin T, immunoglobulins, and total complement levels were within reference limits. Diagnostic test results were negative for respiratory viruses including influenza A(H1N1) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and for herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2. A chest radiograph showed right middle lobe haziness suggestive of pneumonitis.",

Hia meningitis is strikingly reminiscent of Hib meningitis, manifesting as a serious illness mostly in otherwise healthy children 6\u201324 months of age (1,4,5). Hia has been reported to be the most virulent among encapsulated H. influenzae after Hib; the genetic structure of virulent Hia strains closely resembles that of virulent Hib strains with respect to the duplicated arrangement of the capsule locus and, in some cases, partial deletion of the IS1016-bexA gene locus (5\u20137; Technical Appendix Table). An active hospital-based surveillance study for meningitis during 1996\u20132007 in Salvador, Brazil, reported that Hia and Hib meningitis occurred mainly among children <5 years of age; case-fatality rates were higher than those for meningitis caused by types e and f and NTHi strains, which occurred in older age groups and tended to have a better prognosis (6). The study observed an association between IS1016-bexA deletion and poor clinical outcome of Hia meningitis.",

With documentation of 3 cases (including the case reported here) of Hia meningitis in the Eastern Mediterranean Region within <2 years (8), more than a decade after Hib vaccine implementation, it is crucial to monitor meningitis in children within the region, complemented by laboratory characterization of incoming specimens by molecular methods for rapid, accurate information on all H. influenzae serotypes and NTHi (1; https://www.cdc.gov/meningitis/lab-manual/full-manual.pdf; Technical Appendix Table). In Oman, it is mandatory to report cases of Hib meningitis within 24 hours of laboratory diagnosis, and those caused by other serotypes and NTHi within 1 week, to the Department of Communicable Disease Surveillance and Control, Ministry of Health. Evidence of capsule-deficient variants of Hia that cannot be differentiated from NTHi by conventional methods (7) and recurrent invasive diseases (9,10) and outbreaks caused by Hia (9; Technical Appendix Table) emphasize the necessity for continued surveillance, strong laboratory support, and local epidemiologic studies on non-b H. influenzae disease.",
