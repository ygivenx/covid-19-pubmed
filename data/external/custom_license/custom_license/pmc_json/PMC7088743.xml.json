In Thailand, Khamrin et al. (2008) detected 8.3 % (6/72) of faecal samples positive for the Aichivirus B. The present study found 18 % (40/222) of faecal samples positive for this enteric picornavirus. Studies in other countries describe the presence of Aichivirus B as a common enteric pathogen of cattle. The virus was present in 4.9 % (7/142), 37.2 % (32/86), 77.8 % (7/9) of the faecal samples evaluated in Italy (Di Martino et al. 2012), South Korea (Jeoung et al. 2011), and the Netherlands (Barry et al. 2011), respectively. In this study Aichivirus B was detected in 20.9 % (38/182) of the faecal samples from calves \u226460 days of age, while studies performed in South Korea found the Aichivirus B in 40.9 % and 66.7 % of samples from calves (Jeoung et al. 2011; Park et al. 2011). The high prevalence of infection in young animals can be explained by the fact that this virus belongs to the group of agents responsible for neonatal disease, which has also been observed in pigs, and the highest positive rate for Aichivirus C is found in piglets (Park et al. 2010; Ribeiro et al. 2013; Verma et al. 2013).",
