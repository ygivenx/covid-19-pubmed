It is the current standard and most widely used fractionation technique for serum proteins in clinical biochemistry and molecular biology (T\u00f3thov\u00e1 et al. 2018). Generally, serum protein electrophoresis is used for evaluation, diagnosis, and monitoring of a variety of diseases including chronic liver diseases, hepatic cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, \u03b11-antitrypsin deficiency, inflammatory bowel disease, amyloidosis, and multiple myeloma (T\u00f3thov\u00e1 et al. 2016). It can be also advised in patients with non-specific clinical symptoms, like depression, fever, weight loss, diarrhea, abdominal pain, or polyuria. Particularly, in ruminants, the most common use of serum protein electrophoresis is for the evaluation of the transfer of passive immunity via colostrum intake (T\u00f3thov\u00e1 et al. 2016). The fractions assessed after the separation of proteins in calves are albumins, a1-globulins, a2-globulins, \u03b2-globulins, and \u03b3-globulins (T\u00f3thov\u00e1 et al. 2016; T\u00f3thov\u00e1 et al. 2018).",

The determination of their concentration could provide useful information to the clinician towards the differential diagnosis list compilation (Bartosz and Katarzyna 2016). However, it has to be noted that the abnormalities observed in the protein profile of a patient may not only be related solely to the disease but also to physiological and to individual conditions (Elkhair and Hartmann 2014; T\u00f3thov\u00e1 et al. 2014). Concerning calves, especially during the neonatal period, it must be considered that they have to adapt to different environmental factors, after the intra-uterine life, including nutrition and the result is an intense morphological, functional, and biochemical change in their organism which may be reflected to their electrophoretic profile (Piccione et al. 2009). The data concerning the alterations on the electrophoretic profile in newborn calves are limited in the available literature. It is reported (Piccione et al. 2009) that in healthy newborn calves, the concentration of albumin progressively increases, the \u03b1-globulins decrease, and that \u03b2- and \u03b3-globulins remain stable during the first month of their life. However, at the same study, it was mentioned that there is no significant effect of time on the serum protein profile during the first week of life.",

This observation provides novel information concerning the pathogenesis and understanding of this syndrome as it indicates that serum immunoglobulins, which are considered as the main fraction of gamma globulins, are transferred to the intestinal lumen in order to counteract the infection. In accordance with this point of view are previous reports that diarrhea in calves is associated with a significant decline in serum immunoglobulins\u2019 concentrations (Balikci and Al 2014, Rocha et al. 2016). Furthermore, the transfer of IgG from the blood serum to the intestine is well defined in calves, at least as far as it concerns rotavirus antibodies (Besser et al. 1988a,b); this transfer has also been suggested as a significant mechanism of protection against rotaviral diarrhea (Besser et al. 1988a).",
