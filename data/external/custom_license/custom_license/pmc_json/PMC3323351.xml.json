This measure is vital for estimating the impact of control measures to reduce the transmission of SARS (4,5).

Priority group 3 variables (coexisting conditions; categories of symptoms; treatment status; ventilation or intensive care, including start date; and date of discharge) are not essential information for containing SARS outbreaks but provide additional information about healthcare resources (treatment and intensive care) used to treat SARS patients. Priority group 3 variables can also be used by hospital administrators and public health officials to plan and prepare for a sudden change in resource use during a catastrophic infectious disease outbreak (e.g., pandemic influenza) (6).",
