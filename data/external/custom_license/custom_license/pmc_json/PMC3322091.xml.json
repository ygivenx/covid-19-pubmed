The affected countries include Bhutan, Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand, and Singapore. In eastern and northern Asia, South Korea and Russia were also reported to be affected (2) (Figure). The epidemic affected not only large commercial farms but also the backyard industry, which created a serious problem for the global swine industry and for food safety. In February 2011, the Veterinary and Animal Breeding Agency in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, confirmed an outbreak of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) (3). Nearby neighbors, such as Japan, North Korea, Indonesia, and other Asia-Pacific countries, are also at risk.",

This new PRRS has spread throughout the swine industry in China, resulting in the culling of an estimated 20 million pigs annually in 2006\u20132007 in China (4).
