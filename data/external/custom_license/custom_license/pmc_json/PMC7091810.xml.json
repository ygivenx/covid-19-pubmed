Use of higher levels of respiratory protection may be considered for certain aerosol-generating procedures when treating confirmed or highly suspected SARS cases.Masks or respirators must be changed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Furthermore, the filtering efficiency of a mask is only as good as its fit or the moisture content. Therefore masks and respirators should be fit checked and always discarded if moist/wet.Eye protection and face shields are also recommended when there is a potential for splattering or spraying respiratory secretions.40Long cover gowns should be worn and sleeves secured under the gloves to prevent exposure of any part of the forearm.
