An automatic coloring tool for tree exploration has been proposed by Fua and co-authors:5,6 in order to explore a given taxonomy, leaves are considered as an ordered list of items (the order can result for example from the reading direction when the tree is displayed on a phylogram). Each node can then be related to a color according to a chosen LUT (Look-Up Table). The LUT may be locally stretched or compressed in order to focus on a given area. Such an interactive control of the LUT allows exploring the taxonomy while considering various depths. This approach suffers however from a major shortcoming: the leaf ordering is not unique (trees are invariant with respect to permutation of linked branches). Very different colorings can then result from various choices. Moreover, close colors can correspond to items that belong to different branches and somewhat different colors can rely to close species. These drawbacks can be observed in Figures 6 and 8.",

As a consequence, genomic signature appears qualifying the \u201cwriting style\u201d of the species. The genomic signature is species specific: it allows finding the species of origin of a DNA fragment with a fairly good efficiency.2,22 Note that because the genomic signature is stable along the genome, non-homolog fragments of species can be compared (homology is required for most other methods devoted to comparative genomics). Lastly, proximity between species in terms of genomic signature is known to be linked to evolutionary proximity. Indeed many phylogenies based on hierarchical classifications of signatures have been proposed.23\u201328 Another powerful approach to describe the taxonomic organisation of genomic signatures uses dimensionality reductions: data are embedded on a two-dimensional (or sometimes three-dimensional) space. These representations have been achieved by Principal Components Analysis (PCA),2,3 by Self Organising Map (SOM)29 or by Data-Driven High Dimensional Scaling (DD-HDS). 19 However, details of the spatial organisation of genomic signatures cannot be easily observed on a large dataset because of the limitation in term of discrete colors. In the following example we propose to visualise the taxonomic tree of species on the DD-HDS mapping of genomic signatures by means of the color code provided by ColorPhylo and Figure 7.",

Colors are provided by the ColorPhylo procedure (the map of species in the related taxonomic color-space is shown in Fig. 7): color proximity between items relies on taxonomic proximity between species. As a result, the various levels of taxonomy are simultaneously observable on a single figure (Fig. 9). The taxonomic organisation of signatures is clearly demonstrated.

We have observed on real life examples that the interpretation of the resulting color code is fully intuitive. In the first example, geographical origins of bananaquit birds are related to phylogenetic data in order to analyse the evolutionary history. However, because the number of items and the complexity of the dataset was somewhat low, Bellemain and co-authors succeeded in describe the relationships between taxonomy and geographical distribution in their publication (but at the price of more irksome work). When the size of the dataset and/or the complexity of their relationships increase, ColorPhylo can provide a critical benefit, as it can be observed for the second application. In that example, (genomic signature) colors express the membership of items to one of the three domains of life, with subtle shades showing subclasses. In both cases, we have instantaneously access to the structure of classification through an attractive visualisation plot.",

For example, if the organisation of the data results from an analysis based on a distance matrix (such as the ones performed by Neighbor joining,31 Fitch-Margoliash,32 \u2026), the original distance matrix may be preferred to the taxonomic distance (such an approach may have been implemented for the bananaquit birds dataset).
