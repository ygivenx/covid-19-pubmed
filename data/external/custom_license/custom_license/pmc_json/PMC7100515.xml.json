They are classified into four genera, alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV2. Since beginning of this century, there have already been three zoonotic outbreaks of beta-CoVs. In 2002\u20132003, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)3,4, a lineage B beta-CoV, emerged from bat and palm civet5,6, and infected over 8000 people and caused about 800 deaths7. In 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a lineage C beta-CoV, was discovered as the causative agent of a severe respiratory syndrome in Saudi Arabia8, currently with 2494 confirmed cases and 858 deaths9, it remains endemic in Middle East, and dromedary camel is considered as the zoonotic reservoir host of MERS-CoV. At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2, was found in patients with severe pneumonia in Wuhan, China10\u201312. Viruses were isolated from patients and sequenced. Phylogenetical analysis revealed that it is a lineage B beta-CoV and closely related to a SARS-like (SL) CoV, RaTG13, discovered in a cave of Yunnan, China, in 201313. They share about 96% nucleotide sequence identities, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 might have emerged from a Bat SL-CoV. However, the intermediate host or whether there is an intermediate host remains to be determined.",

Each monomer of trimeric S protein is about 180 kDa, and contains two subunits, S1 and S2, mediating attachment and membrane fusion, respectively. In the structure, N- and C- terminal portions of S1 fold as two independent domains, N-terminal domain (NTD) and C-terminal domain (C-domain) (Fig. 1a). Depending on the virus, either NTD or C-domain can serve as the receptor-binding domain (RBD). While RBD of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is located at the NTD14, most of other CoVs, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV use C-domain to bind their receptors15\u201319. MHV uses mouse carcinoembryonic antigen related cell adhesion molecule 1a (mCEACAM1a) as the receptor20, and the receptors for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2)21 and human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4)22, respectively. While S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 share about 76% and 97% of amino acid identities with SARS-CoV and RaTG13, respectively, the amino acid sequence of potential RBD of SARS-CoV-2 is only about 74% and 90.1% homologous to that of SARS-CoV and RaTG13, respectively. Recently, Zhou et al.13 reported that SARS-CoV-2 uses hACE2 as the receptor.",

A two-step sequential protease cleavage model has been proposed for activation of S proteins of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV24,25, priming cleavage between S1 and S2 and activating cleavage on S2\u2019 site. Depending on virus strains and cell types, CoV S proteins may be cleaved by one or several host proteases, including furin, trypsin, cathepsins, transmembrane protease serine protease-2 (TMPRSS-2), TMPRSS-4, or human airway trypsin-like protease (HAT)25\u201332. Availability of these proteases on target cells largely determines whether CoVs enter cells through plasma membrane or endocytosis. However, whether any of these proteases could promote virus entry of SARS-CoV-2 remains elusive.",

The construct was named SARS-CoV-2 S. HEK293T cells were transfected with SARS-CoV-2 S plasmid and expression of SARS-CoV-2 S protein was determined by western blot. There were two major bands, 180 kDa, and 90 kDa, detected by mouse anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Fig. 1b, lane 2), reflecting the full-length and cleaved S proteins, respectively. The band above 250 kDa likely results from dimeric or trimeric S proteins. Consistent with our previous report29, MERS-CoV S protein was detected by polyclonal goat anti-MHV S antibodies AO4 (Fig. 1c). AO4 also detected SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV S proteins, suggesting the presence of a conserved immunogenic epitope among all four different CoVs. This presumably linear epitope is likely in S229. S1 subunits of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share almost 64% in amino acid identities. Nevertheless, SARS-CoV-2 S protein was barely detected by rabbit polyclonal anti-SARS S1 antibodies T62 (Fig. 1d), suggesting that the major epitope(s) for T62 antibodies include non-conserved regions of S1. The SARS-CoV-2 S protein was not detected by either a monoclonal anti-SARS S1 antibody (Fig. 1e) or anti-MERS S2 antibody (Fig. 1f).",

            "text": "Next, we determined whether SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions were able to transduce human, monkey, and bat cells. VSV-G pseudovirons were used as a positive control, whereas bald particles with no spike proteins (mock) served as a negative control. As expected, all cell types were effectively transduced by VSV-G pseudovirons (Fig. 2a). Compared to mock control, SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions showed an over 500-fold increase in luciferase activities in Calu3 cells, at a level similar to SARS-CoV S pseudovirions (Fig. 2a). Huh7 and Vero 81 cells also gave about 10-fold increase in luciferase activities when transduced by SARS-CoV-2. Transduction of LLCMK2 cells was higher with SARS-CoV S pseudovirions than with SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions (Fig. 2a), suggesting that there might be some differences on virus entry on LLCMK2 cells mediated by S proteins between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. We then investigated whether any known CoV receptors might be used by SARS-CoV-2 S protein as entry receptor. The SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirons were used to transduce BHK cells stably expressing human aminopeptidase N (hAPN), the receptor for human CoV 229E, 293 cells stably expressing hACE2 (293/hACE2), the receptor for SARS-CoV, and HeLa cells stably expressing hDPP4 (HeLa/hDPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV. While BHK/hAPN and HeLa/hDPP4 cells were not susceptible for the transduction of SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions, 293/hACE2 cells were highly transduced by SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions, consistent with hACE2 as the receptor for SARS-CoV-213. We then determined whether SARS-CoV-2 S protein could directly bind to hACE2 protein. HEK 293T cells transiently expressing SARS-CoV-2 S protein were incubated with soluble hACE2 and analyzed by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 2c, SARS-CoV-2 S protein bound to soluble hACE2 at a level similar to SARS-CoV S protein, although the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) for SARS-CoV-2 S protein was slightly lower than SARS-CoV S protein. To further investigate if hACE2 is the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, we performed inhibition experiments using soluble hACE2. Soluble hACE2 proteins were pre-incubated with SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirons on ice for 1 h, then virus-protein mixture was added onto 293/hACE2 cells. Entry of SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions was significantly prevented by pre-incubation of soluble hACE2 at both 10 \u03bcg/ml and 50  \u03bcg/ml (Fig. 2d), further supporting the notion that hACE2 is the receptor and soluble hACE2 might be used as a therapeutic inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

Among them, one is phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P2), which regulates early endosome to late endosome dynamics33,34. Phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate 5-kinase (PIKfyve) is the main enzyme synthesizing PI(3,5)P2 in early endosome. HEK 293/hACE2 cells were treated with apilimod, a potent inhibitor for PIKfyve35. Inhibition of PIKfyve by apilimod significantly reduced entry of SARS-CoV S pseudovirions on 293/hACE2 cells in a dose dependent manner (Fig. 3b), whereas it had no effect on entry of VSV-G pseudovirions, which occurs in early endosomes. Similar inhibitory effects were observed when HeLa/hDPP4 cells and HeLa cells stably expressing mouse carcinoembryonic antigen related cell adhesion molecule 1a (mCEACAM1a) (HeLa/mCEACAM1a) were treated with apilimod and transduced with MERS-CoV and MHV S pseudovirions (Fig. 3b), respectively. Moreover, infection of live MHV on 17Cl.1 cells was also strongly inhibited by apilimod treatment (Fig. 3c). No significant cell toxicity was observed on apilimod at any concentration tested (Fig. 3c). We then determined whether apilimod could inhibit entry of SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions on 293/hACE2. As expected, apilimod treatment inhibited entry of SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions in a dose dependent manner (Fig. 3d). Similar effects were shown when 293/hACE2 cells were treated with YM201636, another PIKfyve inhibitor (Fig. 3e). These results suggested that PIKfyve might be a potential general drug target for viruses that enter cells through endocytosis. Two pore channel subtype 2 (TPC2) and TRPML1 in lysosome are two major downstream effectors of PI(3,5)P236. While blocking TPC2 activity by tetrandrine, an inhibitor for TPC237, decreased entry of SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions (Fig. 3f), treatment of cells with 130, a TRPML1 inhibitor, had no effect (Supplementary Fig. 1), indicating that TPC2, not TRPML1, is important for SARS-CoV-2 entry.",

To investigate whether cathepsins are required for SARS-CoV-2 entry, HEK 293/hACE2 cells were treated with either a broad inhibitor for cathepsin B, H, L, and calpain (E64D), cathepsin L inhibitor (SID 26681509), or cathepsin B inhibitor (CA-074). VSV-G pseudovirions were used as a negative control, since virus entry mediated by VSV-G does not require protease activation. E64D treatment of 293/hACE2 cells reduced entry of SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions by 92.5%, indicating that at least one of cathepsins or calpain might be required for SARS-CoV-2 entry (Fig. 4a). While cathepsin B inhibitor treatment did not show any marked effect on virus entry, cathepsin L inhibition treatment decreased entry of SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions into 293/hACE2 by over 76% (Fig. 4a), suggesting that cathepsin L should be essential for priming of SARS-CoV-2 S protein in lysosome for entry into 293/hACE2 cells.",

To test whether SARS-CoV-2 S protein cleaved by these cellular proteases could trigger syncytium formation, we overlaid HEK 293T cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 S or control proteins on 293/hACE2 cells in presence or absence of proteases. Expression of TMPRSS 2, 4, 11 A, 11D, and 11E on 293/hACE2 cells enhanced SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated cell\u2013cell fusion similarly to SASR-CoV S (Supplementary Fig. 2). Next we evaluated the role of trypsin. Consistent to our previous report23, addition of trypsin triggered syncytium formation on 293/hACE2 cells by SARS-CoV S protein after 4 h incubation (Fig. 4b, c). Large syncytia were formed at a level similar to SARS-CoV S proteins when SARS-CoV-2 S protein expressing 293T cells were added onto 293/hACE2 cells with trypsin. Of note, SARS-CoV-2, but not SARS-CoV, S proteins induced syncytia formation on 293/hACE2 cells even in the absence of trypsin (Fig. 4c), suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 S proteins could be triggered upon the receptor binding without exogenous protease priming or activation. During 2013\u20132016 Ebola virus outbreak, A82V and T544I mutations in glycoprotein (gp) of Ebola virus were linked to increase of virus transmissibility40\u201342. Further study showed that A82V and T544I mutation decreases the thermostability of gp while they increases virus infectivity in cell culture42. We then investigated the thermostability of SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Compared to SARS-CoV S protein, SARS-CoV-2 S protein was less stable, requiring significant shorter time and lower temperature to be inactivated (Fig. 4d, e). The native S protein is metastable, and there is an energy barrier that prevents it from undergoing conformational change before triggering, SARS-CoV-2 S protein might decrease its energy barrier by reducing its thermostability. This might contribute to high-transmission efficiency of SARS-CoV-2.",

            "text": "Since SARS-CoV-2 S reacted weakly with polyclonal rabbit anti-SARS S1 antibodies T62 in western blot (Fig. 1d), we investigated whether SARS-CoV-2 S protein in native conformation could be recognized by anti-SARS S1 antibodies T62. HEK293T cells transiently expressing SARS-CoV-2 S proteins were incubated with polyclonal anti-SARS S1 antibodies T62 and analyzed by flow cytometry. SARS-CoV S was used as a positive control. As expected, expression of SARS-CoV S proteins on 293T cell surface were readily detected by polyclonal anti-SARS S1 antibodies T62 (Fig. 5a). In contrast, only low level of binding of SARS-CoV-2 S protein to polyclonal rabbit anti-SARS S1 antibodies T62 was detected (Fig. 5a). To further delineate where the conformational epitopes for this polyclonal antibodies are located, two new constructs were generated, a SARS-CoV S protein backbone with RBD from SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV S/nRBD) and a SARS-CoV-2 S protein backbone with RBD from SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV-2 S/sRBD). Replacement of SARS-CoV RBD with SARS-CoV-2 RBD (SARS-CoV S/nRBD) decreased binding of polyclonal antibodies T62 to S protein, whereas substitution of SARS-CoV-2 RBD with SARS-CoV RBD (SARS-CoV-2 S/sRBD) increased the affinity of S protein to polyclonal antibodies T62 (Fig. 5a). All chimera proteins were expressed at levels similar to SARS-CoV-2 S protein (Fig. 5b, top panel). These results suggest that at least one major conformational epitope for polyclonal antibodies T62 might be located in RBD where the sequences differ between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 5c). Of note, while SARS-CoV-2 S/sRBD bound to polyclonal antibodies T62 better than SARS-CoV S/nRBD in flow cytometry, the signal for SARS-CoV S/nRBD was stronger than SARS-CoV-2 S/sRBD in western blot by polyclonal antibodies T62, indicating that major linear epitopes of polyclonal antibodies T62 were located on SARS-CoV NTD. Among residues in SARS-CoV RBD critical for receptor binding and virus entry43,44, seven of them are different between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs (Fig. 5c). We then mutated each of them in SARS-CoV S protein to the corresponding residues in SARS-CoV-2 S. With exception of SARS-CoV mutant Y442L, which had reduced protein expression (Supplementary Fig. 3), binding of SARS-CoV S mutants to polyclonal rabbit anti-SARS S1 antibodies T62 was not affected (Fig. 5d). This suggests that these residues might not be direct binding sites for polyclonal antibodies T62. Next, we tested whether polyclonal rabbit anti-SARS S1 antibodies T62 could inhibit entry of SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions. CoV S protein pseudovirions were incubated with polyclonal antibodies T62 on ice for 1 h, and their transduction was measured according to luciferase activities. As expected, polyclonal antibodies T62 neutralized SARS-CoV S pseudovirion effectively in a dose dependent manner (Fig. 5e). In contrast, even at a concentration of 50 \u03bcg/ml, polyclonal antibodies T62 did not have marked effect on transduction by SARS-CoV-2 S proteins (Fig. 5e).",

LLCMK2 cells, a rhesus monkey kidney epithelium cell line, exhibited different susceptibility to SARS-CoV S and SARS-CoV-2 S transduction, but the reasons for this are currently not known and require further investigation. Both S proteins use hACE2 as the receptor for binding and entry13,21, which we further confirmed by flow cytometry analysis and competitive inhibition experiment using soluble hACE2 in this study (Fig. 3b, c).

            "text": "Successful conformational changes of S proteins, leading to membrane fusion, not only require receptor binding, but also need appropriate protease activation. There is a furin site between S1 and S2 (amino acids 682-685, RRAR) subunits in SARS-CoV-2 S protein, similar to what happens in high-pathogenic influenza viruses. Whether the presence of this furin site has any effect on viral pathogenesis and virus spreading among humans remains to be determined. Although majority of SARS-CoV-2 S proteins in pseuodvirions were cleaved, endocytosis is the main entry pathway on 293/hACE2 cell. In our experiments, lysosomal cathepsin L, not B, appeared critical for SARS-CoV-2 S protein activation, similar to what was reported for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV28,29,50. Trypsin could also activate SARS-CoV-2 S protein efficiently and induce large syncytium formation. To our surprise, we found that, even without trypsin, SARS-CoV-2 S protein could trigger syncytium formation on 293/hACE2 cells, a phenomena similar to what was observed in MHV S protein in certain aspect51. This led us to speculate that SARS-CoV-2 S protein is capable of triggering protease-independent and receptor-dependent syncytium formation. Such a mechanism might enhance virus spreading through cell\u2013cell fusion and this might partially explain rapid progress of the diseases10,11. However, we have not excluded a potential role for other endogenous proteases in HEK293T cells for syncytium formation and we have also not evaluated entry into other cell types. This requires further research.",

Further analysis reveals that major immune-epitopes for T62 antibodies likely lie in the region of RBD (Fig. 4a). We further evaluated cross-neutralization of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 using convalescent sera from SARS and COVID-19 patients. We only saw moderate cross-neutralization activities between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV convalescent sera, suggesting that those previously recovered from SARS-CoV infection may not be fully protected against SARS-CoV-2 infection, and vice versa.",
