            "text": "To determine setting-specific MERS acquisition rates at KFGH, we conducted a retrospective cohort study among KFGH patients treated in the ED, inpatient areas, or dialysis unit. The cohort comprised all patients who did not have symptomatic MERS when first treated in 1 of these 3 settings. For ED and inpatient areas, we counted patient-days from the first date of treatment until MERS symptom onset, discharge, or study period end; for the dialysis unit, we estimated patient-days as explained in the Hemodialysis Unit subsection. A cohort study case was defined as onset of RT-PCR\u2013confirmed MERS-CoV infection within 2\u201314 days of treatment in >1 of these 3 settings. We excluded 1 patient who had symptom onset the day after admission because the incubation period would have been <2 days after first exposure to KFGH. For patients treated in >1 of the 3 settings, we determined the most probable setting and week of acquisition based on the assumption that the incubation period followed a log-normal distribution with mean 5.2 days and SD \u00b11.7 days as described by Assiri et.al. (5) (Tables 1, 2). Other published incubation period estimates (mean 5.5 days, SD \u00b12.5 days [13]; and mean 6.8 days, no SD provided [14]) were used in sensitivity analyses. We calculated incidence rates as cases per 10,000 patient-days, rate ratios, and mid\u2013p values. To support these calculations, we used maximum-likelihood modeling to provide additional estimates of infection rates and 95% CIs (Technical Appendix).",

When we looked for MERS exposures outside of KFGH among the 50, we found that 1 had an outpatient contact with a known MERS patient and 1 had been admitted to a different hospital for a non-MERS illness. When we looked for documented opportunities for patient-to-patient transmission, we found that only 2 MERS patients were known to have been in the same room as an infectious patient while hospitalized at KFGH. Thirty-two of the cohort study MERS patients were exposed to only 1 setting in the 2\u201314 days before symptom onset; of these, 14 (44%) were exposed only to the ED, 10 (31%) to inpatient areas, and 8 (25%) to the dialysis unit. When all 50 were categorized according to the probable site of acquisition, acquisition was attributed to the ED for 22 (44%), inpatient areas for 17 (34%), and the dialysis unit for 11 (22%).

We were able to directly track transmission (i.e., an infectious and a susceptible patient in the same room) only to 5 cases: 2 in inpatient areas and 3 in the dialysis unit. However, most of these persons had several days (median 6.5) of treatment in KFGH before MERS onset (Figure 1), strongly suggesting that they acquired MERS at KFGH. In addition, we were able to determine setting-specific infection rates and found that they were similar in the ED, inpatient areas, and dialysis unit, indicating that risk for acquisition was widespread. Treatment in >1 setting of many of these patients complicated determination of these setting-specific rates. However, the 2 methods we used to overcome this problem, most likely site of acquisition and maximum-likelihood modeling, provided good agreement.",

The KFGH outbreak peaked during week 6 and decreased sharply after week 7 (Figures 2, 3) after infection control improvements in the ED during week 6. During week 8, infection control was improved in the dialysis unit, and a MERS unit was established in a separate building.

Thus, as indicated in a recent laboratory-based study (15), KFGH appears to have been an early focus of transmission in the Jeddah outbreak. Our cohort study reported higher incidence among older patients at KFGH, suggesting that clinically recognized disease did not develop in certain younger patients who were exposed to MERS-CoV infection at KFGH. Although we did not study HCW-to-patient transmission, asymptomatic HCWs were documented and might have contributed to disease transmission.

We assumed that patients treated at KFGH at any time during the 2\u201314 days before illness onset had potentially KFGH-acquired disease.

The contribution to MERS-CoV transmission at KFGH by asymptomatic persons is uncertain; transmission by asymptomatic persons is an area that needs further study. Heightened awareness of MERS, aggressive triaging of patients, prompt isolation, and strict infection control measures were associated with a rapid decrease in transmission.
