Laboratory tests performed at the primary practice identified marked hypercalcemia (serum total calcium concentration). Despite treatment with IV fluids and potentiated amoxicillin, the cat deteriorated clinically, prompting referral. On presentation to the QMHA, the cat was dull but responsive with poor body condition (3.5/9) and pyrexia (39.2\u00b0C; 102.6\u00b0F). Firm white lingual plaques were observed (Fig 1). Both kidneys were subjectively mildly enlarged. The remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable. With the exception of the cat's decreased mentation, neurologic examination was considered normal. No neurologic deficits suggesting a structural intracranial lesion were found at any point throughout the time the cat was hospitalized, but the level of obtundation would wax and wane. No association between the cat's mentation and the treatments administered was apparent.",

Plasma ionized calcium concentration gradually decreased from 9.0 mg/dL to 7.44 mg/dL 24 hours after admission, whereas blood urea nitrogen and creatinine concentration increased to 142.6 mg/dL (50.9 mmol/L) and 3.0 mg/dL (268 \u03bcmol/L), respectively. The azotemia was believed to be at least partly prerenal, because it gradually resolved over the next 48 hours, with concurrent decreases in packed cell volume and total protein concentration (from 30% and 6.4 g/dL to 20% and 5.4 g/dL, respectively). During the first 3 days of hospitalization, treatment included IV fluid therapy (up to 8 mL/kg/h by the second day), furosemide1 (0.5\u20131.0 mg/kg IV q6h), and salmon calcitonin2 (4 IU/kg SC q8h), all of which were initiated on the first day of hospitalization. Furosemide probably contributed to dehydration and development of azotemia, supported by a 100 g (4.8%) decrease in body weight over the first 24 hours. Owing to persistent hypercalcemia despite treatment, IV pamidronate3 infusion (1.75 mg/kg diluted in 16 mL 0.9% NaCl, infused at a rate of 4 mL/h) was administered on the third day of hospitalization, at which time salmon calcitonin was discontinued. These treatments failed to substantially alter the plasma ionized calcium concentration, but approximately 48 hours after initiating prednisolone4 treatment (0.5 mg/kg PO q12h) on day 6 of hospitalization, plasma ionized calcium concentration was within normal limits (4.76 mg/dL; 1.19 mmol/L). Plasma ionized calcium concentration subsequently increased to 6.04 mg/dL (1.51 mmol/L) and remained at that concentration for the remainder of hospitalization.",

            "text": "Thorough investigations did not identify an underlying cause for the hypercalcemia. Plasma parathyroid hormone (PTH)5 concentration was 10 pg/ml (RI, <40 pg/mL; sample obtained at the time of ionized hypercalcemia), whereas plasma PTH\u2010related protein (PTHrP)6 concentration was equivocally increased (14.25 pg/mL; 1.5 pmol/L; RI, <9.5 pg/mL). Plasma PTHrP concentrations >20.9 pg/mL are considered suggestive of malignancy. Thoracic and abdominal imaging identified only nonspecific changes consistent with tissue mineralization, and neoplastic disease hence was considered unlikely. Thoracic radiography disclosed a diffuse bronchial pattern with mild bronchial mineralization. Abdominal radiography identified loss of serosal detail, consistent with lack of intra\u2010abdominal fat; both kidneys appeared slightly enlarged. Abdominal ultrasound examination confirmed slight bilateral renomegaly (both kidneys measuring 4 cm in length), with hyperechoic speckled cortices and bilateral medullary rim sign. Bilateral pyelectasia (1\u20132 mm) was present, and attributed to IV fluid therapy. Fine\u2010needle aspirates of the kidneys obtained under ultrasound guidance to investigate the possibility of renal lymphoma did not identify any lymphocytes or microorganisms. Because vitamin D toxicosis was a differential diagnosis for hypercalcemia in this patient (usually associated with mildly increased serum inorganic phosphorus concentration), plasma 25\u2010hydroxyvitamin D concentration was measured, yielding a value of 22.8 ng/mL; 57 nmol/L (RI, 26.0\u201368.1 ng/mL). Granulomatous diseases are thought to cause hypercalcemia through synthesis of vitamin D analogs,1 and could have explained the increased serum CK activity in this patient. However, a serum Toxoplasma gondii microagglutination test, a serum cryptococcal latex agglutination test, a feline coronavirus antibody titer, and a Baermann flotation for feline lungworm (Aelurostrongylus spp.) all were negative. Serum cortisol concentration was 6.8 \u03bcg/dL (188.0 nmol/L), probably ruling out glucocorticoid\u2010deficient hypoadrenocorticism as a cause of the hypercalcemia. Looking for other explanations for the decreased and somewhat waxing and waning mentation, the possibility of a portosystemic vascular anomaly (PSVA) was explored. Plasma ammonia concentration was moderately increased (211 \u03bcg/dL; 124 \u03bcmol/L; RI, 0\u2013102 \u03bcg/dL), whereas serum concentrations of pre\u2010 and postprandial bile acids were within normal limits, as were results of biochemical liver function tests in combination with an ultrasonographically normal appearance of the liver. These results suggested that a PSVA was highly unlikely. The hyperammonemia was considered unlikely to be of clinical relevance, because a direct association with the more clinically relevant findings in this patient (ie, marked hypercalcemia and widespread mineralization) was not apparent.",

Multinucleated regenerative myofibers were interspersed with atrophic, degenerate, and calcified fibers. Lakes of calcified debris forming nodules at the lingual margins were present, as was multifocal gastric mucosal calcification. Radial cortical calcification, centered on tubular basement membranes, was demonstrated in the kidneys, providing an explanation for the granular casts. Multifocal basement membrane calcification of small airways and blood vessels also was observed, and the adrenal glands had focal calcification.

An extended staining panel conducted on 8 \u03bcm cryosections included hematoxylin and eosin, periodic acid Schiff, modified Gomori trichrome, oil red O, and Alizarin red (Fig 2). There were prominent dystrophic features within the triceps and quadriceps muscles, consisting of marked fiber size variation, numerous internalized nuclei, basophilic regenerating fibers, increased endomysial and perimysial connective tissue, and large areas of infiltrating mononuclear cells (probably macrophages). The Alizarin red stain confirmed the presence of prominent accumulations of calcium in sarcoplasmic and extracellular regions, and there also was a marked accumulation of calcium deposits in the smooth muscle of blood vessels.

This condition has been associated with hypercalcemia in a domestic shorthair cat and a Boston Terrier, associated in both cases with markedly increased serum CK activity, but these patients had mild total hypercalcemia attributed to young age.4, 5 In light of the absence of muscle fiber hypertrophy, the marked hypercalcemia, and the widespread calcium deposition in other organs and blood vessels in our patient, we considered the dystrophic features of the muscle fibers likely to be an effect rather than a primary cause of the disease.",

Although serum PTHrP concentration was mildly increased, no evidence of neoplasia was found on postmortem examination. Despite the detectable plasma PTH concentration, primary hyperparathyroidism was ruled out on the basis of the atrophic parathyroid glands. Furthermore, this is a rare condition in cats, usually presenting in older animals and associated with a low\u2010normal to decreased serum phosphate concentration.6 Although increased concentrations of plasma ionized calcium, PTH, and phosphate would be expected in so\u2010called \u2018tertiary hyperparathyroidism\u2019, this condition has only been described infrequently in cats with advanced renal disease (IRIS stages 3\u20134), after a period of renal secondary hyperparathyroidism.7 This was not consistent with the mild, transient azotemia in this patient, and would have resulted in hyperplasia of the parathyroid glands.",

            "text": "Calciphylaxis is a term that was first used by Seyle to describe a \u2018systemic hypersensitivity\u2019 resulting in systemic calcification in animals that were sensitized by so\u2010called \u2018calcifiers\u2019 (eg, vitamin D analogs, PTH) and subsequently exposed to a \u2018challenger\u2019 (eg, iron, aluminum, trauma).10 In humans, a similar syndrome of calciphylaxis or systemic calcinosis also is called calcific uremic arteriolopathy, and is a rare condition usually seen in patients with end\u2010stage renal disease and in renal transplant patients.11, 12 Although incompletely understood, consequences of their disease such as hyperphosphatemia and tertiary hyperparathyroidism are thought to play a role.11, 12 In companion animals, systemic calcification has been described in patients with vitamin D intoxication resulting in hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia, as well as renal disease.13, 14, 15, 16 The calcification in these human and veterinary patients has occurred primarily within the intima of blood vessel walls, resulting in ischemia and necrosis with subsequent mineralization.11, 12, 13, 14, 15 In our patient, subintimal calcification was noted in larger blood vessels as well as in blood vessels in the musculature, including the myocardium, with associated ischemia, necrosis, and calcification. However, calcium deposits also were demonstrated within the myoplasma (best visualized with the Alizarin red stain, Fig 2). This pathology is unusual in humans, and when present usually is preceded by calcification of the skin.12, 17 To our knowledge, extensive calcification of the striated musculature has not been demonstrated previously in either cats or dogs without preexisting muscular disease,13, 14, 15, 18, 19 but a recent case series described systemic calcification in 5 horses, all of which exhibited muscle calcification and increased serum CK activities.20 The reason for calcification in these patients was unclear, but the authors speculated that they were \u2018sensitized\u2019 by an increased Ca \u00d7 P product (2 horses) or hyperphosphatemia (5 horses), and subsequently challenged by steroids, plasma administration, trauma, an inflammatory condition, or some combination of these factors, resulting in systemic calcification. Interestingly, all of these horses had decreased (2 horses) or normal (3 horses) calcium concentrations, and only 2 had an increased Ca \u00d7 P product. A recent report described idiopathic calciphylaxis in a 10\u2010week\u2010old male domestic shorthair kitten,21 but this kitten differed from our patient by predominantly presenting for severe cutaneous lesions and experiencing full recovery with symptomatic treatment. Furthermore, apart from assumed age\u2010related hyperphosphatemia, the kitten's laboratory test results were unremarkable, including a normal Ca \u00d7 P product. The cutaneous calcification was hypothesized to represent an inherited disorder. Unlike our patient, this kitten did not have any apparent reason for generalized mineralization, possibly explaining why the calcification was limited to the skin. Our patient suffered from systemic calcification involving muscle and visceral organs, presumptively a consequence of the markedly increased Ca \u00d7 P product. The potentially deleterious consequences of an increased Ca \u00d7 P product emphasize the importance of monitoring the Ca \u00d7 P product in hypercalcemic patients, and suggest that every effort should be made to decrease it (and thereby probably the risk of mineralization) as soon as possible.",

On the basis of the clinical presentation and thorough ante\u2010 and postmortem investigations, we conclude that the markedly increased Ca \u00d7 P product in this patient accounted for the mineralization, with the extensive muscle fiber calcification explaining the markedly increased serum CK activity. We consider the patient's decreased mentation to be a result of the systemic effects of the severe tissue mineralization, which did not resolve within a matter of days15, 22 despite transient normocalcemia. Pain is one of the initial signs of calciphylaxis in humans,23 and the cat may have responded to painful sensation with decreased mentation, although the cat did not appear painful when handled. The hypercalcemia itself also may have contributed to this patient's decreased mentation. Human patients with hypercalcemia related to primary hyperparathyroidism can present with headaches, fatigue, nausea, and mental disturbances, including coma.24 These signs have been found to correlate with the degree of hypercalcemia rather than plasma PTH concentration, with clinical improvement corresponding to decreasing calcium concentration despite persistently high PTH concentration.24 The lack of clinical improvement in our patient at the time of normocalcemia, however, does not support hypercalcemia as the sole cause of obtundation. Hyperammonemia contributing to the patient's decreased mentation was considered unlikely, but could not be eliminated. Because mammalian muscle produces ammonia,25 muscle necrosis may have caused the hyperammonemia in this patient.",
