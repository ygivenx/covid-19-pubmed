The disease, known as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is caused by a type of coronavirus, one of a large family of viruses that includes those responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the common cold. \u201cAlthough it has been three years since the emergence of MERS in humans was recognized, the global community remains within the grip of this emerging infectious disease,\u201d the WHO wrote in a statement issued on 3 September.",

In parts of the Middle East, however, the infection rate is above 95%, according to tests that can detect antibodies generated against the MERS virus (Emerg. Infect. Dis.\n20, 552\u2013559, 2014).",

Given that camels are a source of infection, Munster says, efforts should focus on minimizing the spread of the virus in these animals. Now that scientists have made strides toward vaccine development against the virus, the question is whether immunization programs should focus on inoculating humans or camels.",

In May, scientists reported that modifying a vaccinia Ankara virus to produce a spike glycoprotein found in the MERS coronavirus could induce mice to produce antibodies that fight MERS. The modified virus also protected rodents from infection with the pathogen (J. Virol.\n89, 8651\u20138656, 2015). Two months later, another group elicited MERS coronavirus\u2013neutralizing antibodies in both mice and rhesus macaques by first administering an immunization that incorporated a DNA plasmid vector expressing the full-length spike protein of the virus, and then following it with a booster consisting of the S1 subunit of that protein (Nat. Commun.\n6, 7712, 2015).",

Although the study included only three camels, all of them had some antibodies against the spike protein when examined 11 weeks after immunization, and two showed robust levels of neutralizing antibodies after vaccination. Ideally, research will produce MERS vaccines for humans as well as camels, says David B. Weiner, one of the study's authors and a molecular immunologist at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine in Philadelphia. \u201cCamels\u2014particularly juvenile camels\u2014represent an important part of the transmission cycle, so vaccination in this population could play an important role in breaking the human transmission cycle,\u201d Weiner says. \u201cHowever,\u201d he adds, \u201cit's also important to have an effective human vaccine to protect persons in the case of outbreaks.\u201d",
