It is a challenge to any health authority or center for disease control (CDC) to make an accurate diagnosis within a short period of time to prevent the pandemic spread of an infection. Many molecular diagnostic platforms, which usually involve real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), have become popular and powerful methods to specifically detect and identify infectious microorganisms with a high accuracy. In addition, these molecular diagnosis methods can be also used for preventive medicine and the rapid diagnosis of genetic diseases, which have attracted substantial interest recently. People who have defective genes may be screened and pretreated in advance if they can be diagnosed early enough. As a result, there is a great need to develop a compact tool for the rapid detection of genetic mutation and genetic diseases.",

            "text": "Most microbial and animal cells share physical similarities. A cell mostly consists of a jelly-like cytoplasm (70\u201380% water in weight) in which the cell constituents are suspended. The remainder of the cell is composed of cell membranes or walls, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. Approximately 5\u201330% of the weight of a dry cell is attributed to nucleic acids, depending on the genome size, surrounding environment and the cell\u2019s current growth phase. The nucleic acids, including deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA), play an important role in terms of storing genetic information, and maintaining normal metabolism and growth. DNA/RNA extraction is a routine procedure that collects DNA/RNA from various types of organisms.133 There are three basic steps involved in DNA/RNA extraction including (1) cell disruption, (2) removal of sub-cellular components, and (3) DNA/RNA extraction. In addition, purification and enrichment of a complex bio-sample at an extremely low concentration is crucial in many biomedical assays. These steps can efficiently increase the detection limit of the subsequent detection system. However, clinical samples are usually contained in a biological medium that would normally inhibit the subsequent DNA/RNA amplification. Therefore, the extraction of the target DNA or RNA from a complex bio-sample is usually inevitable in clinical practice for most existing nucleic acid-based detection systems. These existing DNA/RNA extraction processes are usually time-consuming and labor-intensive though. Therefore, there is a great need to develop microsystems to perform these processes in an automatic fashion. Recently, several sample pretreatment process performed in microfluidic chips have been developed.12,48,124 This paper will review the recent progress in the development of these miniaturized devices and systems for sample pretreatment.",

            "text": "After extraction of target DNA or RNA, nucleic acid amplification techniques, including PCR, RT-PCR, and isothermal DNA amplification, are commonly used for genetic identification and disease diagnosis.3,61 PCR is a common and often indispensable technique used in medical and biological research. It is a well-developed method for nucleic acid amplification in the fields of genetic identification and diagnosis.92,115,116 Based on the proper selection of specific primers, the PCR technique can be used to perform nucleic acid amplification in vitro, resulting in the production of a large quantity of a target nucleic acid sequence. The specific primers are single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) molecules of about 20\u201330 nucleotides, which are specifically designed to flank the two ends of the target genome.117 A specific segment of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) can be replicated during a thermal cycling process involving three different temperatures for denaturation, annealing, and extension, respectively. These denaturation\u2013annealing\u2013extension steps comprise one complete reaction cycle, which can rapidly duplicate DNA segments,103 and are crucial in the PCR process. Thus, PCR provides a sensitive and selective means of detecting low numbers of, or slow-growing, pathogens in clinical specimens, and hence has had considerable impact in the field of diagnostic microbiology. Table 1 shows a simplified process for molecular diagnosis. However, traditional PCR machines are usually bulky and relatively expensive. Besides, the PCR process is relatively time-consuming. Therefore, miniaturized devices for performing PCR processes rapidly are in crucial need.\n",

The LOC or micro-TAS can perform the basic functions of sample preparation, mixing, reaction, transport, collection, separation, and detection on a single chip automatically. The advantages of the LOC or micro-TAS include smaller amounts of samples and reagents are required, and faster analysis with a higher sensitivity. Furthermore, the functionality and reliability of a LOC or micro-TAS could be significantly enhanced by the integration of other functional miniaturized components. Among these biomedical devices, PCR devices are one of the most extensively studied biological and chemical analytical devices and have been miniaturized using the MEMS technology for medical diagnostics, microbial detection and other bio-analysis applications. This review paper will summarize the recent progress in these miniaturized PCR or RT-PCR devices and systems. Furthermore, several approaches to perform isothermal DNA amplification in microfluidic systems have been reported recently. We will also review the progress in developing these miniature systems. Measurements of amplified DNA have been performed using several different microfluidic approaches, which will be also reviewed in the paper. The ultimate aim of a microfluidic system which has integrated sample pretreatment, nucleic acid amplification and on-line detection is to provide a compact platform for fast and accurate analysis of biological samples obtained from suspected aberrant tissues, body fluids, or nature environment.45,54,86,87 In the following sections, traditional processes for sample preparation, nucleic acid amplification and detection schemes will be first reviewed. Then microfluidic devices and systems that can perform these corresponding processes will be assessed and discussed.",

Then, at the boundary between the pinched and the following expanding microchannel segments, a force toward the center of the microchannel was exerted by the expanding flow profile, whereas a force toward the sidewall was exerted mainly on the RBCs. Since this method utilizes only the laminar flow profile inside a microchannel, complicated flow control mechanisms could be eliminated, which is usually required for other types of particle separation methods such as field flow fractionation. Also, this method can be applied both for particle size analysis and for preparation of monodispersed particles, since separation can be rapidly and continuously performed.",

With the same mechanical pressure control, a sample flow containing various particles and a carrier flow without particles converge in a narrow channel. In this channel, where the flow is laminar, the carrier flow occupies most of the channel width. When an electric potential is applied on the carrier flow, the dynamic behavior of the fluids changes with the magnitude of the applied voltage. Electroosmosis occurs when there is an electric double layer at the solid\u2013liquid interface and it arises from the electrostatic attraction between the surface charge of the solid channel wall and the ions in the fluid. When an external electric field is applied along the length of the channel, the mobile positive ions in the diffusion layer move towards the cathode. The ions will couple to, and hence induce a dragging force on the bulk fluid, resulting in a bulk fluid movement along the channel. Generally, the pressure attainable with the EOF is weaker than that with a pressure-driven flow. Therefore, the EOF usually has a very limited effect on a pressure-driven flow. However, when the magnitudes of the two such generated forces are similar, this effect becomes significant. As a result, the hydrodynamic spreading of fluids can be tuned arbitrarily with an adjustable power supply. With this approach, separation of E. coli and yeast cells has been demonstrated successfully.",

By using proper flow balancing of the outlets and the spatial positioning of the standing wave, a band of particles can be directed into a selected channel while a cleared medium is collected in other channels. This mode of operation represents an attractive way of implementing acoustically controlled continuous flow separators. Fractionation of suspended particles in a standing wave field utilizing the fact that particles with dissimilar sizes or physical properties are affected differently by acoustic radiation has also been reported. Larger particles will, for example, experience a larger acoustic radiation force than smaller ones, which means that they will move faster towards a node or an antinode than the smaller ones. By using flow splitters at the outlet and balanced flows, it is possible to separate larger particles from the smaller ones since they have travelled different distances. In addition, bio-particles can also be concentrated by using an asymmetric surface acoustic wave method.145 However, such systems usually require complicated fabrication processes or costly equipment.

High electric fields cannot be applied due to Joule heating effects and hence hinders the possibility for reducing the time required for analysis. In order to improve the separation efficiency, miniaturized formats for slab gel electrophoresis were developed, which are now well known as capillary gel electrophoresis (CGE) and microchip gel electrophoresis (MGE). They are alternatives to conventional slab gel electrophoresis for fast DNA separation and detection due to their excellent separation performance. Moreover, a laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) system is commonly applied in these PCR\u2013CGE or PCR\u2013MGE systems due to its superior sensitivity and capability for quantification of the results.155 However, a traditional LIF system comprising a laser source, a photodetector, filters, and mounting components is relatively bulky and somewhat mitigates the advantages of these miniature microdevices. Therefore, combing a PCR device and a CGE microchip as well as the detection system with integrated on-line detection in a PCR\u2013CGE system is attractive for practical DNA/PCR products analysis.57\n",

However, when amplified DNA samples and reagents were transported to capillary electrophoresis (CE) reservoirs by using electrokinetic forces, they will move at different speeds due to their different charge-to-mass ratios. This may affect the subsequent injection and separation process. The developed design overcomes this problem by using a series of pneumatic micropumps to manipulate the DNA/RNA samples prior to the electrophoretic separation process, and then uses conventional electrokinetic forces to perform sample injection and separation once the DNA/RNA samples have been amplified. Additionally, the high temperature field (>95 \u00b0C) in the PCR chamber can cause a drying of the CE buffer, and hence can affect the injection of the amplified DNA samples into the CE channel. Therefore, the pneumatic micropumps also provide a micro-valving function such that the PCR chambers and the CE buffer reservoir can be effectively isolated.\n",

Table 2 shows a comparison between a commercial quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) machine and the fluorescence detection utilizing a linear CCD and spectrometer. Recently, miniaturized systems with both integrated fluorescence detection and on-chip heaters/sensors have been reported.8,99,105 PCR enables the detection of trace levels of DNA/RNA after a large number of amplification cycles. The quantitative applications of this method, however, may suffer from complications due to background amplification and variances in amplification efficiency.35,104 Hence, a great deal of effort is still needed to enhance the sensitivity and speed of nucleic acid detection and quantification, while at the same time, help to validate the quantitative reliability of the available techniques. The development of lab-on-a-chip PCR systems has been considered a promising approach to overcome the difficulties associated with the clinical utilization of PCR assays.\n",

First, the integrated microfluidic chip can perform two-step RT-PCR using pneumatic micropumps to transport RT-PCR/PCR reagents (reservoirs 2 and 3) to the PCR chamber (reservoir 1). The RT-PCR chamber performs the reverse transcription reaction on mRNA. Precise amounts of RNA reagents/templates can be first transported to the neighboring \u201cPCR chamber\u201d from the \u201cRT-PCR reagent chamber\u201d for reverse transcription of RNA templates using pneumatic micropumps. After synthesis, complimentary DNA (cDNA) samples can be further amplified after pumping PCR reagents from the neighboring \u201cPCR reagent chamber\u201d. The two-step RT-PCR amplification process provides a more reliable method for genetic identification. If only DNA samples are to be amplified, then the reverse transcription process can be omitted. Secondly, these pneumatic micropumps could also act as microvalves such that PCR reagents and CE buffers could be properly separated (Huang et al.,44 Copyright 2006 Wiley-Blackwell)",
