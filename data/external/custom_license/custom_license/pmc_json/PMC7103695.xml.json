Due to their sporadic outbreaks in humans, these highly pathogenic viruses require a continuous surveillance activity which needs a significant effort of the National Health Systems and of the International Authorities [6\u201310]. To date, no specific drugs are available to treat patients infected with most agents belonging to this wide array of the emerging and reemerging viruses.

This approach has been used with success, for instance, to control the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Indeed, thanks to the available treatments, AIDS has become a chronic disease and the life expectancy of people living with HIV is significantly increased over the years [11]. More recently, following a similar approach, effective drugs against the hepatitis C virus (HCV) have been developed [11]. Currently available antiviral drugs include more than 40 compounds that have been officially approved for clinical use [11]. However, the number of human health threatening viruses that can be controlled by these drugs is less than 10 [12]. The situation is even worst in the case of neglected viral infections, for whose treatment no selective drugs are expected to appear on the market in the near future, due to their limited business potential, and to the fact that usually they affect populations with poor socioeconomical background. Finally, viruses classified as highly pathogenic require biosafety level 3 or 4 facilities and protocols, thus rendering drug discovery and development extremely difficult.",

            "text": "Cationic amphiphilic drugs (CADs) are a wide group of chemicals that are characterized by common structural features, that is, a hydrophobic aromatic ring or ring system and a hydrophilic side-chain containing an ionizable amine functional group. CADs include antidepressants, antibiotics, antipsychotics, antimalarial, antiarrhythmic, cholesterol-lowering and fertility-regulator drugs [13,14]. CADs have the propensity to interact with different cell membranes and accumulate in acidic intracellular compartments such as late endosomes/lysosomes (LE/Lys). The cellular uptake mechanisms markedly differ between different CADs. Indeed, they can accumulate into the Lys within minutes or hours after in vitro cell exposition and the different kinetic depends from the chemical-physical characteristics of the molecules [13,15\u201317]. The amine functional group of these compounds is mainly un-protonated at physiological pH. Once inside the acidic environment of the LE/Lys, the molecules become protonated and, since they cannot longer permeate the membrane, get trapped inside the organelle (Figure 1). This pH-dependent partitioning of CADs results in a pronounced accumulation of the drugs leading to various physiological and morphological alterations of the LE/Lys compartment. One of the effects observed is the accumulation inside the LE/Lys of various lipid species, such as cholesterol, sphingomyelin, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, and bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP), inducing the accumulation of membranous structures and a marked expansion of the organelle volume. This phenotype recalls the one observed in patients with the Niemann Pick type-C (NPC) disease, a lipid storage disorder [13,14]. More than 50 CADs have been showed to induce phospholipidosis at therapeutically relevant concentrations and after chronic treatments [13,14]. However, CADs currently in clinical use are well tolerated and the lipid accumulation is not associated in a clear cut manner to clinical consequences [13,14]. Furthermore, cell changes induced by CADs are reversible and no rebound effects have been described associated to the discontinuation of CADs [13].\n",

            "text": "Drug-induced phospholipidosis is believed to be the result of the direct interaction of CADs with membrane phospholipids and the ability of a specific CAD to induce phospholipidosis has been correlated positively with the strength of the drug/phospholipid interactions [14]. The interaction of CADs with membranes can modify their permeability as well as the membrane-proximal pH, thus affecting several biological processes in particular at the level of LE/Lys, such as the inhibition of several enzymatic activities and the change in the distribution of lysosomal enzymes [13,14,18\u201320]. The acid sphingomyelinase (aSMase), a lysosomal enzyme which catalyzes the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin into ceramide and phosphorylcoline, is one of the targets of several CADs [13,21]. It has been shown that the antidepressant desipramine and related drugs induce the detachment of aSMase from the inner membrane leaflet of Lys with its consecutive inactivation, resulting in the accumulation of sphingomyelin [13]. The reduction of the aSMase activity has been also reported for other two CADs: the antiarrhythmic amiodarone and the inhibitor of cholesterol transport U18666A [21,22]. Furthermore, it has been reported that structurally different CADs have an additive effect on the inhibition of aSMase activity, arguing for action of these compounds on the same molecular target [13]. Interestingly, a low level of aSMase activity is detectable in cells from patients with the NPC disease [13], further underlying the similarity between the cellular phenotype observed in cells of NPC patients and in those of individuals treated with CADs. The ability of CADs to interact with the biogenesis and luminal acidification of LE/Lys compartment may affect other proteases, such as phospholipases and catepsins, and could explain the ability of amiodarone to inhibit the degradation of lung surfactant protein A both in vitro as well as in vivo [15,20,23]. Furthermore, it has been shown that bepridil (an antiarrhythmic drug), amiodarone, and U18666A inhibit the activity of the lysosomal beta-secretase, while differentially modify the specificity of gamma-secretase to cleave the amyloid precursor protein [18,24]. It has to be noted that CADs do not necessarily interact with the phospholipid bilayers of the cellular membranes [15]. For example, the antimalarial drug chloroquine does not interact with phospholipids [15]. On the other hand, when this interaction takes place, it can have different features. For instance, while the antipsychotic drug chlorpromazine, which aspecifically interacts with membrane, causes an increased membrane permeability, amiodarone alters lipid dynamics by interacting with the hydrophobic core of the membrane bilayer [15]. These differences in CADs behavior give reason of their different ability in inducing phospholipidosis and cellular metabolism alterations.",

Indeed, U18666A and amiodarone induce a NPC-like phenotype with the formation of enlarged vacuoles enriched in BMP, cholesterol removal alleviates the change in BMP distribution induced by U18666A, but not the one induced by amiodarone suggesting a different mechanism of action [17].",

It likely acts by increasing the endosome-Lys and Golgi vesicle pH, and by downregulating the production of cytokines (IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1), and the expression of TNF-\u03b1 receptor [78,79]. Thus, chloroquine can directly inhibit viruses that require an acidic pH inside the LE/Lys to enter into the cytosol and can mitigate the deleterious effect of the immune activation induced by certain viral infections. Unfortunately, in vivo evidence do not support, or poorly support, the efficacy of chloroquine in the treatment of HIV, dengue, EBOV and influenza [42,70,72,80\u201382]. Two clinical trials specifically aimed at addressing chloroquine efficacy on acute phase of chikungunya virus infection were concluded with contrasting results [69]. On the other hand, chloroquine seems to be effective in vivo, at least in the mouse model, in inhibiting the human coronavirus subtype OC43 and EBOV [45,46], as well as in the Aotus monkeys, affecting the dengue virus type 2 replication [83].",

In addition, considering that CADs mainly exert their antiviral activity by acting on cellular target, one of their positive aspects is represented by the fact that the development of resistant viral strains is unlikely. Although numerous in vitro studies and some in vivo evidence in animal models suggest the possibility to employ CADs as antiviral, their use deserves some considerations.",

This finding is likely due to the low ratio between the amounts of drug administered and the total volume of the storage compartment. The physicochemical properties of CADs result in a broad tissue binding, as demonstrated by the high apparent volume of distribution of these drugs in human body districts [13]. Thus, it is mandatory to further analyze in the animal models the efficacy of CADs, in order to determine the appropriate dosage and length of treatment necessary to achieve a stable intracellular concentration that is required for the antiviral activity. Indeed, these pharmacokinetic characteristics, the possibility to have a poor penetration in specific tissues, and differences in viral strains and/or in the genetic background of the studied populations could explain the few in vivo confirmations of the antiviral efficiency of CADs. To improve the delivery of CADs, approaches based on nanocarriers, like phospholipid micelles or PEGylated graphene, have been proposed [100,101]. Unfortunately these delivery systems can have drawbacks, such as the delay of CAD release inside the cells, as well as the longer/higher storage of the compounds in the tissues that might increase the risk of CAD side effects and toxicity [101].",

            "text": "Although the CAD typical pharmacokinetic could reduce the efficacy of these molecules as antiviral treatment, they could be used in association with other antiviral compounds, especially in acute setting, as well as in preexposure and/or prophylaxis regimen for people at high risk of infection with highly pathogenic viruses. In this context, it has been recently shown that the combination of more drugs displayed a synergistic effect in inhibiting EBOV replication in vitro at reduced concentrations of each single drug [102]. Animal models are also important to carefully evaluate the potential adverse effects that might be associated especially to certain classes of CADs. Indeed, even though several CADs, that have been shown to exert antiviral activity in vitro, are already licensed mainly for the treatment of cardiovascular and psychiatric diseases, as estrogen regulators or as antimalarial drugs, the absence of side effects during their off-label use remains a critical aspect that needs to be properly addressed. The problems related to CAD toxicity in human treatment have been already debated during the last EBOV outbreak in West Africa, when a special concern was expressed on the use of amiodarone in clinical trials mainly due to its potential side effects [103,104]. In this context, it has to be mentioned that the treatment of an acute infection with a highly pathogenic virus should require a limited period of CAD administration, thus potentially reducing the risk of side effects. However, this aspect needs to be carefully investigated with appropriate animal models and clinical trials. Finally, despite CADs display a wide range of antiviral effects, surprisingly some reports described a positive effect of specific CADs on replication of certain viruses. For instance, Salata et al. [66] reported that amiodarone significantly increases enteroviral progeny release from infected cells in vitro, while Wu et al. [105] described an increase of influenza A virus A/WSN/33 (H1N1) replication in human lung epithelial cells A549, after treatment with chloroquine. Klintworth and coworkers [65] reported that, while amiodarone and other CADs do not affect the entry of wild type rabies virus into target cells, the same molecules enhance entry of lentiviral particles pseudotyped with the rabies virus envelope glycoprotein into non-neuronal cells. Of note, Klintworth\u2019s study also highlights the fact that, although pseudo-viruses are good surrogates to screen viral entry inhibitors for pathogens requiring high containment level laboratories, data based on this tool need to be validated by performing experiments with the corresponding wild-type pathogenic virus. Overall, these reports strongly suggest that a careful monitoring of CAD effects on the load of viruses that could infect/coinfect individuals treated with these compounds, both for labeled as well as for off-label applications, should be considered.",
