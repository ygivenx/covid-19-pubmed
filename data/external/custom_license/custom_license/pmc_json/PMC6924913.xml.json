IDVs are detected in and isolated from cattle in many countries in North America, Asia, Europe, and Africa (1\u20134). In addition, both IDV RNAs and specific antibodies have been detected in many animal species (1,5,6). To date, IDVs have been phylogenetically classified into 3 lineages: D/OK, D/660, and Japanese lineages. We isolated a new IDV strain from cattle in Japan with respiratory disease, whose hemagglutinin-esterase-fusion (HEF) gene did not belong to the known phylogenetical lineages.",

We collected nasal swab samples from 9 of 15 cows on January 7 and 10. All samples subjected to IDV-specific real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) (7) were found positive. We also subjected these samples to RT-PCR analyses specific for bovine viral diarrhea virus 1 and 2, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus, bovine parainfluenza virus 3, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine coronavirus, bovine rhinitis A virus, Mycobacterium bovis, Mycoplasma bovigenitalium, Mycoplasma dispar, Ureaplasma diversum, and Mycoplasma bovirhinis. All samples were found negative for these pathogens except for the sample from cow no. 5, which was positive for M. dispar. Despite these cows receiving antimicrobial drug treatment, we isolated Mannheimia haemolytica from 7 of them (nos. 1\u20135, 7, 8); cow no. 5 died on January 7. Taken together, these factors suggested that IDV infection was involved in the onset of BRDC in this herd.",

We determined the entire genomic sequence of D/Yama2019 by performing RT-PCR amplification of each viral segment with specific primers, revealing an identical sequence with that detected in swab sample no. 1.

We considered samples with HI titer >1:40 to be positive (4). All serum samples collected on January 7 were HI-negative except for the sample from cow no. 1 (a titer of 1:40), whereas all samples collected on February 4 were HI-positive (a titer range of 1:40\u20131:160), confirming seroconversion to IDV antibodies in diseased cows.

We observed 1-way cross-reactivity between D/Yama2019 and D/OK or D/Yama2016 with antiserum. Monoclonal antibody clones B4 and R36 cross-reacted to D/Yama2019 and other tested viruses with different titers, whereas the clones G22, G27, and G74, which reacted strongly to D/Yama2016, did not react to D/Yama2019. These data indicated HEF antigenic heterogeneity between D/Yama2019 and viruses of the 3 known lineages. Monoclonal antibodies revealed the presence of common epitopes among IDVs, as suggested by previous reports (9,10). Amino acid differences were located on the head region of HEF among the IDVs, possibly causing antigenic heterogeneity.",
