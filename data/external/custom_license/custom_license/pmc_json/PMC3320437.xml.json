The model is premised on a SARS outbreak during respiratory season where person-to-person transmission of SARS is documented and epidemiologic links between cases are poorly defined. The outbreak was designed to be consistent in size and duration with the Toronto outbreak (5). The analytic horizon of the analysis was defined as the expected lifetime of persons living in New York City during the 2004\u20132005 respiratory illness season. FRIs are defined herein as nonspecific infections caused by pathogens other than SARS-CoV for which the microbiologic origin cannot be determined on the basis of clinical grounds alone. The model was designed to identify the most effective and cost-effective uses of societal resources in managing FRIs of undetermined origin during a SARS outbreak.",
