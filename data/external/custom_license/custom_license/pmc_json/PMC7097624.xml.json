(He et al. 2004a; Li et al. 2005a). Infection of SARS-CoV is initiated by binding of the S protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) functional receptor expressed on target cells (Li et al. 2003). A 193-amino acid fragment (residues 318\u2013510) within the S1 subunit of the S protein has been characterized as the minimal receptor-binding domain (RBD) (Wong et al. 2004). In early studies, mice immunized with inactivated SARS-CoV were used to generate monoclonal antibodies capable of blocking infectivity. Of these, several antibodies were directed against the S protein (Berry et al. 2004). The S protein serves as the main antigen that elicits protective immune responses, including neutralizing antibodies in infected humans and animals (Bisht et al. 2004; Buchholz et al. 2004; Greenough et al. 2005; Hofmann et al. 2004). Several studies have demonstrated that RBD of the S region is a major target for neutralizing SARS-CoV antibodies (He et al. 2004b, 2005; Zhou et al. 2004).",

            "text": "ACE2, also called ACEH (ACE homologue), is an integral membrane protein and a zinc metalloprotease of the ACE family that also includes somatic and germinal ACE (Komatsu et al. 2002; Tipnis et al. 2000). ACE2 has been implicated in the pathology of Hartnup\u2019s disease, a disorder of amino acid homeostasis, and it has been recently revealed that ACE2 controls intestinal inflammation and diarrhea via its function in amino acid transport; thus, regulating the gut microbiome (Kuba et al. 2013). Mouse ACE2 has about a 40 % amino acid identity to the N- and C-terminal domains of mouse somatic ACE. The predicted mouse ACE2 protein sequence consists of 798 amino acids, including an N-terminal signal peptide, a single catalytic domain, a C-terminal membrane anchor, and a short cytoplasmic tail. ACE2 is a newly described rennin\u2013angiotensin (RAS) system component that is sensitive to chloride ion concentration (Donoghue et al. 2000). It is a membrane-bound enzyme that acts as a monocarboxypeptidase and is an essential regulator of heart function. Within the RAS, ACE2 competes with ACE because it is capable of hydrolyzing the inactive decapeptide angiotensin I (Ang I) into the nonapeptide Ang (1\u20139); thus, decreasing the amount of Ang I available for pressor Ang II generation by ACE. Similarly, ACE2 degrades the vasoconstrictor Ang II into vasodilator Ang (1\u20137), which may also be produced from Ang (1\u20139) hydrolysis by ACE (Donoghue et al. 2000; Vickers et al. 2002; Zhong et al. 2010). The antagonistic relationship between ACE and ACE2 modulates the balance between Ang II (vasopressor) and Ang 1\u20137 (vasodilator), which plays a significant role regulating renal and cardiovascular functions. SARS-CoV infections and the S protein decrease ACE2 expression, and S protein injections into mice worsen acute lung failure in vivo (Kuba et al. 2005). In contrast, ACE2 and the type 2 Ang II receptor protect mice from severe acute lung injury, but other components of the RAS (including ACE, Ang II, and Ang II type 1a receptor) promote disease occurrence (Imai et al. 2005). These findings suggest a possible therapeutic role for ACE2 in acute lung injury, which affects many people worldwide every year.",

The other transferred membrane was pretreated with ACE2 antibody before RBD and RBD antibody to block the RBD binding sites (Fig. 4c, right panel). Expectedly, ACE2 molecules in HEK293 cells were blocked with the ACE2 antibody but not in NIH3T3 cells. We confirmed this by confocal immunofluorescence image using the two cell lines that were fixed and treated with RBD and the RBD antibody (Fig. 5). As a result, the RBD receptor (ACE2) was observed in both HEK293 and NIH3T3 cells using the RBD antibody. A cocaine monoclonal antibody was used as the negative control in this experiment. \n",

Here, we expressed the RBD of the S protein and immunized a mouse to prepare monoclonal antibodies. The RBD protein was prepared with the GST fused form and purified fusion protein without separating the two kinds of proteins, because this fusion protein was efficiently expressed in this system and easily separated from a gel. Another benefit is that the fused protein efficiently provided monoclonal antibodies due to its suitable molecular size (see Fig. 1). We also prepared a plural GST antibody for confirming the RBD specific binding experiments (data not shown). We have demonstrated with a cellular ELISA assay that RBD bound to cell membranes and that the anti-RBD antibody worked well with its antigen.",

            "text": "There are many reports of SARS S or RBD protein binding to ACE2 on host cell membrane proteins using an antibody against SARS-CoV and by other methods. Various neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV recognize overlapping sets of residues relative to the ACE2 molecule (Zhu et al. 2007). ACE2 is predominantly expressed in the heart, kidneys, and testes and at lower levels in a wide variety of tissues, particularly the colon and lungs (Lew et al. 2008). It seems that this RBD region plays a critical role attaching the host ACE2 molecule. This phenomenon was also supported by chimeric monoclonal antibodies that bind to the ACE2 RBD of the SARS S protein (Berry et al. 2010). Experimental support for ACE2-RBD binding was provided from a study of SARS antibody fragments competing with ACE2 for binding to the RBD (Prabakaran et al. 2006; Sui et al. 2004; Hwang et al. 2006). The crystal structure of the RBD\u2013ACE2 complex has been identified, providing detailed information concerning RBD structure and function (Li et al. 2005a). The structure revealed that the RBD can be further divided into two separate subdomains. One is the RBD core and the other is the RBD loop (RPM) (a.a. 424\u2013494). The RBD loop is the region that directly contacts the ACE2 molecule. In contrast, the RBD core contacts accessory proteins (Li et al. 2005a). We showed competitive binding of the RBD with the anti-ACE2 antibody (see Figs. 3, 4, 5). The same weights of tissue were homogenized and lysed by reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer for Western blotting analysis. ACE2 was detected by the anti-ACE2 antibody in all of our organ tissue samples, which cross-reacts with the mouse/human ACE2 molecule.",

The ACE2 molecule was detected at approximately 60 kDa and expressed strongly in the heart and lungs of mice. This is different from humans in which there is stronger expression in the kidneys than that in the lungs. RBD binding to ACE2 molecule was interfered with by pre-treatment with the ACE2 antibody in mouse tissues (see Fig. 3). We confirmed these results in NIH3T3 and HEK293 cells by cellular ELISA and a competitive assay (see Fig. 4a, b). The anti-ACE2 antibody suppressed RBD-ACE2 binding about 70\u201380 % within 30 min, but the inhibition decreased to 30\u201350 % after a 2\u20133 h incubation (data not shown). It seemed that the ACE2 antibody separated from the ACE2 molecules after a long incubation or degraded during incubation. We confirmed the molecular weight of ACE2 in HEK293 and NIH3T3 cells for the competitive assay in gels. Expressed ACE2 was 120 kDa, but it differs in tissue and cell lysates (Donoghue et al. 2000; Lew et al. 2008). In our lysates, ACE2 molecules occurred in three or more bands in HEK 293 cells and in two or more bands in NIH3T3 cells. This seemed to be a proteolytic cleavage pattern resulting from the different tissue lysate preparations (see Fig. 4c, left panel). The ACE2 molecules were completely blocked by the ACE2 antibody before treatment with the RBD protein in HEK293 cells, but not in NIH3T3 cells (see Fig. 4c, right panel). We suggest that the RBD binding site on ACE2 molecules in NIH3T3 cells may have been destroyed or changed due to cleavage of the ACE2 molecules during sample preparation. This suggestion was supported by our confocal microscope images results in which NIH3T3 cells stained well with the RBD fusion protein as in the HEK293 cells.",

We also confirmed that the mouse fibroblast (NIH3T3) and human embryonic kidney cell lines (HEK 293) expressed ACE2. We finally demonstrated that recombinant RBD bound to ACE2 on these cells. We also demonstrated that our preparing RBD elicited high antibody titers in its immunized mice. Therefore, it appears to be an ideal immunizing antigen for generating monoclonal antibodies as well as a possible vaccine candidate. We have also found that the RBD binds to various tissues through ACE2. These results can be applied for future research to help treat ACE2 related diseases and SARS.",
