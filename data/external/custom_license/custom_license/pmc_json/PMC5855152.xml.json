Influenza viruses circulate in a population at very low levels even outside of the influenza season and sporadic isolations may also have a little epidemic significance. As some countries within the European Region may not have influenza sentinel surveillance systems, viruses reported from out\u2010of\u2010season outbreaks investigations could also reduce the specificity of the method to detect the actual start of a season. Moreover, low\u2010intensity epidemics in rural areas with limited laboratory capacity could delay the first detection of influenza for weeks in some countries. This suggests that a model using only simple epidemiological data might be a more practical choice for a standard within a region. Nevertheless, historical ILI and ARI data should be carefully checked to eliminate the data errors or aberrant information causing peaks in the pre\u2010epidemic and post\u2010epidemic periods.

The main achievement of MEM is an algorithm splitting one wave season in three periods using pre\u2010epidemic information to calculate a threshold. The high sensitivity and specificity of the threshold in detecting the beginning of the epidemics in most countries, despite their diverse surveillance system and data quality, support its use for public health purposes such as early warning, health services policy or mass media and public information. MEM can be applied to historical ARI data, but the validity indicators show a somewhat poorer performance than for its application to ILI data.",

MEM could be a good option because of its intuitive concept, simple data requirements and flexibility in comparison with other sophisticated mathematical models. But other steps towards harmonisation should also be taken. These analyses suggest an added benefit from the establishment of an ILI definition with highly sensitive inclusion criteria.\n42\n Combined with highly specific threshold derived indicators, Europe would obtain an even more reliable and comprehensive perspective on influenza surveillance. Moreover, comparing ILI weekly data with levels of intensity calculated by MEM with a standard algorithm would allow international assessment of clinical influenza activity among European countries.",
