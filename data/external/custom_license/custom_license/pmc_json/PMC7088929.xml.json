According to studies on other coronaviruses, M protein is the most abundant component of the viral envelope. It plays an important role in viral assembly process and budding [10, 11]. The M protein can also induce production of protective antibodies [10, 12]. The N protein of the coronavirus forms a helical nucleocapsid with genomic RNA and protects the viral genome from external interference [13, 14].",

Total RNA was extracted from shRNA expression plasmids -transfected ST cells after 48 h of infection, and reverse transcription was performed using the PrimeScript\u2122 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (TaKaRa Biotechnology, Dalian, China). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis was performed to amplify N gene using the cDNA as the template and the \u03b2-actin cDNA as the internal standard. The primers used are shown in Table 2. The quantitative RT-PCR contained 7.5 \u03bcL SYBR Mixture (CWBIO, Beijing, China), 0.5 \u03bcL (10 \u03bcM) forward primer, 0.5\u03bcL (10 \u03bcM) reverse primer, 1.5 \u03bcL cDNA template, and 10 \u03bcL RNase-free deionized distilled water. The reaction protocol was as follows: 95 \u00b0C for 600 s, followed by 40 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 10 s and 60 \u00b0C for 30 s; the melting curve stage comprised 95 \u00b0C for 10 s, 65 \u00b0C for 60 s, and 97 \u00b0C for 1 s, as well as 37 \u00b0C for 30 s. Each experiment was repeated three times. The relative number of viral RNA copies in cells interfered with different plasmids was calculated by the 2\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct method.",

Therefore, RNAi has been considered as an effective strategy to protect against bacterial and viral pathogens [22, 23]. RNAi is triggered by endogenous or exogenous 21\u201323 nt RNA duplexes [17], and shRNA and siRNA are two commonly used RNA molecules to block gene expression [17, 24]. Compared with siRNA, the interference efficiency induced by shRNA was more effective. Recently, the interference efficiency of shRNA in some coronaviruses has been studied. Wang designed and constructed three recombinant plasmids targeting the M gene of porcine TGEV. After transfection into PK15 cells, M gene expression was reduced by 13, 68, and 70% [17]. Shen et al. [15] have constructed five shRNA-expressing plasmids targeting the N, M, and S genes of PEDV. PEDV RNA in Vero cells pre-transfected with these plasmids was reduced by 22\u201394.5%. However, because the success rate of PDCoV isolation was low [1, 6, 25], there are no reports on the use of shRNA to inhibit replication of PDCoV, which belongs to the same virus family as PEDV and TGEV.",

In this study, we designed two shRNAs based on the theoretically valid sequences of the M and N genes of PDCoV with nucleotide positions of 328\u2013346 (M) and 270\u2013288 (N), and established three shRNA recombinant expression plasmids to study whether shRNA-mediated RNAi inhibited PDCoV replication in vitro. To guarantee a similar RNAi effect on different PDCoV strains, the two theoretically effective sequences were analyzed by BLAST to ensure that they did not have any similar sequences in the swine genome, but shared 100% similarity with the published sequences of different PDCoV strains. Both the shRNAs inhibited PDCoV replication in ST cells. The interference properties were revealed by reductions in CPE formation, virus TCID50 titers, and viral RNA copy numbers in the infected cells. The CPE and TCID50 assay of pGenesil-M- and pGenesil-N-transfected cells showed viral suppression 48 h after infection and the titers of pGenesil-M- and pGenesil-N-transfected cells were reduced 13.2- and 32.4-fold, respectively. The real-time quantitative RT-PCR assay showed that the viral RNA copy number was reduced by 45.8% in pGenesil-M-transfected cells and 56.1% in pGenesil-M-transfected cells. The inhibitory efficiency of pGenesil-N was higher than that of pGenesil-M. Although the interference efficiency of shRNAs against PDCoV in our study was lower than that of the shRNAs targeting other coronaviruses [15, 17], these results indicate that RNAi against PDCoV mediated by shRNAs can inhibit PDCoV replication in vitro. A disadvantage of this transient transfection/expression system is that virus replication can be inhibited only in cells that are expressing the shRNA, and cells not expressing the shRNA can be infected. Therefore, one explanation for the lower interference efficiency of shRNAs against PDCoV in this study compared to shRNAs targeting other coronaviruses in other studies could be lower transfection efficiency of the shRNA expression plasmids.",
