Sequence analysis was conducted by using Vector NTI (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). To obtain the S1 segment, we extracted total RNA from infected BGM cells with TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen). The double-stranded RNA was obtained as previously described (15) and separated through migration on a 6% precast Poly(NAT) gel (Elchrom Scientific AG, Cham, Switzerland). A \u22481,400-bp band was recovered from the gel and directly used for RT-PCR with random primers (Invitrogen and Roche [La Rochelle, France]). The PCR products were purified from the gel and cloned, and several clones were sequenced. To complete the S1 sequencing, a specific S1 primer was constructed and used for the RT step. The amplification was done by using the specific S1 primer and a random primer (Roche). The band corresponding to the expected size (684 bp) was purified from the gel, cloned, and sequenced. The new sequences enabled construction of specific primers at each extremity (Table 1) to amplify the entire S1 segment and sequence in both directions.",

Results of his neurologic examination were normal, except for palsy of the left facial nerve. The Glasgow Coma Scale score was 7. He could respond to simple verbal commands, such as requests to open eyes or make some other movements, but he was lethargic (no articulated language) and had epilepsy-like abnormal movements of the face or distal muscles. For 2 days previously, he had experienced a prodromal illness with high temperature (40\u00b0) and headache. Results of an analysis of CSF on the first day of hospitalization were within normal limits and showed a protein level of 0.81 g/L and 4 leukocytes/mm3 on day 5. An electroencephalogram showed generalized slow-wave activity. Computed tomography of the brain showed a low-density change in the thalami. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed on the first day of hospitalization showed multiple symmetric lesions, with high signal intensity on T2-weighted images and low signal intensity on T1-weighted images, mostly involving the thalami bilaterally but also the brainstem tegmentum (Figure 1, panel A) and cerebral white matter in external capsules. He received treatment in the intensive care unit and was given acyclovir, methylprednisolone, and clonazepam intravenously. Beginning 2 days after he arrived at the hospital, he showed improvement, and he recovered completely in a few weeks. He was discharged on the 25th day of illness. A follow-up brain MRI, 1 year later, showed no abnormal findings. Three years later, his development and neurologic examination results were within normal limits.",

Indeed, indirect immunofluorescence on fixed cells was positive for enterovirus (Pan-Enterovirus Blend, Light Diagnostics [Millipore, Molsheim, France]), but results of RT-PCR for detection of enteroviruses, performed on the cell culture supernatant, were negative. The virus isolates were then identified as reovirus type 2 by seroneutralization at the National Reference Center for Enteroviruses (Lyon, France). The discrepancy initially observed between immunofluoresence and RT-PCR results may be attributed to the cross-reactivity of the Pan-Entero Blend reagent toward reoviruses, as mentioned in the manufacturer\u2019s description.

The S1 segment determines the reovirus serotype and encodes the nonstructural protein sigma 1s and the viral cell attachment protein sigma 1. The S1 gene showed a high identity score (83%) with human type 2 strains isolated from fecal specimens of 2 children in China in 1982 (18,23). This finding was compatible with the results of the neutralization assay performed with the initial infected cell culture supernatant. The S1 segment from reoviruses is highly diverse in size and sequence. This diversity may explain why, even within the same serotype, the S1 segment could not be amplified with a different set of primers initially defined by alignment of reovirus serotype 2 strains. The S3 segment is genetically similar to that of the human reovirus strains T2Neth/73 and T2Neth/84 (98% identity) isolated in the Netherlands in 1973 and 1984 (24). The S3 gene is known to encode the nonstructural protein \u03c3NS (25,26), which plays a notable role in the replication of reovirus gene segments and assortment (27,28). On the basis of these data, we conclude that the novel type 2 human reovirus, designated MRV2Tou05, might have originated from a reassortment between a human isolate and a swine reovirus, both probably first identified in China.",

Influenza-associated encephalopathy has been mostly reported in children in Japan and Taiwan, which suggests a possible association with genetic or epigenetic factors in these countries (30). A similar disorder has been described as autosomal dominant ANE with incomplete penetrance in only 1 large family. It affects children, and clinical and radiologic findings seem identical to ANE, with sudden-onset encephalopathy triggered by viral infection including influenza. The outcome, however, seems worse, with death, mild to severe developmental regression, and recurrence in half of the survivors (33).
