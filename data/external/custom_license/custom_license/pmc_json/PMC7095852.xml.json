Med.\n9, 487; 2003). With fresh data from the SARS outbreaks, however, many now say that isolating even a small percentage of those who have been exposed to the illness\u2014but who are not yet ill\u2014could help quell an outbreak.",

Sinai Hospital in Toronto. There is no data to support that someone infected with SARS can transmit the coronavirus during the incubation period\u2014the time between exposure to the virus and the onset of symptoms. Patients become infectious as they enter the advanced and more symptomatic stages of the disease, giving scientists a window of several days in which to diagnose and isolate infected people.",
