The natural pattern, called sable or fitch, features a yellowish coat with dark patches over the limbs and tail, a facial mask and dark brown eyes. Ferrets have anal scent glands and sebaceous glands but lack sweat glands and hence are particularly susceptible to heat1. Adult males weigh \u223c2 kg, whereas females are smaller at \u223c1 kg. Ferrets live for roughly 6\u20138 years.",
