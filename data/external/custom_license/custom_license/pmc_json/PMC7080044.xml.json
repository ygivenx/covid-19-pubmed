            "text": "Human fibroblast growth factor 23 (hFGF23), a member of the FGF superfamily, was first identified in 2000 (Yamashita et al. 2000). The full-length hFGF23 consists of 251 amino acids with a signal peptide of 24 amino acids at the N-terminus, splicing a mature FGF23 polypeptide of 227 amino acids (Yamashita et al. 2000). FGF23 reduces serum phosphate by inhibiting both proximal tubular phosphate reabsorption and intestinal phosphate absorption (Shimada et al. 2004). This is concerning the FGF23 physiological function of regulating phosphate metabolism; on the other hand, mutations in FGF23 are implicated in a wide range of disorders. Both autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets and X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets were caused by excess FGF23, leading to hypophosphatemia (2000; Jonsson et al. 2003; Yamazaki et al. 2002). FGF23 levels are increased tenfold above controls in patients with tumor-induced osteomalacia, a tumor associated syndrome of renal phosphate wasting (Jonsson et al. 2003; Yamazaki et al. 2002). Circulating FGF23 levels are also increased and correlate with disease burden in patients with fibrous dysplasia, a disorder in which normal bone is replaced by fibro-osseous tissue (Riminucci et al. 2003). Reduced FGF23 signaling also causes pathology. Familial tumoral calcinosis is a disorder marked by hyperphosphatemia in which individuals develop calcified masses, often within the joints (Lyles et al. 1985). In addition, in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), FGF23 concentrations are elevated constitutively and increase progressively as kidney function worsens (Gutierrez et al. 2005), suggesting a direct link between increased FGF23 and the progression of CKD (Fliser et al. 2007).",

In the next step, it is necessary to prepare sufficient hFGF23 with activity for further mechanisms and pharmacological research. Yamashita et al (2000) has expressed FGF23 in CHO mammalian cell. It is well known that the mammalian cell expression system is more complicated and costly from the standpoint of culture requirements, making this strategy difficult to use in the development of large-scale fermentation processes. Furthermore, the preparation of sufficient amounts of virus for large-scale expression is time consuming. To overcome this shortcoming, Plotnikov et al. (2000) expressed FGF23 in Escherichia coli in the form of an inclusion body; however, because the inclusion bodies must be denatured and annealed, it was difficult to produce bioactive protein. Our previous experiments showed that FGF23 without using this fusion strategy was least effective in expression and solubility properties.",

Various proteins, such as SARS virus protein (Zuo et al. 2005), MMP13 (Marblestone et al. 2006), EGF (Sun et al. 2008), metallothionein (Huang et al. 2009), KGF2 (Wu et al. 2009), and FGF21 (Wang et al. 2010), have been expressed successfully and purified using this fusion strategy. Thus, we also cloned a SUMO fragment and constructed an expression plasmid-containing SUMO and human FGF23. The results show that this novel method of protein expression can promote significantly greater rFGF23 levels, facilitating the dissolution of rFGF23 in the soluble fraction for purification and producing native N-terminal recombinant protein with its bioactivity preserved.",

Whereas, FGF23, when fused with SUMO, showed higher amount of expression, but only in the host strain of Rosetta(DE3) not BL21(DE3). Because on the one hand, SUMO have a chaperone-like activity, the translational fusion of SUMO to other proteins often results in significantly improving expression of those proteins in E. coli (Butt et al. 2005; Malakhov et al. 2004; Marblestone et al. 2006; Panavas et al. 2009; Zuo et al., 2005); on the other hand, Rosetta(DE3) strain can provide additional tRNAs for E. coli rare codons (AUA, AGG, AGA, CUA, CCC, GGA), thereby increasing FGF23 gene expression. Taken together, for protein efficient expression, both were indispensable.",

We tried the glioma U251 cells for overexpressing FGFR1 to evaluate rFGF23 biological activity, and a better response is obtained (seen Fig 6a) although in the case of the absence of a Klotho receptor. Recent etiological studies indicate that high FGF23 levels are associated with increased mortality and cardiovascular dysfunction, both in patients with CKD and also in subjects with preserved renal function (Juppner et al. 2010; Shimada et al. 2004). Whether FGF23 has a direct action on cardiovascular tissues because Klotho is also not expressed there, the study of cell assay strategy is a good answer to the hypothesis put forward.",

Specific explanation is that FGF23 suppresses the expression of type 2a and 2c sodium\u2013phosphate cotransporters which mediate the physiological phosphate reabsorption in proximal tubules (Shimada et al. 2004); the other is that FGF23 decreases the expression of 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1\u03b1-hydroxylase and at the same time enhances 25-hydroxyvtamin D-24-hydroyxlase expression (Shimada et al. 2004). By modifying the expression of these vitamin D metabolizing enzymes, FGF23 acts to reduce serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D], which stimulates intestinal calcium and phosphate absorption. In our studies, we can also see that the changes in plasma phosphate levels all showed significant differences after either injecting rFGF23 or commercial FGF23, compared to negative control, but administration of rFGF23 resulted in a time-dependent better reduction in circulating levels of phosphate than commercial FGF23. We speculated that different effects might be due to different expression form in E. coli.",

The identity of the purified protein was confirmed by Western blot, and its purity was determined by HPLC analysis. The recombinant FGF23 can induce phosphorylation of 44/42 MAP kinase (p44/42 MAPK) in the glioma U251 cell line. The results of animal experiments in vivo also showed that rFGF23 produced by using this method can decrease the concentration of plasma phosphate in normal rats fed with a fixed formula diet. This study demonstrated that SUMO, when fused with FGF23, was able to promote the soluble expression of the latter in E. coli, making it convenient to purify rFGF23 with its bioactivity preserved.",
