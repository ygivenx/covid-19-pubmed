Identified mechanisms of persistence include mutational escape from T-cell responses, resistance to interferons, expression of cytokine decoy receptors, inhibition of the cellular antigen-presentation machinery, glycan shielding of surface glycoproteins and integration into the host's genome2,3,4,5. Virus sanctuaries\u2014persistence of virus in extralymphatic tissues\u2014not only complicate virus elimination, they also enable reactivation during immune suppression (for example, after organ transplantation)6. Virus persistence in certain tissues is partly restricted by the expression of specific receptors on tissue target cells; however, classical lymphotropic and/or hepatotropic viruses tend to persist in extralymphatic organs such as the kidney, brain, lungs, testes and salivary glands7,8,9,10,11,12. Persistence in these organs cannot always be explained by selective receptor expression; it also cannot be due simply to continuous virus spillover from the blood, as peripheral virus isolates differ phylogenetically from blood virus isolates and extralymphatic virus has been detected in individuals without viremia13.",

T helper cells are known to support CD8+ T-cell responses that destroy cells infected with persisting viruses such as HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and LCMV17,18,19. However, the outcome of chronic HIV, HCV or CMV infections cannot always be predicted from T-cell responses20,21,22. Paradoxically, potent immune activation is a risk factor for end-stage disease in HIV23 and simian immunodeficiency (SIV) infections24 and has been associated with disease severity in cases of human influenza virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus infection25,26. Experimental immunization with T helper epitopes has even been found to worsen the outcome of SIV infection in rhesus macaques27. We and others have recently described T helper cell\u2013driven suppression of neutralizing antibody formation after LCMV infection28,29. These findings together indicate that potent immune activation, which is usually beneficial, can sometimes be disadvantageous. To help delineate the mechanisms that influence this equilibrium, we have investigated the roles of specific T cells and protective antibodies in enhancing or preventing the formation of extralymphatic persisting virus sanctuaries.",

            "text": "C57BL/6 mice infected with low-dose (200 plaque-forming units (PFU)) LCMV (WE strain), rapidly cleared the virus from all organs tested within 10 d (Fig. 1a). Infection of extralymphatic organs was absent or low, even at the peak of virus replication. To allow the virus to spread widely in the mouse before the onset of the CD8+ T cell\u2013derived immune response, we transiently depleted CD8+ T cells by administering monoclonal antibodies 1 or 2 d before infection (that is, on day \u22122 or day \u22121) with LCMV-WE (standard protocol, used throughout this manuscript). Ten days after infection, mice that had been depleted of CD8+ T cells showed virus replication in all organs tested (Fig. 1a). After their initial depletion, CD8+ T cells reemerged in the blood around day 10 after infection and then expanded, peaking at day 20 after infection as assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of peripheral blood (Fig. 1b). This expansion of CD8+ T cells was almost completely virus specific, as up to 80% of these CD8+ T cells were tetramer-specific for known immunodominant virus epitopes (GP33-41, GP276-284 and NP396-404) (Fig. 1c; for representative FACS plot, see Supplementary Fig. 1a online). The CD8+ T cells were mostly of a CD62Llo phenotype, indicating activation (Fig. 1d). Most CD8+ T cells expressed granzyme B, and a small fraction produced interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) directly ex vivo without further restimulation (Fig. 1e; for representative FACS plots see Supplementary Fig. 1b). To determine the importance of T helper cells in CD8+ T-cell priming and proliferation in our model, we infected Cd4\u2212/\u2212 mice with 200 PFU LCMV-WE using the standard protocol described above. Expansion of CD8+ T cells in peripheral blood, as detected by FACS, was suppressed in Cd4\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 1b). CD8+ T cells were less activated, as downregulation of the selectin CD62L was impaired (Fig. 1d). Granzyme B\u2013expressing CD8+ T cells were also relatively reduced in the absence of T helper cells (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig. 1b). By contrast, adoptive transfer of naive, virus-specific T-cell receptor transgenic CD4+ T helper cells (Smarta cells30) before LCMV infection of C57BL/6 mice (C57BL/6+Smarta) enhanced CD8+ T-cell activation. CD62L downregulation and direct ex vivo granzyme B expression were both greater than in control C57BL/6 mice (Fig. 1d,e). Transfer of Smarta T helper cells augmented formation of IFN-\u03b3 by T helper cells (Supplementary Fig. 1c). At the same time that CD8+ T cells peaked in mouse blood samples, the mice lost weight (Fig. 1f) and developed hepatitis, as indicated by elevated serum bilirubin concentrations and augmented liver transaminase activity in serum (Fig. 1g,h). Both weight loss and hepatitis correlated markedly with the number of available T helper cells (Fig. 1f\u2013h). Thus, CD8+ T-cell expansion and expression of effector functions (granzyme B and IFN\u03b3) correlated with available T-cell help.",

In keeping with our earlier results28, the formation of neutralizing antibodies was, paradoxically, delayed and reduced in mice supplemented with Smarta T helper cells, to a similar extent as in mice lacking CD4+ T cells (Fig. 3a). To test whether the delayed antibody formation was responsible for the observed site-specific virus persistence, we analyzed virus elimination in mice deficient in antibody formation. Aicda\u2212/\u2212 mice lack activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) and therefore do not undergo immunoglobulin class switch recombination and affinity maturation, whereas other B-cell functions, including IgM responses, remain effective31. LCMV-infected Aicda\u2212/\u2212 mice did not produce neutralizing antibodies, as shown by a neutralization assay (Fig. 3a), and also did not produce LCMV glycoprotein\u2013specific IgG responses, as tested by ELISAs (Supplementary Fig. 4b,c online). Notably, there were only slight differences in numbers of virus-specific CD8+ T cells, distribution of epitopes, production of IFN-\u03b3, and CD8+ T-cell cytotoxicity between Aicda\u2212/\u2212 mice and C57BL/6 mice (Supplementary Fig. 3a\u2013e online). Like C57Bl/6 mice supplemented with Smarta cells, the LCMV-infected Aicda\u2212/\u2212 mice showed site-specific virus persistence, as indicated by significantly lower viral titers in the spleen and liver 30 d after infection when compared to the kidneys, lungs and brain (Fig. 3b). In contrast, RAG-deficient mice had evenly distributed high viral titers in all organs tested (Fig. 3c). Site-specific persistence was also found in Aicda\u2212/\u2212 mice that were infected with another LCMV strain, LCMV-Armstrong (Fig. 3d), and in Aicda\u2212/\u2212 mice infected with high doses of LCMV-WE without initial transient CD8+ T-cell depletion (Fig. 3e).",

Viral organ titers were measured 20 d later (see experimental schedule, Fig. 4a). Fifty days after LCMV infection, Aicda\u2212/\u2212 mice without cell transfer showed the lowest viral titers in the liver and brain but had high titers in the spleen, lungs and kidneys (Fig. 4b\u2013f). The increase in spleen viral titers at day 50 compared to day 30 is probably due to CD8+ T-cell exhaustion, which has been described to occur more rapidly in lymphoid tissue than in other organs32. Control C57BL/6 mice had almost completely cleared virus from all organs at this time point (Fig. 4b\u2013f). LCMV-specific adoptive B-cell transfer into Aicda\u2212/\u2212 mice was successful, as indicated by the rapid formation of LCMV glycoprotein\u2013specific IgG (Supplementary Fig. 4b), and was associated with significantly reduced viral titers in the kidneys and a trend toward lower titers in the lungs (Fig. 4e,f). By contrast, T-cell transfer did not significantly reduce viral titers in the kidneys or lungs (Fig. 4e,f). Transfer of LCMV glycoprotein\u2013specific neutralizing antibodies into Aicda\u2212/\u2212 mice did not lower viral titers in the kidneys or lungs and did not induce measurable glycoprotein-specific IgG responses, implying that the antibodies were rapidly consumed by circulating virus particles (data not shown). We also analyzed LCMV-infected VI10Yen mice. In these mice, most naive B cells are specific for vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)33. These mice did not produce LCMV-neutralizing antibodies for up to 50 d after infection (Fig. 3a); however, in contrast to AID-deficient mice, they eventually formed LCMV glycoprotein\u2013specific IgG antibodies (Supplementary Fig. 4c). CD8+ T-cell function in infected VI10Yen mice was comparable to that in C57BL/6 mice (data not shown). Compared to those in AID-deficient mice, viral titers in the kidneys were significantly lower in VI10Yen mice, mimicking the result of virus-specific B-cell transfer (Fig. 4b\u2013f).",

In these mice, the virus was found mainly in the kidney interstitial space, rather than in epithelial cells. (Fig. 6a, vi). IgG staining in these mice localized to the same interstitial sites, supporting the idea that virus-antibody immune complexes form there (Fig. 6a, xii). Interstitial IgG deposition was also found in C57BL/6 mice, implying that interstitial IgG deposition remained after virus elimination (Fig. 6a, xi). As expected, IgG staining was not detectable in infected Rag1\u2212/\u2212 mice and Aicda\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 6a, vii\u2013ix). When LCMV-neutralizing IgG was injected into infected Aicda\u2212/\u2212 mice IgG deposits were found mostly in kidney glomeruli, but usually not in the interstitial space surrounding the LCMV-infected epithelia (Fig. 6b), and LCMV kidney titers remained unchanged (data not shown). Thus, virus elimination from kidneys correlated with the formation of interstitial IgG deposits, presumably produced by kidney-infiltrating B cells. Plasma cells could easily be found within kidneys in immunohistological analyses (Fig. 6b). Kidney plasma cells were also observed in Aicda\u2212/\u2212 mice and C57BL/6 mice, whereas IgG deposition between kidney tubules was absent in Aicda\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 6b).",

CD8+ T cells, supported by helper T cells, efficiently cleared the virus from some organs but not other organs. Virus was particularly persistent in the kidneys and lungs, but more efficiently cleared from the liver and spleen. We speculate that site-specific viral persistence develops as a consequence of overactivated and exhausted T-cell responses combined with slow induction of virus-specific neutralizing antibodies. Such a combination is typical for several chronic human virus infections34. B cell\u2013deficient mice with primed T cells specific for \u03b3-herpesvirus do not eliminate the virus from the lungs, but do eliminate it from all other organs, upon reinfection35. In addition, X-linked lymphoproliferative disease is similarly characterized by an overreactive cellular immune response combined with slow induction and low levels of virus-specific antibodies; this combination might lead to fatal outcomes of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in humans and of LCMV infection in mice36. In our model of infection by LCMV, the CD8+ T-cell response against distributed viral antigen was strengthened by the help of CD4+ T cells, as shown previously18. Similar findings exist for SIV and other persisting viruses17,19.",

Other models of persistent virus infection have similarly proposed that B-cell responses are associated with virus elimination37,38. Histological analysis showed that T cells efficiently infiltrated virus-infected epithelia, in a pattern reminiscent of 'autoreactivity' (for example, interstitial nephritis, bronchiolitis or Sj\u00f6gren-like disease, which might convert into overt autoimmune disease). Although we did not detect CTL-escape variants at extralymphatic sites up to 50 d after infection, the observed colocalization of CD8+ T cells with the virus might eventually create sites conducive to the formation of CTL-escape mutants40. Lymphomas associated with chronic viral infection, which often arise in extralymphatic tissues, could be a consequence of ongoing extralymphatic immune responses. Together, our findings might explain why chronic virus infections, lymphomas and autoimmunity have been described as forming a triple association40.",

Whereas T-cell responses can effectively clear the virus from both lymphatic and more 'solid' extralymphatic organs such as the liver, IgG responses are especially needed in organs with tubular epithelial microanatomy, such as the kidneys and lungs. The relative contributions of these two adaptive arms of the immune system also regulate immunopathological disease mediated by chronic inflammation. Thus, boosting of T-cell responses alone might not reduce virus persistence41 and might eventually induce immunopathology or autoimmunity36. Our results indicate that virus replication, tropism and sanctuary formation depend on the specific virus and on organ anatomy and physiology, but also on the induction, kinetics and efficacy of different adaptive immune effector mechanisms.",
