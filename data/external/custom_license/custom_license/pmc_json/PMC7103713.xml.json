However, adverse outcomes are far more likely in immunocompromised patients than in nonimmunocompromised individuals and include progression to pneumonia, respiratory failure, and increased mortality rates (1\u20134). In fact, the LRTI rates and mortality rates for hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients and patients with hematological malignancies reportedly range from 10% to 50% [2\u20135]. Long-term complications associated with respiratory viral infections, such as airflow obstruction and bronchiolitis obliterans, have developed in HSCT and lung transplant recipients [6,7].

NAIs are virustatic, not virucidal, and early administration of them is a key factor in the development of resistance to the virus and their effectiveness. Treatment with these inhibitors should neither be delayed while awaiting the results of diagnostic testing nor withheld from infected patients with indications for therapy who present more than 48 h after the onset of symptoms, particularly patients needing hospitalization [8].

However, no clear evidence indicates that doubling the dose of oseltamivir is a more effective treatment than administering the normally prescribed dose in hospitalized patient, with or without severe illness [33,34]. In a randomized trial of hospitalized patients with severe influenza, mortality rates were similar for patients who received oseltamivir at the double and standard doses [33]. However, 4 patients on the standard dose arm who were infected with influenza A (H1N1) virus without the H275Y substitution at baseline acquired this substitution while on treatment. Although no inferences can be made so far due to the small number of patients, using higher dose to prevent resistance and clinical failure in severely ill patients or immunocompromised patients still need to be determined in future studies [33]. In addition, a prospective study of adults hospitalized with influenza A and B infections treated with a single or double dose of oseltamivir twice daily demonstrated no differences between the groups in viral clearance, fever duration, oxygen supplementation, or hospitalization length [34].",

Genotypic and phenotypic antiviral susceptibility testing are currently available to check the presence of mutations conferring resistance [36]. The more common emergence of resistance to oseltamivir in immunocompromised patients probably partly owes to prolonged viral shedding despite the use of antiviral therapy [37].

In a phase IIa randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of adult lung transplant recipients with confirmed RSV URTIs, use of aerosolized ALN-RSV01 (0.6 mg/kg) daily for 3 days significantly reduced mean cumulative daily symptom scores (P = 0.035) and the incidence of progressive bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome by day 90 more so than in patients given a placebo (6% vs. 50 %; P = 0.027) [107].
