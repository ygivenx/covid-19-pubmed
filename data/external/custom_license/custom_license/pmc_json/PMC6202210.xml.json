Assays to detect YFV-Rluc replicon activity were conducted similar to HCV replicon studies, with detection of intracellular Renilla luciferase using the Renilla Luciferase Assay System (Promega).

The remaining lysate was added to the beads and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C on a rotator. The next morning, the supernatant was collected and beads were washed four times with washing buffer. A 3xFLAG peptide (Sigma #4799) was used to elute bound products off the column at 4\u00b0C with constant vortexing for one hour. Input samples and eluted products were run on a SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a PVDF membrane, which was probed with antibodies against BiP or FLAG (rabbit polyclonal).",
