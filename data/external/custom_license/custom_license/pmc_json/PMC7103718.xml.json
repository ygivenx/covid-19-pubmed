It is further defined by a \u2018history of sporadic respiratory symptoms that can vary in severity and are accompanied by variable expiratory airflow limitation\u2019 [1]. Exacerbations represent a deterioration of symptoms and lung function from stable status requiring increased medication or an unscheduled hospital visit. The impact of asthma exacerbations is substantial. They account for ~50% of total expenditure on asthma care and remain a substantial ongoing challenge for the clinical management of this disease [2,3]. In developed nations such as Australia, asthma remains the most frequent cause of acute admissions to hospital [4].",

For control of more severe disease, inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are remarkably effective anti-inflammatory drugs and have remained the frontline \u2018preventer\u2019 therapy for asthma since the early 1970s [5]. ICS prevent worsening symptoms by controlling inflammation via several mechanisms including glucocorticoid receptor (GR) interaction with negative glucocorticoid response element (GRE) sites. Transrepression also occurs via GR-steroid binding pro-inflammatory transcription factors such as AP-1 and NF-\u03baB. Histone modification is another mechanism by which inflammatory gene expression is suppressed [6]. Glucocorticoids also exhibit systemic side effects and these are often mediated by GR-steroid complexes binding to GRE sites leading to gene transactivation [6].",

Rather than increasing the dose of ICS, these patients can be prescribed combination therapy consisting of ICS with a long-acting \u03b22-adrenergic receptor agonist (LABA). This can be administered via a single inhaler which is a preparation that contains ICS and LABA. Combination therapy offers advantages over ICS-only inhaler treatment as they can be used as both a reliever and a preventer. This leads to better symptom control, reduced risk of exacerbation with lower doses of ICS [7,8]. The mechanism of action of combination therapy has been investigated. LABA has been shown to augment the anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative effects of ICS [9] and synergistically suppress the expression of potentially immuopathogenic chemokines by rhinovirus (RV)-infected bronchial epithelial cells (BECs) [10].",

Increased use of reliever SABA is recommended as the first-line approach for worsening asthma symptoms with maintenance of usual ICS or ICS/LABA preventer medication. If increased use of reliever fails to reverse symptoms then increased use of preventer therapy is advised. Thus, current management of asthma exacerbations essentially involves increased treatment with the drugs that failed to prevent the exacerbation occurring in the first place [11]. Current preventive and therapeutic strategies such as ICS in combination with LABA are of limited efficacy particularly for children with viral wheeze [12]. In another study of children with acute asthma and symptoms of respiratory virus infection, it was observed that they responded less effectively to \u03b2-agonists than during stable disease [13]. So why do current treatment approaches fail to prevent virus-induced asthma? This may be explained in part by interference with anti-viral immunity. Corticosteroid\u2013LABA combination has been reported to inhibit production of pro-inflammatory immune mediators by RV-infected in vitro-cultured undifferentiated BECs [10,14]. CXCL10 was one of the chemokines inhibited by ICS/LABA treatment. This interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) is involved in recruitment and activation of NK- and Th1 cells which are involved in the type-1 IFN-mediated anti-viral response to RV [15]. The concept that ICS/LABA can indiscriminately interfere with anti-viral immunity is further supported by studies in human epithelial cells and peripheral blood mono-nuclear cells (PBMCs) [16,17].",

This has led to the development of additional therapies that target inflammatory pathways implicated in pulmonary inflammation and bronchoconstriction. These include the 5-lipoxygenase pathway (FLAP) and production of leukotrienes (LT). There are two classes of LT \u2013 cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLT) and LTB4. They are inflammatory lipid mediators that are generated by the arachidonic acid (AA) pathway in activated immune cells. AA from membrane phospholipids is catalyzed by phospholipase A2 before conversion to LTA4 by 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO). Mast cells, macrophages, eosinophils, and basophils convert this molecule to the CysLT LTC4 which is the precursor for the other cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTD4 and LTE4). Although the potency of each can vary in different settings, all three CysLTs can stimulate airway smooth muscle contraction and increase vascular permeability [22].",

Increased CysLT production is associated with acute asthma likely reflecting activation of these inflammatory cells that are present in the airways during viral asthma exacerbations [24,25]. There are two classes (CysLT1R and CysLT2R) of classical G protein-coupled receptors for CysLT. Human CysLT1R is the predominant CysLT receptor in the airways and is expressed by airway smooth muscle cells, macrophages, and mast cells [26]. LTD4 is the predominant ligand for this receptor and increases intracellular calcium and smooth muscle contraction. Monteleukast is a CysLT1R antagonist that has been shown to improve lung function in patients presenting to the emergency department with an exacerbation providing further evidence of the immunopathological role of CysLTs in acute asthma [27]. The enzymes that catalyze production of CysLTs can also be targeted by drugs such as the 5-LO inhibitor zileuton. A number of other FLAP inhibitors are currently being developed [28].",

ACh can also be produced by (non-neuronal) airway epithelial cells [30]. Anticholinergics such as the long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonist (LAMA) tiotropium bromide can reduce cholinergic activity impacting on airway smooth muscle tone and mucus hypersecretion by blocking neuronal acetylcholine. Tiotropium has also been reported to reduce non-neuronal ACh augmented IL-13-induced goblet cell metaplasia in air-liquid interface (ALI)-differentiated airway epithelial cell cultures [31]. In human clinical trials the bronchodilatory activity of SABA could be augmented by the use of LAMA to improve treatment outcomes in children and adults with acute, moderate to severe exacerbations [32,33]. For severe, persistent, poorly controlled asthma, the addition of tiotropium to high-dose combination therapy improved lung function over 24 hours [34]. Inhaler tiotropium bromide has demonstrated efficacy for treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations [35]. In Phase III human clinical trials in asthma, it provided sustained bronchodilation whilst reducing the frequency of exacerbations [36]. Inhaled tiotropium bromide is now licensed for use as an add-on therapy for adults on maintenance combination therapy who have had at least one severe exacerbation in the previous year [37]. A number of other anticholinergic drugs including glycopyrronium (Seebri), aclidinium bromide (Forest Laboratories and Almirall), and umeclidinium bromide (GlaxoSmithKline and Theravance) are also approved for the treatment of COPD and are at various stages of development for the prevention asthma exacerbations [38].",

There is good evidence that persistent atopic sensitization associated with activated type-2 immunity is a key driver of asthma in children [42,43]. Asthmatic adults represent a far more heterogeneous population. Even so, a Th2-high immune signature has been reported in approximately 50% of adult asthmatics [44]. Type-2 cytokines produced by Th2 cells are critical to many responses that drive allergic airways inflammation and disease in asthma. IL-4 and IL-13 are required for IgE synthesis and IL-5 is required for eosinophil recruitment, maturation, and survival. IL-9 is required for mast cell activation. IL-13 induces airway hyperreactivity (AHR), mucus hypersecretion, and metaplasia of mucus-producing cells.",

            "text": "Allergic asthma is the most common form of the disease. IgE plays a central role in allergic inflammation. Activation of Fc\u03b5R1 on mast cells and basophils by cross-linking of IgE promotes degranulation and release of pro-inflammatory mediator leading to increased inflammation. Omalizumab (Xolair), first approved by the USA in 2003, is a monoclonal antibody that binds and neutralizes IgE thus preventing activation of Fc\u03b5R1. Omalizumab reduces serum-free IgE levels by binding to the constant region (c\u03b53) which prevents IgE from interacting with its receptor Fc\u03b5R1. In addition to this, an early study in a group of 15 subjects who were allergic to dust mite showed that treatment with Omalizumab not only reduces serum-free IgE but also decreases Fc\u03b5R1 expression on circulating basophils from these subjects [51]. Omalizumab has been shown to effectively reduce asthma exacerbations, improve symptom control, and reduce the need for ICS and beta-agonists in Phase II and Phase III trials of severe atopic asthmatics [52]. Recent expert panel guidelines recommend considering Omalizumab as an alternative or in addition to oral corticosteroids in Step V and VI patients with severe allergic asthma. Two studies have examined prophylactic treatment and reported significant reductions for exacerbations (some of which were caused by a viral infection) in the Omalizumab-treated group [53,54]. One of the studies identified an association between increased IFN-\u03b1 production and fewer exacerbations in the omalizumab treatment group and implicated inhibition of Ig\u03b5RI cross-linking by IgE as involved in this response [54]. The mechanism linking IgE-receptor binding and regulation of IFN production during viral infection in asthma has been investigated. Fc\u03b5R1 is on plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), a crucial innate immune cell that produces large amounts of type I IFN in response to viral infection. It was observed that activation of Fc\u03b5R1 could inhibit the ability of pDC to secrete IFN-\u03b1 in response to TRL9 stimulation [55]. Gill and colleagues extended these observations and demonstrated deficient influenza-induced IFN induction by pDCs from asthmatic subjects compared to healthy subjects and confirmed that cross-linking of F\u0441\u025bR1 led to profound inhibition of virus induction of IFN-\u03b1 [56]. Further studies showed that F\u0441\u025bR1 cross-linked PBMCs from children with asthma had deficient RV-induced IFN production [57]. This suggests that omalizumab could also be used to enhance pDC mediated antiviral responses in the treatment of virus-induced asthma exacerbations.",

We have recently performed experimental RV infections in atopic asthmatic and healthy human subjects and observed that expression of IL-33 protein in the bronchial mucosal lining fluid was associated with increased type-2 cytokine production and asthma exacerbation symptom severity.

Jackson et al. examined the relationship between early-life virus-induced wheeze and asthma development in an at-risk (parents have a history of respiratory allergy/asthma) cohort of children (COAST study [81]). They showed that RV infections conferred the greatest probability (odd ratio = 9.8) for asthma development by age 6 [82]. Respiratory viral infections are also the cause of most asthma exacerbations. The precise mechanisms by which viral infections make asthma worse are still poorly understood. One reason for this is the difficulty inherent in repeatedly sampling the lower airways and accurately measuring the presence of infectious virus during an exacerbation. Nonetheless, inhibiting viral replication and reducing virus-induced inflammation is a sensible approach and treatments that stimulate anti-viral immunity are a potential therapy. Unlike the immune-blocking approaches described earlier, the aim here is to precisely stimulate innate anti-viral immunity thereby limiting replication and inhibiting production of asthmogenic immune mediators. The idea is that Toll-like receptors detect infection and induce expression of innate anti-viral interferons which play a key role in reducing viral load via induction of anti-viral molecules directly and initiation of a type-I immune response that antagonizes type-2 immunity and associated pulmonary allergic inflammation. The major caveat to an immune-stimulatory approach is the potential to promote inflammation and cause worse disease. Clearly, the anti-viral/immune-regulatory versus inflammatory profile of any drug in this category will need to be meticulously assessed pre-clinically before moving into human asthma trials.",

Reduced TLR7 function has been associated with asthma [86,87]. In a pre-clinical study, treatment with a TLR7 agonist in a mouse model of allergic asthma prevented development of airway resistance, leukocyte infiltration, and suppressed production of type 2 cytokines [88]. We have shown that Allergic Tlr7(-/-) mice displayed impaired IFN release upon RV1B infection, with increased virus replication and eosinophilic inflammation and airways hyper reactivity. Treatment with exogenous IFN or adoptive transfer of TLR7-competent pDCs blocked these exaggerated inflammatory responses. TLR7 expression in the lungs was suppressed by allergic inflammation and by IL-5-induced eosinophilia in the absence of allergy. We then examined endobronchial biopsies from subjects with moderate-to-severe asthma and eosinophilic but not neutrophilic airways inflammation, despite inhaled steroids, showed reduced TLR7 and IFN lambda 2/3 expression. Furthermore, TLR7 expression inversely correlated with percentage of sputum eosinophils [89]. This implies IL-5-induced airways eosinophilia acts as a negative regulator of TLR7 expression and antiviral responses, and provides a molecular mechanism underpinning the effect of eosinophil-targeting treatments for the prevention of asthma exacerbations. Further, in a chronic allergic asthma model, pre-treatment with a TLR7 agonist before ovalbumin antigen challenge also prevented airway remodeling, goblet cell hyperplasia and increases in airway smooth muscle mass [90]. Similar to the acute allergic asthma model, TLR7 agonist pre-treatment also reduced both type 1 and type 2 cytokines in the chronic model. Apart from its roles in innate immunity, TLR7 can also mediate human airway smooth muscle relaxation in a dose-dependent manner [91]. Given that TLR7 promotes antiviral defense and protects against virus-induced airway dysfunction, TLR7 agonists are a viable therapeutic option for virus-induced asthma exacerbations. This is supported by mouse studies showing TLR7 deficiency leads to a more severe RV-induced airways disease in house dust-mite allergic mice. This effect could be reversed with type I or type III IFN treatment [89]. GSK have developed a selective TLR7 agonist (GSK-2245035) which has been tested in a Phase 2 trial involving patients with allergic rhinitis. Intranasal delivery of <100 ng stimulated type I IFN and ISG expression without causing symptomatic inflammation [92].",

Type I IFNs are an important component of innate immune response against virus and can be induced upon stimulation of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) by bacteria and viral components [99]. Type I IFN receptor consists of two subunits, IFN-\u03b1 receptor (IFNAR)-1 (\u03b1 subunit) and IFNAR-2 (\u03b2 subunit). Upon binding with its ligand, type I IFNs signal through JAK-1 and protein-tyrosine kinase (Tyk)-2, which phosphorylates STAT-1 and STAT2 to form a heterodimer before translocating into the nucleus and binding to promoters of ISGs [98].

Type I interferon can also restrict type 2 immunopathology by acting on ILC2.

Whilst this is possible, the authors were unable to measure viral load in the lower airways and determine if increased IFN\u03bb was being stimulated by higher viral replication in the wheezing children [111]. The interaction between IFN-expression, viral replication and effect on disease is complex and each can influence the other. Another important factor appears to be disease severity.

Further analysis of a subgroup with persistent asthma of moderate or greater severity showed a deterioration in symptoms and peak flow with a cold and treatment with IFN-\u03b2 significantly improved peak flows and prevented virus-induced asthma symptoms [113].

A company (Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp)-funded Phase II study was conducted in 2007 to assess the effect of pleconaril nasal spray on colds and asthma exacerbations. No reduction in RV-positive asthma exacerbations was reported.

Given the predominance of RV in this disease an effective vaccine for this virus would have an enormous impact. We have successful vaccines for many important viral diseases \u2013 so why not RV? One principal barrier to vaccine development is viral diversity. RVs are a group within the Enterovirus genus that encompass 3 species (RV-A, B and C) that cover 150+ genetically distinct subtypes based on capsid protein sequence [126]. RV capsids consist of 4 structural proteins (VP1-4) with VP1 being the largest and primary target for neutralizing antibodies [127]. RV capsid proteins exhibit substantial antigenic diversity and as a result antibody responses to RV are similarly diverse. In fact, species A and B can be divided into 100 immunologically distinct serotypes. Serological responses to the 51 RV-C viruses have not been characterized but a similar level of antigenic diversity is likely to exist for these viruses [128]. The existence of 100+ RV serotypes explains why humans remain susceptible to infection throughout life. Despite antigenic diversity naturally occurring, antibody cross reactivity has been detected in human serum. These antibody responses varied amongst individuals (presumably because the RV infection history of each subject is different) and protection against infection was not assessed [129]. Immunization with peptides derived from RV capsid proteins has also generated cross-reactive antibodies. However, cross-reactivity was limited such that no more than 50% of RV subtypes were neutralized [130]. Thus it is becoming increasingly clear that any completely protective vaccine against RV will need to incorporate neutralizing antibody epitopes from multiple RV subtypes across three viral species which is a major challenge for vaccine design.",

Enhanced production of species B virus-specific neutralizing antibodies following infection of VP0 immunized mice with RV-B virus was also observed [133].

In susceptible individuals with chronic lower respiratory disease such as asthma infection can exacerbate symptoms requiring increased medication or professional medical intervention. It is now clear that the vast majority of asthma exacerbations are triggered by a viral infection the most common being human RV. This is particularly the case in children, where acute wheezing illnesses remain amongst the most common causes of hospitalization. In those aged six and under the combination of atopy and recurring episodes of wheeze with virus infections, in particular RV, are strongly associated with the development of asthma in later life. Bronchoconstriction and airway inflammation underpin disease in acute viral asthma and current preventive and therapeutic strategies consist of drugs that relax airway smooth muscle to reverse airway constriction and broad spectrum anti-inflammatory corticosteroids that reduce the impact of pathological immune mediators. For many asthmatics this combined approach controls their symptoms and reduces the impact of viral infections. However, there is a sub-population of asthmatics who tend to have more severe disease that is difficult to control with standard treatment. This group is susceptible to viral exacerbations and constitute the biggest burden in terms of morbidity, mortality, and health care costs associated with asthma. To address this need for new treatment options (summarized in Figure 1) much research has focused on the development of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that inhibit key immune mediators in asthma. This has been combined with research to define asthma immune phenotypes which has proven critical to the therapeutic efficacy of these new biologics. Anti-IgE (omalizumab, Xolair) is the most advanced and is now recommended for use as add-on therapy for persistent, moderate to severe atopic asthma. Xolair has been shown to reduce the incidence of asthma exacerbations; however, its specific effectiveness for viral asthma exacerbations is not known. MAbs against type-2 cytokines such as mepolizumab have completed Phase III clinical trials and have begun to be licensed for use. The airway epithelium is the site of respiratory virus infection and asthmatic airway epithelial cells can respond aberrantly to infection and produce inflammatory mediators that are potentially instrumental in the initiation of an asthma attack. Strategies being developed to address this include mAbs targeting type-2 promoting cytokines such as TSLP, IL-25, and IL-33 and adjuvanting innate epithelial anti-viral immunity with IFN\u03b2, IFN\u03bb, or TLR agonists. It is now recognized that RV infection is by far the most frequent cause of viral asthma, particularly in children. Directly targeting RVs with anti-virals or generating protective immunity with an anti-RV vaccine are other approaches being considered. Structural/antigenic diversity amongst approximately 150+ RV sub-types presents a substantial challenge for anti-viral drug- and vaccine-development.\n",

The problem of acute exacerbations of asthma and in particular the role of virus infection in triggering these events remains an important unmet need. In the next five years, emergent monoclonal antibody therapies that target type-2 airway inflammation; such as those directed against IL-5 and potentially IL-4/IL-13 will continue to become available for clinical use, with the expected benefit of substantial reductions in exacerbation frequency in those patients not controlled with ICS/LABA alone. A greater understanding of the role of other emergent cytokines, in particular IL-25, IL-33, and TSLP in acute asthma and the existence of monoclonal antibodies against them is also likely to see them deployed in the setting of preventing asthma exacerbations and possibly treating them. In regard to specific treatments that target acute viral infection in asthma, the effectiveness of nebulized IFN-\u03b2 as either an antiviral agent or immune modifier should be known. The application of other direct antiviral agents or vaccination strategies appears unlikely within this timeframe with perhaps the exception of vapendavir which is currently in Phase II clinical testing. What is unclear is whether any of these strategies will impact on the group during the first years of life who experience the most frequent episodes of virus-induced airways disease and in whom this may play a crucial role in the development of adult asthma. If clinical benefit can be demonstrated in young children, which in itself is a challenge due to difficulties in recruiting this age group for regular injections, Omalizumab may hold the most promise of modifying the development of asthma.
