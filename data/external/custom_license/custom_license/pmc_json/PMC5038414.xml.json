We found that significantly more cases have been identified in high-income settings (p<0.001 by Fisher exact test; Technical Appendix). Consequently, we produced 2 sets of calculations, 1 using data only from high-income countries and 1 that combined data from all non\u2013Middle Eastern countries. The high-income country analysis does not assume that no cases occurred in lower-income countries but shows different case detection rates across travelers\u2019 home countries.",

These analyses indicated there could have been up to 4,895 severe cases across source countries (95% CI 2,352\u20138,824). We also conducted sensitivity analyses to assess the effect of uncertainty of travelers\u2019 average length of stay in source countries (Table 2; Technical Appendix Tables 2, 3). Increases in travelers\u2019 assumed lengths of stay produced lower cumulative incidence estimates related to lower estimated infection rates, and decreases in travelers\u2019 assumed lengths of stay produced higher case estimates. For example, using data for travelers from high-income nations, a 2-day increase in average length of stay produced estimates of 2,326 severe cases across source countries (95% CI 924\u20134,714; Technical Appendix Table 2), and a 2-day decrease in lengths of stay produced estimates of 5,463 severe cases (95% CI 2,171\u201311,071).",
