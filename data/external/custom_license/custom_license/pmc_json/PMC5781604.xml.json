Residual upper respiratory specimens, collected for diagnostic testing, were submitted to the MDH-Public Health Laboratory from December 2013 to February 2014. Specimens were tested for 22 viral and bacterial pathogens by real-time PCR. Admission records, including history and physical, were reviewed to identify patients meeting SARI case definition (cough, shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing, with or without fever), and medical records were reviewed to obtain demographic and clinical data on patients with submitted specimens.",

There were no detections of enterovirus, influenza B, coronavirus 229E, Bordetella, Legionella pneumophila, or mycoplasma all other detections are presented in the table. 204 (19%) pediatric patients had >1 pathogen detected compared to 2 (2%) adult patients (p< 0.01). The most common pediatric co-detection was RSV and rhinovirus (xx/204).\n",
