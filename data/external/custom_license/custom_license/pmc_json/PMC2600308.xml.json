We recently described the application of a multiplex PCR method for microbial surveillance wherein primers are attached to tags of varying mass that serve as digital signatures for their genetic targets. Tags are cleaved from primers and recorded by mass spectroscopy, enabling a sensitive, inexpensive, and highly multiplexed microbial detection. We used the multiplex MassTag PCR system (10) to investigate respiratory samples that had tested negative during routine diagnostic assessment. This previous study yielded pathogen candidates in approximately one third of cases, and in 8 cases identified a novel genetic clade of picornaviruses divergent from the previously characterized clades, including HRV-A and-B (8). To assess whether this novel clade circulates outside New York state, where it was discovered in cases of influenzalike illness (ILI), we investigated respiratory specimens from Africa, Asia, Australia, and Europe. In most studies (Africa, Asia), the collecting laboratories performed MassTag PCR, and inert mass-tagged amplification products were sent for analysis by mass spectrometry (MS); in other instances (Europe, Australia), inactivated nasopharyngeal swabs or aspirates were sent to New York for MassTag PCR and MS analysis.",

MassTag PCR was applied to 58 specimens collected during the 2006 season from symptomatic children in their first year of life with no diagnosis available from previous clinical laboratory evaluation. Analysis of amplification products by MS yielded positive signal for HEV/HRV in 14 (24%) samples. Independent amplification and sequence analysis of VP4/2 coding sequence (8) in both laboratories showed sequences that matched the novel genotype in 4 (29%) samples obtained from patients with LRTIs and respiratory distress (Table 1, Figure). Samples collected in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, West Africa, were from symptomatic persons living in the vicinity of Ta\u03ca National Park. This location was the most remote of our study; residents have limited contact with other human populations. In this location, 2 (10%) HRV-A were identified in the 52 samples available for analysis (Table 1, Figure).",

Independent molecular typing in both laboratories indicated the novel genotype in 3 (6%) samples (Table 1, Figure).",

Rates of evolutionary change and the Time to the Most Recent Common Ancestor (TMRCA) of the novel clade were estimated by using the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach (BEAST package [14]; ), applying a relaxed molecular clock with an uncorrelated lognormal distribution of rates, a GTR + I + \u03934 model of nucleotide substitution (determined by MODELTEST [15]), and exponential population growth. Statistical uncertainty in each parameter estimate is expressed as 95% highest probability density (HPD) values. The estimated mean rate of evolutionary change was 6.6 \u00d7 10\u20134 substitutions/site/y (95% HPD = 0.3\u201314.6 \u00d7 10\u20134 substitutions/site/y; 38 dated samples collected over 32 mo (8,16) (S.R. Dominguez et al., unpub. data). Under this rate the mean TMRCA was estimated at 1,800 y, although with wide variance caused by the short sequence available (95% HPD = 279\u20135,201 y). Despite the inherent sampling error, this analysis suggests that this third clade of rhinovirus has been circulating for >250 years. The diversity observed within the novel clade and its genetic distance from other HRV/HEV were comparable to those seen for HRV-A, -B, or the HEV species (Table 2).",
