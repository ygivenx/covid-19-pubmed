These densely attached N-glycans shield the viral surface proteins to escape from neutralizing antibody recognition (Wei et al. 2003; Bonomelli et al. 2011). On the other hand, carbohydrate-binding agents that target those glycans on the viral envelope exhibit potent anti-viral activities via interfering the interaction between gp120 and CD4 (Hansen et al. 1989; Balzarini et al. 1991; Charan et al. 2000; Dey et al. 2000; Swanson et al. 2010).",

(Mori et al. 2005) and BCA from a green alga Boodlea coacta (Sato et al. 2011b). These lectins show strong anti-HIV activities through their binding to mannoside structures on gp120. However, high-mannose recognition mode subtly differed among them, as well as the primary structures were clearly distinct (Sato et al. 2011b; Koharudin and Gronenborn 2014). High-mannose N-glycan structures are also present on the surfaces of the other enveloped viruses such as influenza virus, hepatitis C virus (HCV), human herpes virus (HHV), West Nile virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Ebola virus (Okuno et al. 1992; Vigerust and Shepherd 2007). This suggests that high-mannose-binding lectins could also inactivate the entries of those viruses into host cells (Barrientos et al. 2003; Helle et al. 2006; O\u2019Keefe et al. 2003, 2010).",

            "text": "A lectin ESA-2 from a red alga Eucheuma serra (Kawakubo et al. 1997) was recently found to possess the unique binding specificity with the preferential affinity for high-mannose N-glycans bearing the nonreducing terminal \u03b11-3 Man in D2 arm (Hori et al. 2007). Since then, several lectins with similar binding specificity were isolated from some lower organisms, including red algae (Kawakubo et al. 1999; Sato et al. 2011a; Hung et al. 2011, 2015), a cyanobacterium (Sato et al. 2000, 2007), and bacteria (Cumsky and Zusman 1979; Sato et al. 2012; Koharudin et al. 2012; Whitley et al. 2013). Interestingly, these lectins commonly had tandem-repeated structures of a similar domain composed of about 67 amino acids, and grouped into two types of four and two repeats (Hori et al. 2007; Sato et al. 2007; Sato and Hori 2009) as exemplified with ESA-2 (four repeats) and a lectin OAA (two repeats) from a freshwater cyanobacterium Oscillatoria agardhii. Thus, we demonstrated the occurrence of a new lectin family which is widely distributed in lower organisms, indicating that ESA-2 and OAA are orthologous to each other. Among them, OAA has been characterized in details. The structural analyses of OAA and its complexes with oligomannosides revealed that this lectin recognized a core unit, Man\u03b11-6(Man\u03b11-3)Man\u03b11-6(Man\u03b11-3)Man\u03b2- of the branched mannoside in high-mannose N-glycan (Koharudin et al. 2011; Koharudin and Gronenborn 2011, 2014). This recognition mode of OAA was novel as the other high-mannose-binding lectins mostly recognized the nonreducing end mannoses. Potent anti-HIV activities of this lectin family, including ESA-2, OAA, Pseudomonas fluorescens agglutinin (PFA), Myxococcus xanthus agglutinin (myxobacterial hemagglutinin, MBHA) (Koharudin et al. 2012), and Burkholderia oklahomensis agglutinin (BOA) (Whitley et al. 2013) were represented as expected by their specific binding nature to high-mannose sugar moiety. Strong anti-influenza virus activities through binding to the envelope hemagglutinin protein were also shown in PFL (identical to PFA) (Sato et al. 2012) and KAA-2 isolated from a cultivated red alga Kappaphycus alvarezii (Sato et al. 2011a).",

K. alvarezii cultivation was originally started in the Philippines in latter half of the 1960s using the local varieties selected from the wild (Doty 1973; Parker 1974; Bindu and Levine 2011). After four decades, the Kappaphycus became the most widely cultivated commercial eucheumoid (Bindu and Levine 2011) and has globally been introduced for cultivation and some experimental purposes in tropical and subtropical area, including Asia, Africa, the Pacific Island, and American countries (Ask et al. 2003; Bindu and Levine 2011). We recently reported that KAA-2 isolated from the cultivated sample of K. alvarezii preferentially recognized high-mannose-type oligosaccharides bearing an exposed \u03b11-3 Man at the nonreducing end in D2 arm and inhibited infection of various influenza virus strains with EC50s of low nanomolar levels through direct binding to the viral envelope hemagglutinin protein, which has several high-mannose N-glycans (Sato et al. 2011a). The results also suggest that KAA-2 may belong to a new lectin family mentioned above. However, the primary structure of KAA is unknown yet as well as its anti-HIV activity. In this study, we elucidated the primary structure of KAA-2 using peptide mapping and complementary DNA (cDNA) cloning and prepared its active recombinants using an Escherichia coli expression system. The native and recombinant lectins were examined for sugar-binding specificity and anti-HIV activity, including binding nature to gp120.",

After fracturing the cell by sonication, the His-tagged rKAA-1 (His-rKAA-1) expressed into soluble fraction was purified by His GraviTrap (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruction. After purification, His-rKAA-1 was dialyzed thoroughly against ultrapure water to remove imidazole which was contained in the elution buffer. Twenty-five milligrams of His-rKAA-1 was then applied to thrombin treatment using a Thrombin Cleavage Capture Kit (Merck) to disconnect the tag peptide from the recombinant according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruction. After removal of thrombin by the above kit, the digested fraction was applied to His GraviTrap to exclude the cleaved His-tag peptide and undigested His-rKAA-1. Generated rKAA-1 was then dialyzed thoroughly against ultrapure water.",

The molecular masses of PE-KAA-2 and PE-ESA-2 were determined to be 28,124.0 and 28,052.0 by ESI-MS. These values were consistent with those estimated by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2c). Peptide fragments generated by trypsin digestion of PE-KAA-2 and PE-ESA-2 were separated into a total of 26 peaks, including 18 common peaks between both, 5 specific peaks in PE-KAA-2, and 3 specific peaks in PE-ESA-2, by RP-HPLC on TSKgel ODS 120T (Fig. 3, Table 1). The molecular masses of the isolated peptide fragments were determined by ESI-MS, except for a peak 22 in PE-KAA-2 and peaks 10 and 21 in PE-ESA-2. The determined masses were compared to those of the peptide fragments that are theoretically generated by trypsin digestion of PE-ESA-2 (Table 1). All peptides whose masses were successfully determined were found in the PE-ESA-2 sequence, except for a peak 19, mass of which was not found in both sequences of PE-ESA-2 and trypsin used for digestion. The sequence of 167 amino acids (aa) of PE-KAA-2 was successfully predicted by comparing the sequences of 18 peptides with the same masses, which were commonly generated from both PE-KAA-2 and PE-ESA-2. Moreover, the N-terminal sequencing of the specific peptide peaks (11, 12, 15, 16, and 23) from PE-KAA-2 showed that there are at least 3 amino acid substitution for PE-ESA-2 (Fig. 4). The peptide sequence of a peak 10 (determined MW 2550.8) in PE-KAA-2 could be an incompletely digested product of 197GKLSGANNYSVENQWGGSSAPWNK220 (calculated MW 2551.7). Thus, a total of 230 aa in the whole sequence of PE-KAA-2 was successfully predicted by peptide mapping.\n\n\n\n",

Compared the deduced amino acid sequences of the two isoforms and the partial sequence of KAA-2 predicted by peptide mapping, it was found that there are substitutions of a few amino acids to one another, further indicating that KAA-2 isolated from the cultivated alga was not encoded by the two cloned cDNAs. This may be attributed to the difference of algal samples used for lectin isolation and cDNA cloning. Here, we defined the isolectin cDNA whose deduced amino acid sequence was closer to the predicted KAA-2 by peptide mapping as KAA-2 (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank accession no. LC007081) and the other as KAA-1 (LC007080) (Fig. 5). KAA-1 cDNA was composed of 1027 bp containing 77 bp of 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR), 143 bp of 3\u2032UTR, and 807 bp of open reading frame (ORF) which encoded 268 amino acids including an initiating methionine. KAA-2 cDNA was composed of 1161 bp containing 94 bp of 5\u2032UTR, 257 bp of 3\u2032UTR, and 810 bp of ORF encoding 269 amino acids including an initiating methionine (LC007081). The predicted N-terminal amino acid sequence of the mature KAAs was completely comparable in the sequence determined by Edman degradation for PE-KAA-2 (underlined sequence in Fig. 5a), indicating that KAA cDNAs do not encode signal peptide and other propeptide regions. These two KAAs showed 89.7 and 98.5 % identities to each other in nucleotide and protein levels, respectively. Amino acid sequence identities between ESA-2 and KAA-1 or KAA-2 are 98.1 and 98.9 %, respectively. KAAs also contain four tandem repeats of around 67 amino acids (Fig. 6) as well as ESA-2 (Hori et al. 2007). These repeated sequences are highly conserved between one another and among related proteins from other organisms including bacteria (Burkholderia oklahomensis agglutinin (BOA, 4 repeats), Myxococcus xanthus agglutinin (MBHA, 4 repeats), Pseudomonas fluorescens lectin (PFL, 2 repeats)) and cyanobacteria (O. agardhii (OAA, 2 repeats)) (Fig. 6). Similar sequence was not found in higher plants or animals by BLAST search. The sequence identities between KAA-1 and BOA, MBHA, OAA, or PFL were 58.1, 60.2, 60.6, and 62.9 %, respectively. The amino acids that interact with mannopentaose (Man\u03b11-6(Man\u03b11-3)Man\u03b11-6(Man\u03b11-3)Man), which is a branched oligomannosyl core structure of M8/9, in BOA (Koharudin et al. 2012) are absolutely conserved in all repeated domains of the lectins (indicated with asterisks in Fig. 6).\n\n",

(1999) reported that the N-terminal amino acid sequences of KAAs were identical to those of ESAs, the whole primary structure of KAA-2 was considered to have high similarity with that of ESA-2. Peptide mapping of KAA-2 using the sequence of ESA-2 as a template has elucidated 85 % (230/268 aa) of the full-length sequence. A calculated molecular mass of the predicted sequence by peptide mapping, including the corresponding sequences of ESA-2, was 28,022, which gave close agreement with that of PE-KAA-2 (28,124 including an S-pyridylethyl group (105 Da) (Fig. 2a)). Although cDNA cloning by RACE method elucidated the full length cDNAs encoding KAAs, both of their deduced amino acid sequences were not identical to that of the native KAA-2 predicted by peptide mapping (Fig. 5b). The calculated molecular mass from their sequences were 27,881.24 and 28,007.41, respectively, and were also inconsistent with that of native KAA-2. We defined one of the two KAA cDNAs as KAA-2, whose amino acid sequence was more similar to native KAA-2 and ESA-2, and the other as KAA-1. The slight sequence differences between native KAA-2 and deduced KAA-2 might be individual variability in algal samples used. cDNA cloning has also elucidated that the transcripts of KAAs do not contain the region encoding a signal peptide sequence (Fig. 5), which target the proteins from the cytosol to the cytoplasmic membrane (prokaryotes) or to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (eukaryotes) (Imai and Nakai 2010), as well as that of OAA from a cyanobacterium does not (Sato and Hori 2009). It has reported that cDNAs encoding a lectin from Euonymus europaeus (EEA) and EUL protein from Arabidopsis thaliana (ArathEULS3) do not encode a signal peptide and these translated product located in the nucleus and cytoplasm (Van Hove et al. 2011) as well as a GNA ortholog from rice that lacks the signal peptide and propeptide sequence (Fouquaert et al. 2007). In addition, there are not any known cellular localization signals in the primary structure of KAAs (data not shown). It suggests that KAAs are also synthesized on free ribosomes and located in nucleocytoplasm. There is only a report as to the cellular localization of KAA orthologs; Nelson et al. (1981) reported that MBHA, a KAA ortholog from a myxobacterium, localizes at the specific sites on the surface of developmental cells but not vegetated cells and suggested their function in cellular interactions during aggregation. Detailed cellular localization of KAA should be elucidated and will help to predict their functions in the algal bodies.",

A lectin PFL from Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf0-1 belonging to this lectin family also tends to preferentially recognize high-mannose glycans with \u03b11-3 Man exposed in the D2 arm but not to other sugar types including complex N-glycans and O-glycans, as revealed by screening with a glycan array having 611 glycan targets (Sato et al. 2012). Three-dimentional structure analyses for glycan-bound OAA (Koharudin et al. 2011; Koharudin and Gronenborn 2011), PFA (identical to PFL), MBHA (Koharudin et al. 2012) and BOA (Whitley et al. 2013) supported their strict binding specificities; the amino acid residues which were revealed to interact with branched mannoside in the high-mannose glycans by tertiary-structural analyses were absolutely conserved in all the lectins of this family as mentioned above (Fig. 6). In previous (Sato et al. 2011a) and present studies, native KAA-2 and rKAAs bound to high-mannose-type oligosaccharides but not or little to oligomannoses including PA-mannopentaose (Man\u03b11-6(Man\u03b11-3)Man\u03b11-6(Man\u03b11-3)Man-PA) (oligosaccharide 22 in Fig. 8), suggesting a possibility that the reducing terminal disaccharide GlcNAc-GlcNAc is necessary for KAAs to bind to high-mannose N-glycans. On the other hand, Koharudin and Gronenborn (2011) showed that OAA binds to this type of mannopentaose (not pyridylaminated), by NMR binding studies, and suggested that the reducing terminal disaccharide was not essential for OAA to bind to those glycans. Exactly, PA-oligosaccharides used in this study possessed the reducing terminal residues with ring-opening structures by pyridylamination, including free oligomannoses (PA-oligosaccharides 18\u201322 in Fig. 8). Thus, it might be attributable to such ring-opening of the reducing terminal residues that KAAs did not bind to the PA-oligomannoses, including mannopentaose (Man\u03b11-6(Man\u03b11-3)Man\u03b11-6(Man\u03b11-3)Man-PA) (oligosaccharide 22 in Figs. 8 and 9). Although we have not elucidated the structure of a KAA-mannopentaose complex, it is strongly predicted that KAA, as well as OAA (Koharudin et al. 2011), requires the reducing terminal mannose having the ring structure for binding to mannopentaose, unlike that CV-N and GRFT do not directly interact with the reducing terminal mannose (Ziolkowska et al. 2006; Ziolkowska and Wlodawer 2006).",

            "text": "SPR analyses revealed that rKAAs bound to HIV envelope glycoprotein gp120 with high association constants (1.48\u20131.61 \u00d7 109 M\u22121) as well as native KAAs did (Fig. 10). gp120 is extensively glycosylated with N-linked complex and high-mannose carbohydrates accounting for about half of its molecular weight (Geyer et al. 1988), suggesting that KAAs can bind gp120 with a high affinity for the high-mannose sugars. Supposed from their strong binding to the gp120, KAAs represented potent anti-HIV activities at IC50 of nanomolar levels (7.3\u201312.9 nM, Table 4) in virus neutralization assay with Jurkat cells. The activities were comparable to those of OAA (12 nM of IC50 against HIV-1 (R9) in TZM-b1 cells (Koharudin et al. 2012), 45 nM of EC50 against HIV-1 X4 in MT-4 cells (Sato et al. 2007)), MBHA (15 nM of IC50 against HIV-1 (R9) in TZM-b1 cells (Koharudin et al. 2012)), BOA (12.2 nM of IC50 against HIV-1 (R9) in TZM-b1 cells (Whitley et al. 2013)) and ESA-2 (165 nM of EC50 against HIV-1 X4 in MT-4 cells (Sato et al. 2007)). There are a lot of HIV-1 strains, being suggested that there may be distinct sugar structures on their envelope gp120 (Zhang et al. 2004). The difference of anti-HIV activities, such as the activities of OAA against HIV-1 (R9) in TZM-b1 and HIV-1 X4 in MT-4 cells, may be caused by the difference of virus strains and cells (Huskens and Schols 2012) used in the experiments. The anti-HIV activities of CV-N and GRFT were reported as 0.4 nM (against HIV-1 (R9) in TZM-b1 cells) and 0.04 nM (against HIV-1 X4 in MT-4 cells) of IC50 (or EC50), respectively (Koharudin et al. 2012; Mori et al. 2005). The interaction between GRFT and HIV-1 gp120 IIIB (X4) was also elucidated by Xue et al. (2013) via a SPR analysis using a BIAcore T200; the dissociation constant of GRFT with the gp120 is 6.93 \u00d7 10\u221211 M, which is 10-fold lower than those of KAAs (6.22\u20136.77 \u00d7 10\u221210 M) (Fig. 10). These relatively strong anti-HIV-1 activities of CV-N and GRFT and the robust interaction of GRFT with gp120 come from the multivalency of binding sites on the lectins and that of epitopes on the high-mannose oligosaccharides (Koharudin and Gronenborn 2014). Although the anti-viral activities of KAAs are lower than those of CV-N and GRFT, the oligomannose epitopes recognized by KAAs are different from those recognized by CV-N and GRFT. Since high mutation rate in HIV-1 can rapidly produce the resistant viruses against these anti-viral lectins (Witvrouw et al. 2005; Huang et al. 2011), multilateral and synergistic use of the anti-viral lectins whose recognition epitopes in oligosaccharides are different from one another can be effective as F\u00e9rir et al. (2014) represented.",

            "text": "We searched higher plant lectins similar to KAAs by in silico screening for genome sequences of soybean Glycine max, rice Oryza sativa, and Arabidopsis; however, higher plant genomes encode no lectins similar to this lectin family (data not shown) as Jiang et al. (2010) reported a genome wide screening of higher plant lectins. This lectin family is found to date only in lower organisms including eukaryotes of red algae and prokaryotes of cyanobacteria and bacteria. The biofunctional mechanism(s) where this lectin family preferentially binds to high-mannose carbohydrates having an exposed \u03b11-3 Man in the D2 arm of branched oligomannoside is still uncovered. As Yoshiie et al. (2012) reported that the N-glycans of glycoproteins in red algae are predominantly high-mannose types, the internal ligands of KAAs could exist in the cells, implied from the predicted nucleocytoplasmic localization of the lectins as described before. However, the lectins peculiar to these lower organisms may have common function(s), such as host defense against infections of invasive viruses, bacteria, or fungi to these organisms as well as several cytoplasmic/nuclear plant lectins, including amaranthins, Euonymus lectin-like (EUL)-related lectins, jacalin-related lectins, and nictaba-related lectins, have an important role in plant defense against pathogens (Lannoo and Van Damme 2010, 2014; Dias Rde et al. 2015; De Schutter and Van Damme 2015).",

These results suggested that KAAs have potentiality to represent broad anti-viral activities against viruses possessing high-mannose glycans on their envelope such as HCV, HHV, SARS-CoV, and Ebola virus, as well as native KAA-2 did against influenza viruses (Sato et al. 2011a). It is important that anti-viral lectins are isolated from a globally cultivated edible algal species in contrast that any other homologous anti-HIV lectins are derived from bacteria (BOA, PFL, MBHA), a cyanobacterium (OAA), and an uncultivated alga (ESA-2); KAAs can be purified in a relatively high yield of 270 mg per 100 g of freeze-dried alga (Kawakubo et al. 1999). These functional lectins will become a strong tool by being supplied in bulk as both native and recombinant forms, which are almost identical in their carbohydrate specificities and anti-viral activities.",
