All paid subscribers to the journal who are also SPR members may access the article and corresponding test on-line.Completion of each test with a score of at least 80% results in the awarding of 1 AMA PRA Category 1 Credit\u2122. Participants will have the opportunity to take each test up to three times, if the first attempt does not result in a passing score. Participants will be provided feedback through e-mail notification to assist in further study prior to taking the test again. If you do not receive an e-mail notice, please contact adavis@acr.org for assistance.Upon completion of this test on-line, you will be required to respond to a short survey required by our CME provider in order to assist us in determining if these activities are meeting your needs. Once you respond to the survey, a CME certificate will be available.Documentation of credits earned for CME tests will be available on the CME Gateway at www.CMEGateway.org/. Results are not posted immediately. It may take up to 60 days for your credits to be reflected, so be sure to retain your e-mails or the certificate provided via the online system as confirmation of your credit.CME certificates will not be mailed.Only examinations completed on-line will be valid for CME credit. Please do not mail or FAX in responses to the questions following the CME article.\n",
