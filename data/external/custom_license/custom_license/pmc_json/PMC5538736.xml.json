Particles corresponding to class averages of the molecular complexes were selected for further processing in Relion version 2.038. Initially, full-size molecular projection images were refined against a simulated density map of an unliganded BG505 SOSIP Env trimer (simulated from the Env part of PDB ID 5CEZ) low-pass filtered at 60 \u00c5. Initial refinement was followed by 3D classification and stable symmetrical classes were selected for further symmetrized (C3) refinement. Resolutions were calculated using soft-edged masks that encompassed the entire structure (including all noisier regions) and are reported according to the FSC 0.143 gold-standard criterion.

The raw particle stack was extracted using a box size of 256 pixels, and was immediately binned by 2 in reciprocal space, to a pixel size of 2.62 \u00c5/pix and a box size 128 pixels. Initial 2D classification in Relion indicated a mixture of particle populations from sub-stoichiometric binding of sCD4 and 17b. Particles contributing to classes that did not produce clear structural features were discarded, leaving 98,845 particles. Next, to separate the different particle populations, this stack was subjected to competitive sorting using 3 initial models \u2013 trimer alone, trimer + sCD4, trimer + sCD4 + 17b Fab \u2013 in an identical manner as previously described39. This resulted in three separate stacks containing 69,105 particles (trimer alone), 6,342 particles (trimer + sCD4), and 23,398 particles (trimer + sCD4 + 17b). Each of these individual stacks was then subjected to 4-model classification in Relion, using 60 \u00c5 as the initial low-pass filter value38, followed by parameter conversion and final classification in Frealign40. For each subgroup, the number of classes in Frealign was varied from 2 to 4, and a final value was selected such that the classification would produce at least 2 nearly identical models, as described earlier41,42. Within the stack comprising the trimer alone or the trimer + sCD4, this procedure resulted in removal of bad particles that did not produce interpretable maps (Figure S5C); within the stack comprising the trimer + sCD4 + 17b, this resulted in 1 low resolution class that was discarded, as well as 3 classes that differed in the relative configuration of the 17b Fab, but that were otherwise very similar. Final resolutions (FSC 0.143) are ~10.5 \u00c5 (BG505CD4), and ~8.6 \u00c5 (BG505CD4/17b).",

Coordinates for sCD4, 17b, b12, and PGV04 were obtained from PDB IDs 1GC1, 1RZ8, 2NY7, and 3J5M, respectively. Individual chains were fit into the respective cryoEM maps using UCSF Chimera45 and refined using a combination of Rosetta density-guided iterative local refinement46, RosettaRelax47, and manual building in COOT48. Glycans were built using an idealized Man9 model that was placed into corresponding glycan density in UCSF Chimera. Torsion angles were adjusted in UCSF Chimera until good agreement was achieved between map and model. Sugar molecules with disordered or no density were removed. The final models were further refined using Phenix49 real space refinement without NCS constraints. Glycans were validated by pdb-care50 and CARP51 and structures were evaluated using EMRinger52 and Molprobity53. Figures were generated in UCSF Chimera or Pymol54. Buried surface area calculations were performed using PDBePISA55 and R.M.S.D. analysis was performed in UCSF Chimera. Map fitting cross correlations were calculated using the Fit In Map feature in UCSF Chimera.",
