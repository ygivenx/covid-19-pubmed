H9N2 AI viruses had become widespread in domestic chickens in Asia since 1990. In addition, both of these AI subtypes were isolated from ducks and geese in the region, suggesting a wide distribution in avian hosts. Data from phylogenetic studies led to the hypothesis that the H5N1 Hong Kong viruses acquired their HA gene from an A/goose/Guangdong/1/96-like (H5N1) virus and the gene encoding NA from an A/teal/Hong Kong/W312/97 (H6N1)-like virus circulating in terrestrial poultry. Data also suggested that H9N2 or H6N1 AI viruses circulating in the region were the likely source of the internal protein genes (17\u201320). H9N2 viruses continue to circulate in birds in southern China.",

The vaccine seed viruses to be generated are based on the live attenuated cold-adapted influenza virus vaccines developed by Maassab and colleagues at the University of Michigan in the 1960s (28) and used as the basis for the FluMist vaccine (MedImmune, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD, USA) now licensed in the United States for persons 5\u201349 years of age for preventing interpandemic influenza. The principles of the development of such vaccines and safety and efficacy studies conducted in humans are reviewed elsewhere (29,30). The vaccine seed virus development strategy is not exclusive to live, attenuated vaccines, and similar studies with inactivated vaccines against different AI subtypes should be initiated.",

This technique allows infectious virus to be recovered from cells approved for use in human vaccine development (so-called qualified cells). These cells are cotransfected with plasmids encoding each of the 8 influenza gene segments to generate recombinant viruses that contain the HA and NA genes from AI viruses and 6 internal gene segments from the AA ca virus (31). Reverse genetics will allow modification of known virulence motifs in the HA or NA genes, such as the removal of the multibasic amino acid cleavage site motif in the HA gene of highly pathogenic AI strains that is associated with virulence in birds (32). The other advantage of reverse genetics is that a selection system is not needed to derive appropriate reassortant viruses from a background of parental viruses. In addition, the plasmids encoding the genes from the attenuated vaccine donor strain are available, and only the HA and NA genes need to be cloned for each vaccine. Several H5N1 vaccine candidates have been developed by using this technique (33\u201336). Some potential obstacles to applying the reverse genetics approach include the need for qualified cells for virus production and intellectual property for this technique. However, as long as the HA and NA gene segments do not have to be modified, the 6-2 gene reassortant investigational pandemic vaccines can be generated by genetic reassortment, as shown in the Figure, panel B. A candidate H9N2 pandemic vaccine was generated by using this technique (37).",

Therefore, before the next pandemic, we must evaluate in humans the safety, infectivity, immunogenicity, and phenotypic stability of live, attenuated influenza A candidate vaccines. The types of in vitro and in vivo studies that will be performed before clinical trials in humans are initiated, in addition to standard safety tests, are listed in Table 4. In vitro studies will be performed to confirm the genome sequence of the vaccine viruses. The cold-adapted and temperature-sensitive phenotype of the vaccine viruses will be confirmed in vitro in tissue culture. The attenuation phenotype of the vaccine candidates must be tested in an appropriate animal model. A critical step in evaluating vaccine candidates is selecting a model in which restriction of replication of the vaccine virus can be convincingly demonstrated in comparison to the wild-type parent virus. Since we cannot predict how AI viruses of different subtypes will behave in different animal species, animal models for each virus subtype will be developed. The use of rodent models (e.g., mice and hamsters) will be explored. The use of a ferret model will be investigated as well, although limited availability of influenza-seronegative ferrets and facilities in which highly pathogenic wild-type AI viruses can be evaluated in ferrets makes such studies logistically and practically difficult for assessing large numbers of candidate vaccines. In addition, the higher body temperature of the ferret may confound interpretation of studies in which replication of temperature-sensitive viruses is being assessed. The vaccine viruses may also require evaluation in the standard Office International des \u00c9pizooties (World Organization for Animal Health) intravenous pathogenicity test in chickens to confirm that they are not highly pathogenic in chickens and, as such, do not pose a threat to the poultry industry. Such a requirement will be guided by national agricultural authorities. Immunogenicity, dose response, antibody response kinetics, and efficacy studies will also be carried out in appropriate animal models before clinical trials.",

The contribution of cellular immune responses to the control of AI virus infection remains to be determined and can be examined in the context of live, attenuated vaccines.

Six plasmids encoding the internal genes of the attenuated donor virus are mixed with 2 plasmids encoding the circulating avian virus hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes (which may or may not have been modified to remove virulence motifs). Qualified cells are transfected with the plasmids, and the attenuated reassortant virus is isolated. B). Generation of live, attenuated pandemic influenza vaccine viruses with the 6 internal genes from the attenuated donor virus bearing attenuating mutations (*) and the HA and NA genes from the circulating avian virus by classic reassortment. The 6-2 reassortants generated by this method are selected in the presence of antiserum specific for HA and NA of the attenuated donor virus.",
