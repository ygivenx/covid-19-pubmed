In mean-field epidemiological models, the concept of the basic reproductive number, Ro, has been systematically employed as a predictor for epidemic spread and as an analytical tool to study the threshold conditions [1\u20134]. An advantage of Ro is that in many models it determines both the threshold for the emergence of an epidemic and the expected final outcome of an outbreak [5,6]. It has thus been widely used to gauge the degree of threat that a specific infectious agent will pose as an outbreak progresses [7,8].",

However, recent results have shown that these estimates are much larger than the true extent of the disease outcome [24]. This overestimate of late dynamics when using early dynamics has been raised by many authors in general cases, as well as specifically for the Ebola virus [25,26]. We build upon these known observations to show that even in fully mixed models, the early dynamics cannot be used to estimate the outcome of the late dynamics, and we propose an alternative approach.",

            "text": "The models used in this study are based on the SIS and SIR models. Each susceptible individual has a different probability to get infected, but all infected individuals have the same probability to infect other susceptible individuals. Specifically, individuals exist in two discrete states\u2014\u201chealthy\u201d or \u201cinfected\u201d\u2014in the SIS model, and three discrete states\u2014\u201chealthy,\u201d \u201cinfected,\u201d or \u201crecovered\u201d\u2014in the SIR model. At each time step, each susceptible (healthy) individual i is infected with rate \u03b2i. At the same time, infected individuals are cured and become susceptible again with rate \u03b3 in the SIS model, or recovered in the SIR model. The value of \u03b2i is only a function of the person getting infected and not the person infecting, and it does not vary over time for a given individual. Given a variable probability to get infected in the population, we define the number of susceptible individuals with a \u03b2i value between \u03b2 and \u03b2+d\u03b2 as S(\u03b2)d\u03b2 and the number of infected individuals as I(\u03b2)d\u03b2. We further define N(\u03b2) as N(\u03b2)=S(\u03b2)+I(\u03b2). Note that N(\u03b2) does not change over time and is thus equal to its initial condition. We have studied multiple distributions for this initial condition, as shall be further explained. S is the sum over all the susceptible individuals with different probability to get infected, I is the sum over all the infected individuals with different probability to get infected, and N is the sum over all the susceptible individuals and infected individuals with different probability to get infected. Formally,\n(1)I=\u222b0\u221eI(\u03b2)d\u03b2,\n(2)S=\u222b0\u221eS(\u03b2)d\u03b2,\n(3)N=\u222b0\u221eN(\u03b2)d\u03b2,\u03b2 is the disease transmission rate (i.e., the probability that a person would be infected), and \u03b3 is the disease recovery rate. Note that here we use an integral approximation of the discrete sum. We will further show that this approximation is consistent with numerical simulations. The equations for the SIS model used here are\n(4)dS(\u03b2)dt=\u2212\u03b2IS(\u03b2)+\u03b3I(\u03b2),dI(\u03b2)dt=\u03b2IS(\u03b2)\u2212\u03b3I(\u03b2),and N=I+S.",

The conclusion from the results above are that in order to estimate the future dynamics, it is not enough to know R0, but the change in EI(\u03b2) should be estimated. While this cannot be estimated directly, we can directly quantify the effect this has on S*ES(\u03b2) through the disease dynamics. Specifically, a decrease in ES(\u03b2) is expected to lead to a parallel decrease in \u0394I/I. In the bottom graph of Fig. 3, we calculated the difference in the number of infected individuals in every time step, divided by the total number of infected individuals in the same time. The total decrease in the expected value of \u03b2 in the S compartment and the increase in the expected value of \u03b2 in the I compartments are clear in the SF distribution, while it is more limited in all other distributions. This can be clearly seen in the measures of ES(\u03b2), in EI(\u03b2), and in \u0394I/I. The mechanism driving the difference is straightforward. In normal or uniform distribution the variance in \u03b2 is limited, thus even infecting the most susceptible individuals does not significantly affect the values of EI(\u03b2) and ES(\u03b2).

A similar analysis can be performed for the SIR model with similar results (Fig. 4). The results obtained in both models in simulations and in Eq. (30) are equivalent (Fig. 4). For the uniform, constant, and normal distribution, where the higher moments of \u03b2 are of limited importance, the results of a first-order approximation of Eq.

There are now known cases of reexposure to Ebola. We thus fit the SIR and not the SIS model. For example, the free parameters are as follows: for the SF distribution N is number of the population, \u03b1,\u03b2min,\u03b2max,I0,\u03b3; for the Gaussian distribution, N,\u03bc,\u03c3,\u03b3,I0; for the uniform distribution, N,\u03b2min,\u03b2max,\u03b3,I0; and for the constant model, N,\u03b2,\u03b3,I0. Using the observed I0 leads to suboptimal results for all models. This is probably the case since in the early dynamics, stochastic fluctuations can affect the results. We thus estimate I0 from the dynamics later when enough cases are available.",

We found that in realistic cases, nonuniform models provide a better description of the observed epidemics than the model where there is a constant transmission coefficient for the entire population. In the early dynamics, only the first moment of \u03b2 determines the dynamics, and there is no difference between the models as long as they have the same transmission rate. Later, the second moment of \u03b2 starts affecting the dynamics for both the SIR and SIS models. During this period, the scale-free distribution behaves differently from other distributions and results in a lower number of infected individuals than expected. This reduction is the result of a difference between the first moment of \u03b2 in the different compartments (S, I). There is a sharp increase in the average value of \u03b2 among infected compartments, accompanied by a smaller decrease in the susceptible compartment, compared with the initial value. Such an effect can only be observed in distributions where the second moment of \u03b2 in the total population is large enough. The difference is then further enlarged in steady state where all distributions of the transmission coefficient in the population lead to a smaller number of infected individuals compared with the model with constant \u03b2, but the biggest difference is in the SF model, again explained by the high second moment of \u03b2 in this distribution. We have then tested this conclusion by studying the spread of the Ebola virus in multiple African countries. An F test between the different distributions shows that they all produce a better fit than the constant \u03b2 model. We attempted to detect early in the infection whether the total number of people affected by the epidemics will deviate significantly from the results expected from the early dynamics.",

The most classical example is perhaps the huge difference between the predictions and the observed amplitude of the JCD [9\u201316]. Many models can explain this discrepancy, including, among others, nonlinear dynamics [59,60], delays [61,62], human intervention, passive vaccination [63,64], and small effective population [65\u201367]. We show here that even in the most standard SIR and SIS models, the initial dynamics cannot determine the total number of people affected by the epidemics. However, quite early in the dynamics, the relative infection rate \u0394I/I can be used to detect significant deviations from the straightforward dynamics expected from these models. The large difference is only expected if the distribution of \u03b2 values is large. Such a large difference can be the result of intrinsic differences, but also the result of environmental differences, partial mixing, or subpopulation structure. Understanding this distribution in advance would improve our capacity to relate early and late dynamics. We now plan to develop methods to estimate this distribution from finer measures early in the disease dynamics.",
