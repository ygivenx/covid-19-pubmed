As a result of these and other improvements, prevention and treatment of infectious disease (eg, those caused by biological agents) and non-infectious disease (eg, those caused by chemical or physical agents) has improved significantly around the world. However, substantial challenges remain, particularly in developing countries with limited health resources relative to more developed countries. Examples include recent (summer, fall, 2014) concerns for the Ebola virus and non-polio enterovirus D68 (EV-D68). There are also previous and ongoing concerns for diseases such as sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS); H1N1 influenza; other swine and avian influenza (swine, bird flu); and a variety of other viral, bacterial, and protozoal diseases.",

            "text": "As an example, Ebola hemorrhagic fever has been in the news during summer and fall 2014 because of the outbreaks and related infections of health-care providers in Africa. Ebola transmission is accomplished via direct or indirect exposure to blood or other bodily fluids, and is therefore relatively easily controlled by the use of personal protective equipment such as gloves, masks, safety glasses, and Tyvek\u2122 suits (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]).1 Therefore, the risks of an Ebola pandemic would appear to be low. However, there are concerns that Ebola could become an epidemic and/or endemic disease in Africa. A September, 2014 CDC Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report Supplement predicted that there could be as many as 1.4 million cases in Liberia and Sierra Leone by January, 2015 (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/su6303a1.htm?s_cid = su6303a1_w).2 It should be noted, however, that the authors outlined significant limitations to this prediction. There has also been public concern expressed about bringing infected health-care workers to the US because of the perceived potential for an outbreak of Ebola. Identifi-cation and treatment of specific Ebola symptoms and use of an experimental monoclonal antibody treatment (ZMapp\u2122, developed by Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc.) to manage the disease process appear promising. There is also an Ebola vaccine that began US National Institutes of Health (NIH) human testing in October, 2014.3",

SARS, transmitted by an airborne coronavirus, was a major concern in 2003, but fortunately, no cases have been reported worldwide since 2004.4 The US Public Health Emergency of 2009 for H1N1 influenza strain expired in June, 2010, and the World Health Organization (WHO) announced in 2010 that H1N1 had moved into the post-pandemic period.5 Although influenza may initially cycle in animals such as pigs and birds (zoonoses), \u201cvariant\u201d forms of viruses may contribute to sporadic, unpredictable human infection outbreaks. These infections are usually the result of direct or indirect contact with animals such as swine and poultry, but may also be transmitted among humans under the right conditions. EV-D68 has also been of recent concern in summer and fall, 2014, for individuals with pre-existing respiratory conditions such as asthma or respiratory diseases.6,7 Influenza vaccines target those viruses predicted to be most common for that season. For example, the US 2014\u201315 flu vaccine will include influenza A H1N1, H3N2, and one or two influenza B viruses, depending on the version of the vaccine used.8",

The emergence or re-emergence of an infectious disease may be complicated by reservoirs of the disease (such as domesticated or wild animals) resulting in sporadic outbreaks among humans. A variety of environmental factors may contribute to re/emergence of a particular disease, including temperature, moisture, human food or animal feed sources, etc. Disease re/emergence may be caused by the coincidence of several of these environmental and/or social factors to allow optimal conditions for transmission of the disease. For example, Ebola virus is transmitted to humans from wild animals and then spreads via human-to-human transmission. It is believed that fruit bats are natural Ebola virus hosts and that the virus is introduced to humans via infected animals such as chimpanzees, gorillas, fruit bats, etc. found dead or ill in the rainforest.10",

Firstly, quality research is the foundation of a better understanding of how, when, and where disease agents are transmitted through the environment so that appropriate controls can be implemented to reduce the potential for disease transmission. Secondly, enforcement of proper environmental health regulations (eg, air, water, food, occupational health, waste management, vector control, etc.) by environmental health practitioners at the local, regional, national, and international level serves a vital role in limiting disease transmission. Finally, sharing and reinforcement of accurate information with the public concerning the potential for transmission of infectious disease and how it may be prevented or controlled is an important role that environmental health professionals can play. For example, it has been speculated that infectious disease transmission could be reduced by up to 80% by something as simple as appropriate, regular hand washing techniques.",

This concern may even be legitimate given the ability of humans to travel around the world within just a few hours. Movies and television showing the potential consequences of a pandemic (global) infection have also raised public awareness. However, human diversity and adaptability has thus far limited the spread of infectious disease. It is also important to note that of the top 10 leading causes of death worldwide as identified by the WHO, only three \u2013 lower respiratory infections, HIV/AIDS, and diarrheal disease (#4, #6, and #7, respectively) \u2013 have a clear infectious disease component.12 The rest of the causes are chronic diseases or accidents, which may be limited by personal habits such as an active lifestyle, lower fat diet, smoking cessation, and safer driving. While some media \u201csensationalism\u201d of international infectious disease outbreaks is unavoidable, environmental health professionals can help to provide a more balanced view of the risks and share ways in which individuals can empower themselves to prevent or control both infectious and non-infectious diseases.",
