Salim Abdulla from Ifakara Health Institute, Tanzania, compared the efficiency of the sweet anti-malarial pill, which contains artemether-lumefantrine and is designed to disperse in water, with the conventional pill, which is bitter and is dissolved into water, in 899 children aged 12 years or younger in Benin, Kenya, Mali, Mozambique and Tanzania. The sweet pill had a cure rate of 97.8% and the conventional pill had a cure rate of 98.5%. \u201cChildren prefer the cherry-flavoured medication and this improves the effective treatment of malaria,\u201d says Abdullah. If the flavoured pill receives further regulatory approval, it will be distributed to children in countries where malaria is endemic. The flavoured pill is expected to cost the same as the conventional bitter pill. Lancet/SciDev.Net",

Israel Hershkovitz, from Tel Aviv University, Israel, and colleagues excavated the bones from Alit-Yam, a Neolithic village in Israel dating from 9250\u20138160 years ago. The bones had the characteristic legions of TB, and PCR was used to identify five Mycobacterium tuberculosis genetic loci from the bone samples. Not only do these finding show that human TB is 3,000 years older than previously thought, they also shed new light on the origins of TB. \u201cThe infecting organism is definitely the human strain of the [TB], in contrast to the original theory that human TB evolved from bovine TB after animal domestication,\u201d says study co-leader Helen Donoghue from the University College London Centre for Infectious Diseases & International Health, United Kingdom. The authors argue that whereas domesticated animals were not the source of TB, they may have supported a denser human population, thereby facilitating the transmission of TB. PLoS ONE/HealthDay",

Each year, rotavirus, which causes vomiting and diarrhoea, is responsible for thousands of hospitalizations in the United States and kills more than half a million children globally. Jay Lieberman, of Focus Diagnostics, California, and colleagues assessed rotavirus testing results over the past 3 years and found that the rate of infections had fallen by 76% since the vaccine was introduced in 2006. The Merck-manufactured RotaTeq vaccine is administered in 3 doses, at 2, 4 and 6 months. Notably, rotavirus infection rates even fell in non-immunized, and older, children. \u201cA 2-month old who was vaccinated was less likely to infect the older brother or sister, or other children in day-care who weren't vaccinated,\u201d says Lieberman. According to CDC data, only one-third of 13 month olds have received 3 doses of the vaccine. Efforts are underway to make RotaTeq and Rotarix, a similar vaccine that is manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline and that was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in April, available in developing countries.

By performing longitudinal clonal evolutionary studies in 20 patients chronically infected with HIV-1 who had undergone structured treatment interruptions, Beda Joos of University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland, and colleagues showed that rebounding virus was homogeneous, suggesting that the virus had a monoclonal or oligoclonal origin during reactivation. These findings indicate that, contrary to expectations, HIV rebounds from latently infected cells rather than from continuing low levels of replicating virus. Jeffrey Laurence, Director of the Laboratory for AIDS Virus Research at Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, says that \u201cthese studies imply that current anti-HIV drug regimens are about as potent as they can be, completely blocking viral replication, and the cell-to-cell transmission of the virus.\u201d Proc.

Reporting at the 48th ICAAC\u2013IDSA 46th Annual Meeting, Jack Nguyen, of Adamas Pharmaceuticals, California, and colleagues tested their combination therapy, called triple combination antiviral drug (TCAD), in cell culture and mouse models of influenza. Owing to the \u201csurprising and unanticipated synergistic interactions of the three drugs,\u201d TCAD blocked replication of several influenza subtypes, including H1N1, H3N2 and H5N1. According to the authors, whereas three-drug combinations have proven to be effective for controlling other infections, such as HIV, their importance has not yet been realized for influenza virus. The authors add that \u201cTCAD represents a viable solution to meet the treatment challenges of yearly influenza epidemics and a potential pandemic, including the deadly H5N1 strain.\u201d ICAAC/IDSA",

These results, announced at a meeting of the American College of Chest Physicians, were based on the observation of 422 patients who had received blood transfusions from July 2003 to September 2006.

According to recent findings by Meredith Young and colleagues from McMaster University, Canada, your perception of disease severity depends on how much coverage the different diseases have received in the media. Researchers asked psychology and medical students to consider ten diseases that have had either high (Anthrax, West Nile virus, Avian flu, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Lyme disease) or low (Tularaemia, Yellow fever, Hantavirus, Lassa fever and human Babesiosis) media coverage and rate the diseases for severity, disease-like status and prevalence. \u201cParticipants considered diseases that occur frequently in the media to be more serious ... than those that infrequently occur in the media, even when the low media frequency conditions were considered objectively 'worse' by a separate group of students,\u201d the authors report. Moreover, they found that \u201cestimates of severity also positively correlated with popular print media frequency.\u201d Thankfully, students were also able to make non-media-dependent decisions on the severity of different diseases when they were given objective information about the diseases.

Previous findings show that there is a decrease in the abundance and biodiversity of Firmicutes in the intestines of patients with Crohn's disease. Building on these findings, Sokol and colleagues used fluorescent in situ hybridization to analyse the mucosa-associated microbiota of patients with Crohn's disease at the time of surgical resection, a treatment method for Crohn's disease, and 6 months later. They found that a reduction in F. prausnitzii was associated with a higher risk of recurrence. Moreover, oral administration of either F. prausnitzii or of its supernatant reduced the severity of a mouse model of colitis. The authors propose that F. prausnitzii exhibits anti-inflammatory effects on cellular and mouse models of colitis in part because secreted metabolites block nuclear factor-\u03baB activation and interleukin-8 production. \u201cThese results suggest that ... using F. prausnitzii as a probiotic is a promising strategy in [Crohn's disease] treatment,\u201d the authors conclude.
