The Medical Device Innovation Consortium (MDIC)\u2014a public-private partnership launched last month by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in collaboration with LifeScience Alley, a Minnesota-based trade association, and other industry representatives\u2014comes at a time when manufacturers have called on the FDA to speed up product reviews and public advocacy groups have argued that the agency isn't doing enough to protect consumers. As such, \u201cthe success [of MDIC] depends on robust governance by the FDA to ensure effective representation across stakeholder groups for public health needs,\u201d says Dale Nordenberg, executive director of the Medical Device Innovation, Safety and Security Consortium, an independent professional organization in New York.",

Such a centralized system, the IOM committee noted in a 27 November report, could be accessed every time the information is required for grant applications or journal submissions, thereby increasing transparency and reducing repetitive paperwork. \u201cHaving uniformly defined data will save journals, universities, professional societies and government agencies at a state and federal level the work and cost of creating and maintaining their own [COI] forms,\u201d says panel member Ross McKinney, a pediatric infectious diseases specialist at the Duke University School of Medicine in Durham, North Carolina.",

Previously, vaccines targeting the other four main subgroups of Neisseria meningitidis had been developed using fragments of sugars on the bacterium's outer membrane. However, this technique didn't work for serogroup B because the human immune system doesn't recognize this strain's sugar coat as foreign. For the new vaccine, Bexsero, which received a positive review from a European Medicines Agency committee in mid-November, scientists decoded the genetic makeup of the bacterium and discovered multiple proteins that, taken together, provide 73% protection against type B meningitis. According to Alison Patti, a spokesperson with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, the agency is working with the maker of Bexsero, Switzerland's Novartis, to test the product in the US.",

The Reykjavik-based company, which announced its bankruptcy in 2009 with $70 million in assets and $300 million in debt, was acquired on 10 December by California's biotech giant Amgen. Amgen paid $415 million in cash for deCODE, which made its name by establishing a huge genetic database of Iceland's population. As demonstrated by the large number of Nature Genetics publications over the years, deCODE's research team was very prolific, peaking in 2008\u2014just a year before poor investment decisions caused its share prices to plummet. Ultimately, the purchase \u201cshould be synergistic with Amgen's discovery efforts to use deCODE's platform to evaluate their current pipeline and optimize it for the right targets to pursue rapid development,\u201d says Eric Schmidt, an analyst at the New York\u2013based financial services company Cowen & Co.",

On 3 December, that appointment was made permanent. Nakamura previously spent 35 years at the agency's National Institute of Mental Health, where he served as both its scientific director and deputy director. His selection from a list of 27 applications, just two of whom were internal NIH candidates, is a sign to David Kaplan that the NIH plans to stick with the status quo. \u201cWe have an insider who won't change anything substantively,\u201d says Kaplan, an immunologist at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland who studies the peer-review process. \u201c[The CSR] really requires some rethinking of how the whole process is being managed, and that's exactly something the NIH does not want to do.\u201d",

In a study of fetal DNA from more than 4,400 expectant mothers at high risk of having children with birth defects, a US team found that microarray analysis revealed clinically relevant deletions or duplications in around 2.5% of samples, despite the fetal DNA displaying a normal karyotype (N. Engl. J. Med.\n367, 2175\u20132184, 2012). \u201cThese findings will undoubtedly cause many clinical and laboratory geneticists to consider whether chromosomal microarrays should be recommended as a first-tiered prenatal diagnostic test,\u201d says Cynthia Morton, director of cytogenetics at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, who was not involved in the trial.

            "text": "Newly discovered form of cell division may help ward off cancer Cell biologists have long thought that cytokinesis, the final step of cell division in which the cytoplasm and its contents are split, is necessary for the proper assortment of chromosomes. Disrupt this process, the prevailing wisdom held, and aneuploidy will result, with cancerous implications. But a team led by Mark Burkard at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison has discovered a new type of cell division, dubbed 'klerokinesis', that protects cells from failed cytokinesis. Using live-cell imaging, the researchers watched retinal pigment epithelial cells for five days after they had chemically inhibited cytokinesis. Reporting on 17 December at the American Society for Cell Biology's annual meeting in San Francisco, they showed that many cells managed to split into two during the first growth phase of the next cell cycle\u2014not during mitosis\u2014allowing each to recover a normal chromosome set. Burkard says that therapeutic strategies that boost this type of nonmitotic cell fission could prevent cancer in people at high risk of developing tumors marked by abnormal chromosomal counts.",
