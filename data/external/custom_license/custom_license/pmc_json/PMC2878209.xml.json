The plasmids containing major capsid protein (VP)\u20131 region of KIPyV and VP-2 region of WUPyV as positive control were donated by Tobias Allander and David Wang. All PCR products for WUPyV and KIPyV were sequenced to confirm the specificity for each virus. PCR product was examined after electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel. Amplicon was purified and sequenced in both directions. Nucleotide sequences were aligned by using BioEdit version 7.0 (www.mbio.ncsu.edu/bioedit/bioedit.html) and presented in a topology tree, prepared in MEGA 3.1 (15). Using SAS software version 8.02 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA), we performed the Fisher exact test to compare the proportion of symptomatic WUPyV patients with those who were in the control groups.",

Our detection of WUPyV in 34 (7.0%) of 486 children with acute lower respiratory tract infection suggests that the virus is prevalent in South Korea. Our finding of 27 (6.5%) WUPyV-positive samples among 416 patients <24 months of age compared with 7 (10%) positive samples from 70 patients >24 months of age suggests that WUPyV infection may occur more frequently in older children than in younger children; however, studies for latent infection of the virus are needed to confirm. Clinical diagnoses for patients with WUPyV-positive results only included bronchiolitis, tracheobronchitis, pneumonia, and croup. Coinfection of WUPyV with other respiratory viruses, especially hRSV, did not seem to influence the severity of disease, although we did not perform statistical analysis. Although our study tested for more viruses than previous studies and included a control group, whether detection of WUPyV in nasopharyngeal specimens means infection or just transmission in the respiratory tract remains unclear. We performed PCR assays for WUPyV in stool samples from 72 children who had acute gastroenteritis during the same study period, but it was not detected (data not shown).",
