Infectious diseases were reported as being the most important cause of death in 78 Iberian lynxes that were radio-tagged in Spain between 2006 and 2011, accounting for as much as 38.5% of all recorded mortalities (L\u00f3pez et al. 2014). In this respect, an outbreak of feline leukemia virus (FeLV) during 2007 severely affected (Meli et al. 2010) the small Iberian lynx population in Do\u00f1ana National Park (one of the only two remaining stable populations at that time). Subsequent studies carried out to investigate the transmission of FeLV from affected lynxes to cats stressed the particular susceptibility of Iberian lynxes to infectious diseases (Geret et al. 2011). Other infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, pasterellosis, clostridiosis, feline parvovirus infection, or Aujeszky\u2019s disease virus infection, have been confirmed to affect the Iberian lynx (Mill\u00e1n et al. 2009; L\u00f3pez et al. 2014; Masot et al. 2017), but few works have been published with regard to the effects of macroparasites and ectoparasites on L. pardinus, including their effect as pathogens or as vectors of pathogens (Mill\u00e1n et al. 2007).",

Various feline species have been described to be affected by sarcoptic mange in the wild, including the cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus), the serval (Felis serval), the African lion (Panthera leo), the leopard (Panthera pardus), and the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) (Munson et al. 2010). In the last case, sarcoptic mange was reported to be the most frequent infectious disease in Sweden, affecting up to 22% of the non-hunted dead lynxes reported (Ryser-Degiorgis et al. 2005a). The disease was considered to have contributed to the decrease in the Swedish lynx population during the first decade of a major mange epidemic (1980\u20131990, M\u00f6rner 1992), although after its hunting was prohibited, the population recovered in 1999 (Ryser-Degiorgis et al. 2005b). In Switzerland, mange was first detected in the small and inbred reintroduced Eurasian lynx population in 1999 (Ryser-Degiorgis et al. 2002) and increased the overall percentage of infectious causes of mortality by up to 40% (Schmidt-Posthaus et al. 2002), although no important related population decline was reported (von Arx et al. 2004).",

After death, a complete necropsy was performed at the CERI Wildlife Rehabilitation Center according to the work protocol established for this species (https://www.lynxexsitu.es/ficheros/documentos.../Manual_Sanitario_Lince_Ib_2014.pdf). After a thorough external examination and the collection of body measurements, skin scrapes were taken from the cub\u2019s ears, face, and footpads for the detection and identification of ectoparasites, and blood was collected from its jugular vein for molecular and serological studies. The animal\u2019s skin was removed and thoroughly reviewed after necropsy, in small skin patches of 10 \u00d7 10 cm using an Olympus SZX9 (10\u201357\u00d7) magnifier for the detection and collection of ectoparasites. Several tissues (brain, heart, lungs, intestine, spleen, kidney, liver, and scapular lymph nodes) and skin samples from eight anatomical regions (ear, lip, nose, periorbital, forelimb, hind limb, belly, and back) were taken and stored in 10% neutral formalin for their subsequent histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis. Oropharyngeal and rectal swabs, in addition to samples of the brain, blood, heart, lung, intestine, spleen, kidney, and liver, were also collected for serological, parasitological, and molecular analyses regarding the different pathogen agents studied in the Iberian lynx, as previously described (Hofmann-Lehmann et al. 1996; Ramsauer et al. 2007; Meli et al. 2009). Liver and gastric content for toxicological analyses and excrements for parasitological studies were also collected.

Since the death of N4-Keres, all the lynxes captured and handled in the Montes de Toledo during 2016 and 2017 (n = 30) have been subjected to skin scrapings and a thorough review for the detection of dermal lesions. The adults were captured by using trap cages with bait. They were anesthetized in order to monitor their health status, and blood samples, scrapings of the ear and face, along with oropharyngeal and rectal swabs, were collected for PCR studies, after which they were fitted with tracking collars. The cubs were also captured, although they were not anesthetized. After being examined in the cage, scrapings were taken from their ears, and FelV vaccinations and transponder placements were carried out. The two family groups of the females Keres and Kuna and their male (Kendo) were treated in 2016 with Selamectin (cubs) and Ivermectin (adults, with the exception of Kuna, who was treated with Selamectin, Table 1).",

Apart from those reported on the skin, the most relevant histopathological lesions reported in N4-Keres were observed in the mandible, tongue, and lung. A purulent abscess with the presence of Gram-positive cocci was observed in the mandible, with a predominance of neutrophils and lymphocytes. The tongue had purulent ulcerative glossitis, while the lungs had edema, congestion, and acute purulent bronchopneumonia.",

With regard to the Iberian lynxes affected, self-trauma and alopecia were rarely observed in mangy Eurasian lynx, while alopecia was spotty and never generalized when present. The presence of numerous mites on skin scrapings and histological sections is also a common finding in the Eurasian lynx (Pence and Ueckerman 2002; Ryser-Degiorgis et al. 2002). Histologically, the crusting dermatitis (with hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and the degeneration of epidermal cells found on the skin) of N4-Keres agrees with the findings in the Eurasian lynx affected (Pence and Ueckerman 2002). An interesting immunohistochemical finding was the presence of positive immunolabeling of S. scabiei Ss\u03bb20\u2206B3 protein in the lymphocytes and macrophages of the skin samples from 6 of the 8 anatomical regions in N4-Keres (Table 3). This immunolabeling pattern in macrophagues and lymphocytes has been considered a sign of an active\u2014and at least partially effective\u2014cellular immune response against S. scabiei infestation in other wild carnivores studied in Spain (Oleaga et al. 2012).",

Alterations compatible with severe pneumonia reported during the necropsy of N4-keres and subsequently confirmed by the histopathological findings could be suggested as the final cause of death of this lynx owing to their severity. Sepsis and pneumonia (secondary to bacterial infections) related to sarcoptic mange have frequently been found in some wild species and even humans and suggested to be the definite cause of death in serious sarcoptic mange cases, as a consequence of immunosuppression (Huffam and Currie 1998; Walton and Currie 2007; Nakagawa et al. 2009; Espinosa et al. 2017).

In this respect, both the mandibular abscess and the luxation of the left knee joint should be considered as relevant findings from a clinical point of view. The subcutaneous mandibular abscess was apparently related to the fracture of the lower right canine (picture c, Fig. 1) and showed the existence of a fistula draining caudally through the right lower jaw, whose purulent material could also be related to the bronchopneumonia described. Furthermore, the ankylosed and apparently old luxation of the left knee joint prevented the correct flexure and extension of the left lower leg (Table 2, Fig. 1d) for at least several weeks before death. Since this individual was in an area without supplementary feeding support at the moment of capture, both limitations in its movement (which could have triggered hunting problems) and mastication difficulties related to the mandibular lesions could, therefore, have caused feeding problems, thus favoring malnutrition, a severe weakening of its body condition, stress and immunosupression. Although we cannot rule out the possibility of N4-Keres having come into contact with S. scabiei previously and the fact that the disease could have had a greater effect over time, these concomitant immunosuppressive factors may explain why N4-Keres\u2019 body condition was worse than that of the other family members affected and the effect of S. scabiei was much more serious on it.",

The absence of mites and skin lesions in all the sympatric lynxes handled in 2017 (n = 19) suggested the end of the parasitic outbreak reported in Iberian lynxes from the Montes de Toledo and coincided with the necropsy data obtained for the 4 lynxes that died in traffic accidents in 2017.",

These same reasons lead us to hypothesize that previous cases of the transmission of sarcoptic mange to Iberian lynxes may have occurred in the field before this first description, but could have gone unnoticed owing to the hypothetical ability of immunocompetent Iberian lynxes to control this mite, and taking into account that the features of dermal lesions reported in mangy lynxes could also have hidden the disease in the field. The absence of conspicuous alopecia (Ryser-Degiorgis et al. 2002) reported in lynxes affected by sarcoptic mange can make this illness difficult to detect in the field, even through the use of camera trapping. Camera traps are widely used to monitor the Iberian lynx in the field (Guil et al. 2010; Gil-S\u00e1nchez et al. 2011), but their use would, therefore, appear to be of little value for the detection of mange compatible lesions in this species. Nevertheless, these same camera traps can undoubtedly provide valuable information about sympatric red foxes and the presence of sarcoptic mange lesions on them (Oleaga et al. 2011), thus warning about the increased risk of transmission from the red fox to the lynx on a local scale. It has been proposed that the presence of sympatric reservoirs (sarcoptic mange was confirmed in the necropsy of one red fox from the Montes de Toledo on May 25, 2016, unpublished data), together with a small population size and low genetic diversity, may increase disease-induced extinction risk for endangered species (Castro and Bolker 2005).",

Sarcoptic mange was recently described in the wild European rabbit (Mill\u00e1n 2010) and wild rabbit population restocking has been identified as a potential means of dispersing or introducing sarcoptic mange into resident populations (Navarro-Gonz\u00e1lez et al. 2010). Molecular based research on the features and origins of mites detected in the Iberian lynx is required, not only to identify health risks for this endangered species, but also for a better understanding of the pathogenesis and evolution of sarcoptic mange in this wild cat: the genetically based preference of S. scabiei for a particular host can determine the pathogenic effect of the parasite and the evolution of the disease in a new host (Kassen 2002; Rasero et al. 2010; Oleaga et al. 2013).",

The \u201cweak\u201d positive ELISA result (obtained for N3-Keres more than 200 days after its first handling, when the sarcoptic mange lesions and mites had been found and treated, Table 1) is difficult to interpret, and one of the possible explanations is a recent reinfection.

However, both Ivermectin (for adults) and Selamectine (for cubs) appeared to be safe and effective (at least for the parasite burdens present in the animals treated in the present work) in a single dose, according to the data obtained. The thorough monitoring and frequent handlings to which Iberian lynxes are subjected could allow the capture and effective treatment of individual cases as it has been reported in other threatened species (Young et al. 1972; Pence et al. 1982), but the eradication of mange in the field is not feasible, since other affected sympatric species are abundant and are a possible frequent source of mites (Bornstein et al. 2001; Mill\u00e1n et al. 2007). In the specific case of the Iberian lynx, the use of ectoparasitic treatments should also take into account the existence and conservation needs of Felicola isidoroi, a host-specific louse of Lynx pardinus, which has been suggested to be scarcer and, therefore, even more endangered than its host (P\u00e9rez et al. 2013; J\u00f8rgensen 2014).",

However, this local outbreak and its evolution, as studied in the present work, should not be considered as evidence of the Iberian lynx\u2019s real ability to avoid or control this disease. The existence of different situations, ecological features, and health threats prevents the extrapolation of data among different populations within the same species (L\u00f3pez et al. 2014). This presence of different health threats in different populations could explain the fact that the first descriptions of two new pathogen agents for the Iberian lynx, i.e., Pseudorabies virus (detected in 2015, Masot et al. 2017) and S. scabiei (detected in 2016, as shown in this work) have been reported in cubs born in the first year with confirmed reproduction in Extremadura (SW Spain) and Castilla La Mancha (Central Spain), respectively, from which the species had disappeared and was reintroduced in 2014 (LIFE10NAT/ES/570).",

Data obtained in this first outbreak suggest a limited effect of S. scabiei on immune-competent Iberian lynxes in the local population of the Montes de Toledo, at least during the first stages of the disease, and a good and apparently definitive recovery after treatment. However, a different evolution and relevance of sarcoptic mange in different populations, or even in the same one when confronted with immunosuppressive factors\u2014such as other immunosuppressive infectious diseases\u2014cannot be ruled out, which could trigger more serious consequences. In this respect, the fact that sarcoptic mange has been considered the most frequent infectious disease affecting the Eurasian lynx in Central Europe should warn us about its possible relevance for the Iberian lynx. Health surveillance works carried out on this wild cat and sympatric species that potentially share parasites with it are key tools for the early detection of health risks, and would, if necessary, allow the implementation of preventive or corrective measures. Further research is, therefore, required for a complete understanding of the epidemiology and real threat that this ectoparasitic disease may imply for L. pardinus.",
