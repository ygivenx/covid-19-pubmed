The United States has made great strides in protecting children from the serious, and sometimes deadly, effects of pneumonia through recent vaccination efforts. Tennessee, for example, is experiencing historically low rates of pneumonia hospitalizations in children aged <2 years since pneumococcal conjugate vaccines were introduced in 2000 (1). Data suggest that this progress also is being seen across the country (2). In spite of this success, however, pneumonia still kills approximately 50,000 people in the United States each year, 85% of whom are adults aged \u226565 years. In response, this year CDC recommended pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for adults aged \u226565 years.",

Many deaths and illnesses from pneumonia can be prevented with the use of 1) pneumococcal, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), influenza, and measles vaccines; 2) appropriate antimicrobial therapy; and 3) supportive health care, among other strategies.",

In late summer, infection with the uncommon enterovirus EV-D68 led to the hospitalization of hundreds of children in multiple states (4). In and around the Arabian Peninsula, a recently recognized coronavirus (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) has been fatal in about one third of reported cases (5). Vaccines are not available to provide protection against these or many of the other pathogens that commonly cause pneumonia, including respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, highlighting the importance of research into vaccine development as well as effective treatment and diagnostics for viral and bacterial pneumonia.
