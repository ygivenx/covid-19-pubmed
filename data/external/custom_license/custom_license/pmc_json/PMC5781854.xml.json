Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used for diagnosis in 10/11 centers; one center used rapid antigen testing. 8/11 institutions used inhaled ribavirin (RBV) in at least some patient populations. Reasons cited as barriers against use included cost, safety, lack of supporting evidence, and inconvenience. 8/11 centers used oral RBV and 3 stated a specific preference for oral and 3 a preference for inhaled. 4 of 11 used intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), often in combination with RBV. In the post-stem cell transplant (SCT) population, patients with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) were more likely to be treated than those with upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Pre-engraftment allo-SCT recipient with URTI would receive RBV in 5/11 centers while LRTI would be treated with RBV in 9/11 centers. 8 centers performed lung transplantation; all used either oral or inhaled RBV for LRTI, 6/8 for URTI. No center routinely treated non-lung solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients with URTI; 7/11 would consider oral or inh RBV in the same group with LRTI. Patients with hematologic malignancy but no HSCT were treated with RBV at a similar frequency (1/11 with URTI, 7/11 with LRTI). 2 of 9 centers in severe cases treated parainfluenza, metapneumovirus or coronavirus with IVIG or RBV.",
