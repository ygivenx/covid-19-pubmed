It can be dangerous because of the importance of the brain and the limited amount of space inside the skull. Most primary brain tumors do not metastasize systemically but spread locally through extensions of infiltrating tumor cells in normal brain. Surgery; radiation and chemotherapy are the current treatments for brain tumor (Henso, 2005; Maher et al., 2001; Stupp et al., 2005; Adam, 2017).",

            "text": "The treatment of primary brain tumors is difficult because of polyclonicity, the blood brain barrier, the diffuse infiltrative nature of these tumors, and the perilous location of some tumors. So, to cure brain tumors some consideration must be taken to kill all cells within the tumor and spare the remaining normal brain cells. Newcastle disease (ND) is a disease of poultry that affecting the alimentary and respiratory tract as well as the central nervous system, it is caused by Newcastle disease virus (NDV) (Brown and Bevins, 2017). Exposure to humans, however, results in mild conjunctivitis, laryngitis and influenza-like symptoms (Othman et al., 2010). Viral therapy for cancer (virotherapy) has significantly been identified to show some promise in cancer therapy. Virotherapy involves the treatment of cancer by using a virus specifically to infect cancer cells while leaving normal cells unharmed (You et al., 2004). NDV is a promise in clinical trials as an antineoplastic agent. It is one of the nonengineered oncolytic viruses, which has a long history as a broad-spectrum oncolytic agent that can destroy tumor cells and stimulate the immune system (Freeman et al., 2006; Schirrmacher et al., 1998). Many preclinical studies indicate that NDV replicates in human cancer cells, but not in normal cells, some types of NDV are able to directly kill certain types of cancer cells and NDV\u2013infected cancer cells can cause the immune system to respond in different ways. Interest in the use of NDV as an anticancer agent has arisen from the ability of the virus to selectively kill human tumor cells with limited toxicity to normal cells. Many strains of NDV (73-T, MH68, Italian, Ulester, Rokin, PV701 and HUJ) have been shown to exhibit an oncolytic activity (Omar et al., 2003; Freeman et al., 2006). In addition, the oncolytic effects of six Malaysian strains of NDV (AF2240, 01/C, Ijuk, S, F, and V4) have also been studied on several tumor cell lines (Omar et al., 2003; Niederhuber, 2006, Rowa et al., 2017). The goal of most cancer therapy is to reduce the number of tumor cells and to prevent their further accumulation (decrease the rate of cell proliferation). Therefore, in this study the effects of NDV strain AF2240 on the proliferation and the morphological changes of glioblastoma multiforme brain tumor cell line, (DBTRG.05MG), was tested in vitro.",

Figure 2 showed that the Inoculation of NDV strain AF2240 cells showed lower optical density in both values, IC25 and IC50 (132 and 460 HAU/ml), than controls. Whereas inoculation of NDV on cells with the IC50 values showed that the optical density was lower than inoculation with the IC25 values. This optical density is in proportion to the number of variable cells. Figures 1 showed that the growth rates decreased in the treated cells as compared with the untreated cells whereas inoculation with a higher titter of virus (IC50) decreased the growth rate more than low titer (IC25).

Membrane blebbing without disintegration of the cellular membrane occurred at 48 and 72 hours post-inoculation indicating of late stage of apoptosis. At 72 hours post -inoculation secondary necrosis was observed, and some apoptotic bodies eventually degenerated (Figure 7).",

Grade IV astrocytoma, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), is the most aggressive form of the primary brain tumors, it is the most common primary brain tumor in adults (Tatter, 2005). The standard treatments include surgery; radiation and chemotherapy are the current treatments for brain tumors (Ali et al., 2011). For three decades, several papers have shown the effectiveness of the NDV and medical literature documented its anticancer activity and its ability to induce tumor lysis through different mechanisms. Cell death can occur by two distinct processes: apoptosis and necrosis (Muneesh et al., 1995). Tumor cells under inappropriate conditions continue to proliferate even in the absence of proliferative signals. The goal of most cancer therapy is to reduce the number of tumor cells and to prevent their further accumulation (decrease the rate of cell proliferation). By using MTT cell proliferation assay this study found that the virus was capable to inhibit proliferation of both cell lines. Furthermore, in this study, cell death caused by NDV strain AF2240 infection on brain tumor cell lines occurred through apoptosis was identified from morphological and ultrastructural observations. Morphological assessment has been the most reliable method for the identification of individual apoptotic cells (Shaghayegh et al., 2018). The morphological features of apoptosis such as cell shrinking, cell membrane blebbing and chromatin condensation were observed by using phase contrast microscopy, fluorescent microscopy (AO/ PI method) and transmission electron microscopy.",

This method was used to observe the cells changing within its media after inoculation of NDV to determine apoptotic features. Phase contrast microscopy showed that treatment of DBTRG.05MG and U-87MG cells with NDV strain AF2240 produces fewer adherent cells compared to controls, and a larger proportion of freely floating cells. The cells rounded up, and the cells in culture lost contact with adjacent cells during treatment, and are therefore more likely to be shed from the plate. This occurs during which time any specialized surface structures such as microvilli disappeared and convolutions began to form (Liu and Liu, 2001). Rounding up of nuclei was one of the morphological changes occurred because of the digesting of the protein structures, which conform the cytoskeleton, by specialized peptidases (known as caspases) that have been activated inside the cell (Liu and Liu, 2001).",

            "text": "Transmission electron microscopy Briefly, after treatment of DBTRG.05MG cells with NDV strain AF2240, some cells showed typical morphologic changes of apoptosis, including shrinkage and membrane blebbing. Intracellular and plasma membrane structural modifications have been widely recognized as crucial factors involved in cell injury and death. Changes in nuclear morphology and in organelle structure as well as specific phenomena at the cell surface, namely surface smoothing and surface blebbing, are often considered as markers associated with cell pathology (Malorni 1998). TEM analysis could reveal the changes of cell ultrastructure during the apoptotic process (Lin et al., 2004). By means of TEM the results in this study showed that untreated brain tumor cells showed no changes and exhibited intact nucleus with clear cytoplasm while after brain tumor cell lines treating with NDV strain AF2240 the typical morphological features of apoptotic cells appeared, including chromatin condensation in dense masses under the nuclear membrane, compaction of the cytoplasm, crowding of organelles and surface protuberances. These changes occur within the nucleus during apoptotic death such as the appearance of dense, crescent-shaped chromatin aggregates which line nuclear membrane. Later, the nucleolus disintegrates; nuclear membrane develops deep invaginations and, ultimately, the nucleus fragmented into dense granular particles (apoptotic bodies). It is thought that the nuclear changes are due to activation of endogenous nuclease(s) which cleaves DNA into oligonucleosomal fragments (Oberhammer et al., 1993; Sho et al., 2001).",

DNA ladder assay provides a sensitive assay for the detection of DNA fragmentation, but this method is qualitative rather than quantitative (Muneesh et al., 1995). Fragmentation of chromosomal DNA is the biological feature of apoptosis, and can be detected by a ladder formation pattern using gel electrophoresis. The DNA ladder assay is generally accepted as specific for apoptosis because it detects oligonucleosomal cleavage rather than artificial DNA cleavage or necrosis. To date, apoptosis has been characterized biochemically by the production of 180-200 bp internucleosomal DNA fragments resulting from the activation of an endonuclease (Lin et al., 2004).",

The problem with the ladder assay is its low sensitivity. Even with enhancement of the fragmented DNA in the sample, DNA ladder formation is observed only when the extent of oligonucleosomal cleavage is prominent. Internucleosomal cleavage of DNA is likely to be in the later phase of apoptotic process (Lin et al., 2004; Cohen et al., 1992l; Gooch and Yee, 1999). In most cell types, the biochemical characteristics of apoptotic response include activation of endogenous calcium and magnesium dependent endonucleases, leading to fragmentation of the chromosomal DNA. Initially, the DNA fragments are large (50-300 kb) but are later digested to oligonucleosomal size (multimers of 180-200 bp). The formation of this distinct DNA ladder is considered to be a biochemical hallmark of apoptosis. A study by Oberhammer et al., (1993) stated that cleavage of DNA to 50 kbp internucleosomal fragments instead of degradation into 180-200 bp fragments was observed in several epithelial cell types. This was further confirmed by Grem et al., (1996) which stated that DNA fragmentation in some breast cancer cell lines was not companions by the generation of oligonucleosomal laddering; instead, induction of very high molecular weight DNA fragmentation was observed. Therefore, it was reported that apoptosis can occur fully in the absence of DNA fragmentation.",
