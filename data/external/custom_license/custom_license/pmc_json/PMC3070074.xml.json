The central width of this distribution is called mosaicity. A narrow distribution or equivalently small mosaicity allows for a precise distinction between the scattering vector components, vertical (qz) and parallel (q\u2551) to the lipid bilayer. Thereby, the multilamellar state of the samples, which can be almost fully hydrated by controlled relative humidity (Aeffner et al. 2009), provides a tremendous amplification of the scattering signal compared to single bilayer preparations. However, compared to single bilayer reflectivity, the multilamellar stacks usually impede the determination of the electron density \u03c1(z) on an absolute scale, unless a full q-range fit of the electron density is performed (Constantin et al. 2003).",

The specular peaks are accompanied by diffuse scattering in the form of so-called Bragg sheets extending along q\u2551. This scattering contribution can be assigned to lateral inhomogeneities at mesoscopic length scales (nanometers to a few micrometers) due to membrane fluctuations\u2014always present in the fluid/hydrated state\u2014and peptide insertions causing local orientational disorders (Fig. 1ii), which break the lateral translation invariance.",

The lipid chain correlation peak (Fig. 1v) is usually stretched around a circle with the radius q = (q\u25512 + qz2)1/2 \u2245 1.4 \u00c5\u22121 reflecting the distribution of acyl chain tilt angles with respect to the bilayer normal. The radial profile of the peak has a Lorentzian lineshape with a peak position corresponding to the inverse nearest-neighbor distance of chains and its width reflecting the lateral correlation length (see below). This peak is often broadened upon peptide insertion. A lateral correlation of membrane-inserted structures, e.g., a regular oligomerization as known from pore arrangements, can be detected and characterized from \u201csuperstructure peaks\u201d (Constantin et al. 2007) in the small-angle region at low qz (Fig. 1vi). In addition, the conformation of the reconstituted peptide\u2019s structure can in some cases be deduced from the low q\u2551 signal of molecular form factors, the so-called helix maximum (Fig. 1vii), or from helix peaks revealing intrahelical distances at high q\u2551 (not shown) as it has been revealed for the regularly organized and conformationally constrained alamethicin single helix (Spaar and Salditt 2003).",

Therefore, this motif holds a tunable, conformationally stable peptide structure that is open for multiple functionalization (Schneggenburger et al. 2010). The d,l alternation of the peptide backbone concordant with a double-helical \u03b2-type shape is related to natural peptide antibiotics such as gramicidin A (Kelkar and Chattopadhyay 2007) or feglymycin (Bunk\u00f3czi et al. 2005). In addition, the studied sequences are unique on their own due to their almost purely aromatic side-chain composition (Alexopoulos et al. 2004; K\u00fcsel et al. 2007). On the basis of the crystallographically elucidated water-soluble nonameric sequence H-(Tyr-Tyr)4-Lys-OH (note: underlined amino acids indicate the d-conformer), the homodimeric dodecamer H-(Phe-Tyr)5-Trp-Trp-OH (1) (Fig. 2a, b) and the covalently linked hairpin species H-(Phe-Tyr)5-Trp-Trp-Gly-Lys-Pro-Gly-(Phe-Tyr)5Trp-Trp-OH (2) and H-Lys(NBD)-Tyr-(Phe-Tyr)4-Trp-Trp-Gly-Lys-([C2H4O]2-CH2-CO-gcgtgg-Lys-Lys)-Pro-Gly-(Phe-Tyr)5-Trp-Trp-OH (3) (Fig. 2a) (note: gcgtgg represents the nucleobase sequence of aminoethylglycine peptide nucleic acid monomers) were derived via synthetic modification applying solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) and loop design (Schneggenburger et al. 2010). The transmembrane helices of the latter structures (1\u20133) are well adapted to the membrane environment as optimized by sequence variation in length and composition (K\u00fcsel et al. 2007).",

This goal was fulfilled through the synthesis of the peptide hairpin 2 (Fig. 2c, iv) allowing for further studies that address peptide oligomerization within lipid model membrane complexes. The helix assembly is, thereby, driven by molecular recognition of the peptide nucleic acid (PNA) moieties at the membrane\u2019s exterior (Fig. 2c, v\u2013vi; Schneggenburger 2010). The attachment of fluorescence probes and peptide nucleic acid (PNA) recognition moieties led to functional constructs, such as compound 3, that have already been tested for their dynamic dimerization within lipid bilayer structures via F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) assays (Schneggenburger et al. 2010).",

In the respective studies, parameters such as the sample composition, the relative humidity (RH), and the peptide-to-lipid (P/L) ratio are varied. The obtained results can be explained by a qualitative model that predominantly takes into account a hydrophobic mismatch situation as well as a lateral packing and ordering of the annular lipid shell that is correlated to the extent of peptide-lipid contact surface. Furthermore, we analyze the differentially (double) iodine-labeled hairpin species of type 2 via anomalous and in-house reflectivity elucidating their positioning with respect to the membrane normal (z axis) and confirming their transmembrane orientation. These experiments created the basis for a functional FRET assay that was reported elsewhere (Schneggenburger et al. 2010).",

The beam was cut by the entrance slits to 0.7 \u00d7 0.7 mm2 in front of the sample; no beam restrictions were set on the detector side. Three different types of measurements were performed:\nAfter placing the sample roughly horizontally and adjusting the specular axis to the center of the CCD, four images were taken along the qz direction under stepwise increase of the angle of beam incidence (\u0394\u03b1i = 0.45\u00b0) enabling the calculation of the actual \u03b1i as well as the exact sample detector distance and allowing for scanning the low q\u2551 space for peaks resulting from superstructures (Fig. 3).Adjustment of the specular axis at one side of the CCD and coverage by a lead stripe facilitated scanning the reciprocal space far from the specular axis yielding combinations of exposures that provide a partial overlap. With this data collection an overview of the reciprocal space was achieved in which peaks representing intrahelical distances might occur (data not shown).Quantitative images including the nonattenuated specular axis (q\u2551 = 0) on one side of the CCD plate up to q\u2551 = 2.5 \u00c5\u22121 were taken with accumulated exposure series of 20\u2013600 images applying single exposure times of 0.3\u20135.0 s.

The reflected beam was recorded by two wide-opened slits of 4.0 \u00d7 4.0 mm2 and 3.0 \u00d7 3.0 mm2. For line scanning under specular conditions, an avalanche photodiode (APD) was used as a point detector and placed directly behind the last slits reducing parasitic air scattering. The sample-to-detector distance was 28 cm. In order to reduce sample degradation (beam damage) during motor movement and in between scans, especially when applying low X-ray energies, a \u201cfast shutter\u201d was implemented in front of the entrance slits/absorber box and synchronized with the detector (Giewekemeyer and Salditt 2007). Therefore, no automated absorbers could be used during reflectivity or offset scans; absorbers had to be calibrated in advance of data collection. A monitor, mounted directly in front of the sample, was used to control the beam intensity. To further reduce dose and avoid beam damage, the reflectivity curves and offset scans were recorded only in the vicinity of the Bragg reflections at calculated positions.",

The scattering length becomes explicitly dependent on the X-ray energy E near the absorption edge, according to f = f0 + f\u2032(E) + if\u2033(E), where f0 is the number of electrons of the ion (nonresonant term) and f\u2032 and if\u2033 are the real and imaginary corrections of the scattering factor, respectively (Evans and Pettifer 2001). Both f\u2032 and f\u2033, connected by the Kramers-Kronig relations, strongly vary in the vicinity of an absorption edge and can be measured (f\u2033) or obtained from databases. At an absorption edge the absolute values of f\u2032 and f\u2033 are the highest with respect to nonresonant energy regions, where f \u2248 f0. Thus, in a resonant diffraction experiment it is very important to determine the energy value of the absorption edge accurately to a resolution of about 1 eV. It is known that the scattering factors f\u2032 and f\u2033 of a chemical species within a sample, here iodine, depend very sensitively on its environment. Since there are many influences on these values, their accurate calculation by theoretical consideration is not feasible. Therefore, it is the most reliable strategy to measure f\u2033 and calculate f\u2032 during the experimental setup (Als-Nielsen and McMorow 2001). Experimentally, it is possible to access f\u2033 by absorption or fluorescence measurements. In order to mimic the hydrophobic environment within a lipid membrane where peptides should be placed, absorption measurements were performed using quartz capillaries (700 \u03bcm diameter) filled with 0.5 M iodoform dissolved in chloroform. Instead of measuring f\u2033 and calculating f\u2032 the distinct iodine LIII edge was found by varying the beam energy about \u00b10.025 keV around the tabulated LIII edge by means of modulating the undulator gap and detecting the absorption. The iodine LIII edge was found at E = 4.5578 keV. For the contrast variation in the anomalous scattering experiments, the reflectivity measurements were performed at energies of 4.5578 and 5.8000 keV.",

All other samples were analyzed at RH = 94%.",

            "text": "In general, lowering the RH promotes the gel phase character of the lipid membranes causing a reduced fluidity and increased inter-bilayer potentials (Ho et al. 1995; Long and Hruska 1970). Upon reducing the water content of the system, the fraction of gauche bonds within the lipid acyl chains is diminished and leads to lipid chain stretching. As a consequence, the lipid chain alignment and ordering (Cevc and Marsh 1985) as well as a lateral compression or packing (Bryant et al. 2001; Chen and Hung 1996) are enhanced. Such behavior was confirmed by the results obtained from measurements for samples 5\u20139. In line with the literature, a lowering of the acyl chain distance of about \u0394amax = 0.097 \u00b1 0.006 \u00c5 and an increase in the correlation length of \u0394\u03bemax = 0.8 \u00b1 0.2 \u00c5 were observed when comparing the results for RH = 94% to RH = 25% and to RH = 60%, respectively. The revealed effect that at low water content with RHs between 40 and 25%, the correlation length \u03be seems to reach saturation and even slightly decreases for sample 9, can be associated with the steric demands exerted by the peptide and cholesterol inclusions (Fig. 5b). Steric demands of the relatively rigid peptide helices become more critical in the more condensed phases than in the fluid phase (Mar\u010delja 1974). This condition of so-called intermediate fluidity (Oldfield and Chapman 1972) describes the fact that the interaction between inclusions such as cholesterol or peptides cannot be as strong as interactions among ordered all-trans lipid chains (Mar\u010delja 1974). We did not observe the phenomenon of an interchain hydration at high RH that is concomitant with an increased lipid chain-chain distance and results from defect structures caused by inserted peptides (Ho et al. 1995).",

One may initially expect the opposite effect, i.e., an increase in a and a decrease in \u03be. This could appear conclusive, since the occupation of the lipid bilayer area by peptide inclusions would lead to additional and longer trans-helix chain-chain distances for so-called annular lipids, which are in direct contact with the peptide helix. Furthermore, the absent chain-chain correlation between those lipids could reduce \u03be.

            "text": "Changes in the lateral bilayer structure upon peptide insertion are mostly discussed in theoretical studies and appear contradictory with respect to their conclusions. Already in early work, motivated by fluorescence data, a distinction is made between lipids not in contact with protein or peptide surface and lipids \u2018coupled\u2019 to the reconstituted protein, which are, thereby, disturbed in their interaction (Tr\u00e4uble and Overath 1973). These so-called annular lipids were shown not to undergo lipid phase transitions. The postulated protein-derived disturbance was calculated to extend up to the third lipid neighbor of a protein inclusion (Mar\u010delja 1976). Addressing the structure of annular lipids in greater detail by theoretical molecular field approximations revealed an increased ordering of the lipid chains in proximity to membrane-incorporated structures within the fluid lipid phase (Mar\u010delja 1974). With increasing fraction of \u201cforeign molecules\u201d on the phospholipid bilayer, the membrane order parameter was reported to increase and the dependency of the order parameter on temperature to become less pronounced. We will denote this scenario as the (annular) lipid ordering scenario. In the lipid condensed phase, this effect was described to be the opposite, which we denote as the lipid disordering scenario. Other authors claim that rigid inclusions such as cholesterol might cause straightening and ordering of lipid chains, while the fluid-like surface of embedded proteins does not influence the motional freedom of the lipid chains (Lafleur et al. 1990a). Molecular dynamics simulations of three different peptide \u03b1 helices, published at the same time, likewise revealed an ordering of the lipid chains close to the peptide helices for all peptide species (Edholm and Johansson 1987). Even if the overall effect was assessed as \u201cnot drastic,\u201d the annular lipid ordering could be estimated as \u201cmuch less pronounced\u201d for lipids with bulky side chains. More recent theoretical considerations applying statistical mechanical integral equation theories (Lag\u00fce et al. 1998) predict an expansion of the area per lipid for the annular shell upon peptide insertion into different phosphatidylcholine (PC) bilayers. In these studies, peptides are treated as soft cylinders (Lag\u00fce et al. 2001). The authors postulate effective long range repulsion between lipids and peptides due to the formation of a lipid depletion layer around a protein leading to an increased cross-sectional area per lipid molecule. According to this view, which also supports the lipid disordering scenario for annular lipids, a lipid molecule in close contact with the peptide must significantly reduce its order. Effective lipid-protein repulsion would arise due to its entropic disadvantage. These theoretical results were further supported by MD simulations of a hydrated 1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPhyPC) bilayer containing an \u03b1-helical peptide bundle of four transmembrane domains (Husslein et al. 1998). Comparable to the results of Lag\u00fce et al., Husslein and coworkers revealed an increase in the area per lipid from 7.46 nm2 for the unperturbed bilayer to 8.50 nm2 in the vicinity of the peptide species. Finally, for the sake of completeness, we note that a pronounced annular lipid effect is not reported by all studies. Using spin labeling techniques, Marsh and Horv\u00e1th found order parameters of protein-associated lipid chains to be very similar to those in the bulk liquid-crystalline phase regions (Marsh and Horv\u00e1th 1998).",

Hydrophobic matching and interfacial anchoring are especially important for the presented peptide species, as all of them hold two flanking tryptophan residues. The magnitude of hydrophobic mismatch is considered to be a function of the distance between interfacial anchoring residues, here tryptophans, and not the overall peptide length (De Planque and Killian 2003). In this respect, tryptophan residues are known to provide the highest tendency for localization at the interface between the lipid bilayer core and the polar lipid headgroup.

Huang and coworkers observed a stretching of a DLPC lipid bilayer upon incorporation of gramicidin A that likewise adopts \u03b2-helical structures, similar to the d,l-alternating peptides applied in the presented approach (Harroun et al. 1999). In previous studies of the homodimeric species 1, comparable effects were indicated by a thickening of the lipid bilayers of 1.4 \u00c5 (DMPC = 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) and 4.0 \u00c5 (DLPC), respectively (K\u00fcsel et al. 2007). Finally, the reflectivity experiments of the designed peptide hairpin structures 2, 5, 7, 8, and 9 unambiguously prove a positive mismatch situation, also for the hairpin structures, as presented in Table 2. Such mismatching promotes stretching of the lipid chains and reduction in gauche conformations in the lipid acyl chains. The mismatch situation as well as the described lateral effects may be directly coupled or, alternatively, may independently contribute to the observed changes in a and \u03be upon peptide insertion, as addressed in the following section.",

The concentration effect can be factored out by comparing different samples (3 and 4) of the hairpin species at P/L = 1/20 and P/L = 1/40, respectively, showing that higher peptide concentration yields shorter lipid chain distances. It can further be concluded that the recognition system 3/6 (equimolar ratio) at RH = 94% (sample 5) has less impact on a than the respective hairpin peptide 5 (sample 4) at identical P/L = 1/40.

In the case of the hairpin structure 2, due to a decline in helix propensity compared to the homodimeric species 1 as revealed by CD spectroscopy (Schneggenburger et al. 2010), it was assumed that the hairpin structure exhibits steric clashes in the reverse-turn region leading to a less perfect alignment of the double strands and a broadening of the helix diameter. Therefore, the self-associated homodimer 4 should provide a closer alignment enabled by hydrogen bonding of the two antiparallel-oriented strands. The PNA recognition system 3/6 leading to an aggregation of two of the double helices in a close contact state (Schneggenburger et al. 2010) would yield more than a doubled lateral occupied area within the lipid bilayer (Fig. 2c).

In line with the lipid disordering scenario discussed above, larger peptide cross-sectional areas and peptide lipid contact surfaces would probably cause higher values for the lipid acyl chain distance a and smaller values for the lipid correlation length \u03be. This is true if peptide/lipid interactions are neglected or a repulsive potential between lipids and peptides is assumed (Lag\u00fce et al. 2001). For the present sample sequence: homodimer (4) \u2192 hairpin (5) \u2192 recognition system (3/6), this would imply an increase in a and a decrease in \u03be. The fact that the observed results point to the opposite may be taken as evidence for attractive peptide lipid interactions. Due to the sequence identity of the antiparallel TMD strands of all peptide species, and therefore, the constitutional similarity of the postulated attractive peptide/lipid interactions, only the peptide secondary structure, i.e., the lateral sizes of the peptides, and the size of the lipid/peptide interfacial plane should affect a and \u03be. Therefore, a monotonous decrease in the lipid chain distance would be expected for samples 1\u20133, which is in line with the obtained results (Fig. 5b). On the contrary, a monotonous increase in the chain correlation length was not observed. The value for \u03be of the homodimeric species 4 (sample 2) appears higher than that for the hairpin 5 (sample 3). This might be explained by the fact that oligomer 4 is known to experience a monomer-dimer equilibrium (K\u00fcsel et al. 2007) including a structural change from a membrane-spanning \u03b25.6 helix to two reasonable broader and shorter \u03b26.3 single helices (Fig. 2). This would actually change the peptide dimensions in the z direction as well as the molecular constitution of the helix surface and therefore cause different hydrophobic mismatch situations as well as changed lateral peptide/lipid interactions.",

These probably stem from misalignment or drift when changing the photon energies. Thus, the two approaches of contrast variation (in-house and synchrotron) are not in quantitative agreement. For the in-house measurement, the effect of a decrease in electron density contrast of the side minima compared to the global minimum is observed in most peptide/lipid systems. The decrease can be explained by a beginning lipid disorder that evens the density profile by increased density in the water layer and/or an enlarged area per headgroup (Li and Salditt 2006); this effect may be more pronounced for a peptide carrying a bulky iodine label. However, we also cannot rule out systematic errors for the in-house measurements, and beyond the thickening effect, which appears to be robust, the small differences between curves with and without labels may impede an unambiguous localization of the iodine position. Finally, we must be cautious since iodine-labeling itself may influence peptide/lipid interactions. However, there is no obvious reason why attachment of the iodine labels at different positions should cause different peptide positioning, especially as the iodine labels have been shown to have only minor effects on the peptide secondary structure (Schneggenburger et al. 2009).",

If this is not an artifact of the rather problematic synchrotron experiment, it could be possibly attributed to increased lipid fluctuations or beginning lipid disorder upon localization of the rather bulky iodine labels at the lipid headgroup region. The electron density difference curve shows only two symmetrically distributed maxima at approximately z = \u00b1 15.0 \u00c5 indicating a localization of the iodine labels at the lipid headgroup region tending to the membrane interior. This observation would perfectly fit with a transmembrane orientation of the \u03b2-hairpin (Fig. 11i), although an orientation parallel to the membrane surface at the headgroup region (Fig. 11iii) cannot be ruled out. Taking into account the observations made for the peptide/lipid complex 7/DLPC/Chol (1/47.5/2.5), this appears rather unlikely, since the depth of the insertion should not depend on the position of the label along the helix. The distance between the maxima of the electron density difference curve, associated with the distance of the two iodine labels is about 32 \u00c5 (see the Electronic Supplementary Material).

The corresponding electron density difference curve is pronounced due to the double signal intensity resulting from the double iodinated label, but differences in resolution at the different X-ray energies may also play a role. The profile shows strong maxima at \u00b115.4 \u00c5 and additional inflection points around \u00b17.1 \u00c5 (Fig. 10d). The maxima at \u00b115.4 \u00c5 may indicate a transmembrane orientation of the \u03b2-hairpin structure 8 nearly spanning the same distance as the terminally labeled sample 7/DLPC/Chol. The electron density difference curve of in-house reference measurements does not show significant rises in the headgroup region, but only at the membranes outside (\u00b121.4 \u00c5) in the membrane water layer (see above).

In other words, the differences from one sample to the next may be on the same order as the label effect itself. Note that one needs a much higher reproducibility to interpret the difference curve than the rather gross features of the profiles before subtraction.
