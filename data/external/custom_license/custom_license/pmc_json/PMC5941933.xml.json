            "text": "Over the past two decades, several strategies have emerged to characterize N-glycans of glycoproteins and identify the glycosites that are recognized and used by the cellular glycosylation machinery. Several methods employ endoglycosidases, such as PNGase F and PNGase A, to release the glycans from the protein, followed by analysis of glycoforms using MS30,31,32,33,34,35 or high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)36,37 with or without prior derivatization38. The MS-based methods provide a composition for each molecular ion, which is annotated as a high-mannose or complex-type glycan consistent with biosynthetic principles. Furthermore, tandem mass spectra of derivatized N-glycans generated by both matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) and electrospray ionization (ESI) MS have been widely used for characterization of detailed structural information of N-glycans expressed in different biological systems30,34. Freely available software tools such as GRITS Toolbox (http://www.grits-toolbox.org/) are able to automatically process, annotate, and archive glycomics data in a high-throughput manner. The HPLC methods rely on retention times of N-glycan standards for identification of the glycan species. With both methods, supporting experiments using glycosidase digestions and/or permethylation analysis can provide additional support for structure assignments. Such methods find wide utility in characterizing glycosylation of highly studied glycoproteins such as immunoglobulins (e.g., IgG), or detecting individual differences in N-glycans of serum glycoproteins36,37,39. Although these methods provide key information about the nature of the glycoforms present on a glycoprotein and their relative abundance, they do not reveal which glycosites are utilized or the extent to which each glycosite is occupied.",

            "text": "A number of proteomics-based methods focus on identification of the glycosites that are utilized by the OST and the degree to which the site is occupied by a glycan40,41,42,43,44. The basic strategy is to immobilize glycopeptides by using lectins or by coupling periodate-treated glycopeptides to hydrazide-activated beads. Then the peptides are released from the bound glycan with an endoglycosidase (e.g., PNGase F) that, in the process, converts the Asn-X-Thr/Ser sequence to Asp-X-Thr/Ser. When the reaction is performed in H2O18, it creates a mass difference from Asn to Asp of +3. Then MS/MS analysis of the eluted peptides provides positive identification of the sites that are glycosylated. These methods are particularly useful for surveying complex biological systems, such as whole cells or tissues, to identify proteins that are glycosylated.",

            "text": "Recently, there have been major advances in glycoproteomics MS/MS methods that analyze intact glycopeptides and determine which glycoforms are present at each glycosite based on the combined masses of the glycopeptides and N-glycan8,28,29,45,46,47,48. Major limitations of this approach are the relatively low abundance of glycopeptides in the protein digest mixture, as well as the inherent low ionization efficiency of glycopeptides during MS analysis40,41,49,50. For these reasons, glycopeptides are typically enriched from peptide digests prior to MS analysis with different purification methods, such as hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC)29,51,52 and hydrazide chemistry40. Despite the use of different fragmentation methods, including collision-induced dissociation (CID), high-energy collision dissociation (HCD), and electron-transfer dissociation (ETD), the inherent heterogeneity of glycoforms at each glycosylation site, as well as difficulties in obtaining good peptide backbone fragmentations for peptides with large glycans, impedes comprehensive identification of intact glycopeptides28,30. Annotation of LC-MS/MS data from such experiments is possible by using commercial algorithms such as Byonic (http://www.proteinmetrics.com/products/byonic/). However, quantitative assessment of the relative abundance of the glycan structures detected at each glycosite is still a substantial challenge due to unknown ionization efficiencies for peptides with each glycoform, especially for those with sialic acid-containing structures38. Moreover, if the glycopeptides are enriched prior to analysis, peptides with no glycan are lost, and the degree of glycosite occupancy cannot be assessed.",

The need stems from the fact that the primary candidate for a vaccine is the HIV envelope glycoprotein trimer (Env) that contains 75\u201390 N-glycans, creating a glycan shield to protect against attack by the immune system53,54. Despite the dense cover of N-glycans, bnAbs that bind to HIV Env do occur in 10\u201330% of HIV-1-infected patients55,56. Importantly, some bnAbs show interactions with high-mannose glycans57,58, whereas others show dependence on complex-type glycans12,15,59,60. Thus, to support the rational design of an HIV Env vaccine, we developed a method that could assess the proportion of high-mannose-type and complex-type N-glycans at each glycosite on the HIV Env10. However, as demonstrated here, the method is broadly applicable to any glycoprotein.",

After protease digestion, endoglycosidase H (Endo H) is used to remove all high-mannose- and hybrid-type N-glycans that have at least 5 mannose residues (Fig. 1). This enzyme leaves a GlcNAc-Asn residue that adds +203 to the peptide mass. Subsequently, the remaining complex N-glycans are removed with PNGase F in the presence of H2O18, which both removes the glycan and converts Asn to Asp, with a +3 addition to the peptide mass. Peptides carrying glycosites (Asn-X-Thr/Ser) with Asn (unoccupied), GlcNAc-Asn (Endo H\u2013treated), or Asp (PNGase F\u2013treated), display similar ionization efficiencies during MS analysis10,45, allowing us to use ion intensity peak area to quantify the relative distribution of the three glycosylation states at each glycosite detected10,61. Another distinguishing feature of the method is the use of multiple proteases, which can generate up to thousands of spectra hits for each glycosite, resulting in >95% sequence coverage. This simple strategy effectively converts the glycoproteomics analysis to a proteomics analysis, allowing the use of robust proteomics software to analyze data in a high-throughput manner.",

Glycoproteins are then denatured and alkylated at pH 6 (Steps 13\u201317) to minimize non-enzymatic deamidation while retaining protein sequence coverage. Proteins are digested with several different protease treatments, including 'triple digestion', chymotrypsin, and a combination of trypsin and chymotrypsin, in order to maximize sequence coverage and increase the confidence of detecting each glycosite (Step 18).In the second stage (Steps 19\u201325), proteases are denatured by heating to prevent incorporation of 18O-water into the C termini of peptides during the subsequent PNGase F treatment.In the third stage (Steps 26\u201336), sequential endoglycosidase treatment is employed to create unique mass signatures relative to the predicted amino acid sequence, for peptide glycosites that are not occupied (+0 Da) or that are occupied by high-mannose/hybrid- (+203 Da) or complex-type glycans (+3 Da) (Fig. 2a).The resulting samples are subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis (Step 37).Data processing for identification and quantitation of peptides for the three glycosylation states is done using the Integrated Proteomics Pipeline (IP2) software package (stage 5, Steps 41\u201353). The MS1 and MS2 data are extracted from MS raw files with RawConverter and processed using multiple components from the IP2 software package (Steps 38\u201353).",

The methods developed by the two groups focus on characterizing intact glycopeptides with or without enrichment of glycopeptides prior to MS analysis, and thus can provide complementary information about individual glycoforms at each glycosite. However, milligram quantities of material may be required for their methods, which is attributed in part to the relatively low ionization efficiencies of glycopeptides and in part to the fact that each glycopeptide is actually a mixture of many different glycoforms28,29. Although the complexity is reduced by using only two proteases, chymotrypsin and trypsin, identification of all forms of a glycopeptide with multiple N-glycans is still a challenge, even when using a combination of CID and ETD for fragmentation27,28. Quantitative measurements are also challenging, due to unknown ionization of glycopeptides with different N-glycan species during MS analysis. Moreover, there is limited information about site occupancy, due to markedly different ionization efficiencies between peptides and the corresponding glycopeptides, and/or enrichment of glycopeptides prior to MS analysis.",

However, typically, glycopeptides are selectively captured using treatment with periodate followed by binding to hydrazide-activated beads, or are enriched using lectins. The peptides are then released using PNGase F, in which glycosylated asparagine is converted to aspartic acid (+1 Da mass shift), allowing indirect identification of glycosites in the released peptides40,41. Alternatively, for a purified protein, PNGase F can be applied directly, and site occupancy of glycosylation sites can be determined by measuring the ratio of peptides with glycosites containing asparagine to aspartic acid during ESI-MS analysis28. By comparison with the protocol described here, addition of a second endoglycosidase, Endo H, provides additional information about the extent of glycan processing, in addition to the degree of site occupancy.",

Glycoproteins are denatured and alkylated at pH 6 instead of a mildly alkaline pH to minimize the non-enzymatic deamidation of Asn to Asp, which can complicate data analysis65. To maximize sequence coverage, a number of different protease digestions are used, including digestion by chymotrypsin, a combination of trypsin and chymotrypsin, and combinations of Arg-C, trypsin, elastase and subtilisin ('triple digestion')66 (Step 18). Of note, a combination of all proteolytic digestions is essential for detecting all glycosites on heavily glycosylated proteins with large molecular weights, such as the HIV Env trimer and the spike glycoprotein of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV S-2P protein). Triple digestion alone is able to identify all glycosites in glycoproteins containing only a few glycosites, whereas for most glycoproteins, a combination of triple digestion and chymotrypsin is enough to generate detectable peptides that contain all the glycosylation sites10. Another benefit of the use of multiple proteases, including trypsin and nonspecific proteases, is that it produces a sequence ladder that contains a series of peptides with variable numbers of amino acid residues on both sides of glycosite, allowing for highly confident identification for a given glycosite (Supplementary Table 1). For single glycoproteins or simple mixtures (e.g., viruses), the use of multiple proteases allows for much higher confident detection and semiquantitative analysis of the three states of glycosylation for each glycosite. However, for more-complex mixtures (e.g., cells, plasma) use of specific proteases such as trypsin will result in reduced complexity and the identification of glycosites while retaining the ability to detect the three different glycosylation states. Another key aspect of the protocol is that only volatile salts, such as ammonium bicarbonate and ammonium acetate, are used, so that no column purification is needed, resulting in high specificity of the protocol (requires \u223c30 \u03bcg of starting material).",

Residual active trypsin and other proteases used for proteolysis can incorporate O18 into the C termini of the peptides during the deglycosylation step67, resulting in a high false-positive identification of peptides that may have glycosites.

Although single-dimension separation is sufficient for characterization of site-specific glycosylation of purified proteins, multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT), in which peptides are systematically separated based on the charge in the first dimension and hydrophobicity in the second, will accelerate measurement of site-specific N-glycan processing of glycoproteins in these complex protein samples68.",

            "text": "One of the distinguishing features of this protocol is the use of sequential treatment of glycopeptides with endoglycosidases (Endo H followed by PNGase F) to create unique mass signatures for glycosites that have no N-glycan, high-mannose-type glycan, or complex-type glycan. This strategy converts the glycoproteomics analysis to a proteomics analysis, resulting in higher sensitivity of the protocol (only 30 \u03bcg of sample is needed for a complete analysis). The key to success is that the sequential endoglycosidase treatments proceed to completion, avoiding mis-assignment of N-glycan processing status. To this end, we applied the protocol to assess site-specific N-glycan processing of two well-characterized model glycoproteins, invertase produced by the yeast S. cerevisiae and \u03b1-1-acid glycoprotein from bovine serum70. Glycosites on invertase are occupied by underprocessed oligomannose, and those on \u03b1-1-acid glycoprotein are fully processed complex-type glycosylation (Fig. 3). All N-glycosites on both glycoproteins were identified with multiple MS/MS spectra ranging from 54 to >10,000 per site (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). Low percentages of spectra hits that contain non-enzymatic deamidation or 18O-incorporation into the C termini of peptides were found among all spectra hits identified, which is attributed to the complete denaturation of proteases used (Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). As described in the procedure section, as well as the previous study10, a set of peptides with N+0, N+3, and N+203 modifications was considered only when at least one of the three had a peak area of at least 5 \u00d7 108. As expected, the 14 N-glycosites of invertase were identified as entirely high-mannose-type glycosylation, and site occupancy was >90% for all glycosites except the sites N64 and N275 (Fig. 3a,b). By contrast, the five N-glycosites of \u03b1-1-acid glycoprotein were completely complex-type glycosylation, and site occupancy was >98% for all five sites (Fig. 3c,d). These results indicated that sequential endoglycosidase treatment reached completion.",

            "text": "Another major assumption is that the endoglycosidase-treated peptide glycosites that are unoccupied or occupied by high-mannose glycans or complex-type glycans are detected equally during MS analysis. To test this assumption, the HIV-1 Env trimer BG505 SOSIP.664, expressed in the presence of kifunensine (high-mannose only), was selected as a model protein (hereafter referred to as Kif_BG505). N-glycans on Kif_BG505 were first removed by sequential endoglycosidase treatment, and as expected, glycosites comprised >95% high-mannose-type glycosylation (green bars), indicating that the kifunensine treatment was effective and Kif_BG505 had high-mannose glycans (Fig. 4a). On the other hand, PNGase F treatment only was also applied to release N-glycans on Kif_BG505, resulting in peptides with homogeneous N+3 modification (>98% of purple bars, Fig. 4b). The resulting two samples were then mixed at a molar ratio of 1:1 in order to assess MS detection of glycotypes (Fig. 4c). Peptides with N+3 and N+203 modifications are both detectable for each glycosite, with a ratio of 1.0 to 1.2, suggesting slightly increased sensitivity for peptides with the N+3 modification. Synthetic peptides that carry asparagine (unoccupied), aspartic acid (PNGase F\u2013treated), and N-acetylglucosamine-linked asparagine residues at the glycosylation site, display similar ionization efficiencies during ESI-MS analysis, further indicating that the protocol is able to semiquantitatively assess site-specific N-glycan processing for glycoproteins61.",

            "text": "Membrane-bound envelope glycoproteins of various viruses, such as MERS-CoV S-2P protein and HIV Env trimer, are the target of neutralizing antibodies, and thus are the focus of vaccine development55,69. N-linked glycans on those envelope glycoproteins serve as a shield to protect the underlying protein from immune surveillance and thus confound development of effective vaccines for those viruses54. Importantly, some neutralizing antibodies to those viruses have glycan-dependent epitopes15,57,69, suggesting that vaccine design efforts would benefit greatly from understanding the N-glycan processing status at each glycosylation site. MERS-CoV S-2P protein is a large trimer (\u223c600 kDa) with \u223c25 N-linked glycans per monomer, each of which comprises two noncovalently associated subunits, S1 and S269. Characterization of site-specific N-glycan processing of a prefusion-stabilized MERS-CoV S-2P protein ectodomain (MERS S-2P) revealed that all 23 glycosites on the protein were fully occupied, except for the N104 site (Fig. 6a). High-mannose glycans were predominantly found in the S1-NTD (residues 18\u2013353), whereas other regions of the S protein, including the RBD (367\u2013588), the two subdomains (589\u2013751), and S2 (752\u20131,291), contained glycosites occupied largely by complex-type glycans (Fig. 6a). The glycan N1176, which is in the epitope for antibody G4 and was reported to mask antibody recognition69, was found to have a complex-type structure. Of note, we did not observe that the proteases used had biases on specific glycotypes (Supplementary Fig. 2). Of the 12 glycosites on the recombinant influenza haemagglutinin (HA) of A/Victoria/361/2011, three were >85% high-mannose (N45, N165, and N285), four were fully complex-type glycosylation (N22, N38, N63, and N483), and the rest were occupied by a mixture of high-mannose and complex-type glycans (Fig. 6b). It is striking to observe that the site N122 was not occupied and another site N144 was only 32% occupied on this HA glycoprotein. We also applied the protocol to the benchmark HIV Env trimer BG505 SOSIP.664, resulting in identification of all 28 glycosites with up to 2,000 spectra hits per glycosite (Fig. 6c). All 28 glycosites were >90% occupied, except the sites N185e, N197, N618, and N625. Of those that were largely occupied, 14 were >75% high-mannose, four were >75% complex-type glycosylation, and six other sites had a mixture of high-mannose and complex-type glycans. In particular, the glycosites, N295, N332, N339, N386, and N392, in the high-mannose patch region, were found to be occupied predominantly by underprocessed oligomannose, consistent with previous studies14,76. The N160 glycan, which is critical for binding of the bnAbs PG9 and PG16 to HIV Env, was composed predominantly of high-mannose structures, confirming the glycan composition at this site described in previous structural studies58,77,78. Interestingly, the high-mannose and complex-type glycans identified at each glycosylation site of BG505 SOSIP.664 matched the pathway of N-glycan processing, in which high-mannose structures are first trimmed from Man9 to Man5 before addition of the terminal monosaccharides that define complex-type/hybrid glycans, as compared to the results of the same protein obtained on intact glycopeptide level29. Thus, the sites were predominantly occupied by Man9 if they were 100% high-mannose glycosylation, whereas other sites were occupied by mixtures of processed high-mannose structures (Man8 to Man5) and simple complex-type structures if they were occupied by a mixture of high-mannose and complex-type glycans10.",
