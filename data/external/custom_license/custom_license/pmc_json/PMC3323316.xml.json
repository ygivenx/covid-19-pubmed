This international trio of authors from Switzerland, the United States, and Singapore recently published the second edition of their textbook, which adds new chapters and updates epidemiologic information. Because of the complexity of travel medicine, good resources for clinicians and travelers are needed. This edition represents a welcome addition to the library of travel medicine.",

The authors encourage a comprehensive strategy, one that discusses prevention measures such as vaccines and their appropriate uses. Appendix C is an excellent table that lists the required and recommended vaccinations for each country. The text also provides excellent information for travelers in varied situations, such as pilgrims to the Hajj, migrants, pregnant women, international adoptees, athletes, and persons who are immunocompromised.",

Although the malaria review is comprehensive, caution should be exercised when deciding not to provide prophylaxis for travelers to a country where malaria is endemic. Part 2, Infectious Health Risks and Their Prevention, is the familiar chronicle of travel-related infectious diseases. This section includes numerous maps and tables describing the epidemiology of the diseases. The authors have updated this part by adding several diseases, including severe acute respiratory syndrome.",
