In addition, most human cases have been associated with healthcare settings, with a fifth of virus detections reported among healthcare workers (Mackay and Arden 2015a, b). Travel-related MERS-CoV links have also been established, and these remain a threat to other regions in view of rapidity and intensity of travels (Fanoy et al. 2014). Since the discovery of MERS-CoV in 2012 (Zaki et al. 2012), serologic and molecular evidences have demonstrated that the virus in dromedary camels is genetically very similar to MERS-CoV in humans; hence, the conclusion that dromedary camels may serve as reservoirs for human infections (Nowotny and Kolodziejek 2014; Dudas and Rambaut 2016). Bats are also considered as the likely primary source of zoonotic beta-coronaviruses (Memish et al. 2013).",

In addition, Somalia, Sudan and Ethiopia with high seroprevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies (M\u00fcller et al. 2014) sometimes move their camels through Kenya. Hence, attention to prevent MERS-CoV has focused on camels. Although no human case of MERS-CoV has been reported in Kenya, serologic evidence for circulation of the virus in camels dates back to 1992 (Corman et al. 2014).",

However, sequencing data has suggested that MERS-CoV originated from bat ancestors and may have undergone a recombination event in the spike protein, possibly in dromedary camels in Kenya including other Eastern African regions before its exportation to the Arabian Peninsula along the camel trading routes (Omrani et al. 2015).",

The in and out-flows of people and livestock to the markets, and the volumes vary significantly across the different categories of markets and also the months of the year (Tables 3, 4, 5). The closer a market is to a terminal (final destination of the camel), the higher the level and volumes of traders, diversity of actors and animal numbers (Tables 3, 4, 5). Additionally, livestock from secondary markets are transported to many destinations and have linkages with long-distant markets. Using the MPT, it was inferred that the risk of intra- and interspecies transmission of disease is considered higher in secondary (terminal) markets compared with the primary (bush) markets (Table 3). More cattle, sheep and goats were traded through the markets compared with camels. Sale of donkeys was sparingly done and was reported only in Isiolo livestock auction yard. Seasonal variations in sales were influenced by annual migration of livestock to locations away from the markets in search of forage and water (Fig. 2a, b); during such movements, there fewer livestock are available for sale in the markets. Similarly, fewer animals were presented to the markets during the wet months of late March up until early June, and in the months of October to December. During these months, camels and cows are at their peaks in terms of production and productivity, and lush pastures are abundant, with resultant increase volume of milk for the pastoral household and the need to sell off animals to purchase food stuff is not warranted. Interviews with the traders suggested that the price of livestock skyrocketed during the low offtake period, but this increased prices of livestock do not seem to trigger increased supply of animals by the pastoralists.\n\n\n\n",

The reproductive efficiency of camels under traditional pastoral conditions is low with short breeding season, late attainment of puberty and the long gestation period of approximately 13 months; over 90% of the Kenyan camel herds currently operate under this system and will need improvement (Kaufman and Binder 2002; Skidmore 2003).

Perhaps a national camel population study conducted during periods when vegetation index is favorable and animal movement is limited may present with a different outcome. National camel identification project that may assist with animal traceability (in-migration, out-migration and within-country movement) is necessary. Because there have been direct correlation between animal population densities and animal disease (Olive et al. 2016; Corman et al. 2014), targeted surveillance should be prioritized in these camel-dense counties. In this work, counties with high seroprevalence (Marsabit, Wajir and Mandera) were primary high transit areas for camel movements and were positively correlated with camel densities, frequent animal and herd contacts. Jores (2015) argued that antibody levels of nomadic camels are significantly higher than those from ranches and that herds in northeastern parts showed increased seropositivity than camels in the north western and our finding is in agreement with this assertion. M\u00fcller et al. (2014) have earlier reported that Kenya receives many camels from Somalia and Sudan where seroprevalence values were as high as over 90%.

It is pertinent to note that these trade routes traverse parts of the country\u2019s ASAL terrains and cross one another in the course of animal movement mainly influenced by drought. At such periods, domestic and wild animals concentrate around watering points, river course and feed resources with increased level of interactions between domestic and wild animals. Such intense interaction may introduce and amplify disease pathogens and increase the likelihood of disease outbreaks. Such outbreaks are recorded periodically in Kinna, Cherab and Garbatulla areas of Isiolo, a dry season grazing area for cattle, sheep and goats (Wasonga et al. 2016). Furthermore, in the situation of acute food shortage for camels during drier periods, and as part of trade practices, some of the stock routes do trade by barter, e.g., (1) Moyale to Marsabit barters mature bull destined for the Djibouti and ultimately the Middle East markets for female calves to be sold in the Marsabit region; (2) Wajir\u2013North Horr barters female calves from Wajir for mature bulls in North Horr which are then trekked to Wajir County and sold to neighboring Somalia (Fig. 3). The implications of these barters in the epidemiology of MERS-CoV and other camel diseases cannot be underestimated.",

Previous serological works have suggested that Kenya may have had the MERS-Co virus in circulation (Jores 2015; Deem et al. 2015; M\u00fcller et al. 2014). Our conclusion is in agreement with these assertions, and we confirmed that camel population density per county, volume of camel movement through counties and intense animal\u2013animal contacts are associated with high seropositivity. Jores (2015) had earlier argued that herds in northeastern parts showed increased seropositivity than camels in the north western parts of Kenya. East-African sub-regional herds enter Kenya through Mandera, Wajir and Garissa counties thereby increasing animal-to-animal contacts, and this may be responsible for the high level of seropositivity in camels from this axis.",
