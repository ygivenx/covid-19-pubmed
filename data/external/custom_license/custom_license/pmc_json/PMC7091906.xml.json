These vectors successfully elicited cellular and humoral immune responses including in HLA-A2 mice.19 Moreover, a DNA-DNA-MVA-MVA vaccine regimen induced robust immune responses associated with an early control of heterologous HCV infection in chimpanzees.20 In the present study, we explored the B- and T-cell immune responses induced by this vaccine in rhesus macaques and investigated whether two different immunization regimens, not investigated to date, have the potential to improve the HCV-specific immune responses: DNA followed by adenovirus and SFV followed by MVA. We characterized the immune responses to each of the four vaccine antigens induced by the three regimens in rhesus macaques, and evaluated the predictive value of the rhesus macaque as a model for HCV vaccine immunogenicity by comparing the immune response observed in rhesus macaques after DNA-MVA to those observed in chimpanzees after the exact same DNA-MVA vaccine regimen.20",

This could be due to differences in the constructs rather than the delivery vector: for technical reasons, the E2 gene was inserted in a E1-E2 expressing SFV particle as opposed to a combined C-E1-E2 as in the DNA, adenovirus and MVA vectors.

Regarding the boosting potential of HuAd5, T-cell responses were relatively similar between the DNA+HuAd5 and DNA+MVA groups. Trends were observed indicating higher proliferation with MVA-boosted and higher IFN-\u03b3 responses in the HuAd5-boosted groups, but these were not statistically significant. The absence of significant differences may be due to the low number of animals per group, a limitation that is a direct consequence of working with non-human primates. In addition, the respective immunogenicity of adenovirus and MVA vaccines may be partially antigen dependent, as the effect of each antigen immunomodulatory property may also influence the cytokine microenvironment induced by the vector. For example, HuAd5 and MVA have been compared in the context of other antigens: HuAd5 was found superior to poxviruses for induction of IFN-\u03b3 T-cell responses to malaria antigens,23 while MVA encoding the MTB 85A antigen induces stronger IFN-\u03b3 producing T cells after a BCG prime.24",

            "text": "This study offers the unique opportunity to compare the immune response elicited by the DNA+MVA regimen between rhesus macaques and chimpanzees. The exact same constructs and regimen were used to immunize four chimpanzees.20 In chimpanzees, immunization induced robust multi-specific immune responses in all four animals, which, following HCV1b exposure, was associated with a drastic reduction in the peak viremia and RNA levels in liver during the acute phase of infection. The vaccine regimen induced IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 responses as detected by ELISPOT, with a similar pattern to the one observed in rhesus macaques (strong IFN- \u03b3 responses and lower IL-2 responses, especially to NS3). Contrary to rhesus macaques, however, the chimpanzees mounted more potent IL-4 responses with numbers of antigen-specific IL-4 producing cells comparable to the number of IFN-\u03b3 producing cells in three out of the four animals.20 The most striking difference between the two primate species was that DNA+MVA regime induced a robust antibody response in all chimpanzees against both E1 and E2. It is possible that the stronger IL-4 response observed in chimpanzees supported the more potent B-cell response, but the reason for the difference is unknown, and the IL-4 response was not absent in rhesus macaques, just lower than the IFN-\u03b3 response. This underlines the difficulty to predict the immunogenicity of a specific vaccine regime based on only one primate species, and to unravel the relative contribution of cellular and humoral immunity to prevent acute or chronic disease. With the availability of highly efficient antiviral drug treatments able to cure a large proportion of HCV infections, the relevance and cost of HCV vaccine development is questioned. However, the treatments are extremely expensive, particularly for developing countries, and thus a vaccine for preventing or treating HCV infection still has an indication in high prevalence countries.34, 35 While the strong restrictions on research involving chimpanzees will restrict efficacy studies, expensive phase II clinical trials will become the only possibility for evaluating the efficacy of vaccine candidates. Therefore, studies identifying approaches that are or not optimal, and investigating the predictive value of non-human primates are highly relevant in this context.",
