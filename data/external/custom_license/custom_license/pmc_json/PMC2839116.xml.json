            "text": "Members of the family Birnaviridae have 2-segmented genomes - A and B. This family comprises 3 main genera, including the genus Aquabirnavirus, Avibirnavirus, and Entomobirnavirus [4,19]. The type species of the genus Aquabirnavirus is the infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV); the genus comprises marine aquatic birnaviruses (MABV) of fish and shellfish [3]. Other members of the family Birnaviridae include infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) belongs to the genus Avibirnavirus, and Drosophila X virus (DVX) that belongs to the genus Entomobirnavirus. Aquatic birnaviruses are the largest and most diverse group of viruses within the family Birnaviridae. The first reported MABV was isolated from the yellowtail Seriola quinqueradiatain Japan [22], other MABVs have been subsequently isolated from various marine fishes in Korea and Japan, and their characteristics have been investigated [7,8,14,18,23,24]. The genome segment B of birnaviruses encodes the VP1 protein, which is the presumptive virion-associated RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) [13,15]. Some researchers reported the characteristics of VP1 and compared the VP1 region among birnaviruses [4,25]. They identified several conserved domains associated with RdRps and GTP-binding proteinsin the IPNV strains; these domains were the same as those in other RNA viruses. However, they also discovered that the typical Gly-Asp-Asp (GDD) motif that is found in all RNA viruses was absent in the VP1 region of some IPNV [4] IBDV, and DXV [2] strains.",

The MABV genogroup consisted of strains such as GC1 and NC1 from Korea and YT01A, H1, AY98, and Y6 from Japan. Genogroup 1 mostly consisted of strains from the Pacific coastal nations; DRT is from Korea, WB from the USA, Jasper from Canada, and AM98 from Japan.
