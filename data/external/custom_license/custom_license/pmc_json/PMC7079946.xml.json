The Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) was initiated in 1974 with the goal of providing universal immunization with essential vaccines. Among the initially targeted six vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs), diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, measles, poliomyelitis, tuberculosis, a substantial reduction in the burden of preventable childhood illnesses and deaths was achieved in its initial years [2, 3]. Over the past decades, national immunization programmes (NIPs) have become substantially more complex, with vaccines now available to protect against more than 20 infectious diseases, while health, societal, and political changes created additional volatility and ambiguity in often more uncertain environments (e.g., with the occurrence of conflicts, epidemics, or increasing vaccine hesitancy). Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, was established in 2000 primarily to allow new vaccines to reach children in the poorest countries [4]. Stagnating global immunization coverage rates in many countries led global partners of the Decade of Vaccines Collaboration1 to initiate the Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP) in 2012 [5]. This plan states in its mission \u201cto extend, by 2020 and beyond, the full benefits of immunization to all people, regardless of where they are born, who they are, or where they live\u201d. The important focus on equitable immunization uptake and coverage is also reflected in the present Gavi strategy 2016\u20132020, and will likely be sustained in a subsequent Gavi strategy leading up to 2025 [6] and in the new Immunization Agenda 2030 (IA2030) [7].",

More children than ever (116.3 million) are receiving three doses of DTP before their first birthday, 4.9 million more than in 2010. By 2018, 129 countries had reached at least 90% coverage of the third dose of DTP vaccine [9]. Country decision-making capabilities were strengthened, and many life-saving vaccines were introduced primarily in the poorest countries [10]. Regional Vaccine Action Plans were designed, a global immunization monitoring and evaluation framework was established, and efforts were made to shape vaccine markets and to improve vaccine price transparency. Overall, the GVAP helped to build political will and kept immunization visible on the global agenda [11].",

Elimination and eradication goals for polio, measles, rubella, and neonatal tetanus have not been met everywhere and vaccine-derived polio virus and measles outbreaks are still circulating. Importantly, not every child or eligible person is being reached everywhere [11, 12]. Inequities in vaccine uptake and disease persist across countries, and inequalities in routine immunization coverage can contribute to the continued occurrence and outbreaks of VPDs. The global coverage of the third dose of diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus-pertussis (DPT) vaccine is stagnating at 86% with little change since 2010. In some countries, progress has even gone into reverse. One in 10 infants worldwide has still not received any vaccine as reflected in first dose DPT coverage and an estimated 19.4 million infants were not reached with routine immunization services such as three primary doses of DPT vaccine [8, 13].",

Social determinants of health, such as individual and household income and education, impact immunization uptake [16] and areas of low coverage often overlap with those that are home to ethnic minorities, as well as marginalized or nomadic and migrant populations [17\u201319]. In many situations, governments face challenges in reaching such underserved populations or lack the political will to do so. Increasingly, there are also substantial inequities in vaccine use between urban and rural populations [20], with coverage in urban slum populations often as low as in remote rural communities. A preliminary scenario based on projected proportions of unimmunized children in rural and urban areas shows that almost half (44%) of the unimmunized and under-immunized children in the top 10 countries that were home to more than half of the unimmunized and under-immunized children in 2017 lived in urban areas, and almost every fifth unimmunized child (18%) lived in a slum [21, 22]. Inequalities in the vaccine coverage by wealth quintiles can also reach enormous dimensions. A child from a rich family can be up to 9 times more likely to be vaccinated for DTP3 than a child from a poor family in certain countries [23].",

This includes strategies for detecting and reaching marginalized and partially served populations, adjusting service availability and convenience, creating synergies with accelerated disease control activities, and creating demand for vaccination. These routine services may be supplemented by a strategy termed the Periodic Intensification of Routine Immunization (PIRI) as a mechanism to catch up individuals who may have missed their routine doses. Another strategy to rapidly increase population immunity is to deliver additional doses of vaccines through supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) or vaccination campaigns.",

In response to these equity challenges, MICs with support from major immunization partners2 have developed strategies addressing a number of specific issues important to sustainably reach the underserved populations [37]. These include support for decision-making and political commitment, financial sustainability, enhanced demand and equitable delivery, as well as affordable and timely supply [35].

In this broader context, tetanus toxoid will successively be replaced with tetanus-diphtheria vaccines to ensure sustained protection against both diseases [44]. The new WHO strategy to achieve the elimination of cervical cancer as a public health concern focuses on increasing the coverage of vaccination against HPV as one of three key targets besides screening and HPV testing [45]. NIPs can also help to further increase equitable coverage of other health interventions, such as vitamin A supplementation, anti-helminthic treatment, nutrition interventions, insecticide-impregnated bed-nets, and intermittent preventive treatment against malaria.

Recent work has shown that immunization coverage increases of 10%, and more can be achieved with relatively simple measures. Chad, with 43% of eligible children leaving health facilities unvaccinated, made a quick evaluation and initiated a missed-opportunities-for-vaccination strategy using cross-referral, which led to a sizable increase in the number of vaccinated children [47].",

Drug resistant infections may already cause 700,000 deaths per year and it is estimated that 10 million deaths due to AMR may occur every year after 2050 [49]. Vaccines can impact antibiotic-resistant infections through a direct reduction in the resistant organisms and strains that are specifically targeted by the vaccine, as well as through a reduction in common illnesses that often lead to the use of antibiotics and therefore selection pressure on pathogens [50]. The widespread use of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and pneumococcal vaccines have resulted in a dramatic reduction in disease burden and have been associated with decreased incidence of resistant strains. Universal coverage with pneumococcal vaccination could potentially avoid more than 11 million days of antibiotic use per year in children under 5 [51, 52]. A newer typhoid conjugate vaccine has a potential for high impact on prevention and control of antimicrobial resistant typhoid fever and was recently strategically used to control an extensively drug resistant typhoid outbreak in Pakistan [53]. But vaccines against viruses, e.g., influenza, can also exert a major impact here, due to the inappropriate prescription of antibiotics. Vaccines offer a more sustainable approach to infection prevention, since pathogen resistance to vaccines is uncommon [51]. The equitable use of vaccines is expected to avert substantial parts of the AMR-related fraction of disease, reduce antibiotic use, and\u2014together with other interventions across human and animal health\u2014add to the reduction in the economic and societal burden of AMR [54].",

At the same time, measles cases have been reduced through vaccination by 83% since 2000, preventing 21.1 million deaths [8]. Important lessons informing enhanced immunization strategies can be learned from these efforts.",

Again, strategies to accelerate progress towards measles elimination comprise the enhanced use of surveillance platforms, which have been established in many countries to detect and respond to communicable diseases. In addition to conducting surveillance, the collection of detailed subnational coverage data and outbreak investigations are used to distinctly map areas and age groups with immunity gaps. Specific approaches can then be used to fill these gaps in line with the Measles and Rubella Strategic Plan, e.g., through targeted SIAs [57].",

Where possible, such initiatives should be combined with other vaccines or interventions, as appropriate, to maximize impact and achieve efficiency gains [62]. Capacities for the rapid deployment of vaccines and other interventions have been strengthened as a legacy of polio eradication and measles elimination efforts. Major efforts for rebuilding systems with enhanced preparedness and response capacities were seen with the recent Ebola outbreaks in West and Central Africa; this strategy was also pursued in the cholera outbreaks in conflict zones of Syria and Yemen or the diphtheria outbreaks among the Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh.",
