            "text": "Figure 1B shows the details\nof the interactions in the MERS-CoV N protein dimer. We named the\nunits monomer 1 and monomer 2 (Figure 1A). According to the amino acid composition of the\nbinding site on monomer 2, we divided the dimeric interface into two\nareas: one located on the N-terminus flexible region and the other\non the loop between \u03b24 and \u03b25 of the N protein. In the\nfirst area, W43, N66, N68, Y102, and F135 of monomer 1 generated a\nconserved hydrophobic pocket permitting the side chain of M38 of monomer\n2 to enter this hole by a hydrophobic contact (Figure 1C,D). H37 and N39 of monomer 2 were packed\nagainst W43 and F135 of monomer 1, respectively, and contributed to\nthe hydrophobic interaction. The side chains of N39 of monomer 2 formed\none hydrogen bond with the N68 backbone in monomer 1 at a distance\nof 2.6 \u00c5. The second area was relatively more hydrophilic. The\nmain chain oxygens of G104, F135, and T137 of monomer 2 formed three\nhydrogen bonds with the side chains of Q73 and T134 of monomer 1 at\ndistances of 3.8, 3.2, and 3.7 \u00c5, respectively. The side chain\nof N139 on monomer 2 formed a hydrogen bond with the main chain oxygen\nof T137 on monomer 1 at a distance of 3.6 \u00c5. The interactions\nof the first and second areas comprise buried surface areas (BSA)\nof 289 and 103 \u00c52, respectively. The small surface\narea buried at the interface accounts for \u223c5 kcal mol\u20131 binding energy,26 which translates to\na dissociation constant of \u223c200 mM. Thus, the dimer described\nhere is unique in that it is non-native and relies on vector-fusion\nresidues (H37 and M38) to maintain its dimeric status. This property\nmay also explain why the present structure has an oligomeric status\ndifferent from previously reported structures for the CoV N protein.24,27\u221230 We used cross-linking experiments to analyze the oligomeric capacity\nof MERS N-NTD containing the vector-fusion residues in solution. MERS\nN-NTD had a dimeric conformation in solution. Our structure indicated\nthat W43 played an essential role in forming the hydrophobic pocket\naccommodating the vector-fusion residues and, therefore, mediated\nthe N-NTD dimer formation. The W43A mutation significantly reduced\nthe oligomeric tendency of N-NTD (Figure S1C). This further supports that the \u201cexogenous residues\u201d\nencoded by the vector backbone mediated the formation of the non-native\ndimer. We also superimposed the previously published structure of\nMERS-CoV N-NTD (PDB ID: 4ud1)27 containing a native\nN-terminal flexible region with our dimer structure. The side chain\nof N38 in the native structure could not interact with the hydrophobic\npocket as the former is hydrophilic and short (Figure S1E). Thus, it may be possible to utilize small compounds\nto replace the vector-fusion residues and stabilize the PPI through\nhydrophobic interactions.",

We chose the\nhighest-scoring hits, listed in Table S2, based on shape complementarity, the presence of aromatic moieties,\nand the ability to stack onto W43 of N-NTD. Because the formation\nof the non-native dimers was primarily mediated by hydrophobic interactions\nin our structure (Figure 1C,D), we next considered the hydrophobic complementarity between\nthe acquired ligands and N-NTD in the form of the lipophilic match\nsurface (SL/L).31 We also took into account the ability of the drug to permeate cells\nby aiming for lower topological polar surface areas (TPSA). Based\non the above criteria, three compounds were finally chosen for further\nstudy. Benzyl-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1-indolinecarboxylate (P1) and 5-benzyloxygramine\n(P3) had higher SL/L and docking scores\nand lower TPSA. The clinical drug etodolac (P2) had a comparable SL/L but a lower docking score. It too was selected\nas a candidate.\nHowever, only P3 induced a comparatively larger blue shift in the\nintrinsic N-NTD fluorescence spectrum, indicating that the microenvironment\nsurrounding the tryptophans of the protein increased in rigidity and\nhydrophobicity in the presence of P3.32 The result also indicated that P3 bound more tightly to the N protein\nthan P1 or P2 by interacting with the W43 pocket (Figure 2B). Fluorescent thermal stability\nassays disclosed that the N-NTD denaturation melting temperature had\nincreased from 42 to 45 \u00b0C when P3 was added. The sigmoidal melting\ncurve for MERS-CoV N-NTD changed in the presence of P3. The delay\nin protein denaturation suggests that P3 stabilized the MERS-CoV N-NTD\ndimer structure (Figure 2C). We then measured the cytotoxic concentration (CC50) and effective concentration (EC50) for each compound\nusing Vero E6 cells infected with MERS-CoV. Table 1 shows that P3 had a favorable therapeutic\nindex among the lead compounds tested in this study. Therefore, P3\nis an excellent candidate inhibitor against MERS-CoV.",

Excellent fits were obtained.\nRepresentative structural models for the full-length protein without\nand with P3 are shown in Figure 3D,E, respectively. The free N protein formed a tetramer\nthrough CTD with the NTD freely hanging in solution (Figure 3D). The conformation of the\nsolution was consistent with structures previously reported for other\nCoV N proteins.33 The N-P3 complex formed\na compact hexadecamer with a sunburst configuration (Figure 3E). The CTDs formed a central\nring and non-native NTD dimers formed \u201cspikes\u201d protruding\nfrom the ring. Consistent with ligand-induced aggregation, we observed\na \u201cblue shift\u201d in the fluorescence spectrum of the full-length\nMERS-CoV N protein in the presence of P3 (Figure 3F). The addition of P3 also delayed N protein\nthermal denaturation and changed the shape of the denaturation curve,\nfurther suggesting that large protein aggregates formed in the presence\nof P3 (Figure 3G).\nThe structure explains how N-NTD dimerization decreased MERS-CoV viability.\nThe N protein packages the viral genome into an RNP complex. Several\nmodels for N-CTD dimer assembly have been proposed for the formation\nof filamentous RNPs.33 All of the proposed\ninterfaces between N-CTD dimers occurred on the side-faces of the\nCTD cuboid perpendicular to the proposed RNA-binding surface (Figure 3H). Combinatorial\nuse of any region on the side-faces of the CTD dimer cuboid may facilitate\nmanipulation of the RNP length and curvature without obstructing the\nRNA-binding surface.28,34 However, the SAXS results indicated\nthat N-CTD aggregation occurred on the \u03b2-sheet floor of the\nCTD cuboid. For this reason, the RNA-binding surface of the CTD is\noccluded by the neighboring CTD on the ring and by the non-native\nNTD dimer making direct contact with the CTD (Figures 3H and S3). In\naddition, the CTD cuboids in the aggregation naturally form a topologically\nclosed octamer, leaving no open ends for further addition of CTD cuboids\nto form a long filamentous RNP. Both the loss of the RNA-binding surface\nand the inability to incorporate further N protein molecules beyond\nan octamer may inhibit the formation of the RNP. Therefore, P3 may\ninhibit MERS-CoV RNP formation by inducing N protein aggregation.",

With\nthe exception of P2, the complex structures of N-NTD with P1 and P3\nwere solved at resolutions of 3.09 and 2.77 \u00c5, respectively (Table S1). The overall structures of the complexes\nresembled that of apo-MERS-CoV. Both complexes revealed well-defined\nunbiased densities in the dimer interface and permitted detailed analysis\nof the interactions between the compounds and MERS-CoV N-NTD (Figure 5). The interactions\nbetween the N protein and each compound were calculated with the Discovery\nStudio Client (v19.1.0.18287). Most interactions were hydrophobic\ncontacts, which were consistent with our selection rationale. In the\nP1 complex, N68, F135, and D143 on monomer 1 and V41, G106, P107,\nand T137 on monomer 2 packed against P1 to create a dimer (Figure 5A). In addition,\ntwo nonbonding interactions were detected between P1 and the monomers.\nThere was a \u03c0-anion interaction between the benzene ring of\nthe P1 indoline moiety and D143 of monomer 1. There was also a \u03c0-donor\nhydrogen bond between the other P1 benzene ring and the T137 side\nchain of monomer 2 (Figure 5B). Relative to P1, P3 bound more deeply into the dimer interface\nand interacted with a larger number of residues on both N-NTD monomers.\nThe amino acid composition of this binding region was W43, N66, N68,\nS69, T70, N73, and F135 on monomer 1 and V41, G104, T105, G106, A109,\nand T137 on monomer 2. These residues along with P3 generated a massive\nhydrophobic driving force allowing the proteins and ligands to pack\nagainst each other and stabilize the dimeric conformation of the N\nprotein (Figure 5C).\nSeveral nonbonding interactions were also observed at the P3-binding\nsite. These included the interaction between the P3 benzene ring and\nN68 of monomer 1 and A109 of monomer 2 via \u03c0-lone pair and \u03c0-alkyl\ninteractions. The dimethylaminomethyl moiety of P3 was a major source\nof nonbonding interactions. Three \u03c0-cation interactions formed\nbetween this moiety and the aromatic groups of W43 and F135 in monomer\n1. This moiety also formed a \u03c0-lone pair interaction with N66\nand a \u03c0-sigma interaction with W43 of monomer 1 (Figure 5D).

            "text": "The use of small molecules\nto stabilize PPI interfaces has been\nshown to be a viable approach for the development of new therapeutics.\nMost compounds created by structure-based design to manipulate the\nPPI depend on detailed knowledge of the native interacting interfaces.35\u221237 In contrast, most of the compounds with therapeutic potential that\nstabilize non-native PPI interfaces were discovered by chance alone.38 The anti-influenza compound nucleozin was initially\ndiscovered using a chemical genetics approach, and its ability to\nstabilize non-native nucleoprotein oligomers was elucidated much later.39,40 Swinholide A, a cytotoxic marine macrolide, has been known to disrupt\nthe actin cytoskeleton and act as an anticancer agent, but it took\nten years to discover that it stabilized G-actin as a non-native homodimer\ncomplex.41\u221243 However, these examples did underscore the importance\nof hydrophobicity as a crucial factor stabilizing protein\u2013protein\nand protein\u2013ligand associations.44 Here, we demonstrated the possibility of using the hydrophobic interactions\non non-native interfaces as targets for virtual screening. Combined\nwith suitable selection criteria focusing on both shape and hydrophobic\ncomplementarities between the ligand and the receptor, small-molecule\ncompounds that stabilize non-native PPIs may be identified in a rational\nmanner. Using the above approach, we successfully identified a compound\nP3 that affected the biochemical activity of our target protein and\nshowed efficacy against our target pathogen MERS-CoV (Figures 2 and 4). P3-mediated non-native MERS-CoV N-NTD dimerization induced abnormal\nN protein aggregation by influencing the oligomeric behavior of N-CTD\nand eventually halting its function in RNP formation. To the best\nof our knowledge, this structure-based strategy for targeting non-native\ninterfaces has never been proposed for therapeutic design. Thus, non-native\ninteraction interfaces in proteins may comprise a new drug development\ntarget class. For \u03b2-coronaviruses such as MERS-CoV, the amino\nacids comprising the non-native interaction interface on N-NTD are\nrelatively conserved. The hydrophobic pocket surrounding W43 and F135\non monomer 1 is shared among other \u03b2-coronaviruses.24,28 The interacting surface on monomer 2, which includes G104, T105,\nG106, and A109, is also highly conserved (Figure S4). This conservation may provide certain advantages when\ndeveloping compounds with broad-spectrum activity against a target\npathogen family, including COVID-19. When we tested P3 on mouse hepatitis\nvirus (MHV), we observed a reduction in viral titer, indicating that\nP3 may also inhibit MHV replication (Figure S5). On the other hand, targeting non-native interaction interfaces\nis not trivial. As interface formation is induced by an external agent,\ncomputations aimed at predicting native PPI structures may not be\nable to identify potential non-native interfaces. Nevertheless, several\nstratagems may assist in the identification of potential non-native\ninteraction interfaces. One strategy is to search for target protein\nstructures with crystal packing contacts known to be biologically\nirrelevant. Another approach is to identify weakly interacting sites\nthrough NMR chemical shift perturbation and hydrogen-deuterium exchange\nMS.45 Once these potential non-native interaction\ninterfaces are identified, standard screening and then functional\ncharacterization may be conducted for small compounds that bind to\nthe interface.",

An ensemble optimization method (EOM) analysis\nwas performed through the EMBL Hamburg web interface.50 Modeling of the rigid body crystal structure was calculated\nand generated using CRYSOL (ATSAS Program Suite v. 2.8.2).51 The crystal structures of MERS-CoV NTD (PDB\nID: 4UD1)27 and MERS-CoV NTD:P3 (solved in this study) and\nthe CTD domain of MERS-CoV N protein (PDB ID: 6G13)23 were used as rigid bodies in EOM analysis. With the EOM analysis, 1000 models were generated\nin the beginning as a structural pool. Selected from the SAXS profiles\nof the structural pool was an ensemble of models that could fit the\nexperimental scattering curve with their linear combination. Tetrameric\nMERS-CoV NP conformations and 16-mer MERS-CoV:P3 conformations were\nselected because their ensemble generated curves fit best to the experimental\nSAXS results.",
