A consensus on recommended procedures was achieved through periodic informal consultative meetings convened by WHO for discussions among GPLN subject-matter experts. Briefly, stool specimens from AFP cases are inoculated into cell cultures, and any polioviruses isolated have serotype and intratype determined. Partial genomic nucleotide sequences are generated for wild and programmatically important Sabin-related poliovirus isolates, and phylogenetic relationships among isolates are analyzed to investigate transmission linkages [2, 3].",

A mixed approach is used to train personnel. Regional workshops are the most cost-effective way to simultaneously train multiple persons using standardized training curricula that allows time for practical work and covers theoretical aspects of procedures, equipment (selection, maintenance, and calibration), results analysis and interpretation, troubleshooting, reporting, and discussion of safety. An added benefit is the fostering of collaborative linkages with facilitators and peer learning among participants. Two other training approaches are on-site training conducted by WHO staff or consultants, and trainee assignments to reference laboratories.",

This serially focused approach to VPD control aimed to leverage the gains in vaccine coverage and surveillance achieved through polio eradication, while effectively using the limited public health resources available. Success hinged on the relative geographic separation of the Americas and the moderate transmissibility of poliovirus.",

The model of polio surveillance to be implemented after eradication, mainly the environmental surveillance of poliovirus in this model, will be the cost driver and needs to be carefully considered to ensure the sustainability of the platform. Indeed, when eradication of polio will be achieved after several missed milestones and setbacks, engagement of different stakeholders for long-term support may change.
